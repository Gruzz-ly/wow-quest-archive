}}</p>
<p>This series of quests consists of either neutral quests,
or of equivalent Alliance and Horde quests.</p>
<p>In this series of quests you investigate strange happenings at
[[Cenarion Thicket]].  Following a chain of clues, you eventually
find that the [[Blood Elf|Blood Elves]] of [[Firewing Point]] are
constructing a doomsday device.</p>
<p>You gain significant rewards three times during the course of this
chain of quests.</p>
<p>== The Terokkar Mana Bomb ==</p>
<p>=== Preamble: [[What's Wrong at Cenarion Thicket?]] ===
One of your contacts tells you
that the druids of [[Cenarion Thicket]], in [[Terokkar Forest]] have not
been heard from in some time.  Would you go find out if something has
happened to them?</p>
<p>:'' '''Note:''' Alliance characters can obtain this quest from [[Jenai Starwhisper]], in [[Allerian Stronghold]].  Horde characters can get it from [[Tooki]], at [[Stonebreaker Hold]]. Any character can obtain it from [[Lethyn Moonfire]], of [[Cenarion Refuge]], in [[Zangarmarsh]], once friendly with [[Cenarion Expedition]].''</p>
<p>=== Act 1: Discovery ===
Of the druids at Cenarion Thicket, you find only two alive.  One,
[[Earthbinder Tavgren]], was away when whatever it was happened.  The
other, [[Warden Treelos]], has gone insane.</p>
<p>Earthbinder Tavgren has two tasks for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>'''[[Strange Energy]]'''
Tavgren tells you that something has upset the natural balance of the thicket.
Teromoths, normally peaceful, have become much more aggressive in the area
of the thicket.  He asks you to collect some samples of the moths within the
thicket, to compare to the normal ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>The teromoth samples are easy to get, really.  You wander near a moth, then
defend yourself, collecting samples from the remains.</p>
<p>Returning them, Tavgren finds that the teromoths seem to have been infused
with pure mana somehow.  Whatever caused the energy that the teromoths have
absorbed must have been what killed the druids of the thicket.</p>
<ul>
<li>'''[[Clues in the Thicket]]'''
The other thing Tavgren wants you to do, is to find something - anything -
that might point to what killed all the druids.  Tavgren himself was in the
thicket only briefly, but he thought he saw the body of a [[Broken]] with
some strange object next to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>You investigate.  Sure enough, there's a dead Broken, and the remains of some
device next to it.</p>
<p>=== Act 2: Investigation ===
*'''[[By Any Means Necessary]]'''
Earthbinder Tavgren tells you to find [[Empoor]], a Broken merchant, and
persuade him to talk.</p>
<p>He doesn't do so willingly, though.  You approach him on the issue, and he
sends his bodyguard after you.  After some ... gentle persuasion... he sees
the error of his ways.  He agrees to tell you what
he knows while he bandages his wounds.</p>
<p>*'''[[Wind Trader Lathrai]]'''
Even after the beating, though, he doesn't tell you much.
[[Wind Trader Lathrai]], an [[Ethereal]] in [[Shattrath City]], hired him
to move some boxes.  ... and that's all you are able to get from him.</p>
<p>*'''[[A Personal Favor]]'''
Wind Trader Lathrai, when you get to Shattrath, is coy.  "Perhaps my memory
would improve if you did me a favor..."  It's a better deal than trying to
beat the information out of him.  After all, he's an ethereal, who knows
what you'd have to do...</p>
<p>The Wind Trader sends you to [[Veil Skith]], where the [[Arakkoa]] have
taken one of his shipments of exotic goods, and he wants it back.  ALL back.</p>
<p>A dangerous task, it takes you a while to retrieve all 5 crates of goods.  But
they must have been ''quite'' valuable to him, as not only does it loosen his
tongue, he is willing to give you a bonus.</p>
<p>*'''[[Investigate Tuurem]]'''
It seems that yes, Lathrai did sell [[Empoor]] several boxes of exotic
engineering parts a month back, and the Empoor was delivering them to
someone at [[Tuurem]].  He suggests that perhaps some of the parts might still
be there somewhere.</p>
<p>Off you go, to poke around Tuurem.  Sure enough, after a good bit of poking
around the ruined huts, you find a box of engineering parts.  And a suprise!
There's a blood elf courier guarding it!  The courier objects to your taking
the parts, but you refuse to take 'no' for an answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>'''[[What Are These Things?]]'''
You return to Earthbinder Tavgren with the parts, but he has no more idea
what they are for than you do.  However, he knows who to talk to.</li>
</ul>
<p>=== Act 3: The Mana Bomb ===
[[Earthbinder Tavgren]] sends you to a nearby stronghold, to talk to someone
better connected than he is.  (A local spymaster?  Who can say?)</p>
<p>:'' '''Note:''' Alliance characters are sent to [[Jenai Starwhisper]], in [[Allerian Stronghold]].  Horde characters are sent to [[Tooki]], at [[Stonebreaker Hold]].''</p>
<p>At the stronghold, your contact reveals that the Ethereals have been smuggling
proscribed goods in from other dimensions.  The box you brought,
for instance, has bomb parts.</p>
<p>*'''[[Report to the Allerian Post]]''' or '''[[Report to Stonebreaker Camp]]'''
This calls for immediate action.  Your contact directs you to a scout
closer to [[Firewing Point]].</p>
<p>:'' '''Note:''' Alliance characters are sent to [[Lieutenant Meridian]] at [[Allerian Post]].  Horde Characters are sent to [[Sergeant Chawni]] at [[Stonebreaker Camp]].</p>
<p>*'''[[Attack on Firewing Point (Alliance)]] / [[Attack on Firewing Point (Horde)|(Horde)]]'''
The scout directs you to disrupt the activity at [[Firewing Point]] in the
simplest way possible - kill a good many of them.  You wreak appropriately
high levels of casualties among the blood elves.  But while you are doing
that, you get a good look at what they are building in the courtyard.</p>
<p>And it doesn't look good.</p>
<p>*'''[[The Final Code (Alliance)]] / [[The Final Code (Horde)]]'''
Killing Blood Elves bent on bombing civilization may be a good thing, but
the important thing is making sure the bomb doesn't go off anywhere that you
care about.  So the scout wants you to get [[The Final Code]] for the bomb
from the overseer, and set the nasty thing off.</p>
<p>You find [[Sharth Voldoun]] at the top of one of the towers at
[[Firewing Point]].  You take the final code from his body, and go back down
to the bomb.  And shortly thereafter, the blood elves of Firewing Point find
themselves hoist by their own petard, quite literally.</p>
<p>Even from some distance away, you feel the effects.  But not so bad as had
they managed to complete it, and deliver it to a neighborhood near you.</p>
<p>The spymaster (or whatever) back at the stronghold is overjoyed.
Singlehandedly, you've taken out the blood elf leader and destroyed the bomb
that was going to wipe out who knows how many people.</p>
<p>*'''[[Letting Earthbinder Tavgren Know (Alliance)]] / [[Letting Earthbinder Tavgren Know (Horde)|(Horde)]]'''
You finish celebrating your victory and set off again for the unfortunate
[[Cenarion Thicket]], where your quest started.</p>
<p>[[Earthbinder Tavgren]] greets you, and listens to the tale of your exploits.
Still, he can think of no reason the Blood Elves would want to obliterate
the Thicket.  Perhaps [[Warden Treelos]] might know, but that answer is 
locked away behind a wounded mind.</p>
