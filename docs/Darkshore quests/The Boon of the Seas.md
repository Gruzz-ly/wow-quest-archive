==Objectives==
Collect 16 Encrusted Clam Muscles.
* [[Encrusted Clam Muscle]] (16)

==Description==
It is good to see you. You were key in ensuring that our loved ones made it home, and I hold some hope that you may yet help us further.

Like Laird, their wounds will be grave - every one of them battered by the coast and assaulted by the elementals. I am doing what I can, but it seems that those elementals hosted a toxin that is weakening their ability to heal. I believe I can concoct a salve, but I will need secretion from the muscles of the clams that inhabit this coast. Can you help me?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Diver's Waistband
|Diver's Cord
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Did you bring muscles from the clams? I worry that our time grows very short. 

==Completion==
This will do perfectly. Thank you so much!

I suspect they will want to thank you personally should they recover, so perhaps you can stop by later on.

== Notes ==
On acceptance:
:{{text|say|Serendia Oakwhisper|When the wounded arrive, we will be putting them up in the Inn while we tend to their recovery.  Please find us there when you return.}}
