==Objectives==
Use your fishing skill to obtain 4 Darkshore Grouper.
*[[Darkshore Grouper]] (4)

==Description==
Between boat rides and building, I'm exhausted... and hungry. You know what sounds tasty? Fish. Fish sound delicious.

Darkshore is known for its grouper. If you fish me up some, I'll make it worth your time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]
*[[Staats' Fishing Pole]]

==Progress==
<Johnathan's belly grumbles as you approach.>

Couldn't have said it better with words.

==Completion==
It looks like fishing's your thing.  My belly appreciates the gift.

I'm thinking you would get more use out of this pole than I would.  Have at it.
