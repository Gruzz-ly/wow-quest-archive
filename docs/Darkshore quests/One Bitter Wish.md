==Objectives==
Kill Rit'ko, the Shatterspear Torturer.

* [[Rit'ko]] slain

==Description==
Morra sent you? I should have listened to her - it's just hard to take trolls seriously I guess.

<Alanndarian lets out a weak chuckle.>

It's way too late for that anyway. We're mortal now... this is the fate we have to face, one way or another. I've had time to accept that.

I have one request though... kill the torturer that did this to me. They call him Rit'ko... you can find him just ahead with the other prisoner.

<Alanndarian offers a small smile, then winces and slumps back over in pain.>

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|600}} (+{{coppercost|540}} at max level)

==Progress==
Did you find either of the captives?

==Completion==
Alanndarian is dead then. That saddens me greatly, but it is not entirely unexpected. I expect no mercy from these savages, and will show them none. 

== Notes ==
Rit'ko will drop the [[Shatterspear Torturer's Cage Key]] to open the Shatterspear Cage holding [[Sentinel Aynasha]].  She will offer the escort quest [[Timely Arrival]], however the cage is bugged and will remain open if the quest fails.  She will not offer the quest if you can't interact with the cage, and the only solution is to wait for dailies to reset.
