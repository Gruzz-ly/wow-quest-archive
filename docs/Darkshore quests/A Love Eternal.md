==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Anaya Dawnrunner.jpg|Anaya Dawnrunner|For some, letting go is the hardest thing they will ever have to do.}}
Free the spirit of [[Anaya Dawnrunner]] and retrieve her pendant.
* Anaya Dawnrunner slain
* [[Anaya's Pendant]]

==Description==
I would like to extend my gratitude for saving us. I would call myself fortunate, but my beloved, Anaya, lays long dead. I am alone and deeply troubled, and sadly, I require your aid yet again.

Wandering the woods of Darkshore after my rescue, I found myself in the ruins of Bashal'Aran... where I saw the haunted spirit of my beloved.

She must be freed, but I lack the heart to do it. Her spirit must be destroyed.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Forlorn Shield
|Restless Leggings
|Legguards of Eternal Longing
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
I somehow avoided being inflicted with the same toxin that the other survivors now endure. I cannot help but be envious of them to a degree though... living an eternity alone seems not worth living at all.

I miss you so much, Anaya. 

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Perhaps it would have been better... if I had done it myself. But even after these thousands of years, I could not bear to raise my hand against my beloved.

Please, I would be alone with my grief...

== Notes ==
The original cutscene ending will sometimes not happen, but will show up in your chat window; Anaya doesn't appear, Cerellean doesn't react to anyone, nor are there any speech bubbles.

: {{text|say|Anaya|Let it not trouble your heart, beloved.  You have freed me from slavery, and for that I love you all the more.}}
: {{text|say|Anaya|Sadly, even this must be cut short...  The ties that bind me to this world weaken, and pull me away...}}
