== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Aros}} northeast of the Grove of the Ancients in [[Darkshore]].

== Description ==
We may not have twenty stone giants to take on our enemy, but we giants of ancient lumber are as strong as any rock.

Look around you, <race>. My kindred sleep... yet they will heed the keeper's horn when the time of need is upon them.

You will find Aros, the keeper of the grove, beyond the bridge northeast of here.

Tell him the urgency of our situation.

== Completion ==
Aros's body appears to be lifeless yet still warm.  Perhaps his killers are nearby.
