This quest starts by finding a [[Corruptor's Master Key]] on one of the vile creatures inside [[Cliffspring Hollow]].

== Objectives ==
Free 8 [[Uncorrupted Thistle Bear]]s from the cages in Cliffspring Hollow.
* Uncorrupted animals freed (8)
* [[Corruptor's Master Key]] (provided}

== Description ==
This key appears to be for the animal cages spread throughout Cliffspring Hollow. [[Tharnariun Treetender|Tharnariun]] would surely appreciate if you took advantage of the situation to free some of the uncorrupted duskrats and thistle bears that are still being held captive.

== Progress ==
Yes, <race>?

== Completion ==
I am pleased to hear that you were able to free some of the remaining wildlife.  With a bit of good fortune, we will find the cure for the corruption that the others have faced before any more of them die.
