Speak to [[Nathanos Blightcaller]].
* Speak to Nathanos

==Description==
We all have our reasons for accepting the [[val'kyr]]'s gift. But now is not the time for those discussions.

[[Sylvanas]] has been dealt a heavy blow today with the loss of [[Brynja]]. We will have no time to rest before the [[Alliance]] descends on this place.

Nathanos has summoned you. There is something you must see.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 800 [[XP]]
*[[Brynja's Beacon]]

==Progress==
These elves have no idea what they're dealing with.

==Completion==
What happens now? We prepare for battle.

They will all pay.

==Notes==
Talk to [[Nathanos Blightcaller]] who is accompanied by [[Shendruk]].

:{{Gossip|What did you want to show me?}}
[[Terror of Darkshore]] cutscene plays.

: ''At [[Lor'danel Landing]], [[Nathanos Blightcaller]] and [[Shendruk]] are walking towards the tent.''
:{{text|bossemote|Nathanos|All of it?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Shendruk|The entire shipment.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Shendruk|Down to the last sack of grain.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Shendruk|This one's the only survivor.}}
: ''Nathanos enters the tent and sees a Troll captain holding a braclet praying to [[Bwonsamdi]].''
:{{text|bossemote|Troll captain|Bwonsamdi...do not take me yet.}}
: ''The troll leader turns to see Nathanos and Shendruk.''
:{{text|bossemote|Nathanos|What happened?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Troll captain|We were bringing supplies to the warfront.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Troll captain|Just like all the other times.}}
: ''The sequence dissolves into a flashback as the Troll leader, Blood Elf Paladin, Troll Warrior, and 2 orc grunts and a kodo traveling in Darkshore.''
:{{text|bossemote|Troll captain|Pick up the pace!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Troll captain|We've got to get these supplies to our soldiers by dawn!}}
: ''Then something dashed in the sky and the troll captain stopped his crew. [[Dori'thur]] lands on top of a branch staring at the troll captain.''
:{{text|bossemote|Blood Elf Paladin|What is it?}}
: ''The Troll captain stops the Blood elf paladin and stares at Dori'thur. The kodo starts to growl. And then something slaughtered the Blood Elf Paladin and the troll warrior and the orc grunt.''
: ''The other Orc grunt tries to calm down the kodo but was slaughtered. The Kodo drops the supplies. The troll captain heads to the Kodo but it knocks the captain into the tree.''
: ''The Troll captain watches as the Kodo escapes. He then turns to see the orc grunt being under attack but a bear which turns out to be [[Malfurion Stormrage]]. Malfurion turns back to his human form as he sinks the Orc grunt into the ground. The troll captain picks up his axe but he was grabbed by Malfurion's hand.''
: ''Malfurion takes the troll captain by the throat and pushes him into the tree. Malfurion growls as the troll captain whimphers.''
:{{text|bossemote|Malfurion|Tell her...we are coming.}}
: ''Malfurion throws the troll captain into the ground as he runs away. Malfurion went into his Crow form and he and Dori'thur takes to the skies. The sequence shifts back to the present as the troll captain continues.''
:{{text|bossemote|Troll captain|Bwonsamdi...do not take me yet.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Shendruk|He expects us to believe this tale?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Shendruk|No single Night Elf could do all that!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Nathanos|I know one who could.}}
: ''Then, Nathanos, Shendruk, and the troll captain noticed something and Nathanos and Shendruk head out and sees Dori'thur. He stares back at Nathanos before taking off. And we see Malfurion, [[Tyrande Whisperwind]], and the [[Army of the Black Moon]] as Dori'thur lands on Tyrande's left arm as [[Nightsong]] plays. Nathanos stares in rage and Shendruk gears up.''
:{{text|bossemote|Nathanos|We will hold this ground...for the Horde.}}
: ''The sequence shifted into an establishing shot of the burnt Teldrassil as the cutscene ends.''
