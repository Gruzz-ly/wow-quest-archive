# Darkshore storyline

[[File:WorldMap-Darkshore.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]
'''[[Darkshore]]''' is a level {{level|Darkshore}} [[Alliance]] zone in on the west coast of [[Northern Kalimdor]]. Players arrive in [[Lor'danel]] from [[Rut'theran Village]] and push southwards into the zone, until reaching the [[Ashenvale]] border.

The progress of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Darkshore Quests]].

==Lor'danel==
Darkshore is in crisis after the destruction of the Cataclysm wiped the Night Elven city of [[Auberdine]] off the map. Survivors are arriving in nearby Lor'danel, but the Night Elven rescue forces need all the help from players that they can get. At the same time the wildlife of the area is being corrupted by the Satyr [[Zenn Foulhoof]], who Night Elven players met during the [[Teldrassil storyline]]. Together with a friendly Gnome, players end Zenn Foulhoof's mischief forever.
{{Breaking Waves of Change}}

After [[Cerellean Whiteclaw]] is rescued, he and [[Ranger Glynda Nal'Shea]] offer a quest line in which the spirits of the Elves of Darkshore are released:
# [[A Love Eternal]] / [[The Final Flame of Bashal'Aran]]
#* Side quest received at Bashal'Aran: [[Solace for the Highborne]]

After [[Volcor]] is rescued, he sends players to find his bear friend [[Grimclaw]], which leads players to the [[Keeper of the Grove]] Karithus. Karithus heals Grimclaw with the help of players and thanks them by offering them the blessings of either the Moonstalker, the Thistle Bear or the Stag. These blessings last as long as players are within Darkshore and give stat boosts, as well as neutral standing with the beast selected.
{{A Lost Companion}}

After finishing [[The Ritual Bond]], [[Gorbold Steelhand]] offers:
# [[An Ocean Not So Deep]]

==Ruins of Mathystra/Shatterspear Vale==
[[Ranger Glynda Nal'Shea]] sends players north to the [[Ruins of Mathystra]] where Lieutenant Morra Starbreeze is leading Night Elven forces against another threat to their survival - the rising [[Shatterspear Tribe]] of Trolls. Through tactical strikes at the areas needed to power the Shatterspear war effort, players weaken the Shatterspear before striking the final blow in [[Ending the Threat]].
{{The Shatterspear Invaders}}

==Auberdine Refugee Camp==
[[Sentinel Lendra]] discovers a group of refugees from Auberdine trapped near the ruins of the city and sends players to help them. After clearing out the elementals endangering them and eliminating the Shamans controlling those elementals, players can move onward to the center of the destruction in Darkshore.
{{In Aid of the Refugees}}

==Eye of the Vortex==
[[Malfurion Stormrage]] makes his first appearance to many players in the [[Eye of the Vortex]] where he is desperately trying to stop the destruction of the elements. He can't do it alone, however, and he commissions players to find three powerful shamans for him to work with - the Furbolg [[Elder Brownpaw]], the Ancient of War [[Selenn]] and the last Wildkin [[Aroom]]. With the four shamans united, players seek the aid of the Green Dragon [[Thessera]] to defeat the Twilight's Hammer cultists riling up the elements so the shamans can bring peace to the land.
{{Eye of the Vortex quest chain}}

After this chain, get [[Mounting the Offensive]] from Malfurion to proceed to the [[#Grove_of_the_Ancients|Grove of the Ancients]].

==Grove of the Ancients==
With the destruction of Darkshore stagnated for the time being, the Night Elves can focus on purging the remaining cultists of the Twilight's Hammer from the zone. [[Balren of the Claw]] leads this effort and is preparing his war effort. After some surveillance work done by players, it is revealed that the Twilight's Hammer is unearthing the remains of the being [[Soggoth]] - a great minion of the Old Gods slain in the time of the Titans. They mean to revive the creature and use it to destroy Darkshore. To bolster the Night Elven forces, players seek out the Horn of the Ancients in the quest line starting with [[The Slumbering Ancients]] to awaken the ancients of the forest and strike at the Twilight's Hammer. After retrieving the horn from the Naga who stole it, this is done in the quest [[The Battle for Darkshore]] which ends the Twilight's Hammer's reign in the zone once and for all.
{{Grove of the Ancients quest chain}}

From here, the questing experience continues to [[Ashenvale]].

===Optional chains===
[[Kathrena Winterwisp]] starts a quest chain investigating another fel corruption in the zone and purging it with the help of the seeds of life.
{{Consumed}}

[[Foriel Broadleaf]] starts a quest investigating the disappearance of the Blackwood Furbolg, who have been corrupted themselves.
{{Blackwood Furbolg quest chain}}

*[[The Absent-Minded Prospector]]
*[[Swamped Secrets]]
**[[Got Some Flotsam?]]
***[[A New Home]]
