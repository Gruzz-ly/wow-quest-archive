==Objectives==
Place the [[Energized Soothing Totem|Charged Soothing Totem]] at the top of the reef near the [[Blazing Strand]] and protect it until the ritual is complete.
* Ritual of Soothing complete

==Description==
Their fiery spirits are contained in the totem now.  Take it to the top of the jagged reef near the blazing strand and set it on the ground.

The totem's soothing energies will slowly wash over the elementals until their fury simmers down to calm.

You must protect the totem, for fire does not react favorably to the ritual of soothing.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

==Progress==
Is it done, <name>?

==Completion==
We are in your debt, <name>.  Perhaps now, with [[Malfurion Stormrage|Malfurion's]] help, we can save the rest of [[Darkshore]]. 

==Notes==
There is a large elemental "gazebo" with a fire motif floor where you are to set the energized totem down.  Activating the totem starts an event.

:''A series of [[Fire Elemental Remnant]]s appear and flow to the totem to attack it.  As these are defeated, eventually a (much larger) [[Fire Elemental Rager]] appears to disrupt the ritual.''
