==Objectives==
Speak to [[Archaeologist Groff]] at [[Remtravel's Excavation]].

==Description==
Listen, <name>.  We need to learn more about what we're up against.

To the southwest, beyond the [[Master's Glaive]], there is a group of dwarven prospectors who were excavating the nearby ruins.

Perhaps they have uncovered knowledge that is useful to us in this matter.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|500}}
*725 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with {{F|Ironforge}}

==Completion==
Oh, we know a thing or two about this [[Soggoth]].  The question is... do you really want to know? 

==Progression==
{{Grove of the Ancients quest chain}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
