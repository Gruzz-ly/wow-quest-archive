==Objectives==
Report to [[Lieutenant Morra Starbreeze]] at the [[Ruins of Mathystra]].

==Description==
If we didn't have enough on our hands with the land and the elements turning against us, it seems something has riled up the trolls to the northeast, and they've started on a war path. I'm not sure what their aims are, but they've already attacked several of our scouts and have besieged the cultists at the [[Tower of Althalaxx]].

We've sent a contingent of our best Sentinels to counter their attacks. If you would travel northeast to the ruins and join them, I'm certain that they could use the extra hand.

''On accept:''

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||4}}
*680 [[XP]]
*150 reputation with [[Darnassus]]

==Completion==
Glynda sent you to lend a hand, did she? I'm glad she did - I could certainly use the help.

I'm working on our initial plans to start whittling away at their ranks. Please feel free to help Tysha and Balthule in the meantime.
