==Objectives==
Sentinel Lendra at Lor'danel wants you to speak to Priestess Alinya at the Refugee Camp.

==Description==
By Elune!  It appears that many of those we feared dead from the attack on old Auberdine have taken refuge in a camp outside the town ruins.

The cultists at the Twilight Encampment were planning on making quick work of them.  It's a good thing that you successfully attacked their position.

Seek out Priestess Alinya at the Refugee Camp east of old Auberdine and far south of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|0}} (+{{coppercost|150}} at max level)

==Completion==
I thank you for coming to our assistance.  As you can see, the refugees' situation is dire. 

==Notes==
This is the optional breadcrumb quest for the [[Auberdine Refugee Camp]] quests. You can skip it (and the entire Shatterspear Invaders chain) and just pick up the follow-up quests directly at the camp.

To save time, you can use the [[Nightsaber Rider]] near the bridge south of Lor'danel to travel to Bashal'Aran.

==Progression==
