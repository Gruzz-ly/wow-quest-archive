== Objectives ==
[[Gren Tornfur]] at [[Blackwood Hold]] wants you to destroy 8 Jadefire Braziers.
* Jadefire Brazier (8)

== Description ==
The [[satyr]]s of [[Felwood]] have started pouring their hate and corruption into our lands. They have sent [[Sharax the Defiler]] to subdue parts of the forest that we [[Blackwood tribe|Blackwood]] call home.

In addition to poisoning the land, animals, and plants, he has set up Jadefire braziers throughout the village to help extend his control over our people. Destroying the braziers alone won't be enough to stop him, but it will help lessen his influence while you work with [[Elder Brolg]] to free our brothers.

== Rewards ==
