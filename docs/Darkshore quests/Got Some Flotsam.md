==Objectives==
Collect 5 pieces of Salvageable Greymist Wreckage from along the shore and in the water near the [[Remtravel's Excavation|Remtravel Excavation]].
*[[Salvageable Greymist Wreckage]] (5)

==Description==
We can figure this out, <name>. We just need some Dwarven ingenuity. Think, [[Archaeologist Groff|Groffy]], think!

These [[murloc]]s are just looking for a home, right? Let's do something constructive. I mean that literally.

All sorts of debris was washed ashore during the [[Shattering|catastrophe]], and some of the decimated murloc hovels may still be salvageable. Run along the shore here and gather up any building materials fit for a murloc. That's an admittedly low standard.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||10|}}
*675 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Wet enough for ya?

==Completion==
<Archaeologist Groff picks through the wreckage.>

Well, not much here that don't look stepped on, sat on, or soaked in a toilet. But toss some thatch on top and it'll do.

Tell me, <name>, do you consider yourself an architect?
