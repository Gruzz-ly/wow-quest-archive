This breadcrumb quest points to the quest chain involving the [[Eye of the Vortex]].

==Objectives==
Look for [[Malfurion Stormrage]] at the Eye of the Vortex southeast of the Refugee Camp in [[Darkshore]].

==Description==
It was only recently that we heard the news of Malfurion's awakening, mere moments before the [[Cataclysm]] occurred.

As soon as he regained consciousness, he gave a cryptic warning about the land splitting in two if something wasn't done and how all the shockwaves were converging here on Darkshore.

He then reportedly set off for somewhere in this vicinity.  I was sent here to find him, but I've found my hands full helping the refugees.

Perhaps you could look for him to the southeast for us.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|0}} (+{{coppercost|60}} at max level)

==Completion==
There is no time to waste, <class>.  It is taking every ounce of my power to keep Darkshore's entire landmass from being shattered and swept into the ocean... you must listen to me very carefully.
