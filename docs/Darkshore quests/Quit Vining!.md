Free Goblin Harvesters from [[vine]]s.
* [[Goblin Harvester]]s freed (6)

==Description==
This is terrible, <name>! We got harvesters that ain't harvestin'!

We've been busting our rumps chopping down all these [[tree]]s, but someone keeps tangling up our machines in the vines! I ain't going out there with those [[Night elf|night elves]] stalkin' around.

See if you can get in there and free up my equipment!

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have ya freed any of my harvesters from those vines?

==Completion==
Now that's more like it! As soon as the boss gets rid of those night elves, we won't have ourselves a [[lumber]] problem anymore!
