==Objectives==
[[Gershala Nightwhisper]] in [[Auberdine]] wants 8 Corrupt Brain stems.
*[[Corrupted Brain Stem]] (8)

==Description==
Foolish [[blood elf|blood elves]] toil with demonic magic. Have they not witnessed what happened with the [[naga]] and with the [[satyr]]s of [[Kalimdor]]?

I fear that the blood elves will meet a similar [[Wretched|deformation]]. [[Azeroth]] cannot afford to give birth to another vile race of monsters.

I wish to study the brain stems of the satyr and naga so that I might deduce what fate the elves are headed toward. In [[Blackfathom Deeps]], on the coast of [[Ashenvale]], you will find both satyr and naga.

'Tis a long journey, <name>.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Chittering Beetle Clasps
|Worn Prelacy Cape}}
You will also receive: {{cost||45}}

*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Once I have enough samples to study, my true work can begin. With the corrupted brain stems of both the satyr and naga of Blackfathom Deeps I can try to draw a correlation between the mutations.

Perhaps with that gained knowledge we can prevent the blood elves from delving deeper into deformity and evil.

==Completion==
You have traveled far and undoubtedly faced great peril.

Your actions have been selfless. 'Tis for the good of all Azeroth that you help me with my research. I thank you, <name>, for all that you have done.

Now if you'll excuse me I have much work to do....
