==Objectives==
Stop the [[Darkscale Priestess]]es from offering the [[Horn of the Ancients]] to [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] above [[Nazj'vel]].
*Offering to Azshara prevented

==Description==
[[Warlord Wrathspine|The warlord]] said the horn of the ancients was being offered to Azshara above Nazj'vel.

Perhaps it's not too late to save the ancient relic from being destroyed. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ritual Stopper's Slippers
|Strap of the Ancient Horn
|Horn Sounder's Bracers
|Tia's Ring
|Cord of the Ancient Horn
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||16|95}}
* 1,100 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
You've done well, <name>.  Unfortunately the battle is far from over. 

==Notes==
When you kill the 4 priestesses, Queen Azshara will spawn, followed by Malfurion Stormrage.

:{{text|yell|Queen Azshara|Who dares oppose Queen Azshara? You will soon beg for a swift death!}}
:{{text|yell|Malfurion Stormrage|It's over Azshara! You and your naga will return to the bottom of the seas where you belong!}}
:{{text|say|Queen Azshara|Ah... Malfurion Stormrage. I'd hoped to keep you occupied for a little longer. It was my goal to keep you away from Hyjal while my allies attacked. It would seem I have succeeded.}}
:{{text|say|Queen Azshara|I've no need to fight you, for it appears I've already won. You cannot stop our attack on Darkshore and save Hyjal at the same time!}}
:''Queen Azshara leaves and despawns.''
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|She's not lying. Nordrassil is in danger. I must make haste and prepare for Hyjal's defense.}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|It will be up to you to use the Horn of the Ancients and stop Soggoth's return.}}

'''Get the follow-up quest from Malfurion quickly!''' He will despawn after about one minute. The other Malfurion in Darkshore, permanently standing in the Eye of the Vortex, will not offer the next quest; if you miss him here, you will have to wait for the four priestesses to respawn and then kill them again to trigger the Azshara event. Malfurion will have an exclamation mark after he finishes speaking, and you can accept the next quest.
