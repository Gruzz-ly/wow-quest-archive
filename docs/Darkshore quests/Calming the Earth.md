==Objectives==
Kill 8 Enraged Earth Elementals.
*[[Enraged Earth Elemental]] slain (8)

==Description==
I would be neglecting my responsibility if I abandoned my post just now, with so many [[elemental]]s out of control in the ruins.

Let us deal with them first, before we see how we can aid [[Malfurion Stormrage|Malfurion]].  What do you say, small one?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|800}} (+{{coppercost|720}} at max level)

==Progress==
The land is deeply unsettled, <name>.  It'll be years before calm returns to these parts.

==Completion==
It's become clear, <name>.  The elements won't be calm until Malfurion succeeds in returning balance to the land.  Aiding him is, in a way, also fulfilling my task.
