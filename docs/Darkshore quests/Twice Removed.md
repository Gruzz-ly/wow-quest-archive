{{questportrait|Lady Janira.jpg|Lady Janira|The naga seek something valuable within the ruins of [[Darkshore]], but have long since exhausted the hospitality of the [[Night elf|night elves]].  They shall suffer for their trespass.}}
==Objectives==
Use the Petrified Root to raise 6 [[Withered Ent]]s and dispatch the naga leader, [[Lady Janira]].    
*Lady Janira slain
*Withered Ents called (6)
*[[Petrified Root (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
We cannot condone reckless violence - it is not our nature.  However, there are times when the consequences of avoiding battle are too tangible to ignore, as is the case with these [[naga]].

When the earth in the area shattered, a small section of ruins rose to our east.  These ruins once housed those loyal to [[Queen Azshara]], and it seems her kind have returned in search of something.

Take this petrified root.  You can use it on their fallen to raise ents to aid you.  Deal with them and their leader swiftly.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Naga Plate Bracers
|Mossy Boots
|Grass-Stained Stompers
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||5|65}}
*740 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
We have learned the lessons of discretion in the past.  I hope that you can find it within you to trust me when I tell you that there is no hope of establishing any continued relations with the naga.

==Completion==
Thank you, ally.  We shall keep a more vigilant eye should they return.

==Progression==
