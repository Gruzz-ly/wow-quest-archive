==Objectives==
Speak to [[Sentinel Shyela]] at [[Orendil's Retreat]] in [[Ashenvale]].

==Description==
Darkshore may be battered and broken, but thanks to you, we've achieved some amount of safety here. Some amount of peace. We've much rebuilding to do.

You should continue on, friend. Garrosh has pressed the full might of his Horde against us in Ashenvale. They will kill all of us and chop the forest clear if we don't step forward to stop them.

If we are to have any hope of not losing those forests entirely, we'll need your help. Follow the road to the south and find Sentinel Shyela.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3}}
*390 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
Good to see a new face around here!

The forest crawls with Horde, but my assignment requires that I keep this outpost safe. I could really use someone who might be up for a good fight.

==Notes==
The closest flight point to the retreat is at [[Blackfathom Camp]], directly west toward the shore.
