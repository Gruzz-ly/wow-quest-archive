==Objectives==
Speak with [[Elder Brolg]] at [[Blackwood Hold]].

==Description==
Our ancestors lived alongside the [[Blackwood tribe|Blackwood]] [[furbolg]]s for generations. But recently, we have lost contact with their settlements deeper in the forest. One of their larger villages, Blackwood Hold, can be found to the south.

Travel there and find Elder Brolg. Ask him why his people have withdrawn from us and offer your help, if necessary.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Why have you come here, outsider?

<You tell the elder that you were sent by [[Foriel Broadleaf]] at the [[Grove of the Ancients]]. He seems to relax slightly.>

The elf is right. The forces of [[Felwood]] have seeped into [[Darkshore]] and sickened my people.
