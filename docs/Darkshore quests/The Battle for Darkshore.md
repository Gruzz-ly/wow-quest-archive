'''The Battle for Darkshore''' completes the Grove of the Ancients quest chain, in which the druids of the [[Grove of the Ancients]] enlist Alliance adventurers' aid to bring to an end the [[Twilight's Hammer]] activity at the [[Master's Glaive]] in [[Darkshore]].

==Objectives==
Slay the Avatar of Soggoth at the [[Master's Glaive]].
*[[Avatar of Soggoth]] slain
*[[Horn of the Ancients]] (provided)

==Description==
The ancients of the grove have come to our aid, <name>. I can see through their eyes even as we speak.

The [[Twilight's Hammer]] has been forced to hasten their ritual and have thus only managed to resurrect but a remnant of dread [[Soggoth]].

Destroy it before it's too late, <name>. I am needed elsewhere.

Return to the druids at the [[Grove of the Ancients]] when it is all over they will direct you further. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bracers of the Ancient Grove
|Darkshore Warder's Shield
|Armguards of the Ancient Grove
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||16|95}}
* 1,100 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

== Progress ==
It is good to see you again, <name>.

==Completion==
We can finally rest here now, <name>.  It appears [[Darkshore]] has been saved -- and we have you to thank for it. 

==Notes==
*When the player returns to the Master's Glaive, the area is now overrun with [[Spawn of Soggoth]] battling with [[Awakened Ancient]]s. [[Avatar of Soggoth]] stands in the center of the pit.
*Targeting the Avatar and using the horn will summon [[Greater Awakened Ancient]]s:
:{{text|yell|Greater Awakened Ancient|You do not belong in this world, foul being! Suffer the wrath of nature!}}
:{{text|yell|Avatar of Soggoth|I will devour your souls, insolent mortals!}}

==Progression==
{{Grove of the Ancients quest chain}}
