==Objectives==
Use [[Aetherion's Ritual Orb]] and obtain Aetherion's Essence.
*[[Aetherion's Essence]]

==Description==
[[Aetherion]] is almost in our world, but he can still be dealt with!

At the end of the dock floats a ritual orb. I want you to use it to complete the ritual, beckoning the elemental lord down from his vortex.

Trust me, <name>, I and the other spirits that you have freed will greatly weaken Aetherion. However, it will be up to you to finish him off for good and save the [[Kaldorei]] people of [[Darkshore]] from utter destruction.

Deliver his essence to [[Corvine Moonrise]] at the refugee camp so he will know.

("Aetherion: Get his essence!")

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Aetherion Imbued Vest
|Auberdine Platemail
|Auberdine Ringmail Tunic
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||11|30}}
* 930 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
You have returned. What news do you bring? 

==Completion==
Yalda? The spirits of others from the Ruins of Auberdine?

<The druid ponders what you've conveyed about your adventure in the ruins.>

I remember them all. They will be dearly missed, but they have moved on into the Goddess's embrace and that is for the best.

Ande'thoras-ethil, may your troubles be diminished, <name>!
