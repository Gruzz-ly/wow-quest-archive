==Objectives==
Slay [[Vindictive Sentinel]]s and [[Vindictive Archer|Archers]] and command [[Brynja]] to raise them as [[dark ranger|Dark Rangers]].
* Dark Rangers raised (6)

==Description==
These [[night elf]] ambushes have left us undermanned. We need reinforcements if we are to hold [[Darkshore]].

Brynja, one of the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Dark Lady]]'s [[val'kyr]], can provide us with those reinforcements. Slay the night elves and command her to raise them into our service. Should any prove unwilling... deal with them.

Did I not make myself clear? Go. The Dark Lady has plans for these dark rangers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
*6,800 [[XP]]
*[[Dark Ranger's Spare Cowl]]

==Progress==
Have you bolstered our ranks with new dark rangers?

==Completion==
How quickly they turn against their own [[Elune|goddess]].

==Notes==
;Accept
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|When the night elves lie dead at your feet, call on Brynja to raise them.}}
:''The player becomes {{Abilities|hunted|id=284586|icon=ability_racial_shadowmeld}}.''

Use the Command Brynja extra action button on fallen elves to summon Brynja. Sometimes [[Angry Wisp]]s emerge from the bodies. If the slain night elf does not desire to be raised again, [[Brynja]] will say:
:{{Text|say|Brynja|There are no willing souls nearby.}}
When you raise a [[Kaldorei Dark Ranger|kaldorei dark ranger]], Brynja will say:
*{{Text|say|Brynja|Not even death can stop you now.}}
*{{Text|say|Brynja|Rise, and serve once again.}}
*{{Text|say|Brynja|Death calls you home.}}
*{{Text|say|Brynja|You have been given another chance.}}

If the [[Lost Wisp]] is following you and Brynja is summoned, she will say:
:{{Text|say|Brynja|It appears this lost soul wishes to follow you. Perhaps we should bring it back to Nathanos.}}

==Progression==
{{Darkshore Horde}}
