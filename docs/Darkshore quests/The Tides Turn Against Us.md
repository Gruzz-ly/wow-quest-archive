==Objectives==
Slay 8 Darkscale Myrmidons.
*[[Darkscale Myrmidon]] slain (8)

==Description==
We cannot let the [[naga]] get away with this, <name>. Slaying [[Aros|the keeper of the grove]] amounts to a declaration of war.

You'll find their den inside a cave on the island of [[Naj'vel]], far to the southwest.

I want you to send them a clear message.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Scaling Knife|Grove Keeper's Branch|Felros' Signet}}

You will also receive:
*{{coppercost|1200}} 
*1,550 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
You return, <name>. What news do you bring?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>.  The naga seek the destruction and subjugation of all surface-dwellers -- do not hesitate to drive them out of our lands and back into the shadowy ocean depths where they belong.

==Notes==
*This is an optional companion quest to [[The Darkscale Warlord]]. Both quests send the player to [[Naj'vel]].
