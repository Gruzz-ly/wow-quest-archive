==Objectives==
{{questportrait|High Cultist Azerynn.png|High Cultist Azerynn|His death means a great deal to us.}}
Slay [[High Cultist Azerynn]] and 10 [[Twilight Fanatic]]s in the [[Twilight Encampment]].
* High Cultist Azerynn slain
* Twilight Fanatic slain (10)

==Description==
A group of [[Twilight's Hammer]] cultists has set up camp southwest of here.  They're preparing an army of water elementals to use against [[Lor'danel]].

Their leader, High Cultist Azerynn, has pacts with the dark [[Old Gods]] that grant his sect power over the elements.  Go and deal with them before it's too late, <name>.

The cataclysm has left the elemental spirits in disarray... it's only a matter of time until they have enough elementals to overcome our defenses.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Gloves of the Plate Fist
|Fanatical Treads
|Lendra's Cult-Stompers
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
It's good to see you again, <name>.

==Completion==
You've done well, <name>.  The Twilight's Hammer is a dangerous cult.  It would be foolish to underestimate the danger they represent.
