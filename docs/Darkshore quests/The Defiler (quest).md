'''The Defiler''' completes the quest chain at [[Blackwood Hold]] in [[Darkshore]], in which Alliance players help [[Elder Brolg]] cleanse his [[furbolg]] tribe of the corruption from [[Felwood]] [[satyr]]s.

[[Elder Brolg]] at [[Blackwood Hold]] wants you to kill Sharax the Defiler.

== Description ==
The [[Jadefire]] [[satyr]]s of [[Felwood]] have found their way into [[Darkshore]], tainting the land, water, and creatures they encounter. You've seen what their corruption has done to my people and their homes. If we do not turn back the satyrs, all of us will share that fate.

Within the cave to the east is [[Sharax the Defiler]], the satyr responsible for the ills of the [[Blackwood tribe|Blackwood]]. Slay him, <name>, and free us from his influence. Show the satyr that the Blackwood will not lay down and die so easily.
