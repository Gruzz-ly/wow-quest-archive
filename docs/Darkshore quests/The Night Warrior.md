==Objectives==
Speak with the [[Lost Wisp]] to find out why the moon turned dark.
* Lost Wisp's Memory seen

==Description==
It appears these [[night elf|night elves]] won't give up the information easily... but perhaps that [[wisp]] you captured will.

See if you can get it to reveal what happened here. I don't care how you do it.

[[Father Norlath]] will handle the wisp from there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you made that wisp cooperate?

==Completion==
This is unsettling. We will have to accelerate our plans.

==Notes==
[[Father Norlath]] starts subduing the [[Lost Wisp]].

;Talk to Lost Wisp
:The wisp appears to be trembling.
