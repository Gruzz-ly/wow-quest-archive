==Objectives==
Beat information out of Lieutenants Golras, Ivyth and Maliyra.
* [[Lieutenant Golras]] interrogated
* [[Lieutenant Ivyth]] interrogated
* [[Lieutenant Maliyra]] interrogated

==Description==
[[Darkshore]] has never been known for being bright and sunny, but something strange has happened here. A black moon hangs over everything.

None of the scouts I sent into the forest have returned. The [[night elf|night elves]] are up to something. And I need to know what it is.

Their rank-and-file won't have the information we seek. Hunt down their lieutenants and get them to talk by any means necessary.

==Progress==
<The wisp appears lost and disoriented. It follows you.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The wisp bobs up and down, as if in a daze.>

==Notes==
