==Objectives==
Ride Thessera to defeat 12 Twilight Riders and destroy the Twilight Portal.
*[[Twilight Portal]] slain
*[[Twilight Rider]] slain (12)

==Description==
Twilight riders circle the skies above the vortex. I fear it is their magic that has kept the cataclysmic forces from being contained by our efforts.

Take to the skies with Thessera and destroy the riders and the portal from whence they came.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Portal Closer's Hammer|Emerald Vest}}
You will also receive:
*{{coppercost|900}}
*1250 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Is it done, <name>?  I fear I cannot hold for much longer.

==Completion==
We are turning the tides, <name>.  We should be able to contain further damage.

Much work still remains to be done.
