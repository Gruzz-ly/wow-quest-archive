==Objectives==
Kill 10 of any combination of [[Greymist Oracle]]s or [[Greymist Refugee]]s squatting within [[Remtravel's Excavation]].
*Murloc Squatters Killed (10)

==Description==
The big beards at [[Ironforge]] sent me here to check on [[Remtravel's Excavation|Remtravel's dig]] the moment they got word of the disaster. Look at it! Precious artifacts washed to sea, months of tedious digging undone in a moment.

When the tidal waves hit, they demolished the [[murloc]] encampments along the shore. Good news? Naw, not with my luck. The survivors are squatting in the shelter of the ruins, and they're doing more damage than the elements ever could. Would you mind getting your waders on and taking care of things?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||10|}}
*1350 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hear a lot of gurgling down there. What's going on?

==Completion==
Bravo, <name>! Now let's take a look-see at our new situation.

What? MORE murlocs? I swear on my stones, the more murlocs you kill, the more murlocs appear. Is it just me? We're going to need a new approach.
