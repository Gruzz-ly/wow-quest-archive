==Objectives==
Return to [[Balren of the Claw]] at the Grove of the Ancients in [[Darkshore]].

==Description==
The creature appears to have had its skull broken in a fight with Aros. It looks like what you've heard described as a naga before.

It is said that despite their monstrous features, naga are night elves warped by the arcane magic of Queen Azshara.

It seems they've decided to stop you from obtaining the horn of the ancients.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||5}}
*730 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Completion==
The naga are in league with the Twilight's Hammer?  Just what we needed.

==Progression==
{{Grove of the Ancients quest chain}}
