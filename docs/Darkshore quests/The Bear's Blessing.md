==Objectives==
[[Elder Brolg]] at [[Blackwood Hold]] wants you to bring him the Blessed Herb Bundle.
*[[Blessed Herb Bundle]]
*[[Bear's Paw Bundle]] (provided)

==Description==
Before the bear's paw can be used to cleanse the afflicted, it must be completed and blessed. To the north of the village roams a tallstrider named [[Fleetfoot]]. You'll need its [[Fleetfoot's Tailfeathers|tailfeathers]] to complete the herb bundle.

Bring the tailfeathers and the bear's paw bundle to the ancient bear statue in the ruins around the Grove of the Ancient, further north of where you'll find Fleetfoot.

While at the shrine, combine the tailfeathers with the bear's paw and receive the bear spirit's blessing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|1100}} (or {{coppercost|900}} at max level)
*1450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you visited the old bear statue?

==Completion==
<Elder Brolg accepts the blessed bundle from you and looks over it.>

This is exactly what we needed. The bear's spirit favors us and there may be hope for my brothers after all.

==Notes==
The bear statue is at {{co|45|77|Darkshore}} behind a couple of trees just south of the main part of the [[Grove of the Ancients]].
