==Objectives==
Test the Lifebringer Sapling on any nearby healthy [[Grizzled Thistle Bear]], [[Whitetail Stag]], or [[Moonstalker Matriarch]]/[[Moonstalker Sire|Sire]].
*[[Lifebringer Sapling]] Tested
*[[Lifebringer Sapling]] (provided)

==Description==
Are you familiar with the [[Old God|Old Ones]], <name>? [[Onu]] and I agree that the artifact you found in the lake can only be their work, and it's devouring [[Darkshore]]. Something is stirring up terrors we thought dead long ago. This is bigger than you or me, but my first concern is protecting the wildlife.

Here, this sapling contains the life essence you gathered for me. I believe it can protect the local fauna. Test it out on a nearby un-consumed bear, stag, or moonstalker, and let me know what happens! 

==Rewards==
You will receive {{cost||7}}.

==Progress==
The sapling you carry grows in power even as we speak. Life is regenerative, <name>. Did it work? 

==Completion==
Interesting ... It sounds like our cure will keep the wildlife safe, but you say you saw something else? Some kind of angry presence?

This is a good sign, <name>. Whatever is behind this isn't happy, and that means we're on to something. 

==Gains==
*1000 [[XP]]

==Notes==
Target one of the valid Darkshore wildlife and Use the sapling to protect it. The player will see the emote
:{{text|emote|<target> is now protected from the consumption.}}

Also, a shadowy apparition will briefly appear in the form of a [[faceless one]].

==Progression==
{{Consumed}}
