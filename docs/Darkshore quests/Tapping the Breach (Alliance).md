==Objectives==
Defeat 20 Twilight elementalists in [[Darkshore]].
* Twilight elementalist slain  (20)

==Description==
We had thought the [[Twilight's Hammer]]'s presence in Darkshore was snuffed out with the defeat of [[Deathwing]]. Apparently, we were mistaken.

Remnants of their cult have used the conflict in Darkshore as an opportunity to re-establish their presence here. Darkshore is home to several breaches of elemental power, and it looks like they aim to use these to unleash powerful elementals to devastate the land.

This must not stand.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]
*[[Glowing Azerite]] (300x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Have you stopped the cultists' rituals, <name>?

==Completion==
You have saved countless lives today. For this I am greatful{{sic}}.

Still, I'm afraid this won't be the last we will see of the Twilight's Hammer. We must be ever vigilant.

==Progression==
