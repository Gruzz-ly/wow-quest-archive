==Objectives==
Find the body of [[Delaryn Summermoon]].
* Signal [[Nathanos Blightcaller|Nathanos]] at Delaryn's [[Corpse]]
* [[Sira Moonwarden]] defeated
* Sira's Fate decided (1)

==Description==
We must carry out the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Dark Lady]]'s orders before we are overrun by these [[Night elf|newly-invigorated elves]].

There is one night elf in particular that we seek. You may remember her from our [[War of the Thorns|last venture]] into [[Darkshore]]. Lucky for you, she is already dead... so she should prove less troublesome than the living ones you've already encountered.

Signal me when you find her corpse.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found her yet?

==Completion==
I sent you to find one dead night elf. It would appear you have outdone yourself.

==Notes==
;Accept
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|There is one more asset to acquire. One who resisted... and failed. The Dark Lady was very... specific in her wishes.}}

Head to [[Delaryn's Demise]]. At Delaryn's corpse, use the Signal Nathanos extra action button.

;Sira attacks
:{{Text|say|Sira Moonwarden|This is where it ends. You have nowhere else to run.}}
:{{Text|say|Sira Moonwarden|Ash'al theradas!}}
:{{Text|say|Sira Moonwarden|Spare me the trouble and die!}}
:{{Text|say|Sira Moonwarden|Soon she will be here, and she will tear you to pieces.}}

In case you fail, click on Delaryn's body to spawn Sira again:
:{{Gossip|<Face Sira Moonwarden.>}}

;Sira is defeated
:''Sira kneels.''
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|My my, look what we have here. The hunter has become the prey. It's almost a cliche, when you think about it.}}
:{{Text|say|Sira Moonwarden|No! This... this was not...}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|What are you waiting for? Finish her.}}

You can decide whether you will finish Sira or refuse to do so, leaving Nathanos to kill the warden.

Talk to [[Sira Moonwarden]].
:They... they didn't come.
:{{Gossip|[Kill Sira] I'll take care of it.}}
Talk to [[Nathanos Blightcaller]].
:Get on with it.
:{{Gossip|[Spare Sira] I won't do it.}}
''If player chooses not to kill Sira:''
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|I knew you didn't have it in you.}}
:''Sira Moonwarden dies.''
:{{Text|say|Sira Moonwarden|Where... is she...?}}
