Destroy 4 [[Buzzbox]]es in [[Darkshore]].
* Buzzbox destroyed (4)
* [[Buzzbox 854]]
* [[Buzzbox 111]]
* [[Buzzbox 627]]
* [[Buzzbox 456]]

==Description==
Some [[gnome]]'s been goin about planting these strange machines in the woods here. I don't know what they do, but I'll be dead before I let gnomish machines sully [[goblin]] territory!

Find these "buzzboxes" and reduce them to scrap. I'll make sure you're compensated for your troubles.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|q1=200|War Resources

==Progress==
Did you take care of our gnomish problem?

==Completion==
Thanks for the assist there, pal.

If you ask me, the only place [[gnomish technology]] belongs is the scrap heap!
