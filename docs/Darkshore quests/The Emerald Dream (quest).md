'''The Emerald Dream''' is part of the [[Eye of the Vortex]] quest chain.

==Objectives==
Step through the Nightmare Portal in the Earthshatter Cavern and speak to Thessera.

==Description==
Our efforts in containing the destruction don't appear to be quite enough. I fear we're going to need aid from beyond the waking world.

Twilight cultists inside the Earthshatter Cavern to the east have opened a gateway to a nightmare-infested section of the Emerald Dream. They hold a green dragon prisoner named Thessera there.

Go through the nightmare portal and free her. She will be a powerful ally.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Malfurion calls?  Yes... I can hear his voice through the dream...

==Progression==
