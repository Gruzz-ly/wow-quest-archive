'''Timely Arrival''' is a quest to escort [[Sentinel Aynasha]] to the dock of [[Shatterspear War Camp]] in [[Darkshore]].  It becomes available by killing [[Rit'ko]] for [[One Bitter Wish]], then looting the [[Shatterspear Torturer's Cage Key]] from him to open the Shatterspear Cage holding Aynasha.

However, the cage is bugged and will remain open if the quest fails.  Aynasha will not offer the quest if you can't interact with the cage, and the only solution is to wait for dailies to reset.

Another solution would be to use the [[Group Finder]] to look for a server where the cage is closed. This quest can be accepted while in a [[raid]].

==Objectives==
Escort Sentinel Aynasha to safety.
*Escort Sentinel Aynasha to the Dock

==Description==
It's good to see you. I wasn't looking forward to enduring what [[Alanndarian Nightsong|Alanndarian]] did, so the rescue is somewhat welcome.

I saw the troll leader before I was captured, and thought I had the perfect opportunity to kill him, but he's protected by some sort of magic shield.  [[Lieutenant Morra Starbreeze|Morra]] needs to know before she mounts her assault, but first, we need to get out of here.

Help me to the dock - I'll make my way to [[Lor'danel]] via water, and you can go back to Morra with the intel.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Aynasha's Spare Sword
|Morra's Gloves
|Starbreeze Gauntlets
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||5|65}}
*740 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
News from Aynasha?

==Completion==
Some sort of shield you say?  We might have a way around that.  [[Balthule Shadowstrike|Balthule]] had an idea for breaking whatever protective enchantments their shaman had, so it might work on this too.  Thank you for saving Aynasha and bringing me this information - it may well make the difference in our battle.
