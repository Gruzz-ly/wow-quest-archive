==Completion==
The heavens, in their countless stars, hold answers to earthly mysteries, <name>.  Might, then, the wise, and the lucky, gaze up and find truth?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Coin of Ancestry]]

==Notes==
Elder Starweave is located just West of [[Lor'danel]] in [[Darkshore]]. Before the [[Shattering]], she resided in [[Auberdine]] as her title in the achievement [[Elders of Kalimdor]] would suggest. This Elder, like all of the others, is illuminated by a shaft of light from the sky. This Elder gives the location of [[Elder Bladeswift]].
