==Objectives==
Return to [[Malfurion Stormrage]] at the [[Eye of the Vortex]].

==Description==
It won't be immediate, but the elementals' anger will soon die down and my people will live to fight another day.

I will go help you and Malfurion in any way that I can.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|0}} (+{{coppercost|150}} at max level)

==Completion==
This is fortunate news, <name>.  The [[furbolg]] may seem little more than a savage race, but their ties to the land are ancient and their shamans are second to none. 

== Notes ==
Upon completing this quest, [[Elder Brownpaw]] appears nearby.

==Progression==
{{Eye of the Vortex quest chain}}
