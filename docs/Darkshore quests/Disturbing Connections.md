== Objectives ==
Bring the Hellscream's Missive to Ranger Glynda Nal'Shea at Lor'danel. 
* [[Hellscream's Missive]] (provided)

== Description ==
The letter from Garrosh Hellscream makes clear the suspicions that were raised during the offensive on the Shatterspear. The presence of forsaken at the tower ruins and horde supplies and enforcers at the Shatterspear War Camp were only the start. Garrosh himself contacted the Shatterspear to spur their offensive towards Lor'danel, and it seems clear that he fully intends to push from the south as well.

Glynda Nal'Shea will need this information if the night elves are to be prepared.

==Rewards==

* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
You're back! I hear the battle went well. 

==Completion==
Well, this news is disturbing indeed. I will start dispatching messengers to Ashenvale immediately and see if we can't get some reinforcements prepared for them.

I cannot thank you enough for all the help you've lent us in these trying times. Such heroic deeds deserve reward. I think I might have something that will serve you perfectly.
