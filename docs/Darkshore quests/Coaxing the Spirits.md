==Objectives==
Coax the spirits from Thundris Windweaver, Elissa Starbreeze, Taldan, and Caylais Moonfeather.
* [[Thundris Windweaver]]'s spirit coaxed
* [[Sentinel Elissa Starbreeze]]'s spirit coaxed 
* [[Taldan]]'s spirit coaxed
* [[Caylais Moonfeather]]'s spirit coaxed

==Description==
Your friends back at the refugee camp are unaware of the true and imminent danger that the [[Twilight's Hammer]] cultists have already brought into the world.

For you to deal with that, we'll first need to get some help from the dead of [[Ruins of Auberdine|Auberdine]].

Search through the ruins of the town and find the corpses of Thundris Windweaver, Elissa Starbreeze, Taldan, and Caylais Moonfeather.  Coax the spirits from their bodies and then return with them to me here.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|0}} (+{{coppercost|660}} at max level)

==Progress==
I sense that you have not quite coaxed each of the spirits of the four I sent you after.  Return when you have, and <name>, hurry.  We are almost out of time!

==Completion==
So much death and pain.  Can there be any doubt that there is more yet to come?

All I wish to do is move onward into the Goddess's embrace as do these others.

But first, let us see if we can keep even more misery and destruction from being spread.

'''Caylais Moonfeather''' {{coords|38|43|Darkshore}}
:Far too powerful for these elementals, Caylais and her [[Enraged Hippogryph|hippogryphs]] must have been struck down by something else.
