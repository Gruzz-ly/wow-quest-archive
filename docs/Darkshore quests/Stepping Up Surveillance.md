==Objectives==
Sneak into the [[Master's Glaive]] using the Panther Figurine and spy on the Twilight's Hammer leaders on the platform above.
*Master's Glaive surveillance
*[[Panther Figurine]] (provided)

==Description==
The cultists appear to be digging out the remains of a being known as [[Soggoth the Slitherer]].

Perhaps their superiors on the rafters above have more information.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you completed your scouting mission, <name>?

==Completion==
This is dire news, <name>.  If you are correct, then we'd best act swiftly and decisively.

We cannot allow this "Soggoth" to be brought back to life.

==Notes==
Prowl up the ramp that encircles Soggoth's corpse:
:{{text|say|[[Doomspeaker Trevellion]]|Our men are almost finished unearthing great Soggoth. Is the ritual ready?}}
:{{text|say|[[Thalya the Voidcaller]]|Not quite. We shall need a great many offerings of sacrifice before the Herald of the Old Gods roams the land again.}}
:{{text|say|Doomspeaker Trevellion|Do not worry. Like I said, our men are almost done unearthing the Slithering One. They will make for a suitable -- and even voluntary -- sacrifice. Soggoth will rise!}}
