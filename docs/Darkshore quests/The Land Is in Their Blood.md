==Objectives==
Speak to [[Elder Brownpaw]] at the [[Blackwood Camp]] southwest of the [[Eye of the Vortex]].

==Description==
If we're to stabilize the forces of nature, we'll need every little bit of help we can get.  The [[furbolg]] of the [[Blackwood tribe]] have long inhabited the area and have strong ties to the land.

Their elder Shaman, Elder Brownpaw, wields great power over the elements—his assistance would be invaluable.  See if you can obtain their aid.

==Completion==
I have much respect for the great [[Malfurion Stormrage]].  I cannot, however, leave my people in their time of need.  Maybe there is a way we can both help each other.
