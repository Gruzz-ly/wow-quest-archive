==Objectives==
Defeat 20 Twilight elementalists in [[Darkshore]].
* Twilight elementalist slain (20)

==Description==
Darkshore is home to several elemental breaches which hold massive amounts of power. 

The remnants of the [[Twilight's Hammer]] know this. While we were preoccupied with the [[Kaldorei]], their elementalists have moved to exploit these locations of power, calling forth massive elementals to do their bidding.

Their actions must no go unchecked.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]
*[[Glowing Azerite]] (300x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
What of the cultist threat?

==Completion==
These cultists simply don't know when to give up, do they? I hope this is the last we see of them.

Well done, <class>.
