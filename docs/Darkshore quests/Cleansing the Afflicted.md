==Objectives==
[[Elder Brolg]] wants you to use the Blessed Herb Bundle to cleanse 7 [[furbolg]] of [[Blackwood Hold]] and kill the [[Spirit of Corruption|Spirits of Corruption]] driving them mad.
* Blackwood Furbolg Cleansed (7)
* [[Blessed Herb Bundle (2)]] (provided)

==Description==
With the sacred herbs and the bear's blessing, you must use this herb bundle to cleanse my brothers. The corruption spilling over from [[Felwood]] has driven them mad and they will attack any who come near. Expect the afflicted Blackwood to be angry with you until you have slain the spirits of corruption that haunt them.

When you have freed my brothers from their madness, return to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||11|}}
*1450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have your efforts and the bear's blessing cleansed my brothers?

==Completion==
You have done well. My people have begun to emerge from their madness, but they will fall back into it if we do not deal with the source of the corruption.

==Notes==
Both the [[Maddened Blackwood]] and [[Corrupted Blackwood]] of [[Blackwood Hold]] are valid targets. Target a furbolg and Use the bundle -- this will aggro the furbolg and create a Spirit of Corruption. Focus your attacks to slay the Spirit of Corruption. When the Spirit is killed, the furbolg will turn {{rep|friendly}} and say:
:{{text|say|Thank you for saving me, stranger.}}

==Progression==
