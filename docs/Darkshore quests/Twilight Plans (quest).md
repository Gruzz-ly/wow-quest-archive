==Objectives==
Obtain 6 [[Twilight Plans]] at the [[Twilight Encampment]].

* Twilight Plans (6)

==Description==
We're not fully aware of the intentions of the [[Twilight's Hammer]] cultists to the southwest.  We fear an attack on [[Lor'danel]], however their motives might go well beyond that.

I need you to go to the Twilight Encampment and get your hands on their plans.  Hurry, <name>.  We might not have much time.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|600}} (+{{coppercost|540}} at max level)

==Progress==
Have you obtained the plans yet, <name>? 

==Completion==
Excellent job, <name>.  Now give me a moment to examine the plans you've brought me. 

==Notes==
* Despite the capitalization, there is no subzone of Darkshore actually named "Twilight Encampment".

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
