==Objectives==
Use the Soothing Totem to absorb the remains of 8 Unbound Fire Elementals.
* [[Unbound Fire Elemental]] absorbed (8)
* [[Soothing Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
With most of our brethren losing their way to madness or corruption, it would seem that we have little choice but to ally with you, <race>.  You can count on our aid... once you've proven we can count on yours.

As you can see, my people are having a bit of a problem with the fire elementals.  Help fight them and use this totem on their fiery remains.

We will return them to where they belong... whether they like it or not.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Scorched Shield]]
* [[Singed Boots (level 15)]]
You will also receive: {{cost||7}}

==Progress==
Is it done yet, <name>?

==Completion==
The element of fire is unique in that attacking it indiscriminately can often lead it to spreading further... succeeding only in agitating its flames.

We are wiser than that, <name>.  We are going to dispose of it properly.
