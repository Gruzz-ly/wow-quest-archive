==Objectives==
Breathe in the [[Grovekeeper's Incense|incense]] in front of Keeper Karithus, and then choose the blessing of the Great Stag Spirit, the Great Thistle Bear Spirit, or the Great Moonstalker Spirit.

Keep in mind that you can only receive the blessing of one spirit, so choose wisely.

==Description==
I will tend to Grimclaw until his rest is done - he will be ready to return very soon. I have one more task for you while we wait... a favor to grant you, really, should you recognize it.

The great wildlife spirits roam around us waiting and hoping for someone that will aid in stopping the destruction. They are with us as we speak even now, and with the materials  you brought me, I can grant you sight. Speak to these spirits, choose one, and return to me with their blessing.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Moonstalker Bracers
|Thistle Bear Girdle
|Cloak of the Stag
|Moonstalker Wristwraps
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
The great spirits have been here longer than I can remember. They were once mortal animals if all the stories are true, and they died in time of dire fates.

==Completion==
So it is done. You have received the blessing of a great animal spirit, and I shall now complete the ritual for you. Please stand still.

==Notes==
: The strong odor coming from the bowl smells like a mixture of various herbs with burning hair.
