'''A New Home''' completes the quest chain in which [[Archaeologist Groff]] attempts to rid [[Remtravel's Excavation]] of murloc refugees by building them a new hovel to live in.

==Objectives==
Build a murloc hovel at a site [[Archaeologist Groff|Groff]] marked with a flag on the nearby shore.
*Greymist Murloc Home Built
*[[Marvelous Mobile Murloc Manor Maker]] (provided)

==Description==
Can we build it? Yes we can! Just west of the dig site I planted a banner on the shore. The sand is firm and it's as good a site as any. Take my tools and the parts you collected and build these ornery pests a different place to live.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Groff's Tarpaulin
|Hovel Digger Bands
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||10|}}
*1350 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How goes our new seaside condo?

==Completion==
Har har, that sounds like quite a heap you built there. Did they take to it? Good, good! Let's see if my plan comes to fruition.

<Archaeologist Groff watches as scores of murlocs stream down the beach, pouring into the hovel from all corners of the compass. Gradually his brows knit together.>

What have I done?

==Notes==
*Groff's banner is located at {{coords|35|81|Darkshore}}.
*Use the Manor Maker at the banner to construct a hovel. Swarms of {{rep|friendly}} [[Happy Greymist Murloc]]s will descend on the hovel; some of them dancing.
