==Objectives==
Protect [[Sentinel Aynasha]], then speak with [[Sentinel Onaeya|Onaeya]] at [[Maestra's Post]] in [[Ashenvale]].
*Protect Aynasha

==Description==
I was traveling to [[Lor'danel]] with an important message when I was attacked by the [[furbolg]] [[Marosh the Devious|Marosh]] and his trackers. During the attack I was poisoned, leaving me barely able to stand. I can make an antidote, but it will take time before it is ready.

I would ask that you defend me until I can apply the antidote. I will aid you with my bow as best I can.

Should we survive, I will be able to deliver my message to Lor'danel, while you speak with Onaeya at Maestra's Post to inform her of this incident.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||14|}}
*3,170 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
You bring most welcome news <class>. It is good to hear that Aynasha is alive and well thanks to you. I would hope that you might accept a reward for your valor. May [[Elune]] watch over you and light your path.

==Notes==
This is a "Guard the NPC quest"... like an [[:Category:Escort quests|escort quest]] but without all the tedious moving around. [[Marosh the Devious]] will spawn during the last wave.

A scripted event starts upon accepting the quest:
:{{text|say|Sentinel Aynasha|Wait... did you hear that? Something approaches from the west!}}
:''A number of furbolgs approach.  Aynasha starts shooting.''
:{{text|say|Sentinel Aynasha|I've run out of arrows! I'm afraid if any more come you will need to take them on by yourself my friend.}}
:''When all the furbolgs are dead (and assuming Aynasha lives)''...
:{{text|say|Sentinel Aynasha|Praise Elune! I don't know if I could have survived the day without you, friend.}}
:{{text|say|Sentinel Aynasha|My leg feels much better now, the remedy must be working. If you will excuse me, I must go report to my superiors about what has transpired here.}}
:{{text|say|Sentinel Aynasha|Please speak with Sentinel Onaeya at Maestra's Post in Ashenvale, she will see to it that you are properly rewarded for your bravery this day.}}
