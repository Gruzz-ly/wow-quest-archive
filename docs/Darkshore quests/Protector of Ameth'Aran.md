==Objectives==
Speak to [[Selenn]] at the [[Ameth'Aran|Ruins of Ameth'Aran]].

==Description==
Nothing will repair the land quicker than the strength of those who inhabit it.  We [[Night elf|night elves]] are fortunate that some of our best allies just happen to be both the land and its inhabitants at once.

The [[Ancient of War]] known as Selenn was charged with guarding the ruins of Ameth'Aran, to the south.  Go there and seek his help.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|70}} (+{{coppercost|60}} at max level)

==Completion==
If the great [[Malfurion Stormrage|Malfurion]] requires my presence, it is my duty to heed his call.  It is also my duty to protect these ruins, however.

Perhaps you'll help me fulfill both my obligations, <name>?
