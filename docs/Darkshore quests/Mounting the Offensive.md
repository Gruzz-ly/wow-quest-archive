==Objectives==
Speak to [[Balren of the Claw]] at the [[Grove of the Ancients]] in [[Darkshore]].

==Description==
Our work in Darkshore is not yet done. We might have stopped the landmass from shattering, but our enemies still have a strong presence in the area.

I want you to contact a group of [[druid]]s at the Grove of the Ancients, far to the south. They are led by an old friend of mine, Balren of the Claw.

Tell them that the time has come to take the battle to our foes. I will come to aid them as soon as we stabilize the area.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1}}
*135 [[XP]]

==Completion==
If [[Malfurion]] placed his trust on you, then so shall I.  You'll find that our enemies greatly outnumber us this far south.

Where brute force and numbers fail us, strategy and guile will prove our biggest advantages. 

==Progression==
