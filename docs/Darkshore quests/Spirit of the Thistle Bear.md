==Objectives==
Keeper Karithus has instructed you to receive the blessing of the Great Thistle Bear Spirit.

==Description==
In these woods reside three great spirits, that of the Stag, that of the Thistle Bear, and that of the Moonstalker. These spirits make powerful allies, but you can only align yourself with one of them.

If you wish to align yourself with the Great Thistle Bear Spirit, take this incense to a cave just east of the great whirlpool. Meditate before the great spirit while burning the incense on the ground between you, and face his trial to earn his blessing. Should you succeed, return to me.

==Completion==
For countless ages I have walked these forests and lived in these mountains. Through snow and fire, I have watched civilizations crumble and nature press on. Now, the very earth turns against us, and it becomes very apparent that we must fight if our legacy is to continue.

Your heart is true, and I would choose you as our champion. If you value the thick hide and resilience of my kind, then accept my boon. Know that the other spirits will not accept you once this choice is made, so choose wisely.
