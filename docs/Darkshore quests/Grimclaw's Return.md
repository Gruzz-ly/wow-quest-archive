==Objectives==
Return to [[Volcor]] and [[Grimclaw]] in [[Lor'danel]].

==Description==
With the binding complete, the blessing has taken hold. It will most certainly make your travels in these lands easier.

Grimclaw made a full recovery. Before I could do anything to stop him, he bolted off towards Lor'danel. I suppose that means it's time for your departure.

It was a great pleasure to have met you. For now, farewell - send my best wishes to Volcor and Grimclaw.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||3|50}}
* 680 [[XP]]
* 150 reputation with [[Darnassus]]

==Completion==
You've returned! It is good to see you again. I suppose we have you to thank for Grimclaw's return?

I'm afraid... I have some bad news. I've been unable to purge the toxin... their conditions worsen. Gershalla died shortly after you left, and Volcor... Volcor passed just before you came back.

He lived long enough to see Grimclaw come back safely, so he died with a smile on his face. I'm just sorry that I couldn't do more.

For now, I'm doing everything I can to save Shaldyn, so please excuse me.
