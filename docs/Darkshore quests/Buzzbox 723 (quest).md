==Objectives==
Gather 6 samples of Corrupted Thistle Bear Guts and bring them to [[Buzzbox 723]] for analysis.
*[[Corrupted Thistle Bear Guts]]

==Description==
There are a couple other forms of wildlife that we've verified infected. It's actually good news that the crabs appear to have caught this from the bears - hopefully that means this all stems from one source. We need to focus our attention on those bears now.

Buzzbox 723 is near the waterfalls to the east. It's going to be messy work, but it's necessary - I'll need you to bring some fresh bear guts to that buzzbox for analysis. We'll go from there once I have the information.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|400}} (+{{coppercost|540}} at max level)

==Progress==
<Buzzbox 723 hums at you expectantly.> 

==Completion==
<Static precedes Wizbang's distorted voice.>

The results are coming in now. We should have some information on how the bears contracted this in just a moment.
