==Objectives==
*[[Vile Spray]] slain (8)

==Description==
Some of the [[The Last Wave of Survivors|survivors]] of this last [[Auberdine]] attack are still trying to make it up the coast to safety. We only caught word that they were coming within the last hour. I wish that we had more warning...

The coastline west of us is swarming with vile spray, vicious little [[water elemental]]s. We need to clear them out if any of the survivors are to have a chance of making it to [[Lor'danel]]. Depart immediately and kill every elemental you see.

== Progress ==
Have you cleared the coast?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|350}} (+{{coppercost|510}} at max level)

==Completion==
Your efforts are very much appreciated. Since the Cataclysm, the elementals have been out of control. We have little hope of taking back Auberdine without extinguishing their presence first. 

==Progression==
{{Breaking Waves of Change}}
