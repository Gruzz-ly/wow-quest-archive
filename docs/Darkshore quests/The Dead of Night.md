==Description==
This is the crux of the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Dark Lady]]'s plan for [[Darkshore]]. We will raise new champions for the [[Forsaken]] and the [[Horde]] on this very spot.

Guard the val'kyr. We cannot allow anything or anyone to interrupt them.

You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You made it out. Good.

So did I.

==Notes==
'''Accept'''
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Now that we have the preliminaries out of the way, we can begin the ritual.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Blightcaller!}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Well, this is inconvenient. Protect the val'kyr!}}

Speak with Nathanos to continue.

:{{Gossip|<Stand ready to defend the ritual.>}}

You have to protect [[Brynja]] and [[Signe]] as [[Tyrande Whisperwind]] attacks. Nathanos has the Val'kyr's Boon buff.

:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|You will not see another sunrise, monster.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|How uncouth for the... Queen of the Tree Elves, is it? No, I suppose that won't do... What exactly do you rule over these days?}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|I am no queen. I am the kaldorei's vengeance!}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|You are nothing. Raise them!}}
:{{Text|say|Brynja|Rise! In the name of Sylvanas, the Banshee Queen, I bestow this gift upon you!}}

''After Tyrande is hurt, she gets magically bound by Brynja with Umbral Binding.''
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Enough! Any last words, priestess?}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Soon you will share the faith of your dear friend Sira... and the noble Delaryn. Reunions can be so... heartwarming.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Shal'karath!}}

''Tyrande then escapes her binds and turns everything dark with Veil of Darkness.''
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|You cannot hide from me forever, elf.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|We do not stand alone. Now!}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|What?!}}

''[[Malfurion Stormrage]] joins the fray.''

:{{Text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Your end has come.}}
:{{Text|say|Brynja|We require more time! Finish it, Signe. I will handle this.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|You are too late. Behold!}}

Use the extra action button Break Free to release yourself of Malfurion's Engulfing Roots.

''Sira and Delaryn are then raised as Forsaken.''
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|You must fight the shadow in your hearts, sisters!}}
:{{Text|say|Sira Moonwarden|We placed our faith in you.}}
:{{Text|say|Delaryn Summermoon|And you abandoned us. Elune abandoned us!}}
:{{Text|say|Delaryn Summermoon|We have nothing left. We are forsaken.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Never again. Ash thoribas!}}

''Tyrande then strikes Brynja, killing the Val'kyr.''
:{{Text|say|Brynja|No! Dark Lady... I am... sorry...}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Witch! You shall pay dearly for that. Let's move!}}
:{{Text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|I will hunt them down.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|No. Our forces gather. We will settle this another day.}}
''Nathanos, the new Forsaken, and the player escape on [[Dire Bat (Darkshore)|dire bat]]s. The party alongside [[Signe]] flies to the safety of [[Lor'danel Landing]].''
