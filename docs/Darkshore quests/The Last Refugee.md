:Ohmygosh!  I didn't think that I was ever going to see anyone ever again!

:You have to get me out of here!

Aye, you're the fine <lad/lass> who saved my Hollee!

Well, I've got a fitting reward for you here, I'm sure.  We really can't thank you enough for bringing her to safety, <name>.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{text|say|Archaeologist Hollee|Great!  Let's get out of here.  I don't have a weapon, so I'd really appreciate it if you could... you know... protect me?}}
:{{text|say|Archaeologist Hollee|Let's go.}}

;Upon completion
: ''Hollee makes her way down to the inn's ground floor.''
: {{text|say|Archaeologist Hollee|Time for a very short breather.}}
: ''... but then she spots [[Taldan]]'s corpse.''
: {{text|say|Archaeologist Hollee|Taldan!}}
: ''Hollee runs over to the body and kneels beside it.''
: {{text|say|Archaeologist Hollee|This isn't happening.  Oh no... my friends!}}
: ''Hollee jumps up and takes off at a run, telling you to follow.  So much for your breather.''
: {{text|say|Archaeologist Hollee|Hurry!  We have to check up on them!}}
: ''Help Hollee kill the [[Frenzied Cyclone]]s that she will aggro.  Other than defending herself, she will run all the way.  She stops to overlook where she and the other dwarves in [[Auberdine]] had set up a small smithy area, where new night elves would learn [[mining]], [[blacksmithing]] and [[engineering]].''
: {{text|say|Archaeologist Hollee|It's trashed, but it doesn't look like there are any bodies.}}
: {{text|say|Archaeologist Hollee|Sorry, but I had to check.  Okay, let's get out of here.}}
: ''Hollee runs back the way she came to return to the southwest road out of town and stops at the new eastern stream.''
: {{text|say|Archaeologist Hollee|I'd be dead if it weren't for you.}}
: ''Hollee crosses the stream and on the other side, points out [[Auberdine Refugee Camp]].''
: {{text|say|Archaeologist Hollee|There's the camp!}}
: ''(Turns to you)'' {{text|say|Archaeologist Hollee|I'll race you!}}
: ''At this point, the escort is completed, but follow Hollee into camp for her reunion with [[Elisa Steelhand]].''
: {{text|say|Elisa Steelhand|Hollee!}}
: {{text|say|Archaeologist Hollee|Elisa!  Oh, it's so good to get out of there!  Auberdine is completely overrun with cultists and elementals!}}
: {{text|say|Elisa Steelhand|I know, lass, but you're safe now and with friends.  I thought you were dead!}}
: {{text|say|Archaeologist Hollee|I have a favor to ask.  Could you reward my friend here?  I haven't any coin.  I can pay you back when we get back to [[Ironforge]].}}
: {{text|say|Elisa Steelhand|Of course.  Don't think anything of it.  And I won't hear of you trying to pay me back, either!}}
: {{text|say|Archaeologist Hollee|Oh, thank you, Elisa!  Thank you!}}
: {{text|say|Elisa Steelhand|Anytime, lass.  Anytime.}}
