==Objectives==
Use the moonwell in the Ruins of Auberdine to destroy 8 sets of Frenzied Cyclone Bracers.
* [[Frenzied Cyclone Bracers|Frenzied Cyclone bracers]] destroyed (8)

==Description==
If we're going to take the Ruins of Auberdine back from the Twilight's Hammer, the elementals that they've summoned must be dealt with on a permanent basis.

That's where you come in.

Look, I don't expect you to retake the town, but while we're healing up here, you can soften them up for us.

To permanently deal with the frenzied cyclones, head west, kill them, take their bracers, and put them in the moonwell. That will destroy the bracers and keep those elementals from being resummoned.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Becalmed Bracers
|Very Tranquil Bracers
|Serene Breeze Bracers
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Do you think you could go back to the Ruins of Auberdine and destroy more bracers?

==Completion==
I cannot thank you enough, <name>. Now we'll have a fighting chance to retake the ruins as soon as we are in better health.
