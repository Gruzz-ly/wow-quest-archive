==Objectives==
Repair 4 [[Buzzbox]]es in [[Darkshore]].
* Buzzbox repaired (4)

==Description==
Some nefarious no-goodnik is tampering with my Buzzboxes!

I've been trying to get the Buzzbox network back online since we were able to drive the [[Horde]] out of Darkshore, but I'm getting no reading from boxes 456, 627, 111, and 854! I'd be willing to bet that some stragglers from the [[Bilgewater Cartel]] are to blame!

See if you can get those Buzzboxes back online, will you? We'll need their readings if we ever want to permanently fix the corruption problem here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|q1=200|War Resources
}}

==Progress==
Are the Buzzboxes back online?

==Completion==
You did it! The Buzzbox network is back online!

Now, if I can only remember the passcode to this thing we'll be in business!
