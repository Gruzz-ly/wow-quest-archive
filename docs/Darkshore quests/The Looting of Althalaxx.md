==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Teegan Holloway.jpg|Teegan Holloway|The Forsaken prowl the tower's grounds. Show no mercy.}}
Locate [[Narassin's Tome]] among the ruins of Althalaxx and kill the [[Forsaken]] commander [[Teegan Holloway]].
* Teegan Holloway slain
* Narassin's Tome

==Description==
Before you rejoin the battle, <class>, something urgent has come to my attention. My scouts report that the Forsaken are scouring the ruined [[Tower of Althalaxx|tower of Althalaxx]] to our south.

Prior to the assault, that bleak tower housed a fanatical arm of the [[Shadow Council]] commanded by the fallen [[highborne]] [[Athrikus Narassin]]. Narassin [[The Tower of Althalaxx (8)|is long since dead]], but if any of his work survives, we can't allow it out of our sight. Retrieve his research and kill the Forsaken commander who's plundering the ruins.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Wild Bark Boots
|Forsaken Belt
|Narassin's Gloves
|Wildwood Chain Links
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Narassin is no longer our concern, but if his life's work should fall to our enemies, centuries of dark wisdom could be called down onto our heads. How goes the hunt? 

==Completion==
Let's see what we've got here.... By [[Elune]], his notes are scrawled in a half dozen languages. What is this, blood? This archive makes my flesh seethe, but at least it's secure. It will take us some time to decipher these notes.

Oh - your reward? Yes, here. Nice work with those undead scavengers. Now get back to the fight.
