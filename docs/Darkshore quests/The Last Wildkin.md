==Objectives==
Speak to [[Aroom]] at the [[Moontouched Den]] north of the [[Eye of the Vortex]].

==Description==
The [[wildkin]] were once numerous in [[Darkshore]].  Such are their ties to the land that the [[Cataclysm]] that shattered Darkshore also decimated their numbers.

The wildkin Aroom is the last of his tribe and is a powerful elder with a strong connection to [[Elune]].  His help will be most necessary in healing the land—you will find him north of here at the Moontouched Den.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|0}} (+{{coppercost|360}} at max level)

==Completion==
A terrible sadness surrounds the creature.  Its eyes stare beyond you as you approach it. 

==Progression==
{{Eye of the Vortex quest chain}}
