==Objectives==
Use Buried Artifact Detector on the beach near [[Remtravel's Excavation]] site to locate 5 [[Ancient Device Fragment]]s. Combine them to create the Ancient Slotted Device.
*[[Ancient Slotted Device]]
*[[Buried Artifact Detector]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that we have the [[Mud-Crusted Ancient Disc|disc]], a lot of our earlier finds are starting to make sense. Shortly after my arrival, [[Prospector Remtravel]] unearthed what he presumed to be a prehistoric toaster.

It's my belief that this slotted box is some sort of data reader. Unfortunately, it broke apart and washed away with the rest of our base camp when the tidal wave struck!

It can't have gone far, <name>. Pieces must be buried in the nearby sand. Here, use my trusty buried artifact detector to comb the beach for them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of the following:
|Unidentified Cooking Utensil
|Professor's Sandwich Plate
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||10|}}
*1350 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you assemble all the pieces of the slotted device? We may need to remove Prospector Remtravel's sandwich from the ancient data interface.

==Completion==
Why yes, yes, this is it! See here, the slot is the exact dimensions of the ancient disc, just as I'd surmised. Here's your reward, <name> - you've earned it.

<Jr. Archaeologist Ferd upends the device and pours mud and garbage from the slot.>

Are you ready to meet history face to face? Let's see what the ancients have to say!

==Notes==
*Use the Buried Artifact Detector along the beach to reveal one or more searchable mounds. Searching each mound will yield [[Ancient Device Fragment]], [[Corroded Keys]], [[Broken Timepiece]], or [[Brass Button]].
*Once you have 5 Ancient Device Fragments, you must combine them into the Ancient Slotted Device to complete the quest.
