==Objectives==
Find [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande]] in [[Darkshore]] and lend her aid.
* Set Sail for Darkshore
* Aid Tyrande in Darkshore

==Description==
<Name>, I will not mince words. Tyrande foolishly risks her life with the ritual she intends to perform. If she falls, our entire war effort will fall with her.

We must set off for Darkshore and come to her aid. Only then can we march forward and reclaim our homeland.

We have lost [[Teldrassil]]. Fool or not, our people cannot afford to lose Tyrande as well.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Blessing of the Night Warrior]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Our vengeance has just begun.
