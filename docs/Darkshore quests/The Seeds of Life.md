==Objectives==
Gather a Seed of the Earth, a Seed of the Sea, and a Seed of the Sky.
*[[Seed of the Earth]]
*[[Seed of the Sea]]
*[[Seed of the Sky]]

==Description==
Something is trying to devour the life of Darkshore from within! I'll ask around to learn more about the - thing - you discovered in the lake. Meanwhile, we need to protect the local wildlife from further harm.

Can you gather some materials for me? I'll need life in all its incarnations. Talk to {{NPC||Onu}} here in the grove to acquire a [[Seed of the Earth]]. Capture a {{NPC||Darkshore Wisp}} floating amongst the trees and we'll have a [[Seed of the Sky]]. Find a [[Seed of the Sea]] within seashells along the coast, west of here. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Wisp-Chaser Cord
|Planter's Gloves
|Seedhandler's Soft Grips
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Life is powerful, <name>. Concentrated in its purest form, it can overcome anything. Someday, even Darkshore will heal from its wounds. Did you find everything I need? 

==Completion==
Perfect, this is everything. Did you have fun collecting the wisp? I used to chase the wisps around Ashenvale when I was just a girl.

<Lost in memories for a moment, Kathrena suddenly grows somber.>

I'm afraid I've found out what we're dealing with.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Onu
{{Dialogue|
Be still, little one, and you can hear this ancient land speak. It cries out in pain.
