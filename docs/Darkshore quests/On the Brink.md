==Objectives==
Retrieve 6 Shatterspear Amulets.

* [[Shatterspear Amulet]] (6)

==Description==
I've already been working on something for breaking down their protective wards. With a foci based in their power and a bit of druidic magic, we should be able to breach their shields.

Find their shaman to the east and southeast and recover several of their amulets. I will prepare them and imbue an arrow that you can deliver to Sandrya Moonfall for the attack.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|600}} (+{{coppercost|600}} at max level)

==Progress==
Did you recover the amulets?

==Completion==
These will do perfectly.  I will prepare them for [[Huntress Sandrya Moonfall|Sandrya]] - you are sure to be dispatched to meet with her shortly.
