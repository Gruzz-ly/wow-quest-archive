==Objectives==
Return to [[Larien]] at the Grove of the Ancients with the information you've obtained.

==Description==
The Master's Glaive was the site of an ancient battle, <name>. The titans sent twenty of their stone giants against Soggoth.

Of those twenty giants, one survived.

The tablets say that [[Kronn]], the largest of the stone giants allowed himself to be entangled by Soggoth's tendrils -- just long enough to be lifted close enough to the creature's skull... within reach of his mighty sword.

It's a good thing he's dead... we don't really have twenty stone giants lying around to stop him again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*365 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Completion==
The dwarf's story is unsettling... yet informative.  It seems we have few options left.

==Progression==
{{Grove of the Ancients quest chain}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
