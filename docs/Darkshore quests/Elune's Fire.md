==Objectives==
Obtain Elune's Torch from [[Horoo the Flamekeeper]].
* [[Elune's Torch]]

==Description==
We need special flame for ritual.  We need Elune's fire.

Horoo's spirit wanders east of here.  Horoo carries torch of Elune.  Bring here so spirits rest.

Aroom thanks you.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|700}} (+{{coppercost|660}} at max level)

==Progress==
You have torch? 

==Completion==
<Aroom lets out a long low-pitched hoot.>

Finally kin may rest.

==Notes==
On completion, there is a short scripted event where Aroom builds a bonfire:
:''Two [[Wildkin]] spirits appear.''
:{{text|say|Tranquil Wildkin Spirit|We thank you, Aroom.  And we thank <name>.  We return to [[Elune]]... finally.}}
