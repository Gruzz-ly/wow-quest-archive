==Objectives==
Witness [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande's]] address to the [[Night elf|kaldorei]].
* Tyrande's address [[Maiev Shadowsong|witnessed]]

==Description==
[[Darkshore]] belongs to our people once more, in no small part due to your efforts. And, while I disagree with her methods, we would not have succeeded without Tyrande as well.

Differences aside, she is our leader--and an incarnation of the [[Night Warrior]] herself.

She is about to begin. You may stand here beside me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]
* [[Nightwreathed Egg]]

==Progress==
This is the first step towards our retribution.

==Completion==
[[Dori'thur]] laid this egg when [[Elune]]'s shadow fell over us. If you are willing, I would entrust her offspring to your care as a token of my gratitude.

==Notes==
Besides Maiev, among the gathered crowd are [[Malfurion Stormrage]], [[Shandris Feathermoon]], [[Mordent Evenshade]], [[Sentinel Cordressa Briarbow]], [[Moon Priestess Lasara]], [[Thisalee Crow]], [[Genn Greymane|Genn]], [[Mia Greymane|Mia]], and [[Tess Greymane]] as well as [[Celestine of the Harvest]], Commander [[Lorna Crowley]], [[Nightwreathed Huntress]]es, [[Nightwreathed Priestess]]es, [[Nightwreathed Sentinel]]s, and [[Nightwreathed Mender]]s.

Speak with Maiev:
