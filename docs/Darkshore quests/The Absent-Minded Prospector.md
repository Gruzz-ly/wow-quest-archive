== Objectives ==
Escort the confused Prospector Remtravel to his missing journal. Talk to [[Jr. Archaeologist Ferd]] at the dig site when you're done.
* [[Prospector Remtravel]] Escorted

== Description ==
Who are you again? <Name>? Have we met? If you're here from the [[Explorers' League|League]], you can tell them I'm not leaving! Not without my find. I had it, right in my hands! Then the screaming. Then the wetness.

Listen here whos-yer-name, I documented the whole thing in my journal the day the tidal wave hit. And I know just where I left it! The journal. Not the find. Help me get the one so we can get the other! Or vice-versa! Do you follow? Follow me!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Woolgathering Gloves

|Bahrum's Bad Mood Ring

}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
Prospector Remtravel is an unsung hero!  Like any great explorer, he is prone to wandering aimlessly.

== Completion ==
Ah, you've helped the Prospector find his missing journal! To think it was here all along.

Someday you'll have to show me this other set of ruins he's always going on about.
