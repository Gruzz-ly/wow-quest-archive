==Objectives==
Speak to [[Sandrya Moonfall]] to start the attack, and aid her in killing Jor'kil the Soulripper.
*[[Jor'kil the Soulripper]] slain

==Description==
Their leader and his guard are before us. My [[Sentinels]] are ready to take care of his guard, we only awaited this arrow to seal their leader's fate.

Let me know when you are prepared to attack. As soon as my Sentinels engage, I will shatter the leader's shield, and we will assault him together. Strike swiftly and we can route this threat to our lands here and now.

We await only you - speak to me when ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|1300}} (+{{coppercost|780}} at max level)

==Progress==
As it should be.

==Completion==
We owe a great debt to you for all that you've done to see this battle through.

Not often can we claim victories so decisively, but it seems there's far more to this plot than just the Shatterspear. If you haven't already checked his body for information, make sure to do so before you leave.
