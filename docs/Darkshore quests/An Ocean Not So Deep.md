'''An Ocean Not So Deep''' is a new Alliance quest that replaced the now infamous [[Deep Ocean, Vast Sea]] in [[Darkshore]].

==Objectives==
[[Gorbold Steelhand]] at [[Lor'danel]] wants you to speak to Gary for further instructions.
*[[Scavenging Greymist Murloc]]s (50)

==Description==
You look like an able sort!

There are a great number of wrecks off of the coast here... most old, some new. For quite some time, I've been trying to get at their holds and put their valuables to more use, but there's a nasty infestation of murlocs that seem to have other ideas. I've sent scores of adventurers and none have returned.

Worry not, I've learned my lesson, and that is not your fate. Swim to the due north and look for Gary. He'll explain the new plan. It's pretty simple really.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Glowing Murloc Eye|Shipwreck Bow}}

You will also receive:
*{{Cost||6|}}
*910 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Progress==
You done yet, <boy/girl>?


How do you do? I'm Gary, and I assume Gorbold sent you.

If you're here to help, the plan's pretty simple. I've rigged up some decoy bots. We prance this little fellow in near the [[murloc]]s and activate the countdown. They'll pulse light and sound to attract the murlocs, and after several seconds they'll explode, taking the murlocs with them.

If we get enough of these in there, we should be able to make our way to the ships' holds again. With less casualties this time hopefully. That part's not for you, though, just get to blowing those little fish men up!

==Completion==
The decoys worked then? Great to hear it! Don't you worry yourself one bit about the treasures. Me and Gary will take care of the rest this time around. 

Truth be told, if something went wrong again and I lost any more of you adventurer types, I'm pretty sure they'd kick me out of town.

==Notes==
This quest is a reference to the obsolete quest [[Deep Ocean, Vast Sea]], which Gorbold used to give before [[patch 4.0.3a]]. That quest was notoriously hard and annoying, named one of the worst quests of vanilla ''WoW'', because of the original breath timer of one minute and the vast number of murlocs that respawned quickly and called for reinforcements. The lost adventurers are presumably those who fell in vain trying to complete the older quest.
