==Objectives==
Slay [[Cloudtamer Wildmane]], [[Windmaster Tzu-Tzu]], and [[Skylord Braax]].

* Cloudtamer Wildmane slain
* Windmaster Tzu-Tzu slain
* Skylord Braax slain

==Description==
I've flown through the [[ruins of Auberdine]] on a scouting mission.  There are three [[Twilight's Hammer]] cultists that are responsible for the elementals that have overrun the destroyed town.

Head west into the ruins.  Seek out and slay Cloudtamer Wildmane, Windmaster Tzu-Tzu, and Skylord Braax.

Only then will [[Sentinel Selarin]] and her forces stand a chance of taking back their home.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|0}} (+{{coppercost|660}} at max level)

==Progress==
The three Twilight's Hammer cultists have still not been dealt with.  Is there a problem, <name>?

==Completion==
Without those three coaxing them, perhaps the flow of elementals into the Ruins of Auberdine will be stemmed.

Thank you, <name>.
