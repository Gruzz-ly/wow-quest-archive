==Objectives==
Use the Lifebringer Sapling on the shore of the shallow lake south of the [[Grove of the Ancients]] to destroy the Devouring Artifact and [[Yoth'al the Devourer|its guardian]].
*[[Devouring Artifact]] Destroyed
*[[Lifebringer Sapling (2)]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that the creatures of [[Darkshore]] are safe, let's turn our attention to the artifact you found in the lake. I believe it's the work of a minion of the [[Old Gods]]. We'll fight these fiends using the very lifegiving energies of Darkshore itself! Take the Lifebringer Sapling to the shore of the shallow lake to the south of here. Wave it over the waters of the lake and it should disable that ancient artifact.

Be careful, <name>. The artifact is likely to be guarded by who-knows-what. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ancient Cuffs
|Incorruptable Shawl
|Ancient Handguards
|Ancient Armbands
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||11|30}}
*930 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm afraid to ask, <name>. Is the artifact destroyed? What about its guardian? 

==Completion==
Love of [[Elune]], look at you. That must've been some fight! You're covered in what looks like... chowder.

If a mere minion could cause so much agony here in Darkshore, I can't even imagine the suffering that a true Old One could bring about.

Well, at least the animals are safe for now. I will plant the sapling you created to help rebuild this shattered land. Thank you, <name>! I'd give you a hug but, you know. Chowder. 

== Notes ==
Use the sapling near the artifact to cast "Disrupting the Artifact". Yoth'al the Devourer will appear.

When Yoth'al is defeated:
