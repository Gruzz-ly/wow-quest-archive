==Objectives==
Slay Ungra, Taskmaster Gurran, and Ankova the Fallen.
*[[Ungra]] slain
*[[Taskmaster Gurran]] slain
*[[Ankova the Fallen]] slain

==Description==
The bad [[orc]]s tried to catch me, but I snuck away. I'm good at hiding.

All of the bad orcs are bad, but I've remembered the names of the meanest ones, just in case anybody came to save me.

<Luuka takes a deep breath.>

Ungra, Gurran, and... ummm... oh! Ankova.

Will you protect me from them?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

==Progress==
How goes your mission?

==Completion==
Well done.

Be ready to move. We may have had the element of surprise within this cave, but our advantage is fleeting.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Shadowmoon Clan (Horde)]] from [[Vindicator Maraad]] before heading out.

Head up the stairs and turn north. Look at the map to see exactly where to go. In the cave, head to the back to find [[Yrel]] looking at the corpse of [[Ankova the Fallen]]. Getting close to Yrel will complete the Ankova portion, but Yrel offers [[Yrel (Horde)]], an "escort" quest, involving moving her about 50 yards. Where Yrel breaks off, head up the stairs and enter the northwest tunnel to find [[Taskmaster Gurran]], then run due south to the southwestern tunnel to find [[Ungra]].
