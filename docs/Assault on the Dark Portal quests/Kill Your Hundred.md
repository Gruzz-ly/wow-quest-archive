==Objectives==
Survive [[Kargath Bladefist (alternate universe)|Kargath]]'s Arena.
*Enter the arena {{co|73.5|27.4|Assault on the Dark Portal}}
*Combatants slain in the arena (100)
*Escape Kargath's arena {{co|65.7|20.6|Assault on the Dark Portal}}

==Description==
I see only one way out of this trap, <name>, and it's right through the middle of that arena.

This might be the end of us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|22|80}}
* 17110 XP

==Completion==
You're still alive? Good.

The cave-in will only hold them for so long. We have to keep moving.

==Notes==

:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Follow me, and stay close.}}
:{{text|say|[[Thrall]]|A combat arena. This may be a trap, but at least we will die with honor.}}
:{{text|say|{{Au|Exarch Maladaar}}|This slaver and torturer knows nothing of honor.}}
:{{text|say|Farseer {{Au|Drek'Thar}}|Mm.}}
Enter the arena for a short cutscene:

All [[Shattered Hand Brawler (Tanaan Jungle)|Shattered Hand Brawler]] kills count, and the NPCs will get most of them. Just stay alive. At 99 kills, another cutscene:
:{{text|yell|Kargath Bladefist|I am pleased. I could watch you rats fight for hours.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Sorry, but we don't have that kind of time.}}
:''Khadgar freezes every Shattered Hand orc on the arena floor.''
:{{text|yell|Archmage Khadgar|Everyone, with me!}}
:''Khadgar takes off through the northern exit and follows the trail west.''
:{{text|say|Kargath Bladefist|Hmph. I only counted ninety-nine kills, wizard.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Then I guess we owe you one.}}
''Player gets final kill credit.''
:{{text|yell|Kargath Bladefist|After them! Don't let them get away!}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khagar|Quickly! Into the cave, before they thaw.}}
:''Khadgar leads the group into the [[Umbral Halls]] and brings down a rockfall to close off the entrance as Kargath's forces close in.''
