==Objectives==
Obtain Ga'nar's Shackle Key from [[Overseer Gotrigg]].
*[[Ga'nar's Shackle Key]] {{co|45.6|39.8|Assault on the Dark Portal}}

==Description==
These stinking {{Au|Blackrock clan|Blackrock}} cowards think they're humiliating me.

They're just making me angrier.

Overseer Gotrigg, in the hut over there, carries my shackle key. If I'm going to get out of there, I'm going to need that key. Then...  vengeance can begin.

==Rewards==
Level 45 talents will be unlocked.

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

==Progress==
You'll have to pry that key out of his cold, ugly hand.

== Completion ==
<Ga'nar works his neck out of the shackle.>

Much better.

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Ga'nar|Just get me free, stranger. I could kill a hundred of these pigs with this shovel alone.}}

Blackrock workers yell stuff about the Frostwolf (meaning Ga'nar):
*{{text|yell|Blackrock Laborer|Is that Frostwolf runt broken yet?}}
*{{text|yell|Blackrock Laborer|Tell that Frostwolf to keep shovelling! Hrah hrah hrah...}}
*{{text|yell|Blackrock Laborer|Don't let up on that Frostwolf pup. We must break his spirit.}}

Aggro Gotrigg in the big building near Ga'nar:
:{{text|yell|Overseer Gotrigg|Interrupting cretins! I'll sear that pretty armor right into your skin!}}

Enter the hut to the north guarded by [[Burning Blade Saberguard]]s and head downstairs to find [[Overseer Gotrigg]].
