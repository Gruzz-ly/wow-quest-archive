==Objectives==
Collect the Iron Horde Missive from one of the [[Iron Horde]] at the base of the {{Au|Dark Portal}}.
*[[Iron Horde Missive]]

==Description==
Countless times you have battled against impossible odds and unspeakable evil - and returned the victor. Now, once more, you have answered the call of duty, prepared to risk your life to save the world that you love - [[Azeroth|our world]].

You are Azeroth's last hope, <name>.

While the challenges that stand before us are daunting, there is no other that I would trust to lead this mission.

The enemy at the front may have the information we need to win this war. Seek and destroy!

Go now, <name>! For Azeroth!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 13700 XP

==Progress==
This missive bears the mark of the {{Au|Warsong clan}}.

==Completion==
This folded letter, bearing the mark of {{Au|Grommash Hellscream}}, looks promising...

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|We're all counting on you, <name>.}}

Head into the fray and kill any mob, like an [[Iron Horde Grunt]] or a [[Warsong Commander]]. One of them will drop the missive.

During your questing near the Dark Portal, several conversations and dialogue goes on with the present hero NPCs:
:{{text|say|[[Vindicator Maraad]]|KHADGAR! INCOMING!}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|GET BEHIND ME!}}
<br>
:{{text|say|[[Cordana Felsong]]|The front lines are faltering. They cannot hold for much longer.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|<Name> needs more time to finish the mission!}}
:{{text|say|[[Thrall]]|The [[Elemental|elements]] will grant us time! For Azeroth!}}
:{{text|yell|Thrall|FURY OF EARTH, GRANT ME YOUR STRENGTH!}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|I... I grow weary. The elements are barely a whisper.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Rest now, heroes! Soon more will come! We must allow <name> to finish the mission! For Azeroth!}}
<br>
:{{text|say|Thrall|Archmage, if <name> is to succeed in <his/her> mission the vanguard must not fall!}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|I will not stand idly by and watch our heroes die!}}
:{{text|yell|Thrall|FURY OF STORMS, HEAR MY PLEA!}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|I will not be able to continue to defend the front for much longer. My power here is diminished greatly. <Name> must succeed or Azeroth will fall.}}
:{{text|yell|Vindicator Maraad|MUSTER YOUR STRENGTH! ANOTHER IRON HORDE BATTALION APPROACHES!}}
<br>
:{{text|yell|[[Lady Liadrin]]|IRON HORDE TANK HEADING TO THE FRONT! IT'S MASSIVE!}}
:{{text|yell|Archmage Khadgar|Focus on your mission, <name>! I will handle the tank!}}
<br>
:{{text|yell|Lady Liadrin|RAMPAGING BEASTS CHARGING TO OUR POSITION!}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|Conserve your energy. We must ensure that <name> completes the mission. I will deal with the beasts myself!}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|[[Light]], grant me your vengeance and <name> your protection.}}
:{{text|yell|Vindicator Maraad|Fight on, brothers and sisters! <Name> will see us through this war!}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|Merely adolescent [[gronn]], Khadgar. Nothing that Commander <name> couldn't handle alone.}}

If you wander off, Khadgar will teleport the adventurer back to him:
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Please, don't wander too far. We need you here, champion.}}
