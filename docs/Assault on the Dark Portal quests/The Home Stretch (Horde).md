==Objectives==
[[File:The Home Stretch - finale.jpg|thumb|Ready to escape]]
Escape to the docks.
*Get to the docks

==Description==
If they weren't angry before, they sure are now. We won't survive a minute up on top o' this tank!

Let's join up with the rest and get out of here!!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|34|20}}
* 20540 XP

==Completion==
Against all odds, here we stand. Still alive, an entire army on our heels.

Our ship is waiting. Shall we depart?

==Notes==
*The player receives the Panicked Rush buff.
*This completes the [[Welcome to Draenor]] achievement, the end of the [[Assault on the Dark Portal]]. The [[Frostfire Ridge storyline]] begins next, with [[The Home of the Frostwolves]].
*This quest is not on a timer, you can take your time and head down to the docks at your own speed despite what you see around you.
