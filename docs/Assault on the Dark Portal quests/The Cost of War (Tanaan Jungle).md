==Objectives==
[[File:The Cost of War.jpg|thumb|On the way to Heartblood]]
Follow [[Archmage Khadgar]].

==Description==
They called this operation a suicide mission, but I don't plan on throwing away any lives meaninglessly.

Everybody, with me!

==Rewards==
You will gain the following spells:
*Sustained Combat

You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|14}}
* 1350 XP

==Completion==
With the {{Au|Dark Portal}} disabled, we have a new mission: stay alive.

We must keep pressing on, even if only to honor those who stayed behind to secure our retreat.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|The vanguard is falling. We will not let their great sacrifice be in vain!}}
:''The collected party runs east, through the portal's frame to the back of the Dark Portal and down the stairs to the southeast. In the [[Heartblood]], Khadgar wipes out a few guards in front of a small building and ushers everybody in.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khaddgar|In here!}}
: ''Thrall and Maraad take up guard posts at the outer doorway, while Qiana Moonshadow stealths in cat form to patrol in front of the building.''
