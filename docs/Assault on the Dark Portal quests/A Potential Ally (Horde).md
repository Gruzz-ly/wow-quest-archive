==Objectives==
[[File:A Potential Ally - dousing the flames.jpg|thumb|Dousing the flames]]
Use the Frostflurry Focus near the ring of fire in [[Kargathar Proving Grounds]] to free Farseer Drek'Thar.
*{{Au|Drek'Thar|Farseer Drek'Thar}} freed {{co|69.0|33.0|Assault on the Dark Portal}}
*[[Frostflurry Focus]] (provided)

==Description==
One of the captured [[orc]]s is receiving some... preferential treatment, if you can call it that. While others are tied down and tortured, this one is tied to a stake and burned for the amusement of his captors.

Use this runestone. It should handily deal with the ring of fire that surrounds him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
{{itembox|Item level 507 chestpieces|Slavebreaker Robes|Slavebreaker Tunic|Slavebreaker Chainmail|Slavebreaker Chestguard}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

==Completion==
I owe my life to you, stranger. I offer you and your company my support. Together, we may make it out of this jungle alive.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Thrall]]|Stay alive, <name>.}}
Cross the road to the west and trigger the Frostfury extra action button when it pops up near the fire. [[Exarch Maladaar (alternate universe)|Exarch Maladaar]] and [[Drek'Thar (alternate universe)|Farseer Drek'Thar]] are bound to a stake in the middle of the fire.
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|I feel the flames dying down. What is happening, exarch?}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|We have a visitor. Perhaps... a savior.}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|We are freed! Follow me, shaman. We will escape through the hills.}}
Return to Maladaar.
