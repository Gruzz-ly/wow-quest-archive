Enter the Worldbreaker Side Turret and destroy 200 Iron Horde troops.
*Enter the [[Worldbreaker Side Turret]] {{co|40.2|49.1|Assault on the Dark Portal||1}}
*[[Iron Horde]] slain (200)
*Press the [[Main Cannon Trigger]] {{co|40.3|48.3|Assault on the Dark Portal||1}}

==Description==
The way I see it, there's two ways to keep [[Iron Worldbreaker|this tank]] from going through the {{Au|Dark Portal|portal}}: break the tank, or USE the dang tank ta' BLOW UP the dang portal.

I can get 'er workin', I just need time. Hop in that turret off the starboard bow and keep 'em off my back.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|34|20}}
* 20550 XP

==Progress==
Almost there, <name>.

==Completion==
Takin' away {{Au|Gul'dan}} was one thing, but blowin' up the whole damned portal? That's my kind of solution.

Now, I think we'd better get out of here before that army gets to us.

==Notes==
Start the quest and bedlam reigns:
:{{text|yell|Thaelin Darkanvil|[[Orc]]s off the starboard bow!}}
:{{text|say|[[Khadgar|Archmage Khadgar]]|Looks like we arrived just in time.}}
:{{text|say|Thaelin Darkanvil|Hop inta that turret and keep 'em away!}}
:{{text|say|Thaelin Darkanvil|I'll see if I can get this thing goin'. Khadgar, buy me some time!}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|We will do what we can, Thaelin.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|<Name>, keep these orcs off of us!}}

Use the vehicle UI to blow up [[Iron Horde Grunt]]s. At first blood:
:{{text|yell|[[Hansel Heavyhands]]|Ahh ha ha haaa! Nice shot!}}

At 25 kills:
:{{text|yell|[[Yrel]]|Tank coming over the rise! Look out!}}

At 30:
:{{text|say|Thaelin Darkanvil|These controls don't make SENSE. Remind me never ta drive a tank built by an orc.}}

An [[Iron Horde Obliterator]] starts attacking - take it out before going back to the footsoldiers. At 40, two tanks appear:
:{{text|yell|[[Thrall]]|Hold strong, everyone. Here they come!}}

At 75:
:{{text|yell|Hansel Heavyhands|They're bringin' up explosives! <Name>, destroy those carts before they get close!}}

Hitting a [[Bomb Cart]] will kill just about everything within 20 yards, drastically inflating the kill count. At around 120:
:{{text|say|[[Vindicator Maraad]]|There's so many of them...}}
:{{text|yell|{{Au|Drek'Thar|Farseer Drek'Thar}}|Don't you give up yet, paladin.}}
:''Drek'Thar casts [[Bloodlust]].''

At 200:
:{{text|say|Thaelin Darkanvil|That's it! I've got 'er runnin'! Let's finish this.}}

Run up to Thaelin and press the Main Cannon Trigger.

A cutscene takes place.

:''The cannon fires and successfully destroys the Dark Portal. All the Warlords (excluding Gul'dan) appear at a high peak. Their leader comes from behind them.''
:'''{{Au|Grommash Hellscream}}''': {{text|bossemote|Are you so eager to meet death? Look then upon the countless faces of your demise.}}
:'''Grommash Hellscream''': {{text|bossemote|Rise up, [[Iron Horde]]! Bring your [[warchief]] their heads.}}
