The '''Warlords of Draenor intro experience''' begins the [[Warlords of Draenor campaign]] and takes place in a phased version of [[Blasted Lands]] for level-90s, and an instanced version of [[Tanaan Jungle]], the [[Assault on the Dark Portal]]. The Blasted Lands experience is part of the Warlords launch event and went live before the expansion.

Completing the intro awards the achievement [[Welcome to Draenor]].

The [[Iron Horde]] have activated their {{Au|Dark Portal}} and have begun streaming through it in the [[Blasted Lands]]. They've made it all the way to [[Blackrock Spire]] and have designs on the rest of [[Azeroth]]. In the Blasted Lands, [[Nethergarde Keep]] has fallen, [[Okril'lon Hold]] (previously [[Dreadmaul Hold]]) has been taken over, and the [[Dreadmaul tribe]] have taken up with the Iron Horde as endless numbers of orcs stream from the Dark Portal.

Start the intro experience by picking up the breadcrumb from the [[What's New]]? message that appears the first time after logging in, or from the [[Hero's Call Board]]s or [[Warchief's Command Board]]s in the capital cities, then taking the port to the [[Shattered Landing]] in [[Blasted Lands]].

This part of the intro experience goes live with the launch of Warlords of Draenor. It starts by picking up the quest [[Warlords of Draenor: The Dark Portal]] from the [[What's New]] interface that appears automatically on launch or after logging in, or by picking it up from the [[Hero's Call Board]]s or [[Warchief's Command Board]]s in capital cities.

It's up to a strike force led by [[Archmage Khadgar]] on a suicide mission to shut down the {{Au|Dark Portal}} and stop the Iron Horde threat! 

The starting experience is a roughly hour-long highly-phased quest chain sending players on a counter-clockwise loop of the area. Upon the conclusion of [[The Home Stretch]], players leave the instanced area and begin the [[Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe) storyline|Shadowmoon Valley storyline]] or the [[Frostfire Ridge storyline]], for Alliance and Horde players respectively.

Should you leave Draenor before completing this quest chain, going through the Dark Portal from the Blasted Lands will teleport you back to the instanced area.

==Trivia==
*The Iron Horde Attack Questline, which released in patch 6.0.2 did not offer any gear rewards to the first people who rushed to complete them.  It was a surprise going back on alts to find gear available, and some players were unhappy because - not surprisingly - their mains were the ones who did not get the gear and most needed them.  Eventually the quests were opened up again to those who did not get the gear, but the phasing made it difficult or impossible to find NPCs.
* If you explore too far from Khadgar and the questline after entering the Dark Portal, Khadgar ports you back to him saying {{text|say|Please, don't wander too far. We need you here, champion.}}
*The Draenor counterattack was longer at launch, with additional quests that have since been trimmed.
