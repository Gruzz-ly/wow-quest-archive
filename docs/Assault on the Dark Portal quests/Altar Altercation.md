==Objectives==
[[File:Altar Altercation - path to top.jpg|thumb|The path to the top]]

Speak with Ariok, then help him distract the [[Eye of Kilrogg (Tanaan Jungle)|Eye of Kilrogg]].
*Speak with [[Ariok]] {{co|72.0|62.2|Assault on the Dark Portal}}
*Escort Ariok to the [[Bleeding Altar]] {{co|76.2|54.5|Assault on the Dark Portal}}
*[[Blood Ritual Orb (Assault on the Dark Portal)|Blood Ritual Orb]] destroyed (3) {{co|76.7|53.8|Assault on the Dark Portal}} {{co|78.1|53.5|Assault on the Dark Portal}} {{co|78.6|53.4|Assault on the Dark Portal}}
*Find [[Khadgar]] on [[Tar'thog Bridge]] {{co|72.0|40.5|Assault on the Dark Portal}}

==Description==
You see that altar down there? There's a [[magic]]al eye settled at its peak, and I fear our group will not survive if it sees us.

Distract the eye, <name>. Cause a ruckus, kill some ritualists, whatever you have to do - just occupy that thing long enough for me to guide the rest of our group past its gaze.

<Khadgar looks over his shoulder.>

Bring that strapping [[orc]] with you. The one that's not [[Thrall]].

==Rewards==
You will gain the following spells:
*Advanced Combat Mechanics
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

==Completion==
<Khadgar looks concerned.>

No - we cannot wait for Ariok. He knew what he was getting into.

His sacrifice cannot go to waste. We must keep moving.

==Notes==
Next to Thrall is [[Ariok]], away from his post at the [[Burning Steppes]]:
:What can I do to help?
:{{gossip|Khadgar has asked us to go distract the Eye of Kilrogg.}}
:{{text|say|Ariok|You and I against an entire [[clan]]? Sounds like my kind of fight.}}
:{{text|say|Ariok|The {{Au|Bleeding Hollow clan|Bleeding Hollow}} orcs use savage [[blood magic]] to transform their [[warrior]]s into [[dire orc|hulking berserkers]].}}
:{{text|say|Ariok|With any luck, we will escape before they can complete their transformation ritual.}}

Head northeast to the Bleeding Altar:
:{{text|yell|Ariok|Here we stand, cowards! Come... FIGHT US!}}
:{{text|say|Ariok|They seem focused on their ritual. Maybe destroying those blood orbs will get their attention.}}

Destroy one:
:{{text|whisper|{{Au|Kilrogg Deadeye}}|I can see you...}}

...and the second:
:{{text|say|Ariok|It looks like Khadgar and the rest are on the move. Our work is nearly done, champion!}}
:''The party sneaks past as the [[Eye of Kilrogg (Tanaan Jungle)|Eye of Kilrogg]] focuses on the player.''

The third orb is atop the structure -- access it via the stairs on either side. At the base of the steps:
:{{text|whisper|Kilrogg Deadeye|I'm coming for you, intruders...}}

A cutscene takes place:
:{{text|say|Ariok|Look!}}
:''The camera tracks from the player's position atop the altar to the southeast, where Kilrogg Deadeye walks up with his entourage.
:{{text|bossemote|KILROGG DEADEYE}}
:{{text|say|Kilrogg Deadeye|Look what dragged itself through [[Tanaan Jungle|my jungle]]. Fresh meat!}}
:''The cutscene ends as Ariok starts to move.''
:{{text|say|Ariok|I know what I must do.}}
:''Ariok jumps down and runs through the blood orb, turning himself into a berserker.''
:{{text|yell|Ariok|BLOOD AND HONOR!}}
:''He runs and jumps over to Kilrogg's position to intercept them.''
:{{text|say|Ariok|GOOOO... FIND... KHADGARRRR...}}

Run north across the [[Tar'thog Bridge]] to find Khadgar.
