==Objectives==
[[File:Iron Horde Weapon.jpg|thumb|Iron Horde Weapon]]
Obtain 30 Blackrock Weapons.
*[[Blackrock Weapon]] x30

==Description==
There's nowhere to hide up here. We need to keep moving, and to do that, we need to pass right through the heart of the [[Iron Horde]].

It's time to turn this unarmed group of prisoners into an army.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 510 shoulders|Quarrier's Spaulders|Quarrier's Shoulderplates|Quarrier's Mantle|Quarrier's Pauldrons}}
You will gain the following spells:
*Cooldowns
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

==Progress==
These [[prisoner]]s are no less brave than you or I, <name>. Give them a weapon and an ounce of hope and they will fight like the storm.

==Completion==
Great work, <name>.

Don't put away your weapon yet - now's when the REAL work begins.

==Notes==
Before heading out to complete the quest, Thrall gives the freed slaves elemental blessings, while Yrel and Liadrin use the Light to treat the injured.

*{{text|yell|Thrall|Fury of Wind, honor these soldiers with your presence!}}
*{{text|yell|Thrall|Fury of Water, heal our injured!}}

Loot weapons off the ground and kill Blackrocks for more. Weapon racks hold a half-dozen.
