:''Khadgar finishes winding up his spell by combining orbs of fire, frost, and arcane into one and hurls it, destroying the dam. He quickly runs off in the other direction as the water floods the low ground.''

On approaching Cordana, a portal appears beside her. A small mass of water and some [[Unlucky Fish]] comes through with Khadgar.
