==Objectives==
[[File:Blackrock Laborer.jpg|thumb|Blackrock Laborer]]

Obtain the Worldbreaker Schematics from {{Au|Blackrock clan|Blackrock Orcs}} in the [[Blackrock Quarry]].
*[[Worldbreaker Schematics]]

==Description==
Looks like we'll soon have another obstacle in our way: that ridiculously large tank that they have pointed at the {{Au|Dark Portal}}. The [[Iron Worldbreaker]], I think they call it.

If I had some documentation on how it might work, then I might be able to figure out how to shut it down. Maybe some o' [[Blackrock Machinist|those machinists]] and [[Blackrock Laborer|laborers]] have some documentation on how it works?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

==Progress==
Any luck?

==Completion==
Mmm... yes... simple enough.

<The dwarf flips through the pages and no longer seems to notice your presence.>

==Notes==
Pick up [[Ga'nar of the Frostwolf]] and [[The Gunpowder Plot]] before heading out. Enter the closest hut to pick up the gunpowder to start leaving a trail. The schematics will drop from any random [[Blackrock Machinist|machinist]] or [[Blackrock Laborer|laborer]] in the area.
