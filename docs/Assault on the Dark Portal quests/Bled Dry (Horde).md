==Objectives==
Free [[slave]]s from the 2 [[Bleeding Hollow Cage]]s in [[Heartblood]].
*Eastern cage opened
*Southern cage opened

==Description==
<The [[orc]] spits out his last words:>

They kept us in cages. They... drain our blood, for... rituals...

<The Frostwolf coughs violently.>

...many left --

<poem>    -- my... people...</poem>

<The orc dies.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

==Progress==
You should save those orcs, <name>. It is the right thing to do.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>.

Given, they are injured, half-starved, and poorly-equipped... but there is no blade so sharp as a vengeful spirit, no armor so thick as a righteous cause.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Vengeance for the Fallen (Horde)]] before heading out. The cages hold multiple slaves, so this shouldn't take long.

Approaching the cage:
*{{text|yell|[[Frostwolf Slave]]|Help us!}}
*{{text|yell|Frostwolf Slave|Set us free!}}

Opening the cage:
*{{text|yell|Frostwolf Slave|Whoever you are... thank you.}}
*{{text|yell|Frostwolf Slave|They were bleeding us dry. I don't think we had much longer...}}

Once done with all three, find Khadgar and the party up the hill, southeast of where the Karabor prisoners were. Turn in to Khadgar.

==Trivia==
*During the beta, it was named "Nothing But... Berserker Fuel".
