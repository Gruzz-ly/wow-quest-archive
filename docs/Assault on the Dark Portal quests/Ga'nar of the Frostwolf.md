==Objectives==
Find {{Au|Ga'nar}}.

==Description==
We must move on, there isn't time to waste!

One of the elders of [[Frostwolf Orcs|my clan]], Ga'nar, is out there somewhere. I can sense him, but I cannot find him.

Keep an eye out for Ga'nar. He is a strong-willed [[orc]], and will languish in captivity.

==Rewards==
Level 30 talents will be unlocked.

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

==Completion==
<The orc's lips and wrists quiver with restrained fury.>

Who are you?

Wait, what's that you say? {{Au|Drek'Thar}} is here?

==Notes==
Head south to pick up [[The Gunpowder Plot]] from [[Hansel Heavyhands]] and [[The Shadow of the Worldbreaker]] from [[Thaelin Darkanvil]].

Pick up the gunpowder and kill machinists until the plans drop before heading southwest to find Ga'nar on latrine detail.
