==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Keli'dan the Breaker.jpg|Kelidan the Breaker: Lieutenant to Ner'zhul. Master [[Sorcerer]] of the {{Au|Shadowmoon clan|Shadowmoon}}.}}
Slay Keli'dan the Breaker.
*{{Au|Keli'dan the Breaker}} slain

==Description==
One of {{Au|Ner'zhul}}'s [[lieutenant]]s remains, up ahead. The exit to the cave isn't much farther past him.

I will go back and tell [[Khadgar]] that the cave is clear. We will rendezvous once you've taken cave of Keli'dan!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

==Completion==
Fine job in the cave, but this is no time to rest.

We have momentum. We must stay in motion.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lady Liadrin|I'll take this draenei back to Khadgar. Stop that orc from opening the portal!}}
:{{text|say|[[Yrel]]|We will return with help.}}

Head west through the iron Cage Door to find Keli'dan the Breaker.
:{{text|yell|Keli'dan the Breaker|You - from beyond the portal! You will make a marvelous sacrifice.}}

Kill him for another cutscene:
:{{text|yell|Keli'dan the Breaker|Ner'zhul... Help me...}}
:''Ner'zhul pops out of the portal.''
:{{text|say|Ner'zhul|Worthless...}}
:{{text|say|Ner'zhul|Your scurrying is at an end, rats.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Not so fast, Ner'zhul.}}
:''The party appears, facing down Ner'zhul.''
:{{text|say|Ner'zhul|Yes... step closer! I will bury you alive for the glory of the [[Iron Horde]]!}}
:{{text|yell|Thrall|Khadgar! Get us out of here!}}
:''Khadgar teleports the party to the surface, in the [[Blackrock Quarry]].''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|That was close.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|There is no turning back. We press on, through the very jaws of the beast.}}

Follow Khadgar northwest to the makeshift camp.
