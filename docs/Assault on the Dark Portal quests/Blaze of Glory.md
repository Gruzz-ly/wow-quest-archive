==Objectives==
Use the Lucifrium Bead to destroy 8 Bleeding Hollow huts.
*{{Au|Bleeding Hollow clan|Bleeding Hollow}} huts burned (8)
*[[Lucifrium Bead]] (provided)

==Description==
We can't stay here forever. We NEED to keep moving. But first - we need a distraction.

<[[Archmage Khadgar|Khadgar]] conjures a small gem.>

This bead should burn anything flammable that you get close to. With your skill, and a bit of luck, you might be able to take the attention of the Bleeding Hollow [[orc]]s off our group.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
:{{itembox|Item level 506 legs|Hollowheart Legguards|Hollowheart Chain Leggings|Hollowheart Trousers|Hollowheart Pantaloons}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

==Progress==
We cannot hold out here forever, <name>.

==Completion==
Out of the frying pan, into the woods.

Take a breath, then get ready, <name>. There's not much time to rest.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|We cannot stay here long. Soon, the entirety of the [[Iron Horde]] will be upon us.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|<Name>, our champion, will stay back and disrupt the enemy camp. The rest of us will seek safe passage through the jungle.}}

Alliance:
:{{text|say|[[Vindicator Maraad]]|Fight well, <name>.}}

Horde:
:{{text|say|[[Thrall]]|Good luck.}}

Before heading out, pick up [[Vengeance for the Fallen]] from [[Rephuura]] or [[Ashka]], and [[Bled Dry]] from [[Taag]] or [[Korag]].

While killing orcs and freeing prisoners, use the bonus action button when it appears near any huts not on fire. There are five huts near the Frostwolf prisoners, and three huts near the Karabor prisoners.

Once done with all three, find Khadgar and the party up the hill, southeast of where the Karabor prisoners were. Turn in to Khadgar.
