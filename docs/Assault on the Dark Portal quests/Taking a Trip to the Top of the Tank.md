==Objectives==
[[File:Gogluk.jpg|thumb|Gogluk]]

Speak with [[Thaelin Darkanvil]], then escort him to the top of the [[Iron Worldbreaker]].
*Speak with Thaelin {{co|44.1|29.7|Assault on the Dark Portal||1}}
*[[Gogluk]] slain {{co|37.2|48.3|Assault on the Dark Portal||1}}
*Climb the rear chains of the Iron Worldbreaker {{co|40.1|48.4|Assault on the Dark Portal||1}}

==Description==
We cannot risk the reactivation of the {{Au|Dark Portal}}. Now is the time for the deathblow.

Thaelin should have figured out how to get that tank working by now. Take him with you, and turn that tank against the Dark Portal itself. We will follow behind you.

==Rewards==
Level 60 talents will be unlocked.

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

==Completion==
This... I can work with this.

==Notes==
Back to Thaelin:
:Mm? Need somethin'?
''{{gossip|Yes.  I need you to help me operate that enormous tank.}}''
:{{text|say|Thaelin Darkanvil|You do the fightin' and I'll do the fixin'. Now let's get up on that tank!}}
Follow the path southwest to the Path of Glory. On the path itself is the Iron Worldbreaker, with a number of [[Blackrock Deadeye]]s all over it.
:{{text|say|Thaelin Darkanvil|Look back there. I think we can climb up those chains.}}
Kill them (and [[Gogluk]]!) then run up the back chains to get atop the tank. Up top:
:{{text|say|Thaelin Darkanvil|I see the controls!}}
