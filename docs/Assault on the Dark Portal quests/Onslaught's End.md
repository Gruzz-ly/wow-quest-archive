==Objectives==
Disable the two [[fel]] spires of the {{Au|Dark Portal}}.
*[[Mark of the Shadowmoon|Northern Fel Spire]] disabled {{co|51.1|42.0|Assault on the Dark Portal}}
*[[Mark of the Bleeding Hollow|Southern Fel Spire]] disabled {{co|51.1|54.6|Assault on the Dark Portal}}

==Description==
"Guard {{Au|Gul'dan}} and his {{Au|Shadow Council}} with your lives! The portal cannot function without their fel magic. Fail me and watch all that you hold dear turn to ash.

-{{Au|Grommash Hellscream}}."

The [[Iron Horde]] appear to be holding prisoners that are crucial to keeping the portal open. Search the nearby spires!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

==Progress==
See the drifting energy from the tips of those spires?  They clearly have some effect upon the portal.

With any hope the portal falls along with them.

==Completion==
The portal is weakened, but it remains open.

One option remains, <name>.

==Notes==
Head to the northwest and southwest corners of the platform, immediately north and south of where the main melee is.
:{{text|say|Hansel Heavyhands|Get on in there, champ!}}
:{{text|say|Thaelin Darkanvil|Don't worry. We've got your back!}}

Inside the north fel tower is {{Au|Cho'gall}}, who says the following:
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|You... outsider. Destroy that relic, and set us free. (Crush the relic! Smash the relic!)}}

Interact with the Mark of the Shadowmoon.
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|Seek out Gul'dan if you truly wish to stop the Iron Horde. (Gul'dan! Gul'dan powers the portal!)}}
:''Cho'gall takes a portal to leave the area as the Dark Portal weakens.''
:{{text|yell|Archmage Khadgar|Look! The portal grows weaker!}}
:{{text|yell|Archmage Khadgar|Hold that front! Our work is nearly done!}}

At the south fel tower, [[Teron'gor]] is imprisoned!
:{{text|say|Teron'gor|You... strange invaders...}}
:{{text|say|Teron'gor|You seek to disable the Dark Portal?}}
:{{text|say|Teron'gor|I can help you. Just... set me free.}}
:{{text|say|Teron'gor|Destroy the relic, invader!}}

Interact with the Mark of the Bleeding Hollow.
:{{text|say|Teron'gor|Those Iron cowards were using us as conduits to power their portal. They will regret that.}}
:{{text|say|Teron'gor|The Shadow Council thanks you.}}
:''Teron'gor takes a portal to leave the area.

After disabling both:
:{{text|yell|Grommash Hellscream|Iron Horde! The intruders are freeing our prisoners!}}
:{{text|yell|Grommash Hellscream|Stop them!}}
