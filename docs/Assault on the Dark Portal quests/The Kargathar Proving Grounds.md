Follow Khadgar.
*Follow [[Khadgar]] {{co|73.0|38.1|Assault on the Dark Portal}}

==Description==
The [[orc]]s in this area look like members of the {{Au|Shattered Hand clan}}. You can tell by looking at their hands.

Let's join up with the others. We must find a way out of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|70}}
* 6850 XP

==Completion==
We will hold this position for now. We must allow these freed prisoners a moment to breathe.

It is not an ideal position. We will be moving again shortly.
