==Objectives==
Escort Yrel to safety.
*Escort [[Yrel]] to safety {{co|56.5|40.5|Umbral Halls}}

==Description==
Forgive me if I'm a bit flustered - I've never killed anyone before.

My name is Yrel, and I am a student of [[Karabor]].

You say you have an ARMY with you? The [[Light]] must truly be watching over me today.

I will follow you, then. Lead the way, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will gain the following spells:
*Control Mechanics

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

==Completion==
Up there - that is {{Au|Keli'dan the Breaker}}. No doubt he's been alerted to our presence, and he's attempting to tell his warlord about our little jailbreak.

We have to take him out, <name>.

==Notes==
While hunting for [[Ankova the Fallen]] for [[Masters of Shadow (Horde)]], find [[Yrel]] over Ankova's corpse in the northeastern cave.

;On approach
:{{text|say|Yrel|Who's there!? Oh - I'm glad I'm not the only one fighting these monsters.}}

;On accept
:{{text|say|Yrel|We must hurry - these {{Au|Shadowmoon clan|Shadowmoon}} [[orc]]s are under the command of "{{Au|Ner'zhul}}."}}
:{{text|say|Yrel|With his commanders dead, Ner'zhul will surely come looking for us.}}

Exit the cave - Yrel will find her way out:
:{{text|say|Yrel|I see your friends in the chamber up above. I think I can get there safely.}}
