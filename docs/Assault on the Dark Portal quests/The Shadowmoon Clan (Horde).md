==Objectives==
Slay 10 {{Au|Shadowmoon clan|Shadowmoon}} [[Orc]]s or [[Void Wolf|Void Wolves]] within the [[Umbral Halls]].
*Enemy slain in Umbral Halls (10)

==Description==
We will protect the wounded [[prisoner]]s and make sure {{Au|Kargath Bladefist|Kargath}} doesn't get through the rubble. You go ahead and clear the cave, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
:{{itembox|Item level 508 healms|Voidgazer Cap|Voidgazer Chain Hood|Voidgazer Headguard|Voidgazer Headcover}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

==Progress==
I don't like the smell of these orcs, <name>.

<The tauren snorts disdainfully.>

==Completion==
You fight exceptionally well, <name>... better than I could ever hope to.

With those orcs out of the way, [[Khadgar]] and [[Maraad]] should now be able to safely guide the rest of our group through the cave.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Masters of Shadow (Horde)]] from [[Luuka]] before heading out.

[[Taskmaster Gurran]], [[Ungra]], [[Shadowmoon Ritualist]]s and [[Shadowmoon Voidaxe]]s in the northeast, northwest, and southwest tunnels count towards the objective. The northeast tunnel contains [[Yrel]], who starts her eponymous quest, [[Yrel (Horde)]].
