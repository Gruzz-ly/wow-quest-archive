Just southeast of Hansel and Thaelin's position is a small hut. Enter it to find the [[Blackrock Powder Keg]] in the back corner. Interact with it to pick it up and start leaving a trail of highly explosive gunpowder all over the area. Work on the other quests before returning to the makeshift plunger. Interact with it to set off the gunpowder that ''traces the path the player took'' before making it back to the first building, which explodes, sending an Iron Horde Grunt flying at the speed of sound:
