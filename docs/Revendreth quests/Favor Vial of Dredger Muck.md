==Objectives==
Bring the Vial of Dredger Muck to [[Ta'xera]] at The [[Night Market]] in [[Revendreth]].
* [[Vial of Dredger Muck]] (provided)

==Description==
This item will be of great interest to the [[broker]]s.

Per your previous deal with The Night Market, you should bring it to Ta'xera.

You will be fairly compensated.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|75|81|60}}
* 13,400 [[XP]]
* [[Cartel Exchange Vessel]]

==Completion==
What is that horrible smell?!

<You present Ta'xera with the vial.>

Well then. While that odor is vile, the contents of that vial are pristine. The very primordial ooze that dredgers are made from.

I'll pay you double whatever anyone else has already offered.
