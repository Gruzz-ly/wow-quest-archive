==Objectives==
Speak with [[Stonehead]], gatekeeper of the [[Ember Ward]].

==Description==
This is not victory, <name>. If [[Prince Renathal]] does not return, we've merely delayed defeat.

The Prince was last seen during an assault on the [[Sire Denathrius|Master]]'s keep alongside Duke  [[Theotar]].

We don't know the Prince's fate, but we've learned that Duke Theotar was banished to the Ember Ward.

The Ember Ward is a land of madness and torture. Blighted by the [[Light]], the Master sends his most hated enemies there to suffer unending agony.

Enter the Ember Ward, find Theotar, and discover the Prince's fate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|55|5}}
* 970 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You no go here. Here for bad buds!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Without Prince Renathal, our rebellion is doomed.}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Find Duke Theotar in the Ember Ward. Only he knows the Prince's fate.}}

Northwest across the bridge over the [[Banewood]] to the [[Ember Ward]]. Run up to Stonehead, who will snag the player and hold them close to his face!
