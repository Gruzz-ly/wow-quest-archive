==Objectives==
Repair the Broken Mirror and reap the rewards.
*[[Handcrafted Mirror Repair Kit#Quest item]]
* [[Broken Mirror]] repaired
* Walk through the mirror
* Open the [[Battered Chest (Revendreth)|Battered Chest]]

==Description==
You've already attuned several mirrors without incident. I do believe it's time you try your hand at repairing them instead.

It's quite easy once you've found the fragments, but there are a few things of note to keep in mind.

Repaired mirrors are fragile and unpredictable. They often break with a single use, and it's never a guarantee that using one will translocate you somewhere safe.

Here's a few shards to get you started.

Restore the mirror to working order and see where it leads.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 970 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I have complete faith in your abilities.

==Completion==
You found a boon? Well done! One never truly knows what awaits beyond the mirror.

==Notes==
