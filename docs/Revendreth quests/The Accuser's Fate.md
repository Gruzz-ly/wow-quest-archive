Ride [[Myskia]] and deliver the Accuser to Sire Denathrius.
* Deliver [[the Accuser]] to the [[Sire Denathrius|Master]]

==Description==
You now stand in the presence of a Harvester, Maw Walker.

<[[Lord Chamberlain]] breathes in deeply and smiles.>

I will use the Accuser's medallion to solidify my foothold over the [[Halls of Atonement]].

Meanwhile, the Master has requested that you deliver both the Accuser and the medallion that he loaned to me.

Myskia will be along shortly to retrieve you. Do not keep the Master waiting.

==Progress==
I trust you have the medallion that I loaned to the Lord Chamberlain?

<Sire Denathrius smiles as you hand him the medallion.>

I am pleased to see that you can be trusted with great power.
