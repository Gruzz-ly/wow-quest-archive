==Objectives==
Speak to [[Ta'xera]] at The [[Night Market]].

==Description==
Listen. It is obvious you are doing this deal on [[Provisioner Dracho|Dracho's]] behalf.

I believe Ta'xera, the boss around here, would be very interested in striking a deal with someone of your talents.

She resides in the manor at the top of the hill. I recommend you don't keep her waiting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|6|43|50}}
* 2,050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I have hoped for your eventual arrival, [[Maw Walker]].

Dracho is no longer a partner of ours. Normally we would extend this punishment to you for attempting to subvert our rules. But you being who you are... changes things.

Let's strike a deal.

You bring things of interest to me directly. No middlemen. No tricks.

We provide payment and our wares when necessary. Do we have a deal?

==Notes==
;On accept

:{{Text|say|Ta'nla the Identifier|Ta'xera is expecting you, Maw Walker.}}

;On completion
:{{Text|say|Ta'xera|I'm glad we could come to an agreement, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Ta'xera|As far as that conman Dracho is concerned... we will see to it that he learns a lesson from this ordeal.}}
