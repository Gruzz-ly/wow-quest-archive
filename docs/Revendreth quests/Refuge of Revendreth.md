==Objectives==
Gather your allies.
* Meet with [[Theotar]]
* Meet with [[the Accuser]]
* Meet with [[General Draven]]

==Description==
[[Sinfall]] is more than a ruin. It was once a place of dark magic and experimentation.

When the [[Light]] retaliated and scorched the [[Ember Ward]], the walls of this place stood. It is fortified, supplied, and filled with secrets. A perfect staging ground for our upcoming conflict.

But first, take me to meet these allies who led you to [[Vorpalia]]. We must take stock of what resources we have to work with.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|75|30}}
* 970 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So few left, but we will make do.

==Notes==
Follow the prince just down the stairs to [[Theotar]]:
: ''The two greet each other heartily.''
:{{text|say|Theotar|My Prince!}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Theotar! My old friend. I am so happy to see you. And I see you managed to get your shirt off...}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|You as well. I could grate carrots on those ribs of yours.}}
: ''Theotar chuckles.''
:{{text|say|Theotar|I sent out the call to any who survived. We have quite a gathering collecting here.}}

Keep heading downstairs to reach [[The Accuser]]:
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Renathal.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Accuser. Thank you for sending this Maw Walker to find us.}}
: ''As Renathal moves on, the Accuser steps up to [[The Curator (venthyr)|the Curator]], sympathy in her tone.''
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Curator...}}
: ''The Curator tries to reassure her with insistence, although her voice is unsettled.''
:{{text|say|The Curator|I am fine. I will be fine.}}

Head into the big room to find [[General Draven]]:
:{{text|say|General Draven|My liege.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Draven! This is more than I could have hoped for. Report.}}
: ''Draven turns and walks with Renathal as they speak.''
:{{text|say|General Draven|At Theotar's request, we moved what remains of our forces here to Sinfall.}}
:{{text|say|General Draven|There are far less of us than we had in our last assault.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Gather the forces, we attack soon. I have a plan, but we must act swiftly before Denathrius learns of my escape.}}

This concludes the "The Prince and the Tower" chapter of [[The Master of Revendreth]], and the "Prince Renathal" chapter of the [[Revendreth storyline]]. The campaign concludes with [[Blinded By The Light]].
