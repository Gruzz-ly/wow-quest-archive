==Objectives==
Subjugate the Abused Soul.
* [[Abused Soul]] subjugated
* [[Shattered Soul]] slain

==Description==
The [[soul]]s have suffered tremendously under the [[Lord Chamberlain]].

We [[venthyr]] subjugate souls to our will so that we may lead each to the absolution it requires--willing or not.

The [[Lord Chamberlain]], however, has been using our relics and rituals to abuse the souls under his authority. He binds the souls to their [[sinstone]]s, perverting their very essence!

Use these ritual chains on the abused soul and subjugate it to your will. We must attempt to absolve it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|50|54|40}}
* 11,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[The Avowed]]

==Progress==
Every lost soul is a tragedy.

==Completion==
That soul is now lost forever. Such wasted potential...

The Lord Chamberlain will answer for this offense.

==Notes==
