==Objectives==
Throw Filthy Rubble into the muck pool.
* [[Filthy Rubble]] thrown (6)

==Description==
This muck pool is all out of order. The [[anima]] shortage has taken its toll here for sure.

You see, the pools require filth and fiber to grow [[dredger]]s effectively. The problem is every time I try to treat the pool, the dang [[devourer]]s are on my back!

Now the untreated muck is starting to coagulate into these [[elemental]]s! Can you go and toss some of the filthy rubble into the pool to restore it?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Is the muck stable?

==Completion==
I can smell it from here. Thanks for that, <name>.

==Progression==
