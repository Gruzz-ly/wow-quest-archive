==Objectives==
Meet [[Rendle]] in the [[Dredgewood]].

==Description==
Right. So, 'em [[devourer]]s are going to start creepin' out of the [[Endmire]] soon.

And with the [[anima]] drought puttin' the squeeze to the fangs... well... we ain't gettin' help from them until it's too late.

Us [[dredger]]s could use someone in your line of work. Professional destroyer as it were.

If you can spare the time, meet me out at the Dredgewood. We'll scoop up a couple of lads and see if we can't make a stand.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|52|70}}
* 970 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I see you decided to get your hands dirty and join us gents in the labor pool.

==Notes==
After making it to the [[Decimated Crossroad]] during [[On The Road Again]], [[Rendle]] starts this optional quest chain.

On accept, Rendle silently runs off to the southeast.
