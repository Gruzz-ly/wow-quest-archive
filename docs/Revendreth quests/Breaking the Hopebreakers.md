==Objectives==
Use the Concentrated Anima Vial to defeat the hopebreakers in [[Dredhollow]].
* [[Hopebreaker Marku]] slain {{co|43.5|79.7|Revendreth}}
* [[Hopebreaker Vilstav]] slain {{co|40.2|74.1|Revendreth}}
* [[Hopebreaker Mursa]] slain {{co|41.3|78.8|Revendreth}}
* [[Concentrated Anima Vial]] (provided)
*Speak with the Accuser at the Fearstalker's Manor.

==Description==
[[The Fearstalker]] has surely sent her [[hunter]]s across the entirety of the [[Banewood]] in search of us, <name>.

[[General Draven|Draven]] informed me that some of her top hunters are scouring Dredhollow as we speak. We can use this to our advantage. Slaying them should get her attention.

<[[The Accuser]] hands you a collection of bright red vials>

Throw these on her hunters. It should draw the attention of the [[devourer]]s infesting this place.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Vicious Dredblade
|Nimble Hopebreaker's Rapier
|Stalwart Hopebreaker's Rapier

}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|51|1|20}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are the hunters dealt with?

==Completion==
Sounds like it worked better than expected. 

Perfect. The Fearstalker stands no chance.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|General Draven|Your mission is critical. The trap must be set properly if we hope to succeed.}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|We will meet you at the manor in the village rear.}} (the spoken line differs: We will await you at the manor.)

Target the named mob and use the quest item to spawn a handful of [[Lured Mite]]s that will stack the Leeched debuff on the target:
:{{Abilities|Leeched|Damage taken increased by 20%. Damage done decreased by 15%.|id=327624|icon=spell_shadow_soulleech_2|notes=60 sec duration. Stacks five times.}}

;Marku
:{{text|say|Hopebreaker Marku|Ugh. I can not get any readings on them.}}
:{{text|say|Hopebreaker Marku|Haha! First blood will be mine!}}
:{{text|say|Hopebreaker Marku|This fate is better than the wrath you face...}}
;Vilstav
:{{text|say|Hopebreaker Vilstav|Pain, what do you sense? The Maw Walker must be close.}}
:{{text|say|Hopebreaker Vilstav|Right into my lap! Your head will serve me nicely.}}
:{{text|say|Hopebreaker Vilstav|She... will end you.}}
;Mursa:
:{{text|say|Hopebreaker Mursa|Have you seen the Maw Walker? Speak now or I bleed you dry!}}
:{{text|say|Hopebreaker Mursa|It seems the prey has foolishly sought their predator!}}
:{{text|say|Hopebreaker Mursa|I was one of the best... forgive me, master.}}

Once the third Hopebreaker has been killed:
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|By slaying my hopebreakers, you reveal your location to me. Your end comes.}}
:{{text|say|General Draven|Our scouts have spotted the Fearstalker on the road to Dredhollow. Finish your preparations quickly.}}

On completion of all three:
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|I grow tired of this farce. Show yourselves, and I will grant you the mercy of a swift end.}}
:{{text|say|General Draven|The time is upon us. Troops, hold the line.}}
