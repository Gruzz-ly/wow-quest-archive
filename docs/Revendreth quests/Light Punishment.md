==Objectives==
Free 5 Blistering Outcasts.
* [[Blistering Outcast]]s freed (5)

==Description==
The reasons we were banished here differ, but our goal once we arrive is always the same--to avoid becoming ash.

The [[Shrouded]] control the areas shaded from [[Light]]. Those that trespass within their stronghold are made to suffer. Our flesh blisters and burns, yet we do not die. Instead, our minds descend into madness from the pain.

I do not claim to know the crimes of those trapped within the Light, but I know this is not the [[Maw]]. It is not our role to punish.

Free the others as you have freed me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|25|90}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Penance, not punishment. It seems the [[Denathrius|Master]] has forgotten the difference.

==Completion==
You freed them, yes? Let us hope they found some small sliver of respite, where the Light cannot reach.

==Notes==
Just like before, click on three [[Mirror Trap]]s with each outcast.
