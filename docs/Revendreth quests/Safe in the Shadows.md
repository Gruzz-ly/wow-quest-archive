==Objectives==
Find out what happened to [[Sabina]]'s companions.
* Find Sabina's companions (3)
* Search for clues

==Description==
I cannot recollect what happened. Perhaps the [[Light]] has burdened my memory? Who knows how long I've been out here...

The last thing I remember before things went dark... my companions and I had finally found refuge in the shadows. I worry for their well-being.

So long as my assailants remain at large, my companions could be in danger. Will you find them and ensure they're still safe in the shadows?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|25|90}}
* 13,650 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Have you found them?

==Completion==
They've perished? Are you sure? Who could have done something so cruel...

==Notes==
Find the dead venthyr - [[Remus]], [[Lenusa]], and [[Miron]]. Next to them are a [[Light Satchel]], [[Tattered Journal (Revendreth)|Tattered Journal]], and [[Stained Dagger]].

;Light Satchel
:<Despite Sabina's claims of being robbed, the contents within have not been disturbed.>

;Tattered Journal
:We have yet to find sanctuary, though not for a lack of trying.

:We're all freeing the effects of the Light, though Sabina seems to struggle most. She hasn't been herself lately, often staring into the distance, repeating words...

:We need to find shelter soon, or I fear she will turn to ash.

;Stained Dagger
:<The hilt is engraved with a monogram of the letter S.>

==Progression==
