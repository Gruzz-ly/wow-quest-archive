==Objectives==
Collect the 3 Hidden Sinstone Fragments.
* [[Hidden Sinstone Fragment]]s found (3)
*Meet Echelon in the Halls of Atonement courtyard.

==Description==
[[Inquisitor Vilhelm]] has taken exceptional precautions to protect his sinstone.

Broken into several pieces and hidden from sight, he believed his sinstone would be safe from us.

But his plan had the same weakness as most: he trusted weak-willed underlings.

I "interrogated" several [[dredger]]s to learn where they helped the inquisitor hide the broken fragments of his sinstone.

Find all the fragments and bring them to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<As Echelon holds the sinstone fragments, anima binds draw the pieces into one another, reforming into a completed sinstone.>

We are ready to proceed.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Echelon|Inquisitor Vilhelm hid the pieces of his sinstone along the path above. Find them!}}
:{{text|say|Echelon|I will find the inquisitor.}}

Just to the north is a [[Disheveled Monument]] at {{co|67.8|51.6|Revendreth}} guarded by a [[Soul Monitor]]:
:{{text|say|Temel|Lazy caretakers! That monument is practically falling over!}}

Destroy the monument, dig up the Freshly Dug Dirt, then loot the [[Hidden Sinstone Fragment]].

To the west are some [[Ritual Candle]]s on an altar at {{co|65.3|51.1|Revendreth}} guarded by an [[Avowed Witness]].
:{{text|say|Temel|What curious candles...}}

Destroy all four candles to reveal the Hidden Sinstone Fragment.

Further north, two [[Frantic Mason]]s at {{co|64.9|48.4|Revendreth}} are working on some [[Piled Planks]]:
:{{text|say|Temel|Dredgers... always making messes!}}

Kill the masons, destroy the planks, reveal the [[Hidden Cache]], and loot the last fragment.

Head north and Echelon will land:
:{{text|say|Echelon|Inquisitor Vilhelm is close. And you are slow.}}
