==Objectives==
Search enemies or discarded bottles in the [[Dredgewood]] for an armor dye.
* [[Vial of Blue Muck Dye]]

==Description==
If ye look around the muck pool I am sure you will find an armor dye. It might be nice to have the option to dye me belt a different color.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find one?

==Completion==
We dredgers are an adaptable lot. If you find other dyes we will have options to dye my belt or even a doublet if you find one. Also, we be good at follicle control, so if you find any fetching posters of good lookin' folk give it to me and I will learn to grow mine to match.
