==Objectives==
Deliver [[Mistress Mihaela|Mihaela]]'s Note to the [[Lord Chamberlain]].
*[[Plea of Darkhaven]] (provided)

==Description==
You come during strange times. Every day the tithes we must pay to the Tithelord increase, and our ability to get [[anima]] dwindles. 

What [[soul]]s we have to work with here are near their final judgement and we lack the resources to harvest them without endangering the hamlet.

If you have the ear of Lord Chamberlain then you might be able to pass a message to the Master himself. 

Here, take this letter. Please see it makes it to the hands of the Chamberlain.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|52|70}}
* 970 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh, the peasants have asked for help have they? 

Those who are loyal would know that sacrifices are essential to the survival of Revendreth. Yes, these are dark times with anima and new souls both being in short supply. 

But we must all do our part, no matter how painful.

==Notes==
Lord Chamberlain is waiting on Darkhaven's flight master platform, where he has been joined by [[General Grashaal]], [[General Kaal]], and [[Myskia]].

==Progression==
{{The Master}}
