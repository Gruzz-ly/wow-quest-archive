==Objectives==
Introduce yourself to [[Archivist Fane]].

==Description==
Well, our disguises are superfluous now. We will not be welcome after disrupting their depraved ritual.

Despite what we've observed here, some steadfast [[venthyr]] do still remain within these halls. Those who have not forsaken our vocation, and carry on with our calling.

Archivist Fane is one such as these. Aid his endeavors however you can. We will need his insight to loosen the [[Lord Chamberlain]]'s grip over these halls.

I must tend to [[Gresit]]. He has much to learn.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|52|70}}
* 1,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Depraved Judge|Some very angry judges]] recently passed through here.

<Archivist Fane grins.>

Tell me everything you did to antagonize them. Don't skip a single detail!
