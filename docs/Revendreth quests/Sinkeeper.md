==Objectives==
Use the [[Bell of Remembrance#Quest item]] to beckon a soul from the [[Crypt of the Forgotten]]. Then, deem the soul's fate.
* [[Forgotten Soul|Soul]] processed

==Description==
This is a Bell of Remembrance. Before the recent... "events" we used them to beckon souls from the Crypt of the Forgotten to deem their fate.

If they are less arrogant than they were before, they may continue in the process. If not, they must spend additional time in the crypt.

Let's put this one to use, shall we? It's pretty beat up, lets hope we can get at least one use out of it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let's put this bell to use.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. You have helped that soul, even if it does not feel like it.

==Notes==
*Completing this quest will allow you to loot an additional [[Bell of Remembrance#Repeatable]] each day for a chance at a [[Satchel of Forgotten Heirlooms]].

:{{text|say|[[Sinkeeper Mourana]]|Ring the bell, <name>. It will call to a soul who needs to be processed.}}

:{{text|say|[[Forgotten Soul]]|Why do you call?}}
A soul emerges from the crypt. Speak to it:
:Is it you who is going to decide my fate?
:{{gossip|Forgotten one. How do you see yourself?}}
Its response can be one of the following:
*I am broken and forgotten. But that is not the end of my tale.
*I no longer define my worth by the judgment of others. To walk my own path is my destiny.
*The cosmos is infinite. I am but a speck of dust on its grand tapestry.
*The crimes I committed on the mortal realm haunt me. I seek repentance.
*Ha. How do you see me, mortal? I will be reborn. The [[Shadowlands]] will fear my name.
*Insolent peasant. Speak to me with dignity. I used to be worshiped!
*<The Forgotten Soul turns their head, refusing to speak.>
*Those venthyr couldn't break me if they tried. I razed entire nations in the name of my king. I will endure.
:{{gossip|You are too arrogant to proceed. Back into the crypt with you.}}
:{{gossip|You have improved greatly. Take this one to the [[Accuser]] for further repentance.}}
If you choose the first option, the soul will return to the crypt and say one of the following:
*{{text|say|What?! I thought I had improved...}}
*{{text|say|You'll regret this. Damn you!}}
If you choose the second option:
:''One of the two [[Crypt Watcher]]s escorts the soul away.''
:{{text|say|Crypt Watcher|Come with me, forgotten one. The Accuser will help elevate you even further.}}
Additionally, Sinkeeper Mourana's response will change based on how your answer relates to the soul's dialogue. This has no effect on the quest.
*{{text|say|Sinkeeper Mourana|I deemed their fate the same. Excellent intuition, <name>.}}
*{{text|say|Sinkeeper Mourana|Unorthodox decision. I'll trust your judgment this time, <name>.}}
