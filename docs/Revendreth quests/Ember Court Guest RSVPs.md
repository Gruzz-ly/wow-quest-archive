==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lord Garridan]] to see your Guest List, then meet Cryptkeeper Kassir to earn his RSVP.
*Review the Guest List
*Ask [[Lady Ilinca]] for more information (Optional)
*Complete the requirement to meet [[Cryptkeeper Kassir]]
*Speak with Cryptkeeper Kassir outside the [[Halls of Atonement]].

==Description==
[[Prince Renathal]] will wish to invite certain guests to each [[Ember Court]].

In the future, we'll be able to adjust the guest list to make it easier to please everyone in attendance. But, we should follow the Prince's lead on this first one.

Work with Lord Garridan and Lady Ilinca to ensure that Cryptkeeper Kassir is able to attend and returns his RSVP.

If you haven't met Cryptkeeper Kassir yet in your adventures, you may need to introduce yourself before he'll listen to you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What can a humble cryptkeeper do for the mighty [[Maw Walker]]?

==Completion==
The prince is wise to hold court. A timeless tradition of influence and prestige in this realm.

==Notes==
*The "requirement to meet Cryptkeeper Kassir" is completion of [[Rebuilding Temel]]. It's part of a questline that begins with [[An Abuse of Power]] inside [[Absolution Crypt]].

;On accept
:{{text|say|Temel|I am very familiar with our first guest, so I know exactly what type of court he will like!}}
:{{text|say|Temel|Coordinate with our staff to acquire the contracts and RSVPs, and I'll take care of the rest!}}

;Speaking to [[Lord Garridan]]
:''The guest list UI pops up, and you receive [[Ember Court Guest List]]. Cryptkeeper Kassir will be shown as either "Undiscovered" or "No RSVP," depending on whether you've completed the questing requirement.''
:{{text|say|Lord Garridan|We have not yet received Cryptkeeper Kassir's RSVP.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Garridan|Would you kindly visit him and resolve whatever is preventing his attendance?}}
:{{text|say|[[Lady Ilinca]]|According to my records, he can usually be found near the crypts at the [[Halls of Atonement]].}}
:{{text|say|Lady Ilinca|I am happy to provide you further information if required. Simply ask.}}

;On approach
:{{text|say|Cryptkeeper Kassir|Who goes there? Show yourself!}}

==Progression==
