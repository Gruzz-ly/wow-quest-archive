'''A Plea to Revendreth''' begins the final of the four level-up chapters of the [[Shadowlands campaign]].

==Objectives==
Journey to [[Revendreth]].
* Activate the gateway to Revendreth {{co|35.3|51.4|Oribos|1}}
* Speak to Roh-Avonavi to Travel to Revendreth
*Speak with Rendle.

==Description==
Revendreth is quite possibly the most... efficient... realm at extracting [[anima]]. Perhaps they can lend aid where others cannot. 

Know that while [[soul]]s sometimes return from Revendreth, they are never the same when they do. It is a dark realm, where those the [[Arbiter]] deems worthy of a chance of redemption are sent.

Their path, however, is not an easy one.

Kah-Sher will assist you in opening the gateway to Revendreth. Meet him in the Ring of Transference.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|52|70}}
* 970 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Sorry for the state of things. Usually a [[venthyr]] would be here to greet you. Been a while since we seen anyone come through that gate.

All good, though, as I know the welcome speech better than a good mornin' whipping.

==Notes==
Head to the western (9 o'clock) position of the [[Ring of Transference]] and interact with the Ancient Focus. Kah-Sher and Roh-Avonavi open the Gate to Revendreth. Speak with Roh-Avonavi:

:The way is open. You may now pass through to Revendreth.
:{{gossip|I am ready. Send me to Revendreth.}}

Players land at [[Pridefall Hamlet]] in the southeastern corner of Revendreth. As they land, a [[Stone Fiend]] alerts [[Rendle]] and [[Cudgelface]]:
:{{Text|Yell|Stone Fiend|Master! Master! The creature has arrived!}}
:{{Text|Say|Rendle|Is... is that a new soul? I ain't seen one of them in a while.}}
:{{Text|Say|Cudgelface|This one looks funny.}}
:{{Text|Say|Rendle|That's cause they is still alive I think. Don't be insensitive.}}
:{{Text|Yell|Rendle|Welcome, damned soul, to Revendreth, your last hope of redemption. Right this way and we'll get you sorted.}}

==Progression==
{{Welcome to Revendreth}}
