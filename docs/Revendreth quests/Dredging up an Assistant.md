==Objectives==
Throw the Kaja-Infused Dredger Mix into the muck pool to create your dredger butler.
*Kaja'Extreme thrown into bubbling muck pool
*[[Kaja-Infused Dredger Mix]] (provided)

==Description==
Here we go, onto the dredging part.

Just like we made that [[biggun]] here [[We're Gonna Need a Bigger Dredger|earlier]]!

I mean we don't need the [[Gem of Binding|stone of binding]] or three other [[dredger]]s, but you'll still be throwing stuff into the muck!

So it's the same.

You head to the shore with this here [[:Kaja-Infused Dredger Mix]] I whipped up for you.

Toss it into that muck pool and let's meet that new dredger butler of yours!

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Dredger Butler Certification|Binds you to the Dredger Butler Contract allowing you to call on them at any time.|id=340022|icon=inv_misc_noteblank1c}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|3|80}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]
* [[Dredger Butler's Contract]]

==Progress==
Did you throw it in? And, uh, did it work?

==Completion==
It worked! Of course I knew it would. Now what to name this guy... but first I am go'n to dismiss him so y'can test out the binding of the contract.

==Notes==
[[File:Bubbling Muck Pool.jpg|thumb|Bubbling Muck Pool]]
*A Bubbling Muck Pool appears in the muck nearby; it looks like a green-colored [[fishing pool]]. You need to stand close to it in order to use the [[Kaja-Infused Dredger Mix]].

;Description
Alright, on to the dredging part. Another of you [[mortal]]s was just here mixing the pool so we can jump right to the dredging. This will be just like makin a [[biggun]], minus the stone of binding and the need of three dredgers, but just like it since you throwing something new into the mix.

So head down to the shore with this here Kaja-Infusion and you should be good to go. What's that look for? It should be that easy, well I mean you have to throw in the potion, standing there with it won't do anything.

;Objectives
Throw the Kaja-Infused Dredger Mix into the muck pool to create a new [[dredger]].
