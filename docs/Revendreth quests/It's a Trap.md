==Objectives==
Approach [[Taskmaster Matyas|Matyas]] to start the duel. Assist Nadjia when Matyas cheats.
* [[Nadjia the Mistblade|Nadjia]]'s duel completed
*Meet Nadjia back inside the tower.

==Description==
At last, I will have my vengeance!

I am certain Matyas will flee again if he sees me first so you will need to confront him on my behalf, friend. Then, while he's distracted, I will engage him.

At that point, your obligation as my second is a formality. You must assure Matyas does not dishonor the duel and cheat. When he inevitably does, I expect you'll help me defeat him.

He's just through the portcullis there.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Nobleman's Quickblade
|Cavalier's Morningstar
|Stonevigil Rapier
|Briarbane Glaive

|Sinstealer's Staff

You will also receive:
* {{cost|75|81|60}}
* 9,700 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Matyas will apologize, or he will die.

==Completion==
I would have allowed an apology, but he chose treachery and has paid the price.

==Notes==
Open the [[Rampart Portcullis]] and attack the Taskmaster.
