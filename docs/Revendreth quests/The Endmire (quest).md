==Objectives==
Find 5 Infused Rubies.
* [[Infused Ruby (item)]] (5)

==Description==
Oi! You.

Not sure what landed you in the [[Endmire]] but I need your help.

See these torches? It's my gig to keep 'em lit. But it ain't like they runnin' on flint n' tinder.

My stash of infused rubies got hauled off by some [[devourer]]s when my back was turned. Can ya find 'em before we both get ate by one of these horrors?

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
*[[Soulguard Braziers]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|37|90|80}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Just going to be clear on this: I... HATE... THIS... GIG.

==Completion==
Much obliged. These torches keep the effects of the Endmire at bay. Even scares away the devourers for the moment. Only lasts so long though.

I miss the good ol' days of only having to worry about manifestations down here.

==Notes==
In the [[Endmire]] for [[Bottom Feeders]] and [[The Greatest Duelist]], [[Tessle the Snitch]] offers this quest.

Stolen Infused Rubies litter the ground.

==Progression==
{{Welcome to Revendreth}}
