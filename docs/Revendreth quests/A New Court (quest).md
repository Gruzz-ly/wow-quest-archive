==Description==
My dear <name>, I have heard a delightful rumor that you are considering hosting a new court in [[Sinfall]].

If that is true, you simply must permit me to recommend staff to help you host a perfect court.

<Theotar pulls long parchments out of his pockets.>

I have been developing ranked lists for every court staff position since the moment I stepped foot in Sinfall.

I do not wish to be a braggart, but courts are kind of my specialty.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|12|87}}
* 750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This court isn't going to throw itself. Let's get to work.

==Notes==
This quest becomes available once the [[A New Court]] upgrade has been researched. After recruiting the personel within Sinfall, head upstairs to the [[Spire of the Unseen Guests]].

;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Theotar|I am tingling with excitement. This news cannot wait the walk!}}

:''Theotar uses [[Door of Shadows]] in order to cross the hall, over to [[Prince Renathal]].''
:{{Text|Say|Theotar|My dear Renathal, the rumors are true. We will be hosting court here in Sinfall!}}
:{{Text|Say|Prince Renathal|I believe you started most of those rumors yourself, Theotar.}}
:{{Text|Say|Prince Renathal|Still, I too am quite pleased. Although, I will be reliant on you to refresh my knowledge of courtly etiquette.}}
:{{Text|Say|Theotar|My existence before this moment has been but a rehearsal. I will teach you everything you need to know.}}
:{{Text|Say|Theotar|First, we will require more tea. All of the tea!}}
:''Theotar uses Door of Shadows back to his usual spot.''

;Speaking to Stefan
:<Picky Stefan stops dictating to the [[Enchanted Quill|floating scroll]] nearby and looks at you.>

:Yes? Do you also have thoughts on the complex aroma of this steak?

:{{Gossip|I need you to coordinate the refreshments for our new court.}}

:{{Text|Say|Picky Stefan|Of course only the finest ingredients will be used...}}
:{{Text|Say|Picky Stefan|Fresh meats! Imported produce! Only the cleanest [[dredger]] waiters!}}
:{{Text|Say|Picky Stefan|I will be our harshest critic and strongest advocate!}}
:''Stefan runs up the nearby stairs and out of vision.''

;Speaking to Hips
:You ever see the [[Lost Chalice Band]] play music?

:Movin' stuff. Real hauntin' melodies.

:I started readin' their biography. Finally a book worth learnin' to read for!

:{{Gossip|I need you to coordinate the entertainment for our new court.}}

:{{Text|Say|Hips|I'm surprised you'd trust a dredger with a job like that.}}
:{{Text|Say|Hips|Must've been Theotar told you, yeah?}}
:{{Text|Say|Hips|That fang knows talent when he sees it. I got you covered.}}
:''Hips walks over to the nearby [[Sinfall Mirror]].''

;Speaking to Lord Garridan who can be found with a group of [[Ember Court Socialite]]s
:Ah, [[Maw Walker]]. We were just talking about you.

:To what do we owe the honor?

:{{Gossip|I need you to coordinate the guest list for our new court.}}

:{{Text|Say|Lord Garridan|It would be an honor to assist you and Prince Renathal.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lord Garridan|My extensive network of contacts and humble diplomatic skills are at your service.}}
:''Garridan turns to face the socialites.''
:{{Text|Say|Lord Garridan|And, of course, I will make certain that all of you are included on the guest list as well.}}
:''Lord Garridan walks over to the nearby Sinfall Mirror and is soon followed by the socialites.''
:{{Text|Say|Ember Court Socialite|Ooo! This is going to be the hottest court in [[Revendreth]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Ember Court Socialite|I cannot wait to tell [[Lady Lerae]] about this!}}

;Speaking to The Accuser who can be found near [[Temel]]
:There is much work yet to be done.

:{{Gossip|I need you to coordinate all of the logistics for our new court.}}

:{{Text|Say|The Accuser|I will do no such thing. The troubled souls require my full attention.}}
:{{Text|Say|The Accuser|However, if the Prince requires these duties to be performed...}}
:{{Text|Yell|The Accuser|Temel!}}
:''Temel flies closer.''
:{{Text|Say|Temel|The one and only Sin Herald, at your service, Accuser!}}
:{{Text|Say|The Accuser|Your services as the Sin Herald are not required here. You will assist the Maw Walker with coordinating a new court.}}
:{{Text|Emote|Temel looks confused for a moment, then quickly pulls a party hat off of his belt and puts it on.}}
:{{Text|Say|Temel|The Party Herald is now on duty!}}
:{{Text|Say|Temel|You can count on me, Maw Walker! I'm the best at whatever I do!}}
:{{Text|Emote|The Accuser smirks.}}
:{{Text|Say|The Accuser|Do have fun.}}

;Approaching the Party Herald in the Spire of the Unseen Servants
''Two [[Court Groundskeeper]]s are seen with Temel. One holds a torch, the other a lantern.''
:{{Text|Say|Temel|Yes to the lanterns, no to the torches.}}
:{{Text|Say|Temel|This is a respected court, not the [[Endmire]]!}}
