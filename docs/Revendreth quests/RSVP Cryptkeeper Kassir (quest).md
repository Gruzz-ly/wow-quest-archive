==Objectives==
Collect [[Atonement Crypt Key]]s from [[venthyr]] around the [[Halls of Atonement]] and open [[Atonement Crypt]]s until you find the Lost Cryptkeeper's Ring.
* [[Lost Cryptkeeper's Ring]]

==Description==
I would be most honored to attend [[Prince Renathal]]'s [[Ember Court]].

I prefer to wear my official signet ring for such prestigious occasions. It was given to me by [[the Accuser]] herself when I was first charged with my duties.

However, the [[Lord Chamberlain]]'s goons have stolen it once more.

They hide their ill-gotten gains inside of these crypts... But I have no idea which one houses my ring.

It may take some time to find Atonement Crypt Keys, but any venthyr here in the halls could have one.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Cryptkeeper Kassir]]

==Progress==
Desired objects tend to be in the last place we look, do they not? Perhaps we shall be fortunate this time.

==Completion==
My most gracious gratitudes to you, [[Maw Walker]]!

<Cryptkeeper puts the ring into his pocket and pats it comfortably.>

Now I may attend the Ember Court in my finest appearance.

I do hope the Accuser will be performing rituals there...
