'''Homegrown Help''' becomes available after upgrading the [[Ember Court]] to rank 2.

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Rendle]] in the [[Dredgewood]].

==Description==
Every good party herald needs an assistant. Which is why I have you!

But every good party herald's assistant... also needs an assistant.

Which is why I procured permission from the [[Prince Renathal|prince]] for you to create your own [[dredger]] butler. We can start him on security while we cozy up to the guests and procure the necessary reading materials on the social protocols of the different realms. He'll be entertaining the whole court in no time.

No, don't thank me. You've earned this!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|25|3|80}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You ready to get your hands dirty?

Makin' dredgers ain't pretty work.

==Notes==
*The [[Transportation Network]] mirror to [[Pridefall Hamlet]] is a quick way to travel to Rendle's location from Sinfall.

;Description
Parry Planning is tough work, that is why I have you to assist. Now I see how you are just getting started and already behind, so I procured permission for you to create your own assistant.

Seek out Rendle at the muck pool in the Dredgewood to learn about making dredgers and create an assistant up to the task.
