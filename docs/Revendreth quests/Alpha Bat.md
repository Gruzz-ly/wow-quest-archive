{{questportrait|Duskterror.jpg|Duskterror|Duskterror has gotten out of control. We need to capture her before she brings any more havoc.}}
==Objectives==
Hitch Houndmaster Loksey to the stake in the [[Grove of Terror]]. Then, weaken Duskterror to capture her.
* [[Houndmaster Loksey]] bound to the stake (Optional) {{co|52.4|76.5|Revendreth}}
* [[Duskterror]] captured

==Description==
[[Dredbat]]s are quite useful to us. We make them just like [[stoneborn]], but they lack their same... intelligence. With very little direction, they strike fear into stubborn [[soul]]'s hearts.

With the [[anima]] drought, our dominion over them has waned.  One, Duskterror, has wreaked the most havoc.

This presents us with an opportunity. Take this soul and draw her in. When she's weak, we can capture her for our own purposes.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
* [[Dredwing Shroud]]
* {{cost|25|50|60}}
* 9,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is Duskterror captured?

==Completion==
Now that Duskterror is captured, we have a little more control over these grounds.

==Notes==
Head southeast to the clearing. Interact with the [[Stake (Revendreth)|Stake]] to lash Loskey to it:
:{{text|say|Houndmaster Loksey|What now? More... dear gods what is that creature?!}}
:''Dreadbane flies in.''

Attack Dreadbane until Sergio intervenes:
:{{text|say|Flockmaster Sergio|What did I tell you? We need her alive. I will handle this, mortal.}}
:{{text|say|Flockmaster Sergio|There. See how a professional works? I'll meet you back at camp. I must go put this beast to work.}}

==Progression==
{{The Penitent Hunt}}
