==Description==
Well, you ain't like the others. Usually you're supposed to be dead before you come here. Ah well. A sin is a sin and a stone is a stone, as it goes.

Let's get you sorted out with your sinstone. This way, if you please.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|63|60}}
* 3,900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Hopefully these wretched creatures did not bore you with their inane babble.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''[[Rendle]] and [[Cudgelface]] walk north.
:{{Text|Say|Rendle|As a newly arrived soul you should know this is a place of torment and of penance.}}
:{{Text|Say|Rendle|Not to fear though, for as you see by these many sinstones, the road to redemption is possible.}}
:{{Text|Say|Rendle|Each of these sinstones represents a soul who has come to this place and cleansed themselves of their sins, eventually moving on from this place or accepting the role of a [[venthyr]].}}

Speak with [[Maneo]]:
:Ah, <name>. I have seen your name upon many sinstones of newly arrived souls. You have led a most interesting life, so far.
:{{gossip|Sinstone?}}
:A sinstone is a manifestation of the accumulated burdens of your life wrought in stone.
:I have none for you though, as your life is not yet complete. You still have time to... correct... some of your ways.
:{{gossip|What are you?}}
:I was once a soul, like you, though from a much different time and place. In life, I committed unspeakable horrors in the name of justice, and for my crimes was sentenced to this place.
:It was only after eons of service, of suffering, of penance that the Master saw me fit enough to join the ranks of the venthyr. Now I serve as a tormenter and teacher. We venthyr cleanse souls and harvest sins.

Interact with the [[Sinstone (object)|Sinstone]]:
{{book|Sinstone|content=
Here now we record the deeds of the dead upon a canvas of stone. 

The burdens of a soul, hardened by regret and dark paths chosen, are things wrought through time and can often appear eternal to mortals. 

But those who are eternal know that even letters chiseled in stone will fade and even deeds believed unforgivable can be atoned for.}}

Rendle and Cudgelface move southwest to a statue of the master.
:{{text|say|Rendle|Final judgement comes from the Master. It is he who commands this place. It is he who embraces souls to become venthyr, the tormentors and eaters of sin.}}

Interact with [[The Master (object)|The Master]] marker in front of it:
{{Book|The Master|content=
Sire [[Denathrius]]

Master of [[Revendreth]]

King of the Venthyr

First Blooded

Commander of the [[Stoneborn]]

The Fangs of the [[Shadowlands]]

Behold his greatness and weep, for it is by his grace that all you see before you exists.

Follow Culdgelface and Rendle south to the [[Defiant Soul]]:
:{{text|say|Rendle|There are always those few who are unwilling to work for redemption.}}
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|Or don't agree with their sinstone.}}
:{{text|say|Rendle|Or are simply just a bunch of bad apples.}}
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|Thems get the boot. Down to the Maw and never to come back. Take this poor soul for example. He's on his final warning.}}
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|Won't even admit he did somethin' wrong. Still thinks he's someone important.}}

The Defiant Soul is being worked on by a [[Desperate Venthyr]], with a [[Clemency Enforcer]] standing watch. Interact with the soul:
:I will not submit. Tell the Master when you see him! I defy him. I defy all of you. I was a ruler! I am above all of you filthy peasants and creatures.
:{{text|yell|Lord Chamberlain|Hold, creatures. This is a guest, not a charge.}}
:{{text|say|Rendle|Quick, make yaself presentable. Lord Chamberlain is here.}}

Follow Rendle and Cudgelface to the [[Lord Chamberlain]], who has just pulled up in a [[Darkhaven Carriage]].
