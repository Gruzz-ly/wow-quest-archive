==Objectives==
Discover the secrets of [[Taskmaster Matyas]]'s efforts in [[Feeders' Thicket|Feeder's Thicket]].
* [[Cobwobble]] questioned
* [[Dobwobble]] questioned
* [[Slobwobble]] questioned
* Sinstones collected (3)

==Description==
Oh hello mortal. You have a real knack for arriving at the most opportune times. I wonder what Taskmaster Matyas wants with you. Curious.

As for me, again Matyas has used my sinstone against me. I was already enraged that he caged me and I assure you that this latest attack will not go unanswered. Yet, while he has my sinstone I am unable to act against him directly. So we must remedy that.

You question the laborers and I will read this journal while I regain my strength.
