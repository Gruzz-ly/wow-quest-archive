==Objectives==
Collect 100 Sinstone Records.
* [[Sinstone Records]] (100)

==Description==
You said [[Inquisitor Traian]] oversaw the ritual?

<Archivist Fane searches the massive archives in this chamber.>

We archivists maintain strict records of every [[soul]] that passes through these halls.

Or at least we're supposed to. The [[sinstone]]s of powerful [[venthyr]] tend to go "missing."

<Archivist Fane rolls his eyes.>

I don't see his sinstone here. He might've stolen it, or someone could be hoarding it as blackmail.

Help me complete my archives, and I'll get you any sinstone you need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|50|54|40}}
* 11,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[The Avowed]]

==Progress==
Sinstones are the most powerful weapon in Revendreth.

==Completion==
<Archivist Fane's eyes light up when you hand him the archives.>

This is a lot of potential leverage...
