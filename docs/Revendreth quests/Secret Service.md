The [[Servant's Basic Kit]] is at the top of the [[Eternal Terrace Lift]]. For [[Venthyr Covenant]] members, it's right next to the [[Mirror Network]] mirror.

Interacting with the kit turns you into a [[Dredger Servant]] with the following abilities:
*{{Abilities|Serve Food|Offer up a platter of conjured food for your guests.|id=330113|icon=inv_misc_food_cooked_pabanquet_wok}}
*{{Abilities|Serve Drink|Offer up a platter of conjured drinks for your guests.|id=330123|icon=trade_archaeology_chalice_of_mountainkings}}
*{{Abilities|Clean|Scrub away at a pile of muck!|id=330275|icon=inv_misc_1h_bucket_c_01}}
*{{Abilities|Left Hook|Punches your target, inflicting Physical damage.|id=330269|icon=ability_rogue_kidneyshot}}
*{{Abilities|Hurry!|Increases your movement speed by 80% for 4 sec.|id=330320|icon=spell_fire_burningspeed}}

Elite [[Stone Legion Security]] patrol the pathways in the area. Each of them has a {{Abilities|Guest List|id=323073|icon=inv_inscription_parchment}} that allows them to see through your disguise.

Occasionally a [[Muck Rat]] will spawn and attack you, prompting a [[Carousing Aristocrat]] or [[Noble Reveler]] to yell:
:{{text|yell|A rodent?! What a vile thing to have at party.{{sic}} Get rid of it at once!}}

Partygoers will randomly gain the {{Abilities|Needs Food|id=330086|icon=inv_misc_food_cooked_pabanquet_wok}} or {{Abilities|Needs Drink|id=330087|icon=trade_archaeology_chalice_of_mountainkings}} buff, shown by yellow or red lines flashing above their heads. Serving a guest who needs food or drink will increase your progress. They may also say one of the following:
*{{text|say|I suppose this will do. Now begone!}}
*{{text|say|No need to linger, you've done your job.}}
*{{text|say|[[The Countess]] always serves such interesting fare.}}
*{{Text|say|This had better be worth the wait.}}
*{{text|say|Why are you still standing here? Shoo!}}
*{{text|say|Your service is no longer required.}}
