'''Redemption for the Redeemer''' is the traditional post-final-boss quest, this time for defeating [[Sire Denathrius (tactics)|Sire Denathrius]] in [[Castle Nathria]]. Completing the quest triggers a cutscene showing Denathrius' fate, but only if the player has also completed [[Sanguine Depths: An Ally Within]].

Completing this quest actually a required part of the overarching [[Shadowlands campaign]]. In addition to completing this quest, players must have also completed [[The Captive King]] in [[Oribos]] to be offered the next quest, [[An Echo in the Darkness]].

==Objectives==
[[File:Redemption for the Redeemer.jpg|thumb|Draven outside of Sinfall]]

Deliver [[Remornia]] to [[General Draven]] on the edge of [[Sinfall]].
* [[Remornia (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<Energies of death and innervation struggle to free themselves from the blade and consume you to your very core.>

<The bonds of warding placed on this blade by [[Prince Renathal]] will not hold for long. It should be taken to Sinfall where more permanent arrangements have been made for this prisoner.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 5x [[Collected Tithe]]
* {{cost|102|96|}}
* 18,900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Denathrius once served a noble cause. His charismatic leadership and understanding of the dark desires were instrumental in the redemption of more souls than your world has known.

Perhaps in time, he could be this again. If the right lessons were to remind him of his true purpose.

==Notes==
Draven is west of [[Sinfall]] proper (and west of the [[Spire of the Unseen Guests]]) up on the surface, looking at the isolated tower off in the distance, [[Dawnkeep]].

If the player has completed [[Sanguine Depths: An Ally Within]], a [[Shadowlands in-game cinematics|cutscene]] will play upon turning in Redemption for the Redeemer. Otherwise, the cutscene will only trigger when the player completes An Ally Within.
:''Atop an isolated tower near [[Dawnkeep]] in the [[Ember Ward]], [[Prince Renathal]] and the [[naaru]] [[Z'rali]] are looking at [[Remornia]], with [[Denathrius|Denathrius's]] essence contained in it.''
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|You were ever fond of saying that the venthyr do not destroy. We educate.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|It is time you were reminded of Revendreth's noble purpose.}}
:{{text|say|Z'rali|Shall we begin?}}
:''Denathrius's voice echoes from Remornia.''
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|You cannot bind me here!}}
:''Z'rali shines her Light at the two mirrors.''
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|I am eternal!}}
:''Two dredgers aim mirrors of reflected Light at the sword.''
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|I am your MASTER!}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|I... AM... REVENDRETH!}}
:''The top of the tower explodes in a yellow ball of Light, silencing Denathrius.''
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|[[The Master of Lies|Remember this lesson.]]}}

On the other end of the cutscene, the player will be standing atop the tower. Renathal has some unique gossip here:
:It will take time. Time the likes of which your kind have yet to measure. 
:But in that time, I see my oldest friend, my closest confidant, and my greatest Master stepping forth from this pinnacle of lecture, his true purpose once again affirmed.

The blood mirror will send players back to where they turned in to Draven.
