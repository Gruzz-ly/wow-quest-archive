==Objectives==
Deliver the missive to [[Duchess Mynx]] in [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].
*[[A Defector's Request]] (provided)

==Description==
<Unrolling the scroll, you can make out that it's a coded arms requisition from the Maldraxxi of [[Death's End]] to their [[venthyr]] allies... all servants of the [[Jailer]].

Surely someone among the [[Death's Advance]] in Korthia will be able to help you fully break the code and learn exactly what they were planning.>

==Rewards==
Unlocks the Covenant mission [[Locating the Traitors' Cache]]

==Completion==
<A smile creeps across Duchess Mynx's face as she looks over the scroll you provided. A moment later, an echoing laugh bursts from her.>

The force of the Jailer use such pathetic codes! This scroll of yours doesn't say where, but it seems there's a weapons cache ready to be claimed. A team of your allies should be able to investigate and retrieve it without too much trouble.

==Patch changes==
