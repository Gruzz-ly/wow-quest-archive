==Objectives==
Defeat [[Cryptkeeper Kassir]] to earn Temel's obedience.
* [[Temel]] recruited {{co|71.5|54.4|Revendreth}}
*Meet Echelon outside the Halls of Atonement.

==Description==
<Before flying away, [[Echelon]] shouted an additional command.>

Expropriate Temel as well. He will know how to exploit the sinstone properly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 9,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Temel will not come willingly.

==Completion==
<Echelon eyes Temel suspiciously.>

I never liked this runt.

==Notes==
On [[Inquisitor Stelia's Sinstone]], [[Echelon]] will drop the player off outside the [[Halls of Atonement]], starting this quest automatically. In addition, [[Chiselgrump]] will start an optional, but useful side quest: [[It Used to Be Quiet Here]].

Head east to find [[Cryptkeeper Kassir]], holding [[Temel]]. Aggro Kassir:
:{{text|say|Cryptkeeper Kassir|I cannot allow you to take Temel. You do not understand his power.}}
:{{text|say|Temel|Yeah, I'm not going anywhere with you!}}

Get Kassir to 15%:
:{{text|say|Cryptkeeper Kassir|I surrender! Temel, you must obey the Maw Walker now.}}
:{{text|say|Cryptkeeper Kassir|But heed my warning, Maw Walker... Denathrius has lied to you.}}
:{{text|say|Temel|Let's get this over with... master.}}

==Progression==
{{The Accuser}}
