==Objectives==
Complete the hunting ritual at [[Wanecrypt Hill]].
* [[Houndmaster Loksey]]'s [[anima]] siphoned {{co|48.0|70.1|Revendreth}}
* Hunt signaled
*[[Hollowed Dredbat Fang]] (provided)

==Description==
One step remains until we may begin the Penitent Hunt.

You and the other [[hunter]]s will first siphon a small amount of [[anima]] from the souls.  It will come with ease. The soul's time in the [[Grove of Terror]] causes trace anima to release.

This anima helps us [[venthyr]] in tracking the prey's fear.

I also ask that you do us the honor of signaling the hunt.

<[[The Fearstalker]] hands you an anima stake and a hollowed [[dredbat]] fang.>

Use these to complete the task.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|75|30}}
* 3,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The ceremony must continue.

==Completion==
Well done. Perhaps in death you will make a fine hunter.

I can practically taste the fear we will inflict.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|Siphon the anima from Houndmaster Loksey, Maw Walker.}}

Interact with [[Houndmaster Loksey]]:
:{{text|say|Houndmaster Loksey|No... I must resist!}}
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|Welcome, privileged souls. Your pride and arrogance blinds you.}}
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|Maw Walker, use the hollowed fang to signal the hunt's beginning.}}

Dismount and use the [[Hollowed Dredbat Fang]]:
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|Begone prideful souls. Let your fear drive you!}}
:''The nearby souls and the Accuser run away.''

==Progression==
{{The Penitent Hunt}}

*Name: '''Let the Sin Begin'''.

;Objectives
* [[King Adagar]]'s [[anima]] siphoned
* [[Krusher]] infused

;Description
There is one more step we must complete until we may begin the hunt.

You and the other [[hunter]]s will siphon the trace anima that has simmered up during their time in the [[Grove of Terror]] to wake your [[gargon]]s. I have set aside one for you, his name is Krusher.

<[[The Fearstalker]] hands you an anima stake and a hollowed [[dredbat]] fang>

These tools are essential to the ceremony.
