==Objectives==
Follow [[the Accuser]] through the mirror and witness the truth of [[Revendreth]].
* Mirror entered
* Truth witnessed
* Accuser protected (0/100%)
* [[Castle Nathria]] escaped

==Description==
I sent [[the Fearstalker]] far from here with that trap--buying us some time.

On the other side of this mirror lies the depths of [[Castle Nathria]], the fortress of [[Denathrius]] himself. There, a meeting between Denathrius and one of his lackeys is about to take place.

Join me through the mirror, <name>. You shall see the truth of this "drought" first hand.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|51|1|20}}
* 9,700 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We barely made it. Denathrius will surely be on our trail soon.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Follow me, Maw Walker. You will see which side you have been fighting for.}}

Head through the [[Forgotten Mirror]]. On the other side is the [[Royal Cellars]] of [[Castle Nathria]]:
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Watch. Our voice of the people is doing anything but serving Revendreth.}}

Speak with the Accuser:
:Keep your head down, we don't want them to see us.
:{{gossip|I am ready.}}

A cutscene begins:
:''Denathrius and Inverva Darkvein are walking along a path.''
:{{text|say|Lady Inerva Darkvein|As I explained before, Sire, we cannot rush such a delicate process.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Inerva Darkvein|Anima harvesting demands finesse.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|Our friend grows... impatient.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|Recent events require us to expedite our efforts.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|See it done, Inerva.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Inerva Darkvein|But master, I--}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|Well, what have we here?}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|You really must be more vigilant about uninvited guests, my lady.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Inerva Darkvein|Sire?}}
:''Denathrius summons a sword and launches it through the blood mirror.''
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|My defiant accuser and her hapless mortal pawn.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|It is impressive that you discovered our little secret...}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|... if a tad inconvenient.}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|You deprive your own people of anima and inflict a drought upon all of the Shadowlands!}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Why?}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|The other realms would squander our most precious resource. That won't do.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|Rest assured, this anima will serve a higher purpose.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|But I fear you will not survive to witness the glory to come.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Inerva Darkvein|I will deal with them, sire... harshly.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|Of course you will.}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Inerva Darkvein|Guards, deal with these intruders! In the Master's name!}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|I will need some time to secure us a way out of here. By my side, <name>!}}

Stay inside the larger red circle to stay buffed with Harvester's Might, a +damage dealt/-damage taken buff:
:{{Abilities|Harvester's Might|Damage taken reduced by 75%. Haste increased by 50%. Damage done increased by 50%.|id=321345|icon=ui_sigil_venthyr}}

[[Crimson Assassin]]s and [[Crimson Protector]]s spawn in waves of one or two, each worth 10% of the bar.

At 20%:
:{{text|yell|Lady Inerva Darkvein|Give up, Accuser. The Master will crush your pathetic resistance!}}

At 50%:
:{{text|yell|Lady Inerva Darkvein|Even without a medallion you still stand. Your anima will prove most useful to the sire!}}

At 100%:
:{{text|yell|The Accuser|The mirror is repaired. Go! We need to leave NOW!}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Inerva Darkvein|No! Stop them you fools!}}

The mobs keep spawning, but ignore them and run to the mirror to escape.
