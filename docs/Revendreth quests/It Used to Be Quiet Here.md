==Objectives==
Collect 8 Dredger Chisels.
* [[Dredger Chisel]] (8)

==Description==
Well... You don't look like the rest of 'em, do you?

<[[Chiselgrump]] shrugs.>

Doesn't bother me. Keep my head down and do my job, making sure these sinstones stay in good shape.

Keep breaking my tools, though.

Bring me some more chisels and I'll teach you an old [[dredger]] construction trick.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Dredger Tools]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|25|27|20}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Got those chisels yet?

==Completion==
Yeah, these'll last me awhile.

Alright, I'll show you the trick to making a barricade quickly...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Chiselgrump|Those other dredgers are careless... leave their tools just about anywhere.}}
:{{text|say|Chiselgrump|Take your time. I got plenty of work to keep me busy.}}

Find [[Dredger Chisel]]s all over the quest area.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Chiselgrump|I'll give you my spare hammer for the first one.}}
:{{text|say|Chiselgrump|But that's all you're getting from me. Find the rest yourself!}}

Chiselgrump buffs the player (for five minutes) with Dredger's Hammer, which grants a bonus ability:
:{{abilities|Construct Hasty Barricade|Construct a small barricade that increases your defenses while you stay near it. Lasts 30 sec.|range=3|notes=2 sec cast}}
