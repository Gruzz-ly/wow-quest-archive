==Objectives==
Find [[Prince Renathal]].

==Description==
Okay, do not lose focus. I can feel Renathal's presence. It is faint but I can sense he is outside of [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned|the tower]], at least.

Come, let's find him and get out of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|75|30}}
* 3,900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I recognize you. [[Azeroth]] has been very busy lately, and her champions have been very much at the forefront of events. We must talk as soon as time allows.

==Notes==
Run north across the river. Every fifteen seconds in the river, players gain another stack of Gorgoan Lament:
:{{Abilities|Gorgoan Lament|Damage taken increased by 5%. Damage inflicted increased by 5%.|id=330030|icon=ability_demonhunter_shatteredsouls}}

Across the river, Renathal is in a cage:
:{{text|say|Vorpalia|My Prince! Are you okay? Did they hurt you?}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Vorpalia? You were cast in to the Maw as well? And who is this that... wait... wait I recognize you. You... you are one of Azeroth's champions.}}

==Progression==
{{Prince Renathal}}
