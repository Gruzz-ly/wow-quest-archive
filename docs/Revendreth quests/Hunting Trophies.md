==Description==
To be a [[hopebreaker]] is to conquer all prey, not just [[soul]]s.

The [[Banewood]] is home to many dangerous creatures: [[Rotting Deathwalker|deathwalkers]], fearspinners, and the horrifying doomfangs. If you wish to really master the art of the hunt, you should be able to defeat these foes.

Bring me trophies as proof of your conquests. Then, you may just earn my respect.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|37|90|80}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]
* +200 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Have you conquered the creatures of the Banewood?

==Completion==
<Constantin examines what you have brought him>

Well done. You may make a fine hopebreaker yet.
