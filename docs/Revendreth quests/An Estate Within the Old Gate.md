==Objectives==
Deliver Theotar's Note to [[Bogdan]] within the [[Old Gate]].
* [[Theotar's Note]] (provided)

==Description==
I believe I know how we can obtain [[the Countess]]' medallion and avoid making any new enemies.

Before being cast out into the [[Light]], I held a prominent position within the Countess's court. She bestowed upon me an estate with direct access to her private chambers.

If the estate still stands, you can use it to sneak into the Countess' manor and steal the medallion without ever drawing your weapon.

Take this note to my trusted butler, Bogdan. He will provide whatever assistance you need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What is this? A note from the Duke?

==Completion==
<Bogdan reads the words quickly, his eyes welling with tears as a smile spreads across his face.>

The Duke lives? What splendid news!

==Notes==
Upon accepting the quest, you gain [[Theotar's Note]].

Clicking on Bogdan upon quest completion:
:I will do my best to ensure you are well taken care of in Duke Theotar's absence.
