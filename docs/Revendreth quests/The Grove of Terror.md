==Objectives==
Meet [[the Fearstalker]] in the [[Grove of Terror]].

==Description==
Ah, yes. You've done me a great favor in delivering [[the Accuser]], [[Maw Walker]].

To celebrate, I must insist that you take part in a sacred tradition of [[Revendreth]]: The [[Penitent Hunt]]. It is a duty we undertake to strike a humbling fear into the hearts of the most... stubborn [[soul]]s.

Fear can be a very powerful motivator for change.

Meet the Fearstalker in the Grove of Terror below. There you will prepare.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|55|5}}
* 970 [[XP]]

Welcome to the Grove of Terror.

Here you will see the beginning of the process for the anima you seek.
