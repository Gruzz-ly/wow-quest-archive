==Objectives==
Follow Laurent and collect Mirror Fragments.
* Follow [[Laurent]]
* [[Mirror Fragment]] collected
* Follow Laurent
* Mirror Fragment collected
* Follow Laurent
* Mirror Fragment collected

==Description==
Forgive me. I don't mean to appear ungrateful, but my mirror fragments are missing.

I shouldn't be surprised, really. They're quite powerful and I'm sure the miscreants out here would be happy to get their hands on them.

Nonetheless, I will not let this deter me.

The [[Denathrius|Master]] sends his stone servants to smash any mirrors erected in this ward, so we should have no trouble finding fragments nearby.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|38|25|90}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Simone shouldn't be here!

==Completion==
This must be some sort of mistake!

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Laurent|Just a moment. I will need my cloak before we head into the Light.}}
:''Laurent puts on his cloak.''
:{{Text|say|Laurent|Much better, though it does have a putrid stench.}}
:''Laurent starts walking.''
:{{Text|say|Laurent|Now, come along. I will show you how to locate mirror fragments.}}
:{{Text|say|Laurent|The only thing this wretched Light is good for is making the fragments easier to find.}}
:{{Text|say|Laurent|Ah, here is one. Buried in the ash.}}

Pick up the fragment.
:{{Text|say|Laurent|To the untrained eye, all mirror shards look identical, but I can tell by the glint alone where that shard came from.}}
:{{Text|say|Laurent|Mirrors are a magical network of sorts.}}
:{{Text|say|Laurent|Travel between them is possible, so long as each is made from the same type of glass.}}
:{{Text|say|Laurent|Up ahead, I see another!}}

Pick up the fragment.
:{{Text|say|Laurent|Fragments should never be discarded. They can be used to repair nearly any broken mirror.}}
:{{Text|say|Laurent|You can not always be certain where the mirror will take you, but anywhere would be better than here.}}
:{{Text|say|Laurent|Over there! You see it, do you not?}}

Pick up the final fragment.
:{{Text|say|Laurent|Well done! You certainly have an eye for this.}}
:{{Text|say|Laurent|We will be out of here in no time at...}}
:{{Text|say|Laurent|Simone?! What is she doing out here?}}
:''Laurent runs towards [[Simone]].''
