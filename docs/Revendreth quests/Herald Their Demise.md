==Objectives==
Order [[Temel]] to read from Inquisitor Stelia's sinstone, then kill her.
* [[Inquisitor Stelia]] slain {{co|64.4|52.6|Revendreth}}

==Description==
Since the dawn of [[Revendreth]], Temel has been charged with proclaiming the sins of [[soul]]s for all to hear.

Every soul here, including [[venthyr]], has been forced to endure his wrathful pronouncements on at least one occasion.

He will know how to wield Inquisitor Stelia's sinstone to break through her defenses.

Simply command him to do so after you locate the inquisitor, and eliminate her.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Leggings of Pained Absolution
|Nightcloaked Breeches
|Soul Hunter's Leggings
|Stoneforged Legguards
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The ward on the Accuser's sinstone is weakened by the inquisitor's death.

But we must kill both inquisitors before the ward will fully fall, and we can access the Accuser's sinstone.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Echelon|I will locate the second inquisitor's sinstone. Meet me back here.}}

Head to the west end of the quest area. Stelia is protected by an immunity bubble, Inquisitor's Immunity. Use the bonus ability to pierce it:
:{{abilities|Read Inquisitor Stelia's Sinstone|Order Temel to read out the sins of Inquisitor Stelia, shattering her defenses and fearing lesser venthyr.|cd=30 sec}}
:{{text|say|Temel|I name Inquisitor Stelia her true name... ZILL'KEE THE WORLD REAPER!}}
:{{text|say|Zill'kee the World Reaper|You dare accuse ME?! I have overcome every sin on that stone!}}
:{{text|say|Temel|Who treated others as expendable.}}
:{{text|say|Temel|Who understood death, but did not appreciate it.}}

Defeat her:
:{{text|say|Zill'kee the World Reaper|Do not... listen to... him...}}
:{{text|yell|Lord Chamberlain|The ward around your sinstone weakens, Accuser...}}
:{{text|yell|Lord Chamberlain|How long, do you think, until my underlings eliminate your second inquisitor?}}

Return to Echelon's previous position and he lands:
:{{text|say|Echelon|I have located the next sinstone. Have you dealt with Inquisitor Stelia?}}
