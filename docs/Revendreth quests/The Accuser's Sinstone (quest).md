==Objectives==
Investigate [[the Accuser]]'s sinstone.
* Investigate [[the Accuser's Sinstone]] {{co|65.0|49.7|Revendreth}}

==Description==
[[Lord Chamberlain]] will cross the bridge when it pleases him.

Before he arrives, you will seize the Accuser's sinstone.

Wise [[venthyr]] like Lord Chamberlain hide their sinstone, so that it can never be used against them.

The Accuser is too proud to hide her sinstone. Instead, she puts it on display for all to see.

Boasting of the many, many sins she's overcome.

Proud. Arrogant. Most importantly, foolish.

Her sinstone lies on the altar before us, seemingly unguarded. Retrieve it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|63|60}}
* 3,900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Is that truly the best you have to offer?

==Notes==
On the altar nearby is [[The Accuser's Sinstone]]. It's obviously a trap, but interact with it anyway:
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Inquisitors, ward my sinstone and fly to safety among our people.}}
:''[[Inquisitor Vilhelm]] and [[Inquisitor Stelia]] cast their magic.''
:{{text|say|The Accuser|I will deal with these intruders personally.}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|So this is Denathrius's unwitting pawn?}}
:''The player is Trapped.''
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Your ignorance is not innocence!}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|I will spare you this one time. Do not return.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|Do try to stay on your feet, Maw Walker.}}
:''The player is stunned by Accuser's Rebuke.''
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|You are embarrassing yourself... and, by proxy, me.}}

==Progression==
{{The Accuser}}
