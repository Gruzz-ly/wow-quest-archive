'''The End of the Beginning''' starts the "The Endless Dark" chapter of the [[Shadowlands campaign]]. To reach this point, players must have completed all four of the level-up campaigns (including the [[Revendreth storyline]]) and have reached level {{level|sl-max}}.

==Objectives==
Speak with the Voice of the [[Arbiter]], [[Tal-Inara]], in [[Oribos]].
* Speak to [[General Draven|Draven]]
* Fly with Draven to the Flightmaster
*Speak with Tal-Inara in Oribos.

==Description==
<[[Prince Renathal|Renathal]] struggles to speak, his wounds evident.>

I knew [[Denathrius]] had hoarded [[anima]], but this... this is beyond imagining.

[[The Jailer]] will surely use this power to shatter his bonds. Should he break free of the [[Maw]], all the [[Shadowlands|realms of Death]] will fall.

We must continue to press the fight against Denathrius. Alas, we cannot hope to succeed alone.
 
Return to Oribos with [[General Draven|Draven]] and speak to the Honored Voice, Tal-Inara. Tell her what you have seen this day and implore her to action.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 970 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We have sensed something horrific has happened. Quickly, tell me everything.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[The Curator (venthyr)|The Curator]]|The Maw grows, surging with this flood of anima. I fear nothing will stop the Jailer from breaking free.}}
:{{text|say|[[The Accuser]]|Denathrius is surely gathering his forces inside Castle Nathria. Unchecked, his loyalists will soon overwhelm us.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|We must rally the Harvesters at Sinfall while this mortal returns to Oribos. They must be told what transpired here.}}
:{{text|say|General Draven|I shall escort the Maw Walker, my prince. Come, <name>.}}

Speak with Draven:
:Ready to return to Oribos?
:{{gossip|I am ready.}}
:{{text|say|General Draven|I can take you to the closest flight master to Oribos. From there you should head to Oribos. We must inform the other Covenants of what happened here.}}
:''Draven drops players off at the [[Pridefall Hamlet]], yards from the flight master [[Courier Gevoraal]] then immediately flies for the gateway.''
: {{text|say|General Draven|Head to Oribos. You need to talk to The Voice of the Arbiter. I shall meet you there.}}
