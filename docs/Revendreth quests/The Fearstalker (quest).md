==Objectives==
Speak to [[the Accuser]] to trigger the trap. Then, kill [[the Fearstalker]] and collect the Medallion of Dread.
* Trap triggered
* [[Medallion of Dread]]
*Meet the Accuser outside Dredhollow.

==Description==
The trap has been set and the Fearstalker has walked right in.

Just as I expected, her pride has blinded her to the obvious. Have that vial I gave you earlier ready. It may prove useful in the fight ahead.

When you are ready, we can spring the trap.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Shoes of Pained Absolution
|Nightcloaked Shoes
|Soul Hunter's Boots
|Stoneforged Sabatons
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|51|1|20}}
* 9,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Fearstalker must be defeated.

==Completion==
This medallion will serve us well. But we lack our leader to don it.

We must seek out more allies.

==Notes==
Speak with the Accuser:
:Are you ready?
:{{gossip|I am ready.}}
:''The Fearstalker and her forces set off the anima traps as they begin their assault. This lures the devourers to the town, eliminating her forces. A large [[Worldeater Colossus]] attacks the Fearstalker. In the aftermath of this battle, she is weakened.''

On the other side of the cutscene, the Fearstalker has been reduced to 50% health.
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|Such an elaborate plan to defeat me -- and yet I stand. Let us finish this}}

Players have a bonus ability:
:{{Abilities|Condensed Anima Vial|Throw the vial on the Fearstalker. Dousing her anima and interrupting any spells.|range=30|cd=10 sec|id=327955|icon=ability_rogue_crimsonvial|notes=Instant}}

Aggro her:
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|We will snuff out this resistance. In the Master's name!}}

Occasionally, the Fearstalker will channel Drain Colossus on the dead [[Worldeater Colossus]]:
:{{text|say|The Accuser|She is trying to siphon the anima! Use the vial, <name>!}}

Use the bonus ability to stun her and have some Lured Mites stack the Leeched debuff on her for a few seconds.

Kill her:
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|The hunter becomes... the hunted.}}
:{{text|say|General Draven|A decisive victory. We will meet you outside Dredhollow, <name>.}}

This completes the "The Rebellion" chapter of the [[Revendreth storyline]] and "The Penitent Hunt" chapter of [[The Master of Revendreth]]. The campaign continues with [[Where is Prince Renathal?]].

==Progression==
{{The Penitent Hunt}}
