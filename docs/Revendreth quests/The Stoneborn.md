==Objectives==
Collect the Anima Cage and then awaken 6 Stoneborn Guardians.
* [[Anima Cage]] collected
* [[Stoneborn Guardian]]s awoken (6)
*Speak with [[Mistress Mihaela]] in [[Darkhaven]].

==Description==
The [[Stone Legion]] is not even here yet? This is an outrage.

If we do not do something quick the rebels will overrun this filthy hamlet.

Here, take the [[anima]] and go activate a few of the [[stoneborn]] along the periphery of Darkhaven. Take whatever is left over to the Quartermaster and tell her to do her job.

I will try to commune with [[Sire Denathrius|the Master]] and see if he can send reinforcements.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|63|60}}
* 3,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Darkhaven. Such a pitiful hamlet filled with unworthy supplicants.

==Completion==
This is all that remains of our tithe? The Tithelord is not one for excuses. We may need to gather a second tithe quickly or he will condemn us all to the Ember Ward.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|Stoneborn are fanatically loyal defenders typically. The rebels have been swayed by pretty rhetoric and lies.}}

Pick up the [[Anima Cage]] next to the Lord Chamberlain, then interact with six [[Stoneborn Guardian]]s in and around town (check on the [[Repentance Bridge]]!).

Once six have been activated, find [[Mistress Mihaela]] inside the big building. She is... less than pleased:
:Our village is beset by rebels on one side, Sire Denathrius' loyal tyrants on the other side, and an anima drought is ripping our reality apart. 
:And then you walk out of the Maw and in to my hall. Are you here with good tidings or doom?
