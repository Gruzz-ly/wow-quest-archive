;Description
Alright, first things first, since you are looking at a custom job and you will need to see this newen often, you should probably pick a pigment that suits your particular pallette or party.

Take a look at my fellows here, and then let me know which pigment you would like. I have enough of the special muck needed for each this time, but down the road if you feel the need to repigment... <Rendle shudders> ... well, you can get it on your own from one of us near the muck pools.
