==Objectives==
Summon [[Taskmaster Matyas]] back to camp.
* Courier message sent
* Bottle poisoned
*Meet Taskmaster Martyas at Feeders' Thicket.

==Description==
Alright. Everything is prepared. When you are ready, ask [[Courier Araak]] to summon Taskmaster Matyas as though you have just arrived.

I am sure a gift of a favorite drink will tempt him and the poison we've concocted will incapacitate him long enough to take my sinstone from him.

Our plan will work flawlessly!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|18|95|40}}
* 3,900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, the Maw Walker! I have heard so much about you.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Nadjia the Mistblade|I must hide now. Let Araak know when you are ready to send for Matyas. Then mix the poison into the bottle. This can only go well.}}
:''Nadjia runs away.''
:{{Text|say|Courier Araak|Let me know when you're ready, Maw Walker.}}

;Speaking with Courier Araak
:Is it really betrayal if you didn't get to pick your master in the first place?

:{{Gossip|We are ready. Please tell the Taskmaster the Maw Walker is here.}}

:{{Text|say|Courier Araak|You got it. I hope Nadjia is right and this works.}}
:''Araak flies away.''

Click on the [[Witherfall Special Reserve]].

:''Taskmaster uses {{Abilities|Door of Shadows|id=323951|icon=inv_misc_shadowegg}} and appears.''
:{{Text|say|Courier Araak|Maw Walker! Before you stands, er ... floats, Taskmaster Matyas of [[House Briarbane]] as requested.}}
