==Objectives==
Find and slay The Pale Doom within the [[Endmire]].
* [[The Pale Doom]] slain
*Speak with Taskmaster Gavril.
* Suggested players: 3

==Description==
Notice to all:

A lingering menace lurks in the Endmire, dangerously close to [[Darkhaven]]'s border.

If alone in your travels, take care to avoid this monstrosity, lest it make you meet your true death.

Those with a sense of adventure and a well-armed brigade might manage to slay this beast. If so, a reward will await you upon your return.

Sincerely,

[[Taskmaster Gavril]]

You will receive:
*[[Writ of Tithe Exemption]]
* 10,200 [[XP]]
* +300 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
There's no shame in turning down the bounty. Not everyone has what it takes to slay a devourer.

==Completion==
You have done Darkhaven a great service by slaying that beast.

==Patch changes==
