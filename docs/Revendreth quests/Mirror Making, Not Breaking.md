==Objectives==
Defend Laurent and Simone from [[Stone Legion]] attackers.
* Follow Laurent and [[Simone]]
* Speak to [[Laurent]]
*Laurent and Simone defended (0/100%)

==Description==
[[Denathrius]] does not allow mirrors to be erected within the [[Ember Ward|ember ward]]. His stone servants shatter anything that so much as glints.

I need you to remain vigilant as I make this mirror. I have no doubt that the Master's minions will try to stop us.

Are you ready?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Brimming Ember Shard
|Overflowing Ember Mirror
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 9,700 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

You will also learn: [[The Lost of Art of Mirrors]]

==Completion==
Simone is right. We don't have time for idle chatter. Not here, at least.

The mirror we've repaired will take you to safety.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Laurent|Come with me.}}
:''Laurent and Simone run to a mirror.''

;Speaking with Laurent
:The pieces are all here, ready to be assembled. No doubt the [[Stone Legion]] will descend upon us once they become aware of my work.

:Are you prepared to defend me from their attacks?

:{{Gossip|I am ready.}}

The player gets the Suspicious Activity debuff. As Laurent is casting a spell, [[Fiendish Lookout]]s<!-- beta name Fiendish Servant --> and [[Stone Legion Enforcer]]s<!-- not sure what's up with these, they never appeared. Beta name: Stone Legion Destroyer --> attack. Kill them until you fill up the bar.

;Laurent's gossip during casting
:I must focus on building the mirror!

;At 60%
:{{Text|say|Laurent|The pieces are falling into place. I just need a little more time...}}

;Casting complete
:{{Text|say|Laurent|It's done! The mirror is complete!}}
:{{Text|say|Simone|Laurent, we must leave while we can. It is only a matter of time before the Stone Legion descends upon us once again.}}

;On completion
:{{Text|say|Laurent|If you still have business to attend to, I understand. But Simone and I must not squander our chance at escape.}}
:''Simone runs towards the portal to the [[Sanctuary of the Mad]].''
:{{Text|say|Laurent|Until we meet again, <name>.}}
:''Laurent runs into the portal.''

This completes the Mirror Maker of the Master‎ portion of [[Sojourner of Revendreth]].
