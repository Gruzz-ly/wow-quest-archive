==Objectives==
Kill Inquisitor Traian.
* [[Inquisitor Traian]] slain

==Description==
You may have noticed that inquisitors are protected by the [[Lord Chamberlain]]'s [[magic]]. A potent consequence of wielding the Master's medallion.

But now that we have access to Inquisitor Traian's [[sinstone]] from the archives, we have the power needed to break through those defenses.

Locate the inquisitor, and order [[Temel]] to read out from his sinstone. Declaring the true name and sins of the inquisitor will shatter his defenses and make him vulnerable for a short window of time.

Be ready to strike.

==Rewards==
You will learn: Inquisitor Sinstones

You will also receive:
* {{cost|75|81|60}}
* 13,400 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Avowed|The Avowed]]

==Progress==
Truth, wielded properly, is a potent weapon.

==Completion==
Decorous and deserved.

I hope this will be the first of many corrupt inquisitors we fell together.
