==Objectives==
Bring the Bottle of Redelav Wine to [[Ta'xera]] at The [[Night Market]] in [[Revendreth]].
* [[Bottle of Redelav Wine]] (provided)

==Description==
This item will be of great interest to the [[broker]]s.

Per your previous deal with The Night Market, you should bring it to Ta'xera.

You will be fairly compensated.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|75|81|60}}
* 11,650 [[XP]]
* [[Cartel Exchange Vessel]]

==Completion==
How decadent! Redelav wine! 

I'm torn on whether to keep it for my own collection or use this sought after wine for some valuable artifacts elsewhere.

Nevermind, here's your payment.
