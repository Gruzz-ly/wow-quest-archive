==Objectives==
Plant 8 Rigged [[Anima]] Containers.
* [[Rigged Anima Container]]s set (8)
*Speak with the Accuser at the Fearstalker's Manor.

==Description==
Luring [[the Fearstalker]] here will prove pointless unless we can tilt the odds. She will surely show up with a small army.

Plant these anima containers. When the time comes, we will release their contents into the air: dousing her and her forces in a thick layer of anima.

That should get the [[devourer]]s infesting this place to flock to them like moths to a flame.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|50|60}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are the traps set?

==Completion==
The devourers will rip them to shreds.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|General Draven|Your mission is critical. The trap must be set properly if we hope to succeed.}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|We will meet you at the manor in the village rear.}} (the spoken line differs: We will await you at the manor.)

Rigged Anima Container ghost objects are all over Dredhollow.

On completion of all three:
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|I grow tired of this farce. Show yourselves, and I will grant you the mercy of a swift end.}}
:{{text|say|General Draven|The time is upon us. Troops, hold the line.}}

==Progression==
{{The Penitent Hunt}}
