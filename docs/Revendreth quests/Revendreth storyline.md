[[File:VZ-Revendreth.jpg|thumb|Revendreth zone map]]

The '''Revendreth storyline''' is the final of the four level-up storylines in ''[[World of Warcraft: Shadowlands]]''. The [[Winter Queen]] of [[Ardenweald]] realizes that she and the other leaders require significantly more anima to fend off [[The Jailer]], so she sends the adventurer to [[Revendreth]] with a request.

The progression of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[The Master of Revendreth]].
