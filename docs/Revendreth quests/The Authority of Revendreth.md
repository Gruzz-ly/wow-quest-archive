==Notes==
Behind Denathrius, from left to right are:

[[The Tithelord]], with [[Vrejaal]] behind him:
:You stand before the Tithelord, Harvester of Envy, High Servant of the Master, and keeper of the downtrodden. 
:I hear you helped squash some of the rebels that were invading my ward. I will have you know I chose not to intervene as it was more important for those under my dominion to learn to fend for themselves and prove where their loyalties lay.
:We do not need you here. We are fine on our own.

[[The Fearstalker]], accompanied by [[Vanatora]], and [[Varlasen]]:
:Ah, a <race>. And what an interesting... scent... your soul has. Very distinct. 
:I am known as the Fearstalker. Harvester of Dread. In my forest, I am the predator, and the souls my prey. 
:You should come visit sometime. I am sure it would be very enlightening.

[[The Stonewright]], accompanied by [[General Kaal]], [[General Grashaal]], and [[Myskia]]:
:So, you are the one who slew the stoneborn outside of Darkhaven.
:I am sure you did what you thought was right. Most people do. 
:I am known as the Stonewright. By my hammer and chisel were crafted the first stoneborn, and I see each as my child. They are all brothers and sisters in arms, and now they wage war on each other in this short sighted rebellion.
:The Master believes you can bring an end to this conflict. Of that I have no doubt. I only hope it is the right end.

[[The Countess]], with [[Duke Simion]], [[Duchess Lacrima]], [[Duke Kronid]], [[Duchess Catina]], and two [[Redelav Servant]]s:
:So you have been to the Maw? 
:Fascinating. I must have you to one of my parties so you may share your stories of that place. You may have encountered some of my former acquaintances there.
:Oh, I am the Countess, Harvester of Desire. I command the Castle Ward and her many districts. I spare Sire Denathrius of the burden of having to deal with the nobles. 
:Good luck with the Master's tasks. I am hosting a number of wagers amongst the nobles for how long you might last. Try not to die too soon. Your arrival is the most interesting thing to happen since Prince Renathal rebelled.

Return to Denathrius:
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|Step forward, Maw Walker, and I shall bestow upon you a taste of the power that Revendreth can offer.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|Venthyr of Revendreth, attend and learn. This new... arrival... is my guest, and should be accorded all rights and privileges there in.}}

Step in the purple rune on the ground and Denathrius will channel a spell into the adventurer.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|Lord Chamberlain, I hereby charge you with bringing an end to this failed rebellion.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|For this task, I lend you Prince Renathal's medallion... as well as the might of our dear friend, the Maw Walker.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|Bring the Accuser to me and her medallion shall be yours. The Prince's is already promised to another faithful ally.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|Your generosity is as vast as your wisdom, Master. Your will be done!}}
