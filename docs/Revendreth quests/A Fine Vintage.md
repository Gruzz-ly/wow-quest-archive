==Objectives==
Bring [[Nadjia the Mistblade|Nadjia]] a fancy beverage.
*[[Witherfall Special Reserve]]

==Description==
We will need something special to use as the base of our mixture. To get him to drink it down he will have to believe you've brought him a gift.

He fancies himself quite the connoisseur. Some ancient and stuffy vintage will tempt him.

Check the old cellar near the ruins. It once held supplies, perhaps a bottle still lingers in the depths. [[Courier Araak|Araak]] and I will work out the other details.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|37|90|80}}
* 9,700 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Have you found a suitable beverage?

==Completion==
Ah, that's perfect. He will not be able to resist this.

==Notes==
Enter the [[Sneak Hole]] and kill [[Mucksquint]]. He is quite strong so make use of the nearby [[Keg of the Strong Stuff|Kegs of the Strong Stuff]].
