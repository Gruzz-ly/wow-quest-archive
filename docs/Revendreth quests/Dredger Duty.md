==Objectives==
Dredge a [[dredger]] and bring it to the pile of rubble. Wait for it to dig through the pile and collect the [[:Gem of Binding]].
* [[Ripened Dredger|Dredger]] dredged
* Dredger thrown at the rubble pile
* Dredger [[Pile of Rubble (Revendreth)|defended]]
* [[Gem of Binding]]

==Description==
You fixed up the muck pool so we can make some dredgers, but them [[devourer]]s are gonna keep causin' trouble.

We're gonna need a Gem of Binding so we can dredge up a [[biggun]] to protect the pool.

I'll show you how to dredge up some disposable dredgers to work with for now.

Get 'em digging in the rubble to find us a Gem of Binding, and then we'll reshape 'em all into a biggun to kick them devourers outta here!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You got the gem?

==Completion==
Got a bit of devourer gunk on it, but it will have to do.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Rendle|Alright. Dredger is... "fresh" and ready to go.}}
:{{Text|say|Ripened Dredger|Oi! Down here, Maw Walker!}}

Click on the Ripened Dredger.

;After dredging the dredger
:{{Text|say|Ripened Dredger|Work work work... It's all we do. Bah... take me to the problem.}}
:''The Maw Walker is Holding Dredger.''

Go to the Pile of Rubble. The Throw Dredger extra button appears.

:{{Text|say|Ripened Dredger|This pile o' rubble aint too big. Should only take a minute. Looks like we got devourers coming in hot!}}

Two [[Ravaging Devourer]]s appear.

:{{Text|say|Ripened Dredger|Alright then. Looks like my jobs done. Back to the pools for me.}}

Loot the [[Sack of Dredger Supplies]].

==Progression==

==Beta version==

;Description
Now that the pool is stable again, we can make some dredgers.

I can't keep you around forever, so we're gonna need to take care of the [[devourer]] problem here for good.

When combined with a Stone of Binding, dredgers can be re-shaped into [[biggun]]s. They are hulking creatures capable of impressive feats.

Our supplies were scattered in a recent attack, can you dig through the rubble to find a stone?
