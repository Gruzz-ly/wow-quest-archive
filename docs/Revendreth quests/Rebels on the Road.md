==Objectives==
Slay 5 Stoneborn Rebels.
* [[Stoneborn Rebel]] slain (5)

==Description==
This is unacceptable. The [[stoneborn]] rebels have ambushed a convoy intended for the [[Tithelord]]. He is the local Harvester who rules this ward. 

We need to get through this mess. The bridge on the far side of this conflict leads to [[Darkhaven]]. The Master typically keeps some of his own [[Stone Legion]] forces there. 

Carve us a way through, [[Maw Walker]]. Destroy any who would delay us. We must not keep [[Denathrius|Sire Denathrius]] waiting.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Sash of Pained Absolution
|Nightcloaked Belt
|Soul Hunter's Belt
|Stoneforged Girdle
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Where is the Stone Legion when you need them?

==Completion==
Your talents in combat show promise. Perhaps with a few more centuries and a little humility we might make something of you.

==Notes==
On accept of both quests:
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|You, with the ugly face, ride the carriage off in a different direction as a distraction.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|Mortal, we should split up to avoid being an easier target. Try not to die...}}

Just to the north, a poster exhorts all comers to [[Join the Rebellion!]], which starts an optional side quest, [[Words Have Power]]. Pick it up or not, then head north and start killing.

The [[Anima Canister (item)]] is sitting on a platform at the north end of the quest area. Interact with it and [[Jovraal]] swoops down to attack!
