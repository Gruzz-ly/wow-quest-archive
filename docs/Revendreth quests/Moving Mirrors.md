==Objectives==
Redirect the mirror fragments to free Simone.
* [[Simone]] freed

==Description==
What sort of horrific trap is this? The [[Light]] is being reflected directly on her!

Simone's a dear friend of mine! Free her from that thing, please!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|25|90}}
* 3,900 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Completion==
[[Denathrius]] may not have set the mirrors, but it's his fault I am here.

Those that rouse his suspicion are sent here to suffer, even once loyal servants like myself.

==Notes==
Click on the three [[Mirror Trap]]s.
