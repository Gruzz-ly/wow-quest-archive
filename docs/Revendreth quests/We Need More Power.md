==Objectives==
Collect anima from around The [[Shrouded Asylum]].
*[[Anima]] collected (0/100%)

==Description==
[[Laurent]]'s plan is a bit ambitious.

Mirrors are most reliable when used to traverse short distances. Traveling to the sanctuary will require a great deal of power, more than he or I have.

The [[shrouded]] have stores of anima in their compound. With enough of it, the mirror should be stable enough to get us where we need to go.

==Progress==
Long distance travel requires a great deal of power.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|25|90}}
* 13,650 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Completion==
Yes, this will do.

==Notes==
Click on [[Anima Stores]] to fill up the bar.

==Progression==
{{Mirror Maker of the Master}}

==Patch changes==
