==Description==
The [[Lord Chamberlain]]'s [[Inquisitor (occupation)|inquisitors]] still torment the poor [[soul]]s trapped under their care.

You must put a stop to their wicked deeds!

Speak with Archivist Fane, whom you worked with before to defeat an inquisitor, to acquire the sinstone of another inquisitor in the halls.

With their sinstone, you will be able to shatter that inquisitor's defenses and lead the charge to defeat them.

Bring friends, <name>. Many of the inquisitors are far too dangerous to approach alone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Archivist Fane can help you acquire an inquisitor's sinstone.

==Completion==
