==Objectives==
Collect [[Venthyr]] Ritual Robes, Dagger, and Tome.
* [[Venthyr Ritual Robes]]
* [[Venthyr Ritual Dagger]]
* [[Venthyr Ritual Tome]]

==Description==
There are very specific procedures that we must follow to best tend to the [[soul]]s under our care. You and I will follow them exactly.

I can mask your garish appearance, but you must acquire the necessary ritual tools on your own.

Requisition them from the depraved venthyr serving the [[Lord Chamberlain]] nearby.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|50|54|40}}
* 11,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[The Avowed]]

==Progress==
We will do this the proper way.

==Completion==
Good. You are ready for the ritual.
