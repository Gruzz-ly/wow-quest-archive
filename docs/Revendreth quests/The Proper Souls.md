==Objectives==
Subjugate 4 Fugitive Souls and deliver them to [[the Accuser]].
* [[Fugitive Soul]]s subjugated (4)

==Description==
We must save as many [[soul]]s as we can from the fate we have just witnessed.

Search the halls for souls who have escaped the [[Lord Chamberlain]]'s perverse rituals. Subjugate them and bring them to me inside the [[Halls of Atonement]].

Together, we will make certain that each soul is appropriately processed and cared for.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|50|54|40}}
* 11,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[The Avowed]]

==Progress==
If even one soul can be saved, it is worth it.

==Completion==
Every lost soul must be tended to.
