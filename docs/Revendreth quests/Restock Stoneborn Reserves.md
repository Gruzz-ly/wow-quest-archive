==Objectives==
*[[Shaded Stone]] (10)
*[[Infused Ruby]] (20)

== Description ==
I have an urgent matter to discuss.

At the last Ember Court, many of our stoneborn suffered fractures and cracked limbs while defending our guests. We will need to repair them.

Bring me the stone, and I will coordinate the repairs with our dredgers.

After that is resolved, we can discuss security options for future Ember Courts.

==Rewards==
You will learn: Restock Security

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*9,450 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[The Ember Court]]

==Completion==
This should be enough to rebuild the fallen stoneborn.

The full breadth of our Security options are available to us now.

==Notes==
;On completion
:{{text|say|Watchmaster Boromod|I will distribute this among our troops as needed. Let's discuss security options.}}

==Patch changes==
