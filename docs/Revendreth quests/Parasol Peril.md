===Transcript===
At the pickup location, [[dredger]]s with parasols run to the edge of the platform and take off into the air:
*{{text|say|[[Eager Volunteer]]|I'm a regular [[stoneborn]]!}}
*{{text|say|Eager Volunteer|I'm flyin', I'm flyin'!}}
*{{text|say|Eager Volunteer|Weeee!}}
*{{text|say|Eager Volunteer|When dredgers fly! Ahhhhhhhhh!}}

On picking up the parasol:
:{{text|say|Theotar|Feeling brave are we? Well get out there! I'll be watching intently...}}

Halfway to the landing point:
