==Objectives==
Deliver the package to the [[Night Market]].
* [[A Leaking Package]] (provided)

==Description==
A very exact entity wanted this package to reach [[Ta'tru]] at the Night Market. It looks like [[Broker]] script. The package is clearly leaking, and it is marked perishable. Perhaps delivering it quickly would be best.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|50|7|60}}
* 9,700 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Completion==
Ooh, is that my package of flesh-eating ooze?! I hope you did not get any on your hands. Wearing gloves while handling this particular ooze should mean you have only a 25% chance of suffering an adverse effect. The gloves may be burned, but I will leave that to your discretion. I will inform the locals of your assistance in delivery, even if it was delayed.
