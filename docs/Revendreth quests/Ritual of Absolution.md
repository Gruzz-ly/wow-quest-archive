==Objectives==
Help [[the Accuser]] complete the ritual of absolution.
* Start the absolution ritual
* Ritual completed

==Description==
The ritual of absolution is a sacred rite that forces [[soul]]s to discard the burdens of their mortal lives.

The soul must be a willing participant if the ritual's effect will be meaningful and long-lasting. We often spend ages preparing a soul for a single absolution ritual.

The [[Lord Chamberlain]] has neglected his duty. These souls are overdue for absolution, practically bursting with [[anima]].

We will perform the ritual ourselves, and hurry these souls along their journey.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[The Avowed]]

==Progress==
Absolution is where mercy meets justice.

==Completion==
Absolution does not come easy. Nor should it.

==Notes==
