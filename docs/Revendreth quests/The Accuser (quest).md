==Objectives==
Hunt the Accuser.
* [[The Accuser]] hunted {{co|51.6|59.8|Revendreth}}
*The Accuser confronted
* Cast [[Door of Shadows]] to cross the barrier

==Description==
It is time to hunt our final prey, the Accuser.

[[Anima]] drought or not, her sycophantic adherence to sacred "rituals" flies in the face of the Master's will. I can't wait to see the fear in her eyes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|75|30}}
* 3,900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We meet again. Under dire circumstances I fear.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|I can sense the traitor's fear. She is at the Decrepit Depository.}}
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|A devourer may have eaten her by now. What a shame that would be.}}

Head north to the [[Decrepit Depository]]. A dead [[Honored Hopebreaker]] is nailed to the [[Wall of Sin]]. As the player and the Fearstalker approach:
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|Pathetic traitor. You picked a dead end to hide in.}}
:''The Accuser drops a mirror on the Fearstalker.''
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Maw Walker, Denathrius has made you his pawn.}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|She will soon return. We have little time.  Let me show you the truth.}}

Speak with her:
:Let me show you the truth, Maw Walker.
:{{gossip|Show me.}}
:''The Accuser channels '''Wrathful Invocation''' into the player, granting the zone ability: [[Door of Shadows]]''
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Denathrius has blinded you! I will open your eyes.}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Take this power. Consider it a sign of trust.}}

In case you try to run through the Wall of Sin, she says:
:{{Text|say|The Accuser|Open your eyes and use the power, Maw Walker. It is the only way.}}

Use Door of Shadows and aim the ground-targeted AoE reticle through the other side of the Wall of Sin. Should players manage to burn their cooldown, a nearby vase of [[Midnight Rose]]s will reset the cooldown.
