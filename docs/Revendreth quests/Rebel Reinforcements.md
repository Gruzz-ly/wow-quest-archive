==Objectives==
Recruit Watchmaster Boromod and Tactician Sakaa.
* [[Watchmaster Boromod]] recruited {{co|42.5|75.6|Revendreth}}
* [[Tactician Sakaa]] recruited {{co|40.1|73.2|Revendreth}}
*Speak with General Draven at the Fearstalker's Manor.

==Description==
<[[General Draven]] looks around.>

We require additional reinforcements.

I know of two here that are fiercely loyal to the true purpose of [[Revendreth]]. [[The Fearstalker]] left them here to be consumed by the [[anima]] drought due to their allegiance.

They are both fully capable of assisting us in our mission.

Take this anima stake and infuse them. Direct them to me, I will explain the situation.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Hood of Pained Absolution
|Nightcloaked Hood
|Soul Hunter's Helm
|Stoneforged Headgear
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|50|60}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are our allies infused?

==Completion==
Our numbers are bolstered. Our survival chance is only slightly less grim.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|General Draven|Your mission is critical. The trap must be set properly if we hope to succeed.}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|We will meet you at the manor in the village rear.}} (the spoken line differs: We will await you at the manor.)

Enter the crypt and head to the bottom level to find Boromod:
:{{text|say|Watchmaster Boromod|My gratitude is yours. I will seek out General Draven for further orders.}}

Sakaa is at the north end of the quest area, just past [[Hopebreaker Vilstav]]:
:{{text|say|Tactician Sakaa|Ah, Draven recruited a Maw Walker to assist him. With someone like you, his plan might just work.}}

On completion of all three:
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|I grow tired of this farce. Show yourselves, and I will grant you the mercy of a swift end.}}
:{{text|say|General Draven|The time is upon us. Troops, hold the line.}}
