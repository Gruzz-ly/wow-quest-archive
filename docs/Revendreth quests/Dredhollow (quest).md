==Objectives==
Meet [[the Accuser]] at [[Dredhollow]].

==Description==
That was a narrow escape.

But I believe this presents an opportunity to finally turn the tide of this strife and defeat [[the Fearstalker]]. Meet me at Dredhollow: the abandoned hunting lodge of the Fearstalker.  

We must take separate paths. The Fearstalker will soon be after us again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|55|5}}
* 970 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I am glad you made it here alive.

[[General Draven]] has informed me of a plan that might just work.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|The Accuser|I will meet you there, Maw Walker. I must alert our allies to prepare for what is to come.}}

Use [[Door of Shadows]] to get out of the [[Decrepit Depository]], then head southwest through the [[Banewood]] past  [[Waynecrypt Hill]] to reach the [[Dredhollow]]. On the way, the Fearstalker taunts the player:

:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|Run away, helpless mortal. My hopebreakers WILL find you.}}
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|You will find no safety. We will scour the entirety of Revendreth if we have to.}}

At the gate to Dredhollow:
:{{text|say|General Draven|This plan could work, but it does not come without risk.}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Lucky for us, our Maw Walker thrives against the odds --  and they have arrived.}}

On complete, a bonus objective immediately starts: [[Forgotten Village]]. 

==Progression==
{{The Penitent Hunt}}

==Alpha version==
