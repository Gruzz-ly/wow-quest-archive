==Objectives==
Find and slay Duke Anton of [[House Briarbane]].
* [[Duke Anton]] slain

==Description==
Loyal Citizens of [[Revendreth]]:

Duke Anton and his decrepit house are relics of noble [[venthyr]] society.

His attempts to tarnish my name are laughable at best.

It is time someone rid us of Duke Anton's presence for good.

I shall offer double whatever pathetic sum he can muster.

Sincerely,

[[Lord Darion]] of [[House Redelav]]

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Harvesters]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Redelev Purse
}}

==Progress==
It's better if you don't ask questions.

==Completion==
House Redelav sure has deep pockets. But you've earned it, I suppose.

==Notes==
Find Darion in [[Briarbane Stables]].
