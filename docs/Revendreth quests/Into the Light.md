==Objectives==
Take the elevator up to Sinfall and investigate the area.
* Ride the elevator to [[Sinfall]] {{co|30.3|47.3|Revendreth}}
*Find Breakfist in Sinfall.

==Description==
I am afraid that you must endure the next stretch of the stroll without me, <name>.

While my compatriots and I have secured access to the elevator that shall carry us up to Sinfall, we are unable to utilize it.

The Master has redirected a massive beam of [[Light]] directly onto the elevator's landing.

[[Venthyr]] that get close are obliterated.

[[Dredger]]s sent up never return.

We need someone who can walk in the Light to discover what is happening up there.

[[Lost Sybille|Lady Sybille]] will show you the way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|55|5}}
* 970 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Breakfist is badly injured.>

Too many... couldn't make it...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lost Sybille|Landfall, Sinfall.}}
:{{text|say|Lost Sybille|Big schism, big prism!}}

Before taking off, two wanted posters offer optional side quests: [[WANTED: Enforcer Kristof]] and [[WANTED: Summoner Marcelis]].

Follow Sybille to the elevator, then take it upstairs. A prism is aiming a beam of Light at the edge of the landing. Avoid it and locate [[Breakfist]] on the other side.
