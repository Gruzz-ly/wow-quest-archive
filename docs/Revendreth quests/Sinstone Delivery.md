==Objectives==
Fly with Echelon and deliver [[the Accuser's Sinstone]] to [[Lord Chamberlain]].
* Fly with [[Echelon]]
*Meet Lord Chamberlain on the Halls of Atonement balcony.

==Description==
Lord Chamberlain has held off [[the Accuser]] to buy us the time we needed to break the ward on her sinstone.

But, thanks to your delays, our reinforcement of his position is overdue.

I will collect the Accuser's sinstone and carry us to the battle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|6|31|80}}
* 3,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hurry up, Maw Walker.

==Completion==
This is, in fact, one of the larger sinstones I have seen.

This will be easy to exploit.

==Notes==
Hop on Echelon:
