==Objectives==
Escort Theotar to the [[Sanctuary of the Mad]].
* Speak with [[Theotar]]
* Escort Theotar to the sanctuary
*Meet Theotar in Sanctuary of the Mad.

==Description==
I hope I wasn't too unpleasant while under the [[Light]]'s influence. I do try to restrain myself, but the pain it causes is... maddening.

Anyway, that tea picked me right up!

When I last saw [[Prince Renathal]], the Master was dragging him off to that big tower looming over the [[Ember Ward]].

Myself and a few others have been working to gain access to that tower from below, but there are... obstacles.

When you're ready to depart, I will lead you to our headquarters of sorts, the Sanctuary of the Mad.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ash-Scored Girdle

You will also receive:
* {{cost|51|1|20}}
* 11,350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Theotar takes a slow sip from his tea cup.>

What a delightful stroll!

==Notes==
Speak with Theotar again:
:A quiet stroll after tea. Is there anything better?
:{{gossip|I'm ready. Lead me to the sanctuary.}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|It is a beautiful day for a stroll.}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|Will you be joining us, Lady Sybille?}}
:{{text|say|Lost Sybille|Shrouded turn when ruins burn. He will learn.}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|Delightful! Let's take the scenic route.}}

Theotar has the Gubbins and Tubbins buff, and the player has the Theotar's Entourage buff. Scripted spawns happen along the escort. When the player enters combat:
:{{text|say|Theotar|No one talks about how rude the Light is... It is very rude!}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|Those shrouded ruffians are quite the bother!}}

Should Theotar get too far away from the player:
:{{text|say|Theotar|Tubbins, some tea while we wait.}}

More events, fighting [[Shrouded Marauder]]s, and events along the way:
:{{text|say|Theotar|Ah, there you are, [[Blisterback]]!}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|Such a good pup. Let me patch you up real quick.}}
:{{text|emote|Blisterback growls in acknowledgement of its master.}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|There lies the ruffians' lair, up on the hill. The Shrouded Asylum.}}
:{{text|say|Lost Sybille|Lost shards and lazy guards in our backyards...}}
:{{text|emote|Lost Sybille cackles mischievously.}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|It seems they have sent another emissary to welcome us, as is their custom.}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|We needn't dawdle. Some of my favorite strolls have been sprints.}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|No one talks about how rude the Light is... It is very rude!}}
:{{text|say|[[Marquis Shattereye]]|You should have stayed in your fancy little tea parlor, Theotar!}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|It IS quite fancy isn't it? Yes, thank you for noticing, marquis...}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|A little more shade, Gubbins.}}
:{{text|say|Marquis Shattereye|None of us will escape... the Ember Ward...}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|And a good day to you as well, marquis. We must be off!}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|This has been quite the scintillating stroll!}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|The sanctuary is close ahead. Allow me to do the talking.}}
:{{text|say|Lost Sybille|Empty hull is never full, always dull.}}
:{{text|say|Mad Ward|Son. Sin. Sun.}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|Ah, yes. My mistake. Please allow Lady Sybille to do the talking.}}
:{{text|say|Lost Sybille|One. Kin. Won.}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|Fun... twin... uh...}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|We are all with her, thank you.}}
:{{text|say|Vulca|Charred shards! It's good to see you, Sybille.}}
:{{Text|say|Theotar|Oh, I love happy reunions! Let's all drink some tea!}}
