==Objectives==
Clear the bridge for [[Lord Chamberlain]].
*Clear [[Penance Bridge]] (0/100%)

==Description==
You heard [[Denathrius|Sire Denathrius]]. Today, I ascend to the [[Court of Harvesters]].

You are fortunate to have the honor of witnessing my rise to power.

The traitors have barricaded the bridge ahead. Clear a path for me, so that I might cross it undisturbed.

Nothing can stand against me now that I have a Harvester's medallion.

But I will not waste my power on this rabble.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[The Chamberlain's Tarnished Signet]]
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Clear the way for Lord Chamberlain!

==Completion==
<Echelon grunts.> You're late.

==Notes==

:{{text|yell|The Accuser|We reject your decree, your false claim to this seat, and the corrupt Master!}}
:{{text|yell|Lord Chamberlain|In your defiance, you reveal the vast pride within you, Accuser.}}
:{{text|yell|Lord Chamberlain|You are unworthy of your title, your privilege, and your power!}}
