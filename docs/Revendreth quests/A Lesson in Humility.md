==Objectives==
Witness the Accuser's judgment.
* Speak with [[Denathrius|the Master]]
* [[The Accuser]]'s judgment witnessed

==Description==
Thank you for your service in deposing the Accuser and elevating [[Lord Chamberlain]] in her place.

The Accuser's unprompted betrayal has rendered her both undeserving and unfit to serve on the [[Court of Harvesters]].

Now, please, observe what happens to traitors in [[Revendreth]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Mantle of Pained Absolution
|Nightcloaked Spaulders
|Soul Hunter's Monnion
|Stoneforged Spaulders
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|12|63|60}}
* 3,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Please observe silently, Maw Walker.

==Completion==
I am nothing if not merciful and understanding.

The Accuser will be given every opportunity to repent her errors and learn from them.

==Notes==
Speak with Denathrius again:
:I find no solace in the punishment of these traitors.
:But, as a servant of Revendreth, I do what I must to preserve peace here.
:In time, I hope they will see the error of their ways.
:{{gossip|I will witness the Accuser's judgment.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|Accuser, I gave you a simple task. Instead, you chose rebellion.}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|You ordered me to defile the ancient rituals that define who we are. I will not do that, even for you.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|A poor decision. You are hereby accused of defying the will of Revendreth.}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|I accuse YOU, Denathrius, of failing in your charge. YOU are the one who defies the will of Revendreth.}}
:{{text|yell|Sire Denathrius|Defy Revendreth? I AM Revendreth!}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|Perhaps a few centuries burning in the Ember Ward will remind you of who rules this place.}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Even your punishments reveal your complacency. Very well. Hide me with your other failures.}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|You were once the lord of dread. Now? Now your teeth have lost their terror.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|Have they now? We shall see. Fearstalker! Prepare your hunters.}}

This concludes the "The Accuser" chapter of the [[Revendreth storyline]]. The campaign continues with [[The Grove of Terror]].
