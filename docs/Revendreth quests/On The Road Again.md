* Ride the [[Darkhaven Carriage]]

==Description==
Right lads! All aboard!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|6|31|80}}
* 3,900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We are not getting the carriage through that.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Nadjia the Mistblade|We must part ways for now, as I have some vengeance to dispense. I do hope our paths cross again. Try not to die.}}

Hop in the carriage again:
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|Be on your guard. Draven and his lackeys may still be lurking nearby.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|Draven is one of the few remaining leaders of a failed rebellion.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|There are those disloyal venthyr and stoneborn who believe the Master is responsible for the anima drought. Such [[Heretic|heresy]].}}

At the [[Decimated Crossroad]], the Lord Chamberlain calls a stop:
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|Come, let us proceed on foot. I do not fancy being flung off a cliff again.}}

At the Crossroad, Rendle offers an optional side quest starting with [[Not My Job]].
