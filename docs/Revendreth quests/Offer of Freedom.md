==Objectives==
Weaken [[House Briarbane|Briarbane]] [[venthyr]] and then offer them a sinstone.
* Compelled venthyr freed (3)
*Meet up with Nadjia at Witherfall Ruins.
* [[Sinstone Fragment]] (provided)

==Description==
Just as I was, some of the Briarbane venthyr you encounter will have been compelled to serve [[Taskmaster Matyas|Matyas]]. They likely will not want to fight you but will have no choice. Once they are injured they may be willing to pause to see if one of the sinstones you recovered earlier is theirs.

Free those you can. The use of a sinstone to compel others isn't fair.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Briarbane Signet
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|37|90|80}}
* 13,400 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Have you released the compelled venthyr?

==Completion==
You've made some friends today.

==Notes==
;On accept of both
:{{Text|say|Nadjia the Mistblade|At least some of Matyas's followers are forced to serve him, as I was. Free them if you can.}}

As you fight against [[Briarbane Footman|Briarbane Footmen]], [[Briarbane Arbalest]]s, and [[Briarbane Cavalier]]s, use the item when they are below 40%.

;Item used and accepted on Briarbane Footmen, Arbalests or Cavaliers
*{{Text|say|This changes everything. You are a marvel.}}
*{{Text|say|I am free, finally. You have my thanks.}}
*{{Text|say|How did you get my sinstone? Oh, thank you!}}
*{{Text|say|I have no desire to fight you and now I cannot be compelled.}}
*{{Text|say|Bless your name.}}

;Item used and refused
*{{Text|say|I have no interest in someone else's sinstone. Die!}}
*{{Text|say|Sadly, that isn't mine so I must fight on.}}
*{{Text|say|How insulting. Matyas is a friend. He doesn't compel me.}}
*{{Text|say|I am loyal to House Briarbane!}}
*{{Text|say|Not mine. Die!}}

Nearing the [[Vine Ladder]]
:{{Text|say|Nadjia the Mistblade|Up here, Maw Walker. I have found Matyas in the upper area of the tower. Join me when you are ready.}}
