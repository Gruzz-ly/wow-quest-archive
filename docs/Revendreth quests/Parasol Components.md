==Objectives==
Return the components to [[Sanctuary of the Mad]].
* [[Bundle of Smuggled Parasol Components]] (provided)

==Description==
Sheets of fine cloth, wooden parasol ribs, wooden dowels and metal braces, everything you would need to put together new parasols. These are worth a lot of gold in the [[Ember Ward]]. [[Mats]] would certainly reward you handsomely if you brought him this cache.

* 9,700 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Harvesters]]
* 35x [[Infused Ruby]]

==Completion==
Oh, wow, this is a real find you have. Here, a heap of Infused Rubies for the bundle, the best you will see here in the ward. And if you see one of my goods you might like, let me know.
