==Objectives==
Speak with [[Cryptkeeper Kassir]].

==Description==
You or I could wield these [[sinstone]]s directly, but I much prefer to use [[stone fiend]]s for such tasks.

Exceptional results, no personal risk.

Unfortunately, my stone fiend did not return from its last errand.

Speak with Cryptkeeper Kassir in the archives above. He is loyal to [[the Accuser]] and will loan us his stone fiend.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|52|70}}
* 1,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Cryptkeeper Kassir grins.>

So you finally listened to the Accuser, eh?

Better late than never.
