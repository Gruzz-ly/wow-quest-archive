==Objectives==
Kill 6 Dredbats in the [[Grove of Terror]].
* [[Dredbat]]s slain (6)

==Description==
The Grove of Terror's dredbats have become aggressive due to the lack of anima caused by the drought.

This is a formal request to cull their numbers. We must re-establish dominance over our creations.

;Description
Look around, Maw Walker. The dredbats have practically taken over these grounds.

Their lack of [[anima]] has driven them to attacking anyone and anything -- making our work here quite difficult to carry out.

Go and re-establish our dominance over them.
