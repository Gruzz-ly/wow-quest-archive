==Objectives==
Speak to the Fearstalker in [[Wanecrypt Hill]] and participate in the [[Penitent Hunt]].
* Speak to [[the Fearstalker]]
* [[Crimelord Tiana]] hunted {{co|50.4|61.4|Revendreth}}
* [[Yoshai the Merciless]] hunted {{co|44.5|70.4|Revendreth}}
* [[Houndmaster Loksey]] hunted {{co|46.8|65.1|Revendreth}}

==Description==
You will descend upon these poor souls. Remember, you are helping them and [[Revendreth]] through the terror you bring. When a [[soul]] is filled with fear, their resistances to our methods falter.

[[Denathrius|The Master]] has requested that you hunt [[the Accuser]] yourself. But we must prey upon some of the others first.

I will be able to guide you through your first hunt.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Gargon Eye Ring]]
* {{cost|25|50|60}}
* 9,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The souls must be hunted.

==Completion==
Well done. The fear we struck allowed us to extract ample anima for Revendreth.

Onto our final target.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|Hopebreakers, you may begin.}}

Speak with the Fearstalker again:
:The hunt calls, <name>.
:{{gossip|Let's begin.}}

Before leaving, [[Huntmaster Constantin]] offers an optional side quest: [[Hunting Trophies]].

Look around for the named hunt targets while killing the rest of the wildlife. You get the Hopebreaker buff.

Yoshai is caught in a [[Hopebreaker Trap]] surrounded by [[Rotting Deathwalker]]s:
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|Their broken hope leads the way.}}
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|Look, <name>. Paralyze a soul with fear, and their anima flows freely.}}
:{{text|say|Yoshai the Merciless|I feel...  sorrow. I must repent.}}

Loksey is being tormented by a devourer, [[Truulax]]:
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|Manifestations of their remaining hope. We are close.}}
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|Even the houndmaster cannot resist when succumbed by fear. Off to Lady Darkvein with him.}}
:{{text|say|Houndmaster Loksey|I thought I was brave. Maybe I was wrong.}}

Tiana is trapped in a web cast by an [[Engorged Fearspinner]]:
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|I can sense our prey's overwhelming fear.}}
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|Fear has left you defenseless to the process. To the Halls of Atonement with you.}}
:{{text|say|Crimelord Tiana|Yes. Please no more!}}

The three souls are snatched by a [[Fate Usher]].
