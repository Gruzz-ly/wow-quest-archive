==Objectives==
Enter the [[Maw]] to find [[Prince Renathal]].
* Containers of Dark Will opened (4)
* Jump into the Maw

==Description==
You! They say you are a [[Maw Walker]]. Well, time to put that to the test.

My master, Prince Renathal, was the one who started the rebellion. He knew [[Denathrius]] was working towards something truly nefarious, and attempted to stop him.

The rebellion failed, and Renathal was flung into the Maw.

I propose you and I venture into the Maw. There is an old device here that only you will be able to use. Together, we can recover my Prince. You need him, if you are to have any hope of success.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|75|30}}
* 970 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Your fighting style lacks... finesse.

==Completion==
So this is the Maw. I can feel it leeching my essence. Be on your guard.

==Notes==
In the area are four [[Container of Dark Will|Containers of Dark Will]]. Interact with them, then jump off the platform. The player and the animated weapon land overlooking [[Gorgoa: River of Souls]].

==Progression==
