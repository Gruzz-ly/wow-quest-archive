==Objectives==
Kill Marquis Pummeler.
* [[Marquis Pummeler]] slain {{co|33.8|61.3|Revendreth}}
*Speak with Theotar in the Desiccation.

==Description==
You simply won't believe what happened to me!

I was out for my daily stroll when Marquis Pummeler and his band of ruffians assailed me!

Amongst the many unfortunate and ungentlemanly behaviors they displayed was destroying my parasol.

A tragedy of the highest order!

Without it, I'm afraid I'm left quite vulnerable to the oppressive [[Light]] that curses this land.

The Marquis controls a coveted shaded hideout nearby. Will you avenge my parasol and teach this ruffian some manners?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Tubbins Teapot Fire Mitts
|Sure-Grip Parasol Gloves
|Ghoul-Tooth Resistant Grips
|Gubbins Polished Gauntlets
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|50|60}}
* 9,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Marquis and his ruffians must be taught some manners!

==Completion==
<Exposure to the Light is clearly causing Theotar to lose control of himself.>

Justice... for parasols... everywhere...

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Theotar|Allow me to apologize in advance for what I will become out there.}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|The Light is... unforgiving to my kind.}}

Theotar will follow the player around and has a bar showing his Willpower. "Venthyr suffer immensely in the Light. They will slowly lose control of themselves." He also has the Shrouded In Darkness buff and Vulnerable to the Light debuff. Try to spend as little time in the Light as possible, though it does not matter. Should players manage to finish all three quests with some willpower left in Theotar's bar, it will instantly drain.

Find Marquis Pummeler at the [[Desiccation]] inside a building:
:{{text|say|Marquis Pummeler|Into the Light with you, weakling!}}
:{{text|say|Marquis Pummeler|At least I die... in darkness...}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|That shall teach you some manners, ruffian!}}

;Exiting cover:
*{{text|say|Theotar|Ungh! Oppressive, unbearable Light!}}

;Entering cover:
*{{text|say|Theotar|Hello darkness, my old friend.}}
*{{text|say|Theotar|Ah, a moment's relief... Thank you.}}
*{{Text|say|Theotar|Hidden... darkness... safe...}}

;50%:
:{{text|yell|Theotar|Make it stop! Everything burns... everything...}}
;25%:
:{{text|yell|Theotar|Curse the Light!}}
;0%:
:{{text|yell|Theotar|Nothing matters... only pain... eternal pain...}}
:{{text|yell|Theotar|RAAAAAGH!}}

Keep an eye out for [[Sabina]] who starts a side questline.
