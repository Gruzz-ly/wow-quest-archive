==Objectives==
Find and slay Enforcer Kristof.
* [[Enforcer Kristof]] slain {{co|22.9|55.7|Revendreth}}
*Speak to Dispatcher Raluca.

==Description==
WARNING!

[[Shrouded]] patrols have increased throughout the [[Ember Ward]]. By order of Enforcer Kristof, all who are found near the asylum will be forced to endure the [[Light]].

Use extreme caution when venturing beyond our sanctuary. Even the shadows are not safe so long as Kristof remains in power.

A reward awaits whoever is able to rid the ward of this tyrant.

- [[Dispatcher Raluca]]

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Jeweled Hand Fan]]
* 11,850 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Take care. Kristof is a dangerous foe.

==Completion==
No tears will be shed over the loss of such a miscreant. Coin is not abundant in this ward, but take this, the owner is long gone and it will fetch a fair price.

==Progression==
{{The Mad Duke}}
