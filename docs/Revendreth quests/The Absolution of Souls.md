==Objectives==
Meet [[the Accuser]] at [[Absolution Crypt]].

==Description==
Do you not yet understand the purpose of [[Revendreth]], [[Maw Walker]]?

The [[soul]]s under our care teeter on the brink of permanent damnation. Even with perfect attention and careful processing, not every soul can escape the Maw and be elevated to a higher destiny.

That is true under the best of circumstances.

Currently, due to your installation of the Chamberlain at the [[Halls of Atonement]], we're instead witnessing the worst of circumstances.

We must return to the Halls of Atonement and enforce order.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|52|70}}
* 970 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is worse than I feared.
