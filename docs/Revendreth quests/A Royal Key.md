==Objectives==
Recover [[Prince Renathal|Renathal's]] Cage Key.
* [[Renathal's Cage Key]] {{co|28.5|21.2|Maw}}

==Description==
I am not about to question whatever twist of fate led you to me. Your timing could not be better.

This cage was custom built to contain me. There is one key, and of course it is on the armor of [[Ghelak the Incinerator|that large brute]] over there.

Vanquish him and take the key. Be swift, [[the Jailer]]'s eyes are always on this area.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|1|20}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There was an age when I knew how to pick a lock even this elaborate. Sadly that was so long ago I seem to have fallen out of practice.

==Completion==
Well, you are quite resourceful. Give me twenty five of your kind and some proper gear and we could defeat the Master.

==Notes==
Head west across the [[Planes of Torment]] to find [[Ghelak the Incinerator]].

==Progression==
{{Prince Renathal}}
