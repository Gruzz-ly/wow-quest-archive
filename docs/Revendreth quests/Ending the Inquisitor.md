{{questportrait|Inquisitor Vilhelm.jpg|Inquisitor Vilhelm|Powerful venthyr protecting the Accuser's sinstone.}}
==Objectives==
Order [[Temel]] to read from Inquisitor Vilhelm's sinstone, then kill him.
* [[Inquisitor Vilhelm]] slain {{co|67.3|43.5|Revendreth}}
*Return to Echelon in the Halls of Atonement courtyard.

==Description==
Inquisitor Vilhelm hides smugly in the back of the courtyard, flanked by several [[gargon]]s and loyal [[venthyr]].

We must kill him to break the ward on [[the Accuser]]'s sinstone, so that [[Lord Chamberlain]] can use it in his battle.

Temel will once again help you penetrate the inquisitor's defenses. Do not tarry.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Wraps of Pained Absolution
|Nightcloaked Bindings
|Soul Hunter's Bracers
|Stoneforged Vambraces
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 9,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Once the inquisitor is dead, the warding spell will be broken.

==Completion==
Lord Chamberlain confirmed the kill. We should hurry.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Echelon|I will reassemble the sinstone for you, Temel.}}
:{{text|say|Temel|So I can betray my friend with it... Gee, thanks.}}

Same as on the other kill quest, players have a bonus ability again:
:{{abilities|Read Inquisitor Vilhelm's Sinstone|Order Temel to read out the sins of Inquisitor Vilhelm, shattering his defenses and fearing lesser venthyr.|range=25|cd=30 sec}}

Head north. This time, [[Inquisitor Vilhelm]] is guarded by two [[Soul Monitor]]s. Note the [[Overflowing Chalice]]s behind him...

Use the ability:
:{{text|say|Temel|I name Inquisitor Vilhelm his true name... MOONGO THE SUN KING!}}
:{{text|say|Moongo the Sun King|Wielding sinstones is a dirty trick, mortal.}}
:{{text|say|Temel|Who ascended to great power and used it only for himself.}}
:{{text|say|Temel|Who was unsatisfied with the divine gifts granted to him, and stole more.}}
:{{text|say|Temel|Whose good deeds were motivated by insecurity and jealousy.}}

Defeat him:
:{{text|say|Moongo the Sun King|Heed... the Accuser.}}
:{{text|yell|Lord Chamberlain|Ha! The wards protecting your sinstone have crumbled, Accuser!}}
:{{text|yell|Lord Chamberlain|Echelon! Retrieve it for me immediately!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Echelon|Begone, Temel.}}
:{{text|say|Temel|With pleasure, 'master.'}}
