'''Overdue Purging''' is a potential [[Venthyr Covenant]]-daily quest accessible once [[Sinfall]]'s [[Anima Conductor]] with Tier 2 is channeled into [[Pridefall Hamlet]].

==Objectives==
Destroy 30 Manifestations in [[Revendreth]].
* [[Manifestation]]s destroyed (30)

==Description==
There are many duties of a [[stoneborn]] that have been forsaken by the plans of [[Denathrius]].

One such duty is the elimination of manifestations. The process [[venthyr]] use to extract [[anima]] from [[soul]]s is not clean, and often leads to unresolved issues made manifest.

These entities are dangerous if left unchecked, and increase in number thanks to your revivication of anima to these droughted lands.

While you patrol Revendreth, destroy any manifestations you encounter and I shall provide you recompense.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2x [[Grateful Offering]]
*3 - 5x Anima item (35)

{{Stub-section|Appears there are more.}}
{{itembox|You will also receive one from:|Sincollector's Vestment
|Sincollector's Sandals
|Soulstalker Breeches
|Mail Courier's Greaves
|Soulstalker Helm
|Stone-Etched Shawl
|Leafed Banewood Band
}}

==Progress==
In Revendreth, a soul's burdens are made manifest. It makes it easier to impale such burdens with a spear.

==Completion==
Your efforts are much appreciated.

When this conflict is over, the [[Stone Legion]] should once again return to its noble purpose of protecting Revendreth, instead of satisfying the dark whims of [[Denathrius]] and his allies.
