==Objectives==
Poison the Taskmaster to get [[Nadjia the Mistblade|Nadjia]]'s sinstone.
* [[Taskmaster Matyas|Matyas]] poisoned
* [[Nadjia's Sinstone|Nadjia's sinstone acquired]]
*Speak with Nadjia.

==Description==
A [[mortal]] in [[Revendreth]]. It's rumored that you can traverse the [[Maw]]? Astonishing. I have so many questions.

But, I must restrain my curiosity. I have a ... shall we say ... proposition for you that I feel would be advantageous for us both. If it is true that you are able to freely travel these lands then you have access to certain information I cannot reach.

You see how you could be useful to me? Come, let us discuss the matter further.
