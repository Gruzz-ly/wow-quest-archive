==Objectives==
Prepare Houndmaster Loksey for the [[Penitent Hunt]] in the [[Grove of Terror]].
* [[Houndmaster Loksey]] bound {{co|49.4|75.8|Revendreth}}
* Speak to Sinreader Nicola {{co|50.2|75.2|Revendreth}}
* Houndmaster Loksey demoralized by the [[gargon]]s
*Bring Houndmaster Loksey to Flockmaster Sergio in the Grove of Terror.
*[[Hopebreaker Soul Chains]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Sire Denathrius]] has requested I help you prepare for the hunt. Every [[hunter]] must help prepare a soul here in the Grove of Terror.

I have a stubborn soul here who's been quite uncooperative, Houndmaster Loksey. His time has come to be hunted.

<[[The Fearstalker]] hands you a set of Hopebreaker Soul Chains.>

Demoralize him. We can't let him leave here with any hope. The hunt is meant to break the souls so they become less... resistant to the processes of [[Revendreth]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|75|30}}
* 3,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The soul must be prepared.

==Completion==
This soul is nearly ready. 

We have an opportunity to finish preparing this one and take care of a problem in the process.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|Use these chains to control the stubborn soul. A soul bound in irons is at your will.}}

Walk down to the marked crypt on the map:
:{{text|say|Soulkeeper Nokturne|I will open the crypt. Remember, this is what's best for them.}}
:{{text|say|Houndmaster Loksey|What now? More tedium to waste my time?}}

Nearby is a poster offering [[Beast Control]].

Interact with Loksey:
:{{text|say|Sinreader Nicola|Bring the stubborn one to me, Maw Walker.}}
:{{text|say|Houndmaster Loksey|You think you can scare me? I braved endless legions! This will be child's play.}}

Loksey is Bound by Iron. Head across the way to the north to [[Sinreader Nicola]]:
:Let me see the soul you have brought before me.
:{{gossip|Read this soul their sins.}}
:{{text|say|Sinreader Nicola|Your sins are many. But none quite as cruel as siccing your beasts on innocents.}}
:{{text|say|Sinreader Nicola|He will witness the horrors he instilled in life. To the gargons.}}

As you have the Reluctant Soul debuff, run between the [[Soulstalker Alpha]] gargons:
:{{text|bossemote|He is resisting your every move. Stay closely in front of him to pull him through the gauntlet.}}
:{{text|say|Houndmaster Loksey|These beasts don't scare me.}}
:{{text|say|Houndmaster Loksey|Those got kind of close... Enough of this, now!}}
:{{text|say|Houndmaster Loksey|Ah! Are you trying to get me devoured?!}}
:{{text|say|Houndmaster Loksey|No! I won't go any further. This is too much!}}
:{{text|yell|Flockmaster Sergio|Bring that one here, mortal! I have plans for him...}}

;When idle or moving away
*{{text|say|Houndmaster Loksey|Fine! I'll just stay right here for an eternity.
*{{text|say|Houndmaster Loksey|Get back here! I'm in no rush to complete this torment.
*{{text|say|Houndmaster Loksey|I'm not moving unless you make me!

Keep running:
:{{text|say|Houndmaster Loksey|Agh! Okay, okay. I'm coming.}}
:{{text|say|Flockmaster Sergio|This one is almost ready for the hunt.}}
