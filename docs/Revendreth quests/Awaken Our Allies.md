'''Awaken Our Allies''' is a potential [[Venthyr Covenant]]-only daily quest. It is available by channeling [[Sinfall]]'s [[Anima Conductor]] with Tier 2 into [[Pridefall Hamlet]].

==Objectives==
Awaken 15 Allied [[Stoneborn]].
* [[Stoneborn Ally|Stoneborn Allies]] awakened (15)
* [[Anima Cage]] (provided)

==Description==
I have need of your services.

I have identified a collection of stoneborn throughout [[Revendreth]] whom may be swayed to our cause, or were already members of our cause before returning to their stone slumber.

You have provided us with the [[anima]] we needed, now it is time to put it to use. Seek out our allies and awaken them. I have fashioned an anima container for easier transport to aid in this endeavor.

We need an army if we are to face an army.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2x [[Grateful Offering]]

And one from:
*3 - 5x Anima item
*{{Cost|281|8}}

==Progress==
How goes the search?

==Completion==
Terrifying, aren't they? Magnificent weapons crafted by the finest arts perfected since the coalescing of the [[Shadowlands]] themselves.

They shall prove invaluable in the times to come.

==Notes==
Upon awakening, [[Stoneborn Ally]] can say one of a few lines,
*{{text|say|Stoneborn Ally|To the skies.}}
*{{text|say|Stoneborn Ally|And so my watch continues}}
*{{text|say|Stoneborn Ally|By your command!}}
*{{text|say|Stoneborn Ally|For the glory of Revendreth.}}
*{{text|say|Stoneborn Ally|I awake!}}

They can be interacted with mounted.

Once the quest is ready to be turned in, the platform where all the anima conductor daily quests are located is filled with [[Stoneborn Ally]] NPCs.
