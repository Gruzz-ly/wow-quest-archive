==Objectives==
Find Cudgelface and the Lord Chamberlain.
* [[Cudgelface]] found {{co|67.4|62.4|Revendreth}}
* [[Lord Chamberlain]] found {{co|66.8|57.8|Revendreth}}

==Description==
Oh this is bad. This is really bad.

Every time one of the lads makes it down here they don't come back. Things that come down here... they sort of stay down here one way or another.

Let's make a deal. You're a [[Maw Walker]]. You go find Cudgelface and the Chamberlain while I get this here [[carriage]] back in service and then we all get out of here before somethin' tries to eat us and THEN go to work on us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Endmire ain't a place to go spendin' time with idle chat.

==Completion==
Ah good. No one got ate.

Carriage is ready to go when you are.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Rendle|You go find the lads and I'll get this [[carriage]] back in ridin' shape. Uh... try not to get ate.}}

Just to the north, [[Nadjia the Mistblade]] calls out:
:{{text|yell|Nadjia the Mistblade|Mortal! Over here!}}

Nadjia begins [[The Greatest Duelist]], a required quest for the campaign.

An optional, but highly encouraged quest, [[The Endmire (quest)]] is started by [[Tessle the Snitch]], just north of Nadjia's position.

A [[Ravenous Mite]] has snagged Cudgelface and is about to fly off with him:
:{{Text|Yell|Cudgelface|Aaaaah! I don't wanna get ate!}}

Attack it to get the mite to drop Cudgelface.

Find the Lord Chamberlain along the north end of the quest area:
:{{Text|Say|Nadjia Mistblade|Lord Chamberlain?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lord Chamberlain|The Mistblade graces us with her presence? And what cage did our Maw Walker let you out of?}}
:{{Text|Say|Nadjia Mistblade|Oh, you know me. A different age, a different cage.}}

Speak with him:
:Ugh. Now you get to see the true cost of the [[anima]] drought. It is wasting this place away, consuming it, allowing these infesting creatures to pass in to our lands.
:I do hope you are as talented a warrior as your fame proclaimed.
:{{Gossip|Come with me.}}

After piquing Nadjia's interest, return to Rendle, who has righted the carriage and hitched the horses.
