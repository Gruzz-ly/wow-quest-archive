'''Snacks for Stonehead''' is an optional quest in [[Revendreth]] that causes [[Stonehead]] to stop throwing the player into the [[Ember Ward]]. It is required for Stonehead to attend the [[Ember Court]].

Collect a sampling of snacks from across the [[Ember Ward]] for [[Stonehead]].
* [[Gooey Bug Bites]] (50)
* [[Ash Crisps]] (20)
* [[Mirror Candy]] (6)
* [[A Light Snack]]

==Description==
<Stonehead has amassed a wide variety of half-eaten oddities.

He'd certainly appreciate you bringing some new, creative snacks for him to try.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Best Bud With Benefits]]
*{{Abilities|Stonehead's Best Bud Benefits|Stonehead will let you freely pass through the Ember Ward gate.|id=320577|icon=achievement_halloween_smiley_01}}
*{{cost|77|22}}
* 12,250 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Tummy rumbly...

==Completion==
<Stonehead's eyes light up when he sees the massive pile of semi-edible delicacies you brought him.>

You best bud! Best bud free to go wherever <he/she> want! 

==Notes==
To reach the [[Chewed Light Shard]] and accept this quest, pick up one of the nearby [[Hollow Rock]]s and use it to sneak up to the Light Shard. As you near Stonehead:
:{{text|say|Stonehead|Rocks be busy today!}}

Most enemies in the Ember Ward are an objective here. Get killing, including:
*[[Ravenous Swarm]]s for their [[Gooey Bug Bites]]
*[[Ash Crawler]]s in [[Cinderwall]] for their [[Ash Crisps]]
*[[Shrouded Marauder]]s, [[Shrouded Shardsetter|Shardsetters]], and [[Shrouded Arcanist|Arcanists]] in the [[Shrouded Asylum]] for their [[Mirror Candy]]

Additionally, look for a Remnant of Light crystal in the [[Desiccation]] for [[A Light Snack]].

Return to Stonehead on foot, not in disguise. Stonehead will pick you up and hold you, allowing you to speak to him:
:What you doin' here, bad bud?
:{{gossip|Release me immediately.}}
:{{text|say|Stonehead|Fine. Me not lonely.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Stonehead|New snacks! New snacks!}}
:{{text|say|Stonehead|You da best bud of all da buds!}}
:''Stonehead tosses you—more gently than before—and you land on his previous pile of snacks.''

After this quest, Stonehead will allow you to go in and out of the Ember Ward as you please, and he'll greet you when you pass by:
:{{text|say|Stonehead|Hi bye, best bud!}}

He also has new gossip:
:Hi, best bud!
:I find snacks for you next!
