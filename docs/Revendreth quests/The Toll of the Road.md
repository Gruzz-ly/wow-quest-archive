==Objectives==
Return the tolls to [[Darkhaven]].
* [['Misplaced' Anima Tolls]] (provided)

==Description==
This vessel appears to be brimming with [[anima]]. It is certainly tolls collected from denizens traveling by this crossroads. I am sure with all that is going on, [[Mistress Mihaela]] in Darkhaven would appreciate these tolls brought to her to cover the [[Village Ward]]'s obligations.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|50|54|40}}
* 9,700 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What is this? The road tolls! [[Tollkeeper Varaboss|Varaboss]], that conniving fiend, never did master his greed. Your kind prefers this precious metal as recompense I believe.
