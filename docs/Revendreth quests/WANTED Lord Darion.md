==Objectives==
Find and slay Lord Darion of [[House Redelav]].
* [[Lord Darion]] slain

==Description==
To Whom it May Concern:

Lord Darion of House Redelav thinks that he can buy his place in society.

He flaunts his wealth, using it to win favor of other lords and ladies. Is there no price on decency?

This is not the way the noble houses of [[Revendreth]] should conduct themselves.

I implore you to find Lord Darion and help him meet his true death.

The honor of [[House Briarbane]] rests in your capable hands.

Warmest Regards,

[[Duke Anton]] of House Briarbane

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 12,250 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Harvesters]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Sinvyr Statuette

==Progress==
Getting involved in house squabbles is so beneath me.

==Completion==
Hopefully this means House Briarbane will stop their whining.

==Notes==
Enter [[Redelav Hall]], go downstairs, and open a door on the right side to find Darion.
