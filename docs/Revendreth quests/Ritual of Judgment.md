==Objectives==
Participate in the ritual of judgment.
* Join the Ritual of Judgment
* Soul judged

==Description==
After all rituals of absolution are complete, each [[soul]] must face its final judgment in [[Revendreth]].

There are three potential verdicts:<br>
If proven unworthy, it is condemned to the [[Maw]] for eternity.

If fully absolved of its sins, it is either elevated to a [[venthyr]] or returned to the [[Arbiter]] to be assigned its new destination.

Our most sacred ritual, the judgment, determines this fate.

One such ritual is happening now. I will disguise you and we will participate to ensure a just verdict.

==Rewards==
You will learn: Venthyr Rituals (You are now able to participate in venthyr rituals at the Halls of Atonement.)

You will receive:
* {{cost|18|95|40}}
* 6,700 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I sacrificed more than you realize to save this soul.

I would do it again, because it is right. Do you understand yet?
