==Objectives==
Use the mirrors atop [[Sinfall]] to seal the gates of [[Castle Nathria]].
* [[Unaligned Mirror|Mirrors]] aligned (6)

==Description==
<Name>, [[Denathrius|Sire Denathrius]] must be stopped. The [[anima]] he is stealing from the [[Shadowlands]] is weakening the bonds that seal [[the Jailer]] within the [[Maw]]. That must not happen.

Time is short so we must strike quickly. I would like for you to head up to the surface, into that accursed [[Light]], and align as many mirrors as you can find to the focusing mirror atop the portcullis.

We will shine a light on Castle Nathria so bright no [[venthyr]] will wish to step forth from that fortress to challenge us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hopefully you did not get too scorched out there.

==Completion==
That should buy us some time and carve us a bit of a path. Now to take advantage of the situation.

==Notes==
Back up the stairs past [[Theotar]] and through the Blood mirror back to the surface.

Up on the ramparts of Sinfall are six [[Unaligned Mirror]]s. The most efficient path is to go clockwise from the northeast, as there are a few jumps down past the south mirrors:
