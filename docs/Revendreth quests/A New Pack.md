Defeat an Unbidden Worldeater.

==Description==
<The gorger is more than fully grown, rivaling most of the other [[devourer]]s in the area. It clearly wants to stay with you, but it appears to be uneasy straying too far from the world eaters. Maybe if you take one down together it will not hold as much sway over the gorger.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 4,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The gorger is ecstatic that you took down a worldeater. It's excitement is palpable and it is on the brink of picking you up and carrying out off on a new adventure.>
