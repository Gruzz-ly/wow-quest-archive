==Objectives==
Use the [[Scroll of Dark Empowerment]] to conjure an Anima Conductor.
* [[Anima Conductor]] activated

==Description==
Right. So we got all this [[anima]] you been collecting.

Thing is, all that anima originally got squeezed out of the other realms. The [[Denathrius|Master]], he was big on drainin' anything that weren't him.

So, we set up a Scroll of Dark Empowerment for you on the lower level. Should conjure somefin' strong enough for you to channel anima back into the [[Shadowlands]], by way of Revendreth Wards.

Seems to me there'd be some fringe benefits from somefin like that.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Maw Walker.

==Completion==
It is time to begin restoring anima to the Shadowlands.

==Progression==
...
