==Objectives==
Kill Fata the Soulflayer.
* [[Fata the Soulflayer]] slain

==Description==
Thankfully, I am not the only one who remembers the high calling of the [[Halls of Atonement]] and its servants.

These avowed ritualists have been working covertly to preserve the integrity of the halls.

They report that the [[Lord Chamberlain]] relies on a particularly gifted soulflayer to teach other ritualists how to corrupt the [[soul]]s.

Give him the reward he deserves.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|75|81|60}}
* 13,400 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[The Avowed]]

==Progress==
There is no excuse for preventing our ancient rituals.

==Completion==
His just reward would be the Maw, but this will have to do.

==Notes==
;On accept of all three

:{{Text|say|The Accuser|Meet me inside the Halls of Atonement when you have everything we require.}}

;On approach in the Halls of Atonement
:{{Text|say|The Accuser|I am pleased to find that you have not neglected our sacred duty.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Avowed Ritualist]]|Never! If even one soul can be saved, it is worth it.}}
