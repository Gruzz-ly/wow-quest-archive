==Objectives==
Collect 8 Scorched Planks and 8 Regal Cloth Scraps.
* [[Scorched Plank]] (8)
* [[Regal Cloth Scrap]] (8)
*Speak with Theotar in the Desiccation.

==Description==
Oh [[the Accuser]] sent you? How keen!

I do, in fact, know the fate of [[Prince Renathal]]... at least part of it.

When our assault on the Master's keep failed, we were both captured. I was banished to the [[Ember Ward]], but the Prince was dragged off to [[Sinfall]].

I'm cultivating an escape from this [[Light]]-blighted land to follow after him, but the Light here... it makes it hard to think.

My parasol once protected me, but the ruffians destroyed it. Help me rebuild it, and we'll find the Prince together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|50|60}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
My preferred colors are pink and white, if you can find it.

==Completion==
<Exposure to the Light is clearly causing Theotar to lose control of himself.>

Gubbins... Where are you?

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Theotar|Allow me to apologize in advance for what I will become out there.}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|The Light is... unforgiving to my kind.}}

Theotar will follow the player around and has a bar showing his Willpower. "Venthyr suffer immensely in the Light. They will slowly lose control of themselves." He also has the Shrouded In Darkness buff and Vulnerable to the Light debuff. Try to spend as little time in the Light as possible, though it does not matter. Should players manage to finish all three quests with some willpower left in Theotar's bar, it will instantly drain.

Look for chairs, banners, battle standards, anything. Even mobs will drop cloth.
