==Objectives==
Gather the suspects and meet [[Lajos]] in the large crypt.
* [[Samu]] invited
* [[Ilka]] invited
* Traitor confronted

==Description==
Ilka and Samu argued, you say? And you found a coded message indicating that the tithe was going to be sent out soon. Those are helpful clues that will allow me to put the puzzle together.

It's clear to me now who betrayed the village and what we need to do about it! You deliver invitations to a meeting to our suspects and I'll prepare to reveal the traitor.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ilka's Hunting Cloak
|Samu's Inkwell Pendant
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|12|63|60}}
* 4,450 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
The Master knows what's best for us. We must do our part.

==Completion==
Nice that it all worked out in the end. Thanks for the unintentional help.

==Notes and trivia==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Lajos|Please, don't delay. We don't want the traitor to know that we know ... what we know.}}

;Samu
{{Gossip|Present Lajos's invitation>}}
:{{Text|say|Samu|Argh! Can't you see that I'm busy? What does Lajos want now? Couldn't this be covered in a note instead?}}

;Ilka
{{Gossip|Present Lajos's invitation>}}
:{{Text|say|Ilka|You're new! Oh, what's this? Lajos is having a meeting? Splendid. I do so love the chaos he incites.}}

;In the crypt
:{{Text|say|Samu|What now, Lajos? Unlike you, I'm busy.}}
:{{Text|say|Ilka|Now, now Samu. Tell us all about it Lajos! Who did what to whom? Simply delightful.}}
:{{Text|say|Lajos|Make light of this if you must, but I know you betrayed the village Ilka.}}
:{{Text|say|Ilka|Hahaha. I have no idea what you're talking about, Lajos. You've made a mistake.}}
:{{Text|say|Samu|Easy there, Lajos. Stop pointing that crossbow at Ilka. What proof do you have?}}
:{{Text|say|Lajos|Her coded note about the tithe, for one. But it doesn't matter. You don't need proof when you have instinct.}}
:{{Text|say|Ilka|Instinct? You? That's rich. Besides, a little bat told me that Samu has been skimming anima off the top of the tithe. It's he that has betrayed us.}}
:{{Text|say|Samu|What? Trust me on this, you've made a mistake. Everyone calm down and lower those crossbows or I'll shoot.}}
:''They all shoot at each other, killing themselves.''
:{{Text|say|Rahel|Oh! What a mess!}}
:{{Text|say|Rahel|Inconvenient that my note about the tithe was found but a little whisper here and there and they were willing to blame each other.}}

;On completion
:{{Text|say|Rahel|I didn't realize they'd murder each other but, we do what we must for the greater good. Denathrius must go. Farewell.}}
:''Rahel casts Door of Shadows.''

During the alpha, this quest was renamed from '''Summary Judgement'''.
