==Objectives==

==Description==
Now that I possess [[The Accuser's Sinstone|the Accuser's sinstone]], I can finally end her treasonous charade once and for all!

Protect me while I study this sinstone, and you will be rewarded as first among my retainers.

After I crush her with my incredible power, I will seize control of the [[Halls of Atonement]] and receive the [[Sire Denathrius|Master]]'s reward.

This feat heralds my own ascension to the [[Court of Harvesters]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Tablet of Despair]]
* {{cost|50|54|40}}
* 11,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Lord Chamberlain smiles wryly.>

The Halls of Atonement are under my control.

==Notes==
Speak with the Lord Chamberlain:
:You are fortunate to witness my ascension, mortal.
:{{gossip|I'm ready to witness your ascension.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|I will use the Accuser's sinstone to break her, just like the inquisitors.}}
:{{text|yell|Lord Chamberlain|I name the Accuser her true name... HARRIETT THE CRIMSON SHADE!}}
:{{text|yell|Lord Chamberlain|Who orchestrated the assassinations of countless innocents!}}
:{{text|yell|Lord Chamberlain|Whose every profit came from murder!}}
:{{text|yell|Lord Chamberlain|Who killed her own...}}
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|...W- Why is nothing happening?}}
:{{text|yell|The Accuser|Did you think a Harvester would be so easily broken?}}
:{{text|yell|The Accuser|I keep my sinstone on display for all to see. I am proud of the sins I have overcome in Revendreth!}}
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|Echelon! Maw Walker! Protect me!}}
:{{text|yell|The Accuser|Your stoneborn cannot hinder me. I am a Harvester!}}
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|My medallion must be able to amplify the sinstone somehow...}}
:{{text|yell|The Accuser|So, you know my name? Now know my power!}}

Echelon becomes Drained. Lord Chamberlain (and the Accuser) are Empowered. The Lord Chamberlain's Protection will heal the player for 30% of max health every second. The Accuser has a raid boss level of health, so stay alive and whittle her health down.

After 45 seconds:
:{{text|yell|Lord Chamberlain|I am triumphant!}}
:{{text|yell|Lord Chamberlain|My medallion has made manifest your own accuser! Do you recognize her?}}
:''An image of [[Camille]], a human child, appears.''
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Camille...}}
:{{text|yell|Lord Chamberlain|The daughter you murdered in the dark of night.}}
:{{text|say|Camille|Momma?}}
:{{text|say|Camille|Momma, why did you kill me?}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Oh, my dearest Camille. I did not know it was you! They lied to me! They said-}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|I am so sorry, my dearest. I never meant to hurt you.}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|I think of you every--}}
:{{text|yell|Lord Chamberlain|YOU MURDERED HER! YOUR OWN DAUGHTER!}}
:{{text|yell|The Accuser|You dare manifest my own daughter to torment me?! I have paid for that sin a hundred times over!}}
:{{text|yell|Lord Chamberlain|I have broken through the Accuser's defenses! Crush her while she is weak!}}

The Accuser is now Named and Shames, and now takes 2,000% damage. Finish her off...

:{{text|say|The Accuser|I have... nothing... left...}}
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|And even that I will take from you, traitor!}}

The Lord Chamberlain takes the Accuser to a cage and locks her in.
