'''Reinforcing Revendreth''' is one of the four primary chapters of the Threads of Fate alternate leveling experience for alts in the Shadowlands. Beyond this quest, the game provides no direct advice, but the minimap has been lit up with side quests, bonus objectives, world quests, and the like.

==Objectives==
Aid [[Revendreth]] by completing Side Quests, [[Quest#Bonus Objectives|Bonus Objectives]], [[World quest|World Quests]], and slaying [[Rare mob|rare creatures]]. You may also defeat powerful foes in Revendreth dungeons.
*Aid the [[Venthyr]] (0/100%)

==Description==
[[Denathrius]] must be stopped at all costs. However, we've no hope of taking him out while his forces still control much of Revendreth.

If you are here to aid us, then there is no shortage of work to be done. Disposing of my father's many allies being chief among that work, of course, but any aid you can provide will be of use.

There is too much at stake for all the [[Shadowlands]] if we fail. I will see to it that you are handsomely rewarded for your efforts.

==Progress==
How goes the fight?

==Completion==
You have my sincere gratitude for aiding our cause. Together we will see Denathrius's hold on our realm broken, and with it win the freedom of my people.

I cannot offer as much as I would like, but I hope it will suffice until our victory is achieved.

==Notes==
*For [[Venthyr Covenant]] members, [[Prince Renathal]] is in [[Sinfall]]. You must take the elevator up from [[Sanctuary of the Mad]], climb the hill to the northeast of the elevator landing, head down the circular stairs, and run through the red blood mirror to get inside. For all other players, Renathal is in the [[Darkhaven]] crypt—the building closest to Darkhaven's flight master, [[Courier Rokalai]].
