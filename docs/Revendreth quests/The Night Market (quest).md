==Objectives==
Bring the Hastily Wrapped Package to [[Ta'ruca]] at The [[Night Market]] in [[Revendreth]].
* [[Hastily Wrapped Package]] (provided)

==Description==
<Dracho motions to keep your voice down.>

I need some assistance, I promise you will be paid handsomely.

At the edge of The [[Banewood]] lies some ruins. These ruins are home to a marketplace run by some [[broker]]s. They won't let me back there. Let's just say that my goods were deemed to not be up to their authenticity metrics.

But you... you're a [[Maw Walker]]! Bring them this package and exchange it for some Surberries from [[Ardenweald]].

Just don't say I sent you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, Briar Thorn Roses! Excellent.

Don't go just yet. We need to talk.
