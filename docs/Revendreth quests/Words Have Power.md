==Objectives==
Collect 9 Rebellion Pamphlets.
* [[Join the Prince!]] (9)

==Description==
The [[Stoneborn Rebel]]s have left behind recruitment pamphlets. Recovering these for the [[venthyr]] may earn some much needed favor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Spectral Hankerchief]]
* {{cost|37|90|80}}
* +200 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Uncouth and vile documents, but written in a rather elegant hand. The Prince always had better penmanship than sense.

==Completion==
Ugh, vile things. Give them to me and I will see them properly disposed of.

Here, for your troubles. Perhaps this reward will help wipe the filth of these documents from your fingertips.

==Notes and trivia==
Players will come across this poster at the [[Decimated Crossroad]] after completing [[On The Road Again]].

During the beta, [[The Darkwing Flight Soars With Us!]] and [[The Tithes are a Lie!]] were obtained.

==Progression==
