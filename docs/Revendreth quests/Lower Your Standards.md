==Objectives==
*[[Wild Fungus]] (5)

==Rewards==
You will learn: Humble (Makes your court more Humble.)

==Progress==
<Picky Stefan leans in close and whispers.>

Maw Walker, we are running low on refreshments!

Thankfully, you chose to serve such a humble... "delicacy"  that we can find more just about anywhere.

As you find fungus around the Ember Court, bring them to me and I shall have the dredgers sneak it onto the empty platters.

==Completion==
Normally, I would be far more discerning in what we serve our guests, but this crowd seems to lack my sophisticated palette.

==Notes==
