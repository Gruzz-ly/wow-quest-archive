==Objectives==
Find a Shackle Key among the rubble within [[Ashen Traverse]].
* [[Shackle Key (Revendreth)]]

==Description==
I do not know how long it's been since my captors left me here, but the [[Light]] has... taken its toll.

You must help me escape. The key to my shackles should be hidden nearby. Perhaps among the rubble? That's likely where I'd hide something small.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|25|90}}
* 13,650 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Have you found the key?

==Completion==
This looks like it could fit.

==Notes==
Click on [[Rubble Pile]]s. They give [[Ash Clod]] and [[Fractured Rubble]] and summon an [[Ember Worm]].

==Progression==
{{Revelations of the Light}}
