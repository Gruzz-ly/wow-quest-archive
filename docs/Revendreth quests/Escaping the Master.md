==Objectives==
Collect 10 Mirror Fragments.
* [[Mirror Fragment]] (10)

==Description==
Now more than ever I wish to escape this place, but I cannot go back to serve the [[Denathrius|Master]]. Not after seeing what goes on here.

[[Simone]] and I are in agreement. With your assistance, I will craft a mirror that connects to a sanctuary controlled by the prince. We will leave this place and pledge our support to [[Prince Renathal|Renathal]].

But first, I'll need fragments of glass. The [[Shrouded]] seem to have plenty, and the fewer they have to make traps, the better.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|25|90}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Have you collected the fragments?

==Completion==
<Laurent carefully examines the fragments before speaking.>

Yes, these should work. I'm almost certain.

==Notes==
Kill [[Shrouded Arcanist]]s, [[Shrouded Marauder]]s, [[Shrouded Ritualist]]s, and [[Shrouded Shardsetter]]s to loot the quest item.

==Progression==
{{Mirror Maker of the Master}}
