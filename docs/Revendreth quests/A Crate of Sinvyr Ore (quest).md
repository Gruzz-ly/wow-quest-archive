==Objectives==
Deliver the crate to the [[Old Gate]].

*6,700 [[XP]]

*15x [[Sinvyr Ore]]

==Completion==
Finally! What have you been doing with that shipment! You are a week late and now I am behind, <he sees you starting to talk and carries on>, no I don't want to hear it. I won't be giving you a good review for this delivery, but here is the arranged cut of the shipment.
