==Objectives==
Collect [[Avowed Crypt Key]]s and open crypts until you locate [[Inquisitor Stelia]]'s Sinstone.
* Fly with [[Echelon]] {{co|64.7|50.1|Revendreth}}
* [[Inquisitor Stelia's Sinstone (item)]]
*Meet Echelon outside the Halls of Atonement.

==Description==
You never truly escape your past, [[Maw Walker]].

Every [[venthyr]] once entered [[Revendreth]] as a [[soul]], burdened by the immoralities of their mortal lives.

Like all souls, they carved their true names and most shameful transgressions into sinstones.

Knowledge that intimate can be a potent weapon, if wielded properly.

Locate the sinstones of the inquisitors aiding [[the Accuser]] so that you may kill them. Start with Stelia.

After they're dead, bring me the Accuser's sinstone. I will deal with her myself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Inquisitors hide their sinstones to protect themselves.

==Completion==
Good. [[Temel]] will know how to exploit this sinstone.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|I shall keep the Accuser busy. Find and destroy those inquisitors!}}

Hop on [[Echelon]]:
:{{text|say|Echelon|Sinstones are the most powerful--and despised--weapons in Revendreth.}}
:{{text|say|Echelon|When everyone is running from their past, the worst thing that you can do is shove their faces in it.}}
:{{text|say|Echelon|I will locate the inquisitor. You find her sinstone.}}
:{{text|say|Echelon|Expropriate Temel as well. He knows how to best exploit sinstones.}}

Echelon drops off the player outside a bunch of crypts. He starts the quest [[Temel, the Sin Herald]] automatically. In addition, [[Chiselgrump]] will start an optional, but useful side quest: [[It Used to Be Quiet Here]].

Kill Avowed mobs until they drop an [[Avowed Crypt Key]]. Use the key on a Crypt Door. The first crypt will have a [[Pile of Sinstones]], but not the right one. The second will release a [[Humbled Soul]]:
:{{text|say|Humbled Soul|After eons of solitude... I finally understand...}}
:{{text|say|Humbled Soul|I am ready to let go of my past...}}

The third unleashes a [[Depraved Soul]]:
:{{text|say|Depraved Soul|I will never be forgotten!}}
:{{text|say|Depraved Soul|I... will not... yield...}}

The fourth contains the sinstone in question.

Find Echelon:
:{{text|say|Echelon|I have located the inquisitor. You had better have her sinstone...}}

==Progression==
