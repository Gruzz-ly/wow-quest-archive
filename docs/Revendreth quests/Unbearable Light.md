==Objectives==
Kill 12 ash ghouls.
* [[Ash ghoul]]s slain (12)
*Speak with Theotar in the Desiccation.

==Description==
Have you encountered an ash ghoul yet? Wretches crawling on the ground. Jump on everything. Terrible table manners.

That is the unfortunate fate awaiting all [[venthyr]] exposed to the [[Light]] for too long. The overwhelming pain it causes us breaks our willpower, our mind, and finally our body.

With the right skills, it is possible to reverse the Light's desecration if it is treated quickly.

But the ash ghouls in this Light-burned crater are beyond redemption. There is only one mercy left.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|50|60}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If only I'd been able to help them earlier...

==Completion==
<Exposure to the Light is clearly causing Theotar to lose control of himself.>

My... sincerest apologies...

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Theotar|Allow me to apologize in advance for what I will become out there.}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|The Light is... unforgiving to my kind.}}

Theotar will follow the player around and has a bar showing his Willpower. "Venthyr suffer immensely in the Light. They will slowly lose control of themselves." He also has the Shrouded In Darkness buff and Vulnerable to the Light debuff. Try to spend as little time in the Light as possible, though it does not matter. Should players manage to finish all three quests with some willpower left in Theotar's bar, it will instantly drain.

Eligible mobs are [[Blistering Ash Ghoul]]s, [[Sire Ladinas]], and [[Crazed Ash Ghoul]]s.
