==Objectives==
Eliminate the [[devourer]]s in the [[Banewood]].
* Banewood devourer (12)

==Description==
Though the [[soul]]s are our primary target, another challenge has arisen.

The Banewood has seen an infestation of devourers: disgusting vermin who gorge themselves on the [[anima]] we need to survive. A fitting challenge for any true [[hunter]], no?

I should only thank the Master that they have remained in a few secluded pockets. I loathe to think that their numbers could multiply. Let us exterminate them before they pose a true threat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|50|60}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are the devourers finished?

==Completion==
Once you master fear, all crumble before you.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|Hopebreakers, you may begin.}}

Speak with the Fearstalker, then head out. Before leaving, [[Huntmaster Constantin]] offers an optional side quest: [[Hunting Trophies]].

Eligible mobs are [[Ravenous Thirstlurker]]s, [[Invasive Mite]]s, [[Ruinus Worldeater]]s, and [[Banewood Devourer]]s.

Aggro the first devourer:
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|These vermin are even more disgusting up close.}}

Defeat the last:
:{{text|say|The Fearstalker|Another prey conquered. I have had enough of these... creatures. My hunters can clean up the rest.}}

==Progression==
{{The Penitent Hunt}}
