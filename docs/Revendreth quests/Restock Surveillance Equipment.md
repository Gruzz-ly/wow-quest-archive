*[[Potion of the Hidden Spirit]] (5)
*[[Potion of Shaded Sight]] (5)
*[[Infused Ruby]] (20)

==Description==
I have an urgent matter to discuss.

As you are aware, a murder occurred at the last Ember Court. That is an unacceptable failing on my part and I apologize.

I would like to acquire additional surveillance equipment to ensure we are prepared if it happens again.

After that is resolved, we can discuss security options for future Ember Courts.

==Rewards==
You will learn: {{Abilities|Restock Security|id=339839|icon=inv_crate_03}}

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*9,450 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[The Ember Court]]

==Completion==
I tolerate many questionable activities in the court, but murder will not be one of them.

The full breadth of our Security options are available to us now.

==Notes==
;On completion
:{{text|say|Watchmaster Boromod|I will distribute this among our troops as needed. Let's discuss security options.}}
