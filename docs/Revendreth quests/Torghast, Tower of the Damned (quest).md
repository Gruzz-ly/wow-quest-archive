==Objectives==
Recover [[Prince Renathal|Renathal's]] Allies from [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned]].
* Find an entrance to Torghast {{co|31.4|12.5|Maw}}
* Enter Skoldus Hall, Torghast
* Ascend to the Chamber of Power
* Warden of Souls slain
* Enter the Ritual of Soul Tracing

==Description==
My allies were taken into the Tower of the Damned, and so we must follow.

I do not think we must venture deep into those halls, which is good as I do not believe either of us is in shape for a fight like that.

Come, let us find our way to one of the most dangerous towers in all of existence.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Stolen Maw Badge]]
* {{cost|51|1|20}}
* 11,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is only a matter of time before the Master detects my presence. We must be swift and violent of action if we are to stop [[Denathrius|Sire Denathrius]].

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Vorpalia|Come, we need to get you out of here. Maw Walker, get us out of here.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|No. No, I cannot leave my allies behind. I am the reason they are here. We must sneak in to Torghast.}}

Head north into the [[Tremaculum]] to find a [[Portal to Torghast]].

Accept the dungeon invite to zone into the instance. This is a preview of [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned|Torghast]] mechanics. Head west to the floor exit:
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|The inside of this tower defies all traditional logic... we must devise a means of escape.}}
:{{text|say|Vorpalia|You do realize I am a floating sword, do you not? I can easily move between these massive cell grates.}}
:''Vorpalia smacks the lever and the gate falls.''

Interact with the [[Anima Hoard]] to make a choice between two power ups:
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Ah! A cell of anima. Use it to gain power, Maw Walker. Let us ascend.}}

Make a choice, then run up the stairs to the next level.

===Ascend the Tower===
*Save souls, seek power, and defeat the Jailer's forces.

====Floor 1====
This is a safe area, allowing equipment and talent changes. Once set, head forward and start killing mobs to make it to the next area. Nearly all mobs drop [[Phantasma]], a Torghast-only currency.

Make it to the end of the first level to find another Anima Hoard:
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|I can hear the walls shifting above. Let us see what awaits us.}}

====Floor 2====
On this floor, players will come across the first traps:
*{{Abilities|Massive Scythe|A massive scythe inflicts Physical damage and causes targets struck to bleed for additional Physical damage every 3 sec for 30 sec.|id=306772|icon=inv_archaeology_80_witch_bonescythe|notes=A massive swinging scythe that does 10,000 damage and knocks the player back.}}
*{{Abilities|Soul Emanation|Inflicts Shadow damage to targets struck, moving their soul unpredictably.|id=306670|icon=ability_argus_soulburst|notes=A brazier that constantly spawns missiles targeting the ground. Deals roughly 6,000 damage to players standing in the whirly when the missile lands.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Deadly traps litter these hallways. We must take care.}}

Additionally, a rare elite will be found, the [[Seeker of Souls]]:
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|A powerful servant of the Jailer! No doubt it guards something valuable.}}

Pull it away from the brazier, then kill it for a bonus Anima Hoard. There's another locked hoard behind a gate. Finally, head for the exit to loot a third hoard.

====Floor 3====
The third floor introduces bosses and brokers. Before engaging the boss, check in with [[Broker Ve'nott]] to purchase some useful items with [[Phantasma]].

The boss of this floor is the [[Warden of Souls]]:
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|This must be the guardian of these floors. Let us dispose of it.}}

Get out of the pools it spawns, kill the adds, and take it out.
:{{text|say|The Curator|Renathal. You came back! How long have we been here? This... place... it is eating my mind.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Curator! I am so glad you have not been broken yet. We need an exit portal.}}
:{{text|say|The Curator|This is the Maw. No one escapes the Maw. We would need a-}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Maw Walker, this is the Curator, one of the greatest archivists in reality.}}
:{{text|say|The Curator|A... Maw Walker? Quickly, I can use them as a conduit. We can ride back along the path they took to get here but it will only work once. Maw Walker, this will... hurt. Please try not to die.}}

===Finale===
On the other side of the forced teleport, the player, [[Prince Renathal]], [[the Curator (venthyr)|the Curator]], [[Devahia]] and [[Tenaval]] are back in [[Sinfall]]:
:{{text|say|The Curator|Oh, that worked? And the Maw Walker survived! Fantastic. Um... best not leave the Maw like that again. It may undo your existence.}}
