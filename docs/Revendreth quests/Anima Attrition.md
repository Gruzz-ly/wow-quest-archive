==Objectives==
Recover the Anima Canister.
* [[Anima Canister (item)]] {{co|68.8|63.7|Revendreth}}

==Description==
This is not some simple raid or protest. These [[stoneborn]] mean to steal the [[anima]] this convoy was carrying.

That anima was destined to be tithed to the Master. There is a drought on and we cannot let these vagabonds and miscreants steal our hard earned anima.

Recover the tithe if you can and I will see to your notoriety.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you found?

==Completion==
Well done, mortal. Stoneborn require anima to exist. Without it, they return to their stone form. This supply hurt them more than destroying thirty of their rebels.

==Notes==
On accept of both quests:
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|You, with the ugly face, ride the carriage off in a different direction as a distraction.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|Mortal, we should split up to avoid being an easier target. Try not to die...}}

Just to the north, a poster exhorts all comers to [[Join the Rebellion!]], which starts an optional side quest, [[Words Have Power]]. Pick it up or not, then head north and start killing.

The [[Anima Canister (item)]] is sitting on a platform at the north end of the quest area. Interact with it and [[Jovraal]] swoops down to attack!
