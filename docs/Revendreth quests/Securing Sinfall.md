==Description==
They're all still active...

The [[stoneborn]], the [[gargon]], the [[stone fiend]]s... All of 'em!

Don't got much time. They're always watching.

<Breakfist points up.>

[[Vulca]] told me to follow that big beam of Light in the sky.

Goes to a tower guarded by a big old brute, though. Couldn't get in.

==Completion==
Now that we have cleared out the Master's forces, let us continue the search for Prince Renathal!

==Notes==
Eligible mobs are [[Lingering Monitor]]s (5%), [[Lurking Monitor]]s (7-8%), [[Restless Monitor]]s (14-15%), and [[Silent Monitor]]s (14-15%).

Additionally, loot Restrained Swords from the area to gain some temporary abilities:
:{{Abilities|Animated Sword|Wielding an animated sword. Parry chance increased by 25%. Cannot cast spells or use abilities.|id=328916|icon=inv_sword_1h_draenorcrafted_d_02_c_horde|notes=30 sec duration}}
#{{Abilities|Follow Its Lead|Allow the animated sword to choose your next target, lunging at a nearby random enemy.|range=15|cd=1.5 sec|id=328932|icon=ability_warrior_shockwave|notes=Instant}}
#{{Abilities|Animated Speed|Give the animated sword more freedom to control your movements, increasing attack speed by 200% and movement speed by 50% for 8 sec.|cd=10 sec|id=328978|icon=ability_rogue_slicedice|notes=Instant}}
#{{Abilities|Final Strike|Ready a final attack to damage, silence, and disarm your current enemy target for 3 sec. Your animated sword will be destroyed in the process.|id=328927|icon=ability_warrior_incite|range=6|notes=1 sec cast}}
#{{Abilities|Discard|Discard the animated sword, regaining your normal abilities.|id=328931|icon=ability_blackhand_marked4death|notes=Instant}}

The sword has some lines:
;Upon grabbing
*{{text|whisper|Animated Sword|Oh, how I have longed to return to the fight...}}
*{{text|whisper|Animated Sword|In exchange for freeing me, I will help you kill your enemies... for a time...}}
*{{text|whisper|Animated Sword|Point me at your enemies and I will take care of the rest.}}

;Upon attacking
*{{text|whisper|Animated Sword|More... I crave more....}}
*{{text|whisper|Animated Sword|Our strike is true!}}
*{{text|whisper|Animated Sword|Together now! Strike!}}

;Upon a mob dying
*{{text|whisper|Animated Sword|I am finished with this one.}}
*{{text|whisper|Animated Sword|Another notch on my hilt...}}
*{{text|whisper|Animated Sword|Another falls...}}
*{{text|whisper|Animated Sword|I shall finish this!}}

;Upon despawning
:{{text|whisper|Animated Sword|My purpose is fulfilled!}}

Kill a path uphill to the [[Spire of the Unseen Guests]], where Rorok guards the way:
:{{text|say|Grand Monitor Rorok|No one escapes the Ember Ward!}}

Defeat him:
:{{text|say|Grand Monitor Rorok|The Master... will know...}}

Inside, keep killing a path up the tower to reach the [[Scorching Mirror]]. Interact with it and a cutscene plays.

On the other side, all of the hostiles are gone, and Theotar, Vulca, and the rest of the party are upstairs.
