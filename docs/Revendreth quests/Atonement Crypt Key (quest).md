==Objectives==
Open an Atonement Crypt.
* [[Atonement Crypt]] opened

==Description==
<This key is marked with a sigil that matches the crypts in the [[Halls of Atonement]]. What is the [[Lord Chamberlain]] hiding away in there?>

==Rewards==
You will learn: Atonement Crypts (You can now find Atonement Crypt Keys in the Halls of Atonement.)

You will also receive:
* {{cost|18|95|40}}
* 6,700 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Avowed|The Avowed]]

==Completion==
The atonement crypts are meant to be used as storage for souls who require additional... processing before their next ritual.

The Lord Chamberlain's idiots are using them like prison cells and treasure rooms. You are doing us all a favor by opening them whenever you find a key.
