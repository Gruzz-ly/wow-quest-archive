==Objectives==
Clear Taskmaster Matyas's followers from [[Witherfall Ruins]].
* [[Taskmaster Matyas|Matyas]]' followers killed (12)
*Meet up with Nadjia at Witherfall Ruins.

==Description==
Thanks to you, <name>, I am free of Matyas's control for the first time in ... well, a very long time.

Now, together, we will seek my vengeance.

I've laid a solemn duty upon you by naming you as my second for this duel. I know not the code in your homelands but in mine, it is your task to secure the field. Matyas and his followers are garrisoned at Witherfall Ruin nearby. Unless I miss my guess, that's where he will have run.

I will prepare for the battle and join you soon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|37|90|80}}
* 13,400 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Have you dispatched Matyas's minions?

==Completion==
Well, he's certainly chosen a scenic location for a fight.

==Notes==
;On accept of both
:{{Text|say|Nadjia the Mistblade|At least some of Matyas's followers are forced to serve him, as I was. Free them if you can.}}

Eligible mobs are [[Briarbane Footman|Briarbane Footmen]], [[Briarbane Arbalest]]s, [[Bladewing Guard]]s, and [[Briarbane Cavalier]]s.

Nearing the [[Vine Ladder]]
