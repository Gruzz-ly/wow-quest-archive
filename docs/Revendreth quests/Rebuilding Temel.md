==Objectives==
Collect [[Temel]]'s Head, Arms, and Wings.
* [[Temel's Body]]
* [[Temel's Wings]]
* [[Temel's Head]]

==Description==
[[Revendreth]] demands penance from all, and it would appear that even you are not exempt..

<Cryptkeeper Kassir grins.>

Do not fear, I have no intention of exacting revenge for that nasty violence you inflicted upon me earlier.

But I cannot offer you Temel either.

You see, the [[Lord Chamberlain]]--who you so wisely chose to install as master of these halls--deemed Temel a threat to his control here.

His thugs bashed Temel to bits and scattered the pieces among these crypts. Find them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|50|54|40}}
* 11,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[The Avowed]]

==Progress==
No matter how broken Temel is, I can rebuild him.

==Completion==
<Cryptkeeper Kassir inspects the pieces of Temel you brought him.>

They bashed you real good, didn't they, Temel? Nothing I cannot fix...
