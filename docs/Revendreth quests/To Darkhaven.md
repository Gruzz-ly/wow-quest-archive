==Objectives==
Escort Lord Chamberlain to Darkhaven.
* Speak with the [[Lord Chamberlain]]
* [[Darkhaven]] reached

==Description==
Across [[Repentance Bridge|this bridge]] is the hamlet of Darkhaven. It is fortified by those loyal to [[Sire Denathrius]]. These pitiful rebels would not dare approach it.

However, getting to it may prove challenging. Here, I shall carry the [[anima]], you make sure no one throws us back into the [[Endmire]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|27|20}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It may not look like it, but this rebellion is on its last leg. Those who stand against the Master are fools who will know a new form of pain and suffering.

==Notes==
Speak with the Lord Chamberlain again:
:I serve at the pleasure of the Master, Sire Denathrius. He was the first, you know, and those of us who came after were remade in his image.
:{{gossip|Ready.}}

As the chamberlain moves across the bridge, a handful of [[Rebel Minion]]s fly up to attack. Fend them off and keep up.

Across the bridge in Darkhaven:
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|Ah, Darkhaven. They welcome anyone here. No sense of propriety. At least up in the Castle there is an order as to who is permitted.}}

This concludes the "Welcome to Revendreth" chapter of the [[Revendreth storyline]]. The campaign continues with [[The Stoneborn]].
