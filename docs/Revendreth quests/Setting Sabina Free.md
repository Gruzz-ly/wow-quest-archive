==Objectives==
Release Sabina from her shackles.
* Release [[Sabina]]
* Sabina slain

==Description==
Release me. Please, you must do so. I cannot linger in the [[Light]] any longer.

This unease, it's so... familiar, but it will pass. I will feel myself once again, once I have returned to the shade.

I'll stay as still as silence while you work the lock.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|25|90}}
* 13,650 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Completion==
Sabina's end has found her. Ash is all that remains.

==Notes==
Click on [[Shackles]].
