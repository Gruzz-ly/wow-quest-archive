==Objectives==
Speak with the "help" in the village to find clues to the identity of the traitor.
* [[Courier Rokalai]] clue found
* [[Globknob]] clue found
*[[Soul of Keltesh]] clue found

==Description==
If you ask me, the attack on our convoy is suspicious. I told [[Mistress Mihaela]] that there must be a traitor in the village, but she isn't concerned. It's understandable, she's got to worry about gathering a new tithe.

I've taken it upon myself to figure this out and I could use your help. I'm making discreet inquiries but I can't be seen speaking with the help. That's where you come in. You can be my assistant sleuth.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]
* +50 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Have you identified the traitor yet?

==Completion==
Well, isn't that interesting information you've dug up.

:{{Text|say|Bela|And now, Keltesh, have you noticed anything suspicious?}}
:{{Text|say|Soul of Keltesh|I hesitate, how would I know what is suspicious? Samu and Ilka quarreled here over the tithe and drought. Is that suspicious?}}
