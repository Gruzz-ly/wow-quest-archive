==Objectives==
Search Sinfall for any signs of [[Prince Renathal]].
* Use a mirror to enter [[Sinfall]]. {{co|29.4|42.6|Revendreth}}
* Find a clue
*Speak with Vorpalia.

==Description==
Well, here we are, Sinfall.

Last I saw the Master was dragging Prince Renathal and his most loyal followers here in a prison convoy. However, this is a forbidden place, wrapped in rumors and mystery. I heard it was once the workshop of [[Denathrius]], where he performed dark experiments.

Intriguing to be sure, but we are here to find Renathal. Search below, but proceed with caution. I will send word for [[the Accuser]] to make her way here with what allies she can muster.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|55|5}}
* 970 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Flesh that walks and talks in the Shadowlands. Interesting.

==Completion==
I will sever your head from your body should you...

Wait...

You are still alive? That means you are... the Maw Walker?

==Notes==
Note the stairs behind the quest givers and follow them downstairs to a blood mirror. Head down the next set of stairs to find a floating sword, [[Vorpalia]], wandering around.

==Progression==
{{Prince Renathal}}
