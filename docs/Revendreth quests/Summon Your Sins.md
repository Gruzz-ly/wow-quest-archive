==Objectives==
*{{item|Sinstone Fragment (Summon Your Sins)|Sinstone Fragments}} collected (20)
*Catalyst chosen
*Amalgamation created

==Description==
:{{text|say|[[The Accuser]]|[[Sinstone]]s carry more than just the weight of one's past, they also contain quite a bit of [[anima]]. Fragments will eventually amalgam on their own, but we can use alchemy to accelerate the process.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Amalgamation of Sin (item)]] or [[Amalgamation of Sin (item)#Rare]]
*9,450 [[XP]]
*+125 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Harvesters]]

You may also receive one of the following:
*[[Anima]]
*[[Money]]

==Completion==
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Splendid work. I am sure your creation will be positiively sinful!}}

==Notes==
Upon obtaining all the fragments, go to the building on the upper level of the [[Catacombs of Regret]]. Inside you'll find [[Alchemist Leticia]] and an alchemy lab, with three catalysts on the table: Catalyst of Might, Catalyst of Renewal, and Catalyst of Power. Select one and then speak to Leticia:

:I see you have chosen a catalyst, very good.
:We can begin the acceleration process whenever you are ready.
:{{gossip|I am ready.}}

:''Leticia walks over to the alchemy table.''
:{{text|say|Alchemist Leticia|The process is fickle, but fast.}}
:{{text|say|Alchemist Leticia|Our outcome is dependant on the nature of the sins within these fragments.}}
:{{text|say|Alchemist Leticia|Some will strengthen the amalgamation, others will increase its resilience.}}
:{{text|say|Alchemist Leticia|Of course, there's always the chance for an outlier...}}
:{{text|say|Alchemist Leticia|Success! The process is complete.}}
