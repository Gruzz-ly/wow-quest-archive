'''Dark Aspirations''' starts the [[Revendreth]] chapter of the [[The Threads of Fate]] alternate leveling experience in the Shadowlands.

==Objectives==
;Non-Venthyr
Speak to [[Prince Renathal]] in the crypt beneath [[Darkhaven]] in [[Revendreth]].

;Venthyr Covenant
Speak to Prince Renathal in [[Sinfall]] in Revendreth.

==Description==
Prince Renathal has started a daring rebellion against his father, the nefarious [[Sire Denathrius]] who betrayed us all by pouring Revendreth's vast [[anima]] stores into the [[Maw]].

You must travel to Revendreth and aid Renathal in his efforts. He is our best hope at restoring Revendreth to order.

[[Pathscribe Roh-Avonavi]] in the [[Ring of Transference]] above can provide transport.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
And to what do I owe the pleasure of a mortal visiting Revendreth at such an...inopportune time?

==Progression==
{{The Threads of Fate}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.0.2|note=Added.}}
