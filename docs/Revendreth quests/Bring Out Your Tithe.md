==Objectives==
Collect anima from the village for the tithe.
*Tithe [[anima]] collected (0/100%)

==Description==
Unfortunately the [[Lord Chamberlain]]'s gift isn't sufficient to cover the entire tithe we're expected to provide the [[Tithelord]], but it will make a good start.

The loss of the tithe convoy is a terrible blow to our village. Our little community is already suffering greatly from the drought and the need to meet the Tithelord's demands. Still we must all do our part.

We have little time to accomplish this task. Can you help? Get the tithe from villagers and scour the area for every forgotten drop.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered the anima yet?

==Completion==
I was not sure this task was possible. Very impressive work.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Mistress Mihaela|Get the tithe from villagers where you can and scour the area for every forgotten drop.}}

Click on [[Droplets of Anima]] and speak with [[Darkhaven Villager]]s to fill up the bar.

;In the center
:The master has said sacrifices are required.
:{{Gossip|<Request tithe>}}
:{{Text|say|
:{{text|say|Darkhaven Villager|I suppose it doesn't matter that I gave extra last time?}}
:{{text|say|Darkhaven Villager|The souls in my charge simply can't give more. I will have to give of myself rather than risk them.}}
:{{text|say|Darkhaven Villager|Uhhh. Too much ...}}
:''The villager casts Tithe Anima, and then they get the Tithed Too much debuff.''

;Near the cages
:We are nothing if not expert at suffering. We will get through this.}}
:{{Gossip|<Request tithe>}}
:{{text|say|Darkhaven Villager|Is this really necessary? We already gathered the tithe at great cost to the village.}}
:{{text|say|Darkhaven Villager|Maybe I can get a bit more. Let's see.}}
:{{text|say|Drained Soul|Nooooo. Not again. I can't ...}}
:{{text|say|Darkhaven Villager|We must all make sacrifices. The Master demands it.}}
:{{text|say|Drained Soul|Aahhhh! Nooooo. No more ... Arggghhhh!}}
:{{text|say|Darkhaven Villager|The soul is devoid of anima now, fully drained. There will be no redemption after countless eons of suffering. A pity.}}
:''The villager casts Harvest Anima on a nearby ghost. It becomes a Drained Soul.''

;With [[Veronika]]
:When will the drought end?
:{{Gossip|<Request tithe>}}
:{{text|say|Darkhaven Villager|Another tithe? But, I have no souls left and no surplus of anima. Did Mistress Mihaela not tell you to exempt me ...}}
:{{text|say|Veronika|Easy, dear. I can tithe for us both.}}
:{{text|say|Darkhaven Villager|Oh, no Veronika! You cannot spare the anima either. We must tell Mistress Mihaela that this is impossible.}}
:{{text|say|Veronika|No, no. We must all do our part. I know you'd do the same for me.}}
:{{text|say|Veronika|Uhhh. Too much ...}}
:''Veronika casts Tithe Anima and then gets the Tithed Too Much buff.''
