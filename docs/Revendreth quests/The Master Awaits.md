==Objectives==
Meet [[Denathrius|Sire Denathrius]].
* Ride [[Myskia]] {{co|60.3|60.8|Revendreth}}
* Follow [[General Kaal]]

==Description==
[[Maw Walker]], I am General Kaal. Those [[stoneborn]] who remember their oaths to the Master are under my command.

The path between here and Sire Denathrius is no longer secured by my forces. I am pulling my troops from this ward to support the Master's will elsewhere.

Sire Denathrius has dispatched me to bring you directly to him. Myskia can carry you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|52|70}}
* 970 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Mind your manners when speaking to Sire Denathrius. He is a being older than [[Azeroth|your world]].

==Completion==
Wait! Please, Maw Walker, allow me to announce you to the Master.

==Notes==
Hop on [[Myskia]] to get a lift over the gap to the [[Grand Palisade]]. On the other side, [[General Grashaal]] and [[General Kaal]] have a conversation:
:{{text|say|General Grashaal|Kaal, stop holding back. Let my forces crush Draven and his traitors.}}
:{{text|say|General Kaal|Draven is not our threat. Their prince has fallen and their rebellion is in shambles. Only the Accuser remains to issue orders.}}
:{{text|say|General Grashaal|The Accuser? She still holds a Harvester's medallion. How are we going to defeat her?}}
:{{text|say|General Kaal|Now you know why we need this Maw Walker alive.}}

On complete, a cutscene plays:
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|My children, I know the suffering you have endured.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|I fear further sacrifices must be made if Revendreth is to survive this crisis.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|Begging my Master's pardon.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Chamberlain|I humbly present... the Maw Walker.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|Ah! The mortal who escaped the inescapable prison. A living soul restoring hope to the realms eternal.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|Maw Walker, I am aware of your urgent request for anima. Under normal circumstances, I would of course oblige.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|Sadly, you arrive in the midst of a violent rebellion. Our resources are stretched perilously thin.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|This drought has left my people desperate...}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|...starving...}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|...and some, even defiant.}}
:{{text|say|Sire Denathrius|But if you were to aid our cause, then I could gratefully provide the aid you seek.}}
