;Speaking with Morgan
:What have you brought me?

:{{Gossip|<Give the Endmire Blossom to Morgan.>}}

::An exquisite find, indeed. When ingested, these endmire blossoms have a calming effect on devourers, allowing them to be tamed.

::The effects are temporary, however. For the beast to remain docile, you must continue to feed it flowers.

::Are you ready to begin?

::{{Gossip|I am ready.}}
