==Objectives==
Purchase a bottle of Kaja'Extreme from [[Ta'tru]] at the [[Night Market]].
*[[Kaja'Extreme]]
*[[Spicy Scorchshrooms]] (provided)

==Description==
If he be hostin' fancy courts with you and [[Temel]], this dredger's gotta be special...

Smarter. Stronger. Quicker to apologize when they accidentally knock over the refreshments table and spill anima all over some poor duchess...

I got an idea! [[Broker]] bloke at the [[Night Market]] was tryin' to sell me some important drinks. Kaja'Extreme or somethin'. 

Says it bigguns the brain, yeah? That's just what we need!

Take these [[Spicy Scorchshrooms|Scorchshrooms]], that broker loves them, but note he rotates his costs each week.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|3|80}}
* 7,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You got the Kaja'Extreme?

==Completion==
Alright, <name>, let's make some muck!

==Progression==
{{Homegrown Help}}

==Beta version==

Hmm, now for a [[dredger]] assistant we will need something extra to get them up to speed quicker and be ready to learn at every turn.

I got an idea. A broker at the Night Market recently imported a shipment of Kaja'Extreme from your [[Azeroth|mortal world]]. I think that will have just the right amount of kick and inspiration. Once we have that in hand I can prepare an infusion for you to get this assistant cooking.
