==Notes==
Speak with Tubbins again:
:I got the recipe in me noggin, don't worry.
:{{gossip|I'll help you make the tea for Theotar.}}
:{{text|say|Tubbins|You rest! Tubbins make tea.}}
:{{text|say|Gubbins|Tea make Theotar happy...}}
:{{text|say|Gubbins|I like happy!}}
:{{text|say|Tubbins|Think hard, Tubbins... recipe was...}}
:{{text|say|Tubbins|Three parts smelly stuff!}}

Tubbins tosses items on the ground. Stand in the green circles to catch them, then run over to the [[Makeshift Mortar]] to drop them.
:{{text|say|Tubbins|Four parts rank rocks!}}

Tubbins throws in a less catchable pattern this time, but no matter. He'll throw rocks as often as necessary until four have been added.
:{{text|say|Tubbins|Two parts burny bumps!}}

This time, Tubbins throws five and they all land at the same time. Impossible to catch both in one go.
:{{text|say|Tubbins|One part wicked wood!}}

Two get tossed, but only one is needed.
:{{text|say|Tubbins|All-fingers parts prickly pokers!}}

Tubbins throws all ten thorns in very quick succession.
:{{text|say|Tubbins|Last part need teapot. You get. Tubbins tired.}}

The [[Dented Teapot]] in the corner by the campfire lights up. Pick it up, then run over to the pot, adding [[Liquid Shadows]] that is the [[venthyr]] [[anima]]:
:{{text|say|Gubbins|Troubly bubbly taste bad...}}
:{{text|say|Tubbins|...But Theotar says always add it!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Tubbins|Tea always make Theotar feel good.}}
:{{text|say|Tubbins|Wakey, wakey...}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|Hello, darkness, my old friend...}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|My dear Tubbins! Those extravagant new flavors almost make the pain bearable.}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|Gubbins, I presume you've reconstructed my parasol by now?}}
:{{text|say|Gubbins|Yes! Gubbins do good!}}
:{{text|say|Theotar|Indeed you do, my friend. More than most.}}
