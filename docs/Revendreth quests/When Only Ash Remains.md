==Objectives==
Kill 10 Ashen Ravagers.
* [[Ashen Ravager]] slain (10)

==Description==
Is this really what becomes of the exiled? Are they left here to burn to ash?

How could the [[Denathrius|Master]] allow such a thing? It is cruel. Heartless, even.

You must end their suffering.

==Progress==
Oh please tell me you've put them out of their misery?

==Completion==
I thought I knew our sire, but anyone who would do this to his subjects is not worth following.
