==Objectives==
Release [[Nadjia the Mistblade]].
*[[Consecrated Iron Cage|Release]] Nadjia the Mistblade
*Pique Nadjia's Interest (0/100%)

==Description==
A [[mortal]] in [[Revendreth]]. Well, well, well... you are primed to be at the head of high adventure.

The name you may call me is Nadjia the Mistblade, and, if I might be so humble as to say, I am the finest [[duelist]] that has ever wielded a sword.

This trap you found me in was a lesson learned in getting paid in advance. Release me and my blade is yours to command for as long as I find you interesting.

Do we have an accord?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Master Duelist's Chit]]
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
That consecrated iron really leaves one feeling stiff afterward.

==Completion==
That was FUN! I have not felt so alive in centuries. Everything about you is just... different, and invigorating.

I can continue to assist you until you are ready to leave the Endmire but then we will need to part ways for a time. I have some unfinished business regarding someone who put me in a cage.

==Notes==
On [[Bottom Feeders]], players almost immediately come across [[Nadjia the Mistblade]], who offers this quest. On approach:
:{{text|yell|Nadjia the Mistblade|Mortal! Over here!}}

Break the [[Consecrated Iron Cage]]:
:{{Text|Yell|Nadjia the Mistblade|Yes! Free at last! Come my new friend, let us bring ruin upon something. Anything.}}

An optional, but highly encouraged quest, [[The Endmire (quest)]] is started by [[Tessle the Snitch]], just north of Nadjia's position.

Kill mobs in the area, including: [[Devourer Mite]]s, [[Dread Gorger]]s, [[Manifestation of Rage]], [[Manifestation of Gluttony]], [[Unbidden Worldeater]]s, [[Ravenous Animite]]s, and [[Endlurker]]s.

When players encounter their first devourer:
:{{Text|Say|Nadjia the Mistblade|Devourers! They are chewing at the foundation of our realm. I have never seen so many.}}

==Progression==
{{Welcome to Revendreth}}
