==Objectives==
Meet [[the Accuser]] at [[Absolution Crypt]].

==Description==
I have no quarrel with you, Maw Walker.

The [[Lord Chamberlain]] and his abhorrent followers have debased these halls with their perversions of the rituals. Abusing [[soul]]s and destroying their potential for pathetic mockeries of power.

The Accuser would never have allowed this. I have heard rumors that you may still be in contact with her. If so, please inform her of the situation here.

She will bring these depraved dogs to heel.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|52|70}}
* 970 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I am already working to undo the Lord Chamberlain's mistakes.

Yes, you may assist me.
