==Objectives==
Purchase a [[hippogryph]] ride to the [[Exodar]] from [[Zaldaan]]. When you land, take Chellan's List to [[Nurguni]] in the [[Seat of the Naaru]] at the [[Exodar]]. 
*[[Chellan's List]] (provided)

==Description==
For a small fee, you can rent one of my hippogryphs to fly you to the [[Exodar]].

Taking the hippogryph is a faster, not to mention safer, alternative for someone carrying an important message. If you'd like to take a ride, speak to me again and I'll make the arrangements.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*420 [[XP]] (or {{cost||2|40}} at level 80)
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Completion==
So you've brought Chellan's list. Excellent! I was hoping to receive this today. Let's see what he needs.

<[[Nurguni]] reads over the list and begins placing various items in a box.>

That's most of what he requested. The pieces for the beds are simply too large to be delivered by hippogryph, but I'll make arrangements to have them sent by wagon.
