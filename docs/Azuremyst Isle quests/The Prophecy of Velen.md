This quest starts the '''The Prophecy of Velen''' quest chain.

==Objectives==
[[Daedal]] wants you to travel south and seek out the people that the injured creature mentioned.

==Description==
[[Velen|The Prophet]] spoke of this day: That on this island, in this [[Azeroth|new world]], [[Alliance|our allies]] would find us.

"We will be tested. They will ask that we pay for the sins of [[Eredar|our fathers]]..."

At the time, I did not understand the meaning behind his words, but seeing this creature and her reaction to us, it is now coming into focus. The [[Man'ari eredar|corruption of our people]] has been felt even here.

Venture south. It is there that we found this being. Find its kin and tell them of our people.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*525 [[XP]] (or {{cost||3|30}} at level 70)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Completion==
You say that you've found one of our crew and that she is injured? I will send one of my crewmen to your village immediately!

==Progression==
