Having discovered the corruption in the cave, and having spotted [[The Kurken]], you are now asked to go back in and slay it.

This quest is part of the {{questchain|Stillpine Hold}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
[[Kurz the Revelator]] at [[Stillpine Hold]] on [[Azuremyst Isle]] wants you to kill [[The Kurken]] and bring back The Kurken's Hide.
* [[The Kurken's Hide]]

==Description==
After the crystal storm had subsided, a beast of myth appeared in our village. Brought here by the invading wildkin, this beast, the Kurken, laid waste to our village. Many Stillpine were slain in defense of our lands by this fiend and many have since lost their lives attempting to subdue the beast.

In my visions, I have seen one defeat the Kurken. The one must be you, <name>. You are our only hope. Enter Stillpine Hold and slay the Kurken. Bring me his hide as proof of deed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||7|20}}
* 1150 [[XP]]
* +125 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
<Kurz grunts at you.>

==Completion==
The Promised One has emerged victorious!

The prophecy is nearly complete. Now about that hide...

==Notes==
The Kurken is lurkin' at coordinates 49,12.  Enter the cave.  Where it forks, go left, and on into the back of the cave where the red crystal is.

On completion of this quest, both [[The Kurken's Hide (quest)]] and [[Warn Your People]], offered by [[High Chief Stillpine]], become available.
