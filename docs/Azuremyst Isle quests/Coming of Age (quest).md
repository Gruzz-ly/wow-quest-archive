==Description==
You have survived the wilds of our new home and shown yourself a cut above the others. I believe that you have come of age to assist those battling on the front lines of [[Bloodmyst Isle|Bloodmyst]]. The [[Hand of Argus]] could use a <race> like you.

Report to [[Torallius the Pack Handler]]. You will find him outside the [[Exodar]], tending to the [[elekk]]. Give him these orders so that he may direct you towards your new duties on Bloodmyst.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 90 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==

This is the best we can offer the hand of Argus?

Alright, let me have a look at those orders.
