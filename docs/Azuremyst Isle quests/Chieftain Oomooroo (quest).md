==Objectives==
Stillpine the Younger at [[Stillpine Hold]] on [[Azuremyst Isle]] wants you to slay [[Chieftain Oomooroo]] and 9 [[Crazed Wildkin]].
*[[Chieftain Oomooroo]] slain
*[[Crazed Wildkin]] slain (9)

==Description==
I am [[Stillpine the Younger]], heir to the Stillpine legacy. As you can see, my defenders have set up a death trap for the raving [[wildkin]] that attack from inside Stillpine Hold. While we are able to hold them off out here, none of my defenders have been able to infiltrate the hold. If you could get inside and slay their leader, it might give us an opportunity to strike!

Find [[Chieftain Oomooroo]] and destroy him. Slay any crazed wildkin that you encounter inside as well.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

==Completion==
This may very well be the opportunity that we needed! I will send an attack at once! The [[Stillpine]] thank you for your service, <name>!
