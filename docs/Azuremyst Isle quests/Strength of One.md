==Objectives==
Unlock the Ravager Cage and kill the [[Death Ravager]], then return to [[Ruada]] at [[Azure Watch]] in Azuremyst.
*[[Death Ravager]] slain
*[[Ravager Cage Key]] (provided)

==Description==
When the ship crashed, our menagerie was scattered on the northeast beaches of this isle. I have been handed a key that unlocks the cage holding one of the deadlier specimens, a death ravager. The creature is little armored but resistant to most magic. It must be killed by a simple blade.

Take this key and release the creature from both its prison and its pain. We cannot afford to have it escape and cause even more damage to the ecology than we already have.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*850 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|10}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Exodar}}

==Progress==
Have you put down the beast?

==Completion==
<Ruada nods solemnly.>

Then it is done.

You are ready for your next lesson, <name>, but I will not be the one to teach it to you.

==Notes==
This quest chain is Warrior only.
