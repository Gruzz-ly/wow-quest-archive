===The Prophecy of Velen===
[[Anchorite Fateema]] starts a quest chain that sends players to Odesyus Landing to meet with a shipwrecked Alliance crew. The crew's captain, a human named Odesyus, suspects that there is [[Engineer "Spark" Overgrind|a traitor]] within his ranks, and in the quest [[Tree's Company]], players discover who it is. The traitor turns out to be a spy, tasked by a mysterious "[[Kael'thas Sunstrider|Master]]"  with finding the Exodar and potentially sabotaging it further. This quest chain also sends the player to nearby night elven ruins in order to drive back the naga now infesting them.

===The Prophecy of Akida===
[[Cryptographer Aurren]] sends players out around Azuremyst Isle to learn the language of the Furbolg, which has been inscribed on totems scattered across the island. After learning the language, players discover the Stillpine Furbolg reeling from recent calamities, including wars with the [[Bristlelimb]] Furbolg and an invasion by the Wildkin of the island. However a prophecy, the prophecy of Akida, speaks of one who is not a Furbolg who will deliver them. Players take on this role as they rescue prisoners from the Bristlelimb and work with the Stillpine warriors to retake [[Stillpine Hold]] from the Wildkin.
