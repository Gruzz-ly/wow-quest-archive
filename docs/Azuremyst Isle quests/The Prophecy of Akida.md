This is the final part of the [[quest chain]] '''{{questchain|The Prophecy of Akida}}'''.

==Objectives==
Free 8 Stillpine Captives from cages found in [[Bristlelimb Village]]. Return to [[Arugoo of the Stillpine]] at [[Azure Watch]] when you have completed this task.
* [[Stillpine Captive]] Freed (8)

==Description==
The images on this totem depict a war between the Stillpine and the Bristlelimb furbolg tribes. The etchings show that the Bristlelimb have done unconscionable things to the furbolgs of Stillpine.

Amidst the chaos, a prophecy has begun to unfold: A hero will rise - not of furbolg blood - and save the Stillpine tribe.

Slay Bristlelimb furbolgs at Bristlelimb Village for their keys. Use the keys to free the Stillpine captives. Return to [[Arugoo of the Stillpine]] when you have freed them all!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Choice of:|Stillpine Defender (item)|Stillpine Stinger|Arugoo's Crossbow of Destruction}}

* 1250 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
[Furbolg] So the prophecy of Akida is true... A hero has been delivered to us.

==Completion==
[Furbolg] The prophecy spoke of one that would rise and deliver us from the oppressive grasp of Bristlelimb -- that the spirits themselves would herald the arrival of this hero.

And now, you have come.

I humble myself before you, great one.

==Notes==
The keys are stackable, and are put on your [[Keyring]].  About every other Bristlelimb Furbolg has one, and they are only good for one cage each. (As usual for quests of this type, everyone in the group gets credit for each captive freed.)
