This quest is part of the '''The Prophecy of Velen''' quest chain.  This quest chain starts with [[The Prophecy of Velen]].

==Objectives==
Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing on Azuremyst Isle wants you to bring him a Hollowed Out Tree and 5 Piles of Leaves.
*[[Hollowed Out Tree (Azuremyst)]]
*[[Pile of Leaves]] (5)

==Description==
I've wondered about this for some time now, but this proves it to be true.

There is a traitor among us.

The plans left behind by the goblins document the conspiracy. Since I don't know who it could be, I'm going to need your help in finding the traitor. None of my crew can be trusted.

If this is going to work, I'm going to need a hollowed out tree and leaves. Search near the loggers north of us for the tree. You'll need to find the leaves by yourself. Check the forest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*200 [[XP]] (or {{cost||1|20}} at level 70)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
I love it when a plan comes together...

==Completion==
I must warn you, what I ask of you next will be dangerous. I won't think less of you if you decide not to help me out, <name>.

==Notes==
The progress sentence "I love it when a plan comes together..." is a reference to the favorite catch phrase of fictional character John 'Hannibal' Smith from The A-Team.
