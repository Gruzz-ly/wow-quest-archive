'''Bandits!''' starts when the player activates the item 'Blood Elf Communication' which [[drop]]s, surprisingly enough, from [[Blood Elf Bandit]]s.

==Objectives==
Take the Blood Elf Communication to [[Exarch Menelaous]] at [[Azure Watch]].
* [[Blood Elf Communication]] (provided)

==Description==
This appears to be a bounty ledger. You cannot understand the [[blood elf]] [[Thalassian|language]] but you note that there is a picture depicting a dead [[draenei]], a smiling blood elf standing over the corpse, and a symbol of what you think is some sort of blood elf currency.

They've put a hit out on draenei! You must inform the exarch.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Battle Worn Gauntlets
|Battle Worn Gloves
|Battle Worn Handguards
|Battle Worn Grips
}}

You will also receive:
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Yes?  I'm very busy, <name>.

==Completion==
By the beardless, geometric head of [[O'ros]]! It is good you brought this to me, <name>. These blood elves are out for... well, blood. [[Velen]] will be informed at once! Take this as a reward.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=[[Battle Worn Grips]] added as a reward.}}
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
