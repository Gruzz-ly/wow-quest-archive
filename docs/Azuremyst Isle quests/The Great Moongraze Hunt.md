'''The Great Moongraze Hunt''' is an [[Alliance]] quest in which a player proves themself a capable adventurer by hunting Moongraze, and also gets to learn a new [[recipe]] for the [[cooking]] skill.

==Objectives==
Bring 6 [[Moongraze Stag]] Tenderloins to [[Acteon]] at [[Azure Watch]].
*[[Moongraze Stag Tenderloin]] (6)

==Description==
You're starting to make a name for yourself, <name>. How about trying your hand at hunting?

Back on [[Draenor]], our greatest hunters would hunt a beast that resembled the moongraze stag of this region known as a [[talbuk]].

If you think yourself draenei enough, go out into the wilds and kill enough stags to fill your pack with meat.

You will find them grazing south of Azure Watch. Watch out for their horns!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||40}}
* 150 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
The stag hides are frail which tend to make for tender, succulent flesh.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>, well done!

Here, I cooked up some tenderloins while you were gone. Maybe you'd like the recipe, too?

==Notes==
The Moongraze Stags and Bucks that drop the Moongraze Stag Tenderloins can be found to the south of Azure Watch.
