==Objectives==
Escort [[Magwin]] through the island to her home.
*Magwin Escorted to Safety

==Description==
My family was attacked by the [[murloc]]s and [[owlkin]] of [[Silvermyst Isle|this island]] several weeks ago. I managed to escape but I think that both [[Thalrisa|my mother]] and [[Cowlen|father]] have been slain. I don't know what I'm going to do now, but I must try and get back to my home - or what's left of it... Will you help me get through the forest?

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:|Cowlen's Bracers of Kinship}}

You will also receive:
*850 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|10}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnssus]]
*150 reputation with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Hail, <name>.

==Completion==
<Tears of joy stream down Cowlen's face.>

How can I ever repay you for this, <name>? Please, take this heirloom. It symbolizes a sacred bond of friendship, trust and love amongst night elves. You are a <brother/sister> to me - from this day until the end of time...
