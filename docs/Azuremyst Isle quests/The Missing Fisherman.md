== Objectives ==
Find [[Cowlen]] at the southeast docks of [[Silvermyst Isle]] off the coast of [[Azuremyst Isle|Azuremyst]].

== Description ==
In the fevered dreams of [[Injured Night Elf Priestess|our injured guest]], she spoke of a fisherman, [[Cowlen]], who was in some distress at Silvermyst Isle, to the southwest, off the coast of Azuremyst.

With all that has been happening, no one has had the opportunity to look into it, but I do feel a bit of worry. Perhaps there's something you can do, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*420 [[XP]] (or {{cost||2|40}} at level 70)

== Completion ==
My family... What have I done... What could I have done?

Why must I be punished so?

== Notes ==
It is more efficient to complete this quest alongside [[Tree's Company]], which also takes place on Silvermyst Isle.
