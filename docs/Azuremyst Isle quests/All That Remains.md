==Objectives==
Cowlen on [[Azuremyst Isle]] wants you to recover the Remains of Cowlen's Family.
*[[Remains of Cowlen's Family]]

==Description==
We had lived peacefully among the Owlbeasts of this island for many years. You can imagine my surprise when they stormed the beach and attacked us.

I fought tooth and nail but was easily overpowered. As I blacked out from the vicious blows that I had been dealt, I prayed that my family not suffer.

When I awoke, all was quiet. The sand was soaked red with blood - their blood. They were devoured whole.

I care not for vengeance, <name>. I only ask that their remains be returned to me for proper burial. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*850 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|10}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]
*150 reputation with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
My wife was named Thalrisa and my daughter, [[Magwin]].

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Their spirits will be at peace now.
