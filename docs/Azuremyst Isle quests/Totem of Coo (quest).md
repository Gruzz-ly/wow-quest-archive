This is part of the [[quest chain]] '''{{Questchain|The Prophecy of Akida}}'''.

==Objectives==
Find the [[Totem of Coo]] using the clues provided to you.

==Description==
You begin to read the totem, barely able to pronounce the awkward words and phrases. Slowly, words start to form in your head. You think that the totem is telling you to go up the nearby hill, to the northeast.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The totem has various primal markings. You see owls, bears, wolves and stags carved into the surface of the totem.

You note a strange collection of symbols that makes your mouth form the word C-O-O.

==Notes==
When this quest is accepted, a ghostly furbolg will appear and guide you to the [[Totem of Coo]]:
:''Stillpine Ancestor Akida appears.''
:{{Text|emote|Stillpine Ancestor Akida urges you to follow him.}}
:''Stillpine Ancestor Akida leads you south and east, up a rise to the top of a bluff, where the Totem of Coo can be found.''
:{{Text|emote|Stillpine Ancestor Akida points to the totem of Coo.}}

The Coo totem is on the hill northeast of [[Azure Watch]] at {{Co|55|41|Azuremyst Isle}}.
