'''Travel to Azure Watch''' is an [[Alliance]]-only quest from the [[draenei]] starting region [[Ammen Vale]]. It is the final quest starting in that region, and introduces new [[draenei]] to the larger part of the island by sending them on to the first real town, [[Azure Watch]], outside the vale. Note that you will have to have completed most of the quests in [[Ammen Vale]] in order to get this one.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Technician Dyvuun]] at [[Azure Watch]] on [[Azuremyst Isle]].

==Description==
By all that is good, <name>, you must go at once to this Azure Watch and speak with Dyvuun!

There is a path that leads west off of this tiny isle. Follow it and cross the [[Crystalbrook River]] to arrive on the larger part of the isle. Continue to follow the path and you should find Azure Watch.

See if you can convince them to send us some aid and supplies. The rest of us will follow when we can.

Thank you, we wouldn't have made it without you!

==Completion==
Ah, good to see you again! I'm glad that we were both able to get our emitters fixed or we might have never found one another. And don't worry, we'll see to it that [[Ammen Vale]] gets help and supplies.

Speaking of assistance, now that you're here, go around and introduce yourself to the others. I know that there's plenty to do.

==Notes==
After talking to [[Technician Zhanaa]] to complete [[The Emitter]], a small event will play out. Once it is over, Zhanaa will offer this quest.

[[Azure Watch]] is the next quest hub for the [[draenei]]. It is right down the road to the west, follow the road through the mountains and over a river - you can pick up some quests on the way. Once you get to Azure Watch, talk to [[Technician Dyvuun]] to turn in the quest.
