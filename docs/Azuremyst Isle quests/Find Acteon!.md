'''Find Acteon!''' is an [[Alliance]]-only quest in the [[draenei]] starting zone [[Azuremyst Isle]]. Players must deliver a crate of fish collected in the previous quest to the next town, [[Azure Watch]].

== Objectives ==
Deliver the Crate of Red Snapper to [[Acteon]] at [[Azure Watch]].
* [[Crate of Red Snapper]] (Provided)

== Description ==
You did a wonderful job, <name>. Our people will be thankful for this bounty. With that said, would you mind taking this haul of red snapper to Acteon at Azure Watch?

He shouldn't be hard to find as he is awaiting this catch.

== Progress ==
What do you think of my armor?  Crafted it myself!  It's a little different than what we'd traditionally wear but extremely comfortable.

== Completion ==
Poor [[Diktynna]]... That [[murloc]] gave her quite a scare.

<Acteon sighs.>

Hopefully she will recover from the injuries soon...

So I presume you're looking for work. Well there's plenty of that to be found at Azure Watch!

== Notes ==
After turning in [[Red Snapper - Very Tasty!]] to Diktynna, she will offer this quest.

Continue west along the road until you arrive at Azure Watch. Talk to Acteon there to complete the quest.
