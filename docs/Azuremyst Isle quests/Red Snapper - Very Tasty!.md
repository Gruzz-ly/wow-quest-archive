'''Red Snapper - Very Tasty!''' is a side quest that begins at [[Ammen Ford]] in [[Azuremyst Isle]].

== Objectives ==
Use the Draenei Fishing Net to catch 10 Red Snappers. Return both the fish and the net to [[Diktynna]] on [[Azuremyst Isle]] when the task is complete.
*[[Red Snapper]] (10)
*[[Draenei Fishing Net]] (Provided)

== Description ==
I've found that these waters are bustling with red snapper, a very tasty fish. With a fishing net, I can catch enough to feed dozens of [[draenei]]! Unfortunately, I was recently attacked by a creature known as a [[murloc]] while netting in the river and have suffered some injuries that prevent me from doing my job. I need help!

Use this fishing net near schools of red snapper, found in the [[Crystalbrook River|Crystalbrook river]] to the east, to catch the fish.

What do you say? Remember to return the net when you are finished.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*200 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with the [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]
*[[Fishing Pole]]
*[[Shiny Bauble]]

==Progress==
Watch out for murlocs: Strange and extremely annoying little creatures.

==Completion==
I hope the murlocs didn't cause too much trouble, <name>. I owe you a great debt of gratitude for all that you've done.

Perhaps I could teach you how to fish? I'll even supply the fishing pole and a bauble.

==Notes and trivia==
*Use the [[Draenei Fishing Net]] on the [[School of Red Snapper|Schools of Red Snapper]] in the nearby river. This will either catch a [[Red Snapper]] or attract an [[Angry Murloc]], which will drop a Red Snapper when killed.
*This quest's name is likely a reference to the 1989 comedy film ''{{wp|UHF (film)|UHF}}''. As part of a game show called "Wheel of Fish," a contestant spins a red snapper on her first try, leading the host to declare, "A red snapper! Mmm, very tasty!"
**It may also be a reference to the [[Oxhorn]] video "[http://youtube.com/watch?v=71sVv__DryA Red Snappah!]," in which a character quotes the scene from ''UHF''.
