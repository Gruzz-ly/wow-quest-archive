This is part of the [[quest chain]] '''{{Questchain|The Prophecy of Akida}}'''.

==Objectives==
Find the [[Totem of Tikti]] using the clues provided to you.

==Description==
You begin to read the totem, better able to pronounce the words and phrases. Words start to form in your head. You think that the totem is telling you to go across the [[Crystalbrook River]] to the East. Perhaps your destination is on the other side of the river.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The totem has various primal markings. You see owls, bears, wolves and stags carved into the surface of the totem.

You note a strange collection of symbols that makes your mouth form the word T-I-K-T-I.

==Notes==
Upon accepting this quest for the first time, Stillpine Ancestor Coo appears and walk to the edge of the cliff:
:{{Text|emote|Stillpine Ancestor Coo motions for you to follow him.}}
:{{Text|say|Stillpine Ancestor Coo|[Furbolg] Ritk kin'chikx azul azure summit...}}
:{{Text|say|Stillpine Ancestor Coo|[Furbolg] Coo xip fly... Jump ilos river. Find Tikti.}}
:{{Text|emote|Stillpine Ancestor Coo points across the river.}}

After a moment, Coo casts a form of slow fall upon you (if you are there). Leap out, float out and down, and cross the river. The Tikti totem will appear marked on your mini-map.

The Tikti totem is on the far side of the river from the Coo totem, almost due east at {{Co|64|39|Azuremyst Isle}}.

If you drop then retake this quest, the ghostly furbolg does not appear again.

Jumping off the cliff and landing with the slow fall buff will earn you the achievement [[Going Down?]].
