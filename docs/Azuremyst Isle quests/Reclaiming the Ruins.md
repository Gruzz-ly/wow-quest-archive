== Objectives ==
[[Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare]] at [[Odesyus' Landing]] on [[Azuremyst Isle]] wants you to kill 5 Wrathscale Myrmidons, 5 Wrathscale Naga and 5 Wrathscale Sirens. 
*[[Wrathscale Myrmidon]] slain (5)
*[[Wrathscale Naga]] slain (5)
*[[Wrathscale Siren]] slain (5)

== Description ==
While some may look at our current predicament as an unfortunate turn of events, I sense that we are here for a reason. The invisible hand of fate has pushed us in this direction. The reason why will become evident in time.

To the west lies an ancient [[night elf]] city, now in ruin and overrun with naga. It would be remiss of me to sit idly by as the naga tainted my ancestral lands.

You have shown yourself a capable <class>. Honor my people and cleanse the ruins of their unwelcome inhabitants.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*700 [[XP]] (or {{cost||4|20}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]
*+150 reputation with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

== Progress ==
You do a good thing for my people, <name>.

== Completion ==
[[Elune]] be praised! The restless spirits may find tranquility after all. 

==Progression==
{{Prophecy of Velen}}
