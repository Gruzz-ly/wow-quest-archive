'''Stillpine Hold''' is a quest chain centered around the furbolg of [[Stillpine Hold]]. The chain starts in [[Azure Watch]], on [[Azuremyst Isle]].

{{questchain|The Prophecy of Akida}}
is a prerequisite for this quest chain.

==Stillpine Hold==
*'''[[Stillpine Hold]]'''
[[Arugoo of the Stillpine]], at [[Azure Watch]] on [[Azuremyst Isle]]
asks you to talk to [[High Chief Stillpine]], at [[Stillpine Hold]].

At Stillpine Hold, the High Chief tells you that their shaman, [[Kurz the Revelator]], had started seeing bad omens some months back. He also saw a "hero not of Stillpine blood" arising.  That hero, he says, is you.

*'''[[Search Stillpine Hold]]'''
''Note: you may need to complete [[Beasts of the Apocalypse!]], [[Murlocs... Why Here? Why Now?]], and/or [[Gurf's Dignity]] to gain this quest.  It is also possible that an unnoticed cut scene delays access to this quest.''

The High Chief does not know why the wildkin turned on them, and asks that you take a look into the matter by looking through Stillpine Hold itself.

You look through the hold, and find a huge red crystal embedded in the floor of a lake at the back of the hold.

*'''[[Blood Crystals]]'''
The crystal appears to be a fragment of the [[Exodar]], but it has been altered, and not for the better.  From all appearances, it is dissolving into the water.

You return to the High Chief with your report.  The Chief finds this worrisome, as his scouts have reported many more of these blood red crystals to the north.  ''(on [[Bloodmyst Isle]], presumably).''

*'''[[The Kurken is Lurkin']]'''
[[Kurz the Revelator]] tells you about The Kurken, who you spotted while scouting out the crystal earlier.  The [[wildkin]] brought this beast into the caves after the crystal storm had passed.  Many of the Stillpine fought this beast, but none succeeded in slaying it.  The Revelator has had a vision of who will defeat it:  you.

It's not a small task, but you prove up to it, and you return with the Kurken's hide to prove it.

*'''[[Warn Your People]]'''
The Kurken is slain, but the prophecy is not yet finished with you. There are still important tasks to finish. [[High Chief Stillpine]] asks you to warn [[Exarch Menelaous]] at [[Azure Watch]]. Those other crystals are likely to affect the rest of the land similarly, and the [[Draenei]] need to be aware of what they can do.

*'''[[The Kurken's Hide (quest)]]'''
Since you have this amazing hide, don't you think it should be put to use? [[Kurz the Revelator]] thinks so, and asks you to give it to [[Moordo]], the leatherworker for the Stillpine.

Moordo offers you a [[Kurken Hide Jerkin]] for your troubles. Or, if you prefer, a pair of [[Kurkenstoks]]. Comfort for your feet!

==Rewards==
Aside from the rewards mentioned for [[The Kurken's Hide]], you tally up
* +275 [[reputation]] with ''[[Exodar]]''
