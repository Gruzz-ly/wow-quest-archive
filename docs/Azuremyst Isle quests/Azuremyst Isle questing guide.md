# Azuremyst Isle questing guide

This is a questing guide detailing the best way to obtain and complete quests in [[Azuremyst Isle]].

For a list of all [[Azuremyst Isle]] quests in table format, see [[Azuremyst Isle quests]]

[[Image:Icon-warning-22x22.png|Note]] '''Note''': This guide is not meant for power-leveling purposes. Rather, it is meant to show a player the most efficient way to complete all quests available for a particular zone. If you know of a better order or method to accomplish this, your input is welcome (in fact, greatly desired). For major changes, feel free to edit, but make a note in the '''[[Talk:Azuremyst Isle questing guide|talk page]]''' as to your reasoning.

== {{Alliance_Icon}} Ammen Vale (LVL 1-5)==
[[Ammen Vale]] is the starting zone for new [[draenei]], and is located in eastern part of [[Azuremyst Isle]]. Other races may choose to quest here, but not all quests are available to them. If you are new to the game, check out the [[Newbie Guide]] to get started, or just dive in - the game has in-game hints and the opening quests are very straight-forward, just relax and have fun!

*Across the river in the area [[Ammen Ford]], you will see a draenei female named [[Diktynna]]. Talk to her to get the quest [[Red Snapper - Very Tasty!]]
*Use the net she gives you to catch red snapper - you need to swim out right next to the schools of fish (sparkly circles in the river) to use the net. Careful, sometimes using it causes murlocs to spawn.
*Return to [[Diktynna]] once you have all the fish and complete the quest. She will give you a fishing pole, and the next quest: [[Find Acteon!]]
*You can learn fishing here if you have enough money, it costs {{Cost||1|}}.
*When you are ready, head on along the road west to [[Azure Watch]].
*In [[Azure Watch]], complete your quests by talking to [[Acteon]], [[Technician Dyvuun]], and [[Caregiver Chellan]].

**[[The Great Moongraze Hunt]] from {{NPC|icon=Draenei Male|Alliance|Acteon|Hunter Trainer}}
**[[Medicinal Purpose]] from {{NPC|icon=Draenei Female|Alliance|Anchorite Fateema|First Aid Trainer}}
*Before heading out, make [[Azure Watch]] your home by talking to [[Caregiver Chellan]] in the inn. You should also find your class trainer (talk to the guards if you can't find the trainer) and catch up on your skill training.
*You can also learn many professions here:
**[[First Aid]]
**[[Mining]]
**[[Engineering]]

**[[Root Trapper]]s for {{loot|Common|Root Trapper Vine}}
**[[Infected Nightstalker Runt]]s for {{loot|Common|Faintly Glowing Crystal}}, which begins the quest [[Strange Findings]]

**[[A Small Start]] from {{NPC|icon=Human Male|Alliance|Admiral Odesyus|Alliance Naval Command}} ('''BEWARE''': If you're a completist, know that this quest has a breadcrumb called [[The Prophecy of Velen]]: if you get and complete [[A Small Start]] ''before'' getting and completing [[The Prophecy of Velen]], you'll lose the chance to do the latter forever. To get the breadcrumb quest you have to perform these steps: 1) In Azure Watch, pick up and complete [[Medicinal Purpose]] from {{NPC|icon=Draenei Female|Alliance|Anchorite Fateema|First Aid Trainer}} then turn it in; 2) watch the quick rp scene; 3) pick up [[An Alternative Alternative]] from {{NPC|icon=Draenei Male|Alliance|Daedal|Journeyman Alchemist}}, complete it in the zone around Azure Watch and turn it in; 4) watch the second rp scene; 5) at this point, {{NPC|icon=Draenei Male|Alliance|Daedal|Journeyman Alchemist}} will give you [[The Prophecy of Velen]], and only ''now'' you can safely head south to pick up [[A Small Start]] without losing anything).
**[[Cookie's Jumbo Gumbo (quest)]] from {{NPC|icon=Human Male|Alliance|"Cookie" McWeaksauce|Cooking Trainer and Supplies}}
*If you like, you can also get the following professions here:
**[[Cooking]] here from [["Cookie" McWeaksauce]]
**[[Blacksmithing]] from [[Blacksmith Calypso]]
**[[Tailoring]] from [[Erin Kelly]].
*When you are ready, head down to the beach and start killing any [[Skittering Crawler]]s you see for their {{loot|Common|Skittering Crawler Meat}}. You can find a lot of them in the shallow water.
*Make your way east along the beach, killing crawlers as you go. When you come to an area with [[Venture Co.]] goblins wandering around, look for the nautical compass and nautical map. Once you get them, head back west to safer beaches and continue to kill crabs.
*When you have all the meats, return to Cookie and the Admiral and turn in the quests. Three new quests will now be offered by nearby NPCs, get all of them:

*Head back to [[Azure Watch]] along the road north, gathering any items still needed for the quests there. Also grab a hollowed out tree and any leaves you find for the [[I've Got a Plant]] quest. The [[Root Trapper]]s can be a little hard to find, and the drop rate isn't too good either. The field south-west of [[Azure Watch]] seems to be a good place. If you haven't found an [[Infected Nightstalker Runt]], try searching north of town.
*Once you have everything, enter the town and turn in the quests.

*Head north and kill any bucks and nightstalkers you see. Remember to pick up piles of leaves if you haven't got 5 already. Also keep your eyes open for azure snapdragons, they grow at the base of trees just north of town.
*Once you have completed these quests, return to [[Azure Watch]]. If you are not level 8 yet, kill a few monsters until you level up.
*Turn in your quests at [[Azure Watch]]. Some new quests should now be available:
**[[The Missing Fisherman]] from {{NPC|icon=Draenei Female|Alliance|Dulvi|Mining Trainer}}
**[[Learning the Language]] from {{NPC|icon=Draenei Male|Alliance|Cryptographer Aurren}}

*Use the book you got from [[Learning the Language]] to complete the first step in this chain. Then talk to the [[Totem of Akida]] in [[Azure Watch]].
*Follow the guide from the totem north to the [[Totem of Coo]] on the top of the cliff - talk to it to receive the next quest.
*Wait for the guide to give you wings, then jump off the cliff in the direction he indicates (east) towards the river. The [[Totem of Tikti]] is on the east bank of the river. Talk to this totem to receive the next quest.
*After the guide gives you a buff improving your swim speed and giving you underwater breathing, swim down the river ahead of him, watching the river bottom until you see the [[Totem of Yor]]. Talk to it to receive the next quest.
*DO NOT leave without the guide. He will turn you and himself into panthers, giving you incredibly fast movement and stealth. Run with him as the next totem is rather far away. It is to the west at the [[Bristlelimb Village]]. Again talk to it to receive the next quest, [[The Prophecy of Akida]].
*You now can speak and understand the language of the [[Furbolg]]s, which you will need for future questing on [[Azuremyst Isle]]. Complete [[The Prophecy of Akida]] before you leave the [[Bristlelimb Village]], killing the Bristlelimb Furbolgs and getting their keys, then right-clicking the cages to free the trapped Stillpine Furbolgs.
*Once you have freed 8 of them, head back north-west to [[Azure Watch]] and talk to the furbolg there to complete the quest.

| {{NPC|icon=NightElf Female|Alliance|Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare}}

*After turning in quests, restocking, and training any necessary skills at [[Azure Watch]], head back south to the coast. If you haven't yet, pick up any needed quests at [[Odesyus' Landing]].
*Head west along the coast until you find [[Wrathscale Naga]], Myrmidon, or Sirens. The first kill should drop {{loot|Common|Rune Covered Tablet}}, which will start the quest [[Rune Covered Tablet (quest)]].
*Return to [[Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare]] at [[Odesyus' Landing]] and give her the tablet, then get the next quest: [[Warlord Sriss'tiz (quest)]].
*Head back to the beach with the [[Wrathscale Naga|Wrathscales]]. Don't worry about fighting them now, you will be fighting many more in the cave where [[Warlord Sriss'tiz]] is. Pick up any [[Ancient Relic (Azuremyst Isle)|Ancient Relics]] you see along the way; they look like little crystal balls.
*The cave you are looking for is called [[Tides' Hollow]], and it's to the northwest of [[Wrathscale Point]]. It should show up on your world map, so navigate by that.
*Once you enter the cave, head down as far as you can until you come to a pool of water with some ruins. [[Warlord Sriss'tiz]] should be here. You can usually get him by himself without any other naga interfering.
*When you have defeated him, return to the surface and kill any naga you have left for [[Reclaiming the Ruins]]. Also pick up any [[Ancient Relic (Azuremyst Isle)|Ancient Relics]] you still need for  [[Precious and Fragile Things Need Special Handling]].
*At this point, you may want to return to town to restock. However, if you feel up to continuing, the next area is very close by.

*[[Silvermyst Isle]] can be found south-west of the main [[Azuremyst Isle]]. The first place you will want to visit is the cove on the north-eastern shore called [[Traitor's Cove]]. You will see a flag on the beach. Stand near the flag and use your {{loot|Common|Tree Disguise Kit}}. Now just wait for the scene before you to play out.
*Now head south along the eastern beach. You will come to a dock of night-elf architecture. A male night elf is sitting at the end of the dock, talk to him to complete [[The Missing Fisherman]]. He should now give the quest [[All That Remains]].
*Head up to the night elf house west of the dock and kill owlbeasts until the {{loot|Common|Remains of Cowlen's Family}} drops. Return to [[Cowlen]] at the dock to turn in the quest.
*Now you need to go to the opposite side of the isle. Head through the center of the island and clear out owlbeasts as you go. When you reach the opposite shore, look for a female night elf named [[Magwin]] sitting near a big log. Talk to her to receive [[A Cry For Help]].
*Escort [[Magwin]] back through the center of the island. After [[Magwin]] and [[Cowlen]] have been reunited, speak with [[Cowlen]] to turn in the quest.
*Return to [[Odesyus' Landing]] to turn in [[Tree's Company]] and [[Precious and Fragile Things Need Special Handling]], [[Reclaiming the Ruins]], and [[Warlord Sriss'tiz (quest)]], if you haven't already. [[Admiral Odesyus]] will give the next quest, [[Show Gnomercy]].
*Head down tot he beach right near [[Odesyus' Landing]] and talk to the gnome there, then fight him. He will drop {{loot|Common|Traitor's Communication}}. Return to [[Admiral Odesyus]] - he will now give the quest [[Deliver Them From Evil...]].
*Go back to [[Azure Watch]] and turn in [[Deliver Them From Evil...]] to [[Exarch Menelaous]]. You are probably high enough level to get another quest from him: [[Coming of Age (quest)]], which is a pull quest into [[Bloodmyst Isle]].

*Head to [[Stillpine Hold]] and pick up all the available quests there, in addition to turning in [[Stillpine Hold (quest)]].
*To the east, kill the escaped ravagers to complete [[Beasts of the Apocalypse!]]. Shamans should also talk to [[Temper]] to get the next stage of their [[Call of Fire|Call of Fire]] quest.
*After turning in [[Beasts of the Apocalypse!]] at [[Stillpine Hold]], a few more quests should become available:
**[[Search Stillpine Hold]]
**[[Chieftain Oomooroo (quest)]]
*Head into the hold after making any necessary preparations. Inside, you will need to:
**Locate a blood crystal, the objective of [[Search Stillpine Hold]]
**Kill 9 [[Crazed Wildkin]]
**Kill [[Chieftain Oomooroo]]
**Shaman only: Find a [[Ritual Torch]] drop from [[Crazed Wildkin]]
*When you return to the Stillpine furbolgs, another quest ([[The Kurken is Lurkin']]) should become available. Head back into the hold to defeat [[The Kurken]].
*After turning in [[The Kurken is Lurkin']] and the next quest, [[The Kurken's Hide (quest)]], pick up the quest [[Warn Your People]] from the chief of the Stillpine.
*Shamans should now head back to the [[Emberglade]] and get the next quest in the [[Call of Fire|Call of Fire]] chain. You'll have to walk all the way to the other end of the island to get to [[Silvermyst Isle]], unfortunately. Once there, locate the wickerman effigy and burn it to summon [[Hauteur]]. Defeat him, collect his ashes, and use the [[Orb of Returning]] to teleport back to [[Emberglade]]. Turn in the quest with [[Temper]] and get the next in the chain.
*Next, travel to the northwestern coast and steal the {{loot|common|Stillpine Grain}} back from the [[murloc]]s there. You can either loot it from visible grain sacks or kill murlocs to get it from them. If {{loot|common|Gurf's Dignity}} drops from one of them, be sure to return it to [[Gurf]] back in [[Stillpine Hold]].
*Mages will encounter Quel'dorei Magewraith and need to kill it to complete their quest. This is a good time to practice mana management by having mana potions and your wand ready.
*Once you have all the grain, return to [[Stillpine Hold]] to turn in the quest.
*Finally, it's time to return to [[Azure Watch]] to turn in [[Warn Your People]]. Shamans can also get the next quest in their [[Call of Fire|Call of Fire]] quest chain at this time.

*Be sure you have [[Coming of Age (quest)]], obtainable in [[Azure Watch]].
*Shamans should have [[Call of Fire (Draenei, 6)]].
*Head along the road west from Azure Watch to the [[Exodar]], and turn in quests there.
*You will receive the next quest, [[Elekks Are Serious Business]], at this time. This quest is a pull into [[Bloodmyst Isle]], the next zone for the [[draenei]] area.

==Where to go from here==
The next logical step for most [[draenei]] is to move on to [[Bloodmyst Isle]]. However, [[Darkshore]] is also just a boat trip away and is the appropriate level for questing after Azuremyst. Other options include [[Loch Modan]] and [[Westfall]] in the [[Eastern Kingdoms]].
