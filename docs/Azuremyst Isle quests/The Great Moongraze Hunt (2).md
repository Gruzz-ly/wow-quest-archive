==Objectives==
Bring 6 Moongraze Buck Hides to [[Acteon]] at [[Azure Watch]].
* [[Moongraze Buck Hide]] (6)

==Description==
Well done, <name>! Well done!

Now that you've cut your teeth with the moongraze stag, it's time you graduated to more formidable prey. Do not allow the casual disinterest of the moongraze bucks to fool you: when provoked, they are a fearsome foe.

You'll find the bucks north of here. Good hunting.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Moongraze Fur Cloak
|Moongraze Hide Boots
|Moongraze Linked Boots
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||40}}
* 150 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
The buck hides are rugged and strong, making for very tough flesh - almost inedible, but we can use them for other purposes.

==Completion==
Wonderful! You're turning into quite the hunter, <name>.

How would you like to look more like me? Well here is your chance! While you were out hunting, I fashioned these items out of some buck hides I had laying around. Take your pick!
