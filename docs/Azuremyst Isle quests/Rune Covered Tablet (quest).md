''On completion:''
: ''Kyleen turns to Adamant.''
:{{text|say|Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare|Adamant, could you please take a look at this tablet and try to decipher the runes?}}
: ''Adamant turns around.''
:{{text|say|Archaeologist Adamant Ironheart|Of course!  Anything for you, darling!}}
: ''Adamant walks up to Kyleen.''
:{{text|say|Archaeologist Adamant Ironheart|Alright, let me take a look at that tablet.}}
:{{text|emote|Archaeologist Adamant Ironheart slowly reads the tablet, mouthing the words in their native tongue.}}
:{{text|say|Archaeologist Adamant Ironheart|[[Naga]] warlord!  Oh dear...}}
:{{text|say|Archaeologist Adamant Ironheart|Well, you aren't going to like what I have to tell you, young missy.  This tablet is a naga communication. Their leader, [[Warlord Sriss'tiz]], has ordered his naga to take the rest of the island by force.}}
:{{text|say|Archaeologist Adamant Ironheart|And it looks like he's got reinforcements comin' from [[Nazjatar]]!}}
:{{text|say|Archaeologist Adamant Ironheart|We've got to do something about this!}}
: ''Kyleen bows.''
:{{text|say|Priestes Kyleen Il'dinare|Thank you, Adamant.  I think I know just the person for the job.}}
