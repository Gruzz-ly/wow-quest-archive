== Objectives ==
[[Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare]] at [[Odesyus' Landing]] on [[Azuremyst Isle]] wants you to kill Warlord Sriss'tiz. 
*[[Warlord Sriss'tiz]] slain

==Description==
A [[naga]] invasion would be disastrous, <name>. I've seen what naga can do and I would not want to see such a catastrophe befall any being. If I were to guess, this Warlord Sriss'tiz will be hidden in a cave - probably along the coast to the west.

Find Warlord Sriss'tiz and put an end to his reign. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Battle Tested Blade
|Naga Plate Boots
|Battle Tested Dirk
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||1|65}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]
* +250 reputation with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Remain vigilant!

==Completion==
With Warlord Sriss'tiz dead, the possibility of a naga invasion is now only a distant memory. We are safe, for the time being...

I must admit, I was wrong to think badly of you, <name>. You have shown that you are nothing like [[Man'ari eredar|the filth]] that was [[Archimonde]]. Accept this as a gift from the [[Night elf|night elves]].
