==Objectives==
[[Moordo]] at [[Stillpine Hold]] on [[Azuremyst Isle]] wants you to bring him 8 Ravager Hides.
* [[Ravager Hide]] (8)

==Description==
My brother and I were hunting in the woods to the east when we were ambushed by strange, insect-like beasts. Such aberrations have never before been seen in Azuremyst! Could they be a sign of the coming apocalypse? The apocalypse that YOU are destined to prevent?

If you truly are the Promised One, you will strike the creatures of the apocalypse down... and bring me their hides. From their hides, I can fashion armor of great power!

Find them to the east, beyond the road.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Ravager Hide Leggings|Ravager Chitin Tunic|Thick Ravager Belt|Ravager Scale Pants}}

You will also receive:
*850 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|10}} at level 70)

==Progress==
They are ugly little creatures. Even the [[Magtor the Blind Watcher|Blind Watcher]] could see them... and he's blind. 

==Completion==
Not only is the [[prophecy]] true, this armor is also amazing! Surely it is armor fit for a [[Champion (rank)|champion]]! And I will sell it to you at discounted prices, furless one.

I jest... The first piece is complimentary.

==Progression==
{{Prophecy of Akida}}
