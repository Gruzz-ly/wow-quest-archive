==Objectives==
[[Archaeologist Adamant Ironheart]] at [[Odesyus' Landing]] on [[Azuremyst Isle]] wants you to bring him 8 Ancient Relics.
*[[Ancient Relic (Azuremyst Isle)]] (8)

==Description==
The priestess tells me that the ruins to the west are what's left of a [[night elf]] civilization. That got me thinking about what my pappy used to always say about night elf ruins, "Sonny, whenever you see night elf ruins, night elf relics are sure to be close by."

Now what kind of a [[dwarf]] would I be if I didn't hire the first person I saw to go digging up night elf relics for me? Now get going!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||2|25}}
*700 [[XP]] (or {{cost||4|20}} at level 70)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]
*+250 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Don't come back without some ancient relics.

==Completion==
My pappy would be proud! His boy strikes it big at the first set of night elf ruins he comes across... With your help, of course. Yes, don't worry, I won't leave you out of the discovery. Your name is <name>, right?  They'll learn all about you in [[Ironforge]].

==Trivia==
"Precious and fragile things need special handling" is the first line of lyrics in the Depeche Mode song "Precious."
