This quest is part of the {{Questchain|Stillpine Hold}} quest chain. You must complete {{questchain|The Prophecy of Akida}} quest chain for quests at [[Stillpine Hold]] to become available. 

This quest and several others in the area may only be available after completing several other quests:
* [[Beasts of the Apocalypse!]]
* [[Murlocs... Why Here? Why Now?]]
* [[Gurf's Dignity (quest)]]

The quest [[Chieftain Oomooroo]] also takes place in the cave, and is complementary to this quest.

==Objectives==
Search [[Stillpine Hold]] for clues.

==Description==
As High Chief, my immediate concern is the root of the corruption in [[Stillpine Hold]].

Why did the wildkin - once our allies - attack us? Why have they taken residence in Stillpine Hold?

Perhaps something inside will hold the answer. Search Stillpine Hold for clues as to the source of corruption.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*625 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The blood crystal radiates a sickly aura that seeps into the water of the cave.

==Notes==
The '''Blood Crystal''' is at the very back of the cave.  Take the left-hand route when the tunnel branches.  Coordinates are: 50,11

If you are also completing [[Chieftain Oomooroo]] at the same time, you may find it easier to take the right-hand branch, use the bridge to cross back over to the West side, kill the chief (and any additional needed wildkin), then drop down to the crystal from above.

Two wildkin spawn after you inspect the crystal (completing the quest).
