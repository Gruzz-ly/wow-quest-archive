==Objectives==
Speak with Stephanos to purchase a hippogryph ride back to Azure Watch. Once you have arrived, deliver Nurguni's Supplies to Caregiver Chellan.
*[[Nurguni's Supplies]] (provided)

==Description==
If I remember correctly, Azure Watch's hippogryph master is Zaldaan. If you've spoken to him before, then you can take one of my hippogryphs to him.

That's a good lesson to know: hippogryphs are always trained to fly to their capital city, but they'll only take you to a remote hippogryph master after you've already been there.

Since you arrived on one of Zaldaan's hippogryphs, you can also use that route to return to Azure Watch with the caregiver's supplies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|50|}}
*630 [[XP]]
*+250 rep with [[Exodar]]

==Progress==
Welcome back, <name>. Was Nurguni able to gather everything on the list?

==Completion==
<Handing over the box, you tell the caregive that Nurguni is making arrangements to have the larger items delivered by wagon.>

Splendid! Now, I'll finally be able to set up some beds and a first aid station so that we can better treat the wounded and any survivors we encounter.

I can't thank you enough for your help, <name>. You have my thanks and that of the Azure Watch's vindicators.
