This quest is part of the '''The Prophecy of Velen''' quest chain.  This quest chain starts with [[The Prophecy of Velen]]

==Objectives==
Deliver the Traitor's Communication to [[Exarch Menelaous]] at [[Azure Watch]].
*[[Traitor's Communication]] (provided)

==Description==
You must get this information to your people, <name>. While your brave acts have certainly slowed down the plans of [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|Kael'thas]] and his dark master, the attacks will undoubtedly continue.

Take the traitor's communication to your leaders. They must see this for themselves. Perhaps they will be able to better understand some of what was written.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*200 [[XP]] (or {{cost||1|20}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
You have returned!

==Completion==
<Exarch Menelaous takes the letter from you and begins to read it.>

Damn them... Damn them all to the Nether. They've had a spy watching everything that we've done! And for how long?

I will notify [[Velen]] at once!

You've done us a great service, <name>. Be on guard as I will be contacting you once the Prophet has given me instruction as to what to do.

==Progression==
