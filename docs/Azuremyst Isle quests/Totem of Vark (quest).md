This is part of the [[quest chain]] '''{{questchain|The Prophecy of Akida}}'''.

==Objectives==
Find the [[Totem of Vark]] using the clues provided to you.

==Description==
You no longer see unrecognizable symbology in the totems. The totem of Yor reads to you just as easily as your native tongue.

The markings identify another furbolg den, due west of here. You are able to expertly decipher the language on the totem and know that your destination is Bristlelimb Village. Yor will guide you but if you get lost, you know that you are able to take the ancient elven road in the forest leading west to reach your destination.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]

==Completion==
As you read the totem, your mouth forms the word V-A-R-K. You understand this to mean justice.

==Notes==
When this quest is '''first''' accepted, a ghostly furbolg will appear in druidic [[Aquatic Form]] and swim to the surface west of the totem, where it will shapeshift into a furbolg.  After a moment, it casts a spell upon itself and you (if you are nearby), which shapeshifts you into a ghost cat.

The buff greatly increases your land speed, and makes you invisible.

The guide then runs off to the northern part of [[Bristlelimb Village]], where you will find the Vark totem.  (As before, on your mini-map.)

* The ghostly furbolg will not appear (and thus not buff you) if you drop and reaccept this quest.
* If you are in combat at the time, you will not receive the buff.
* '''The buff is not necessary''' to completing this quest, but makes it a lot swifter and easier.  ...  and more fun.

'' As you accept this quest for the first time, Stillpine Ancestor Yor appears before you...''
