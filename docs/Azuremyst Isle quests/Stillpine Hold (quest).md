Yay!  You can speak Furbolg!  Now go talk to them up at Stillpine Hold. This quest starts you on the {{questchain|Stillpine Hold}} quest chain. 

== Objectives ==
Speak with [[High Chief Stillpine]] at [[Stillpine Hold]].

==Description==
Promised one, you must travel north to the home of my people - Stillpine Hold. It is there that you will face your most daunting challenge.

Go now, High Chief Stillpine awaits your arrival.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
* 210 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Completion==
For centuries, we lived in relative peace with the creatures of the land. Several months ago, [[Kurz the Revelator|Kurz]] began to see dark omens. The peace that we enjoyed for so long was to be lost. The extent of the catastrophe could not be known!

So it would be that the gods would shatter our land - turning both friend and foe against us. But there was something else... Amidst the chaos, a hero would rise: A hero not of Stillpine blood. The Promised One would deliver us from devastation.

That prophesied hero was you.

== Notes ==
Stillpine Hold is found due North of [[Azure Watch]], along the road leading North.

The high chief can be found at coordinates 46,20, just east of the cave entrance.
