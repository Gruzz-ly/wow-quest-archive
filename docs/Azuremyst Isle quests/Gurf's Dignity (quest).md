This quest is started with [[Gurf's Dignity]], a drop from [[Murgurgula]].

==Objectives==
Return Gurf's Dignity to [[Gurf]] at Stillpine Hold on [[Azuremyst Isle]].
* [[Gurf's Dignity]] (provided)

You recover the piece of fur that Gurf had "lost" in his struggle with the [[murloc]]s. Return the fur to Gurf and let him know that the fearsome [[Murgurgula]] has been slain.

==Progress==
Is that what I think it is?

==Completion==
<Gurf spits on the clump of fur and tries to affix it to the hairless patch on his backside.>

This will have to do for now! Hopefully one of the [[shaman]] will be able to repair the damage.
