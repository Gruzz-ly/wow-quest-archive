'''Word from Azure Watch''' is an [[Alliance]]-only quest on [[Azuremyst Isle]]. In this quest, players must get a message from the injured [[draenei]] [[Aeun]] at [[Ammen Ford]] to [[Caregiver Chellan]] at [[Azure Watch]].

== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Caregiver Chellan]] at [[Azure Watch]] on [[Azuremyst Isle]].

==Description==
<Class>! A couple mutated beasts jumped me and my leg is injured.

I was sent on a scouting mission from Azure Watch after we received word from [[Zhanaa]]. Please, could you go speak with Caregiver Chellan in my stead? She needs to know how many people to expect in Azure Watch. Just cross the [[Crystalbrook River]] here and continue following the road until you get to Azure Watch.

Be sure to ask her for [[Hearthstone|a place for yourself]] to stay in.

== Reward ==
{{itembox|You will receive your choice of these x5:|Brilliant Smallfish|Refreshing Spring Water}}

== Completion ==
Oh, you must be one of the survivors we've been hearing about!

I'm glad that you came. Don't worry, we will send someone to see to [[Aeun]]'s injured leg.

I'm most interested in hearing all about your harrowing story of survival. You're a brave one to have made it all the way here.
