This is part of the [[quest chain]] '''{{questchain|The Prophecy of Akida}}'''.

== Objectives ==
Find the [[Totem of Yor]] using the clues provided to you.

==Description==
The symbols on this totem seem to translate much faster. The patterns and imagery all seem to blend into familiar words. You are fairly certain the totem is pointing you south, down the river. Something is at the bottom of the river itself.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The totem has various primal markings. You see owls, bears, wolves and stags carved into the surface of the totem.

You note a strange collection of symbols that makes your mouth form the word Y-O-R.

==Notes==
Upon accepting this quest for the first time, Stillpine Ancestor Tikti appears and walks to the edge of the river:
:{{Text|emote|Stillpine Ancestor Tikti asks that you follow him.}}
:{{Text|say|Stillpine Ancestor Tikti|[Furbolg] Far you mixik tak come.  Gaze upon the kitch'kal river.  Follow.  Ilog to Yor.}}
:{{Text|say|Stillpine Ancestor Tikti|[Furbolg] Go... Search yitix'kil bottom river.  South!}}

After a moment, it casts a spell called Embrace of the Serpent upon you, which increases your swim speed, and provides water breathing for the duration.

Follow the river south. The Yor totem will be found at the bottom of the river, and will appear marked on your mini-map at {{co|63|68|Azuremyst Isle}}.

'''Warning:'''  swimming north will cause you to lose your buff.  Also, the ghostly furbolg will not appear (and thus not buff you) if you drop and reaccept this quest.
