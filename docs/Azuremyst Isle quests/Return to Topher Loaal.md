==Objectives==
Speak with [[Stephanos]] to purchase a hippogryph ride back to [[Blood Watch]]. Once you have arrived, deliver [[Nurguni's Supplies]] to [[Caregiver Topher Loaal]]. 
*[[Nurguni's Supplies]] (provided)

==Description==
If I remember correctly, Blood Watch's hippogryph master is [[Laando]]. If you've spoken to him before, then you can take one of my hippogryphs to him.
That's a good lesson to know: hippogryphs are always trained to fly to their capital city, but they'll only take you to a remote hippogryph master after you've already been there.

Since you arrived on one of Laando's hippogryphs, you can also use that route to return to [[Blood Watch]] with the caregiver's supplies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||7|}}
*850 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|10}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Welcome back, <name>;. Was [[Nurguni]] able to gather everything on the list?

==Completion==
<Handing Topher the box, you tell him that [[Nurguni]] is making arrangements to have the larger items delivered by wagon.>

Splendid! Now, I'll finally be able to set up some beds and a first aid station so that we can better treat the wounded and any survivors we encounter.

I can't thank you enough for your help, <name>. You have my thanks and that of the Blood Watch's vindicators.

==Progression==
{{Beds, Bandages, and Beyond}}
