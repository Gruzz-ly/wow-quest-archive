'''Medicinal Purpose''' is a [[Draenei]]-only quest in the [[draenei]] starting zone [[Azuremyst Isle]]. Players are sent to gather {{loot|Common|Root Trapper Vine|Root Trapper Vines}} from the [[lasher]]s around [[Azure Watch]], which will be used to revive an injured night elf priest currently at the draenei camp.

==Objectives==
[[Anchorite Fateema]] at [[Azure Watch]] wants you to bring her 8 Root Trapper Vines.
* [[Root Trapper Vine]] (8)

==Description==
I have found that [[lasher]]s milling about on the island hold restorative medicinal properties in their vines. Through proper treatment, the vines can be broken down into a powerful healing ointment. Unfortunately, with so many injured [[draenei]] passing through Azure Watch, we are always in short supply.

Our delicate guest was found injured and unconscious by the Crystalbrook only yesterday. If you bring me vines, we may be able to save her.

You will find root trappers both south and east of [[Azure Watch]].

==Rewards==
* 550 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar]]

==Progress==
I fear that her health is in steady decline.

==Completion==
Let us hope that this ointment will strengthen her spirit!

==Notes==
As stated in the quest text, the [[Root Trapper]]s can be found both to the south and the east of [[Azure Watch]]. The drop rate for the [[Root Trapper Vine]] is very bad, so expect to be at this a while. You may want to get the quest [[The Great Moongraze Hunt]] now as well, since the [[Moongraze Stag]]s are in the same area as the trappers.

:{{text|say|Anchorite Fateema|It appears that the ointment is ineffective.  Such a pity...}}
