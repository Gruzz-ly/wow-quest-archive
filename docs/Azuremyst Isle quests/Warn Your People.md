Omens.  Lots of Omens.  You've filled a prophecy, yes.  Did you ''really'' think that'd take care of absolutely everything?

This quest is part of the {{questchain|Stillpine Hold}} quest chain.

== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Exarch Menelaous]] at [[Azure Watch]].

==Description==
The Hold is saved and soon my people will make their way back to the ancestral home. The prophecy has come to pass and a new age of prosperity begins for the Stillpine.

But I fear that darkness looms ahead for your own people. There are questions left unanswered - visions of prophecy unseen.

Return to your leaders and tell them of what you have seen here.

And Promised One, should you ever require the aid of Stillpine, you have merely to ask.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]
*650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Visions you say? Interesting... And this prophecy has come to pass?

But you say they saw the power core of the Exodar? And [[O'ros]] was also in the vision? What can it mean?
