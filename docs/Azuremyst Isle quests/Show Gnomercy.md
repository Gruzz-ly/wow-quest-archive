This quest is part of the '''The Prophecy of Velen''' quest chain.  This quest chain starts with [[The Prophecy of Velen]].

== Objectives ==
[[Admiral Odesyus]] at [[Odesyus' Landing]] wants you to recover the Traitor's Communication from [[Engineer "Spark" Overgrind]].
* [[Traitor's Communication]]

== Description ==
Spark must be brought to justice!

I need you to go down to the beach and find that deceitful [[gnome]]. Once you find him, get whatever information you can out of him!

If a high ranking official of the [[Alliance]] has committed treasonous acts, who knows how many others are corrupt?

And <name>, use force if you have to... 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Crossbow of the Albatross
|McWeaksauce's Meat Tenderizer
|Seafarer's Blade
|The Discipline Stick
|The Shell Cracker}}

You will also receive:
*775 [[XP]] (or {{cost||4|80}} at level 70)
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

== Progress ==
Did you find the lying dog?

== Completion ==
Incredible! This was all part of their master plan!

This information must reach [[Varian Wrynn|the king]] and your own leaders. The implications are staggering.

==Notes==
Speak to Overgrind
:Can't you see that I'm busy?

:{{gossip|It's over, Spark.  The admiral knows it was you who betrayed the Alliance.  Now you're either going to cooperate with me and tell me everything that you know or we're going to engage in some fisticuff.}}

:{{text|say|Engineer "Spark" Overgrind|Does it frighten you to know that there are those would serve the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] with such devotion as to remain unwavering citizens of your pointless civilizations until called upon?}}
