This quest is part of the '''The Prophecy of Velen''' quest chain.  This quest chain starts with [[The Prophecy of Velen]].

==Objectives==
[[Admiral Odesyus]] at [[Odesyus' Landing]] on [[Azuremyst Isle]] wants you to observe the meeting that is to take place between Geezle and the traitor.

Return to him when you know the identity of the traitor.
*The Traitor Uncovered
*[[Tree Disguise Kit]] (provided)

==Description==
According to the plans, the traitor and the leader of the goblins, [[Geezle]], are to meet at a cove on the western island. I need you to be at that meeting, <name>.

Remember the tree and leaves? You're going to wear them! It's a perfect disguise.

Go to the cove and look for a naga flag. If the flag is there, it means a meeting is planned. Use the disguise kit when you see the flag and wait. Eventually the traitor will show up. Let the meeting finish then return to me with the identity of the scoundrel.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*600 [[XP]] (or {{cost||3|60}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]
*+500 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
That traitor is going to wish he never messed with [[Alliance Naval Command]]!

==Completion==
I can't believe it! It was the gnome all along... I should have known!

==Notes==
If you're at least level 8, pick up [[The Missing Fisherman]] back at [[Azure Watch]]. The target of that quest is on the way, also on Silvermyst Isle, and will save you some running.

If needed, you can ask Odesyus for another kit:
:{{Gossip|Admiral, I need another tree disguise kit.}}

''When the disguise is used in the proper location, Geezle and Engineer "Spark" Overgrind walk to [[Naga Flag|the flag]] from opposite ends of the beach...''

: {{text|say|Engineer "Spark" Overgrind|What's the big idea?  You nearly blew my cover, idiot!  I told you to put the compass and navigation maps somewhere safe - not out in the open for any fool to discover.}}
: {{text|say|Engineer "Spark" Overgrind|The Master has gone to great lengths to secure information about the whereabouts of the Exodar.  You could have blown the entire operation, including the cover of our spy on the inside.}}
: {{text|say|Geezle|Relax, Spark!  I have it all under control.  We'll strip mine the Exodar right out from under 'em - making both you and I very, very rich in the process.}}
: {{text|say|Engineer "Spark" Overgrind|Relax?  Do you know what Kael'thas does to those that fail him, Geezle?  Eternal suffering and pain... Do NOT screw this up, fool.}}
: {{text|say|Engineer "Spark" Overgrind|Our Bloodmyst scouts have located our contact. The fool, Velen, will soon leave himself open and defenseless -- long enough for us to strike! Now get out of my sight before I vaporize you...}}
: {{text|say|Geezle|Yes, sir.  It won't happen again...}}
