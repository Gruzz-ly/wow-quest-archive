'''Learning the Language''' is the start of the [[quest chain]] '''{{questchain|The Prophecy of Akida}}'''. In this series of quests, you learn the [[language]] of the [[Stillpine]] [[furbolg]]s and help them reclaim [[Stillpine Hold]]. You should complete the chain at least to [[The Prophecy of Akida]] to learn their language.

== Objectives ==
Read the Stillpine Furbolg Language Primer that [[Aurren]] gave you and interact with the [[Totem of Akida]] at [[Azure Watch]].
* [[Stillpine Furbolg Language Primer]] (provided)

== Description ==
I think I've cracked it, <name>!

<Aurren points to the totem.>

All that we need to know about the [[Stillpine]] [[furbolg]] [[language]] is imprinted on their [[totem]]s. With just a rudimentary understanding of how their symbols work, we can study the totems and learn to communicate with the furbolgs.

I've written down the basics of the symbol matrix on this parchment. Study it and then examine the totem. It should lead you to the next language totem.

Speak to [[Arugoo]] when you return an educated <race>!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 70 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
You can hear a low-pitched hum emanating from the totem.

== Completion ==
The totem has various primal markings. You see owls, bears, wolves and stags carved into the surface.

You note a strange collection of symbols that makes your mouth form the word A-K-I-D-A.

== Notes ==
The Akida totem is in the center of [[Azure Watch]], next to the cryptographer.

==Progression==
{{Prophecy of Akida}}
