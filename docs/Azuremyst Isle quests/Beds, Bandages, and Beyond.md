==Objectives==
Take Chellan's List to the hippogryph master [[Zaldaan]] at [[Azure Watch]]. 
*[[Chellan's List]] (provided)

==Description==
Welcome to [[Azure Watch]], <class>. Please excuse the disorder you see around you. It's easy to take simple things for granted, like a fully furnished and stocked inn, until you're forced to build one from nothing.

We've managed to salvage this pod for a building, but without the proper furnishings and first aid supplies, the inn is little more than a glorified tent. [[Nurguni]] at the [[Exodar]] has offered to put together a package to help with our most immediate needs, but I need someone to deliver this list to him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*420 [[XP]] (or {{cost||2|40}} at level 70)
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Good day, <name>. Are you interested in renting a [[hippogryph]]? 

==Completion==
So you need to go to the Exodar?

That's going to be a bit of a trip, but don't worry, I have a way to get you there very quickly. 

==Trivia==
*This quest chain used to be offered by [[Caregiver Topher Loaal]] in [[Blood Watch]].
*Bed, Bath, and Beyond is a popular American housewares chain.
