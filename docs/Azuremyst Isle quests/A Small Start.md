This quest is part of the '''The Prophecy of Velen''' quest chain.  This quest chain starts with [[The Prophecy of Velen]].

== Objectives ==
[[Admiral Odesyus]] at [[Odesyus' Landing]] wants you to recover the Nautical Compass and Nautical Map stolen by the [[Venture Co]].
*[[Nautical Compass]]
*[[Nautical Map]]

== Description ==
I am Admiral Odesyus of [[Alliance Naval Command]]. Our ship was forced to port on your island due to an infestation of sorts. It's embarrassing to even talk about, but [[goblin]]s somehow managed to stow away in the holds of both of my ships.

Last night, while most of the ship's crew was asleep below deck, they struck!

Stranger still, they took our navigation gear and jumped ship!

They disappeared into the thicket, east of here. Will you go in search of our gear? It will make for a strong gesture.

==Rewards==
You will gain:
*625 [[XP]] (or {{cost||3|90}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]
*75 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
Any luck, stranger?

== Completion ==
You're a resourceful one! With our navigation gear, we can figure out just how far we've veered off course.

But wait, what's this? There's something rolled up in the map. Let me see...

These are orders from [[Mogul Razdunk]] of the [[Venture Company]]. According to these plans, they're here to strip-mine the island of the crystal wreckage, then hijack our ships once they're finished.

By Bronzebeard's bushy brow! This is why they forced us to land? How could they know of our plans?

I smell a traitor...
