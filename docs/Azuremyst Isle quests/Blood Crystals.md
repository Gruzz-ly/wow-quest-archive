'''Blood Crystals''' is part of the {{questchain|Stillpine Hold}} quest chain.

== Objectives ==
Speak with [[High Chief Stillpine]] at [[Stillpine Hold]].

==Description==
On the surface, the crystal appears to be a piece of the [[Exodar]]. Something has gone terribly wrong with this crystal, however, as it is blood red and rapidly dissolving into the water supply of the cave.

This may explain the unusually aggressive behavior of the creatures in [[Azuremyst]]. Return to [[High Chief Stillpine]] with this information.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 625 [[XP]]
* {{cost||3|90}}

==Completion==
These blood crystals that you saw; my scouts have seen many more to the north.

I thank you for aid but now ask that you leave me to confer with the elders. I will call for you once I have spoken with the other elders of the village.
