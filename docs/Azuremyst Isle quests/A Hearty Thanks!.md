This quest is difficult to acquire, and is possible only for [[Draenei]] characters.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Exarch Menelaous]] at [[Azure Watch]]. 

==Description==
You saved my life, <name>! Thank you so much! That beast would have torn me to shreds if it weren't for you.

If you see the exarch at [[Azure Watch]], tell him of what you did. I'm sure he'll be pleased to hear such news! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||4|50}}
*525 [[XP]] (or {{cost||3|30}} at level 70)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Well done indeed! You are turning out to be a special draenei - a cut above the others of your age. Take this as a reward! 

==Notes==
To accomplish this quest:
* Find a Draenei Youngling. Going from spawn point to spawn point while spamming a /tar Draenei Youngling; macro might make finding them easier.
* Wait for them to engage in combat with an aggressive mob. The easiest way to force them to fight a hostile NPC is to drag one to them, without damaging it. They will eventually draw aggro from you and start taking damage.
* Wait for them to say “Help! I think this creature might be to tough for me to handle alone.”
* Use your Gift Of The Naaru racial ability to heal them, they should then say “Thanks for the heal, (name)!”
* Help them kill the creature they’re fighting.
* They should now offer the quest.

Some locations Draenei Younglings [http://www.wowhead.com/npc=17587 (map here)] have been found at:
