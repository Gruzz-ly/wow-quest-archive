'''Strange Findings''' is an [[Alliance]]-only quest in the [[draenei]] starting zone Azuremyst Isle. Players find a [[Faintly Glowing Crystal]] in the belly of an [[Infected Nightstalker Runt]] and must show it to [[Exarch Menelaous]] at [[Azure Watch]].

==Objectives==
Deliver the Faintly Glowing Crystal to [[Exarch Menelaous]] at [[Azure Watch]].
*[[Faintly Glowing Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
The crystal you found on the nightstalker runt's body appears to be a piece of the [[Exodar]]. This may help explain the unusual appearance and demeanor of some of the animals in this region.

Take the crystal back to Azure Watch. The exarch will surely want to know about this discovery.

==Progress==
You found what? Where?

==Completion==
How did such a thing end up in the stomach of a nightstalker? Could the debris from the crash have contaminated more beasts?

==Notes==
[[Exarch Menelaous]] can be found at the western edge of [[Azure Watch]], looking out over a cliff with a lake below. Just talk to him to turn in the quest.

==Progression==
* [[Strange Findings]]
** [[Nightstalker Clean Up, Isle 2...]]
