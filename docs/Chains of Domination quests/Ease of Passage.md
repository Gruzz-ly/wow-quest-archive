[[File:Ve'nari's Overstuffed Bag.jpg|thumb|Ve'nari's Overstuffed Bag]]

Speak with Ve'nari:
{{dialogue|It is preferable when an investment pay off.

{{gossip|quest=|I am ready.}}}}
:''Ve'nari reenters stealth.''
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|We have need of open space... but not too exposed to prying eyes.}}

Follow Ve'nari to the back of the [[Waystone to Oribos]], where she manifests a ghost [[Animaflow Teleporter]]:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|This will do. Now, Maw Walker, kindly activate the device with a touch of your anima.}}

Interact with it:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Ah, it worked! As I knew it would, of course.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Oh dear, I seem to have left my bag in that musty cave. Retrieve it for me and we shall depart.}}

Back in her cave, grab [[Ve'nari's Overstuffed Bag]]:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Hurry along now. We have much to discuss.}}
:''Ve'nari takes the animaflow teleporter.''

Follow her back to the refuge, using the flight path interface! At the refuge, Ve'nari is waiting:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|There you are! My bag isn't too heavy for you, is it? Come along then, we have much to do.}}

Speak with Ve'nari:
{{dialogue|Good, you're here.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|A very profitable effort, indeed.}}
