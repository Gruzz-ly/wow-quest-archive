==Objectives==
Collect 10 Tears of the Damned from [[Gorgoa: River of Souls|Gorgoa: The River of Souls]].
*Tears of the Damned collected (10)
*Bring the Tears of the Damned to Ve'nari's projection at the edge of Gorgoa.

==Description==
To anchor the instrument to the [[Maw]] and make it capable of the effect you seek, it must be imbued with the raw, unfiltered agony endured by the souls trapped in this cursed prison. 

Sorrow is abundant here, and therefore simple to obtain. You need only travel to Gorgoa. The damned shed copious tears that fall as crystalized grief as they are swept along the River of Souls.

Be careful that their sadness does not overwhelm you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
Have you collected the tears?

==Completion==
The magnitude of the grief you have collected will bind the instrument to the Maw.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Anger Management (quest)]] before heading out.

Tears of the Damned can be found on the ground in the river. While holding the tears, players will be debuffed with '''Grieving''' and use their <code>/cry</code> emote every 30 seconds or so:
:{{Abilities|Grieving|Struggling to hold back tears of inconsolable grief.|icon=spell_misc_emotionsad}} 

Turn in to the [[Ve'nari|Projection of Ve'nari]] at the north end of the river, near [[Odalrik]].

==Progression==
{{Focusing the Eye}}

==Patch changes==
