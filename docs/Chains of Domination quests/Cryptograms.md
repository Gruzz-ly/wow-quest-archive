==Objectives==
[[File:Infernal Cryptogram.jpg|thumb|An [[Infernal Cryptogram]]]]
Transcribe 10 Infernal Cryptograms.
*[[Infernal Cryptogram]] transcribed (10)
*[[Transcribed Infernal Cryptograms]] (provided)

==Description==
If the [[nathrezim]] have infiltrated [[Sinfall]] they will be communicating, and not just through hand gestures or spoken words. They like to use magical written messages concealed by a simple cantrip spell, invisible to the average observer.

However, I have developed an incantation that should allow you to see these messages.

Find these cryptograms and bring me their contents. I can translate them if they are beyond your understanding.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Translated Cryptograms]]
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
If the nathrezim have a flaw it is that they assume they are the only ones who get better over time.

==Completion==
This does not make sense. Their goals seem too wide spread. My assumption was that they had been planning to steal my medallion to deny us a new Sigil of the Venthyr, but it would appear their designs go beyond that.

What are they really up to? Here, you can have a translated copy.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The "Unwelcome" Guests]] before heading out.

Click on the blue runes in and around Sinfall on both levels.

==Progression==
{{The Unseen Guests}}
