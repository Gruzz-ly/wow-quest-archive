==Objectives==
Slay 15 [[Mawsworn]] in [[Scholar's Den]].
*Mawsworn slain (15)

==Description==
While opening [[Vault of Secrets]] the vault is our priority, I... I must ask a favor.

When [[Korthia]] was pulled into the [[Maw]], my people were terrified. We fled to the area you see before you, a place of peace called the Scholar's Den.

The Mawsworn soon descended upon us. Most were of my kind slaughtered, while others were taken captive.

If I could claim vengeance myself, I would. But I am ill-equipped for battle. Not like you.

I beg you, show these monsters that their defilement of Korthia will not stand!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
*+75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Every Mawsworn slain makes Korthia a safer place.

==Completion==
Vengeance will not bring back the fallen, but it gives those of us who survived a measure of satisfaction.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Knowledge Keepers]] and [[Let the Anima Flow]] before heading out.

Any mawsworn in the [[Scholar's Den]] and the [[Caverns of Contemplation]] counts.

==Progression==
