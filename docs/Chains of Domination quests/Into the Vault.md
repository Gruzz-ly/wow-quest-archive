[[File:Into the Vault - Primus.jpg|thumb|The Primus saving a message]]
The destruction here is... overwhelming.

<[[Tal-Galan]] quietly utters a prayer.>

[[Anima]] flows into what remains of the vault. We should now be able to enter.

Once inside, I will work on recovering the Primus's sigil. 

Please show reverence within the vault. It is a sacred place that few are allowed to see.

Even the prophecies did not foretell that a living mortal would gaze upon the secrets within.

You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Death's Advance]]

Are you prepared to behold the secrets of the [[Shadowlands]]?

The Primus's sigil! Hmm... I sense a familiar magic upon it.

Yes. All those things I saw through your eyes from Torghast...

==Notes==
[[File:Sigil of the Primus.jpg|thumb|Sigil of the Primus]]
Speak with Tal-Galan:
:We are close to seeing the secrets of Korthia.
:{{gossip|I am ready. Let's open the way.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|My friends! Let us begin the ritual.}}
:''The three attendants open a portal.''
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|The way is open! Come, Maw Walker.}}
:''Tal-Galan and Heirmir jump into the portal while Kah-Rev and the two keepers head the other way out of the building.''
:{{text|say|Protector Kah-Rev|We should go. This is no place to linger.}}

Jump in to the portal to enter the [[Chamber of the Sigil]]:
:''Tal-Galan floats off to the side to inspect piles of relics, while Heirmir stays in front of the main vault.''
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Even damaged, the vault is glorious, is it not?}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|There's no time for gawking! We must secure the sigil!}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|But surely I should recover a few of these treasures...}}
:''Heirmir walks up to the attendant.''
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Get this vault open NOW!}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Yes, of course. Sigil first. Other relics later.}}
:''Tal-Galan floats up to the vault and tinkers with it.''
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|The vault is opening!}}
:''[[Xalvez the Collector]] and the [[Remnants of Kalvez]] appear from behind and stun the Maw Walker, Tal-Galan, and Heirmir with {{Abilities|Collected|id=352799|icon=spell_animamaw_missile}}.''
:{{text|say|Xalvez the Collector|This prize belongs to the Jailer. We shall not fail our master!}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|The sigil belongs to the Primus!}}
:{{text|say|Xalvez the Collector|The Primus has fallen! His sigil will be claimed by the Banished One!}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|The Keeper of Secrets will not be subdued so easily!}}
:''Tal-Galan casts a spell that frees the group from the stun.''
:{{text|say|Xalvez the Collector|So be it. Let the slaughter begin!}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Take cover, keeper! This is our fight!}}

Take down one, but both must die before either will be defeated:
:{{text|yell|Xalvez the Collector|The bonds of shared torment empower us!}}

Take down the other:
:{{text|say|Xalvez the Collector|Is this... the end?}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|There is one last record here. It appears to be bound together with the sigil.}}
:''Another image of the Primus appears.''
:{{text|say|The Primus|...enough to keep it protected. Another safeguard is required.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|I will bind it with another form of magic. One that even Zovaal cannot--}}
:''The image disappears and the Sigil of the Primus appears in its place.''
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|That is all that remains of the message. Take the sigil, Maw Walker.}}

Interact with the Sigil of the Primus:
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|I don't recognize the magic bound with the sigil. Perhaps Highlord Fordragon will know of it.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|So much knowledge. We cannot leave it behind!}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|The sigil is more important. Get us out of here!}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Very well. I can open the way back to Keeper's Respite. I pray I can return one day...}}
:''He opens a portal, and he and Heirmir leave through it.''

Take [[Tal-Galan's Portal]] back to [[Keeper's Respite]] and turn in to Bolvar.
