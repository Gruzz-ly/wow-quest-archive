==Objectives==
Have [[Ve'nari]] scan the area, then investigate whatever is found.
*Ve'nari's scan completed
*Group of [[attendant]]s investigated {{co|58.6|20.9|Korthia}}
*[[Tal-Galan]] spoken to
*Speak with Tal-Galan near the Inert Waystone.

==Description==
We are on the threshold of attaining our desires, [[Maw Walker]].

Your grand waystone cannot be far off. Of course, my needs are much more modest. A bit of useful information here, a priceless relic there...

I will survey the area to see if there is anything useful--or hazardous--nearby. Then we can proceed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ve'nari]]

==Completion==
I must find out more about you, Maw Walker.

==Notes==

Speak with her:
:Who knows what secrets this place holds? There is only one way to find out...
:{{gossip|Scan the area to see what exactly might be nearby.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Hmm... now that is interesting.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|I detect attendants nearby, like those in [[Oribos]]. Perhaps they are the caretakers of Korthia's treasures.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|You go on ahead. I will linger here. To ensure no enemies have trailed us, of course.}}

Follow the path south to find [[Tal-Galan]] and four [[Korthian Protector]]s:
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Increase our patrols. We cannot let the Mawsworn reach--}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Another of [[the Jailer]]'s agents?! Strike them down!}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Hold! This is a living mortal--the Maw Walker! Not some servant of the Jailer!}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|A Maw Walker? Fascinating! I have studied the [[Prophecy|prophecies]], but...}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Oh, forgive me. I am Tal-Galan, Keeper of Secrets.}}

Speak with Tal-Galan:
:A Maw Walker... this is quite an interesting turn of events.
:Please, follow me.
:{{gossip|Lead the way, Tal-Galan.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Come. We have much to discuss.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|So this is Korthia. I expected something a bit more... grand.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|You should have seen it in its prime, broker. Korthia is... or was... the City of Secrets.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|My order was charged with safeguarding knowledge and artifacts. Things deemed too precious to risk falling into malicious hands.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Korthia was hidden deep within the [[In-Between]], safely out of reach... until the Jailer's chains found us.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|The Banished One seeks our most precious treasure... and is willing to destroy our entire existence to claim it.}}
