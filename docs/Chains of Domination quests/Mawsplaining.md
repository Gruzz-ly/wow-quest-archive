==Objectives==
Ask Ve'nari's help to bind the [[Ilskahorn]] to the [[Maw]].
*Jump in the Skyhold portal (Optional) {{co|59.0|25.3|Skyhold}}
*Ve'nari consulted {{co|46.9|41.8|Maw||1}}

==Description==
There remains one task now before the glorious battle can begin. The horn must be anchored to the Maw so that its voice may pierce the barrier that surrounds that foul realm. 

How this can be done, I do not know. Seek out one that understands the mysteries of that place. Surely they can guide your hand.

[[Danica the Reclaimer|Danica]] and her sisters will listen for Ilskahorn's call. They will answer when you need them, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
Have you bound the horn to the Maw?

==Completion==
[[File:Shadowlands press kit - Ve'nari.jpg|thumb|[[Ve'nari]]]]
That's quite an instrument you have there.

It seems the golden feathers were worth following, Maw Walker. You owe me yet again.

==Notes==
Though [[Odyn]] doesn't say anything, there's a portal back to the [[Maw]] at the north end of [[Skyhold]]. Much like in Oribos, jump down the hole to get back.

Check in with [[Ve'nari]]:
:Oh, you've returned. How fortuitous.
:{{gossip|How do I bind this horn to the Maw?}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|What an admirably specific question... the answer to which I can only hypothesize.}}

==Progression==
{{Focusing the Eye}}
