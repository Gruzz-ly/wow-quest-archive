'''Who is the Maw Walker?''' takes place mid-way through the second chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]]. After completing the trial, the Maw Walker's mounts will hear their call once again, allowing them to mount up.

==Objectives==
Participate in [[Tal-Galan]]'s [[Maw Walker]] trial.
*Tal-Galan's trial survived

==Description==
[[Korthia]]n [[Prophecy|prophecies]] foretell the arrival of a Maw Walker who can save us from disaster.

Perhaps this is that day. But perhaps not. I must test your anima to verify your claim.

If you speak the truth, then I have a solemn duty to empower your [[anima]] before we proceed.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
: {{abilities|[[The True Maw Walker]]|The power of the Maw Walker is fully awoken within you. Your mounts can now hear your call in the [[Maw]], and you can freely enter the [[Beastwarrens]] and [[Perdition Hold]].}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}

==Progress==
Let us proceed, Maw Walker.

==Completion==
Maw Walker. We must summon the others.

==Notes==
Speak with Tal-Galan:
:I am quite familiar with the prophecies. If you are the Maw Walker, I will see it.
:{{gossip|I'm prepared for your Maw Walker test.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Much of my knowledge is purely academic. I must explore your anima to learn more. Hold still.}}
:''Tal-Galan starts channeling Tal-Galan's Trial into the Maw Walker, which stuns them in mid-air, causes small bursts of anima to rapidly fly from them, and slowly drains their health.''
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Ah, yes... You have a connection to a [[Azeroth (titan)|unique world soul]], as it was foretold!}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|But has that prepared you for what is to come? We must find out.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Stop this ridiculous investigation... before you kill the only one who can help you!}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|The scrolls specified that the true Maw Walker must be empowered. It is my duty to proceed.}}
:''Ve'nari starts winding up an attack on Tal-Galan.''
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Release the Maw Walker at once, or suffer the consequences!}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|It is true... you are the Maw Walker! And now your anima is stronger than ever. We of Korthia are at your service.}}
