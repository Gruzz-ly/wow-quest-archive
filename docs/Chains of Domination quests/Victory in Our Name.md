'''Victory in Our Name''' concludes the fifth chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]], "An Army of Bone and Steel".  Necrolord Covenant players have a few additional follow-up quests, starting with [[Filling an Empty Throne]]. The sixth chapter of nine begins at [[:Renown]] 50 with [[Vashj|Baroness Vashj]] starting [[Dreadlords!]] behind the [[Waystone to Oribos (Korthia)|Waystone to Oribos]].

Completing this quest also unlocks the [[Containing the Helsworn]] weekly elite world quest in [[Desmotaeron]].

==Objectives==
Return to the [[Primus]] at [[Korthia]].
*Death Gate to Korthia taken (Optional)
*Speak with [[Draka]] at Korthia {{co|60.3|27.4|Korthia}}

==Description==
With [[Helya]] and [[Vyraz]] taken care of, we have achieved a major victory against the [[Mawsworn]] today. It is also a showing of what the combined might of the [[Shadowlands]] looks like.

We should return to Korthia before something else arises.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Emblem of Renown]]
* 2x [[Ziggurat Focusing Crystal]] (500 anima)
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
There is no doubt that we will need to put pressure on [[Desmotaeron]] once again.

The witch of the [[Val'kyr]] will not let us walk free if she can help it.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Well fought... Go'el. Come, we will speak.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|You... knew?}}

A Death Gate to Korthia appears and Draka and Thrall leave through it. Take it for a shortcut back. Find the two orcs at the Necrolord camp and speak with Draka:
:We have breached the Maw with an army and returned. This is a cornerstone moment for Maldraxxus.
:Your name will be remembered, Maw Walker. I look forward to the tales that will follow.
:{{gossip|<Give Draka a moment with Thrall.>}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|I knew who you were the moment I saw you. Do you really think I wouldn't recognize [[Durotan]]'s eyes?}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|You were but a babe when I died. Tell me, who have you grown to be?}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|I was once [[Warchief]] of the [[Horde]], a [[shaman]] of the [[Earthen Ring]]--}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|That is who you were. Who are you now?}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|I... am uncertain. Much has happened in my life. I do not know where it will lead next.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|A lesson, then. Not from mother to child, but from one similar soul to another. Remember who you were, but take pride in who you are.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|I once thought death was the end. But now, as a warrior of [[Maldraxxus]], I see that it was only the beginning.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|It brings me joy to see how far you have come. And I know you have much farther to go.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Thank you... mother. I will make you proud.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Come. I wish to know more of your life. All of it.}}

;On completion
:{{text|say|The Primus|Vyraz has answered for his treachery. The houses of [[Maldraxxus]] stand united once more.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|With a shared purpose before us, I will reforge the [[sigil]] of the [[Necrolord Covenant|necrolords]]. It shall be entrusted to Draka until I have need of it.}}
