'''New Sigil of the Kyrian''' breadcrumbs players back to the [[Primus]] in [[Korthia]] to conclude the "A New Path" chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]]. At [[:Renown]] 58, the final chapter begins with [[Doorway in the Dark]].

==Objectives==
Report back to the [[Primus]] in [[Korthia]].
*Leave the [[Seat of the Archon]]

==Description==
With a future of kinship and devotion secured for [[Bastion]], a new [[sigil]] is born to represent our path forward.

Please report all that you have done to the Primus. When he is ready, we will deliver the sigil to him. 

Let us hope he can use it to thwart [[the Jailer]]'s plan and save the [[Shadowlands]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
*[[Emblem of Renown]]

==Completion==
[[Kyrestia the Firstborne|Kyrestia]] was the first to be borne aloft by wings of duty and service.

That you have helped the Archon see a new path forward is a wondrous thing indeed, mortal.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Pelagos|Uther, pardon my asking but... what fate befell [[Arthas]] in the end?}}
:{{text|say|Uther|At the moment of his death, [[Devos]] and I claimed his soul... and cast it into the [[Maw]].}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|Without [[the Arbiter]]'s knowledge? So... he might yet have had a chance at redemption?}}
:{{text|say|Uther|I will never know. It was not my choice to make. Devos led me down a dark path.}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|Now that I have seen the Maw for myself... I cannot say that any soul deserves such torment.}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|Perhaps some can never be forgiven... but you have shown me that they must be treated with compassion.}}

Take the Anima Gateway to Oribos by the eastern group to exit the instance. This drops players off at {{co|37.8|34.0|Oribos|1}} by the portal to [[Korthia]] on the northwestern spot of the [[Ring of Transference]].

:{{text|say|The Primus|Kyrestia was ever the most unwavering of us all. The Archon's willingness to embrace a new path demonstrates her devotion to the kyrian.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|I have called upon the covenants to bear their sigils here to Korthia. The key to our victory lies within them... and in you, Maw Walker.}}
:''He turns back around to his regular position.''
