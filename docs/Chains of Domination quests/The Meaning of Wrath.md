'''The Meaning of Wrath''' breadcrumbs players back to [[Korthia]], ending the sixth chapter of nine in the [[Chains of Domination campaign]]. The seventh chapter begins at [[:Renown]] 52 with [[A Cry From the Heart]].

==Objectives==
Report to [[the Primus]].

==Description==
I will gather my forces and dispense a portion to [[Korthia]] immediately. I will also see to it that they are provided the tools [[Vashj|Baroness Vashj]] and [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|Kael'thas]] were able to conjure so that we might further defend against [[nathrezim]] incursions.

Other duties require my attention before I can descend on Korthia. I must secure [[Dominance Keep]] against further infiltrators.

I suppose the Primus will want an update. You may tell him you were successful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Emblem of Renown]]
*{{cost|12|87}}

==Completion==
Your strength in battle remains uncontested. Today, though, you prove your strength of diplomacy. 

I have already issued orders for the deployment of [[the Stonewright]]'s forces. Well done in bringing her into the fold.

==Notes==
What's a quest shortcut? Return to [[Oribos]] and take the portal to [[Korthia]]. On completion:
:{{Text|say|The Primus|Now that [[Renathal]] has reclaimed the medallions, the venthyr can forge a new [[sigil]] to replace the one [[Denathrius]] surrendered to [[Zovaal]].}}
:{{Text|say|The Primus|Yet you must remain vigilant, Maw Walker. The return of the nathrezim bodes ill for us all.}}

==Progression==
{{The Unseen Guests}}

==Patch changes==
