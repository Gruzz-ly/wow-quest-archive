==Objectives==
[[File:Spy vs Spy.jpg|thumb|A revealed [[Dreadlord Infiltrator]]]]
Track down and defeat 5 Dreadlord Infiltrators.
*[[Dreadlord Infiltrator]] slain (5)
*[[Orb of Revelation]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Nathrezim]]. Dreadlords. The Unseen Guests.

Call them what you will, they are a race that was crafted to be the greatest collection of spies and infiltrators in all of reality, once upon a time. 

Their intrusion has underestimated three things. [[Kael'thas Sunstrider]], [[Vashj|Baroness Vashj]], and <name>!

I have brought a tool Kael'thas and I used detect nathrezim when we served under [[Illidan]]. And I am the matron of spies!

Let us hunt these intruders down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Who says death is without its little pleasures.

==Completion==
The [[venthyr]] have grown complacent, unwilling to acknowledge the reality that nathrezim might return. The same blindness left them exposed to [[Denathrius]]' treachery. 

They will be far more vigilant now.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Use this to see through the nathrezim's disguises.<!--Here, I brought a tool we once used to spot nathrezim back in Outland.-->}}

Use the provided [[Orb of Revelation]] to gain a five-second [[Spectral Sight]]-type buff. Dreadlords will show their wings, and the minimap will also track them for the duration of the buff. Be careful when choosing targets, as aggroing the dreadlord will also aggro nearby units.

Dreadlords can say one of the following when they die:
*{{text|say|Dreadlord Infiltrator|All... according... to plan...}}
*{{text|say|Dreadlord Infiltrator|Pitiful... mortal... bravado...}}
*{{text|say|Dreadlord Infiltrator|So close... to home...}}
*{{text|say|Dreadlord Infiltrator|We... have already... won...}}
*{{text|say|Dreadlord Infiltrator|You... accomplish... nothing...}}
*{{text|say|Dreadlord Infiltrator|As... the Master... intended...}}
*{{text|say|Dreadlord Infiltrator|Darkness... embrace me...}}

Kael looks for some information from Vashj:
:{{text|say|Kael'thas Sunstrider|Illidan would have relished this. What fate do you suppose was chosen for him?}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|You assume he is both dead and mortal. I am not sure either is true.}}

Later:
:{{text|say|Kael'thas Sunstrider|To think I was once allied with these fiends...}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Is that a hint of remorse? How unlike you.}}

==Progression==
{{The Unseen Guests}}

==PTR version==
{{Rfptr-section}}
In early versions, Kael and Vashj had different banter:
:{{text|say|Kael'thas Sunstrider|I never imagined I would have to deal with nathrezim again.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|You were never the one I accredited with good foresight.}}

And:
:{{text|say|Kael'thas Sunstrider|Did you happen to hear which afterlife Illidan was sent to?}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|We think he may still be alive.}}
:{{text|say|Kael'thas Sunstrider|What? The betrayer still lives?!}}
