'''The Primus Returns''' concludes the "The Last Sigil" chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]], rewarding the [[Memories of Sunless Skies]], which unlocks flight in the four level-up zones of [[Shadowlands]]. Bolvar offers an immediate followup: [[Storming the Sanctum]], serving as a breadcrumb to the [[Sanctum of Domination]]. The storyline continues with [[The Chains of Command]] at [[:Renown]] 47.

==Objectives==
[[File:Runecarver image.jpg|thumb|The image of the [[Runecarver]] left by the Primus]]
Meet with the [[Primus]] within [[Keeper's Respite]] to form a new plan of attack.
*Return to Keeper's Respite

==Description==
[[The Jailer]] has four of the five sigils required for what he is planning.

He is a fool for allowing us to live. His desire to see us bend to his will shall be his undoing.

All is not lost, if you are willing to put in the work. There is still something that can be done.

Come. I will meet with the rest of your forces and formulate our next attack.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Memories of Sunless Skies]]
* [[Emblem of Renown]]
* 100x [[Soul Cinders]]
* {{cost|77|22}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Death's Advance]]

==Completion==
We can dwell on our past mistakes when this is over. For now, we must move forward.

You aided me during my imprisonment as the Runecarver. Take this as a token of my gratitude.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|The Primus|There are still those who need the skills of the Runecarver. I will leave an echo of what I was here to aid them.}}
:''The Primus summons an image of the [[Runecarver]] back in his usual spot.''
:{{text|say|The Primus|Broken. Chained. This is the fate Zovaal intends for all existence.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|Come. The covenants must be told of my return.}}
:''The Primus shrinks himself down small enough to fit through the portal back to the [[Torghast Antechamber]].''

[[File:The Primus Returns - at Keeper's Respite.jpg|thumb|The Primus... mid-sized?]]
No teleport is provided back to [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]], so head back using the [[Animaflow Teleporter]] from [[Ve'nari's Refuge]]. At the respite, Heirmir has set up shop atop a rock, and the Primus is having a meeting with Bolvar and [[Tal-Galan]]:
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|We are honored to have you among us, Primus. What is our course now that the Jailer has your sigil?}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|The mortals must face Zovaal in his sanctum. But as you know, a wise strategist always prepares contingencies.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|The covenants have grown stronger, but are not yet whole. Each must remember its purpose... and find its future.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|When this comes to pass, new sigils can be forged. They will be needed to pursue Zovaal, should our assault fail.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|Highlord, send word to your allies in Oribos. They must defend the Arbiter's sigil at all costs.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|Maw Walker, I will call for you when I am ready. May fortune favor us all.}}

The Primus then walks over to the edge of the cliff, where he remains standing permanently.

Alts of players who have already completed this quest will not receive a duplicate [[Memories of Sunless Skies]].
