==Objectives==
[[File:The Power of a Crown.jpg|thumb|The ritual in Sinfall]]
Track the path to the Medallion of Wrath.
*[[Sinfall]] searched {{co|25.4|45.1|Revendreth}}
*[[Medallion of Wrath]] located
*Speak with the Stonewright at the Dawnkeep.

==Description==
We are ready.

The [[Court of Harvesters]] shall use the power of the medallions we have gathered thus far to locate the Medallion of Wrath. So long as they have not removed it from the realm we should be able to divine its presence.

This is not an easy ritual--the [[nathrezim]] specialize in avoiding detection. When you see the path, take it and move with speed.

And when you find them, wait for us before you engage.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Completion==
I will not suffer my medallion in the hands of these unwelcome guests.

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Come, my fellow harvesters. Let us summon wrath to find wrath.}}
:''[[Prince Renathal]], [[the Stonewright]], [[the Countess]], [[The Curator (venthyr)|the Curator]], and [[the Accuser]] channel a spell into the central [[Sinstone of Revendreth]].''

Follow the constantly-spawning [[Unleashed Hatred]] manifestations through the mirror to the lower level, then straight down the path to the Gate of the Sinners and exit [[Sinfall]], where Kael'thas and Vashj despawn. The two dreadlord hunters await further up on the bridge. When you arrive, the Stonewright teleports in and Navrataal lands with a crash next to her.
:{{text|say|The Stonewright|My vengeance will not wait. We strike now.}}

Turn in to the Stonewright.
