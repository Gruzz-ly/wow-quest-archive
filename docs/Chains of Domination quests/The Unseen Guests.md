==Objectives==
Join [[the Stonewright]] as she investigates the Envoy.
*Investigate the Envoy

==Description==
[[Nathrezim|Dreadlords]].

Of course. Of course they would come back now of all times. I half suspected they returned during the drought. 

I was not entirely convinced you were not one, the first time I saw you. They have gotten more clever over the eons since they fled [[Revendreth]]. 

But not clever enough... I think.

Come, [[Maw Walker]]. Follow me and do not make a fuss. Keep your weapon ready. The envoy you brought is not as well intentioned as you might have thought.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 4,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Chelra was a nathrezim the entire time I knew her? 

Even in death I must still contend with the schemes of the nathrezim. I have grown too trusting in my penance.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|My dear Stonewright, Harvester of Wrath, wielder of Elu--}}
:''The Stonewright ignores Renathal as she walks past him, focused on Chelra.''
:{{text|say|The Stonewright|Chelra the Bladewall. How have you been, my child?}}
:{{text|say|Chelra the Bladewall|Mother of Stone. You honor me with your concern. I am well.}}
:{{text|say|The Stonewright|Impressive, considering Denathrius had you beheaded after casting Renathal into the Maw.}}
:{{text|say|The Stonewright|Reveal yourself, infiltrator.}}
:''Chelra sheds her disguise, revealing herself as a dreadlord, alongside three of the Stonewright's eviscerators!''
:{{text|say|Nal'ragas|Always so clever. Only... I am not the infiltrator. I am the distraction.}}
:{{text|say|Nal'ragas|Now! Seize the medallion! Remove the interlopers!}}
:''Nal'ragas drops mirrors on the Maw Walker, Kael'thas, and Vashj, transporting them some distance away.''

On the other side, Kael'thas and Vashj start following the player:
:{{Abilities|Dreadlord Hunting Party|id=350683|Followed by two specialists in hunting dreadlords.|icon=ability_demonhunter_sigilofinquisition}}

During PTR, the second line of the quest text read: ''I was not entirely convinced you were not one, the first time I saw you. They have gotten more clever over the eons since I banished them from [[Revendreth]].''
