==Objectives==
Speak with the forward scouts in [[Korthia]].
*[[Keeper's Respite Defense Report]] {{co|61.9|25.4|Korthia}}
*[[Fauna of Korthia Report]] {{co|54.6|30.5|Korthia}}
*[[Anima Survey Notes]] {{co|52.3|39.2|Korthia}}
*[[Whisperer Vyn|Maldraxxi scout]] spoken with {{co|60.1|31.3|Korthia}}
*[[Mawsworn Movement Report]]

==Description==
Each of the [[covenant]]s have provided their own specialists in their areas of expertise. A few of them have taken to the field to scout this unknown land.

Speak with them, they should all be keeping a report of their survey. Return them to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}

==Progress==
Have you found all of the scouts?

==Completion==
Most of this information is useful. My thanks, [[Maw Walker]].

==Notes==
Speak with [[Nadjia the Mistblade]] just downhill:
:Defensive fortifications are going well. I hope the [[Mawsworn]] attack sooner rather than later, my sword form could use some practice.
:{{gossip|Bolvar requests your current report.}}
:{{text|say|Nadjia the Mistblade|Please let the Highlord know that I would like to be sent on the front lines sooner rather than later.}}

Exit Keeper's Respite and cross over to [[Mauler's Outlook]] to find [[Featherlight]]:
:The wildlife here is fascinating. They are incredibly resilient despite large changes to their ecosystem! The flora seems to be struggling, however.
:{{gossip|Bolvar requests your current report.}}
:{{text|say|Featherlight|Now shoo! Before you blow my cover! Oh, now there's a new idea...}}

Down to the south is a [[Surveyer Mnemis]]:
:Currently unable to finish survey. Chance of failure due to hostile creatures at 95%. Guardian unit needed.
:{{gossip|I will guard you while you finish the report.}}
:{{text|say|Surveyer Mnemis|Starting final reading. Caution: anima may attract hostile wildlife.}}

Defeat the [[Ravenous Gorger]] that spawns for the [[Anima Survey Notes]].

Return to just south of the [[Keeper's Respite]] for [[Whisperer Vyn]]:
:Maldraxxus has a few spies overlooking key points in the Mawsworn's movement within Korthia. My partner in the area was supposed to return from her run a while ago. I have grown... concerned.
:{{gossip|Bolvar requests your current report.}}
:{{text|say|Whisperer Vyn|Unfortunately we must assume the worst. One of the mawsworn below may have my partner's report if she was found by them.}}

Drop into the [[Scholar's Den]] and defeat [[Mawsworn Corruptor]]s, [[Mawsworn Mutilator]]s, and [[Mawsworn Torturer]]s until the [[Mawsworn Movement Report]] drops.
