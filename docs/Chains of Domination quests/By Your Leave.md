==Objectives==
Meet with Lady{{Sic}} Vashj at the [[Seat of the Primus]], and request [[Khaliiq]]'s help.
*Speak with [[Vashj|Baroness Vashj]] {{co|52.9|68.8|Maldraxxus}}

==Description==
I have a task set before me by my Baroness, Lady Vashj. With assistance, my vengeance would be swift. But she must approve of your help as well as my release to assist you with your task.

Go to the Seat of the Primus. There we will speak with her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}

==Progress==
Good. You move swiftly.

==Completion==
With your assistance I should be able to clear my list quickly.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|I must now make for Revendreth. Good hunting, <name>. Lady Khaliiq.}}
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|Meet me at the Seat of the Primus, <name>.}}
:''Huln walks out onto the balcony, soulshapes into his eagle form, and flies away.''

Find Baroness Vashj and Khaliiq outside the [[Seat of the Primus|Seat]] proper on the [[Bleak Redoubt]]. Speak with Vashj, who has different dialogue for Necrolords:
:Welcome back, Maw Walker--your loyalty suits you well.

...and non-Necrolords:
:Maw Walker. You've deigned to return, I see.

Either way, she has the following gossip option:
:{{gossip|<Explain the situation and request Khaliiq's help for Ardenweald.>}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Khaliiq. Purge Kel'Thuzad's loyalists from the House of Rituals. Then you may aid the Night Warrior.}}
:''Khaliiq salutes.''
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|By your leave, Baroness.}}
