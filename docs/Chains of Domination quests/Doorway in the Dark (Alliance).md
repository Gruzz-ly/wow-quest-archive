'''Doorway in the Dark''' begins the final chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]], "What Lies Ahead", at [[:Renown]] 58.

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Jaina]] and witness the end of the battle in [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned|Torghast]].
*Await Jaina's return
*Ask Jaina what happened in Torghast

==Description==
I fear our efforts to stop [[Zovaal]] have been thwarted, mortal.

A doorway has been opened to a forbidden realm... and the Banished One has reclaimed a power taken from him long ago.

I sense your allies returning from the [[Sanctum of Domination]]. I must know every detail of what transpired.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Death's Advance]]

==Completion==
<Jaina appears sad, but resolute.>

We still have hope.

==Notes==
;On accept
:''A portal opens behind the Primus and Thrall and Jaina emerge.''
:{{text|say|The Primus|Your allies approach, mortal.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|We tried to stop [[Sylvanas Windrunner|her]]. To stop them both. We failed.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|The Jailer is gone. And he's taken [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] with him.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|Then the day I long dreaded has finally come to pass.}}

Jaina has unique gossip text:
:I thought I knew what Sylvanas was capable of. I believed we could stop her and rescue Anduin.
:But the Jailer had the upper hand all along.

As does Thrall:
:I've seen Sylvanas Windrunner in battle. She's always been a formidable foe.
:But I've never seen her wield power like that.

Talk to Jaina to view the [[Sylvanas Windrunner (tactics)#Cinematic|Sanctum of Domination ending cinematic]]:
:{{Gossip|<Witness the end of the battle.>}}

Talk to Jaina again to turn in.
