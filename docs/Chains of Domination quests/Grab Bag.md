==Objectives==
Test the transportation device from [[Ve'nari's Overstuffed Bag|Ve'nari's bag]].
*[[Transferral Augmentor]] used {{co|46.9|41.5|Maw||1}}
*Transfer successful {{co|61.6|59.0|Maw||1}}

==Description==
Interesting. Aural sequencers and an ethereal cloak. You hang on to those, <name>. I have a suspicion they will prove useful.

Ah, and something special for me as well. If I'm not mistaken--and I so rarely am--this is a projection mechanism. Very handy!

And what's this? A transportation device of some kind. We should test it immediately.

By "we," of course I mean you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Completion==
This projector is certainly useful. A safe landing, I perceive.

==Notes==
[[File:Grab Bag.jpg|thumb|Ve'nari and her projection.]]
Ve'nari has some gossip here:

{{gossip|The bag you had me carry wasn't yours?}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|This is no time for idle chatter, Maw Walker. Come, we have much to do.}}

To Ve'nari's right is a yellow Transferral Augmentor. Use it -- it teleports players to [[Zovaal's Cauldron]], but 50 yards up!
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|You were transferred, yes?}}

Thankfully the automatic Slow Fall saves some ground-induced [[Stygia]] loss. As the player reaches the ground:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Interesting! I've made an adjustment to the device to modify the destination coordinates.}}

Oh well, mount up (yay!) and return to Ve'nari:
:{{text|say|Projection of Ve'nari|Ah, yes! This projection device is already proving useful! Now, about that travel attempt of yours...}}
:{{text|say|Projection of Ve'nari|Do try again.}}

Try again, and this time the Maw Walker lands outside [[Desmotaeron]] in the [[Beastwarrens]]. Ve'nari has sent a projection to the adventurer alongside the Maw Walker. That projection has some gossip:
:It is as if I am right there with you exploring ... with no risk to me.
