==Objectives==
[[File:Blind Loyalty.jpg|thumb|Nikolon and Adrestes at the [[Eonian Archives]]]]
Join [[Polemarch Adrestes]] at [[Elysian Hold]] for an audience with [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|the Archon]].
*Speak to [[Kyrian Courier]] to fly to Elysian Hold (Optional)
*Meet with Adrestes at Elysian Hold {{co|55.7|41.9|Elysian Hold}}

==Description==
The path forward for the [[kyrian]] is clear to me now.

First we will speak with [[Nikolon]]. I urge you to stay and listen.

Afterward, we must return to Elysian Hold.

There I will request an audience with the Archon, and I need you all by my side as I do so.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Ascended]]

==Progress==
The kyrian must forge a new path.

==Completion==
<Adrestes bows his head deeply.>

It is an honor. But we have only just begun.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Fallen Disciple Nikolon|The Forsworn never sought war. But our own brethren cast us out and refused to listen.}}
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|I see that now, and I truly apologize. Uther has taught me much this day. Bastion must follow a new path.}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|Nikolon, please accompany us. We must find a way to reunify our people.}}

Nikolon has some gossip:
:The anger, animosity... we must put it aside.
:The forsworn deserve to be listened to, to be respected. As do the kyrian.

[[File:Blind Loyalty - Elysian Hold.jpg|thumb|The party at Elysian Hold]]
Talk to the nearby [[Kyrian Courier]] for a ride back to [[Elysian Hold]]:
:At your request, I can escort you to Elysian Hold.
:{{gossip|Take me to Elysian Hold.}}

Adrestes is waiting at his usual spot, now accompanied by Uther, Nikolon, Kleia and Pelagos. Speak with the polemarch:
:I admit feeling a hesitation I have not felt in ages, <name>.
:I must push it aside to do what is best for the future of the kyrian and the Shadowlands.
:Are you with me?
:{{gossip|I am ready.}}

An in-game cutscene plays:
[[File:Blind Loyalty - Archon's address.jpg|thumb|The Archon's address]]
:''Kyrestia addresses a large crowd of kyrian and Forsworn alike, with the four paragons, Kleia, the Maw Walker, Adrestes, Uther (without his new armor), and Nikolon in the forefront. [[Aspirant Thales]], [[Hipokos]], [[Koa]], [[Kou]], [[Kynthia]] are among those standing further back in the crowd.''
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|All five paragons are needed for our covenant's [[sigil]] to be reforged.}}
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|Upon this day, we shall name a new Paragon of Loyalty.}}
:{{Text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|My Archon... loyalty bereft of compassion fractured the very heart of the kyrian.}}
:{{Text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|Perhaps what we need is not loyalty, but... devotion. To our cause. To each other.}}
:''Adrestes and Uther exchange a look.''
:{{Text|say|Kleia|And to the souls we usher into the Shadowlands.}}
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|When [[Devos]] turned against us, I [[Devos (tactics)|met her]] with [[Archon's Spear|spear]] in hand.}}
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|There was truth in her words, but I did not listen.}}
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|Let us learn from Uther's example.}}
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|Henceforth, all kyrian shall be offered a choice: to keep their memories or to let them go.}}
:''As Kyrestia speaks, the camera pans over first the Forsworn part of the crowd and then the kyrian.''
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|Adrestes, I anoint you Paragon of Devotion.}}
:''Adrestes nods.''
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|And Kleia, you shall serve as his hand.}}
:{{Text|say|Kleia|Me? Forgive me, my Archon, but I--}}
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|Your devotion to our sacred charge has never faltered.}}
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|None are more deserving of this honor than you.}}
:{{Text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|Thank you, my Archon. We go in service.}}
:''Adrestes and Kleia kneel.''

Turn in to Adrestes.

Kleia has new gossip for the rest of the questline:
:The future of the kyrian is in each of our individual hands. With the new temple of Devotion, we will work to form a new Path, one where everybody has a voice in their own journeys.

As does Fallen Disciple Nikolon:
:I will devote all that I am to aid the forsworn and kyrian to find true unity once more.
