==Objectives==
[[File:I Intend to Live Forever.jpg|thumb|Andorhal, before the fall]]
Aid [[Uther]] in reliving his final memory.
*Uther's memory entered
*Scorge forces slain (10)
*Scared Citizen rescued (5)
*Arthas confronted

==Description==
Please, <name>. I am not finished.

There is one more memory that I must see. One more that must be faced.

It... it will not be easy. I will need support from all of you.

But it must be done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
<Adrestes is deep in thought.>

==Completion==
<Adrestes breaks from his thoughts, a renewed resolve in his eyes.>

I believe this experience was the missing piece for Uther. And for me as well.

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|Kleia|Your wound... does it still hurt?}}
:{{text|say|Uther|It does. Perhaps it always will.}}

Back into the Soul Mirror one more time, this time to [[Andorhal]], before it fell to the Scourge. This memory replays parts of the "[[Digging up the Dead (WC3 Undead)|Digging up the Dead]]" chapter of ''[[Warcraft III]]''.

While the events of the quest occur, the present-day Uther will sometimes speak offscreen to the kyrian near him in Bastion. In the transcript below, Uther's quotes are marked ''(Present)'' or ''(Past)'' to distinguish between this Uther and the one in the past.

:{{text|say|Pelagos|What is this place?}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|This is the moment of your death, isn't it?}}
:{{text|say|Uther the Lightbringer|He came for the urn... the one that held the ashes of the father he slew.}} ''(Present)''

Upon heading further into Andorhal:
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|Why this memory, Uther? Why linger here?}}
:{{text|say|Uther the Lightbringer|In that moment... I failed him. I did not uphold the virtues. Compassion, least of all.}} ''(Present)''
:{{text|say|Uther the Lightbringer|My heart had never been so cold. I faced him not as a mentor, or even a friend, but as a bitter foe.}}
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|Perhaps. But confronting this memory has taught you the value of compassion more than any scripture ever could.}}
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|Take that lesson to heart, Uther. The past may be immutable, but the future has yet to be written.}}
:{{text|say|Uther the Lightbringer|I will. Arthas... If only I had tried to save you...}}

Friendly [[Conclave Priest]]s and [[Silver Hand Paladin]]s are stationed throughout the town. Defeat Scourge forces, including [[Vicious Ghoul (Western Plaguelands)|Vicious Ghouls]], [[Desiccated Swordsman|Desiccated Swordsmen]], [[Desiccated Magus|Desiccated Magi]], and [[Opengut Abomination]]s. While killing, look for quivering [[Scared Citizen (Western Plaguelands)|Scared Citizens]] to rescue them. Lots of citizens can be found in and around the town hall:
*{{text|say|Scared Citizen|Thank the Light you are here.}}
*{{text|say|Scared Citizen|How far Prince Arthas has fallen...}}
*{{text|say|Scared Citizen|I will find my way to the priests. Thank you!}}
*{{text|say|Scared Citizen|The path is clear? Thank you!}}
*{{text|say|Scared Citizen|You must stop him. Our city is falling to ruin!}}

Once the quota has been filled, Arthas&mdash;now in death knight form and riding [[Invincible]]&mdash;calls out:
:{{text|yell|Arthas Menethil|Face me, Uther, and I'll make sure you die quickly.}}

Arthas will walk up to Uther, wherever he is, then turn hostile. Aggro him:
:{{text|say|Uther the Lightbringer|I dearly hope there's a special place in hell waiting for you, Arthas.}} ''(Past)''
:{{text|say|Uther the Lightbringer|No! I spoke in anger...}} ''(Present)''
:{{text|say|Arthas Menethil|We may never know, Uther. I intend to live forever.}}

Knock Arthas down as far as possible, but Arthas is putting out way more DPS than Uther is, so the fight will go as it's supposed to. Once Uther runs out of health, or if Arthas somehow hits 70%, Arthas will dismount and kill Uther with [[Frostmourne]], absorbing a fragment of his soul while another, golden fragment flies off into the sky, mirroring the depiction of the event in ''[[Afterlives]]''.

Back in the Eonian Archives, Uther's name has changed to "Uther the Lightbringer", and he now wears a full set of golden armor. He also has new gossip text:
:I stand now on the path to healing. My past made me worthy of this afterlife. I will learn as much as I can from the lessons it teaches.

Turn in to Adrestes. On complete:
:{{text|say|Pelagos|Uther, if these memories pain you so, you can be rid of them in time.}}
:''[[Nikolon|Fallen Disciple Nikolon]], [[Kynthia]], and a [[Forsworn Representative]] land next to the Soul Mirror.''
:{{text|say|Uther the Lightbringer|No. They serve as a reminder of lessons learned. Given the choice, I would never let them go.}}
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|If given the choice...}}
:{{text|say|Fallen Disciple Nikolon|Adrestes. We must speak.}}
