==Objectives==
[[File:Hunting Huln.jpg|thumb|Not Huln, but Mal'Ganis!]]
Don a disguise then search [[Dominance Keep]] for [[Huln Highmountain]] while avoiding the guards.
*Hear the plan
*Disguise Obtained
*Speak with [[Busy Stoneborn]] {{co|30.3|30.0|Revendreth}}
*Find [[Stoneborn Detainment Chief|another stoneborn who might know something]] {{co|37.9|23.8|Revendreth}}

==Description==
Huln is somewhere in the area... But [[the Stonewright]] isn't letting anyone in to her territory because of the [[Chains of Domination campaign#The Unseen Guests|recent, ah, troubles]] with [[Nathrezim|Dreadlords]]. The guards won't let anyone in, and they're kicking out anyone who doesn't look like they belong.

Lucky for Huln, [[Cudgelface]] and I came up with a foolproof plan!

We just need to look like we belong and then we can ask around and find Huln. Easy!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
Well, this is exciting!

==Completion==
I'm busy with this piece of dreadlord filth. Find something useful to do before the Stonewright gets angry. You don't want to see her angry.

==Notes==

Speak with Moonberry again:
*It's nice to see you again!
*Ready for some fun, <name>?
:{{gossip|What's the plan?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|We need to look like we belong, so you and I are going to don some disguises!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|We need to look like we belong, so you're going to put your fabulous acting skills to use!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|We'll ask if anyone has seen Huln. He's sure to stick out like a broken twig around here!}}
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|You just worry 'bout them keen-eyed ones. They'll see through you right quick.}}

Speak with Moonberry again, and choose an option:
*{{gossip|I am ready for my disguise.}}
*{{gossip|<You strike a pose.> I am ready for an encore performance!}} (Night Fae only)
*{{gossip|<You sigh.> Just don't make me a horse again.}} (Night Fae only)

It doesn't matter what option was chosen, as Moonberry disguises the Maw Walker with a '''Stoneborn Glamour''', turning them into a stoneborn of random gender:
:{{Abilities|Stoneborn Glamour|id=351329|Glamored to look like a stoneborne.{{Sic}} Your mounts do not recognize you and ignore your call.|icon=inv_gargoylebrute2mount_pale}}

As indicated by the tooltip, the player cannot mount while glamored. However, they can Fall With Style:
:{{Abilities|Fall With Style!|id=355503|Moonberry's Glamour can glide for short periods.|icon=ability_demonhunter_glide}}

Which takes the form of an Extra Action Button:
:{{Abilities|Fall With Style!|id=355499|Falling speed reduced. Not a long glide, but it'll do in a pinch.|icon=ability_demonhunter_glide|notes=Instant. 15 sec duration. 1 min cooldown.}}

In addition, movement speed is passively increased:
:{{Abilities|Let's Be Hasty!|id=353817|Lady Moonberry has charmed you to move faster.|icon=rogue_burstofspeed}}

Should players lose their disguise or get discovered, speak with Moonberry again to hop back in the disguise. In the meantime, Moonberry disguises herself as an "Inconspicuous Stone Fiend".

Start heading east. Near the first [[Keeneyed Eviscerator]] or [[Keeneyed Guardian]]&mdash;which have truesight&mdash;Cudgelface calls out:
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|Watch out. That's one of 'em what can tell you're disguised.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Right. Don't be suspicious. Don't be suspicious, don't--}}
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|No no no no--we don't do that here.}}

Players can fight while in the disguise, so don't be afraid to run over [[Shrieking Evedweller]]s to avoid the keeneyed units.

[[File:Busy Stoneborn.jpg|thumb|[[Busy Stoneborn]]]]
Approach the [[Busy Stoneborn]]:
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|Oi. Maybe that one knows something.}}

Speak with the stoneborn:
:What?
:{{gossip|Have you seen anything unusual?}}
:{{text|say|Busy Stoneborn|No. But we will slaughter any intruders on sight!}}
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|Oh, right we will, oh yes definitely! Slaughter! Carry on, then!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|I think we need to be a bit more specific.}}

[[File:Stoneborn Detainment Chief.jpg|thumb|[[Stoneborn Detainment Chief]]]]
Head to the southeast corner of Dominance Keep, where the [[Stoneborn Detainment Chief]] is guarding [[Mal'Ganis]] alongside several Stoneborn Steelwings. Lady Moonberry attempts to affect a stoneborn voice:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Hello, fellow stoneborn! Might we ask you a question?}}
:{{text|say|Stoneborn Detainment Chief|No. You may not.}}

Turn in to the detainment chief, then speak with Mal'Ganis for the next quest...
