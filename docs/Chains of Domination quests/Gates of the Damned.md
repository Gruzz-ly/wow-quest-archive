[[File:Death Gate to Ardenweald.jpg|thumb|Death Gate to Ardenweald]]
We need to prepare for the assault before we signal [[Zerekriss]]. Once it is in place, our allies will use death gates to assault the area.

We will need to summon the death gates on this side. Find strategic locations for them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==

Once we have all of these death gates summoned, then the real fight can begin.

==Completion==
That should be enough to let the bulk of the army through.

After picking up this quest, Draka and Thrall join the party, offering additional quests: [[Clip Their Wings]] and [[Weapon in Hand]].

Start out by heading up the stairs and taking a right to enter the building. Clear a path to the back and place the Death Gate to Bastion at {{co|67.5|65.5|Maw||1}}:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|I see you wear the armor of [[Orgrim Doomhammer]].}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|He left it to me as a gift. One of many he gave me.}}

:{{text|say|Thrall|You were of the [[Frostwolf clan|Frostwolf Clan]] in life, were you not?}}

On the way, stop by {{co|61.9|56.4|Maw||1}}, where [[Weaponmaster Hyrev]] holds [[Dra'gora (item)]] for [[Weapon in Hand]].

Down the steps to the northwest to find the Death Gate to Revendreth at {{co|62.5|51.6|Maw||1}}:
:{{text|say|Thrall|You are a warrior of great skill, Draka.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|I was forged in battle. As were you, I am told.}}

:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Who taught you to fight, Thrall?}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|[[Aedelas Blackmoore|A human]]. He wanted a gladiator. He made an enemy.}}
