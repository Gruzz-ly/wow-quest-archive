==Objectives==
Acquire the Helwrought Seal from [[Kjellrun]] and release [[Danica the Reclaimer|Danica]] from her captivity.
*[[Helwrought Seal]] {{co|65.9|60.0|Maw||1}}
*Mawsworn cage unlocked

==Description==
Remain quiet. We must not attract attention.

Many of my sisters have already been lost. It will soon be my turn to perish in that witch's vile ritual.

Release me from this cage and I can see us both to safety. Keeper Odyn must be warned of this foul betrayal!

The [[Mawsworn]] called Kjellrun holds the seal that can free me. You can find her gloating in the nearby hall.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
This is no fate for a [[Val'kyr]]!

==Completion==
I will tell the tale of your noble deeds, <name>. Your actions this day will be remembered.

==Notes==
Enter the unguarded room immediately to the south, and use the cloak to sneak to the back. [[Kjellrun]] is in the back of the room.

Aggro:
:{{text|say|Kjellrun|Vyraz's incompetent lackeys let you through? I'll finish you myself!}}

Defeat:
:{{text|say|Kjellrun|Helya... take... you...}}

[[File:The Harrower's Key Ring.jpg|thumb|The Harrower's Key Ring.]]
Before leaving, note [[The Harrower's Key Ring]] hanging on the wall to Kjellrun's left. It contains a [[Seal Breaker Key]] for the [[Domination Sealed Chest]] elsewhere in [[Desmotaeron]].

Head back out to the surface and interact with the cage to unlock it.
