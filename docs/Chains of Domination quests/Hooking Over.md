==Objectives==
Travel to the floating island with a hookshot, then repair the anima conduit.
*Anima conduit repaired {{co|19.1|39.5|Korthia}}

==Description==
[[File:Hooking Over - Heirmir and the anima conduit.jpg|thumb|[[Bonesmith Heirmir]] and the anima conduit]]
I've made some solid hookshots and grapple points. Don't worry--if they hold my weight, they'll hold yours!

They can get us across the chasm to the next anima conduit.

I'll go on ahead and wait for you. No telling what might be lurking over there.

The sooner we get the anima conduit working, the sooner we get into the vault and claim the [[Primus]]'s sigil.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Completion==

What a ride! Keep that hookshot.

Just be careful using it. That thing will chew through any normal grapple points.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Another fragment. The Primus has spoken of this Sepulcher before. Do you know what it is? Or where?}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|The Sepulcher is... not to be discussed. Even with allies.}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Hmph. "Keeper of Secrets" indeed.}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Alright, Maw Walker. Fire on that grappling point and hold on tight!}}
:''Heirmir grapples over.''

Follow Heirmir, grappling across to the far remote island. Herirmir's set up a few yards away from the conduit:
:These [[devourer]]s are going to make this repair difficult.
:I'm not touching that thing until you say you're ready, <name>.
:{{gossip|Begin the repairs. I will defend you.}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Mawsworn, devourers... seems like everyone wants a piece of this place.}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Hmm. That's not good.}}
:{{text|yell|Bonesmith Heirmir|Handle that devourer while I finish the repairs!}}

[[Xorul the Insatiable]] appears. Take it out.
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|This conductor is a shoddy piece of work!}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Pah! Built by amateurs!}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Just need to link these parts together...}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|I'm not exactly proud of this repair job, but it'll do. Let's get back to Tal-Galan.}}
