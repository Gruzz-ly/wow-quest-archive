==Objectives==
Activate the waystone and travel to [[Oribos]].
*[[Waystone to Oribos (Korthia)|Waystone]] activated {{co|64.5|24.0|Korthia}}
*Waystone used

==Description==
[[File:Waystone in Korthia activated.jpg|thumb|The activated Waystone.]]
The prophecies told us that one day this dormant waystone would be needed by a [[Maw Walker]]. That it would prove crucial to the fate of the [[Shadowlands]].

It seems that day has come.

Draw upon the [[anima]] within you to activate this waystone. It will then be usable by all those who aid your cause.

If, as you say, [[Tal-Inara]] has created an anchor in Oribos, then that anchor will bring you back to us.

Go, <name>. Inform your allies that the [[Maw]] awaits... and that [[Korthia]] needs their help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}

==Progress==
Is the way to the Maw open to us?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. I am eager to learn of this realm pulled into the Maw.

It is time to begin our assault on [[the Jailer]]'s forces.

==Notes==
[[File:Opening to Oribos - covenant forces.jpg|thumb|Covenant forces in [[Oribos]].]]
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|I think it best to remain concealed while you activate this waystone. Remember, Maw Walker, our business is not yet concluded.}}
:''Ve'nari enters Stealth and walks to a small cave behind the waystone.''

Interact with the Waystone to attune with it, then interact with it again to teleport to the [[Ring of Transference]] in [[Oribos]]. The new gateway is at the northwest position. A large number of covenant forces are gathered outside the gate, including [[Polemarch Adrestes]], [[Draka|Baroness Draka]], [[Tal-Inara]], [[Bolvar Fordragon|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon]], [[Kleia]], and [[Bonesmith Heirmir]].
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|The Maw Walker returns. The second waystone has been found.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Fine work, Maw Walker.}}

Among the generic covenant forces, the following are present: [[Attendant Protector]]s, [[Kyrian Ascendant]]s, [[Kyrian Steward]]s, [[Venthyr Aristocrat]]s, [[Venthyr Noble]]s, [[Necrolord Commander]]s, [[Bladeguard Captain]]s, and [[Forest Defender]]s. [[Ve'rayn]] is also in the middle.

Tal-Inara has a special gossip:
:I never thought I would see such dire times.

:I must examine your anima to determine whether it is strong enough to withstand the drastic will of the Purpose.

==Progression==
{{Maw Walkers}}

==PTR version==
;Description
The texts spoke of the caretaker trying to open a gateway to the Maw.

I did not understand why Tal-Inara would ever do such a thing... but now it is clear. She is trying to fight the Jailer.

Your anima now has the strength to empower the old waystone here.

It will connect to the gateway Tal-Inara is holding within Oribos... and allow those without your anima to pass through.

Go through it and announce that the Maw's seal has breen breached.

;Completion
You've returned! 

Now it is time for us to begin the assault.
