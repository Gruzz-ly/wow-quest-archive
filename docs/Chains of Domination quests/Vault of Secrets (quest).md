'''Vault of Secrets''' begins the fourth chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]], "The Last Sigil", unlocked at [[:Renown]] 44, and after completing your [[Covenant Campaign]].

==Objectives==
Meet with [[Tal-Galan]] outside of [[Scholar's Den]].
*Tal-Galan met near Scholar's Den
*Speak with Tal-Galan outside of Scholar's Den.

==Description==
You've helped us regain a semblance of order, [[Maw Walker]], but the outlook is dire.

[[The Jailer]]'s forces have launched an all-out assault upon the ruins of [[Vault of Secrets|our vault at the outer reaches]] of [[Korthia]]. Clearly the Banished One seeks something of value inside.

The vault's defenses activate when the structure is threatened, so getting inside won't be easy. But we must recover whatever the Jailer is seeking before his Mawsworn do.

I've enlisted the aid of a necrolord who can help open the vault.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|57|40}}

==Completion==
We have our smith. Now we must move forward with the plan.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|I will meet you and our friend up ahead, Maw Walker. Purpose guide us.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Secutor Mevix, gather your forces. Secure the vault exterior until the Maw Walker arrives with Tal-Galan.}}
:''The generic covenant combatants gathered at the Respite take flight towards the Vault of Secrets. Mevix mounts a [[flayedwing]] and accompanies them.''

Head southwest to just outside the [[Keeper's Respite]], where [[Bonesmith Heirmir]] is ready:
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Good, you're here! Let's get this done. I don't want to linger in the Maw a moment longer than I have to!}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|I understand, Bonesmith. Once the the vault is opened, you can be on your way.}}
