==Objectives==
[[File:The Anima Trail - gap across the islands.jpg|thumb|The gap across the islands]]
Follow the anima trail to the next conduit.

==Description==
So [[the Jailer]] seeks the [[Primus]]'s [[sigil]]. We must beat the [[Mawsworn]] to it. To open the vault, we need to power it with [[anima]].

You helped [[Bonesmith Heirmir|the Bonesmith]] repair the first conduit. The trail of anima in front of us leads to the next.

If we can activate it, then there should be enough anima flowing into [[Korthia]] to get us inside the vault.

Come, we must make haste!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
*+75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Completion==
A chasm!

We will need a way to get across to the next anima conduit.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Record keepers, return to the Respite. You will be safe there.}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|So the Primus came to Korthia after he left Maldraxxus. He must have suspected the Jailer was plotting to escape.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|So it would seem. If we can locate more records, perhaps the answers will be found within them.}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|With the Primus gone, dark times fell upon Maldraxxus... and all the Shadowlands. We need to find him!}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|If he confronted the Jailer, there may be nothing left of your master.}}
:''Heirmir slowly walks up to Tal-Galan, who backs away in response.''
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Say that again and there will be nothing left of you. Understood?}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Understood.}}
:''Heirmir runs past him and down the road to the west before despawning. Tal-Galan follows her, albeit at a safe distance.''

Follow the trail west along the east-west road to the far end of [[Hope's Ascent]]. The anima is heading to another Anima Conduit... on a floating island across a gap over the void:
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Our plan is ruined! There's no way to get across this chasm.}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Nonsense! Everything we need is right here. All that's required is a few strong bones!}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Bones?! Oh my!}}

==Progression==
