==Objectives==
[[File:Navrataal.jpg|thumb|Navrataal]]

Meet [[Prince Renathal]] in [[Sinfall]].
*Ride [[Navrataal]] {{co|25.1|27.8|Revendreth}}

==Description==
[[Mal'Ganis]].

It has been many ages since I have said his name. And now I find we must hunt him down.

If he has the [[:Medallion of Wrath]] then there is nowhere he can hide. We can use the other medallions we have recovered to locate him.

Join me in Sinfall and bring your [[nathrezim|dreadlord]] hunting party. I suspect we will have need of them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 4,100 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Let us begin.

==Completion==
The nathrezim may not be [[venthyr]], but nor were they crafted from souls. In many ways, they are more my siblings than my fellow venthyr.

A shame what they have chosen to become.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|The Stonewright|Maw Walker, with me. The rest of you, make for Sinfall. I want that medallion back and Mal'Ganis's head on a spike.}}

Renathal has some gossip:
:It has been a long time since I engaged in warfare against dreadlords. I had forgotten how deceptive they can be.
:Even the Countess would be impressed with their knack for duplicity.

Hop on [[Navrataal]], the bearer of [[the Stonewright]], to fly back to the [[Ember Ward]] and enter [[Sinfall]] proper.

==Progression==
