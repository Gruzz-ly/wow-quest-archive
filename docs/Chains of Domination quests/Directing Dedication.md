[[File:Anima Channeler.jpg|thumb|An anima channeler]]
Redirect [[anima]] from the [[Citadel of Loyalty]] to [[Temple of Loyalty|the temple]].
*South Anima Channeler activated {{co|22.7|25.0|Bastion}}
*North Anima Channeler activated {{co|24.2|22.8|Bastion}}
*South Anima Collector activated {{co|22.6|23.4|Bastion}}
*North Anima Collector activated {{co|22.6|22.3|Bastion}}

*North Gate Vesper rang {{co|20.7|21.6|Bastion}}

==Description==
[[File:Anima Collector.jpg|thumb|An anima collector]]
The five temples of [[Bastion]] have stood strong since its very creation. The idea of rededicating one has never been broached before, and will no doubt require a significant amount of anima.

Underneath this temple are stores of anima we rationed for the drought. Now that anima is returning, we can use these reserves for our purposes.

You will need to use channelers and collectors throughout the grounds to redirect anima to the top. That should give me the power I need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Ascended]]

==Progress==

We endeavor to perform a monumental feat, one that has never been attempted before.

==Completion==
It is heartening to see so much anima flowing again.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Kleia|Join us at the vesper when you are ready. Good luck, friends.}}
:''Kleia and Adrestes fly off, leaving Uther and Nikolon with the player.''

Find the two channelers on the western side of the mainland, then fly over to the floating island (or take the Anima Gateway by the north channeler). Interact with the two collectors, then head up to the top floor and ring the two bells.
