==Objectives==
Help [[Bonesmith Heirmir]] repair the Anima Conduit.
*Anima conduit repaired {{co|60.9|34.6|Korthia}}

==Description==
[[Tal-Galan]] briefed me on the situation and explained [[Vault of Secrets|the vault's]] workings. As well as any scholarly type could, at least.

First we need to ensure the vault is getting power. They use underground conduits to feed it [[anima]].

The [[attendant]] says that one of these conduits is tucked away in a cave in [[Scholar's Den]].

You get me there and I'll find a way to fix it. Just watch my back while I figure out how these [[Korthia]]n devices work.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
*+75 reputaiton with [[Death's Advance]]

==Completion==
After the drought the Shadowlands suffered, I'll never take flowing anima for granted again.

==Notes==
[[File:Xalvez the Collector.jpg|thumb|Xalvez the Collector]]
Pick up [[Vengeance for Korthia]] and [[The Knowledge Keepers]] before heading out.

On accept, Heirmir starts accompanying you, but she refuses to assist in combat:
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|You do the fighting, I'll do the fixing. The sooner I can get home to my forge, the better!}}

Enter the [[Caverns of Contemplation]] and head to the lower level. Interact with the [[Anima Conduit (Korthia)|Anima Conduit]] to have Heirmir start hammering away at it:
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|This shouldn't take long to fix. Just make sure I don't get gutted by any Mawsworn!}}

Waves of enemies will spawn. The first consists of two [[Mawsworn Corruptor]]s, the second of a [[Mawsworn Mutilator]], and the last of [[Xalvez the Collector]]:
:{{text|yell|Xalvez the Collector|The Jailer will reward us for killing the Maw Walker!}}

Defeat it:
:{{text|yell|Xalvez the Collector|You won't be so fortunate when next we meet!}}
:''Xalvez teleports away. Heirmir stops hammering at the conduit, which starts sending orbs of anima flying out of the cavern.''
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Not my most elegant work, but it'll hold. Meet you up top.}}
:''Heirmir runs off and despawns.''
