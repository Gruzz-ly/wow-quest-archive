==Objectives==
Slay 10 [[Mawsworn]] in upper [[Desmotaeron]].
*[[Helya]]'s Mawsworn slain (10)

==Description==
Every enemy we vanquish here is one our army does not have to contend with. We will make sure they will not soon forget the true purpose of [[Maldraxxus]]. Show them what happens to those we deem a threat towards the [[Shadowlands]].

Kill every [[Mawsworn]] in sight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==
Each Mawsworn we defeat is one less that will bother our forces in [[Korthia]].

==Completion==
They were foolish to think they could cross blades with us.

==Notes==
After picking up this quest, run into [[Helgarde Keep]], where [[Fallen Disciple Nikolon]] lies broken on the ground:
:{{text|say|Fallen Disciple Nikolon|Maldraxxi? Here?}}

He starts [[Forsworn and Forgotten]].

Players still have access to the bonus ability from the previous quest:
:{{Abilities|Necrotic Barrage|Causes all enemies within 15 yards of the impact to take 25% increased damage for 20 sec. Inflicts 52,860 Shadow damage to enemies within 15 yards of the impact.|range=100|cd=30 sec|notes=Instant|id=350588|icon=spell_necro_voodooblast}}

Take advantage of it to speed the killing.

==Progression==
{{An Army of Bone and Steel}}

==Patch changes==
