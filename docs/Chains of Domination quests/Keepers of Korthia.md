*[[Tal-Rahl]] rescued {{co|45.8|81.3|Korthia}}

==Description==
[[File:Tal-Rahl.jpg|thumb|[[Tal-Rahl]]]]
We've barely held out against [[the Jailer]]'s [[Mawsworn|forces]]. Now that you're here, we can finally make some progress.

I know your priority is to enter the vault, but there are some of our record keepers out here who need to be recovered.

They are the authorities about everything kept in the vault. We can't let the Jailer learn what they know.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Good to have you on our side, Maw Walker.

==Completion==

A pity all three keepers did not survive. Good work tracking down the two that did.

==Notes==
On accept of both, all three join the party, and Kah-Rev will serve as a guardian in combat:
:{{text|say|Protector Kah-Rev|I have trained my entire existence for this moment. For this battle. I will follow your lead, Maw Walker!}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|You'd fit well in Maldraxxus, Protector!}}

Tal-Yor is to the west:
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|It is good to see you safe, friend!}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Yor|Tal-Galan? I saw a vision of the Maw Walker, but not of you...}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|The threads of fate surprise us all.}}

Tal-Rahl is to the southwest:
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Come, my friend.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Rahl|Is it wise for you to join the battle, Tal-Galan?}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|These are desperate times.}}

Tal-Xuhl is on the eastern side of the area, dead:
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Tal-Xuhl. Your legacy will be remembered.}}

On complete of both, the three attendants, Protector Kah-Rev, and Heirmir walk forward.
