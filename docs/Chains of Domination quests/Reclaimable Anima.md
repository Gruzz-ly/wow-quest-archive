==Objectives==
Collect 5 Tainted Centurion Cores from [[Forsworn]] centurions.
*[[Tainted Centurion Core]] (5)

==Description==
[[Mikanikos]] has explained much about Forsworn [[centurion]]s to me, <name>.

I cannot say that I understood all of it, but it seems he has not yet found a reliable way to return them to their proper operating standards.

Their [[anima]] can still be useful, though!

[[Polemarch Adrestes|Adrestes]] has focused on how to rededicate the temple, but not on his own safety. I worry the process will drain much of his anima.

If you can reclaim cores from the Forsworn centurions, we can use them as anima stores for Adrestes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Ascended]]

==Progress==
I've been working with Mikanikos on methods to reuse anima from Forsworn centurions. I can handle this!

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. If Adrestes falters, I now have the anima to pick him back up.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Kleia|Join us at the vesper when you are ready. Good luck, friends.}}
:''Kleia and Adrestes fly off, leaving Uther and Nikolon with the player.''

Kill [[Automated Defender]]s, [[Dark Sentinel]]s, and [[Ravening Guardian]]s for their [[Tainted Centurion Core]].
