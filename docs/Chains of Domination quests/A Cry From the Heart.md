'''A Cry From the Heart''' begins the seventh chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]], "The Power of Night", unlocked at [[:Renown]] 52. On login, an [[Urgent Message from Ardenweald]] will follow the player around, offering this quest. A backup message has a fixed spawn location at the [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Ysera]] at the [[Heart of the Forest]].

==Description==
<The voice of Ysera emanates from the scroll as you read the words.>

<Name>,

There is a matter of great importance which requires your help. Please meet me at the Heart of the Forest as soon as you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|57|40}}

==Completion==
Thank you for coming so swiftly, <name>. [[Ardenweald]] is in need of your help.

==Notes==
The game does not provide a shortcut, so get to Ardenweald the normal way. [[Ysera]] will appear outside of the Heart proper for non-Night Fae players. Unfortunately, the very next quest sends players to Maldraxxus, so don't let the flight path mount get too far away...

==Progression==
{{The Power of Night}}

==Patch changes==
