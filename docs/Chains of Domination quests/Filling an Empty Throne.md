==Objectives==
Return to the [[Seat of the Primus]].

==Description==
[[Maw Walker]].

In my long absence, you have done much to bring order and strength back to the [[Necrolord Covenant|necrolord covenant]]. In recognition, I invite you to witness a ceremony.

Return with me to my seat of power in [[Maldraxxus]]. It is time I rewarded one who was most loyal to our cause.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This is the first step toward the restoration of Maldraxxus.

==Notes==
No shortcut is provided, so get back to the Seat manually. The sanctum is placed in a special phase during this quest and [[The Roads We Walk]]. With the exception of the cave in the southern end, the peripheral rooms have been emptied of most of their inhabitants, and a number of NPCs await in the main hall:
*The statue of the Primus has disappeared and the real Primus is standing in front of the empty platform.
*[[Plague Deviser Marileth|Marileth]] and [[Kevin]] are waiting in the southeastern corner.
*[[Draka]] and [[Thrall]] are standing by the [[Anima Conductor]].
*[[Emeni]], [[Khaliiq]], and [[Vashj]] are lined up along the eastern wall.
*Along the western wall, [[Alexandros Mograine|Alexandros]] is standing with some [[Forsworn]] and the [[kyrian]] characters from the original [[Maldraxxus storyline]]: [[Hipokos]], [[Koa]], [[Kou]], [[Kynthia]], [[Fallen Disciple Nikolon]], [[Aspirant Thales]], and two [[Liberated Forsworn]].
*A small number of [[Prime Bladeguard]]s patrol around the area.
