==Objectives==
[[File:Suspicious Communication.jpg|thumb|Suspicious Communication]]
Collect clues and then slay [[Zelmany]].
*Clues collected (5)
*[[Zelmany]] slain {{co|72.3|44.9|Maldraxxus}}

==Description==
[[File:Zelmany.jpg|thumb|Zelmany]]
Zelmany was integral in the fall of [[Akarek|my Margrave]].

[[Margrave Sin'dane|Sin'Dane]]{{Sic}} believes he is trying to gather forces loyal to [[Kel'Thuzad]] so they might help him in his next plot.

We should look for clues to his location and then slay him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
The traitors cannot run!

==Completion==
One of the ringleaders is dead but I will not be satisfied until they are all dead.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|Baroness, did you know this "[[Tyrande Whisperwind]]" in life?}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|I know she is hard to kill. Focus on your mission, Khaliiq.}}
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|As you command.}}

Head northeast to the [[House of Rituals (subzone)|House of Rituals]], where Khaliiq shows up to accompany you and assist in combat:
:{{Abilities|Hunting with Khaliiq|id=350896|Hunting with Khaliiq.|icon=9xp_sigil_maldraxxus01}}

Upon killing a mob:
*{{Text|say|Khaliiq|A traitor's blood... so delicious...}}
*{{text|say|Khaliiq|Eternal silence awaits you.}}
*{{Text|say|Khaliiq|Vengeance for Akarek!}}

In addition, she'll make comments when brought to specific areas of the house. The southern part of the [[Reagentry]]:
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|All who betrayed Akarek will suffer. Night Warrior or not, I do not rest until the last foe is dead at my feet.}}

Northern part of the Reagentry:
:{{Text|say|Khaliiq|It seems Kel'Thuzad's minions continue his schemes even in his absence. We must slaughter them all.}}

The [[Prime Arcanum]]:
:{{Text|say|Khaliiq|Under Kel'Thuzad's command, these liches nearly eradicated the House of Eyes. A truth I will not forget.}}

The [[Grimoirium]]:
:{{Text|say|Khaliiq|In life, I became the Night Warrior to seek vengeance for my people. Much as I do now.}}

For this quest, look for [[Suspicious Communication]] scrolls on the ground, which contain, in order:
#[[A Half-burned Scroll]].
#[[Half a Dissolved Letter]]
#[[A Torn Note]]
#[[A Folded Missive]]
#[[A Crumpled Subversive Pamphlet]]

After the fifth clue, find [[Zelmany]] outside the House of Rituals to the southeast, on the [[Rotting Mound]]:
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|I believe we know where to find our target. Let us not keep him waiting.}}

On aggro:
:{{text|say|Zelmany|I will unmake you.}}

==Progression==
{{The Power of Night}}
