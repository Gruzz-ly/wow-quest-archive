# Chains of Domination campaign

[[File:Korthia.png|thumb|Korthia]]

The '''Chains of Domination campaign''' covers the storylines added in [[patch 9.1]] as part of the overarching [[Shadowlands campaign]], tracked in the achievements [[Chains of Domination (achievement)]] and [[Breaking the Chains]]. Many of the quests take place in [[Korthia]], the new addition to the [[Maw]].

The campaign is a followup to the four [[Covenant Campaign]]s. Starting in chapter four, the campaign is [[Renown (Shadowlands)]]-gated, requiring Renown in steps from levels 44 to 58 for the ninth and final chapter.

==Unlocking the campaign==
To unlock the first three chapters of this campaign, characters must have finished the Torghast chapter of their covenant campaign, ending with [[The Search for Baine]]. Once that is done, [[The First Move]] will be offered automatically as soon as players log in after [[patch 9.1]] goes live.

The rest of this campaign requires players to have earned [[Covenant Campaign]] by finishing all nine chapters of the 9.0 campaign.

;Skipping to the campaign
Level 60 alts of players can skip a few steps by doing the following:
#Choose a covenant
#Head to the sanctum and unlock covenant abilities
#Skip the covenant sanctum intro and unlock the first soulbind
#Head to Oribos
#Speak to Bolvar and choose the {{gossip|I have already learned of Anduin's fate. {{text|red|<Skip ahead of the Anduin exposition and cut scenes to begin Chains of Domination quests.>}} option}}
#Relog or speak with Adrestes to start [[The First Move]]

For more details on the skips, see [[The Highlord Calls]].

==Skips==
[[File:The First Move.jpg|thumb|The covenant representatives in Oribos]]
Alts can skip past the first three chapters of ''this'' campaign by speaking with [[Bolvar Fordragon]] as soon as they arrive in Oribos:
{{dialogue|We know the Jailer is watching us. And that he has Anduin.

Our only hope is for you and other heroes to make the covenants strong, <name>.

The day will soon come that the Jailer and Sylvanas reveal the next phase of their plan.

When they do, it will require all our strength to overcome them.

{{gossip|I have heard this tale before. {{text|red|<Skip ahead to Korthia.>}}}}}}

Be warned that this skip will '''forfeit''' the following:

* A 187 item level weapon of your choice
* 10x [[Stygian Ember]]
* A [[Death's Advance War Chest]]
* Some reputation with [[Death's Advance]] and [[Ve'nari]]
* 4x catchup [[Emblem of Renown]] granted by the quests

This action will complete the [[#Battle of Ardenweald|Battle of Ardenweald]] chapter, the [[#Maw Walkers|Maw Walkers]] chapter, and the [[#Focusing the Eye|Focusing the Eye]] chapter: skipping over [[The Battle of Ardenweald]], becoming [[The True Maw Walker]], unlocking the [[Waystone to Oribos (Korthia)|Waystone to Oribos]] in [[Korthia]], and the chain to fend off the [[Eye of the Jailer]]. The next quest that skipping alts will be able to pick up will be [[Vault of Secrets (quest)]], first quest of the [[#The Last Sigil|The Last Sigil]] chapter, at [[:Renown]] 44.

==Main campaign==
[[File:VZ-Korthia.jpg|thumb|Korthia map]]
The primary campaign is nine chapters long and covers the covenants' loss of their [[sigil]]s to [[Zovaal|the Jailer]], gaining access to [[Korthia]],  and fending off of [[Mawsworn]] forces attacking from [[Desmotaeron]]. The covenants then work to reforge their sigils so the new ones can be used against the Jailer.

===Battle of Ardenweald===
[[File:The Battle of Ardenweald.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Ardenweald]]
[[Bolvar Fordragon]] reaches out to the Maw Walker with a message from [[Polemarch Adrestes]]. The Archon has been severely wounded, and her [[sigil]] stolen by [[Anduin Wrynn]]. Realizing that the [[Winter Queen]]'s sigil is under threat, the Maw Walker, alongside Bolvar Fordragon and [[Jaina Proudmoore]], head to [[Ardenweald]] to defend her in a conflict that is immediately termed the "Battle of Ardenweald".

{{Battle of Ardenweald}}

===Maw Walkers===
[[File:Keeper's Respite.jpg|thumb|[[Keeper's Respite]]]]
A second waystone has been detected on [[Korthia]], the realm that [[The Jailer]] pulled out of the [[In-Between]] into the [[Maw]]. Realizing that the Maw Walker individually ferrying Shadowlands denizens out of the Maw is untenable, the attendants utilize a portion of the Maw Walker's anima to bind with the new waystone, allowing all covenant forces to easily travel to the Maw and back. Additionally, the player becomes [[The True Maw Walker]], regaining access to all ground mounts in the Maw.

{{Maw Walkers}}

===Focusing the Eye===
[[File:Focusing the Eye.jpg|thumb|Facing off against the Eye of the Jailer]]
Ve'nari has the Maw Walker set up an [[Animaflow Teleporter]] back to [[Ve'nari's Refuge|her refuge]], then tests out some new items she found. One of them sends the Maw Walker to [[Desmotaeron]], where [[Helya]] and [[Vyraz]] have holed up. After saving a [[Val'kyr]], the Maw Walker and the Val'kyr return to [[Skyhold]] and gain the Wrath of Odyn, then use that newfound power to permanently fend off the [[Eye of the Jailer]], ending [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|that mechanic]] for players.

Portions of this storyline are revisited in [[Lorewalking]].

===The Last Sigil===
[[File:Untangling the Sigil - Primus and Jailer.jpg|thumb|The Primus and the Jailer]]

At Renown 44 and with the [[patch 9.0]] [[Covenant Campaign]] complete:

Realizing that three of the five [[sigil]]s have been taken by [[Zovaal|the Jailer]], [[Tal-Galan]] and a few members of the Necrolord Covenant set out to recover the Sigil of [[Primus|the Primus]]. They discover the Primus hid it in the [[Vault of Secrets]], which has been besieged by [[Mawsworn]] forces. Clear a path through, open the way to the [[Chamber of the Sigil]], and recover the sigil.

Upon completion of this chapter, players will be granted the [[Memories of Sunless Skies]], which unlocks flight account-wide in the four level-up zones of [[Shadowlands]].

{{The Last Sigil}}

===An Army of Bone and Steel===
[[File:A Traitor's Due - battle begins.jpg|thumb|The Primus and allies facing Helya and Vyraz]]

At Renown 47:

The covenants' hold on [[Korthia]] is tenuous, so long as [[Vyraz]] and [[Helya]] are next door in [[Desmotaeron]], so the [[Primus]] sends [[Draka]] and the [[Maw Walker]] to cut the head off of the snake. [[Thrall]] shows up, and wants to tag along. The party fend off Helsworn forces, summon in the [[Zerekriss]], and defeat Vyraz. The Primus also banishes Helya back to [[Helheim]].

{{An Army of Bone and Steel}}

===The Unseen Guests===
[[File:Dreadlords - Korthia.jpg|thumb|The real Vashj and an infiltrator]]

At Renown 50:

[[Vashj|Baroness Vashj]] attempts to start a quest at [[Keeper's Respite]], but is quickly revealed as a [[nathrezim]] by the real Vashj! This starts a sequence of events sending the Maw Walker and Vashj to [[Revendreth]] to ally with [[The Stonewright]] as [[Kael'thas Sunstrider]] comes along for the ride. Dreadlords are everywhere, and it's time to clear them out. With the Stonewright pledging her Stone Legion to join Korthia's efforts, Revendreth was free to craft a new sigil.

{{The Unseen Guests}}

===The Power of Night===
[[File:The Power of Elune.jpg|thumb|The Power of Elune]]

At Renown 52:

[[Ysera]] reaches out to the player, urgently requesting help for [[Tyrande Whisperwind]]. The power of the [[Night Warrior]] is about to take over, and [[Huln Highmountain]] has been sent on a hunt to find night warriors in the other realms. He identifies warriors in [[Maldraxxus]] and [[Revendreth]], so the Maw Walker has been tasked with collecting them. The party then gathers in the [[Grove of Awakening]] to complete the ritual. With the Heart of the Forest healed, the Winter Queen was able to restore Ardenweald's sigil.

{{The Power of Night}}

===A New Path===
[[File:The New Path.jpg|thumb|The ceremony at the Seat of the Archon]]

At Renown 56:

In an attempt to bring the [[Forsworn]] back into the fold, [[Thenios]] checks in with [[Bolvar Fordragon]] at [[Keeper's Respite]], and hands the Maw Walker an [[Attuned Shard]] to find the other half of [[Uther]]'s soul. After recovering the [[Remnant of Justice]] from [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned]] Thenios uses his soul mirror at the [[Temple of Wisdom]] in [[Bastion]] to help Uther work through his memories of becoming a paladin and the purging of [[Stratholme]], making [[Arthas]] a paladin, and reliving his death in [[Andorhal]]. After that, [[Polemarch Adrestes]], Uther, and [[Nikolon|Fallen Disciple Nikolon]] work to retake the Citadel of Loyalty. For his efforts, Adrestes is promoted to Paragon, and the now-full complement of five paragons plus the Archon create another sigil.

{{A New Path}}

===What Lies Ahead===
[[File:Covenants Renewed.jpg|thumb|The sigils assembled]]

At Renown 58:

After the events of the [[Sanctum of Domination]], Thrall and Jaina return to Keeper's Respite to relay that the Jailer managed to claim the final sigil from the Arbiter and escaped through a portal with Anduin in tow. After Jaina and company uncover a farewell message that Anduin left behind for them, the covenants present their remade sigils to the Primus, who explains that he needs them—along with a replacement for the Arbiter's sigil—in order to follow the Jailer to his destination: the [[Zereth Mortis|land of the First Ones]]. He tells the Maw Walker that he'll call for them when the key is ready, marking the end of the campaign.

Although this chapter chronologically takes place after the Sanctum of Domination, the player does not need to have completed any part of the raid to access the chapter.

{{What Lies Ahead}}

==Side quests==
[[File:Hope Ascending.jpg|thumb|The Lodestaff]]
Outside of the main campaign, a few side quests are also available.

===Archivists of Korthia===
After "Charge of the Covenants", the Maw Walker comes across the [[Researching Korthian Relics (item)]] item, leading them to [[Archivist Roh-Suir|Scholar Roh-Suir]] in the [[Seeker's Quorum]]. He is desperately trying to save [[Archivist Roh-Senara]] from the Mawsworn. The attendants ask the Maw Walker to recover the [[:Lodestaff]], a Shadowlands relic. This unlocks the [[Archivists' Codex]] reputation faction, and [[Relic Fragment]] drops from rares, treasures, and vignettes in [[Korthia]] and [[Desmotaeron]].

Most of the time spent on the quest chain will be grinding out reputation by turning in Relic Fragment-containing items and recovering more artifacts at reputation milestones. Players can expect over a month of gathering relic fragments to reach rank six with the Archivists' Codex.

{{Archivists of Korthia}}

===They Could Be Anyone===
[[File:Under the Illusion.jpg|thumb|An illusion revealed]]
After "Good News, Everyone!", [[Pathscribe Roh-Vess]] asks the Maw Walker to locate [[Fatescribe Roh-Kalo]], who has not been seen since the Jailer's attack on Korthia. Alongside the attendant [[Caretaker Kah-Than]], the Maw Walker retraces Roh-Kalo's last steps.

{{They Could Be Anyone}}

===Tazavesh, the Veiled Market===
[[File:Tazavesh the Veiled Market.png|thumb|[[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market (instance)|Tazavesh, the Veiled Market]]]]
In the [[Idyllia]] of [[Oribos]], the innkeeper has a message for the Maw Walker, starting a questline to unlock the megadungeon [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market (instance)|Tazavesh, the Veiled Market]]. Portions of this storyline are revisited in [[Lorewalking]].

{{Tazavesh intro}}

===The Box of Many Things===
[[File:The Box of Many Things.jpg|thumb|The Box of Many Things]]
After unlocking a foothold in Korthia, a short quest line unlocks [[The Box of Many Things]], which acts as a significant boost to the player's power in [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned|Torghast]]. It also grants [[The Box of Many Things (achievement)]] achievement.

#[[In Darkness, Found]] (optional)
#[[The Box of Many Things (quest)]]
#[[Tower Knowledge (quest)]]

==Maw events==
===Covenant assaults===
[[File:Necrolord Assault.jpg|thumb|The Necrolord assault on Perdition Hold]]

*[[Night Fae Assault]] ([[Crucible of the Damned]], [[Legsplitter War Harness]])
*[[Venthyr Assault]] ([[Tremaculum]], [[Harvester's Dredwing Saddle]])

*[[On the Offensive (achievement)]]
*[[Breaking Their Hold]]
*[[Rooting Out the Evil]]
*[[Taking the Tremaculum]]

Additionally, assaults will award an [[Emblem of Renown]] for players who are catching up.

===Tormentors of Torghast===
Every two hours, [[Kel'Thuzad]] sends out one of the [[Tormentors of Torghast]] to attack an area in the Maw. Take out the minions and lieutenants to fill the bar, then defeat the Tormentor of Torghast for 10% progress in [[Shaping Fate]], a [[Tormentor's Cache]], and likely an item drop or two.

Once a week, players can complete the [[Phantasmagoria]] quest, which starts from the [[Warped Phantasma]] found inside the Tormentor's Cache.
