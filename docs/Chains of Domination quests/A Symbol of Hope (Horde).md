'''A Symbol of Hope''' is the second quest in the final chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]], "What Lies Ahead", at [[:Renown]] 58.

==Objectives==
Assist in examining Anduin's compass.
*Learn about [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]]'s compass
*[[Enchanted Compass|Compass examined]]

==Description==
Before Anduin followed the Jailer through the gateway, he dropped something.

I'm not sure what it was, but Jaina picked it up. Perhaps this is a sign that Anduin is still fighting back against the Jailer!

We need to find out what [[Varian's compass|this object]] was, and why the young king left it for us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Why did Anduin leave this for us to find?

==Completion==
Anduin Wrynn does not deserve such a fate.

We must fight to save him, <name>!

:{{text|say|Thrall|Jaina, what was it that Anduin left behind?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|A compass. It was a gift to his father. [[Varian Wrynn|Varian]] had it with him just before... before we [[Battle for Broken Shore|fought]] the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] on the [[Broken Shore]].}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I don't believe Anduin dropped it by accident. He must have wanted us to find it.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|As a sign that he hasn't been fully dominated by the Jailer's power?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I believe it's more than that. I sense an enchantment on the compass. Perhaps Anduin used the [[Light]] to leave us a message.}}
:''Jaina and Thrall walk over to a nearby flat boulder.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Bolvar, will you help us examine the compass?}}
:''Bolvar joins them.''
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Of course, Jaina.}}
:''Jaina and Bolvar start channeling on the compass.''
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|The compass is imbued with a memory.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I sense it too. Very clever, Anduin! What did you want us to see...}}
:''They stop channeling.''

Jaina has some gossip text:
:Anduin... I swear by the Light, we will not lose him to Jailer.{{Sic}}

Examine the [[Enchanted Compass]] on top of the boulder to trigger a cutscene:

:''The compass opens, glowing with Light, and creates images of Sylvanas and Anduin.''
:{{text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|The battle is almost upon us.}}
:{{text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|I will deal with the invading forces atop Torghast.}}
:{{text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|When we reach Oribos, you will defend Zovaal while he completes the ritual.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|You mean he will compel me to defend him.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Each time he dominates my will, I feel myself slipping further away.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Is this what you felt when Arthas raised you, Sylvanas?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Hollow. Empty. Everything you once were... consumed by darkness.}}
:{{text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Yes, young lion. But in the end, the sacrifices we've made will have been worth it.}}
:{{text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Once the cycle of Life and Death has been broken and remade, we will--}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|By that time, I'll have been lost. And so will you.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I only hope my friends will remember me as I was...}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Not what you made me to be.}}
:''The compass closes, ending the vision.''
