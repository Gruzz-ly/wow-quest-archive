This honor is more than I could have hoped. 

There is a long road ahead, but with the help of my fellow kyrian--all kyrian--the Temple of Devotion will embody the future of our people.

Let the true work begin.

Speak with Kalisthene:
:I devoted myself to overseeing and advising aspirants long, long ago. I was not the only one at first... but as the drought persisted, my peers were needed elsewhere until I was the only one left.
:My orders were to keep the aspirants training, to bide our time until the drought passed. I was not to tell them that every single soul was sent straight to the Maw, that the Shadowlands had broken down. I told them what I could... but I was alone and had to keep myself calm.
:For my hard work to be first recognized via my inclusion of the Path of Ascension, and now again as the new Polemarch of Bastion... I recognize no higher honor.
:Thank you, Maw Walker. And I am sorry we got off on the wrong foot.
:{{Gossip|I am ready for the ceremony.}}

At the [[Seat of the Archon]] atop the [[Spires of Ascension]], the ceremony is about to begin. In attendance nearly all of the named Kyrian, including [[Kyrestia the Firstborne]], [[Polemarch Adrestes]], [[Thenios]], [[Vesiphone]], [[Chyrus]], [[Xandria]], [[Eridia]], [[Voitha]], [[Koa]], [[Kou]], [[Tymon]], [[Phillios]], [[Khamsius]], [[Sika]], [[Mikanikos]], [[Hipokos]], [[Kleia]], [[Nikolon|Disciple Nikolon]], [[Aspirant Thales]], [[Pelagos]], [[Sika]], [[Aspirant Thales]], [[Uther]], [[Bron (goliath)|Bron]], [[Kalisthene|Polemarch Kalisthene]], [[Kynthia]], [[Apolon]], [[Artemede]], [[Forgelite Sophone]], [[Clora]], [[Arios Riftbearer]], [[Stanikos]], and a few celebrating aspirants and ascended.

The gossip for these and more are on the [[The Grand Reception (quest)]]. Some characters, though able to be interacted, with are unable to be reached because they are flying without a sufficiently tall mount.

Speak with Kleia:
:I never imagined I would become so close to the Polemarch. Now look at us, look at him! It is an honor to watch my friend receive such an honor, and to work alongside him for eons to come.
:{{Gossip|I am ready for the ceremony.}}

A cutscene plays:
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|Many ages have passed since a paragon was last anointed.}}
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|Longer still since we have christened a new temple.}}
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|Today, we do both.}}
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|Adrestes. Step forward.}}
:''Adrestes walks up to the [[Anima Conduit]] and kneels.''
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|Through trying times, you have embodied patience and compassion.}}
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|Virtues that will serve you well as Paragon of Devotion.}}
:''Kyrestia slams [[Archon's Spear]] into the Conduit. The large structure at the back of the Seat of the Archon lights up and infuses Adrestes with a large amount of anima, causing him to grow in size and transforming him into a paragon.''
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|Five temples. Five paragons.}}
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|Take your place among us, Adrestes, as we reforge our covenant's sigil.}}
:''Kyrestia and the paragons channel anima into the Conduit, creating a [[sigil]] that flies up into Kyrestia's hand.''
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|A symbol of our new path forward.}}
:{{Text|say|Kyrestia the Firstborne|One born of unity between kyrian and Forsworn alike.}}
:''The crowd and the Maw Walker cheer.''

Turn in to Adrestes, now titled <Paragon of Devotion>.

During development, the completion text read:
:I am lost for words.
:This honor is greater than I deserve. There is a long road ahead, but with the help of my fellow kyrian -- all kyrian -- we shall forge the Temple of Devotion into what each of us need.
:The work has only begun.
