==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Nal'ragas.jpg|[[Nal'ragas]]|A skilled infiltrator of the nathrazim{{Sic}}.}}
Track down and defeat Nal'ragas.
*[[Nal'ragas]] defeated {{co|23.8|29.0|Revendreth}}

==Description==
[[The Stonewright]]'s medallion must not stay in the hands of the [[nathrezim]]. 

From what [[the Accuser]] explained of our mission, the medallion is required if we wish to forge a new [[sigil]] for the [[Venthyr]]. I have no doubt this is why [[Nal'ragas]] and her ilk executed their ambush now.

The medallions are not subtle magic, and their affect{{Sic}} on this realm is easily tracked. I suggest we give chase and eliminate this Nal'ragas before she can be reinforced.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Completion==
I have spoken with the Stonewright. [[Chelra the Bladewall|Chelra]] fell to the master when I was a prisoner of the [[Maw]]. 

She was my friend and protector through countless ages, and I did not even know she had been slain, her identity stolen.

One more sin for [[Denathrius]] to atone for.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Spy vs Spy]] before heading out.

Kael looks for some information from Vashj:
:{{text|say|Kael'thas Sunstrider|[[Illidan]] would have relished this. What fate do you suppose was chosen for him?}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|You assume he is both dead and mortal. I am not sure either is true.}}

Later:
:{{text|say|Kael'thas Sunstrider|To think I was once allied with these fiends...}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Is that a hint of remorse? How unlike you.}}

Head to {{co|31.4|20.8|Revendreth}}, where Nal'ragas and the Stonewright face off:
:{{text|yell|Nal'ragas|A harvester without her medallion. You are but a shadow of your former fury.}}
:''Nal'ragas siphons the anima from the two Stonewright Honorguards, returning them to stone, before teleporting away.''

Down the steps to the west, at {{co|29.1|22.0|Revendreth}} under the gate:
:{{text|yell|The Stonewright|I wield more than enough fury to deal with you.}}
:''The Stonewright obliterates three Dreadlord Infiltrators with the power of [[Elune]].''

Further southwest at {{co|26.1|26.2|Revendreth}}, halfway up the steps to the elevator:
:{{text|yell|Nal'ragas|Your stoneborn cannot find us all. We are everywhere!}}
:''The Stonewright lands an attack on Nal'ragas, but she returns fire and blasts the Stonewright off the side of the bridge.''

Keep heading southwest along the rampart to the tower {{co|24.3|28.4|Revendreth}} where Nal'ragas is receiving orders from [[Mal'Ganis]], who is now wearing the medallion:
:{{text|say|Mal'Ganis|Continue to delay our foes. The plan nears fruition.}}
:''Mal'Ganis teleports away.''

Aggro her:
:{{text|say|Nal'ragas|Ah, Illidan's lackeys. [[Anetheron]] sends his regards.}}

After killing her, head outside, where Renathal and the Stonewright (riding [[Navrataal]]) are waiting.
