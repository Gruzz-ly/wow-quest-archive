==Objectives==
Examine the recovered recordings with [[Tal-Galan]].
*Speak with [[Tal-Galan]] to hear the recording

==Description==
What fortune! You rescued the [[Record Keeper|record keepers]] before the [[Mawsworn]] could steal their knowledge of the vault's relics.

But their records are fragmented. Incomplete. I pray there's enough left to learn the truth.

I will attempt to coalesce the knowledge that remains into a message. If the [[Purpose]] wills it, we will learn what [[the Jailer]] wants and to whom this item originally belonged.

I must focus for a moment. Let me know when you are ready to begin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Are you ready to begin?

==Completion==
We know what the Jailer wants.

Now we must reach the vault before his forces acquire it.

==Notes==
Speak with Tal-Galan:
:We must reach the vault before the Jailer's forces breach it.
:{{gossip|I'm ready to see the message regarding what is within the vault.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|I have assembled the message. Starting it now.}}
:''An image of the Primus appears!''
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|By the five houses... It's the Primus!}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|Should my suspicions prove true, my sigil will be at risk. I must entrust it to your vaults. Keep it safe at all costs.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|If Zovaal obtains all five sigils, nothing can stop him from--}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Stop him from what? Show the rest of the message!}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|That is all we have. If we can find additional records, I should be able to reconstruct more of the Primus's message.}}
