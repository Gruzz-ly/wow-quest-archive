==Objectives==
Eliminate 3 [[nathrezim]] inside [[Sinfall]].
*Nathrazim infiltrators slain (3)

==Description==
[[Chelra the Bladewall|Chelra]], I mean [[Nal'ragas]], would not have been working alone. We must assume the worst and that not all of our friends and allies are who they seem to be.

It will take time for the [[Court of Harvesters]] to render our detection ritual. While we do so we will be exposed. I ask that you use the techniques you employed at [[Dominance Gate]] within [[Sinfall]] to route out any nathrezim within our ranks. 

Good hunting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
How bad is it?

==Completion==
Subterfuge and counter-insurgence was never my strong suit. We always had souls sent here that were far better than I at such tasks.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Cryptograms]] before heading out.

Use the provided [[Orb of Revelation]] from an earlier quest to detect [[nathrezim]]. Targets include:
;[[Tavian]]
:Standing in as the Innkeeper at {{co|66.0|33.4|Sinfall}}

Speak with him:
:The Stone Legion cannot penetrate these walls.
:{{gossip|Reveal yourself, nathrezim!}}
:{{text|yell|[[Solenor the Slayer]]|We are a long way from [[Silithus]].}}

If Tavian resets:
:{{text|say|Tavian|Nothing to see here.}}

Some banter between Vashj and Kael after defeating Solenor:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|So this is where you perform your penance. It suits you, little prince.}}
:{{text|say|Kael'thas Sunstrider|My days as a prince have ended. One of many changes I have endured.}}

;[[Nadras]]
:Patrolling the semi-circular room near the mirror {{co|42.4|53.6|Sinfall}}

Speak with her:
:You have been very busy, Maw Walker.
:I have been keeping my eye on you. On behalf of my Prince, of course.
:{{gossip|Reveal yourself, nathrezim!}}
:{{text|yell|[[Lady Kisdranath]]|Wretched mortal. You are already too late.}}

;[[Solivane]]
:The Raid Finder Nathrian Weaponsmith at {{co|55.2|45.6|Sinfall|1}} on the lower level

Speak with her:
:What do you require?
:{{gossip|Reveal yourself, nathrezim!}}
:{{text|yell|[[Lady Mel'tranix]]|Displeased with my prices? Ha ha ha!}}

After defeating Solenor, there was additional conversation:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|If we survive this, join me in Maldraxxus. We can make use of your skills.}}
:{{text|say|Kael'thas Sunstrider|Is that sympathy from the siren?}}
:{{text|say|Kael'thas Sunstrider|No. Though it pains me to admit it, I am right where I need to be.}}
