==Objectives==
Slay Ironkeeper Salryx.
*[[Ironkeeper Salryx]] slain {{co|65.2|48.2|Maw||1}}

==Description==
In all the chaos, the gates of the upper hold have been left open. If we slip through, they might not even notice us until it is too late.

One of [[Helya]]'s lieutenants stands between us and [[Helgarde Keep]]. End them.

You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==
We need to get through that gate.

==Completion==
Now to sow chaos here.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|To Helgarde Keep! The Zerekriss will cover us!}}

On the way:
:{{text|say|Thrall|Draka, there is something you need to know. I am--}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Focus on the mission. We will speak later.}}

Head to the marked location on the map, where the maw lich [[Ironkeeper Salryx]] blocks the way. Players have access to a bonus ability:
