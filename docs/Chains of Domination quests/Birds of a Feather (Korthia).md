==Objectives==
Follow the trail of golden feathers to find what dropped them.
*[[Danica the Reclaimer|Winged creature]] found {{co|67.3|55.8|Maw||1}}

==Description==
I have seen many ebon wings in the [[Maw]], but never brilliant golden ones.

Now that the aural sequencers are relaying information reliably, we should discover the source of these feathers.

Follow the trail, [[Maw Walker]]. There is a mystery here... and very likely profit.

Gold has value where you come from, does it not?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==

My heart rejoices to see a noble face in this realm of nightmare.

==Notes==
Use the cloak bonus ability to regain invisibility, then follow the feathers to the southeast. Along the way, two other Maldraxxi Defectors have a conversation:
:{{text|say|Maldraxxi Defector|Wish I could have seen Vyraz strike down Krexus. Must have been a great battle!}}
:{{text|say|Maldraxxi Defector|I heard Krexus begged for his life. Pathetic coward!}}

Further southeast, another conversation:
:{{text|say|Maldraxxi Defector|Vyraz seems to spend a lot of time with the sea witch.}}
:{{text|say|Maldraxxi Defector|Better him than me, I say!}}

In a cage is... a [[Val'kyr]]?
:{{Text|say|Danica the Reclaimer|At last! I knew that help would come!}}


:{{text|say|Danica the Reclaimer|Who goes there? If you intend to torment me, know that you will answer for it!}} <!-- is this PTR? -->
