[[File:Danica and Odyn.jpg|thumb|[[Odyn]] and [[Danica the Reclaimer]]]]

==Objectives==
Accompany [[Danica the Reclaimer|Danica]] to the [[Great Mead Hall]] and inform [[Odyn]] of [[Helya]]'s actions.
*Danica accompanied {{co|58.3|78.4|Skyhold}}
*Danica's announcement completed
*Helya's message delivered

==Description==
When the first of my sisters went missing, we were concerned. Those sent to find her did not return. Nor did the next.

What we have discovered is a dreadful betrayal by someone we once trusted.

Come, we must tell Odyn what we have witnessed in the [[Maw]].

His wrath will be great.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
I do not fault the messenger, <name>.

==Completion==
Helya has gone too far!

==Notes==
Follow Danica into the mead hall, where [[Halfdan Sly-Stalker]] is facing off against [[Drithen the Boisterous]]:
:{{text|yell|Danica the Reclaimer|Odyn! I bring before you this mortal, <name>, whose valor freed me from dire captivity.}}
:{{text|say|Odyn|Welcome to my halls, noble <class>. Danica, tell me of this victory and the foe that would dare imprison one of my val'kyr!}}
:{{text|say|Danica the Reclaimer|My sisters and I were ambushed by Mawsworn who serve Helya. Only I survived. We come bearing a message from that accursed witch.}}

If the character is a warrior who quested in {{Expac|Legion}}, the exchange is slightly different:
:{{text|yell|Danica the Reclaimer|Mighty Odyn! Before you stands your Battlelord, <name>. Their might has been tested and proven once more by freeing me from dire captivity.}}
:{{text|say|Odyn|Hail, Battlelord <name>. It has been too long since your presence graced these halls. Danica, who dares threaten my val'kyr?}}
:{{text|say|Danica the Reclaimer|My sisters and I were ambushed by Mawsworn who serve Helya. Only I survived. We come bearing a message from that accursed witch.}}

Use the bonus ability:
:{{Abilities|Helya's Message|Deliver Helya's message to Odyn.|icon=inv_misc_scrollunrolled04|notes=3 sec cast}}
:{{text|say|Helya|I will twist every val'kyr you send, Odyn, just as you twisted me so long ago. Your own eye betrays them all. Such sweet irony.}}
:{{text|yell|Odyn|She... DARES? By my beard, Helya will answer for this!}}
:''As the screen shakes from Odyn smashing his fist, all present kneel.''
