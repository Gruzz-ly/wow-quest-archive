'''Opening the Maw''' begins the second chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]], "Maw Walkers".

==Objectives==
Have [[Tal-Inara]] examine your [[anima]].
*Anima examined by Tal-Inara
*Speak to Tal-Inara in the Ring of Transference

==Description==
[[The Jailer]] has gained another [[sigil]], and his forces actively assault [[Oribos]].

[[Bolvar Fordragon]] and [[Draka]] of [[Maldraxxus]] suggest taking the fight to the Jailer.

To do so, we need a way for their forces to safely come and go from the [[Maw]].

This was considered impossible before you arrived, but now I believe we have a chance.

I must examine your anima to see if this is truly what the [[Purpose]] wills.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}

==Progress==
I do not do this lightly, Maw Walker.

==Completion==
I do not do this lightly, Maw Walker, but we have no choice.

We must open a gateway to the Maw.

==Notes==
Speak with Tal-Inara:
:I never thought I would see such dire times.
:I must examine your anima to determine whether it is strong enough to withstand the drastic will of the Purpose.
:{{gossip|I'm prepared for you to examine my anima.}}
:''Tal-Inara channels Anima Extrapolation into the Maw Walker.''

:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|[[Fatescribe Roh-Tahl]] has sensed the emergence of a second waystone within the Maw, though he does not know its location.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|Your anima awakened the first waystone. It has allowed you to lead some of your allies to safety.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|I will create an anchor to your anima here in Oribos. Activating the second waystone should connect it to my anchor.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|I believe this bond will enable our covenant forces to leave the Maw, just as you can do.}}
