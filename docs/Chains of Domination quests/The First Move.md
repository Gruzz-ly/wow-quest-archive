'''The First Move''' begins the [[Chains of Domination campaign]] -- the [[patch 9.1]] portion of the [[Shadowlands campaign]]. This quest will be pushed to all eligible players automatically on login. To be eligible, see the prerequisites in the [[Chains of Domination campaign#Unlocking the campaign|unlocking section]] of the campaign article.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Polemarch Adrestes]] in [[Oribos]].
*Speak with Polemarch Adrestes in Oribos {{co|41.3|68.0|Oribos}}

==Description==
While the covenants labor to defend the [[Shadowlands]], [[the Jailer]] has not sat idle within [[Torghast]]. It seems he intends to set the next phase of his scheme into motion.

Polemarch Adrestes has brought us disturbing news from [[Elysian Hold]]. He will recount what he witnessed once you arrive.

Make haste. I fear that time grows short.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}

==Progress==
We will continue to fight.

==Completion==
Anduin... now the Jailer's pawn...

We must take immediate action, <name>. It is time for the covenants to convene.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Maw Walker, Polemarch Adrestes brings grim tidings from Bastion. You are needed in Oribos at once.}}

On approach in the Enclave:
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|By the Light... Adrestes, this cannot be!}}

Alts of players who have completed the first two chapters [[Chains of Domination campaign#Skips|can skip ahead]] by speaking with Bolvar:
:We know the Jailer is watching us. And that he has Anduin.
:Our only hope is for you and other heroes to make the covenants strong, <name>.
:The day will soon come that the Jailer and Sylvanas reveal the next phase of their plan.
:When they do, it will require all our strength to overcome them.
:{{gossip|I have heard this tale before. {{text|red|<Skip ahead to Korthia.>}}}}

Be warned that this skip will forfeit 10x [[Stygian Ember]], a [[Death's Advance War Chest]], some reputation with [[Death's Advance]] and [[Ve'nari]], and the 4x [[Emblem of Renown]] granted by the quests! 

In attendance are [[Bolvar Fordragon]], [[Jaina Proudmoore]], [[Thrall]], [[Baine Bloodhoof]], [[Darion Mograine]], [[Nadjia the Mistblade]], [[General Draven]], [[Lady Moonberry]], [[Plague Deviser Marileth]], [[Secutor Mevix]], [[Polemarch Adrestes]], and [[Kleia]]. Speak with Adrestes:
:We were caught unaware. The Jailer's power has grown more than any of us could have imagined.

A [[Shadowlands in-game cinematics|cinematic]] plays, "Kingsmourne":
{{#ev:youtube|cbkQEgf_TAs|||||t=0m30s}}

''The cinematic starts with an establishing shot of the exterior of [[Elysian Hold]], as Thenios gives a status report from offscreen:''

{{text|bossemote|Thenios|Despite all our efforts, the Maw continues to grow.}}

''Inside the [[Sanctum of Binding]], [[Kyrestia the Firstborne]] is holding court with her four remaining paragons.''

{{text|bossemote|Thenios|What if Denathrius's treachery is irreparable? The Primus is lost, and Bastion cannot save the Shadowlands alone.}}

{{text|bossemote|Archon|None of this should have happened.}}

{{text|bossemote|Thenios|Perhaps the Winter Queen could...}}

''Thenios is interrupted by the sound of wings flapping as Kleia lands with a kneel, before getting to her feet.''

{{text|bossemote|Kleia|My Archon... a living soul seeks an audience.}}

{{text|bossemote|Archon|A mortal?}}

{{text|bossemote|Kleia|A king.}}

''Outside at the [[Eternal Watch]], [[Anduin Wrynn]] walks north, as [[Uther]] is escorted the other direction. Kleia and the Archon continue their conversation off-screen.''

{{text|bossemote|Kleia|By all our measures... one who has spent his life striving for justice.}}

''Uther involuntarily stops and stares at Anduin &mdash; who resembles his former beloved apprentice, [[Arthas Menethil]] in his prime with blond hair and golden armor.''

{{text|bossemote|Kleia|One who would give anything to serve his people.}}

''Uther reaches to the wound on his chest before getting shoved forward by the guard trailing him. Not putting up a fight, Uther resumes his march.''

{{text|bossemote|Kleia|One whose heart... is true.}}

{{text|bossemote|Archon|Very well. He may approach.}}

''Anduin climbs the stairs to [[Archon's Rise]], where the court awaits.''

{{text|bossemote|Archon|Step forward. My Ascended have spoken of you. The king held captive in the Maw.}}

''Anduin speaks with restrained rage.''

{{text|bossemote|Anduin|That prison could not hold me forever.}}

{{text|bossemote|Archon|Why have you come to Bastion?}}

{{text|bossemote|Anduin|You have [[sigil|a key]] that I need.}}

''With Anduin's emphasis on "key", the Archon realizes something, baring her teeth and drawing her spear in the same moment.''

{{text|bossemote|Archon|You... will release this soul from your grasp!}}

''Anduin's voice begins to change...''

{{text|bossemote|Anduin|No.}}

''The four paragons draw their weapons on Anduin and run in to engage.''

{{text|bossemote|Anduin/Jailer|He is bound to me... just as you once sought to bind your own brother!}}

''Anduin summons Kingsmourne, tip down, and smashes it into the ground. The shockwave knocks back the paragons, binding them with chains. The statue behind the Archon shatters, while she shields her face with her left hand for a moment before recovering. A look of shock crosses the Archon's face as Anduin, now looking very much like Arthas Menethil in [[Lich King]] form &mdash; with silver hair and glowing blue eyes &mdash; leaps out of the black smoke at her. Mid-jump, his armor changes color from his traditional gold to the blue-and-grey of the Mawsworn.''

''Though the Archon draws her hands in an attempt to block, Anduin runs her through with Kingsmourne. On her back, the sword draws the crest of her power from the Archon, the sigil of the kyrian. Anduin's eye glow fades for a moment as he seems to recover control of his mind, horrified at his actions, but the runes of his armor light up and appear to reinforce the Jailer's will. He pulls out the sword, looks up at what's left of the statue, and turns to walk away.''

''Later, back in the Maw, the camera looks up at Torghast, as the Jailer speaks off-screen.''

{{text|bossemote|The Jailer|The vessel performed its part flawlessly.}}

''On a platform outside Torghast, Anduin walks up to the Jailer, with Sylvanas looking on. He presents the sword to the Jailer, revealing the sigil of the kyrian.''

{{text|bossemote|The Jailer|Three keys remain.}}

''Sylvanas stares at Anduin, an inscrutable look on her face, before breaking and looking up at the Jailer.''

{{text|bossemote|The Jailer|Then they will see... Death was never meant to be chained.}}

''The camera tilts up, following two large chains embedded into a large landmass floating above: [[Korthia]].''

On complete:
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|We shall convene in the Arbiter's chamber. Our next course of action must be decided.}}
