==Objectives==
Assist [[Master Smith Helgar]] at the [[Forge of Odyn]].
*Talk to Smith Helgar {{co|39.9|36.6|Skyhold}}
*Horn Forged
*[[Newly Forged Horn]]

==Description==
I will answer this attack upon my [[val'kyr]] with relentless fury!

You have a vital role to play in this, <class>. You will muster the courage that you have demonstrated this day to lure [[Eye of the Jailer|my Eye]] to battle.

But first, a simpler task ... the creation of the horn that will summon my wrath. Master Smith Helgar will guide you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
Where is the horn that you have forged?

==Completion==
This is well made, <name>.

Of course, every great horn has a name. It is our tradition!

==Notes==
[[File:Newly Forged Horn.jpg|thumb|Newly Forged Horn.]]

Pick up [[The Chosen Few]] before heading out. On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Odyn|After [[Helya (tactics)|her defeat]], I thought we'd seen the last of Helya's treachery. But her venomous words and deeds never cease to vex me!}}
:{{text|say|Odyn|My own noble, all-seeing eye has been twisted into a weapon of darkness. This insult cannot stand!}}
:{{text|say|Odyn|Danica! Become the instrument of my wrath! Fight alongside this mortal champion and claim victory in my name!}}
:{{text|say|Danica the Reclaimer|It will be done, great Odyn. I vow to avenge my sisters!}}

West at the center to the [[Forge of Odyn]], where [[Master Smith Helgar]] stands ready. Speak with him:
:I hear that Odyn wants us to forge a horn, eh? There are some special ingredients on the table over there.
:{{gossip|I am ready to begin.}}
:{{text|say|Master Smith Helgar|Good. I will handle striking the metal and tell you what materials I need next. Act quickly, it is important the metal doesn't cool or it may crack.}}

Another pick-an-object quest.

Get an object:
*{{text|say|Master Smith Helgar|Apply a handful of the [[Bone Dust of Heroes|bone dust of honored heroes]] there. That will lend strength of purpose to the metal.}}
*{{text|say|Master Smith Helgar|Sprinkle a drop or two of [[Honey Mead|honey mead]] to slake the metal's thirst.}}
*{{text|say|Master Smith Helgar|Add some [[Powdered Flux|powdered flux]]! We don't want the metal to oxidize.}}

Correct:
*{{text|say|Master Smith Helgar|Yes, just like that!}}
*{{text|say|Master Smith Helgar|That's the sound we want. Hear that sizzle?}}
*{{text|say|Master Smith Helgar|Oh, well done. That timing was nearly perfect.}}
*{{text|say|Master Smith Helgar|Are you sure you haven't done this before?}}
*{{text|say|Master Smith Helgar|Good placement on that, <class>.}}

Timeout:
:{{text|bossemote|The metal has cracked. We must start again!}}
*{{text|say|Master Smith Helgar|The alloy must be correct or the metal will crack. Pay close attention and begin again.}}
*{{text|say|Master Smith Helgar|Do not be concerned. These things happen. We must start again, <name>.}}
*{{text|say|Master Smith Helgar|I need each item as quickly as you can add them. Tell me when you're ready to try again.}}

Complete:
:{{text|say|Master Smith Helgar|That's a nice bit of work. Odyn will be pleased.}}

Interact with the [[Newly Forged Horn]] on the anvil to pick it up.
