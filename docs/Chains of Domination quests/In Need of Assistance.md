==Description==
[[File:KaelthasVenthyr.png|thumb|upright|[[Kael'thas Sunstrider]].]]
The inhabitants of Korthia have been through much. Were it not for our arrival the Jailer's forces would have rampaged through the remainder of the City of Secrets, leaving destruction in their wake.

To continue our efforts, we must assist those in need.

Heed the call of our allies, Maw Walker. See to it no stone is left unturned and no ally of the Jailer left alive.

You will receive:
*[[Death's Advance War Chest]]
*10x [[Stygian Ember]]
*2x [[Runekeeper's Ingot]] (500 [[Reservoir Anima]])

==Progress==
How fair your efforts?
