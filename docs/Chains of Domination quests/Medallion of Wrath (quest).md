'''Medallion of Wrath''' is a quest specific to the [[Venthyr Covenant]] at the end of the Unseen Guests questline of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]]. The seventh chapter begins at [[:Renown]] 52 with [[A Cry From the Heart]].

==Objectives==
Bring the [[:Medallion of Wrath]] to the dais in [[Sinfall]].
*[[Medallion of Wrath]] (provided)

==Description==
Maw Walker. I will march with my [[stoneborn]] into the depths of the [[Maw]] and rend the head off every [[nathrezim]] I find there.

However, [[Revendreth]] is still too strategic in this war to lose out of misplaced vanity.

Therefore, as [[Court of Harvesters|Harvester]] of Wrath, the second of that title, I offer you my Medallion for safe keeping and utilization while I wage this war.

Use it to empower the Harvesters so they can prevent [[Denathrius]] from simply returning and regaining control with a snap of his fingers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<The platform surges with power as it feels the proximity of the medallion.>

==Completion==
<Inserting the medallion in the socket tugs violently at your soul as the energies link, flooding a sense of will and intent into everything around you unlike any other energy you have experience before.

Together, the Harvesters rule Revendreth uncontested.>

==Notes==

:{{text|say|The Stonewright|Know that I give you this medallion so that I might be free to expunge the dreadlords from the Shadowlands.}}
:{{text|say|The Stonewright|Abuse this power and I will remind you why I was condemned to Revendreth.}}

Return to Sinfall and interact with the Medallion of Wrath to complete the quest and trigger a cutscene:
:''One by one, the Harvesters begin channeling anima into their respective medallions. With a burst, the sigil of the venthyr manifests above the [[:Crown of the Harvesters]].''
