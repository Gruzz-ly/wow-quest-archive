==Description==
[[File:Ritual Supplies.jpg|thumb|Ritual Supplies]]
[[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande's]] time grows short, so we must act quickly. 

<[[Ysera]] frowns in concern.>

We had hoped to gather more [[Night Warrior]]s, but we will have to proceed with who we have and hope it is enough.

<Ysera shakes her head, then looks more resolute.>

Before we can begin, we must finish preparations for the ritual. Please bring these last few items with you and meet us at the grove.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
Good, we may begin.

==Completion==
With everything in place we can begin. I only hope we are not too late for Tyrande.

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Lady Moonberry]]|Please accept this welcome gift from the Court of Night!}}
:''Moonberry summons a wreath with white flowers on the Stonewright's head.''
:{{text|say|[[The Stonewright]]|No need to trouble yourself...}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Oh, silly me. Here, this one is much better!}}
:''Moonberry summons a wreath with black flowers instead...''
:{{text|say|The Stonewright|This... will suffice. Let us proceed.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|Please, come this way.}}
:''Ysera, Moonberry, and the Stonewright walk down the path to the Grove of Awakening.''

Just east of the carriage is a wildseed cradle holding Ritual Supplies. Interact with it, then mount up and head south to the [[Grove of Awakening]]. There, Tyrande is doing her overwhelming power thing, with [[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris]] by her side. In attendance are Ysera, Lady Moonberry, [[Thiernax]], [[Khaliiq]], and The Stonewright.

Drop off the cradle at the ghost position, then pick up the Basket of Flowers, Fae Ritual Oils, and Basket of Incense, and place them at their appropriate locations. Additionally, three golden globes are in a triangle around Tyrande, so interact with them as well.

The Stonewright has some gossip:
:This place is very... Blue.
:{{gossip|You were a Night Warrior in life?}}
:Obviously, or I would not be here helping you now.
:<The Stonewright arches a brow.>
:I suppose you wish to know how I ended up in [[Revendreth]]?
:{{gossip|Er, yes.}}
:After I was granted [[Elune]]'s dark gift, I fed my rage with my losses and then with my victories. I protected my people. I killed the ones who harmed us. Then their allies. Then ones who hadn't stopped our enemies, or who stood by. Then the ones I thought hadn't acted quickly enough. And so on...
:I erased whole societies from the world, and left nothing but ruins in my wake. After all, if nothing was left to harm us, we couldn't be hurt.
:{{gossip|<Continue listening.>}}
:In the end, the only thing left that threatened my people, was me.
:I was killed by a friend who too wished to protect our people.
:Only in Revendreth after much... contemplation, did I come to understand the depth of my wrath and the gravity of my sins. I learned from my experience how to help others with their own.

As does Khaliiq:
:I do as my [[Vashj|baroness]] commands.
:{{gossip|You were a Night Warrior in life?}}
:My people were preyed upon. Exploited. I asked Elune for vengeance. The double edged blade was granted.
:I became what others feared in the night. I kept my city safe. For a time.
:Such power is not meant for mortals. The blade cut both ways.
:In [[Maldraxxus]] I honed myself to perfection.

As does Thiernax. To non-Night Fae, he simply says:
:[[Winter Queen|Queen]]'s blessing upon you.

To Night Fae, his dialogue is much more extensive:
:Queen's blessing upon you.
:{{gossip|Why did you become the Night Warrior?}}
:To fight a great evil which had slain many.
:A coalition of champions had formed to kill the [[Old God|dark god]] who'd landed on [[Fyzandi|our world]]. To succeed we needed the power the last Speaker had tried to invoke from Mother Moon.
:<Thiernax chuckles sadly.>
:We fought over that. It had already killed his mother. He did not wish for it to kill his husband too. But Elune's power was one of our greatest weapons against the monsters. So I did the ritual. Survived it. He stood by me. Our eyes dark as the new moons, we fought the monsters.
:I did not foresee the cost.
:{{gossip|What was the cost?}}
:The price of Elune's dark power was my life. 
:Mortals are not meant to hold such things. One way or another, it would kill me. For my world, my people, my family, I was willing to make that sacrifice.
:[[Qadarin]] was not so willing to let it happen. To my eternal regret, trying to share the burden killed us both.
:<Thiernax sighs.>
:I should let the past be. What matters is our world was saved and we are still together.
