On accept:
:{{text|say|Mal'Ganis|Worthless fool. You shall regret this betrayal soon enough.}}
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|Oi, should we be worried about him?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|It's not my fault he can't take a joke. So, where are we headed?}}
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|Up and inside, where the squeezers are taken for, uh... processing.}}

Up the stairs to the north, then loop around to the southwest, further uphill. Enter the keep proper:
:{{text|say|Agitated Stoneborn|You are late! We have anima in need of extraction and the Stonewright is occupied.}}
:{{text|say|Agitated Stoneborn|Begin the process. And be quick about it!}}
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|Uh, right! Off we go, then!}}
:''The stoneborn runs off.''

[[File:Wrathful Soul (The Big Squeeze).jpg|thumb|The Wrathful Soul]]
Follow Cudgelface downstairs, where a lone [[Wrathful Soul (The Big Squeeze)|Wrathful Soul]] is waiting. Talk to Cudgelface:
:We best keep a low profile, by helping out.
:{{gossip|Okay. What should we do?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|So... how exactly does this work?}}
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|Well, you see the [[Venthyr|fangs]] make 'em face what put 'em in Revendreth.}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Moonberry|Tell me about the bad stuff you did! Or else!}}
:{{text|say|Wrathful Soul|Never!}}

Players gain a bonus ability:
:{{Abilities|Or Else!|Slap the uncooperative soul.|notes=Instant|icon=ability_warrior_secondwind}}

Run up to the Wrathful Soul and use the ability:
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|Er, not quite. This place is about Wrath. Anger!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Right! Sassy spriggans! Greedy grove-killing Drust! Scenery-chewing gorm!}}
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|Their anger, not yours.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Oh. That makes much more sense.}}

Speak with Moonberry:
:I'm gonna try again, but, uh, just be ready for anything. Okay?
:{{gossip|Okay.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|So... tell me about your mother.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathful Soul|She was my world, and she was slain in front of me!}}

Two [[Burden of Wrath]] spawn. Defeat them:
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|Blimey, that worked. Keep going!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Would you say the loss of your mother made you angry?}}
:{{text|say|Wrathful Soul|I grew up suffering! I had no one else!}}

Two more:
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|Yeah, that's the stuff!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|And do you think losing her led you to a life of murder and rage?}}
:{{text|say|Wrathful Soul|M--maybe? I just--ARGH!}}

[[File:Greater Burden of Wrath.jpg|thumb|[[Greater Burden of Wrath]]]]
A [[Greater Burden of Wrath]] spawns. Defeat it:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Might you have been responsible for quite a few dead mothers yourself?}}
:{{text|say|Wrathful Soul|I... Yes, I was.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Well I think we've had a breakthrough! Good session.}}
:''The Agitated Stoneborn runs down the steps.''
:{{text|say|Agitated Stoneborn|Done so soon? Impressive!}}

Speak with the stoneborn:
:What?
:{{gossip|Have you seen a large, blue soul with horns that doesn't look like he belongs in Revendreth?}}
:{{text|say|Agitated Stoneborn|The intruder? Why do you want to know?}}
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|Well... we're the cleanin' crew obviously! Interrogatin' 'em trespassers makes a mighty mess, doesn't it?}}
:{{text|say|Agitated Stoneborn|Then you will have no shortage of work. I have never seen the Stonewright so furious.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|No! We have to hurry!}}
