==Objectives==
{{questportrait|A Traitor's Due - Vyraz.jpg|Baron Vyraz|Traitor to Maldraxxus, Baron Vyraz's time is short.}}

Kill Vyraz.
*[[Baron Vyraz]] slain {{co|61.4|41.4|Maw||1}}

==Description==
Vyraz has been a constant thorn in [[Maldraxxus]]'s side since he betrayed us. As Baroness of the [[House of the Chosen]], it is my duty to see this threat eliminated... and the murder of [[Margrave Krexus]] avenged.

As the [[Primus]] said, we must remove the head from this snake.

The time to strike is now!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Completion==
<Draka spits on the corpse of Vyraz.>

And with that traitor's end, Maldraxxus will be unified once again!

Make for the [[Deomen the Vortex]] platform at the marked location on the northwestern part of [[Helgarde Keep]], where [[Vyraz]] is calling out to [[Helya]] for assistance:
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|Our enemies approach, Helya. We need reinforcements!}}
:{{text|say|Helya|Scared, Maldraxxi? The Jailer does not tolerate weakness in his ranks!}}
:''The Primus teleports in. Vyraz turns around to face Draka, Thrall, and the player.''
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|Vyraz! You will answer for what you did to Krexus!}}
:{{text|say|Helya|Take my boon, Vyraz. You are outnumbered, after all!}}
:''Helya casts a spell on Vyraz, causing him to grow in size and glow translucent with Maw energy.''
:{{text|say|The Primus|Strike, matron of wolves! Show them the heart of a necrolord!}}
:''To match Vyraz' empowerment, the Primus buffs Draka with {{Abilities|Death's Champion|icon=ability_maldraxxus_warriorplantbanner}}, causing her to increase in size and glow with Maldraxxus energy.''

After buffing their respective champions, Helya and the Primus start throwing magic at each other. Vyraz becomes attackable but will wait for the Maw Walker to make the first move. Let Draka and Thrall tank him, run behind him when he casts Unholy Bulwark, and kill the [[Helya's Boon]] tentacles he summons.

When Vyraz is brought to 60% health:
:{{text|say|Helya|Your time has long passed, decrepit fool. I will enjoy drowning you!}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|No, sorceress. It is you who is out of your depth!}}

At 25%:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|For Krexus! For [[Akarek]]!}}
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|No! I am... stronger! I cannot... lose!}}

As Vyraz falls, a cutscene plays:
:{{text|say|The Primus|It is time to deprive the Jailer of his underling.}}
:{{text|say|Helya|Underling?! Helya is no one's underling! I will not be silenced! I will not be imprisoned! My wrath shall haunt your--}}
:''The Primus opens a portal and banishes Helya from the Maw.''
:{{text|say|Helya|RRRrrrrAAAAAaaahhhh!}}
