[[File:Opening to Oribos - covenant forces.jpg|thumb|Covenant forces in Oribos.]]

==Objectives==
[[File:Charge of the Covenants.jpg|thumb|The forces charging into the portal to Korthia.]]
Rally the covenant forces to go into the [[Maw]].
*Covenants rallied
*Speak with Bolvar Fordragon in Korthia.

==Description==
Thanks to the efforts of you and other heroes of [[Azeroth]], the [[covenant]]s have grown strong. But we can no longer afford to wait for [[the Jailer]] to make his next move.

The way to the Maw is open. Our forces stand ready.

The covenants await your signal, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Emblem of Renown]] (catchup only)
* {{cost|12|87}}

==Progress==
Please, activate the waystone to deliver more allies to us.

==Completion==
The Maw...

Now our true work begins.

==Notes==
Use the bonus ability to have the gathered forces charge headlong through the gateway:
:{{Abilities|Rallying|Rally the troops within Oribos to charge into the Maw!|icon=ability_warrior_rallyingcry|notes=Channeled}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|Farewell, Bolvar Fordragon. May the Purpose guide you.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Goodbye, Tal-Inara. The Ebon Blade will defend Oribos until we return.}}

Follow the raid through the gateway:
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Bolvar Fordragon. I saw your visage within the streams of the Maw Walker's anima.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Good, then there's no need for introductions. We've come to push back against the Jailer's forces.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|You have my thanks. The Mawsworn seek to plunder our secrets.}}

Only [[Ve'rayn]] went to a side, watched the raid, and then turned away.

==Progression==
{{Maw Walkers}}

==PTR version==
;Description
The way to the Maw is open. All that is left now is to signal to the covenants that it is time.

You should have the honor, [[Maw Walker]], of commanding our allies to go.

[[Draka]] has done exceptional work to steel the nerves of those who would venture into the Maw.

;Dialogue
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|You have my thanks. His forces seek to recover something within our vaults... but I am unsure what that is.}}
