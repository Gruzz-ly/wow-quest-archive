'''A Paladin's Soul''' begins the penultimate chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]], "A New Path", at [[:Renown]] 56.

==Objectives==
[[File:A Paladin's Soul.jpg|thumb|Thenios and Bolvar at Keeper's Respite]]
Reclaim the Remnant of Justice from the Ossuary of the Banished in [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned|Torghast]].
*Use the [[:Attuned Shard]] at the [[Wayfinder]] in Torghast
*[[Keeper Hazaduum]] slain
*Portal of Souls entered
*[[Remnant of Justice]]
*Meet Thenios at the Temple of Wisdom in Bastion.

==Description==
[[Bolvar Fordragon]] has seen visions of a vault hidden deep within Torghast where [[the Jailer]] keeps [[soul]]s he deems valuable.

[[Uther]] was struck down by a [[mourneblade]]. When such a weapon is wielded with rage, it can shatter a soul into fragments.

If the Jailer holds a part of Uther's soul, it cannot be fully mended until the lost piece is restored.

Take this attuned shard to Torghast, <name>. It should guide you to the vault's location.

Find the lost fragment of Uther's soul so that he can be made whole.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Ascended]]

==Progress==
Greetings Maw Walker. Your arrival is fortuitous.

==Completion==
I believe this soul fragment may be the key to Uther's recovery.

==Notes==
[[File:Ossuary of the Banished.jpg|thumb|The Ossuary of the Banished]]
When players become eligible to start this quest, Thenios will appear at [[Keeper's Respite]], hovering next to Bolvar. On approach:
:{{text|say|Thenios|The mourneblade tore a fragment from Uther's soul. Without it, I fear he may never heal.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|I have seen a vision of where such vessels are kept. But retrieving it will prove perilous. The Jailer keeps his treasures well guarded.}}

Head into Torghast, and interact with the [[Wayfinder]] for the first time in a while:
:<When infused with an Attuned Shard, this device can open hidden pathways within the tower.>
:{{gossip|<Use the [[Attuned Shard]] to begin your search for Uther's Soul Shard.>}}

Players enter a special quest wing, the "Ossuary of the Banished", which introduces some traps and mechanics of the Adamant Vaults: iron maidens that attempt to drag the player in, bigger iron maidens with Mawsworn hidden inside, Impaled Souls, and rares that are actually [[nathrezim]]!

If players have not already found him, [[Ve'nish]] will appear on the second floor, after the rare. He starts [[The Box of Many Things (quest)]], one of the methods of meta-progression in Torghast going forward.

The third floor is the boss floor, where [[Broker Ve'nott]] is present as always. Just past Ve'nott is [[Keeper Hazaduum]]. Aggro the construct:
:{{text|say|Keeper Hazaduum|Away! These are the prized souls of the Banished One!}}

Defeat it:
:{{text|say|Keeper Hazaduum|His rage... will consume... us all...}}

A Portal of Souls appears once Hazaduum falls. Head through it, and players will be buffed with:
:{{Abilities|Souls of Frostmourne|Viewing many of the soul fragments that Frostmourne tore from its kills.|icon=spell_deathknight_frozenruneweapon}}

This allows players to see numerous previously-hidden soul crystals &mdash; much like the one the Jailer pulled out of his portal to craft [[Kingsmourne]] &mdash; including thirteen crystals labeled "A Forgotten Victim" and nine unique ones:

*The Archmagus Mentor ([[Antonidas]])
*The Betrayed Father ([[Terenas Menethil II]])
*The Blood-Queen ([[Blood-Queen Lana'thel]])
*The Champion of Peace ([[Gavinrad]])
*The First Paladin ([[Uther the Lightbringer]])
*The Golden King ([[Anasterian Sunstrider]])
*The Grand Magister ([[Belo'vir Salonar]])
*The Guardian of Naxxramas ([[Sapphiron]])
*The Holy Lifebringer ([[Halahk]])

Interact with the The First Paladin crystal to loot the [[Remnant of Justice]], then head through the exit portal to leave the wing.

[[File:A Paladin's Soul finale.jpg|thumb|Thenios, Adrestes, Kleia, Uther, and Pelagos]]
Head to the [[Temple of Wisdom]] in [[Bastion]]. The nearest flight paths are [[Sagehaven]] or the [[Terrace of the Collectors]]. Up on the [[Eonian Archives]], [[Thenios]], [[Polemarch Adrestes]], [[Kleia]], [[Uther]], and [[Pelagos]] are having a pow-wow near the soul mirror:
:{{text|say|Thenios|Without a Paragon of Loyalty, we cannot forge a new [[sigil]].}}
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|Many [[Forsworn]] yet occupy the [[Citadel of Loyalty|temple]]. How are we to proceed?}}
:{{text|say|Uther|Through compromise and understanding. I may be of aid in that regard.}}

Uther has the "Overburdened" debuff:
:{{Abilities|Overburdened|id=353464|Consumed by his memories, twisted by Frostmourne and the Maw.|icon=achievement_dungeon_icecrown_frostmourne}}
