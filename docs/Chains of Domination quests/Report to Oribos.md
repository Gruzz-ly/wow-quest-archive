'''Report to Oribos''' concludes the "Battle of Ardenweald" chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]]. Tal-Inara immediately offers the next quest, [[Opening the Maw]]. 

==Objectives==
[[File:Report to Oribos - ice blocks.jpg|thumb|Frozen Mawsworn Ravagers.]]
Return to [[Tal-Inara]] in [[Oribos]].

==Description==
[[Ardenweald]] has withstood the unrelenting force of [[Maw|the Maw]].

But it was still not enough.

Return to our allies in Oribos. There must be an answer for this loss, and action taken.

==Rewards==

You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}

==Completion==
[[The Jailer]] has begun his attack on Oribos.

What I have feared the most has come to pass.

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Winter Queen]]|Despite the courage shown by the [[covenant]]s defending Ardenweald, Zovaal has claimed the [[sigil|prize he sought]].}}
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|There is nothing more to be done here. Return to Oribos, mortal. Your deeds this day will be remembered in the rings.}}

There's no quest-provided shortcut to return to Oribos, so use the normal way.

At the portal landing spot in Oribos, [[Jaina Proudmoore]] is doing her frost mage thing, by freezing and occasionally polymorphing Mawsworn Val'kyr out of the sky. [[Mawsworn Assaulter]]s can be seen further away, pelting Jaina's barrier with spells. Alarmingly, Mawsworn Ravagers have been entombed in ice throughout the city. On the [[Ring of Transference]], dead attendants are everywhere, as [[Thrall]] and [[Baine Bloodhoof]] have been busy fighting off more Mawsworn invaders. [[Thassarian]] and [[Koltira Deathweaver]] also make their rounds up here.

Many of the brokers in the city have sought refuge in the [[Broker's Den]]. The security has been ramped up, and apart from the regulars, the members of the [[Sinstone Swingers]] can also be found here. Above the Den, the outer entrance to the [[Idyllia]] is guarded by [[King Thoras Trollbane]], while the inner is guarded by [[High Inquisitor Whitemane]]. [[Nazgrim]] can be found checking the various points of entry to the [[Ring of Fates]], while [[Rantuko Grimtouch]] is seen leading a group of knights.

Ignore the siege and check in with [[Bolvar]] and Tal-Inara in the [[Enclave]], where a large number of Attendant Scribes and Functionaries have gathered. On approach:
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|We must launch a counterattack before the Mawsworn can strike again.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Inara|You would all be unable to return from the Maw if you entered there. But perhaps there is another way.}}
