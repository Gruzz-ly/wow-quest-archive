==Objectives==
Place the [[Aural Sequencer]]s in [[Desmotaeron]] to help [[Ve'nari]] eavesdrop on the inhabitants.
*Aural Sequencer Prime placed {{co|64.8|57.7|Maw||1}}
*Ethereal Cloak Used (Optional)
*Aural Sequencer Relay placed {{co|67.7|58.4|Maw||1}}
*Aural Sequencer Ground placed {{co|64.3|50.6|Maw||1}}

==Description==
[[File:Aural Sequencer Relay.jpg|thumb|Aural Sequencer Relay.]]
How fortuitous! You just happened to be transferred to a location in which I have a certain... interest. Place the aural sequencers I gave you and I will attempt to establish a functional signal.

Such a perilous location will require the utmost discretion. You will want to use your ethereal cloak to avoid being seen.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
[[File:Aural Sequencer Ground.jpg|thumb|Aural Sequencer Ground and golden feathers.]]
We do not yet have a good signal. Place the aural sequencers.

==Completion==
Perfect. Their secrets will soon be mine.

Pardon me. I meant to say "ours."

==Notes==
[[File:Projection of Ve'nari - Hearing Aid.jpg|thumb|The Projection of [[Ve'nari]] at the end of the quest.]]

On accept:
:{{text|say|Projection of Ve'nari|Look for discreet locations that are near creatures of interest... but not in plain sight of them.}}

Players gain a bonus ability:
:{{Abilities|Ethereal Cloak|Grants invisibility against most enemies. Some actions break the effect.|icon=spell_animamaw_debuff|notes=Instant|cd=15 sec|id=351849}}

Use the cloak to gain an untimed [[Invisibility]]-style buff. Steer clear of the soulseekers and dusksavages, which have truesight. Enter [[Desmotaeron]] itself, where the gates have opened and the Grave Chill debuff has lifted. Head in and look for the Aural Sequencer Prime and interact with it. Note that this will break the cloak's invisiblity, so be wary!
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Ah! I am receiving. The signal is very poor. Find a new location to relay.}}

The next sequencer is to the southeast, tucked under a platform:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Better, but still distorted. Try another placement at a lower elevation.}}

Follow the stairs down to the north. Walk past two Maldraxxi Defectors:
:{{text|say|Maldraxxi Defector|I thought Captain Tk'ahn was overseeing today's patrols.}}
:{{text|say|Maldraxxi Defector|The captain has been... reassigned.}}
:{{text|say|Maldraxxi Defector|Reassigned? Why? To where?}}
:{{text|say|Maldraxxi Defector|To the Body Banks. For asking too many questions.}}

Approach the final Aural Sequencer:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Interesting! Are those glittering objects... feathers?}}

Interact with it and Ve'nari's projection will appear to turn in the quest.

There are two [[Treasures of Korthia]] also in Desmotaeron, the [[Helsworn Chest]] and the [[Jeweled Heart of Ezekiel]]. Note that attempting to loot either will break the invisibility buff!
