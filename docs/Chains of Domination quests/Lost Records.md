==Objectives==
Use the Matrix Beacon to recover 3 Lost Recordings.
*Matrix beacon activated
*[[Cracked Record]] (3)
*[[Matrix Beacon]] (provided)

==Description==
[[File:Lost Records - Primus.jpg|thumb|The Primus again]]
Some of the record keepers fled to [[Hope's Ascent|this mountain]] when [[Korthia]] was pulled into the [[Maw]].

I see no sign of them, but they may have left records behind.

Take this beacon. I fashioned it using information from the previous record keepers you rescued.

It will lead you to any intact records that are on this mountain.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered the records?

==Completion==
Excellent...  I should be able to extract the Primus's message from these records.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Bone Tools]] before heading out.

Use the provided [[Matrix Beacon]], then follow the sonar pings to reveal hidden Cracked Records.

On complete:
:{{text|say|The Primus|...from reaching the Sepulcher. This must not come to pass.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|Even locking my sigil away here may not be enough to--}}

==Progression==
{{The Last Sigil}}
