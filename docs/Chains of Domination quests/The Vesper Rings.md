==Objectives==
[[File:Arso'un the Caged.jpg|thumb|[[Arso'un the Caged]]]]
Protect [[Polemarch Adrestes]] as he rededicates the [[Temple of Loyalty]].
*Adrestes defended

==Description==
Loyalty shall no longer be a demanded tenet of the Path, but rather something natural that is earned. A choice.

We must show devotion to those who struggle, whether they are recently deceased [[soul]]s or our peers who need our aid.

I must use all the [[anima]] I can to change the path of this temple, to ring in a new age for the [[kyrian]].

No doubt the [[Mawsworn]] have been notified of our plans. Protect me, <name>. We must see this through.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Ascended]]

==Progress==
<Adrestes cannot be distracted as he uses every ounce of himself for the task at hand.>

==Completion==
Devotion... it is born of compassion. Of service.

A worthy tenet indeed.

Speak with Adrestes again:
:The time for rededication has come. Are you prepared to protect this sacred ritual?

:{{gossip|I am ready.}}

:{{text|say|Fallen Disciple Nikolon|Uther and I shall aid Adrestes. The rest of you, stand strong!}}
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|My fellow kyrian, I come to you with a message of compassion.}}

A few waves of [[Mawsworn Proselytizer]]s and [[Mawsworn Reclaimer]]s fly in. Take them out:
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|Your plight has been heard, your suffering recognized. We ask not for your loyalty, but we offer a choice.}}
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|None shall be forced to sacrifice their memories. Your decision will be respected by all kyrian.}}

[[Arso'un the Caged]] flies in:
:{{text|say|Arso'un the Caged|The forsworn belong to Helya, to the Maw! No kyrian shall take them from us!}}

Take out the maw caster:
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|Let us stand united once more! Not out of loyalty, but devotion! A new path for Bastion begins!}}
