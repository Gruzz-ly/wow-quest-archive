==Objectives==
Salvage 50 anima-infused bones from wildlife
*[[Anima-Infused Bones]] (50)

==Description==
So the device we need to open this vault is stuck on a floating island, eh?

Not a problem.

I see plenty of sturdy creatures around here. Like I always say, no bone goes to waste!

Bring me a pile of their bones. I'll use them to craft hookshot points for us to use to grapple over there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Remember, I just need the bones. Flesh only gets in the way.

==Completion==
Yes, this will do. Think I'll save one to show the other smiths back home.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Bring me bones so I can make a hookshot and anchor points. We'll get across this chasm in no time!}}

Pick up [[Lost Records]] before heading out. Every hostile creature on [[Hope's Ascent]] counts, including [[Voracious Razorwing]]s, [[Razorwing Gnasher]]s, [[Shardhide Dominator]]s, [[Shardhide Mauler]]s, [[Shardhide Pulverizer]]s, and [[Shardhide Scraper]]s. Kill a path through them while following the sonar pings.
