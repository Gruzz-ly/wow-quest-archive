Ysera and the [[Maw Walker]] have gathered three [[Night Warrior]]s from across the [[Shadowlands]] in the [[Grove of Awakening]] of [[Ardenweald]] in an attempt to save [[Tyrande Whisperwind]] from [[Elune|Elune's]] power before it kills her.

==Completion==
It has been so long...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ysera|Our preparations are complete, Thiernax.}}
:{{text|say|Thiernax|It is time. Let us begin.}}

Speak with Ysera:
:I hope we are not too late for Tyrande.
:{{gossip|We're ready to begin the ritual.}}
:''The party runs forward. Moonberry is channeling into Thiernax, Lord Amalthwyn is channeling into Khaliiq, and Ysera is channeling into the Stonewright.''

[[File:The Power of Elune - ritual circle.jpg|thumb|The ritual circle next to Thiernax]]
A few yards to Thiernax's right is a circle on the ground. Stand in it to gain a bonus ability:
:{{Abilities|Assisting|icon=ability_nightfae_soulshape}}

Use it to start a 20-second channel:
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|I remember this power... a double-edged sword.}}
:{{text|say|The Stonewright|Seldom have I seen a mortal wield such rage.}}
:''Tyrande's voice echoes with Elune's power.''
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Elune! Arama sh'nala fasima nemelia boranna!}}
:{{text|say|Thiernax|Shandris, maintain your hold on her!}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Minn'do, please! You must calm yourself!}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Anu dorini ash'ka!}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|Tyrande, do not lose yourself to anger!}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Ash'al theradas!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|I don't think she's listening!}}
:{{text|say|The Stonewright|The Night Warrior's fury will annihilate us! Contain it!}}
:''Tyrande turns hostile and starts attacking Shandris.''
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|<Name>, aid me!}}

Help knock Tyrande out of her rage. Take cover with Shandris when Tyrande casts Convocation of Elune:
:{{Text|bossemote|Move to Shandris for safety from {{Text|#DD2222|[Convocation of Elune]}}}}

:{{Text|yell|Shandris Feathermoon|Incoming!}}

;At 47%
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|Her strength grows--it overwhelms her!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|That's not good!}}
:{{text|say|Thiernax|No! She is absorbing even more of Elune's power!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|That is really not good!}}
:{{text|yell|Tyrande Whisperwind|ASH ROHK ILISAR! THANDAE!}}

When she is brought to 15% health, a cutscene plays:
:''A burst from Tyrande staggers everyone in attendance. She lifts off of the ground, surrounded by power that pulsates like a heartbeat.''
:{{Text|say|Lady Moonberry|The force Tyrande wields threatens to consume her... and will leave this grove devastated!}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Moonberry|My Queen! We need your help!}}
:''A missile of power immediately flies into the grove, lands, and turns into the Winter Queen.''
:{{Text|say|Winter Queen|My sister's power... in my forest? I will have answers!}}
:''The queen gathers power around her, then creates a blinding explosion around Tyrande.''

This cutscene is immediately followed by the "By Our Hand" [[Shadowlands in-game cinematics|cinematic]]:

{{#ev:youtube|2ZD0Va77t5I|By Our Hand}}

''[[Ysera]] and [[Shandris Feathermoon]] shield themselves from the flash of [[Elune]] taking charge of [[Tyrande Whisperwind]], now floating ten feet off the ground face to face with the Winter Queen. The Winter Queen speaks with barely restrained rage in her voice.''

{{text|bossemote|Winter Queen|How dare you come here, sister, after our cries for aid went unheard, unanswered.}}

''Tyrande's eyes open, with what appear to be full moons taking the place of her pupils.''

{{text|bossemote|Elune's voice|I heard your cries, felt your pain,}}

''Elune averts her eyes for a moment.''

{{text|bossemote|Elune's voice|and in [[War of the Thorns|the wake of tragedy]], sent forth the cascade of [[soul]]s to sustain you.}} 

''Realizing, the Winter Queen's eyes widen a bit.''

{{text|bossemote|Winter Queen|Oh, the [[Teldrassil|Great Tree]]... All who perished there were claimed by the [[Maw]].}}

{{text|bossemote|Elune's voice|Then I have condemed my [[Night elf|favored children]].}}

''Elune closes her eyes and a single tear falls. The Winter Queen reaches out her left hand and catches the tear on her finger.''

{{text|bossemote|Winter Queen|By our hand, we may yet guide their souls unto their spring.}}

''The Winter Queen pulls Tyrande's hand, and the tear, into hers.''

{{text|bossemote|Winter Queen|Starting with this one.}}

{{text|bossemote|Elune's voice|Tyrande invoked me. She must choose. Vengeance or renewal?}}

''Elune tightens Tyrande's hand on the Winter Queen's as the tear grows larger and brighter. The tear brightens so much the area is overwhelmed by the light. As Ysera and Shandris regain vision, a fully formed [[The Sisters' Tear|Tear of Elune]] appears between the Winter Queen and Tyrande. Task complete, Tyrande's body stops floating and settles gently on the ground. Free of the Night Warrior tattoos, Tyrande opens her eyes and focuses on the Tear as the scene cuts to black.''

On the other side of the cinematic, Tyrande is now standing in the middle of the ritual circle and has recovered to 40% health. The other ritual participants are standing still around her, along with the Winter Queen. Turn in to the latter.
