==Objectives==
Recover Marks of Kel'Thuzad's favor and slay Drava'ora.
*[[Drava'ora]] slain {{co|72.5|30.5|Maldraxxus}}
*[[Token of Baron Kel'Thuzad's Favor|Tokens of Favor]] collected (10)

==Description==
There are those who held their affiliation with [[Kel'Thuzad]] secret even after [[The Traitor Unmasked|he made his move]]. They too were involved in the fall of [[Akarek|my Margrave]] and they too shall die.

I have one name, Drava'ora, but there are more. [[Margrave Sin'dane|Sin'dane]] had indicated these traitors carry marks of favor. She doesn't know who has them so we'll start killing until we find them.

The rest will see the example made.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
Those that remain will be scared into line.

==Completion==
Traitors cannot hide.

==Notes==
[[File:Drava'ora.jpg|thumb|Drava'ora]]
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|Baroness, did you know this "[[Tyrande Whisperwind]]" in life?}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|I know she is hard to kill. Focus on your mission, Khaliiq.}}
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|As you command.}}

Head northeast to the [[House of Rituals (subzone)|House of Rituals]], where Khaliiq shows up to accompany you and assist in combat:
:{{Abilities|Hunting with Khaliiq|id=350896|Hunting with Khaliiq.|icon=9xp_sigil_maldraxxus01}}

Upon killing a mob:
*{{Text|say|Khaliiq|A traitor's blood... so delicious...}}
*{{text|say|Khaliiq|Eternal silence awaits you.}}
*{{Text|say|Khaliiq|Vengeance for Akarek!}}

In addition, she'll make comments when brought to specific areas of the house. The southern part of the [[Reagentry]]:
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|All who betrayed Akarek will suffer. Night Warrior or not, I do not rest until the last foe is dead at my feet.}}

Northern part of the Reagentry:
:{{Text|say|Khaliiq|It seems Kel'Thuzad's minions continue his schemes even in his absence. We must slaughter them all.}}

The [[Prime Arcanum]]:
:{{Text|say|Khaliiq|Under Kel'Thuzad's command, these liches nearly eradicated the House of Eyes. A truth I will not forget.}}

The [[Grimoirium]]:
:{{Text|say|Khaliiq|In life, I became the Night Warrior to seek vengeance for my people. Much as I do now.}}

For this quest, basically everything hostile (or neutral, for Necrolords using their [[Illusory Guise]]) can drop a [[Token of Baron Kel'Thuzad's Favor]]. [[Drava'ora]] is inside the [[Hall of Ichor]].

Defeat the lich:
:{{text|say|Drava'ora|We will meet again.}}
