==Objectives==
Fly with [[Danica the Reclaimer|Danica]] to [[Odyn]]'s halls in [[Skyhold]].
*Speak with Danica
*Escape the [[Maw]]

==Description==
I mourn the loss of my sisters and desire nothing more than to avenge them. Yet I know that I am no match for [[Helya|the witch's]] magics or her army of [[Mawsworn]].

We must let wisdom guide us and fly from here. 

Though I am weak from my captivity, I have the strength to bear you from this place.

Let us go, friend.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
Welcome to Skyhold, <name>.

==Notes==
Speak with Danica:
:Keep courage in your heart. No matter the darkness you face, it will not falter.
:{{gossip|I'm ready! <Fly with Danica to Skyhold.>}}

A cutscene plays:
:''The Maw Walker walks to Danica, but suddenly a maw orb knocks the player back!''
:{{text|say|Helya|Did you really think you'd escaped my notice?}}
:{{text|say|Helya|So naive. So blind to Odyn's failings--}}
:{{text|say|Danica|Odyn will not stand for this!}}
:{{text|say|Danica|And neither shall I!}}
:{{text|say|Helya|Your defiance is meaningless. I already have what I need!}}
:''Helya sucks the soul out of a fallen val'kyr and moves it to a winged Mawsworn.''
:{{text|say|Skyja|The ritual nears completion...}}
:{{text|say|Skyja|[[Annhylde]] will soon rejoin her sisters.}}
:''Helya launches a projectile in the direction of Danica and the Maw Walker.''
:{{text|say|Helya|Now bear this message back to your master, little bird.}}
:''The Maw Walker cautiously walks over to the projectile &mdash; a scroll on the ground &mdash; and picks it up.''
:{{text|say|Helya|May it taste like ashes in his throat!}}
:{{text|say|Helya|Skyja! See them out.}}
:{{text|say|Danica|Hold tight, friend!}}
:''Danica grabs the Maw Walker and they fly out of Desmotaeron, Skyja and two other flying Mawsworn in hot pursuit.''

On the other side of the loading screen, she and the player land at [[Skyhold]].
:{{text|say|Danica the Reclaimer|I was uncertain that I'd ever set eyes upon the glory of Odyn's hall again, Maw Walker. My poor sisters...}}

A few different NPCs here have new gossip

Odyn
:You are welcome in my hall, <name>.

Master Smith Helgar
:Hail, <class>. What an interesting weapon you bear.
