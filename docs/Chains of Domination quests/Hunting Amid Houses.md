[[Ysera]] provides two versions of '''Hunting Amid Houses''', one for [[Night Fae Covenant]] players, and another for everyone else.

==Objectives==
;Night Fae
:Find [[Huln Highmountain]] in [[Maldraxxus]].
;Others
:Speak with Ysera to learn more, then find Huln Highmountain in the Sepulcher of Knowledge. 
*Speak to Ysera
*Huln Found in Maldraxxus {{co|42.8|25.1|Maldraxxus}}

==Description==
;Night Fae
:I have good news, <name>. With the covenants working more closely together, Huln's hunt has found greater success. He has solid leads on two more [[Night Warrior|night warriors]], here in the [[shadowlands]].
:He wishes for you to meet him in Maldraxxus about the first. Huln awaits you at the [[Sepulcher of Knowledge]].
:Hurry, <name>. [[Elune]]'s power rips at [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande]]'s essence. I do not know how much longer she can hold on.
;Others
:I have dreamed that Tyrande Whisperwind is crucial to the survival of Ardenweald.
:The night fae have been searching for others like her who were once night warriors. We have recruited an ancient ally of Azeroth, Huln Highmountain, in order to look for them. Elune's power is too much for any mortal to contain--even Tyrande. I do not know how much longer she can hold on.
:Allow me to explain further, then you must hurry to meet Huln in Maldraxxus. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}

==Progress==
Ardenweald appreciates your help.

==Completion==
;Night Fae
:My continuing hunt for more Night Warriors has brought me here, <name>. Together we will track them down and ask for their help.
;Others
:Word of your deeds has spread across the Shadowlands.
:I know together we will be able to find this Night Warrior swiftly.

==Notes==
Speak with Ysera again:
:I hope we are not too late for [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande]].

Night Fae players see the following gossip:

:{{gossip|Remind me about the hunt for more [[Night Warrior]]s.}}
:After your... [[What's My Motivation?|performance for the court]], we [[For Queen and Grove!|spoke of my fear]] for Tyrande Whisperwind. I believe she is important to Ardenweald's survival. Though my dreams are not clear on how, we have been looking for a way to save her life.
:We found an ally in [[Thiernax]], a Night Warrior from another world who had passed beyond the [[veil]]. He suggested we might be able to help Tyrande if others who'd held Elune's power came together and took on some of her burden.
:[[Huln Highmountain]], one of the [[Wild Hunt]]'s finest trackers, has been searching for these other Night Warriors within the realms of the [[Shadowlands]]. He has solid leads on two and awaits you in [[Maldraxxus]] with more information.
:Be swift, <name>. I fear Tyrande's time grows short.
:{{gossip|Right. I remember sending Huln out. I'll go find him now.}}

Non-Night Fae see different gossip:

:{{gossip|Ardenweald has asked for help finding former Night Warriors.}}
:My dreams here have shown me many things including the danger Tyrande Whisperwind is in, but also that she is important to Ardenweald's survival somehow.
:The Night Fae have been searching for former Night Warriors within the realms of the Shadowlands. We believe that others who held Elune's power may be able to take a portion of what Tyrande now holds, and save her from assured death. One, Thiernax, was here in Ardenweald and has been helping us.
:Huln Highmountain, a valiant warrior from Azeroth's past, now a keen tracker for the Wild Hunt, has been assisting us in searching for more of these former Night Warriors. He believes he has found two more. He awaits your assistance in Maldraxxus.
:Be swift. Tyrande's time grows short.
:{{gossip|I see. Thank you.}}

Immediately after flying to [[Ardenweald]], hop back on the flight path to get to [[Maldraxxus]]. The nearest flight path is [[Spider's Watch]]. During the questline, the Sepulcher of Knowledge is placed in a special phase where the surrounding swamp is completely empty of mobs. Huln is waiting outside the entrance to the tower. On approach:
:''Huln salutes.''
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|Ah! <name>. I have been expecting you.}}
