[[File:Misplaced Venthyr Tome.png|thumb|The Misplaced Venthyr Tome.]]
Pick up the book to return it.

==Description==
<A book appears to have been recently knocked off the table from the nearby [[Venthyr]] encampment.

The Venthyr would likely appreciate you returning it to them before one of the [[gromit]]s uses it for nesting material.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|57|40}}

==Completion==
<It appears you and [[Mal'Ganis|Mal'ganis]]{{sic}} are not done with one another. When you finally confront [[Zovaal|the Jailer]], you are certain the [[nathrezim|dreadlord]] will be there as well.>

==Notes==

:{{text|say|Mal'Ganis|You will pay the price for crossing me. But first, there are more important matters that demand my attention.}}
:{{text|say|Mal'Ganis|So enjoy this brief reprieve, <name>. It is the last you will ever know.}}
:''The projection disappears.''
