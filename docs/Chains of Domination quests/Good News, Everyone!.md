:{{text|say|Danica|Fortune or fate brought you to me, <name>. I do not know which.}}
:{{text|say|Danica|No matter. Together, we have battled a mighty foe. My sisters are avenged!}}
:{{text|say|Danica|Helya may still scheme and plot, but at least she has been deprived of the Eye.}}
:{{text|say|Danica|Odyn will be pleased. I expect your allies will rejoice as well. The Eye's absence will embolden their advance against the Jailer.}}
:{{text|say|Danica|You have my thanks for all you have done.}}
:{{text|say|Danica|Your deeds will be sung in Odyn's great Mead Hall. All will know of your steadfast courage!}}
