==Objectives==
Use [[Mawsworn Chains]] to kill 6 Helsworn Soulbreakers.
*[[Helsworn Soulbreaker]] slain (6)

==Description==
The skies are dark with [[Helya]]'s [[kyrian]] followers. If we do not thin their numbers, [[Zerekriss]] and our aerial allies may have difficulties pushing forward.

I've noticed that the Mawsworn often use magical chains. We could turn their equipment against them and tear them down from the sky.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==
We need to clear out the skies before we can begin the real assault.

==Completion==
Our foes will learn that even the skies are no longer safe for them.

==Notes==
After picking up [[Gates of the Damned]], Draka and Thrall will join the party, and each offer another quest.

While killing enemies for the other two quests, they will occasionally drop some [[Mawsworn Chains]]. Use them on the unfriendly (and thus unattackable) [[Helsworn Soulbreaker]]s flying above to pull them down to the ground and make them attackable. Soulbreakers made hostile by other players also count, as long as they haven't been tapped by the opposite faction.

==Progression==
{{An Army of Bone and Steel}}

==Patch changes==
