Collect the Sigils of Binding
*Sigils of Binding collected (8)
*Speak with [[Stoneborn Detainment Chief]] {{co|37.9|23.8|Revendreth}}

==Description==
[[File:Sigil of Binding.jpg|thumb|Sigil of Binding]]

<The [[nathrezim|dreadlord]] catches your eye, wishing to speak. You glance at your companions. [[Lady Moonberry|Moonberry]] urges you forward with a mischievous grin. You step as close as you dare.>

Free me from this prison, mortal, and you will have my favor. I am aligned with powers greater than these pathetic puppets or their masters. They have no concept of the true forces at work. 

All I need are the sigils of binding which hold me. The rest I can... take care of.

Free me, and you will be granted untold power.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
Hmmm.

==Completion==
If he got nicked, I know where they took 'im.

==Notes==
Get a bit away from Mal'Ganis:
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|We really helpin' him escape?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Of course not! We're just going to have a bit of fun.}}

Head up the stairs to the southwest and look for the Sigils of Binding. One is just lying on the ground...
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|So they just leave these lying around?}}
:{{text|say|Stoneborn Steelwing|What are you doing, muckborn?}}
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|Oh, Stonewright wants these kept safe, mate. Wouldn't want to make her angry, right? Eh?}}
:{{text|emote|The Stoneborn Guard shudders.}}
:{{text|say|Stoneborn Steelwing|Take them. Quickly.}}

Six or seven sigils are on the upper level. Jump down to the lower level to find the last:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Excellent! Now we tell that nice guard just how easy it was to collect these.}}
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|And they tell us where to find your bloke. You think like the [[Venthyr|fangs]], Miss Wings.}}

Return to the [[Stoneborn Detainment Chief]]:
:I'm busy. Can't you see I'm dealing with a dreadlord captive? Find something useful to do.
:{{gossip|That dreadlord tried to bribe me into freeing him. These Sigils of Binding weren't very secure.}}
:I-- By the Stonewright's chisel! She'd have turned me into rubble for letting him escape. Thank you!
:{{gossip|Have you seen anyone unusual being taken into custody?}}
:{{text|say|Stoneborn Detainment Chief|There was an incident on the wall, but the [[Stoneborn Honorguard]] brought it to an end.}}
:''Moonberry remembers her stone fiend voice, a bit too late.''
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Thank yo--uh, Thank you.}}
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|Crumble me. Looks like he went and got 'imself nicked by the big wings.}}

Turn in to Cudgelface.
