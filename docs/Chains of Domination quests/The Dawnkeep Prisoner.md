==Objectives==
Learn of [[Denathrius|Sire Denathrius]]' fate from [[Prince Renathal]].
*Speak with Prince Renathal

==Description==
Oh, you have not heard the news yet.

We have him. The Sire Denathrius, Master of Revendreth, imprisoned within [[Remornia|his own blade]].

We managed to best him during one of our recent raids of [[Castle Nathria]].

It took an army of unparalleled valor and preparation. It took skill and wealth. It took a miracle.

And so the redeemer shall be redeemed. Would you like to know more?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It may take ages upon ages, but we shall remind Denathrius of his purpose, and remind him how to be beautiful in his craft once again.

This place is strong with the [[Light]]. Few [[venthyr]] can tolerate such power for long without succumbing to it. A fitting place to teach uninterrupted.

==Notes==
This quest is only offered to players who have not completed [[Redemption for the Redeemer]]. If they have, Renathal will skip ahead to the next quest, [[Convoy of the Covenants]].
