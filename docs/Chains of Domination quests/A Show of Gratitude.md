'''A Show of Gratitude''' begins the "Focusing the Eye" chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Ve'nari]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Description==
Your presence here fulfils an ancient prophecy, [[Maw Walker]]. I am certain you and your allies will save us.

Perhaps I judged your [[broker]] friend too harshly. She did escort you to Korthia, after all. 

Please extend our thanks to Ve'nari, and let her know we are happy to answer her questions.

She... does seem to have quite a number of them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* +50 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Completion==
A thank-you is polite.

A favor is better.

==Progression==
{{Focusing the Eye}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}
