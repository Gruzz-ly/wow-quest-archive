'''Dreadlords!''' begins the sixth chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]], unlocked at [[:Renown]] 50. Find Vashj in the [[necrolord]] camp in the [[Keeper's Respite]] of [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
[[File:Dreadlords - Korthia.jpg|thumb|[[Vashj]] killing a [[Nathrezim Infiltrator]]]]
Speak with the [[Primus]] in [[Korthia]].

==Description==
[[Nathrezim Infiltrator|This]] is the fifth [[dreadlord]] I have found infiltrating our forces this week. Unchecked they can cause tremendous damage to our foothold here.

In life I learned how to identify these creatures from a [[demon hunter]]. It makes it far easier for me to locate them, but I cannot be in all places at once.

We must report these findings to the Primus.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
More dreadlords? I should have suspected the fangs of [[Denathrius]] would find their way here again.

I am pleased to know that despite their setbacks in my absence, the [[House of Eyes]] has not lost their sight.

==Notes==
Vashj starts the quest at her usual spot in the necrolord camp:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Champion! Quickly, we must stop the Primus before it is too late.}}
:''An arrow from offscreen pierces Vashj, who dies, revealing a Nathrezim Infiltrator! The real Vashj slithers up from behind.''
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Nathrezim scum. You cannot deceive the House of Eyes.}}

==Progression==
{{The Unseen Guests}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}
