==Objectives==
[[File:He Was My Student.jpg|thumb|Arthas and Uther in the Cathedral of Light]]
Aid [[Uther]] in reliving his second memory.
*Uther's memory entered
*Speak to Arthas
*Arthas Menethil defeated

==Description==
Uther's memories of this [[Arthas Menethil|Prince Arthas]] haunt him deeply. He is the reason Uther's soul was fragmented, why [[Devos]] fell the way she did.

The pain in these memories is palpable.

We have to dig deeper. Uther must face the source of this darkness.

Once again, you need to enter his past to protect his future.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Ascended]]

==Progress==
Uther needs our support.

==Completion==
The sting of betrayal haunts Uther deeply. But he can persevere.

He must!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Pelagos|We are here for you, Uther. Do not despair.}}
:{{text|say|Uther|The Light... Arthas... what have I done?}}

Back into the Soul Mirror to enter the [[Cathedral of Light]] in [[Stormwind City]]. While the events of the quest occur, the present-day Uther will sometimes speak offscreen to the kyrian near him in Bastion. In the transcript below, Uther's quotes are marked ''(Present)'' or ''(Past)'' to distinguish between this Uther and the one in the past.
:{{text|say|Uther the Lightbringer|Feeling nervous, Arthas?}} ''(Past)''
:{{text|say|Uther the Lightbringer|This is the day Arthas became a paladin. I remember it well...}} ''(Present)''
:{{text|say|Arthas Menethil|Honestly? Yes. I see your devotion to the Light and feel doubt cloud my heart.}}
:{{text|say|Arthas Menethil|You've taught me so much, Uther... but I sometimes wonder if I'm truly meant to walk this path.}}
:{{text|say|Uther the Lightbringer|Great expectations await you, lad. I have faith that you will exceed them all.}} ''(Past)''
:{{text|say|Uther the Lightbringer|But for now, let's spar. That should clear your mind.}}
:{{text|say|Arthas Menethil|Hah. It always does.}}

[[File:He Was My Student - ghosts.jpg|thumb|The ghosts of Tereneas Menethil, Gavinrad the Dire, and others]]
Start combat:
:{{text|say|Uther the Lightbringer|No... I should have listened to him. Why didn't I listen?}} ''(Present)''
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|You sought to comfort a troubled student. None can fault you for such an act.}}
:''A group of ghosts appear, circling the room, including [[Gavinrad the Dire]], [[Terenas Menethil]], some generic [[Silver Hand Paladin]]s, [[Stratholme Citizen]]s, and [[Andorhal Citizen]]s.''
:{{text|say|Uther the Lightbringer|Tell that to all of the innocents he slaughtered. I set him on that path!}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|You guided him on the path of justice. He is the one who strayed from it.}}
:{{text|say|Uther the Lightbringer|May the Light forgive me.}}

Knock Arthas down to 40% health, and Uther will be overcome by another Fugue State as the ghosts close in around him, ending the memory. Back at the Eonian Archives, Uther has recovered and is now standing upright with his previous gossip text back:
:This pain, deep in my soul... I am ready for it to end.

Turn in to [[Kleia]].
