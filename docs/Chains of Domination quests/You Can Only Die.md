==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Fal'zinge.jpg|Fal'zinge|Slay Fal'zinge.}}
Slay Fa'zinge{{Sic}} on the [[Exoramas]].
*[[Fal'zinge]] slain {{co|74.7|32.9|Maldraxxus}}

==Description==
The last name on my list is a [[lich]] named Fal'zinge.

[[Margrave Sin'dane|Sin'Dane]]{{Sic}} has been keeping a close eye on him to learn more of what [[Kel'Thuzad]] is planning next. 

She wishes for Fal'zinge's execution to be brutal. 

We will find him in the Exoramas in the House of Rituals.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
Another name for the list.

==Completion==
This can be the only end for traitors to Maldraxxus.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|Baroness, did you know this "[[Tyrande Whisperwind]]" in life?}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|I know she is hard to kill. Focus on your mission, Khaliiq.}}
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|As you command.}}

Save this quest for last, as the followup of these three picks up inside the [[necropolis]].

Head northeast to the [[House of Rituals (subzone)|House of Rituals]], where Khaliiq shows up to accompany you and assist in combat:
:{{Abilities|Hunting with Khaliiq|id=350896|Hunting with Khaliiq.|icon=9xp_sigil_maldraxxus01}}

Fly up into the necropolis, where Sin'dane is waiting and Fal'zinge is floating in a corner. There is a backup Gateway to Exoramas underneath, should players forget they can fly...

Aggro the lich:
:{{text|say|Fal'zinge|What--Margrave! Stop this treachery!}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Sin'dane|I was the one who summoned them, Fal'zinge. Now die.}}

Defeat the lich:
:{{text|say|Fal'zinge|Kel'Thuzad will return...}}
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|That traitor will get what he deserves as well.}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Sin'dane|He and all his filth will be expunged.}}

Players will need to use the Gateway to Surface near the entrance to actually exit the necropolis...
