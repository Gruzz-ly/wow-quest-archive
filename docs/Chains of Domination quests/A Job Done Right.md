*Mawsworn forces annihilated (0/100%)

==Description==
We should be clear to start the assault.

Signal the Zerekriss. Let us show them the might of a Maldraxxian [[necropolis]] and the combined armies of the [[Shadowlands]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==
Nothing can stand against the might of Maldraxxus!

==Completion==
We have our opening, it is time to push ahead.

==Notes==
Head to the marked location and interact with the beacon to trigger a cutscene showing the Zerekriss emerging from a giant portal in the sky.

After the cutscene, players enter the vehicle interface with a single fixed camera angle looking down from the Zerekriss' mouth onto the hordes of mobs in Desmotaeron below.
*{{Abilities|Necrotic Assault|Fire the Zerekriss's assault cannon, obliterating any enemies at the target location.|range=1000|cd=1.5 sec|notes=Instant|id=350508|icon=spell_necro_dischargenecroticcore}}
*{{Abilities|Return to the Front|End control of the Necropolis's weaponry and return to Desmotaeron.|id=350535|icon=spell_animamaldraxxus_buff}}
:{{text|say|Baron Vyraz|Our enemies advance! Show them no mercy!}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|The Mawsworn are assaulting our position. Eradicate them!}}

Use the assault ability to defeat all of the enemies on the ground. If Return to the Front is used, the player will need to interact with the Necropolis Beacon again and rewatch the cutscene in order to return to the vehicle.

At 33%:
:{{text|say|Helya|Tear that necropolis out of the sky! Drag it down!}}
:''Stygian Punishers spawn, and throw chains at the necropolis.''

At 66%, large numbers of generic covenant troops begin surging out of the four Death Gates:
:{{text|yell|Alexandros Mograine|Forward, Necrolords! Burn these traitors to ash!}}
:{{text|yell|Lord Herne|Wild Hunt, we ride to battle!}}
:{{text|yell|Kleia|Take to the skies! Our allies are counting on us!}}
:{{text|yell|Prince Renathal|Come, let us show them the might of Revendreth!}}

At 100%, the player automatically exists the necropolis and returns to Draka and Thrall on the ground. At this point Desmotaeron has become engulfed in chaos, with generic covenant forces fighting the Helsworn both in the sky and on the ground while the Zerekriss continues firing at the area. Scattered among the fighters are a few familiar faces, namely [[Emeni]], [[Nadjia the Mistblade|Nadjia]], [[Plague Deviser Marileth|Marileth]], [[Kevin]], and [[Alexandros Mograine|Alexandros]] on his [[tauralus]].
