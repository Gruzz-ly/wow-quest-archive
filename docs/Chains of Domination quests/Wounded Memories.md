==Objectives==
[[File:Wounded Memories.jpg|thumb|Uther and the Remnant of Justice]]

Help [[Uther]] forge a connection to the Remnant of Justice.
*[[Remnant of Justice]] placed {{co|40.2|20.4|Bastion}}

==Description==
The arrival of Uther's wounded soul was the impetus for many events that led us to our current struggles.

[[Devos]]'s broken trust. Her involvement with [[Helya]]. The rise of the [[Forsworn]].

[[Bastion]] needs to change, but we struggle to find a solution.

Perhaps this soul fragment will provide valuable insight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|87}}
* 4,100 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Ascended]]

==Progress==
I have never seen a soul torn as Uther's has been.

==Completion==
Though Uther's soul is suffering, we must not lose hope.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Uther|If my soul can be mended, then so too can the rift with the Forsworn...}}

Several NPCs have gossip here:
;Adrestes
:We cannot stand by any longer. The time to act is now.
;Kleia
:The winds of change have arrived.
;Uther
:This pain, deep in my soul... I am ready for it to end.

Uther is staring at the ghost Remannt of Justice object. Place it, and a cutscene plays:
:{{text|say|Thenios|Be warned, Uther. We have never attempted anything of this nature before.}}
:{{text|say|Uther|I will endure whatever I must to be whole again.}}
:''Uther faces the shard and channels anima into it. Energy bursts start jumping out of the crystal. One strikes Uther and causes him to stagger.''
:{{text|say|Uther|I... I cannot...}}
:{{text|say|Kleia|The shard--it is too much! He is being overwhelmed!}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|We must help him! Friends, aid me!}}
:''Kleia, Pelagos and the Maw Walker all channel anima into Uther.''
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|Uther, hold strong! Allow your memories to flow through you!}}
:''Uther shoots a large pulse of anima towards the crystal, which then pulses back with more energy, knocking him to the ground.''
:{{text|say|Uther|<Agonized scream.>}}
:''Uther gets back on his feet and looks at the Remnant of Justice, which is now accompanied by a spectral image of how he appeared in life.''

On the other side of the cutscene, Uther has fallen to his knees yet again and bursts of energy are periodically shooting into him. He has new gossip text reflecting this:
:<Uther's breathing is labored, straining against the pain.>
