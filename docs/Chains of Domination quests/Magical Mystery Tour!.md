==Objectives==
[[File:Urgent Message from Ardenweald.jpg|thumb|Urgent Message from Ardenweald]]
Find [[Lady Moonberry]] in [[Revendreth]].

==Description==
<Lady Moonberry's voice rises from the scroll.>

<Name>! It seems [[Huln Highmountain|Huln]] got into some trouble. And--well--it's complicated. We could really use your help in Revendreth! Please meet me at [[Dominance Keep]].

See you soon!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|57|40}}

==Completion==
[[File:Moonbery and Cudgelface.jpg|thumb|[[Lady Moonberry]] and [[Cudgelface]]]]

I'm glad you could get here so quickly! We've run into a little bit of a hiccup.

==Notes and trivia==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|We will reconvene in Ardenweald, <name>. Do not tarry.}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Sin'dane|Even now we contend with Kel'Thuzad's schemes. What else has he set in motion?}}

No shortcuts, as usual, so hoof it to Revendreth, as always. Take the flight path to [[Dominance Keep]], where [[Lady Moonberry]] awaits.

On approach:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|<Name>! Down here!}}

Find her behind the flight path, next to [[Cudgelface]].
