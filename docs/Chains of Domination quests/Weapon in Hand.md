==Objectives==
Find [[Thrall]]'s axe, [[Dra'gora]].
*[[Dra'gora (item)]] {{co|61.9|56.4|Maw||1}}

==Description==
A moment, <name>.

I threw my axe Dra'gora at [[Helya]] during [[By and Down the River|our first encounter]] in the [[Maw]], and I haven't seen it since. If this is truly where she commands her forces, then perhaps it's held here.

I crafted that weapon in [[Nagrand]], and it reminds me of many good days spent beside my family there. I want to feel its weight in my hands once again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Progress==
I threw my axe in the heat of the moment...

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I feared my axe was lost forever.

==Notes==
After picking up [[Gates of the Damned]], Draka and Thrall will join the party, and each offer another quest.

Head to {{co|61.9|56.4|Maw}}, where [[Weaponmaster Hyrev]] stands watch. Loot Dra'gora from his corpse:
:{{text|say|Thrall|Dra'gora. It's good to have it in hand again.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|"Draenor's Honor". A fitting name for a worthy weapon.}}

==Progression==
{{An Army of Bone and Steel}}
