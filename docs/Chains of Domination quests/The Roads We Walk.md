'''The Roads We Walk''' concludes the Necrolords addendum to the fifth chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]], "An Army of Bone and Steel". The sixth chapter of nine begins at [[:Renown]] 50 with [[Baroness Vashj]] at the [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]] starting [[Dreadlords!]].

==Objectives==
Witness Draka's promotion ceremony.
*Watch the Ceremony

==Description==
The armies of [[Maldraxxus]] are strong. They will recover from [[Vyraz]]'s transgression.

You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you speak with each of our leaders? The army has much to celebrate.

==Completion==
We must all move forward. The [[Shadowlands]] relies on our strength.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|yell|The Primus|Soldiers of Maldraxxus, hear me.}}
:{{text|yell|The Primus|We have purged the traitors from our ranks. Now, we must restore our lost honor.}}
:{{text|yell|The Primus|Draka of the Chosen--step forward!}}
:''Draka approaches the bottom of the stairs leading up to the platform and kneels down.''
:{{text|yell|The Primus|Maldraxxi! This warrior has proven herself time and again. From now until her final battle, I name her Margrave of the Chosen!}}
:{{text|yell|The Primus|Rise, Draka, and lead your house to victory.}}
:''Draka returns to her old spot.''

Speak with Baroness Vashj:
:Long has it been since I've had the opportunity to participate in such an assault. I forgot how exhilarating it was.
:With the Primus returned, I look forward to the increase in these activities.
:{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|Draka may lead the Chosen, my lady, but you have my loyalty. I am certain the Primus shall soon restore the House of Eyes with you as its margrave!}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|The path of one who has turned her back on our house is of no concern to us. My title will be earned through relentlessness and guile, as is our way.}}
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|Of course, Baroness. I will be proud to stand at your side.}}

[[File:Mograine and the Forsworn.jpg|thumb|Alexandros Mograine with the kyrian and Forsworn]]
Speak with Alexandros Mograine:
:The rot that plagued Maldraxxus has been excised. It has been a challenge, but we will rebuild.
:First though, there are other lands in need of more immediate assistance. It goes against my honor to ignore such issues.

[[File:Draka and Thrall.jpg|thumb|Thrall and Margrave Draka]]
Speak with Margrave Draka:
:There has not been a Margrave named since the Primus disappeared. This is an honor I was not expecting.
:I will carry the legacy of Krexus and Akarek.
:{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Margrave. A title that comes with authority and expectations--much like Warchief.}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Draka|I am no stranger to leadership. This is but another challenge to be conquered. Maldraxxus expects no less.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|I know firsthand the trials that come with such power. It can be a heavy burden to carry.}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Draka|The path ahead will have many perils. I will need to rely upon my allies to find victory. Perhaps a similar road lies ahead of you, my son.}}

After the quest has been completed, the Seat remains in its phased state until the player leaves and re-enters, at which point everything will return to its pre-9.1 state (including the return of the Primus' statue and Draka still being called "Baroness"). However, Draka will from now on be called "Margrave Draka" in her appearance in Keeper's Respite.

==Progression==
{{An Army of Bone and Steel}}
