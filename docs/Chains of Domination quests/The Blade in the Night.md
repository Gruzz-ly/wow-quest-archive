==Description==
Though my hunt has been arduous, I have two promising leads on additional [[Night Warrior]]s. The first is here in [[Maldraxxus]].

This tower contains records of those who arrived in Maldraxxus, including someone referred to as "The Blade in the Night." I believe this to be our next Night Warrior.

I encountered many traps on the way here. Doubtless we will find more within the tower. Someone is trying to stop us.

We will not let them succeed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}

==Progress==
Hmm.

==Completion==
I am not opposed to helping you, but... There are matters I must attend to first.

==Notes==
[[File:Record of War.jpg|thumb|Record of War]]

On accept:
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|My expertise is in reading tracks, not tomes. Let us see what we can learn of our quarry.}}

Huln starts accompanying the player:
:{{Abilities|Hunting with Huln|id=353172|Hunting with Huln.|icon=achievement_alliedrace_highmountaintauren}}

During this phase, most of the tower's normal traps will be disabled, except for the roaming [[Tome of War]] mobs. Look for [[Record of War]] books scattered about. If unlucky, a Tome of War will hop out and attack, or the book will explode in a trap, and deal a significant amount of damage.

Huln will chime in for failures:
*{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|Not even I could have seen that one.}}
*{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|We chose... poorly.}}
*{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|Someone does not wish to be found.}}
*{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|A trap, as expected. Be wary, <name>.}}
*{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|Another trap. Hmm.}}

Find the correct one:
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|Remnants of a spider's web surround the book...}}

Head upstairs to the second floor, then rinse and repeat:
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|Hmm. Note the claw marks on the tome's cover...}}

On the third floor, the correct book will trigger an Acid-Trapped Tome of War:
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|It seems our quarry is fond of acids and poisons...}}

[[File:The Blade in the Night.jpg|thumb|Khaliiq and Huln]]
On the top floor, a single Record of War is sitting on the altar:
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|Clearly, we pursue a spy from the House of Eyes.}}
:''A stealthed Khaliiq appears in the corner of the room and walks up to Huln.''
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|Indeed you do. And you will tell me why.}}

Speak with Khaliiq:
:I do as my baroness commands.

Night Fae players see the following gossip option:
:{{gossip|We are looking for a former Night Warrior. We believe it will help us.}}

Non-Night Fae instead see:
:{{gossip|Ardenweald has asked for help finding former Night Warriors.}}

Either way, it triggers the following dialogue:
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|Tyrande Whisperwind, a Night Warrior from my world, is in dire peril.}}
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|<Name> tasked me with finding former Night Warriors to aid her.}} ''(Night Fae)'' / {{text|say|Huln Highmountain|We require former Night Warriors to join us in a ritual to aid her.}} ''(Non-Night Fae)''
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|To spare her a grisly death, you mean.}}
:{{text|say|Khaliiq|As we are allies, I will assist you. But not before my current mission is complete.}}
