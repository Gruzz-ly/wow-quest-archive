'''Winter's Sigil''' concludes the seventh chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]], "The Power of Night", though there is a breadcrumb back to [[Korthia]] next. The penultimate chapter begins back at [[Keeper's Respite]] in Korthia at [[Renown (Shadowlands)]] 56, with [[Thenios]] offering [[A Paladin's Soul]].

==Description==
[[Elune|My sister]]... After all this time... She did not abandon me...

==Completion==
<Ysera sighs, relieved.>

Such peace has returned to [[Ardenweald]] and to those who dwell within. My dear friend has been saved. I do not know what comes next, but I have hope.

This could not have been done without your help, <name>. Thank you.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''The Winter Queen teleports away.''
:{{Text|say|[[Shandris Feathermoon]]|Mother... Is it you?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Tyrande Whisperwind]]|I am myself again.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|What I have seen this day, I can scarcely believe.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|I was present for every moment, and yet... outside myself. As much a witness as you were.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|So much beauty in her voice. And sorrow as well. The tear...}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Was mine as much as hers.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|The Winter Queen spoke of a purpose for the souls of our people. What did she mean?}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|That, [[Elune]] did not tell me, daughter. Not yet.}}

As the Winter Queen teleports away, the Sisters' Tear appears in her place. Pick it up, then return to the Heart of the Forest and speak with Ysera:
:<Ysera smiles warmly at you.>
:{{gossip|<Hand the Sister's{{Sic}} Tear to Ysera.>}}

A cutscene plays.
:''The Winter Queen, [[Khaliiq]], [[the Stonewright]], [[Thiernax]], [[Lady Moonberry|Moonberry]], the [[Maw Walker]], Ysera, Tyrande, and Shandris stand gathered in front of the withered Heart of the Forest.''
:{{Text|say|Winter Queen|Through drought and loss, Ardenweald suffered.}}
:{{Text|say|Winter Queen|But together, we have saved our home from a terrible darkness.}}
:{{Text|say|Winter Queen|With perseverance and kinship, hope is restored to our groves.}}
:''The Queen begins channeling energy into the Heart. Moonberry, Ysera, Thiernax (and the Maw Walker if they're a [[Night Fae Covenant|Night Fae]]) assist her.''
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|And our hearts as well.}}
:''As the Queen and her servants finish their spell, the Heart is restored to its original form, sprouting new branches that reach for the ceiling.''
:{{Text|say|Winter Queen|Today, the forest's heart is made whole.}}
:''Night fae gather on the upper floors to watch the spectacle.''
:{{Text|say|Winter Queen|The cycle is renewed. [[Death]] and [[Life]] in harmony once more.}}
:''The [[sigil]] of the night fae appears in front of the Heart.''
:{{Text|say|Winter Queen|A new sigil arises to embody our covenant's future.}}
:''She turns to the Maw Walker.''
:{{Text|say|Winter Queen|My <Hunter/Huntress>, you have done well. You have the thanks of all Ardenweald.}} ''(Night Fae)'' / {{Text|say|For all you have done, <name>, you have my thanks.}} ''(Non-Night Fae)''

On the other side, speak with Ysera again to turn in.

After completing this quest, Night Fae Covenant players can head into the Heart proper and check in with [[Astarii Starseeker]]:
:{{gossip|<Stay a while and listen.>}}
:''Tyrande Whisperwind walks up from the eastern entrance, taking about 5 seconds or so.''
:{{Text|say|Astarii Starseeker|High Priestess! Even in the depths of the Maw, I could feel your presence. I knew you would not abandon us.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Thank you, child... but I nearly did. I was so consumed by the fires of vengeance that I was blind to the ashes at our feet.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|I see now that while many of our people desire retribution, what we need most is renewal.}}
:{{Text|say|Astarii Starseeker|As the new moon gives way to the full, as darkness recedes in the light.}}
:{{Text|say|Astarii Starseeker|Be it as the [[Night Warrior]] or the High Priestess, I have faith in your leadership of the [[kaldorei]].}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Then I shall endeavor to be worthy of it. Watch over us from the boughs, Astarii. [[Darnassian#Darnassian primer (official translations)|Elune-adore]].}}
:{{Text|emote|The Winter Queen listens quietly.}}
:''Tyrande walks away.''

In addition, Tyrande has new gossip:
:When I first became the Night Warrior, it was with full knowledge that I might very well sacrifice my life to attain justice for the kaldorei. Such is often the fate of those who channel Elune's unmitigated fury.
:The power of the goddess still flows through me, but no longer does it threaten to tear me asunder. I cannot say how I will wield it in the future... only that I must do so for the good of my people.

{{tracking quest|64350|Astarii's <Stay a while and listen.> gossip option was used the first time}}

[[Ysera]] has new gossip:
:{{gossip|What's next for you?}}
:I am uncertain, <name>. Once, I was bound only to the Dream. Now I am also tethered to this realm by powers I do not fully comprehend.
:The Winter Queen gave of her own essence to save me, and I will repay her kindness as best I can. Yet beyond that, I can only wonder when I might return to family in Azeroth... if indeed such a reunion can ever come to pass.
:(Ysera smiles at you.)
:But thanks to you, I have hope. Not only have you helped to restore Ardenweald, but you saved my beloved Tyrande from a rage that nearly consumed her.
:The future may be uncertain, and the Jailer threatens all we hold dear. But whatever comes, I know you will face it with courage.

As does [[Thiernax]]:
:Strangely, it felt good. I remembered the peace I had always felt in her presence, the soothing calm she gave me as we faced the Dark God. I remember standing by the other champions as we fought that last desperate battle. How Elune's strength allowed me to heal my allies and then lay waste to the dark minions. How the stars above heeded my call, and the beauty of her power as it burned away the evil which had killed so many of my people. The grim satisfaction as I used her light to cleanse my world.
:But more... I remembered her love for me and the bittersweet sorrow she felt when I asked for her dark powers.
:I think she knew that I would end up here and that I would heal.
:Thank you, <name>. This has brought me closure I needed.
