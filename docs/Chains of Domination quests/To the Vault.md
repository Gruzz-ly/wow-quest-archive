==Objectives==
Take a [[Flayedwing Transporter]] to the [[Vault of Secrets]]
*Flayedwing ridden to the Korthian Vault {{co|47.2|39.9|Korthia}}

==Description==
[[File:To the Vault - forward party.jpg|thumb|The forward party]]
Thanks to [[Bonesmith Heirmir|the Bonesmith's]] repairs of both conduits, [[anima]] should now be flowing to the vault. That gives us a chance to get inside--assuming we can reach it.

Our Maldraxxi allies have wrangled transportation to get us to and from the vault. I suggest we make haste.

If [[the Jailer]]'s [[Mawsworn|minions]] obtain the sigil of the [[Primus]] before we do, it won't just be [[Korthia]] that suffers. All the [[Shadowlands]] may be forfeit.

Let's go, [[Maw Walker]]. Our forces will be awaiting us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Completion==
[[Tal-Galan]] informed me of the situation.

We must get you into that vault.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|The covenant forces are still defending the vault against the Mawsworn, but we must hurry.}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|We've got a flayedwing tethered nearby for you, Maw Walker. That will get you right to the forward camp outside the vault.}}

Head to the marked location at the unnamed crossroads north of the [[Seeker's Quorum]]. Note that this is not the usual location of the [[Flayedwing Transporter]], which is normally at the Necrolord camp at [[Keeper's Respite]].

Get to the [[Vault of Secrets]] and catch up with [[Protector Kah-Rev]]:
:{{text|say|Protector Kah-Rev|Reinforcements! Just in time. We are about to push toward the vault.}}

==Progression==
{{The Last Sigil}}

==Patch changes==
