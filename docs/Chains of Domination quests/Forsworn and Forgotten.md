[[File:Forsworn and Forgotten.jpg|thumb|A Helsworn Dominator and a Forsworn Prisoner]]

==Objectives==
Free 5 [[Forsworn]] Prisoners.
*[[Forsworn Prisoner]]s released (5)

==Description==
[[File:Forsworn Prisoner.jpg|thumb|[[Forsworn Prisoner]]]]
Wait... I know you! The [[Maw Walker]]!

My brothers and sisters have been twisted--tainted. Some took power willingly from [[Helya]], but others resisted. Now all of us are being forced to submit to her power.

I escaped when the fighting started, but most of the Forsworn remaining are being subjected to horrific rituals.

Please, I beg you to free them. Then we will return to [[Bastion]] and submit to [[Kyrestia the Firstborne|the Archon's]] judgment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Undying Army|The Undying Army]]

==Completion==
<You see the surviving Forsworn make their way to Zerekriss.

No doubt Nikolon will ensure they return to Bastion safely.>

==Notes==
After picking up [[What Maldraxxus Does Best]], run into [[Helgarde Keep]], where [[Fallen Disciple Nikolon]] lies broken on the ground:
:{{text|say|Fallen Disciple Nikolon|Maldraxxi? Here?}}

He starts this quest.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Fallen Disciple Nikolon|I will make for the necropolis. Please, save my brethren.}}
:''Nikolon flies away.''

[[Forsworn Prisoner]]s lie on the ground all throughout [[Helgarde Keep]] being worked on by [[Helsworn Dominator]]s. Take out the dominator, then interact with the prisoner. Many of them will fly away, but occasionally one will turn hostile and become a Converted Forsworn. Either way, it counts.

==Progression==
{{An Army of Bone and Steel}}
