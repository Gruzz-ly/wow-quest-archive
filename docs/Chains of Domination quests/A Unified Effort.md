'''A Unified Effort''' is a breadcrumb to the [[Chains of Domination campaign#Covenant assaults|covenant assaults]] in the [[Maw]]. It is not required to continue the storyline, which instead continues with [[Vault of Secrets (quest)]] from [[Tal-Galan]].

==Objectives==
Aid the covenants in assaulting [[the Jailer]]'s [[Mawsworn|forces]] in the [[Maw]].
*Aid a Covenant Assault

==Description==
You have made strong allies within your covenant as well as the others within the [[Shadowlands]]. This bond is why they have decided to loan aid to our cause.

They are ready to fight alongside us as we begin our advance into the Maw.

Each covenant will strike at the Jailer from a different area. Help them scour [[Korthia|this treacherous land]] for any who serve Zovaal so that we may put an end to his growing influence.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]

How fare our efforts?

==Completion==
Do not relent, <name>. This is only the first of many battles to come.

==Notes==

*[[Kyrian Assault]] ([[Zovaal's Cauldron]])
*[[Necrolord Assault]] ([[Perdition Hold]])
*[[Night Fae Assault]] ([[Crucible of the Damned]])
*[[Venthyr Assault]] ([[Tremaculum]])

Two assaults run each week. Complete the active assault and return to Bolvar.
