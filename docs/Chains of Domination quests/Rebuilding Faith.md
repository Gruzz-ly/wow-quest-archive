==Objectives==
Convince 10 [[Forsworn]] to return to the Path.
*Forsworn convinced (10)

==Description==
The Forsworn are lost, <name>.

They are like ghosts, haunting the [[Temple of Loyalty]]. Nowhere else to go. Leaderless, purposeless, abandoned.

We must show them that there is a path forward.

Let me accompany you into the temple. Allow me to talk to them, speak to their sensibilities. Perhaps we can convince them to give [[Polemarch Adrestes|Adrestes]]'s new path a chance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Ascended]]

==Progress==
The Forsworn may have abandoned the Path, but we had good reason.

==Completion==
It will take time and communication to repair the trust that has been lost, <name>... but there is hope again.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Kleia|Join us at the vesper when you are ready. Good luck, friends.}}
:''Kleia and Adrestes fly off, leaving Uther and Nikolon with the player.''

Head up the steps:
:{{text|say|Uther|Nikolon, I apologize for leading you off the path. Had I not, you might never have joined the Forsworn.}}
:{{text|say|Fallen Disciple Nikolon|My faith in the Archon was already lost. You only helped me accept the truth.}}
:{{text|say|Uther|Nevertheless, you suffered greatly because of my actions. I will not allow that to happen again.}}

Attack any humanoid forsworn, and Uther or Nikolon will plead their case:
*{{text|say|Adrestes has introduced a new path for the kyrian, one of compassion. Return with us. Let us heal our wounds together.}}
*{{text|say|A new path comes. Join us in building a new Bastion, a path with choice.}}
*{{text|say|A new path comes. Together we will make a new Bastion where choices are respected.}}
*{{text|say|A new path for the kyrian is beginning. Join us, and let your voice be heard.}}
*{{text|say|A new path for the kyrian is beginning. Let your voice be heard!}}
*{{text|say|No longer shall we be forced to forget. The future of Bastion lies in individual choice!}}
*{{text|say|No longer will we be cast aside. Join us in forging a new path!}}
*{{text|say|The Archon has agreed that blind loyalty is not the answer. Our future involves compassion, choice.}}
*{{text|say|The Archon now understands the error of her ways, and the future of Bastion is changing. Join me in returning to the path.}}
*{{text|say|The Archon offers not punishment, not force, but a guiding hand. Allow us, kyrian and forsworn alike, to heal together.}}
*{{text|say|The Archon understands that Bastion must change. Join me in returning to the path!}}
*{{text|say|The future is bright for all kyrian. Join us in forging a new path we can all be proud of.}}
*{{text|say|Though we were once cast aside, seen as failures... no longer is that true. Join us in forging a new path.}}
*{{text|say|Your past made you worthy of becoming a kyrian. From now on, we shall choose what memories we shall remember, and which we want to forget.}}

Get them to 50% and... they may join:
*{{text|say|For the path to improve, the Forsworn must take their seat at the table.}}
*{{text|say|I could feel the tendrils of the Mawsworn's influence invading the Forsworn... I shall return.}}
*{{text|say|I do not want to be the problem anymore... I want to be part of the solution.}}
*{{text|say|If you swear that things will change, Nikolon, I will trust you.}}
*{{text|say|I... I am willing to give the Archon and the Polemarch a chance to change.}}

Or they won't:
*{{text|say|Forget it. You have been blinded by them once more!}}
*{{text|say|I'd rather throw my lot in with the Mawsworn than trust the Archon again!}}
*{{text|say|I will never trust the Path or the Archon again!}}
*{{text|say|There is no longer a place for me in Bastion.}}
*{{text|say|Your words are hollow. I cannot be swayed!}}

==Progression==
{{A New Path}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}
