==Objectives==
[[File:Dread Tidings.jpg|thumb|Vashj and Kael in Sinfall]]
Speak with [[Prince Renathal]] at [[Dawnkeep]] in [[Revendreth]].
*Meet [[Vashj|Baroness Vashj]] at [[Sinfall]] {{co|29.5|41.7|Revendreth}}
*Use the mirror to reach the Dawnkeep {{co|26.0|43.9|Revendreth}}
*Speak with Prince Renathal at Dawnkeep.
*[[The Unseen Guests Among Us]] (provided)

==Description==
The threat the [[nathrezim]] pose to our forces must not be underestimated. They are cunning, rivaling the best veterans of the [[House of Eyes]], and we do not know their full plan.

Among the [[venthyr]] there is [[The Stonewright|one whose wrath scourged the nathrezim]] from the [[Shadowlands]] for many thousands of years. 

I ask you travel to Sinfall, seek out Prince Renathal, and deliver to him this missive. I shall send one of my own spies, the Baroness Vashj, to meet you there. Make use of her experience with the nathrezim.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Dread tidings indeed.

==Completion==
The nathrezim have returned? I dared not imagine they would ever grow so bold again.

A shame they have not learned in their exile, and return to us as enemies instead of family.

==Notes==
Thankfully the [[Waystone to Oribos (Korthia)|Waystone to Oribos]] is right there, and [[Pathscribe Roh-Avonavi]] is just across the [[Ring of Transference]]. [[Venthyr Covenant]] players can fly to [[Sinfall]] directly. The [[Sanctuary of the Mad]] is the closest flight point for other covenants.

Vashj is standing on the surface of Sinfall alongside [[Khaliiq]] and two [[Hand of Vashj|Hands of Vashj]] and catching up with an old acquaintance:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Ah, Kael'thas. I see the Accuser has let you out of your cage.}}
:{{text|say|Kael'thas Sunstrider|I am no pet to be commanded. You would do well to remember that.}}

Speak with Vashj:
:I have been in Revendreth for less than five minutes and the Accuser has tried to get me to "atone" three times already.
:It would amuse me if the Primus had not warned me how dangerous she is in this place. It almost makes me feel sorry for Kael'thas.
:{{gossip|Prince Renathal is assembling a diplomatic envoy to the Stonewright.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|We are here to hunt and destroy dreadlords. Try not to join them this time.}}

Head to the mirror behind [[Spire of the Unseen Guests|the tower]] to the [[Dawnkeep]] across the way, and check in with Renathal:
:It will take time. Time the likes of which your kind have yet to measure. 
:But in that time, I see my oldest friend, my closest confidant, and my greatest Master stepping forth from this pinnacle of lecture, his true purpose once again affirmed.
:{{gossip|What happened?}}
:''The [[Redemption for the Redeemer]] in-game cinematic plays.''

Renathal will offer one of two quests next: [[The Dawnkeep Prisoner]] for players who have not defeated [[Sire Denathrius (tactics)|Sire Denathrius]] in [[Castle Nathria]], or he will skip ahead to [[Convoy of the Covenants]] for players who have defeated Denathrius.

==Progression==
{{The Unseen Guests}}

==PTR version==
{{Rfptr-section}}
In an earlier version of the quest, Vashj was seen talking to [[the Accuser]] instead of Kael'thas when the player arrived to Sinfall:

:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|Ah, Kael'thas. I see the Accuser has let you out of your cage.}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|The fact that you were not sent to us before Maldraxxus was clearly an oversight. Baroness, I must insist we get you a sinstone at once.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|My ambition earned me a place in Maldraxxus, Accuser. You would do well to remember this.}}

The dialogue triggered by the "Prince Renathal is assembling a diplomatic envoy" option included an additional line:
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|I need one of the souls from Revendreth's arsenal: Kael'thas Sunstrider. He and I have worked together against nathrezim in the past. See he is included in the envoy.}}
