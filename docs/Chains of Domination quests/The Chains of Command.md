'''The Chains of Command''' begins "An Army of Bone and Steel", the fifth chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]], unlocked at [[:Renown]] 47.

==Objectives==
Meet [[Draka]] near [[Desmotaeron]].

==Description==
If we wish to hold a position so near to [[the Jailer]]'s lands, we need to provide some assurances.

[[Vyraz]] and [[Helya]] have retreated within the walls of Desmotaeron. They have grown lax in their expected safety, which provides us with an opportunity.

We will take them by surprise. Strike swiftly and without mercy, and perhaps we can cut the heads off these snakes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
They haven't noticed us yet. That won't stay true for long.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|[[Vyraz]] hides within [[Desmotaeron]]. We will secure the area and summon the [[Zerekriss]].}}
:''Thrall exits the Waystone to Oribos and walks up.''
:{{text|say|Thrall|Draka. <Name>. I'd like to join you on your mission.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Draka|You are the one they call [[Thrall]], yes? I have heard of you. Come, then.}}
:''The two pause for a moment, then walk northwest toward the Maw.''

The fastest way there is to just run north out of [[Korthia]] into the [[Beastwarrens]].
