'''Covenants Renewed''' is the third and last quest in the final chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]], "What Lies Ahead", at [[:Renown]] 58.

==Objectives==
Speak to the [[Primus]], then claim the [[Sigil]]s from each [[covenant]].
*Speak to the Primus{{co|63.0|25.4|Korthia}}
*Sigils claimed (4)
*Present sigils to the Primus

==Description==
Our efforts were focused on preventing [[Zovaal|the Jailer]] from shattering the barrier around the [[Maw]] and invading the rest of the [[Shadowlands]].

Instead, he expanded the Maw itself to envelop [[Oribos]] and claim the [[Arbiter|Aribiter]]'s{{Sic}} sigil.

I do not fully understand what we witnessed atop [[Torghast]]. But the Primus certainly does.

It is time to enact his contingency plan. The covenants will arrive with their sigils shortly. 

Inform the Primus that we are ready to begin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* +1,500 [[reputation]] with [[Death's Advance]]
*[[Concentrated Anima]] x5
*[[Emblem of Renown]]

==Completion==
Excellent, mortal. You have done your part.

Now my work begins.

==Notes==
[[File:Covenants Renewed.jpg|thumb|The covenants present their sigils]]
Talk to the Primus:
:Your efforts have helped the covenants remember their sacred purpose. The new sigils they have manifested will allow me to forge a key to follow [[Zovaal]] to the land of the [[First Ones]].
:Are you ready to begin, mortal?
:{{Gossip|<Signal the Primus to begin.>}}
:''The Primus walks over to the boulder that Jaina, Thrall, and Bolvar were using. The latter three step aside to watch.''
:{{text|say|The Primus|Zovaal may have won the battle, but he will not win the war. We stand united in purpose, and together we shall claim victory.}}
:''Representatives of the covenants arrive through the [[Waystone to Oribos (Korthia)|Waystone to Oribos]]: [[the Stonewright]] for the [[Venthyr Covenant|venthyr]], [[Uther]] for the [[Kyrian Covenant|kyrian]], [[Margrave Draka]] for the [[Necrolord Covenant|necrolords]], and [[Lady Moonberry]] for the [[Night Fae Covenant|night fae]].''
:{{text|say|The Primus|Covenants of the Shadowlands, step forward.}}

The four representatives summon their respective sigils. Collect each one:
;[[Sigil of the Venthyr]]
:{{Text|say|The Stonewright|[[Revendreth]] humbly offers our unity and purpose.}}

;[[Sigil of the Kyrian]]
:{{Text|say|Uther|To our cause, I present the devotion of [[Bastion]].}}

;[[Sigil of the Necrolords]]
:{{Text|say|Margrave Draka|My Primus, we offer you the might of [[Maldraxxus]].}}

;[[Sigil of the Night Fae]]
:{{Text|say|Lady Moonberry|The [[Winter Queen]] sends to you the steadfastness of [[Ardenweald]].}}

Talk to the Primus again:
[[File:Covenants Renewed - Four sigils.jpg|thumb|The four sigils]]
:Your efforts have helped the covenants remember their sacred purpose. The new sigils they have manifested will allow me to forge a key to follow Zovaal to the land of the First Ones.
:Are you ready to begin, mortal?
:{{Gossip|<Present the sigils to the Primus.>}}
:''The Primus summons all four sigils together, before they vanish in a burst of magic.''
:{{text|say|The Primus|Four covenants united. Our hope stands renewed.}}

;On completion

[[File:Covenants Renewed - Primus departure.jpg|thumb|The Primus takes his leave]]
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Primus, what we witnessed in the [[Crucible (Oribos)|Arbiter's chamber]], it was... beyond mortal understanding.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|Once, Zovaal stood among us as the [[Arbiter (title)|Arbiter]]. Yet he defied the will of the First Ones and sought to unmake the balance of the cosmos.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|For his crimes, we stripped our brother of his power and bound him to the Maw. It was I who scribed the runes of [[Domination]] upon his flesh.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|We used Zovaal's [[anima]] to construct a [[Arbiter|new Arbiter]], one that would be dispassionate and just.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|I should have realized that he would never stop fighting to reclaim his power... and see his schemes through to their bitter end.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|What will his next move be?}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|Zovaal pursues the secrets locked within the [[Sepulcher of the First Ones|Sepulcher]]. Should he find the knowledge he seeks, all that you know will be undone.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|Four sigils represent the renewed hope of the covenants. I will use them to forge a key... though I must find something to replace the Arbiter's sigil.}}
:''The Primus turns around and summons a large Death Gate.''
:{{text|say|The Primus|Keep pressing the attack against the Jailer's forces. When the key is ready, I will call for you.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|[[Death]] comes for the [[Azeroth (titan)|soul]] of [[Azeroth|your world]], mortal. But together, we may yet save it.}}
:''He walks through the Death Gate, which disappears behind him.''

===Post-quest dialogue===
After the dialogue with the Primus completes, Bolvar returns to his old spot next to [[Tal-Galan]] while Jaina and Thrall head to different ends of Keeper's Respite. Several "Stay awhile and listen" dialogues are now available from NPCs throughout the respite, as shown by a large {{Gossip icon}} icon above the NPC's head. The icon disappears after the first time the player triggers the dialogue, but the option remains permanently available from the NPCs in case the player wants to see the dialogue again.

In addition, a [[Misplaced Venthyr Tome]] on the lower level of the respite offers the optional extra quest [[A Loose Thread]].

;Tal-Galan
[[File:Covenants Renewed - Tal-Galan and Ve'nari.jpg|thumb|Tal-Galan and Ve'nari]]
:It is good to have you here, [[Maw Walker]].
:{{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
:''[[Ve'nari]] appears and walks up to Tal-Galan.''
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Greetings, my friend.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Friend? The elusive Ve'nari has no friends.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|I have been woefully misrepresented! I can be a good friend, a useful friend, to those in need. And everyone is in need of something.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|You more than most, from what I hear. In fact, I imagine this conversation is merely a pretext for you to inquire what I know of [[Zereth Mortis]].}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Do you not long to see the realm of the First Ones for yourself?}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|One day, perhaps. If the [[Purpose]] wills it.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Were you not assigned to Korthia for your intellect? Your curiosity? Perhaps your "purpose", my friend, is not to hoard knowledge, but to share it with those who would put it to use.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|I admit there are so many theories to explore... so many discoveries to be made... No! I will not think of it. Begone, [[broker]]! I need nothing from you.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Not today, perhaps. But one day you will. And when that time comes, I look forward to doing business.}}
:''Ve'nari walks off and despawns.''

;[[Uther]], standing with Lady Jaina Proudmoore
[[File:Covenants Renewed - Jaina and Uther.jpg|thumb|Jaina and Uther]]
:<Uther reaches toward the wound beneath his chestplate.>
:When [[Arthas Menethil|Arthas]] struck me down, [[Frostmourne]] shattered my soul. But it was not divided into one part that was noble and another that was cruel.
:Rather, it was as if a portion of my consciousness remained frozen in time while the rest of my soul carried on.
:To feel that missing fragment restored... well, it has caused me to reflect upon many of the choices I have made.
:{{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
:{{text|say|Uther|By the Light! Jaina Proudmoore, is that you?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Uther? Uther! A... [[kyrian]]?! Of course. It... it suits you.}}
:{{text|say|Uther|I barely recognized you, my lady. The last time we spoke was at...}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|[[Stratholme]]. After [[Culling of Stratholme|the culling]].}}
:{{text|say|Uther|I remember. You still think of him too, don't you? Even after all these years.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I've tried to put the past behind me. Now, with what's been done to Anduin... all those painful memories have flooded back again.}}
:{{text|say|Uther|Memories are like mirrors. They show us parts of ourselves, sometimes parts we'd like to forget. But you can choose what lessons to carry forward, and what to leave behind.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I loved him, you know.}}
:{{text|say|Uther|As did I. Take that love with you, Jaina. Let it lend you strength in dark times.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Thank you, Uther. Can you stay a while and talk? There's so much I'd like to share...}}

;Thrall, standing with Margrave Draka
[[File:Covenants Renewed - Thrall and Draka.jpg|thumb|Thrall and Draka]]
:Seeing the fate that awaits mortal [[soul]]s in the Shadowlands... the chance to get to know my mother... it has caused me to reflect on choices I have made.
:{{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Draka|You have told me many stories of your life, Go'el. It seems some of the memories trouble you.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Yes. I spoke of [[Garrosh Hellscream|Garrosh]], son of [[Grommash Hellscream]]. I'd hoped to spare him from the darkness his father knew, but instead... I fear I'm to blame for the ruin he unleashed.}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Draka|Fate sets a course before each of us. How are you to blame for the destiny he wrought?}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|I took him from [[Nagrand]]. I made him [[warchief]]. But when he needed me most, I left him to falter. And in the end, it was my hand that [[And Justice for Thrall|struck him down]].}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Draka|[[Durotan|Your father]] used to say that a [[wolf]] decides whether to come when called or to turn on its master. There is no fault, only nature taking its course. Garrosh chose his path, my son.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|But I set him upon it.}}
:{{text|say|Margrave Draka|You offered him a choice. You did not choose for him. Mourn if you must, but his decisions are not your burden to bear. His path ended. Yours moves forward.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Onward... yes. There's much to be done. Thank you, mother.}}

;[[Highlord Darion Mograine]], standing with [[Alexandros Mograine]]
[[File:Covenants Renewed - Alexandros and Darion.jpg|thumb|Alexandros and Darion]]
:One can only wonder how many secrets were lost forever when the Jailer ensnared Korthia within the Maw.
:The toll of{{Sic}} his misdeeds take truly has no end.
:{{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
:''Alexandros gets to his feet to face his son.''
:{{text|say|Alexandros Mograine|So [[Tirion Fordring]] took up the [[Ashbringer]] in my absence? I can think of few more worthy.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Darion Mograine|Indeed. He met the [[Lich King]] in battle and shattered [[Frostmourne]] itself.}}
:{{text|say|Alexandros Mograine|And yet you [[The Fourth Horseman|sought to raise him into undeath]]. Why deny him the rest he had earned?}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Darion Mograine|I [[Silver Hand, Ebon Blade|once]] told Tirion that only a [[Knights of the Silver Hand|silver hand]] can wield an [[Knights of the Ebon Blade|ebon blade]].}} 
:{{text|say|Highlord Darion Mograine|We needed a fourth [[Four Horsemen|horseman]], one to lead the others. He seemed the right choice.}}
:{{text|say|Alexandros Mograine|It appears fate chose differently. This is not the legacy I meant to leave you, Darion.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Darion Mograine|You taught me to defend that which I hold dear. I am proud to carry on such a legacy.}}
:{{text|say|Alexandros Mograine|And I am proud of you, my son.}}

More dialogue is available after the quest in other locations, with some being only accessible to members of the relevant covenant.

;{{Venthyr}} [[Kael'thas Sunstrider]] and [[The Accuser]] inside [[Sinfall]]
:{{text|say|Kael'thas Sunstrider|[[Kel'Thuzad]] has been destroyed. No! I should have been the one to claim vengeance for the [[sin'dorei]]!}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|And what would that have accomplished? Would it have changed the fate of your people?}}
:{{text|say|Kael'thas Sunstrider|No... I merely--}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|So this retribution would not have been for them at all. Only for you.}}
:{{text|say|Kael'thas Sunstrider|I... I was not there when [[Silvermoon]] fell. Absent in its hour of greatest need. My failure has haunted me ever since.}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Then it is not vengeance you seek, but redemption.}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|You committed many sins in life, Kael'thas Sunstrider. Your kingdom's ruin was not one of them.}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|Repent for all else... but forgive yourself for that.}}
:{{text|say|Kael'thas Sunstrider|Perhaps... you are right, Accuser. It seems I have work to do.}}

;[[Shandris Feathermoon]] and [[Tyrande Whisperwind]] outside of the [[Heart of the Forest]]
:I have witnessed many wondrous events within among these groves. But to hear [[Elune|the goddess]] speak through my minn'do was an experience that defies description.

:{{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|It is good to see you whole again, Minn'do. I had feared you might be forever lost.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Ever since [[Battle for Darkshore|Darkshore]], rage has swelled inside me. A tide under which I seemed destined to drown. It was not until I heard Elune's voice that I recognized the grief buried beneath my anger. Sorrow intertwined with a deep sense of betrayal.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|When [[Teldrassil]] [[Burning of Teldrassil|burned]], I could not understand why the goddess did not intervene. Why she would allow so many to be lost. But I did not know of Ardenweald. Of the duty and purpose that awaited the souls of our people. At least... before the Maw.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Perhaps we can never truly know the ways of the gods, my daughter. But I believe Elune made a choice to aid her sister. Not to cause us sorrow.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|The Winter Queen faced hard choices as well. She and Mother Moon are bound together in an eternal cycle. One of death and rebirth.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|A cycle the kaldorei must now rejoin. No more looking to the past. It is time to embrace our future.}}
