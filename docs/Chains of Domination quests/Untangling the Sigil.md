==Objectives==
Speak with Bolvar to discuss what to do with the sigil.
*[[Bolvar Fordragon]] spoken to
*Sigil brought to the [[Runecarver]]
*[[Primus]] defended

==Description==
The Primus's sigil is bound together with the magic of memory. It reminds me of something you have encountered before.

You made an ally of the Runecarver, that poor soul trapped in the bowels of [[Torghast]]. He took those memories you found and helped you forge them into weapons and armor.

Perhaps he can separate the sigil from this tangle of memories.

It's our best chance to secure the sigil. But the way will be perilous.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Tome of Origins]] (for crafters only)
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Completion==
We are free. There is still hope to fight back against Zovaal.

==Notes==

Speak with Bolvar:
:We must stop the Jailer at any cost.
:{{gossip|What should we do with the sigil?}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|This magic bound with the Primus's sigil... is it familiar, Maw Walker?}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|It is much like the memories you restored to the Runecarver in Torghast. If you bring this to him, perhaps he will know how to untangle the sigil.}}
:{{text|say|Tal-Galan|Torghast!? Unacceptable. You might as well deliver it directly into the Jailer's hands!}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|This is our only path forward. We have no choice but to try.}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|I'm going with you, Maw Walker. I will ensure this Runecarver's work is up to par.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|So be it. Good luck to you both.}}

Consider taking the [[Animaflow Teleporter]] to [[Ve'nari's Refuge]], then running through the [[Portal to Torghast]]. Head upstairs to the [[Runecarver's Oubliette]], where Heirmir is waiting:
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|This is the Runecarver?! Doesn't look like much.}}

Speak with the Runecarver:
:Have you recovered any more of my memories?
:The more you find, the more both of us shall benefit.
:{{gossip|I need your help. We need to seal this sigil so the Jailer cannot retrieve it.}}

This triggers an in-game cutscene.
:''The Maw Walker places the sigil in front of the Runecarver. With a burst of energy that knocks Heirmir and the Maw Walker off their feet, it turns into the symbol of the necrolords and starts floating towards the Runecarver.''
:{{text|say|Runecarver|I...}}
:''Necrotic energy starts gathering around him.''
:{{text|say|Runecarver|...remember...}}
:''The Runecarver absorbs the sigil, which causes bursts of energy to shoot up along his chains.''
:{{text|say|Runecarver|I remember...}}
:''The Runecarver reaches up, straining against his chains. When next he speaks, he does so with the voice of the Primus.''
:{{text|say|Runecarver|...everything!}}
:''Overflowing with power, the Runecarver snaps the chains. His shackles and mask fly off his body and disintegrate in mid-air. When the smoke clears, the Runecarver has regained his true form as the Primus. Heirmir kneels before him before getting to her feet again.''
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|My Primus! You've been trapped here all this time?!}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|You brought my sigil... to Zovaal's lair?}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|Forgive me, master. We were only--}}
:''The portal down to the antechamber deactivates, and the Jailer's chuckle echoes through the oubliette. The Primus glances around him and sees a blue flame gathering behind his back.''
:{{text|say|The Primus|He is coming.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|Prepare yourselves. We make our stand now.}}

This starts the '''Defending the Primus''' scenario:

===Stage 1: Speak to the Primus===
[[File:Untangling the Sigil - Primus and Heirmir.jpg|thumb|The Primus, actual size!]]
*Speak to the Primus
*Speak with the Primus

:Zovaal will be upon us at any moment. We must prepare.
:{{gossip|I'll help however I can.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|I will infuse you with the power of anima surging through Torghast.}}
:''The Primus summons a handful of anima cells.''
:{{text|say|The Primus|Occupy his forces while I find a way to escape!}}

===Final Stage: Defeat Incoming Mawsworn Forces===
[[File:Untangling the Sigil - Primus and Jailer.jpg|thumb|The Primus and the Jailer]]
*Defeat Incoming Mawsworn Forces
*Repel Mawsworn (0/100%)
:''The Jailer arrives.''
:{{text|say|The Jailer|Your sigil will be mine.}}
:''The two Eternal Ones begin channeling beams of energy at each other.''
:{{text|say|The Primus|No. I will defy you!}}
:{{text|say|The Jailer|You will fail... again.}}
:{{text|say|The Jailer|Mawsworn. Take them.}}
:{{text|say|Bonesmith Heirmir|I just got the Primus back. I cannot lose him again! FOR MALDRAXXUS!}}

The Primus buffs the Maw Walker with a few dozen [[anima power]]s, increasing max health, crit chance, [[Curious Miasma]], and a few class-specific powers, while the Jailer spawns dozens upon dozens of [[Mawsworn Ripper]]s, [[Mawsworn Ravager|Ravagers]], and [[Mawsworn Destructor|Destructors]] who latch chains onto the Primus. Take them all out with Heirmir and the anima powers' help.

At 25%:
:{{text|say|The Primus|Once, I hoped that all those ages spent in the Maw might change you.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|That you might repent for your sins.}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|But you have only grown more malevolent.}}

At 96%:
:{{text|say|The Jailer|You will claim no victory this day, brother. Bear witness.}}
:''The Jailer takes control of Heirmir and the player and pulls them towards him before chaining them both to the floor. A small Maw portal opens at the Jailer's feet. Anduin emerges and starts casting {{Abilities|Mass Reclaim|id=352112|icon=spell_animamaw_buff}}.''
:{{text|say|Anduin|You once bound me with Domination. Now it is my weapon to wield.}}

===Finale===
A cutscene plays:
:''The camera tracks around the room, looking down from on high as the Primus and the Jailer continue channeling at each other as the Mawsworn army—resurrected by Anduin—look on.''
:{{text|say|The Primus|I will resist you to my last, Zovaal!}}
:{{text|say|The Primus|Should you strike me down, my sigil will be lost to you forever!}}
:{{text|say|The Jailer|No. There is another way.}}
:''Anduin pulls out [[Kingsmourne]] and holds it up in front of the Primus.''
:{{text|say|The Primus|A mourneblade!}}
:''The Jailer and Anduin launch simultaneous attacks at the Primus, incapacitating the latter. Anduin strikes with his sword, severing the sigil from the Primus's chest. With another swing, Anduin launches the sigil away from the Primus and into the hand of the Jailer, who absorbs it into his body.''
:{{text|say|The Jailer|You and all the rest will bear witness to my victory.}}
:''The Jailer teleports himself, Anduin, and the Mawsworn away. The Maw Walker and Heirmir  are freed from their chains as the screen fades to black.''
