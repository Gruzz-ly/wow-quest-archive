==Objectives==
Track down [[Huln Highmountain]].
*Speak with [[Terrified Stoneborn]] {{co|34.2|15.8|Revendreth}}
*Huln Found {{co|33.9|9.1|Revendreth}}
*Huln Rescued
*Speak with the Stonewright {{co|33.9|9.5|Revendreth}}

==Description==
It sounds like Huln was taken elsewhere, and by [[the Stonewright]] herself!

We should look for signs she came through the area. Hopefully that will lead us to Huln!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
What an adventure!

==Completion==
We found Huln and conveniently he was with just the person we need to help with the ritual!

I love it when things work out for everyone, don't you?

==Notes==
Get back to the surface:
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|You're pretty good at this gig, Miss Wings!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Meh. The dead mother trope is such lazy writing.}}

Head northwest and cross the bridge:
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|Oi! That cowerin' one has definitely seen the Stonewright.}}

Speak with the [[Terrified Stoneborn]]:
:What?
:{{gossip|Has the Stonewright passed this way with a captive recently?}}
:{{text|say|Terrified Stoneborn|She threatened to throw him into the Maw. Better him than me!}}
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|The Maw? Oh we better beat feet if we want to save this bloke. Come on!}}

Up the stairs to the north, where the terrain is crumbling into the Maw:
:{{text|say|Cudgelface|We gotta be close now. Runnin' out of realm!}}

Get close to Huln and the Stonewright and an in-game cutscene takes place:

:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Look! There's Huln!}}
:''At the bottom of the stairs, the Stonewright is strangling Huln. Moonberry, Cudgelface, and the Maw Walker hurry down the steps.''
:{{text|say|The Stonewright|What does your master seek, dreadlord?! Answer me!}}
:{{text|say|Huln Hughmountain|<Huln grunts and struggles>}}
:''Moonberry flies up next to the Stonewright.''
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Please! There has been a terrible misunderstanding!}}
:{{text|say|The Stonewright|More of your wretched kind?!}}
:''The Stonewright drops Huln, who collapses on the ground.''
:{{text|say|The Stonewright|I will slay you all myself!}}
:''She floats into the air, gathers anima around herself and unleashes it in a wave against the trio, stripping Moonberry and the Maw Walker of their glamors.''

[[File:Out On the Edge - Stonewright.jpg|thumb|The hostile Stonewright]]
On the other side of the cutscene, the Stonewright has turned hostile and Huln is on his knees. The faerie and dredger are stunned, so the player has to fight the Harvester on their own. Get her to 90% and she turns friendly while Moonberry and Cudgelface come to:
:{{text|say|The Stonewright|Ardenweald? Why are you in Revendreth?}}
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|We seek Night Warriors who passed beyond the veil.}}
:{{text|say|The Stonewright|Explain.}}

Speak with the Stonewright:
:Speak quickly.
:{{gossip|<Quickly explain what is going on.>}}
:{{text|say|The Stonewright|I will aid you, but be warned... [[Elune]]'s wrath is not easily quelled.}}
