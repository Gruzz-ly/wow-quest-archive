==Objectives==
[[File:Convoy of the Covenants.jpg|thumb|The party gathered]]
Gather the Envoys and ride to [[Dominance Gate]].
*[[The Unseen Guests Among Us]] (provided)
*Coordinate with the Princeguard {{co|27.8|41.0|Revendreth}}
*Ride Prince Renathal's Carriage {{co|33.3|41.3|Revendreth}}
*Deliver the Primus's message to the Stonewright.

==Description==
A new [[sigil]] for the [[Venthyr]] would require all seven medallions to forge.

The [[Primus]] was correct. The person we need is [[the Stonewright]]. Her grievances against the [[Nathrezim|Unseen]] could fill a library and she holds the last of the medallions we need. I believe you and I are long overdue in convincing her to join our cause.

I will make the arrangements. We shall go properly this time, with gifts and diplomacy. 

You should warn [[Chelra the Bladewall|Chelra]], she will want to arrange an escort.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 4,100 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
What do you bring me, [[Maw Walker]]? Be advised I have no patience for deception and am not above feeding messengers to the [[gargon]]s.

==Completion==
Hmm. A letter from the [[Primus]] himself? I had wondered what had become of that old tyrant. 

<Glances over the proffered letter.>

I... see.

==Notes==
Head back through the mirror (or fly...) and speak with [[Chelra the Bladewall]], who is patrolling in front of three [[Princeguard Elite]]s on a rampart:
:Our allies grow in strength, as does our forces here.
:We owe it to your efforts, Maw Walker.
:{{gossip|Prince Renathal plans to petition the Stonewright.}}
:{{text|say|Chelra the Bladewall|So he has finally worked up the nerve to meet with her. I must gather a worthy escort.}}
:''Chelra and the three Elites fly off to the east.''

Catch up with Renathal, [[The Curator (venthyr)|the Curator]], [[the Accuser]], [[General Draven]], [[Vashj|Baroness Vashj]], [[Khaliiq]], and [[Kael'thas Sunstrider]] near the [[Bridge of Banishment]]:
:{{text|say|Kael'thas Sunstrider|Why were you sent to Maldraxxus, Vashj? You have no shortage of sins.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|And no shortage of victories. Can you say the same?}}

The Accuser has some gossip:
:Maw Walker. I am willing to acquiesce to the request from the Baroness for Kael'thas to accompany you on this mission.
:However, keep an eye on the two of them. I am not convinced she is a good influence and may cause Kael'thas to regress into former practices. 
:He has been showing promise lately, but I would feel more comfortable with this if he had another century or two of penance in place.

As does the Curator:
:Oh, um, hello.
:Please be so kind as to eliminate this [[nathrezim|dreadlord]] threat as quickly as possible. The long standing consequences to the Harvester of Wrath hunting them presents more destruction than we are prepared to handle in the wake of [[Denathrius]]'s betrayal.
:Also, if you speak with [[Z'rali|the naaru]] again please notify her that her continued presence in our realm, of her own free will, may lead to the manifestation of her own [[sinstone]]. While hardly a common occurrence with entities from other [[plane|planes of existence]], she may wish to conceal such an item if it materializes to avoid any past indiscretions from being used against her.

As does Chelra:
:Prince Renathal goes to meet the mother of stone. It is only prudent we bring a formidable honor guard. They do not call her the Harvester of Wrath because she has an inviting attitude.

[[File:Convoy of the Covenants - Renathal and the Stonewright.jpg|thumb|Renathal and the Stonewright]]
Hop in Prince Renathal's Carriage. Renathal and the Curator join the Maw Walker, and Chelra hops on top. In the carriage behind are Kael'thas, Vashj, Khaliiq, and her Hands of Vashj.
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Countless ages ago, just after the first venthyr were sired, Denathrius unveiled another creation. The nathrezim.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Forged to be the ultimate infiltrators, they bore the influence of Death into the realms of our rivals... as well as the worlds of the living.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Despite their subtlety, one of these incursions was discovered.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|In response, the full wrath of the Light fell upon Revendreth, setting ablaze the ward once held by the nathrezim.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|The armies of Maldraxxus did not rise up to defend us, so the Stonewright carved her Stone Legion to strike back against the Light.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Once the naaru were routed, the Stonewright turned her anger upon the nathrezim, blaming them for the loss of so many of her children.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|The conflict was ended by Denathrius, who said he would exile them to a world beyond the Shadowlands.}}
:{{text|say|Prince Renathal|Denathrius never told me what became of the nathrezim. Only later did I learn that mortal souls had come to know them by another name: the dreadlords.}}

Upon arriving to [[Dominance Keep]] on the other side of the carriage ride, the player is granted a buff that turns the mobs in the Dominance Keep area {{Rep|neutral}}:
:{{Abilities|Diplomatic Envoy|id=350714|Under the protection of the Stonewright.|icon=ui_sigil_venthyr}}

In addition, Chelra has new gossip:
:I have not set foot in this fortress for many eons. Time and the drought have been unkind to it.
:Mind your surroundings, Maw Walker. The Prince is in danger, even now. Stay focused.

==Progression==
{{The Unseen Guests}}

==PTR version==
{{Rfptr-section}}
On the PTR, Kael and Vashj's dialogue was more extensive:
:{{text|say|Kael'thas Sunstrider|Why were you sent to Maldraxxus, Vashj? You have no shortage of sins.}}
:{{text|say|Baroness Vashj|And no shortage of victories. Can you say the same?}}
:{{text|say|The Accuser|I concede that you two may have extensive experience with the nathrezim. What I protest is that neither of you are good for each other. Kael'thas requires more penance. And so do you... baroness.}}
:{{text|say|Kael'thas Sunstrider|Would you see me atone to the point where I no longer have value? Where I am no longer myself?}}

The Curator's gossip text was also slightly different (note the difference in the last sentence):
:Oh, um, hello.
:Please be so kind as to eliminate this dreadlord threat as quickly as possible. The long standing consequences to the Harvester of Wrath hunting them presents more destruction than we are prepared to handle in the wake of Denathrius's betrayal.
:Also, if you speak with the naaru again please notify her that her continued presence in our realm, of her own free will, may lead to the manifestation of her own sinstone. While hardly a common occurrence with entities from other planes of existence, I do recall more than one entity manifesting sinstones that were quite challenging to deal with.
