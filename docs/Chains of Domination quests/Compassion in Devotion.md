==Objectives==
[[File:Compassion in Devotion.jpg|thumb|At Steward's Rest]]
Meet [[Polemarch Adrestes|Adrestes]] at [[Steward's Rest]].

==Description==
Our first order of business is to rededicate the [[Citadel of Loyalty|Temple of Loyalty]].

[[Pelagos]] has volunteered to stay here to help prepare for the ceremony. I requested that [[Nikolon]] bring his companions to meet us at [[Steward's Rest]], to aid us in convincing some of the Forsworn of our new path.

Meet us there when you are able.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|57|40}}

==Completion==
Let us begin.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|Not only must we reclaim the temple, but we must implore the remaining Forsworn to join our cause.}}
:{{text|say|Fallen Disciple Nikolon|You shall have our support. I will gather my allies and meet you at Steward's Rest.}}
:''Nikolon and Uther fly off to the west.''

Fly to the northwestern part of the zone, at the north end of [[Steward's Rest]]. The local [[steward]]s are now mingling with their Forsworn counterparts ([[Darksworn Attendant]]s and [[Misled Steward]]s) by talking or playing music side by side. Nikolon, Uther, Adrestes, Kleia, and Kynthia are all waiting in front of the stairs to the Citadel of Loyalty. On approach:
:{{text|say|Kleia|Forsworn and kyrian, standing side by side!}}
:{{text|say|Polemarch Adrestes|This is only the beginning, Kleia. A bright future awaits us all.}}
