==Objectives==
[[File:Record Keeper.jpg|thumb|Record Keeper]]
Rescue 5 record keepers from [[Scholar's Den]].
*[[Record Keeper]]s rescued (5)

==Description==
[[Vault of Secrets|Our vault]] was built to store countless secrets and artifacts. Even if we gain entrance, we can't be certain what [[the Jailer]] is looking for.

Certain [[attendant]]s are given the title record keeper, tracking items stored in the vault. They are known for having the utmost discretion.

A number of keepers have been taken captive by the Mawsworn and are being tortured for information.

Save the record keepers, <name>. They can help us determine what the Banished One seeks!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
*+75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
The record keepers will help us determine what the Jailer wants.

==Completion==
[[File:The Knowledge Keepers - recovered.jpg|thumb|Freed Record Keepers]]
I am relieved to see more of my people freed from the Jailer's grasp.

Now we must determine what he's looking for.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Vengeance for Korthia]] and [[Let the Anima Flow]] before heading out.

Open [[Mawsworn Cage]]s while killing mawsworn in the area to free [[Record Keeper]]s:
*{{text|say|Record Keeper|You have saved these records from the Mawsworn. You have my thanks.}}
*{{text|say|Record Keeper|These records must reach Tal-Galan.}}
*{{text|say|Record Keeper|You have done well. I must get this data to Tal-Galan.}}
*{{text|say|Record Keeper|You have my thanks. I shall deliver these records to Tal-Galan.}}

More cages are inside the [[Caverns of Contemplation]].
