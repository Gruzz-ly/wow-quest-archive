==Objectives==
Go to the [[Circle of Glory]] and fight the [[val'kyr]] to determine which are most worthy.
*[[Horn of Challenge (Skyhold)|Horn of Challenge]] used (optional) {{co|73.0|35.0|Skyhold}}
*Val'kyr chosen (3)

==Description==
[[File:Val'kyr Challenger.jpg|thumb|[[Val'kyr Challenger]]]]
I have need of more val'kyr to join [[Danica the Reclaimer|Danica]] in the battle to come. <Name>, you are granted the honor of choosing the most worthy.

The strongest will present themselves in challenge at the Circle of Glory. Fight hard, <class>, and do honor to your weapons.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
Have the worthy been selected?

==Completion==
Well fought. [[Kolfinna]], [[Dyrfinna|Dryfinna]]{{Sic}}, and [[Aeskir]] have risen to the challenge and await you in [[Great Mead Hall|Odyn's hall]].

==Notes==
[[File:The Chosen Few - chosen val'kyr.jpg|thumb|Danica and the chosen val'kyr]]
Pick up [[Fury Given Voice]] before heading out. On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Odyn|After [[Helya (tactics)|her defeat]], I thought we'd seen the last of Helya's treachery. But her venomous words and deeds never cease to vex me!}}
:{{text|say|Odyn|My own noble, all-seeing eye has been twisted into a weapon of darkness. This insult cannot stand!}}
:{{text|say|Odyn|Danica! Become the instrument of my wrath! Fight alongside this mortal champion and claim victory in my name!}}
:{{text|say|Danica the Reclaimer|It will be done, great Odyn. I vow to avenge my sisters!}}

To the north, then east at the crossroads is the [[Arena of Glory]]. Approach Asvard:
:{{text|say|Weaponmaster Asvard|Good, you are here. Sound the Horn of Challenge to begin.}}

Use the Horn of Challenge on the table just to Asvard's north to jump in, or simply leap inside the ring yourself. Knock the Val'kyr Challenger down to 15% health.
:{{text|say|Weaponmaster Asvard|Another seeks to claim their glory. Prepare for battle!}}

Chosen:
:''The valkyr levels up and becomes a Worthy Val'kyr Challenger!''
:{{text|say|Weaponmaster Asvard|Well fought! You are chosen to serve Odyn's wrath. Go now to his side.}}

Not chosen:
:{{text|say|Weaponmaster Asvard|You lack discipline. Victory is not yours this day.}}

Rinse and repeat until three have been chosen. It can take up to eight attempts at most. Use the [[Challenger's Winds]] to leave the circle.
