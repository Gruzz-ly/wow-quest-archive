'''Inform the Primus''' breadcrumbs players back to [[Korthia]] to end the "The Power of Night" chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]]. The penultimate chapter begins at [[:Renown]] 56 with [[A Paladin's Soul]].

==Objectives==
Return to [[the Primus]] in [[Korthia]].

==Description==
<Name>, return to Korthia and tell the Primus the [[Winter Queen]]'s [[sigil]] has been restored.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|57|40}}

==Completion==
Ah, good. With the Queen's Sigil restored, we're that much closer to being able to stop [[Zovaal]]. Thank you for this information.

==Notes==
Quest shortcuts? Nah, we don't need those here... To [[Oribos]], then upstairs, and through the northwest portal back to [[Keeper's Respite]]. On completion:
:''The Primus turns around to address the player.''
:{{Text|say|The Primus|The Winter Queen is bound to [[Elune|her counterpart]] in the realms of [[Life]]. Together, they embody the balance of the great cycle.}}
:{{Text|say|The Primus|Through sorrow and understanding, the night fae sigil has been reborn. And perhaps their kinship as well.}}
:''He turns back around to his regular position.''
