==Objectives==
Ask [[Ve'nari]] about the location of a second waystone.
*Ve'nari's help gained
*Speak with Ve'nari within Ve'nari's Refuge.

==Description==
[[Fatescribe Roh-Tahl|The Fatescribe]] is certain that a second waystone has emerged in the [[Maw]]. It falls to you to locate it. 

I will create an anchor here in [[Oribos]] that links to your [[anima]]. Once you attune yourself to the waystone, this anchor will be bound to it.

If you are successful, the covenants will be able to send their forces inside and safely leave the Maw again.

Use what resources you have within the Maw to find this waystone.

Good luck, mortal. May the [[Purpose]] guide us all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* +50 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
You have that look about you, [[Maw Walker]].

The one that tells me you are about to ask for my help.

==Completion==
Normally, I would consider your request bothersome and insulting.

But recent events have led me to believe that your proposal may prove beneficial to both of us.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Tal-Inara]]|I will create the anchor. Go now and find the waystone. Purpose guide us all.}}
:{{text|say|[[Highlord Bolvar Fordragon]]|We will defend Oribos from [[the Jailer]]'s forces. Hurry, Maw Walker. The enemy's strength is growing.}}

Upstairs to the [[Ring of Transference]], then a swan dive down the middle, as ever and always. Check in with Ve'nari at her refuge:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Ah, Maw Walker. I was wondering when you would show up.}}

Speak with her:
:You have a curious look about you, Maw Walker.
:As if you are about to ask me for a rather large favor...
:{{gossip|I need your help to find a second waystone to create a permanent connection to Oribos.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|The Jailer has used enormous chains to pull a broken realm into the Maw. I caught only a glimpse, but I have a suspicion of what it might be.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|I suggest we travel there together. While you search for your waystone, I will determine what potential profits lie in store. For both of us, I mean.}}

==Progression==
