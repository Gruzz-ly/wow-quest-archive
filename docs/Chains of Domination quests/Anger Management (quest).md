==Objectives==
Use the siphoning device to drain rage from the [[Furious Shade]]s in the [[Gorgoa: River of Souls|River of Souls]].
*Rage drained (0/100%)
*[[Siphoning Device]] (provided)

==Description==
I am no musician, though I've spent many an hour enjoying the entertainment in [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market|Tazavesh]].

Giving this horn a voice will require the harvest of strong emotions.

Anger seethes unrestrained within the damned unfortunates consigned to the River of Souls. Use this siphoning device to drain the rage of these furious shades into your instrument.

The shrieks of fury that you acquire should allow you to pierce the Maw and reach your allies.

The tune, I suspect, will not be a popular one.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Ve'nari]]

==Progress==
Enough souls must be drained to give the instrument the voice strong enough to pierce the Maw.

==Completion==
The instrument's voice will not be pleasing to most ears, but I believe it will serve its purpose.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Tears of the Damned]] before heading out. On accept:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|To the River of Souls you must go. Gorgoa flows through the Maw, delivering damned souls to their fate.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|I must ask you to brave its perils and bring me remnants of the spirits that linger there.}}

Don't attack the hostile [[Furious Shade]]s, just use the quest item on them. Friendly shades have already been siphoned, but they will regain their rage after 30 seconds.
*{{text|say|Furious Shade|Rage is bound to regret.}}
*{{text|say|Furious Shade|Is anything left of who I was?}}
*{{text|say|Furious Shade|The anger... replaced by sorrow.}}
*{{text|say|Furious Shade|You're the monster!}}
*{{text|say|Furious Shade|I am sorry. So sorry!}}

Turn in to the [[Ve'nari|Projection of Ve'nari]] at the north end of the river, near [[Odalrik]].

==Progression==
{{Focusing the Eye}}

==Patch changes==
