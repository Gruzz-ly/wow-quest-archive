==Completion==
It really is a shame you missed it, <name>. [[Dwarf|Dwarven]] [[Gryphon rider|gryphon-riders]] got the jump on us, but I don't think they were counting on us packing so many trained killers onto one boat.

Even [[Thomas Zelling|Zelling]] got into the fun!

I found this letter on one of the dwarven corpses. Looks like there's tensions between the [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]] leadership and one of their houses, [[House Ashvane]]. This might give us a good opportunity to sow some chaos in [[Boralus]].
