==Objectives==
Kill Blood Prince Dreven.
* [[Blood Prince Dreven]] slain {{co|41.6|55.7|The Great Sea}}
* Escape the [[Crimson Squall|ship]] and signal [[Falstad Wildhammer|Falstad]]

==Description==
Blood Prince Dreven has barricaded himself in the lowest deck of this ship. He's trapped down there.

Don't think that makes this easy for us. A cornered beast is more dangerous than a free one. But, if we have the will and wisdom, he can be slain.

Follow me. I will break the barrier blocking his lair and we will face him together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,780 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Completion==
<[[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris]] raises her eyes to the sky and speaks somberly.>

Ande'thoras-ethil, sisters. Shaha lor'ma.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|We'll attack Blood Prince Dreven together. No mercy. No escape.}}
:''Shandris runs forward and dispels the barrier preventing access to the lower deck.''
: {{text|yell|Shandris Feathermoon|Your foul blood magic cannot protect you, Dreven!}}

Run below deck and approach Drevin to begin the encounter:
: ''Dreven is in the process of draining the life from a third [[Crimson Squall Deckhand]], having already killed two other [[Forsaken]].''
: {{text|yell|Shandris Feathermoon|There will be no escape this time, abomination. Your death is long overdue.}}
:{{text|say|Blood Prince Dreven|The trouble with undead has always been the lack of meat on their bones. I had to drain three to match the power from a [[night elf]].}}
: ''He finishes off the deckhand and turns to his confronters.''
:{{text|say|Blood Prince Dreven|No matter, I'll simply tell Sylvanas that you killed them... before I killed you!}}
: ''He attacks. From outside you hear [[Falstad Wildhammer]] yell out:''
: {{text|yell|Falstad Wildhammer|Me and [[Swiftwing]] got yer back, <name>! We'll keep the hammers comin' through the ports!}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|[[Sentinel Falia]]. [[Sentinel Aeolyn]]. [[Sentinel Lyrias]].}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|You will know my sisters' names before you fall, monster.}}
:{{text|say|Blood Prince Dreven|Foolish girl. I knew their names when I drained the life from their husks.}}
:{{text|say|Blood Prince Dreven|It added to the appeal.}}

At 25%:
:{{text|say|Blood Prince Dreven|I've grown weary of your feeble play at combat. I will entertain these foolish notions no longer.}}
:''Drevin pops an immunity shield.''
:{{text|emote|Blood Prince Dreven begins casting a spell to escape!}}
: {{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|No! No more trickery. No more escape. I will not wait any longer for justice.}}
: {{text|yell|Shandris Feathermoon|Goddess, give me strength!}}
: ''Surging forward, Shandris manages to pierce the shield and finishes Dreven off in one strike! She kneels for a moment over the body.''
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Anu'dorini talah... monster.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Blood Prince Dreven is dead. We must move before [[Nathanos Blightcaller|Nathanos]] and the others recover from the Wildhammer diversion.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Signal Falstad and join me in the skies. We'll return to [[Boralus]] together.}}
: ''She jumps up into the forward starboard gunport frame, mounts up on [[Jai'alator]] and flies off.''

Jump out the window and use the bonus ability:
*{{abilities|Signal Falstad|Shoot a flare into the sky, signalling Falstad Wildhammer to swoop down and pick you up.|id=276935}}
:{{text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|Ah, there ye are, <name>. Hop on!}}
: ''Falstad flies straight down from above you and picks you up.''
:{{text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|[[Azeroth]] be a better place without that Blood Prince. Ye did good, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|Me Wildhammers won't be able tae keep Nathanos and the rest of the [[Horde]] busy much longer. Ye ready tae leave?}}
: ''Jai'alator flies up to join Swiftwing.''
