==Objectives==
Slay Daenistrasz.
* [[Daenistrasz]] slain

==Description==
Huh. A [[dragon]], you say? [[Hobart Grapplehammer|I]] suppose that makes sense. I mean, the [[Old Horde|Horde]] did utilize [[red dragon]]s as part of their army during the [[Second War|second war]], but... well, we don't talk about that very much anymore.

Still, [[Marshal M. Valentine|Valentine]] is on that ship. You're gonna have to get past that dragon one way or another.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Completion==
OK. Nice. Good job.

==Progression==
{{At the Bottom of the Sea}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
