==Objectives==
Collect gunpowder, cannonballs, and a torch, then fire the [[cannon]]s.
* [[Azerite-Infused Cannonballs]] {{co|37.0|52.0|The Great Sea}}
* [[Azerite-Infused Gunpowder]] {{co|36.8|52.9|The Great Sea}}
* [[Banshee's Wail Torch]] {{co|36.6|53.3|The Great Sea}}
* [[The Banshee's Wail Cannon|Cannons]] fired (3)

==Description==
<The [[Banshee's Wail|ship's]] cannons are currently pointed at the other [[Forsaken]] ship across the water.

However, it appears the crew hasn't loaded them with gunpowder or cannonballs yet... Probably to avoid any accidental firings while they're anchored here.

Yes, it'd be a real shame if "accidental" cannon fire damaged the other ship.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Ye find anything interesting down in the ship?

==Completion==
I wish ye could've seen the crew panicking when ye shot off those cannons. It was hilarious!

That's the Wildhammer style!

==Notes==
The three target objects are below deck. Interact with each of them to spawn a [[Banshee's Wail Swabby]]. Then fire each of the three cannons.

==Progression==
{{Blood in the Water}}
