==Completion==
The [[Horde]] aren't just here on a [[san'layn]] shuttling mission. There are lots of high-ranking Horde figures here. Something's going on.

One perk of dealing with important Horde targets is that they tend to be carrying important information. Look at this map I found on one of the bodies. See the big red circle around "[[Kings' Rest]]"? What is Kings' Rest? Why don't the [[Alliance]] know about this?

We'll have to look into it as soon as we get back on land.

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following: [[Kings' Rest]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,790 [[XP]]

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Meet me below deck when you're done. I'll find a way to destroy the barrier protecting Blood Prince Dreven.}}

==Progression==
{{Blood in the Water}}

==Patch changes==
