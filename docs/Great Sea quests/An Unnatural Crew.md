==Objectives==
Kill 12 Horde crew aboard the Crimson Squall.
* Kill [[Horde]] on The [[Crimson Squall]] (12)

==Description==
[[Blood Prince Dreven]] is here, and the situation's even worse than we thought.

That monster's training other [[san'layn]]. Every neophyte you see on this ship is another future Blood Prince Dreven.

His vile practices cannot be allowed to spread within the Horde. We're going to tear the san'layn out, right now, root and all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Every san'layn must be felled today, or we'll never be rid of them.

==Completion==
That is enough for now. We must focus our efforts on Blood Prince Dreven.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Meet me below deck when you're done. I'll find a way to destroy the barrier protecting Blood Prince Dreven.}}

The player is Hunted by the San'layn. Kill [[Crimson Squall Deck Hand]]s, [[San'layn Neophyte]]s, and [[Crimson Squall Deckhand]]s.

==Progression==
{{Blood in the Water}}
