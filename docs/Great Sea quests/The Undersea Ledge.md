==Objectives==
Find [[Marshal M. Valentine|Marshal Valentine's]] shipwreck on the undersea ledge nearby.
* Find the shipwreck on the ledge

==Description==
So, now that [[Hobart Grapplehammer|we]] can hear each other again, lemme tell you what's been goin' on up here.

Apparently we were off by like, a league. Somethin' about undersea currents, somethin' about the tides of time, yadda yadda. I think [[Thomas Zelling|Zelling]] is getting rusty.

Point is, you're not far off now. We're SURE that Marshal Valentine is right to the east of ya, in a shipwreck up on a ledge. Zelling says there's something else big up there too, but he can't tell what it is.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Say what? You have good news and you have bad news?

I'm guessing that the good news is that you found the ship...

==Notes==
*Approaching the final wreckage reveals [[Daenistrasz]]!
