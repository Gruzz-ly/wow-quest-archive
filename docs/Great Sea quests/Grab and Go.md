==Objectives==
Grab Marshal M. Valentine's body, as well as the body of the other sailor aboard his ship.
* Gather [[Marshal M. Valentine]]'s body
* Gather the other [[sailor]]'s [[Drowned Sailor|body]]

==Description==
Nothin' left to do but grab that Marshal and bring him back up to the surface, then.

Though I guess you might as well search the shipwreck for anything else of value. You spent all that time gettin' down there, and time is money.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Completion==
<Nathanos looks at the two sailors' bodies, pauses for a moment, and then laughs.>

Not only did you succeed, but you've also brought me the corpse of [[Katherine Proudmoore|Lady Proudmoore's]] [[Derek Proudmoore|firstborn son]]?! You make my job easy, <name>.

Both get Buoy. Upon emerging, the ''[[Crimson Squall]]'', previously intact, is now damaged and circled by [[gryphon rider]]s while [[Wildhammer Gryphon Rider (Great Sea)|others]] are found dead on the ''Banshee's Wail''.
