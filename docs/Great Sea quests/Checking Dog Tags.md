==Objectives==
Find and identify the captain of the shipwreck.
* Find the ship's [[captain (rank)|captain]]

==Description==
You are no longer able to hear [[Hobart Grapplehammer|Hobart's]] voice over the static.

You can make out the outlines of several floating bodies nearby. They have significantly decomposed, but their dog tags should still be intact.

Hopefully the dog tags can help identify [[Marshal M. Valentine|Marshal Valentine]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Completion==
The captain's dog tag identified him as Knight-Captain [[Ellis R. Ladimore]] - not [[Marshal M. Valentine|Marshal Valentine]]. This was the wrong ship.

==Notes==
Click on [[Drowned Sailor]]s revealing their names.
*[[Private Lorelai Whetstone]] (on the ship)
*[[Sergeant Major Alison Flint]] (near the captain)
*[[Corporal Jameson Keefe]] (to the right of the ship)
*[[Private James Simmons]] (in front of the ship)
*[[Knight-Captain Ellis R. Ladimore]], Captain of the Fathomdasher (your target)
