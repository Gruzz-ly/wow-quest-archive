==Objectives==
Destroy 5 San'layn Crystals.
* [[San'layn Crystal]]s destroyed (5)

==Description==
[[Blood Prince Dreven]] and his followers are siphoning power from blood-infused crystals to bolster their unholy abilities.

Destroying those crystals will weaken Dreven before we fight him. Take out as many as you can find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Disgusting, vile things.

==Completion==
Good. That should weaken Blood Prince Dreven long enough for us to kill him.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Meet me below deck when you're done. I'll find a way to destroy the barrier protecting Blood Prince Dreven.}}
