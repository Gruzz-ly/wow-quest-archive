==Objectives==
Join [[Falstad Wildhammer|Falstad]] and [[Swiftwing]] on a bombing run over the [[Horde]] ships.
* Order Falstad to start the attack
* Horde [[sailor]]s slain (60)
* [[Salvaged Supplies (Great Sea)|Horde rowboats]] destroyed (15)
* The Crimson Squall deck burned
* The Crimson Squall sails burned

==Description==
Well, if ye didn't find [[Blood Prince Dreven]] on yer ship, he must be hiding on the other one.

I can take ye down to it, but the Horde knows we're here now. What do ye say we create some distractions to hold their attention while we hunt down Dreven?

Me Wildhammers are itchin' tae let the hammers fly. Ye want to join us for the first round?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Nothin' matches the power, or fun, of a [[stormhammer]] hurled from the back of a [[gryphon]]!

==Completion==
He's here.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|Let me know when ye are ready tae start the bombing run.}}

#{{abilities|Attack!|Order Falstad to enter his attack pattern.|id=277702|icon=ability_marksmanship}}
:{{text|yell|Falstad Wildhammer|Wildhammers, focus yer attention on the Banshee's Wail! Keep 'em locked down!}}
:{{text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|Take me hammers, <name>, and throw 'em with all of yer strength!}}
:{{text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|Someone's protectin' the Banshee's Wail with fancy tidesage magic!}}
:{{text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|Me Wildhammer'll keep the Horde's attention on that ship while we target Dreven on the other one.}}

#{{abilities|Stormhammer|range=200|cd=1.5 sec|Throw a stormhammer, dealing heavy damage and causing lightning to strike wherever it lands, igniting fires on boats.|id=276277|icon=ability_shaman_stormstrike}}

When healing:
:{{text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|I got ye, Swiftwing. No Horde cannon's bringing us down today.}}
