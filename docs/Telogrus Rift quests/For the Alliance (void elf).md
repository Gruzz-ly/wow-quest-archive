==Objectives==
Meet [[Ambassador Moorgard]] at the [[Stormwind Embassy]].

==Description==
Mastering the whispers requires constant focus and discipline. Your dedication inspires all who bear the name [[ren'dorei]]--for we have become children of the [[Void]].

You have learned many lessons here, but the time has come to venture beyond [[Telogrus Rift]].

Go to [[Stormwind]], the heart of the [[Alliance]]. There, the king's ambassador will greet you and guide you along your journey.

[[Azeroth]] must be defended. I can think of no one better suited to answer that call than you, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|25}}
*395 [[XP]]
*[[Letter from King Anduin Wrynn]]
*[[Ren'dorei Tabard]]

==Completion==
Ah, there you are, <name>! We've been inspecting–-err–-expecting you!
