==Objectives==
Close 5 Unstable Void Rifts in [[Telogrus Rift]].
*[[Unstable Void Rift]] closed (5)
*Report to [[Magister Umbric]] on the [[Cosmic Horizon]].

==Description==
Telogrus Rift has always been extremely sensitive to cosmic shifts. It makes for a rather precarious homestead, but the [[void elf|void elves]] have... few options available to us.

The recent influx in [[void]] energies has resulted in unstable rifts opening sporadically. And with so many investigating [[Azeroth]], I'm having trouble finding [[Riftwalkers]] to deal with them.

Could you close any unstable void rifts you find along your path?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Normally the Riftwalkers would be the ones to mend these sort of anomalies. But I wouldn't want to distract from their current investigations.

==Completion==
Excellent work.

Those unstable void rifts threaten more than just our reality. If left unchecked, they would spread rampantly like little cosmic prions. No reality, no possibility, no truth that could possibly be would be safe from them.

Which is all to say, you did us quite the favor by closing them.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|[[Alleria Windrunner]]|There's something else. A vision is being seen all across Azeroth.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|They call it the [[Radiant Song]].}}
:{{text|say|[[Magister Umbric]]|Interesting... I'll report this to [[Locus-Walker]].}}
:{{text|say|Magister Umbric|But for now, let us speak of your investigation.}}
:''They both take the [[Rift to Fathom's Edge]].''

Follow them to get to the quest area.

Interact with a void rift:
:{{text|bossemote|Pull the shadow tether away from the Unstable Void Rift to collapse it.}}

Do so, and don't get hit by orbs for a short runspeed buff to get to the next target.

==Progression==
