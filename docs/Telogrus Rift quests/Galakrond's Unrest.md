==Objectives==
Meet [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] at [[Galakrond's Rest]] in [[Dragonblight]].
*Take [[Rift to Northrend|Rift from Telogrus Rift to Northrend]]
*Speak to Alleria at Galakrond's Rest in Dragonblight.

==Description==
Galakrond's Rest. Where the [[Dark Heart]] was first empowered by [[Iridikron]]. We don't know what power the relic holds, but we do know that the Harbinger now wields it.

And now one of our [[Riftwalkers]] is missing, right where it all began.

I don't believe this is a coincidence, <name>. Let's travel to Northrend and search the area.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|80|90}}
* 5x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
Time to find [[Riftwalker Nilara|our Riftwalker]]. And, if we're lucky, discover a clue about the Dark Heart and this Harbinger who wields it.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Hm. The Riftwalker's absence... Could it be connected to the Dark Heart?}}
:''Alleria runs to a [[Rift to Northrend]].''

Follow her through to land in the [[Dragon Wastes]], south of [[Galakrond's Rest]]. Alleria has new gossip:

{{Dialogue|We know much about how the Dark Heart was created. But not so much what it actually is...

{{gossip|What are the Dark Heart's origins?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Dragonblight is the grave of Galakrond, a primal dragon who threatened to devour the world. He was defeated by the dragonflight Aspects before they had even been granted their power by the titans. This was millennia ago, of course.

Iridikron saw use in Galakrond's power. He allied himself with the Infinite Dragonflight and traveled to the point in time right after the primal dragon had been slain. It was then that Iridikron imbued a relic with that primal power using Galakrond's still-bleeding corpse. And so the Dark Heart was created...

We know the Dark Heart's origin, and the fact that it is now in the hands of the Harbinger. Now we just need to figure out what power it possesses, and what the Harbinger plans to do with it.

{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Play Scene from Dawn of the Infinite)}} Can you remind me how Iridikron empowered the Dark Heart?}}
{{Gossip|Tell me about something else.}}}}}}
