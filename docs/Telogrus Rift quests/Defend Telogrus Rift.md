==Objectives==
Defend Telogrus Rift.
* Defend [[Telogrus Rift]] (0/100%)

==Description==
No. Not the [[ren'dorei]]. Not Telogrus Rift. Not today.

<[[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] tightens her grip on her bow.>

These [[ethereal]] forces are the same we encountered in [[Ulduar]]. [[Xal'atath|The Harbinger]] must command them.

I'll go ahead. Engage the enemies here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
My people can defend themselves, but even they will struggle against such an overwhelming force. We must aid them.

==Completion==
There's no end to these [[Void-spawn|void spawn]]. But for now, we must turn our attention elsewhere.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|These invaders will find no mercy in my domain.}}
:''Alleria runs off.''

Fill the bar by closing [[Unstable Void Rift]]s, freeing [[Trapped Void Elf|trapped void elves]], and defeating enemies: [[Cosmic Ooze]]s, [[Shadowguard Phaseblade (Telogrus Rift)|Shadowguard Phaseblades]], [[Shadowguard Adept (Telogrus Rift)|Shadowguard Adepts]], [[Darklost Brute]]s, [[Modgud (Telogrus Rift)|Modgud]], [[Zan'do (Telogrus Rift)|Zan'do]], and [[Natalie Seline (Telogrus Rift)|Natalie Seline]].

Upon freeing [[Trapped Void Elf|trapped void elves]]:
*{{text|say|Trapped Void Elf|The horrors! The horrors--okay, I'm calm now.}}
*{{text|say|Trapped Void Elf|My gratitude! These ethereals are tricky foes.}}
*{{text|say|Trapped Void Elf|Who knew experiencing nothingness would be so cold...}}
*{{text|say|Trapped Void Elf|How long was I trapped? Felt like a second and forever.}}
*{{text|say|Trapped Void Elf|Never mind me. Telogrus Rift needs you!}}
*{{text|say|Trapped Void Elf|Thanks for the save! Entropy isn't exactly comfortable.}}
