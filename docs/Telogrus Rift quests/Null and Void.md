==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Corrupted Memory of Turalyon.jpg|Memory of Turalyon|A manifestation of [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]]'s worst nightmare, conjured by [[Xal'atath|the Harbinger]].}}
Defeat the Corrupted Memory of Turalyon in [[Telogrus Rift]].
* Rift to [[Equinox Reach]]
* Defeat [[Corrupted Memory of Turalyon]]

==Description==
We must defeat that loathsome apparition of Turalyon.

The abomination's presence is intolerable. If left unchecked, it may destroy what remains of Telogrus Rift.

I will end it with my own hands.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Bow of the Ranger Captain|id=438985|Acquire the appearance of Alleria's Bow.|icon=inv_bow_1h_artifactwindrunner_d_03}} ''(see [[Bow of the Ranger Captain]])''
*[[Arsenal: Voidtouched Weaponry]]

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|56|18}}
* 15x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
There was once a time when I wouldn't have hesitated. When I would have struck that apparition down with a clear heart. Even if it wore the face of my beloved.

But something changed. I changed...

Go. Speak with [[Locus-Walker]]. It seems he knows more than we do.

==Notes==
On accept, Alleria takes the Void Rift. Follow her.
