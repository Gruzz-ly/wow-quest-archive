==Objectives==
Gather reports from [[Riftwalkers]] in [[Telogrus Rift]].
* Report from [[Aberrus]] heard
* Report from [[Kalimdor]] heard
* Report from [[Eastern Kingdoms]] heard
*Deliver the reports to [[Magister Umbric]] on the [[Cosmic Horizon]].

==Description==
The Riftwalkers are tasked with investigating all void activity that appears on [[Azeroth]]. A most vital duty, given how dangerous this dark force can be. And I speak from experience.

Many of them were sent out on assignment to investigate recent fluctuations. I've been told they just arrived back, but have yet to hear their reports.

Would you check in on them while I speak with [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]]?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Let me know when you have those Riftwalker reports.

==Completion==
Thank you for gathering reports. Unfortunately, the Riftwalker from [[Northrend]] has yet to return.

She was investigating void activity in [[Galakrond's Rest]]. Given that location's connection to the [[Dark Heart]], I'd suggest you search for her.

Let's just hope our Riftwalker is still around to give you her report.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|There's something else. A vision is being seen all across Azeroth.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|They call it the [[Radiant Song]].}}
:{{text|say|Magister Umbric|Interesting... I'll report this to [[Locus-Walker]].}}
:{{text|say|Magister Umbric|But for now, let us speak of your investigation.}}
:''They both take the [[Rift to Fathom's Edge]].''

Follow them to get to the quest area.

{{dialogue|title=[[Riftwalker Tailos]]|Why I would love to philosophize about the nature of the Void, I'm afraid that I'm not used to catering towards... laymen.

I suspect you would find it rather difficult to keep up.}}
{{dialogue|title=[[Riftwalker Dellyn]]|I just returned from the [[Dragon Isles]].

{{gossip|quest=|What news do you have to report?}}}}
:{{text|say|Riftwalker Dellyn|There was a strange increase in void activity within Aberrus. We're still unsure what caused the surge.}}
:{{text|say|Riftwalker Dellyn|All quiet now, though.}}

Continue via the Void Rift to Cosmic Horizon.

{{dialogue|title=[[Riftwalker Tarrowyn]]|Personal reservoirs of hope and faith are strengthened, and one's capacity for greater good increases.}}
{{dialogue|title=[[Riftwalker Soran]]|I was asked to investigate Kalimdor.

{{gossip|quest=|What news do you have to report?}}}}

:{{text|say|Riftwalker Soran|I investigated void incursions along the southern coast.}}
:{{text|say|Riftwalker Soran|But any sign of battle had long passed when I arrived. Seems like a dead end.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Riftwalker Aderian]]|Everyone believes Alleria is Locus-Walker's best student, but she was merely his first. There are plenty who surpass her in that regard. Including yours truly.}}
{{dialogue|title=[[Riftwalker Orlis]]|I was following up on readings from the Eastern Kingdoms.

{{gossip|quest=|What news do you have to report?}}}}

:{{text|say|Riftwalker Orlis|Not much to report, I'm afraid.}}
:{{text|say|Riftwalker Orlis|I sensed activity to the north of the continent, but the trail went cold near [[Zul'Aman]].}}

Catch up with Umbric and Alleria:
:{{text|say|Magister Umbric|[[Riftwalker Nilara]] has yet to return from [[Northrend]]. Troubling.}}
