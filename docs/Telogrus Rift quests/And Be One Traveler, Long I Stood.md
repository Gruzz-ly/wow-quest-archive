==Objectives==
Investigate the final memory at the [[Triad's Conservatory]] in [[Eredath]].
* Memory of Turalyon confronted
* Follow Turalyon to Telogrus

==Description==
I sense another memory ahead.

While I'm loath to play along with the [[Xal'atath|Harbinger]]'s game, it's the only path forward for us.

Still, we have faced just as many dangerous memories as peaceful ones. Prepare yourself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|80|90}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
The Harbinger dares to use my people, my memories, my love against me?

Then she will know what it means to be my enemy.

==Notes==
On accept: 
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|This is a hunt. And our prey awaits with hungry jaws.}}

Head north into the building to find a [[memory of Alleria]] and [[Memory of Turalyon|Turalyon]]:
:{{text|say|Memory of Turalyon|I would rather have died than have you fall to evil.}}
:{{text|say|Memory of Alleria|I know. And yet my fate has not changed.}}
:{{text|say|The Harbinger|Ah. Your greatest regret. Let's bring it to life, shall we?}}
:{{text|emote|The Memory of Turalyon screams in agony.}}
:''Turalyon accepts Harbinger's Gift and strikes down the memory of Alleria.''
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|No! This isn't what happened!}}
:{{text|say|Memory of Turalyon|You have forsworn the Light, Alleria. And so you are my enemy.}}
:''The memory of Turalyon takes the [[Call of the Void]] portal to [[Telogrus Rift]].''
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|We must follow him!}}

Take the Call of the Void portal to follow him back to Telogrus.

==Trivia==
*The title of this quest is a line from {{Wp|Robert Frost}}'s poem "{{Wp|The Road Not Taken}}" (1915).
*Turalyon and Alleria's lines "I would rather have died than have you fall to evil." and "I know. And yet my fate has not changed." respectively are taken directly from the audiodrama [[A Thousand Years of War]].
