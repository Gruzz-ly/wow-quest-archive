==Objectives==
Follow [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] to [[Telogrus Rift]].
* Follow Alleria
* Use the Void Rift to enter Telogrus Rift

==Description==
;Non-void elves
:If this investigation involves the [[Void]], it would be wise to consult the [[Void elf|void elves]]. We must head to Telogrus Rift and report the situation.

:I'll speak with [[Umbric]]. He'll be able to mobilize the [[Riftwalkers]] to our cause.
;Void elves
:If this investigation involves the Void, it would be wise to consult your fellow ren'dorei. We must head to Telogrus Rift and report the situation.

:I will speak with Umbric. He'll be able to mobilize the Riftwalkers to our cause.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|80|90}}
* 5x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
We'll need to hear the Riftwalkers' reports before starting our own investigation. Perhaps there will be something that tells us where to begin.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I'll open a rift for us. Follow me.}}

Follow Alleria downstairs:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Head through when you're ready.}}
:''She opens a Rift to Telogrus.''

On the other side:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Have the ren'dorei noticed any void disturbances lately?}}
:{{text|say|Magister Umbric|We have. The Riftwalkers just returned from their investigations.}}

Umbric has gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=To non-void elf characters|The ren'dorei stand ready to protect [[Azeroth]] against the shadows.

{{gossip|Tell me more about yourself.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Once I was a [[magister]] of [[Quel'Thalas (kingdom)|Quel'Thalas]]. However, I and many others were exiled from [[Quel'Thalas|our homeland]] when we refused to stop our study of the Void.

Our research eventually led us to take on the forms we have now. And so we chose to call ourselves ren'dorei, void elves, and made a home within Telogrus Rift.

I both represent and help guide the ren'dorei, alongside Alleria.

{{Gossip|Tell me about something else.}}}}}}

{{Dialogue|title=To [[Void elf (playable)|void elf]] characters|
{{gossip|How are you doing, Magister Umbric?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
As well as can be expected, given our current circumstance. Telogrus Rift may not be a hospitable home, but we are settling in. And [[Locus-Walker]] has agreed to teach us the ways of the Void, helping many who struggle with their new powers. I would recommend attending one of his lectures, should you find the time.

And I'd like to thank you for your own efforts, <name>. Every feat of heroism you accomplish furthers Azeroth's view of we ren'dorei. One day, I hope we can be fully accepted by all. Perhaps even welcomed back to Quel'thalas...

<He smiles sadly.>

One day, perhaps.}}}}
