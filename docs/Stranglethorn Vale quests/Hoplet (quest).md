Ah, yes. I'm glad you finally showed up to take this package off my hands.

Our mutual friends wanted you to have this reward in exchange for a purchase you made. That's none of my business though. I'm just the delivery boy on this deal.

If you ever lose this item, come back and I'll give you a replacement, no charge.

;Innkeepers
Greetings <class>, I've been expecting you. An acquaintance of mine asked me to give you something when you stopped by. He mentioned something about a reward for a purchase you made from some mutual friends.

Maybe you know what he meant?

Anyway, here's your reward. Oh, one more thing. My acquaintance, Landro Longshot, said that if you ever lose this item, you can find him on the docks in [[Booty Bay]] to get a replacement.
