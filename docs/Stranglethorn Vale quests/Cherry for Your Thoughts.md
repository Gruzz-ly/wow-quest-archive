==Description==
You with the marshal? No, you don't look like it.

The rumors you've heard are only half true. Yes, we were pillaging [[human]] and [[Dwarf|dwarven]] camps, but we weren't doing it for the Horde. We were privately employed.

I'll tell ya the whole story if you buy me some grog.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1550 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How's that drink coming?

==Completion==
Ah, that's the stuff. Now, where was I?
