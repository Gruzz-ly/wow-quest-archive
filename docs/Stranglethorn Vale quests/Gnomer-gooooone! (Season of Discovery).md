==Objectives==
Wait for [[Scooty]] to calibrate the Goblin Transponder.
*[[Goblin Transponder]]

==Description==
As long as you have the transponder in your possession, all you need to do is step on the pad and you'll be teleported to [[Gnomeregan]].

You may experience some unusual side effects, but none of those should be permanent... anymore.

I almost forgot the most important part - getting back. When you're ready to come back, just step on the transpolyporter pad in Gnomeregan!

Now to calibrate the transponder to your size and weight. 

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|Goblin Transponder}}

==Completion==
All done! When you're ready, just step on the pad.
