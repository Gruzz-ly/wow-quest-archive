==Objectives==
Get a Crimson Trophy Quill from [[Gharrik]] in the {{C|Badlands}}. Then, return to [[Hemet Nesingwary]] in {{C|Stranglethorn Vale}}.
*[[Crimson Trophy Quill]]
*[[Empty Bait Cage]] (provided)

==Description==
This drawing reminds me of a story I'd heard on another expedition, not long ago. I was told of a great bird, Gharrik, who reigns over the Badlands as an apex predator. She was last spotted northeast of [[Camp Cagg]]. Perhaps her nest is somewhere nearby? You'll need live bait to draw her out. I'll lend you a cage to catch some. Small wildlife is scarce in the Badlands, so you'll need to find your bait elsewhere. A quill from Gharrik would make a fine prize. You'd certainly be the talk of the camp.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3150 [[XP]]
*{{cost||50}}
*[[Rune of Expose Weakness]]

==Progress==
How goes the hunt? Surely the bird hasn't got you beat!

==Completion==
Now there's a feather for your cap! Nicely done, <name>.

You can rest here for a while, if you like. I'm sure your trek through the desert was arduous.

==Notes==
The Crimson Trophy Quill can be acquired by either killing or [[Tame Beast|taming]] Gharrik.
