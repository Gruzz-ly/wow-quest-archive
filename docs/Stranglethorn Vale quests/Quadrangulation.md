==Objectives==
Find Wirdal Wondergear's Quadrangulation Beacons and attune with them. There are four of them and they are located somewhere in [[Kalimdor]].
*Quadrangulation Beacon 001 {{co|37|27|Tanaris (Classic)}}
*Quadrangulation Beacon 002 {{co|32|73|Desolace (Classic)}}
*Quadrangulation Beacon 003 {{co|29|94|Feralas (Classic)}}
*Quadrangulation Beacon 004 {{co|58|13|Dustwallow Marsh (Classic)}}

==Description==
Wirdal? Yeah I know him. He's a [[gnome]], but I won't hold that against him as a fellow transpolyportion enthusiast like myself. He took off outta here a few months back for somewhere in Kalimdor, but he 'ports in every now and then to grab supplies. I could probably transpolyport you to him, but you'd need his coordinates or I'd probably just teleport you into a mountain or something. If you can find his quadrangulation beacons in Kalimdor and attuned to them, that would do the trick!

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Wow, you found 'em. Give me a second to plug in the coordinates and calibrate the transponder....

... and there we go! I think that should do the trick.
