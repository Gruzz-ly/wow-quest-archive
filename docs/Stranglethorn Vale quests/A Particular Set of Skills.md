==Objectives==
Find a way to get into {{Sod|Blackwing Lair}} and speak with [[Master Elemental Shaper Krixix]] without engaging him in combat.
*[[Hardened Elementium Slag]] (provided)

==Description==
Krixix is a genius for sure, but he may not be too friendly if you just storm into [[Blackrock Mountain|that mountain]] demanding his help, to say nothing of the goons that place is likely crawling with. You'll probably want to find a way to get to him without burning the place down along the way which is likely to be pretty tricky.

If you can figure out a way to get in there without stabbing, shocking, or burning anyone that is probably a good start. I've got no real ideas myself on how to do that though, so good luck!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||70}}
*6600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Shouldn't you be working,  bub?

==Completion==
Whaddya want, can't you see I'm busy here? Wait, where'd you get that hunk of slag? I swear if those half-wit gobs down in the lab are being wasteful with my product, I'm gonna lose it!

Yeah yeah, I'm sure I could make it into something good for you, but I'm behind schedule and Vick ain't known for his patience. Now, unless you can help me clone myself or grow a bunch of extra arms, beat it. I got work to do.

==Notes==
Reaching Krixix without entering combat requires using the [[Supercharged Gobmogrifier]], purchased from [[Pix Xizzix]] for {{costitem|50|Tarnished Undermine Real}}. Make sure to use while while in [[Blackrock Mountain]], before entering the instance.

==Progression==
{{Heavy Metal}}
