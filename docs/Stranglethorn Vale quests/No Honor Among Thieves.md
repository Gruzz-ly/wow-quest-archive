==Objectives==
Find Illari Duskfeather, near {{C|Arathi Highlands}}, and get access to her cache of stolen loot.
*Found [[Illari Duskfeather]]
*[[Illari's Key]]

==Description==
As I was saying...

Our boss wasn't with the [[Horde]]. She was a [[night elf]] named Illari Duskfeather. She gave us intel on the camps, and even let us keep most of the loot. She only kept a few of the rarer finds.

Once the Marshal was on our tail, though, she left us for dead. I don't know her motives, but I think we were set up as patsies.

I'm not the vengeful type, but I won't stop someone else from hunting her down. If you're looking for her, she once mentioned a hideout somewhere near Arathi.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3150 [[XP]]
*{{cost||50}}
*[[Jewel-Encrusted Box]]

==Progress==
<Using Illari's key, you unlock the cache.>

==Completion==
<Inside of the cache, you find a small box, along with some coin.>

==Notes==
Illari will attack Horde characters immediately upon speaking with her. She will have additional dialogue for Alliance characters, though she will still attack upon concluding the dialogue. The key will be found in a [[Dropped Pouch]] after defeating her. Night elf characters, however, will have the option to sympathize with her instead, and receive the key without a fight.

==Progression==
