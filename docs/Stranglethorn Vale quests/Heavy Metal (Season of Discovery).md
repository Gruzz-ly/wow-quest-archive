==Objectives==
Find someone who can work with exotic metals and is willing to help you crate{{sic}} something special with this chunk of [[elementium]].
*[[Hardened Elementium Slag]] (provided)

==Description==
The large flat disc of elementium you hold before you seems to thrum with [[elemental]] energy. When you hold it you can almost hear the elemental spirits whispering to you. You aren't sure what use you can find for this, but the connection you feel to it is instantaneous.

With a little work from a sufficiently talented [[smith]] able to work with the mysterious metal known as elementium, you suspect that this could be made into a weapon or piece of armor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||70}}
*6600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What's that you've got there?

==Completion==
Wow! That's quite the hunk of metal you got there, shaman.

Elementium you say? How'd ya get your mitts on something like this? Actually, it's probably better if I don't know. Anyway, I know a guy who might be able to help you make something good with it. Name's [[Krixix]]. Last I heard he was working up in [[Master Elemental Shaper Krixix|Blackrock Mountain]] for a guy named, uh, [[Nefarian|Vick]] I think. Not sure what they got him doing but they aren't exactly knitting sweaters up in that mountain, if you catch my drift.
