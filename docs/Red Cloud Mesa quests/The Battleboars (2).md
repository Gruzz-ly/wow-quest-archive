== Objectives ==
Kill 10 Armored Battleboars.
* [[Armored Battleboar]] slain (10)

== Description ==
There are more threats to be dealt with here. The [[Bristleback tribe|Bristleback]] are taming wild [[boar]]s to be used against us.

These armored battleboars have been abused beyond hope of recovery; they must be put down, for our safety and their peace. Go to [[Battleboar Pen|the pens to the south]] and slay them, <name>. Return to me afterwards.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Scarred Battleboar Chest
|Braided Boarskin Belt
|Scarred Battleboar Breastplate
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

== Progress ==
I can still see many of them from here, <name>. More should fall.

== Completion ==
Good work, <name>. Those beasts could have been a greater threat than the quilboar themselves, if we had not taken action now.

== Notes ==
This quest should be done at the same time as [[Feed of Evil]].

Burning the troughs for the quest [[Feed of Evil]] usually kills several boars, effectively reducing the amount of boars you'll need to kill.
