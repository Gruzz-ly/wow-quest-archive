== Objectives ==
Drink the Water of Vision.
* [[Water of Vision]] (provided)

==Description==
Look, <name>. The rolling plains of [[Mulgore]] stretch before you: our home, the cradle of the [[Earth Mother]]. Here she provides us with all we could ever need, a peaceful and verdant land. This is what you will fight to protect.

Your journey will take you far beyond her sheltering arms, to the farthest and cruelest regions of this world, and beyond.

Below us is [[Bloodhoof Village]]. The first step on your true path begins now. Drink deep of the Water of Vision, and let the spirits guide you onward.

==Completion==
Welcome to Bloodhoof Village, hero. I am glad the spirits have guided you safely here.

==Notes==
Drinking the Water of Vision next to the quest giver transports you to Bloodhoof Village. New quests await!
