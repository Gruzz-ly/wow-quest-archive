== Objectives ==
Open 4 [[Quilboar Cage]]s.
* [[Captured Brave|Braves]] Freed (4)

== Description ==
Despite their size, the [[Bristleback tribe|Bristleback]] greatly outnumber us. A pack ambush can easily overwhelm even the largest tauren.

Many new initiates have taken up arms to defend our home. Some have given their lives, but others have been captured alive.

Please, find their cages and free them. The battle should keep the [[quilboar]] distracted.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Red Cloud Gloves
|Quill Impaled Boots
|Red Cloud Handwraps
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

== Progress ==
Not enough have returned, <name>. Return and free more of our people. Be brave!

== Completion ==
Thanks to you, our people are free to fight for our home.

==Notes==
After a cage is opened, a Captured Brave will emerge and speak one of the following.
:{{text|say|Captured Brave|I can move again!}}
:{{text|say|Captured Brave|Thank the Earth Mother!}}

The Captured Brave will then run off and despawn.
