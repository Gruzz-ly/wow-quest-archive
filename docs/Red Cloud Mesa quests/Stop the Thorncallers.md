== Objectives ==
Kill 7 Bristleback Thorncallers.
* [[Bristleback Thorncaller]] slain (7)

== Description ==
Knowing the ways of your prey is another aspect of the hunt. In the lands they come from, [[quilboar]] live in the shade and protection of huge thorned roots. When they move, their shamans seed and grow new roots for them to live in.

These thorns mar the land and choke out other life, turning the earth around them barren. Go to the south and stop these thorncallers before they have a chance to continue, <name>.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Thorn-Proof Wristguard
|Thorncaller Trousers
|Thorned Cinch
|Thorned Links
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

== Progress ==
The roots still thrive. You must stop as many of the thorncallers as you can.

== Completion ==
With the corruptors slain, the Earth Mother will mend her own wounds in due time. The roots are not meant to thrive here, and will wither. Balance will return.
