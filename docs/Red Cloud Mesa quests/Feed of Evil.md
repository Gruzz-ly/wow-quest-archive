==Objectives==
Use Adana's Torch to set fire to all 3 Troughs in the [[Battleboar Pen]]s.
* First Trough
* Second Trough
* Third Trough
* [[Adana's Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
We must do more than simply hunt [[boar]]s here. The eyesore that has been left upon the land must be purged.

To give them a wild thirst for blood, the battleboars are force-fed raw flesh. Take this torch, and use it to burn the troughs of meat and gore to cinders.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||75}}

==Progress==
Have all the troughs been burned?

==Completion==
You've not only wiped the boar pens clean, but put a stop to a horrible desecration. Well done.

==Notes==
This quest should be done at the same time as [[The Battleboars (2)]].

Burning the troughs usually kills several boars, effectively reducing the amount of boars you'll need to kill for [[The Battleboars (2)|The Battleboars]].
