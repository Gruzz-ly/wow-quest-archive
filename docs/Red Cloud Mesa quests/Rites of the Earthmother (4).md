==Objectives==
Speak to [[Dyami Windsoar]] atop [[Fargaze Mesa]].

==Description==
Today, you have undertaken a rite of passage far more difficult than we ask of most of our youths. Be proud. Now, it is time for you to continue on your journey.

To the west, beyond our burial ground, you will find a path winding up the mesa. Follow it to the top, and speak with [[Dyami Windsoar]].

Walk with the [[Earth Mother]], friend. You will always be welcome here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 150 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Completion==
If you are prepared to leave [[Camp Narache]] behind, I will help call the spirits to guide you onwards.
