==Objectives==
Use the Ceremonial Offering at [[Greatmother Hawkwind]]'s grave.
* Offering Placed
* [[Water Pitcher (2)]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Camp Narache|camp]] is safe, and the [[quilboar]] driven off, all thanks to you, young one. You have my personal thanks for what you have done for [[Greatmother Hawkwind|my mother]], [[Grull Hawkwind|my son]], and for all of us.

It is now time to put Greatmother Hawkwind to rest. Lay the final offering at her feet, <name>, and we will say our goodbyes.

==Progress==
Do not be shy, <name>. I am honored to have you lay the final offering.

==Completion==
There is balance in all things. As Greatmother Hawkwind's spirit takes its final journey, you will begin your first.

==Notes==
Upon accepting the quest:
:{{text|say|Chief Hawkwind|Earth Mother, into your arms we give one of our own. She is Unaya Hawkwind, my mother, and Greatmother to us all; the wisest of our tribe.}}
:{{text|say|Chief Hawkwind|May her spirit fly to you swiftly; may the winds carry her gently, and the grass whisper her name.}}
:{{text|say|Chief Hawkwind|Watch over her as she has watched over us; let her look down on us with joy, through the eternal gaze of An'she and Mu'sha, until we too join her in death.}}
:{{text|say|Chief Hawkwind|For we are all born of you, and shall all return to you.}}
