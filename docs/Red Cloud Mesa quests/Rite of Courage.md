== Objectives ==
Recover 7 Stolen Rifles from [[Bristleback Gun Thief|Bristleback Gun Thieves]].
* [[Stolen Rifle]] (7)

== Description ==
One of the first lessons you should learn, <name>, is to never underestimate your prey.

While we were distracted by the attack on [[Camp Narache]], more of the [[Bristleback tribe|Bristleback]] swept in unnoticed and stole a cache of our rifles. You can see them to the south now, filling the air with lead.

This is your Rite of Courage: brave the hail of gunfire, hunt the Bristleback gun thieves, and bring back our rifles.
