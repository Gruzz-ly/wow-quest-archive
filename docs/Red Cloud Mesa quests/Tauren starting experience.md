The '''[[Tauren (playable)|tauren]]''' starting experience takes place on Red Cloud Mesa, in southern [[Mulgore]]. Players are immediately thrust into battle against the [[quilboar]] who are mere days away from taking Camp Narache. Working with [[Grull Hawkwind]] and [[Adana Thunderhorn]], players slay quilboar, rescue tauren captives, return stolen weapons and prevent the quilboar from using a special weapon, the battleboars, among other things. On the way, players complete their Rite of Strength by slaying quilboar, their Rite of Courage by recovering stolen rifles, and their Rite of Honor by slaying [[Chief Squealer Thornmantle]]. The Red Cloud Mesa ends with the quest [[Rite of the Winds]] which transports players to Bloodhoof Village.
