;On the ship, Talanji has new Gossip

De goblins assure me dis plan will work... which is why I need you here to make sure it does. 
You ready to take a ride down de river?

;Talk to Patch

You here for the A.M.O.D., yeah? 
Well, let's get going. The sooner we're outta here, the better. 
I'll be piloting this thing. You see anything bad, you just shout and I'll shoot. 
You ready to go?

{{gossip|I'm ready, let's hop on this barge and get back to Zul'jan.}}

Patch says: We're gonna load this thing up, row ourselves into that river, and blow us up some trolls. Who's ready for a good time, eh?

Princess Talanji says: Let us hope Rokhan and de others make it back safely to Zul'jan... otherwise dis will be a very short trip.

Patch says: Rokhan's been around for a long time, Princess. He ain't gonna die to some blood trolls! 

Princess Talanji says: Look! Blood trolls! Dey must be preparing to attack.

Princess Talanji says: Take out those blood trolls! We cannot let dem sink our barge! 

Patch says: Terrible swamp you all got here. Would be real nice if somethin' happened to it!

Princess Talanji says: Undead! Dey are marching toward Zuldazar. We must destroy dem! 

Ticker says: Whoa whoa WHOA! Nobody said we'd have to deal with undead! 

Patch says: We WORK with undead all the time, you idiot!

Newt says: Uh, boss. I believe the technical term is "Forsaken".

Patch says: Eh, Princess, I ain't no expert, but I think you guys got a blood troll problem. 

Princess Talanji says: I am glad you recognize dat, Patch. You are a step ahead of my father.

Newt says: We got a BIG problem here!

Patch says: This thing ain't a problem, we just gotta use the ol' curveball!  

Ticker savs: Oh!  Curveball!  Curveball!  Newt says: Curveball!  Curveball! 

Patch says: YEAH!  CURVEBALL!  

Princess Talanji says: We seem to be in de clear now.  We will need to move fast once we land at Zul'ian ruins. 

Patch says: Got it, Princess.  You're about to get a front row seat to the latest and greatest of goblin technology!

Newt says: Uh, boss... we got some screws missin' in places that the manual clearly says require screws. 

Patch says: Oh, well, yeah... user manuals are for schmucks. Newt, we're doing this live! 

Princess Talanji says: Rokhan! Are you alright? It seems a battle happened here. 

Rokhan says: Aye, dem blood trolls be battlin' it out wit' da guards as we arrived. Dey weren't expectin' us ta attack from da rear.
