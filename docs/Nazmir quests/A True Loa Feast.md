==Objectives==
Kill beasts for their [[meat]] in the [[Upper Frogmarsh]] in [[Nazmir]].
* [[Chunky Meat]] (35)

==Description==
The [[blood troll]] attacks have not stopped until now. They have weakened me significantly and I need to get my strength back. My followers used to bring me offerings of meat from the nearby lands.

Go and bring back a mighty feast. My strength will return and we will stop these attacks once and for all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Progress==
I hunger.

==Completion==
<Krag'wa consumes all of the meat in a couple of gulps.> Yes! I have been hungry for so long. As my followers died, my hunger increased.

Perhaps when more come to follow, eating will once again be just an enjoyable pastime.
