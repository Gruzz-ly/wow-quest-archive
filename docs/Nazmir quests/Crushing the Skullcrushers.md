==Objectives==
Kill 4 Blood Skullcrushers.
* [[Loa-Gutter Skullcrusher]] slain (4)

==Description==
Look, <name>, I'll be happy once we've killed this [[Jungo|herald]] and we can have things go back to normal.

Until then, you need to deal with these monstrous [[blood troll]]s called "skullcrushers". Lovely, right?

As far as I can tell, these things have some sort of connection to this herald, might be why they're so huge.

You kill these skullcrushers and maybe we weaken this herald a bit more. Or maybe it gets even angrier and kills us all. 

We'll have to see.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Talanji's Expedition]]
* +250 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Those skullcrushers aren't going to kill themselves.

==Completion==
[[Princess Talanji]] was saying something about feeling the [[blood magic]] dissipating from inside of [[Torga]]. I sure hope she's right.

==Progression==
