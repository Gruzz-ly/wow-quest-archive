==Objectives==
Meet [[Brann Bronzebeard]] at [[Zul'Nazman]] in [[Nazmir]].

==Description==
Not sure if I like this [["Silvermoon" Harry|Harry]] fella. He's growin' on me, though. Got some wild ideas about the [[blood elf|blood elves]], but he's not all bad.

What were we talkin' about? Ah, right.

[[Captain Conrad]]. He said the Captain went to Zul'Nazman ta commune with the [[blood troll]]s there. Seems... less than well planned.

Let's go see what there is to see, shall we?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm startin' to believe we're on a [[corpse running|corpse run]] here. Can't imagine we'll find the famous Captain Conrad alive at this point.

==Notes==
Upon accept, Brann starts running westward. Follow suit and find him in [[Koramar]]{{Co|49.96|50.90|Nazmir}}.

==Progression==
{{Nazmir Foothold}}

==Patch changes==
