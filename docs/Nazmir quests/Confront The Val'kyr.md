==Objectives==
Escort the Spirit of Vol'jin to Eyir.
* Escort the [[Vol'jin|Spirit of Vol'jin]] to [[Eyir]]

==Description==
[[Vol'jin]]'s [[Ghost|spirit]] is growing in power. I should no longer have to maintain a ritual to keep him here.

Dis is fortunate, since [[Bwonsamdi]] warned me dat Eyir will likely not be pleased with my presence. Apparently she and Bwonsamdi have a past de [[loa]] was unwilling to discuss.

We can proceed when you are ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]
* +250 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
[[Val'kyr]] pulled many of da Horde heroes from da [[Battle for the Broken Shore|battle of the Broken Shore]]. Though somehow, I don't think dey were workin' for da same master.

==Completion==
Ah... Eyir. Lots of anger and pride in dat one. She not be speakin' ta me for centuries now. I thought for sure she be da one behind Vol'jin's return.

==Notes==
Speak with Talanji:
:Dere are a lot of val'kyr between us and Eyir, and I suspect dey do not wish us to pass.

:{{Gossip|I am ready.}}

Escort Vol'jin to Eyir with Talanji and [[Baine Bloodhoof]]. Hostile [[Chosen of Eyir]] bar the path.
:{{text|yell|Eyir|Minions of the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Banshee Queen]], leave this place or die.}}
:{{text|yell|Eyir|Hold... you DARE bring a priestess of Bwonsamdi into MY halls?}}
:''Vol'jin walks to Eyir alone. Talanji and Baine go out of the hall gate.''
:{{text|say|Spirit of Vol'jin|Eyir, speak with me if da others not be to your liking.}}
:{{text|say|Eyir|Hmm. Very well. You and [[adventurer|your champion]] may approach. But know that deception will be met with destruction.}}
:''Vol'jin stops in front of Eyir.''
:{{text|say|Spirit of Vol'jin|Queen of da val'kyr. My spirit was sent to da [[Shadowlands|Other Side]], den returned. Was dis your doing?}}
:{{text|say|Eyir|[[Shadow hunter]], you are no longer a mere spirit. What you have become is something beyond my power to forge.}}
:{{text|say|Spirit of Vol'jin|Who be havin' such power? Could it be da same one who bid me ta name [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] [[warchief]]?}}
:{{text|say|Eyir|You have been touched by the hand of valor. Such a noble force does not scheme for mortal thrones.}}
:{{text|say|Spirit of Vol'jin|So whoever whispered to me's not da same as who sent me back?}}
:{{text|say|Eyir|You have been granted all the knowledge I am willing to share. Leave now, and never return.}}
The Chosen Val'kyr are now neutral. Leave [[Skold-Ashil]] through [[Bwondsamdi's Death Gate|Bwonsamdi's death gate]].
