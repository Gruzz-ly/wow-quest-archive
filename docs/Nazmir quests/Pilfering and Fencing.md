==Objectives==
Collect 20 Ancient Titan Relics from the [[naga]] at the [[Sundered Span]]{{sic}}
*[[Ancient Titan Relics]] (20)

==Description==
Our [[ship]]s are sunk. Our [[A.M.O.D.]]'s gone. We've lost a LOT on this mission... and the [[Bilgewater Cartel]] don't offer insurance. The debt collectors will be all over us! We gotta make up for these losses.

The beach is swarmin' with naga tryin' to collect artifacts from the ruins. How 'bout we grab some of that treasure and make back our money? I'm sure we could find a buyer willing to take 'em off our hands.

We'll split the proceeds 80/20. Sounds fair to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Progress==
Got anything for me?

==Completion==
Nice haul! This should keep the cartel off our backs.

==Notes==
:{{Text|Say|[[Ticker]]|Only 80 percent? You coulda gone WAY higher! Where's the greed?}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Newt]]|C'mon, 80 percent is plenty. Why push it and risk blowin' the deal?}}
:{{Text|Say|Ticker|There's no thrill without the risk! Geez, you really need to do more gamblin'.}}

==Progression==
{{Bring the Boom}}
