==Objectives==
Use the Scroll of Fate's Hand to summon the Hand of Fate to destroy 50 undead along the Blood Coast.
* [[Hand of Fate]] summoned in [[Blood Coast]]
* [[Undead]] destroyed (50)
* [[Scroll of Fate's Hand (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
I got some good news and bad news for you about this whole quest to destroy the [[Jungo|herald]] of [[G'huun]]. Bad news first.

There's an entire army of [[skeleton]]s between us and the next area. I'm guessing they used [[Torga]]'s blood to animate them.

Good news is that scroll you recovered from [[Holbruk]] can summon the powerful Hand of Fate.

...and the bad news is that the scroll got damaged when Holbruk died and is only good for one more use.

Meh. Take this scroll and destroy that skeleton army!

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*[[Band of Destiny]]
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Talanji's Expedition]]
* +250 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Completion==
I saw the destruction from here! Hrm, maybe I should try to fix that scroll up, you know, for future use.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|We had best move on and see what else de blood trolls are doing up ahead.}}
:{{text|say|Lashk|You know, I think we might actually kill this herald of G'huun.}}
:{{text|say|Kisha|This has the makings of the best story ever experienced by a [[tortollan]]. Avenging a [[loa]] and killing the avatar of some monster!}}

Head back to the [[Blood Coast]] and use the Scroll of Fate's Hand [[Extra Action Button|extra action button]] to take control of the [[Hand of Fate]] vehicle with the following abilities:
#{{Abilities|Uppercut of Fate|id=259747|Uppercut any enemies infront{{sic}} of you, knocking them into the air and killing them.|icon=ability_rogue_kidneyshot}}
#{{Abilities|Beckon the Hand of Fate|id=259769|The Hand of Fate performs a random attack on all nearby enemies. Know that the Hand of Fate cannot be forced.|icon=ability_bossfelmagnaron_hand}}
#{{Abilities|Refreshment of Fate|id=259794|Fully heals the Hand of Fate.|icon=inv_firstaid_bandage2}}

Use them to kill [[Enslaved Remains]], [[Reanimated Horror]]s, and [[Loa-Gutter Summoner]]s in the area.

Finishing the objective:
:{{text|say|Hand of Fate|THE HAND OF FATE HAS BEEN SATED, I SHALL DELIVER YOU TO SAFETY. FATE IS SOMETIMES KIND.}}
:''It proceeds to run where Princess Talanji, Lashk, and Kisha are located in [[Torga's Rest]].''
