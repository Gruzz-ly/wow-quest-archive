==Objectives==
Obtain the Scepter of Rebirth and use it to perform the Rite of [[Krag'wa]] Ritual upon [[Witch Doctor Zentimo|Zentimo]].
* [[Scepter of Rebirth]]
* [[Witch Doctor Zentimo|Ritual performed]]

==Description==
I am Krag'wa, the once mighty. Curse the [[blood troll]]s and their [[G'huun|dark god]]! They have slain my worshippers until only Zentimo remained, and now even he is gone.

I want revenge on the blood trolls, but first I must honor the last of my [[witch doctor]]s. As I have no others, I must request you perform the ritual.

Then we can talk of revenge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Progress==
Zentimo must be honored.

==Completion==
Your ritual was done well.

With your help, I will not be fed to the blood trolls' god. It is I who will do the eating!
