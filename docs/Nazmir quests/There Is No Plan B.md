==Objectives==
Locate all parts of the [[A.M.O.D.]]
* [[Damaged A.M.O.D. Barrel]]
* [[Broken Elevating Gears]]
* [[Shattered Firing Mechanism]]

==Description==
Look, I'll be honest with you. Our mech, the A.M.O.D., was the best we've ever made. It was mobile. It was powerful. It was one of a kind! 

What I'm trying to say is, without it, our whole plan is ruined! We have to salvage and rebuild it!

That big oaf of a [[sea giant]] broke the A.M.O.D. apart and scattered its pieces all over the shore. Find its parts and I'll try to hammer them back together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Progress==
Got those parts yet?

==Completion==
Looks like you've got everything, well... we've got the important stuff at least. Now we've got a big repair job to do.

==Progression==
{{Bring the Boom}}

==Patch changes==
