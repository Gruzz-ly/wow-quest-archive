==Objectives==
Recover [[Chadwick Paxton]]'s legs.
*[[Paxton's Legs|Chadwick Paxton's legs]] recovered
*Chadwick Paxton fixed

==Description==
I seem to be in a bit of a... predicament.

My squad was scouting on behalf of [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Lady Sylvanas]] when we were ambushed by some snake men calling themselves "[[sethrak]]".

As you can see, my legs have been separated from my body in the ambush. It's just a flesh wound, luckily.

Care to help me get re-attached? Then we can get down to this business of vengeance against these sethrak.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
Care to give me a hand? Well, specifically, my leg, my hands are just fine.

==Completion==
That feels a lot better, I think. Time to get down to the business of some proper revenge.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Chadwick Paxton|Just be gentle when you get my legs, they tend to wiggle when they get detatched{{sic}}.}}

Fixing Chadwick Paxton:
:{{gossip|Alright, I've got your... legs. What next?}}
:{{text|say|Chadwick Paxton|Just jam that one part in...}}
:{{text|say|Chadwick Paxton|There! Not too bad, have you done this before?}}

==Trivia==
*The item [[Chadwick Paxton's Legs]] was seemingly planned to be part of the quest.

==Progression==
{{Sethrak Front}}
