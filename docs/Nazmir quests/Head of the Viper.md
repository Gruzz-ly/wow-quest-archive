{{questportrait|Lord Slithin.jpg|Lord Slithin|This one's for the "Libation."}}

==Description==
While I was scouting out the area, I saw a big armored [[naga]] bossing the rest of the [[Naga|snakes]] around. Call it a hunch, but I'm pretty sure he's their leader.

As long as the Naga have a [[commander (rank)|commander]] our operations here will be threatened. Take him out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Progress==
How you holding up?

==Completion==
Good job, that should take some of the heat off us.
