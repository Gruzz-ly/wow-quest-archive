==Objectives==
Kill 12 [[Horde]] [[soldier]]s within the [[Necropolis (Nazmir)|Necropolis]].
* Horde soldiers slain (12)

==Description==
Can't believe the Horde already have a foothold in the Necropolis. We have to stop them.

This one's simple. Kill as many Horde as you find in that cursed place, but keep your eye out for a fella named [[Bwonsamdi]].

Seems like he's some sort of death god. He's way beyond anything we can handle, but why not send a few of his followers his way?

Better they rot in his necropolis than bother the living.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
What else do you need to know?

==Completion==
Good, less Horde for us to deal with in this cursed place.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Darkspear Hunter]]s, [[Horde Shaman]], and [[Horde Warbringer (War Campaign)|Horde Warbringers]].

During the quest, the player has the Sentinel Support buff, which summons [[Sentinel Aeolyn]] to heal you.
