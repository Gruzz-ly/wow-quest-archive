==Objectives==
Defeat Urok.
*[[Urok (devilsaur)|Urok]] slain

==Description==
{{Questportrait|image=Urok (devilsaur).jpg|name=Urok|text=Help Sur'jan put down Urok for good!}}
This is it! My power is back; we are ready to put down Urok. He used to be a noble beast, you know. Big, strong.

Now Urok is just a mindless [[undead]]. It isn't right. We'll put him to rest.

I'm going to run up ahead. When you get near Urok, I'll hop out to ambush him. Let's do dis!

Shut up, [[Sur'jan]]. Of course we're going to win! If we don't, I'll just find another <class> to help me out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Completion==
We did it! Urok is gone for good. It was a shame to put him down, but dat sort of creature isn't supposed to be.

I have lots of other things to do, like finding de two other [[troll]]s out here and killing dem.

What do you think, Sur'jan? Should I tell him? No? Okay, fine.

I'll be seeing you. Oh, and don't stay in [[Nazmir]]. Only crazy people come here.
