==Objectives==
Recover 6 Parts of [[Torga]] from the [[blood troll]]s.
* [[Parts of Torga]] (6)

==Description==
[[Princess Talanji]] thinks we're almost ready to kill this [[Jungo|herald]] of [[G'huun]]. Maybe she's right, maybe we're all dead, who knows?

What I do know is the blood trolls here are... are carving and carrying away parts of Torga. Ugh!

From what I can tell, they're using poor Torga's meat to power their blood rituals. This has to stop!

Go out there and steal those pieces of [[meat]] from the blood trolls. I'll figure out a way to dispose of it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Talanji's Expedition]]
* +250 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
You... get that [[loa]] meat yet?

==Completion==
This is no way for Torga's remains to be treated, <name>. I'll make sure this is properly destroyed.

==Progression==
