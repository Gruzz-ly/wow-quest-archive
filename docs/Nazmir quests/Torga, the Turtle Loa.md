==Objectives==
Follow the [[tortollan]] pilgrimage path to reach [[Torga]], [[loa]] of the [[turtle]]s.
* Meet [[Kisha]]
* [[Torga]] located

==Description==
Name's [[Lashk]]. We're not here to join any cause, we just want to hear Torga's legendary stories.

I don't know if he'll help, but you can try persuading Torga, loa of the turtles, and see if he'll help you fight these [[blood troll]]s.

You can join on our pilgrimage to Torga, just keep quiet. Follow the path and find Kisha, she'll tell you where to go.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Dis is de work of de blood trolls, I am certain of it. We will get to de bottom of dis.

==Notes==
Before accepting the quest, Lashk has the following gossip:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|Tell me about this pilgrimage you're on.}}

Well, I didn't think you cared! Where to begin?

We make this pilgrimage to Nazmir every few years. Sometimes it's five years, other times it could be twenty, all depends on when Torga's ready to tell a tale.

We hear whispers and rumors that Torga has stories to pass on to us, and that's when we begin our pilgrimage. We come here, sit down, and listen to every story Torga has to say, then we pass those stories along to anyone else we meet.

You should count yourself lucky. It's rare to see so many of us gathered together like this. That's a story in itself if any of your orc friends care.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Rokhan|My shadow hunters and I gonna scout ahead. <Name>, I be trustin' ya ta guard da princess.}}
:''Rokhan runs off. All the tortollans proceed as Lashk and Talanji does.''
:{{text|say|Lashk|All right, then. Let's be off to see Torga. But, just remember to keep the noise down. I don't want to miss even one of his stories!}}
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|Dis is not de first time I have dealth with you old tortollans... and your endless stories. Remain focused and keep walking!}}
:{{text|say|Lashk|Well, I think we'll get along just fine, Princess.}}

Meeting up with Kisha, speak with them:
{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|
What do you want? Can't you see I'm in the middle of pilgriming?

*{{Gossip|Lashk said you could tell me where I can find Torga.}}
*{{Gossip|"Pilgriming"? You're just standing around! Lashk said you knew where to find Torga.}}
}}

Selecting the first option:
:{{text|say|Kisha|Bah! What do I look like, a tour guide? I'm just here to listen to Torga's tales.}}

Selecting the second option:
:''Kisha proceeds to walk forward then back to their original spot.''
:{{text|say|Kisha|I'm just standing here? Okay... how's this? Does this count as pilgrimming?}}
:{{text|say|Kisha|Happy now? Am I moving around enough for you?}}

Both options afterwards:
:{{text|say|Kisha|Look, just keep going down this road, don't wander off, and you'll find Torga. He's a giant turtle... hard to miss.}}
:{{text|say|Kisha|I might as well get moving before someone else comes along asking for directions.}}
:''Kisha proceeds down the path towards where Torga is supposedly.''

Approaching Torga, a group of Tortollans up on the path overlooking the deceased [[loa]]:
:{{text|yell|Tortollan Warrior|How could this have happened?}}
