==Objectives==
Meet [[Hexlord Raal]] in [[Nazmir]].

==Description==
We can handle de rest of de [[Alliance]]. I received a report that Hexlord Raal's forces are having issues up ahead.

He claims dat dere is an even thicker fog enveloping Nazmir. De Alliance must be using some tricks to slow us down.

Go to Nazmir to see what can be done to help Hexlord Raal. We must reach dat fleet and destroy de Alliance!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I wish I had better news to tell you and [[Princess Talanji]].

==Notes==
;On accept
:''Talanji and Rokhan mount and leave for Nazmir.''
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|Come! We ride for Nazmir to bring an end to dis madness.}}

Dead blood trolls are found along the way and in the Fallen Outpost. There, Raal, Talanji, [[Nathanos]], [[Rokhan]], and [[Patch (goblin)|Patch]] are standing next to [[Broken A.F.M.O.D.]]. They are flanked by [[Grounded Pterrordax]]es.

;On approach
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|Explain yourselves. We have two armies sitting around instead of attacking de Alliance.}}
:{{Text|say|Hexlord Raal|We cannot fly through dis fog, we have already lost several warriors to it. De Alliance are trying to delay our attack!}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|And the Alliance dogs have the area trapped. We cannot march our army through here.}}
:{{Text|say|Patch|We got a way to solve all of this, Princess. The A.F.M.O.D.! ... but the Alliance roughed it up and stole a bunch of its parts.}}
:{{Text|say|Patch|But if you can rescue my crew and get the parts back, I can have this thing fixed in no time to take back our stuff!}}

==Progression==
{{Fly Out to Meet Them}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.1.0|note=Added.}}
