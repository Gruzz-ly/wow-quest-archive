==Objectives==
Mark 3 areas within [[Zalamar]] for [[mole machine]]s to appear.
* [[Dark Iron Mole Machine (Nazmir)|Mole machines]] signalled (3)

==Description==
We have some additional support for our plan to deceive the [[Horde]] and assault the [[Blood Gate]]s, but we need your help.

The [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron dwarves]] have several mole machines waiting to erupt and supply fresh troops.

I've determined several spots within Zalamar that would be perfect for them to use.

Take this device and plant it in the following areas. It will send a message to the Dark Iron dwarves to erupt from there.

They will stay safely in their machines until our army arrives.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
*[[Glowing Azerite Crystal]] (250x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
There's no time to lose, <name>.

==Completion==
Excellent! We are one more step closer to purging the Horde.

==Notes==
*When a mole machine is signaled, it will appear and a Dark Iron Shaman will exit to join you for a time.
