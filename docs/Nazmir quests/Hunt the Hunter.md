{{questportrait|Warmother Boatema.jpg|Warmother Boatema|Boatema's temper is as large as she is.}}
Please, help us. De Frogmarsh is under siege! My master, de great [[loa]], [[Krag'wa]], is not willing to bend to de will of de [[blood troll]]s and their [[G'huun|dark god]]. So now, dey are taking his power by force! Dey are slaying his children and taking his [[totem]]s of power. Dey will even take Krag'wa and sacrifice him if we are not able to end dis madness!

Stop dem! Slay their leader. Perhaps dat will slow dem down for a while. It will give me time to find a more permanent solution.

Filthy blood trolls! Have you killed their leader?

Your deeds do not go unnoticed. [[Witch Doctor Zentimo|Zentimo]] spoke of you, before his passing.

When I did not bend to the blood trolls' corruption, they attacked. Now they seek to sacrifice me to their god.

I have no more followers to work through, but perhaps you will help more.
