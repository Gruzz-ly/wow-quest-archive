==Objectives==
Destroy 8 Offerings to G'huun in [[Zul'Nazman]].
* [[Offering to G'huun]] destroyed (8)

==Description==
Been watchin' these cultists with both good eyes.

Those big glowin' jars o' theirs look important.

Opened one up and it sent a shiver down me spine, but nothin' seemed worth the takin'.

If it ain't worth stealin', I guess it's worth smashin'.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What did the five fingers say to the vase?

==Completion==
Doesn't seem ta be much o' value out here in this cursed jungle. Why'd [[Captain Conrad]] think they were worth tradin' with?

==Progression==
{{Nazmir Foothold}}
