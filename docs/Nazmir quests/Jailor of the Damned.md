Talanji, [[Baine Bloodhoof]], and Vol'jin travel to the [[Light's Hammer]] in the [[Icecrown Citadel]] with the [[adventurer]].

;Speak with Talanji:
:Power flows through dis place. De [[soul|spirits]] here are strong, but... imprisoned. It is different than de voices I hear at Bwonsamdi's [[Necropolis (Nazmir)|necropolis]]. Here... it is... channeled.

:We should hurry. I feel as though I am trespassing in a place dat looks unkindly to de living.

:Let me know when you are ready to proceed.

:{{Gossip|Ready.}}

Defeat enemies in the way to reach the Frozen Throne where a cutscene plays:
:''The team is transported to the ground under the throne and approaches the Lich King to ask their questions.''
:{{text|say|Spirit of Vol'jin|Lich King. Da voice I heard as I be dyin'... tellin' me to name [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] [[warchief]]... was it yours?}}
:{{text|say|The Lich King|The Banshee Queen's schemes threaten the balance. I had no hand in them.}}
:''Talanji and Vol'jin walk up the steps to face the Lich King. Baine and the adventurer stay on the ground, guarding them.''
:{{text|say|Spirit of Vol'jin|And me spirit bein' trapped in [[Azeroth|dis world]]... is dat your doin'?}}
:{{text|say|The Lich King|Vol'jin... your soul has walked on the [[Shadowlands|Other Side]] and returned. You have been altered... more than you know.}}
:{{text|say|The Lich King|You are neither [[undead]] nor damned. You do not belong here. Leave this place at once.}}
:''Many [[Ghoul (Icecrown Citadel)|Ghouls]] crawl out of the ground.''
:{{text|say|Talanji|I do not like de look of dis. I suggest we go... quickly!}}
:{{text|say|The Lich King|Leave now or stay forever. The choice is yours.}}
