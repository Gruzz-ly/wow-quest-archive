==Objectives==
Burn [[Bwonsamdi Offerings]], [[Armory Supplies]], [[Food Cache]], and [[Medicinal Supplies]] in the [[Necropolis (Nazmir)|Necropolis]].
* Bwonsamdi offerings destroyed {{co|40.0|28.5|Nazmir}}
* Medicinal supplies destroyed {{co|37.6|28.9|Nazmir}}
* Food cache destroyed {{co|41.2|27.5|Nazmir}}
* Armory supplies destroyed {{co|37.9|32.3|Nazmir}}

==Description==
Here I thought things couldn't get worse, but now we have the [[Horde]] making camp around the home of some death god.

I've got a good idea of what they've brought, thanks to my time in the first three wars. Medicine, armor, food...

And probably offerings for this [[Bwonsamdi]] fella. Destroy all of these supplies to let the Horde know we won't let them stay here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You destroy those supplies yet?

==Completion==
The Horde will be forced to retreat from the Necropolis without their supplies. A good win for us.

==Progression==
{{Chasing Darkness}}
