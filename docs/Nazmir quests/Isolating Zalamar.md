==Objectives==
Order Wardrummers Saljo, Sheej, and Gix to leave their positions.
* [[Wardrummer Saljo]] removed
* [[Wardrummer Sheej]] removed
* [[Wardrummer Gix]] removed

==Description==
[[Hir'eek]], de [[loa]] of [[bat]]s, has been corrupted by [[G'huun]]! We will get no help from him.

We only have one option if dey have a loa on their side... we must kill Hir'eek.

It's crazy, and we will both probably die, but I have a plan. We need to isolate [[Zalamar|dis place]] first.

De [[blood troll]]s have wardrummers who sound an alarm if anything happens here. We need dem gone... but you have to be sneaky about it.

You have a good disguise, so you can order de drummers to go leave their posts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* 75 [[Azerite (resource)]]
* +75 reputation with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Progress==
Did you take care of de wardrummers?

==Completion==
Hah! Now we have plenty of room to mess with dis [[camp]]. Dere will be no reinforcements from de other blood trolls.
