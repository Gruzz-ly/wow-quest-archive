==Objectives==
Recover the Skycaller Gem from [[Fangcaller Sithis]].
* [[Skycaller Gem]]

==Description==
Heh heh... thanks for the rescue! I could use your help in a little plan that I have.

The commander of this place is a [[sethrak]] called Sithis. He's got this thing called a "skycaller gem."

Word is they're looking for some sort of [[shadow magic]] in [[Nazmir]] to try and really power this thing up.

Heh heh... luckily, yours truly has her own shadow magic to do just that! Maybe you do, too. I don't keep up on what powers you keep getting.

Get the gem from Sithis and we'll have some REAL fun afterwards.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
Do you have Ingrid's gem? Please tell me you do... she's been absolutely insufferable about it.

==Completion==
Excellent work freeing Ingrid. She has told me about this particular gem, and the company has voted that you should test it out on our snake enemies.
