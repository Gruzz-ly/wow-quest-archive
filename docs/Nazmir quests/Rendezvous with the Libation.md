==Objectives==
Speak with Patch at the [[Wayward Shoals]].
* [[Patch (goblin)|Patch]] located

==Description==
I be honest wit' ya, mon. I be havin' little patience for [[goblin]]s and their antics.

Go meet with their leader and ensure dat his crew and da weapon be ready for da assault. [[Zuldazar]] gonna be overrun by da [[blood troll]]s if we fail.

Good luck, <name>!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Our mission is a disaster, a complete disaster!

We were about to drop anchor when [[naga]] swarmed the ship! The battle was hard, but we had the upper hand until a [[sea giant]] came out of nowhere. It beat the ship harder than a foreman beats a lazy [[peon]].

Don't worry, <name>. We'll get this plan back on track. But first, we need to get the crew together.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|yell|[[Ticker]]|NOOOO! It's makin' off with our [[A.M.O.D.]]! Our wages are gonna be garnished for the rest of our LIVES if we don't get it back!}}
