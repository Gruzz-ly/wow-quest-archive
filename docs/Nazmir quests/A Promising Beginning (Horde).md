==Objectives==
Return to [[Seshuli]] in [[Dazar'alor]] and report on your discovery.

==Description==
<The shrine now repaired, you find yourself eager to seek out the next shrine.

Perhaps Seshuli has come across more locations.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So de shrine used de same cut of gems we use? To think dat design has survived all dese years.

You know, dat may be de oldest recorded cut in history. Maybe even de first!

But it's good to hear you were able to repair de shrine. Maybe de other two will need to be fixed too, seeing as how dey are very old.
