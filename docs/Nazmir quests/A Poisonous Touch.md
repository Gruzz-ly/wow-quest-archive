You... I saw you speak with [[Witch Doctor Zentimo‎|Zentimo]]. Please, I don't have much time left...

These trolls, they came for our blood. I was already nearly bled dry before this one succumbed to my poison.

Search it's body, the blowgun and darts should still be there. Dip the darts into my blood and use them to weaken as many of their number as you can. 

I will not let my death be in vain! If these trolls want our blood so badly, then they shall have it!

I smell the blood of my spawn upon you! Explain this, now, or you shall be my next meal!

==Completion==
I see, You've brought meaning to [[Mag'ash the Poisonous|Mag'ash]]'s sacrifice.

Thank you for your valor, <name>.

Please, take the weapon with you and go with my blessing.
