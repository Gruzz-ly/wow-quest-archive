==Objectives==
Have Brother Pike use the Abyssal Scepter.
* Have [[Brother Pike]] use the [[:Abyssal Scepter]]

==Description==
Do not mind this, I am finishing off this insect. You have bigger matters to handle.

Our army is moving within [[Zalamar]] as we speak. But the [[Horde]] will know our army's true size without aid.

Speak with Brother Pike and have him perform the ritual with the Abyssal Scepter to cover [[Nazmir]] in a thick fog.

He claims the illusion will also mimic an entire fleet off the beach. Let us hope he is right.

I will join you once I finish with this stain upon [[Azeroth]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (500x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
We don't have time to discuss this, <name>. We must begin.

==Completion==
We have our fog, now we have to move.

==Notes==
On accept, you will be phased. The Alliance forces on the [[Far Reach]] have arrived and cleared out the blood trolls. To the left, the [[7th Legion]], Gilneans, and Sentinels are at the ready with [[Jaina Proudmoore]] and [[Mathias Shaw]], while the Dark Irons and void elves are apparently staying to keep the area secure.

;Have Brother Pike use the Abyssal Scepter
The Abyssal Scepter is a powerful artifact. Give me the word, and I shall unleash its power.

Know that once the fog comes, we will have to move quickly before the Horde and the [[Zandalari Empire|Zandalari]] catch on to our plan.

{{gossip|I'm ready, use the Abyssal Scepter to create the fog to hide our forces.}}

: ''Pike holds the Scepter above his head and empowers it.''
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Tides, grant us power, cover this cursed swamp in your fog, create the veil of a fleet within it!}}
: ''He briefly hovers off the ground, and thick fog forms in an instant.''
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|It is done. I will bring the scepter back to the Far Reach. Good luck to you all.}}
: ''He walks away down the path to the east.''

Nazmir is foggy as the player has the Fog of War buff.
