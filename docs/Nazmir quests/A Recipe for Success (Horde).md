Bring the torn paper back to [[Clever Kumali|Kumali]].

==Description==
Looking it over more closely, you're convinced that this must be the missing half of the recipe you came for.

An odd signature completes the recipe, signed, "[[Silas Darkmoon]]".

Kumali should be very pleased to see this once again.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[:Silas' Sphere of Transmutation]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ya did it, <name>! Dis is de other half of de recipe!

Here. You take dis copy and don't lose it. I'll make another copy and keep it in a safe place.
