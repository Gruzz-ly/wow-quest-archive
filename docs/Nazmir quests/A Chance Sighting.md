==Objectives==
Investigate the missing [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]].

==Description==
One of the lookouts said he saw a bunch of [[blood troll]]s chasing after a Zandalari on the other side of the river.

He seemed to be dressed like your group. Why do you people keep running into trouble in this place?

I'll mark on your map where he was last seen. Just don't bring a horde of blood trolls over here, alright?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The [[Guard Satao|Zandalari]] next to this antidote is barely alive.>

==Progression==
{{Zal'amak}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
