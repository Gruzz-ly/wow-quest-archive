==Objectives==
Meet with [[Captain Conrad]] at [[Tul'vor]] in [[Nazmir]].

==Description==
Looks like there's couple o' guards posted by this hut. If I had ta guess, Captain Conrad'll be in there.

Somethin' still feels off about this place, though. Why don't ya go on ahead and I'll hang here in case things go south fast?

I got yer back, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I was wondering when you would come for me. I must admit that I am not as captive as you might believe. Quite to the contrary, in fact.

==Progression==
{{Nazmir Foothold}}

==Patch changes==
