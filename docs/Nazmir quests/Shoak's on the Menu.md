==Objectives==
Rescue Shoak from the [[Natha'vor tribe|Natha'vor trolls]].
* [[Shoak]] Rescued

==Description==
I don't know what stupid thing Shoak did to get captured by the [[Natha'vor]] [[Blood troll|trolls]], we'll find out once you rescue him.

I bet they're getting ready to make a meal out of Shoak. You need to work fast and get him out! 

Shoak's one of the largest oafs that I know, those trolls won't be happy that you're taking their "meal" away.
