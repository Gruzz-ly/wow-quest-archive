==Objectives==
Defeat Jungo, [[Herald]] of [[G'huun]].
* [[Jungo, Herald of G'huun]] slain

==Description==
{{Questportrait|image=Jungo.jpg|name=Jungo, Herald of G'huun|text=Jungo's power is immense. It must be stopped before it can attack Zuldazar!}}
Dis is it, <name>. De [[blood magic]] is weakened enough dat we can actually hurt de herald of G'huun.

It is going to take all of us fighting dis thing to stop it. We will meet you inside of [[Torga]]. 

We cannot lose here. If de [[blood troll]]s control Torga's blood, den dere will be no way for us to stop dem.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,800 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Talanji's Expedition]]
* +500 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Completion==
It is done, <name>. De blood trolls no longer have de blood of Torga as a resource to fuel their army.

I know we were hoping to have Torga's aid, but at least we stopped de blood trolls.

We must find [[Rokhan]] and de others, along with [[Krag'wa]], if he is still alive.

Eh? It looks like [[Lashk]] wants something...

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Princess Talanji starts running toward Torga's corpse.''
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|Let us begin. For [[Zandalar]]... and for Torga!}}
:''[[Lashk]] and [[Kisha]] proceed after Talanji.''
:{{text|say|Lashk|It's been ages since my heart burned with such fire. For Torga!}}
:{{text|say|Kisha|Wait until the others hear the story of how we killed the herald of G'huun!}}

On aggro:
:{{text|yell|Jungo, Herald of G'huun|Your efforts... meaningless. I am... untouchable.}}
:''Enter Talanji. She proceeds to break the herald's shield {{Abilities|Touch of the Blood God|id=254359|icon=inv_misc_boilingblood}}.''
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|Overconfidence shall be your undoing! Your power cannot protect you!}}
:{{text|say|Jungo, Herald of G'huun|Your efforts... futile... I am... untouch--what? No. NO!}}
:''Jungo's shield is no longer.''
:{{text|yell|Princess Talanji|Eveyone! NOW!}}
:''Lashk and Kisha join in on the fight.''
:{{text|yell|Kisha|FOR TORGA!}}
:{{text|yell|Jungo, Herald of G'huun|GRAAAGH! You are NOTHING against G'huun! Suffer and DIE!}}

Near death, ~1% health:
:''Jungo is stunned and Talanji starts channeling into Jungo.''
:{{text|yell|Princess Talanji|Dis ends... now! No longer will my people... live in fear of you... and your vile blood trolls!}}
:{{text|yell|Princess Talanji|De Horde's champion and I... we are coming for you... and we will tear you apart, piece by piece!}}
:''Jungo explodes.''
:{{text|say|Kisha|Huh... amazing. We actually did it!}}
:{{text|say|Lashk|Whew! I'm ready for a break.}}
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|Indeed. Let us return to de shrine.}}
