==Objectives==
Destroy 5 [[Profane Totem]]s with [[Kajosh]]'s scroll of inferno.
* Profane Totem destroyed (5)
* Kajosh's spell complete
* [[Scroll of Inferno]] (provided)

==Description==
I hate this place! I just want to go home, but I can't because that oaf, [[Shoak]], is missing.

Listen, <race>t, I'll make it worth your while if you help me find that dunce.

I've got a way to find Shoak, but of COURSE these stupid [[totem]]s are blocking my magic! Why wouldn't they?

Take this scroll and use its magic to burn these totems. I'm going to look around to see if that bonehead is just sleeping somewhere.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
You destroy those totems yet?

==Completion==
Looks like that dunce got himself captured by [[blood troll]]s.

This is going to get violent really fast.

This isn't the first time Shoak has gotten himself lost. He better be in really big trouble for all this effort we're doing.

{{Gossip|Some of the totems are destroyed, will your spell  work now?}}
