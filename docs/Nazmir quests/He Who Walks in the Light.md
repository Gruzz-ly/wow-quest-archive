==Objectives==
Return to [[Halford Wyrmbane]] within [[Boralus]].

==Description==
[[Mathias Shaw|Shaw]] reports that [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] [[scout]]s have been dispatched to alert of our "full assault". 

We did it, <name>. The [[Horde]] and Zandalari will throw their armies at our forces within [[Nazmir]].

We cannot let their sacrifice be in vain. We must get back to Boralus and let Halford know it's time to strike.

Come, I'll create a [[portal]] for us to leave, once we say one final word to [[Blademaster Telaamon|Telaamon]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Telaamon's sacrifice will be remembered, but for now, we must move.

==Criteria of==
*[[Tides of Vengeance (achievement)]]
