==Description==
We have four loa, but we only know where one is: Bwonsamdi.

As uncomfortable as it makes me, I am prepared to do anything to stop de [[blood troll]]s... even if it means dealing with de loa of death.

Ages ago, Bwonsamdi had a temple here in [[Nazmir]]. My scrying has revealed a few locations to de north where I sense a magical presence. Search dem for clues.

Hurry, <name>. [[Zuldazar]] will fall if we cannot obtain Bwonsamdi's help!

You are looking for Bwonsamdi's temple? You must be desperate to be going dere.

Lucky for you, I am headed dat way myself.
