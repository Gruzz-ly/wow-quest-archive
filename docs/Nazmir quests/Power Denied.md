==Objectives==
Defeat [[Hexxer Nana'kwug]] and recover her blood fetish.
* [[Blood Fetish]] recovered

==Description==
{{Questportrait|image=Hexxer Nana'kwug.jpg|name=Hexxer Nana'kwug|text=Take Hexxer Nana'kwug's blood fetish!}}
Ah! Oh, it's you, <name>. [[Zardrax the Empowerer|Zardrax]] has me on edge, saying we are all doomed, dat dere is no hope.

I had a plan to stop him. All we had to do was kill a [[hexxer]], Nana'kwug, who is helping spread Zardrax's power, and steal de fetish she is using.

Den you'd give dat fetish to [[Shadow Hunter Da'jul|Da'jul]] and he'd use his [[voodoo]] to grant us more power.

But it is hopeless now. Maybe we should just side with Zardrax. How can we stop someting as big as dis?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Progress==
Ya got dat fetish yet? Maybe [[Kal'dran]] be calmin' down when he sees we be havin' a chance ta survive.

==Completion==
Good job on gettin' dis fetish. Dere be a lot dat I can be doin' with dis ting.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kal'dran|I don't know about dis, Da'jul... <Name> can't stop dis! We will all die!}}
:{{text|say|Shadow Hunter Da'jul|Ya just be leavin' dis thing to <Name>. He gonna kill dat hexxer ya be talkin' about.}}

On aggro:
:{{text|say|Hexxer Nana'kwug|With da power of Zardrax and G'huun, we be unstoppable!}}

On death:
