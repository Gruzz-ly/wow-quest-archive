==Objectives==
Confront [[Bwonsamdi]].

==Description==
Bwonsamdi is a dangerous [[loa]], but even I do not believe he whispered to [[Vol'jin]] on his deathbed. To appoint [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] sounds, well... he is not fond of de [[undead]]. And from what I have seen of de [[warchief]], she is no fan of [[death]].

We must be respectful when we speak to Bwonsamdi, or dere will be consequences. Come, stay close.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Radiant Azerite Core]] (750 [[Azerite (resource)]])
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]
* +250 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Completion==
Now listen here, mon. Usually, ya disrespectul actions would be mighty irritatin' to Ol' Bwonsamdi. But I be lettin' dis one slide. For now.

What ya be talkin' about sounds like some bad [[mojo]]. I gonna need ya to find out more from some of me... "old friends."

==Notes==
A cutscene plays upon acceptance:
:''Talanji, [[Baine Bloodhoof]], [[Rokhan]] and the [[Horde]] [[adventurer]] enter the [[Necropolis (Nazmir)|Necropolis]]. Bwonsamdi manifests himself before them.''
:{{text|say|Bwonsamdi|Ahhhh, ya come back. Did ya find da [[ghost|spirit]] of Vol'jin? Or ya here ta make a deal?}}
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|Loa of death, your servant Vol'jin has called to you. Yet you have turned a deaf ear to his pleas.}}
:{{text|say|Bwonsamdi|What? Nonono. Ya be mistaken, Talanji.}}
:{{text|yell|Baine Bloodhoof|Speak plainly! Was it you who urged Vol'jin to name Sylvanas warchief?}}
:{{text|say|Bwonsamdi|Mind ya tone, [[tauren|bull-mon]]... or ya be talkin' with [[Cairne Bloodhoof|ya father]] soon enough.}}
:{{text|say|Bwonsamdi|Why would me want da Banshee Queen in charge? Nononono. Sure, I be all for war and death, but dat Sylvanas... she be tippin' da scales too far.}}
:{{text|say|Bwonsamdi|Balance be important! Besides, dat one got a nasty habit of keepin' what she kills. No, ya warchief be no friend to ol' Bwonsamdi.}}
:{{text|say|Bwonsamdi|Ya words be troublin', though. Step forward, [[adventurer|Speaker of da Horde]]. Maybe dere be a way ta find da answers ya seek.}}
