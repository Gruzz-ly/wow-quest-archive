;Description
<This crate looks like it was of [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] origin, likely hauled here by the [[blood troll]]s after one of their raids. Inside the create you see bags of grain, salt, and meat. These supplies would come in handy... perhaps you might find more supplies in the possession of the blood trolls within the camp.>
