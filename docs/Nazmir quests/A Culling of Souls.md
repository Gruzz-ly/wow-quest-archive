==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Blood Witch Najima.jpg|Blood Witch Najima|She leads a team of Blood Troll scavengers.}}
Defeat [[Blood Witch Najima]].
*[[Blood Witch Najima]] slain

==Description==
Only two types enter [[Bwonsamdi]]'s temple anymore: those looking to make a deal with death, and de dead. You do not stink, so I guess you are de former.

I am headed to de temple myself, so how about a trade?

See de land across de bridge? Dere is a [[Witch (disambiguation)|witch]] named Najima dat I have been tracking. De [[blood troll]]s are corrupt to de core, but their [[soul]]s are useful as offerings to Bwonsamdi. She is too strong for me to deal with, but if you can slay her, I will take you to de temple.

I give you my word.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|80|}} - {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,550 - 22,300 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Completion==
Dis should do it. Her soul is perfect for an offering.

Now, before we go to de temple, there is one more thing to do...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Hanzabu|Careful now! Dat witch has some powerful mojo!}}

:{{text|say|Blood Witch Najima|Your blood gonna fuel us!}}

On death:
:{{text|say|Blood Witch Najima|Dis changes... nothing! Soon... you all gonna... die...}}
:''Hanzabu is seen running toward Najima's corpse.''
:{{text|say|Hanzabu|You did well. Dis one's soul is going to be a worthy offering to Bwonsamdi!}}
:{{text|say|Hanzabu|Now let's get out of here. Dere is a shrine up ahead called Zo'bal. Meet me dere.}}
