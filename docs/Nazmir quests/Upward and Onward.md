==Description==
It is sad dat [[Hir'eek]] had to die, but at least de [[blood troll]]s are weaker now.

My potions are healing me up nicely. I did some looking around and came across dis guy.

He's skittish, but not hostile. I think you can use him to get out of here.

Hurry up and jump on, before he breaks de rope! I'll find my own way out; you don't have to worry.

* {{cost|2|34|}}

==Progress==
Hurry up, dis guy is strong!

==Completion==
Sorry. You did what you had to do... I can't believe dat dis [[G'huun]] could  corrupt a [[loa]], of all things.

[[Nazmir]] is a cursed place... for everybody.
