* Visit [[Krag'wa's Burrow]]
* [[Casteless Zandalari Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
De caretakers are always telling us stories in de [[Hall of Castes]]. Sometimes dey warn us about danger, sometimes dey're about de [[loa]]... dere's usually a point to dem.

One time, dey told us about [[Krag'wa]], and how [[blood troll]]s killed his followers, and how he hasn't been seen since.

But I heard dat he's back! He's in Nazmir again, and he's plotting his revenge against de blood trolls.

Can we go see him?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
Where do loa go when dey don't have followers? I hope dey aren't too sad.

==Completion==
If I followed Kra'wa, would he eat me? Or not eat me?

I don't want to find out.
