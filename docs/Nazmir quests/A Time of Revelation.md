==Objectives==
Help [[Princess Talanji|Talanji]] chase down [[Grand Ma'da Ateena|Ateena]].
* Speak with Talanji at the overlook

==Description==
I can feel Ateena's dark [[voodoo]] up ahead. We need to stop whatever she is planning with dis "[[G'huun]]".

Be ready for anything, <name>. We do not know what power Ateena truly has.

I do know one thing. If G'huun is threatening [[Zandalari troll|my people]], den it will die, just like Ateena.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40|}} - {{Cost|23|40|}}
*16,450 - 17,850
* +150 reputation with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Completion==
De [[blood troll]] threat is bigger than I ever imagined. [[Taloc|Dat construct]] is enough to destroy all of [[Zuldazar]]{{sic}}

We need more than de [[Horde]] to stop dis.

==Notes==
Upon accepting the quest:
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|Prepare yourself, <name>. We have no idea what may be ahead.}}
Upon reaching the overlook in [[Bloodfire Ravine]]:
:''Talanji and the [[adventurer]] discovers [[Zul'Nazman]].''
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|By de [[loa]]... No! Now we see de true power of de blood trolls. Oh [[Rastakhan|father]]... why did you ignore dem for so long?!}}
Speak with Talanji:
:Curse de cowards in Zuldazar for not stopping dis threat sooner! My father was a fool to think dis would just "go away".

:Dis will not end with us just killing Ateena. It is far worse than I ever imagined.

:{{Gossip|We need to move, we shouldn't stay here.}}
:''A cutscene plays:''
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|I knew de blood trolls were a threat, but I never imagined... dis...}}

:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|If dat monstrosity is freed, it will mean de end of Zuldazar!}}
:''Ateena appears.''
:{{Text|yell|Grand Ma'da Ateena|Now ya see! Now ya undahstand! G'huun gonna claim ya all!}}
:''Blood trolls swarm to Talanji and the adventurer, attacking them. [[Tze'na]] comes to the two.''
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|We are getting out of here!}}
:''The cutscene ends. Talanji and the adventurer ride Tze'na to escape.''

:''Tze'na speeds away form Bloodfire Ravine. The blood trolls stop chasing.''
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|Dey are not following us. Looks like we are in de clear.}}
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|If dey free dat monster, de blood trolls will be unstoppable. Even with you and de [[Horde]] on our side, it will not be enough. We need a new plan.}}
:''Tze'na reaches the [[Zul'jan Ruins]]. Talanji dismounts and runs into the ruins.''
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|Hurry! I hear de others nearby.}}
Follow Talanji:
