==Objectives==
Defeat 20 Enraged [[Sethrak]] with the Skycaller Gem.
* Enraged Sethrak slain (20)
* Skycaller gem overloaded
*[[Skycaller Gem#Empowered]] (provided)

==Description==
It appears the sethrak are quite serious about keeping this gem. I do wonder where they found it in the first place.

Hrm... perhaps [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Lady Sylvanas]] would be interested in this as well. Something to ponder.

[[Ingrid Bellix‎|Ingrid]] believes this gem can unleash lightning and [[shadow magic]] of, her words not mine, epic proportions.

I do believe it would be best for everyone if you tested it out on the small sethrak army currently looking for us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Good work. The sethrak will be back, but we've proven our point, which is don't cross the [[Horde]].

With that business over with, my squad will be off. Hopefully the next time we meet will be under... nicer circumstances.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Enraged Sethrak Ravager]]s and [[Enraged Sethrak Warden]]s.

:{{Text|say|[[Clayton Backston]]|Boss, how did you survive? I saw you get cut in half.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Anna Bizrim]]|Ugh, Clayton, we're [[undead]], of course we can survive getting cut in half.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Timothy Zarltin]]|Sometimes.}}
:{{Text|say|Chadwick Paxton|It'ss no the first time I've been cut in half. Hopefully, it'll be the last.}}
:{{Text|say|Anna Bizrim|When WAS the first you were cut in half?}}
:{{Text|say|Clayton Backston|...That information is classified.}}

;On return
:{{Text|say|[[Ingrid Bellix]]|Ahaha, that was amazing! And you're still alive!}}
:{{Text|say|Chadwick Paxton|That's a relief, but I believe it was tad over the top for my tastes.}}
:{{Text|say|Clayton Backston|Does it seem like overkill to anyone else that we annihilated several scores of sethrak over killing a few of us?}}
:{{Text|say|Anna Bizrim|No.}}
:{{Text|say|Timothy Zarltin|Nope.}}
:{{Text|say|Ingrid Bellix|Not in the slightest.}}
:{{Text|say|Clayton Backston|...Right. Just me, then.}}

;On completion
:{{Text|say|Chadwick Paxton|All right, move out! We have more o this place to scout, and we can't get ourselves ambushed again.}}
:{{Text|say|Anna Bizrim|I don't think that's our fault, boss, given that we were attacked by a group that wasn't supposed to be here.}}
:{{Text|say|Clayton Backston|We should've seen the attack coming. Who was supposed to be the lookout?}}
:{{Text|say|Timothy Zarltin|It was [[Tucker (Forsaken)|Tucker]]. The sethrak killed him first.}}
:{{Text|say|Clayton Backston|Tucker! Should have known. At least he paid the price for his incompetence.}}
:{{Text|say|Chadwick Paxton|Keep it down! Lady Sylvanas won't be happy if we fail our mission.}}
:{{Text|say|Ingrid Bellix|Is she ever happy, boss?}}
:{{Text|say|Chadwick Paxton|She will be if we do our jobs properly, Ingrid.}}
