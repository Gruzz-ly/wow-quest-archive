==Objectives==
Meet with [[Jaina Proudmoore]] outside of [[Zul'jan Ruins|Zul'jan ruins]].

==Description==
We have [[Zalamar]], and we've got our fog. Now, we have to take the attack to the [[Horde]].

Our goal is to take as much land in [[Nazmir]] as possible to make the Horde think our main [[fleet]] is here.

The first target is Zul'jan ruins, one of the Horde's main bases in Nazmir.

We'll have to make our way through the swamps to our attack position. Meet us there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We've made it and still maintain the element of surprise.

: ''The commanders ride off to the east as the soldiers follow in that direction in a loose group to disperse in the swamp.''

As for you, you're headed south near [[Grimwatt's Crash]], so you can use your [[Flight Master's Whistle]] if you like.
