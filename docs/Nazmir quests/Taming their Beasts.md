==Objectives==
Use the Re-Discombobulator to control 3 battle beasts.
* [[Resting Battlebeast]] tamed (3)
* [[Re-Discombobulator]] (provided)
* Meet with [[Mathias Shaw]] further within the Fallen Outpost.

==Description==
Our goal is to assault the [[Blood Gate]], but to be blunt, we don't have the force necessary for this.

That's why we have [[gnomish technology]]. The [[Zandalari]] have battle beasts, [[direhorn]]s mounted with powerful weapons.

Several of these [[beast]]s are resting within the [[Fallen Outpost]]. This device, the Re-Discombobulator, will give us control over these [[animal]]s.

Take this device and use it on these battle beasts. We'll assault the Blood Gates once we have them under our control.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
*[[Glowing Azerite Crystal]] (250x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Completion==
Good work, these beasts will be imperative to take the Blood Gate.

==Notes==
;Accept
:{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|I'll sneak ahead while you tame those beasts. Good luck.}}
: ''He [[stealth]]s and sneaks off east.''

After using the quest item on the NPCs, they turn into [[Controlled Battlebeast]]s.
