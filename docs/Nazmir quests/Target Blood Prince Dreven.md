==Objectives==
Meet Keeshan within the [[Collapsed Tunnels]] in [[Nazmir]].
* Meet [[John J. Keeshan]] {{co|20.2|60.8|Nazmir}}
* Kill [[Blood Prince Dreven]] and cohorts
*Meet Shandris Feathermoon in [[Fort Victory]]

==Description==
We must kill Blood Prince Dreven and his followers. I know of the place where they intend to go. Here is the plan.

You and Keeshan will make your way to the tunnels and act as bait, lure Dreven into a false sense of security.

Myself and the sentinels will seal the entrance to trap him and his allies shortly thereafter.

Then we kill them all. I'll send word to the others to get moving.

Let's go.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Core]] (800x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Completion==
Keeshan has recovered, and I've sent scouts to retrieve the bodies of my sentinels.

They died fighting a monster. Keeshan and I will give them the highest honors.

I'll send a report to [[Halford Wyrmbane|Halford]] regarding what happened here. We must make the destruction of Draven our highest priority.

Thank you for all your help, <name>. We could not have done this without you.

Looks like we're the bait for a group of hungry bloodsucking elves. Ready for whatever happens next?
