==Objectives==
Disarm 10 traps within the [[Fallen Outpost]].
*[[Land Mine (Nazmir)|Mines]] disarmed (10)

==Description==
The [[Alliance]] are stalling our efforts here with this irritating fog, as well as layering the entire area with traps.

We will suffer too many casualties if we try marching our army through this trap-infested area.

I've heard you're good at sneaking around. Use your talents to disarm the traps in this area.

I'll deal with getting the [[goblin]]'s parts back from the Alliance while you disarm those traps.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good, we should be able to march our army now. [[Rokhan]] and I recovered enough parts for these goblins to rebuild [[A.F.M.O.D.|their machine]].

==Notes==
This quest is only given to rogues. Other classes get [[Re-rebuilding the A.F.M.O.D.]] instead.
