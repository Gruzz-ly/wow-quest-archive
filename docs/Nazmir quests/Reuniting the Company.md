==Objectives==
Rescue the remnants of [[Chadwick Paxton]]'s squad.
* [[Anna Bizrim]] rescued
* [[Timothy Zarltin|Timothy Zartlin]] rescued
* [[Clayton Backston]] rescued
* [[Ingrid Bellix]] rescued

==Description==
Right, then. First order of business, rescue the remnants of my company. 

These [[sethrak]] kept yelling about expanding [[Faithless|their empire]] and conquering [[Azeroth]] as they attacked us. Lovely, really.

They killed most of my company and took some hostages. I assume they're being told how grand the sethrak empire is.

I'd like the remnants of my company back, if you please. I'll be put in a good word with [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Lady Sylvanas]], once this is all over. 

...not that someone like you needs it.
