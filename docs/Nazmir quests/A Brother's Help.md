Can ye please talk some sense into [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]] fer me?

Travel to Nazmir, just northeast of the pyramid to find Brann and Magni. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Ah come on, Magni! This [[Brann's Flying Machine|ol' bird]] can handle the extra weight!}}
:''Magni replies in a scoffing manner.''
:{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|That thing could barely carry us when I wasn't made of diamond. I'll take my chances on the ground.}}
