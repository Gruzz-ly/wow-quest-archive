==Objectives==
Ride the battlebeast and defeat the [[Zandalari]] army at the Blood Gates.
*Ride [[Controlled Battlebeast|controlled battlebeast]]
*[[Blood Gate]]s cleared (0/100%)

==Description==
We have our forces spread out throughout [[Nazmir]], but we need to do something that will force [[Rastakhan]] into action.

We must personally march into [[Zuldazar]] and take the Blood Gate. This will cause them to throw their full army at us.

As you can see, we're the only ones left that can assault the Blood Gate.

[[Mathias Shaw|Shaw]] and [[Blademaster Telaamon|Telaamon]] will stay behind to help the rest of the army move up.

You and I will ride the battle beast into the Blood Gate and take it by force.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Glowing Azerite Geode]] (400x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Excellent. We've decimated the Zandalari front lines and paved the way for our [[soldier]]s to move in.

It's time for us to start our main attack.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Zandalari Warrior (War Campaign)|Zandalari Warriors]] and [[Zandalari Battlesaur]]s.

: ''Telaamon runs over to one of the battlebeasts and mounts it. As he speaks, Mathias mounts a second one.''
:{{text|say|Blademaster Telaamon|Good luck <name>, Lady Jaina. We will ensure the army is here when you return victorious.}}
: ''They ride off to the north.''

Mounting the third battlebeast has it take you south to a waiting army past the Blood Gates, while Jaina mounts a frost form [[Archmage's Prismatic Disc]] and follows along in the air. It won't take long to blast through your mob count.

;Blood Gates cleared
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|We've weakened them enough, we must return to signal the armies to move forward!}}
: ''The battlebeast returns north to the meeting spot where the other commanders have gathered the army.''
