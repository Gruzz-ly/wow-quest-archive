==Objectives==
Take a [[bat]] to [[Fort Victory]].
* [[Zalamar Messenger Bat|Bat]] flown to Fort Victory

==Description==
Let's get outta this hole! Hairs on the back o' me neck won't settle down. Was hopin' I'd find some artifacts, or treasures, or haggis, or at least a few worthwhile trinkets down here.

Those bats look like the ones that we came on... hopefully they'll take us back to Fort Victory and not some rotten grotto with no valuables inside.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Fort Victory's got the wrong name. Somethin' like Fort Folly seems more appropriate ta me.

==Notes==
Continue upward and find a Zalamar Messenger Bat. Approach Fort Victory:

:{{text|say|[["Silvermoon" Harry]]|My... oh my goodness. Surely the esteemed [[Captain Conrad]] had no knowledge of these macabre circumstances.}}
:{{text|emote|Harry's blood drains from his face.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Knowledge or no, it's time to get to the bottom o' this. Where'd this Captain head off to?}}
:{{text|say|"Silvermoon" Harry|[[Zul'Nazman]], I believe. Or [[Tul'vor]]? In fact I believe they are one and the same. Or nearly so.}}
