==Objectives==
Rescue 6 Tortollan Captives from the blood trolls.
* [[Tortollan Captive|Tortollan captive]] rescued (6)
* Speak to the [[Rescued Tortollan|rescued tortollan]] in [[Redfield's Watch]] {{co|51.3|21.8|Nazmir}}

==Description==
Our first task is to rescue the [[tortollan]]s captured by the [[blood trolls]]. 

[[John J. Keeshan|Keeshan's]] report indicates the tortollans are familiar with all things Nazmir. They should know about the [[Horde|Horde's]] operations here.

The tortollans tend to stay neutral in most matters. They'll give us details on the Horde's plans if we make a fair trade.

We'll meet afterwards at our other outpost, Redfield's Watch, north of Torga's Rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
What else do you need to know?

==Completion==
We've the information we need from the tortollans. We have to push on, time is of the essence.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Keeshan, you're allowed to be at ease around me.}}
:{{text|say|[[John J. Keeshan]]|Ma'am, I read your file from [[SI:7]]. You've been alive for more than ten thousand years, fought in more wars than I can ever imagine.}}
:{{text|say|John J. Keeshan|Far as I'm concerned, I'm barely worthy of serving next to you. Least I can do is keep quiet and show you respect.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|You are a hero in your own way, Keeshan, from your service in the [[First War|first]] [[Second War|three]] [[Third War|wars]] to your acts of heroism in [[Redridge Mountains|Redridge]].}}
:{{text|say|John J. Keeshan|How does a decorated [[Night elf|elven]] [[General (rank)|general]] know about someone like me?}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|You're not the only one who requests files from SI:7.}}

Rescued Tortollan:
:I thought I was done for back there. You have my thanks, <race>. They still call your kind a <race>, right?
{{gossip|Can you tell us about the [[Horde]]'s movements in the area?}}
:{{text|say|Rescued Tortollan|I can tell you all about the Horde. I just need a little something in return.}}
:{{text|say|John J. Keeshan|We just saved your life. What more do you need?}}
:{{text|say|Rescued Tortollan|A good story! I was supposed to get great ones from [[Torga]], but now he's dead. Do you have any good stories?}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I have been alive for over 10,000 years and have fought in every war. I saw the original [[Well of Eternity]] with my own eyes.}}
:{{text|say|John J. Keeshan|And I served across the first three wars, survived being [[prisoner]] to a bunch of barbaric [[orc]]s, and helped kill a [[Darkblaze|black dragon]].}}
:{{text|say|Rescued Tortollan|This will be fun! I'll give you what you need to know, and then you can tell me all about your war experiences.}}
:{{text|say|Rescued Tortollan|This Areiel you're looking for is in the [[Necropolis (Nazmir)|Necropolis]], along with a whole host of Horde! She seemed real bothered by some missive she received.}}
:{{text|say|Rescued Tortollan|Said how she should be out killing the [[Alliance]] instead of dealing with some nonsense. I knew after that I should leave before making any more deals for stories.}}
