Use the Poisoned Mojo Flask to Poison 5 Tamed Warspawn.
* [[Tamed Warspawn]] poisoned (5)
* [[Poisoned Mojo Flask]] (provided)

==Description==
Now we have room for our plan to kill [[Hir'eek]]. You see, <name>, my specialty is in making potions and poisons.

I am working on a poison to use on Hir'eek, when de time comes. I have no idea if it will work or not.

I want you to take what I already made and use it on de [[bat]]s around here. It should kill dem instantly. 

If it works, den I can make it stronger with my [[voodoo]] and give us a chance at killing Hir'eek.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Progress==
Did you poison de bats yet?

==Completion==
I knew my poison would work! I just need to put a bit more of my voodoo in dere for it to be ready for Hir'eek.

==Notes==
After completing [[Mark of the Bat]] and this quest, the poison will explode and [[Jo'chunga]]'s disguise will break.
