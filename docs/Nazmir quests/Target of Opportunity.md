Princess Talanji says: Come. We may have an opportunity to end dis once and for all! 

Rokhan says: Go! I be watchin' da flank!

:No more running, no more games. Here, we end dis! I'm ready.

{{Gossip|I'm ready.}}

Princess Talanji yells: Ateena!  Your threat to my people ends here!

Grand Ma'da Ateena says: Such a brave little princess. Gonna be fun shutting dat royal mouth of yours!  

Grand Ma'da Ateena says: Livin' in comfort and luxury, safe from hunger and death...Ya people be soft, Princess!  

''Talanji unleashed the power of Loa and collided with Ateena's evil energy. While they are fighting, the blood trolls keep charging towards you.''

Princess Talanji says: De Zandalari have de finest navy in de world!  We have proven our strength!

Grand Ma'da Ateena says: Da blood of ya soldiers be feeding me armies. When da great beast rises, all of Zandalar gonna crumble! 

Princess Talanji says: I will not let dat happen! I am de shield of my people! 

Grand Ma'da Ateena says: Ya is startin' ta bore me now, Princess.

''Talanji failed to break through the magic shield of Grand Ma'da Ateena, and then her energy was pushed back in the air. Ateena used a binding magic to keep Talanji in place.''

Grand Ma'da Ateena says: I got no time ta play games with a spoiled child. 

Grand Ma'da Ateena says: Da wakenin' ritual will be completed. Servants! Deal with dem!

''Grand Ma'da Ateena teleported away, leaving Talanji and you here.''

Princess Talanji says: Thank you,<name>.She is far stronger than I thought.

''After a brief charge, A.M.O.D. fired a powerful shell at Taloc.''

''However, Grand Ma'da Ateena also teleported blood magic to Taloc. When the shell was about to hit Taloc, Ateena cast a spell on Taloc, forming a shield and rendering this attack ineffective.''
