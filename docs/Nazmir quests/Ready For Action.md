==Objectives==
Travel to [[Gloom Hollow]] and speak with Princess Talanji.
* Obtain ride from [[Newt's Emergency Rocket]] (Optional)
* Return to [[Talanji]]

==Description==
It's gonna take a bit to get the gun chassis set up. Who knew lifting big equipment could be so hard?

In the meantime, why don't you go check back with your friends. Make sure everything's ready on their end. I'd hate to drive this gun into ANOTHER ambush because they're not ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Naga]], you say?

Sounds like quite de crisis dere. I am glad you were able to get things back together!

==Notes==


:{{text|say|Newt|Ah, you have returned! You were gone longer than expected. Any trouble?}}

:{{text|say|Newt|You can ride my rocket back to your base.  It's a one-way trip, though, so don't fire it up until you're all set to go.}}

:<Newt claims this rocket makes a safe one way vehicle.  The flimsy construction suggests otherwise.>

{{gossip|Let's ride out of here.}}
