Look, between you and me, dere is no way we will drag my friend outta here without what got us into dis mess.

We saw three orbs in dis [[camp]]. Dey are filled with de power of [[blood magic]] and are used in dirty rituals. 

Blood is drained from "volunteers" to corrupt de tadpoles of [[Krag'wa]] into vicious [[crawg]]s.

If dis is a possible fate for children of [[loa]], we must end it. 

Take dis vial and bleed de orbs dry. De chronicler will need to do research.
