Clicking on Krag'wa will bring up a new gossip

:The blood trolls are amassing their forces for another attack upon me and my children. This time, it is I who will do the killing! Are you ready?
:''{{gossip|I am ready to fight the blood trolls.}}''

Krag'wa charged into the enemy formation with great determination. With just a few jumps, he charged into the battlefield and landed, sending all the blood trolls around him flying.
