If [[Torga]] wants us to help you kill the [[Jungo, Herald of G'huun|herald]] of [[G'huun]], then I guess we'll help. First, we need to rescue [[Tortollan|our people]]. I found out that the blood trolls are draining the blood of our friends nearby and then feeding them to [[crawg]]s! This is no way for a tortollan to die, not after hundred of years gathering stories on [[Azeroth]]. Take this scroll. It'll purge whatever [[blood magic]] the blood trolls using on my friends. Be careful with my scroll! I want it back in one piece.
