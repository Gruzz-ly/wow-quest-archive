==Notes==
Location: [[Sundered Span]], [[Nazmir]] during [[Faction Assaults]].

Find and interact with the crawler mines: [[Crawler Mine "Cranky"]], [[Crawler Mine "Winona"]], [[Crawler Mine "Roscoe"]], [[Crawler Mine "Killzit"]], [[Crawler Mine "Boomer"]].

After the crawler mines are repaired, they start following the character.

*{{Text|say|I am completely operational ...fzzzt}}
*{{Text|say|Bzzt ...ready for action!}}

Find and interact with the [[Remote Mine Controls]] next to [[Fezi Cheapbucket]] and [[Crawler Mine Pile]]s. This takes control of a Crawler Mine with the following abilities:
#{{Abilities|Power Walk|id=||icon=}}
#{{Abilities|Command Mines|id=||icon=}}
#*
#{{Abilities|Detonate|id=||icon=}}

:{{Text|say|Fezi Cheapbucket|You're gonna have to lead these mines to the target!}}

{{Cleanup-section|Needs live version of the mob name.}}
Head to the end of the Span. On the way, [[Alliance Frosthrower]]s freeze the mine for a few seconds.

Using Command Mines orders the following mines to attack the enemies.
