==Objectives==
Recover the Horde Missive from [[Ranger Captain Areiel|Captain Areiel]].
* [[Horde Missive]] {{co|35.9|29.3|Nazmir}}

==Description==
The [[tortollan]]s have given us Captain Areiel's location, as well as new information. She carries a missive from the Horde.

Any missive the Horde would send to Areiel must be extremely important. We must recover it and deliver the information to [[Halford Wyrmbane|Halford]].

Areiel and I once fought side by side. She's incredibly powerful, [[John J. Keeshan|Keeshan]] and I will be there to help you bring her down.

Good luck, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,310 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Did you retrieve the missive?

==Completion==
I know I shouldn't take pleasure in Areiel's death... but there is a part of me that is glad her reign of terror is over.

What of the missive?

==Notes==
Aggro:
:{{text|say|Ranger Captain Areiel|Shandris, it's been... two, three thousand years? To think we'd meet again like this, and with you helping a human, of all things.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|And you still cling to your outdated views on humans. I should've killed you a long time ago.}}
:{{text|say|Ranger Captain Areiel|Darkness... Sylvanas... is this what you saw... what you wished to save us from?}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|... It's over. Find her plans and return to Redfield's Watch when you're done here.}}
