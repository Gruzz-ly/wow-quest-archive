==Objectives==
Collect Beautiful Glowflies in the [[Upper Frogmarsh]].
* [[Beautiful Glowfly|Beautiful Glowflies]] collected (25)
* [[Glowfly Bottle]] (provided)

==Description==
Long ago when the [[Blood troll|trolls]] began listening to the whispering darkness, I instilled portions of my power into the [[totem]]s that surround my lair. I need that power now.

In the swamps north of here are [[Firefly|glowflies]]. Their [[magic]]al essence will aid me in drawing the stored power from the totems. Collect them and return. Then you will see what I was capable of at the height of my strength.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Alluring Glowfly Lantern
|Gilded Lilypad
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Progress==
Even little creatures can have great power.

==Completion==
I should have done this long ago as my followers were being murdered, but the blood trolls were always too strong.

With you lies the last and best chance of our survival.
