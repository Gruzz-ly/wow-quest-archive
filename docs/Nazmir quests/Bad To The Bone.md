==Objectives==
Slay 10 Bone Raptors.
* [[Bone Raptor]] slain (10)

==Description==
I will not leave here without killing [[Zulajin]], or else it will just go after de next [[caravan]] dat comes through.

I have a plan, but we must work together to pull it off.

Dere are [[skeletal raptor]]s roaming in de area. I do not know what [[voodoo]] brought dem here, but we need dem gone.

We are going to need as much space as possible for my plan to kill Zulajin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
You have done well taking care of de bone raptors. Even if dis road is only for criminals, dey at least deserve to make it to [[Vol'dun]] alive.

==Notes==

==Progression==
