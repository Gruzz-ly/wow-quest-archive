==Objectives==
Defeat 12 Zandalari forces within the [[Fallen Outpost]].
* [[Zandalari]] slain  (12)
* Meet with [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]] further within the Fallen Outpost.

==Description==
We are within reach of the [[Blood Gate]] in [[Zandalar]]. Once we take that, the [[Horde]] and Zandalari will believe our full invasion has begun.

Our forces have already engaged the Zandalari within the Fallen Outpost. We'll need your help to push them back.

I'll be focusing on finishing off what remains of the Horde and Zandalari back in [[Zul'jan Ruins|Zul'jan ruins]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We've taken Zul'jan ruins, and with your help our army will finish off the remaining Zandalari here.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Zandalari Witch Doctor]]s, [[Zandalari Prelate (War Campaign)|Zandalari Prelates]], and [[Zandalari Bruiser]]s.
