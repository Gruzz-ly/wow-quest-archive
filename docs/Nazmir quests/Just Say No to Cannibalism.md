==Objectives==
Kill Corpse Mongers Jal'aka, Yon'gi, and Nog'shra
* [[Corpse Monger Nog'shra]] slain
* [[Corpse Monger Yon'gi]] slain
* [[Corpse Monger Jal'aka]] slain

==Description==
Of course the [[Natha'vor tribe|Natha'vor]] [[Blood troll|trolls]] have [[Shoak]]! Why would it be easy?

I'm sick and tired of running from these trolls. That's why you're going in to end this.

The Natha'vor trolls have three powerful troll [[witch doctor]]s called "corpse mongers". Take them out and you'll send the tribe into disarray.

Of course, this could all fail spectacularly and make my terrible day even worse.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
I'm still here. Why are you?

==Completion==
Good work. The Natha'vor trolls should be in disarray now that those... things are out of the picture.

==Notes==
