==Objectives==
Speak with Talanji to power up the A.F.M.O.D.
* Speak with [[Talanji]] to power up the [[A.F.M.O.D.]]

==Description==
We got the A.F.M.O.D. repaired and it works perfectly! Eh, except that it's got no power.

Princess [[Talanji]] seems like she can help us out with this. Ask her if she can give the mech a jumpstart!

Once we're set, we can use this thing to mow down the [[Alliance]], take back [[Zul'jan Ruins|Zul'jan ruins]], and push forward to blow up that fleet!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Uh, can we get this thing started or what?

==Completion==
Hahaha! Now it's time to show these guys how we roll.
