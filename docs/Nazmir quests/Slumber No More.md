==Objectives==
Examine the deactivated [[Titanic watcher|titan keeper]] outside of [[Gloom Hollow]].
* [[Titan Keeper Hezrel|Deactivated titan keeper]] awakened
* [[Damaged Core]] recovered
* Core installed

==Description==
There's something you should look into. You've got the time anyway, [[Gob Squad|those goblins]] aren't ready yet.

There's a statue nearby. Only, it's not a statue to the trained [[tortollan]] eye. It's a deactivated titan keeper!

Noises have been coming from that thing ever since you helped [[Krag'wa]]. It must be trying to reactivate itself.

I bet that [[titan]]-looking amulet of yours could help restart it. We'd be unstoppable against the [[blood troll]]s with a titan keeper's help.

Go see if you can restart this titan!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Progress==
Core detected. Appreciation for retrieval.

==Completion==
Your aid is required. We must begin.

==Notes==
Awaken the 'statue':
:{{Text|say|Deactivated Titan Keeper|Bl-bl-bl-bl... <static> [[Azerite|blood of Azeroth]] detected. Request: installation of missing dat-dat-dat-dat... <static> core.}}
Recover the data core on the ground and install it on the titan keeper:
:''The keeper stands up.''
:{{Text|say|Titan Keeper Hezrel|Titan Keeper Hezrel rebooted. Protocol: contain rampant corruption within Nazmir. Task impossible due to damaged systems.}}

==Progression==
{{Everything Contained}}
