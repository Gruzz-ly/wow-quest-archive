==Objectives==
Defeat 10 Sethrak.
* [[Sethrak]] forces slain (10)

==Description==
These things called the sethrak think that we're easily handled. That's only because we were ambushed and not ready for a fight.

Well, all right, perhaps we were easily handled. But that doesn't mean we won't strike back.

Kill as many of those sethrak as you can. I don't know who they are or what they want, but I do know one thing.

They signed their death warrants when they attacked my squad and cut me in half.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Good! I could hear their screams from here. They will remember the [[Horde]]!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Chadwick Paxton|I'll move up ahead to higher ground. Let the squad know to rendezvous on my location.}}
:{{text|say|Chadwick Paxton|Hmph... desert in a swamp... what are the sethrak up to?}}

Kill [[Sethrak Ravager]]s, [[Sethrak Warden]]s, [[Sethrak Skycaller]]s, and [[Sethrak Warbringer]]s.
