==Objectives==
Activate the power of the [[totem]]s and restore [[Krag'wa]].
* [[Frog Totem Pile]]s activated (3)

==Description==
I am fed and my body is prepared. I can now be instilled with my power of old and for a time will be immune to their blood curses and leeching powers.

Use the magic of the [[Firefly|glowflies]] to channel my power from the totems into me.
Soon you will see me restored. Then we will destroy the army that prepares across the river to take all that is mine by force.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Progress==
I had hoped this ritual would never be needed.

==Completion==
I feel like myself again, back when I had hundreds of followers pouring their faith into me. My power will fade, but the [[Blood troll|trolls]] shall learn to fear Krag'wa once more!

==Notes==

First totem

:{{text|say|Krag'wa the Huge|Ah, my strength is returning! Quickly, unleash the magic from another totem.}}

Second totem

:{{text|say|Krag'wa the Huge|Good! My might grows! Unleash the power of the Tinal totem.}}

Third totem

:{{text|say|Krag'wa the Huge|I am...whole! Now it is time for my revenge!}}

Krag'wa's body seemed to expand and emit magical light.
