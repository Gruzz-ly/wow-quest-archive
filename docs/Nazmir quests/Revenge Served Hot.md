==Objectives==
Use [[Ticker]]'s Rocket Launcher to slay 4 Vilescale Behemoths.
* [[Vilescale Behemoth]] slain (4)
* [[Ticker's Rocket Launcher]] (provided)

==Description==
Look, the [[Patch (goblin)|boss]] might be keeping a level head here, but we should show these [[naga]] what happens when you mess with the [[Gob Squad]]. Don't you agree?

The naga are sending their [[naga brute|behemoths]] to destroy what's left of our ship. Why don't you take my rocket launcher and make an example out of them. That'll send the message loud and clear!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ticker's Spare Catalyst
|Nazmani Warplate Waistguard
|Loa Speaker's Cinch
|Death-Pledged Girdle

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Completion==
There you go! Let's have a moment of silence for the not so dearly departed.

Aaaaaaand... done!

==Notes==
