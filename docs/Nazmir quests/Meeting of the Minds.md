==Objectives==
Meet [[Shandris Feathermoon]] outside of [[Zo'bal Ruins]].
* Speak with Shandris Feathermoon {{co|42.1|39.7|Nazmir}}
* Listen on [[Horde]] Meeting {{co|40.3|44.0|Nazmir}}

==Description==
We're in luck. The missive details a meeting in Zo'bal Ruins between [[Talanji]], [[Rokhan]], [[Ranger Captain Areiel|Areiel]], and [[Blood Prince Dreven]].

This is our chance to gain more intel on Dreven and his next move. He killed our soldiers in [[Vol'dun]], it's time for him to pay.

Meet me outside of Zo'bal Ruins. We're going to sneak into the ruins, listen to their plans, and decide what to do next.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let's move.

==Completion==
Dreven will be inside of an enclosed tunnel? This is too perfect. Let's move.

==Notes==
Speak with Shandris:
:Stay hidden. Only one of us should go in. I'll stay here to make sure no one finds out what we're doing.
:I have a flask of invisibility that you can use to sneak in there. It should render you completely unseen... for a small amount of time.
:Drink from the flask, then sneak in to the ruins. Find out what the Horde are planning, then get out.
{{gossip|Why do you have a flask of invisibility?}}
:We're within a stone's throw of a major Horde gathering spot and you want to know why I have a bottle that can turn you invisible?
:{{gossip|Yes.}}
::... I'll tell you when the war is over.
:{{gossip|Nevermind.}}

{{gossip|(Take the the flask of invisibility.)}}

Use the [[Invisibility Flask]] and head south into the [[Zo'bal Ruins]]:
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|Apologies for my delay, Rokhan. Tell me of your status here. Has dis Captain Areiel been useful?}}
:{{text|say|Rokhan|Areiel be killin' both da [[Alliance]] and [[blood troll]] forces and helped us establish a base in da [[Necropolis (Nazmir)|Necropolis]].}}
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|And yet she is not here. Is she too busy to give a simple status report?}}
:{{text|say|Blood Prince Dreven|Captain Areiel is not coming because she is slain, Talanji.}}
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|Princess Talanji to you, Prince Dreven. And how do you know dat?}}
:{{text|say|Blood Prince Dreven|Call it one of my special traits. The Alliance have disrupted the Horde forces in the Necropolis and killed Areiel in the process.}}
:{{text|say|Rokhan|[[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] ain't gonna like dat. We need ta be movin' fast on our plan ta stop da Alliance, Prince Dreven.}}
:{{text|say|Rokhan|Dere be a collapsed tunnel dat connects [[Nazmir]] ta [[Vol'dun]]. Take ya followers, use ya powers ta clear da rubble, den we be attackin' da main Alliance forces.}}
:{{text|say|Blood Prince Dreven|You want us to use our abilities... to move rocks. And why should I follow you, troll?}}
:{{text|say|Rokhan|Because part of ya agreement with Sylvanas was respectin' da hierarchy of authority within da Horde, and brudda, I be outrankin' ya.}}
:{{text|say|Blood Prince Dreven|... I shall do as you ask, for now. We will clear this tunnel and send word when your forces can move out.}}
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|I do not trust dis Dreven, Rokhan. It is not wise to involve [[san'layn]], of all things, in [[Fourth War|dis conflict]].}}
:{{text|say|Rokhan|Sylvanas wants ta give 'em a chance. Dey got no home left. If dey can work with us, den dey got a home with da Horde. If not, dey be gone.}}
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|I see. I shall return to [[Zuldazar]]. Keep me informed of de Horde operations in Nazmir. And be careful, Rokhan.}}
:{{text|say|Rokhan|Always, princess.}}
