==Objectives==
Place 4 Sanctifying Totems down in the area.
* [[Sanctifying Totem]] placed (4)

==Description==
We are so close to weakening dis [[Jungo|herald]], <name>. Dis is our final push. De nearby area is brimming with [[blood magic]].

While you were fighting, I was working on creating [[totem]]s dat can cleanse de area of blood magic.

Take dese totems and place dem nearby. Dey should drain some of de blood magic out of de area.

De herald should be weak enough for us to actually kill after all dis.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Talanji's Expedition]]
* +250 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Have you put de totems down yet?

==Completion==
De blood magic is dissipating from dis place. It is time for us to strike, before de [[blood troll]]s gain any more advantages.
