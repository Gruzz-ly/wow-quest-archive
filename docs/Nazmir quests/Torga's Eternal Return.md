==Objectives==
Use [[Lashk]]'s Scroll of Eternal Return to put Torga's spirit to rest.
* [[Torga]]'s [[ghost|spirit]] put to rest
* [[Scroll of Eternal Return]] (provided)

==Description==
Well, we did it. Doesn't make the plan we had any less crazy. But there's still one more thing left to do.

I've been visiting Torga for years. He told me stories of powerful scrolls, one in particular that he said was meant to be used to put a [[loa]]'s spirit to rest.

I think you should be the one to read it. I mean, if you're SMART enough to read it. 

Bah! Just take the scroll and read it before I have second thoughts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You can read that scroll, can you?

==Completion==
I guess we're in this for the long haul. Lashk and I have a lot to take care of if we're going to help.

I even know where you could go to find that troll friend of yours... and [[Krag'wa]].

==Notes==
Use the [[Scroll of Eternal Return]]. A large [[Spirit of Torga]] appears and proceeds to shrink...
:{{text|say|Lashk|Goodbye, Torga. I will remember the stories you told me... and share them with others.}}
:{{text|say|Kisha|And I'll make sure all our people know how bravely you stood against G'huun.}}
:{{text|say|[[Princess Talanji]]|I will not rest until G'huun and de [[blood troll]]s are nothing but a memory. Dis I swear to you, Torga.}}
:''Suddenly, tiny [[Torga]].''
:{{text|say|Kisha|What in the name of...}}
:{{text|say|Lashk|Hah! That sly old [[turtle]]... He wasn't ready to rest, he wanted to be reincarnated!}}
:''As Lashk walks up to tiny Torga, picks him up and sets him on his head.''
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|Take good care of dat loa, Lashk. <Name> and I need to seek out more help.}}
:{{text|say|Lashk|Okay, okay. We'll stand with you against this [[G'huun|Blood God]], Princess. Just stop pestering me about it!}}
:{{text|say|Kisha|I bet I can convince the other tortollans still in Nazmir to help. Maybe [[Shoak]] and [[Kajosh]] will come, too!}}
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|Thank you both. Your loyalty means much to me... and to all [[Zandalari]].}}
