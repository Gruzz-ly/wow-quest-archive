We're all here. Let's begin.

: ''Mathias and Genn walk off into the maze as Jaina briefly addresses you.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I'll prepare a way to move our troops to Nazmir. We'll meet you in the [[Far Reach]], <name>.}}
: ''Jaina leaves, leaving Halford and [[Blademaster Telaamon]] alone. They turn to each other.''
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|This is your last moment to back away, Telaamon. We can find others for this position, I am willing to do this myself.}}
:{{text|say|Blademaster Telaamon|You said this is suicide{{sic}} mission, yes? That no one will return.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|That's correct. Whoever goes will act as bait for the Horde and will be slaughtered by their forces... while our main fleet deploys.}}
:{{text|say|Blademaster Telaamon|I understand this well. Halford, I watched as [[Argus|my own planet]] became a bitter, dead husk.}}
:{{text|say|Blademaster Telaamon|All because of the desire for power that [[Man'ari eredar|some of my people]] could not control.}}
:{{text|say|Blademaster Telaamon|Your Horde, if left unchecked, will mean the doom of [[Azeroth|this planet]].}}
:{{text|say|Blademaster Telaamon|I am willing to pay any price to ensure no one goes through the same pain that I did, Halford.}}
: ''Halford salutes.''
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|... Thank you, Telaamon. [[Light]] be with you.}}
: ''Telaamon returns the gesture as they part ways.''
:{{text|say|Blademaster Telaamon|And may it be with you, Halford. The Light's power shines brightly within you. Do not lose it.}}

In the Far Reach, the Alliance army consists of [[Void Elf Mage]]s, [[Dark Iron Shaman]], [[7th Legion Marine]]s, [[7th Legion Rifleman (Battle for Azeroth)|7th Legion Riflemen]], [[Gilnean Ambusher]]s, and [[Night Elf Sentinel (Nazmir)|Night Elf Sentinels]], led by Jaina, Telaamon, Mathias Shaw, and [[Brother Pike]].
