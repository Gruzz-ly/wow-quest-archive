==Objectives==
Destroy 8 Corrupted [[Loa]]'s Blood with the Scroll of Purification and recover and the Scroll of Fate's Hand.
* [[Corrupted Loa Blood]] destroyed (8)
* [[Damaged Scroll of Fate's Hand]]
* [[Scroll of Purification]] (provided)

==Description==
Okay, you want to kill the [[Jungo|herald]] of a blood god? We can figure something out.

There's corrupted blood nearby that's feeding this monster's power. Lucky for you, I've heard stories of this sort of thing before.

Take this scroll, but be careful with it! It'll destroy the corrupted blood that's feeding [[Jungo]].

Oh, and I need you to find a scroll [[Holbruk]] was carrying, called the Scroll of Fate's Hand. It's REALLY powerful. We'll need it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Talanji's Expedition]]
* +250 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Did you get that scroll and deal with the corrupted blood?

==Completion==
Good! Looks like that herald was weakened by what you did, and you got the scroll! Be careful, it's ancient!

Holbruk always talked about how powerful that scroll was. We're going to see if he was right.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|We need to find out what else de [[blood troll]]s are up to. [[Lashk]], Kisha, do you have anything dat might... conceal our efforts?}}
:{{text|say|Lashk|Of course. I've got scrolls older than you are! Kisha, have a look through my stuff.}}
:{{text|say|Kisha|Meh, this could take all day! Princess you don't realize how many scrolls this old timer has.}}
:{{text|say|Kisha|Let's see... [[:Scroll of Eternal Return]] sound right?}}
:{{text|say|Lashk|No! Did you even bother reading it? But, uh, keep that handy. We'll need it when we're done with this mess.}}
:{{text|say|Kisha|Oh dear... this one looks  like it's written in the [[Old Gods]]' [[Shath'Yar|language]]. Where did you come across something like this?}}
:{{text|say|Lashk|I never told you that story? Oh, It was amazing! Let's see, where to begin...}}
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|Focus! Dis is not de time for stories!}}
:{{text|say|Kisha|Fine... Hmm... Here it is! Scroll of Invisibility... This has to be it.}}
:{{text|say|Lashk|Ha! I knew I had that somewhere. This will keep us hidden enough to sneak around the blood trolls. Just stay close to me.}}
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|Good! Time to move. But remember, stay quiet! De last thing we need is you two getting captured.}}

;Description
You know what's just as important as killing the herald of G'huun? Getting our stuff back! The trolls have been taking our people AND our relics. I saw some trolls just TOSSING them into chests, like they were nothing! I need you to get our relics back before those idiots break them. They don't make relics like this anymore! Oh, also. Holbrook had an important thing called the "Scroll of Fate's Hand". See about getting that back, we'll need it.
