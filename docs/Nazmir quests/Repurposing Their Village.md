==Objectives==
Defeat 12 blood trolls within Zalamar.
* Defeat [[blood troll]]s within [[Zalamar]] (12)

==Description==
[[Jaina Proudmoore|Myself]] and [[Mathias Shaw|Shaw]] will provide support for [[Blademaster Telaamon|Telaamon]]'s army until our distraction is set up.

First, we need to clear the blood trolls out of their nearby village, Zalamar, in order to move our army forward.

That's where you come in. We need you to assault the blood trolls there to weaken their forces, then our army will arrive.

Telaamon will be on site to help you, meet with him once you've weakened their forces.

I will be here with Shaw ensuring our forces aren't seen.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must move, time is of the essence.

==Completion==
How many did you kill? Hrm... seems as if we are at the same number. Good work.

==Notes==
*Eligible mobs are [[Obedient Drudge]]s, [[Warspawn Rider]]s, [[Zalamar Warrior]]s, [[Warspawn Rider]]s, [[Blood Crawg]]s, and [[Zalamar Bloodsinger]]s.
