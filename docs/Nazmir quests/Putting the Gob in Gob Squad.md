==Objectives==
Rescue the [[Gob Squad]].
* [[Ticker]] found
* [[Newt]] found
* [[Grit]] found
* [[Volt]] found

==Description==
Yo! We gotta get the rest of the Gob Squad back if we wanna fix the [[A.F.M.O.D.]]!

So, our mech got trashed. It was rough. The rest of the Gob Squad are hidin' out there, waiting for word when it's safe.

Take this tracker. It'll tell ya when you're getting close to one of the squad. When you get real close, you should see 'em.

That'll tell any of the squad nearby that it's safe to come outta hidin' and come back here.

With the right [[goblin]]s and parts, we'll be killing [[Alliance]] in no time!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You didn't blow up the Gob Squad tracker, did you?

==Completion==
I gotta tell ya, it feels good to get the gang back.

==Notes==
*Follow the signal from the Distance from Hidden Gob Squad button.
