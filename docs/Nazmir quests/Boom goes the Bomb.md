Call artillery strikes on the [[Blood troll|Blood Troll]] [[Barricade (Nazmir)|Barricades]] in [[Zul'Nazman]].
* First Barricade destroyed
* Second Barricade destroyed
* Third Barricade destroyed
* [[Seaforium Smoke Grenade]] (provided)

==Description==
Just look at 'em... those blood trolls are holed up pretty good down there in that fortress of theirs. Multiple defensive lines, lots of equipment, they got everything.

They're completely unprepared for us! I almost feel sorry for 'em!

Let's start off by showing 'em what we think of their cute attempts at making [[barricade]]s. Here, take these smoke grenades and put a signal right on top of them. We'll see how well they hold up to high explosives!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Completion==
Good job! Now we can move deeper into dis den of evil.

==Notes==

Destroy the first obstacle:

Patch yells: Whoa! You got their attention now! Big horde incoming! 

A large group of blood trolls charged forward, but Bwonsamdi killed them all with a powerful spell.

Bwonsamdi says: Haha! Ya tink I gonna let ya die when ya still owe me? 

Bwonsamdi says: Da rest of dese fellas be all yours. Have fun, but don't forget ya still be payin' me a debt. Send me their souls!

After destroying all the obstacles, Talanji and Rokhan will follow.

Princess Talanji says: Good, de path is open! Now all dat remains is to clean out de vermin.
