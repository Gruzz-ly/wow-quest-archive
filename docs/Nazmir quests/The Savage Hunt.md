==Objectives==
Kill 15 [[blood troll]]s and their allies within [[Torga's Rest]].
* Blood trolls and allies slain  (15)
* Meet Keeshan at [[Redfield's Watch]].

==Description==
The blood trolls in [[Nazmir]] are monsters, pure and simple. No culture, no empathy, they only exist to destroy.

Let's kill 'em and let whatever dark god they worship sort them out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
The only good blood troll is a dead blood troll. And even that's stretching it.

==Completion==
We've been fending off blood troll attacks on [[Fort Victory]] for too long. Good to know they got what's coming to them.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Keeshan, you're allowed to be at ease around me.}}
:{{text|say|John J. Keeshan|Ma'am, I read your file from [[SI:7]]. You've been alive for more than ten thousand years, fought in more wars than I can ever imagine.}}
:{{text|say|John J. Keeshan|Far as I'm concerned, I'm barely worthy of serving next to you. Least I can do is keep quiet and show you respect.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|You are a hero in your own way, Keeshan, from your service in the first three wars to your acts of heroism in Redridge.}}
:{{text|say|John J. Keeshan|How does a decorated elven general know about someone like me?}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|You're not the only one who requests files from SI:7.}}

Eligible mobs are [[Crawg Rider]]s, [[Blood Crawg]]s, [[Loa-Gutter Impaler]]s, and [[Loa-Gutter Scavenger]]s.

Originally, when the player was in the area, the buff Alliance Support was available, granting a chance to summon John Keeshan, Shandris Feathermoon, or the three Sentinels ([[Sentinel Falia|Falia]], [[Sentinel Lyrias|Lyrias]], and [[Sentinel Aeolyn|Aeolyn]]) to fight alongside the player for several seconds. Near the end of ''Battle for Azeroth'', the buff was changed to "Kee-La's Support" which relates to the ''[[World of Warcraft: Shadowlands|Shadowlands]]'' content of [[Exile's Rise]], and currently no one spawns for aid.

When they spawned, they said:
*{{text|say|John J. Keeshan|Reminds me of the Second War.}}
*{{text|say|John J. Keeshan|Just like the Third War.}}
*{{text|say|John J. Keeshan|Just like in {{Au|Draenor}}!}}
*{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I am here to help, to battle!}}
*{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|In memory of [[Darnassus]]!}}
*{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I fight for my people.}}

==Progression==
