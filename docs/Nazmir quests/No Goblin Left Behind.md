==Objectives==
Locate and rescue the missing members of the [[Gob Squad]].
* [[Grit]] rescued
* [[Newt]] rescued
* [[Volt]] rescued

==Description==
Our mission is dead in the water unless we move fast!

I've found the perfect spot for a new base. While I secure the location, I need you to rescue the team and bring them back. We've trained for this a million times. Just direct them toward the rendezvous point and they'll find the way.

We don't have much time, let's go!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Completion==
Everyone's present and accounted for. Outstanding job!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Patch (goblin)|Patch]]|There's a hidden spot over on the other side of these ruins that would make a perfect base of operations. Tell the team to rendezvous there.}}
:''Patch runs off.''

:{{text|say|Newt|Thought I was gonna suffocate in there! Thanks, pal!}}
:{{text|say|Volt|Thanks! I'll see you at the rendezvous!}}
:{{text|say|Grit|Thanks for saving' my hide!}}

After everyone is present:
:{{text|say|[[Patch (goblin)|Patch]]|Great to see you all made it back in one piece, thanks to... hey, there's the guy of the hour!}}
