==Objectives==
Accompany [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]] to [[Fort Victory]] in [[Nazmir]].
* Speak with [[Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth|Jes-Tereth]] to travel to Nazmir

==Description==
We sent troops with [[Captain Conrad]] ahead to Nazmir to gain a foothold in that hellish jungle.

The reports we've been receiving of the local troll population are... disconcerting.

They're in over their heads, <name>. I have Brann Bronzebeard prepped and ready to head out.

Accompany Brann to Nazmir so we can secure our position. The [[Wind's Redemption]] is at your disposal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I've wrestled with death, <race>. It's the most unexcitin' contest ye can imagine.

==Notes==
Behind Jes-Tereth are [[Brann Bronzebeard]] and [[Glibb]]. Speak with the Grand Admiral:
:This ship is yours to command, <name>. I have the crew prepared for any eventuality.

:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|We sent Captain Conrad ahead to build a fort. They say the blood trolls here might even be willin' ta trade, but I cannae imagine that'd come at a price worth payin'.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Still, this here's a land that works 'gainst the Zandalari and their Horde associates. The enemy of yer enemy is yer... wait, what's that sayin'?}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|No matter. Look. Listen. Keep those sharp eyes peeled. Unforgivin' lands aren't known ta forgive the unwary, <name>.}}

:{{text|say|"Silvermoon" Harry|Ah! Ah ha! Right to the point, yes, yes. Not to worry! All is in order. Let's retire to safer environs behind our fort's walls, yes?}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Alright, no sign o' the Captain then. What's goin' on?}}
:{{text|say|"Silvermoon" Harry|Nothing untoward, I assure you! Our glorious Captain is off negotiating trade agreements with the local trolls.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Heard they were savages wot practice bloody sacrifices.}}
:{{text|say|"Silvermoon" Harry|Oh heavens! Well, indeed, yes. I suppose that is accurate, mmm. But Captain Conrad is a glory to behold. Impressive, no doubt.}}
:{{text|say|"Silvermoon" Harry|Trade agreements with trolls! We even have bats prepared to send another trade offering to Zalamar.}}
