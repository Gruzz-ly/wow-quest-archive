==Objectives==
Recover 10 A.F.M.O.D. parts from [[Gilnean Ambusher]]s and [[Night Elf Sentinel (Nazmir)|Night Elf Sentinels]].
* [[A.F.M.O.D. Part]] (10)

==Description==
Alright, so, we're goin' after the [[Alliance]] through this crazy fog. We gotta retake [[Zo'bal Ruins|Zo'bal ruins]] up ahead.

We can do that real easy if we fix up our mech, [[A.F.M.O.D.]] - a flying mech of death! 

The Alliance wrecked it in their initial attack and took a bunch of its parts. Get those parts back and we'll have this thing fixed in no time!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You got the parts? We'll figure out what goes where when it's all done.

==Completion==
Great! We'll get this thing fixed in no time.

==Notes==
*Rogues are given the quest [[Minesweeper]] instead of this one.

==Progression==
{{Fly Out to Meet Them}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.1.0|note=Added.}}
