==Objectives==
Have [[Ingrid Bellix‎|Ingrid]] empower the Skycaller Gem.
* Skycaller Gem empowered
* [[Skycaller Gem]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[sethrak]] seem to believe there's something in [[Nazmir]] that can unlock the destructive power of this gem.

We don't have that, but we have the next best thing. An insane [[warlock]] who is willing to experiment with [[magic]].

Speak with Ingrid and have her begin the process to unlock the true power of this gem.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==

==Completion==
That gem appears ready to do some damage. Let's just... point it elsewhere, for now.
