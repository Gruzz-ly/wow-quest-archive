Hidden memories, [[Shade (ghost)|spirits]] attackin' us for investigating, and a long road of bodies in da wake of me makin' [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] [[warchief]].

I be thinkin' it time ya speak with Ol' [[Bwonsamdi]]. Odd as it sounds, dis don't seem like his style. Dat don't mean he not be behind it.

Ya best work with Talanji. From what little I been seein', da death [[loa]] got a soft spot for her highness. You can confront Bwonsamdi at his necropolis in Nazmir. Just... be respectful.
