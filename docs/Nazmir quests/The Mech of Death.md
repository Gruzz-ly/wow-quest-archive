==Objectives==
Defeat the A.M.O.D.
* [[A.M.O.D.]] slain
* Meet with [[Blademaster Telaamon]] further within the Fallen Outpost.

==Description==
We have reports of a [[goblin]] machine causing havoc among our troops up ahead. They call it the A.M.O.D.

It is a crude machine [[Lightforged Warframe|compared to what]] the [[Lightforged draenei|Lightforge]] have aboard the [[Vindicaar]].

Together, you and I will bring down this machine. Go, I will await for you near the machine and engage it when you are ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You fought well! It is a shame we must part soon, I would have enjoyed fighting side by side with you.
