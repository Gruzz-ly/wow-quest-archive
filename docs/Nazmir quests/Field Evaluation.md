==Objectives==
Use the [[A.M.O.D.]] to destroy the [[naga]] [[camp]]s and defeat [[Grobathan]].
* A.M.O.D. Mounted
* [[Naga]] forces slain (40)
* Grobathan slain

==Description==
We got the A.M.O.D. back together. It's a fine piece of equipment, but we're gonna have to give it a tune up. We don't want to end up digging shrapnel out of our rears.

Lucky for us, there are a few naga camps remaining along with the [[Sea giant|giant]] that broke the gun in the first place. They'll be great for target practice.

We'll deploy the A.M.O.D. just outside the building here. After we deploy, go man it. I'll have you fire a few rounds while I tune its gun.

Everything'll be fine... unless it isn't.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Spare Stabilizer Band
|Nazmani Warplate Wargreaves
|Loa Speaker's Trousers
|Death-Pledged Legguards
|Ritual Flayer's Legwraps
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Progress==
That went great! See, I told you everything would be fine.

==Completion==
Great job! The A.M.O.D. needs a few more tweaks but it'll be nothing we can't handle.

Oh, and hey... good shooting!

:{{text|say|Patch|We need to check the accuracy of the gun before we can do anything else, so why not get rid of a few of those naga at the same time?}}
:{{text|say|Patch|Whoa, watch out!  They've got cannons firing on our position!  Take em out with some cluster shots!}}
:{{text|say|Patch|Giant in coming! Hey, that's the guy that wrecked our ship! Time for some payback!}}
