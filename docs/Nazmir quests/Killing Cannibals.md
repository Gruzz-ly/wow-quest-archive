==Objectives==
Kill 10 Natha'vor Cannibals.
* [[Natha'vor Cannibal]] slain (10)

==Description==
[[Shoak]] and I have had a few run-ins with the [[Natha'vor tribe|Natha'vor]] [[Blood troll|trolls]]. Must be why they wanted to capture that idiot.

The women in that tribe actually eat the men... and anyone else they can get their hands on. I'm sure they're getting ready to eat Shoak.

Do us all a favor and kill some of those [[cannibal]]s. The world would be a better place without them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Well? Did you take care of those cannibals?

==Completion==
I could hear their screams from here.

These blood trolls are monsters, <race>. Who eats their own people?
