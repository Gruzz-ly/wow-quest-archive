;Riding to the [[Far Reach]]
:{{Text|say|General Rakera|Princess Talanji, de source of de fog is de artifact de [[Horde]] [[Adventurer|champion]] stole from de [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tirans]].}}
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|How could dat be? It was given to [[Rastakhan|my father]] and placed within de treasury.}}
:{{Text|say|General Rakera|I just received a report dat de treasury was broken into. De Alliance must have stolen de artifact.}}
