Slay Grand Ma'da Ateena.
*[[Grand Ma'da Ateena]] slain

==Description==
{{questportrait|Grand Ma'da Ateena.jpg|Grand Ma'da Ateena|Without their leader, the blood trolls will be a disorganized rabble.}}

You have proven to be a much greater ally dan I could have ever hoped. Thanks to you and your [[Horde]], we have come dis far. Now, there is only one thing dat remains.

We must confront de leader of de [[blood troll]]s and put an end to their dark plot once and for all.

Without Ateena's mojo to protect it, we can finally destroy dat monstrosity of theirs before it can be unleashed upon [[Zuldazar]].

You know what must be done.

First, I must prepare myself. Go. I will join you when de battle has begun.

* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Talanji's Expedition]]
*[[Small Azerite Cluster]] (150x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Completion==
Finally, our battle here is done!

More importantly, you have made good friends with de [[tortollan]]s and have gained powerful allies in de [[loa]]. I feel dat we will need to call upon their aid in de future.

It is time for me to return to Zuldazar and let my [[Rastakhan|father]] know of our victory. 

Do you hear dat? [[Rokhan]] appears to have a message for us.

Entering the cutscene, as Grand Ma'da Ateena dies, the blood defense shield around Taloc also begins to dissipate.

Princess Talanji: De shield! It has begun to fade!

Patch: You heard the princess! Let 'er rip!

A.M.O.D. fired a magic shell, which directly hit the defenseless Taloc. The ground beneath Taloc collapsed rapidly and then struggled to fall into a bottomless deep pit.
