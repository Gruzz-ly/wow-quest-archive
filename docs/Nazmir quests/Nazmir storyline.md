In this chain, the player is sent to a recently established Horde camp in Nazmir: the [[Gloom Hollow]]. According to Kisha, this place was used as the last stop by the tortollan in their pilgrimage. She also asks the adventurer to recruit more tortollans along the way to meet up at that point. Afterward, [[Shadow Hunter Mutumba]] requests aid in the investigation of [[Frogmarsh]], and [[Witch Doctor Zentimo]] is eventually found injured by blood trolls there. The player is then sent to recover Krag'wa idols in the area, and to kill the local blood troll leader: [[Warmother Boatema]]. The player then meets Krag'wa in his [[Krag'wa's Burrow|burrow]], and the frog loa requests the Horde champion to perform the Rite of Krag'wa with Zentimo's body. In this ritual, the witch doctor's spirit is released, and many frogs come out of his body. After feeding Krag'wa with local meat, the Horde champion gathers local glowflies to the frog loa. The loa uses the flies' magical essence to draw stored power in his totems and then becomes powerful enough to attack the blood troll camp nearby. At the end of this questline, To Serve Krag'wa's quest becomes available.
