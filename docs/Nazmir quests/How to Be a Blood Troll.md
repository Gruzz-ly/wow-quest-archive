==Objectives==
Test 5 Unproven Drudges.
* [[Unproven Drudge]] tested  (5)

==Description==
You will have to blend in if you don't want anyone getting suspicious. This won't be pretty.

Dere are drudges around de camp who have been tied up as part of a ritual. Dey get beaten as a test to make dem stronger.

Any who fail de ritual are sacrificed. De ones who succeed are allowed to fight de [[Zandalari]].

If you are going to blend in, you need to "test" dese drudges as part of de ritual. It's weird, but dat's how dey work.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Talanji's Expedition]]

==Progress==
It is not a pretty task, but dese trolls are not our allies.

==Completion==
Good work, nobody suspects a thing. Did any of dem crack under de pressure?

==Notes==
Interact with [[Prisoner Binding]]s.

*{{text|say|Unproven Drudge|I not be weak, I be feelin' no pain! I be ready ta kill!}}

Walking near an [[Obedient Drudge]]:
*{{text|say|Obedient Drudge|Sorry, ma'da. I be out of ya way real quick.}}

Just outside Jo'chunga's hut are two [[Warspawn Rider]]s. Walking near them, the one sitting on the fence will say:
*{{text|say|Warspawn Rider|Better be gettin' ya knife nice an' sharp. I be hearin' we gonna fight dem Zandalari soon.}}
