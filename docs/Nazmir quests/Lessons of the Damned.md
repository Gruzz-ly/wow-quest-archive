==Objectives==
Learn of Captain Conrad's progress.
* Follow Captain Conrad {{co|45.7|59.8|Nazmir}}
* [[Captain Conrad]] slain

==Description==
When I arrived here in disguise, the [[blood troll]]s thought me some sort of messenger of their [[G'huun|Blood God]].

I seized the advantage and played into their primitive beliefs.

I came here intending to open trade and learn how we can work with them against the [[Horde]].

What I discovered was altogether more compelling. I will show you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Out o' her mind, wasn't she?

==Completion==
Dreadful business, <name>. I was set on a rescue or corpse recovery. To see one o' our own that far gone was... unsettlin'.

What's done is done. I'll send a report back to [[Halford Wyrmbane|Halford]]. Don't bother yerself with the busy work this time.

:{{text|say|Captain Conrad|There is much to understand about them yet. This [[blood magic]]... it is more potent than you could possibly imagine.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Conrad|The methods of the Nazmani were... offputting, at first. But I know them now. They are a simple people with simple desires.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Conrad|The desire for power. The yearning for the greater truth. The will of blood.}}

:''Conrad kills the Zandalari and puts the adventurer on the spike.''
:{{text|say|Captain Conrad|This is nothing personal, you understand. But, you cannot be allowed to interrupt the progress I have made. The things I have learned... what I have yet to discover.}}

:{{text|yell|Brann Bronzebeard|Aaacchh, shut yer trap!}}
:{{text|yell|Captain Conrad|Urrrggrh!}}

Defeat her and three [[Nazmani Drudge]]s:

:{{text|say|"Silvermoon" Harry|Oh dear. That is much worse than I feared. My deepest apologies for putting you in such a risky situation, sir Bronzebeard.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Eh, not the worst I've seen. Still a sad story, though. We'll need to let the High Commander know what transpired.}}
