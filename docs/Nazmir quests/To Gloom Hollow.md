==Objectives==
Recruit tortollans to your cause on the way to [[Gloom Hollow]].
* [[Tortollan]]s recruited (3)

==Description==
There's only one safe area in [[Nazmir]] that this Rokhan and your other [[Horde]] friends could be in. Gloom Hollow.

Lucky for you, it's also close to [[Krag'wa]]'s den. We used Gloom Hollow as a last stop on our pilgrimage.

Make your way to Gloom Hollow along the path I've marked on your map, and tell any tortollans along the way to meet us there.

They'll be interested in seeing the end of this story. We'll make our way there and grab anyone else we find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well? We should get moving to Gloom Hollow.

==Completion==
Good ta see ya, <name>. [[Princess Talanji]] be tellin' me all about [[Torga]] and da tortollans. Guess we lucky dat we got sometin' outta dis.

We be here, waitin' on reinforcements from da Horde.

==Notes==
;On approach to [[Crez]]
:{{text|say|Crez|Where's Kisha? I thought she'd be here to give directions...}}

Speak with Crez:
{{Dialogue|
Eh? What do you want? I'm ready to head home, there's nothing interesting happening here anymore.

{{Gossip|(Tell Crez about what happened to Torga, and the chance for new stories to be told if he goes to Gloom Hollow.)}}
}}
:''They proceed to stand up and start heading to Gloom Hollow.''
:{{text|say|Crez|You all did... WHAT? I'm not missing this story, I'll head to Gloom Hollow.}}

;On approach to [[Korkush]]
:{{text|say|Korkush|Meh, Torga's dead and now I've got nothing to tell the others when I get back.}}

Speak with Korkush:
{{Dialogue|
Bah, Torga's dead, the blood trolls have overrun this place... the entire pilgrimage is ruined! There's not point in me staying here.

{{Gossip|(Tell Korkush there's a great story to be had if he helps the Horde fight the blood trolls and save the Zandalari.)}}
}}
:''They proceed to stand up and start heading to Gloom Hollow.''
:{{text|say|Korkush|Huh... well, I guess fighting a horde of blood trolls would be an interesting story. Fine, I'll go to Gloom Hollow.}}

;On approach to [[Yash]]
:{{text|say|Yash|Can't believe those monsters gutted Torga...}}

Speak with Yash:
{{Dialogue|
Don't think a lot of tortollans want to hear the details of a dead and gutted loa... what am I going to tell the others now when I get back?

{{Gossip|(Tell Yash if he wants to live a crazy story that he should go to Gloom Hollow to help stop the blood trolls and their god.)}}
}}
:''They proceed to stand up and start heading to Gloom Hollow.''
:{{text|say|Yash|Fine, I'll go to Gloom Hollow and see how crazy this'll get.}}

;Arriving at Gloom Hollow
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|...and dat is de fate of Torga. What news from de Horde's reinforcements?}}
:{{text|say|Rokhan|We still be waitin' on dem, Princess. But we did get a lead about da loa, Krag'wa.}}
