==Objectives==
Blow up 5 Dreadtick Leechers with [[Lashk]]'s Scroll of Combustion.
* [[Dreadtick Leecher (mob)|Dreadtick Leechers]] blown up (5)
* [[Scroll of Combustion]] (provided)

==Description==
This whole thing is crazy, you know that? I don't think any story can top this one...

Bah! Do you hear that insufferable sound?

It's those stupid [[Blood tick|dreadticks]] sucking on [[Torga]]'s meat. Makes my skin crawl! 

What? You can't hear it? Meh, trust me, they're around, and they need to be taken care of.

Here, take this scroll. We've had to deal with these dumb insects in the past. Read it near them and it'll cause them to explode.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Talanji's Expedition]]
* +250 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Blow those dreadticks up! Less of them overall is good for existence.

==Completion==
I can rest a little easier knowing there are fewer of those... things in the world.

==Progression==
