==Objectives==
Take [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]]'s [[Flying machine|Flying Machine]] to [[Uldir]].

If you get lost, use the teleporter pad outside the entrance to Uldir.
* [[Brann's Flying Machine]] boarded

==Description==
It's kind o' [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]] tae offer, but his flying machine would drop like a rock with me aboard. Best if it carry just the two of ye.

Brann will fly ye down to Uldir. I'll find me own way and meet ye inside.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* +75 reputation with [[Champions of Azeroth]]

==Completion==
Ah good, I see ye've arrived in one piece. Now let's see if [[MOTHER]] can lend us a hand.

==Notes==
Brann will jump aboard his flying machine, waiting for you to follow his example. Meanwhile, the brothers exchange a few words before parting ways:

:{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I'll meet ye inside Uldir. Brann, fly safe!}}
:{{Alliance}} {{Text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Now where'd be the fun in that? Hop aboard, champion!}}
:{{Horde}} {{Text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Been a while since I've teamed up with someone from the [[Horde]]. But if we want tae save [[Azeroth (titan)|Azeroth]], we have tae work together.}}

During the ride:

:{{Text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|When we were lads, I used tae joke about Magni shoulderin' the weight o' the world. Dinnae know he'd take it literally.}}
:{{Text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|That's just the way he's always been. As a brother, as King of [[Ironforge]], and now as Speaker of Azeroth.}}
:{{Text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|No matter how heavy the burden, Magni takes it all on himself. He's as stubborn as he is brave, and it's cost him dearly.}}
:{{Text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|[[The Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm|When he turned into diamond]], we all thought he was lost forever. That he sacrificed himself tae save us.}}
:{{Text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|But that was just the beginning. Now he can hear everything Azeroth says, and feel all the pain she endures.}}
:{{Text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|He'll do whatever it takes tae heal [[Azeroth|our world]]. But this time, there's no way I'm lettin' him shoulder that burden alone.}}
:{{Text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Now hold on! We're goin' in!}}
