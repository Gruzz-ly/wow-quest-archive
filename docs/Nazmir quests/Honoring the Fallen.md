==Objectives==
Recover 7 Dog Tags from [[Fort Victory]] [[soldier]]s.
*[[Fort Victory Footman|Dog Tag]] recovered (7)

==Description==
This is a shameful situation. Unforgivable! The soldiers weren't carryin' offerrin's to the [[blood troll]]s, they WERE the offerin'!

It'd be right difficult to bury 'em proper in this hole. Best we can do is get their dog tags.

Poor lads an' lassies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This isney right!

==Completion==
I'll keep these tags an' get 'em to their families. Let's keep mum on the manner o' their deaths, aye? No need to cause 'em even more sadness.

==Progression==
