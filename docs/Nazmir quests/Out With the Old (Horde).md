==Objectives==
Cut 4 Natant Rubellites and replace the old ones with the new.
* [[Natant Rubellite]] (4)

==Description==
<It's clear though that time has had its way with these gems, some eroded and chipped in places.

Repairing this shrine may be as simple as replacing the old gems with newer ones of the same type and cut.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Interesting that the cut should be so similar, you wonder how the design has persisted all these years.>

==Completion==
<Replacing each gem, they fit perfectly into the slots confirming your suspicions of their similarities.

As you place the final gem, a peaceful glow now emanating from the shrine leads you to believe it is once again active.>

==Notes==
If you did not make sure to have four [[Rubellite]] available prior to this quest, you will need to obtain some at this point.

==Progression==
{{A Rocky Start (Horde)}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.0.1|note=Objective changed from [[Insightful Rubellite]].}}
