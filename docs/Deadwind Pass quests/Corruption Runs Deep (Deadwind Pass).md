==Objectives==
Recover an Essence of Corrupted Soil and an Essence of Corrupted Water from the caverns beneath Deadwind Pass.
*Corrupted Essence of Soil
*Corrupted Essence of Water
*[[Arcane-Infused Vial]] (provided)

==Description==
Everything the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] touches is marred by fingerprints of their corruption. If I can study the traces of magic they leave behind, perhaps I can discern their plans for [[Karazhan]].

This vial is specially reinforced to contain [[fel]] magic. If you bring me the essences of corrupted soil and water from near their portals, I believe we'll be closer to unraveling their scheme.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Unearthed Staff Headpiece]]

==Progress==
What have we here?

==Completion==
Every bit contains an essence of sorts - one we can study to learn things about the magic wielder and ways to manipulate their magic for... other purposes.

==Notes==
Both essences are located in separate underground caverns. The entrance for the corrupted soil can be found at {{co|48.67|78.85|Deadwind Pass}}, while entrance for the corrupted water is at {{co|47.75|78.29|Deadwind Pass}}.
