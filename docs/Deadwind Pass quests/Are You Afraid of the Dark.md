==Objectives==
Listen to Harrison Jones while he tells you what happened in [[Karazhan Crypts]].
*Listen to [[Harrison Jones|Harrison]]'s story

==Description==
Really can't thank you enough for the help back there. You really saved my bacon.

I've been chatting with this nice young woman while waiting for you and I think she might have some ideas to help you get into that forsaken crypt, if you really do insist on pushing your luck.

I'm getting ahead of myself. though. I believe I owe you some information.

==Completion==
So it appears that Jones' group successfully entered the crypt and happened upon a substantial cache of riches. The darkness both you and he described certainly seems magical in nature. Clearly their clumsy looting seemed to have triggered a reaction from something malign.

I've consulted my spell tomes and I think I might have a potential solution to get you through that darkness, should you still feel brave enough to proceed. Come, let's speak further on the matter.

==Notes==
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|A Few weeks back, I caught wind of a rumor that some [[mage]] was in search of something in the crypts beneath [[Karazhan]]. It's not uncommon for a mage to collect magical artifacts, but I heard rumors that this person wasn't just after any old ordinary enchanted trinket...}}
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|The rumors said he was looking to reassemble the legendary [[Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian]]. Thought shattered when [[Dalaran]] was destroyed, there are those who would see it reformed... for good or for ill.}}
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|I knew right then I had to get there before an army of hard-headed [[adventurer]]s descended upon the place and one of them traded any of the fragments of the staff for a dented helmet and a handful of silver. That kind of artifact belongs in a museum!}}
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|I needed a crew though, and I had recently been acquainted with one such group in a recent expedition to [[Tanaris]]. They were a real ruthless, hardboiled bunch. Certainly not to be trusted, but my options were limited, so I recruited them.}}
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|We made our way to Deadwind and entered the crypt. It was easy going at first and we made it into the main burial chamber without incident. To say we hit the motherlode would be an understatement.}}
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|The place was thick with treasure of unimaginable value. No sign of the staff, but there was enough to keep [[scholar]]s busy for years. However, I've been doing this long enough to know that a hoard like this doesn't just lie there undisturbed like this for long.}}
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|I tried to warn the crew not to touch anything, but they already had gold in their eyes and their leader responded by putting a knife to my throat. It was always the plan for them to double-cross me and steal the loot, of course. I should have known!}}
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|He was about to cut me open when one of the greedy fools made the unfortunate mistake of stuffing a handful of gold into his pocket... that was all it took. In that instant the whole tomb "woke up".}}
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|I used the confusion to break away and make a run for it. As I ran, a terrible, oppressive darkness seemed to follow right on my heels. I've never seen anything like it in my entire career. It was truly terrifying.}}
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|I heard screams, but I didn't look back. Let me tell you, kid, I won't forget those screams any time soon.}}
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|Somehow I made it out, but in my haste to get as far from the crypt as possible, I ended up right in the middle of a camp full of angry [[ogre]]s. I think you can fill in the rest of the story from there.}}
:{{text|say|Harrison Jones|So that's my story. I'm in no shape to head back there any time soon, but if you plan on going in you'll need a way around that darkness... and backup. Preferably a crew that won't stab you in the back for a bit of gold. Hah!}}
