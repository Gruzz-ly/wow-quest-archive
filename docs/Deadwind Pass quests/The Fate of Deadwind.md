==Objectives==
Attune [[:Ariden's Compass]] at the sites of restless spirits around [[Deadwind Pass]].
* Attuned at [[Deadman's Crossing]] {{co|35.44|35.49|Deadwind Pass}}
* Attuned at the church {{co|40.9|78.7|Deadwind Pass}}
* Attuned at the bridge {{co|46.98|62.36|Deadwind Pass}}

==Description==
The journal mentions a "stronger pull" for the compass. If the spirits of this place are indeed tied to it, they may serve as the pull we need.

I've come upon several locations in the pass where restless spirits tend to appear. Perhaps if you show the spirits there the compass, they may be able to help point it in the right direction.

You seek these locations out. I'll continue on to [[Karazhan]] and see if I can find anything leading to the [[Dark Riders]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
* 15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Completion==
It looks like it worked, and the compass is pointing toward the river.

Could it be..?

==Notes==
The player has the Spiritual Pull debuff. When in the correct place, the Attune the Compass extra button appears. Attuning at Deadman's Crossing brings up a vision of the past, where [[Sataiel]] and a group of humans appear, cowering in fear:
:{{text|say|Sataiel|Such poor souls. You don't even belong here, but you will be forever bound to this place.}}
:''Sataiel uses Ulthalesh to force them up in the air, strangling them.''
:{{text|say|Sataiel|Do not fret. Through [[Ulthalesh]], you will be so much more in death than you were in life.}}

Attuning at the church brings up a vision of the past, where Sataiel enters a church with humans inside it:
:{{text|say|Sataiel|How quaint. Do you really think your Holy [[Light]] can protect you from the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s onslaught?}}
:''Sataiel kills them all with a swing of Ulthalesh.''
:{{text|say|Sataiel|Where is your Light to protect you now?}}

Attuning at the bridge brings up a vision of the past, where Sataiel and a group of humans appear, bound and on their knees:
:{{text|say|Sataiel|You were fools to think such a pitiful force could oppose an agent of [[Sargeras]]!}}
:''Sataiel pushes them off the bridge, down into the water.''
:{{text|say|Sataiel|Your worthless lives will pave the way for the Legion!}}
