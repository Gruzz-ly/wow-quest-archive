==Objectives==
Speak with [[Archmage Khadgar]] in [[Deadwind Pass]].

==Description==
While you were... working your magic on that demon, I was able to make headway in distilling the corrupted essences down to a simpler, more manageable form.

I've asked Khadgar to provide you with the concoction once he's had a look, but I must remind you - these essences are quite potent, often dangerous if not handled with the utmost of care.

Speak with Khadgar when you are ready to begin.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|94|}}

==Completion==
The samples have proven to be quite useful along with your... influence.

==Gains==
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Progression==
{{Edict of the God-King}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 7.1.0|note=Added.}}
