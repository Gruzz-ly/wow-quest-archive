==Objectives==
Escort [[Revil Kost]] from [[Manor Mistmantle]] in [[Duskwood]] to [[Ariden's Camp]] in [[Deadwind Pass]].
* Follow Revil to Ariden's Camp

==Description==
Very well. I suppose an introduction is in order. I am Revil Kost, priest of the Light and a seeker of lost artifacts. I've dealt with the [[Dark Riders]] before, and have returned to rid this place of them.

The Riders are elusive, but I may have a clue to their whereabouts. In our previous confrontation, I was able to see a glimpse into their past. Granted blessed vision by the [[Cloak of Purity]], I saw the Dark Riders for who they were before.

Come with me to [[Ariden]]'s camp. I will explain on the way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
* 15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Completion==
It's strange that the Dark Riders haven't followed us here, but I will take whatever boon I can get.

I believe the key to finding the Dark Riders is here somewhere. Let us begin our search.

==Notes==
;Quest accept
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|It seems you've been followed, warlock! Dark Riders!}}
:{{text|yell|[[Dark Rider (mob)|Dark Rider]]|None will be spared!}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|The battle is won, but there will be more. Quickly, to Ariden's camp!}}

Revil mounts his horse. In case you wander, he says:
*{{Text|yell|Revil Kost|Try to keep up, warlock!}}
*{{Text|yell|Revil Kost|Quickly! We don't have time to linger!}}
*{{Text|yell|Revil Kost|Do you wish to be left behind? Hurry!}}

:{{text|say|Revil Kost|The Dark Riders were not always like this. They were once a group of traveling [[merchant]]s.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Unfortunately they crossed the sorcerer [[Medivh]], who cursed them to an eternity of hunting artifacts for him.}}
:{{text|yell|Revil Kost|Look out behind you!}}
:{{text|yell|Dark Rider|We will take what is ours!}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Your skill in combat is impressive. We may yet survive this.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Ariden was the first of the Dark Riders, and I believe he leads them now.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|His camp is still in Deadwind Pass, strangely untouched after all these years.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|If my convictions are correct, the key to finding the Dark Riders, as well as the artifacts they still covet, can be found there.}}
:{{text|yell|Revil Kost|Riders on our flank! Be ready!}}
:{{text|yell|Dark Rider|The artifact calls to us!}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Let us press on. We are nearly there.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Here! The camp is in this clearing. Let us search it.}}
