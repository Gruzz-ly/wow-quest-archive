==Objectives==
Use your Diplomat Ring on the shards.
*[[Shards of Light]]

==Description==
The shards are gathered, <name>. All that remains is your ring.

==Completion==
Although this being of [[Light]] did not speak, I felt its gratitude. Whatever it was, we have saved it.

The rifts between [[Alliance]] and [[Horde]] are deep, and many injustices have been wrought on both sides. But you have proven today that our greatest triumphs are earned together.

You have done enough, <name>. The next steps towards peace fall on myself and the other leaders that have gathered today.

==Notes==
After this quest has been completed at least once, all priests on the server can interact with the [[Divine Apprehension|beam of light]] left behind in the chapel and learn one priest racial ability from a different race. This choice can be freely changed at any time.

==Patch changes==
