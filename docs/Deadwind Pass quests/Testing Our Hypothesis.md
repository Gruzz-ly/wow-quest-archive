==Objectives==
Travel to the entrance to the [[Karazhan Crypts]], use the Enchanted Firebrand torch, and see what happens. Return to [[Agent Keanna]] after you've completed the test.
*Test the Magical Torch
*[[Enchanted Firebrand]] (provided)

==Description==
I think it wise that we put this device to the test before you commit fully to your delve down into the darkness of the Crypts. Take the torch to the edge of the magical darkness and activate it. See if it serves its purpose and provides illumination, and more importantly, discern how it behaves when exposed to this magic.

This totem was bound with a specific purpose and should be compelled to adhere to that purpose, but there's no real telling until we get there and test this hypothesis.

==Progress==
What did our test reveal?

==Completion==
This is good news. Not only did the torch successfully dispel the lesser darkness outside the crypt, but the binding compelled it to rush unbidden into the crypt to continue to fulfill its purpose.

Now that the malign darkness outside of the crypt is gone, I suspect you should be able to enter safely. Judging by this man's tale there's no telling what you'll find inside, so do be careful.

Good luck.

==Notes==
Upon using the torch, the shadowy haze will dissipate with the following message:
:{{text|bossemote|The firebrand darts around the graveyard, seeming agitated!}}

==Progression==
{{For Gold and Glory!}}
