==Objectives==
The gloom seeping from the entrance of [[Karazhan Crypts|the crypt]] seems to defy all normal logic and reason. No light enters or deters the darkness, and no light inside seems to escape it. You strongly suspect that venturing into the crypt as you are now could be the end of you. You'll need to somehow find a way to get past this darkness if you wish to proceed. You seem to recall that there is an Agent of [[Dalaran]] at a camp to the north. Perhaps she knows more about the dead adventurer and this strange darkness?

==Description==
A sudden and oppressive darkness begins to fall over you as you kneel down. You notice that all nearby light seems to darken and fade as the darkness seems to reach out to you. These are no natural shadows.

A quick glance over to the entrance to the crypt nearby tells you without doubt that this malign darkness is coming from the crypt itself, with inky black tendrils seeking more light to snuff out. You shudder as hairs on the back of your neck stand up.

==Completion==
<[[Agent Keanna]] looks up at you and frowns slightly.>

Look, I told the last group to come through here asking about the crypts that I don't have any information about the bounty [[Kirin Tor|my order]] placed upon whatever cursed treasure lies beneath that [[Karazhan|old tower]]. My area of expertise lies elsewhere and I'm not authorized to make any large expenditures on behalf of the order.

If there's nothing else, I'd like to return to my research.
