==Objectives==
Interrogate the Captured Wyrmtongue in the structure just north of the tower in [[Deadwind Pass]].
*[[Captured Wyrmtongue]] interrogated

==Description==
While I examine these samples further, I ask that you seek out one of our patrols in the structure to the north. It appears they've captured one of the [[demon]]s.

Go, interrogate it. Find out anything you can. And hurry! I'm afraid time is no longer an ally.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Has it been handled, <name>?

==Completion==
This information is just what we needed.
