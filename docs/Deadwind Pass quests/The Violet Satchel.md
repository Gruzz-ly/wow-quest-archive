==Objectives==
Find [[Archmage Tarsis Kir-Moldir]] and return the The{{sic}} Violet Satchel to him.
*[[Violet Satchel]] (provided)

==Description==
You've found a small violet satchel that appears to bear the mark of the [[Kirin Tor]]. Despite your best efforts, you can't seem to find a way to lift the flap and see what is inside, however. The note on the body of the [[adventurer]] where you found this suggests that it might be the property of Archmage Kir-Moldir of [[Dalaran]]. It might be worth your while to seek out the Archmage and return his property... and claim the promised reward.

==Progress==
The Archmage seems not to hear you...

==Completion==
What is that you have there? Is it... could it be?

<The Archmage quickly snatches the satchel from you. He whispers an incantation and empties the contents into his hands, revealing two small red gemstones.>

The eyes! Yes, the eyes! I have them! Thank you. Please, leave me now... Go! Go before I am forced to destroy you!

<The hard look in his eyes tells you that he is quite serious. As you begin to back away the Archmage turns away, hunching over and clutching the gemstones tightly to his chest.>

==Notes==
*The Archmage will not respond until he has been healed.
*This quest is simply a pointer to the questline for obtaining [[Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian (Season of Discovery)]] and has no other rewards.
