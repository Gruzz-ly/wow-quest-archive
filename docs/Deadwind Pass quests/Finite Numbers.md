==Objectives==
Close 20 Portals and slay 4 [[Demon]]s in [[Deadwind Pass]].
*Legion Portals disabled (4)
*Legion Forces slain (20)

==Description==
It seems not all the protections I put in place have been defeated. The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] isn't able to open portals inside or near the tower... at least, not yet.

They appear to be bringing reinforcements in through the [[Karazhan Catacombs|catacombs]] running beneath [[Deadwind Pass]]. Disable them and you just might buy us the time we need to drive them out of [[Karazhan]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you cut off their access points?

==Completion==
Well done! At least now most of the remaining [[demon]]s we have to deal with are currently inside the tower.

Couldn't be more than a thousand or two, I'm sure.
