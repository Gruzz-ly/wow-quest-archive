==Objectives==
Use the disguise to gain access to the chamber, then slay Thar'zul and Elux'ara Darkscorn beneath Karazhan in Deadwind Pass.
*Chamber access obtained
*[[Thar'zul]] slain
*[[Elux'ara Darkscorn]] slain
*[[Essence of Wyrmtongue]] (provided)

==Description==
The time has come at last.

Deep within the cavernous underbelly of [[Karazhan]] lies a long-forgotten chamber. Based on what you learned from our demon friend, I believe this is where its mistress dwells.

This demon's master must come from the highest ranks of the [[Burning Legion]]. This does not bode well for Karazhan.

We need to secure [[Deadwind Pass]], <name>.

You must find this demon and destroy it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The threat must be removed.

==Completion==
Our worst fears have been proven true, <name>. The Legion's presence is deeply rooted in the tower. We must take back Karazhan!
