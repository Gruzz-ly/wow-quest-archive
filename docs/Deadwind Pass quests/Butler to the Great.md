:{{Text|say|[[Lord Crispin Ference]]|Ah yes, this is a wonderful vintage.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Baroness Dorothea Millstipe]]|Wonderful, my favorite cheese.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Baron Rafe Dreuger]]|Nothing quite like the perfect rack of ribs.}}
:{{Text|say|Moroes|You rang?}}

;Speaking with Moroes
:You do not look like my master...

:{{Gossip|No, I defeated him. You are free.}}
::What do you mean, free?

::{{Gossip|I have slain your master, you no longer need to serve him.}}
:::He still controls my body though, I can feel it.

:::{{Gossip|Yes, but your spirit is free to do what you will. You no longer need to serve him.}}
::::I have served for so long, I cannot recall a time when I was of my own will. Do you need a servant?

::::{{Gossip|Not a servant, but you are welcome to join me and help me fight.}}
:::::Then I choose to join you.
