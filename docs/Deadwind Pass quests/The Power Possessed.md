==Objectives==
Return to [[Calydus]] in [[Underbelly|The Underbelly]] in [[Dalaran]].

==Description==
I was wrong about you, warlock. Your assistance against the [[Dark Riders]] has proven a great service to the [[Light]]. Perhaps I should not be so quick to judge.

Nevertheless, you have allowed me to fill my purpose in returning these artifacts to their rightful owners. As for [[Ulthalesh]], I can think of no safer place than in your care.

May it serve you well against the [[Burning Legion|Legion]], warlock.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}}
* 1,500 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Completion==
Friend has the weapon?

Yes, Calydus can feel its power!

==Notes==
If you have progressed further in the campaign questline, you won't receive this quest since it is a breadcrumb.

==Progression==
{{Warlock artifact and class hall}}
