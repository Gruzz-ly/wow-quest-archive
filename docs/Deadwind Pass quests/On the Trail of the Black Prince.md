==Objectives==
Enter the Karazhan Catacombs and search for a cure for Ebonhorn.
* Enter [[Karazhan Catacombs]]
* [[Bolt of Embroidered Cloth]] investigated
* "[[The Ways of the Old Gods|Ways of the Old Gods]]" investigated
* [[Wrathion's Journal Page]] investigated ([[Torn Journal Page 58]])
* [[X'korr the Compelling]] slain

==Description==
<It looks like a fight took place here. [[N'Zoth]]'s [[agent]]s must have already entered the catacombs beneath [[Karazhan]].

The [[Slain Blacktalon Lookout|dead lookout]] still has a set of keys on him. Perhaps they will unlock the door.

With any luck, you can find [[Wrathion]] before N'Zoth's agents and gain something that can help [[Ebonhorn]].>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,800 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Champions of Azeroth]]

==Progress==
<The note appears to have been left behind in a hurry, and deliberately placed where you would find it.>

==Completion==
The note reads:

"<Name>. If you are reading this note, then I assume that Ebyssian has fallen prey to the whispers of the Old Gods. Fortunately, I have prepared a method to save him.

You will find a potion with the properties you seek sitting next to this note. Bring it to my brother and it will clear his mind of N'Zoth's influence.

I will thank you for your efforts in person, soon enough."

==Notes==
Open the Catacombs Entrance doors to enter a scenario.

Jump down into the water or run down the stairs to get to the bottom, then start killing a path forward. All of the objects are marked on the minimap. There's also a [[Burnt Journal Page]] inside the "Ways of the Old Gods" room.

In the second-to last room, inspecting Wrathion's Journal Page on the table turns up [[Torn Journal Page 58]]. Read it before defeating [[X'korr the Compelling]]. There is also a [[Burnt Journal Page]] here.

On aggro:
:{{text|say|X'korr the Compelling|The Black Prince may have eluded us... but you will not!}}

Turn in to the [[Hastily-Scrawled Note]] on a table behind X'korr, next to the [[Potion of Mental Clarity]], which starts the [[Save Ebonhorn|next quest]].

==Progression==
{{Wrathion and Ebonhorn}}
