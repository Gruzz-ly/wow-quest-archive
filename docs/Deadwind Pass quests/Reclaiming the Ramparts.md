==Objectives==
Plant the Wards at the Eastern, Southern and Northern locations around the tower in Deadwind Pass.
*Northern Ward planted
*Southern Ward planted
*Eastern Ward planted
*[[Empowered Arcane Ward]] (provided)

==Description==
With the [[ley line]]s protected we must move to secure the [[Karazhan|tower]]'s perimeter.

Around the tower are several locations where corruption continues to run rampant. Seek out these locations and secure them with these wards.

With the progress we've made so far, bolstering our defenses should keep the remaining [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s forces at bay just long enough for us to discover who's behind their efforts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Overcharged Ward Focus]]

==Progress==
Has the tower been secured?

==Completion==
You've bought us precious time.

==Progression==
{{Edict of the God-King}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.1.0|note=Added.}}
