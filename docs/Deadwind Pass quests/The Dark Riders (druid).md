==Objectives==
Defeat the [[Dark Riders]] in the [[Karazhan Catacombs]] and claim the [[Scythe of Elune]].
* Defeat the Dark Riders
* The Scythe of Elune claimed

==Description==
This sewer grate leads to the catacombs underneath [[Karazhan]]. I've never paid it much attention, but it seems to be where the [[Nightbane pack|Nightbane]] are being drawn to.

To think, the Dark Riders may have been under our noses this entire time! Come, let us see where this leads.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It is done.

==Completion==
Today was a great blow against the Dark Riders, and a victory for the people of [[Duskwood]]. 

They are in your debt, as am I.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Go in ahead, druid. I will join you inside.}}

Upon entering the catacombs, you are placed in a single-player scenario.

===Stage 1: The Downward Spiral===
:Make your way into the Dark Riders' catacombs beneath Karazhan.
* Karazhan Catacombs infiltrated

:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Take care! There is a dark energy emanating from the spirits of this place. We had best not get too close.}}

The skeletal [[Cursed Guardian]]s will awaken from their resting places along the walls as you descend and attack you. About halfway down, Revil will say:
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|How far down is this place? These stairs seem to go forever.}}

Avoid the [[Imprisoned Phantasm]]s and reach the bottom of the stairs. Two [[Dark Rider (mob)|Dark Riders]] are guarding the entrance to the tunnel. Upon proceeding further inward, it becomes apparent that the way has been blocked by a field of "Grasping Spirits" summoned by Ariden, who is sitting on his steed on the other side.

===Stage 2: Grasp of the Damned===
:Find a way to cross Ariden's spirit barrier.
* Spirit Barrier crossed

:{{text|say|Revil Kost|The way is blocked!}}
:{{text|yell|Ariden|Intruders! You will go no further!}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Hold, druid! Those spirits he's controlling look like they'll rip us apart!}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|We have to figure out a way to get past without being torn asunder.}}

Use [[Solar Beam]] to interrupt Ariden's channeled spell.

:{{text|yell|Ariden|Do not think you have won! Conservator, do your duty!}}

===Stage 3: Removal Protocols===
:Defeat the guardian of the Dark Riders' vault.
* [[The Conservator|Conservator]] Defeated

[[The Conservator]], a damaged [[arcane golem]], emerges from a room to the west.

:{{text|yell|The Conservator|Your presence is unauthorized. Removal protocols engaged.}}

===Stage 4: Elune's Prize===
:Find the Scythe of Elune among the Dark Riders' artifacts.
* Scythe of Elune found

:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Keep your guard up! I fear Ariden is not done with us yet.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|The artifact chambers look to be just ahead. Let us proceed.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Over here! Is this the relic you seek?}}

The Scythe is resting, seemingly unguarded, in the room just ahead. Upon attempting to loot it, Ariden appears and knocks the player back.
:{{text|yell|Ariden|So this is what you're after? The artifacts of Karazhan belong here, and I will not allow them to be taken away!}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|You have no right to these artifacts, fiend! They must be reclaimed in the name of the [[Light]]!}}
:''Ariden uses his magic to lift Revil off the ground and choke him.''
:{{text|yell|Ariden|Your Light does not reach here, priest!}}
:''Ariden equips the Scythe of Elune.''
:{{text|yell|Ariden|If you want the Scythe, druid, come and claim it!}}
:''Ariden rides past the player deeper into the northern part of the catacombs.''
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Quickly, after him! I will only slow you down...}}

===Stage 5: The Rider's Prize===
:Follow Ariden into the depths of the Karazhan catacombs.
* Ariden followed

Head to the northernmost part of the catacombs and defeat any Dark Riders and Cursed Guardians you encounter along the way.

===Stage 6: Reaping the Riders===
:Defeat Ariden.
* Ariden defeated

Upon approaching Ariden in the final chamber:
:{{text|say|Ariden|You are a persistent one.}}
:{{text|yell|Ariden|Very well! If you so thirst for the power of the Scythe, then I will show it to you myself!}}

During the fight, Ariden occasionally transforms into a [[worgen]].
:{{text|bossemote|The Scythe has overpowered Ariden! Keep him away from you to avoid {{abilities|bracketlink=|Bloodreap|id=204659|icon=ability_ironmaidens_bloodritual}}!}}

Upon killing Ariden:
:{{text|yell|Ariden|I will ride... again...}}

===Final Stage: The Scythe Reclaimed===
:Claim the Scythe of Elune.
*[[Scythe of Elune]]

The Scythe is stuck on the floor next to Ariden's corpse. Upon looting it, Revil runs into the chamber.

:{{text|say|Revil Kost|It is done. The Dark Riders are defeated.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Now I can reclaim these stolen artifacts and return them to their rightful owners.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|You have proven an unexpected ally, druid. The weapon is yours. Let us hope it can turn the tide in this war.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|The Dark Riders lost this battle, but I fear they will soon regroup. We had best be gone before they do.}}
