==Objectives==
Secure the Eastern Ley Line and Western Ley Line beneath Karazhan.
*Eastern Ley Line secured
*Western Ley Line secured

==Description==
[[Karazhan]] sits upon a confluence of [[ley line]]s. It's why this location was chosen for the tower in the first place... a fact that has not escaped the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s notice.

If the demons are tapping into these lines of power, they must need their energy for something particularly menacing. You must cut off their access to the ley lines if we're to have a chance of retaking the tower, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Ley to Fel Power Converter]]

==Progress==
Has the area been secured?

==Completion==
The Legion's hold wanes. Our time to strike grows nearer.
