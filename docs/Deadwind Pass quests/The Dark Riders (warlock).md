==Objectives==
Defeat the [[Dark Riders]] in the Karazhan Catacombs and claim Ulthalesh.
* Complete the Dark Riders scenario
* Ulthalesh claimed

==Description==
There's a sewer grate along the edge of the river leading to catacombs underneath Karazhan. I've never paid it much attention, but it could be where the spirits are directing us. To think, the Dark Riders may have been under our noses this entire time! Come, let us see where this leads.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|15|40}}
|Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester
}}
* 15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Progress==
Did you find what you seek, warlock?

==Completion==
Today was a great blow against the Dark Riders, and a victory for the people of Duskwood.

They are in your debt, as am I.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|The sewer entrance is this way. Follow me!}}
Head down to the [[Karazhan Catacombs]]{{co|4.6.81|6.9|Deadwind Pass}} to continue.

===Stage 1: The Downward Spiral===
*Make your way into the Dark Riders' catacombs beneath Karazhan.
* Karazhan Catacombs infiltrated

:{{Text|say|Revil Kost|Take care! There is a dark energy emanating from the spirits of this place. We had best not get too close.}}

[[Cursed Guardian]]s and [[Imprisoned Phantasm]]s can be seen. Either climb down the stairs to the bottom, of (if you're feeling lucky) jump down into the water. Fight the two Dark Riders.
:{{Text|say|Revil Kost|How far down is this place? These stairs seem to go forever.}}
:{{text|say|[[Dark Rider (mob)|Dark Rider]]|The artifact belongs to Karazhan, warlock!}}

===Stage 2: Grasp of the Damned===
*Find a way to cross [[Ariden]]'s spirit barrier.
* Spirit Barrier crossed

:{{text|say|Revil Kost|The way is blocked!}}
:{{text|yell|Ariden|Intruders! You will go no further!}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Hold, warlock! Those spirits he's controlling look like they'll rip us apart!}}
:{{Text|emote|Use [Demonic Gateway] to get past Ariden's barrier!}} {{Sl-inline}}

:{{text|say|Revil Kost|We have to figure out a way to get past without being torn asunder.}}
Summon a [[Felhunter (warlock minion)|Felhunter]] and use [[Spell Lock]] on Ariden to bring down the barrier.
:{{text|yell|Ariden|Wretched demon!}}
:{{text|yell|Ariden|Do not think you have won! [[The Conservator|Conservator]], do your duty!}}

===Stage 3: Removal Protocols===
*Defeat the guardian of the Dark Riders' vault.
* [[The Conservator|Conservator]] Defeated

:{{text|yell|The Conservator|Your presence is unauthorized. Removal protocols engaged.}}

===Stage 4: Reap the Harvester===
*Find the Deadwind Harvester among the Dark Riders' artifacts.
* Ulthalesh found

:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Keep your guard up! I fear Ariden is not done with us yet.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|The artifact chambers look to be just ahead. Let us proceed.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Over here! Is this the relic you seek?}}

Attempting to retrieve Ulthalesh summons Ariden, knocking back the player and preventing them from taking Ulthalesh.
:{{text|yell|Ariden|So this is what you're after? The artifacts of Karazhan belong here, and I will not allow them to be taken away!}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|You have no right to these artifacts, fiend! They must be reclaimed in the name of the Light!}}
:{{text|yell|Ariden|Your Light does not reach here, priest!}}
''Ariden cast a spell on Revil, lifting him up in the air in a swirling mist.''
:{{text|yell|Ariden|If you want Ulthalesh, warlock, come and claim it!}}

===Stage 5: The Rider's Prize===
*Follow Ariden into the depths of the Karazhan catacombs.
* Ariden followed

:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Quickly, after him! I will only slow you down...}}

Go after Ariden, killing the [[Cursed Guardian]]s and [[Dark Rider (mob)|Dark Riders]] along the way.
:{{text|say|Dark Rider|We will take what is ours!}}
:{{text|say|Dark Rider|The artifact calls to us!}}

===Stage 6: Ulthalesh Feasts===
*Defeat Ariden.
* Ariden defeated

:{{text|say|Ariden|You are a persistent one.}}
:{{text|say|Ariden|Very well! If you so thirst for the power of the Deadwind Harvester, then I will show it to you myself!}}
:{{text|yell|Ariden|Ulthalesh feasts tonight!}}

Once defeated, Ulthalesh is thrown into the center of the area.
:{{text|yell|Ariden|No! I will not be taken!}}
''Ulthalesh grabs Ariden up in the air above it, draining his soul.''
:{{text|yell|Ariden|Nooooooo!}}

===Final Stage===
*Claim the Deadwind Harvester.
* Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester claimed

:{{text|say|Revil Kost|It is done. The Dark Riders are defeated.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Now I can reclaim these stolen artifacts and return them to their rightful owners.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|You have proven an unexpected ally, warlock. The weapon is yours. Let us hope it can turn the tide in this war.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|The Dark Riders lost this battle, but I fear they will soon regroup. We had best be gone before they do.}}
