==Objectives==
Search for any survivors of the unfortunate adventuring party and try to learn what you can about what happened in [[Karazhan Crypts|the crypt]].

==Description==
Oh, I see. Yes, the body you claim to have found does indeed seem to match my recollection of one of the [[adventurer]]s who passed through here recently. There were five of them, as I recall. I urged them against going any further, but they could not be dissuaded. It seems my warnings were well-founded as I've not seen any of their number pass by since. I feared the worst and, well...

You say she was the only body you found? If that's true, mayhap there are other survivors somewhere in the pass?

==Completion==
The man stirs slightly as you approach, opening a single eyelid almost imperceptibly to peer at you. Initially he seemed seriously injured, but now you aren't entirely sure...

==Progression==
