==Objectives==
Seek out Wrathion outside the Karazhan Catacombs.
* Seek out [[Wrathion]] outside [[Karazhan Catacombs]]
* [[Torn Journal Page 25]]

==Description==
I held out as long as I could, but... the whispers were too strong.

You must hurry to [[Karazhan]]. The Black Prince said he intended to study the artifacts stored within its catacombs.

Please, do not allow my failure to bring about his doom!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Champions of Azeroth]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Matrix]] (1,000x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
<It seems the lookout gave his life in service to the Black Prince.>

==Completion==
<The lookout put up a fierce fight before he died.

You have found more pages from Wrathion's journal on his body. Perhaps the Black Prince himself is not far.>

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Blacktalon Watcher|I failed... They know where to find him. Hurry!}}

Fly south to [[Deadwind Pass]]. Look below the back entrance to [[Karazhan]]. Bodies of [[Sleepless Operative]]s and a [[Slain Blacktalon Lookout]] can be found at the entrance. Interact with the lookout:
:<The body is still warm to the touch. He has not been dead for long.>
{{gossip|<Search the body for more journal pages.>}}

[[Torn Journal Page 25]] turns up. Read it, then interact with the body again to continue.

==Progression==
{{Wrathion and Ebonhorn}}
