==Objectives==
It appears as if someone was looking to hire [[adventurer]]s to recover something valuable from the [[Karazhan Crypts]] in {{C|Deadwind Pass}}. You can't be sure who posted this flyer or where to find them, but the idea of a considerable reward from a well-established and deep-pocketed [[organization]] such as the [[Kirin Tor]], as well as a cache of hidden treasure up for the taking is an admittedly interesting prospect. Travel to Deadwind Pass and investigate the Crypts behind [[Karazhan]] tower.

==Description==
Calling all adventurers and treasure hunters! Let it be known that the Kirin Tor has authorized the disbursement of considerable funds to any individuals who are able to descend into the crypts below Karazhan and recover a particular magical artifact. Any other treasure, curios, or coin recovered is of no consequence to the order, and may be retained as additional compensation. Interested parties should report to...

==Completion==
The [[human]] lying before you is indeed quite dead. She does not appear to have any obvious wounds or trauma. The only odd thing about the body is a look of intense terror on her face. It's almost as if this woman died of fright...

==Notes==
Upon turning in this quest, a shadowy purple haze will appear around the crypt.
