==Objectives==
Find and retrieve information on the ritual from [[Arrexis]]'s campsite near [[Karazhan]].
* Take the Portal to Karazhan (Optional)
* Fly to the [[Abandoned Kirin Tor Camp|abandoned Kirin Tor camp]] near Karazhan
* Find remaining ritual items
* Find any text on the ritual
* Listen to [[Merina]]
*[[Karazhan Scroll]] (provided)

==Description==
Your research spoke of an experimental site out near Karazhan. I hope there are still materials on this ritual that will aid us there.

You will need to find the site and bring back anything that will help us recreate the ritual. I will dig deeper here as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,050 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Progress==
I trust you were successful?

==Completion==
This is better than I hoped. A working ward prototype and the ritual notes as well!

I'm beginning to believe this is possible!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Meryl Felstorm|In the center of [[Dalaran]] is a portal that can you{{sic}} to Karazhan. Start you search in the mountains west of the tower. I seem to recall a mention of something up there.}}

When you arrive at Karazhan, fly directly northwest, where you will find the [[Abandoned Kirin Tor Camp]], which is filled with [[Arcane Hunter]]s and packs of [[Excited Mana Scavenger]]s. Head deeper into the camp until you see a circle of stones and loot the nearby [[Functional Ward]]. Next, head a bit further west and loot the [[Ritual Notes]], which will cause [[Merina]] to spawn a short distance away.
:{{text|say|Merina|Are you here to take me away? Or do you only seek that which was left behind?}}
:{{text|say|Merina|I was told to stand watch, but no one ever came back for me. I wasn't strong enough to defend the site... or perhaps I was simply here too long. I'm not sure anymore.}}
:''Merina walks a few feet towards the northern clearing.''
:{{text|say|Merina|If you want the ritual to work, you need the focus. I tried to keep it from the monsters, but I was too weak.}}
:''Merina points to the north.''
:{{text|say|Merina|It lies near my corpse. I... I think it's keeping me here. Please, take it far away. Perhaps then I will finally be able to go home.}}
:''Merina walks back to her original position.''

You are now able to talk to the ghost.
:I doubt you are here for me. Which means you are probably here for the research.
:''{{gossip|Who are you? Yes, I am looking to recreate Arrexis's ritual.}}''
Clicking on the dialogue option will simply cause Merina to repeat what she said earlier.

Head a short distance north where the [[Arcane Abomination]] is and loot the [[Ritual Focusing Crystal]], which is embedded in the ground right next to the skeleton of a female human, apparently Merina's body. Upon looting the crystal, the ghost vanishes.

If you haven't done so already, head south to the [[Tainted Scar]] in the [[Blasted Lands]] for [[Daio the Decrepit (quest)]]. Otherwise, use [[Teleport: Hall of the Guardian]] to return to Meryl.
