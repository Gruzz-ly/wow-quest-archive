==Objectives==
Consult the list of materials needed and bring [[Agent Keanna]] the components requested.
*[[Flame of Life]]
*[[Ancient Ironwood Branch]]
*[[Enthusiastic Wisp]]
*[[List of Components]] (provided)

==Description==
I think I can fashion a magical totem of sorts that should allow you to pierce this malign darkness and at least allow you to explore the crypts. I don't have all of the components with me, however. Some of this might not be easy to find, but judging by what I've seen from you so far, I trust that you are resourceful enough to secure what is needed.

==Progress==
Have you managed to recover the components I require?

==Completion==
Excellent. This binding is simple enough, let me just.... There! I think that should do it.

This magical torch should allow you to pierce the malign darkness enough to at least see and explore the Crypt. Be advised however, the wisp possessing this item has a will of its own. While I have bound it to this object and to this specific purpose, I cannot be entirely sure how it will...  behave when you reach the crypt.

Be on your guard when you arrive. We can't fully predict what will occur.
