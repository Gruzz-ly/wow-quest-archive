There's a court proceeding tomorrow to make a final determination, but luckily the deed is squarely in the hands of someone I trust.

Their name: [[Rosebud Gallywix]].

I know. I know. But Rosey is a good egg. I'll introduce you to him later on.

Upon accept:
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|I'll be over with Grimla when you're done chatting up the bigwigs.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Food and drinks are free, at least....}}

Speak to Baron Revilgaz:
{{Dialogue|This music is the top! You hear me? THE TOP!

{{Gossip|quest=|How do you feel about Rosebud Gallywix taking over the Gallagio?}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Baron Revilgaz|Dunno! Never met the guy before, and there's a swarm of people around him now.}}
:{{Text|Say|Baron Revilgaz|But the whole Gallywix thing... The kid should probably change his last name. Rebrand and whatever.}}

Upon speaking with Tarbonara Fizzlecrank:
{{Dialogue|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank. That's me.

<Name>. That's you.

Yes. I know many things. More than you imagine. Especially at this most precarious of Undermine's time.

{{Gossip|quest=|How do you feel about Rosebud Gallywix taking over the Gallagio?}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|Terrific goblin. Wonderful friend. Yes, certainly.}}
:{{Text|Say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|He should be protected from any potential danger. Don't want anything untoward to happen him...}}

Speak to Grimla Fizzlecrank:
{{Dialogue|Hey, <Name>. Good to see ya again.

Did you get a chance to meet my cousin, Tarbonara? Guy is like a can of used motor oil--I don't want it around.

I'm not much of a fan, as you can see...

{{Gossip|quest=|How do you feel about Rosebud Gallywix taking over the Gallagio?}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Rosey? I like him. He's good people. Good enough by Gallywix standards, anyway.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Plus it's hilarious to watch Gaz turn all mushy big brother-type whenever they spend time with each other.}}

Speak to Marin Noggenfogger:
{{Dialogue|Is it really necessary to throw a party outside the front doors instead of at the game tables themselves?

I don't think I've ever been this bored before...

{{Gossip|quest=|How do you feel about Rosebud Gallywix taking over the Gallagio?}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Marin Noggenfogger|Rosebud? The boy is a Gallywix in name alone.}}
:{{Text|Say|Marin Noggenfogger|He used to be an apprentice of Monte's, you know. I'd suspect this all a scheme if I trusted the Bilgewater Trade-Prince any less.}}

Some of Rosebud's companions have gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Jojo Gobdre|Hey. You try the food yet?

It's hilarious. I'm a triple gobstar-rated restauranteur on the streets of Undermine. Famed. Awarded. Written about in magazines.

But it's boring out there. Rosebud is giving me the chance I wanted, the chance to sweat it up in a kitchen again.

Apologies. Guess you came to shake hands, not listen to an inspiring monologue. 

I'm Jojo Gobdre, Chief Executive of Dining. And my cooking will knock your socks off.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Chancellor Gnome|Thanks for swinging by our little fest here.

I'm Chancellor Gnome, the front-goblin for the Cellar Gnomes. You've heard us, right? Probably on the radio while you were cruising the Undermine asphalt or something.

All good, babe. All good. We're the resident entertainment here, so you'll be hearing our cellar sounds a whole lot more once the joint is re-opened.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Kayjay|Yo! 

You good? Big fan of the wheels? Maybe the dice?

No sweat if not! If I'm honest, you just got a certain look. Like you love games with chance-based, randomly generated outcomes.

Either way, pleased to meet you. Name is Kayjay. I'll be the one making sure that, win or lose, you have fun here at the Gallagio.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Fantastic Davey|Hey, friendo!

You enjoying the party? Food is way better than the last time it re-opened!

I was just a waiter back then, stealing food off my own serving tray to save money for the games inside. But now look at me! I quit that job. Then the next one. Then the next ten!

All to end up back here. Back with the games...

That's what I do, by the way! Games! I invent them! Pretty crazy!

My mom always said I'd do great things like this. Probably why she named me Fantastic Davey.}}

Go to Monte Gazlowe:
{{Dialogue|Well? What do the others think about Rosey?

{{Gossip|quest=|<Report to Gazlowe.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|No opposition to Rosebud? Really? Is this the first time the cartels have agreed on something?!}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|That's great news. It means the ownership of the Gallagio will transfer with no problems at court tomorrow!}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Looks like the crowd has died down. Now's the perfect chance to introduce yourself to Rosebud and his chiefs.}}

Walk to Rosebud Gallywix and speak to him.
:''The adventurer waves at Rosebud.''
:{{Text|Say|Rosebud Gallywix|Hiya! I'm Rosebud. Gaz gave me the skinny on you.}}
:{{Text|Say|Rosebud Gallywix|Have you mey my chiefs? I wanna take good care of this place, and I can't do it without the support of a strong team.}}
:{{Text|Say|Rosebud Gallywix|[[Kayjay]] and [[Fantastic Davey|Davey]] are game creation geniuses. [[Chancellor Gnome]] is an entertainment prodigy. And [[Jojo Gobdre|Jojo]] was basically born with a frying pan in hand--}}
:''Suddenly, a [[Bombshell Crab|bombshell crab]] drops in.''
:{{Text|Say|Gallagio Caterer|AHHH!}}
:{{Text|Say|Rosebud Gallywix|--Hey there little guy. Where'd you come from?}}
:''The bombshell explodes killing Rosebud Gallywix. Monte, Grimla, Revilgaz, Marin, [[Sprinkle Noggenfogger]], and Tarbonara Fizzlecrank approches Rosebud's corpse.''
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Quick, <Name>! Use the Mega-Savor I brought in my toolbox!}}

Interact with the Toolbox and pick up the Mega-Savor 21 Thou-Plus-ing.
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|That's it! Use it keep our boy alive!}}

Use the tool on Rosebud.
:{{Text|Say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|Oh, Rosebud. What a horrible accident to befall such a rising star.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|This wasn't no "accident," Tarby!}}
:{{Text|Say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|Yes. A terrible, horrific, gory, and absolutely faultless accident.}}
:{{Text|Say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|Woe is you. Woe is you!}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Rosebud... Rosey... Please don't...}}
