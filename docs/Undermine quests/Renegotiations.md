==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Jarvis Bonebreaker.jpg|Jarvis Bonebreaker|Moz Barrelbottom's loyal bodyguard. Nobody sees the boss without going through him.}}
Defeat Jarvis Bonebreaker and collect the Barrelbottom Deed from Moz Barrelbottom in his third floor office across the street.
*[[Jarvis Bonebreaker]] slain {{co|40.2|72.4|Undermine}}
*[[Barrelbottom Deed]] collected

==Description==
That settles it! I think we both know who's responsible for this mess. It's that bastard landlord, [[Moz Barrelbottom]]!

Soon as the Underriders were dealt with, he sent his goon Jarvis on a rampage. Looks like if he can't scare us out, he's going to force us out!

<Keara spits on the ground in disgust.>

He won't scare us so easily.

You're pretty tough, <name>. Moz's office is just across the street. Go show him he's messin' with the wrong goblins!

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Maniac Biker's Boots]]
*[[Maniac Biker's Legguards]]
*[[Maniac Biker's Shoulderguards]]
*[[Maniac Biker's Wristguards]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
We'll be fine here. You just go deal with Moz!

==Completion==
Hah! That will show the old skinflint who's in charge. And with this deed, he can't threaten us with nothin'!

You did good. I think you've earned that free room alright.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Mama Keara|Stay under the bed until I say it's safe to come out, [["Gabby" Gabi|Gabi]]. <Name> will deal with this.}}

[["Gabby" Gabi]] is kneeling beneath the bed:
{{dialogue|<Gabi seems unharmed, but frozen in fear.>}}

Head south to the building across the slime stream and up to the top floor to fight Jarvis Bonebreaker:
:{{Text|Say|Moz Barrelbottom|You can't be in here! Jarvis, get them!}}
:{{Text|Yell|Jarvis Bonebreaker|Smashing!}}

After finishing off Jarvis, interact with Moz Barrelbottom and knock him out to obtain the Barrelbottom Deed. Return to Mama.
