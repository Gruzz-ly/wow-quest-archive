This weekly quest chooses which cartel to focus on for the week. Talk to [[Kaydee Racketring]] to sign a contract.

===Cartel descriptions===
;[[Bilgewater Cartel]]
From brilliant inventors to explosive geniuses, Bilgewater is home to some of the brightest goblins to ever live. They made a big splash joining the Horde, but in Undermine, they can use all the friends they can get.

;[[Steamwheedle Cartel]]
The oldest and largest cartel in Undermine, Steamwheedle has had their hands in almost every industry spanning Azeroth and beyond. But these days, under [[Noggenfogger]], it's all about premium-grade alchemy.

;[[Blackwater Cartel]]
The Blackwater pirates might be a newer cartel, but they're already making waves in the shipping and luxury vacation industries. They can move any cargo, anywhere, any time, and now it's all nice and legal. Well, mostly legal.

;[[Venture Co.]]
Some might take issue with the ways Venture Co. acquires its resources, but no industry can run without materials. You want nice, find a book club. You want to build something, Venture Co.'s got what you need.
