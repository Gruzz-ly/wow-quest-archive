==Objectives==
Meet [[Pamsy]] in [[Gutterville]].

==Description==
What're you doing here? Sabotagin'?

I can understand that. Things are way out of hand. But if we explode this pipe here, it'll get even worse. Black Blood everywhere. Maybe together we could come up with somethin' real to do.

Meet me in Gutterville. We'll talk more, away from these awful slimes!

You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
Keep yer voice down! I've never seen so many spies in Gutterville...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Pamsy|It's dangerous here, we can talk more in town.}}
Run to the east and head in to [[Gutterville]] where [[Pamsy]], [[Orweyna]], [[Zirdo]], [[Renzik "The Shiv"]] & [[Monte Gazlowe]] have gathered. Don't forget the flight path from [[Jix]] a few yards away!

[[Pamsy]] has gossip for goblin adventurers:
{{Dialogue|There's always a way to fix things.

{{Gossip|Why do you work for the Venture Company?}}

{{Dialogue-child|You work for Bilgewater, right? There was a time when they weren't so nice. Remember who your old boss was?}}
}}

Zirdo has gossip:

{{Dialogue|title=Zirdo|Ol' Zirdo's here to help.

You just let me know what ya need!

{{Gossip|What do you make of these spies?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Information's key around here. You're lucky I'm here to help, so you don't get lost or talk to the wrong guy.

Just be sure you only trust your friends, like ol' Zirdo!

{{Gossip|Thanks, Zirdo.}}}}
{{Gossip|Can you tell me more about the Darkfuse?}}
{{Dialogue-child|The Darkfuse Enforcement? Sure, pal!

Some Venture Company miners are lazy, so Gallywix hired the Darkfuse to empower everybody to work faster. "More enforcers is better," is Gallywix's motto. When they showed up here it worked great for Gallywix, getting lots of product. Now he's usin' them everywhere.

I hear the Darkfuse are recruitin' in Undermine, poachin' top people from every cartel. He pays better, so it's pretty tempting. He doesn't take just anyone, though. These spies aren't gonna make the cut, poor saps. Can you imagine betraying your cartel, and then you end up still working for them?

{{Gossip|Thanks, Zirdo.}}}}
{{Gossip|What do you know about Gutterville and the Black Blood pipeline?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Gallywix was interested in this Black Blood stuff, so anywhere we could find it was worth a lot. Venture Company bought this contract to do the digging, and set up camps. We founded Gutterville, and some other cartels are tryin' to make some cash here too.

The pipeline that sends the stuff up to distribution wasn't engineered by Pamsy. It was some other guy. He's dead now, nasty sickness. It happens further down in the south. Goblins get really sick and disappear.

You should trust ol' Zirdo on this one. Don't get sent down there.

{{Gossip|Thanks, Zirdo.}}}}}}
