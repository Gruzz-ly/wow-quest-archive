==Objectives==
Pick a headline with Dirk Greasedealer and then spread the word of revolution in Tailgate Park.
* Speak to [[Dirk Greasedealer]]
* Deface Darkfuse Propaganda (5)
* Throw pamphlets to [[Terrified Citizen]]s (10)
*[[Anti-Darkfuse Pamphlets]] (provided)

==Description==
No one's been stepped on harder by [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] than the [[Bilgewater Cartel]]. Plenty already want to rise up, but that ain't enough. We gotta show them what Gallywix has done and convince them that now is the time.

Let's start with a headline. C'mon, pitch me. A big shot like you carries our message better than anyone else.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Now is the time to rise up. Tell 'em, <name>.

==Completion==
There's change in the air. I can feel it.

==Notes==
After accepting both quests, speak with Dirk Greasedealer again:
{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|Ayo, this Gally-guy has gots to go! We gotta shout it from the rooftops, ya hear me?!

Give me the words and I'll make sure the people take it to the streets. What's the message people need to know about this chump Gallywix?

:{{Text|Say|Dirk Greasedealer|Now that's a headline! Share these old pamphlets. I'll get to work on the new and improved variety.}}

Throw the [[Anti-Darkfuse Pamphlets]] at the [[Terrified Citizen (Undermine)|Terrified Citizen]] and they will join the revolution. All over the park, spray [[Revolution Graffiti]] on the five Darkfuse Posters.

Dirk has something to say after finishing both quests:
:{{Text|Say|Dirk Greasedealer|I saw Gazlowe head into one of the buildings up ahead! I think he's lookin' for ya, <name>!}}

Go to the [[Dirigible Delivery]] where the [[Food Stall Vendor]] calls out:
:{{Text|Say|Food Stall Vendor|Pssst. Hey, <name>! In here! Gazlowe's lookin' for ya!}}

Head inside and turn in both quests to Gazlowe, who has gossip:
{{dialogue|Now I get what he was trying to tell me. The people need to know we're with them.}}

On complete:
:{{Text|Say|[[Nikki the Fixer]]|Ahahaha! That's right, run! The streets belong to [[Darkfuse Enforcement|Darkfuse]]! Don't forget it!}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Let's get that cackling assassin.}}
