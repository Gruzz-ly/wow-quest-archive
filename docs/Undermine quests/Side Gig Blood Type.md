==Objectives==
Collect 8 Darkfuse Research Notes in the [[Writhing Fields]].
*[[Darkfuse Research Notes]] (8)

==Description==
[[Darkfuse Enforcement|Darkfuse]] was up to all sorts of questionable research out in the [[Ringing Deeps]] and, well, everywhere, really.

Anyway, they had to write some of it down. Nab whatever notes you can find and bring them back to me.

Don't look at me like that. It's not intellectual dishonesty, it's industrial espionage!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Valorstones]] x48
*[[Weathered Undermine Crest]] x2
*[[The Cartels of Undermine Commendation]]
*[[Steamwheedle Cartel Commendation]]

==Progress==
Got the goods?

==Completion==
Not bad, temp. But don't go expecting a tip or anything.

==Patch changes==
