==Objectives==
Talk to Vrizek and make sure he has the Contract Fee.
* Talk to [[Vrizek]] {{co|54.6|51.6|Undermine}}
* [[Volo the Leg-Breaker]] slain {{co|49.0|42.3|Undermine}}
* [[Lenny the Loanshark]] slain

==Description==
We're a traditional [[goblin]] family, an' my sweetie's intended's from one too. Young people start work on a contract, an' buy each other out when they get hitched so they can get time off.

I've got the cash for my sweetie to buy her intended's contract out, but it would be... embarrassin' if her intended didn't have the moolah for my perfect peach's contract, ya know?

Go talk to that kid and make sure he's set for the big day. And if he's not? Fix it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Everything needs to be perfect for my girl's big day. Or else.

==Completion==
I figured something like that might happen. Good job.

==Notes==
Find [[Vrizek]] in [[Pleasant Heights]]:

{{dialogue|What do you want? I'm busy here!

{{gossip|quest=|<Ask if he has the contract fee for the wedding.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Vrizek|I had the cash, but a loan shark insisted I still owed him. I paid up last month!}}
:{{text|say|Vrizek|I've been working for my cousin tryin' to make up the missin' moolah.}}
:{{text|say|Vrizek|But if you... reacquired my funds, I'd have the contract fee and gold leftover for Neenee somethin' nice!}}

Find [[Lenny the Loanshark]] and [[Volo the Leg-Breaker]] on the top floor of the Bilgewater building in [[Tailgate Park]]. Speak with Lenny:
{{dialogue|class=plainlist|You wanna do business?
*{{gossip|quest=|Please give Vrizek's contract fee back.}}
*{{gossip|quest=|Hand over Vrizek's money and I won't have to get violent.}}
*{{gossip|quest=|<Punch him in the face.>}}
}}

Pick any option, they both go hostile:
:{{text|say|Lenny the Loanshark|I'll break your legs!}}

Fend them off, then return to Hovel Hill.
