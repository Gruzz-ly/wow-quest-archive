==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Darkfuse Spy-copter|Spy-copters]] to steal their footage.
*[[Spy-copter Footage Roll]] (8)
 
==Description==
That was rough, with [[Nikki the Fixer|Nikki]]. And worse, those Darkfuse Spy-copters saw everything. Feels like we can't get away from all the spies, don't it?

The last thing [[Venture Company|Venture]] needs is [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] thinking these workers ain't loyal cause they got caught on footage during one of Nikki's tantrums. We don't want a repeat of what happened to my last crew.

Go take the footage from the spy copters. They usually lurk around the workshops, or follow Venture workers around.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
There is nothing better than breaking bad machines for a good cause.

==Completion==
The less dirt on us [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] has, the better.

==Notes==
Kill eight [[Darkfuse Spy-copter]]s and loot the [[Spy-copter Footage Roll]]s from them.

Upon completion:

:''[[Orweyna]] swoops in to [[Venturewood]] and shifts to her normal form.''
:{{Text|Say|[[Orweyna]]|I have never seen a place like this!}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Grimla Fizzlecrank]]|Heh! Wait till you see uptown!}}

Orweyna continues the campaign, while [[Gas Grimeshank]], standing next to [[Gramps]], starts [[No More Walkin' Here]], unlocking the [[G-99 Breakneck]] and the [[D.R.I.V.E.]] system.
