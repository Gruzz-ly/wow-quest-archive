==Objectives==
Help [[Alice Grillspark]].
* Drink Potion of Comprehend Rats
* Rat Underground accessed (Optional)
* Vendor's Stall discovered.
* [[Comprehend Rat Language Potion]] (provided)

==Description==
<sniff> <sniff>

This potion has the scent of the Vatworks on it. There's a vendor at the northern edge there who sells potions. It must be from him. If you can find him, maybe you can get him to hand over an antidote.

Please help. You're the only one who can understand me!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
If you're reading this, I'm out scavenging for reagents along the [[Kaja'Coast]].

If you're here to collect on a debt, you are TRESPASSING and must disregard this note.

==Notes and trivia==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Alice Grillspark|I think the vendor has a stall in the northern edge of the [[Vatworks]]. Please get an antidote for me!}}
:{{Text|Say|Alice Grillspark|There should be a nearby rat burrow that exits around there.}}

Interact with the [[Underground Entrance]] to access the Rat Underground. It drops players off far to the north in the [[Vatworks]], next to an [[Undermine Resident]]:
:{{Text|Say|Undermine Resident|Ugh, that [[Getry Sellswill|Getry]]. Always in a rush and dropping his everywhere!}}

Head to the Vendor stall and an [[Angry Collector]] calls out:
:{{Text|Say|Angry Collector|Ey! Oh, just a rat.}}

Read the [[Note]] and turn in.
