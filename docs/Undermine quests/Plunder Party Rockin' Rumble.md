==Objectives==
Protect the Cellar Gnomes with the Mecha-Trianbell while they play.
*Defend the [[Cellar Gnomes]]

==Description==
Here! Take this Mecha-Trianbell! I don't care that you can't play an instrument because you WILL be playing this one. 

While we're jamming, members of rival bands will storm the stage to stop us. Not only will the Trianbell ring out in perfect pitch, it'll also blast anyone not in our band all the way to the cheap seats.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Stagecrasher's Gloves]]
* [[Stagecrasher's Legguards]]
* [[Stagecrasher's Shoulderguards]]
* [[Stagecrasher's Wristband]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Best gig we've ever played! It was a dang warzone, huh?

You did good. Get oldhair's new deed, and we'll sign.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Chancellor Gnome|Let me know when you're ready to start blastin'!}}

{{Dialogue|Let's get these people dancing so hard they sleep for a week.

{{Gossip|quest=|Let's kick it, Gnome.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Chancellor Gnome|TIME TO KICK IT, GNOMES!}}

When [[Crank Zenata Impersonator]]s, [[Gelvis Impersonator]]s and [[Azure Gob Collective]]s storm the stage during the performance Chancel Gnome yells one of the following:
*{{text|yell|Chancellor Gnome|WOULD YOU KNOCK IT OFF!}}
*{{text|yell|Chancellor Gnome|ALRIGHT! MOVE ALONG NOW!}}
*{{text|yell|Chancellor Gnome|DON'T WASTE MY TIME!}}
*{{text|yell|Chancellor Gnome|YO!}}

Once the performance is over she says:
:{{text|say|Chancellor Gnome|TIME TO BOLT! NO ENCORES!}}

On completion:
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|With a performance like that, ain't an establishment from here to Rachet that would turn you all down!}}
