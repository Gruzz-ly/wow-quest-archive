==Objectives==
Make trouble with the Darkfuse in Hovel Hill for Revilgaz.
*[[Arrogant Intruder]]s slain (6)
*[[Propaganda Pusher]]s slain (6)
*[[Recruitment Enforcer]]s slain (2)

==Description==
The Darkfuse are moving into Hovel Hill. It's the same thing they did at [[Blackwater Marina]]. Once they move in, they start pushing the locals around. Sometimes they just make 'em go away. It ain't right. I want to fight back, but my hands are tied. If an outsider showed up and started making trouble, that'd be a different story.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
If I had a few more like you I wouldn't have lost my... the marina.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both Eye Sores for Sore Eyes and [[Not Again!]];

Kill [[Arrogant Intruder]]s, [[Propaganda Pusher]]s, & [[Recruitment Enforcer]]s that are in [[Hovel Hill]], Once they're slain, return to [[Baron Revilgaz]] and turn in both quests.
