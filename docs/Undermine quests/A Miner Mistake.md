==Objectives==
Read the Crumpled Paystub, then bring it back to [[Gazlowe]]
* Read the note on the paystub
* Return to [[Gazlowe]] at the [[Kaja'Coast]]
* [[Crumpled Paystub (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<On the corpse of the [[Venture Supervisor|Venture Co. employee]], you find a crumpled piece of paper stuffed into an envelope. It appears to be a paystub from a kaja' mite depot in the Venture Co. area of Undermine.

Below the full address of the employer, there is a header stamped in red ink.>

[[Jastor Gallywix|GALLYWIX]]'S SECRET KAJA'MITE WAREHOUSE INTERNAL ONLY DO NOT ACTUALLY PRINT THAT

<A note from Gallywix is poorly taped to the back of the paystub.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Well, that answers that.

Venture Co. is gettin' paid by one of Gallywix's secret warehouses back in Undermine.

That means he's hoardin' all of this kaja'mite back there. What could he possibly need that much for?

==Notes==
While in the area for [[Crashing the Market]] and [[Asset Management]], make sure you loot from the [[Venture Supervisor]] the [[Crumpled Paystub]], which starts this quest.

On accept click on the [[Crumpled Paystub]] and read it.
:{{text|say|Jastor Gallywix|Your vacation request is DENIED. Also you're fired for asking. Leave your uniform outside the extremely secret kaja' mite warehouse, then GET OUT OF MY CITY.}}

Once done with the other quests, find Monte Gazlowe and [[Renzik]],
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Hey, what do you got there? Is that a....paystub?}}
