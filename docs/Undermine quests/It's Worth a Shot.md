==Objectives==
Attempt to convince 10 Underpaid Workers to quit Venture Co.
*Venture Co. uniform equipped
*Venture employees confronted (10)
*[[Spare Venture Co. Uniform]] (provided)

==Description==
Venture Co. has a pretty bad track record, but not everyone workin' for the cartel is bad news. Some of us are tryin' to make ends meet.

Maybe we can talk sense into some of 'em. Less Venture workers means less people doin' Gallywix's dirty work.

Venture Co. employs a lot of non- goblins, so no one will question you bein' around as long as you've got a uniform on. I've got a spare that will probably, mostly, sorta fit you.

See if you can get 'em to quit. If they start a fight, do what you gotta do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
That'll do.

Even one fewer goblin workin' for Gallywix is a win in my book.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both It's Worth a Shot and [[Check the Schedule]], the Disguised extra action button appears. 
:{{Text|Say|[[Grimla Fizzlecrank]]|Toss on this Venture uniform so they think you're an employee. Maybe you can talk some of 'em into quitting.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Renzik "The Shiv"]]|And grab the schedules posted around. We need to know where the workers are going and where the kaja'mite is coming from.}}
:''[[Monte Gazlowe]], [[Grimla Fizzlecrank]], and [[Renzik "The Shiv"]] leave.''

Use the button and don the disguise.

All over the [[Heaps (Undermine)|Heaps]], you must convince the [[Underpaid Worker]]s to stop working:
{{Dialogue|What do you want?

{{Gossip|quest=|Come on, let's get out of here. I'm tired of working for [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]], aren't you?}}
}}

The response depends on how friendly  the underpaid worker is. If the response is positive, they would leave.
:{{Text|Say|Underpaid Worker|Grimla's right, no paycheck is worth this.}}

If the response is negative, some Underpaid Workers would refuse and fights you.
:{{Text|Say|Underpaid Worker|I can't afford to quit now!}}
:{{Text|Say|Underpaid Worker|You ain't takin' my promotion from me!}}
:Make sure you fight the Underpaid worker until his or her health is depleted.
:{{Text|Say|Unpaid Worker|The things they have us do, I'm out!}}
:{{Text|Say|Unpaid Worker|But I was goin'... to the [[Kaja'Coast]]!}}

Meet up back with [[Monte Gazlowe]], [[Renzik "The Shiv"]] & [[Grimla Fizzlecrank]] and turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|[[Renzik "The Shiv"]]|The foreman's guardin' the office. His weapons look... off. You know anything about 'em?}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Grimla Fizzlecrank]]|Like anyone would tell me.}}
