==Description==
Did you know that crocodiles can grow indefinitely?

Well, the owner of this crocodile didn't. And when it got too big, it was released. Normally these crocodiles make their way out of the Undermine. But this one decided it liked the taste of [[goblin]]s and stayed.

If you're up for it, the people of Undermine could use someone brave to face it. Are you game?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Who's afraid of a big ol' croc, you say?

==Completion==
It's done then. The people of Undermine won't realize what you did, but I do. Thanks from all of us.

==Notes==
Upon approaching the sewer entrance, [[Harris]] is nearby:
:{{text|say|Harris|Eyo, over 'ere! It's me, Harris!}}
:{{text|say|Harris|I'ma hang out up 'ere. Good luck with that agilla-alliga--uh... Croc-o-dile. He's a big'un. Bigger 'den me!}}

Head downstairs, defeat the mob, loot the corpse, then return to HQ and place it on the wall.
