==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Raging Kaja'mite Gemsplitter.png|Raging Kaja'mite Gemsplitter|A primal mass of raging earth and crystal too angry to be reasoned with.}}
Use the prototype to weaken & kill the Raging Kaja'mite Gemsplitter.
*Shrink the Gemsplitter {{co|24.9|60.0|Zuldazar}}
*[[Raging Kaja'mite Gemsplitter]] slain
*[[Massive Kaja'mite Chunk]]
*[[Jazz's Shrink Ray]] (provided)

==Description==
Hey, <name>, I'm not usually one for revenge, but I've got an idea.

That big guy who tossed us around ran up this way. I'll bet you good money it's in the mines somewhere, and I bet we could get a giant sample off its body. That'd set me up real nice for future tinkering.

Besides, taking it out means it won't come back, and I'd like to finish this gig intact. I've got bills to pay, and kids to feed! 

Try the shrink ray on that hunk o' rock. Show it who's boss! For science, of course.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Dust-Covered Cloak]]
* [[Kaja-Infused Cloak]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*15,250 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Good to see you in one piece. How'd it go?

==Completion==
I owe ya, buddy, big time. We're definitely in business if our lil' prototype took that hulking thing down a couple notches!

I'm gonna have to get a bigger team out here to keep tinkering. There's definitely more to kaja'mite than weapons or soft drinks, I'll tell ya what.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|I'll start writing up my report for HQ while you're kickin' butt! Meet me on the beach when you're done.}}
:''Jazz runs off.''

Enter the [[Lucky Break Mines]] and use [[Jazz's Shrink Ray]] on all kaja'mentals inside to reduce their max health and damage dealt by 50%.

==Progression==
