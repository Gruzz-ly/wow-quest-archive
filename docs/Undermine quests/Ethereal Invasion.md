'''Ethereal Invasion''' is one of the two quests that begins the fourth chapter of the [[Undermine(d) campaign]]: "Breaking the Shackles".

==Objectives==
Kill 10 Ethereals in the [[Vatworks]].
*[[Ethereal]]s slain (10)

==Description==
Just moments ago, these ethereals appeared out of nowhere. They attacked [[Marin Noggenfogger|Noggenfogger]] and attempted to haul him off. I made short work of the first attackers, but they keep coming.

Now they're searching every building and killing anyone who stands in their way.

I don't know what they're looking for, but we can't allow them to continue this slaughter.

Let's teach them a lesson.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
The ethereals were not expecting to meet resistance here. They were wrong.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting Ethereal Invasion and [[Phase Shift (quest)]]
:{{Text|Say|[[Alleria Windrunner]]|Hopefully that resonance will give us an idea of who's behind this attack.}}
:''Alleria accompanies the player for both quests.''

Kill every [[Ethereal Warpblade]]s & [[Ethereal Mind-Scraper]]s that are in the [[Vatworks]].

Speak to Alleria Windrunner and turn in both quests.

==Progression==
{{Breaking the Shackles}}
