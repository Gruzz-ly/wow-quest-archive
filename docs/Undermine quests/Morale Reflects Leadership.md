==Objectives==
Find the goblin in charge of the Bilgewater Cartel in Undermine.
* Search upstairs for information.
* [[Delby Overbite]] questioned

==Description==
Undermine swallows everything that's good. Now it got [[Laslo Overbite|Laslo]]. We need to find who's in charge now and figure out how to keep 'em safe. I think I know where to start askin'.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
This ain't no place for good goblins.

==Completion==
At least no single goblin is [[Gallywix]]'s next target, for now. That will give us time to deal with the [[Black Blood]]. Then we can figure out how to get my people out of Gallywix's grasp.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|[[Monte Gazlowe]]|I need to see it with my own eyes.}}
:''Gazlowe and [[Renzik "The Shiv"]] leave.''
:{{Text|Say|[[Grimla Fizzlecrank]]|I'll stay with our ride. In case we need a quick escape.}}

Run upstairs in the Bilgewater HQ:
:{{Text|say|[[Belx Geargrinder]]|Something gotta be done about the Darkfuse. Bilgewater can't go on like this.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Cammy Peepers]]|Not so loud. It'll only make things worse.}}
:{{Text|say|Belx Geargrinder|It might have to get worse to get better.}}

Continue upstairs and that's to catch up with [[Gazlowe]] and [[Renzik "The Shiv"]], who are talking with [[Delby Overbite]]:
{{Dialogue|My brother Laslo did his best for the Bilgewater in Undermine.

{{Gossip|quest=|What happened?}}

{{dialogue-child|It's been a slippery slope with [[Gallywix]]. He manipulated a lot of Laslo's friends, forcing Laslo to go along with some awful deals.

Laslo stood up to Gallywix, but you know how that ended. That's when the Darkfuse came.

Nobody's stepped up to lead us since that night.

{{Gossip|quest=|Thank you for explaining.}}}}

{{gossip|Why don't you run things now?}}

{{dialogue-child|No way, I got a little daughter. Gallywix would have no problem goin' after her.<br>

{{gossip|<Ask about something else.>}}}}

{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Play Movie)}} Remind me of the events so far.}}}}

After exhausting the quest prompts:
:{{Text|Say|[[Monte Gazlowe]]|Laslo... how could Gallywix do this?}}
:{{text|emote|Delby sighs and shakes her head sadly.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Renzik "The Shiv"]]|Cause no one stopped him.}}
:''Gazlowe and Renzik head downstairs.''

The movie option replays the on-login [[The War Within in-game cinematics|pre-rendered cutscene]]:

:{{Text|bossemote|Laslo Overbite|Who's with me?}}
:''Gallywix and his bodyguard [[Ug]] comes in and the bodyguard opens the doors as Laslo Overbite, [[Nikki the Fixer]], [[Marin Noggenfogger]], and [[Baron Revilgaz]] are having a meeting and they all gasped. Jastor proceeds into the meeting room.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|All right.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|I'm busy.}}

:''Jastor sits on the chairs and sighs.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|...what is it you want?}}
:''Laslo gulped and speaks.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Laslo Overbite|I'll tell you what we want, Gallywix.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Laslo Overbite|We've had enough of your meddlin',}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Laslo Overbite|and you as boss.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Laslo Overbite|We want a new deal.}}
:''Ug approaches near Laslo. Jastor stared for a while and then he laughs.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Hear that, Ug?}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|"A new deal"}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|And you all feel the same way, huh?}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|You, Revilgaz?}}
:''Revilgaz stayed silent.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Nikki?}}
:''Nikki cackled maniacally.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Noggenfogger?}}
:''Marin still stays silent. But Laslo sighs.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Laslo Overbite|Marin...}}
:''Marin looks at Laslo.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|No?}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|So, really, it's just...}}
:''Jastor points his cane at Laslo.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|you.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Lazlo Overbite.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Just a little guy from my former operation,}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|a long time ago.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Gazlowe put you up to this?}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|That dirty, stinkin' rat!}}
:''Jastor slams his cane to the table and pulls it up.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|I'd ask you to stick around, but we got real business.}}
:''Jastor leaves his chair as he continues.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|You understand.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Ug, show our guest...}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|out.}}
:''Ug pulls out his gun with everyone staring in shock. Laslo gasps in horror as the weapon turns him to ash. Everyone gasps and screams as they ran away. Ug leaves the meeting room and clsoes the doors leaving only Jastor who chuckles.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Meeting adjourned.}}
:''The void mist comes in as Jastor starts walking but he was stopped by the Harbinger [[Xal'atath]].''
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|I see you are already making good use of the Black Blood.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Um...Xal'atath.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Nice to see ya.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|What brings you here?}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|It has been some time.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Is everything proceeding as planned?}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|The repairs have been more challenging than expected.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|The costs alone...}}
:''Xal'atath appears from behind.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|...are irrelevant.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Of course.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|I, uh...}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|I just need more time.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Do not disappoint me.}}
:''Xal'atath vanishes into the void mist leaving Jastor alone.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Don't you worry.}}
:''Jastor's placating smile shifts to a scowl.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|I won't.}}
