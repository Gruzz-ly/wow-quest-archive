Deliver Jazz's Report to Kory Hoxx in the [[Incontinental Hotel]].
* Use the Coastside Drill to enter Undermine (Optional) {{co|22.6|54.1|Zuldazar}}
* Return to [[Kory Hoxx]]
* [[Jazz's Report]] (provided)

==Description==
You've really helped me out here, <name>, but I need one more teeny tiny favor from you. 

<Jazz hands over an envelope stuffed to the brim with schematics and paper reports.>

Could ya get this to my contract agent, Kory Hoxx? He'll get it to HQ. You'll probably catch him in the Incontinental Hotel, putting up more gig sheets.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]
* +200 reputation with [[Cartels of Undermine]]

==Progress==
Can't ya see I'm a little busy here? Recruitment's hard work, ya know!

==Completion==
Oh, Jazz has an update? Well why didn't ya say so!

<Kory snatches the envelope, tearing it open and looking at the report.>

He needs HOW MANY people?!

==Notes==
On the beach, Jazz has new gossip:
{{dialogue|Can ya believe some people still drink that Kaja'cola stuff? Blech! I'm never touchin' it again, nevermind letting my kids near it. Nope, nada, end of story.

Usin' it to increase rocket fuel efficiency however? Now you've got my attention!}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|I can't tell ya just how much you helped me, <name>. We only scratched the surface of what kaja'mite can do!}}
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Today, it's a shrink ray to improve our transport efficiency. Tomorrow, it could be anythin'! Rocket fuel, power cells, just imagine!}}

Take the rocket drill back to Undermine, then return to [[Kory Hoxx]] at the [[Incontinental Hotel]]:
:{{text|say|Kory Hoxx|I can't pull a crew of twenty out of thin air!}}
:{{text|say|Kory Hoxx|I can't believe him, does he expect me to work miracles? This is ridiculous!}}
