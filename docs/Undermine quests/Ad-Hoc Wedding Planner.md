{{dialogue|title=Vrizek|Being married feels great!

{{gossip|quest=|<Offer congratulations.>}}

Today was a blur, but in the best kind of way. I can't thank you enough for helpin' my sweetie and I get hitched.}}

{{dialogue|title=Neenee Torquewrench|I can't believe that went so smoothly!

{{gossip|quest=|<Offer congratulations.>}}

This wedding was everything I ever wanted and I owe it to my Papa and to you. I wanted the best blowout this town has ever seen and I got it! I wanted the best food and glitziest gifts and everyone on my perfect guest list and you made that happen! And I got a big-name, bona fide Champion of Azeroth to boot!

Thank you for making this the most perfect day, <name>!}}
