==Objectives==
Hand the Gallagio over.
*Collect Notarized Deed

==Description==
You'd make a good lawyerer, you know that?

Hah! Just kidding! The real industry secret is that there's no such thing as a good lawyerer!

Why don't you join me at the Gallagio's entrance? It'll be a nice send off for the kids who are gonna run this place now.

Not to mention that we should actually hand them the notarized deed!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Public Defender's Coat]]
*{{cost|11|70}}
*1,400 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]
*+100 reputation with [[Cartels of Undermine]]

==Progress==
You teary-eyed because our adventure is over?

Or because you were secretly hoping the place would go to auction, and you'd have a chance to buy it up?

Bet it was the latter! Hah!

==Completion==
Sometimes it feels like there's a never ending stream of problems to solve coming out of the proverbial sewer drain. Doesn't it. <Name>?

But this one... Well, let's just say that this one feels like a personal favor to all of [[Undermine]].

Ain't no key to the city, but Marty wanted to pass on one his best lawyerin' outfits to you. Wear it with pride, kid.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Grab the deed off Judge Landro's pulpit.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Ow! Stubbed my toe on a goon!}}

Upon delivering the deed to the chiefs in the presence of Marty and the cartel leaders:
:{{text|say|Jojo Gobdre|Thanks, kid. You settled this nightmare up real well.}}
:{{text|say|Kayjay|Sad without Rosebud here. He had one of those brains for, you know...}}
:{{text|say|Chancellor Gnome|Management?}}
:{{text|say|Kayjay|Management! Yes! Whereas our brains are more, you know, more...}}
:{{text|say|Fantastic Davey|Specialized. Brains for clear pictures, not big ones.}}
:{{text|say|Jojo Gobdre|What we're trying to say is that we could use a new partner to fill that gap.}}
:{{text|say|Jojo Gobdre|<Name>, would you mind...}}
:{{text|say|Jojo Gobdre|Would you mind joining us in congratulating Marty on becoming the Gallagio's new Chief Goblins Officer!}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Wha?! You mean it? I accept!}}
:{{text|say|Jojo Gobdre|Wonderful! We'll be inside when you're ready to talk details.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Know what, <name>? From the moment you rescued me out of a stack of my own case files, I knew you were more than you appeared to be.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|More than just a simple, dimension-trotting, demigod-slaying, wardrobe-collecting whirlwind of empowered chaos.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|I knew you were, above all else, a good egg.}}

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Baron Revilgaz|What now? Should we grab some lunch?}}
:{{text|say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Fine. But let's go somewhere new. I'm tired of the dome's food court.}}
:{{text|say|Marin Noggenfogger|Sprinkle won't be happy when she finds out we didn't invite her.}}
:{{text|say|Baron Revilgaz|Then invite her.}}
:{{text|say|Marin Noggenfogger|I can't. Because then she'll think we're inviting her out of pity.}}
:{{text|say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|You're overcomplicating this, Marin.}}
:''Gazlowe cackles like a landfill hyena.''
:{{text|say|Marin Noggenfogger|I've got it! We say Gazlowe passed out on the street from hunger, and we were forced to eat without her to save his life!}}
:{{text|say|Baron Revilgaz|I don't care either way. I was promised lunch. Just give me lunch.}}
