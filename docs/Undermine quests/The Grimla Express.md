[[File:The Grimla Express.jpg|thumb|[[Grimla Fizzlecrank]], [[Renzik "The Shiv"]], and [[Monte Gazlowe]] at [[Tailgate Park]]]]

==Objectives==
Head to [[Tailgate Park]] in [[Gramps|Grimla's hot rod]].
* Ride the hot rod

==Description==
Next stop, Tailgate Park. [[Bilgewater Cartel]] used to be in charge there, but [[Gallywix]] had other plans. Now the Darkfuse act like they own the place and the Bilgewater... Well, they do the best they can.

I'm not sure who runs it now, if anyone does.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
They look up to [[Monte Gazlowe|Gazlowe]]. Maybe you folks showing up will give 'em a little hope.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Next stop Tailgate Park! All aboard!}}

{{Dialogue|title=Monte Gazlowe|Bilgewater's in a rough spot. Sounds like they're really at the bottom of Undermine's pecking order. [[Gallywix]] has gotta be to blame for that.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Renzik "The Shiv"|Things are lookin' worse and worse, the more we dig.}}

Interact with [[Gramps]] to jump into it and [[Grimla Fizzlecrank]], [[Renzik "The Shiv"]], & [[Monte Gazlowe]] hop in too:
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Darkfuse kinda took over Tailgate Park.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|I left [[Laslo Overbite]] in charge, I need to talk to him.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Gazlowe... they killed him.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|I remember things being bad. This is worse than expected.}}
:''The party arrives at [[Tailgate Park]].''

Characters have new gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Monte Gazlowe|Looking around, I see more Darkfuse than Bilgewater.

<Monte Gazlowe's expression darkens, and he shakes his head slowly.>

I know Laslo wouldn't have stood for it. And that must have put a target on his back.}}
:{{Gossip|Are the Bilgewater goblins in Undermine part of the Horde?}}

:{{Text|Gossip|Look it's complicated. I got the contracts around here somewhere. If you were on the [[Life Savings|original boat]] from [[Kezan]], signed on later for a promotion like me, or settled in [[Orgrimmar]] -- or took an advanced Orgrimmar correspondence course -- you are clearly a member fo the Horde.
:Goblins who have only lived in Undermine, or outlying suburbs, are not de facto Horde citizens as such if they don't know nothin' about it...
:I gotta talk to the [[Horde Council]] about this. Just don't worry about it for now.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Renzik "The Shiv"|Gazlowe ain't gonna like the look of this place, not one bit!}}

==Progression==
{{Undermine Awaits}}

*{{Patch 11.1.0|note=Added.}}
