==Objectives==
Ride the [[Gramps|hot rod]] to the [[Venturewood]] and assist friendly [[Venture Co.]] goblins.
*Ride the hot rod 
*Talk to Pamsy
*Confront Nikki the Fixer
*Aid Venture Co Goblins (4)
 
==Description==
We're headed to my home turf next. [[Venturewood]], It's next to the [[Heaps (Undermine)|Heaps]].

The [[Venture Company]] is mostly on board for [[Gallywix]]. That means a lot of the top brass are as dirty as him. Watch your step.

But there are some good folks there too. Like Pamsy and her crew. The little guy at Venture gets it rough. Everyone thinks of Venture Co. as just the baddies, so no one looks after them. But I gotta try right?

Hop in the hot rod, I'll show you what I mean.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Grateful Goblin's Blade]]
* [[Grateful Goblin's Cudgel]]
* [[Grateful Goblin's Dagger]]
* [[Grateful Goblin's Mallet]]
* [[Grateful Goblin's Shield]]
* [[Grateful Goblin's Sword]]
* [[Grateful Goblin's Wand]]
* [[Grateful Goblin's Water Bottle]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Seems like there's no respect for the little guys.

==Completion==
You did good for those goblins. Nikki brings the chaos--and not in the fun way.

==Notes==
Interact with [[Gramps]] and [[Grimla Fizzlecrank]] will drive over:
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Last stop, the Heaps. My home turf.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Monte Gazlowe]]|He's infected every part of the city. The cartels ain't even standing up for themselves.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Renzik "The Shiv"]]|We just gotta push them, Gazlowe.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|He heh. That's the spirit. As they say, "There is no rain in Undermine." Isn't really a sun either.}}
:''Grimla stops at [[Venturewood]], and walks up to [[Pamsy]] and [[Nikki the Fixer]], the latter in an Executive Package bubble keeping her safe and aloft.''
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Hey! Nikki! Venture works for [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] now. Why are Darkfuse here?}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Nikki the Fixer]]|Cause Darkfuse keeps you nobodies in line.}}

New gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Grimla Fizzlecrank|This place might be called Venturewood now, but we're still just a neighborhood of the Heaps. It's not actually fancy!

{{Gossip|Is being part of Venture Co. really worth the trouble?}} (Goblin only)
{{Dialogue-child|Goblin's gotta try, don't she? Where would Bilgewater be if you didn't stick with them?}}
}}
{{dialogue|title=Renzik "The Shiv"|Each [[Venture Company]] goblin feels like they could go either way in helping us.}}
{{dialogue|title=Monte Gazlowe|After the [[Zirdo]] situation, it's hard to trust anyone out here.}}

Speak with [[Pamsy]]:
{{Dialogue|Nikki's solidly in Gallywix's pocket. 
She used to be my friend.

{{Gossip|quest=|You should talk to her.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Pamsy|You can't treat our own crew like this, Nikki.}}
:''Nikki flies towards Grimla.''
:{{Text|Say|Nikki the Fixer|I ain't like you. I'm at the big table. I'm going places.}}
:{{Text|Emote|Nikki stares at [[Gazlowe]] a little too long.}}
:{{Text|Say|Nikki the Fixer|You're the one who gets to stick around and... and mop up this mess.}}
:''She throws the bomb and destroys the building and flies off. Some Venture Company Goblins ran out of the building as [[Renzik "The Shiv"]] and [[Monte Gazlowe]] go and put the flames out.''

New gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Renzik "The Shiv"|Help those goblins. Gazlowe and I got the fire.}}
{{dialogue|title=Monte Gazlowe|We'll handle this fire!}}

Go to [[Magsy Bootstrap]]{{Co|43.6|61.2|Undermine}} and aid her.
:{{Text|Say|Magsy Bootstrap|Venture sells out and all we get is twenty hour shifts.}}

Go to [[Waxle Bangsaw]]{{Co|44.6|60.6|Undermine}} and aid him.
:{{Text|Say|Waxle Bangsaw|Venture was always a rough job, but it seemed better before Gallywix came to town.}}

Go to [[Evwix Bentrocket]]{{Co|43.6|59.6|Undermine}} and aid her.
:{{Text|Say|Evwix Bentrocket|Grimla sent you? She's a good one.}}

Go to [[Mux Skullskipper]]{{Co|42.6|63.0|Undermine}} and aid him.
:{{Text|Say|Mux Skullskipper|Nikki wants a shortcut to the top, but we do all the work for it.}}

On complete:
:{{Text|Say|Pamsy|[[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]]'s arrival brought out the worst in some goblins.}}
