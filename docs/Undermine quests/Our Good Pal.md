==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Zirdo's drill machine.png|Zirdo|Zirdo betrayed the [[Venture Company]] to "earn" his promotion to Overseer of the Heaps.}}
Kill Zirdo.
*[[Zirdo]] slain

==Description==
Our old pal Zirdo's back. It looks like he's been promoted to Overseer of the Heaps, keeping track of the [[Black Blood]] shipments.

We owe him some payback for sellin' us out in [[Gutterville]]. He got a lot of good goblins killed to get on [[Gallywix]]'s good side. Give the little snitch what he deserves.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of the following:
* [[Zirdo's Dirty Mantle]]
* [[Zirdo's Dirty Greaves]]
* [[Zirdo's Dirty Grips]]
* [[Zirdo's Dirty Headgear]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Zirdo's got this coming.

==Completion==
I ain't forgot what he did to [[Pamsy]]'s crew in Gutterville... This was for them too.

==Notes==
