==Objectives==
Reach the Safe.
*Ride [[Moneymaker Service Balloon|Service Balloon]]
*Find [[Darkfuse Safe|Safe]]
*[[Boomball]]s planted (4)

==Description==
Okay, we got this.

Me, you, and loudmouth here are going to hop this service balloon and get up to that airship over the arena.

That is where they are keeping the loot. Once we get aboard, fighting space will be tight. I got us some uniforms so we'll look like people who work there but try not to start anything.

Ready?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Okay, this might not "look" like loot but I promise you... well... um....

Look we get out of this and I swear I will pay you back somehow.

==Notes==
Interact with the Moneymaker Service Balloon to hop on alongside, Skedgit and [[Ripsnoodle]].
:{{Text|Say|Ripsnoodle|You know how to fly this, right?}}
:{{Text|Say|Skedgit Cinderbangs|Sure, This button is the booster--}}
:{{Text|Say|Skedgit Cinderbangs|AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!}}
:{{Text|Say|Ripsnoodle|AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗ!!!!!}}

Skedgit navigates the balloon to ''[[The Moneymaker]]'' floating above [[Blackwater Marina]].

Head to the lower deck to find the Darkfuse Safe. Interact with it to examine it.
:{{Text|Say|Skedgit Cinderbangs|That's it! That's the loot. Let her Rip! }}
:{{Text|Say|Ripsnoodle|This is too heavy to open here. <Name>, plant these Boomballs around the base.}}

Plant the four boomballs, then Skedgit and Ripsnoodle head to the top of the safe:
:{{Text|Say|Skedgit Cinderbangs|Okay, up here. Grab my hand and let's blow this!}}

Speak with Skedgit Cinderbangs:
{{Dialogue|Now the fun part! Grab on!

{{gossip|quest=|Grab on.}}
}}
The Goblin Zeppelin blows up! Skedgit, Ripsnoodle, and the adventurer begin falling to the lake of [[Blackwater Marina]]:
:{{Text|Yell|Skedgit Cinderbangs|AAAAAAAAAAAAaaaahhh!}}
:{{Text|Yell|Ripsnoodle|Aaaaaaaaahhh!}}

Conveniently, the adventurer is debuffed with slow fall. Swim ashore and catch up with Skedgit, Ripsnoodle, [[Goldmine]] and [[Great Granny Cinderbangs]], who was in the safe this whole time!
:{{Text|Say|Skedgit Cinderbangs|Great Gran?! You were in the safe?! Where is the loot?}}
:{{Text|Say|Great Granny Cinderbangs|The one and only, kid! I'm the best treasure you'll ever heist.}}
:{{Text|Say|Skedgit Cinderbangs|No time! We gotta get out of here before the Fuse find us.}}

Several characters have gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Ripsnoodle|Great Granny Cinderbangs was in that safe?!

What happened to all the dough? All the loot? All the treasure? All the haul?

I mean... I love that we are rescuing my gran. I just... could have used that startup capital.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Pre-Expert Goldmine|I always knew getting mixed up in [[Venture Company]] drama was going to get me running from the Fuse someday.}}
{{dialogue|title=Great Granny Cinderbangs|It is so great being out of that box!

Gallywix thought he was being clever by shoving me in there as a punishment. Oh, wait till I get ahold of his nose hairs!

Thanks for springing me, kid. Now let's finish this springing.}}
