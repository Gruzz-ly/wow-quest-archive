==Objectives==
Collect 10 Unseemly Growths in the [[Writhing Fields]].
*Obtain 25+ stacks of Unseeming Shift
*[[Unseemly Growth]] (10)

==Description==
There's all sorts of weirdness going on in the [[Ringing Deeps]] thanks to all that [[Black Blood]] still lying around. And where there's madness and mutation, there's opportunity! Get out there and see what sort of horrific but potentially lucrative reagents you can scrape up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Coffer Key Shard]] x8
*[[Valorstones]] x9
*[[Weathered Undermine Crest]] x2
*[[The Cartels of Undermine Commendation]]
*[[Steamwheedle Cartel Commendation]]

==Progress==
Try not to go crazy until after delivery, ok?

==Completion==
I'm sure the boys in R&D will be able to do something with...whatever these are.

...do you hear whispering?
