'''The Hole Deal''' concludes the optional "Fore!" storyline of [[Sojourner of Undermine]], located at the [[Emerald Hills Golf Course]] in southeastern [[Undermine]].

This quest is repeated in the world quest [[Boomball (world quest)]].

==Objectives==
Sink 4 [[Boomball]]s into the four golf holes.
* Holes-In-One (4)

==Description==
Okay, well now that's settled, how about you get a free go, eh?

Here at...

<Ripsnoodle pauses to look at notes he digs out of his pocket.> 

[[Emerald Hills Golf Course]], we pride ourselves on everyone gettin' a hole-in-one!

Especially since our boomballs explode after the first swing. So make 'em count.

Go take a few balls out and give the course a whack.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Elite Golfer's Armbands]]
*[[Elite Golfer's Headgear]]
*[[Elite Golfer's Belt]]
*[[Elite Golfer's Legguards]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 15,250 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]
* +100 reputation with [[Cartels of Undermine]]

==Completion==
That was some impressive puttin'!

==Notes==
Interact with the Boomballs on the field to start golfing. Players will have access to four abilities:
#{{Abilities|Putt|id=465554|range=5-35|Lightly putt a Boomball up to 5 to 35 yds with best accuracy.|icon=achievement_reputation_01}}
#{{Abilities|Drive|id=465555|range=20 - 60|Drive a Boomball up to 20 to 60 yds with some accuracy.|icon=ability_warrior_strengthofarms}}
#{{Abilities|Explosive Drive|id=466290|range=50 - 100|Explosively Drive a Boomball up to 50 to 100 yds with minimal accuracy.|icon=ability_rogue_distract}}
#{{Abilities|Mulligan|id=466934|range=1000|Cancel the swing without anyone judging you... except yourself.|icon=thumbsdown}}

Use either Drive or Explosive Drive to hit the ball into the hole. Do this for four Boomballs.

After the boomball lands, control it with WASD to nudge it into the hole.
