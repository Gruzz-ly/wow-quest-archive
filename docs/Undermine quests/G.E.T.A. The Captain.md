==Objectives==
{{questportrait|The Captain.png|The Captain|A cave skipper riding other cave skippers into battle? Incredible, literally. No one will believe you.}}

Defeat [[the Captain]]
* Sewer Entrance reached {{co|55.1|62.4|Undermine}}
* [[Bait (Undermine)|Bait]] placed
* [[The Captain's Head]]
* Trophy Retrieved

==Description==
This is a unique one. 

Some cave skippers got into the Undermine sewers and are starting to populate, causing all sorts of problems. It looks like an especially big one is organizing them somehow.

We've taken to calling him "the Captain."

Make sure his reign of finned, eye-bulging terror ends today.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Belt of the Certified Hunter]]
* [[Helm of the Certified Hunter]]
* [[Boots of the Certified Hunter]]
* [[Wristwraps of the Certified Hunter]]

You will also receive:
* 10x [[Valorstones]]
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Cartels of Undermine]]

==Progress==
Be careful, <name>. From what we can tell, The Captain doesn't work alone.

==Completion==
I've never thought of cave skippers as overly dangerous or organized. Looks like there's a lot about them we don't know.

==Notes==
Reaching the sewer entrance to find [[Harris]] nearby:
:{{text|say|Harris|'Ey yo it's me, Harris!}}
:{{text|say|Harris|We got some slippery slimy skippers in here, yah.}}

Place the Captain's head in the trophy stand:
:{{text|say|Colton|Looks like the Captain gave his last order!}}
