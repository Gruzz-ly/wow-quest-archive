==Objectives==
Save any hostages [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] is keeping in the warehouse and slay 10 Ethereal Heartseekers.
*Hostages rescued (3)
*Ethereal Heartseeker slain (10)
*Cave entrance found

==Description==
We need to split up.

Alleria is the best one to look for the Dark Heart. You, me, and Renzik will look for the hostages. Here's hoping they're still safe.

They left some ambushers behind, but we got the best of Sl:7 on our side. You think you see one of them hiding, point them out to Renzik. He'll toss a smoke bomb. That'll flush 'em out and stun 'em, so we can turn the tables.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Sabatons of the Liberator]]
* [[Robe of the Liberator]]
* [[Shoulderguards of the Liberator]]
* [[Cinch of the Liberator]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
The hostages are safe. Gallywix doesn't have leverage on any of the cartels anymore. Time to finish this.

==Notes==
Upon accept, Monte Gazlowe & [[Renzik "The Shiv"]] will accompany you.
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Careful, ethereals like to hide. They might be watchin' the place.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|I can smoke 'em out. Just point to the spot.}}

You can use {{Abilities|Smoke Bomb|icon=ability_rogue_smoke}} and throw it at the [[Ethereal Heartseeker]]s. Once they're revealed you take them out.

Approach near the first area in Gallywix's Warehouse where [[Sprinkle Noggenfogger]] is held. {{Co|55.6|58.6|Undermine}}.
:{{Text|Yell|Sprinkle Noggenfogger|Hey! Hey, help me! Please!}}
Go into the first warehouse and free Sprinkle.
:{{Text|Say|Sprinkle Noggenfogger|What happened? What were all those bandage- monsters? Where's Marin?}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|He's waitin' for you back at Bilgewater headquarters. The way's clear.}}

Travel to another part of the warehouse where [[Fleet Master Seahorn]] is held captive. {{Co|57.2|57.2|Undermine}}
:{{Text|Yell|Fleet Master Seahorn|I'm up here! Get me loose from these chains!}}
:Head upstairs and break three chains from him.
:{{Text|Say|Fleet Master Seahorn|AGH! Those scurvy Darkfuse dogs! I'd kill 'em myself if they weren't already dead!}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|There'll be plenty more to kill later. Revilgaz is back at our headquarters. Go!}}
:Fleet Master Seahorn runs off.

:GO to the third part of the warehouse where [[Hobart Grapplehammer]] is held captive building a mech.{{Co|57.6|54.6|Undermine}}
:{{Text|Yell|Hobart Grapplehammer|Is someone out there?}}
interact with the chain and free Hobart.
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Hobart? You're Bilgewater, why did Gallywix grab you?}}
:{{Text|Say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Because I'm a genius. That's why he wasted my time making these weapons for him.}}
:{{Text|Say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Meanwhile he ran off to his little cave over there to work on the Dark Heart.}}
:Hobart runs off

Head to the cave entrance. However, it was blocked...
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Entrance is barricaded. I'd bet this is the place.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|I've got some explosives on me. Gimme me a second.}}
