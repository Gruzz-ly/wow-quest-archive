There ya are! I'm Grimla. Welcome to Undermine. If you wanna get up to speed with the current situation, you've come to the right goblin. [[Pamsy]] vouched for you, that's good enough for me.

==Progress==
Did you hear anything good while you were gettin' yourself settled?

==Completion==
So, that's the Incontinental Hotel. Things go downhill from here.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|[[Monte Gazlowe]]|Never thought I'd be back here. Better get started.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Orweyna]]|I'll see if I can track the [[Black Blood]].}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Grimla Fizzlecrank]]|You're gonna wanna keep a low profile. [[Gallywix]] is not a fan.}}
:{{text|emote|Orweyna nods.}}
:''Orweyna turns into a bat and flies off.''
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|I came to fix problems, not make new ones.}}

Interact with [[Gramps]] to take a seat in the hot rod:
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Pile in! Don't be shy.}}
:''Monte Gazlowe & [[Renzik "The Shiv"]] jump in [[Gramps]].''
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|First stop, the Incontinental Hotel. Goblins of all sorts congregate there. It's a great place to get the latest word.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Undermine smells worse than I remember. Was it always this suffocating?}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|C'mon now. Old grease and burnt rubber... The smells of home.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|This ain't my home. Not anymore.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Excellent. Let's head inside the hotel.}}

Enter the [[Incontinental Hotel]] and chat with [[Paks Topskimmer]]:

{{Dialogue|Welcome to The Incontinental. You got a reservation?

Ain't gonna matter, we're full.

{{buy|What do you have for sale?}}<br>
{{Gossip icon|inn|Make this inn your home.}}<br>
{{Gossip|quest=|<Hand over the coupon.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|Wow, and the coupon isn't even expired!

This hotel is the best of the best. It's centrally located, isn't full of nasty Darkfuse thugs, and we keep the croach population de-escalated.

Rooms are full, but hearthstones we got. D'ya need one?

{{gossip|No, another time.}}}}

{{gossip|You call this place The Incontintental?}}
{{dialogue-child|Yeah, duh. Incontinental. Like, inside the continent? Cuz we're underground? Get it?

{{gossip|You mean Intracontinental, right?}}

Oh.

<Paks stares off into the distance as a realization comes across his face.>

We just had the sign redone...}}}}

Paks also starts breadcrumbs [[Operation: Floodgate: Disposing of the Garbage]], [[Delves: Site of Madness]], and [[Delves: The Sluice Contains the Juice]], leading to [[Operation: Floodgate]] and [[Excavation Site 9]] in the [[Ringing Deeps]] and [[Sidestreet Sluice]] just outside the Incontinental.

Next speak with [[Gas Grimeshank]], who handles shipping and handling:
{{Dialogue|"Shipping and Handling" is the best of the best of the best when it comes to employers in Undermine.

And we're not Darkfuse affiliated! So you don't gotta sacrifice yer morals workin' for Gallywix.

{{Gossip|quest=|What sort of jobs does Shipping and Handling do?}}

The jobs are mostly delivery. Comes with a nice ride as a perk. If you make a name for yourself around Undermine, I'll be in touch.

{{Gossip|quest=|Got it.}}}}

Next, speak with [[Smaks Topskimmer]], the renown quartermaster for the [[Cartels of Undermine]]:
{{Dialogue|How's it going?

{{buy|Show me your wares.}}<br>
{{Gossip|quest=|I'm friends with some very important goblins!}}

You might be friendly with trade princes or cartels on the outside, but it's a whole different game down here. In Undermine, we all start at the bottom. But trust me, pal, it'll be worth it.

{{Gossip|Got it.}}<br>
{{Gossip|Show me your wares.}}}}

Finally talk with [[Kaydee Racketring]], the cartel recruiter who allows players to choose which faction to ally with for the week:
{{Dialogue|You lookin' for work?

Well, you're in the right place. Cartels here are always lookin' for temporary contractors for quick gigs.

I got all sorts of brochures, if you wanna peruse the benefit packages.

Also I may or may not be paid on commission. Apparently I'm legally required to add in that part. Whatever.

{{Gossip|quest=|Why do I want to choose a cartel to work for?}}

Why wouldn't you want to?

You get to make a name for yourself. and them trade princes won't ever forget what you've done for 'em.

{{Gossip|Got it.}}}}

After speaking with all four:
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Undermine is in a situation right now with [[Gallywix]] and the Darkfuse.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Good thing we are here to make a difference.}}
:''Grimla Fizzlecrank, Renzik and Gazlowe walk outside.''

On completion:
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Bilgewater has gotten it worse than the other cartels.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|I need to get to the Bilgewater. These Darkfuse have me worried.}}
