==Objectives==
Kill Dockmaster Skeez.
*[[Dockmaster Skeez]] slain. {{co|60.5|9.9|Undermine}}

==Description==
{{questportrait|Dockmaster Skeez.jpg|Dockmaster Skeez|Dockmaster Skeez commandeered the loading dock of the Port Authority. Another of Gallywix's dogs in need of a shallow grave.}}

A big lunk of a [[hobgoblin]], Skeez, took over the docks around the time that Gallywix had me thrown in the brig. He moved his Darkfuse in, and a lot of my Blackwater lads went missing. Captain took that personal, and so do I. Skeez thinks Gallywix will keep him safe.

Let's kill him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Noggenfogger Ultimate Deluxe]]
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Still in one piece, eh?

==Completion==
That's how we mete out justice, both at sea and in port. With the saber.

==Notes==
After accepting both quests:
:{{Text|Say|Fleet Master Seahorn|Darkfuse has been using us to bring in these shipments! It ends now!}}

Head to [[Castaway Cove]] and aggro Dockmaster Skeez:
:{{Text|Say|Dockmaster Skeez|This Boss Gallywix Black Blood.}}
:{{Text|Say|Fleet Master Seahorn|We'll be relievin' you of your cargo now!}}

Finish him off:
:{{Text|Say|Dockmaster Skeez|We are... supposed to... win...}}
:{{Text|Say|Fleet Master Seahorn|Handled, matey.}}

Speak to Fleet Master Seahorn to turn in both quests.
