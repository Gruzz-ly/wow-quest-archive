==Objectives==
Ride Pamsy's Rocketboard in the [[Writhing Fields]] and freeze the pipeline.
*Ride [[Pamsy's Rocketboard]]
*Freeze the pipes (12)

==Description==
Sounds like the old [[Black Blood]] pipes in the [[Ringing Deeps]] are thawing out, but we haven't figured out a solution for all the goo they're packed with just yet. A few more budgetary meetings, though, and we're on it.

In the meantime, we earmarked a little cash for some temp help. That's you.

Get out there and refreeze those pipes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Valorstones]] x42
*[[Weathered Undermine Crest]] x2
*[[The Cartels of Undermine Commendation]]
*[[Bilgewater Cartel Commendation]]

==Progress==
Try not to freeze any important bits off. We're not offering medical.

==Completion==
Cool.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.1.0|note=Added.}}
