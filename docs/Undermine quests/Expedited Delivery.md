Just the two people I wanted to see. We're up to our eyes in Black Blood over here.

==Notes==
Head to the [[Malfunctioning Cratemover]] that is nearby and interact with it:
:{{Text|Emote|Fleet Master Seahorn gives you a parting nod of respect.}}
:{{Text|Say|Jastor Gallywix|People of Undermine, return to your homes! There is no revolution!}}
:''The cratemover flies southwest to [[Venturewood]].''

At [[Venturewood]], it drops the adventurer off where [[Pamsy]] and [[Grimla Fizzlecrank]] are waiting:
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Undermine is drenched in Black Blood weapons. What's our solution here?}}
:''[[Orweyna]] swoops in and turns back to her haranir form''.
:{{Text|say|Orweyna|It has arrived. Well timed, <name>.}}

Pamsy has gossip:
{{Dialogue|Word's out on what [[Nikki the Fixer|Nikki]] did to [[Renzik]]. I came as soon as I heard.
