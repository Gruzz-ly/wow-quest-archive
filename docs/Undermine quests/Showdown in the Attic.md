==Objectives==
Rescue Pitz and destroy the G.O.L.E.M.
* Find [[Pitz Lowe|Pitz]]
* [[G.O.L.E.M.]] slain
* [[Pitz's Masterwork Invention]]

==Description==
I've been so blind! Everything's falling apart!

The neighborhood is worse off than ever, and the G.O.L.E.M.'s to blame! And my boy, my dear Pitz...

He ran into this building to try and stop the contraption. I was so hard on him, and now I might never see him again...

You gotta find him. And stop that thing once and for all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[G.O.L.E.M, Jr.]]
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]
* +200 reputation with [[Cartels of Undermine]] or 25x [[Resonance Crystals]]

==Progress==
My hubris... that's the first thing they tell you in inventor school! Why didn't I listen!

==Completion==
Y'know... he may not be much of an inventor, but I'm proud of that boy.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Old Man Lowe|Please just... find Pitz. Make sure he's okay.}}

Head in and upstairs to find Pitz lying on the floor:
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|Oof... that G.O.L.E.M.'s got some mits on 'em...}}

Speak with him:
{{dialogue|
<Pitz appears to be barely conscious.>

{{gossip|quest=|Pitz! Are you alright?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|I'll be okay... you gotta destroy the G.O.L.E.M.!}}
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|It's in the attic... use... my invention...}}
:''Pitz hands over [[Pitz's Masterwork Invention]].''

Head up to the attic and use the quest item on the G.O.L.E.M. to stun it for a moment, which also causes it to take +50% bonus damage. Finish it off, then return to ground level:
:{{text|say|Old Man Lowe|Pitz! You're safe!}}
:{{text|say|Old Man Lowe|You were so brave, running in there.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|I'm sorry about your G.O.L.E.M., Pops, I tried to fix it--}}
:{{text|say|Old Man Lowe|Forget the G.O.L.E.M., son. We didn't need it! You've been the one helping out the people this whole time.}}
:{{text|say|Old Man Lowe|I'm sorry it took me this long to see it.}}
:{{text|say|Vatworks Citizen|I love a happy ending.}}
:{{text|say|Vatworks Citizen|Neighborhood's still a wreck, you jerks!}}
:{{text|say|Vatworks Citizen|I love a happy ending.}}
:{{text|say|Gart Pocketz|Aww!}}
:{{text|say|"Cranky" Nan|I always liked that boy.}}
