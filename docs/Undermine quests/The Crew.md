==Objectives==
Gather the crew.
*[[Goldmine|Getaway Driver]] recruited
*[[Handsome Crog|Face Man]] recruited
*[[Ripsnoodle|Cousin]] recruited

==Description==
You are hired!

Okay, this heist I got planned is gonna make us a lot of money, but requires a crew and a bunch of planning.

I'll take care of the planning, you get the crew.

We need Goldmine. Outside of [[Venture Company|Venture Co.]], he's one of the fastest drivers out there. Because he's outside of Venture Co., he can't be traced back to me.

We also need a face that no bruiser can say no to. We need Handsome Crog.

Oh, and I need my cousin Ripsnoodle. He's not the best mage, but he's family... and my boss.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Okay, I know some of them may not come willingly. So, we got to tell them we're gonna get lotsa money outta this heist. Like... lots of money.

Because there is. Lotsa of money. I swear.

==Completion==
They came? Great!

I knew sending you would win them over! If they saw me, they might have remembered--

Well let's not focus on the past.

==Notes==
Find [[Pre-Expert Goldmine]] at the [[Vatworks]] who is fixing his hot rod.{{Co|41.6|65.2|Undermine}}.
{{Dialogue|I thought being in tune with the elements would mean I would have to pay LESS for gas.

There is just no winning.

:{{Text|Say|Pre-Expert Goldmine|Skedgit? Asked for me? By name?}}
:{{Text|Say|Pre-Expert Goldmine|It is the least I can do. I thought she still blamed me for [[Great Granny Cinderbangs|her Granny]] getting pinched by the Darkfuse.}}
:''Goldmine hops on to the Hot Rod and drives off.''

Head to [[Handsome Crog]] at the [[Incontinental Hotel]] who is surrounded by the [[Crogquette]]s.{{Co|43.8|51.0|Undermine}}

:{{Text|Emote|Handsome Crog silently smolders at you in acknowledgement.}}
:''Crog walks out, followed by the Crogquettes.''

Head to the [[Emerald Hills Golf Course]] where [[Ripsnoodle]] is there.{{co|65.2|59.6|Undermine}}
{{Dialogue|There is no niche or kitsch that Entrepreneur Inc. can't solve in a pinch!

Today we are caddies. Tomorrow? Who knows, but I am excited by the future!

:{{Text|Say|Ripsnoodle|Skedgit has a heist? Even after that incident with the worm poop? Let me wrap up here and I'll meet you back at HQ.}}

On return:
:{{text|say|Ripsnoodle|You want HIM to be our driver? After he got Granny pinched by the Fuse?}}
:{{text|say|Pre-Expert Goldmine|I keep trying to say I'm sorry. I didn't know a fire elemental would do that.}}
:{{text|say|Skedgit Cinderbangs|Quiet, you two. I need both of you. This is the big score.}}

They have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Ripsnoodle|Skedgit is promising this is the big score.

Now, she also promised that about that [[Delegated Dig|worm dung she had some poor sap dig up in Azj-Kahet]]. It did lead to a good chunk of change but not what I would call a huge score.

Still, this gig sounds like more fun than the golf course. We need some risk in our gigs if our little company is going to thrive under Venture Co.}}
{{dialogue|title=Pre-Expert Goldmine|Despite all of the bad water under the bridge Skedgit was still willing to reach out to me.

At least she knows who to turn to as a wheel gob.

There ain't nobody this side of the surface that can drive like me. And it isn't JUST because I shoved a windfury totem into my transaxle.}}
