==Objectives==
Meet [[Marty Zoomcart]] at [[Venturewood]] in [[Heaps (Undermine)|The Heaps]].

==Description==
Our first marks are the dynamite duo of gaming: [[Kayjay]] and [[Fantastic Davey]]. 

Been a few years since I was hustling macaroons in the electro-billiards halls. I wasn't bad, but those two cleaned the house out whenever they showed. They don't just win games either. They make them! Real artist-types, you know? 

But with great gaming, comes great debt. And it's usually to [[Venture Company|Venture Co.]] 

Meet me at the Heaps. If [[Rosebud Gallywix|Rosebud's]] death means they're outta work, I'd bet money Venture scooped 'em up again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
<Name>! You've got timing like a [[mechagnome]]. As in, clockwork.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|I have an errand to run, but I'll meet you at Venture Plaza in a bit. You got wheels, right?}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|It's my wife. She left her lunch at home, so I gotta drop it off to her at the weekly bridge game.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Sweetest woman you'll ever meet. Just the absolute sweetest. As long as she doesn't skip lunch.}}

On arrival in the Heaps:
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Yo! <Name>!}}
