<You come across a wanted poster that has been nailed on top of a for rent sign.>

* 1,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
That Moz is driving me crazy! Maybe you can talk some sense into him.

==Completion==
I didn't think anyone would actually show up. You here about the free room?

You didn't say nothin' to Barrelbottom, didja?

==Notes==
Travel to the [[Barrelbottom Apartments]] at {{co|40.2|72.4|Undermine}} in the [[Vatworks]], and head up to the second floor where Moz Barrelbottom is in a heated argument with [[Mama Keara]]:
:{{Text|Say|Mama Keara|You can't just keep raising the rent like this!}}
:{{Text|Say|Moz Barrelbottom|Hey, hey, protectin' you squatters ain't cheap. I gotta charge a premium!}}
:{{Text|Say|Mama Keara|What protection? You've let those bikers run rampant for weeks while tenants are going missing!}}
:{{Text|Say|Moz Barrelbottom|You don't like it? Leave! And I'll be keepin' your desposit, heheh.}}
:{{Text|Say|Mama Keara|This isn't over you leech!}}
:''Mama Keara starts heading up to the third floor.''
:{{Text|Say|Moz Barrelbottom|We'll see about that...}}

Mama has gossip:
{{dialogue|Don't let that swindler Moz convince you this is some kinda paradise. Just look around. The floor creaks, the roof leaks. There ain't even any doors in here! This place is a dump.

Unfortunately for most of us, it's also our only option.}}

Then check in with Moz:
{{Dialogue|You here to rent a room? Perfect timing!

Take a look around while I finish up. There should be a free spot here in a few minutes, heheh.

{{Gossip|quest=|<Ask about the help wanted sign.>}}

I don't know nothin' about that, but if you're here to cause trouble I suggest you leave.

We don't need no adventurers pokin' their nose in other goblin's business.}}

Head upstairs to turn in to Mama. Nearby, [["Gabby" Gabi]] has gossip:
{{dialogue|<Gabi smiles as you approach.>

{{gossip|Why do they call you "Gabby," Gabi?}}

<Gabi shrugs.>

{{gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}}}
