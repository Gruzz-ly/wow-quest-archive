==Objectives==
Calm the chaos caused by the [[G.O.L.E.M.]]
* G.O.L.E.M.'s chaos calmed (0/100%)

==Description==
The G.O.L.E.M.'s gone berserk! Haywire! Bonkers!

I gotta go chase it down--who knows what kinda trouble an invention that powerful could cause! Plus, imagine how mad my old man would be if we lost it!

I hate to ask you to clean up my messes, but someone's gotta hang back and get everything in order again. Could you do that?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
All this chaos... what has the G.O.L.E.M. wrought?!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|Clean up as best you can. I gotta go after the G.O.L.E.M.!}}
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|Oh, this is all my fault...}}

Before he runs off, Pitz has gossip:
{{dialogue|This is terrible, I'm no good at anything...}}

Fill the bar by:
* 3%: Slime killed, Trash burned
* 5%: Bullies defeated, Child saved, Citizen saved
* 10%: Big Bullies, Special Big Bully

At 100%:
:{{text|say|Old Man Lowe|My son! Has anyone seen my son?}}
:{{text|say|Gart Pocketz|He ran into that building, after your invention!}}
:{{text|say|"Cranky" Nan|This is all your fault, Lowe!}}

Catch up with Old Man Lowe, trapped by a bunch of angry Vatworks citizens.
