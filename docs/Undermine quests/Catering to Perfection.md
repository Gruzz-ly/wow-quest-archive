My perfect day needs the perfect food! I've been looking at things on [[Gobstagram]], and Chef Hardslice is my one and only choice for catering. [[Papa Kraz Torquewrench|Papa]] promised I'd have the best, and he's good to his word!

I need you to make sure that everything on my menu makes it to the table for picture perfection. Everyone needs to see how fabulous my wedding is.

Ahh! I am so excited! I can't wait to see Chef Hardslice's creations on my table at my wedding!

Isn't Chef Hardslice a genius?

==Completion==
My food is going to be the envy of everyone!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Neenee Torquewrench|Oh, I hope Chef makes his famous eel puffs! I can already taste them!}}
:{{text|say|Papa Kraz Torquewrench|He'll have those puffs if he knows what's good for him, Princess.}}

[[Chef Hardslice]] is just outside to the south:
:{{text|say|Chef Hardslice|We're almost at showtime, people! Remember to use salt and taste your food!}}

Speak with him:
{{dialogue|You ready to be amazed by some incredible goblin cookin'?

{{gossip|quest=|<Ask if the Chef needs any help.>}}

The supplier for meat for my eel puffs got electrocuted and had to bow out. My menu won't be perfect without eel puffs and that might mean I get my knees broken! 

Get me some meat so I can make the appetizer and keep my legs intact!}}

Head east to [[Blackwater Marina]] and defeat [[Marina Zapper]]s for their [[Electric Eel Meat]]. Collect the quota, then return to Hardslice:

{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|<Hand over the eel meat.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Chef Hardslice|Hey! You survived and you got my eel meat! You're a lifesaver, pal.}}
