==Objectives==
Meet the State of Undermine's assigned Public Defender.
*Retrieve the Smoldering Deed to the Gallagio
*Go to the Public Defender's Office in [[Hovel Hill]]
*Investigate the Public Defender (3)
* Dig through paperwork (5)

==Description==
He just... exploded...

If a goblin's gotta go, that's the way. All I can say for poor Rosey. And that I'm gonna miss him. AND that we're gonna find out who did this!

But the more immediate pickle is this: Who owns the Gallagio now?

It's time to turn to an expert on legal mumbo jumbo. The State of Undermine assigned a public defender to us for the court case tomorrow, a fella named Zoomcart. He's all we got.

Take what's left of the deed to his office in Hovel Hill, and sort this out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
I assure you, I'm usually drowning in my paperwork far more figuratively than I was a moment ago.

==Notes==
After picking up the deed:
:{{text|say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|That deed is barely more than a pile of ash.}}
:{{text|say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|It would certainly never hold up in court. What a tragedy...}}

Go to the [[Office of Lawyering]] and investigate the office at the top floor:
{{Dialogue|title=Family Photo|This is a framed family photo.

You glean from it that the state's agent probably has a family. Definitely a photo of one, at least!

{{Gossip|<Set the framed photo down.>}}
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Marty's Bookcase|There are numerous books. Several are on Goblin Lawyering, of course, but there are a significant amount of tomes on other races' legal practices. Human, Vulperan, Dwarven, Nerubian, Furbolg... The list goes on.

There's also one tome at the bottom titled, "How To Get Out of Parking Tickets More Than Once."

{{Gossip|<Step away from the bookshelf.>}}

{{Gossip|<Take the tome on Parking Tickets.>}}

{{Gossip|<Borrow the tome on Parking Tickets, promising to yourself you'll bring it back at a later date.>}}
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Lawyering Certification|This certifies that one Marty Zoomcart has successfully completed Undermine Commerce College's course in Lawyering.

{{Gossip|<Step away from the Certificate of Lawyering.>}}
}}

After the investigation you hear Marty under a giant pile of paperwork:
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Mhmm...}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|MMhmmm!}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|...Mmmhhm?}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Ah... A little help here?}}

After helping Marty out he says:
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Thanks for that! I was trying to get one of those little sticky notes at the bottom of the pile.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|So... What are you doing here?}}
