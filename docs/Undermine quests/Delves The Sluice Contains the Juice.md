Complete the [[Sidestreet Sluice]] delve on any difficulty.
* Dispose of the threat in the Sidestreet Sluice

==Description==
Buddy, pal, <class>. Some [[Darkfuse Enforcement|Darkfuse]] have taken root down in the sewers here in [[Undermine]]. They're shaking down hard-working goblins for cash, stealing their lunches, and sometimes even destroying their flamingo lawn ornaments!

Those Darkfuse suffer from a real lack of decorum, let me tell you.

I know you'll do the right thing and help us out, especially after such a tearjerker of a story.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|93|60|}}
* 24,400 [[XP]]
* 50x [[Valorstones]]
* +500 [[Cartels of Undermine]]

==Progress==
Did you kick out the Darkfuse yet?

==Completion==
Hey buddy, thanks for making sure that all flamingos around Undermine now feel safe out at night.

You're a real one.
