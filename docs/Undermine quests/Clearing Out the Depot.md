==Objectives==
Clear the depot area in the Heaps.
*Clear the Heaps Depot.

==Description==
[[Heaps (Undermine)|The Heaps]] are crawling with guards. We've got an opportunity to disrupt the [[Black Blood]] operation in [[Undermine]] and we should take it.

We can't stop all the [[Black Blood]] from getting around the city, but we can clear out some guards and smash some shipments. Mess them up enough to disrupt things. Every little bit helps.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Every guards{{sic}} or shipment lost costs them time and money. And [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] hates losing both.

==Completion==
That should slow the Black Blood business. Hopefully anyone expecting a shipment will have a real bad day.
