==Description==
I'm all set to make our case. Just one tiny, little, minor thing to let you know about...

There's a bomb under my desk here.

Don't be alarmed! It ain't the first time this has happened. But there's a lot of people here, and I'd hate to interrupt the plosive proceeding for one little explosive.

Take this X-Plo-Dar 64k. Use it to trace the bomb's signature back to the goblin with the trigger.

My lawyer's instinct is telling me that the culprit behind this explosive is also Rosebud's killer. Just a hunch.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Trigger-Sniffer's Greaves]]
* [[Trigger-Sniffer's Handwraps]]
* [[Trigger-Sniffer's Hood]]
* [[Trigger-Sniffer's Spaulders]] 

You will also receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
[[Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|Tarbonara]]? He's the bomber? ...Really?

Only reason I'm so surprised it because it felt too obvious!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|You find those bombs, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Meanwhile, I'll use my gob-given powers of vamping to stall for time.}}
:{{text|say|Judge Landro|Goblins to your podiums! Let's start this shindig before I get bored.}}
:{{text|say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank is ready and willing and respectfully humbled, ya honor.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|And Marty Zoomcart is ready. That's all, ya honor.}}

Upon defusing the first bomb:
:{{text|say|Judge Landro|So what's the deal with this casino?}}
:{{text|say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|Simple, Ya Honor. The owner is dead. It MUST be placed on our esteemed Auction House to be bid upon!}}
:{{text|say|Judge Landro|Yup. That's a pretty good argument.}}

Upon reaching the location of the second bomb near Gazlowe's Ma:
:{{text|say|Gazlowe's Ma|What? You flirtin' with me, or something?}}

Upon defusing the second bomb:
:{{text|say|Gazlowe's Ma|Oh, you're just defusing this bomb. Then nevermind.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Ya Honor, the Gallagio does, in fact, have an owner.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|In accordance with goblin property law, the Chief Officers of the deceased will accept their right as next of kin and retain ownership.}}
:{{text|say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|What?! That can't be real! It sounds completely made up!}}

Upon reaching the location of the third bomb near a [[Tarbo Pitwatcher]]:
:{{text|say|Tarbo Pitwatcher|Don't mess with that! It was a personal gift from Mister Tarbonara!}}

Upon defusing the third bomb:
:{{text|say|Judge Landro|It does sound made up. Is it made up?}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|It's real, Ya Honor. And if you'll allow me, I'd like to tell you the contextually relevant history of this law...}}
:{{text|say|Judge Landro|No. Stop. I don't need your whole life story, Shoecart.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|It's Zoomcart, Ya Honor. Public Defender Zoomcart.}}
:{{text|say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|This is absurd...}}

Triangulating the signal point to Tarbonara's location:
:{{text|say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|Hey. The judge won't pay attention to me if you're jumping all around like that.}}
:''The X-Plo-Dar 64k prints out the results.''
{{Dialogue|title=X-Plo-Dar 64k ENHANCE Results|That guy right there definitely did it.}}
:{{text|say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|I don't like how close you looking at my face, kid...}}
