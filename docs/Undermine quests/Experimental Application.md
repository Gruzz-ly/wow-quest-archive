==Objectives==
Test the Kaja'Containment Device on 8 Kaja'mite Crawlers in the [[Lucky Break Mines]].
* Elementals Shrunk (8)
* [[Agitated Kaja'crawler]] slain (6)
* [[Jazz's Shrink Ray]] (provided)

==Description==
<Jazz shoves the shrink ray into your hands.>

Only thing left to do is test the prototype, <name>. Try using it on the elementals! If it can work on those, it'll work on anything, probably. 

Don't expect the effects to last, though. It's only a first iteration! And keep contained to the mines. Just in case we need to bury any problems. 

Oh, don't give me that look. I built this originally to make spiders easier for my wife to handle. I promise, there's at least ONE functional failsafe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
So, uh, did it work? How much do I owe you in medical bills?

==Completion==
I knew it'd be fine! Perfectly safe to handle. 
 
<Jazz coughs.>
 
I'll name you on whatever patent I file, promise.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|I'll start writing up my report for HQ while you're kickin' butt! Meet me on the beach when you're done.}}
:''Jazz runs off.''

Enter the [[Lucky Break Mines]] and use [[Jazz's Shrink Ray]] on all kaja'mentals inside to reduce their max health and damage dealt by 50%.

==Progression==
