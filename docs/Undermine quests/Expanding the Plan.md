==Objectives==
[[File:Expanding the Plan.jpg|thumb|The gang preparing to send a rocketboard out]]

Ride the rocketboard and shoot the pipeline with ice.
*Ride [[Pamsy's Rocketboard]]
*Freeze the pipes (12)

==Description==
Here's the plan. If we just freeze the outside, it'll all melt in a bit and go back to normal. But we got [[Orweyna]]. She can target cracks and leaks in the pipes so the coolant can get inside and really muck things up.

Since you gathered all the canisters, I think you should get the honor of freezing the pipe solid.

[[Pamsy]] has a rocketboard, and you'll be able to dispense icy justice down upon the station's key areas. Follow Orweyna!

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Boreal Battleaxe]]
* [[Boreal Blade]]
* [[Boreal Glaive]]
* [[Boreal Rifle]]
* [[Boreal Shank]]
* [[Boreal Spear]]
* [[Boreal Spellstaff]]
* [[Boreal Spellsword]]
* [[Boreal Thumper]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Hop onto the rocketboard and shoot away!

==Completion==
Nice ice work! Ha!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Pamsy|The real effort begins now. Let's do it.}}
:''[[Monte Gazlowe]] and [[Renzik "The Shiv"]] run south.''

Before Orweyna flies off, she has gossip:
{{dialogue|I am prepared to cease the functioning of this horrible machine.}}

:{{text|say|Orweyna|I'll join you above, and scout the weak points in the pipe.}}
:''[[Orweyna]] shifts to bat form and flies off.''
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Loadin' up the chillburst canisters. C'mon!}}

The surviving characters of Pamsy's Crew have new gossip before hopping on the rocketboard:
{{dialogue|title=[[Glizza]]|Undermine is terrible, it felt like a great opportunity to get out of there to work here. But this is just as bad, with Darkfuse overseers like Gozzic.}}
{{dialogue|title=[[Keets]]|Let's get these canisters on board for you! Aim well.}}
{{dialogue|title=[[Razi]]|Shutting down this pump station will cause Gallywix problems for sure!}}

[[File:Expanding the Plan - bombing run.jpg|thumb|Orweyna and adventurer freezing the pipes.]]
Interact with the Rocketboard to begin riding on it.
:{{text|say|Orweyna|I can see weak spots in the pipeline. I will mark them.}}

For this on-rails bombing run, players have one vehicle ability: {{Abilities|Chillburst Toss|Freeze the weakened pipeline in ice.|icon=spell_frost_ice_shards|id=460668}}

Use the '''Chillburst Toss''' ability to freeze 12 marked pipe weaknesses. Once that's done, an [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|DgluRZ8cW_E|Expanding the Plan}}
:''The adventurer finishes off freezing the last pipe and returns to the Pump Station with Orweyna.''

Prior to completion but after the operation:
{{dialogue|title=Orweyna|I had a hard time trusting any of these Venture Company goblins, but they are growing on me.}}

On complete:
:{{Text|say|Monte Gazlowe|That mighta been more satisfying than a big explosion!}}

Several characters have new gossip after the quest:
{{dialogue|title=Monte Gazlowe|That was some good ice tossin' there.}}
{{dialogue|title=Keets|This is a small dent in the whole operation. What else can we do?}}
{{dialogue|title=Razi|Shutting down this pump station will cause Gallywix problems for sure!}}
{{dialogue|title=Renzik "The Shiv"|Undermine looms in our future.}}
