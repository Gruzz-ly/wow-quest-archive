==Objectives==
Slay 10 Darkfuse on the Kaja'Coast.
*[[Darkfuse Watchman|Darkfuse]] slain (10)

==Description==
There are too many Darkfuse guardin' this place for us to sneak around them. We're gonna have to thin 'em out the old fashioned way.

Take out as many Darkfuse as you can. Me and Gazlowe will do some reconnaissance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
That'll do for now. At least we've got some space to figure out a plan.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both A Little Insurance & [[Cut the Cameras]],
:{{Text|Say|[[Monte Gazlowe]]|You handle the security and the bird cameras. Renzik and me will scout ahead.}}
:Monte Gazlowe & Renzik "The Shiv" ran off.

Kill every [[Darkfuse Watchman|Darkfuse Watchmen]] in [[Kaja'Coast]].

Head to the nest where [[Gazlowe]] and [[Renzik]] are studying the destroyed B.I.R.D. to turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Looks like these are alarm bots, but they only signal a guard if one's close by.}}

During the PTR, the quest was named '''Blowing a Path Through'''.
