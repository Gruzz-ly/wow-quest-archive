==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Commissioner Kudd Milktooth.png|Commissioner Kudd Milktooth: Goblin Gaming & Fun Control Board|Commissioner Kudd Milktooth. AN individual of many pockets. As in, he was in Gallywix's pocket, but is now in Tarbonara's.}}
Collect Kayjay and Fantastic Davey's Debt Markers from Commissioner Kudd Milktooth.
* Collect Debt Markers from [[Kudd Milktooth]]
* [[Kayjay]] and [[Fantastic Davey]] freed

==Description==
Look. I know we're the ones that incurred our own debts, but [[Rosebud Gallywix|Rosebud]] believed in us! With him, there was a light at the end of the casino floor.

With him gone... We're just two halves of a gaming genius, working for hire instead of salary.

But [[Marty Zoomcart|Zoomcart]] told us there's still a chance we could work the [[Gallagio]]. Is that true? If it is, Davey and I are in.

Problem is that Davey and I's Debt Markers are held by the gaming commissioner himself: Kudd Milktooth. And he's deep in Tarby's pocket.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
You get the gaming duo outta there yet?

==Completion==
How much did you have to pay the get their debt markers?

Oh... Well then I guess we won't have to fill out reimbursement forms for you then!

==Notes==
On engaging Kudd:
:{{text|say|Commissioner Kudd Milktooth|Tarbonara hire me to smash bad employees!}}

On defeating Kudd:
:{{text|say|Commissioner Kudd Milktooth|Was maybe me... the bad employee?}}

Upon going back to Kayjay and Davey:
:{{text|say|Kayjay|INCREDIBLE! You brought Kudd down like an expired patent!}}
:{{text|say|Fantastic Davey|Can't wait to get outta here and smell that fresh, circulating Undermine air again!}}

Upon freeing them:
:{{text|say|Kayjay|FREED! YES! GALLAGIO HERE WE COME!}}
:{{text|say|Fantastic Davey|SMELL YA LATER, TARBO!}}
:{{text|say|Fantastic Davey|Although, it was nice to have all these people playtesting our work...}}
