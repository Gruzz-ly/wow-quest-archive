==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Kaja-Carrying Razormaw.png|Kaja-Carrying Razormaw|You'd be angry too if you had a rock in your stomach.}}
Retrieve the Swallowed Kaja'mite from the [[Kaja-Carrying Razormaw|Kaja' Carrying Razormaw]] on the [[Kaja'Coast]].
*[[Swallowed Kaja'mite]]

==Description==
So, my workers were supposed to be loadin' up some [[kaja'mite]] over in [[Zuldazar]], but apparently the transport got upended and a [[shark]] swallowed the whole crate.

I tried submittin' an insurance claim, but they ain't buyin' it. So we got no choice but to get that kaja'mite back ourselves.

Down for a little shark huntin'?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|820|7}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[The Cartels of Undermine Commendation]]
*[[Valorstones]] x12
*[[Weathered Undermine Crest]] x2
*[[Venture Co. Commendation]]

==Progress==
You think the shark might end up bein' able to talk? I kinda want a talkin' shark.

==Completion==
Good stuff, <name>. That's a whole lot less paperwork I gotta deal with now.

...You rinsed off that kaja'mite after you gutted the shark, right?

==Patch changes==
