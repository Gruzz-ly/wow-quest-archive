==Objectives==
Meet Gazlowe outside the [[Heaps (Undermine)|Heaps]].

==Description==
Venture doesn't exactly have a history of being an upstanding cartel. Their loyalties can be bought cheap, and they don't got qualms about means justifyin' ends.

We knew they was working with Gallywix, we just didn't know how deep they were in with him.

Let's go check out those kaja'mite supply lines. No time to lose.
==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Lots of Darkfuse, but less than they had back at Steamwheedle. Probably 'cause Venture's more compliant.

==Notes==

:{{Text|Say|[[Alleria Windrunner]]|I'll stay hidden and make sure of it.}}

Travel to the [[Heaps (Undermine)|Heaps]] where [[Monte Gazlowe]], [[Renzik "The Shiv"]], & [[Grimla Fizzlecrank]] are waiting.
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|This place is lousy with Darkfuse.}}

[[Renzik]] has a gossip:

[[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] don't have friends, just enemies he ain't turned on yet.}}
