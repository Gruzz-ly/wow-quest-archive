==Objectives==
Kill 12 Darkfuse at [[Tailgate Park]].
*Darkfuse slain (12)

==Description==
I'm not a violent gal by nature, but there are a lot of Darkfuse out there. They're already hassling the locals and they won't like you guys asking questions.

You wanna keep your friends safe? You wanna put the locals in better spirits? It'd probably be best if there were a whole lot less Darkfuse. If you catch my meaning.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
My meaning was, go kill a bunch of Darkfuse so they don't kill your friends. Can't a gal be subtle?

==Completion==
Nice work. The Bilgewater get to sleep a little easier, and maybe feel like they got a little payback for their [[Laslo Overbite|old boss]].

==Notes==
Kill  [[Darkfuse Enforcer]]s, [[Darkfuse Harasser]]s, [[Darkfuse Growler]]s & [[Darkfuse Oppressor]]s that are in the [[Tailgate Park]].
Once that's done, Meet back with [[Grimla Fizzlecrank]] accompanied by [[Gazlowe]] & [[Renzik "The Shiv"]] to turn in [[Morale Reflects Leadership]] & Attitude Adjustment.

With both quests completed, characters have new gossip:
