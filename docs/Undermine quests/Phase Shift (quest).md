'''Phase Shift''' is one of the two quests that begins the fourth chapter of the [[Undermine(d) campaign]]: "Breaking the Shackles".

==Objectives==
Destroy 4 [[Phase Resonance]] in the [[Vatworks]].
*[[Phase Resonance]] destroyed (4)

==Description==
As soon as the ethereals attacked, phase resonance tore open rifts throughout the area. The rifts are gone, but they can return while those resonances remain. That is how they call more soldiers and communicate with their commanders.

We need to destroy those resonances.

It may earn us the ire of whoever is behind this attack, but I gladly invite them to stop us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
The [[Dark Heart]] was in [[Undermine]] all this time. I should have known.

If the ethereals reach the Dark Heart before we do, all will be lost.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both [[Ethereal Invasion]] and Phase Shift:
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Hopefully that resonance will give us an idea of who's behind this attack.}}
:''Alleria accompanies the player for both quests.''

Head to the first [[Phase Resonance]] near the stairs and destroy it.
:{{Text|Say|[[Phase-Thief Azir]]|On my trail, are you? Hmm... I knew I could trust you to be diligent.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|That sounds like another [[Shadowguard]] ethereal. A minion of the Void.}}

Destroy the second Phase Resonance that is near the acid lake up in the hill.
:{{Text|Say|[[Phase-Thief Azir]]|Hmm heh heh he. We knew you would chase the [[Dark Heart]], and that we would have to take it first.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|What? The Dark Heart is in [[Undermine]]?}}

Head to the third Phase Resonance near the lab and destroy it.
:{{Text|Say|[[Phase-Thief Azir]]|[[Jastor Gallywix|The Goblin]] hid it well while it was repaired, but you all were so resourceful.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|They let us do the work for them.}}

Head to the last Phase Resonance near the pipe and destroy it.
:{{Text|Say|[[Phase-Thief Azir]]|The Dark Heart will be ours. You would be wise to forfeit your little pursuit.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|They do not know who they're dealing with.}}

Speak to [[Alleria Windrunner]] and turn in both quests.
