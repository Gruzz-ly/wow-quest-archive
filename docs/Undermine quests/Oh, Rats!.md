Okay, scout's honor this ain't a joke. I need help because...

I turned my best friend into a rat.

My friend Allie is the cook here. She tries her best but she's... no good. She's got a bum sniffer. So, I bought her a potion that would make her smell better!

...I mean, improve her sense of smell. But it turned her into a rat! Then she ran off!

Ya gotta find her for me. Dealer had another potion to understand rats. I'm too afraid to drink it though.

Can you use it an' find her?
