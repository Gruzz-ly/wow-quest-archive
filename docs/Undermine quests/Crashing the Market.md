==Objectives==
Destroy 5 [[Kaja'mite Stockpile]]s in the [[Lucky Break Mines]].
*[[Kaja'mite Stockpile]]s destroyed (5)

==Description==
When I left the Bilgewater Cartel in charge of the kaja'mite mining in Zuldazar, it was clean and safe. Well. cleaner and safer. We made a lot of deals with the Zandalari to secure that. So not only is Gallywix steppin' on our territory, but he's threatenin' the respect and trust we earned by letting Venture make a mess of this operation.

Blow up the kaja'mite stockpiles you find in that mine. I don't want any dishonest kaja'mite goin' anywhere, no matter who's buyin' or sellin'.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
When all this is done, [[Bilgewater]] will come back here, clean this up, and do it right.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both Crashing the Market & [[Asset Management]],
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Kaja'mite, Black Blood... There's gotta be a connection here.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Gallywix isn't making Kaja'Cola, that's for sure.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|He must know somethin' about kaja'mite that we don't.}}

Gazlowe has something to say:
{{Dialogue|A little fresh air at least.

{{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}

:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|It's good to finally get outta there.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Again with Undermine? What's your problem?}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Really? You gotta ask?}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Every day what I earned got stole. What I built got broke.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|In Undermine, every good idea was just chum in the water.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Every bad goblin crawled out of the woodwork and the bad guys would always win.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|I couldn't live like that. I had ta get out. You left too.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Yeah, the bad guys always won.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Huh. Got tired of the boot on your neck?}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|I got tired of the being the boot.}}

Go to the [[Lucky Break Mines]] and interact with the [[Kaja'mite Stockpile]]s to detonate them. Once that is done return to [[Monte Gazlowe]] and [[Renzik "The Shiv"]] to turn in Crashing the Market, [[Asset Management]], & [[A Miner Mistake]].
