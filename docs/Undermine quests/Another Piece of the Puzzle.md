==Objectives==
Discuss the contents of Zirdo's Ledger with [[Gazlowe]] in the Heaps.
* [[Zirdo's Ledger]] (provided)

==Description==
<The ledger has longwinded ramblings about [[Zirdo]]'s achievements, but also contains various deliveries of [[Black Blood]] across the Undermine. Multiple entries in the ledger stick out as odd:

One thousand units for Secret Project, Deliver to Secret Project Site.

Twenty units for Developmental Ammunition, Deliver via Courier.

Transfers approved by [[Marin Noggenfogger|Noggenfogger]] of [[Steamwheedle Cartel|Steamwheedle]].>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Noggenfogger knows better than to get mixed up with [[Gallywix]].

==Completion==
This is all too much.

==Notes==
While in the area for [[Clearing Out the Depot]] and [[Our Good Pal]], keep an eye out for the [[Zirdo's Ledger]], which starts this quest.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Zirdo|You get the delivery to the secret project site yesterday! And whatever's left goes to munition's testing.}}
:{{text|say|Zirdo|Where is Noggenfogger's Shipment? Don't you make me look bad in front of him.}}

Once done with the other quests, find Monte and he has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|You found a ledger that mentions [[Marin Noggenfogger|Noggenfogger]]? That...can't be right

{{Gossip|Who is Noggenfogger?}}
{{Dialogue-child|[[Marin Noggenfogger]]? He's the Baron of [[Gadgetzan]], and now Trade Prince of the [[Steamwheedle Cartel]].

Noggenfogger and me, we go way back. We joined up with Steamwheedle and left [[Undermine]] about the same time. I did more construction, and he did more alchemy. We kinda split ways when we landed in Kalimdor, but we was always friendly.

Well, he got a little pompous when he became a baron. But when he married Sprinkle, he got back to his old self. Me and him was even working on some ideas to make things better for the goblins who worked for our cartels.
