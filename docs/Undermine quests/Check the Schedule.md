==Objectives==
Gather 3 [[Employee Schedule]]s.
* [[Employee Schedule]] (3)

==Description==
If there's one thing Venture does keep in order, it's their paperwork. They're real particular with dividing their workforce and keepin' everything on schedule. They're efficient. I'll give 'em that.

Up ahead is one of their scrapyards. They should have schedules posted around the place for Venture employees to record their hours worked and see what they got comin' up.

Grab as many as you can find. We'll check out Venture's headquarters in the meantime.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
They should have schedules posted all over the place. Hopefully this isn't a wild flamingo chase.

==Completion==
<Gazlowe reads over the schedules quickly, his expression souring.>

Well, good news is [[Marin Noggenfogger|Noggenfogger]] wasn't lyin'.

Bad news is... this is a LOT of names. All gettin' sent to the [[Kaja' Coast]] in [[Zuldazar]].

==Notes==
;Upon accepting both Check the Schedule and [[It's Worth a Shot]]
:{{Text|Say|[[Grimla Fizzlecrank]]|Toss on this Venture uniform so they think you're an employee. Maybe you can talk some of 'em into quitting.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Renzik "The Shiv"]]|And grab the schedules posted around. We need to know where the workers are going and where the kaja'mite is coming from.}}
:''[[Monte Gazlowe]], Grimla, and Renzik leave.''

Head to the first [[Employee Schedule]] that resides in the building and take it out.
:{{Text|Say|[[Jastor Gallywix]]|Reminder to Venture employees: You skim ANYTHING off the top of those kaja'mite shipments and I'm skimmin' your HEAD off your shoulders.}}

There's a second [[Employee Schedule]] at the exterior on a wall and tear it down.
:{{Text|Say|Jastor Gallywix]|Another reminder: You lose your punch card for the Kaja' Coast and gettin' fired will be the LEAST of your worries.}}

Upon grabbing the last [[Employee Schedule]] which is at the pipe,
:{{Text|Say|Jastor Gallywix|ONE LAST REMINDER: You want one of the new weapons? You better be workin' LATE. You better be workin' HOLIDAYS. Ha! Slackers ain't gettin' promotions.}}

Meet up back with Monte, Renzik, and Grimla to turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|The foreman's guardin' the office. His weapons look... off. You know anything about 'em?}}
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Like anyone would tell me.}}
