[[File:Overly-Sealed Letter.jpg|thumb|The [[Overly-Sealed Letter]]]]

'''Diversified Investments''' starts from the [[Overly-Sealed Letter]] that appears on the table in the [[Incontinental Hotel]] after defeating [[Chrome King Gallywix]] for [[Liberation of Undermine: The House Loses]] in [[Liberation of Undermine]]. This unlocks the [[Darkfuse Solutions (faction)|Darkfuse Solutions]] cartel of [[Cartels of Undermine]], including the ability to summon the [[Darkfuse Precipitant]] rare enemy, and getting [[Market Research]] from activities across [[Undermine]].

==Objectives==
Find your prospective "business partner" and speak to them.
* Speak to your prospective "business partner"

==Description==
<The letter is simply addressed to "The <class> who took down Gallywix." It takes you a frustrating amount of time to rip open the multiple layers of duct tape sealing the envelope shut.>

Hey bud,

You've been gettin' a reputation for yourself. Not afraid to roll up your sleeves and get down to business. Certain people really value that kind of thing.

Let's talk shop. Meet me in my warehouse and maybe we can agree on a business partnership.

==Progress==
What do you want?

==Completion==
Lookin' forward to doin' business with ya.

==Notes==
At [[Hovel Hill]], enter the Sewer Grate at {{co|29.7|41.1|Undermine}} outside [[Sanitation Thrift]] to drop into yet another secret tunnel.

Speak with [[Sitch Lowdown]], the Darkfuse Solutions quartermaster:

{{dialogue|class=plainlist|Nice to see ya drop by, "champ."

*{{gossip|quest=|You're Darkfuse. Why am I talking to you?}}
*{{gossip|quest=|Explain yourself while you still have a head.}}
*{{gossip|quest=|You wanted to talk, so let's talk.}}

Listen, here's the skinny. Blackfuse, Darkfuse--we're tired of changin' our cartel's name and followin' around the next high-payin' bad guy. You keep killin' all of 'em. That ain't job security.

So we're findin' a new angle and rebrandin'. The new name is Darkfuse Solutions LLC.

What are we solvin', you might ask? Well, we don't know yet. We gotta do market research and figure out what product the people want. It's gonna be a lot of trial and error.

If you're willin' to do some research and test out our prototypes as we make 'em, I'd be more than happy to sell ya some of Darkfuse's overstock at a respectable discount.

So, you in?

*{{gossip|I'll consider it.}}

After completing the quest, he has new gossip:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|What angle is your cartel working on now?}}

We're startin' out with supplements. The drinkable kind, for the goblin on the go.

It's very important that we just call 'em "drinkable" for now. Technically anything's drinkable once. Any other word is gonna get us sued.

Chug a few bottles and lemme know if you feel like dyin' more or less than usual.}}
