==Objectives==
Rescue 8 Captured Tenants.
*[[Captured Tenant|Tenants]] rescued (8)

==Description==
<Gabi waves you over urgently.

The small goblin wrings her hands together nervously trying to find the words to explain her concern.>

Some goblins aren't moving out--they're being kidnapped. I know it.

My friends wouldn't have moved. They wouldn't.

<Gabi looks up at you imploringly with misty eyes.>

Please help, <class>. Please?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
What did that little goblin put you up to?

==Completion==
Everyone rescued. Only to be attacked again.

We can't let this stand, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept of both quests:
:{{text|emote|Gabi's eyes spill over with tears.}}
:{{text|say|[[Mama Keara]]|Hey hey, no cryin' now. <Name> will take care of this.}}
:{{text|emote|Gabi mutters something under her breath.}}
:{{text|say|Mama Keara|Nonsense. They're a big strong <class>. They probably won't die.}}
:{{text|say|Mama Keara|Probably.}}
:{{text|emote|Gabi shudders in horror.}}

Head to [[Venturewood]] and speak to the Captured Tenants:
{{Dialogue|I don't know why they're targeting us! They won't even let us leave!

{{gossip|You're safe now. Run while you can!}}
}}

While in the area, look out for the [[Weapons Cache (Undermine)|Weapons Cache]], which starts [[Weapons Cash]]. Once all tasks are done, return to [[Barrelbottom Apartments]] and turn all three quests. Mama has lost a fight and Gabi is nowhere to be seen:
{{dialogue|<Mama Keara is covered head to toe in injuries. Whoever attacked her made it personal.>

Don't worry about me, we need to stop whoever caused all of this!}}
