'''The G.O.L.E.M. of Progress''' begins the optional storyline of the same name for [[Sojourner of Undermine]], started by [[Old Man Lowe]] in the [[Vatworks]] of [[Undermine]], part of the [[Undermine(d) campaign]].

==Objectives==
Tour the [[Vatworks]] with the [[G.O.L.E.M.]] and solve problems for [[Gart Pocketz]], [["Cranky" Nan]], and the children of [[Undermine]].
* Gart's bullies deterred (3)
* Crates moved for "Cranky" Nan (7)
* Neighborhood children entertained (3)

==Description==
The citizens of Undermine cry out for help! They need protection! They need joy! They need to get by!

As an inventor, I've spent my life building somethin' that'll solve our people's problems, and it's just about ready for a test run. I'm calling it my Goblin Optimal Livability Enhancement Machine, or G.O.L.E.M. for short!

Find some problems and take it out for a spin- and take my son with you! [[Pitz Lowe|Pitz]] doesn't have an inventor's bone in his body, but certainly he can yak it up with the neighbors.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Pops is really over the moon about this G.O.L.E.M. thing. I hope it works out for him.

==Completion==
Well, it sure was great while it worked!

==Notes==
Before accepting, Old Man Lowe has gossip:
{{dialogue|As an inventor, it's my life's goal to make somethin' that'll really help people!

If only my son understood my vision. He means well, but he's too busy hanging around town and yapping.

{{gossip|What did Pitz do that you won't trust him with the G.O.L.E.M.?}}

It's not just one thing he did... it's everything!

He breaks every tool he touches! He leaves half-finished projects all over! He wouldn't know steel from sodium nitrate, no matter how many times I tell him not to blow up the workshop!

He's a good kid, he just needs to apply himself.

But this is too important to trust him with.

{{gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}}}

Before heading out, [[Pitz Lowe]], who is leaning against the wall, starts [[Garbage Day]].

On accept of both quests:
:{{text|say|Old Man Lowe|I'm trusting <name> to mind the G.O.L.E.M., Pitz. After what happened last time...}}
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|Yeah, yeah. I got it, Pops. I'll run ahead.}}
:''Pitz runs off.''
:{{text|emote|Old Man Lowe sighs.}}
:{{text|say|Old Man Lowe|Wish that boy had a sharper head on his shoulders. But what can you do?}}

Just outside is a [[Darkfuse Instigator]], shaking down [[Gart Pocketz]]:
{{dialogue|You need something? Can't you see I'm shaking this guy down for his lunch money over here?

{{gossip|quest=|The G.O.L.E.M. and I will stop you!}}}}
:{{text|say|Gart Pocketz|Pitz! Buddy! They're after my lunch money!}}
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|They're shakin' down Gart! The G.O.L.E.M. won't stand for this!}}
:{{text|say|Darkfuse Bully|These streets are for closers!}}
:{{text|say|Darkfuse Instigator|Get 'em, boys!}}
:{{text|say|Darkfuse Instigator|...uh, the robot's kinda big! Get the one next to it!}}
:{{text|say|Darkfuse Bully|Stupid... contraption!}}
:{{text|say|Darkfuse Bully|That robot's gonna pay!}}
:{{text|say|Darkfuse Bully|You're gonna regret... this...}}
:{{text|say|Darkfuse Instigator|You'll regret this! We'll be back, with bigger friends!}}
:{{text|say|Gart Pocketz|I woulda been toast without youse guys interfering! You always got your eye on things, Pitz.}}
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|Don't thank me, thank <name> and the G.O.L.E.M.}}

At the east end of the quest area, Pitz is standing near [[Joxle Jr.]], [[Lil' Zimmy]], and [[Trudy Tampblast]]. The kids have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Joxle Jr.|Pitz ate a bug once! It was cool...}}
{{dialogue|title=Lil' Zimmy|I'm shy! Not like Pitz, he's friends with everyone!}}
{{dialogue|title=Trudy Tampblast|Pitz always brings us candy...}}

Interact with the [[Rusty Slime Valve]] nearby and the G.O.L.E.M. will smash it, spewing some slime out of the pipe:
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|Huh, hope this stuff is safe.}}
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|Nah, the G.O.L.E.M. would never lead us astray!}}
:{{text|say|Trudy Tampblast|Hooray!}}
:{{text|say|Joxle Jr.|Best day ever!}}
:{{text|say|Lil' Zimmy|We love slime!}}
:{{text|say|Lil' Zimmy|Thank you, <name>!}}

At the northwest end of the area, Pitz is checking in with [["Cranky" Nan]]:
:{{text|say|"Cranky" Nan|No use helping with this one, Pitz. The shipment's too big!}}
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|Don't worry, ma'am! The G.O.L.E.M. will make quick work of it!}}
:{{text|say|"Cranky" Nan|G.O.L.E.M., eh? What will your crazy old man think of next?}}

Nan has gossip:
{{dialogue|I get more shipments of parts than these creaky joints can handle.

Pitz helps out where he can. Not very strong, but always tryin' his best.}}

Interact with the one crate and the G.O.L.E.M. will pick up the stack of six:
:{{text|say|"Cranky" Nan|Careful with that! Just bring it to my warehouse, over here.}}
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|I'll watch your shop, Ms. Cranky!}}
:''Nan points north.''
After moving the crates, Nan will say:
:{{text|say|"Cranky" Nan|Pitz, you wanna ask your old man if he can build one of those for me?.}}

Walk over with the G.O.L.E.M.:
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|Ah jeeps, the G.O.L.E.M.'s not looking so hot. Pops is gonna be so mad...}}
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|Wait! I bet I can fix him up and the old man will be none the wiser. Meet me at my workshop.}}

Catch up with Pitz to the east:
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|In here! This is where I do all my thinkin', out from under the old man.}}

He has gossip:
{{dialogue|We'll fix the G.O.L.E.M. up, good as new, and Pops will be none the wiser.

<Pitz laughs nervously.>

Right?

{{gossip|What are you good at if not inventing?}}

<Pitz sighs.>

I dunno, all I really like to do is go around town and chat with folks.

I keep trying to make this inventing thing work, though! I gotta make my old man proud!
