==Objectives==
Destroy the Black Blood stockpiles in the [[Heaps (Undermine)|Heaps]].
*North Stockpile destroyed {{co|57.1|79.9|Undermine}}
*South Stockpile destroyed {{co|55.6|80.4|Undermine}}
*West Stockpile destroyed {{co|57.6|82.0|Undermine}}
*[[Bloody Amalgam]] slain

==Description==
<Orweyna rubs her palms with dirt, then cracks her knuckles.>

Now, we teach those who toy with [[Black Blood]] nature's wrath. I am eager to call upon the roots twisting through [[Azeroth]].

Join me. Unleash nature's fury as we did before. Let us destroy their prized stockpiles of Black Blood.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I would not have guessed Orweyna was that much of a natural at dodging rockets.

==Completion==
Of course the spill became a giant monster. Well, at least you dealt with it. The less Black Blood they've got to fuel their weapons with, the better.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests before heading out.

On accept, Orweyna turns into a bat and flies off. 

Players have an extra action button for this quest:
:{{Abilities|Orweyna's Fury|Request Orweyna's assistance to assault the area.|icon=ability_creature_poison_04|id=473952}}

Destroy the first stockpile:
:{{Text|Yell|Orweyna|Feel the fury of the ancient roots!}}

Destroying the second::
:{{Text|Yell|Orweyna|Let this be finished!}}

After destroying the third, the [[Bloody Amalgam]] spawns. Finish it off, then head to [[Pamsy]] and Grimla Fizzlecrank to turn in both quests.

Upon completing both, Orweyna swoops in:
:{{Text|Emote|Orweyna dusts her hands off and then gives you an approving nod.}}

She has something to say:
{{Dialogue|You fight well, as always. I never imagined I'd rely on anyone outside of the haranir in the way I've come to rely on you and your companions.

But there can be no celebration until the Black Blood threatens Azeroth no more. We must press on.}}
