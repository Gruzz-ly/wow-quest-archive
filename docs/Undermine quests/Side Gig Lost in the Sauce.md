==Objectives==
Rescue 8 Lost Goblins from the Unseeming in the [[Writhing Fields]].
*Obtain 25+ stacks of Unseeming Shift
*[[Lost Goblin]]s rescued (8)

==Description==
Some of the workers forced by the [[Darkfuse Enforcement|Darkfuse]] to work the blood fields never made it home.

We've got reports that they might be lost in whatever the "Unseeming" is. Apparently it's got something to do with the big blood puddles?

Sounds like a job for someone more expendable--I mean experienced, than me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Coffer Key Shard]] x8
*[[Valorstones]] x9
*[[Weathered Undermine Crest]] x2
*[[The Cartels of Undermine Commendation]]
*[[Bilgewater Cartel Commendation]]

==Progress==
Any luck, champ?

==Completion==
Not bad, though they seem a few bolts short of a toolbox, if you know what I mean.

Gonna have to dock you a few gold for that one. Damaged goods and all.
