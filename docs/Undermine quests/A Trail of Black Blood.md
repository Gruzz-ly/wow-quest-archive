==Objectives==
Investigate Hovel Hill for Black Blood shipments.
*Investigate Hovel Hill 
*[[Ethereal Warning Letter]]
*Shipment Labels investigated
*Labeled Black Blood Shipment (3)

==Description==
While you have been getting familiar with the state of [[Undermine]], I have been tracking our prey. The presence of [[Black Blood]] is everywhere, hidden behind noisy distractions. 

But this city cannot fool me. I discovered a Black Blood shipment at a place called Hovel Hill, but there were machines guarding it. We should go together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Tracking the shipments should show us who's using 'em. Check out any labels or letters layin' around!

I think I stunned all of the defenses, they'll leave us be.

==Completion==
[[Baron Revilgaz]] is shipping [[Black Blood]] around the city? And he's paranoid about [[Ethereal]]s?!

I got questions, and he's got answers.
