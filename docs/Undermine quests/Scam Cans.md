'''Scam Cans''' begins the optional "Fore!" storyline for [[Sojourner of Undermine]] at the [[Emerald Hills Golf Course]] in southeastern [[Undermine]] alongside [[Can-Do-Caddy]].

==Objectives==
Extract 4 Scam Cans.
*[[Scam Can]]s removed (4)

==Description==
Look, I run a clean business here... when I'm paid to.

But, I've gotta swathe of cheatin' no gooders tryin' to plant scam cans in the holes. The things cause the balls of cheaters to get drawn into 'em, cheapenin' the game.

Can't have that. 

Get out there, find the scam cans, and get them gone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Yeah, gotta watch out for them explodin' balls. They make for a great sport but hazard pay is a real thing.

==Completion==
Great work! Honestly, whoever keeps making these is on my short list of people to use a rat polymorph spell on.

==Notes==
All over the [[Emerald Hills Golf Course]], slay 9 coursehare [[virmen]] that are infesting the area and interact with the four Scam Cans on the greens.

==Progression==
{{Fore!}}
