==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank.jpg|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|Cousin to [[Grimla Fizzlecrank|Grimla]]. Trade prince hopeful. Murderer of [[Rosebud Gallywix|Rosebud]]. Treasurer of the Jastor Gallywix Classy Club for Classy Wixys.}}
Defeat [[Tarbonara Fizzlecrank]], and ensure [[Judge Landro]] notarizes the new Gallagio deed.
*Present the Murder Evidence
*Expose Tarbonara
*Tarbonara Fizzlecrank defeated
*Judge Landro rescued
*Ruling notarized

==Description==
You've got us the hard evidence we needed. All that's left to do is reveal Rosebud's killer to the judge.

I imagine Tarbonara won't go down lightly, so be prepared for one of any number of goblin-like reactions.

You know what I mean. Explosions or cannons or crying or casino heists or whatever. I'm not worried though, you seem capable.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}
*1,400 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I had a feeling this would be a great case.

==Completion==
What did I say? I said to be prepared for a goblin-like reaction. And, oh boy, did we get one.

As you can see, everyone followed [[Monte Gazlowe|Gazlowe]] into scuffling with Tarbonara's goons. We did pretty good, yeah?

Myself? I'm heading to the [[Gallagio]]'s entrance. The new deed holders are all up there, and I want to wish them well before you and I are both promoted from lawyers to customers.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Ya honor. We've just come into evidence that Rosebud Gallywix's murderer is present in court today!}}
:{{text|say|Judge Landro|That's not really what today's proceeding is about...}}
:{{text|say|Judge Landro|But mid-climax twists are my guilty pleasure! Gimme that evidence!}}

Upon presenting the evidence:
:{{text|say|Judge Landro|Is this evidence? It looks like a plunger.}}
:{{text|say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|Ya honor, it's obvious! The murderer can be none other than... <name>!}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|No, Tarbonara. It's you. You're the murderer.}}
:{{text|say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|GASP! Fine. Wow. You caught me.}}
:{{text|say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|It won't matter though because I'm blowing you all to Tazavesh! PLAN B!}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|He also planted bomb crabs around the court, ya honor. <name> has defused those.}}
:{{text|say|Judge Landro|I don't like your suspicious "plan" talk, Mister Fizzlecrank!}}
:{{text|yell|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|BLAST! SKIP TO PLAN F, GOONS!}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|GET TO THE CAR, KIDS!}}
:{{text|say|Judge Landro|Hey! What are you--AAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|THIS COURTROOM BRAWL IS FOR VETERAN LAWYERERS ONLY!}}
:{{text|yell|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|The judge can't notarize your deed if there is no judge!}}

Upon engaging Tarbonara:
:{{text|say|Tarbonator Exploder 5000|EVERYONE WATCH! I WILL DEFEAT <NAME> AND GET WHAT I WANT BY USING OVERWHELMING WEALTH!}}

Upon defeating Tarbonara:
:{{text|yell|Tarbonator Exploder 5000|NOOOOOOOOOO!}}
:{{text|say|Judge Landro|Ugh... I can't move. Just carry me to my desk.}}
:{{text|say|Judge Landro|Ack! My bones!}}
:{{text|say|Judge Landro|I'm still hurtin' . Move my hand to the deed for me, "champion."}}
:{{text|say|Judge Landro|There ya go. Sorry about the blood, I guess.}}
