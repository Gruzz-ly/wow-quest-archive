==Objectives==
Collect 6 Stinging Residue from Acidic Salvage in The [[Vatworks]].
*[[Stinging Residue]] (6)

==Description==
[[Senior Slimediver Boxenkle|Boxenkle]] is my boss--and my mentor. Best slimediver there ever was! Until now....

It's not him--slimediving isn't what it used to be! The slimes have gotten more toxic over time.

I think it's gotten so bad that we all should be wearin' eye protection--not just me. But ol' Enkle's a traditionalist. It'll take more than a few red eyes to convince him.

That's where you come in. If you can get residue samples from the really nasty slimes, maybe I can make a compelling case for ol' Enkle!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Have you found enough residue from the oozing salvage?

Make sure to get the really nasty stuff. You know, the stuff that sticks to you but also melts your skin?

==Completion==
That's it! That's the stuff!

Maybe Enkle will listen to me this time...

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Senior Slimediver Boxenkle|Listen, Kazzandra. I've never needed goggles before and I don't need 'em now!}}
:{{text|say|Slimediver Kazzandra|We all need goggles, Enkle! The slimes ain't safe no more!}}

{{Dialogue|title=Slimediver Kazzandra|Boxenkle can't keep slimediving like this. His eyes are gonna melt outta his skull.

The whole team'll go blind if I don't do something!

If only I could prove to ol' Enkle my goggles make me a better slimediver.

{{Gossip|Who is Boxenkle?}}

{{Dialogue-child|Boxenkle? He's my mentor and the senior slimediver on our team. We like to call him ol' Enkle.

He's the best! The best at slimediving, that is. I grew up watching him work! He was the fastest slimediver around.

Get this--he hadda signature move: the Intestinal Cyclone! He'd dive in and punch a slime's insides until they were gooey. Then he'd spin around inside it until the slime collapsed!

He says he's too old for it now. I think he can't tell where he's already punched, so he just punches in the same place.

If he'd just wear goggles, he wouldn't have that problem!}}

{{Gossip|How do you know the goggles help you slimedive?}}

{{Dialogue-child|Because I'm not going blind and everyone else on the team is.

Which is funny, 'cause I'm blind without 'em... I've always hadda wear 'em--even as a little goblette.

When I started working here, everyone was way better than me at slimediving. But I worked hard an' started holdin' my own.

And then... everyone started to get worse! They got slower. They started missin' work. Their eyes were always red and... icky.

I have a theory. I think the acidity of the slimes has gotten real bad in a short amount of time. It's eatin' up their eyes. 

I keep tellin' them they need goggles, but Enkle's very old school...}}

{{Dialogue|title=Senior Slimediver Boxenkle|You're not getting roped into Kazzandra's goggles agenda, are you?

She may have needed 'em her whole life, but that doesn't mean they'll help us. We don't need 'em.

{{Gossip|Is your nickname really "Enkle"?}}

{{Dialogue-child|Yeah, it is. Parents called me Box growing up. I tried the full name for a while, but it didn't stick. Kinda how things go with nicknames.

Besides, ankles are what you grab to pull someone out of a slime.}}
}}

After picking up both quests:
:{{text|say|Slimediver Kazzandra|Enkle, wouldya at least TRY the goggles once? I want you to be safe!}}
:{{text|say|Senior Slimediver Boxenkle|Why're you worried about safety? I thought you were a real slimediver, Kazzandra.}}
:{{text|say|Senior Slimediver Boxenkle|We live for the cuts, scrapes, burns, and bruises! An' I can see fine, thank you.}}

All over the [[Vatworks]], slay the [[Acidic Salvage]]s that are in the area and loot six [[Stinging Residue]]s. Then go to [[Slimediver Kazzandra]] to turn both quests in. On complete of both:
:{{Text|Say|Slimediver Kazzandra|Enkle, this residue from the slimes has high levels of XTR-31. It's nearly all acid!}}
:{{Text|Say|Slimediver Kazzandra|Everyone needs to wear goggles--includin' you.}}
:{{Text|Say|Senior Slimediver Boxenkle|You're all gangin' up on me for no reason! We've never needed goggles to do our jobs. And I'll prove it!}}
:{{Text|Say|Senior Slimediver Boxenkle|[[Causticaria]] is mine!}}
:''Senior Slimediver Boxenkle runs off''
:{{Text|Say|[[Senior Slimediver Glinkee]]|The motherlode slime? Well, he's not coming to work tomorrow.}}
:{{Text|Say|Slimediver Kazzandra|Enkle, wait!}}
