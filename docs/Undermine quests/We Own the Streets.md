==Objectives==
Rally the people of Undermine against [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]].
*Rabble Roused (0/100%)
*Gallywix Statue Demolished

==Description==
The trade princes ain't exactly been fair to the goblins here, so this can't be just another cartel war. The crowd needs to know they ain't fighting for [[Bilgewater Cartel|Bilgewater]] or [[Steamwheedle Cartel|Steamwheedle]]. 

They're fightin' for [[Undermine]]. 

We need someone who ain't a cartel big shot to help rile 'em up and keep 'em safe. Do whatever it takes to get them to the [[Gallagio]] and show these goblins this is their city.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Legguards of the Undermine Revolutionary]]
*[[Boots of the Undermine Revolutionary]]
*[[Chainmail of the Undermine Revolutionary]]
*[[Headgear of the Undermine Revolutionary]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Gallywix doesn't own these streets. We do. After this, he'll never forget it.

==Notes==
On accept, the named characters start walking north along with the rebellious citizens.

Fill the bar by taking out the [[Abandoned Strike Breaker]]s (6%), rallying the [[Uncertain Citizen]]s (8%), flexing for [[Jesty Yellapapers]] (20%), dispersing the [[Darkfuse Crowd Gasser]], & rallying the [[Loudly Concerned Citizen]]s.

Approach [[Marin Noggenfogger]] and Monte Gazlowe:
:{{Text|Say|Marin Noggenfogger|I can't believe my eyes! Undermine is rising up! You pulled it off, Monte!}}
:''Monte Gazlowe continues to march''
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|I didn't do this. The people did.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|This city deserves better. Renzik knew it all along. We'll build it, once Gallywix gets out of the way.}}

Marin has gossip:
{{dialogue|Yo! You seein' this? Undermine's a-changing! 

Gazlowe was right all along. There's a new way waiting for us. We just gotta build it!}}

Upon approaching [[Jesty Yellapapers]],
:{{Text|Say|Jesty Yellapapers|Yo, big shot! Mug for the camera a bit, will ya?}}

Use the ability: {{Abilities|Flex!|Flex for the camera!|id=463533|icon=achievement_halloween_smiley_01}}
:{{Text|Say|Jesty Yellapapers|That's right! Let 'em see that we ain't letting them push us around no more!}}

[[Grimla Fizzlecrank]] has gossip:
{{Dialogue|I want more for the Venture Company. But we can't make it real with Nikki still in the picture.

If there's a gob for the job, it's Monte. Gazlowe. And of course, his industrious associate named <Name>.

<Grimla smiles and then tilts her head down towards the Gallagio.>

Let's get her, champ.}}

[[Orweyna]] has gossip:
{{Dialogue|Despite this place, its people teem with hope and liveliness. These strangers fill me with a fond feeling. Their decor, though...

<Orweyna glances over her should at the fake tree, annoyed.>}}

At 100%:
:{{Text|Say|Jastor Gallywix|They're marchin' on the Gallagio! Do something. [[Nikki the Fixer|Nikki]]!}}

Head to the Gallywix Statue and interact with the [[Riot-Grade Rope Coil]].
:{{Text|Say|[[Sprinkle Noggenfogger]]|Heave! Back up and pull it down!}}

Pull back on the rope and a [[The War Within in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|iX3LF1Jl3yQ|Jastor's statue falls}}
:''The [[adventurer]] pulls the rope that was tied to the statue with the other goblins.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Rebellious Citizen|No more Gallywix!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Rebellious Citizen|Bring it down!}}
:''The Gallywix statue begins to crumble down into pieces. The Adventurer cheers as the Goblins cheered as well.''

On the other side of the cutscene, [[Carlo Greasegrind]] & the [[S.C.R.A.P. Bot]] begin to tear down the hat of the statue. Head to [[Public Parking]], where Monte Gazlowe, Grimla Fizzlecrank, [[Pamsy]], [[Baron Revilgaz]], & Marin Noggenfogger are staring down Nikki the Fixer and the other Darkfuse defenders.
