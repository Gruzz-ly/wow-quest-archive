==Objectives==
Spread the hype and gather a crowd for the [[Cellar Gnomes]].
* Gather a Crowd

==Description==
Can't believe [[Baron Revilgaz|Revilgaz]] scheduled us first! No one shows up for the first band!

Whatever. You the one that oldhair [[Marty Zoomcart|Marty]] mentioned? He already gave me the lowdown on your plan to keep the [[Gallagio]] from going to auction. Seems ridiculous. Which makes it our kinda plan.

Let's make a deal. Our manager dumped us when the casino deal went south, so YOU are gonna fill in for her today. Don't worry, couldn't be worse than any other job you've done

First thing on your list: gather us a crowd.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Great job, boss. You brought in a crowd, and then some.

Second thing on our list... You know how to play an instrument right?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Chancellor Gnome|You better hype the hellscream outta us, <name>!}}
:{{text|say|Chancellor Gnome|Ain't no one gonna want us back at the Gallagio if we can't bring in a crowd!}}
:{{text|say|Chancellor Gnome|Gnomes! Let's crumble that stage with our sound!}}

After hyping them up [[Marina Visitor]]s say one of the following lines:

*{{text|say|Marina Visitor|Oh, I knew about them before they were big.}}
*{{text|say|Marina Visitor|Outta my way, shoobies!}}
*{{text|say|Marina Visitor|REAL gnomes? Here?!}}
*{{text|say|Marina Visitor|THEY'RE PLAYING RIGHT NOW?!?}}

Meanwhile, nearby [[Crank Zenata Impersonator]]s, [[Gelvis Impersonator]]s and [[Azure Gob Collective]]s will take notice and attack saying:
:{{text|say|Hey! I was yelling at those fans first!}}

Upon meeting with Chancelor Gnome in the [[Plunder Party]]:
:{{text|say|Chancellor Gnome|HOT MACAROONS! LOOK AT THAT CROWD!}}

==Progression==
{{Hard Ways at the Gallagio}}
