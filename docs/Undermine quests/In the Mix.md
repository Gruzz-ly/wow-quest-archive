==Objectives==
Speak to [[Marin Noggenfogger]] at the [[Vatworks]].
*Find Noggenfogger in the Vatworks
*Ask Noggenfogger to say more

==Description==
I don't like thinkin' that Noggenfogger's part of this, but the only way we'll know is if we go and talk to him.

Steamwheedle's headquarters is probably a good place to start lookin' for him.

We'll give him a chance to explain himself. If it's a misunderstanding, or he's just gotten himself into trouble. I need to know.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
You see how many Darkfuse they've got here?

==Completion==
<Gazlowe lowers his voice.>

They've got this place crawlin' with Darkfuse. Noggenfogger's bein' watched. Closely.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Noggenrogger's one of the good guys. There has to be a reason he's in on this.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Alleria Windrunner]]|I'll trust you know where his loyalties lie. Let's go.}}

Head into [[Steamwheedle Laboratories]] where [[Gazlowe]], [[Renzik "The Shiv"]], [[Grimla Fizzlecrank]], and Alleria came to [[Marin Noggenfogger]].
:{{Text|Say|Marin Noggenfogger|Gazlowe! Great to see ya. Uh--All the way down in Undermine. Why, uh--Why are you here?}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|You know why.}}

The present characters have gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Allerian Windrunner|
I recall seeing Noggenfogger aiding the survivors at [[Dalaran]].

Whatever his involvement is here in [[Undermine]], it has come to a head quickly.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Renzik "The Shiv"|
Keep your voice down.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Grimla Fizzlecrank|
It's way too tense in here.}}

Speak to Marin:
{{Dialogue|So nice of you to visit me for unsuspicious and totally legitimate purposes.

<He nervously eyes the Darkfuse guards standing nearby.>

{{Gossip|quest=|What do you know about [[Black Blood]]?}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Marin Noggenfogger|I can't talk. They'll know.}}
:{{Text|Say|Marin Noggenfogger|That, uh--you're visitin' me on my birthday! Hah.}}
