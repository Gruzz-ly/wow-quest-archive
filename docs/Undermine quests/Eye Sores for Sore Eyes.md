==Objectives==
Burn 8 [[Darkfuse Recruitment Poster]]s on and around Revilgaz's house.
*[[Darkfuse Recruitment Poster]]s burned (8)

==Description==
They call them recruitment posters, but that ain't all they're for. They're there to remind everyone the Darkfuse are in charge and can do whatever they want. If me or one of the locals rip 'em down. It goes bad for us.

But the Darkfuse hate you anyway.

If you torched all the posters, I would owe you one.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Desperate Goblin's Spaulders]]
* [[Desperate Goblin's Gloves]]
* [[Desperate Goblin's Belt]]
* [[Desperate Goblin's Boots]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
It may not keep Darkfuse out, but at least Hovel Hill is a little nicer without that Darkfuse garbage on the walls.

Like I said, I owe ya one.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both Eye Sores for Sore Eyes and [[Not Again!]];
:{{Text|Say|[[Monte Gazlowe]]|[[Renzik]] and I'll stay with Revilgaz. We got catching up to do.}}
:{{Text|Say|Baron Revilgaz|Everyone here works for a bigger fish, and ya can't just spill secrets.}}
:{{Text|Say|Baron Revilgaz|Smuggler - smugglee confidentiality, yeah? Loose lips sink ships.}}
:{{Text|Say|Baron Revilgaz|Like I couldn't, for old times sake, tell ya that I just leave the stuff at a depot in the [[Heaps (Undermine)|Heaps]].}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Renzik "The Shiv"]]|And we wouldn't ask.}}

Interact with 8 [[Darkfuse Recruitment Poster]]s and burn them to ash. Once finishing the posters, return to [[Baron Revilgaz]] and turn in both quests.
