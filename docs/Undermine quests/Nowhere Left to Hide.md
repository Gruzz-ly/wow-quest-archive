==Objectives==
Destroy the Makeshift Barricade, then follow Gazlowe into The Hoardroom to confront Gallywix.
*Light the Improvised Explosives (3)
*Gallywix confronted.
*Hold off Gallywix's riotguards

==Description==
That barricade looks intentional. [[Hobart Grapplehammer|Hobart]] said Gallywix had a panic room, and I'd say this sure looks like one.

[[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] has to have the [[Dark Heart]] in there. Blast this barricade and get ready to fight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
<Gazlowe exhales heavily, glowering back at the smoking teleporter.>

This is over. Let's leave.

==Notes==
Upon accept, Monte Gazlowe planted the [[Improvised Explosive]]s and backs off.
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|You wanna do us the honors, <name>?}}

Interact with the 3 Improvised Explosives. Once they are activated they blow up the makeshift barricade.
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Let's go!}} 
Gazlowe & [[Renzik "The Shiv"]] begins heading to the [[Hoardroom]]. Follow them and ran into [[Jastor Gallywix]] who is holding the [[Dark Heart]].
:{{Text|Yell|Jastor Gallywix|Security! Deal with these idiots!}}
The [[Ultra-Deluxe Riotguard]]s appear to defend Gallywix. You must confront the guards and take them out. Upon defeating them, an [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cinematic]] plays, "Dark Heart Stolen":

:''The [[adventurer]], Gazlowe and Renzik looks at Gallywix as he chuckled.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|You're too late, Gazlowe-buddy.}}
:''Gallywix lifts the Dark Heart on his right hand.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|You'll never beat me to a good deal!}}
:''He looks at the Dark Heart and from behind, [[Phase-Thief Azir]] appears.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Monte Gazlowe|Gallywix!}}
:''Phase-Thief Azir lifts Gallywix into suspended animation as he grunts in surprise. He turns him around.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Oh, uh...}}
:''The Phase Thief takes the Dark Heart from Gallywix's hand.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|I was just about to send that on to [[Xal'atath]].}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Repair work's all finished.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Not holding out or nothing, I swear.}}
:''Azir leaves and Gallywix was let go and dropped into the ground.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Monte Gazlowe|Whatever Xal'atath promised you, Gallywix...}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Monte Gazlowe|...it ain't worth it.}}
:''Gallywix picks back up as he groans in frustration.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|I'll remember this.}}
:''Gallywix activates the teleporter.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|This is my town.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|And when I come back, I'm gonna bury you under it!}}
:''Gallywix then teleported away as the teleporter is destroyed.''
:On the other side of the cutscene, Alleria Windrunner runs into the Hoardroom.
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Damn it! I only lost track of the ethereal for a moment, and that was enough.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|They're gone. Gallywix always has a way out.}}
