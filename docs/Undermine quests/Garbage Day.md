==Objectives==
Collect 12 pieces of litter and use the [[G.O.L.E.M.]]'s incinerator function to dispose of them.
* Garbage disposed (12)

==Description==
My old man's got all these crazy ideas about helping the world... I dunno. It's all a bit over my head, but I guess that's why I was never the inventor he wanted me to be.

Still, I've got some thoughts on how to solve problems around here. Like those dang rodents getting litter all over the streets!

It might not revitalize the spirit of the community or whatever, but I bet people would be happier if we cleaned up the streets.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Toxic fumes? Nah, that's just what Undermine smells like!

==Completion==
The place is looking cleaner already! Maybe there's something to this G.O.L.E.M. thing.

==Notes==
On accept of both quests:
:{{text|say|Old Man Lowe|I'm trusting <name> to mind the G.O.L.E.M., Pitz. After what happened last time...}}
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|Yeah, yeah. I got it, Pops. I'll run ahead.}}
:''Pitz runs off.''
:{{text|emote|Old Man Lowe sighs.}}
:{{text|say|Old Man Lowe|Wish that boy had a sharper head on his shoulders. But what can you do?}}

Look for [[Trash Pile (Undermine)|Trash Piles]] and [[Litter Nibbler]]s. They will turn up any of:
*[[Last Week's Undermine Inquirer]]
*[[Dented Can of Kaja'Cola (quest item)]]
*[[Banana Peel (quest item)]]

Use the items to feed them to the G.O.L.E.M. Once done with both quests, catch up with Pitz to the east:
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|Wait! I bet I can fix him up and the old man will be none the wiser. Meet me at my workshop.}}
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|In here! This is where I do all my thinkin', out from under the old man.}}

He has gossip:
{{dialogue|We'll fix the G.O.L.E.M. up, good as new, and Pops will be none the wiser.

<Pitz laughs nervously.>

Right?

{{gossip|What are you good at if not inventing?}}

<Pitz sighs.>

I dunno, all I really like to do is go around town and chat with folks.

I keep trying to make this inventing thing work, though! I gotta make my old man proud!

{{gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}}}
