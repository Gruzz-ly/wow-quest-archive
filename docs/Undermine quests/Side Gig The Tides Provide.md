==Objectives==
Collect 5 Shiny Treasures along the [[Kaja'Coast]].
*[[Shiny Treasure]] (5)

==Description==
You look like the type who ain't shy to get your hands dirty. Up for a little treasure hunting?

Word has it that a ship exploded not far off the Kaja'Coast. Go to shore and see what the tide's brought in.

"Finders keepers" is one of the foundational tenets of [[goblin]] society, after all.

*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[The Cartels of Undermine Commendation]]
*[[Valorstones]] x47
*[[Weathered Undermine Crest]] x2
*[[Blackwater Cartel Commendation]]

==Progress==
Gotta bring your own shovel. I never supply nothin', that's a liability waitin' to happen.

==Completion==
A fine haul!

Don't worry, I'll get you a share of the loot.
