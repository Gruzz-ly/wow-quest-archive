==Objectives==
Go to the pump station and meet [[Pamsy]].
*Meet Pamsy at the pump station in the [[Writhing Fields]]

==Description==
I got a team of engineers. All of them got families. They keep having horrible accidents and infections from the [[Black Blood]]. I just couldn't stand another death. I opened the wall. I wanted it to bring us some hope.

You show up and want to stop the Black Blood. It doesn't do anythin' good to stop these pipes up here. We gotta get to the pump station.

So, my crew and the pumps? They're all at the same station. But we should hurry.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
I can't believe it. [[Zirdo]] must have told [[Gozzic Cogcrane|Overseer Gozzic]] about me. This is a clear message to stop...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Pamsy|Help me save my folks from the Darkfuse and this job, and I'll help you shut it all down.}}
:{{text|say|Orweyna|We are aligned in purpose.}}
:''Pansy, Orwenya, and Monte walk out of the cave.''

Catch up with them in [[Writhing Fields]] where Pansy is mourning the deaths of [[Evbert]], [[Wikky]], and [[Grotee]]:
:{{Text|Say|Pamsy|My engineers! I thought... if I just got them out of [[Undermine]]...}}

{{Dialogue|title=Orweyna|The sickness of this area is giving me a horrible headache, but this is no time to focus on that.}}
