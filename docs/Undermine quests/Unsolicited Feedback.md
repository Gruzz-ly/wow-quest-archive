==Objectives==
Serve food to the hungry patrons.
*[[Hungry Customer|Patrons]] served (5)

==Description==
[[Alice Grillspark|Alice]] is back, and she's a much better cook than she ever was before she became a <whispers> rat.

But don't take my word for it. Here, hand out some food and hear it straight from the customers!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Spotty]]
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]
* +100 reputation with [[Cartels of Undermine]]

==Progress==
Did you finish handing out the food yet? What did they think?

==Completion==
Amazing, isn't it?

I don't think she wants to change back yet, at least until she refines her skills some more. But we have the redberry antidote for when she's ready. Thanks again.

==Notes==
Give the hot dogs to five [[Hungry Customer]]s:
:{{text|say|Hungry Customer|I simply must give my regards to the chef. Where might I find them?}}
:{{text|say|Hungry Customer|A delight to the senses!}}
:{{text|say|Hungry Customer|My compliments to the team of culinary experts it must've taken to bring this masterpiece into being!}}
:{{text|say|Hungry Customer|Incredible!}}
:{{text|say|Hungry Customer|A simple, roasted sausage. A fine, buttered bun. Yet, elevated!}}

On complete:
:{{Text|Say|Humphrey Shortswig|I think Alice wanted to tell you-- Oh!}}
:{{Text|Say|Humphrey Shortswig|Looks like she has a note for you.}}
:''Humphrey turns to Alice.''
:{{Text|say|Humphrey Shortswig|Hey. I know I messed up, but that doesn't mean you can just throw knives in my general direction!}}

[[Alice's Note]] reads:
{{book|content=Alice's Note
<The note is written in haphazard, tiny lettering. You struggle to make it out.>

<Name>,

Now that I can smell as well as a rat, my cooking has improved! People love our restaurant. We're making gobs of money! I want to stay how I am--at least for now.

Thanks for all of your help. It's nice to know I can quit being a rat when I wanna.
