==Objectives==
Speak to [[Monte Gazlowe|Gazlowe]] to return [[Renzik "The Shiv"|Renzik's]] ashes to [[Mathias Shaw]].
* Speak to Gazlowe
* Support Gazlowe during the hand-off
* Enter the Portal to [[Westfall]]
* Meet Mathias Shaw in Westfall

==Description==
I'm surprised Shaw showed up in person. I thought he'd send an agent or somethin', but... maybe I should start expectin' better of people.

I made sure Renzik got looked after. Got the respect he deserves. This chest took me a long time to make. A lot of tiny tools. I'm not used to detail work like that, but I got it done pretty good.

I'm sure he could still pick the lock like nothin', but...

<Gazlowe smiles sadly.>

Let's get him sent back home to [[Stormwind]], yeah?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I apologize for the sudden change of scenery, but it's important that you see this rather than just hear it.

==Notes==
Speak with Gazlowe again:
{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|
<Gazlowe looks down at the small box in his hand.>

Renzik's ready to go back to [[Stormwind]].

Let me hand him off to Shaw, then he'll get to go home.

*{{Gossip|quest=|Go ahead.}}
*{{Gossip|{{text|red|<Skip conversation>}} You can handle this on your own.}}

:{{Text|Say|Mathias Shaw|That's not usually how I heard Renzik described.}}
:{{Text|Say|Mathias Shaw|You don't get a nickname like "the Shiv" for heroics.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Well, he was. Ya make sure they remember him.}}
:{{Text|Say|Mathias Shaw|Come with me. I want to show you something.}}
:{{Text|Emote|Master Mathias Shaw makes a quick hand gesture towards his agent.}}
:''The [[Hooded Mageblade]] opens a portal to Westfall. Mathias goes into the portal and then Gazlowe follows.''

Before leaving, the [[Hooded Mageblade]] has gossip for mages:
{{dialogue|<The agent regards you silently.>

{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Mage)}} I didn't know SI:7 employed mages.}}

That is the point.}}

[[File:Settled Dust.jpg|thumb|Gazlowe and Shaw in front of the lighthouse.]]
Take the portal to arrive at [[Westfall Lighthouse]] where Monte Gazlowe and Mathias Shaw are at the door.
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|...A lighthouse?}}
:{{Text|Say|Mathias Shaw|A quiet place. Renzik used to come here with me.}}

Gazlowe has gossip:
{{dialogue|Even if he didn't think so, Renzik knew what it meant to be a goblin.

It's buildin' outta what's there. Even if others think all you got to work with is junk, goblins build it into something that matters.

Even if it ain't always right, ya keep buildin'.}}
