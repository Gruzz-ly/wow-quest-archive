==Objectives==
Meet Marty Zoomcart at [[Office of Lawyering|his office]] in [[Hovel Hill]].

==Description==
Another series of miscellaneous and legally questionable tasks done well, <name>! You should really consider going into this line of work full time... whatever line of work this is exactly.

I'll grab the [[Cellar Gnomes|Gnomes]]'s signatures, and meet you back at my office.

Normally I'd be willing to give you a ride, but I've got a personal errand to run first. You'll see.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
We're sure in the final stretch now.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|You're our last set of signatures. Now we can take it all to the final boss: Goblin Court!}}
:{{text|say|Chancellor Gnome|Aren't you worried we killed Rosebud? We're suspects, right?}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Nah. I mean, yes. You are technically suspects.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|But you're also a group of artists with a dream.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|A dream that would have risen with the Gallagio... and exploded right alongside Rosebud.}}
:{{text|say|Chancellor Gnome|Exactly. Because the "artists with a dream" gig doesn't pay the bills on its own.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Thusly, I must conclude that the Cellar Gnomes are not Rosebud's murderers.}}
:{{text|say|Chancellor Gnome|Nice. You're a peach, Marty.}}

Go back to Marty's office, where he can be found talking to his kids:
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Atom, do you really need to step on all the paperwork?}}
:{{text|say|Atom Zoomcart|YUP! AREN'T I DOING THE BEST JOB EVER, POPS?}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|You sure are, son...}}

==Progression==
{{Hard Ways at the Gallagio}}
