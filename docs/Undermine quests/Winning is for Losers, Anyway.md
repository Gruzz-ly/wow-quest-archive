==Objectives==
Collect Debt Markers and free the Indenture Debtors.
*[[Indentured Debtor]]s freed (10)

==Description==
This is the worst job I've ever had. And I used to work Turtle Toss at [[Darkmoon Faire]].

We're not imprisoned here physically with shackles, but [[Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|Tarbonara]] owns all of our debts. He imprinted the information on Debt Markers, which his goons hold on to in case any of us want to know where we stand.

But if you get a hold of those markers. we're all free. You'd have to crack some skulls to get them though, so I'll give you points for each of his goons bring down.

You like collecting points, don'tcha?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Everybody packed in? Good! This will definitely NOT get us pulled over.

Can't praise you enough for this one, <name>. Really. Truly. The [[Gallagio]] is going to have an entire floor of gaming enthusiasts ready to go!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Fantastic Davey|Do me a favor! Let me know if gaining points makes this more or less fun for you.}}

When freed, the debtors say one of the following lines:
:{{text|say|Indentured Debtor|Can you really erase debt just like that?!}}
:{{text|say|Indentured Debtor|SCORE! Now I can mine chits just for fun again!}}
:{{text|say|Indentured Debtor|They serve lunch in an hour. Should I stay till then?}}
:{{text|say|Indentured Debtor|Thank you so much! Do you have 15 gold I could borrow?}}

Go back to Marty who is on his car with Kayjay, Davey and some Indentured Debtor:
{{Dialogue|I know the car looks unsafe right now, but I promise it's completely up to code. I set it up all the time like this when I drive my kids.}}
