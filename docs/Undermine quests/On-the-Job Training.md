==Objectives==
Check out [[Angelo Rustbin]]'s wares inside [[Hovel Hill|Undermine Sanitation]], then complete a [[S.C.R.A.P.]] job in [[Undermine]].
* Check out Angelo's wares
* Find Carlo at a S.C.R.A.P. Heap
* S.C.R.A.P. job completed

==Description==
If you're lookin' for work, S.C.R.A.P. is always hirin'. That's short for "Salvage, Cleanup, and Recl-Amation Patrol."

We go around Undermine shovelin' up trash and pickin' out the good bits. Valuables get brought back here, cleaned up, and resold to whoever's buyin'.

Find somethin' useful and my man Angelo will trade you for it. Go check out what he's got in stock, then find me out in the field and I'll show you the ropes.

But I mean, it's trash shovelin', not rocket surgery.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You might wanna invest in some eye protection. Or at least some really thick gloves. Maybe nose plugs.

==Completion==
Ah, I love the smell of profit at an ambiguous time of day.

If you wanna make some more moolah, find me out in the field again. We're gonna do real good work together.
