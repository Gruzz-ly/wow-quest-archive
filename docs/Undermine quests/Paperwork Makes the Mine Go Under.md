==Objectives==
Establish a plan to keep the Gallagio out of the auction house.
*Inspect Deed to the Gallagio
*Ask Marty about the plan

==Description==
Name is Marty. Marty Zoomcart. Marty Zoomcart, public defender, and agent assigned to the [[Gallagio]]'s case for State of Undermine.

What a mouthful... Just call me Marty.

So the deed holder, [[Rosebud Gallywix]], is dead? And no one knows whodunnit. And some nobody, you, has the deed? Frankly, it's a common occurrence. Plenty of precedent. Just no time...

Here's the skinny: if we don't attach some new legal owners to the deed, it's getting put up on the auction house like a pair of decade-old pants.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Pendant of Shrouded Secrets]]
*[[Truthseeker's Necklace]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I don't usually like to get wrapped up in big business.

But the Gallagio, you know, it's an important establishment for the people of Undermine.

==Completion==
We got quite the task ahead of us.

Don't be frightened though. We'll figure this one out, one step at a time.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Nothing like a little legalese in the morning. Am I right, <name>?}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Huapp!}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Now, let's look at this charred hunk of paper.}}

Upon inspecting the deed:
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|See all those squiggly lines down there below Rosebud's charred signature?}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Those are the Gallagio's Chief Executives. Hired by Rosebud, and attached to the deed as its founding employees.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Being an absolute nobody, you probably don't realize that Undermine law considers founding employees to be legal "next of kin."}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|I think I gotta plan, <name>! Ask me about it. Go on, ask me.}}

Talk to Mart:
{{Dialogue|It's a real good plan. I ain't joking.

{{Gossip|quest=|What is the plan?}}
}}

:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Here it is: We go around Undermine, to all the ex-Chief Executives that signed their name here...}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|An addendum deed! Very official stuff. Which we will then present to the judge at tomorrow's court hearing.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Then the Gallagio will be saved from the auction house! ...Probably!}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|You know what? It might even give us a chance to see if any of the Chiefs are the murderer too!}}
