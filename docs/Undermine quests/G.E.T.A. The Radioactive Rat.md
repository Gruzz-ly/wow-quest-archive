==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Radioactive Rat.png|Radioactive Rat|This Radioactive Rat has found an unlikely benefit to the radioactive waste that accumulates in the Undermine sewers.}}

*Bait Placed
*[[Radioactive Rat]] defeated
*[[Radioactive Rat's Head|Trophy]] retrieved
*Trophy placed.

==Description==
We got a report here of some big, radioactive rat that was chased into a nearby sewer. Not only is it highly aggressive, it's terrible for the environment.

Hey, don't look at me like that. Us Underminers care about that stuff even if the big cartels don't.

I put the location of the sewer entrance on your map. Hopefully, one of these lunks will get off their butts and join you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Once you're finished, come back here, and I'll make sure you're adequately compensated.

==Completion==
I haven't seen a rat that big since... actually, I don't think I've seen a rat that big before. Well done.

==Notes==
Upon reaching the sewer entrance, [[Colton]] is nearby:
:{{text|say|Colton|Rats...}}
:{{text|say|Colton|Why did it have to be a rat?}}

Head downstairs, defeat the mob, loot the corpse, then return to HQ and place it on the wall.

==Progression==
