'''Cashing the Check''' concludes the Homecoming chapter of the [[Undermine(d) campaign]], and thus rewards the [[Undermined (achievement)]] quest achievement. After the first character on the account completes this quest, alts can opt to skip the campaign by speaking with [[Monte Gazlowe]] at the [[Incontinental Hotel]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Grimla Fizzlecrank]] in the [[Incontinental Hotel]].
* Speak to Grimla

==Description==
We got one more thing to set straight.

Come on. Grimla's waitin' for us back in the hotel lobby.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
* [[Undermined (achievement)]]

==Progress==
Heya, boss.

==Completion==
We've shown everyone that [[Undermine]] ain't never bendin' the knee to no one. And if they try to force us, they better be ready for a hell of a fight.

The future ain't gonna be perfect--but if it's ours to mess up, that's good enough for me.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Monte Gazlowe turns to [[Mathias Shaw]].''
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Hey, Shaw. You ever need anything, I owe ya one.}}
:{{Text|Say|Mathias Shaw|That's a dangerous thing to say to the spymaster of [[Stormwind]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Life's a dangerous business.}}
:''Mathias Shaw backs away, then he salutes and pops [[Vanish]].''
:{{Text|Emote|Gazlowe nods at you wordlessly, sparing one final glance over the balcony before he turns away.}}

Head to the [[Incontinental Hotel]] and speak with Grimla Fizzlecrank.
{{Dialogue|Heya, boss. I got everyone together back in the boardroom. We need to have to a quick meetin' about everything that happened.

You wanna come?

{{gossip|quest=|{{text|rare|Play Movie}} Let's go.}}

The [[The War Within in-game cinematics|pre-rendered cutscene]] "A New Tomorrow" plays:
{{#ev:youtube|se17Aw_BXE4|A New Tomorrow}}
:''The cutscene begins with a fly over shot of Undermine where the residents are getting back to normal as the voice of Gazlowe narrates over languid music.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Monte Gazlowe|The truth is, I never thought that much of Undermine. The rough streets, the dirty dealings, the mob bosses squeezing everyone for their last copper coin.}}
:''The fly over shot comes to a stop at the [[Gallagio]]''
:{{Text|bossemote|Monte Gazlowe|And while [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] is gone for good, that's not what's gonna change this city.}}
:''The cutscene shifts into a shot of Gallywix's painting getting removed by a [[Hobgoblin]] and Monte Gazlowe gets into the frame.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Monte Gazlowe|It'll be the people who defy its reputation and stick around to fight for each other.}}
:''Gazlowe smiles as he was greeted silently by [[Marin Noggenfogger]], [[Baron Revilgaz]], and Grimla Fizzlecrank.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Monte Gazlowe|That's what [[Renzik]] did.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Monte Gazlowe|And that's what we all gotta do to build a new tomorrow for Undermine.}}
:''Monte Gazlowe pushed the chair that Gallywix sat on in the Undermine Intro away and sits down and begins to speak.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Monte Gazlowe|So, let's get to work.}}
:''The scene fades to black for a moment, then a crack of lightning breaks the silence to show flashes of the void, which resolve into into a shot of [[Phase-Thief Azir]] staring at a [[Void]] rift of [[K'aresh]]. As the camera pulls over the ethereal's left shoulder, it reveals the [[Dark Heart]] in his left hand!'' 

On complete, two Stay awhile and listen prompts appear:

{{Dialogue|title=Grimla Fizzlecrank|It never rains in Undermine, so why did [[Venture Company|Venture Co.]] order so many umbrellas?

{{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:''Baron Revilgaz comes in as Grimla sighs.''
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|What're these Venture Company idiots trying to do to me now!}}
:{{Text|Say|Baron Revilgaz|What do you mean?}}
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|[[Kaja'mite]] smuggling, illegal mines, who knows what else?}}
:{{Text|Say|Baron Revilgaz|Eh, I thought you were in charge.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Venture Company isn't like other cartels. We ain't got no trade prince.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|I'm one goblin tryin to push them in the right direction. There's a whole parade of trouble makers pulling other strings.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|But I can't let things go back to the way they were.}}
:{{Text|Say|Baron Revilgaz|Lemme tell ya something I learned from a lifetime at sea.}}
:{{Text|Say|Baron Revilgaz|If you want yer crew ta behave, all the contracts and charters don't mean much if ya can't convince them they want you in charge.}}
:{{Text|Say|Baron Revilgaz|The hard cases, they leave ya two choices.}}
:{{Text|Say|Baron Revilgaz|The first, hoist your own flag. You got the friends to back ya if you do.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Fizzlecrank Unlimited does have a ring to it, but I'm not done fighting yet. Choice two?}}
:{{Text|Say|Baron Revilgaz|Well, technically speaking, [[Blackwater Cartel|Blackwater]]'s not in the walking the plank business anymore.}}
:{{Text|Say|Baron Revilgaz|Still, we might be able to arrange a few executive swimming lessons. Eh heh heh heh.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Monte Gazlowe|We still got a lot of work to do here.

{{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:''[[Orweyna]] comes in.''
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|I cannot stay longer. My visions call me elsewhere.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Don't sweat it. This's a goblin mess, and we'll work it out ourselves.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|We put an end to the [[Black Blood]] weapons. It is enough for now.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|I wouldn't be too sure.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|I don't know visions, but I know Gallywix.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|We shut down production in Undermine, but he always made backup plans.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|You say you don't know visions... yet you have a vision for your city's future. One you did not possess before returning home to help your people.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Not just because of your vision, but because of theirs. My goddess needed me to see that.}}
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|When I follow my own visions, it will not be as narrowly as before.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|If you say so. Just remember you got friends in Undermine. If you need them.}}
