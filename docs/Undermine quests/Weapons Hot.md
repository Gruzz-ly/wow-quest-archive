==Objectives==
Destroy Black Blood crates and weapons in the Heaps.
* Black Blood Weapons Eliminated (0/100%)

==Description==
The destructive impulses of those who harvest [[Azeroth]] for their own profit never cease to horrify me. But these weapons are like nothing that has come before.

All containers of [[Black Blood]] must be overturned and destroyed. Weapons fueled by it crushed and dismantled. Those who wield it against others, put down. The people of this city, and this world, won't be safe until we do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
You've done well. But now, we must strike at the heart of where their weapons are assembled.

==Notes==
After picking up both quests, [[Nikki the Fixer]] appears on a roof in the distance:
:{{text|yell|Nikki the Fixer|Ooh, I wonder what this one will do!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Nikki the Fixer takes aim at you...}}
:''Nikki the Fixer fires a Rocket Barrage in a targeted area of effect that will damage and knock back the player if it hits. Grimla Fizzlecrank and [[Pamsy]] run off, and [[Orweyna]] shifts into her bat form and flies off.''
:{{text|yell|Nikki the Fixer|Run, that's right! Run! Ahahaha!}}
:''Nikki flies off.''

Fill the bar by slaying the [[Bloodfueled Sapper]] (6%), [[Loyalist Scrapper]] (4%), [[Bloodarmed Tester]] (5%), [[Bloodfused Hoverturret]] (10%), and destroying the [[Black Blood Grenades]] & the [[Black Blood Shipment]]s (4%)

Go to the [[Heaps (Undermine)|Heaps]] and turn in both quests once that is done.

On approach:
:{{text|emote|Orweyna snuffs out a flame smoldering on her shoulder with a firm pat.}}
