==Objectives==
Locate [[Baron Revilgaz]] at Hovel Hill.
*Speak with Baron Revilgaz

==Description==
There is no doubt about it. These shipments have [[Blackwater Cartel]] written all over them... literally. The [[Black Blood]] comes in here and then Blackwater takes it somewhere in the city by couriers.

So if we want to find out where, we go right to the top--[[Baron Revilgaz]]. [[Grimla Fizzlecrank|Grimla]] mentioned Revilgaz has a temporary set up nearby, here in Hovel Hill. Let's go pay him a visit.

The [[ethereal]] thing will have to wait.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Tracking the shipments should show us who's using 'em. Check out any labels or letters layin' around!

I think I stunned all of the defenses, they'll leave us be.

==Completion==
I am sure we can come to an understanding.

==Notes==
Upon accept;
:{{Text|Say|[[Monte Gazlowe]]|That crate of Black Blood had Blackwater labels all over it. Let's pay Revilgaz a visit.}}

Head to back of [[Hovel Hill]] where [[Monte Gazlowe]] & [[Renzik "The Shiv"]] has found [[Baron Revilgaz]].
:{{Text|Say|[[Monte Gazlowe]]|Hey look, we're all friends here.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Renzik "The Shiv"]]|But you're working for the bad guys.}}

[[Gazlowe]] has a gossip:
{{dialogue|We gotta put real pressure on Revilgaz here. He's not a villain, just self- interested. I know he'll help us. though.}}

& so does [[Renzik]]:
{{dialogue|If this guy wants to claim he's legit. he'll need to step up.}}

Speak with Baron Revilgaz:
{{Dialogue|To what do I owe the pleasure of the three of you showing up at my temporary abode?}}

{{gossip|quest=|We found evidence that you are transporting [[Black Blood]] within [[Undermine]].}}
{{Dialogue-child|You make it sound like I've committed a crime. We all gotta find ways to survive under Gallywix's tyranny.

{{gossip|quest=|Where is the Black Blood going in Undermine?}}


{{gossip|What's going on with the ethereals?}}
{{Dialogue-child|I've only heard whispers about [[ethereal]]s in [[Undermine]]. Ghost stories make the delivery guys jumpy. Extra security didn't hurt nobody.

{{gossip|I have more questions.}}
}}
{{gossip|Why is this your temporary home?}}
{{Dialogue-child|All I've done is work with [[Gallywix]]. but the [[Darkfuse Enforcement|Darkfuse]] squatted in the [[Blackwater Marina]] anyway. I got sick of 'em watchin my every move, so a new place gave me a bit of freedom.

{{gossip|I have more questions.}}
}}

{{gossip|Who controls Hovel Hill?}}
}}
{{Dialogue-child|No one controls Hovel Hill. The goblins with no cartel ties live here, and any cartel goblins that don't have better digs in one of the cartel areas.

{{gossip|I have more questions.}}
}}

{{Text|Say|Baron Revilgaz|You're my pals, but it's Undermine. Ya want something, ya give something.}}

{{Undermine Awaits}}
