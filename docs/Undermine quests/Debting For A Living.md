==Objectives==
Speak with Kayjay and Fantastic Davey about signing the new [[Gallagio]] deed.
*Speak with [[Tarbonara Fizzlecrank]]
*Speak to [[Kayjay]]
*Speak to [[Fantastic Davey]]

==Description==
First of [[Rosebud Gallywix|Rosebud]]'s Chiefs on our list are the genius gaming duo: [[Kayjay]] and [[Fantastic Davey]]. 

Now, I heard from my wife's brother that [[Venture Company|Venture Co.]] bought up all the debt those boys got. Happened the minute Rosebud was done in. Did they murder him? Not a great motive if their debt was sky high, but you never know whose pocket a goblin is in either. 

Best we see how comfortable they are here at the ol' [[Venturewood]] landfill. If they don't want to sign the new deed, we might have our culprits!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
You'll find all those in my employ are quite content. I've got the bills from various corporate training seminars to prove it.

==Completion==
You see? They're happy as Zandalari crustaceans.

But if you're truly invested in poaching their services, perhaps we can make a deal...

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|C'mon. Right up these stairs.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Hey, Grimla! It's me! It's Marty Zoomcart! From the old dance hall!}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Uh. You ain't Grimmy.}}
:{{text|say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|No. I'm not "Grimmy." I'm her cousin, Tarbonara Fizzlecrank. And I want to know what you're doing here.}}

Talk to Tarbonara:
{{Dialogue|Oh. It's you again.

Too bad about Rosebud. Him exploding like that.

I seem to remember you were the last one to speak with him beforehand. Quite suspicious. I wouldn't be surprised to find you in handcuffs before long.

{{Gossip|We're here for Kayjay and Fantastic Davey.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|Both are right here. You're welcome to speak with them.}}
:{{text|say|Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|You'll find they're very happy with their current arrangement. Well fed. Comfortable. And very, very happy.}}

After interacting with Kayjay:
:{{text|say|Kayjay|I LOVE MY WORK HERE AT VENTURE CO. AND MISTER FIZZLECRANK IS THE IDEAL BOSS.}}

After interacting with Davey:
:{{text|say|Fantastic Davey|MAKING "FUN" FOR OUR "COWORKERS" IS THE GREATEST "EMPLOYMENT" WE'VE EVER HAD.}}
