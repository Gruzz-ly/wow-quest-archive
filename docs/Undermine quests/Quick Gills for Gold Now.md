==Objectives==
Exchange Gold Fish for Gobdre's Prized Pan.
*Ask [[Blair Bass]] how "Gold" Fish works.
*[["Gold" Fish]] fished
*Buy [[Gobdre's Prized Pan]] from Blair Bass.

==Description==
Show me you ain't just talk.

I give Diner Cards to each customer.

They're supposed to fill it out with their reviews on my menu, and return it here.

But I haven't seen any yet.

Fishy much? Definitely. And not the kind I like.

Go. Fetch. Get my reviews back. I ain't budging an inch in the Gallagio's direction without them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Blair and Chub Bass. The scammiest lovebirds you'll ever meet.

But they did source me some terrific fish.

==Completion==
You still ain't chef material, but you sure are real good at fetch work.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Jojo Gobdre|Long story short... I sold my pan for crates of mackerel.}}
:{{text|say|Jojo Gobdre|The one who's got it now is Blair Bass. She's got a new racket where you turn in irradiated fish for rewards.}}
:{{text|say|Jojo Gobdre|It's Undermine. What were you expecting?}}

Go talk to Blair Bass:
{{Dialogue|Grab a rod. Reel a fish. Win a prize.

{{Gossip|quest=|I need you to explain "Gold" Fish to me.}}

{{Dialogue-child|It's pretty simple: You reel in "Gold" Fish. We'll give you prizes when you hand them over.

A lot of gunk has flowed outta the Vatworks and into these pristine rivers.

The radiation makes that gunk shine like gold. I guess they also look a little like fish too... if you squint.

This is the premierest conservation effort of the century, brought to you by the timely partnership of the Steamwheedle Cartel and Bass Co Limited.}}

After buying the pan:
:{{text|say|Blair Bass|I can't believe someone actually bought that gob-ugly pan...}}

Return to Jojo who has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|What makes this particular pan so important?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Because it's my pan.

It's got good weight. I like the smell. And I'm pretty sure the dent on the side makes it heat up faster.

{{Gossip|Then why did you get rid of it?}}

{{Dialogue-child|That a serious question? 'Cuz I was mad about Rosebud!

But I know you get it. You just got one of those faces. The face of someone who's well acquainted with traumatically-induced episodes of endless mental spiraling.

Yeah... Definitely one of those faces.}}

On completion:
:{{text|say|Jojo Gobdre|Alright, Zoomcart. You and your sidekick lawyerer won me over. Gallagio or bust.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Glad to hear it! I'd be clawing for a real kitchen too if I'd been cooking all day in a Vatworks alley!}}
