'''Red Tape''' begins the third chapter of the [[Undermine(d) campaign]]: "Uncovering the Truth".

==Objectives==
Find [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] at [[Slam Central Station]].
* Find [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] at [[Slam Central Station]]
* Customs Agents convinced to leave (4)

==Description==
First it was just [[Black Blood]], now [[ethereal]]s?

I don't know how all this squares, but we need help if we wanna find out.

[[Orweyna]] left to get [[Alleria]] a while ago. We should head over to [[Slam Central Station]] to see if they've made it down here yet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
We shoulda known. These guys see an outsider unescorted and try to pull a fast one.

See if you can change their minds.

==Completion==
Now that Alleria's here, let's get to the bottom of this business--startin' with [[Marin Noggenfogger|Noggenfogger]].

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|Say|[[Monte Gazlowe]]|Black Blood. Ethereals. Alleria's gonna have a field day with all this.}}
:''Gazlowe, [[Renzik "The Shiv"|Renzik]], and [[Grimla Fizzlecrank|Grimla]] leave the [[Incontinental Hotel]].''

At [[Slam Central Station]], a group of [[Customs Agent]]s have stopped [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]].
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Again? Are you serious?}}
:{{Text|Say|Customs Agent|Rules are rules. No one gets in with dangerous goods.}}

Grimla has gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Grimla Fizzlecrank|
At least it's just greedy guards and not [[Darkfuse]].
}}

Speak to the four [[Customs Agent]]s to convince them to let Alleria through:
{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|title=Customs Agent (male goblin)|
If she ain't got a permit for that weapon, she ain't gettin' in. That's the policy.

Although... maybe for the right tip, that policy could change.

*{{Gossip|quest=|<Sigh and hand over the gold.>}} ''(Costs {{cost|1}})''
*{{Gossip|quest=|{{Text|rare|(Goblin)}} Here's a tip: get lost, pal.}}
*{{Gossip|quest=|{{Text|rare|(Rogue)}} Extortion works better when you don't announce it.}}
*{{Gossip|quest=|Or I could beat you senseless.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Customs Agent|I'm suddenly feelin' very convinced. Have a good one.}}

{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|title=Customs Agent (blue-haired female goblin)|
Rules are rules, buddy. Visitors can bring in weapons and mid-grade explosives, but anything that magical needs paperwork submitted in advance.

We're gonna have to collect a premium fee if you want that paperwork expedited.

*{{Gossip|quest=|She's an ally of a Trade-Prince. you know.}}
*{{Gossip|quest=|{{Text|rare|(Goblin)}} Things gonna go well for you if Gazlowe's signature is on that paperwork?}}
*{{Gossip|quest=|{{Text|rare|(Rogue)}} Or I could just forge that paperwork, if it weren't fake to begin with.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Customs Agent|Yeah, yeah, that's what they all--OH! You're serious! That's trouble I don't need.}}

The black-haired female goblin:
{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|title=Customs Agent (black-haired female goblin)|
Look, I'm just doin' my job. The safety of Undermine is our number one priority, or somethin' like that.

*{{Gossip|quest=|Can you let her through, please?}}
*{{Gossip|quest=| C'mon. We'll get you a better gig.}} ''(Goblin only)''
*{{Gossip|quest=|Very convincing performance.}} ''(Rogue only)''
}}
:{{Text|Say|Customs Agent|Y'know, no one's ever been polite to me like that. Go ahead.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Customs Agent (hobgoblin)|
The elf's gotta put da bow in da box!

We gotta check if it a dangerous weapon!

{{Gossip|quest=|We're in Undermine. Everyone has dangerous weapons.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Customs Agent|You admitted you gots dangerous weapon!}}

The hobgoblin Customs Agent becomes hostile. Upon defeating him:
:{{Text|Say|Customs Agent|Ow...}}

With all four agents gone, Alleria approaches Gazlowe.
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|[[Black Blood]], new weapons, secret projects, and now [[ethereal]]s.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Yes. That sounds like you are on the right trail.}}
