==Objectives==
Get Marin Noggenfogger to spill the beans on Jojo Gobdre's whereabouts.
*Prod [[Marin Noggenfogger|Noggenfogger]] for a recommendation
*Use the [[DeLux L-A-Vator]]
*Meet [[Jojo Gobdre]]
*[[Noggenfogger's Recommendation]] (provided)

==Description==
Not sure if your schnoz picked up what mine did on the drive over, but there were some delightful smells coming from the street below. 

Problem was, the crowds were too thick for me to find Gobdre anywhere.

That's where Noggy comes in. He's a pretty important fella these days, so I figure he'd have some sorta in for us.

He's generally an unfeeling scientist-type who doesn't spill secrets. But his pride is also fragile as my wife's Rumble figurines. 

Give it a poke and he should spill.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Did you just cut the line?

==Completion==
Noggenfogger gave you a personal recommendation letter, as well?

He's duller than I thought if he expects I'd let anyone jump the line.

==Notes==
Talk to Noggenfogger:
{{Dialogue|Make it quick. I scheduled this time block for rooftop relaxation.

{{Gossip|quest=|I heard the food in Vatworks is awful.}}

{{Gossip|quest=|Hello, average citizen. These food scents are below par. Where do they come from?}}

{{Gossip|quest=|What's wrong? Is Noggenfogger Elixir selling so poorly that you force your chefs to cook with the leftover product?}}

:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Apologies, Noggy.}}
:{{text|say|Marin Noggenfogger|Hey, remember. You can't call me "Noggy" anymore.}}
:{{text|say|Marin Noggenfogger|Sprinkle is real possessive of that pet name.}}

Upon reaching Jojo's place:
:{{text|say|Jojo Gobdre|We got three flayer stakes, five dreamsalads, and eight bombcrab cakes all day, people!}}
:{{text|yell|Sous Chefs|Yes chef!}}

{{Dialogue|You cutting the line?!
