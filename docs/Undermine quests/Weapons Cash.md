==Objectives==
Destroy Underrider equipment throughout the compound.
*Underrider equipment destroyed (8)
*[[Crumpled Delivery Note]] (provided)

==Description==
<Inside the weapons crate you find a crumpled note written to the Underriders.>

Good to see you're putting your new toys to good use. These little squatters are leaving in droves thanks to you guys!

Keep up the good work and there's more where this came from. Just try not to burn the whole place down. Can't rent out an empty lot, haha!

Signed,<br>
[[Moz Barrelbottom|M.B.B.]]

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Find something?

==Completion==
A letter for the Underriders? I think I know this signature...

It's that wormy landlord, [[Moz Barrelbottom]]!

==Notes==
Around the area for [[Tenant Trouble]] and [[Renter's Insurance]], looks for the [[Weapons Cache (Undermine)|Weapons Cache]] that begins this quest.

Destroy [[Underrider Bike]]s, the [[Fireworks (Undermine)|Fireworks]], and more Weapon Caches. Once all tasks are done, return to [[Barrelbottom Apartments]] and turn all three quests. Mama has lost a fight and Gabi is nowhere to be seen:
{{dialogue|<Mama Keara is covered head to toe in injuries. Whoever attacked her made it personal.>

Don't worry about me, we need to stop whoever caused all of this!}}
