==Objectives==
Slay 6 [[Venture Supervisor]]s in the [[Lucky Break Mines]].
*[[Venture Supervisor]] slain (6)

==Description==
I took a quick look inside that mine up ahead while you were gone. Looks like they've got Venture Co. mining out all the kaja'mite and bringin' it down to the beach. It's gettin' packaged up down there, but I couldn't tell where it was goin' afterward.

We need to cut off the supply at the origin. Deal with the supervisors in the mine, and I'm willin' to bet their workers will have enough sense to run afterward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Good. The fewer Venture Co. around who are loyal to [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]], the better.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both Crashing the Market & [[Asset Management]],
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Kaja'mite, Black Blood... There's gotta be a connection here.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Gallywix isn't making Kaja'Cola, that's for sure.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|He must know somethin' about kaja'mite that we don't.}}

Gazlowe has something to say:

:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|It's good to finally get outta there.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Again with Undermine? What's your problem?}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Really? You gotta ask?}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Every day what I earned got stole. What I built got broke.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|In Undermine, every good idea was just chum in the water.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Every bad goblin crawled out of the woodwork and the bad guys would always win.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|I couldn't live like that. I had ta get out. You left too.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Yeah, the bad guys always won.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Huh. Got tired of the boot on your neck?}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|I got tired of the being the boot.}}

Go to the [[Lucky Break Mines]] and slay the [[Venture Supervisor]]s in there. Once that is done return to [[Monte Gazlowe]] and [[Renzik "The Shiv"]] to turn in Asset Management, [[Crashing the Market]], and [[A Miner Mistake]].
