==Objectives==
Kill 20 [[Darkfuse Solutions|Darkfuse]] at [[Tailgate Park]].
* Darkfuse Riot Forces slain (20)

==Description==
[[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] can't hide the truth, but he can beat us down until folks have no choice but to accept it. We ain't lettin' that happen again.

You see someone hurting a [[Bilgewater Cartel (Undermine)|Bilgewater goblin]], return the favor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
The people have to know the streets are safe. It's on us to make them so.

==Completion==
The time for talking this out is long past. If they're with Gallywix, that's on them.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests, speak with Dirk again to pick a headline, then get to killing the [[Darkfuse Riotstomper]]s, [[Darkfuse Watcherbot]]s, [[Venture Cratemover]]s, [[Darkfuse Smashcaster]]s, & [[Malfunctioning Cratemover]]s all over [[Tailgate Park]].

Dirk has something to say after finishing both quests:
:{{Text|Say|Dirk Greasedealer|I saw Gazlowe head into one of the buildings up ahead! I think he's lookin' for ya, <name>!}}

Go to the [[Dirigible Delivery]] where the [[Food Stall Vendor]] calls out:
:{{Text|Say|Food Stall Vendor|Pssst. Hey, <name>! In here! Gazlowe's lookin' for ya!}}

Head inside and turn in both quests to Gazlowe.

On complete:
:{{Text|Say|[[Nikki the Fixer]]|Ahahaha! That's right, run! The streets belong to [[Darkfuse Enforcement|Darkfuse]]! Don't forget it!}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Let's get that cackling assassin.}}
