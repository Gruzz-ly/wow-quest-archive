==Objectives==
Help [[Pitz Lowe|Pitz]] repair the [[G.O.L.E.M.]]
* [[Haphazard Toolbox|G.O.L.E.M. tuned-up]]
* [[Day-Old Leftovers|G.O.L.E.M. fed]]
* [[Motor Oil|G.O.L.E.M. oiled]]
* [[Pitz's Masterwork Invention]]... Used?

==Description==
I'm... not the inventor my old man is. Or much of an inventor at all, really. My masterwork is over by the wall there, but to be honest, there's a lot of work that still needs to be done to get it to do... anything.

But this! This could be my big chance to prove to Pops that I've got what it takes to make him proud!

All we need to do is actually, uh, figure out how to repair this thing. How hard could it be?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Is it... working?

==Completion==
This isn't good. This isn't working at all.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|Pops is gonna be so mad if he finds out we broke the G.O.L.E.M. We gotta fix it before he notices!}}
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|I'm sure there's a tool that'll help somewhere in that toolbox...}}

Interact with the [[Haphazard Toolbox]] in the northeast corner:
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|That didn't do it, uh... maybe he's hungry?}}
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|I got some leftover takeout that would fill him right up!}}

Try the [[Day-Old Leftovers]] in the northwest corner:
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|No no no, I know what this thing needs--a good oiling!}}
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|Pourin' motor oil on a problem never hurt, right?}}

The barrel of [[Motor Oil]] is in the southwest corner:
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|I've got it! This obviously calls for my masterwork invention!}}
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|What does it do? I, uh... haven't figured that out yet!}}
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|Just throw it! Couldn't hurt, right?}}

Pitz has new gossip:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|What does your masterwork invention do?}}

Do? Well... I'm still workin' on that part.

For now it just, um. Does invention things! It's an invention!

Inventing isn't a linear process, y'know. Pops is always saying that.

{{gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}}}

[[Pitz's Masterwork Invention]] is on the table along the east wall:
:{{text|say|Pitz Lowe|Uh-oh... the G.O.L.E.M. doesn't look so good...}}
:''The G.O.L.E.M. spins for a bit before running off!''
