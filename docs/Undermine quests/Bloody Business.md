==Objectives==
Kill blood horrors for [[Orweyna]].
* Kill Blood Monstrosities (0/100%)

==Description==
The horrors of the [[Black Blood]] here cannot be underestimated. The strength of it in this place is causing my visions to feel distant, like odd whispers.

Kill the manifestations of this rot, before they grow stronger..

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I cannot ignore this blight on the land.

It will take much more to staunch these wounds. We must not tire.

==Notes==
On accept:
