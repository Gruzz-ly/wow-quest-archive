==Objectives==
*Control the [[Hotwired B.I.R.D.]] to spy on Darkfuse activities in the [[Kaja'Coast]].
*Hotwired B.I.R.D. activated
*Take control of the Hotwired B.I.R.D.
*Northern beach investigated
*Shipping vessel investigated
*Spy on [[Overseer Dritz]]

==Description==
I took those parts you collected and hotwired the components into some new machinery, then stuffed it back into the bot. Now it can be piloted usin' this remote control. The remote also lets us see and hear anything the bot does.

I don't think we're gonna learn what we need to just by killin'. We're gonna need to beat Gallywix at his own game and spy on his workers.

You wanna do us the honors, <Name>? I'll talk you through it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
You clear the way for Renzik to get the punch card yet?

==Completion==
[[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] is makin' [[Blackwater Cartel|Blackwater]] bring [[Black Blood]], he's got Venture mining kaja'mite, and he's makin' [[Steamwheedle Cartel|Steamwheedle]] process it all. He's got the big cartels under his heel, and he has the [[Dark Heart]].

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|We ain't done yet. This bird is gonna let us see what they're up to here.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Give it a kick to start it up.}}

Interact with the [[Hotwired B.I.R.D.]] and it begins to activate.
:{{Text|Say|[[Renzik "The Shiv"]]|Turning their own machines against them, very [[SI:7]] of you.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|<Name>, grab the remote and I'll walk you through the controls.}}

Interact with the Hotwired B.I.R.D. again and you get to control it.
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|This remote will let you fly the bird around. If you see somethin' interesting, you can enhance the view.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|One small issue. If the bird gets too low on juice, it'll probably blow up.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Watch the senser. When it dips, you'll need to go around and do... bird stuff. You'll figure it out.}}

All over the area there are blue aura that can allow you to refill the juice up. Be careful of the [[B.I.R.D. Watcher]]s as they will catch you.

Head to the Northern beach where the [[Venture Miner]]s are chatting and snapshot them.
:{{Text|Say|Venture Miner|I haven't had a day off in forever. What's the rush on kaja'mite all of a sudden?}}
:{{Text|Say|Venture Miner|Who knows. It's not gettin' sold anywhere. But Gallywix always has a plan.}}
Head south and investigate the shipping vessel which turns out to be  [[Overseer Dritz]].
:{{Text|Say|Overseer Dritz|We need way more Black Blood than this! If we was payin' you, this would be comin' out of your checks.}}
:{{Text|Say|Overseer Dritz|Let's see if you at least brought the good stuff. Stay here!}}

Dritz flies off. Follow him into the [[Squandered Retreat]]. Take a snapshot and an [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|1jJ4ImejeiU|Black Blood Experiments}}
:''The Hotwired B.I.R.D. lands on a vine just to watch Dritz as he commands the Steamwheedle Alchemist.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Overseer Dritz|Begin the weapon test!}}
:''The Steamwheedle Alchemist turns to the targets and fires at them''
:{{Text|bossemote|Steamwheedle Alchemist|It worked!}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Steamwheedle Alchemist|The kaja'mite contains and stabilizes the Black Blood.}}
:''Dritz observes the weapon.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Overseer Dritz|So we can tell Gallywix?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Overseer Dritz|This will fix the Dark Heart?}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Steamwheedle Alchemist|Yup!}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Steamwheedle Alchemist|And all of his improved weapons designs too.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Overseer Dritz|Great news!}}
:''Overseer Dritz turns to order his Darkfuse Security.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Overseer Dritz|Hey boys!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Overseer Dritz|No witnesses.}}
:''The [[Darkfuse Security]] prepares killing the Alchemist.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Steamwheedle Alchemist|Wait! No!}}
:''The cutscene cuts to black as the Alchemist dies.''
On the other side of the cutscene, the Hotwired B.I.R.D. returns to the nest where [[Monte Gazlowe]] & [[Renzik "The Shiv"]] learned of what transpired here.
:{{Text|Say|[[Renzik "The Shiv"]]|Did he say the [[Dark Heart]]? This just got way bigger than [[Undermine]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|That's why he needed so much Black Blood, and the kaja'mite to contain it. The weapons must be a bonus.}}

Gazlowe also has new dialogue.
:{{Gossip icon}}<What do we know about the Dark Heart?>
:Not a whole lot.
:It's an artifact belongin' to [[Xal'atath]]. Seems to have a world lotta dark power in it, and that ain't good news no matter what she plans to use it for. 
:I heard [[Alleria]] cracked it back in [[Azj-Kahet]]. If I had to guess, Xala'tah's probably been scrambling to get it repaired--and we now we know she contracted [[Gallywix]] to get it done.
