==Objectives==
Destroy the Darkfuse Joyriders in the [[Blackwater Marina]].
* Collect [[Blackwater Cannonball|Cannonballs]] to fire the Blackwater Cannon (6) (Optional)
* [[Darkfuse Joyrider]] sunk (6)

==Description==
[[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] and his crew have been meddling in our business for too long. Look at what they're doing to my marina! So comfortable with their holdings that they're doing donuts on jetskis!

It's time we introduce them to a little high seas firepower.

Take this cannon and blow those Darkfuse vessels skimming our waters sky-high. After that, do me a favor and check up on the big guy, won't ya?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Did my Captain send you? He knew I'd need help...

==Completion==
Hrrk. The roar of cannonfire and the scent of black powder. You'd make a fine cannoneer.

==Notes==
After picking up both quests, slay [[Darkfuse Mariner]]s or interact with the [[Blackwater Ordinance]] to collect the [[Blackwater Cannonball]]s all over [[Blackwater Marina]]. Players also have an extra action button:
:{{Abilities|Blackwater Blast|id=457148|reagent=Blackwater Cannonball|Fire Baron Revilgraz's Blackwater cannon, dealing modest damage to enemies at the Blackwater Marina or instantly destroying a Darkfuse Joyrider.|icon=ability_racial_rocketbarrage}}

Use the Blackwater Blast on the [[Darkfuse Joyrider]]s and sink them. Once that is done, head to [[Port Authority (Undermine)|Port Authority]] where Fleet Master Seahorn is injured:
:{{Text|Say|Fleet Master Seahorn|Urgh... One of those scurvy dogs got me good.}}
Speak to him to turn in both quests.
