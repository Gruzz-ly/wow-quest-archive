==Description==
Hey, pal. Some real weird stuff has been happening south of [[Gutterville]].

Some of my friends have gone missing, and their family's worried about them. How about you take that can-do attitude of yours down there and see if you can figure out what happened?

<[[Paks Topskimmer|Paks]] scratches his chin before looking back at you.>

I'm sure there will be some compensation to make it up to you too. Trust me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|93|60|}}
* 24,400 [[XP]]
* 50x [[Valorstones]]
* +500 reputation with [[Cartels of Undermine]]

==Progress==
Yo, did you figure out what happened down there?

==Completion==
Hey, I really appreciate you going down there and handling business.

I lied about the friends thing, but at least you're getting paid, eh?
