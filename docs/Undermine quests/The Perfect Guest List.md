==Description==
The perfect weddin' has the perfect guest list!

But I'm still waiting on some RSVPs. [[Papa Kraz Torquewrench|Papa]] said he'd make sure they showed up, so that means you gotta remind them they'd love to come to my weddin'. It's gonna be the biggest bash [[Undermine|this town]] has ever seen! Why wouldn't they want to come? We're family! Mostly.

Anyway, get everyone on this list to agree to come to my weddin'. Remind them Papa said "or else."

*10 [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
You talk to all my slacker relatives yet? I have to organize the tables.

==Completion==
Alright! I can finalize my table seating now.

==Notes==
On accept:
Papa Kraz Torquewrench says: All those guests better come to my daughter's wedding! Encourage them if they forget they want to show up.

{{dialogue|title=Uncle Greedbit|Yeah?

{{gossip|quest=|Ask if they are coming to Neenee's wedding.}}

Neenee is a nice kid an' all, but I got things I need to do.

Unless you have a real good reason, I ain't goin'.

{{gossip|quest=|Imply Kraz Torquewrench has dirt on him and will tell everyone if he doesn't attend.}}

He knows about the, uh, incident, eh?

Figures. With the ears he got, I'm not surprised he can't hear what's goin' on in Booty Bay from here.

Whelp, I guess I am goin' to a weddin' after all!

Hope they don't expect a gift.

{{gossip|quest=|Imply that his absence will make Neenee cry on her special day.}}

Aw, geez. I don't wanna make the kid cry on her wedding day.

I mean, I guess I could make an appearance.

{{gossip|quest=|Imply Kraz will break his kneecaps if he doesn't go.}}

At my age, my knees are already broken, thank you very much.

But they don't need to get any broker.

I guess I can take a few minutes and show up.}}
:{{text|say|Uncle Greedbit|The things you do for family...}}

{{dialogue|title=Fezzer Rocketfang|What? I'm busy!

{{gossip|quest=|Ask if they are coming to Neenee's wedding.}}

Go to my boss's kid's wedding? I'll pass.

{{gossip|quest=|Point out the section of their employment contract that stipulates they have to attend Torquewrench family events.}}

Ugh. Fine... But I'm not gonna dress up or anythin'.}}
:{{text|say|Fezzer Rocketfang|Stupid "Or Else" clauses...}}

{{dialogue|Cousin Hagglewrench|Hey! How ya doin'?

{{gossip|quest=|Ask if they are coming to Neenee's wedding.}}

Uncle said I gotta go to Neenee's lame wedding "Or Else?"

I pick "Or Else!"

{{gossip|quest=|<You ready for a fight!>}}}}

Hagglewrench attacks! Fend him off:
:{{text|say|Cousin Hagglewrench|Okay, okay! Uncle, uncle! I give! I'll go to the wedding, sheesh.}}

{{dialogue|title=Jet Sparkbomb|<The goblin does not look up from her small device as you approach, instead making several poses and faces as the latest S.E.L.F.I.E camera whirrs and clicks.>

Don't block my light, hun.

{{gossip|quest=|Ask if they are coming to Neenee's wedding.}}

<Jet's attention is fixed on her camera and attached crystal. She answers you without looking up.>

Lotsa fans invite me to their shindigs. What makes this gal's weddin' so special?

{{gossip|quest=|Offer her 100 gold.}}}}

This pops up a confirmation window:
{{dialogue|Are you sure you want to spend 100 gold?}}
:{{text|say|Jet Sparkbomb|It's gonna be hottest event of the season... I'll be there!}}

{{dialogue|title=Auntie Starkwatt|class=plainlist|
Whaddya want?

{{gossip|quest=|Ask if they are coming to Neenee's wedding.}}

Pfft. Why would I wanna do that? That wedding is gonna be boring!

Unless you know somethin' I don't...

Ya gimme some tea, I might think about it.

*{{gossip|quest=|Tell her Vrizek almost wasn't able to pay for Neenee's contract fee.}}
*{{gossip|quest=|Tell her not many people RSVPed for the wedding.}}
*{{gossip|quest=|Tell her Neenee was relying on her to bring the drama. She has to attend!}}

Now that's some good drama! Yeah, I'll be there.}}
:{{text|say|Auntie Starkwatt|If there isn't good drama, is there even a wedding?}}
