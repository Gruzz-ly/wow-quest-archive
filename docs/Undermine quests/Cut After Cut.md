==Objectives==
Collect [[Renzik "The Shiv"|Renzik's]] belongings around the [[Westfall Lighthouse]].
* Renzik's belongings collected (3)

==Description==
Renzik was one of my finest agents--but more than that, he was a friend.

He wasn't an agent of the [[Stormwind]] crown begrudgingly fulfilling a mission in [[Undermine]]. He worked for Stormwind, but he loved Undermine.

His people were his home. Not us.

Help me gather up some of Renzik's things he left here. They should go back to Undermine, along with him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Renzik never opened up all the way, but I saw what I needed to through the cracks.

==Completion==
Renzik grew to admire Stormwind and what we stood for, but Undermine was always what he loved most.

It's important to me that you both know that.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Mathias Shaw|I leave a notch on the door for every agent I've lost.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Monte Gazlowe]]|That door looks pretty torn up, Shaw.}}
:{{Text|Say|Mathias Shaw|Yes... It does.}}

Head to the target stand and collect the [[Well-Worn Throwing Knives]].{{co|30.1|86.5|Westfall}}
:{{Text|Say|Mathias Shaw|More than anything, Renzik wanted to go home, to [[Undermine]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Mathias Shaw|He never said why, but he thought he didn't deserve it.}}

Go to the dock and collect the [[Pristine Fishing Gear]] from the [[Unused Fishing Gear]].{{co|29.8|85.5|Westfall}}
:{{Text|Say|Mathias Shaw|So he joined us. We weren't a home, but we were a substitute for it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|I guess ya do always wanna go home, one way or another.}}

Go to the barrel back at the lighthouse and collect the [[Old Copy of "Undermine Weekly"]].
:{{Text|Say|Mathias Shaw|You gave him a chance to set things right, Gazlowe.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|No, he did that himself. We'd be nowhere without him.}}

Next to it is [[Renzik's Lockbox]]. Non-rogues get an error message: {{text|red|Only a rogue could pick this lock.}}

Rogues who pick it acquire [[Renzik's Journal]] and the [[Spare Uncrowned Vest]], a rogue-only cosmetic chest. The journal reads:
{{book|content=
I shoulda told Shaw to stuff this job. I don't like who I am down here. SI:7 ain't friendly, but as soon as I see other goblins I feel like I gotta act tougher. Meaner. I feel like I gotta be be "the Shiv" again. Every time I go back, things get outta control.

----
Bribes, poisons, assassins, bombs, the usual for Undermine. Nothin' I can't handle. All the old familiar faces, all the old familiar places. I don't like fallin' into old habits though. Gettin' mean like the old days. I came down here to hurt some people who are hurting Stormwind, but it almost feels good. That's a bad sign.

----
They sent my crew to hit me! Someone's gonna pay for that, I don't care if it's a trade prince or what.

----
I hurt them. Not just the guys who hired them, but my old crew. Some of them real bad. And Jinzi, she may lose the eye. I taught them everything they know, I put them out there, and then I do this to them. Why didn't I let it go?

----
One of Jinzi's crew died. She ain't never gonna forgive me. And why? Because some baron insulted me? What am I tryin' to prove? This is the last time.
