'''Can-Do-Caddy''' begins the optional "Fore!" storyline for [[Sojourner of Undermine]] at the [[Emerald Hills Golf Course]] in southeastern [[Undermine]] alongside [[Scam Cans]].

==Objectives==
Eliminate 9 Coursehares.
*[[Coursehare]] slain (9)

==Description==
So, my "company" was subcontracted to provide services for the golf course here.

Only, it turns out the materials we used in our patented, explosive-proof grass has drawn a swarm of coursehares. Which is inconvenient 'cause they're the only type of rodents that can eat the grass.

I need a can-do caddy I can sub-subcontract out the elimination of this threat to my business. So tell me, can you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Normally, a mage would just try to magic away the coursehares, but I haven't read up on that kinda spells.

==Completion==
Great job! We are gonna be rollin' in the money now. Wait... what was that sound?

==Notes==
All over the [[Emerald Hills Golf Course]], slay 9 coursehare [[virmen]] that are infesting the area and interact with the four Scam Cans on the greens.

==Progression==
{{Fore!}}
