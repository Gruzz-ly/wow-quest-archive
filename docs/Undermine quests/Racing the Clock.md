==Objectives==
Meet Gazlowe outside Gallywix's secret warehouse in the [[Heaps (Undermine)|Heaps]].

==Description==
We were out of time before, but now we're REALLY out of time.

The ethereals are gonna beat us to the warehouse, but we might still be able to beat them to the Dark Heart.

C'mon!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
At least the ethereals took care of most of the Darkfuse. That's... good, probably.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I'll hunt down that ethereal and keep him away from the warehouse.}}
:[[Alleria Windrunner]] teleports away.
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|We'll get the hostages safe and find the Dark Heart. Renzik, <Name>, you're with me.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|[[Grimla Fizzlecrank|Grimla]], get [[Marin Noggenfogger|Marin]] to Bilgewater headquarters and send word to [[Baron Revilgaz|Revilgaz]].}}

Go the [[Heaps (Undermine)|Heaps]] and meet up with [[Gazlowe]] and [[Renzik "The Shiv"]].
