==Objectives==
Meet with [[Monte Gazlowe]] in the [[Incontinental Hotel]] in [[Undermine]].

==Description==
Hey pal, I can't thank you enough for what you've done for me... and for Undermine.

<Marin glances over at [[Sprinkle Noggenfogger|Sprinkle]] before looking back at you.>

I know you've been busy since [[Renzik "The Shiv"|Renzik]] and Gazlowe brought you here, and you keep doing what we've asked of you. But there's one more thing that needs doing.

Meet up with Gazlowe at the hotel. I'm sure he'd appreciate you being there to help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thanks for coming, champ.

There's one more thing we got to do to set [[Undermine]] right.

==Notes==
Marin has unique gossip for [[rogue]]s who participated in the {{g|Legion}} campaign:
{{Dialogue|Well, well, well. Look who it is!

How have things been after the Legion invasion?

Say, how would you feel about tryin' out a new poison sometime? I have one in the works.

Nerubian venom can do some pretty interesting things when combined with the right ingredients.

{{gossip|Didn't you recognize me earlier?}}
{{dialogue-child|<Marin looks around making sure no one is in ear-shot. He lowers his voice to a whisper and flashes the badge of the [[Uncrowned]] at you with a sly smile.>

Of course I recognized you earlier! Ya just gotta be stealthy with these things. ya know?

I can't have everyone going around knowin' I am part of the Uncrowned.}}

{{gossip|What ever happened to that love potion I stole from Gallywix?}}
{{dialogue-child|Love potion? What love potion?

<Marin gives you a conspiratorial wink.>}}

Return to the Incontinental Hotel and head upstairs to spot [[Monte Gazlowe]] speaking with [[Mathias Shaw|Master Mathais Shaw]] and a [[Hooded Mageblade]]:

Mathias Shaw has gossip:
{{Dialogue|I thought Renzik would return to Undermine one day, but another part of me hoped he might take over SI:7 when the time came.

All too often, hope is a knife we hold by the blade.}}

As well as special gossip for rogues:
{{dialogue|I'd congratulate you on a successful operation, Shadowblade, but... Perhaps later.

I thought Renzik would return to Undermine one day, but another part of me hoped he might take over SI:7 when the time came.

All too often, hope is a knife we hold by the blade.}}

On complete:
:{{Text|Say|Mathias Shaw|I got your message about [[Renzik]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Sorry to make ya travel. I needed to give ya this.}}
