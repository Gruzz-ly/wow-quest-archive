==Objectives==
Retrieve 100 Diner Review Cards.
*[[Diner Review Cards]] retrieved (100)

==Description==
Show me you ain't just talk.

I give Diner Cards to each customer.

They're supposed to fill it out with their reviews on my menu, and return it here.

But I haven't seen any yet.

Fishy much? Definitely. And not the kind I like.

Go. Fetch. Get my reviews back. I ain't budging an inch in the Gallagio's direction without them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
How'd they like the Junglevine-soaked Stormray?

Bet they said it was bitter. I knew that batch was bitter. Ran outta salt when I was cooking it.

==Completion==
The lazy diners I can understand.

But my rivals were taking cards because [[Tarbonara Fizzlecrank|Tarbonara]] told them it'd run me off their turf? Really? Couldn't they just... cook better food instead?

Doesn't matter. You're no chef, but I guess you pulled through.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Jojo Gobdre|What's that look? You thought you'd be cooking here with me?}}
:{{text|say|Jojo Gobdre|No way. We don't have room for hobbyists. You earn your apron properly like the rest of my chefs.}}

*{{text|say|Cuisine Competitor|If Jojo's cards burn, Tarbonara will buy us her lot!}}
*{{text|say|Cuisine Competitor|Mr. Fizzlecrank said doing this will run Gobdre outta here for good!}}
*{{text|say|Cuisine Competitor|Ain't no diners gonna be eating those delicious dishes anymore!}}

*{{text|say|Rival Restaurateur|I couldn't... beat 'em...}}

*{{text|say|Rival Restaurateur|Oh... that's real bad...}}
*{{text|say|Rival Restaurateur|Wanna scrap?}}
*{{text|say|Rival Restaurateur|Yer... a bum...}}

Saving [[Threatened Diner|Threatened Diners]] from [[Cuisine Competitor|Cuisine Competitors]] will trigger them to one of the following lines:
