==Objectives==
Recover parts for [[Pamsy]] in the [[Heaps (Undermine)|Heaps]].
*[[Reactive Plating]] (4)
*[[Coolant Core]]
*[[Kaja'fused Coupling]] (2)
*[[Dented Bloodhose]]

==Description==
[[Nikki the Fixer|Nikki]]'s tech is powered by [[Black Blood]]. I know that because I worked on half of it. That also means I have an idea on how we might knock her out of the sky for long enough to take her out.

No time for pre-production. We gotta build.

Remember our flashy little hoverboard adventure? Ice is nice, eh? I'm thinkin' of a similar principle--the trash heap oughta have all the salvage we'll need to build this hypothetical thingamajig.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
You got time to yap, then you've got time to smash!

==Completion==
There's only one engineer I know who'll have the smarts to build what we need in time to take down Nikki...

==Notes==
Pick up both quests before heading out.

Loot the [[Kaja'fused Coupling]] from the [[Venture Cratemover]]s that are trapped by the roots, slay the [[Loyalist Tankfiller]]s for the [[Reactive Plating]]s & [[Dented Bloodhose]] slay the [[Bloodfueled Junker]] for the [[Reactive Plating]]s as well & interact with the [[Heat-Beater 2001]] to obtain the [[Coolant Core]].

Head to Pamsy andd [[Grimla Fizzlecrank]] to turn in both quests.

Upon completing both, [[Orweyna]] swoops in:
:{{Text|Emote|Orweyna dusts her hands off and then gives you an approving nod.}}

She has something to say:
{{Dialogue|You fight well, as always. I never imagined I'd rely on anyone outside of the haranir in the way I've come to rely on you and your companions.

But there can be no celebration until the Black Blood threatens Azeroth no more. We must press on.}}
