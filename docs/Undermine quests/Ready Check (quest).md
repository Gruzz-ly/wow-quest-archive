==Objectives==
Check in with Grimla about what to do next.
*Talk to Grimla.

==Description==
We've done what we can here, <name>. Now we just have to hope it'll be enough.

Maybe Gazlowe's got a plan. Maybe now we're ready to face down [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]]. Let's formulate our next steps. I enjoy a bit of formulation from time to time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
I got a whole bunch of goblins who wanna have a word with management.

==Notes==
Speak with Grimla again:
{{Dialogue|Right, so. Next steps. We probably gotta meet up with the others, and Pamsy's gotta figure out how we build her thingamajig.

{{Gossip|quest=|<Formulate a plan.>}}

A [[The War Within in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|PSQ-Hp_g4Qo|Ready Check}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Grimla Fizzlecrank|That takes care of Gallywix's Black Blood stockpile!}}
:''Grimla turns to [[Pamsy]]''
:{{Text|bossemote|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Now for these enforcers.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Let's find Gazlowe and...}}
:''The [[adventurer]] points in Monte Gazlowe's direction as he appears. Grimla, Pamsy, and [[Orweyna]] turn to Monte Gazlowe.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Monte Gazlowe|I hope you don't mind, I brought a few friends.}}
:''Hoards of [[goblin]]s & [[hobgoblin]]s appear behind Monte Gazlowe''
:{{Text|bossemote|Monte Gazlowe|Now let's finish this.}}

On the other side of the cutscene, [[Radicalized Underminer]]s and [[Rebellious Citizen (Undermine)|Rebellious Citizen]]s begin marching north to the Gallagio.

Grimla has gossip:
{{Dialogue|Monte Gazlowe, what a guy! Look at this. He really did it!}}

On complete:
:{{Text|Say|Pamsy|We heard [[Nikki the Fixer|Nikki]]'s Executive Package was giving you trouble, Gazlowe. I got something for ya.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Never worked with parts like these before. You're putting me on a tight deadline here.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Nothin' that [[Bilgewater]]'s finest can't handle.}}
