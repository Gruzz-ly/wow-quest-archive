==Objectives==

Well then Entrepreneur Inc. has a gig for you!

Come on down to our headquarters in the Heap and speak with Skedgit Cinderbangs for more details.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh wow! I was expecting a local but you will be perfect for this gig.

See... this is less of a "gig" and more of a "heist."
