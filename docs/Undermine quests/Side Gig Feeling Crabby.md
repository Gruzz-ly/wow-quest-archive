==Objectives==
Collect 15 Powdery Crab Meat from [[bombshell crab]]s on the [[Kaja'Coast]].
*[[Powdery Crab Meat]] (15)

==Description==
Food's a critical resource for any crew that dares to sail the sea. So is gunpowder.

Let's kill two crabs with one stone and get our hands on some of those bombshells out on the Kaja'Coast.

Just don't get yourself blown up while you do it, yeah?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[The Cartels of Undermine Commendation]]
*[[Valorstones]] x9
*[[Weathered Undermine Crest]] x2
*[[Resonance Crystals]] x36

==Progress==
We'll need time to separate the powder from the crab, so get 'em here quick!

==Completion==
Look at that! Enough meat to feed a whole crew and then some.

We'll just need to be real careful about gettin' all that gunpowder off. Wouldn't want someone losin' a hand when they go to cook it.
