==Objectives==
Speak with [[Snap Vellumgrease]] at [[Cheap Grillz Inc.|Cheap Grillz]] in [[Hovel Hill]].
* Speak with Snap Vellumgrease
* [[Prototype Smellersweller]] activated

==Description==
Ooh! That [[Mite Sparkcog|Mite]] makes me so mad! He even took credit for it. An' I was right. He's going to present the Smellersweller to our boss!

In fact, he's probably presenting it right now!

That gives me an idea though. We may not have the schematic, but Mite won't know how to operate it. If we can show the boss it's not Mite's design, maybe I'll still get credit!

How good are you at pressing buttons? Will you help me present the prototype?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
We've got to hurry! Mite's had most of an hour to prepare.

All while I was on a break, that mook!

==Completion==
That no-good, brainless, fried worm of an engineer!

He'll pay for this!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Snap Vellumgrease|I live just around the corner from work. I'll see you over there!}}

Catch up with Snap and [[Mite Sparkcog]] speaking with [[Sammy Wrencharm]], the Chief Operations Manager.
:{{text|say|Snap Vellumgrease|Ah, perfect! My intern's here. We can get started.}}
:{{text|say|Sammy Wrencharm|I'm NOT reimbursing you for that, Snap. And as your boss, I say when the presentations start.}}

Speak with Snap:
{{dialogue|My boss Sammy ain't gonna like this. She hates when we're competin'. But it ain't my fault Mite's a dirty, rotten, no good plagiarizer.

Ahem! Sorry, lost my train of thought there. You ready for the presentation?

All you have to do is push a button.

{{gossip|quest=|Sure.}}}}
:{{text|say|Mite Sparkcog|The Smellifier 700 makes your burgers smell like lasagna, white sand beaches, or a rack of ribs just like... that!}}
:{{text|say|Mite Sparkcog|Oops. Well, maybe not all together. I... guess I pushed too many buttons there.}}
:{{text|say|Snap Vellumgrease|Maybe because that's my Smellersweller 5000 an' you can't operate it! My intern will demonstrate the proper technique.}}

Interact with the the Prototype Smellersweller behind Snap:
:{{text|say|Snap Vellumgrease|See? Any goblin with a brain in their head can operate it.}}
:{{text|say|Sammy Wrencharm|That's nice, Snap, but Mite already turned in his schematic! We need actual plans to build stuff.}}
:{{text|say|Mite Sparkcog|Heh. You heard the boss!}}
:{{text|say|Snap Vellumgrease|Mite, you... you rusty, hacked-together joint! I'll get you for this!}}
