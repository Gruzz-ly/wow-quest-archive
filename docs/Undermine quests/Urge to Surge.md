'''Urge to Surge''' is one of the two weekly [[Shipping and Handling]] tasks in [[Undermine]], started by [[Smaks Topskimmer]] in the [[Incontinental Hotel]]. The other is [[Many Jobs, Handle It!]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Nanny's Surge Dividends]]
* +1000 reputation with [[Cartels of Undermine]]
*[[Hellcaller Chest]] (during [[A Greedy Emissary]])

Wow. We were swamped. Thanks for the help!
