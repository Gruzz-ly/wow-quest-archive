==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Lead Foreman Krome.jpg|[[Lead Foreman Krome]]|We need to buy Renzik time to steal the Kaja'Coast punch card from Venture's headquarters.}}
Slay Lead Foreman Krome.
*[[Lead Foreman Krome]] slain
* [[Sputtering Taserblade]]

==Description==
If you gotta get to a confidential work site like the Kaja' Coast, you gotta check out a punch card from Krome's office up here.

Lead Foreman Krome is one of the big bosses who organizes how Venture's workforce gets split up.

Should be easy enough for [[Renzik]] to slip in and grab the punch card, but you'll need to take care of Krome and his guard dog. If we're gettin' to the [[Kaja'Coast]], let's do it without becomin' chew toys first, yeah?

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Guardbreaker's Chestplate]]
* [[Guardbreaker's Boots]]
* [[Guardbreaker's Wristwraps]]
* [[Guardbreaker's Helm]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
You clear the way for Renzik to get the punch card yet?

==Completion==
<Gazlowe grimaces as he inspects the foreman's weapon.>

The battery in this thing is powered by [[Black Blood]].

I don't know how they managed to do that without the thing exploding. or worse. But this situation just got a whole lot more dangerous.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''[[Renzik "The Shiv"]] drops into stealth.''
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|We need the foreman's punch-card to get to the Kaja'Coast.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|I can't sneak past his hyena. You'll have to deal with them.}}

Go to [[Venture Plaza]] and aggro [[Lead Foreman Krome]] and [[Rebar]]:
:{{Text|Say|Lead Foreman Krome|Time to try the shiny new weapons!}}

Finish them off:
:{{Text|Say|Lead Foreman Krome|My.... service awards...}}

Collect the [[Sputtering Taserblade]] from near the stairs:
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Black Blood? Get this to Gazlowe}}

Head back to [[Monte Gazlowe]]:
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Black Blood weapons? [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] is low, but this... This is just disgusting.}}
