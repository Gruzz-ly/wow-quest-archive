==Objectives==
Follow [[Zirdo]] on his "tour."
* Begin the tour
* Follow Zirdo's tour
* [[Extractor Drill X-78]] tested {{co|76.4|80.2|Ringing Deeps}}
* Continue Zirdo's tour

==Description==
You're new here, right? I can tell by your questions. But don't worry, Zirdo's your best pal!

I'll give you a personalized tour. [[Gutterville]], the [[Venture Company]] town, is just south down the road. It'll be informative and interactive. You can't ask for a better experience, trust me!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|17|55}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I lack words.

==Completion==
I lack words.

==Notes==
Speak with Zirdo again, now a micromanager/tour guide:
{{dialogue|You don't mind if I charge by the minute, do ya?

Haha, I'm just kidding. We can chat about some kind of payment in Gutterville, assuming you enjoy the tour!

{{Gossip|quest=|<Begin the tour.>}}}}

:{{text|say|Renzik "The Shiv"|This guy's just stallin'.}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|It's fine. Hey Zirdo, show us what you got.}}
:{{text|say|Zirdo|Sure thing boss! This way.}}
:''Zirdo runs downhill to the south. [[Orweyna]], [[Renzik "The Shiv"]], and [[Monte Gazlowe]] follow him. He stops at the [[Extractor Drill X-78]].''
:{{text|say|Zirdo|On your left, Venture's new mark seventy-eight Black Blood extractor. Woo! Give it a whirl!}}

{{dialogue|title=Monte Gazlowe|I'm not sure that it's useful to see a digger in motion, but let's see where Zirdo is going with this.}}

{{dialogue|title=Zirdo|The X-78 is a novel in goblin engineering! It can cope with various densities of materials, exposing deep veins.}}

Interact with the [[Extractor Drill X-78]] and it begins to function:
:{{text|say|Zirdo|Imagine how much Black Blood that baby has dug up, am I right?}}
:''After mining for a second, it starts malfunctioning and runs around the area!''
:{{text|say|Zirdo|Oops! It's eh, it's low on coolant!}}
:{{text|yell|Monte Gazlowe|Everybody move!}}
:''The party scatters, getting away from the drill before it stops, catches fire, and explodes.''
:{{text|say|Zirdo|Well a ya know, that happens a lot. Let's go to the town?}}

Speak with Zirdo:
{{dialogue|We've had a lack of coolant lately. They're hoarding it down south, I bet.

Besides, the X-78 was always more buggy than the X-71!

{{Gossip|quest=|<Continue the tour.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Zirdo|Okay! Let's go.}}
:''The goblins start moving, but Orweyna stays seated, staring at the Black Blood bubbling up.''
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Zirdo, wait. Orweyna, are you okay?}}
:''The goblins run over to her.''
:{{text|say|Orweyna|What have they done? I must have a closer look.}}
:{{text|say|Renzik "The Shiv"|<Name>, stick with Orweyna. Catch up with us at Gutterville when you can.}}
:''The goblins leave for Gutterville.''
