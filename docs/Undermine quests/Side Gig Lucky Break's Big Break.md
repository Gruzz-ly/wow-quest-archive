==Objectives==
Place 6 Support Beams in the [[Lucky Break Mines]] on the [[Kaja'Coast]].
*[[Support Beam|Support beams]] placed (6)

==Description==
You know the Lucky Break Mines over on the [[Kaja'Coast]]? Settin' those up was kind of a rush job. [[Darkfuse Enforcement|Darkfuse]] didn't exactly give [[Venture Company|Venture]] a whole lotta time to reinforce the place.

Long story short, there's a good chance the mines might collapse if we don't fix 'em up. That wouldn't be good news for anyone, especially not my wallet.

Could you head over and rig up some support beams in the mines? That should do the trick for now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|869|95}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[The Cartels of Undermine Commendation]]
*[[Valorstones]] x9
*[[Weathered Undermine Crest]] x2
*[[Venture Co. Commendation]]

==Progress==
We can't afford to lose those mines to a collapse.

==Completion==
That should buy us some time.

Good work, pal.
