==Objectives==
Collect 6 Handfuls of B.I.R.D. Parts from [[Surveillance B.I.R.D.]]s on the [[Kaja'Coast]].
*[[Handful of B.I.R.D. Parts]] (6)
*[[Bilgewater Auto-Grappler]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] ain't an idiot. He's got those surveillance birds keepin' an eye on this entire area.

We're gonna need to bring 'em offline if we wanna keep a low profile--and by that, I mean smash 'em to itty bitty pieces.

If you need help grabbin' them outta the air, use this auto-grappler. Oh, and scoop some of their parts up for me when you're done. I've got an idea.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I'm not sure why they're watchin' a mine this closely, but we need to make sure they got less eyes on it.

==Completion==
I got this B.I.R.D. mostly gutted.

Between the two of us, we should be able to break these parts down and use 'em to make some new internals.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both Cut the Cameras & [[A Little Insurance]],
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|You handle the security and the bird cameras. Renzik and me will scout ahead.}}
:Monte Gazlowe & [[Renzik "The Shiv"]] ran off.

Use the [[Bilgewater Auto-Grappler]] and take down the [[Surveillance B.I.R.D.]]s & [[Premium Surveillance B.I.R.D.]]s & loot the parts from them.

Head to the nest where [[Gazlowe]] and [[Renzik]] are studying the destroyed B.I.R.D. to turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Looks like these are alarm bots, but they only signal a guard if one's close by.}}

==Progression==
