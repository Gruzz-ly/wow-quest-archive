==Objectives==
Stop the Smellersweller 5000 production at [[Cheap Grillz Inc.|Cheap Grillz]] in [[Hovel Hill]].
*Grill manufacturing halted (0/100%)

==Description==
Our presentation showed that we were the ones that could actually operate the device! If [[Sammy Wrencharm|Sammy]] weren't so focused on the documentation bein' in [[Mite Sparkcog|Mite]]'s hands... Anyone else could clearly see we had made the thing even if we didn't have the schematics! 

But this ain't over. You saw how Mite overloaded the Smellersweller? We can do that too! Punch a bunch of buttons all at once and we can exploit his half-baked, all-stolen idea! 

We go in, we mess up the prototype, an' we set production back months!

==Rewards==
You will receive one of: 
*[[Chainmail of Lost Inspiration]]
*[[Gauntlets of Lost Inspiration]]
*[[Sash of Lost Inspiration]]
*[[Spaulders of Lost Inspiration]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]
* +100 reputation with [[Cartels of Undermine]]

==Progress==
Mite... might actually have a good point there.

==Completion==
Oh, uh. Hi, <name>. Thanks for tearing apart those busted prototypes for us. Here's your cut.

As it turns out, this was all a misunderstandin'. He broke in 'cause he thought I had stolen HIS idea.

An' actually he has had a good idea for the Smellersweller... Smellifier... whatever.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Mite Sparkcog|I'll be on the top floor overseeing construction of MY Smellifier 700 if either of you need me.}}
:{{text|yell|Snap Vellumgrease|It's the Smellersweller 5000, you piece of wet tinder!}}
:{{text|say|Sammy Wrencharm|Ugh. Here we go.}}
:''They all take off.''

Head inside and go upstairs, filling the bar up by slaying [[Prideful Machinist]]s (8%), Sabotaging the [[Half-Finished Grill]] (5%), and slaying [[Grillmaster Evaluator]]s (8%).

On return:
:{{text|say|Mite Sparkcog|If I had made your Smellersweller, I woulda stabilized the scent output so it COULD handle combos!}}
:{{text|say|Snap Vellumgrease|Combos? Are you crazy? That's... that's actually not a bad idea.}}

On complete:
:{{text|yell|Sammy Wrencharm|You two are a headache AND a pain in my payroll! You can't do this every week anymore!}}
:{{text|say|Snap Vellumgrease|Sammy, turns out Mite actually had a good idea for the prototype...}}
:{{text|say|Mite Sparkcog|Yeah! We just need another week to fine-tune our schematics.}}
:{{text|say|Sammy Wrencharm|NO! You're both going on unpaid vacation time for a week to think about what you've done!}}
:{{text|say|Snap Vellumgrease|Well, I guess it would give us time to get our thoughts together on the Smellersweller... Smellifier! Whatever.}}
:{{text|say|Sammy Wrencharm|That's more like it. No more of this rivalry crap, got it? Ya both work for me. Youze on the same team!}}
:{{text|say|Snap Vellumgrease|Sorry, Sammy. An' sorry for gettin' ya involved, <name>. Guess I learned an important lesson.}}
