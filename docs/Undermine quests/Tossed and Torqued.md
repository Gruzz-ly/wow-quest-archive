'''Tossed and Torqued''' begins the optional Copyright Infringement chapter of [[Sojourner of Undermine]], part of the [[Undermine(d) campaign]]. Find [[Snap Vellumgrease]] in [[Hovel Hill]].

==Objectives==
Search [[Snap Vellumgrease]]'s apartment for the schematic in [[Undermine]].
*[[Tossed Papers]] cleared (5)
*[[Big Pile]] searched
*[[Taunting Note]]

==Description==
All my notes. My plans!

<Snap is shaking with anger.>

I just know it was [[Mite Sparkcog]] who tossed my apartment. He's my work rival and probably wanted my newest invention for himself--the Smellersweller 5000!

It's an attachment for the grills we design. I'd just finished the schematic for our boss when I stepped out for some grub. By the time I got back...

Maybe he didn't find it. Help me look first, then we can deal with Mite.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
The schematic is of a muffler-type part that sticks onto a grill. It's so amazin' that you can't miss it!

==Completion==
<Snap crumples up the taunting note.>

Oh, he is not gonna steal my promotion this time!

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Snap Vellumgrease|He ransacked my apartment? I'm gonna melt his tools into slag for this!}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Snap Vellumgrease|My room's on the top floor of this building. It's the one that's been turned upside-down.}}
:{{text|say|Snap Vellumgrease|Look for the schematic, will ya? I'm gonna console myself with my lunch cannoli.}}

Open the door behind him and head up two flights of stairs to the top floor of the restaurant. Many piles of Tossed Papers litter the floor. They all turn up nothing of note, so dig through the [[Big Pile]] and a [[Taunting Note]] turns up!
