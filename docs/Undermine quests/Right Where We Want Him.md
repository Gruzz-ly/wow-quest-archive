==Objectives==
Return to the [[Incontinental Hotel]] and speak with [[Monte Gazlowe|Gazlowe]].

==Description==
Gallywix is down, but he ain't out.

[[The Gallagio]] is built like a fortress. If we want to keep him from threatening [[Undermine]], or [[Azeroth]], we gotta figure out how to get him outta there. Meet me and the other bosses back at the Incontinental Hotel.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
* {{cost|17|55}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Valorstones]]
* +1000 reputation with [[Cartels of Undermine]]

==Completion==
We got the people of Undermine to thank for the opportunity to finally put Gallywix outta business for good.

I ain't gonna waste it.

==Notes==
Upon accept, Monte Gazlowe, [[Grimla Fizzlecrank]], [[Marin Noggenfogger]], [[Baron Revilgaz]], [[Pamsy]], and [[Fleet Master Seahorn]] begin leaving. Head to the Incontinental Hotel and meet up with Gazlowe.

He has gossip:
{{dialogue|We took back Undermine from Gallywix's grubby hands. Now, we blow the doors off the Gallagio and show him once and for all.

It's time do to things the goblin way.}}

Completing this quest ends the uprising phase of Undermine.
