==Objectives==
Compete in Slot Mining at [[Heaps (Undermine)|The Heaps]].
* Grab a Slot Pick
* Chits Acquired
* Leaderboard Checked

==Description==
[[Kayjay]] and [[Fantastic Davey|Davey]] are indeed masters of creating games. They've created a new one for me that's been an absolute hit. 

If you're willing to accept the risk, then I will give you the chance to win their employment, and debt, from me. 

Grab a pickaxe, and enter the landfill. When the whistle blows, you'll compete against all my other "employees." 

Win by the final bell, and I'll let these two go. Lose, and I'll own you. It's called Slot Mining. And it will indebt you to me for life.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Band of the Last Hope
|Ring of the Last Gambit
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
<Tarbonara says nothing. He simply snarls through his shiny teeth.>

==Completion==
You didn't win. Surprise, I guess.

Welcome to Tarbonara's debt circus. The fun never stops...
