==Objectives==
Collect some Semi-Deluxe Noggenfogger Elixirs, then use them to distract 8 [[Stationed Labguard]]s.
*[[Semi-Deluxe Noggenfogger Elixirs]]
*[[Stationed Labguard]]s distracted (8)

==Description==
It really is great to see you and [[Monte Gazlowe|Gazlowe]]! I was just thinkin' about how much I wanted to see you both on my birthday.

A day when I'm under no forms of duress or coercion whatsoever! N-None at all.

<Cautiously, he glances at the Darkfuse guards, then whispers to you.>

I'll tell you whatever I can if you get rid of them.

<He nods subtly towards his alchemy station.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I'll keep an eye on Noggenfogger. You get it done.

==Completion==
Venture and kaja'mite. Two more puzzle pieces.

Let's hope they all fit together eventually.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Maybe your Darkfuse friends would like some drinks.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Marin Noggenfogger]]|I got just the thing.}}
:{{Text|Say|Marin Noggenfogger|Grab 'em off the table and pass 'em around.}}

Some [[Semi-Deluxe Noggenfogger Elixirs]] can be found on the table. Use them to throw them at [[Stationed Labguard]]s.

The potions can cause affected guards to float upward:
*{{text|say|Stationed Labguard|I'm feelin' kinda lightheaded... OH NO!}}
*{{Text|Say|Stationed Labguard|What the--Hey! Woah! Put me down!}}

...turn them into a skeleton:
*{{text|say|Stationed Labguard|Anyone hear that rattlin'? Wait... IT'S ME!}}
*{{Text|Say|Stationed Labguard|Hey, HEY! WHERE'D MY SKIN GO?}}

...or shrink them:
*{{Text|Say|Stationed Labguard|Huh? Why's the ground so close?}}
*{{text|say|Stationed Labguard|Now I know how [[gnome]]s feel!}}

Each potion that hits at least one [[Stationed Labguard]] will also spawn two to three [[Splashed Droplet]]s or an [[Elixir Coagulant]]. Both types of oozes are hostile.

Bumping into a guard while carrying the potions will prompt them to use {{abilities|Back Off|id=470333|icon=ability_kick}}, a knockback ability:
*{{text|say|Stationed Labguard|Back off!}}
*{{text|say|Stationed Labguard|I ain't got time for you!}}
*{{text|say|Stationed Labguard|I'm workin'. Get outta here!}}

Once the objective is complete, return to [[Steamwheedle Laboratories]]:
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Okay, what's going on?}}
:{{Text|Say|Marin Noggenfogger|Check Venture's kaja'mite mines. You'll find answers there.}}

Noggenfogger has new gossip at this point:
{{Dialogue|title=Marin Noggenfogger|
It's not safe to stick around here.
