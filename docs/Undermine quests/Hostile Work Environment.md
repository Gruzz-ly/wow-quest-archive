==Objectives==
Kill Darkfuse to keep the heat off [[Gazlowe]] and [[Renzik]].
*[[Darkfuse Muscle]] slain (5)
*[[Darkfuse Manager]] slain (5)
*[[Compliance Enforcer]] slain (2)
*Meet with Gazlowe at the far side of the Darkfuse camp.

==Description==
Bigger and more dangerous than [[Opportunity Point]]? These south mines sound real bad, even if ya have a high tolerance for bad working conditions. But what are they mining? Something here is worth big money. We'll need to check it out.

I'll head past the big Darkfuse camp with Renzik, stealth mode. Make a big distraction for us, will ya? I'm sure you can slow down production while you're over there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Give us some time!

==Completion==
All eyeballs were on you, that was great. And you brought us a new resource, this [[Zirdo]] fella? Good thinking.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Renzik "The Shiv"|I will use your distraction to learn more.}}
:''Renzik and Monte run off.''

Pick up [[Miner Investigations]] and head out. In the quest area, look out for a [[Dirty Scroll]] that starts [[Order of Magnitude]].

Get to killing five [[Darkfuse Muscle]], five [[Darkfuse Manager|Manager]]s, and two [[Compliance Enforcer]]s.

Once done with the other quests, find Monte just south of camp with the other characters:
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Over here!}}

The collected characters have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Monte Gazlowe|Look, we can't just assume the worst of everybody. Their situation has been bad for years.}}
{{dialogue|title=Renzik "The Shiv"|Trusting this skeezy guy feels like a bad idea, but he could have useful intel.

I'm keeping an eye on him.}}
{{dialogue|title=Zirdo|Ol' Zirdo's here to help.

You just let me know what ya need!}}
{{dialogue|title=Orweyna|If Zirdo can give us more information about this mining operation, I would like to hear it. But I feel we should get moving.}}
