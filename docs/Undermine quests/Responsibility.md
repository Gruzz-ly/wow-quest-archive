My wife was supposed to come with us today as well, but she slipped in the shower! Can you believe that? She'll be at the chiropractor all morning. I feel awful for her. Absolutely awful. 

Welp! Her loss! Let's pack up what we need and I'll drive us all over to the court room!

{{Dialogue|WOW. HI. WOW. YOU'RE NEW, RIGHT?

I'M ATOM ZOOMCART.

I ATE A DECK OF CARDS THIS MORNING AND NOW JC SAYS MY BREATH SMELLS.

{{Gossip|quest=|Do you have your dad's paperwork?}}

:{{text|say|Atom Zoomcart|COLLATE. COLLATE. LOOK AT ME COLLATE.}}
:{{text|say|Atom Zoomcart|BOOM. SEE THAT? DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF ORGANIZATION.}}

Talk to JC Zoomcart:
{{Dialogue|Hello, <name>.

Papa has told me all about you. From what I understand, you're terrible at business.

Pro tip: Stop agreeing to work before payment has been received. It makes you seem desperate.

{{Gossip|quest=|Do you have your dad's paperwork?}}
}}
:{{text|say|JC Zoomcart|I've color-coded the evidence list by priority, and marked all relevant passages in the Gallagio's bylaws.}}
:{{text|say|JC Zoomcart|I've also included my business card. My rates are hourly, and my overtime is triple pay.}}

Speak to Kendo Zoomcart
{{Dialogue|<Kendo peers at you over his heavy tome.>

{{Gossip|quest=|Do you have your dad's paperwork?}}
}}
:''Kendo motions you over to a different bookshelf.''
:''Kendo shuffles through thick tomes and loose documents.''
:''Kendo uses his whole body to pull out the book you'll need.''
:''Kendo return to his own book, giving you a quick glance that says "I thought this person knew how to read, but I clearly overestimated them."''

Talk to Marty:
{{Dialogue|Ready to get a move on?

{{Gossip|quest=|Let's get it moving.}}

:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Alright, kids!}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|It's time for all of us to work the case. Who's ready?}}
:{{text|say|JC Zoomcart|We were waitin' on you, pops!}}
:{{text|say|Atom Zoomcart|Yes! Burn 'em alive!}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|That's wonderful. Now... TO THE CAR!}}

Ride with the Zoomcarts:

:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Alright! Time for a family court recap!}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Today's court case will decide the future of Undermine's casino, the Gallagio.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|After Jastor Gallywix's death, the Gallagio was to be re-opened under the ownership of his nephew, Rosebud Gallywix.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|But the Gallagio lost its owner when Rosebud became murdered as well, resulting in a one-way trip to being placed on the Auction House.}}
:{{text|say|JC Zoomcart|But that's where you and your lackey, <name>, save the day!}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Precisely! We had all of Rosebud's Chief Officers sign the amended deed, and accept ownership as his collective next of kin.}}
:{{text|say|JC Zoomcart|Isn't goblin law just the best?}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|The last step is to present the amended deed to the judge, and have it officially notarized.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Too bad Rosebud's murderer was never revealed...}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Time to get your lawyerin' faces on, everybody!}}
