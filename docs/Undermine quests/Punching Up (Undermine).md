==Objectives==
Defeat the three [[Venture Company|Venture Co.]] loyalist lieutenants.
*[[Foreman Luddy]] slain {{co|43.8|67.8|Undermine}}
*[[Underboss Paulie]] slain {{co|49.4|65.2|Undermine}}
*[[Fusetwister Trish]] slain {{co|50.0|59.8|Undermine}}

==Description==
The time for talking out our differences is over. I'm done second-guessing who is still standing with [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]].

Some of [[Nikki the Fixer|Nikki]]'s people are keeping these new weapons in production. So, we take them out. It makes cleaning up Venture Co. after all this is done way simpler too.

Just be careful. Nikki won't stick her neck out for her lieutenants, but she'll take the chance to rig a fight against you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Had to be done. We're not finished yet.

==Notes==
After picking up both quests, [[Nikki the Fixer]] appears on a roof in the distance:
:{{text|yell|Nikki the Fixer|Ooh, I wonder what this one will do!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Nikki the Fixer takes aim at you...}}
:''Nikki the Fixer fires a Rocket Barrage in a targeted area of effect that will damage and knock back the player if it hits. Grimla Fizzlecrank and [[Pamsy]] run off, and [[Orweyna]] shifts into her bat form and flies off.''
:{{text|yell|Nikki the Fixer|Run, that's right! Run! Ahahaha!}}
:''Nikki flies off.''

Head to the warehouse at {{co|50.0|59.8|Undermine}} where [[Fusetwister Trish]] is waiting upstairs:
:{{Text|Say|Fusetwister Trish|Revolution? Hah! You can't change the way things are!}}

Defeat her:
:{{Text|Say|Fusetwister Trish|New boss, same as the old boss...}}

Further south at {{co|49.4|65.2|Undermine}} to find [[Underboss Paulie]] with [[Heckler]].
:{{Text|Say|Underboss Paulie|Ride or die with Gallywix! You chose die!}}
:{{Text|Say|Nikki the Fixer|Die, die, die!}}

Defeat him:
:{{Text|Say|Underboss Paulie|Damn Grimla...}}

Head west-southwest to {{co|43.8|67.8|Undermine}} where [[Foreman Luddy]] is spewing his Bloodthrower in the yard:
:{{Text|Say|Foreman Luddy|Nothin' burns hotter than this stuff!}}

Nikki the Fixer shoots the Black Blood during this encounter.
:{{Text|Say|Nikki the Fixer|Huuugh! Catch! Ahahaha!}}

Upon slaying the Foreman:
:{{Text|Say|Foreman Luddy|But we were first to market...!}}

With the three loyalists killed:
:{{Text|Say|Jastor Gallywix|They're not stopping! Get back here, now! Defend me!}}
:{{Text|Say|Nikki the Fixer|Haargh! You're spoiling my fun, Jastor!}}
:''Nikki flies off.''

Go to the [[Heaps (Undermine)|Heaps]] and turn in both quests.

On approach:
:{{text|emote|Orweyna snuffs out a flame smoldering on her shoulder with a firm pat.}}

On complete:
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Venture can't change for the better while Nikki's still around.}}
:{{Text|say|Pamsy|I worked on her Executive Package defense matrix. It's almost unbeatable. Almost.}}
