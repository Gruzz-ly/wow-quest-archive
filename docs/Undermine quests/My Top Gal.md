==Description==
We've got Gallywix backed against the wall. Seeing Undermine and its people he's kept under his thumb finally rising up.

He thinks this "Fixer" of his will keep him safe. Let's show Gallywix, Nikki, and everyone else that things are different this time.

<Gazlowe looks over the thingamajig he's just finished jury-rigging.>

Watch this.

==Completion==
Take it all in. We won. Gallywix can squirm away for now, but we took our city from him.

Today, Undermine belongs to us.

On the other side of the cutscene, Baron Revilgaz, [[Fleet Master Seahorn]], Grimla Fizzlecrank, Pamsy, and Marin Noggenfogger stand in front of Monte Gazlowe. [[Jesty Yellapapers]] stands in front of Orweyna who is kneeling near Nikki's corpse.

Orweyna has gossip:
{{Dialogue|This woman wrought destruction on [[Azeroth]] and on [[Goblin|her people]]. I bear her no sympathy. But this crowd will tear her remains limb from limb.

I will see her body returned to the earth, where it may repay Azeroth for a sliver of the harm she committed.}}
