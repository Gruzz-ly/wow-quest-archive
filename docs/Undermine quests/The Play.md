==Objectives==
Steal an Airship Supply Balloon.
*Listen to the plan
*Meet crew at the [[Dirigible Delivery|Airship Station]]
*Follow [[Handsome Crog]]

==Description==
I'm gonna go over the details of the plan.

However, here is the too-long-didn't-listen version:

We meet in front of the Airship Station in [[Tailgate Park|Bilgewater's district]].

Handsome Crog helps get us past the guards to the airship supply balloon there.

We steal that balloon and use it to board the airship over the arena where the safe with all that loot is.

Ready?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
That was the easy part.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|[[Ripsnoodle]]|Okay, Skedgit. What's the gig?}}
:{{Text|Say|Skedgit Cinderbangs|A big safe. Big, airborne, and protected by [[Darkfuse Enforcement|Darkfuse]].}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Goldmine|Pre-Expert Goldmine]]|My [[Magmatooth|earth elemental]] can carry the safe if I give him a cut...}}
:{{Text|Say|Skedgit Cinderbangs|No. Look. Rip, Crog, the muscle, and I will hijack the airship supply balloon. Crog smiles us past the guards and <name> here gnashes anyone who beats Crog's charms.}}
:{{Text|Say|Skedgit Cinderbangs|We ride the balloon up to the airship, Ripsnoodle secures the safe, <name> contends with any Darkfuse.}}
:{{Text|Say|Skedgit Cinderbangs|Then we hit the ground, crack the safe, get the goods. Goldmine, you'll be waiting for us to land and then you drive like we stole it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ripsnoodle|This is a terrible plan. But I do like safes.}}
:{{Text|Say|Pre-Expert Goldmine|I'll bring my totems. Just in case.}}
:{{Text|Emote|Handsome Crog nods, smexily.}}

Head to the [[Dirigible Delivery]] at [[Tailgate Park]]:
:{{Text|Say|Ripsnoodle|This place is crawling with the Fuse. We are going to get pinched just like [[Great Granny Cinderbangs|granny]]!}}
:{{Text|Say|Skedgit Cinderbangs|Hush! Just stick close to Handsome Crog and look less interesting than him.}}

Speak to Handsome Crog:
{{Dialogue|<Handsome Crog shoots you a smoldering-ish stare.>

{{gossip|quest=|Ready. Do your thing.}}
}}

Handsome Crog begins dancing and marching up to the third floor. Follow him where Skedgit Cinderbangs, Goldmine, and Ripsnoodle are waiting at the [[Moneymaker Service Balloon]].
