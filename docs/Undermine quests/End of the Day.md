On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|We're done. I'm tired. We got our friends out, and Gallywix doesn't have the Dark Heart. What else can we do?}}

Speak with Renzik:
{{Dialogue|Gimme a minute with Gazlowe.

I can talk some sense into him.

{{Gossip|quest=|Go ahead.}}}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|All right, pack it up. We're getting everyone topside NOW!}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|No, Gazlowe. We're not going anywhere.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|We freed the hostages. There's no reason to stay.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|We've been over this.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|They're not gonna just up and leave their home like we did.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Undermine ain't worth it, Renzik. We left to find something better.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|You're Monte Gazlowe, damn it. BUILD something better!}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|If anyone can fix this town...}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|it's you.}}

The scene fades to black and an [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cinematic]] starts, "Renzik Sacrifices All":
{{#ev:youtube|evSlYjpnS4g|Renzik Sacrifices All}}
''A laser dot lights up on Gazlowe's neck and inches up to his head. Spotting this, Renzik turns around to look for it's source and spots a glowing red light high on a perch. Through the scope, the sniper has a bead on Gazlowe, with the [[adventurer]] and Renzik nearby. From offscreen, Gallywix gives the order.''

{{Text|Bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Take the shot.}}

''The sniper is [[Nikki the Fixer]], who lets out a soft giggle.''

{{Text|Bossemote|Nikki the Fixer|Catch ya on the flip side, Gazzy.}}

''Nikki pulls the trigger and the bullet fires out of her rifle. Instantly, Renzik dives toward Gazlowe, knocking him out of the way and taking the bullet instead. After banging into a table, Gazlowe looks in shock at Renzik.''

{{Text|Bossemote|Monte Gazlowe|Renzik!}}

''Monte scampers over to Renzik's lifeless corpse, holding the protector in his arms.''

{{Text|Bossemote|Monte Gazlowe|No... no, no, no, no.}}

''Void spreads through Renzik's body, collapsing into smoke, as the bullet was infused with [[Black Blood]]. Nikki lets out some sadistic, maniacal laughter, catching Gazlowe's attention. He turns to look at the sniper nest, but Nikki has escaped. The camera pans left to get the speakers that Jastor has been speaking through in shot:''

{{Text|Bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Kill 'em all!}}

''The residents turn in shock.''

{{Text|Bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Triple hazard pay for whoever brings me Gazlowe's head!}}

''The [[Backup Assassin]]s close in on Monte Gazlowe and the adventurer, and the scene cuts to black.''

On the other side of the cutscene, the Backup Assassins aggro on the adventurer as Gazlowe makes for the [[Scrapshop]].''
:{{Text|Yell|Monte Gazlowe|Keep everyone inside! Get away from the doors!}}

Finish off the assassins, then head inside the Scrapshop:
:{{Text|Say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|What was that! Are you hurt?}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|It's Renzik. He's....he's dead.}}

Everyone inside has gossip:

{{Dialogue|title=[[Fleet Master Seahorn]]|Jastor Gallywix has lived far, far too long.}}
{{Dialogue|title=[[Baron Revilgaz]]|The Shiv's gone, stealing the bullet ment for Gazlowe? Gallywix has gone ten paces too far.}}
{{Dialogue|title=[[Grimla Fizzlecrank]]|Nikki just... I never thought she'd go that far.

Screw this. We can't let Gallywix keep treating this city like it's his. It's not.}}
{{Dialogue|title=[[Marin Noggenfogger]]|Monte nearly had his skull exploded!

Renzik took the bullet for him?!}}
{{Dialogue|title=[[Sprinkle Noggenfogger]]|N-No way... Renzik's dead?!}}
