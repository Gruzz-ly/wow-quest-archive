*Chrome King Gallywix defeated

==Description==
Gallywix has been a stain on Undermine since he forgot where he came from.

Gallywix's always been steppin' on the little guy-greed and always looking for the "next best thing" is just makin him step even harder. Seeking power just for its own sake? Forget that! The power lies with the people.

Let's bring Gallywix some swift justice, <name>.

* [[Enchanted Runed Undermine Crest]]
* [[Void-Touched Valorstone]]
* {{cost|1404}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +1000 [[reputation]] with [[Cartels of Undermine]]

==Completion==
I can't believe it....

==Notes==
Finish Gallywix off and [[The War Within in-game cinematics|a real-time cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|Z9GJ6edEtwc|The fall of Chrome King Gallywix}}

''Interior, the House of Chrome. The Big G falls apart as Trade Prince Gallywix starts screaming angrily. The camera zooms in to his cockpit as he walks to the door. From below, Gallywix pokes his head out, then jumps out of the mech down to the ground, landing unsteadily on his feet.''

{{text|bossemote|Trade Prince Gallywix|Worthless hunk of junk!}}

''He kicks the mech a few times, grunting repeatedly as [[Monte Gazlowe]] and the adventurer look on with concern.''

{{text|bossemote|Monte Gazlowe|Hey.. hold on--}}

{{text|bossemote|Trade Prince Gallywix|It's not over till I say it's over!}}

''Gallywix keeps kicking the mech.''

{{text|bossemote|Trade Prince Gallywix|And I. ALWAYS. WIN!}}

''The mech wobbles on its feet and Monte reaches forward to Gallywix.''

{{text|bossemote|Monte Gazlowe|Look out!}}

''Gallywix yells in shock as he realizes what he's done. The mech explodes! Gazlowe and the rest look incredulously at the situation, as the mech has collapsed in a pile of junk on Gallywix. Gazlowe sighs deeply and turns to walk away.''

{{text|bossemote|Monte Gazlowe|Let's get out of here.}}

''The rest head out as the camera tracks back to show Gallywix apparently dead on his back, his staff a foot from his right hand.''

After the cutscene:
:{{text|say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Oh that's gruesome.}}
:{{text|say|Baron Revilgaz|Yeah... could've been any of us.}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|I don't believe that. None of you are... what Gallywix was.}}
:{{text|say|Marin Noggenfogger|So, uh... what now?}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|We rebuild this place. We start cleanin' up the mess he made.}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|And eventually, we make the world recognize and respect us.}}
:{{text|say|Marin Noggenfogger|All right. I can get behind that.}}
:{{text|say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|Good plan.}}
:{{text|say|Baron Revilgaz|We've got your back if you've got ours.}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Always.}}

Once the raid is finished, head to the [[Steamwheedle Laboratories]] and turn in the quest to Marin Noggenfogger.
