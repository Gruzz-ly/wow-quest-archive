==Objectives==
Test Blood-B-Gone on 8 blood slimes in the [[Writhing Fields]].
*Blood slimes cleaned (8)
*[[Blood-B-Gone]] (provided)

==Description==
Do you have any idea how hard it is to get dried blood stains out of your laundry? Well, you might, I guess.

[[Steamwheedle Cartel|Steamwheedle]]'s finest are working on a new detergent specifically formulated to deal with this pressing issue!

And while the blood fields in the [[Ringing Deeps]] might be bad for the environment, and you, they're the perfect place to field test our latest formulations.

Just give the blood slimes out there a quick hose down and let us know what happens.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*[[The Cartels of Undermine Commendation]]
*[[Steamwheedle Cartel Commendation]]
*[[Valorstones]] x10
*[[Weathered Undermine Crest]] x2

==Progress==
We've got a market to corner here.

==Completion==
Any side effects from exposure? You signed the waiver, if so!
