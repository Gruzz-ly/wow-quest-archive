==Objectives==
Meet [[Gazlowe]] and [[Renzik]] at [[Slam Central Station]], then use the Coastside Drill to travel to the [[Kaja'Coast]].
*Get to [[Slam Central Station]]
*Board the [[Bigz Speedtrack|Coastside Drill]] to travel to [[Zuldazar]] {{co|18.9|52.1|Undermine}}
*Regroup with [[Gazlowe]] and [[Renzik]]

==Description==
Alright, we got the punch card to the [[Kaja'Coast]] and a pretty good reason to believe [[Venture Company|Venture]]'s shmoozin' up to Gallywix a lot more than we thought.

[[Marin Noggenfogger|Noggenfogger]] said we'd find answers at those mines, and that means goin' down to the [[Kaja'Coast]] for a look.

Let's go. We'll meet you over at [[Slam Central Station|Slam Central]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Darkfuse is watchin' this place.

They're hidin' somethin' here. Somethin' big.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Gallywix arms Venture to the teeth. They bring him loads of kaja' mite from Zuldazar, and we got no idea why.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Only one way to find out.}}
:''The collected goblins walk off.''
:{{text|say|Grimla Fizzlecrank|You check the mines. I'll stay here and keep this quiet.}}

Travel to [[Slam Central Station]] where Renzik and Gazlowe are waiting:
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Hey, this one!}}

Monte has gossip:
{{dialogue|I'm guessin' this is our rocket drill to the Kaja'Coast, based on how dodgy the operator's actin'.

{{gossip|What is the Kaja'Coast?}}

A huge kaja'mite mine on the coast of Zuldazar. Yeah, yeah--the name's a little on the nose.

The land is owned by the Zandalari trolls, but I helped work out a deal with them so we could mine here.

I'm not surprised Gallywix snatched it. There's a lot of money in kaja'mite. But is this really just about money?

{{gossip|What is kaja'mite?}}

It's a mineral, a real valuable one. Bright green stuff that sorta smells like how batteries taste.

We break it down into powder so we can put it in drinks and snacks and stuff. Gives goblin ingenuity a little bit of a boost. You can imagine why that'd be popular.}}

Speak with [[Bigz Speedtrack]]:
{{Dialogue|<He looks you over appraisingly, then crosses his arms.>

You don't look like you got business bein' on this drill.

Show me a punch card, or stop wastin' my time.

{{Gossip|Where does this drill go?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Nowhere remotely close to bein' your business.

Now scram.

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}

A [[The War Within in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] starts playing:
:''The Coastside Drill starts up and begins traveling to [[Zuldazar]]''

On the other side of the cutscene, players get dropped off at {{co|22.5|54.2|Zuldazar}} on the western [[Kaja'Coast]] of [[Zuldazar]] alongside [[Monte Gazlowe]], and [[Renzik "The Shiv"]]. Suddenly a [[Darkfuse Security]] hobgoblin and goblin show up:
:{{Text|Say|Darkfuse Security|Hey! You not supposed ta be here!}}
:''The [[Surveillance B.I.R.D.]] flies in at Gazlowe. Renzik kills the hobgoblin.''
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|I got this.}}
:''Renzik kills the goblin as Gazlowe disables the Surveillance B.I.R.D.''
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|The bots got eyes on us! Watch out!}}

Gazlowe also has new dialogue:
{{dialogue|Looks like Darkfuse has got this place on lockdown.}}
