==Description==
My princess deserves only the very best [[Azeroth]] has to offer--and that goes double for her clothes. How else are people supposed'ta know how incredible I think she is?

I got a guy who's hooked me up with an amazin' and rare pelt for my little girl to turn into a fabulous coat. Go meet the guy and bring back the goods. And you better not get anythin' on it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Tick tock!

==Completion==
Hey, that looks swanky! My precious is gonna look amazin' in those feathers!

==Notes==
Head northeast to [[Bilgewater Flats]] and speak with [[Dril Sparkshot]]:

{{dialogue|You need a ride to the Exotics Market?

{{gossip|<Ask for a jetpack to the Exotics Market.>}}}}

This sends players to the upper level of Bilgewater Flats. Speak with [[Grelik Greaseguard]]:
{{dialogue|You look like a discerning customer!

{{gossip|quest=|I'm here for a special pelt?}}

{{gossip|Is that [[Kimi Greaseguard|your kid]] chained up?}}
{{dialogue-child|Yeah, sure is. Kid's got a huge imagination! Last week she was a dragon.

Had to put a stop to that once she figured out how to breathe fire in the house though. 

Insurance premiums, yanno?

{{gossip|But why is she chained?}}

Oh, she's just playing around. It's not locked or anythin'.}}
}}

Pick the quest option and a [[Blazefeather Peacock]] pops out:
Grelik Greaseguard says: Yeah... about that. It's still being used, you see. So, you're gonna need to "collect" it yourself.

Defeat it, then keep heading to [[Blackwater Marina]] for the [[Electric Eel Meat]] from [[Marina Zapper]]s.
