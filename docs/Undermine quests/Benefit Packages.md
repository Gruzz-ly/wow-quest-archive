==Description==
Times are rough, so the [[Cartels of Undermine|cartels]] have been tryin' out this new business strategy called "employee retention." Never heard of it before, but it sounds fancy.

Anyway, I'm pretty sure it means givin' employees the privilege of buyin' stuff from the company stores after you work for 'em long enough.

Go check out what the cartels got for sale. See if anything catches your eye before you start workin'.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You can find the sellers at each cartel's headquarters.

==Completion==
They got some pretty nice selections, don't they?

If you ever need help findin' them again, lemme know.
