==Objectives==
Speak with [[Dirk Greasedealer]] in [[Tailgate Park]].
* Begin the Revolution

==Description==
You all saw what [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] can do. These weapons, this [[Black Blood]]--we have to cut him off at the source. [[Baron Revilgaz|Revilgaz]], you've gotta kill their shipments coming out of your HQ. And [[Grimla Fizzlecrank|Grimla]], [[Venture Company|Venture Co.]] has to be involved for [[Nikki the Fixer]] to be so well-armed. Split up.

<Name>, I want you with me. I've got a newsman, Dirk, you'll want to talk to in [[Tailgate Park]]. We'll need hearts and minds to take back this city. I'll be there soon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
It's bedlam out here! But if Gazlowe's got a plan, I'm with him!

On accept, a confirmation window appears:

{{Dialogue|Kick off a revolution in Undermine? Regular activities temporarily won't be available.}}

Hit yes to change the phase and start the revolution:
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Undermine needs to know what Gallywix has done. Split up, tell your people that we're taking back this city.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grimla FIzzlecrank|You heard the man! Let's move!}}
:''Grimla Fizzlecrank leaves, followed by Baron Revilgaz then [[Fleet Master Seahorn]].''
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|I'll meet you at Tailgate Park, <name>, Just, something to handle first. It's gotta be me.}}
:''[[Marin Noggenfogger|Marin]] and [[Sprinkle Noggenfogger]] leave as Gazlowe walks towards the remains of [[Renzik "The Shiv"]] kneeling before it.''

Monte has gossip:
{{dialogue|<Gazlowe wears a stoic expression as he gathers Renzik's ashes. He doesn't look away from his work as you approach.>

Go on ahead, champ. The people need you. I'll catch up.}}

While in this phase, players are debuffed with:
:{{Abilities|Revolution!|A revolution is underway! Regular Undermine activities are unavailable! Talk to [[Primrose Crankshaft]] outside the [[Incontinental Hotel]] in the center of Undermine to reschedule the revolution.|id=1214346|icon=achievement_goblinheaddead}}

[[Primrose Crankshaft]] is located at {{co|42.7|47.3|Undermine}} outside the northern corner of the Incontiental:
{{dialogue|Primrose Crankshaft, Undermine's premier riot manager and scheduler, at ya service.

{{gossip|I'd like to pause the uprising for the moment.}}}}

This pops up another confirmation prompt:
{{dialogue|This will prevent you from being able to complete the campaign until you return and restart the uprising. Continue?}}

Players can resume the revolution by speaking with her once more:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|I'd like to restart the uprising against Gallywix.}}}}

Head to [[Tailgate Park]] and speak with [[Dirk Greasedealer]]:
:{{text|say|Dirk Greasedealer|Ain't you a sight for sore eyes! Gazlowe sending in the big guns means it's about to get serious.}}
