:{{Text|Say|Nikki the Fixer|And here I thought I'd have to come hunting for you! How's Renzik doin'? Ahaha!}}

Speak with Monte Gazlowe:
{{Dialogue|I need you on this, <Name>. You ready?

{{Gossip|quest=|I've got your back.}}}}

:''Nikki spews in two [[Vile Refuse]] that aggro on the player.''
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|You want me dead, is that it? Then c'mon, take your shot! I'm right here!}}
:{{text|say|Nikki the Fixer|And here I thought I'd have to come hunting for you! How's Renzik doin'? Ahaha!}}
:''Nikki flies off from Monte's surprise attack.''
:{{text|say|Nikki the Fixer|Aaw! What's the hurry? Can't you see how much fun I'm having?!}}
:{{text|emote|Monte Gazlowe grimaces up at Nikki as his Pocket Deth Lazor cools off.}}

Fend them off, then Nikki spawns in three more:
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Renzik was a hundred times the goblin you are! We're done with Gallywix and his cronies!}}
:''Nikki flies back to where she was''.
:{{text|say|Nikki the Fixer|What are you gonna do about it?! We have the Black Blood! You're outgunned! Ahahaha!}}

Fend them off as well, then Nikki spawns in [[Gatgloop]]:
:{{text|say|Nikki the Fixer|Aah! Was that my last one? Oh well, time to restock. Kill you next time! Ta-ta!}}
:''Nikki flies off.''

Finish off Gatgloop:
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|She's right about one thing. We gotta deal with their Black Blood or it won't matter how many people rise up.}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|I'll handle things here. Go find Noggenfogger and Revilgaz at the waterfront!}}

Head to [[Blackwater Marina]] where Baron Revilgaz, [[Marin Noggenfogger]], and [[Fleet Master Seahorn]] are awaiting.

On complete:
:{{Text|Say|Fleet Master Seahorn|Darkfuse will pay! I'll serve your eviction notice personally, Captain!}}
:''Fleet Master Seahorn runs out.''
:{{Text|Say|Baron Revilgaz|Oi, Seahorn! Don't get yerself killed! That's an order!}}
:{{Text|Yell|Fleet Master Seahorn|RRRRRRGHHHHHHHAAA!}}
:''Fleet Master Seahorn charges and knocks out several Darkfuse''.
:{{Text|Emote|Baron Revilgaz wipes his hand down his face.}}
