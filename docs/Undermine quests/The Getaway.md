==Completion==
Look, I'm sorry if you got your hopes up about the loot. I just..

I couldn't get my granny out of the clutches of those Darkfuse without help. And people don't just DO things for free or because it's a good deed.

So... um... here. It's all I got and you earned it.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{Text|Say|[[Goldmine|Pre-Expert Goldmine]]|Wait a minute! Skedgit... that isn't your great gran is it?}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Great Granny Cinderbangs]]|Skedgit? You brought your ex as a getaway driver? He got me pinched!}}
:{{Text|Say|Skedgit Cinderbangs|Get in the car, Gran!}}

Interact with Goldmine's Getaway Wheels and the adventurer, Skedgit, Great Granny Cinderbangs, Goldmine, and [[Ripsnoodle]] hop on:
:{{Text|Say|Pre-Expert Goldmine|It's the Fuse! Hang on!}}
:{{Text|Say|Skedgit Cinderbangs|<Name>! Use the bucket of boomballs!}}
:{{Text|Say|Ripsnoodle|Hey! Those were mine!}}

The vehicle interface changes to have one ability: {{Abilities|Boomball|id=459754|icon=inv_misc_pyriumgrenade}}. Fill the bar by using the boomballs on the [[Darkfuse Rider]]s (8%) & the [[Darkfuse Pursuit Mech]]s (15%).

After filling the bar to 100%:
:{{Text|Say|Ripsnoodle|We're out of boomballs! Get us out of here.}}
:{{Text|Say|Pre-Expert Goldmine|Oh? I should get us out of here? I never considered that.}}
:{{Text|Yell|Pre-Expert Goldmine|HOLD ON!}}

A ton of Darkfuse Pursuit Mechs and [[Darkfuse Re-grabber]]s appear:
:{{Text|Say|Skedgit Cinderbangs|Ahead of us!}}
:{{Text|Say|Great Granny Cinderbangs|Still ahead of us!}}
:{{Text|Say|Pre-Expert Goldmine|Hold on!}}
:{{Text|Yell|Ripsnoodle|Aaaaaaaaahhhh!}}
:{{Text|Yell|Skedgit Cinderbangs|AAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaahhhh!}}
:{{Text|Yell|Great Granny Cinderbangs|HAHAHAHAHA!}}

Goldmine drives through the [[Incontinental Hotel]] but the Darkfuse Re-grabber appears:
:{{Text|Say|Great Granny Cinderbangs|They're still on us. What kind of rescue is this?}}
:{{Text|Say|Skedgit Cinderbangs|<Name>! Toss those totems at them!}}
:{{Text|Say|Pre-Expert Goldmine|What?! My totems!}}

The vehicle UI now shows four totems:
*{{Abilities|Goldmine's Overused Air Totem|id=472371|Throw Goldmine's Overused Air Totem at an enemy for an unknown effect.|icon=spell_nature_windfury}}
*{{Abilities|Goldmine's Repaired Fire Totem|id=472260|Throw Goldmine's Repaired Fire Totem at an enemy to summon Magmatooth.|icon=spell_fire_elemental_totem}}
*{{Abilities|Goldmine's New Earth Totem|id=472230|Throw Goldmine's New Earth Totem at an enemy for an unknown effect.|icon=spell_nature_earthelemental_totem}}
*{{Abilities|Goldmine's Sketchy Water Totem|id=472221|Throw Goldmine's Sketchy Water Totem at an enemy for an unknown effect.|icon=inv_waterelementalmount}}

Upon throwing Goldmine's Overused Air Totem:
:{{Text|Say|Great Granny Cinderbangs|Ah! It is shooting faster!}}
:{{Text|Say|Pre-Expert Goldmine|This is NOT how shamanism is supposed to work.}}

Upon throwing Goldmine's Repaired Fire Totem:
:{{Text|Say|Pre-Expert Goldmine|Not that one! I just made my last payment to him.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Magmatooth]]|Undermine? I hate this place too!}}

Upon throwing Goldmine's New Earth Totem:
:{{Text|Say|Ripsnoodle{{sic}}|No! I just got him!}}
:{{Text|Say|Skedgit Cinderbangs|Don't worry. He'll be fine...maybe.}}

Upon throwing Goldmine's Sketchy Water Totem:
:{{Text|Say|Ripsnoodle|Wait? Is that MY water elemental?}}
:{{Text|Say|Stolen Mage Water Elemental|AAAAAAAAAAAAΑΑΑΑΑΑΑHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! What is happening?!}}
:{{Text|Say|Pre-Expert Goldmine|I was experimenting. Okay?!}}

The gang arrived at the [[Entrepreneur Inc.]]
:{{Text|Say|Skedgit Cinderbangs|Okay. I think we are as clear as we ever will be! Let's get back to HQ!}}

Several characters have gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Great Granny Cinderbangs|Skedgit put together one oddball but functional crew.

I'll need to keep you all in mind after I plan my get-even-with-the-Darkfuse heist. Granted, that's gonna take a while but don't think for a second I'm not planning on getting even.

Anyway, thanks for springing me. I owe you one.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Ripsnoodle|I was NOT expecting Gran to be the 'big score' in this case.

Had Skedgit just told me I probably would have signed up anyway.

Do I miss the loot I was promised? Yes! But Gran deserves better than to be clinched up by the Darkfuse.

I know Skedgit meant well. She probably thought I wouldn't agree to this if I wasn't getting paid. That... that might be on me.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Goldmine|Okay! Great Granny Cinderbangs is on the loose again and me helpin' get her out puts me in the clear.

I mean, I probably didn't need the lie about money to get my hopes up. I was already ready to do this gig as a favor to Skedgit. Had I known it was her gran in that safe, well, I would have signed up even faster.}}

On complete:
:{{Text|Say|Great Granny Cinderbangs|Skedgit, <Name>, you were great! Thanks for springing me.}}
:{{Text|Say|Great Granny Cinderbangs|Ripsnoodle, that was terrible. Learn a fireball at least like a proper mage like your cousin Tinkblast.}}
:{{Text|Say|Ripsnoodle|Just like all those mages you knew back in the [[Second War|second war]]? I need to be back at the boomball course before the Darkfuse start looking.}}
:''Ripsnoodle leaves returning to the [[Emerald Hills Golf Course]].''
