==Objectives==
Regroup with [[Gazlowe]] in [[Steamwheedle Laboratories]].
*Speak to Gazlowe inside the laboratory

==Description==
We cannot let the ethereals find the [[Dark Heart]] before we do.

Gazlowe needs to be informed. We must gather our forces and find the Dark Heart--quickly!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
If Gallywix has got the Dark Heart in his warehouse, then we need to get to that warehouse.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|We must tell Gazlowe. We will need our full forces if we are to find the Dark Heart before the ethereals do.}}

Go the [[Steamwheedle Laboratories]] and meet up with [[Gazlowe]] and the party.
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Why'd they attack you, Marin?}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Marin Noggenfogger]]|I know everything. The warehouse, the kaja'mite, the Dark Heart bein' kept there.}}

Speak to Gazlowe:
{{Dialogue|You guys get rid of those ethereals?

{{Gossip|quest=|The Dark Heart is in Undermine. The ethereals are trying to find it before us.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|You could have told us!}}
:{{Text|Say|Marin Noggenfogger|Uh uh. Gallywix has [[Sprinkle Noggenfogger|my wife]] in that warehouse! I couldn't talk. }}
:''The void portal appears and [[Phase-Thief Azir]] appears as Gazlowe and Alliera turns to him.''
:{{Text|Say|Phase-Thief Azir|Ah, but you just did. We'll be retrieving the Dark Heart now. My apologies.}}
:''Alleria fires a shot at Azir, to apparently no effect. The etherael laughs as he disappears.''
:{{Text|Say|Phase-Thief Azir|<laughs>}}
