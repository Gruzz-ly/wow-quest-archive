'''Sour Victory''' concludes the fourth chapter of the [[Undermine(d) campaign]], "Breaking the Shackles". The next chapter, "Ignite the Fuel of Change", begins the week of 4 March 2025 with [[End of the Day]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Gazlowe]] at the [[Scrapshop]] in [[Bilgewater Flats]].

==Description==
That's it. It's over. We're done.

[[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] lost, but the ethereals got the [[Dark Heart]].

[[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] needs to track them down. We need to check on everyone back at Bilgewater Flats, and then we need to go. There's nothin' else in this town for us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Valorstones]]
* +1000 reputation with [[Cartels of Undermine]]

==Completion==
<Gazlowe keeps his arms crossed, staring at some spot of nothing in the distance.>

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Gallywix was repairing the Dark Heart for Xal'atath. But it seems she lost her patience with him and sent the ethereals to collect.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Maybe he was tryin' to keep the Dark Heart once he fixed it, for some reason.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Who cares? We're done here. Let's go.}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Gazlowe, we got him on the ropes. We can...}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|We can ditch this town, like we shoulda from the start.}}
:''Monte Gazlowe leaves''
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Alleria?}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I have to chase the Dark Heart. I am sorry.}}
:''Alleria walks out.''
:{{text|emote|Renzik sighs quietly.}}
:''Renzik walks away.''

Head to the [[Bilgewater Flats]] where Renzik is trying to console Monte Gazlowe:
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|You had our backs all the way here. I won't forget that.}}

Renzik has gossip:
{{Dialogue|Gimme a minute with Gazlowe.

I can talk some sense into him.}}

Some of the other people gathered in the [[Scrapshop]] have new gossip's as well. By the entrance:
{{Dialogue|title=Grimla Fizzlecrank|I heard the news. The doohickey got stolen.

Guess it's time I start looking for something new. I know you tried, <name>, but what can we do now? We're cooked. Maybe I can drill for oil in Northrend or something.

<Grimla turns her gaze away and offers a bitter sigh.>

I should go find Pamsy.}}

Inside, on the first floor:
{{Dialogue|title=Baron Revilgaz|Pleased as I am to see my Fleet Master safe, untangling the Port Authority and my marina from Gallywix's clutches won't be easy. 

At least I'll be able to speak my mind about Jastor from now on. I intend to. Loudly. And often.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Fleet Master Seahorn|I pledge that no Darkfuse will persist safely in any body of water so long as I live.

I need a drink.}}

Inside, on the second floor:
{{Dialogue|title=Marin Noggenfogger|No offense pal, but can I get a little space? I'm trying to catch up with the wifey if you get my meaning.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Sprinkle Noggenfogger|Sorry, Marin gets all embarrassed if anyone sees him getting his chin scratched. Do you mind? 

Thanks again for the rescue!}}
