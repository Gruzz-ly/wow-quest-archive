==Objectives==
Meet with [[Renzik]] and [[Gazlowe]] at the next Black Blood depot in the [[Heaps (Undermine)|Heaps]].

==Description==
Blackwater is just one step on the journey, and they like to keep this stuff moving. [[Revilgaz]] has his people take it from the station, hide it for a bit, then deliver it to the drop sites. The drop sites change, but the current one is a depot in the Heaps.

We're gonna check it out and find out where the [[Black Blood]] goes from there.

He says it's guarded, so look for us out near the edge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
That's a lot of guards. We're on to something.

==Notes==
Upon accept;
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|I don't like this. I'm getting a closer look.}}
:''Gazlowe and Renzik start leaving.''
:{{Text|Say|[[Baron Revilgaz]]|Don't start too much trouble. I don't want any blowback from this.}}

Head to the Heaps and meet up with [[Gazlowe]] & [[Renzik]].
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|I caught sight of our pal Zirdo when scouting the depot.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|I was hoping to never see him again after the [[Ringing Deeps]].}}

[[Gazlowe]] has a gossip:
{{dialogue|The engines on these couriers' bikes are still hot. Renzik and me are gonna keep an eye out for the couriers while you investigate the depot.}}
