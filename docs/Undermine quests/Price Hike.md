'''Price Hike''' concludes the "Uncovering the Truth" chapter of the [[Undermine(d) campaign]]. Chapter four, "Breaking the Shackles", begins with the direct follow-ups: [[Ethereal Invasion]] & [[Phase Shift (quest)]].

==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Overseer Dritz.png|[[Overseer Dritz]]|Gallywix is importing kaja'mite to Undermine to repair the Dark Heart. Killing his overseer should halt the transport.}}

Slay Overseer Dritz, then meet up with Gazlowe in [[Undermine]].
*[[Overseer Dritz]] slain
*Ride [[Spare Evacuation Rocket|rocket]] back to the [[Coastside Drill Control Panel|Coastside Drill]] (Optional)
*Meet [[Gazlowe]] at the [[Vatworks]]

==Description==
So [[Marin Noggenfogger|Noggenfogger]] wasn't lyin'. Darkfuse strongarmed Steamwheedle into figurin' out how to make [[kaja'mite]] contain [[Black Blood]]. Looks like that's how they've been gettin' it into weapons without blowin' themselves up--or worse.

These stakes are higher than I thought. and I get the feeling this goes even deeper. I need to get Noggenfogger somewhere safe. You and [[Renzik]] take out that overseer, then meet us back at Steamwheedle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Turbo-Drain 5000]]
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Damn it--Noggenfogger's hurt real bad.

First Darkfuse, now ethereals. What could they possibly want with Steamwheedle?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Gazlowe, get back to Undermine and tell [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] what we know. We'll deal with the Overseer and catch up.}}
:''Monte Gazlowe runs off back to the coastside drill.''

Head to the port of [[Kaja'Coast]] and begin to aggro [[Overseer Dritz]].

:{{Text|Say|Overseer Dritz|I'll send you back to Undermine in an ashtray!}}

;Upon killing him
:{{Text|Say|Overseer Dritz|The warehouse.... The hostages... [[Jastor Gallywix|He]] already knows...}}
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Hostages? We need to get back to Noggenfogger. C'mon!}}

Take the rocket to the Coastside Drill and interact with the [[Coastside Drill Control Panel]] and a real-time cutscene plays:
:''The Coastside Drill starts up and begins traveling to [[Slam Central Station]]''

Head to the [[Vatworks]] where [[Monte Gazlowe]] is tending to [[Marin Noggenfogger]] as [[Alleria Windrunner]] & [[Grimla Fizzlecrank]] are protecting them from the [[Ethereal Warpblade]]s.
:{{Text|Say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Hey! What happened here?}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|We were ambushed by ethereals. [[Xal'atath]]'s minions, no doubt.}}
:''Renzik gets into his stance preparing to fight.''
