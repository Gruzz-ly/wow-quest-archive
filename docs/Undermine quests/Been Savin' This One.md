==Objectives==
Collect Limes from the Resort Staff at the [[Blackwater Marina]].
*[[Sliced Lime]] (12)

==Description==
Listen <name>, [[Sprinkle Noggenfogger|Sprinkle]]'s been cooking something for a long time that I'm finally ready to cash in. A little alchemist's secret ingredient. Citrus! Delivers twice the kick of Noggenfogger's Restorative Elixirs at half the speed. Strengthens your bones, grows your muscles, does your [[tax]]es. The whole nine yards!

Problem is, I've got nothing of the sort on hand. These resort types may have what you need. We've been saving this recipe for a heavy hitter. Make sure Seahorn's alright before cooking it up, yeah?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Ngh. Did they get me with that [[Black Blood]]?

==Completion==
Limes? What's all this then? We're at war with far worse than scurvy!

==Notes==
After picking up both quests, collect the [[Sliced Lime]] from slaying [[Darkfuse "Waiter"|Darkfuse "Waiters"]], interacting with the [[Overpriced Tropical Punch]]es & asking the [[Frustrated Vacationer]]s all over [[Blackwater Marina]].

{{dialogue|title=Frustrated Vacationer|
*Did I just see a tauren wearing a pirate hat charge through here? What are they putting in this jungle juice...
*As if the resort prices weren't bad enough, now people are shouting about a revolution in the streets?
*I am NOT letting the overthrow of our government interrupt this vacation.
*Can't we delay the revolution one day? Pretty please?

:{{text|say|Frustrated Vacationer|Sure. The drinks were better when Blackwater was in charge.}}

Once that is done, head to [[Port Authority (Undermine)|Port Authority]] where Fleet Master Seahorn is injured:
:{{Text|Say|Fleet Master Seahorn|Urgh... One of those scurvy dogs got me good.}}
Speak to him to turn in both quests.
