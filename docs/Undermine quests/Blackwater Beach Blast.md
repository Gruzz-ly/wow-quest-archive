==Objectives==
Meet [[Marty Zoomcart]] at [[Blackwater Marina]].

==Description==
You've done good work with [[Jojo Gobdre|Jojo]]. Real good.

I'll stick around, seal the deal, then meet you over at Blackwater Marina for the final signature.

Had my radio turned to WGOB 101.1 FM while dropping off the fifteen landfill-scented individuals earlier. [[Baron Revilgaz|DJ B. B. Rev]] announced there would be a battle of the bands at the marina today.

Wouldn't you know it. [[Rosebud Gallywix|Rosebud]]'s [[Chancellor Gnome|Chief Executive of Entertainment]] is playing! The band you're looking for is the [[Cellar Gnomes]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
I tried to speak to Gnome over here, but she's pretty distracted.

You take a crack and see how things go.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|So, chef! You'll sign the new Gallagio deed?}}
:{{text|say|Jojo Gobdre|If it means getting the Chiefs back to the Gallagio, you bet. I still got the same title?}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Last thing--you promise you're not the one who exploded Rosebud Gallywix?}}
:{{text|say|Jojo Gobdre|You serious? No! But would anyone actually tell you if they were the murderer?}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|No, chef. But my wife likes to tell me there's no harm in asking.}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Plus I'm a very good judge of character. And you, chef, have fabulous character.}}
:{{text|say|Jojo Gobdre|You... you're a funny little goblin, aren't you?}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Yes, chef. Yes, I am.}}

Upon catching up with Marty at the Blackwater Marina where Chancellor Gnome is talking to Baron Revilgaz (DJ B. B. Rev):
:{{text|say|Chancellor Gnome|Revilgaz! What gives? Why are we first in the line up today? The crowd will be empty!}}
:{{text|say|DJ B. B. Rev|C'mon, Gnomey. You were hot like an Aspect's belch when you were still part of the Gallagio.}}
:{{text|say|DJ B. B. Rev|Now you're barely warm as an Earthen's lunch. At least you're still playing!}}
:{{text|say|Chancellor Gnome|You're a prince, Rev. You know that? A real, true toad-looking prince.}}
:{{text|say|Event Coordinator|Heh. Heh. Heh.}}
