==Objectives==
Talk to 5 Slimedivers in [[Vatworks|The Vatworks]].
*Goggles distributed (5)

==Description==
My mentor [[Senior Slimediver Boxenkle|Enkle]] may be the loudest voice around here, but he's not the only one who needs help.

Our whole crew only listens to him! Which means no one's wearing proper protective equipment.

Take these goggles and convince everyone to take 'em on a trial run. Maybe if they all start changing their minds, Enkle will listen.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Have you found enough residue from the oozing salvage?

Make sure to get the really nasty stuff. You know, the stuff that sticks to you but also melts your skin?

==Completion==
<Kazzandra cheers.>

Finally! Everyone's here, and they're all wearing goggles. Enkle had better listen to me this time!

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Senior Slimediver Boxenkle|Listen, Kazzandra. I've never needed goggles before and I don't need 'em now!}}
:{{text|say|Slimediver Kazzandra|We all need goggles, Enkle! The slimes ain't safe no more!}}

After picking up both quests:
:{{text|say|Slimediver Kazzandra|Enkle, wouldya at least TRY the goggles once? I want you to be safe!}}
:{{text|say|Senior Slimediver Boxenkle|Why're you worried about safety? I thought you were a real slimediver, Kazzandra.}}
:{{text|say|Senior Slimediver Boxenkle|We live for the cuts, scrapes, burns, and bruises! An' I can see fine, thank you.}}

Head to [[Slimediver Kwetzil]] who is nearby the slime.{{co|39.6|87.2|Undermine}}
{{Dialogue|What do you want? I'm busy salvaging slimes out here.

The toxic waves coming off this thing? No big deal. I've dealt with worse!

<Kwetzil sniffs. His eyes are bloodshot.>

{{Gossip|quest=|Would you take these goggles for a test run?}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Slimediver Kwetzil|Are you serious? I mean, I'll do it if you really want me to...}}
:''Kwetzil leaps into the [[Insatiable Slime]]''
:{{Text|Say|Slimediver Kwetzil|Hey, I found my car keys! Lookit all this stuff in here! Was it here all along?}}
:''The Insatiable Slime dies out & Kwetzil walks to Kazzandra.''

Head to [[Slimediver Fen]] and speak with him.
{{Dialogue|Say what? You want me to buy cheese nozzles? Heck no.

<Fen shakes his head like a dog. Slime goes everywhere.>

Sorry, I think I might have gotten slime in my ear last dive. You were sayin'?

{{Gossip|quest=|Would you take these goggles for a test run?}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Slimediver Fen|That makes a lot more sense than cheese nozzles. Sure, one sec...}}
:''Fen jumps into the Instiable Slime.''
:{{Text|Say|Slimediver Fen|Oh, it's kinda nice to get a break from the stingin' and oozin' in my eyes. Thanks.}}
:''The Insatiable Slime dies out & Fen leaves.''

Head to [[Slimediver Twudol]] and speak to her.
{{Dialogue|Watch your step, watch your step! It's real dark out here these days.

You could smoosh any little oozling if you're not careful.

May I help you, uh, <class>? You're a <class>, aren't you?

{{Gossip|quest=|Would you take these goggles for a test run?}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Slimediver Twudol|Are they stylish? Do they have little slime decals? Lemme see...}}
:''Twudol jumps into the Instiable Slime.''
:{{Text|Say|Slimediver Twudol|Oh! My little oozlings! I can see you so well now! An' it's not dark in here anymore!}}
:''The Insatiable Slime dies out & Twudol leaves.''

Head to [[Senior Slimediver Glinkee]] and speak to her.
{{Dialogue|I'm supervisor around here. Can you kindly point me in the direction of the other slimedivers?

{{Gossip|quest=|Would you take these goggles for a test run?}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Senior Slimediver Glinkee|I dunno what good it'll do, but sure. Just give me a second.}}
:''Glinkee jumps into the Instiable Slime.''
:{{Text|Say|Senior Slimediver Glinkee|Wow, I can see outside of the slime with these on, too! I need my own pair.}}
:''The Insatiable Slime dies out & Glinkee leaves.''

Head to [[Senior Slimediver Welqart]] who is nearby the slime.
{{Dialogue|None of the other slimes are this... pungent! This fresh!

Only the freshest slimes make ya nose hairs burn an' ya eyes water.

{{Gossip|quest=|Would you take these goggles for a test run?}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Senior Slimediver Welqart|They won't stop up my nose, will they? I need it to find loot.}}
:''Welqart leaps into the [[Insatiable Slime]]''
:{{Text|Say|Senior Slimediver Welqart|Well, whaddaya know! My eyes are better than my nose for once.}}
:''The Insatiable Slime dies out & Kwetzil leaves.''

Once that is done, head to [[Slimediver Kazzandra]] to turn both quests in. On complete of both:
:{{Text|Say|Slimediver Kazzandra|Enkle, this residue from the slimes has high levels of XTR-31. It's nearly all acid!}}
:{{Text|Say|Slimediver Kazzandra|Everyone needs to wear goggles--includin' you.}}
:{{Text|Say|Senior Slimediver Boxenkle|You're all gangin' up on me for no reason! We've never needed goggles to do our jobs. And I'll prove it!}}
:{{Text|Say|Senior Slimediver Boxenkle|[[Causticaria]] is mine!}}
:''Senior Slimediver Boxenkle runs off''
:{{Text|Say|Senior Slimediver Glinkee|The motherlode slime? Well, he's not coming to work tomorrow.}}
:{{Text|Say|Slimediver Kazzandra|Enkle, wait!}}
