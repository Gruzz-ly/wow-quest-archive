==Objectives==
Kill 12 Underrider biker gang members.
*Underrider slain (12)

==Description==
It's bad enough that the old skinflint landlord is letting this place slowly fall apart, but now we got even bigger problems.

Recently, those would-be gangsters up the road, the Underriders, went from petty theft and noise complaints to being a heavily armed menace. They've started trashing the place, and even attackin' us directly!

What's worse, anyone who can't afford to move out are evicted for the damage those thugs caused instead.

You keep us safe, you can crash here free of charge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I can't keep up with all these repairs. Someone needs to do something about those bikers!

==Completion==
You're back.

<Keara winces from her injuries.>

Your timing coulda been better.

==Notes==
On accept of both quests:
:{{text|emote|Gabi's eyes spill over with tears.}}
:{{text|say|[[Mama Keara]]|Hey hey, no cryin' now. <Name> will take care of this.}}
:{{text|emote|Gabi mutters something under her breath.}}
:{{text|say|Mama Keara|Nonsense. They're a big strong <class>. They probably won't die.}}
:{{text|say|Mama Keara|Probably.}}
:{{text|emote|Gabi shudders in horror.}}

Head to [[Venturewood]], then slay the [[Underrider Pillager]]s, [[Underrider Brawler]]s, [[Underrider Pyromaniac]]s, and [[Underrider Roadhog]]s. While in the area, look out for the [[Weapons Cache (Undermine)|Weapons Cache]], which starts [[Weapons Cash]].

Once all tasks are done, return to [[Barrelbottom Apartments]] and turn all three quests. Mama has lost a fight and Gabi is nowhere to be seen:
{{dialogue|<Mama Keara is covered head to toe in injuries. Whoever attacked her made it personal.>

Don't worry about me, we need to stop whoever caused all of this!}}
