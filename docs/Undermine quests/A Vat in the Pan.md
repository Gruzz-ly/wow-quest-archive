==Objectives==
Meet Marty Zoomcart in The [[Vatworks]].
*Use the [[DeLux L-A-Vator]]

==Description==
Our next mark is [[Jojo Gobdre]], in the Vatworks. 

She was a big time chef. The real deal. And running cuisine at the [[Gallagio]] woulda meant franchise opportunities. Is there a reason she'd want [[Rosebud Gallywix|Rosebud]] dead? 

Either way, we need a lead on where she's cooking these days. Luckily, I got an [[Marin Noggenfogger|ol' pal]] who should have info. He's a little bit of a big shot for [[Steamwheedle]], but we should be able to find him on his rooftop hideaway. We'll meet there. Come hungry.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Take a seat if you want, <name>!

Have you met my pal Noggy before? Me and him go way back. We were roommates back in Commerce College.

Got up to some real crazy hijinks--but, uh, nothing worth bringing up now.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Everyone strapped in?}}
:{{text|say|Marty Zoomcart|Time to prove to my kids that carpooling is fantastic for the undervironment!}}

Go to the Vatworks and reach the top of a building there to see Marty relaxing with Marin Noggenfogger.
