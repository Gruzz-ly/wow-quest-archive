==Objectives==
Reclaim the [[Port Authority (Undermine)|Port Authority]] from [[Darkfuse Solutions|Darkfuse]] forces.
*Black Blood Smugglers slain (12)

==Description==
Hah! I've never been feeling better! Now, we seize back what rightfully belongs to Blackwater, <name>.

They've turned our prized headquarters into a smuggler's cove for that foul sludge. There are too many crates of [[Black Blood]] to deal with right now, but they can't move their cargo without fresh bodies. Let's cut them down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
There's blood to spill!

==Completion==
[[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] should know better than to cross sabers with Blackwater after this.

==Notes==
After accepting both quests:
:{{Text|Say|Fleet Master Seahorn|Darkfuse has been using us to bring in these shipments! It ends now!}}

Fleet Master Seahorn will accompany the party. Head to [[Castaway Cove]] and slay [[Darkfuse Dockworker]]s, [[Dockside Racketeer]]s, & [[Darkfuse Muscle]]s.

==Progression==
