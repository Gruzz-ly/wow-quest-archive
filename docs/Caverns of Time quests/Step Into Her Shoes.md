==Objectives==
Enter the Time Rift with [[Timeweaver Delormi]].
*Enter the [[Jeweled Estate Time Rift|Time Rift]]

==Description==
Another one of those rifts. Normally I'd repair it, but given the circumstances I wish to see where it leads.

It isn't often I commune with versions of myself from other threads of [[time]]. But one particular self has been a dear friend for some time.

I feel myself growing weaker. If she perishes...

We don't have much time. We need to enter this rift now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must hurry--I fear the worst, otherwise.

==Completion==
What...what's happening?!

==Notes==
Walk into the rift to be teleported to the [[Jeweled Estate]] in [[Suramar]].

==Progression==
{{A Friend in Needle}}

==Patch changes==
