Bring the [[:Invitation from the Timewalkers]] to [[Chromie]] within the [[Caverns of Time]].

==Description==
The time has arrived to remember the past and celebrate our adventures across [[Azeroth]] and Beyond.

To commemorate the occasion the [[Bronze dragonflight|Bronze Dragonflight]] is throwing a celebration and you are invited!

Come to the Caverns of Time and present this ticket to gain entry to the party!

==Completion==
Welcome! It's that special time of year when the bronze dragonflight celebrates all that has happened over the years and you, <name>, are the guest of honor! Come celebrate at the grand feast, get down at the "Disco of Time", or lend an ear as I tell you about some of the greatest adventures in all of [[Azeroth]].

==Notes==
*Take the portal to Caverns of Time in [[Stormwind City]] or [[Orgrimmar]] and speak to the [[Steward of Time]] for a convenient ride deeper into the cavern. Be sure to take in the festivities as you fly by!
