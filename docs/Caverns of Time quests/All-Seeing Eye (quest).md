== Objectives ==
Collect 25 Eternal Embers from [[Firelands (instance)|The Firelands]] and 3 Sands of Time.
* [[Eternal Ember]] (25)
* [[Sands of Time (alchemy)]] (3)

== Description ==
I perceive the questions that burn within your mind and I must confess that I share in your uncertainty... a rare position for one such as I, and a most unsettling one.

As I scour time to find traces of this obscured event, you must aid me in the creation of an Eye, both to test your worthiness, and to provide an essential tool in the unraveling of this mystery.

Venture into the Plane of Fire, <class>, and gather Eternal Embers. Bring them to me with Sands of Time and I will create the Eye.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|53||50}}

== Progress ==
Well, <class>?

Have you acquired the necessary materials?

== Completion ==
You have done well, friend.

Be still as I weave ancient magics to create the Timeless Eye.

== Notes ==
*Bosses drop 1-3 Embers on 25-man, with an average of 2. On 10-man, bosses drop 0-1, with a 0.8 average.
*It is possible to run the instance on both Normal and Heroic difficulties in one week, speeding up the accrual rate of [[Eternal Ember]].

Upon completion, Anachronos imbues the [[Timeless Eye]] with magic.
