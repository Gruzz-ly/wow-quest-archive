== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Anachronos]] in the [[Caverns of Time]] to witness the future of [[Azeroth]].
* Future of Azeroth Witnessed

== Description ==
Listen carefully, <class>, for though we are only beginning, time already grows short and the consequences of our failure are unfathomable.

An event in the recent past has been obscured from my vision by the most powerful of magics. Its impact, however, has not.

If action is not taken to change the course of this timeline's future, the outcome is clear.

Brace yourself, mortal, and behold the future of Azeroth.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|25|94}}

== Progress ==
Witness the undoing of our world, <class>.

== Completion ==
Now, <race>, you know the reasoning behind your summons.

== Notes ==
;Speaking with Anachronos
:Be at ease, mortal. Our time together here must be productive, and unclouded by tension.

:Much depends on your ability to think clearly and reason well.

:{{Gossip|Yes, Anachronos. I am ready to witness your vision of the future.}}

:''A cutscene will begin.''
:{{text|say|Anachronos|Listen well, mortal.}}
:{{text|say|Anachronos|Countless threads are woven to create the fabric of our timeline.}}
:''The scene shifts to a bronze dragon observing an image of Azeroth.''
:{{text|say|Anachronos|As the wardens of time, we of the Bronze Dragonflight observe their infinite combinations.}}
:{{text|say|Anachronos|When disruptions are detected by our watchers, we are charged with their repair.}}
:{{text|say|Anachronos|A recent event, obscured by powerful magics, remains masked, even to me.}}
:{{text|say|Anachronos|But the catastrophic outcome is plain.}}
:''The image of Azeroth bursts into flame.''
:{{text|say|Anachronos|Azeroth will burn.}}
:{{text|say|Anachronos|While the details remain shrouded from our view, one thing we have gleaned...}}
:{{text|say|Anachronos|...is that the fate of Azeroth hinges on the deeds of a mortal.}}
:''The camera pans to reveal the silhouette of the player, bearing [[Dragonwrath]], riding on [[Tarecgosa]].''
:{{text|say|Anachronos|Are you the mortal on which so much depends?}}
:{{text|say|Anachronos|Only time will tell.}}
