A quest requiring you to go to the instance [[Old Hillsbrad Foothills]], which is part of the [[Caverns of Time]].

== Objectives ==
[[Andormu]] at the Caverns of Time has asked that you venture to Old Hillsbrad and speak with [[Erozion]].

== Description ==
To the west is the timeway to Hillsbrad of the past &ndash; 7 years to be exact.

Forces are working against the [[Horde]] [[warchief]], [[Thrall]], attempting to prevent him from ever escaping [[Durnholde Keep]].

If Thrall never escapes, [[Azeroth|this world]] &ndash; as you know it &ndash; will cease to exist.

Gather a group of [[adventures]]s and take the timeway to old Hillsbrad. Two of our agents await you inside.

Speak with Erozion on the other side.

== Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
* 1200 experience
* 10 reputation with the [[Keepers of Time]]

== Completion ==
Our worst fears might soon be realized. The forces at work behind this temporal disturbance are a new flight of dragons known as the Infinite. We do not know where they came from or why they are destroying timeways.

In this pocket of time, they have kidnapped [[Taretha Foxton]], daughter of [[Tammis Foxton]], the secretary of [[Aedelas Blackmoore]], ruler of Durnholde and overseer of all [[internment camp]]s on Azeroth.
