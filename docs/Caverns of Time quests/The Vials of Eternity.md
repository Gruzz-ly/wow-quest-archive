==Objectives==
Soridormi at [[Caverns of Time]] wants you to retrieve [[Vashj's Vial Remnant]] from [[Lady Vashj]] at [[Coilfang Reservoir]] and [[Kael's Vial Remnant]] from [[Kael'thas Sunstrider]] at [[Tempest Keep]]. 
* [[Kael's Vial Remnant]]
* [[Vashj's Vial Remnant]]

==Description==
Seven vials were drawn from the [[Well of Eternity]] by [[Illidan]]. He poured three into the lake on top of Mount Hyjal and a second Well of Eternity was created. For years the rest were believed lost.
With the opening of the [[Dark Portal]], we've come to know that he gave one each to his lieutenants [[Kael'thas]] and [[Vashj]]. Retrieve what remains of them; we will need them as foci to open a gateway to any events tied to Mount Hyjal, recent or ancient. The outcome of the Battle of [[Mount Hyjal]] must be preserved.

==Reward==
You will receive:
* {{cost|13|20|}}
* +3000 reputation with [[The Scale of the Sands]]

==Progress==
I've asked the impossible of you, yet I expect you to succeed. &nbsp;Much depends on it. 

==Completion==
The power contained even in this small amount of water from the [[Well of Eternity]] is incredible.

I can see clearly into every moment in time linked to Hyjal... the creation of the second Well of Eternity, Illidan's imprisonment, the enchantment of the [[World Tree]] and... yes! The [[Battle of Mount Hyjal]].

We must make haste, the timeline is not safe.

==Notes==
* This quest was formerly required for [[attunement]] to the [[Battle for Mount Hyjal (instance)|Battle for Mount Hyjal]], ensuring raiders had completed the [[Serpentshrine Cavern]] and [[Eye (Tempest Keep)|Tempest Keep]] raids first.
* Until the release of ''[[Wrath of the Lich King]]'', completing The Vials of Eternity and the (now optional) [[Black Temple attunement]] awarded players the [[Hand of A'dal]] title. The title is now only obtainable for players that still have the old version of this quest in their logs.
* This quest is still the only way a player can unlock the various versions of the [[Band of Eternity]] awarded at each [[Scale of the Sands]] [[reputation]] level.

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 3.0.2|note=The title "Hand of A'dal" is no longer available except to those who already had the final quest when this patch was released.}}
* {{Patch 2.4.0|note=Completing this quest is no longer required to enter the [[Battle of Mount Hyjal]].}}
* {{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
