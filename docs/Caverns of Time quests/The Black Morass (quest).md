== Objectives ==
Travel through the [[Caverns of Time]] to the [[Black Morass]] during the [[opening of the Dark Portal]] and speak with [[Sa'at]].

== Description ==
The [[Infinite Dragonflight]] have abandoned all pretense of subtlety. They plot to destroy the [[Guardian]], [[Medivh]], and prevent the [[Dark Portal]] from ever opening. While outwardly, this may appear a boon to the forces of the [[Alliance]], it is in actuality catastrophic and will result in your world ending.

You must venture through the timeway leading to the Black Morass. Go west and then south, past my future self, until you reach the tunnel that houses the swamp specimens. Cross over and speak with Sa'at.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
* 1250 XP
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Keepers of Time]]

==Completion==
Indeed, if the [[orc]]s never make it to [[Azeroth]], the Alliance will never form. Eventually civil war will break out, further weakening the [[human]] [[kingdom]]s.

Ultimately the [[Burning Legion]] will invade Azeroth, destroying it in the absence of any defenders.
