==Objectives==
Kill 12 Chronal Anomalies.

* [[Chronal Anomaly]] slain (12)

==Description==
The [[Caverns of Time]]? Strange... I spent many timelines in this very place.

What's special about here-- now?

We'll have to discern as much later on. It looks like we aren't the only ones who've been affected by these rifts...

Let's do the [[Bronze dragonflight|Bronze Dragonflight]] a favor and clear out these anomalies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
To see this many creatures out of time is deeply unsettling. Who is behind this?

==Completion==
It seems no matter when one is, there's always something to fight...

==Progression==
{{A Friend in Needle}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 8.1.5|note=Added.}}
