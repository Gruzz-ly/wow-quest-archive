== Objectives ==
Bring the [[:Timeless Eye]] to [[Coldarra]].
* Brought Timeless Eye to Coldarra

== Description ==
Time well spent, mortal.

While you struggled in the [[Firelands|Plane of Fire]], my watchers and I were able to determine when and, most importantly, where our vision was obscured.

We discovered that the shroud was placed over the [[Nexus]], far to the north in the realm of the [[blue dragonflight]].

I have attuned the Timeless Eye to show you the occurrences that remain hidden to us here.

Bring it to Coldarra at once and seek out a place suitable for its activation.

Go, child. Time is of the essence...

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|25|94}}

== Completion ==
You are either a fool, or a lunatic. Regardless, you must return from whence you came.

Were you spotted by another of my brood, you would already have met your end.

== Notes ==
:''Upon accepting the quest, loot the eye, and travel to Coldarra, in the Borean Tundra.''

:''As the player arrives at Coldarra, a cutscene will begin.''
:''Tarecgosa flies from the Nexus, and spots the player trekking through the forest.''
:{{text|say|Tarecgosa|What? What foolishness is this?}}
:''Tarecgosa swoops down and lands before the player.''
:{{text|say|Tarecgosa|You there! Have your senses abandoned you?!}}
:{{text|say|Tarecgosa|Coldarra is no place for mortals now.}}
:{{text|say|Tarecgosa|You must leave at once, if you value your life.}}
