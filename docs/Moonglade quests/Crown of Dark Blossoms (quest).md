==Objectives==
Gather blooms from [[Duskwood]], [[Silverpine Forest]], and [[Desolace]].
* [[Flower of Compassion]] (3)
* [[Flower of Reflection]] (3)
* [[Flower of Solemnity]] (3)
*Return to [[Myrael Lunarbloom]] in [[Moonglade]].

==Description==
Such somber flowers... but they hold a beauty of their own, don't you think? If only they could last.

Allow me to lend my aid.

Every [[Lunar Festival]], similar flowers to yours bloom around the world. They hold a special connection to [[Elune]]... one that I can empower. If you bring them to me, I can preserve them so you may enjoy them long after an ordinary flower would die.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Crown of Eternal Memorial]]
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The flowers that bloom during Lunar Festival have special properties. I believe it is Elune's light watching over them.

==Completion==
Ah, what calming flowers. I sense a solemn peace emanating from them.

This crown shall support you with a silent grace.

==Notes==
*[[Crown of Dark Blossoms]] must be owned to accept this quest.

All flowers can be found at or near the base of tree trunks.
*Flowers of Compassion are located in the [[Cenarion Wildlands]] west of [[Karnum's Glade]] in Desolace.
*Flowers of Reflections are located in the northern half of [[Brightwood Grove]] in Duskwood.
*Flowers of Solemnity are located at the [[Decrepit Fields]] in [[Silverpine Forest]].
