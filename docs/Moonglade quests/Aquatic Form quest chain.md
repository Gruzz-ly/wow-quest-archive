This quest chain leads to the quester gaining the ability to [[shapeshift]]
into [[Aquatic Form]].

== Aquatic Form quest chain ==
This quest chain starts with the druid trainer in your capital city - [[Mathrengyl Bearwalker]] in [[Darnassus]] for [[Night elf (playable)|night elves]], [[Turak Runetotem]] in [[Thunder Bluff]] for [[Tauren (playable)|tauren]].

* '''[[A Lesson to Learn]]'''
Praising your progress to date, the trainer tells you that it is time you
learned more about an animal aspect that grants mastery of the water, and
directs you to [[Dendrite Starblaze]] in [[Moonglade]].

Having previously learned how to [[teleport]] to Moonglade, getting
there is no difficulty at all.  In Moonglade, Starblaze tells you that
you must overcome two trials.


* '''[[Trial of the Lake]]'''
The first trial is to test your ability to work underwater under pressure.
&nbsp;You are tasked to find a [[Shrine Bauble]] in [[Lake Elune'ara]],
and to use it at the [[Shrine of Remulos]].  Further, you have to
accomplish this within only a limited period of time.

You dive in to the lake, and are thankful that there are no predators
in the lake.  Various fissures in the lake floor bubble with air being released.  You take advantage of these in your search, and eventually
find an urn holding the bauble.

You take the bauble to the shrine.

*'''[[Trial of the Sea Lion]]'''
[[Tajarri]] directs you to reunite the halves of the
[[Pendant of the Sea Lion]], and present the pendant to
[[Dendrite Starblaze]].  She does not tell you where the pieces can be
found, only that you should talk to the citizens of Moonglade for more information.

You find people in [[Moonglade]] with knowledge of the pendant halves,
and you set off.

The [[Half Pendant of Aquatic Agility]] you find in a small coffer in
predator-infested waters.  You exercise judgment and agility in evading
many of the predators, and some skill in combat in defeating those you
are unable to evade.

The [[Half Pendant of Aquatic Endurance]], though, entails much travel.
First, you need travel to a quite distant place.  Once there, you are
required both to search, and to dive very deeply to locate.

You persevere, and return triumphant with the pendant in hand.

*'''[[Aquatic Form]]'''
Starblaze acknowledges your success, and reminds you that both agility
and endurance are necessary, when acting underwater.  He sends you
back to your trainer.

Your trainer asks for the pendant as proof of your lessons, after which
he teaches you the skill of [[shapeshift]]ing into [[Aquatic Form]].

==Rewards==
The ultimate goal of this series of quests was once to gain the
[[Aquatic Form]] shapeshifting ability. The only benefits now are:
* +550 [[Cenarion Circle]] reputation
* {{loot|rare|Aquarius Belt}}
* a fair amount of [[XP]].
