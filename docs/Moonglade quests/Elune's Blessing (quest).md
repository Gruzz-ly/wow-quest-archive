==Objectives==
Summon [[Omen]], defeat him and gain Elune's Blessing. Return to [[Valadar Starsong]] in [[Nighthaven]].
*Receive [[Elune's Blessing (buff)|Elune's Blessing]].
*Return to Valadar Starsong at Nighthaven in Moonglade.

==Description==
The beast [[Omen]] was once a hero of this world. A wolf of great strength and fortune, Omen fought beside the heroes of the [[War of the Ancients]] until he succumbed to demonic magics. Turning against his allies, he raged across [[Azeroth]] and carried death and terror in his wake.

Finally defeated here, in [[Moonglade]], Omen now sleeps among the silt of [[Lake Elune'ara]]. But each new year, during the festival, he stirs...

Gather cohorts, <name>, and summon and defeat the beast Omen. Earn the blessing of [[Elune]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]
*[[Elune's Lantern]]
*[[Lunar Festival Fireworks Pack]]
*[[3x [[Solid Stone]]

==Progress==
Omen yet stirs below Lake Elune'ara, <name>...

==Completion==
Very well done, <name>.&nbsp; Defeating Omen sent his spirit back to the waters of Elune'ara.&nbsp; Although the beast himself is blessed by Elune and so cannot die, his anger will subside for another year.

Your victory is a celebration, <name>--a celebration of the might of Omen, of you and your allies, and of the peace you have given this tragic hero of our past.

==Notes==
You do not need to be in the raid that taps and kills [[Omen]], you just need to stand in the light that shines on his dead body to receive [[Elune's Blessing (buff)]] and complete the quest. So if you see people fighting him, don't worry about getting a group invite; just lend a hand.
