==Objectives==
Travel to the village of [[Nighthaven]] in [[Moonglade]], on [[Kalimdor]]. Seek out the [[Jungle troll|troll]] [[Banteazo]], a [[hunter]], and ask her for insight into beast mastery.

==Description==
While I'm tracking [[Van Amburgh]], you could visit an old associate of mine. Banteazo is in Moonglade, where she studies animal behavior with the [[druid]]s in order to refine training for companions. She's also fought Van Amburgh before and might have some pointers. Say hello to her for me!

Once you finish, we'll meet up again in Winterspring, where I plan to follow up some leads. I have an old camp in the northern hills where we can talk privately.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*660 [[XP]]
*{{cost||39}}

==Completion==
You say dat [[Estelenn]] says hello? Odd, I've not seen dat [[Alliance]] flitterbug since da last time we traded arrows in [[Stranglethorn Vale]]... well, regardless, dis place is neutral ground. If she sent you to me, den you be here to talk about animals, yah?
