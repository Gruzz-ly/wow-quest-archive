==Objectives==
Find [[Orokai|someone]] who can tell you more about [[Rotten Seed|the rotten ancient seed]].

==Description==
A putrid seed is all that remains of the [[Rotting Ancient|wandering ancient]]. Its outer coat is brittle, and the insides emit a foul odor.

Given its size, the ancient this seed came from must have been fairly young; at least by [[ancient]] standards. One has to wonder why such a creature would be found trudging through The [[Quagmire]].

To find your answers, you should take this seed to someone with knowledge in the lore of ancients.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1550 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, another lost youngling...
