==Objectives==
Gather blooms from [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]], the [[Hinterlands]], and [[Mulgore]].
* [[Flower of Fortitude]] (3)
* [[Flower of Sincerity]] (3)
* [[Flower of Vigor]] (3)

==Description==
I see you are a fan of pink flowers. It is a shame those that make up your crown will one day come to perish.

Perhaps I can help with that.

Though those are ordinary blossoms, I know similar flowers that bloom only during the [[Lunar Festival]]. If you retrieve them for me, I can imbue them with [[Elune]]'s power so that you may enjoy them throughout the year.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Crown of Boundless Courage]]
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Not all flowers are equal. Those that bloom during Lunar Festival have a special bond with Elune.

==Completion==
Such beautiful flowers! I can feel Elune's might within them.

This crown shall bring you great courage.

==Notes==
*[[Crown of Courage]] must be owned to accept this quest.

All flowers can be found at or near the base of tree trunks.
*Flowers of Fortitude are located near [[Fairbreeze Village]] in Eversong Woods.
*Flowers of Sincerity are located in the [[Golden Plains]] east of [[Thunder Bluff]]
*Flowers of Vigor are located along the river near [[Skulk Rock]] in the Hinterlands.
