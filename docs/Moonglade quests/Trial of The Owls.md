==Objectives==
Bring symbols of the three owls to [[Loganaar]] in [[Moonglade]].
* [[Symbol of the First Owl]]
* [[Symbol of the Second Owl]]
* [[Symbol of the Third Owl]]

==Description==
Let me see that symbol you carry, <name>.

It seems you have begun the trial of the [[owl]]s. This marks a pivotal moment in your journey as a [[druid]].

There are more symbols like this one; spread across [[Azeroth]]. To earn them, you must perform great feats of mind and body alike.

One owl sits beneath a [[great tree]] in the [[Eastern Kingdoms]]. Another is near a great tree here in [[Kalimdor]]. Yet another is at sea; off the coast of {{C|Hillsbrad Foothills|Hillsbrad}}.

Seek out these owls, <name>, and bring their symbols to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Rune of Wild Growth]]
*{{cost||18}}

You will also receive:
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
How goes your trial, <name>?

==Completion==
I would like to congratulate you, <name>. What you've accomplished is no small feat.

To pass the trial of the owls is to demonstrate an attunement with all aspects of your druidic calling.

Take this rune as a mark of your achievement. I hope it will serve you well as a warden of the [[Emerald Dream]].

==Notes==
*You must already possess at least one of the Symbols for Loganaar to offer the quest.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 1.15.0|note=Added.}}
