==Objectives==
Destroy the Nightmare Amalgamation and bring the [[Shadowy Figure (Season of Discovery)|Shadowy Figure]] any loot you find.
*Destroy the [[Nightmare Amalgamation (Season of Discovery)|Nightmare Amalgamation]]
*[[Mantle of Nightmares]]

==Description==
Now that you have [[Ziri "The Wrench" Littlesprocket|Ziri]]'s gadget, you should have everything you need to take on the Nightmare Amalgamation. Gather as many allies as you can and head back into the [[Emerald Nightmare|Nightmare]] by way of the portal [[Bough Shadow]] in {{C|Ashenvale}}. Find and destroy the Nightmare Amalgamation within its lair.

Oh, and one more thing... the beast is in possession of a specific item that is of great interest to me. Bring me whatever you find on its corpse and you'll be well rewarded.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|45}}
*7100 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with the [[Emerald Wardens]]
*[[Inert Mantle of Nightmares]]

==Progress==
How goes the hunt?

==Completion==
Fantastic work, <name>. Now for your reward!

You see, all I wanted is a little teeny fragment of a dream hiding within this mantle, but the husk is a treasure all on its own, and that part is yours. I think you'll find that it has certain unique properties, and if you have the proper skills for it, speak with me again and I'm sure I can help you figure out just the right way to use it.

==Progression==
{{An Amalagamation of Nightmares}}

==Notes==
After completing this quest, crafters with at least 250 skill in their profession can speak with the Shadowy Figure to learn new epic crafting recipes.
