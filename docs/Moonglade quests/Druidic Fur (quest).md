==Objectives==
Bring the fur to [[Loganaar]] in [[Moonglade]].
* [[Druidic Fur]]

==Description==
<This fur teems with natural magic. The beasts you fought on the island were clearly not beasts at all, but [[druid]]s.

At least they were before.

What could have caused them to become feral?

You did not want to slay them, but they gave you no choice, didn't they?>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (700x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This fur... has not seem a change in form in quite some time. 

You encountered my kin gone feral, I surmise? That... makes sense.

Following the [[War of the Satyr]], there were [[Druids of the Scythe|those among us]] that thought that the [[Pack form|Pack]] was the only true way. That we were, at our core, wild creatures, and our humanoid forms are merely a guise.

As a flock they took wing and left us, never to be heard from again. Until now.

I thank you for this information, here is some [[:Azerite]] I have collected for the Speaker.
