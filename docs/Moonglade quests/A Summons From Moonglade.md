As you walk around [[Dalaran]] over the [[Broken Isles]], Hamuul will spawn and follow you, offering this quest.

:{{text|say|Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem|Greetings, <name>. It is fortunate I found you. Your presence is requested at Moonglade.}}

;On accept
:{{text|say|Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem|I'll meet you there as soon as you conclude your business in Dalaran.}}

The easiest way to get to Moonglade is, obviously, by casting [[Teleport: Moonglade]]. Hamuul will conveniently await you at the point where the spell teleports you, at {{coords|56|32|Moonglade}}.
