'''Lunar Preservation''' is the starting quest for players to be able to [[Transmogrification|transmogrify]] the Lunar Festival flower crowns when the world event is not active.

==Objectives==
Perform the Rite of the Moon at the [[moonwell]]s scattered around the world. You can find them in [[Ashenvale]], [[Felwood]], [[Feralas]], [[Moonglade]], [[Stonetalon Mountains]], [[Duskwood]], and [[Mount Hyjal]].

If you let the Blessing of the Moon expire, you will have to start over.

* [[Blessed Staff of Moonflowers|Staff of Moonflowers]] charged
* Ashenvale [[Moonwell of Purity]] blessing received
* Ashenvale [[Moonwell of Cleansing]] blessing received
* Felwood moonwell blessing received
* Feralas moonwell blessing received
* Moonglade moonwell blessing received
* Stonetalon moonwell blessing received
* Duskwood moonwell blessing received
* Mount Hyjal [[Well of Eternity (Hyjal)|Well of Eternity]] blessing received
* [[Staff of Moonflowers]] (provided)

While the quest is in progress, the written quest objectives do not identify which moonwells have been used already, but the on-map tracker will highlight the location of the remaining requirements correctly.

==Description==
My staff has served me well for many years. It has stood by my side, been through many trials... and as I grow older I find myself leaning on it more and more.

Its flowers bloom every [[Lunar Festival]], basking in the [[Elune]]'s might. They bring me so much joy, I wish for them to stay all year long. I know a way... but my bones are too old to make the trip.

Perhaps you would take the journey for me? Empower my staff in the light of the moon at the moonwells around the world. Then my flowers can stay.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*850 [[XP]]
*{{costitem|25|Coin of Ancestry}}

==Progress==
Flowers flourish under Elune's light. She was always known to cherish them.

==Completion==
You've done it! I can feel Elune's power within. Now I can enjoy the company of my flowers for the rest of my days.

Perhaps I can do the same for you. If you have flowers you wish to preserve, bring them to me. I may be able to help.

==Notes==
'''Note: Doing Mount Hyjal may likely bug out the entire quest and prevent you from getting the other objectives. Recommended to do Mount Hyjal last.'''

To charge the staff, go to the nearby moonwell west of the quest giver. A special action button will appear: {{Abilities|Ritual of the Moon|Call upon Elune to imbue the Staff of Moonflowers with her energy.|notes=10 sec cast.|id=303602|icon=artifactability_balancedruid_halfmoon}}. This will give you the [[buff]] {{Abilities|Blessing of the Moon|id=303601|icon=artifactability_balancedruid_halfmoon}} which lasts one hour. It cannot be removed by the player until the duration is ended, but performing the ritual at moonwells that haven't been previously visited will refresh the buff.

Go to the following locations to further empower the staff:
*[[Nighthaven]] in [[Moonglade]]{{coords|48|32|Moonglade}}
*[[Whisperwind Grove]] in [[Felwood]]{{coords|44|28|Felwood}}
*[[Nordrassil]] in [[Mount Hyjal]]{{coords|61.25|26.2|Mount Hyjal}}
*[[Moonwell of Purity]] in [[Ashenvale]]{{coords|53|46|Ashenvale}}
*[[Moonwell of Cleansing]] in Ashenvale{{coords|60|72|Ashenvale}}
*[[Stonetalon Peak]] in [[Stonetalon Mountains]]{{coords|41.5|19|Stonetalon Mountains}}
*[[Dire Maul]] in [[Feralas]]{{coords|60|46|Feralas}}
*[[Twilight Grove]] in [[Duskwood]]{{coords|49|33|Duskwood}}

Once all the blessings have been obtained, the buff is removed and the provided staff will change into [[Blessed Staff of Moonflowers]]. Return to [[Myrael Lunarbloom]] in [[Moonglade]] to complete this quest.
