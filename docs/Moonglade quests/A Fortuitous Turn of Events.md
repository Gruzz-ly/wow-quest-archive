*Listen to what the [[Shadowy Figure (Season of Discovery)|Shadowy Figure]] has to say

==Description==
Well hello <name>! I was just standing here taking in the scenery and I just couldn't help but overhear your predicament. Fortuitously, I think I can provide just what you need to help you with your little "evil devouring [[Emerald Nightmare|nightmare]] monster" problem.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35}}
*2350 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I must say, this couldn't have worked out better if I had planned it. It seems that fate smiles upon you, friend.

<You get the distinct impression that the shadowy figure before you is smirking>

==Completion==
Isn't it encouraging to have someone like me around that tends to have just what you need, just when you need it?

==Notes==

<You can't make out the entity's facial expression, but you get the distinct impression it is smiling at you.>

{{gossip|Okay, make it quick.}}

You likely know of the gnomish mechanic, Ziri Littlesprocket? Well, she's quite the genius, and was kind enough to lend me her talents to help me create something that I think you'll find incredibly useful in your current predicament...

A set of void-powered vambraces, constructed utilizing a particularly impressive piece of gnomish technology that "someone" was kind enough to find and repair for her.

{{gossip|Impressive [[gnomish technology]] that "someone" recovered, eh? Let me guess, these special bracelets utilize a Pristine G-7 C.O.R.E. Processor Unit?}}

How astute! I'm glad you are able to keep up. At any rate, Ziri was feeling inexplicably inspired when she created this item and it has some truly astonishing properties. Not the least of which being able to impart a portion of my willpower upon the bearer, and shield them from, let's say, external mental interference. Such as, for example, an aura of all-encompassing dread.

{{gossip|How convenient, you seem to have just what I need.}}

Ah, if only that were so. Unfortunately, I recently lent the vambraces to someone who has proven to be, regrettably, quite the disappointment. You see, you aren't the only adventurer with whom I've treated with. There was another adventurer of some apparent renown whom I recently recruited and equipped with this item, in hopes that he would venture into the dream and dispose of this nightmare beast for the good of Azeroth. It seems, however, that he's in dereliction of his duty. He's also dropped from my sight, so if I had to guess, I'd bet on him lying dead in a ditch somewhere.

{{gossip|Very well, what must I do?}}

Unfortunately, that is going to be the tricky part. Since he is no longer wearing the bracers, I've completely lost track of him. I need you to go out into the wide world and find this adventurer, dead or alive, and recover the Void-Powered Vambraces. He is a gnomish warrior, and I was last aware of his presence somewhere in the Eastern Kingdoms. It's not much to go on, but you are nothing if not resourceful, so I'm sure you'll find a way.
