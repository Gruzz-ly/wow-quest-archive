==Objectives==
Gather blooms from [[Winterspring]], [[Dun Morogh]], and [[Hillsbrad Foothills]].
* [[Flower of Thoughtfulness]] (3)
* [[Flower of Luck]] (3)
* [[Flower of Generosity]] (3)
*Return to [[Myrael Lunarbloom]] in [[Moonglade]].

==Description==
Those flowers remind me of [[Elune]] herself! I wear similar ones year round, to remind me of her watchful grace.

Perhaps you would like to as well?

Your crown is made of ordinary blossoms that will one day wilt and die. It is an unfortunate fate for such delicate beauties, but my crown is made of similar flowers that I made to last year round! If you bring me specific flowers that bloom only during [[Lunar Festival]], I can bless them so that you too can enjoy your crown all year long.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Crown of Everlasting Fortune]]
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Between you and me, I believe those flowers are Elune's favorite. They mirror her lunar radiance so splendidly!

==Completion==
Ah, flowers that match my own. I can feel Elune's presence within them.

This crown shall bring you great fortune in life.
