==Objectives==
Find the four lost saplings in [[Eastern Kingdoms]], and share the Water of Elune'ara with them. Afterwards, return to [[Orokai]], in [[Moonglade]].
*Find Summer Sapling
*Find Spring Sapling
*Find Fall Sapling
*Find Winter Sapling
*[[Water of Elune'ara]] (provided)

==Description==
In times of unrest, seeds may take root in bitter soil. [[Ancient]]s born this way are prone to corruption. They wander hostile lands; never finding peace.

I have sensed four saplings who may be spared such a fate. They are lost among the Eastern Kingdoms, with leaves like that of each season.

Please, take this water to them, so that they may be healed.

Be warned, the water's [[magic]] is delicate. [[Teleportation]], or falling in battle, will destroy it. Its potency will also fade over time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3150 [[XP]]
*{{cost||50}}
*[[Rune of Nourishing]]

==Progress==
Make haste, <name>. My kin may yet be saved.

==Completion==
Your deeds have preserved centuries of life, <name>. I am immensely grateful. May you bring yet more healing upon this land in the times to come.

==Notes==
*Teleporting, dying, or allowing the 1-hour timer on the Water to expire will all cause the quest to fail.
*The saplings can be found at the following locations:
**Spring Sapling: {{C|Swamp of Sorrows}} at {{co|10|39|Swamp of Sorrows (Classic)}}
**Summer Sapling: {{C|Stranglethorn Vale}} at {{co|33|65|Stranglethorn Vale (Classic)}}
**Autumn Sapling: {{C|Arathi Highlands}} at {{co|47|72|Arathi Highlands (Classic)}}
**Winter Sapling: {{C|Alterac Mountains}} at {{co|58|44|Alterac Mountains (Classic)}}
