==Objectives==
Find a way to reach the summit of [[Mount Hyjal]].
*Find help in [[Moonglade]]

==Description==
I suggest you start in Moonglade, the [[Cenarion Circle]] stronghold. It was Archdruid [[Malfurion Stormrage]] that ordered the way shut, but not all of the [[druid]]s agree with this. Some may be willing to assist you.

You are resourceful and I am confident you can overcome this obstacle. Gain access to the summit and speak to me again.

==Completion==
You want to travel to the [[World Tree|world tree]]? My [[Leyara|mother]] had recent dealings there... until she went missing. That's why I am here and want an audience with the Cenarion Circle's leadership. That is my concern, not yours, though.

The wards barring Hyjal aren't what they used to be. You can't go through them, you may be able to go over them. I know someone who may be willing to give you aid.

==Notes==
Speak to Istaria in Moonglade:
{{Dialogue|Greetings, <class>. I've come to Moonglade to seek an audience with the Cenarion Circle's leadership. My mother lives here. Unfortunately, she went missing recently, and I’m growing concerned about her. Unless you know where she is, I really must focus on securing that audience.

{{Gossip|I'm sorry to hear about your mother. I'm also visiting; I'm looking for information. I hate to ask, but do you have any idea how to reach Mount Hyjal's summit?}}

{{Dialogue-child|Interesting. No, I don’t know how to reach the summit.

However, I might know someone who does.

{{Gossip|That’s great, thank you!}}
}}}}
