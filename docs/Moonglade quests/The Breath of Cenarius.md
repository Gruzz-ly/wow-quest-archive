==Objectives==
Recover the Breath of Cenarius from [[Pyromancer Loregrain]] in [[Blackrock Depths]] and use the artifact to close 3 Elemental Gates.
*Elemental Gates closed (3)
*[[Breath of Cenarius]]

==Description==
<name>, we have learned that a missing Cenarion artifact has surfaced in the hands of a [[Twilight's Hammer]] pyromancer. Pyromancer Loregrain has taken this artifact, the Breath of Cenarius, into Blackrock Depths and uses its power to open elemental gates.

We must act to keep Loregrain from summoning [[elemental]]s to bolster the ranks of his [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron]] allies. Recover the artifact from him and use its power to close the gates that Loregrain has been using.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Headdress of the Verdant Circle|Headdress of the Green Circle}}
You will also receive: {{cost|1|45}}

==Progress==
We cannot afford to allow the Dark Iron dwarves to ally with Twilight's Hammer.

==Completion==
I'm heartened to have the Breath of Cenarius back where it belongs and I know the rest of the circle will be impressed by your efforts. You may have also set back the plans of the Twilight's Hammer clan a bit, too. Excellent work.

*[[Moonglade Calls]] (optional)
*[[The Breath of Cenarius]]
