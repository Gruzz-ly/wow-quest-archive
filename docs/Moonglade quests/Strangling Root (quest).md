==Objectives==
Take the root to [[Keeper Remulos]] in [[Moonglade]].
* [[Strangling Root]]

==Description==
<The root twists and struggles in your grip, attempting to wrap itself around your arm.

The keepers you encountered must be powerfully attuned to nature to imbue their creations with such longetivity.

Remembering the ferocity with which they fought against you makes you suddenly uneasy.

Why would these guardians of nature behave this way?

Surely, someone must have the answers.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (700x [[Azerite (resource)]])
*{{cost|11|70|}}
*8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This root tells me all that I need to know of your voyage: an island, teeming with the life spirit, and you met keepers there.

I sense you are surprised at their actions.

Not all of us that guard the natural world see your kind as allies. There are many of my kind that seek to preserve the balance above all things. Even if that means your death.

I will not fault you for defending yourself, but I am powerless to subdue them as well.

However, my fawns have gathered some Azerite for you.
