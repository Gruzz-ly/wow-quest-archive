==Objectives==
Speak with [[Thisalee Crow]] near [[Everlook]] in [[Winterspring]].

==Description==
I have a passing acquaintance with a [[Druids of the Talon|Druid of the Talon]] that might be willing to help you. The [[shrine of Aviana]] is on the slopes of [[Mount Hyjal]] and is sacred to her order, so they still have limited access to the mountain.

Her name is Thisalee Crow. I believe that she regularly visits Everlook in Winterspring to trade for supplies. She's headstrong and very impulsive, which might just be exactly what you need for your quest. 

Good luck, <class>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Completion==
<Thisalee listens intently as you tell her your story.>

So, let me get this straight; you want to go to the very top of Hyjal and harness the powers of the [[Well of Eternity]] to temper a [[Ashbringer|broken, cursed, legendary sword]]? You want to do this so that you can remove said curse, and free its [[Alexandros Mograine|former owner]] from [[undeath]]? That... sounds kind of awesome actually.  

I think I can help, but I've also got a few problems of my own that need resolving--if you don't mind.
