==Objectives==
Find the lair of the "Beast" that the injured [[gnome]] was referring to and recover the Void-Powered Vambraces
*Find the monster's lair

==Description==
You see, I'm a [[knight]] of some renown and I recently took it upon myself to rid the land of a particularly terrible evil making its home on a nearby island to the east. When I found the vile creature, a truly epic battle was met. We must have fought for hours until at last I sent the beast into full retreat, no doubt run off to succumb to its wounds. I was barely able to make it back to town myself before I collapsed in exhaustion. The vambraces must have slipped from my arm during the battle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||75}}
*4700 [[XP]]
*[[Decharged Void-Powered Vambraces]]

==Progress==
<The young [[murloc]] looks at you and makes a cute gurgling sound.>

You notice there is a small pile of dirt next to the Murloc. Perhaps a burrow of some sort. Maybe you should check it for the vambraces?

==Completion==
You've found a small burrow belonging to an adorable and seemingly friendly young Murloc. Surely this isn't the beast that the gnome was referring to?

<The tiny murloc makes a small gurgling noise and proceeds to burp up a pair of slime-covered vambraces at your feet>
