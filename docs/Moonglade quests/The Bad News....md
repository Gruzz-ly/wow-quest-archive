==Objectives==
Find the adventurer that the [[Shadowy Figure (Season of Discovery)|Shadowy Figure]] described, and recover the Void-Powered Vambraces.
*[[Decharged Void-Powered Vambraces]]

==Description==
So, the good news is that a solution exists. The bad news is that getting what you need to be able to survive the dread is going to require a bit of effort. I know, its{{sic}} unfortunate that it's so hard to get good help these days. If this adventurer had managed to do the one simple thing I asked them to do in the first place, you'd be tucking in a hot meal and a cold ale at an inn somewhere, none the wiser about any of this right now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35}}
*4700 [[XP]]
*[[Void-Powered Vambraces]]

==Progress==
How goes the search?

==Completion==
Ah it seems that these are de-powered. Unfortunate, but easily remedied. To recharge these, you'll need to find a dense concentration of Naga spellcasters and massacre them en masse. Rarely, they may carry something called a "Voidcore", so sift through the bodies, bring me one and.... Hah! Joking! If you could see the look on your face...

Give me one moment and I should be able to infuse these with some power.... and there we are! You are ready to slay a Nightmare.

==Progression==
{{An Amalagamation of Nightmares}}

==Notes==
To obtain the vambraces, go to [[Booty Bay]] and complete the quest [[The Lost Vambraces]] from the [[Injured Gnome (Season of Discovery)|Injured Gnome]].
