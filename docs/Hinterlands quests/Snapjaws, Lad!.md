==Objectives==
Collect 8 [[Snapjaw Gizzard]]s from [[Saltwater Snapjaw]]s.
*[[Snapjaw Gizzard]] (8)

==Description==
I've got plans to brew up somethin' special for those pesky [[Revantusk tribe|troll]]s.  Aye, I said them... a brew they won't ever forget!  A brew that'll have them pickin' their tusks out of the hillsides!

I've got a few ingredients steepin' already, but I could use a hand gatherin' more.  At the bottom of the [[Overlook Cliffs]] to the east, near the shore, is a whole mess o' snapjaws.  I need fresh, whole gizzards from them for my blastbrew.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||30}}
*2,540 [[XP]]
*[[Nat Pagle's Extreme Angler FC-5000]]

==Progress==
Got those gizzards?

==Completion==
Ah, nice an' fresh.  I'll get those going while you fetch me some more goods then...

==Progression==
