==Objectives==
Kill 5 Vilebranch Berserkers and 5 Vilebranch Shadowcasters in [[Jintha'Alor]].
* [[Vilebranch Berserker]] slain (5)
* [[Vilebranch Shadowcaster]] slain (5)

==Description==
The [[Vilebranch tribe|Vilebranch]] are a different tribe from the [[Revantusk tribe|Revantusk]], but the difference is academic. Far as we're concerned the only good troll is a dead troll!

But make no mistake, the Vilebranch are just as nasty even without the [[Horde]]'s chain around their neck. They'll poison this whole land unless we take this stand and get rid of them

You can start with their witchdoctors and headhunters on the lower tier. Let me know when you've killed a fair share of 'em. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35|}}
*2900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well, get on with it!

==Completion==
It won't be long until we're the only dwarves left breathing on these walls.

==Progression==
{{Hero's Call: The Hinterlands!}}

==Patch changes==
*{{patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
