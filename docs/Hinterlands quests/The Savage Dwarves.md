==Objectives==
Kill 10 Wildhammer Warriors or Wildhammer Shaman.
* [[Wildhammer Shaman (Hinterlands)|Wildhammer Shaman]]
* [[Wildhammer Warrior]]

==Description==
The [[Horde]] has done much for us [[Revantusk tribe|Revantusk]], and we're no freeloaders. With the other [[forest troll]] [[tribe]]s pushed back, we're striking out to claim more land in the name of the Horde.

But now the [[Wildhammer dwarf|Wildhammer dwarves]] are getting in our way. If it's a war they want, it's a war they'll get... and I don't plan to lose a war to creatures half my height.

Get out there and kill me some dwarves.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||30}}

==Completion==
That will show the [[Wildhammer clan|Wildhammer]] to stay away from our lands!

Crazy dwarves should've stayed in the mountains...

==Progression==
