==Objectives==
Collect 8 Skittering Spiderlings in Jintha'Alor.
* [[Skittering Spiderling]] (8)

==Description==
A moment if you're going up there, <class>...

I've got a few brokers quite interested in potent toxins. I couldn't help but notice the spiders scurrying around near here... not giant ones, about the size of your hand.

The skitterlings are a hue I've never seen before in this area. Could you collect a few for me and bring them back?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||35}}

==Progress==
How many did you get?

==Completion==
Oh yes... I was wise to ask you to get these. How fascinating.

Come here, my pretties. Into the bag you go.

==Progression==
