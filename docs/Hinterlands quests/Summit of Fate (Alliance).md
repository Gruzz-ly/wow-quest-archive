==Objectives==
Collect 8 Spider Idols from the [[Vilebranch tribe|Vilebranch]] at the summit of [[Jintha'Alor]].
* [[Spider Idol]] (8)

==  Description ==
You have to go to the summit now, <name>. Our warriors won't go past the final gates. They say it's still as a tomb; not a sound, not a breath, not a hint of motion.

They think it's a trap, but based on what you've brought me, I'm worried it's something even more sinister. Go to the altar, investigate what happened... and bring me back ANY sort of mystical object or dark idol you find! Do you hear me? 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
{{cost||35|}}
*2900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What did you find?

==Completion==
Dead?  All of them, around the altar?  And you found these spider idols on them...

It's Shadra. The Spider Loa!  They're trying to tap her power!

==Notes==
It is easiest to take a ride on [[Sharpbeak]] to get to the area needed for this quest.
