==Objectives==
Collect 12 bottles of Pupellyverbos Port
* [[Pupellyverbos Port]] (12)

==Description==
You there! Did you know that strewn across the northern beach are tens, if not hundreds, of bottles of fine wine?

...well, now you do!

I'd be out there gathering them by the armload, if those [[turtle]]s weren't out to get me. They crave my blood, I swear.

So I'll pay you then. Bring me 12 bottles of Pupellyverbos Port and I'll "purchase" it from you, <class>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||22}}
*2,550 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Do you have 12 bottles? I know how to count, you know!

==Completion==
Perfect! I don't know where I'd get this stuff if it wasn't for drunk humans repeatedly crashing their ships.

Normally I'd settle down and get ready to haggle with you for an hour, but you're in luck; I'm too eager to crack these open. Cheers!
