==Objectives==
Slay 16 {{NPC||Deathstalker Invader||Deathstalker Invaders}} at [[Quel'Danil Lodge]].
* [[Deathstalker Invader]] x 16

==Description==
The undead are here! The [[Forsaken]]! They've been moving closer and closer, but to launch an all-out attack on us... those horrid abominations!

The young draenei I was charged with have trained with the Highvale elves in combat. They are not defenseless, but they need help!

Please, <name>, assist them! Drive back the Forsaken! 

==Progress==
Please, you must assist the Highvale!

==Completion==
Such aberrations in the face of the light... You are brave to face them, <name>.

==Notes==
After this quest, and [[The Highvale Documents]] are completed, the entire melee will phase out.

The follow-up quests (once this and [[The Highvale Documents]] are complete) are found inside the lodge, from [[Gilda Cloudcaller]].
