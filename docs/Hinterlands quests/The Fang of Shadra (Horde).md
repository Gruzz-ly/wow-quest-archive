==Objectives==
Collect the Fang of Shadra from the [[Creeping Ruin]]s.
* [[Fang of Shadra]]

==Description==
We'll need the Fang of Shadra next.

It's kept in the Creeping Ruins to the east, guarded by Shadra's own spawn. Hideous spiders the size of a dwarf, and twice as strong. Their venom is strong, <name>... don't get careless. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||35}}

==Progress==
Have you got the fang?

==Completion==
There it is... only one left.

== Notes ==
As with the [[Eye of Shadra]], the Fang is in a [[Cache of Shadra]], though at the [[Creeping Ruin]] rather than [[Agol'watha]].
