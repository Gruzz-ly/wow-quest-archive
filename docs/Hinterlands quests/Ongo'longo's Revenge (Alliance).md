==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Ongo'longo.jpg|Ongo'longo|Get him angry, then get out of his way!}}
Fight Ongo'longo until he breaks free.
* [[Ongo'longo]] enraged

==Description==
I've got a plan to pit troll against troll.

The [[Vilebranch tribe|Vilebranch]] have a big ol' dire troll locked up in a pit with some flimsy-lookin' chains. I've seen those things fight, and there's no way those'll hold if that big brute gets swingin' mad!

I want you to find the [[dire troll]] and fight him, <name>. Don't kill him... just smack him around til' he's seein' red, then let him break free and get out of his way! He'll be a big pain for the Vilebranch. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35|}}
*3600 [[XP]] 

==Progress==
I ain't seen a ruckus up there yet!

==Completion==
Ain't that a hoot!  Wish I could've seen it myself.

==Progression==
{{Hero's Call: The Hinterlands!}}
