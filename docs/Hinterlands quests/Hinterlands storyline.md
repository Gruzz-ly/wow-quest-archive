[[File:WorldMap-Hinterlands.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

The '''[[Hinterlands]]''' are a level {{level|Hinterlands}} [[contested]] zone. Both [[Alliance]] and [[Horde]] players arrive here from a tunnel in the [[Arathi Highlands]], but after that, their directions diverge. At first, the factions deal with the rivalry between the [[Wildhammer clan]] and [[Revantusk tribe]]; eventually, they discover a cult of spider-worshiping [[Vilebranch]] trolls in [[Jintha'Alor]] and summon and defeat their deity, [[Shadra]] the Venom Queen.

The progress for the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Hinterlands Quests]].
