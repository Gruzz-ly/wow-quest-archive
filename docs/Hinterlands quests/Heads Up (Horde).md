==Objectives==
Defeat [[Umboda Three-Heads]] and collect his head.
*[[Umboda's Head]]

==Description==
Umboda of the [[Vilebranch]] is one of their strongest warriors, and a sick butcher.

He takes the heads of all he slays as trinkets, rewards...even weapons!  It's his turn to be taken.

Find Umboda "Three-Heads", slay him, and bring me HIS head! We'll see how the Vilebranch fight when we throw it back over their walls!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35}}
*3,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let's see it! 

==Completion==
The look of fear and confusion on his face... this is what he deserved! Let's make sure all the Vilebranch wear the same look. 

==Progression==
