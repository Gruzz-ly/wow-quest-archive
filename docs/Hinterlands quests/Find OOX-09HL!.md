This quest involves one of {{questchain|Oglethorpe's Homing Robots}}.

==Objectives==
Take the distress beacon to Oglethorpe's homing robot at the head of the river in [[the Hinterlands]], near [[Skulk Rock]]. 
*[[OOX-09/HL Distress Beacon]] (Provided)

==Description==
You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal. Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption! A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life.

"My name's [[Oglethorpe Obnoticus]], and my homing robot has crashed! I will reward you for its recovery; please take this beacon to the robot!"

"I now have computed the coordinates of the robot for you; it crashed at the head of the river near Skulk Rock!" 

==Progress==
You appear to have uncovered the wreckage of... a robotic chicken? &nbsp;The voice from within the egg crackles to life again:

"Yes, excellent work! &nbsp;This is indeed my homing robot, though my sensors indicate that it needs a jump start before it can fly back to [[Booty Bay]] for repairs. &nbsp;Go ahead and place the beacon inside the rover - the beacon will take care of the rest!" 

==Completion==
You place the egg... distress beacon... inside the chicken... homing robot.

Hums and whirs are heard from inside the robot as it struggles to stand up. &nbsp;After the robot comes to life, Oglethorpe's voice is heard once more, but now from inside the robot:

"OOX-09/HL is working at least, but it needs major repairs! &nbsp;It is much too heavy for you to carry it... but I think I have an idea. &nbsp;Are you up for watching over it some more?" 

== Rewards ==
*4400 [[XP]] (or {{cost||26|40}} at level 70)
*-250 [[reputation]] with [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]
