==Objectives==
Bring the Tablet of Shadra to [[Darkcleric Marnal]].
*[[Tablet of Shadra]] (provided)

==Description==
We can't toss that tablet aside just yet, <name>. We can use it...

You see, I'm quite taken with the venom of the [[spider]]s here. It's clearly [[magic]]al, probably related to that [[Shadra|spider-god]] the [[Forest troll|trolls]] are involved with. And if that tablet will allow someone to summon it...

Well, you can see where this is going. The [[Horde]] can't pass up this opportunity. Take the tablet to my fellow [[Forsaken]]. They're to the west, at the [[Hiri'watha Research Station|research station]] in the [[Hiri'watha]] ruins.

==Rewards==
You will also receive: {{cost||17}}

==Completion==
Ah, what have we here...

Fascinating. Quite fascinating.

==Progression==
