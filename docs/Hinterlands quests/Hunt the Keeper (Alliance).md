==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Morta'gya the Keeper.jpg|Morta'gya the Keeper|She'll be cowering in the back of the cave, no doubt.}}
Kill [[Morta'gya the Keeper]] and obtain the Tablet of Shadra.
*[[Tablet of Shadra]]

==Description==
Shadra the spider loa... the venom queen, a spirit of darkness and death! If there's been a sacrifice, they're trying to bring her forth as a last-ditch effort.

If the Vilebranch are performing rituals, I'm not going to let them finish.

Check the cave behind the altar at the top of Jintha'Alor. Deep within it, one of Shadra's keepers might still be lurking. Kill her and take whatever she carries back here so we can know what's going on.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Unkeeper Blade
|Leggings of Secret Rituals
|Gloves of Strange Words
|Tablet-Bearer's Pauldrons
|Gauntlets of Strange Words
|Talon Hatchet
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 2,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Be sure you search her body.  I don't want any traps laid by the Vilebranch to be hidden by their deaths.

==Completion==
A tablet!  If I can read this... this is a ritual to summon Shadra herself into this world., and a list of the idols needed.

You've done a good job slaying the keeper and getting ahold of this, <name>.
