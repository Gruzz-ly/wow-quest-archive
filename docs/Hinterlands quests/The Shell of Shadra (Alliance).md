==Description==
The final piece is all we need to burn [[Shadra]] out for good.

The Shell of Shadra is held by the spider god's last living high priestess, [[Qiaga the Keeper]]. She stands atop the [[Altar of Zul]], guarded by other fanatical zealots.

You've got to climb that altar to the top and take her out! She'll have the Shell in her possession. Bring it back here.
