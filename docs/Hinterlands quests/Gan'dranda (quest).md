==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Gan'dranda.jpg|Gan'dranda|Our dwarves stand a much better chance once this brute is dead on the ground.}}
Kill Gan'dranda.
*[[Gan'dranda]] slain

==Description==
As fun as it is to butt heads with these trolls, we've got other things to do down here. It'd be nice to get this battle over with, aye?

Their commander, Gan'dranda, sits in the ruined walls to the southeast of the battlefield. Our boys have most of their forces locked up, so I want you to slip in there and take out Gan'dranda. When they see a <race> standin' over the corpse of their biggest hero it should take some of the fight out of 'em! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ironsight Crossbow

|Head Kickers
|Stormfeather Treads
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Don't try and tell me you're done already?  I don't like askin' people to bring back heads as proof, it's always a damn hassle.

==Completion==
Now that's what I like to hear!  Good on ya.
