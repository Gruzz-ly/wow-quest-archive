==Objectives==
Kill 10 Jade Oozes.
*[[Jade Ooze]]  slain (10)

==Description==
Years ago, there used to be a Horde base deep within Skulk Rock. It's been abandoned since then, but it's still prime territory, worth reclaiming.

The problem is, it's full of oozes by now. They're nasty things... mindless, corrosive, eat anything they find.

I need someone brave to go to Skulk Rock and get rid of those slimes. Are you brave enough, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||30|}}
*2700 [[XP]] 

==Completion==
It's good to see you back... and not missing any limbs, either.

==Progression==
