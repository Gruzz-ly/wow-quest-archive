==Objectives==
Collect 5 Vessels of Tainted Blood from [[Jintha'alor]].
*[[Vessel of Tainted Blood]] (5)

==Description==
The Vilebranch trolls here used to drink the corrupted blood of the god Hakkar himself for power. They boiled it in crude pots before drinking, dark vessels full of unholy strength.

Hakkar was killed long ago, of course. But the interesting thing... I still see some cauldrons bubbling up there. Bring me back a few and we'll see just what they've got cooking.

==Reward==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Sandals of Tainted Blood#Horde|Sandrene's Invisible Vest#Horde|Spider Venom Leggings#Horde|Dark Vessel Breastplate#Horde|Sandrene's Invisible Hauberk#Horde|Spider Venom Legguards#Horde}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||35}}
*3,600 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Be careful near those cauldrons, <class>. The Vilebranch won't let you take their treats without a fight.

==Completion==
First the spiders and now this. I can smell the venom in this blood... it's the same as the skitterlings, but stronger.

The Vilebranch and spiders... there's some potential here.
