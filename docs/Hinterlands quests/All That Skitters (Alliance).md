==Objectives==
Collect 8 Skittering Spiderlings in Jintha'Alor.
* [[Skittering Spiderling]] (8)

==Description==
There's somethin' I've noticed up there... [[Jintha'Alor]]'s full of spiders. Small ones about as big as yer hand. Not an unusual sight for the [[Hinterlands]], but somethin's amiss.

To be honest, I don't trust the [[troll]]s to keep pets. They're up to somethin'. I need you to bring me some of those spiders. Keep 'em alive if you can, and we'll see what the spirits tell me...

==Rewards==
You will also receive: {{cost||35}}

==Progress==
Let's see what you've got.

==Completion==
By Kurdan{{sic}}'s beard... these don't look like any spiders I've seen before.  Dark magic's at work here.

==Notes==
The title of this quest is a reference to the saying "[[Wikipedia:All that glitters is not gold|All that glitters is not gold]]".
