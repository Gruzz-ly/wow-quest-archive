==Objectives==
Collect a Direglob Sample from The Direglob.
*[[Direglob Sample]]

==Description==
I've become very interested in the slimes inhabiting Skulk Rock. No matter how many times they're cleared out, they seem to return, yet it doesn't seem they're capable of reproducing from a single slime.

I think something's growing in there. There's a source where all the slimes come from, and I want to study it. Find this source, and bring me back a sample.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Research Assistant's Wand
|Slime Hunter Headguard
|Skulk Rock Belt
|Slime Hunter Headgear
|Goopy Mallet
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Well? What did you find?

==Completion==
Fascinating... How large did you say it was? I wonder if others could be found intact...

This sample is excellent. I'll be sharing it with my fellow researchers.

==Progression==
