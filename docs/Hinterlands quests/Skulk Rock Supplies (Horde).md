==Objectives==
Collect 5 Ooze-Coated Supply Crates.
* [[Ooze-Coated Supply Crate]] (5)

==Description==
I was at Skulk Rock during the second war. I was young, years before I met my mate, and I still remember the chaos when the Alliance attacked us. We fled with the orcs, without any time to gather our belongings.

It was all left behind. Skulk Rock is still full of our old supplies. We could use them here at the village... and more importantly, the Wildhammer shouldn't get their filthy hands on them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||30}}

==Progress==
How many crates did you find?

==Completion==
They're still intact! There's a lot of memories in these crate. Let's see what we've got in the first one...

Hey, banana bread! And it's still fresh!

Here, mon, I'll take this and you can pick something else.
