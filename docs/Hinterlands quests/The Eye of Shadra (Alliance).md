==Objectives==
Recover the Eye of Shadra from [[Agol'watha]].
* [[Eye of Shadra]]

==Description==
[[Gryphon Master Talonaxe]] has sent me here to deal with [[Shadra]], the Venom Queen. The conquest of [[Jintha'Alor]] isn't enough... the trolls could regroup and summon this creature later, when we're not expecting it.

We'll gather the artifacts first, pull Shadra into this world on our own terms, and put our hammers to that foul creature. I'll need you to help find the artifacts, and put a hurt on the rest of the trolls while you're at it.

We first need the Eye of Shadra, guarded in Agol'watha to the north. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||35}}

==Progress==
Was the tablet right?  Did you find the eye?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>.  We'll be knockin' on this bug's door in no time.

== Notes ==
The Eye of Shadra is in the [[Cache of Shadra]], in the center tent in the back of Agol'watha.
