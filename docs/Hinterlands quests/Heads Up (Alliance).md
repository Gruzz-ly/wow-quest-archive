==Objectives==
Defeat [[Umboda Three-Heads]] and collect his head.
*[[Umboda's Head]]

==Description==
Umboda Three-Heads is one o' the biggest trolls you'll see around. He's a savage butcher, takin' heads for his own collection, dwarf and troll alike! It's time he got what he deserved.

Look for the big brute on the lower terraces, and you take his own head right back here!

*3600 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|2160}} at max level)

==Progress==
Let's see it! 

==Completion==
That's one ugly mug. Maybe he was takin' other heads tryin' to find a prettier one!
