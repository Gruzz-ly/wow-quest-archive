==Objectives==
Use Gryphon Chow to feed 7 Trained Razorbeak gryphons.
*[[Trained Razorbeak]] fed (7)
*[[Gryphon Chow]] (provided)

==Description==
Our clan reveres the gryphon as a sacred animal. They're majestic creatures of the skies, and more than just beasts; they're intelligent and cunning.

Some say we keep them, but it's more of a friendship. If you want to befriend the Wildhammer here, first befriend our gryphons! Take this bag o' chow, it's nice and fresh. Our trained razorbeak gryphons wander the forests to the south of the aviary. Go on and feed a few of 'em for me, aye?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Razorbeak Amulet
|Gryphon-Down Scarf
|Gryphon Master's Belt
|Talon Axe
|Gryphon Master's Chain
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Don't go tryin' to give those to the gryphons inside here, now.  They've already been fed plenty.

==Completion==
Treat them with respect, and they'll treat you with it as well.

Give 'em guff and you'll be out an eye!

== Notes ==
When fed the trained gryphons rise straight up in the air and disappear.  (They no longer need to forage, you fed them.)
