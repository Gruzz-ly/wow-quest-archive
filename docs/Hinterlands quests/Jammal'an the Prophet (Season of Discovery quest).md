==Objectives==
Obtain [[Jammal'an the Prophet (Season of Discovery)|Jammal'an the Prophet]]'s Head.
*[[Head of Jammal'an]]

==Description==
My [[Witherbark tribe|Witherbark]] companions don't take kindly to strangers around their home.

Me? I don't have a home anymore. I was exiled from my people, the great [[Atal'ai tribe]] of the [[Swamp of Sorrows]].

Our spiritual leader, Jammal'an, had what he called a [[prophecy]]. He believes the summoning of the god, [[Hakkar the Soulflayer|Hakkar]] will bring the Atal'ai [[immortality]].

But I urged caution. What if the prophecy was nothing more than manipulation?

I want revenge for my exile. Bring me Jammal'an's head. Maybe then my people will be free.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Rainstrider Leggings (Season of Discovery)]]
*[[Helm of Exile (Season of Discovery)]]

You will also receive:
*5900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Once Jammal'an has been removed, I stand a chance of returning to my people.

With Jammal'an as their spiritual leader, the Atal'ai face certain destruction.

==Completion==
Jammal'an's reckless trust of false visions led my people to their eternal doom.

I thank you, <class>, for avenging my exile. I mourn for my people. I have no home to return to.
