There are actually three different Alliance quests that are called "The Battle for Andorhal".  They differ in where they start, and who offers them.  At least one differs in text as well.  See: [[The Battle for Andorhal (Alliance)]]

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Guthrum Thunderfist]] to fly to [[Andorhal]] in [[Western Plaguelands]].  Then report to [[Thassarian]] within Andorhal.

==Description==
I just got word, <lad/lass>.  It doesn't sound good.

The city of Andorhal is in the middle of a three-way war between the [[Forsaken]], the [[Alliance]], and the [[Scourge]].  [[Varian Wrynn|King Wrynn]] has rolled the dice and sent a death knight to lead the charge for his cause, but I'm sure he can use all the help he can get.

I hate to see you go, but they've asked for you by name, <name>.  Speak with Guthrum Thunderfist outside.  He'll put you on the first gryphon out to Andorhal.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||9}}

==Completion==
It's about time you arrived, <class>.

==Notes==
On accepting this quest, Guthrum Thunderfist (flight master at [[Aerie Peak]]) gains a dialog option:
:I need a gryphon, Guthrum.  I'm headed to Western Plaguelands.  My king needs me!
