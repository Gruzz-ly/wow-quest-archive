==Objectives==
Speak with {{NPC||Anchorite Traska}} at the [[Quel'Danil Lodge]].

==Description==
I may appear far from home to you, <class>, but quite a few of my people were led here by Ambassador Rualeth. We have settled with the high elves of the Quel'Danil Lodge, to the east, to train in the ways of the Light and enjoy the peaceful beauty of this land.

Such peace may be short lived. We have seen the Horde moving further west from here. Could you travel to Quel'Danil and give warning to Anchorite Traska? Her cabin is just north of the main lodge. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||17}}

==Completion==

<Screams and the clash of metal break out to the south.>

Upon completion of this quest, a large number of melee fights between [[Highvale Vindicator]]s and [[Highvale Swiftblade]]s on the Alliance side, and  [[Deathstalker Invader]]s on the Horde side, will phase in.
