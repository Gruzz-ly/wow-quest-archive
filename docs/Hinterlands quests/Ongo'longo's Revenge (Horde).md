==Objectives==
Fight Ongo'longo until he breaks free.
* [[Ongo'longo]] enraged

==Description==
Ongo'longo was one of us. What outsiders called a Dire Troll, but he was a Revantusk, and a proud warrior like all of us!

Then the Vilebranch took him. They keep him chained up in a pit at the top of Jintha'Alor, made to dance for their sick amusement.

No chains can hold Ongo'longo. All you need to do is raise his temper, <name>. Fight him until he's enraged enough to remember his true spirit and break free... and then get out of the way!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35|}}
*3,600 [[XP]] 

==Completion==
I wish I could have been there to see it, <name>! I'll have to hear the story from Ongo'longo himself when this is over.

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Command: The Hinterlands!}}
