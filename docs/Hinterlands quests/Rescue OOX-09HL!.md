'''Rescue OOX-09/HL!''' involves one of {{questchain|Oglethorpe's Homing Robots}}, and is a prerequisite for [[An OOX of Your Own]].

==Objectives==
Escort OOX-09/HL to the shoreline beyond Overlook Cliff, then report to [[Oglethorpe Obnoticus]] in [[Booty Bay]]. 
*Escort OOX-09/HL to the shoreline beyond Overlook Cliff

==Description==
The gnome's voice crackles once again from the robot:

"I need to move OOX-09/HL to an open, safe place so it can begin a lengthy take-off procedure. It has built-in cloaking, but I need time on my end to make it operational again. Escort the robot from its current location to, let's say, the shoreline beyond Overlook Cliff! That should be a perfect place, and long enough, to get things online!"

"Escort it safely to the shore, and then come talk to me in Booty Bay! [[Oglethorpe Obnoticus]] - out!" 

==Completion==
Oh, YOU'RE the great savior of OOX-09/HL! &nbsp;I cannot even begin to express my thanks for your assistance! &nbsp;My homing robot series needs more development, but your recovery has saved me countless hours of extra rebuilding time, as well as many gold pieces in manufacture costs!

Please, take your choice of any of these items I have. &nbsp;Thank you again for your generous assistance <name>, my robots and I are in your debt! 

==Reward==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*5450 [[XP]] (or {{cost||33|}} at level 70)
*-350 [[reputation]] with [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]]
*350 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]
*Your choice of
**[[Gnomish Inventor Boots]]
**[[Gnomish Water Sinking Device]]

== Notes ==
You will be ambushed three times during this quest.
* 3 slimes near [[Skulk Rock]]
* 3 Owlbeasts along the road
* 3 trolls near the cliffs.

If the chicken does not see you fighting, it will not stop.  It is possible, therefore, to do a ranged attack on the ambushers, and find the chicken and the ambushers passing each other without stopping.  If this happens, you can run up to the chicken dragging the mob with you.  The chicken will soon get the idea.

Another tactic used has been to aggro the ambushers while mounted, have them chase you a distance away from the chicken, then after the chicken has passed the ambush point, run away to lose aggro and catch up again.

While this quest is not impossible to solo, having a friend along is recommended.
