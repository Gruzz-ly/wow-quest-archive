==Objectives==
Kill 5 Vilebranch Blood Drinkers and 5 Vilebranch Soul Eaters in [[Jintha'Alor]].
*[[Vilebranch Soul Eater]] slain (5)
*[[Vilebranch Blood Drinker]] slain (5)

==Description==
Only the strongest and foulest [[Vilebranch tribe|Vilebranch]] are left now. The soul eaters and blood drinkers, foul worshippers of the evil [[god]] [[Hakkar the Soulflayer|Hakkar]].

They are FOOLS! They cling to old, defeated beliefs. I won't tolerate their crimes against the [[Revantusk tribe|Revantusk]] any longer.

Strike the final blow. Claim [[Jintha'Alor]] for the Revantusk... claim it for the [[Horde]]!
