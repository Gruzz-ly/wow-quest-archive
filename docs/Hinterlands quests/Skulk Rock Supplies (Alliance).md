==Objectives==
Collect 5 Ooze-Coated Supply Crates.
* [[Ooze-Coated Supply Crate]] (5)

==Description==
I had a cousin in the [[Second War|second war]]! He used to tell me all about when they led a raid on [[Skulk Rock]]. Swept in there and drove the [[troll]]s out like rats from a nest. They chased right after 'em all the way to [[Alterac Mountains|Alterac]]!

The slimes moved in right quick after that, and there's still cratefuls of old [[Horde]] goods sittin' in there. I say we don't let the trolls get it back!

Bring me back a few crates from Skulk Rock to the northwest. 

==Progress==
You got the crates?

==Completion==
Looks like it's still good inside!  Huh... is that [[Soft Banana Bread|banana bread]]?  Still fresh!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||30}}

==Progression==
