==Objectives==
Collect 12 bottles of Pupellyverbos Port
* [[Pupellyverbos Port]] (12)

==Description==
Now, I know we've got a little battle ragin' and all that, but down at the overlook cliffs are some nice lookin' bottles strewn all over the place. I don't want good drink to fall into the hands o' the Horde!

If you're down that way, collect the bottles for me and bring 'em back here. I'll pay in full for it as if you bottled 'em yourself.

==Progress==
About 12 should do the trick, aye?

==Completion==
That's the stuff!  Wouldnt' want any trolls or goblins gettin' pleasure out of these, now would we?

Maybe I can work a bit of this into my next brew...

==Rewards==
You will receive:{{cost||22}}
