==Objectives==
Recover the Eye of Shadra from [[Agol'watha]].
* [[Eye of Shadra]]

==Description==
Shadra must be summoned, for certain. To allow an opportunity like this to pass us by would be foolish. While the apothecaries can make fine use of the god's venom, they are relatively inexperienced in ritual magic.

Fortunately, I am quite familiar with preparing dark convocations. You will bring the scattered parts of Shadra to me, and I will help you bring her to this plane to be taken out.

The first part is the eye of Shadra, guarded in Agol'watha to the north.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||35}}

==Progress==
If the tablet was a ruse, I will not be pleased. Did you find the eye?

==Completion==
I'm pleased, <name>. That was quicker than I expected.

== Notes ==
The Eye of Shadra is in the [[Cache of Shadra]], in the center tent in the back of Agol'watha.
