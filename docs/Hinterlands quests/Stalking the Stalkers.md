==Objectives==
Kill 8 Silvermane Stalkers. 
*[[Silvermane Stalker]] slain (8)

==Description==
Many brave [[troll]]s have been lost to the harsh wilds of the Hinterlands, <race>. The Silvermane [[Wolf|wolves]] are one of the biggest threats to our hunters. They lay in wait, hiding amongst the bushes and landscape, then strike out when the opportunity presents itself.

This type of ferocity will not go unchecked!

You must think like the Silvermane. Stalk the stalkers! Slay them all!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||30}}
*2,710 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Show them the might of Revantusk!

==Completion==
A job well done, <race>. The Revantusk thank you for your contribution.

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Command: The Hinterlands!}}
