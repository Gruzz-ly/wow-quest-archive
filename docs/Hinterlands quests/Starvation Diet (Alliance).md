==Objectives==
Destroy 6 Cocooned Victims at the [[Creeping Ruin]]s.
* [[Cocooned Victim]] slain (6)

==Description==
The [[Creeping Ruin]] to the east is crawling with fully-grown [[Shadraspawn Venomspitter|Shadraspawn spiders]]. They're large enough to drag off an entire [[dwarf]] in the night, and you'll see evidence enough of that when you get there... bodies are cocooned all through the ruins.

They don't keep them alive for long, <name>, but they feed off the bodies for days. It's too late to save the victims, but we can't let those spiders grow fat and thrive. Make sure you get rid of those cocoons.

==Progress==
Gettin' cold feet now?  Don't let the spiders win.

==Completion==
A grim task for sure, <name>, but it'll keep the spiders left alive from recovering.  I thank you.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||35}}

==Progression==
{{Shadra quest chain}}
