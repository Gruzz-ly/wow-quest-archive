Both this quest and [[Ongo'longo's Revenge]] must be completed to continue on to [[Summit of Fate]].

==Objectives==
Collect 5 Vessels of Tainted Blood from [[Jintha'alor]].
*[[Vessel of Tainted Blood]] (5)

==Description==
The [[Vilebranch tribe|Vilebranch trolls]] here were always worshippers of the foul god [[Hakkar the Soulflayer|Hakkar]], the loa of blood. He was a sick and twisted entity that nearly broke through to our world, but he was defeated long ago.

The Vilebranch are still stirring their dark cauldrons, ones they filled with blood years before. They're either holding onto hope for a long-dead spirit, or they're up to something new and just as sinister.

Get me those vessels, <name>. We need to examine them with the spiders and see just what's going on here! 

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Sandals of Tainted Blood|Sandrene's Invisible Vest|Spider Venom Leggings|Dark Vessel Breastplate|Sandrene's Invisible Hauberk|Spider Venom Legguards}}

You will also receive:
*3600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Be careful near those cauldrons, <class>.  The Vilebranch won't give them up easily!

==Completion==
This isn't just blood... it's venom!

Spiders... venom... I hope I'm wrong about my hunches here, <name>.

==Notes==
Even though the map shows locations covering all of Jintha'Alor, the cauldrons can only be found on the top two levels.

This quest has a followup quest (likely [[Summit of Fate]]) for which the character may not yet have met the qualifications.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=[[Sandrene's Invisible Hauberk]] and [[Spider Venom Legguards]] added as rewards.}}
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
