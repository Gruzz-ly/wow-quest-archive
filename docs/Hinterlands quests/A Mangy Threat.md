==Objectives==
Kill 8 Mangy Silvermanes.
*[[Mangy Silvermane]] slain (8)

==Description==
We do everything we can to protect our kin and our gryphons. That includes chasin' off predators, whether they be from the forest or from the Horde.

I won't ask you to save us from two-legged monsters just yet. Mangy silvermane prowl the woods to the south where our gryphons range, and they're known to get 'em if they stray too low. Hunt a few of the silvermane and make sure they know our gryphons aren't food.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|3000}} (or {{coppercost|1920}} at max level)
*3150 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|1920}} at max level)

==Progress==
You be sportin' with those wolves now.

==Completion==
Much appreciated, <name>. 

==Progression==
{{Hero's Call: The Hinterlands!}}
