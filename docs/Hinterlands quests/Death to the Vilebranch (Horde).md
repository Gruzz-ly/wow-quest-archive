==Objectives==
Kill 5 Vilebranch Berserkers and 5 Vilebranch Shadowcasters in [[Jintha'Alor]].
* [[Vilebranch Berserker]] slain (5)
* [[Vilebranch Shadowcaster]] slain (5)

==Description==
We won't give them a chance to react. You must re-enter Jintha'Alor and charge all the way to the upper tiers.

The Vilebranch berserkers and shadowcasters are dangerous enemies, <name>. When the others see their bodies thrown across the walls, they'll know we mean business.

Don't leave any Vilebranch hearts beating!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35|}}
*2,900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It won't be long until we're the only trolls left breathing on these walls.

==Notes==
On completion, players unlock the ability to teleport between [[Kotonga]] and the [[Totem of Akil'darah]], allowing faster access to the objectives in the last part of the questline.
:{{Text|say|Kotonga|We've retaken the Idol of Akil'darah thanks to you, <name>! Come over here and I'll take you deep into Jintha'Alor on the winds of her blessin'!}}

Kotonga's gossip:
{{Dialogue|
The eagle spirit of the Hinterlands be on our side now, <name>.

With her idol free from the Vilebranch, I can transport you straight to it on the upper tier of Jintha'Alor. Strike at their hearts!
