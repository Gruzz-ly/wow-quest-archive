==Objectives==
Kill 5 Vilebranch Witch Doctors and 5 Vilebranch Headhunters in Jintha'Alor.
* [[Vilebranch Headhunter]] slain (5)
* [[Vilebranch Witch Doctor]] slain (5)

==Description==
The [[Vilebranch tribe|Vilebranch]] are a different tribe from the [[Revantusk tribe|Revantusk]], but the difference is academic. Far as we're concerned the only good troll is a dead troll!

But make no mistake, the Vilebranch are just as nasty even without the [[Horde]]'s chain around their neck. They'll poison this whole land unless we take this stand and get rid of them

You can start with their witchdoctors and headhunters on the lower tier. Let me know when you've killed a fair share of 'em.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35|}}
*2900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Not afraid of a few trolls, are we?

==Completion==
Aye, we'll have these trolls cleared out yet.

==Notes==
A quest does follow from this quest, but the character may not "meet the requirements for it" for it to be automatically offered.

==Progression==
{{Hero's Call: The Hinterlands!}}
