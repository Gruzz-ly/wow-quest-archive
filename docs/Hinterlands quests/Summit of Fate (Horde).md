==Objectives==
Collect 8 Spider Idols from the [[Vilebranch tribe|Vilebranch]] at the summit of [[Jintha'Alor]].
* [[Spider Idol]] (8)

==  Description ==
You've done well cleaving through their warriors, <name>. I'd like you to investigate the summit of Jintha'Alor.

We were prepared for our fiercest battle there, to storm their dark altar, but it's too quiet. Not a sound. It could be a terrible trap, and someone strong should look into it first instead of all of us rushing in.

And if it's not a trap... I'm very interested in finding out what happened up there. Bring me back any clues you can find.

==  Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35}}
*2,900 [[XP]] 

==Progress==
What did you find?

==  Completion ==
Dead? All of them, around the altar? And you found these spider idols on them...

A mass sacrifice. They threw their lives to Shadra.

==Progression==
