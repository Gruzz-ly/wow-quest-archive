==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Revantusk Stalker]]s or [[Revantusk Hexxer]]s.
* Revantusk slain (10)

==Description==
These [[Revantusk tribe|Revantusk trolls]] think they're special for bein' in the [[Horde]].  Makes me laugh!

See, the funny part is, it doesn't matter if they're part of the Horde, or some kinda [[Amani Empire|troll empire]], or the bloody [[Burning Legion]] for that matter.  We've fought trolls in these lands for a few centuries now.

In fact, I'll be kind enough to let you lend a hand, <lad/lass>!  Grab a weapon and head out to the battlefield and help our boys to the east.

==Progress==
Still here?  I hope you're not expectin' a pot o' tea an' a footrub, 'cause some of us have work to do.

==Completion==
Not bad for a city-dwellin' <race>.  Good show, aye!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||30}}

==Progression==
