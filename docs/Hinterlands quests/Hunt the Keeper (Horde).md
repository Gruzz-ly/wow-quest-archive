==Objectives==
Kill Morta'gya the Keeper and obtain the Tablet of Shadra.
*[[Tablet of Shadra]]

==Description==
Kotonga has told me of Shadra. She is the venom queen, the loa of spiders, worshipped in darkness. If the Vilebranch are performing rituals, I'm not going to let them finish.

Check the cave behind the altar at the top of Jintha'Alor. Deep within it, one of Shadra's keepers might still be lurking. Kill her and take whatever she carries back here so we can know what's going on.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Unkeeper Blade
|Leggings of Secret Rituals
|Gloves of Strange Words
|Tablet-Bearer's Pauldrons
|Gauntlets of Strange Words#Horde
|Talon Hatchet
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 2,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Be sure you search her body. I don't want any traps laid by the Vilebranch to be hidden by their deaths.

==Completion==
The parts scattered, the keepers separated... I see.

This is a ritual to summon Shadra. They must not have gotten far. It should be destroyed...
