==Objectives==
Collect the Highvale Report, the Highvale Records, and the Highvale Notes.
* [[Highvale Report (item)]]
* [[Highvale Records (item)]]
* [[Highvale Notes (item)]]

==Description==
The Highvale have kept detailed records here for years. Deaths, births, seasons... but also vital scouting information and methods of contact with the rest of the Alliance.

The documents will be scattered in the chaos. If they fall into the hands of the Forsaken, more lives could be at risk! Please, you must retrieve the documents before they are taken by the Horde... 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||75}}

==Progress==
Are they safe?

==Completion==
Thank the Light. We will not let the Forsaken have anything that can be turned against us, no matter how small. 

==Notes==
After this quest, and [[In Defense of Quel'Danil]] are completed, the entire fight will phase out.

* The [[Highvale Records]] are in the NE (right) wing of the main lodge.
* The [[Highvale Notes]] are near the well to the west of the lodge.
* The [[Highvale Report]] is to the NW of the lodge, on a wooden table in a gazebo.

The follow-up quests (once this and [[In Defense of Quel'Danil]] are complete) are found inside the lodge, from [[Gilda Cloudcaller]].
