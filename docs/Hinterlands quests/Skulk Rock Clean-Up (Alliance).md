==Objectives==
Kill 10 Jade Oozes.
*[[Jade Ooze]]  slain (10)

==Description==
Years ago, there used to be a [[Horde]] base deep within [[Skulk Rock]]. It's been abandoned since then, but it's still prime territory, worth takin' for our allies!

Problem is, it's full of dwarf-eating slimes and oozes. Those things are slightly less disgustin' than trolls, but they'll still give us a hassle.

With our boys tied up fightin' the [[Revantusk tribe|Revantusk]], I need you to go to Skulk Rock and clear the place out for me. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||30|}}
*2700 [[XP]] 

==Progress==
Don't get caught offguard.  Even if one slime doesn't seem like much, once one gets you pinned down... the others won't be far behind.

==Completion==
It's good to see you back... and not missing any limbs, either.

==Progression==
{{Hero's Call: The Hinterlands!}}

==Patch changes==
