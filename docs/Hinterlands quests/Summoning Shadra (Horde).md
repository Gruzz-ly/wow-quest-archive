==Objectives==
Use the Idol of Shadra at the Northwestern, Southwestern, and Eastern Temples in [[Shadra'Alor]].
*Northwestern Temple
*Eastern Temple
*Southwestern Temple
*[[Idol of Shadra]] (provided)

==Description==
The idol is prepared, <name>. I trust that you are as well?

You will go southwest to Shadra'Alor ahead of us with the idol. You'll need to use the idol at each of the three temples.

When you do that, [[Shadra]] will be summoned to this realm. The [[Deathstalkers]] and I will be along shortly to subdue and harvest her body. Speak with the lookout I've sent ahead once you've performed the ritual, and await my arrival.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Darkcleric Marnal|Marnal]] draws close... and Shadra even closer. Prepare for bloodshed.

==Progression==
