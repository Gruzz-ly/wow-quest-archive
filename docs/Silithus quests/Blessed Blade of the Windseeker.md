==Objectives==
Locate the lost blade of the Windseeker.
* Thunderfury located
* [[Damaged Thunderfury]]

==Description==
So the [[Earthen Ring]] wishes to resurrect my master?

<[[Highlord Demitrian]] laughs maniacally.>

I knew this day would come! At last, humanity understands the power of the Windseeker!

When [[Prince Thunderaan]] was slain at the hands of treacherous mortals, his [[soul]] was trapped within the sacred blade [[Thunderfury]].

To resurrect my master you will need to find his sword and return it to [[Skywall]]. Last I heard, the betrayer who stole my master's sword traveled to the [[Broken Isles]] to fight [[demon]]s.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 15,480 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found the key to resurrecting Thunderaan?

==Completion==
This blade could indeed be the key to resurrecting the Windseeker. However, it has been damaged and the elemental soul within has diminished in power.

Time may very well be running out...

==Notes==
The blade can be found in [[Azsuna]] in the [[Fiendish Vault]] at {{coords|32|48|Azsuna}} in front of [[Ragemaw]].

==Progression==
{{Shaman artifact and class hall}}
