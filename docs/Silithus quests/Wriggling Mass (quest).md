==Objectives==
Locate someone who can explain the visions.
* [[Wriggling Mass]]

==Description==
<The tendril writhes and pulsates in your hand as your mind is assailed by all manner of vicious thoughts.

One vision in particular surfaces in your mind again and again.

In your mind's eye, you picture a many-eyed [[goat]] laying in a pool of black water. As you approach, its eyes burst open, and in an instant you find yourself looking upward at the goat from deep within the puddle.

As you sink into the icy darkness, everything goes black.

You pocket the mass and shake the thoughts from your head.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (700x [[Azerite (resource)]])
*{{cost|11|70|}}
*8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Please, lower your weapon, I mean you no harm. The whispers ceased speaking to me on the day that the wound opened.

I wish to spend my days atoning for what I have done with my life, perhaps I can help you.

You... I can see it in your eyes, you have seen the vision.

The goat, the pool, drowning in the icy blackness, does this sound familiar?

I can tell you its meaning. It means we are fast closing in on the end of [[Azeroth|this world]], friend.

Take my [[:Azerite]], I have no need of it any longer.
