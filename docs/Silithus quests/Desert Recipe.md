==Objectives==
Look for information about cooking [[:Sandworm Meat]] at the Twilight's Hammer camp west of [[Cenarion Hold]].

==Description==
Adapting to life in the desert has been difficult to say the least. Not only do I miss the birds and trees of [[Auberdine]] but our food selection is severely limited by this arid environment. I'm trying to learn about desert herbs, but there aren't many.

I've seen [[Twilight's Hammer]] groups from the camp west of here hunt sandworms for food. Sandworm meat is so bitter though, I can't imagine how they make it palatable. Keep your eyes open if you go to their camp and let me know if you learn anything.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3000 [[XP]]
*+20 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Completion==
This book contains several common recipes and a few unusual ones.  After browsing through it for a few seconds you spot a recipe that involves sandworm meat.

==Notes==
*285 Cooking appears to be the only prerequisite.
*You can find a sandy book on a wooden crate at {{coords|38|45|Silithus}}
