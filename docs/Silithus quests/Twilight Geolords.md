'''Twilight Geolords''' is the first quest in the '''Twilight Geolords''' quest chain.

== Objectives ==
Kill 10 Twilight Geolords, then return to [[Huum Wildmane]] in [[Cenarion Hold]].
*[[Twilight Geolord]]s slain (10)

== Description ==
The [[Twilight's Hammer]], an insane cult bent on destruction, set up camps in [[Silithus]] and perform rituals day and night.  We do not yet know their plans, but we do think they are somehow linked to the pulsing red crystals spread across the desert.

Although their mystery may one day be solved, we must first deal with their immediate threat.  Go to their camps to the west and seek out Twilight geolords.  They are the heads of these serpents; that is where we must strike!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|s=90}}

== Progress ==
Enter the desert and find the Twilight geolords, <name>.  Return to me after they are slain.

==Completion==
That was a task well performed, <name>. Your slaying of the Twilight geolords must have dealt a grievous blow to the cult. Let us hope their plans are slowed...

==Gains==
* 9550 [[XP]] (or {{cost||57}} at level 70)
* +500 reputation with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Patch changes==
