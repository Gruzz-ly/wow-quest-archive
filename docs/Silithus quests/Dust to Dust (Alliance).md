==Objectives==
Find and deliver 5 Silithyst to the Silithyst Extractor then speak with [[Chief Expeditionary Requisitioner Enkles]] at the [[Alliance]] encampment near [[Hive'Zora]].
*[[Silithyst]] delivered (5)

==Description==
Ah yes, the dangers of the desert. No, not the sweltering heat, not the unbearable sunlight, not the sand crawling up into your robes, not the freezing nights.

The other dangers! The bugs, and now the bothersome brutes. Our reconnaissance has reported the Horde are gathering dirt!

I usually wouldn't call this out of the ordinary for them, but Silithyst? I would rather they not uncover the secrets of the sand. As Chief Expeditionary Requisitioner I am requesting a competing order! Get me that dirt!

==Rewards==
You will receive>
*+100 [[reputation]] with the [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Very good <name>! Allow me to simply input this transaction into my logbook...

And here you are. If we have any other matters of requisition, I will direct them to you, and as Chief Expeditionary Requisitioner, I do expect assistance.

I unfortunately am not authorized to pay you, but I didn't get to where I am now by not rewarding my underlings! I have in my possession many recipes that were requested but never distributed. As reward, I will allow you to purchase from my library of abandoned knowledge.
