==Objectives==
Bring 10 Encrypted Twilight Texts to [[Bor Wildmane]] in [[Cenarion Hold]].
*[[Encrypted Twilight Text]] (10)

==Description==
Some of the [[Twilight's Hammer]] cultists carry around little papers with gibberish written on them. I want you to bring me a stack of them, <class>.

I can't figure out what the gibberish means, but that's not the point! These papers are how their different groups communicate secretly. The more texts we take out of circulation, the less they can communicate!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|80}}
*6600 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
Did you bring me some texts?

==Completion==
Excellent!  I'll stash these away, maybe they'll be useful later.

==Additional Notes==
This leads to [[Encrypted Twilight Texts]], which is a repeatable quest that allows you to turn in Encrypted Twilight Texts for reputation with Cenarion Circle.
