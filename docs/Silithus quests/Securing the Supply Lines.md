==Objectives==
[[Windcaller Proudhorn]] at [[Cenarion Hold]] in [[Silithus]] wants you to kill 15 Dredge Strikers.
*[[Dredge Striker]] slain (15)

==Description==
Cenarion Hold is a location of utmost strategic importance. I'm convinced that while we hold it our victory over the [[silithid]] is guaranteed. Provided our influx supplies can be maintained, that is.

Desert [[worm]]s have proven to be more of a threat to our supply caravans than even the silithid themselves. Just this morning, a large shipment of [[:morrowgrain]] was ravaged by a group of dredge strikers. I need you to thin their numbers to ensure our supplies aren't jeopardized.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||85|}}
*8,150 [[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
The dredge strikers are a serious threat and must be dealt with quickly!

==Completion==
You have my sincere gratitude.  Your efforts in helping Cenarion Hold have shown true courage.

==Progression==
* [[Hero's Call: Silithus!]]/[[Warchief's Command: Silithus!]] or [[The Dunes of Silithus]]/[[The Sands of Silithus]] (breadcrumb quests)
