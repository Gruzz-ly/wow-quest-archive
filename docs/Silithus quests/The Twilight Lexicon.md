==Objectives==
Bring the three chapters of the [[Twilight Lexicon]] to [[Hermit Ortell]] in [[Silithus]].
*[[Twilight Lexicon - Chapter 1]]
*[[Twilight Lexicon - Chapter 2]]
*[[Twilight Lexicon - Chapter 3]]

==Description==
The [[Twilight's Hammer]] are not kind to those that leave their ranks. They hunt me to this day like I'm some sort of beast! Needless to say, an enemy of theirs is a friend of mine!

To decipher this Tablet I'll need the book used by their scribes to encode secret messages: the Twilight Lexicon. It's such an important tool that they keep its three chapters in different locations! The officers entrusted with the Lexicon are known as [[Twilight Keeper]]s, look for them at the Twilight's Hammer camps.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||90}}
*8300 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
Who goes there?  Oh, it's you!  Did you find all the Lexicon chapters yet? 

==Completion==
Yes! These are the parts to the book!  Let's get started then, <name>.

Swap every third word with words from the second chapter... then swap every other word with words from the first chapter...  Wait, did I get that backwards?

*Chapter 2 is carried by [[Twilight Keeper Exeter]] at [[Twilight Outpost]]{{Coords|17|83|Silithus}}
