==Objectives==
Retrieve Noggle's Satchel from the mountains in the south of [[Silithus]] and return it to him at [[Cenarion Hold]].
*[[Noggle's Satchel]]

==Description==
Where am I? Where's my bag? *gasp* I must've lost it while fleeing from [[Deathclasp]], the giant [[scorpid]]. In my rush to escape I walked right into a nest of [[Stonelash Flayer|stonelash flayer]]s.

The satchel I was carrying had all sorts of rare [[reagent]]s in it. Without them, me and [[Beetix Ficklespragg|Beetix]] won't be able to make the [[potion]]s that [[Cenarion Hold]] needs. I'm too weak to get up yet, but I can make it worth your while if you bring back my reagents.

I ran into Deathclasp in the southern mountain range, behind Bronzebeard's camp.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|q1=2|Elixir of the Mongoose
|q2=2|Elixir of the Sages
}}

You will also receive:
*9000 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
Still haven't found my bag?  Well I should count my lucky stars, at least the poison's been cleansed.

==Completion==
Yes!  You brought my satchel back.  And my rare reagents are all here!  I'll be in your debt for a long time.
