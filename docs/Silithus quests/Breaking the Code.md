== Objectives ==
Obtain an intact Hive'Regal Silithid Brain from any silithid in [[Hive'Regal]].
*[[Hive'Regal Silithid Brain]]

== Description ==
I think I can formulate an elixir that will allow us to more readily decipher the glyphs and language of the [[silithid]] and [[Qiraji]]!

What do I need? Glad you asked! I need brains!

Normally I'd need a brain from each silithid type that inhabit the hives. Another brave explorer brought me two of 'em here... and never came back from Hive'Regal.

Bring me back a silithid brain from Hive'Regal... and be careful not to end up like him!

== Reward ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|70|}}
* 10,550 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Cenarion Circle]]

== Progress ==
Go play with the monkey, kid. I don't have time for this.

== Completion ==
Outstanding! Don't wander off too far, kid. We might need you to take on another task or two.
