==Objectives==
Take the restored tablet to [[Hermit Ortell]] in [[Silithus]].
*[[Restored Twilight Tablet]] (provided)

==Description==
There are rumors of a [[Twilight's Hammer]] member called Ortell having deserted his sect. Word has it he hid in the mountains south of [[Southwind Village]], where he lives as a hermit. Perhaps you can enlist his help in deciphering the tablet.

Take the restored tablet with you and seek out Ortell.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
You!  How did you find me?  Who are you?  You weren't followed, were you?  Speak!

==Completion==
I see you're familiar with my old organization.  You must be with [[Cenarion Hold]].  

You seek information to use against them?  Come closer, perhaps we can be of mutual assistance.

==Notes==
*[[Hermit Ortell]] is in a cave south of [[Southwind Village]] at coordinates 67,69.
