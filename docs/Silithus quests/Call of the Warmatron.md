==Objectives==
Report to [[Okrilla]] at [[Dreadmaul Hold]] in [[Blasted Lands]].

==Description==
Our venerable warmatron, Okrilla, has sent me to the far reaches of [[Azeroth|the world]] in search of suitable heroes that would join our cause. Are you interested in strengthening the [[Horde]]'s grasp over the [[Eastern Kingdoms]]? Then take this portal to the Blasted Lands and report to Okrilla at Dreadmaul Hold!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,970 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
[[Silithus]], such a worthless piece of land. It is a wonder that the great [[Cataclysm (event)|cataclysm]] did not sunder it fully!

==Progression==
