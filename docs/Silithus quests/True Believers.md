==Objectives==
[[Hermit Ortell]] wants you to bring him 10 Encrypted Twilight Texts.
* [[Encrypted Twilight Text]] (10)

==Description==
Now that I have the Twilight Lexicon in my possession, there is a small favor I'd like to ask of you.

My former organization has a secret encoded bulletin they circulate on a monthly basis.

If they make any progress searching for me or if they call off the search, word will be published on the [[True Believer]].

Although this information is obviously valuable to me, the publication contains other useful information that I can share. Bring me any encoded texts you find on Twilight's Hammer members.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||90}}
* 6,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find any encrypted texts?  I'm quite curious to read this month's True Believer.

==Completion==
Excellent!  I will get to decoding these as soon as possible.  If I find anything of interest I'll find some way to get the information to you.

==Notes==
{{book|content=Esteemed <name>,

I went through the stack of texts you brought me and I decoded the attached articles for you.  I carefully selected only those items which I thought would be of use.  It was quite problematic to get to a mailbox without being seen, but months of hiding in the desert have turned me into quite a sneak!

I hope you enjoy these.

*After you turn in the texts, he will mail a bag to you in about 4–8 hours. Inside the bag will usually be some decoded Twilight Texts, a scroll (agility, stamina, etc.), or possibly a scroll to create one of the Beckoning devices. Sometimes he will send a rare crafting recipe.
