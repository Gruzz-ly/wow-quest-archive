==Objectives==
Question Frankal and Rutgar at [[Bronzebeard Encampment|Bronzebeard's Encampment]] about the whereabouts of [[Natalia Mar'alith]]. 
* [[Frankal Stonebridge|Frankal]] Questioned
* [[Rutgar Glyphshaper|Rutgar]] Questioned
* [[Mar'alith's Speaking Shard]] (provided)

==Description==
My dear Natalia has gone missing.

Truth be told, she had been acting strangely for weeks leading up to her disappearance. I had caught her talking to herself when no one was around on more than one occasion. She was adamant that everything was ok and that she must be allowed to continue her research.

She was last seen heading to [[Brann Bronzebeard|Bronzebeard's]] camp to the south.

My soldiers are spread too thin, <name>. I need you to go to Bronzebeard's camp and question those dwarves.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 8450 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
Waste no time, <name>!

==Completion==
{{questportrait|Commander Mar'alith.jpg|Commander Mar'alith|This is dire news...}}
<Commander Mar'alith's voice rings out from the shard.>

Whether she is alive or dead, I must do what is right.  She must be found.  Alas, I am bound by duty to this outpost.  Will you help me once more, <name>?

==Notes==
''Accept:''

;Rutgar Glyphshaper
:Bronzebeard's gone missing again! That dwarf sure didn't get any of his brother's good senses.

{{gossip|Hello, Rutgar. The Commander has sent me here to gather some information about his missing wife.}}

:You best have a seat then, this is gonna be a long one.

:When we initially arrived in Silithus, Mistress Mar'alith was the first of the night elves from [[Cenarion Hold]] to join the expedition. Our routine was nothing out of the ordinary: Form a party to venture into the various hives and search for lost artifacts.

{{gossip|That sounds dangerous.}}

:It sure is! Those hives were abuzz with various [[silithid]] that were none to happy to see us.

:Everything was going fine until we came across a glyphed crystal in [[Hive'Regal]]. She was drawn to it like a moth to a flame! She put her pretty little cheek up against the crystal and instantly entered a trance like state. Naturally, this worried my crew. We picked her up and carried her out of there with a quickness!

{{gossip|What happened to her after that?}}

:We took her to the Commander with hopes that the druids of the Circle could fix her up. Sure enough, they were able to wake her up. We figured our business with the Circle was done and we could get back to work.

:A few weeks passed and everything was going fine. [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]] was still around back then so we had a bit of order in our work structure. Then one day, out of the blue, she appeared back at our camp.

{{gossip|Natalia?}}

:Are you daft? Who else would I be talking about? Yes, the girl - Mistress Mar'alith. Anyhow, she was back and not in too good of a mood. That's when the demands started flowing.

{{gossip|What demands?}}

:She demanded that we immediately head back to Hive'Regal! Brann would have none of that sass. He told her that there's no way we would go back into those hives without an army backing us up. It had gotten far too dangerous. The number of those stinking insects seemed to have tripled from when we first ventured into 'em.

:That's when Natalia lost it!

{{gossip|Lost it? What do you mean?}}

:What do you mean what do I mean? She went nutso! The girl went straight crazy on us. Now ordinarily I don't hit girls but after I recovered from the blackout, I was pretty damned angry. Brann, Rutgar, me and [[Glibb|the monkey]] went positively [[orc]] on her! It's a miracle we were able to fend her off. She seemed almost possessed!

{{gossip|Possessed by what?}}

:Who knows? Anyhow, that was the last I saw of her. Maybe Frankal can give you better information.

:Not to steer off topic here as I'm sure the work you're doing for the Commander is important, but we're onto something huge here. HUGE! Our requests to [[Ironforge]] for an army have so far fallen on deaf ears. Apparently we're stretched too thin in protecting the realm or some such nonsense. Once you take your report back to the Commander, come back down here with some friends. We need your help!

{{gossip|I'll be back once I straighten this mess out.}}


;Frankal Stonebridge
:Look up to the heavens, <class>. The [[Dragonflight]]s have not been seen in this area for a thousand years! Those [[Qiraji]] are up to something, I just know it!

{{gossip|Hello, Frankal. I've heard that you might have some information as to the whereabouts of Mistress Natalia Mar'alith.}}

:Oh brother, not this again... Have a seat <mister/missy>.

:I'm sure Rutgar has told you some of this story already so I'll spare you the boring details and get right down to the nitty gritty.

{{gossip|That's what I like to hear.}}

:Right then! So the Mistress had come back for a second go at the hives but Brann was having none of that nonsense! Before the melee began, she started talking to something or someone. Crazier still, she started chanting in a language none of us had ever heard.

{{gossip|That's odd.}}

:You're telling me! It's even stranger considering between Brann, Rutgar, me and the monkey, we know 38 different languages including a touch of [[Titan]] - both [[Vanir]] and [[Aesir]].

:So anyways, whatever she was click clacking about, it definitely wasn't with anyone "present." She then nodded and went on the offensive! Attacked us outright!

{{gossip|You couldn't handle a lone [[night elf]] [[priest]]ess?}}

:Listen <mister/missy>, I'll have you know that whatever attacked us was no priestess of nothin'! Her eyes were aglow with something evil and she was genuinely frothing at the mouth! She came in, did some kind of [[Psychic Scream|crazy scream]] that sent us all runnin' in separate directions and then started [[Mind Flay|flayin' our minds]] one by one. I'd be hearin' [[Shadow Word: Pain|shadowy words]] in my head, watchin' the other's periodically [[Blackout (priest talent)|black out]] here and there. It was madness! We would have been done for if not for the damned monkey.

{{gossip|I've been meaning to ask you about that monkey.}}

:What's there to ask? He's a monkey you crazy fool. Anyhow, so yea, the monkey went into a frenzy after seein' ol' Brann flop into the sand face first. Nothin' the night elf could do was stopping Glibb here from poundin' on her noggin.

{{gossip|Then what?}}

:I'll tell you 'then what.' She went runnin' straight for the hive. And you know what's crazier? Not a single damned bug got in her way or tried to stop her. She ran through them all as if she'd been best friends with 'em for centuries.

{{gossip|What a story! So she went into Hive'Regal and that was the last you saw of her?}}

:Yep.

{{gossip|Thanks for the information, Frankal.}}
