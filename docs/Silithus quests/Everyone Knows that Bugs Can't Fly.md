==Objectives==
Fight a silithid darter until you weaken it, then use your [[:Concussive Shot]] skill to slow it. When it frenzies, use a [[:Tranquilizing Shot]] to knock it unconscious. Tie it up, drag it back to Cenarion Hold, and secure it to the hitching post across from [[Commander Mar'alith]]'s war room for further study.

Return to Commander Mar'alith in Cenarion Hold when finished.

You can learn Tranquilizing Shot from the raid on {{sod|Molten Core}}.
*Capture a [[Silithid Darter]] and Deliver It to [[Cenarion Hold]]

==Description==
From your reports it sounds like the darters are definitely faster, but we need to know more about them. If we can study one, perhaps we can figure out how to neutralize them more effectively.

With your hunting skills, it should be possible to incapacitate one of the darters and bring it back here so that we can learn more about it. Track one down, wound it, rope it, and bring it back here to the cage we've set up for study.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*6600 [[XP]]
*{{cost|3|96}}

==Progress==
Remember, weaken the darter first, then try to knock it out with concussions and tranquilizers.

==Completion==
Sterling work. Your skills have already showed us one way to neutralize them, and we should be able to figure out more about the darters by observing this captive.

==Notes==
Damage a [[Silithid Darter]] until you see {{text|emote|Silithid Darter is badly weakened!}} Use [[Concussive Shot]] on it, and you will see {{text|emote|Silithid Darter flies into a frenzy!}} Use [[Tranquilizing Shot]] and it will fall asleep; interact with it to tie it up, and it will follow you as you run back to [[Cenarion Hold]]. Bring it to the {{sod|Hitching Post}} outside the building where Commander Mar'alith stands.
