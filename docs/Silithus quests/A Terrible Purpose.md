==Objectives==
Take the Decoded Tablet Parchment to [[Commander Mar'alith]].
*[[Decoded Tablet Transcription]] (provided)

==Description==
Ok, here we are... a pretty valuable chunk of information, I must say! I've seen the [[Cenarion Circle]] forces arrive at [[Silithus]]. They plan to drive the [[Twilight's Hammer]] out, don't they? This will help. 

Take this parchment to their leader, Commander Mar'alith. Soon the Twilight's Hammer will be vanquished and I will be outside their grasp for good!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|80}}
*6600 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
What is this you bring to me, <name>?

==Completion==
This is very interesting information indeed, <name>. This sheds some light on the presence of the Twilight's Hammer in Silithus and will undoubtedly help us in our struggle against them. Your efforts will be handsomely rewarded, <class>.

==Notes==
Some time after the turning this quest in, the character will receive mail from Commander Mar'alith, and an item: [[Nature's Whisper]]

{{book||content=
Esteemed <name>,

The information you brought to my attention earlier has turned out to be extremely valuable.  Already I am calling for changes to our battle plans to account for the new importance we attribute to the Twilight's Hammer presence.

Please accept this item as a small token of our gratitude.  I hope we can continue to count on you as a valiant ally in our fight in Silithus.

Sincerely,

Commander Mar'alith}}
