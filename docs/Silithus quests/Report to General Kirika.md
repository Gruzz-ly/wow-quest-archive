==Objectives==
Speak with [[General Kirika]] at the [[Horde]] [[Orgrimmar Legion camp|encampment]] near [[Hive'Regal]]. 

==Description==
You must be one of General Kirika's new recruits. It's about time you showed up. Bodies wear down quick in the desert.

The [[Dwarf|dwarves]] have been getting reinforcements daily, and we can't afford to lose ground in our struggle for resources in [[Silithus]].

Get your instructions from the General. It's not my job to train you, just find you. 

==Completion==
It's good that you're hear, but there's no time to waste making small talk. You need instructions, and then you need to get out there.

Listen up.
