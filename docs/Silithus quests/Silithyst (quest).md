'''Silithyst''' is a PvP world quest, serving as a callback to [[The Silithyst Must Flow]], added in [[Patch 1.12]].

== Objectives ==
;Alliance
*Return 5 [[Silithyst]] to the Alliance collector ({{co|39.0|46.9|Silithus}})

;Horde
*Return 5 [[Silithyst]] to the Horde collector ({{co|54.9|63.5|Silithus}})

== Rewards ==
You will receive: 
*{{Alliance}} 100x [[Alliance Qiraji Commendation]]
*{{Horde}} 100x [[Horde Qiraji Commendation]] 
*18,900 [[XP]]
*500 reputation with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Notes and guide==
Silithyst spawns in an area centered on {{co|47|57|Silithus}} on both sides of the road southwest of the [[Bones of Grakkarond]]. Interacting with a [[Silithyst Geyser]] or [[Silithyst Mound]] will immediately flag the player for PvP. While carrying the dust, players are treated much like they were  a flag carrier in [[Capture the Flag]] modes of PvP: mounting, gaining stealth or invulnerability will cause the player to drop the dust. Additionally, any run speed-enhancing abilities will not work as well.

Run on foot to the collection point. The Alliance turn-in point is to the northwest, at {{co|39.0|46.9|Silithus}} on the edge of [[Hive'Zora]], while the Horde camp is off to the southeast at {{co|54.9|63.5|Silithus}} on the edge of [[Hive'Regal]].
