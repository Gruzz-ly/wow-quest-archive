'''This quest''' takes you to [[Blasted Lands]]. 

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Quartermaster Lungertz]] at [[Nethergarde Keep]] in Blasted Lands. 

==Description==
Nethergarde needs you, <class>! I have been sent here by Quartermaster Lungertz to head off [[Okrilla]]'s nefarious lackeys and to recruit able-bodied heroes of the [[Alliance]]! Help us fight off the [[Horde]]!

If you are willing, take this portal in front of me to the Blasted Lands and speak with the quartermaster.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,960 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
[[Silithus]], not such a great place, eh? We get a lot of you from there... 

==Notes==
The questgiver offers you a portal so you can get to the [[Blasted Lands]] quickly. This quest is an alternative to the [[Hero's Call]] quest to [[Blasted Lands]].

==Progression==
{{Nethergarde Keep quest chain}}
