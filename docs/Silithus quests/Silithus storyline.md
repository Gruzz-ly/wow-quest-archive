# Silithus storyline

[[File:WorldMap-Silithus.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

'''[[Silithus]]''' is a contested level 55-60 zone in southwestern [[Kalimdor]]. Most of the story is revolving around the rising activity of the [[silithid]] and the [[Twilight's Hammer]] in the area, and will lead adventurers that arrive to [[Cenarion Hold]] to deal with these threats.

Unlike most other [[old world]] zones, Silithus was not revamped in ''[[World of Warcraft: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]'' and has relatively few quests, especially compared to the other level 55-60 zone, [[Blasted Lands]]. For this reason, the area provides easy acces to Blasted Lands.

The progression of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Silithus Quests]].
