==Objectives==
Bring the Torn Recipe Page to [[Calandrath]] at the inn in [[Cenarion Hold]].
*[[Torn Recipe Page]] (provided)

==Description==
While the recipe for cooking sandworm meat is legible, it contains references to herbs and spices you've never heard of. Calandrath might have enough knowledge of the plants that grow in the desert to make sense of it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||85|}}
*6000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

You will learn how to cook [[Smoked Desert Dumplings]].

==Progress==
Did you learn the recipe?  You won't keep it to yourself, I hope!

==Completion==
Let's have a look at that...

This seems simple enough.  They have their own names for some of the herbs, but those are simple enough to figure out.  Here, let me show you!
