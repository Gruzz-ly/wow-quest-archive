==Objectives==
Bring Deathclasp's Pincer to [[Vish Kozus]], Captain of the Guard.
*[[Deathclasp's Pincer]]

==Description==
The terrible [[scorpid]], [[Deathclasp]], is believed to have retreated to the southern mountain range in the presence of increased [[silithid]] activity. She presents a great threat to patrols and expeditions in the southern regions. Individuals participating in her destruction will be remunerated handsomely. Inquire with Captain Vish Kozus, at the top of the [[Cenarion Hold]] Watchtower, regarding a reward.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Sandstrider's Mark|Black Crystal Dagger}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|80}}
*11,600 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
I'll need the creature's pincer as proof of the deed.  No pincer, no reward.

==Completion==
Excellent!  With Deathclasp gone we're free to use the southern mountain range as a strategic path to circumvent the silithid hives.  Your work is greatly appreciated.
