==Objectives==
[[Hermit Ortell]] wants you to bring him 10 Encrypted Twilight Texts.
*[[Encrypted Twilight Text]] (10)

==Progress==
Find any more encrypted texts?  Bring me a good batch of them, this decoding work takes some time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||90}}
*6,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Excellent!  I can't wait to read these.  Please do keep bringing the encrypted texts here if you find them.

==Notes==
{{book||content=Greetings <name>!

I'm getting pretty good at sneaking into [[Cenarion Hold]] to use their mailbox.  Again, I've attached some items that might be of interest.  Hope something in there is of use to you!

*This is a repeatable quest which is a copy of [[True Believers]].
*After you turn in the texts, he will mail a bag to you in about 4–8 hours. Inside the bag will usually be some [[decoded Twilight Text]]s, a scroll (agility, stamina, etc.), or possibly a scroll to create one of the twelve Beckoning devices ([[Scroll: Create Crest of Beckoning|crests]], [[Scroll: Create Scepter of Beckoning|scepters]], or [[Scroll: Create Signet of Beckoning|signets]]). Sometimes he will send a rare crafting pattern.
