==Objectives==
Take Brann Bronzebeard's Letter to [[Bronzebeard Encampment|Bronzebeard's Encampment]] in southern [[Silithus]].
*[[Brann Bronzebeard's Lost Letter]] (provided)

==Description==
To Whom It May Concern:

If you're reading this, I'm either dead or soon to be dead. It's hard to say. Most of the crew is dead anyhow.

Found information about a [[Titan]]. Great battle between him and an [[C'Thun|Old God]]. Yes, a bona fide Old God. Found ancient tunnel leading to [[Ahn'Qiraj]]. Taking it.

Take this letter to my old camp. Make sure [[Glibb|my monkey]] is getting adequate food, water, and hugs.

-[[Brann Bronzebeard]], Explorer Extreme

P.S. Watch out for [[Natalia Mar'alith|crazy Old God worshipping night elf]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Brann's Trusty Pick]]
*11,900 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
Oh dear.

==Completion==
Well this explains a lot. If you ever find a way into Ahn'Qiraj, keep an eye out for ol' Brann. I'm afraid that he'll be powerless without his monkey.
