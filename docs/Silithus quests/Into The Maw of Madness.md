{{questportrait|Commander Mar'alith.jpg|Commander Mar'alith|This is far worse than I could have imagined...}}
[[Commander Mar'alith]] at [[Cenarion Hold]] in [[Silithus]] wants you to find his beloved [[Mistress Natalia Mar'alith|Natalia]]. The information that you gathered points to [[Hive'Regal]] in the south as being the area in which you may find Mistress Natalia Mar'alith.

Do not forget to visit the dwarves at Bronzebeard's camp before venturing into the hive. They might have some additional work and advice for you.

And <name>, remember the Commander's words: "Do what you must..."
*The Fate of Mistress Natalia Mar'alith

==Description==
I need you to venture into [[Hive'Regal]] and find what became of my dearest Natalia, <name>. This will be no easy task for you. Before you dive headlong into the maw of madness, make sure that you go back and speak with those dwarves. They might be able to give you some tips on dealing with the [[silithid]] that inhabit that hive.

And <name>, if she truly is as mad as they say... do what you must.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|70}}
*10,550 [[XP]]
*+700 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]
*[[Corrupted Blackwood Staff]]

==Progress==
Natalia?

==Completion==
<Commander Mar'alith clutches at his chest.>

[[C'Thun]]? WHAT is the meaning of all this? What is C'Thun? How could this fiend have turned my sweet Natalia into the monster that you described?

==Progression==
This quest was formerly part of the now deprecated [[Emissary Roman'khan]] quest chain.
