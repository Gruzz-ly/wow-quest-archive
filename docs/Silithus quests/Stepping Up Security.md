==Objectives==
[[Windcaller Proudhorn]] at [[Cenarion Hold]] in [[Silithus]] wants you to slay 20 Dredge Crushers.
*[[Dredge Crusher]] (20)

==Description==
Your performance has been truly exemplary so far, <name>. Our supply lines are not completely safe yet, however. In the absence of dredge strikers, their larger southern cousins will surely move in to take their place in the north.

You'll have to kill quite a few dredge crushers to keep them at bay, but we cannot leave the safety of our supply lines to chance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|70|}}
*8750 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
The dredge crushers are a serious threat and must be dealt with at once!

==Completion==
Excellent!  You've proven to be a valuable ally in preparing for the war against the [[silithid]].

==Progression==
* [[Hero's Call: Silithus!]]/[[Warchief's Command: Silithus!]] or [[The Dunes of Silithus]]/[[The Sands of Silithus]] (breadcrumb quests)
