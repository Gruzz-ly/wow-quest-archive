==Objectives==
Use the Geologist's Transcription Kit to make a Hive'Regal Rubbing from the [[Hive'Regal Glyphed Crystal]].
* [[Hive'Regal Rubbing]]
* [[Geologist's Transcription Kit]] (provided)

==Description==
After our initial foray into the hives and [[Natalia Mar'alith|Mistress Mar'alith]]'s subsequent madness the three hives have been spewing out bugs! The increased activity might be tied into the glyphs covering those strange crystals.

If I can get rubbings of those crystals and the glyphs on them, we might be able to make sense of this madness.

Take this transcription set and hit [[Hive'Regal]] to the east, <name>. That's the last rubbing I need!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||85|}}
*8400 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
If you find some crazy night elf lass in there, be sure to give her a kick in the duff.

==Completion==
I can't make heads or tails of these glyphs. I've never seen anything like it! I hope [[Frankal Stonebridge|Frankal]]'s research can shed some light on this mess.
