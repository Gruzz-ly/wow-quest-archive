==Objectives==
Find and defeat four [[silithid]] darters. These are fast-moving, small [[silithid wasp]]s with a blue exoskeleton.
*Kill [[Silithid Darter]]s (4)

==Description==
The silithids are constantly changing, and successive generations take on new traits to improve their survival fitness. We've spotted a new kind of silithid flyer north of here, near [[Hive'Ashi]]. They're flyers, like some of the other silithid wasps, but smaller, faster, and have a blue exoskeleton.

I want to know what to expect from these darters. Take out a few and report back on how tough they are.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*6600 [[XP]]
*{{cost|3|96}}

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Now we know that they can be killed. Not as tough as the other silithids, you say? Perhaps some kind of new scout form. Useful information, thank you.

==Progression==
