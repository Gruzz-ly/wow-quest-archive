==Objectives==
Summoned Templar slain (4)

== Notes ==
There are four types of templars: [[Crimson Templar|Crimson]], [[Earthen Templar|Earthen]], [[Hoary Templar|Hoary]], and [[Azure Templar]]s. In order to summon them, players must have acquired at least one each of a [[Twilight Cultist Cowl (Call of the Scarab)]], [[Twilight Cultist Mantle (Call of the Scarab)]] and [[Twilight Cultist Robe (Call of the Scarab)]], and use them to gain a 24-hour buff. Once all three buffs are active, right-click on a [[Lesser Wind Stone]] at [[Twilight Base Camp]], [[Twilight Outpost]], or [[Twilight Post]],  and choose the gossip option to summon a templar. One of the three buffs will be lost upon summoning; however, that is a major improvement from the original version of this event, where the three items were ''equipped'' in place of armor and lost at the fight.

The templars can be soloed but seem to be tuned more for a small group of 2-3+ players.
