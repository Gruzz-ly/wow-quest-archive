==Objectives==
[[Beetix Ficklespragg]] at [[Cenarion Hold]] in [[Silithus]] wants you to gather 3 Stonelash Pincer Stingers, 3 Stonelash Flayer Stingers and 3 Rock Stalker Fangs.
* [[Stonelash Flayer Stinger]] (3)
* [[Stonelash Pincer Stinger]] (3)
* [[Rock Stalker Fang]] (3)

==Description==
Blasted! The antidote didn't work. [[Noggle Ficklespragg|Noggle]] must've been stung by one of the stronger creatures in the far south.

I'm going to need you to go there and get me some more samples, <name>. The good news is that since their poison is stronger I won't require as many. The bad news is that there are more kinds of poisonous creatures crawling around the southern area so you'll have to draw from more sources.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|q1=2|Major Healing Potion
|Major Mana Potion
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||65|}}
*8750 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
This is our last chance to save Noggle!  Hurry!

==Completion==
Yes!  It seems to be working, Noggle is coming to.  We owe ya big time!
