'''Vyral the Vile''' is the second quest in the '''Twilight Geolords''' quest chain.

== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Vyral the Vile.jpg|Vyral the Vile|Foul leader of the cultists lurking in Twilight's Run.}}
Slay [[Vyral the Vile]] and obtain Vyral's Signet Ring.
*[[Vyral's Signet Ring]]

== Description ==
We have discovered another base of operations for the [[Twilight's Hammer]]. It is called [[Twilight's Run]]; it is a cave tucked in the northeast corner of [[Silithus]]. The local leader of the cult, Vyral the Vile, haunts that cave - it is he who you must next defeat.  When you have done this, bring me his signet ring.

Fortune to you, <name>. The horrors of Twilight's Run are formidable indeed.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Desert Wind Gauntlets|Sunprism Pendant}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|s=90}}
*9550 [[XP]] (or {{cost||57}} at level 70)
* +700 with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
<Name>, have you yet defeated Vyral the Vile? Do you have his signet ring?

==Completion==
You've done it! Vyral is killed! This can only mean doom for the Twilight Hammer's operations in Silithus. There may be more of them scurrying about, but the blow you dealt to the cult today is one from which they will not easily recover.
