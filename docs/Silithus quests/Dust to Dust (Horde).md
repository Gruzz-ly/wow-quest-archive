==Objectives==
Find and deliver 5 Silithyst to the Silithyst Extractor then speak with [[Apothecary Quinard]] at the [[Horde]] encampment near [[Hive'Regal]].
*[[Silithyst]] delivered (5)

==Description==
<Name>, lend me your ear. The Captain's wounds grow ever more grievous. The camp celebrates each victory with their usual jubilance, but I cannot join in their cheers. Not when I've seen the wounds he hides beneath his armor.

An Infection? No no, I would say it's much closer to... an infestation. I'm preparing a concoction, but there's one key ingredient I still need--Silithyst.

I need it, and quickly. Based on my inspection of the Captain's condition, I fear he won't last much longer without it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+100 [[reputation]] with the [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
Careful <name>. From what I've gleaned in our scouting reports, the [[Alliance]] are beginning to understand the value of the sand.

With this, I advise you to steel yourself. There are now two types of worms out there roaming the desert.

==Completion==
Excellent. You've gathered it all, and not a moment too soon. I will prepare the concoction for [[Krug Skullsplit|Captain Krug]] immediately.

I can't reward your bravery with coin, but I can bestow you with some of my knowledge. I would part with the notes I've used to treat the soldiers and fill their bellies, for a price of course.
