'''The Peak of Serenity - Begin Your Training''' is the first of a long line of {{class|monk}}-specific quests that take place at the [[Peak of Serenity]], a monastery that serves as a training ground and refuge for the monk class. This initial quest is intended to familiarize the player with the use of the [[Zen Pilgrimage]] skill, which allows the monk to quickly transport him or herself to the Peak of Serenity for easy access to class trainers and future class quests. This quest and the skill required to complete it are automatically added to the player's quest log and spell book at level 20.
