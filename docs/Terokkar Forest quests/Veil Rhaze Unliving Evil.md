==Objectives==
Kill 4 Deathtalon Spirits, 4 Screeching Spirits and 2 Spirit Ravens and return to Kirrik at the [[Refugee Caravan]].
*4 [[Deathtalon Spirit]]s slain.
*4 [[Screeching Spirit]]s slain.
*2 [[Spirit Raven]]s slain.

==Description==
[[Veil Rhaze]] was a particularly wicked colony of [[Skettis]].

Despite the village's eradication by the [[Auchindoun]] disaster, [[Terokk]]'s influence remained in the maligned spirits there. Travel west to Veil Rhaze and slay those murderous wretches. You'll find them to the west of the Shadow Tomb, on the border of Bone Wastes and Terokkar Forest.

This will be our first blow against Terokk and the guardians of Skettis.

==Reward==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox|Rewards
|Talonbranch Wand
|Feather-Wrapped Bow}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|10|}}
*10750[[XP]] (or {{cost|5|16|}} at level 70)
*250  [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Those foul spirits deserved to die. The death they would have wrought on others is reason enough.

We cannot hope to redeem those in Terokk's grasp. But we shall deliver them a devastating blow in the name of the Light.
