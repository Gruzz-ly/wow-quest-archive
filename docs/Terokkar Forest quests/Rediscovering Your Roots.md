'''Rediscovering your Roots''' is part of the [[Shattered Sun Offensive]] storyline. Once players have activated [[Mar'nah]], this quest replaces [[Discovering Your Roots]].

==Objectives==
[[Mar'nah]] at [[Sun's Reach Harbor]] wants you to travel to [[Razorthorn Rise]] in [[Outland]], collect 5 Razorthorn Roots, and return to her.
*[[Razorthorn Root]] (5)

==Description==
My stocks are presently sufficient, but I'll need plenty of razorthorn roots to keep up with the demand.

Collecting the roots is difficult, but I know a special method of extraction.

Using the glands of the Razorthorn flayers, one can control a ravager there and use it to expose a root.

To find the roots, travel to [[Outland]] and fly northeast from [[Shattrath]] until you reach [[Razorthorn Rise]].

Return to me, <name>, once you have collected five of the roots.

==Rewards==
You will receive: [[Shattered Sun Supplies]] and {{cost|4|40}}

==Progress==
Really, <name>, I'm far too busy for idle chatter.

Let me know when you've gathered those roots.

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>.

Thank you again for your help!

==Notes==
Kill [[Razorthorn Flayer]]s on [[Razorthorn Rise]] until a [[Razorthorn Flayer Gland]] drops. Use the Gland on any [[Razorthorn Ravager]] on the Rise. Pet classes will have their permanent pet, if out, temporarily replaced as long as the Ravager is being used.

Now that players have a new (temporary, but not time-limited) permanent pet, the pet action bar has a unique action. "Expose Razorthorn Root" (ctrl-7) will send the Ravager to a nearby [[Razorthorn Dirt Mound]]. Once the Ravager digs up the mound, right-click on the [[Razorthorn Root]] [[object]] that's now visible. Collect 5, then fly back to Shattrath and port back to the Isle to turn in.
