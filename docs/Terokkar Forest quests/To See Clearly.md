==Objectives==
Visit [[Exarch Hataaru]]'s tomb and then return to Ataanya in Shattrath.
*Use the [[Auchenai Translocator]] (Optional)
*Request spoken to [[Hataaru's Ashes]]
*[[Exarch Hataaru's Artificing Lens]]
*Lens taken to [[Ataanya]] in [[Shattrath]]

==Description==
Fortunately, not all of the fallen entombed here in [[Auchindoun]] suffer as these three do. Some ease gracefully into death, like soil settling after a rainfall.

Exarch Hataaru is one such soul. Thanks be to the [[Light]] that he rests easy.

Come, I will show you to his tomb.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*6,800 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

==Progress==
<Ataanya crosses her arms tightly, not looking at you or [[Apprentice Beruun|Beruun]].>

==Completion==
... Fine.

<For a moment, she looks like she might snatch the lens from you. Instead, she takes it from you gently.>

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|Thank you for your help, <name>. The tomb of Exarch Hataaru is just across the way. Follow me!}}

Follow Exarch Maladaar to the tomb of Exarch Hataaru. You can fly there or take [[Auchenai Translocator]].
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|Exarch Hataaru has accepted his life, his death, his triumphs and his mistakes. Approach him and make your request.}}

Interact with [[Hataaru's Ashes]]:
{{Dialogue|<The urn is covered in a fine layer of dust. It appears to have been undisturbed for many years.>

{{Gossip|quest=|I think your daughter Ataanya still grieves for you.}}}}
:''The soul of Exarch Hataaru appears and walks to the side.''
:{{Text|emote|Exarch Hataaru silently points to the lockbox.}}

Pick up Exarch Hataaru's Artificing Lens from the [[Artificer's Lockbox]]. [[Grand Artificer's Staff]] is also near the box but is not part of the quest.
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|I sense that Exarch Hataaru's only regret is leaving his daughter behind.}}
:{{Text|emote|Exarch Hataaru bows to you, then smiles.}}
:''As a soul, Hataaru goes back to his urn.''
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|Taking the exarch's gift back to his daughter may bring them both peace.}}

Travel back to Shattrath and approach Ataanya:
:{{Text|say|High Artificer Ataanya|Oh, for Light's sake. Why are you back?}}
Talk to Ataanya:
{{Dialogue|
<Ataanya glares at you tiredly.>

If you say one more thing about the [[Tishamaat]], you'll wake up at the bottom of the [[Aldor Rise]] with my hoofprint on your back!

{{Gossip|quest=|<Offer the artificing lens to her.> I spoke to your father. He wanted you to have this.}}}}
:{{Text|say|High Artificer Ataanya|What is wrong with you?}}
:{{Text|say|High Artificer Ataanya|I tell you to leave, and instead you rob my father's grave?}}
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Beruun|Ataanya, I sent them to Auchindoun. Exarch Hataaru wouldn't want this for you.}}
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Beruun|He would want you to be around your people and to show them all you've made! Not to stay locked away here.}}
:{{Text|say|High Artificer Ataanya|What? I... Ugh!}}
