==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Warp Stalker]]s and return to Kurgatok at [[Stonebreaker Hold]].
*[[Warp Stalker]] slain (10)

==Description==
There's nothing more annoying than preparing to cast a spell, only to have it interrupted by some unseen force. After the fourth time, I knew it couldn't be coincidence and I sent [[Keb'ezil]] out to investigate.

I guarantee you'll never encounter an imp that talks back more than Keb.

Anyway, he managed to find the source of the problem, a pesky creature known as a warp stalker. They have a habit of disturbing the magical energy wherever they blink into existence. I've had enough of their interference.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3|10}}

==Progress==
Keb'ezil wants to know if it's safe to hurl a fireball without embarrassing himself again.

<The imp makes a few clicking sounds and the warlock turns toward him.>

No, it wasn't my shadow bolt! Take it back, you overgrown pixy!

==Completion==
Keb'ezil is relieved that you've taken care of that little problem, aren't you, Keb?

<The imp ignores its master, presumably out of indignation.>

You'll have to forgive his bad manners. You know how demons can be...
