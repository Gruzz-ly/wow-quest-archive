==Objectives==
[[Mekeda]] at the Refugee Caravan in Terokkar Forest wants you to kill 8 Cabal Skirmishers, 4 Cabal Spell-Weavers and 2 Cabal Initiates.
*[[Cabal Skirmisher]] slain (8)
*[[Cabal Spell-weaver]] slain (4)
*[[Cabal Initiate]] slain (2)

==Description==
After our caravan fell prey to an attack by [[Shadow Council]] cabal cultists, scouts were sent to Shattrath to call for help. The guards think we're safe for now, but they underestimate these madmen.

I, for one, am not looking forward to having my throat slit by some cabal initiate in the middle of the night. Do us all a favor and take the fight to them, before they come to us.

You will find our attackers south of here, at [[Auchindoun]]'s northern entrance.

==Rewards==
You will be rewarded with:
*8300 - 10400 [[XP]]
*{{cost|g=3|s=75}}
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]

==Progress==
Have you done what I asked of you, <name>? I fear for our lives.

==Completion==
I can breath a sigh of relief for now, <name>. The [[Shadow Council]] will be held off for the time being.

They are murderers and cowards and your display of courage will keep them at bay.
