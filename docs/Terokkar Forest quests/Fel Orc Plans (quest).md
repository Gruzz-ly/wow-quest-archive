== Objectives ==
Bring the Fel [[Orc]] Plans to [[Bertelm]] at the [[Allerian Stronghold]]. 
*[[Fel Orc Plans]] (Provided)
==  Description ==
The writing on the plans is far too delicate and precise to have come from any of the fel orcs. You can't make out what the text says, but the implications are pretty clear: the fel orcs are taking orders from the blood elves at Firewing Point.

Why would the two forces be working together? [[Bertelm]] might have some insight into this odd alliance. You decide to make your way back to the [[Allerian Stronghold]] and show him the map. 
==  Reward ==
You will receive:{{cost|3|10|}}
==  Progress ==
What is it you have there, &lt;name&gt;? 
==  Completion ==
&lt;Bertelm takes the plans from you and looks them over.&gt;

If you hadn't brought this map, I'd say you were out of your mind, but here it is, plain as day. Not only are the fel orcs here to serve the blood elves, but it appears, they've been ordered to keep us occupied.

This map raises more questions than it answers, but it gives us a better idea of what we're facing here. 
==  Gains ==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*10750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|16|}} at level 70)
