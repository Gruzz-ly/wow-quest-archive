This quest is part of [[The Terokkar Mana Bomb quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Earthbinder Tavgren]] just outside the [[Cenarion Thicket]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].

==Description==
<Name>, I think that after you're done celebrating here, you should go back to the Cenarion Thicket and speak with Earthbinder Tavgren.

I'm certain that he'll want to know what really happened out there.

==Rewards==
*{{cost|8|70}}
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Cenarion Thicket Circlet 	
|Cenarion Thicket Helm
|Cenarion Thicket Jerkin 	
|Cenarion Thicket Legplates
}}

==Completion==
A bomb utilizing pure mana that can take out whole towns!  But why?  Why would the blood elves create such a thing and use it on us?  The Cenarion Thicket was a place of peace and repose.

Whatever the reason, it must be locked inside the head of [[Warden Treelos]], and I have no idea how to cure him.  Perhaps his mind will heal in time?

Regardless, I want to thank you for helping me to figure out what happened.  I can only hope that this tragedy will never befall anyone else ever again!
