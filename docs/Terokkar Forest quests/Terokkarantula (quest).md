==Objectives==
[[Vindicator Haylen]] wants you to kill the [[Terokkarantula]] and then return to him west of [[Netherweb Ridge]].
*[[Terokkarantula]] slain

==Description==
You have slain many of the dreadfang widows but they will continue to spawn and soon they will strike at us again. Deep within Netherweb Ridge is the lair of the Terokkarantula, the brood-mother of these gruesome creatures. If we are to be safe, she must die. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Blade of Retribution
|Blessed Signet Ring
|Noble Plate Pauldrons
|Book of Many Blessings
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|6|60}}
*11,000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Sha'tar]]

==Progress==
Has Terokkarantula been slain?

==Completion==
The dreadfangs are beaten.  You have killed many and even their foul mother has fallen before you.  I am too poisoned to fight my way to freedom.

Please, take some of my equipment.  It will lighten my load and give you the tools you need to make the journey back to [[Sha'tari Base Camp]].

==Notes==
[[Terokkarantula]] is a level 65 elite spider who spawns around 53,81 (east of the quest giver, in Netherweb Ridge). The quest suggests doing this quest as a group of 3 players but it may be possible to solo it at higher levels.  A group of 2 players at level 67 or higher can take it out with only moderate difficulty.

==Progression==
* [[For the Fallen]]
* [[Terokkarantula (quest)]]
* [[Return to Sha'tari Base Camp]]

==Patch changes==
