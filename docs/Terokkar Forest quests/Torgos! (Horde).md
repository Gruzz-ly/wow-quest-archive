==Objectives==
Call down [[Torgos]] with Trachela's Carcass. Acquire a Tail Feather of Torgos and return it to [[Mawg Grimshot]] at [[Stonebreaker Hold]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].
*[[Tail Feather of Torgos]]

==Description==
I want Torgos, king of the bonelashers, dead!

Not long ago, while I was out hunting at Veil Rhaze on the western edge of the wastes, he fell upon me.

<Mawg taps his eyepatch.>

He took my eye, and now I would have his life! Bring me one of his tail feathers as proof and I'll give you a worthy reward.

You'll need his mate Trachela's carcass though to call him down as he's deathly afraid of the old arakkoan scarecrow known as Torgos's Bane.

Find her at Carrion Hill in the northern wastes.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Terokkar Tablet of Vim|Terokkar Tablet of Precision}}
You will also receive: {{cost|6|60|}}

==Progress==
Did you kill him?  Is Torgos dead?!

You have proof?

==Completion==
I thank you, <name>!  You have exacted my revenge, and as promised you will be rewarded!

Take your pick of one of these and use it well!

==Notes==
After collecting [[Trachela]]'s carcass, you have to go west to Veil Rhaze.  There you will find Torgos's Bane (the scarecrow has a blue glow at the base), just on the border of the [[Bone Wastes]] with some hills to the north.  Place the carcass at the foot of the scarecrow to call Torgos.
