==Description==
I believe we may be able to help.

But perhaps you could aid me first...

When we received word that the [[Tishamaat]] was upon us, we hurried to prepare our most tortured spirits for the journey to the [[Exodar]]. The celebration's sacraments may help them rest peacefully.

However, they must consent to being moved. So, we must commune with and soothe them first.

Will you help calm these spirits? Afterward, I will take you to where [[Hataaru]] is entombed and give you what you seek.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*6,800 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

==Progress==
Your kindness may help these spirits find peace in death.

==Completion==
Thank you for what you have done, <name>.

Moving a spirit's remains can disturb them greatly, so they must be calmed as much as possible so the journey can be made safely.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|Meet me in the upper reaches. We will commune with the spirits there to prepare them for the journey.}}
:''Maladaar transforms into a soul and heads southward.''

Follow Exarch Maladaar to the tomb of [[Exarch Larohir]]. You can fly there or take [[Auchenai Translocator]].
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|This is the tomb of Exarch Larohir, the Prophet's general. We will commune with him first.}}

Maladaar has new gossip. If the character has killed him in [[Auchenai Crypts]], he says:
{{Dialogue|Although it was many years ago, I remember what you did for me, <name>.

I was lost, angry--no, I was furious.

I could not see a path forward from what had happened to us. I clung to the past so hard it suffocated me.

You brought me rest. I can never repay that debt. Thank you, <name>.}}

If the player hasn't killed him in Auchenai Crypts:
{{Dialogue|These spirits must be calmed before being taken to the Tishamaat.

It is a difficult process. Thank you for helping them through it.

{{Gossip|Why do only these souls need to be taken to the Tishamaat?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
On [[Argus]], it was common to perform the sacrament of Tishamaat on behalf of a departed soul to help them move on.

These three souls are volatile. While they show promise, we are having trouble fully separating them from their attachments.

With the revival of the Tishamaat, we hope this will be the key to helping them.

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}}}}}

Stand in the targeted area and use the extra action button Commune to summon the soul of Larohir which allows seeing the souls of [[Shattrath Victim]]s in battle against memories of orc invaders. 
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|He defended [[Shattrath]] until his dying breath. Spirits seek his protection still. Alas, we must return them to rest.}}

Interact with the souls to put them to rest back to their [[Shattrath Ashes|urns]].
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|He gives his consent. Seal the urn with the mark of [[D'ore]].}}

Interact with [[Larohir's Ashes]].
:''Sealing the urn causes the soul of Larohir to show up briefly and salute the adventurer.''
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|May the Tishamaat relieve Larohir of the guilt he feels at not saving all of Shattrath.}}

Go to the tomb of [[Exarch Kelios]] next, either by flight or using the translocator.
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|Let us commune now with Exarch Kelios, the first [[vindicator]] and bastion of [[Black Temple|Karabor]].}}

Stand in the circle and Commune with the soul.
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|He fought the darkness there, but it followed him in death. Light his tomb so that he may see once more.}}

Light all the [[Karabor Prayer Candle]]s around his tomb.
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|Take care! The smaller the flame, the more swiftly it burns out.}}
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|Kelios has agreed to the Tishamaat. Seal his urn.}}

Interact with [[Kelios's Ashes]].
:''Sealing the urn causes the soul of Kelios to briefly show up and salute the adventurer.''
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|May Kelios no longer fear the darkness and the light ease his pain.}}

Go to the tomb of [[Restalaan]] for the last soul.
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|Ah, Restalaan. Larohir's mentor! His is a bloody story of betrayal. Let us commune with him now!}}

Commune with the soul which causes two [[Memory of Death (Terokkar Forest)|Memories of Death]], representing [[Durotan]] and his wolf [[Nightstalker (wolf)|Nightstalker]], to show up and attack the adventurer.
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|He unwittingly gave the [[orc]]s the weapon that destroyed him--and [[Telmor]]. We must dispel the shades of his guilt.}}

Defeat the memories to dispel them.
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|It is a miracle that his soul survived those ravages. He consents. Please, seal his urn.}}

Interact with [[Restalaan's Ashes]].
:''As the urn is sealed, Restalaan's soul briefly appears and salutes the adventurer.''
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|It may take many Tishamaats before Restalaan can fully rest, but I will help him no matter what.}}
