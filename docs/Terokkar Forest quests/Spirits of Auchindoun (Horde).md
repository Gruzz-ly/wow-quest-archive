==Objectives==
Help the [[Horde]] secure a tower in the [[Bone Wastes]].
*Secure a Spirit Tower

==Description==
The [[draenei]] might be our enemies, but the spirits of their ancestors in [[Auchindoun]] are restless and have no allegiance.

The draenei's custom required them to pay their respects at spirit towers at various times during the day. If you can help secure a tower during these times, you will help the spirits return to peace in Auchindoun.

The [[Alliance]] will try to capture the towers in order to secure the dead's favor. We must ensure that our side succeeds instead.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*11000 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|11|99}} at level 70)
*209 [[honor]]

==Progress==
The spirits of Auchindoun are all around us.  Will they grant us their boon?

==Completion==
The spirits are closer to finding peace and have bestowed their favor onto us.

A humiliating blow to our enemy that their own ancestors would side against them, even if only temporarily.

==Patch changes==
