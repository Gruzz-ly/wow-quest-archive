==Objectives==
Kill Ashkaz in Veil Reskk, Ayit in Veil Shienor, and Urdak in Veil Skith and return to Rokag at Stonebreaker Hold.
*[[Ashkaz]] slain
*[[Ayit]] slain
*[[Urdak]] slain

==Description==
We need to show the arakkoa that they cannot attack our people with impunity. If we don't stop them here, the roads will no longer be safe for our merchants, couriers, or soldiers.

My scouts have identified the leaders of each of the major arakkoa settlements in the area. Seek out Ashkaz, Ayit, and Urdak, in Veil Reskk, Veil Shienor, and Veil Skith and kill them.

==Rewards==

*10750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|g=5|s=16}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Welcome back, <name>. Have you dealt with the arakkoa leaders?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. We have enough to worry about without wondering when the arakkoa will accost our merchants and messengers again.
