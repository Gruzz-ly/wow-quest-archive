==Objectives==
Bring a Baby Crocolisk to {{NPC||Old Man Barlo}}. You can find him fishing northeast of [[Shattrath City]] by [[Silmyr Lake]].
*[[Baby Crocolisk]]

==Description==
Hello <lad/lass>. I'm glad you've stopped by to talk to this old man — there's trouble back home.

A traveling merchant recently sold a batch of baby crocolisks to some gullible children. [[Crocolisk]]s are wild beasts, and many have escaped and now lurk in city waterways.

Grab your strongest fishing pole and drop a line in [[Stormwind]] or [[Orgrimmar]] and bring one of the little devils back to me. I'm anxious to see one.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Bag of Fishing Treasures (Terokkar Forest)]]

==Progress==
Catch any crocs in the sewers yet?

==Completion==
What a mean little creature!  I'm sure the Rokk will make something tasty with him.

I'm just kidding, of course.

<Old Man Barlo winks slyly.>

==Notes==
Of the five different fishing daily quests given out by {{NPC||Old Man Barlo}}, this is the only quest that has the chance of dropping [[Chuck's Bucket]], [[Toothy's Bucket]], [[Muckbreath's Bucket]], or [[Snarly's Bucket]]. The drop rate was once around 1% for each of these, but since patch 3.2 it is significantly higher.

You are also able to catch a [[Baby Crocolisk]] in Ironforge.
