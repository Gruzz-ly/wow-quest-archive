==Objectives==
Shadowstalker Kaide wants you to kill 10 Bonechewer Devastators and 6 Bonechewer Backbreakers.
*[[Bonechewer Devastator]] slain (10)
*[[Bonechewer Backbreaker]] slain (6)

==Description==
If word reaches [[Thrallmar]] that they've failed to contain the fel orcs, we're going to be receiving a lot of company down here. Frankly, I'm not sure I want all that attention, so we're going to keep this little problem under wraps, got it?

If we can inflict enough casualties on the fel orcs, chances are their presence will never come to the attention of anyone outside Stonebreaker. So, let's end it now.

Wade in there, swing your weapon, wave your hands, or whatever it is you do - just kill fel orcs.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Stout Oak Longbow|Deadeye's Piece|Dark Augur's Wand}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|10|}}
*10750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|16|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Tell me I wasn't wrong to trust you with this mission...

==Completion==
I know you're well-traveled, but understand, <name>, that some stories are best left where they happened. Do we understand each other?
