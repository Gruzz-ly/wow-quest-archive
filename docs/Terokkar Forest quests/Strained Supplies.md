== Objectives ==
Bring 8 Dreadfang Venom Sacs to [[Sha'nir]] in [[Shattrath City]].
Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease. 
*[[Dreadfang Venom Sac]] (8)

==  Description ==
More and more refugees come through the gates of [[Shattrath City]] each day. Some have sustained such injuries, it's a real wonder they made it here.

I can deal with most of the conventional injuries; my training as an Aldor healer has prepared me for that. Poison wounds are more problematic as my anti-venom supplies have begun to run low.

Bring me venom sacs from the local dreadfang spiders so I can produce more antidotes. You'll find a pocket of the spiders in the southeastern region of Terokkar.

==  Progress ==
Have you obtained the venom sacs, &lt;name&gt;? &nbsp;These refugees can't wait much longer.

==  Completion ==
You have my thanks, &lt;name&gt;. &nbsp;The Aldor will hear of your actions.

==  Gains ==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*10750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|16|}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*-275 [[reputation]] with [[The Scryers]]
