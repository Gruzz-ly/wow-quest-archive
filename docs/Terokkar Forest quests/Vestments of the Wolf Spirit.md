==Objectives==
Bring 12 Timber Worg Pelts to [[Malukaz]] at [[Stonebreaker Hold]].
*[[Timber Worg Pelt]] (12)

==Description==
Generations ago, when orc clans still called [[Terokkar Forest]] home, the wolf spirit played an important role in their lives. When the orcs departed, they had no longer had any need for the spirit and they left it behind.

In time, the spirit grew lonely and it too left the forest.

I believe I can bring the wolf spirit back to his ancestral home, just as we orcs have returned. The ritual will require me to create vestments from the pelts of the wolves of the forest to guide the spirit back to its home.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|10|}}
*10750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|16|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Were you able to find all the pelts that I need?

==Completion==
These are perfect, <name>! I could not have asked for better.
