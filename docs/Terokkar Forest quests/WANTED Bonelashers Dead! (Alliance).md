==Objectives==
Kill 20 Bonelashers and then report to [[Taela Everstride]] at the [[Allerian Stronghold]] in [[Terokkar Forest]]. 
*[[Bonelasher]] slain (20)

==Description==
A bounty is declared on the bonelashers of the [[Bone Wastes]]. As known carriers of the plague, they are to be destroyed forthwith!

While they can be found throughout the wastes, they are known to congregate at [[Carrion Hill]] in the north.

Report to Taela Everstride afterward to collect your reward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|30|}}
*11000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60|}} at max level)

==Progress==
I suppose you're after the bonelasher bounty too?

==Completion==
Yeah, I'm sure that you killed all of those bonelashers. &nbsp;It's obvious since the captain asked for you to turn in proof on that wanted poster.

<Taela gives you a sarcastic look.>

I'll take your word for it. &nbsp;I'm not certain who I angered to pull this duty, but thanks for your efforts on behalf of the [[Alliance]]. &nbsp;Here's a little something for all of your trouble.
