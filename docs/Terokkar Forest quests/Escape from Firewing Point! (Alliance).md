==Objectives==
Escort [[Isla Starmane]] to safety and then report to [[Captain Auric Sunchaser]] at the [[Allerian Stronghold]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].
* Escort Isla Starmane to safety
* Suggested Players [2]

==Description==
Thank goodness for you!

<class>, I need you to help me escape. I have information vital to the security of the Allerian Stronghold and probably all of [[Outland]]!

I came here from the [[Cenarion Expedition]] on a diplomatic mission, but as you can see, they weren't very friendly. If you help me get to safety, I can assure you that you will be handsomely rewarded!

We won't be able to do this on our own - you do have a group with you, right?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Blood-Guided Knife
|Healer's Staff of the Forest
|Terokkar Axe}}
You will also receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Completion==
Isla Starmane just left, but she gave me a full rundown on what's going on out at [[Firewing Point]].  It's understandable that she's quite distraught over what happened to the [[Cenarion Thicket]].  Nasty blood elves!

She told me how you were instrumental in saving her so that we could get that information.  Allerian Stronghold is indebted to you for your service.

Please, accept this gift on behalf of us all. 

==Notes==
She follows the path out of the building, to the path that circles the mana bomb in the center of the courtyard.  She follows the circular path to the left (counterclockwise) towards the path out of [[Firewing Point]].  Once she passes through the archway to [[Firewing Point]], you will receive the quest objective credit.

This escort quest can easily be soloed. She doesn't deviate off the path nor does she run out into the surrounding mobs. It helps to walk slightly ahead of her so you can pull the mobs you think you will run into, so you can fight them individually instead of 2 or more at a time. Fortunately, Isla Starmane helps in the fights as well.
