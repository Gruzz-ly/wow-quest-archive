==Objectives==
It takes many basilisk eyes to make even a small dose of [[Voren'thal]]'s elixir.  Bringing me more would certainly incur the [[Scryers]]' favor. 
*[[Dampscale Basilisk Eye]] (8)

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*-275 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Scryers]]

==Completion==
I thank you, <name>.  Voren'thal's visions might one day decide the fate of our race.  It would behoove us to do our best to ensure that those visions are as accurate as possible.

==Notes==
This quest can be repeated up to Neutral reputation.
