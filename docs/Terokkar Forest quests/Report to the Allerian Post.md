You were the one to find the box of parts, it is only right that you carry word to someone who will know how to act on the information...

This quest is part of {{questchain|The Terokkar Mana Bomb}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
[[Jenai Starwhisper]] wants you to report to [[Lieutenant Meridian]] at the [[Allerian Post]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].

==Description==
This calls for immediate action!

We have someone out in the field closer to [[Firewing Point]] that I want you to speak with. He'll have a better idea of what our next step should be.

Report to Lieutenant Meridian out at the Allerian Post and apprise him of the situation. You'll find the post to the northeast on the southern bank of the river just south of Firewing Point.

Godspeed, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||52|50}}
*1100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Bomb parts. So my suspicions were true. That's not something that I wanted to be right about.

Ok, you and I have some grim business ahead of us then.

==Notes==
Since this is the first time that you have been to visit Lieutenant Meridian, he must have been looking into the situation beforehand.
