==Objectives==
[[Oakun]] wants you to travel east to the [[Derelict Caravan]] to recover the Dread Relic. Return to Oakun when the task is complete.
*[[Dread Relic (The Dread Relic)]]
*[[Derelict Caravan Chest Key]] (provided)

==Description==
Long ago a caravan went to [[Auchindoun]] with a mission to take a Dread Relic from the ancient tombs beneath the necropolis. They fled, but the relic was their undoing. The relic is evil and it summons evil when touched. Their caravan was destroyed somewhere to the east.

This dark artifact is the key to a terrible plan to defeat [[Teribus the Cursed]], a creature that flies over the [[Bone Wastes]]. Help me if you wish, but your life and even your soul will be at risk. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|50|}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Sha'tar]]

==Progress==
Do you have the Dread Relic?  We must have it.

==Completion==
It is incredible that you succeeded.  The Dread Relic is far more powerful than I feared. Only a mighty hero could have survived the long journey back carrying such [[Blasphemy|blasphemous]] evil.

==Progression==
*[[The Dread Relic]]
**[[Evil Draws Near]]
