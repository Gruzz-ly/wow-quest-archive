==Objectives==
Bring the Cabal Orders to [[Mekeda]] at the [[Refugee Caravan]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].
*[[Cabal Orders]] (provided)

==Description==
This message bears a dark seal and though the language seems somewhat familiar, it appears to be encoded.

Perhaps someone at the [[Refugee Caravan]] will know something about it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5400 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]

==Progress==
You wish to show me something, <name>?

==Completion==
Ah, yes... this was written in a basic form of the shadow cypher. My knowledge of it is not perfect but it should suffice to translate this.

You learn much about unsavory subjects when you live among outcasts and refugees in the Lower City.

==Notes==
The orders drop randomly from Cabal members.

==Progression==
#[[Cabal Orders (quest)]]
#[[The Shadow Tomb]]
