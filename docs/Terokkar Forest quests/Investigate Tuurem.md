At least the Wind Trader made it a more fair trade than you'd originally bargained for.  Not that you had much say in the terms.  So... Who did the parts go to?

This quest is part of {{questchain|The Terokkar Mana Bomb}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Find the Sealed Box and then deliver it to [[Earthbinder Tavgren]] just outside of the [[Cenarion Thicket]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].
*[[Sealed Box]]

==Description==
You know, come to think of it, I do recall selling several boxes of strange and exotic engineering parts to [[Empoor]] about a month ago. I'm not sure what they'd be used for, but I know that they were delivered to [[Tuurem]].

Perhaps one or more of those boxes is still there?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|10}}
*10750 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
What news do you bring, <Name>?

==Completion==
[[Ethereal]]s? Goods delivered to Tuurem? Exotic [[engineering]] parts? And a [[blood elf]] getting ready to deliver this last box to [[Firewing Point]]?

What does all of this mean?! How does it relate to what happened to the druids in the [[Cenarion Thicket]]?

I think we should have a look inside that box.

==Notes==
The box is at 54,30.  Coming from Shattrath, you pass 2 huts on your left, one on your right, then come to a bridge.  Cross the river to your left (instead of going across the bridge).  Look in the ruined huts there.  You'll know you're there when you find the Blood Elf Courier.

==Progression==
