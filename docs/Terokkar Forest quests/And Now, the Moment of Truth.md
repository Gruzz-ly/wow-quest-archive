==Objectives==
Find Grek and ask him to try it on his weapon. Once he's tried out the oil, return to [[Rakoria]] with the results. 
*Have [[Grek]] Test Olemba Oil

==Description==
The oil is finally ready for its first test. It seems heavy enough to serve as a high quality weapon oil.

The only way to find out is to have a professional try it out. See Grek over there by the wanted posters? Sure, he's no poet, but the [[orc]] knows his way around a weapon!

Take a sample of the oil to him and ask him to use it on his weapon. After he's had a chance to test it out, let me know what he thinks of it. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Expired Mana Oil|Expired Wizard Oil}}

You will also receive:
*8250 [[XP]] (or {{cost|4|95|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Well, do you have the test results?

==Completion==
<You tell Rakoria the results of the test and she throws her head back, laughing.>

==Notes==
Speak with Grek:
:You read wanted poster to Grek?

:Grek want to help!

:{{Gossip|Grek, will you try out this new weapon oil Rakoria made?}}
:{{Text|say|Grek|Grek try!}}
:{{Text|say|Grek|This oil no good for Grek! What Grek look like to you, some weakling in robes?}}
