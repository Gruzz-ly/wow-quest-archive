==Objectives==
[[Rokag]] wants you to seek out [[Rilak the Redeemed]] in [[Shattrath]] and demand that he and his people surrender to the [[Horde]].

==Description==
The cowardly [[arakkoa]] attack us daily. They ambush our hunters and sometimes even raid inside our walls. We kill them when we can, but their magic is strong and they often escape our warbands.

I have learned that some arakkoa claim to be friendly with the [[Horde]]. They live in [[Shattrath City]] to the northwest. [[Rilak the Redeemed]] is their leader. Search for him in the [[Lower City]], and when you find him, demand his surrender.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|30}}
*10400 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]

==Completion==
Your people are angry but there is little I can do. Some of us have been touched by the power of the [[Naaru]] and we are forever changed. Those of us who remain in the wild are as we have always been.

==Progression==
