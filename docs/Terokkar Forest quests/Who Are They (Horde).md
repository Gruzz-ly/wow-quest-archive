*[[Shadowy Initiate]] Spoken To
*[[Shadowy Laborer]] Spoken To
*[[Shadowy Advisor]] Spoken To

==Description==
I don't know who they are, but I know they're hostile!

I'm going to give you a disguise, and I want you to go in there and speak with three of them that I've observed as being 'chatty'. Talk with the initiate, the laborer, and the advisor.

Just watch out; there're a [[Shadowy Hunter|few hunters]] in there who'll be able to see through your disguise and they look tough! And whatever you do, don't leave the village—the disguise is kind of flimsy. If you lose your disguise, come back to me and I'll give you another.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|30|}}
*11000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60|}} at max level)

==Progress==
You speak with all of them yet?  What did they have to say?

==Completion==
Good, you finally made it back! &nbsp;Okay, what did you figure out? &nbsp;Who are they?

==Progression==
{{Kill the Shadow Council! (Horde)}}

==Notes==
;Shadowy Initiate
{{Dialogue|Yes?  Darn it all, now I'll have to start over from scratch!
{{Gossip|What are you doing there?}}

:Practicing!  Soon I'll be good enough to join the other summoners and take my turn inside the Shadow Labyrinth at Auchindoun.

:I hope that I'll get the chance to summon something big!  Maybe something as big as Murmur, though I wouldn't lose control of him!}}

;Shadowy Summoner/Shdowy Executioner
{{Dialogue|*<She/He leans in closer.>

Just between you and me, I'm thinking about 'mustering' out one of these nights.  You know what I mean?}}

*I joined up because they said they'd pay my way into the academy.  My uncle says that I can go next season!

*Did you hear that they lost total control of Murmur in the Shadow Labyrinth?!

*If you're interested, a couple of us are going into Shattrath for drinks later.

*I hope this place pans out as a forward base for Shadow Council operations.  I know it sounds weird, but I kind of miss the Shadow Labyrinth.

*Interested in joining up for the leather ball league?  We play Monday through Wednesday, mostly. 

You're welcome to join us after this shift.  We're going to toss it around.

Just between you and me, I'm thinking about 'mustering' out one of these nights.  You know what I mean?

;Shadowy Laborer
{{Dialogue|Yeah, what do you want?  Can't you see I'm busy here?  The Shadow Council isn't paying me by the hour!

{{Gossip|Why are you fixing all of this up?}}
:What's it look like I'm doing?  I'm fixing the place up - all on my own I might add - so that we can move in!

:With a base of operations out here in the forest, it'll be easier to keep track of what Shattrath, Allerian, Stonebreaker and the Cenarion druids are all up to.  Our base in Auchindoun is just too inconvenient for that.

:Wait a minute, do I know you?}}

;Shadowy Advisor
{{Dialogue|And what is it exactly that you think I can do for you?  Can't you see that I'm very busy here discussing matters of import with our illustrious leader?

Be quick about your business or I'll have you beaten, dog!

{{Gossip|Advisor, what's the latest news?}}

:Well, I was just giving our leader here a progress report on how everything is proceeding according to plan.  It should only be a few more weeks and we'll have this place back in shape.

:We may want the Shadow Council to only staff the village with orcs, however.  That way we can make an ancestral claim and work undercover.

:Wait a minute.  Do I know you?  What's your name?}}

;Shadowmaster Grieve
{{Dialogue|Who do you think you are that you can walk in here and address me?  I'm the leader of the Shadow Council in this village.  Get out of my sight!

If I see you again, I'll be the last person that you ever see.  Understand?

Perhaps you'd like to be buried in the labyrinth of Auchindoun, or sacrificed to Murmur?}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.4.2|note=The Shadowy Disguise will no longer be applied to druids while they are in [[Moonkin Form|Moonkin]] or [[Incarnation: Tree of Life|Tree of Life]] form.}}
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
