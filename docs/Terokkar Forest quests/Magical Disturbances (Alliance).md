==Objectives==
[[Andarl]] at the [[Allerian Stronghold]] wants you to kill 10 Warp Stalkers.
*[[Warp Stalker]] slain (10)

==Description==
It's embarrassing to admit this, but something has happened to me here in [[Terokkar Forest]] that hasn't occurred since my apprentice days.

Occasionally, my spells will fizzle when I know I've done everything correctly. I almost drove myself crazy the first time it happened.

I think I've found the cause. The forest is full of creatures called warp stalkers, demonic creatures with an affinity for magic and a habit of disturbing magical flows. The best way to deal with them is simply to kill them.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3|10}}

==Progress==
Have you cleared the warp stalkers from the vicinity of the stronghold?

==Completion==
<Andarl dabs at his forehead with the sleeve of his robe.>

Thank goodness. I was beginning to wonder if the things had displaced the rest of the forest's creatures.
