==Objectives==
Bertelm at the [[Allerian Stronghold]] wants you to bring him 12 Timber Worg Tails. The tails can come from either Timber Worgs or Timber Worg Alphas.
*[[Timber Worg Tail]] (12)

==Description==
Have you come across the timber worgs in your travels? I've had the opportunity to observe them while mapping some of the northern reaches of the forest. I wouldn't recommend getting close to them unless you're prepared for combat.

They have no fear of us and won't hesitate to defend their territory.

It's fitting that such a creature would have a magnificent tail. I've been trying to collect enough of them to trim a new cloak, but the worgs have a habit of evading my snares. Will you help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|10|}}
*10750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|16|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]
*250 reputation with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]
*250 reputation with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]
*250 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
*250 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
I see you've managed to survive the rigors of the forest. Have you brought any tails for my cloak?

==Completion ==
Ah, well done, friend. These are finer than I thought they'd be. They'll make a fine cloak.

<Bertelm glances toward the inn.>

Yes, a fine cloak it shall be.
