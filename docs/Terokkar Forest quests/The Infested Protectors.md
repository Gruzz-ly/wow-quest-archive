==Objectives==
Lakotae wants you to kill 25 Wood Mites and then return to him at the Refugee Caravan. The mites can be found living inside the bodies of Rotting Forest-Ragers and Infested Root-Walkers. 
*[[Wood Mite|Wood Mite]] slain (25)

==Description==
The trees of this land are ravaged by the power that was unleashed from [[Auchindoun]]. The foul magic that was unleashed blasted the land into the wastes you see all around. The trees that survived are now infested with wretched wood mites that crawl under their bark and gnaw at their flesh. 

Rotting forest-rages and infested root-walkers are breeding grounds for the mites. They are found along the edge of the wood to the east. Destroy these creatures and then kill the mites that flee their husks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|30}}
*11000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Have you destroyed the worst of the infestations? 

==Completion==
You have done much to help [[Terokkar Forest]], <name>.  With the worst of the mite colonies destroyed we may yet be able to reclaim this wasted land.

==Patch changes==
