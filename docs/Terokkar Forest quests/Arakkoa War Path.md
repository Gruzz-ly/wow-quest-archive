'''Arakkoa War Path''' is a Horde-only quest in [[Terokkar Forest]]. In this quest, players are sent to launch a counter-attack against the [[arakkoa]] of the forest, who have been raiding [[Stonebreaker Hold]].

==Objectives==
[[Advisor Faila]] asks that you kill 14 [[Shienor Talonite]]s and 6 [[Shienor Sorcerer]]s and then return to her in [[Stonebreaker Hold]].
*[[Shienor Talonite]] slain (14)
*[[Shienor Sorcerer]] slain (6)

==Description==
The [[arakkoa]] have attacked us again, this time striking in the night and then using their dark magic to escape before we could charge out to meet them in numbers. They use their summoning circles to rescue their warriors from certain death but they cannot run from us if we attack their homes. [[Veil Reskk]] and [[Veil Shienor]] lie to the north and northeast.

Find these arakkoa nests and kill as many as you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive {{cost|2|70|}}

==Progress==
How many arakkoa have slain <name>? Did they run from you? Did they run and hide when you stormed into their camp?

==Completion==
Well done <class>. &nbsp;The arakkoa have learned to fear the might of the [[Horde]].
