==Objectives==
Kill 12 Warped Peons and then report to [[Theloria Shadecloak]] at Allerian Post.
*[[Warped Peon]] slain (12)

==Description==
The recent arrival of the fel orcs at the ruins to the east both puzzles and troubles [[Thander]]. They wasted no time in starting to construct fortifications and repair the buildings.

The construction goes on day and night, &lt;name&gt;. I've dispatched one of my most reliable agents to keep watch, but we can ill afford to delay action. Move against their workers, then seek out [[Theloria Shadecloak]] at the Allerian Post to the north of the Bonechewer Ruins. She'll give you further instructions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|90|}}
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at max level)

==Progress==
I take it Bertelm sent you to hamper the efforts of their peons?

==Completion==
<The high elf nods.>

It's a good start, but [[Bertelm]] was right to send you to me. I've made a discovery that may help explain the fel orc presence here.
