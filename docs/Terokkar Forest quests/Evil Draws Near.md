==Objectives==
[[Oakun]] wants you to take the Dread Relic to the [[Writhing Mound]]. Once there, kill [[Auchenai Death-Speaker]]s and [[Auchenai Doomsayer]]s to collect 20 [[Doom Skull]]s. Then find the [[Writhing Mound Summoning Circle]] and use the Dread Relic to summon and destroy Teribus the Cursed. Return to Oakun when the deed is done. 
*[[Teribus the Cursed]]  slain
*[[Dread Relic (Evil Draws Near)]] (provided)

==Description==
Now you must use the Dread Relic in a foul necromantic ritual if you wish to challenge Teribus the Cursed. To the northeast, beyond [[Auchindoun]], is the Writhing Mound, a place where [[necromancer]]s gather.

The auchenai death-speakers and doomsayers carry doom skulls that are laced with powerful necro-enchantments. If you collect enough skulls you can use their power along with the power of the Dread Relic to command Teribus to face you. 

==Rewards==
