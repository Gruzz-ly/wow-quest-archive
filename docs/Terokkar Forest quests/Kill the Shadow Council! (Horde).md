==Objectives==
Kill 10 Shadowy Executioners, 10 Shadowy Summoners and Shadowmaster Grieve, and then return to [[Advisor Faila]] at [[Stonebreaker Hold]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].
*[[Shadowy Executioner]] slain (10)
*[[Shadowy Summoner]] slain (10)
*[[Shadowmaster Grieve]] slain

==Description==
What! Those guys are [[Shadow Council]]?!

<Name>, you have to go back in there and waste them! I want you to take out their leader and as many of their executioners and summoners as you can.

After you're done with that, report back to [[Advisor Faila]] at [[Stonebreaker Hold]].

Good luck, <class>!

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
*{{cost|6|60|}}
*13750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|8|25|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Well, what did you find out?

==Completion==
That is unfortunate news! &nbsp;But, of course, I made the right choice in sending you out there to help Neftis. &nbsp;The last thing that we need is the Shadow Council establishing a strong point right on our doorstep!

<Name>, you've earned yourself something nice. &nbsp;Go ahead, take your pick.
