==Objectives==
Go into the [[Shadow Tomb]], west of the [[Refugee Caravan]] and retrieve the Drape of Arunen, the Gavel of K'alen and the Scroll of Atalor. Return to [[Mekeda]] at the Refugee Caravan after you've completed this task.
*[[Scroll of Atalor]]
*[[Drape of Arunen]]
*[[Gavel of K'alen]]

==Description==
Many believe it was the [[Shadow Council]] that caused the explosion that tore [[Auchindoun]] apart. It is rumored they awoke a great evil inside.

If that is true, then that evil must have turned against them. According to these orders, part of the Shadow Council is fleeing Auchindoun. They are using the Shadow Tomb to store powerful artifacts from Auchindoun.

Three of these are sacred, for they belonged to the powerful patriarchs Arunen, K'alen and Atalor. I must ask you to retrieve them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Heirloom Signet of Willpower|Heirloom Signet of Valor|Heirloom Signet of Convalescence}}

You will also receive:
*13350 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]

==Progress==
Have you retrieved the relics, <name>? &nbsp;We cannot allow the Shadow Council to use their power for dark purposes.

==Completion==
The Light might have forgotten me, but I have not forgotten the Light. &nbsp;These relics were once very sacred to my people.

Allowing the Shadow Council to use their power for evil is... unthinkable!
