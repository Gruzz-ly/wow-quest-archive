==Objectives==
Locate and speak with [[Private Weeks]] near the north entrance to Grangol'var Village in [[Terokkar Forest]].

==Description==
A report's just come in from one of our scouts near Grangol'var Village. He says that a shadowy band has moved into the ruins there.

<Name>, I want you to speak with [[Private Weeks]] and see how you can assist him to figure out what this unknown group is up to. Just head west past [[Stonebreaker Hold]]. His last report puts his position near the north entrance to the village.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|26|}} at max level)

==Completion==
It's about time someone came out here. &nbsp;I sent that report to the [[Allerian Stronghold]] over a week ago!

Bureaucracy!
