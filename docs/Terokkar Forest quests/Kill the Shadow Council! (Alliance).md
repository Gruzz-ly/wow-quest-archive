Kill 10 Shadowy Executioners, 10 Shadowy Summoners and Shadowmaster Grieve, and then return to [[Lieutenant Gravelhammer]] at the [[Allerian Stronghold]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].
*[[Shadowy Executioner]] slain (10)
*[[Shadowy Summoner]] slain (10)
*[[Shadowmaster Grieve]] slain

==Description==
What! Those guys are Shadow Council?!

<name>, you have to go back in there and waste them! I want you to take out their leader and as many of their executioners and summoners as you can.

After you're done with that, report back to [[Lieutenant Gravelhammer]] at the [[Allerian Stronghold]].

Good luck, <class>!

==Progress==
Well, what did ye find out, <lad/lass>?

==Completion==
That's dire news indeed! &nbsp;Well, it would seem I made the right choice in sending you out there to help Weeks. &nbsp;The last thing that we want is the Shadow Council establishing themselves right on our doorstep!
