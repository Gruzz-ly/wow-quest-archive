==Objectives==
Kill Ashkaz in [[Veil Reskk]], Ayit in [[Veil Shienor]], and Urdak in [[Veil Skith]] and return to [[Thander]] at the [[Allerian Stronghold]].
*[[Ashkaz]] slain
*[[Ayit]] slain
*[[Urdak]] slain

==Description==
We need to show the arakkoa that they cannot attack our people with impunity. If we don't stop them here, the roads will no longer be safe for our merchants, couriers, or soldiers.

My scouts have identified the leaders of each of the major arakkoa settlements in the area. Seek out [[Ashkaz]], [[Ayit]], and [[Urdak]], in Veil Reskk, Veil Shienor, and Veil Skith and kill them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Super Healing Potion|Super Mana Potion}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|10|}}
*10750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|16|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
It's good to see you again, <name>. Have you done as I asked?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. We have enough to worry about without wondering when the arakkoa will accost our merchants and messengers again.

==Patch changes==
