==Objectives==
[[Lieutenant Gravelhammer]] asks that you kill 14 Shienor Talonites and 6 Shienor Sorcerers and then return to him in [[Allerian Stronghold]].
*[[Shienor Talonite]] slain (14)
*[[Shienor Sorcerer]] slain (6)

==Description==
The [[arakkoa]] have attacked us again, this time striking in the night and then using their dark magic to escape before we could marshal our soldiers. 

[[Veil Reskk]] and [[Veil Shienor]] lie to the north and northwest. Find these arakkoa nests and kill as many as you can. They may not fear us, but at least we can thin their numbers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at max level)

==Progress==
How many arakkoa have you slain <name>?

==Completion==
Well done <class>. &nbsp;The arakkoa have learned to fear the might of the [[Alliance]].

==Patch changes==
