==Objectives==
Deliver the Box of Parts to [[Jenai Starwhisper]] at the [[Allerian Stronghold]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].
*[[Box of Parts]] (provided)

==Description==
I don't know about you, but I have no idea what all of those things are. I do know one thing though - they look dangerous!

<Name>, I think you should take this box of parts to Jenai Starwhisper at the Allerian Stronghold to the southeast. She may have some idea of what these are.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
{{cost|1|60}}

==Progress==
You look concerned.  What is it, <class>?

==Completion==
Oh no!  That's horrible news!  I can't believe that all but two of our Cenarion friends are dead.

Alright, let me have a look at those parts.  I'm just hoping they aren't what I suspect that they might be.

Yes, as I feared, I believe these are bomb parts.  Our eyes and ears in Shattrath City have been feeding us information about some of the [[ethereal]]s importing proscribed goods from other dimensions that they're in contact with.
