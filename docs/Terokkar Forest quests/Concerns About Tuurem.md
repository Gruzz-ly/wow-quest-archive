==Objectives==
Speak with [[Andarl]] at the [[Allerian Stronghold]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].

==Description==
The rumors from [[Tuurem]] are unsettling. Some say the town's ruins are overrun with crazed [[Broken]] and [[Lost One]]s, while opportunistic artifact hunters steal [[draenei]] relics.

It's hard to know which are true and which aren't, but we have a responsibility to safeguard the ruins as best we can. Find Andarl at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest. He is something of a student of [[magic]]al relics. More than anyone else, he's likely to know what's going on there.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*2550 [[XP]] (or {{cost|s=60}} at level 70)

==Completion==
I'm flattered that your Broken friend considers me a [[scholar]] of his people's relics, but to be honest, I haven't had much chance to study them since my arrival here. It was certainly my intent, but when I arrived, I found that there were other matters that required my attention.

==Patch changes==
