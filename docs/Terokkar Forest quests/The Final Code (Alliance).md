==Objectives==
[[Lieutenant Meridian]] wants you to use [[The Final Code]] to set off the [[Mana Bomb]]. Then report back to [[Jenai Starwhisper]] at the [[Allerian Stronghold]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].
*[[Mana Bomb (Terokkar Forest)|Mana Bomb]] Activated

==Description==
They're building a second mana bomb in the courtyard. My intel suggests that the final code for the bomb is being held by [[Sharth Voldoun]], the overseer of the project at [[Firewing Point]].

<name>, you have to go back in there and retrieve the final code from him. He keeps himself to the top of the highest spire.

Take the final code to the mana bomb that they're working on in the central courtyard and set it off.

Only then will we be certain that the Allerian Stronghold is safe.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Edge of Inevitability|Warpstalker Breastplate|Ancient Terokkar Hood|Bloodfire Leggings}}
You will also receive {{cost|6|60}}.

==Progress==
Lieutenant Meridian has been keeping us apprised of the situation at Firewing Point. Is everything okay? 

==Completion==
YOU DID IT!  YOU SAVED US!  YOU SAVED THE ALLERIAN STRONGHOLD!!

With their forces decimated, their leader dead and the mana bomb destroyed, we can all breathe much easier now.

<name>, I've never seen such selflessness... such heroism!  Please, accept this on behalf of all of us.

==Notes==
Upon using [[The Final Code]] on the Mana Bomb, a five-second timer will start before it explodes, killing all [[Firewing Warlock]]s in the vicinity.
