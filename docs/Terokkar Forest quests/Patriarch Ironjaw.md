==Objectives==
Bring Ironjaw's Pelt to [[Malukaz]] at [[Stonebreaker Hold]].
*[[Ironjaw's Pelt]]

==Description==
You've done well in gathering the first pelts.

The final piece of the vestments requires a pelt unlike any other. There is one particular wolf, an old and cunning one, that has earned his place as the patriarch of the forest wolves. He is known among them as Ironjaw, the mighty hunter.

In my visions, I have seen him wandering the northeastern region of the forest. Including his pelt in the vestments will surely light the wolf spirit's path.

Do not mourn Ironjaw. He will be well honored.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|10|}}
*13350 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|42|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
The spirit awaits, <name>. Have you the pelt of the wolf patriarch?

==Completion==
The pelt is even more magnificent than I had hoped! This is a good omen, &lt;name&gt;, and the spirits will favor you for your contribution to this ceremony.

I have fashioned a helmet for you from the remaining pelts, &lt;name&gt;. It identifies you as a mighty hunter and an ally of the great wolf spirit of [[Terokkar Forest]].
