==Objectives==
[[Dwarfowitz]] at the [[Sha'tari Base Camp]] in the [[Bone Wastes]] wants you to bring him 8 Mature Bone Sifter Carcasses.
*[[Mature Bone Sifter Carcass]] (8)
*[[Fumper (2)]] (provided)

==Description==
How would you like to do a little more work for the [[Explorers' League]]? These bone worms have us all quite intrigued.

I've got a drum right here that you can use out in the Bone Wastes. Just bang on the damned thing and see what you get. If it's a worm, kill it and bring back the carcass for us to study. We'll need a good lot of carcasses to get a valid testing sample.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*11000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]

==Progress==
We think the one that popped up at the dig was actually a baby worm!

==Completion==
[[Sand Gnome|Sand gnome]]s? Yea, sure... The desert can do strange things to a person.

I think we're about to make a breakthrough here with these worms!

==Notes==
This quest, along with the other quests in this questline, is a reference to the novel series of Dune. The Fumper's original name is Thumper and was used to attract huge sandworms beneath the sand.
