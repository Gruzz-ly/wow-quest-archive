==Objectives==
[[Commander Ra'vaj]] at the [[Sha'tari Outpost]] in the [[Bone Wastes]] of [[Terokkar Forest]] wants you to burn 8 Slain Auchenai Warriors and 8 Slain Sha'tar Vindicators.
*[[Slain Sha'tar Vindicator]] corpse burned (8)
*[[Slain Auchenai Warrior]] corpse burned (8)
*[[Sha'tari Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
Is there nothing that can be done to stem the tide of corruption? My soldiers have been battling the Auchenai for days now with no end in sight. Each casualty, whether Auchenai or Sha'tar, is snatched from the battlefield - their [[soul]]s lifted and taken to parts unknown.

I will not have it! A proper burial is out of the question but those fiends will not have their souls! Take this torch and travel to the field of battle, directly east of here. Burn every corpse you see! We will not fuel their rituals.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*11000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60|}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]

==Progress==
It's a terrible thing to ask, I know...

==Completion==
<Commander Ra'vaj holds his head in his hands.>

It's not enough... It's just not enough.
