&nbsp;[[Warden Treelos]]' has become a bit mad due to the accident that occurred in the [[Cenarion Thicket]].  He wants you to either invite a large mutated Teromoth, [[Naphthal'ar]], to tea, or kill him.  You decide.

==Objectives==
Kill Naphthal'ar and then return to [[Warden Treelos]] at the [[Cenarion Thicket]] in [[Terokkar Forest]]. 
*[[Naphthal'ar]] slain

==Description==
Quick, hide! The eyes of [[Naphthal'ar]] are upon you... upon us all!

I dare not go to the top of the tower to speak with it, but you... you look as if you might know the right words to say. Just be careful, it doesn't like jokes and will not suffer fools easily.

If you can, convince it to come down for tea. But, by all means, get it to stop staring at me!

==Rewards==
You may choose one of the following:
:[[Lucky Circle of the Fool]]
:[[Moonstruck Bands]]
:[[Crazy Cenarion Cloak]]
:[[Lunatic's Choker]]
:[[Madman's Blade]]

==Progress==
We should never have invited them to dinner. That much is certain!

Or, at least, we should have insisted upon a couple of courses before the dessert that they brought.

==Completion==
It's for the best, really. If it cannot civilly accept an invitation then it has no business attending.

<[[Warden Treelos]] looks momentarily confused.>

Who are you and what are you doing here? You must get out of here quickly before it is too late!

==Notes==
[[Naphthal'ar]] is found at {{Co|43|22|Terokkar Forest}}, on the top of the tower on the west side of the [[Cenarion Thicket]] lodge. There is a ramp to the left before you get to the lodge. Take it up to the tower, then climb the tower to the top.

All around the lodge and the nearby tower is a curse/debuff called [[Strange Aura]] that reduces all stats by 5%. When you leave the [[Cenarion Thicket]], the curse/debuff goes away.
