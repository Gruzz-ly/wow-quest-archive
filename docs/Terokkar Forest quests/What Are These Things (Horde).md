This quest is part of [[The Terokkar Mana Bomb quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Deliver the Box of Parts to [[Tooki]] at [[Stonebreaker Hold]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].
*[[Box of Parts]] (provided)

==Description==
I don't know about you, but I have no idea what all of those things are. I do know one thing though - they look dangerous!

<name>, I think you should take this box of parts to Tooki at Stonebreaker Hold to the southeast. He may have some idea of what these are.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|60}}
*5400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You look concerned.  What is it, <class>?

==Completion==
Oh no!  That's horrible news!  I can't believe that all but two of our Cenarion friends are dead.

Alright, let me have a look at those parts.  I'm just hoping they aren't what I suspect that they might be.

==Progression==
