This quest is part of [[The Terokkar Mana Bomb quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Kill 10 Firewing Defenders, 10 Firewing Bloodwarders, and 10 Firewing Warlocks. Then report back to [[Sergeant Chawni]] at [[Stonebreaker Camp]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].
*[[Firewing Defender]] slain (10)
*[[Firewing Bloodwarder]] slain (10)
*[[Firewing Warlock]] slain (10)

==Description==
We know that the blood elves of [[Firewing Point]] are working for [[Kael'thas]] and [[Illidan]]. And from what you've told me, clearly they are using the [[Broken]] of [[Tuurem]] as smuggling go-betweens for the creation of some horrible weapon.

Whatever they're up to out there, the most efficient thing that we can do right now is to thin out their numbers.

The Firewing blood elves need to be taken out! Head up to Firewing Point to the north and see to it.

==Rewards==
You will receive {{cost|3|10}}

==Progress==
Report. What news do you bring from Firewing Point?

==Completion==
That's a good start, but based on what you witnessed there in the courtyard, as well as intelligence that I've received, we have a far more pressing matter at hand!

==Progression==
