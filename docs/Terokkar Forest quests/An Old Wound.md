==Objectives==
Speak to the soulpriests at [[Auchindoun]].
*Speak to the [[Auchenai]] soulpriests

==Description==
<[[Apprentice Beruun|Beruun]] whispers to you.>

There are ways, I'm sure you know, for the [[draenei]] to speak to the dead.

It's not the same as having a loved one back but...

[[Exarch Hataaru|Hataaru]]'s ashes were taken to Auchindoun after the soulpriests reclaimed the temple. Maybe they might know a way to help [[Ataanya]] with her loss?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*850 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

==Completion==
It is good to have visitors!

The honored dead here are well-cared for, but not many travel to commune with them.

Their deaths can be a painful reminder of what the draenei have endured.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Beruun|I was afraid of this. It's not her work. It's... it's the [[Tishamaat]] itself.}}
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Beruun|The Tishamaat is a time of remembrance. And of letting go of the past.}}
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Beruun|She lost her father, Exarch Hataaru, in the siege. Speaking of him saddens and angers her.}}
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Beruun|Ataanya may not be ready for the rituals of the Tishamaat. But... maybe we can help her.}}

Beruun has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|I know Ataanya has been helping the Auchenai rebuild, so hopefully they are willing to help.

{{Gossip|What else do you know about her father?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Hataaru was the Grand Artificer before Romuul, which means he was the leader of all other artificers.

He created the plans for Shattrath and oversaw its construction, as well as Karabor and all the other great temples.

He was amazing! I have all of his lectures on my hologem-- well, all of the ones that survived, at least.

Head to [[Auchindoun]]. Once there, the mausoleum has been reclaimed by the draenei. [[Auchenai Soulpriest (heritage)|Auchenai Soulpriests]] can be seen, some of them in the process of imbuing [[Vacant Vigilant]]s with souls, others walking the grounds alongside [[Bound Vigilant]]s. [[Omenai Curate]]s are working to rebuild the place and [[Auchenai Vindicator (heritage)|Auchenai Vindicators]] standing guard. [[Soultender Nemuraan]], [[Amaan the Wise]], and [[Boulestraan the Blinding Light]] are also there. [[D'ore]] can be seen floating in the sky above the [[Ring of Observance]] with souls circling it.

Amaan has some gossip:
{{Dialogue|
Do you hear that? The music of D'ore.

When I first heard its sweet melody return to Auchindoun, I wept. We have worked hard to restore our holy temples here, and these small moments remind me why it is worth it.

The world is ephemeral, but that which is loved will never know true death.
}}

Speak to Nemuraan:
{{Dialogue|
I apologize, but we are in the midst of a soulbinding ritual.

There is much to be done for the spirits in our care before we voyage to the [[Exodar]] to answer the [[Velen|Prophet]]'s call to the Tishamaat.

Is there something that requires our urgent attention?

{{Gossip|I thought Auchindoun was abandoned after the war.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Not entirely. Some of us hid from the [[orc]]s here.

After the invaders were driven from its sacred halls, we began the slow work of repairing the damage that the [[Shadow Council]] did to Auchindoun.

The dead deserve the rest that Auchindoun promised them. The orcs will not have taken that from them, nor from the others who will one day join them.

{{Gossip|Our dead are still being interred here?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Some.

Those who died in [[Shattrath]] were cremated after the city was reclaimed. Slowly, we have been relocating their ashes to Auchindoun and giving their souls the rites they were denied.

Eventually, the same will be done to those who yet languish in the "[[Path of Glory]]."

<Nemuraan's face twists into a grimace, then hardens with determination.>

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}}}}}

{{Gossip|What are you doing with these [[vigilant]]s?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
When Auchindoun was destroyed, most souls housed here were torn to shreds. Many who survived succumbed to madness.

Yet some were not so fargone that they could not be saved. We knew that binding souls to vigilants often had a calming effect, not unlike swaddling a child. The weight of a physical body seems to ground their emotions.

We keep them in the vigilants only temporarily. It is but a splint for a broken bone while the limb heals.

{{Gossip|Where do you get the vigilants from?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Ah, High Artificer Ataanya manufactures them for us in Shattrath.

We are aware it is not her specialty, but she insisted on making them herself.

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}}}}}

{{Gossip|quest=|High Artificer Ataanya will not attend the Tishamaat because she still mourns her father. Can you help her?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Ataanya? Ah, so it is finally time...

This is a matter you should discuss with our [[exarch]].

{{Gossip|quest=|Your exarch?}}
}}}}

''Nemuraan casts {{Abilities|Vision of the Auchenai|id=428417|icon=achievement_dungeon_auchindoun}} on the adventurer, allowing them to peer into the spirit realm. The soul of [[Exarch Maladaar]] appears.''
:{{Text|say|Exarch Maladaar|Thank you, Nemuraan. I take it you can see me now, <name>?}}

With this blessing, [[Draenei Spirit (Terokkar Forest)|draenei spirits]] appear around Auchindoun talking to the soulpriests, including [[Greatfather Aldrimus]] who can be seen talking to a big group of gathered soulpriests and vindicators.
