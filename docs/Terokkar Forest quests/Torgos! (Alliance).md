==Objectives==
Call down [[Torgos]] with Trachela's Carcass. Acquire a Tail Feather of Torgos and return it to [[Taela Everstride]] at the [[Allerian Stronghold]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].
*[[Tail Feather of Torgos]]
*[[Trachela's Carcass]]

==Description==
There's a creature in the [[Bone Wastes]] so fearsome that only the dauntless dare to stalk him.

I speak of Torgos, king of the bonelashers, who circles over [[Veil Rhaze]] on the western edge of the wastes.

Too bad that there's an [[arakkoa]]n scarecrow there, known as [[Torgos's Bane]], which keeps him at bay. I'd bet if you laid his mate Trachela's carcass at the foot of that scarecrow he'd come down anyway. She can be found at [[Carrion Hill]] in the northern wastes.

Bring me one of Torgos's tail feathers.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Terokkar Tablet of Vim|Terokkar Tablet of Precision}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|6|60|}}
*13750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|8|25|}} at max level)

==Progress==
You have the feather? &nbsp;Am I to reward you for your foolhardy bravery?

==Completion==
Color me impressed, <class>. &nbsp;Torgos was one of the toughest creatures I know of this side of [[Nagrand]].

Well, I suppose that's good enough for something from the [[Allerian Stronghold]] treasury. &nbsp;Take your pick.
