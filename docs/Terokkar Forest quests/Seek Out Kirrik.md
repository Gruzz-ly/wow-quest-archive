==Objectives==
Take Rilak's Missive to [[Kirrik the Awakened|Kirrik]] at the [[Refugee Caravan]] in [[the Bone Wastes]].
*[[Rilak's Missive]] (provided)

==Description==
Other [[arakkoa]] took part in the betrayal of Terokk.

Kirrik recognized [[Terokk]] as a charlatan, not a prophet. The only prophecy [[Terokk]] envisioned was the doom borne of his own bidding.

It was Kirrik who lead us bravely from Skettis. After our pilgrimage to [[Shattrath]], Kirrik traveled to the colonies in search of others.

This missive tells of what the Eyes have seen. Kirrik must be told! Follow the road south out of [[Shattrath]] to the Bone Wastes and look for the caravan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||74|}}
*2600 [[XP]] or {{cost||58|50}} at level 70
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]

==Progress==
You have traveled far and bear news for me.

==Completion==
Rilak's tale is grim, traveler. As you can see from the state of the caravan, there is much sorrow and darkness in the forest of Terokk these days.

==Progression==
