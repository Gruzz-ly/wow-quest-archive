==Objectives==
Speak to [[Ramdor the Mad]], standing on the bone pile outside of the Auchenai Crypts.

==Description==
I see dead draenei. They're all around us.

Bah, nobody believes me because I'm a child. Not even my own mommy believes me.

<Ha'lei points to Ramdor.>

He believes me, though... He sees them too. Boy does he get angry about it!

It's kind of funny. I see ghosts and people just smile and pat me on the head, trying to placate me. Ramdor sees ghosts and people label him as crazy. I sure hope I never grow up!

You should probably talk to Ramdor before you go inside. He was once a death priest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*260 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[The Sha'tar]]

==Completion==
The child is correct. I was once a "[[death priest]]."

<Ramdor winces.>

Such an unsavory title.

Through that corridor lies the [[Auchenai Crypts]]. Inside you will find the remnants of my priory. They are all mad now, of course. Insane to the last! I suppose I stood out, being the last one among them with any common sense. Of course, I was excommunicated for my beliefs.

What are my beliefs, you say?

==Trivia==
