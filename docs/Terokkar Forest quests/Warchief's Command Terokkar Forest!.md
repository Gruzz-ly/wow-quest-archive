==Objectives==
Speak with one of the [[druid]]s at the [[Cenarion Thicket]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].

==Description==
We have lost contact with the druids of the Cenarion Thicket{{sic}}

The [[Warchief]] has commanded any able bodies of the [[Horde]] to venture into Terokkar Forest and discover what has happened.

The thicket can be found by heading northwest through Terokkar Forest from [[Zangarmarsh]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||28|}}
* 970 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm glad that [[Stonebreaker Hold]] sent you.  The druids of the thicket have been slain!  Only myself and one other have survived, and he's insane.

I don't know what happened, but I intend to get to the bottom of it.  Whatever it was, it happened quickly and feels unnatural.

Will you help me?
