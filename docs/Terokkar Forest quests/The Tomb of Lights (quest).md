==Objectives==
[[High Priest Orglum]] wants you to journey to the [[Tomb of Lights]] and kill 10 Ethereal Nethermancers and 10 Ethereal Plunderers and then return to him by the [[Refugee Caravan]].
*[[Ethereal Nethermancer]] slain (10)
*[[Ethereal Plunderer]] slain (10)

==Description==
To the east, buried under the charred sand, is the Tomb of Lights, a lost resting place of the dead. Before our caravan was ambushed I was going to journey to the tomb and cleanse it of evil spirits. 

Little did I know it was already infested with another kind of evil. Even now the [[ethereal]]s plunder the bodies of the fallen for trinkets and keepsakes that were given to the dead centuries ago.

There is little I can do while our caravan struggles to survive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|30|}}
*11000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60|}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]

==Progress==
How many ethereals have you destroyed?  I hope it will be enough to drive them from the Tomb of Lights.

==Completion==
Out here in the wilds of [[Outland]] we are weak with few heroes to defend our rights, but you have given them something to fear <class>. &nbsp;I do not think the ethereals will soon forget the strong right arm of <name>.
