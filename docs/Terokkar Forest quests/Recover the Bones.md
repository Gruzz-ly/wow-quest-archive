Collect 10 Restless Bones. Deliver them to [[Ramdor the Mad]], just off the western side of the [[Ring of Observance]] in [[Auchindoun]], which is in the middle of the [[Bone Wastes]] of [[Terokkar Forest]]. 
*[[Restless Bones]]  (10)

== Description ==
The bones of the dead draenei litter the Bone Wastes from the explosion of Auchindoun. Their spirits are restless, and cannot move on to the next life.

&lt;class&gt;, you must help me to recover their bones and take them to their final resting place! Only then will they be at peace; only then will they know comfort.

Gather up the restless bones with care and deliver them to Ramdor the Mad at Auchindoun in the center of the Bone Wastes. Despite his name, he will know how to care for them. 

== Reward ==
You will receive:
{{cost|3|30|}}

== Completion ==

Great, just what I needed... more bones.

<Ramdor sighs.>

Yes, yes, I will see to it that these remains of our honored ancestors are given a proper burial, have no fear.

There is something else that you can do if you're truly interested in aiding the dead.

*11000[[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60|}} at level 70)

The Restless Bones look like small white glowing areas on the ground, scattered over the entire Bone Waste.
