==Objectives==
Kill 20 Bonelashers and then report to [[Mawg Grimshot]] at [[Stonebreaker Hold]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].
*[[Bonelasher]] slain (20)

==Description==
The bonelashers of the [[Bone Wastes]] bit Mawg and made him sick. Now he wants all of them destroyed!

While they can be found throughout the wastes, they are known to congregate at [[Carrion Hill]] in the north.

Return to Mawg Grimshot after you've done the deed and he'll give you a good reward.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3|30}}

==Progress==
Is that bonelasher blood on your hands that I smell?

==Completion==
You must have killed a lot of those bonelashers!  Good, I hate them!  Ever since I was bit by one of them, I keep having fainting spells.

Do you realize how embarrassing that is?  Here, take this as thanks for exacting some revenge for me.
