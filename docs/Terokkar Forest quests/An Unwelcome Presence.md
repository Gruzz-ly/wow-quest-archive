==Objectives==
Kill 12 Warped Peons and then report to [[Shadowstalker Kaide]].
*[[Warped Peon]] slain (12)

==Description==
Our forces at [[Thrallmar]] thought they had the fel orcs contained in the [[Hellfire Citadel]] area, but the recent arrivals at the ruins to the east say otherwise.

We can't permit them to gain a foothold here. [[Rokag]] has dispatched [[Shadowstalker Kaide]] to the ruins to keep an eye on them, but we have to do something to keep them from digging in.

Go to the ruins, decimate their peons, and then look for Kaide in the trees to the north. He'll tell you where to go from there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|90|}}
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
I was about to send a message back to Rokag recommending an attack, but I see that won't be necessary.

==Completion==
Stopping the fel orcs is going to take more than merely harassing their workers, I'm afraid. I've made a discovery that's shed some light on the reason for their presence here and it's reinforced my belief that we must act quickly.
