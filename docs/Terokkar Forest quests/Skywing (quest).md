'''Skywing''' is an escort quest. You must protect Skywing and escort him to the [[Emerald Signal Fire]] and defeat [[Luanga the Imprisoner]].

==Objectives==
Escort Skywing and report to [[Rilak the Redeemed]] in [[Shattrath City]].
*Escort [[Skywing]]
*Suggested Players [2]

==Description==
Skywing flutters around you.

You get the feeling he wants you to follow him.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Redeemer's Plate|Skywitch Hat|Stillfire Leggings}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|6|60}}
*13,750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|8|25}} at max level)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]
*[[Miniwing]]

==Completion==
Alas, poor Skywing was under the dreaded curse of [[Luanga the Imprisoner]]!

Skywing traveled to [[Veil Shalas]] to attempt to sway others in seeing the way of the Light. They didn't take lightly to his actions, especially sitting on the doorstep of Skettis.

Luanga was one of [[Terokk|Terokk's]] most feared agents. You have done well by freeing Skywing! I thank you.

==Notes==
Skywing's escort route will take you through three of the signal fires required for the quest [[Veil Shalas: Signal Fires]] in this order: Bloodstone, Violet then Emerald. At the Emerald Signal Fire, [[Luanga the Imprisoner]] will appear, who must be defeated before Skywing's curse is broken.

Be wary of the [[Shalassi Oracle]]s, as they have a [[Knock back]] ability which can easily knock you off the platforms,

Upon completing the escort quest, Skywing transforms into an [[Arakkoa]].
