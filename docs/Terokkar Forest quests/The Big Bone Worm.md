==Objectives==
[[Dwarfowitz]] at the [[Sha'tari Base Camp]] in the Bone Wastes wants you to recover Enormous Bone Worm Organs.

He wants his Fumper back too.
*[[Enormous Bone Worm Organs]]
*[[Fumper]] (provided)

==Description==
I was right! These carcasses you brought me belong to maturing worms. Do you know what that means? It means that somewhere out there is a big one! I think we can get it to come out if we can provide the right kind of food. Let's see... something big! Yes!

I remember seeing clefthooves east of here on the other side of the Bone Wastes. Get out there and kill a [[clefthoof]]. Once it's dead, use the drums. Hopefully the big one will come up to feed. If you manage to kill it, bring me its organs!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Dib'Muad's Crysknife|Revered Mother's Crysknife|Shani's Crysknife}}

You will also receive:
*1375 [[XP]] (or {{cost|8|25|}} at max level)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]

==Progress==
Take a friend with you!

==Completion==
Amazing! Look at this stuff! The thing-a-ma-whatever has some sort of dust inside its whatcha-ma-bobber. Bah! I won't bore you with all this scientific jargon. I did manage to pull a few teeth from the little ones to make these incredibly sharp knives. Want one?

==Notes and trivia==
The [[Clefthoof]]s to be used as bait for the Big Worm can be found near the Southeastern edge of the [[Bone Wastes]].

This quest, like the others in the chain, make references to Frank Herbert's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel) Dune] series of novels. The crysknives were made from the teeth of the [[Hai'shulud|giant sandworms]], and were prized by the Fremen who dwelt in the desert like sand gnomes do.  The three knives refer to three of the main characters in the novel: Paul "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muad%27Dib Muad'Dib]" Atredies, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Jessica Reverend Mother] Jessica Atredies, and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chani Chani]/Sihaya (mother of Paul's children).  All three lived as Fremen, so each would have their own knife.
