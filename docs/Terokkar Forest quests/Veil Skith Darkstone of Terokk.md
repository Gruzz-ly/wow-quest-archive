==Objectives==
Use the Rod of Purification on the Darkstone of Terokk in [[Veil Skith]] and return to [[Kirrik the Awakened|Kirrik]] at the [[Refugee Caravan]] in [[Bone Wastes]].
*Attempt to purify the [[Darkstone of Terokk]]
*[[Rod of Purification]] (provided)

==Description==
Veil Skith lies to the northwest of the caravan and to the south of [[Shattrath]] in a secluded grove of the forest. It is rumored that the colony of [[Skettis]] has constructed a maligned altar of worship. This Darkstone of Terokk must be purified if the [[arakkoa]] of Skith are ever to be redeemed.

Take this Rod of Purification and cast it upon the Darkstone. Blessed by [[A'dal]], the rod's purity might be enough to bring clarity to the Darkstone. Go now and may the light shine upon thee.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|10|}}
*10750 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]

==Progress==
Darkness surrounds us. What have you to say about Veil Skith?

==Completion==
I heard the explosion from here. Not with my ears, but with my heart.<BR>If the touch of the blessed [[Naaru]], A'dal, is not enough to bring the arakkoa to redemption, nothing will be. Those who have not given themselves over to the Light are mere servants of evil.

They must be destroyed.
