==Objectives==
* [[Arakkoa Feather]] (30)

==Rewards==
*[[Outcast's Cache]]

==Progress==
[[Skettis]]'s lapdogs still keeps a close watch over us, outcasts. The moment any of us sets foot outside Shattrath we'll be as good as dead.

Continue to bring me more feathers as proof of your victory over them.

==Completion==
<Vekax squawks in glee as you present him with proof of his enemies' demise.>

Yes, yes, continue to show Skettis that we outcasts will not take their punishment lying down. I can arrange for more, should you provide me with additional feathers.
