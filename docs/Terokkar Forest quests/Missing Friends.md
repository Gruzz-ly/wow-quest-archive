==Objectives==
Ethan wants you to find 12 of his missing friends in [[Veil Skith]] and then return to him at the [[Refugee Caravan]]. 

*Children Rescued (12)

==Description==
We broke down here because some guys came in the night and made a lot of noise. It was scary. I don't know when we are going to get moving again. 

Some of my friends are missing though. I don't know where they are. I think those scary bird men took them away to the northwest. They probably are all locked up in cages and stuff. If you find them that would be great. I'm kind of worried about them. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*10750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|16|}} at level 70)
*[[Battered Steam Tonk Controller]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]

==Progress==
I'm bored, there's nobody to play with. Have you found my friends?

==Completion==
You found all my friends! &nbsp;Now I have someone to play with. &nbsp;Thank you, Mister <name>. &nbsp;

Since I have kids to play with maybe you would like one of my toys? &nbsp;That way you have something to play with too.

==Notes==
Kill [[Skithian Dreadhawk]]s and [[Skithian Windripper]]s to loot {{item|Veil Skith Prison Key|s}}, then open [[Veil Skith Cage]]s with [[Captive Child]]ren.
