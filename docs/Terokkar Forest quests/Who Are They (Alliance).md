==Objectives==
While in disguise, speak with the Shadowy Initiate, the Shadowy Laborer and the Shadowy Advisor. Then return to [[Private Weeks]] at Grangol'var Village in [[Terokkar Forest]].
*[[Shadowy Initiate]] Spoken To
*[[Shadowy Laborer]] Spoken To
*[[Shadowy Advisor]] Spoken To

==Description==
I don't know who they are, but I know they're hostile!

I'm going to give you a disguise, and I want you to go in there and speak with three of them that I've observed as being 'chatty'. Talk with the initiate, the laborer, and the advisor.

Just watch out; there're a [[Shadowy Hunter|few hunters]] in there who'll be able to see through your disguise and they look tough! And whatever you do, don't leave the village—the disguise is kind of flimsy. If you lose your disguise, come back to me and I'll give you another.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|30|}}
*11000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60|}} at max level)

==Progress==
You speak with all of them yet?  What did they have to say?

==Completion==
Good, you finally made it back! &nbsp;Okay, what did you figure out? &nbsp;Who are they?

==Progression==
{{Kill the Shadow Council! (Alliance)}}
