== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Earthbinder Tavgren]] just outside the [[Cenarion Thicket]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].

== Description ==
<name>, after you're done celebrating here, I think that you should go back to the Cenarion Thicket and speak with [[Earthbinder Tavgren]].

I'm certain that he'll want to know what really happened out there.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Cenarion Thicket Circlet|Cenarion Thicket Helm|Cenarion Thicket Jerkin|Cenarion Thicket Legplates}}
You will also receive {{cost|8|70}}.

== Completion ==
A bomb utilizing pure mana that can take out whole towns!  But why?  Why would the blood elves create such a thing and use it on us?  The Cenarion Thicket was a place of peace and repose.

Whatever the reason, it must be locked inside the head of [[Warden Treelos]], and I have no idea how to cure him.  Perhaps his mind will heal in time?

Regardless, I want to thank you for helping me to figure out what happened.  I can only hope that this tragedy will never befall anyone else ever again!
