==Objectives==
Break the cursed eggs in Veil Lithic. Redeem 3 Hatchlings and slay 3 Malevolent Hatchlings before returning to Kirrik at the Refugee Caravan.
*Hatchlings Redeemed (3)
*[[Malevolent Hatchling]] slain (3)

==Description==
In the wretched colony to the southwest known as Veil Lithic, [[Terokk]]'s minions are attempting to befoul their avian brethren before they hatch. The dark sorcerers of Lithic encase eggs in a shadowy curse. When the hatchlings emerge, they mindlessly serve Terokk.

Travel to Veil Lithic and prematurely break the eggs before the curse has time to seep in. Even if you are too late, you can put down the tainted ones.

Remember, the Light shines brightest in the darkness.

==Reward==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox|Rewards

|Feathered Wrist Cuffs
|Eagle Engraved Bracers
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|10|}}
*10750[[XP]] (or {{cost|5|16|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]

==Progress==
Have you done your bidding? Quash the evil before it is too late!

==Completion==
It is grim work toiling with someone's hatchlings, yet ignoring the brewing evil would be a bleak proposition as well. You have done well. &nbsp;A'dal's favor shines upon your heart.
