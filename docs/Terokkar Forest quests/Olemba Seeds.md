==Objectives==
Gather 30 Olemba Seeds and return them to [[Ros'eleth]] in the [[Allerian Stronghold]].
*[[Olemba Seed]] (30)

==Description==
Aren't the trees in the forest beautiful?  I've often wondered if they would survive on [[Azeroth]].

I'm hesitant to send back seedlings, though.  It's a rough trip and they're much harder to transport than something like a sack of seeds.  The seeds are stored in tough cones that fall from the tree's branches once they've reached maturity.

If you come upon some of those cones in your travels, would you mind bringing some of the seeds back to me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|90|}}
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at max level)

==Progress==
I've started a seed collection, but I'm going to need some help before I have enough to send back to the [[park]] in [[Stormwind]].

==Completion==
Thank you for bringing these seeds.  I've almost got enough to send back the first batch!
