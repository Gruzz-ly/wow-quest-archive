==Objectives==
Use the Ceremonial Incens] near the candles in Malukaz's hut and observe the ceremony. When the ceremony is complete, speak with [[Malukaz]] again.
*Help Malukaz Summon the Wolf Spirit
*[[Ceremonial Incense]] (provided)

==Description==
I've nearly completed the vestments that I'll wear during the ceremony. As I add the finishing touches, I'd like you to set this incense by the candles near the runestone to my left.

I believe it will help us to attract the wolf spirit's attention, since it was made in the days of the orcish clans. I can almost imagine my ancestors using it in a ceremony paying tribute to the [[Lo'Gosh|wolf spirit]] after a successful hunt.

Once you've placed the incense, I'll begin the ceremony.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Helm of Lupine Cunning|Wolf Hunter's Guise|Helm of Lupine Grace|Helm of Lupine Ferocity
}}
You will also receive: 1100 [[XP]] (or {{cost||52|50}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Reestablishing ties with the wolf spirit is just the beginning of my journey, not the end.

==Completion==
This is incredible! I set out on this journey unsure of whether the wolf spirit would answer our summons and now it feels as though he's always been here. Perhaps he was, &lt;name&gt;.

Perhaps he was waiting for the orcs to realize what their choices had wrought.

==Notes==
The ceremony plays out as follows:

:''Malukaz dons his wolf-fur vestments.''
:{{text|say|Malukaz|Wolf spirit of the forest, hear me!}}
:{{text|say|Malukaz says|Long ago, you were a companion to my people. We gave ourselves to evil and you were forgotten.}}
:{{text|say|Malukaz|But we have returned, spirit! We have returned to honor you again. Favor us with your presence once more.}}
:{{text|emote|[[Terokkar Wolf Spirit]] howls in response to Malukaz's call.}}
:{{text|emote|Terokkar Wolf Spirit expresses its approval.}}
:{{text|say|Malukaz|May our bond with you never be broken again, spirit.}}
:{{text|say|Malukaz|We have done it! [[Thrall]] would be proud.}}
