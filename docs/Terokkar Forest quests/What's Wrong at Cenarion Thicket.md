You've done a lot for the [[Cenarion Expedition]].  Could you do one more thing for us?

==Objectives==
Speak with one of the [[druid]]s at the [[Cenarion Thicket]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].

==Description==
;Neutral
We haven't heard from the druids at the Cenarion Thicket of Terokkar Forest in quite some time.

<Name>, I'd like for you to go down there and check in with them to see what's happening. There are several ways to get there, but the fastest is to head south along the path, and then take the road that branches east from [[Shattrath City]] once you're in the forest.

;Alliance
<Class>, I have urgent business for you. We haven't heard from the druids of the Cenarion Thicket in quite some time. This is unusual as we usually hear from them at least once every few days.

I want you to go up there and make sure that they're alright. You can find the thicket by heading northwest through the forest.

;Horde
Hey there, <class>. We haven't heard from the druids of the Cenarion Thicket in quite some time.

I want you to go over there and check to see what's happening. You can find it by heading northwest through the forest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2600 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Completion==
I'm glad that the <[[Cenarion Refuge|refuge]]/[[Allerian Stronghold]]/[[Stonebreaker Hold]]> sent you. The druids of the thicket have been slain! Only myself and one other have survived, and he's insane.

I don't know what happened, but I intend to get to the bottom of it. Whatever it was, it happened quickly and feels unnatural.

Will you help me?
