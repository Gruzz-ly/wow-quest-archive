==Objectives==
Bring the Eye of Reskk and the Eye of Shienor to [[Rilak the Redeemed]] in the Lower City district of [[Shattrath]].
*[[Eye of Veil Reskk]]
*[[Eye of Veil Shienor]]

==Description==
Doom harkens from the cliffs of Skettis.

My people, the arakkoa, face a fate shrouded in unspeakable evil. Too often have we abused dark magic for wrongdoing. Through A'dal I have learned of the Light and of redemption.

Terokk watches his colonies from Skettis through orbs enchanted by the black art. Steal these Eyes from Veil Reskk and Veil Shienor in northern Terokkar. Let me see what Terokk sees. Let me look through the eyes of Skettis.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Super Healing Potion|Super Mana Potion}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|70|}}
*10050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]

==Progress==
You have returned, <class>. What news do you bring?

==Completion==
Your bravery should be commended. The guardians of Skettis do not part with their belongings willingly.

But heroics of the past are of little consequence now. We shall see if such bravery continues to persist in the future, for Terokk's gaze fixates on the south.

These Eyes are all seeing.
