==Objectives==
[[Lady Dena Kennedy]] wants you to seek out [[Rilak the Redeemed]] in [[Shattrath]] and find out what secrets he will share of the [[Arakkoa]].

==Description==
Out here on the frontier we have to deal with the [[arakkoa]] every day. They strike at us when they please, raiding our supply lines and killing our scouts.

Yet we know very little about these enigmatic creatures. I have received news that northwest of here in [[Shattrath City]] there are [[arakkoa]] who are not hostile. They might be willing to share the secrets of their race.

[[Rilak the Redeemed]] is their leader. He resides in the northern part of the [[Lower City]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*10400 [[XP]]
*{{cost|g=2|s=30}}
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]

==Completion==
You are wise to find me. There is much that I can show you.
