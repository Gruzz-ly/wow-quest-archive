Ethereals.  And you thought Goblins were amoral!

Still, he's got Pax Shattrath protecting him, so it looks like we've got to do things the hard way...

This quest is part of {{questchain|The Terokkar Mana Bomb}} quest chain.

== Objective ==
Retrieve 5 of Lathrai's Stolen Goods. Return them to [[Wind Trader Lathrai]] near the [[World's End Tavern]] in the [[Lower City]] section of [[Shattrath City]].
*[[Lathrai's Stolen Goods]] (5)

== Description ==
Hmmm? A box you say? Or was it several? Do you know what material the box was constructed from?

And what was the name of this merchant? [[Empoor]]? Are you certain that he's one of the Broken? I don't do much business with their kind.

Perhaps my memory would be jogged if you were to do me a favor?

The Skithian [[arakkoa]] - primitive casters that they are - recently stole a huge shipment of my more exotic goods. I want it all back!

You can find [[Veil Skith]] just to the south of Shattrath City.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*10750 [[XP]]
*{{cost|3|10}}
{{itembox|You may choose one of the following:|Consortium Cloak of the Quick|Nexus-Stalker's Band|Ethereal Healing Pendant|Arakkoa Divining Rod}}

== Progress ==
Hmm, is my memory improving?

== Completion ==
Yes, indeed, I do believe that it's all getting clearer now.

And I think that your diligence in this matter deserves more than just the information that you seek.
