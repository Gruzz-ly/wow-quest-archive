Bring me more feathers as proof of your victory over them.

Skettis's lapdogs still keeps a close watch over us, outcasts. The moment any of us sets foot outside Shattrath we'll be as good as dead.

You will receive:

== Completion ==
<Vekax squawks in glee as you present him with proof of his enemies' demise.>

Yes, that will show Skettis that we Outcasts will not take their punishment lying down. Here is the reward I promised you. I can arrange for more, should you provide me with additional feathers.
