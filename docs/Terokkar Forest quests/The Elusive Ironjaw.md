==Objectives==
Bring Ironjaw's Pelt to [[Bertelm]] at the [[Allerian Stronghold]].
*[[Ironjaw's Pelt]]

==Description==
Now that I have the fur I'll need for the trim, I've been thinking that the pelt of a particular wolf would make a good hood for my cloak. Imagine seeing your enemy clad in the pelt of the most cunning predator in the forest!

I've tried trapping old Ironjaw without success. I've tried cornering him, outsmarting him, and baiting him. None of it has worked.

He stalks the northeastern reaches of the forest, and I'd gladly reward you if you could succeed where I have failed.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Helm of Lupine Cunning|Wolf Hunter's Guise|Helm of Lupine Grace|Helm of Lupine Ferocity}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|10|}}
*13350 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|42|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Has old Ironjaw gotten the better of you, too, friend? Or have you managed to outsmart the old fellow?

==Completion==
I bow to your skills, <name>. You have proven yourself the superior hunter.

I won't forget your help in making this cloak. It will truly be a one-of-a-kind piece and I'll wear it proudly.
