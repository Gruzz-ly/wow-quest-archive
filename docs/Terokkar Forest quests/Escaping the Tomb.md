==Objectives==
Help [[Akuno]] find his way to the [[Refugee Caravan]] in [[Terokkar Forest]]. Speak to [[Mekeda]] after you've completed this quest.

==Description==
I appreciate your help, <name>. I was certain I was going to be killed.

Let's get out of here with a hurry. It won't be long before more [[Cabal|cultists]] come after us.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Akuno's Blade]]
*[[Ancient Draenei Crest]]
*[[Mekeda's Gift]]
*[[Unearthed Orb]]

You will also receive:
*10750 [[XP]]
*{{cost|g=5|s=16}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]

==Progress==
Yes, <name>?

==Completion==
You rescued [[Akuno]], a dear friend of mine. For this I am in your debt, <name>.

==Notes==
This quest may be difficult to complete due to the very fast respawn rate of [[Shadow Tomb]] mobs.  Also note that Akuno has a very fast health regeneration rate when not in combat, but he cannot be healed or buffed, so all mobs that attack him must be taken down quickly.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
