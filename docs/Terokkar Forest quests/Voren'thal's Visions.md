==Objectives==
Bring 8 Dampscale Basilisk Eyes to [[Arcanist Adyria]] in [[Shattrath City]].
Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.
*[[Dampscale Basilisk Eye]] (8)

==Description==
Our leader, [[Voren'thal the Seer]], was once a close advisor to Kael'thas. His prophetic visions warned him that Kael's path would lead to the destruction of our race.

The visions are usually vague and unfocused, but our alchemists have devised an elixir to help him focus his clairvoyance. Unfortunately, this elixir calls for a rare ingredient: basilisk eyes. My usual source, this pathetic ethereal, has failed me.

Seek the dampscale basilisks in the rocky regions of Terokkar and bring me their eyes.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*11000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60|}} at level 70)
*-275 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*+250 reputation with [[The Scryers]]

==Progress==
Have you obtained the basilisk eyes for Voren'thal's elixir?

==Completion==
These are all in excellent state, <name>. &nbsp;Carry on and you will soon count the Scryers as your friends.

==Notes==
Repeatable up to Neutral [[reputation]] with [[The Scryers]].
