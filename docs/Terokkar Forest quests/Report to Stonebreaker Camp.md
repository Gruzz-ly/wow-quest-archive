You were the one to find the box of parts, it is only right that you carry word to someone who will know how to act on the information...

This quest is part of {{questchain|The Terokkar Mana Bomb}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
[[Tooki]] wants you to report to [[Sergeant Chawni]] at [[Stonebreaker Camp]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].

==Description==
This calls for immediate action!

We have someone out in the field closer to Firewing Point that I want you to speak with. She'll have a better idea of what our next step should be.

Report to Sergeant Chawni out at Stonebreaker Camp and apprise her of the situation.

Take the road north out of the hold. From the middle of Tuurem, follow the road to the east. You'll find the camp on the bank of the river that lies just southwest of [[Firewing Point]].

Good luck, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Bomb parts. So my suspicions were true. That's not something that I wanted to be right about.

Ok, you and I have some grim business ahead of us then.

==Notes==
Since this is the first time that YOU have been to visit Sergeant Chawni, he must have been looking into the situation beforehand.
