==Objectives==
[[Scout Navrin]] wants you to travel to the [[Netherweb Ridge]] and free 6 Webbed Sha'tar Warriors and then return to him at [[Sha'tari Base Camp]].
* [[Freed Sha'tar Warrior|Sha'tar Warrior Freed]] (6)

==Description==
Our small outpost is under constant attack. Several nights ago, we were raided by the spiders of Netherweb Ridge, on the southeastern edge of the [[Bone Wastes]]. They poisoned many of our people, wrapped them in webs and carried them away. Some of our [[warrior]]s took up arms and with little preparation pursued the spiders.

We have not seen the captives or our hunting parties since. We hope that some may still be alive, perhaps imprisoned by the [[spider]]s. Our numbers are few. Will you search for our people?

Our small outpost is under constant attack. Several nights ago the spiders of the Netherweb Ridge raided our camp. They poisoned many of our people, wrapped them in their webs and carried them away. Some of our warriors took up arms and with little preparation pursued the spiders into the night.

We have not seen the captives or our hunting parties in several days. We hope that some may still be alive, perhaps imprisoned by the spiders. Our numbers are few. Will you search for our people?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|40|}}
* 9,720 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with the [[Sha'tar]]

==Progress==
Did you find our missing people?

==Completion==
You saved so many.  I didn't think we would ever see them again.  We cannot thank you enough, <name>.

==Notes==
This quest combines well with [[For the Fallen]].

- A helpful tip I used here is to weave your way through the wooded area dealing with the spiders as they get close and using a ranged attack to pop the webbed pods. This way you don't have to fight the adds that come out. The rate of which I found the Shatari was very low and after a while the adds became more of a hassle than the spiders. The ranged attack allowed me to pop the webbed pod but not aggro the add inside.
