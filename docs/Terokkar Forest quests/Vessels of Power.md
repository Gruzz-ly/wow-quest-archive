==Objectives==
Bring 8 [[Draenei]] Vessels to [[Ros'eleth]] at the [[Allerian Stronghold]].
*[[Draenei Vessel]] (8)

==Description==
Amid the ruins of [[Tuurem]] are a number of vessels containing raw, magical energy. We are fortunate that the [[Broken]] who have overrun the city are ignorant to the resource in their midst, but we cannot assume they will remain so forever.

With those vessels and their power in hand, the scattered survivors of my people can resist the lure of demonic magic. Every [[quel'dorei]] we can save from our prince's folly is one more that can help us regain our lost glory. Bring me these vessels, <class>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|90}}
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75}} at max level)

==Progress==
Were you able to find any intact vessels?

==Completion==
I hope these aren't the only intact vessels in the city. This is a good start, but I suspect we'll need many more than this.

==Notes==
A failed Draenei Vessel will cause an area-of-effect (AOE) explosion. This explosion will remove any crowd-control (CC) on any targets within range. Confirmed with Sap.

==Progression==
#[[Olemba Seeds]]
#[[Vessels of Power]]
