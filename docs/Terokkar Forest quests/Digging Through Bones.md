==Objectives==
Escort Letoll and his crew and protect them while they make their dig. Return to [[Dwarfowitz]] at the [[Sha'tari Base Camp|Sha'tari Outpost]] if you succeed.
*Protect the Explorers

==Description==
Oy! You look like you can take care of yerself, <race>. Me and the crew here are looking for a bodyguard to watch over us while we hit a dig site to the north. The pay is pretty good and all you gotta do is make sure no nasty creatures kill me or any of my employees.

If you successfully make it back without any casualties, Dwarfowitz over there will pay ya.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*11000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]

==Progress==
You get paid when the job is done, sonny.

==Completion==
A bone wurm! Fantastic! This may actually be the first time in recorded history that Letoll has actually made a discovery.

==Notes==
During this quest, the [[Explorer's League Researcher]]s make jokes about [[Chief Archaeologist Letoll]]'s previous attempts at archaeological discovery. These include:
*{{text|say|Explorer's League Researcher|This reminds me of that one time where you made us search [[Silithus]] for evidence of [[sand gnome]]s.}}
*{{text|say|Explorer's League Researcher|Or that time when you told us that you'd discovered the cure for the plague of the 20th century. What is that even? 20th century?}}
*{{text|say|Explorer's League Researcher|I don't think it can top the one time where he told us that he'd heard that [[Arthas Menethil|Arthas]]'s "cousin's" skeleton was frozen beneath a glacier in [[Winterspring]]. I'll never forgive you for that one, Letoll. I mean honestly... Arthas's cousin?}}
*{{text|say|Explorer's League Researcher|I dunno. It can't possibly beat the time he tried to convince us that we're all actually a figment of some being's imagination and that they only use us for their own personal amusement. That went over well during dinner with the family.}}
*{{Text|say|Explorer's League Researcher|Wow... a drum.}}
*{{Text|say|Explorer's League Researcher|Yea, great. Can we leave now? This desert is giving me hives.}}
*{{Text|say|Explorer's League Researcher|This discovery will surely rock the foundation of modern archaeology.}}
*{{Text|say|Explorer's League Researcher|Say, do you guys hear that?}}

A [[Bone Sifter]] will appear after the dwarves are done digging.
