This quest is part of {{questchain|The Terokkar Mana Bomb}} quest chain.

[[Empoor]] is just the delivery boy, and you've already [[By Any Means Necessary|roughed him up]] to question him. But we have another lead.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Wind Trader Lathrai]] near the [[World's End Tavern]] in the [[Lower City]] section of [[Shattrath City]].

==Description==
I was asked to pick up and deliver some boxes of goods from an [[ethereal]] in Shattrath City.

Last I saw him, he was standing outside of the World's End Tavern in Lower City. His name is Wind Trader Lathrai, and that's all that I know!

Want more answers, go talk with him!
