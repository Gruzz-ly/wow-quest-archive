==Objectives==
Find and speak with [[Ezekiel]] of Shattrath in [[Shattrath City]].

==Description==
I believe that the dead, which we have been caring for these last 500 odd years, should be left alone. [[Maladaar]] has other plans. He has retreated to the [[Crypt of Remembrance (Auchindoun)|Crypt of Remembrance]] to start his experiments... Necromancy.

I hope you weren't thinking about going in there... Not before helping me out so that these damned spirits will finally leave me alone. I know where they keep their treasures, <race>. Got your attention, eh?

Bring me the book of the dead, held by the Aldor, Ezekiel of Shattrath.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[The Sha'tar]]

==Completion==
Book of the dead? Never heard of it... What's this about anyway? Who sent you?

==Notes==
Ezekiel is a wandering NPC in Shattrath City. You can find him wandering just outside the [[Scryers]] tower to the north side of the bridge.

==Progression==
