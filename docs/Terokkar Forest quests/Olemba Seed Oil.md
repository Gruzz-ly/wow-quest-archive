==Objectives==
Bring 30 Olemba Seeds to [[Rakoria]] in [[Stonebreaker Hold]]. 
*[[Olemba Seed]] (30)

==Description==
The oily seeds from the forest's [[olemba tree]]s could prove very valuable. I'd like to gather a larger quantity of them, press them for their oil, and then see what I can do with it.

Just think, there's a whole forest full of trees out there, producing a lot of seeds that go to waste. I don't care if it turns out to be cooking oil, lamp oil, or weapon oil, I won't let it go to waste!

Bring me any of the seeds that you happen to gather from the olemba cones. They're all over the place.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|90}}
*10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Do you have any seeds for me? 

==Completion==
That's a good start, but we're going to need more than that if we're to press a respectable amount of oil!
