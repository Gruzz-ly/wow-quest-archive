'''By Any Means Necessary''' is part of the {{questchain|The Terokkar Mana Bomb}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Find and convince [[Empoor]] to tell you what he knows.

==Description==
I don't know what to make of all of this, but I do know how we can find more clues.

[[Empoor]] is a [[Broken]] merchant that traffics in all sorts of goods and information. If you were to persuade him to talk, I'm sure he might have something interesting to say.

He travels the road here between [[Tuurem]] and [[Shattrath City|Shattrath]]. Watch out, though -- he travels with a bodyguard.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*10400 XP
*{{cost|3|75}}

==Completion==
Fine, fine... I'll tell you what I know, but it's not much!

==Notes==
You talk to [[Empoor]], then he and his bodyguard attack you.  You have to get Empoor down to 20-30% health, at which point they both stop attacking.  Then you can conclude the quest.

;Dialogue with Empoor
Very busy... very busy! What?

;Dialogue after combat
Now that I've been beaten to within an inch of my life what do you want?
