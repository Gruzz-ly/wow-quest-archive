==Objectives==
[[The Bone Witch]] at [[Njorndar Village]] wants you to return with Iskalder.
* [[Iskalder]] delivered to The Bone Witch

==Description==
Quickly, <name>, head southwest to the [[Halls of the Ancestors]]!

Within you will find [[Slumbering Mjordin|slumbering mjordin]]. Wake them until you find Iskalder. When you do, use this amulet upon him and bring him back to me.

Now go. There is no time to waste! 
* [[The Bone Witch's Amulet]] (provided)

==Progress==
Where is the ancient hero?

We do not have time to chat. Go to the Halls of the Ancestors to find him before it is too late!

==Completion==
He's a fine specimen and will serve us well.

Now, we have to make sure to use him properly trap Vardmadra!

==Notes==
Keep waking mjordin until Iskalder wakes up.  It may take some time.  Enter the Hall of Ancestors at the 28,47 entrance; if you enter at the 24,53 entrance, bringing Iskalder back will be much more difficult, and you may lose him and have to start over.
