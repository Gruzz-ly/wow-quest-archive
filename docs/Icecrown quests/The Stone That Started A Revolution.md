==Objectives==
[[Crusade Architect Silas]] at the [[Valley of Echoes]] in [[Icecrown]] wants you to retrieve 10 Trunks of Crystalline Heartwood and 10 pieces of Ancient Elven Masonry.
*[[Crystalline Heartwood]] (10)
*[[Ancient Elven Masonry]] (10)

==Description==
You may look at [[Scourgeholme]] now and see a rancid pit of decay, but one day it will be a place of glory and honor. [[Tirion Fordring|Highlord Fordring]] has deemed it "Justice Keep."

Alas, even an impregnable fortress like [[Icecrown Citadel]] began with but a single stone. So begins our search for the stone to start a revolution.

Travel to [[Crystalsong Forest|Crystalsong]], south of here, and seek out the [[Unbound Thicket]] in the east. Once there gather crystalline heartwood from the thicket floor and elven masonry from the [[Ruins of Shandaral]].

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

You will also receive:
*21,800 [[XP]]
*+325 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Progress==
Are you lost?

==Completion==
Heartwood by nature is resistant to disease, rot and plague. This heartwood, goes so far as to repel such things! The masonry, affected by the fallout of the Unbound Thicket, will work in much the same way.

Soon we will break ground.

==Notes==
Do this quest alongside [[It Could Kill Us All]]

Heartwood litters the ground everywhere in the thicket. The masonry is blue and is only in the areas in and around the ruins.
