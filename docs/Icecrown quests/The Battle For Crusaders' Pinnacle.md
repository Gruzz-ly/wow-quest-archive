==Objectives==
Venture to [[Crusaders' Pinnacle]] and use the [[Blessed Banner of the Crusade]] atop the [[Pile of Crusader Skulls (Icecrown)|Pile of Crusader Skulls]]. Defend the banner against [[Scourge]] attack until the land atop the pinnacle is sanctified and then return to [[Father Gustav]] at the [[Valley of Echoes]] in [[Icecrown]].
* Battle for Crusaders' Pinnacle

==Description==
<[[Tirion Fordring|Highlord Fordring]] holds a banner of the [[Argent Crusade]].>

This banner is like no other, <name>. It carries with it a powerful blessing, able to sanctify large tracts of blighted land.

You must take it northwest, through the [[Breach (Icecrown)|Breach]], to an area the Scourge have mockingly named Crusaders' Pinnacle. Plant the banner atop the skulls of our fallen brethren at Crusaders' Pinnacle and defend it against attack. Once the land is sanctified, return to Father Gustav.

Go now, <name>. Hold no fear in your heart. 
* [[Blessed Banner of the Crusade]] (provided)
==Progress==
Have we broken ground?

==Completion==
Blessed Light! We have taken the pinnacle! Finally, construction of Justice Keep can begin. Highlord Fordring and the knights are already en route to our new base. You must meet them there, <name>!

==Notes==
The [[Pile of Crusader Skulls (Icecrown)|Pile of Crusader Skulls]] is at the entrance of the Crusader's Pinnacle to the northeast at {{coords|80.1|72.0|Icecrown}}. Look for a glowing green pillar of light next to a Scourge tent and banner atop the hill.

While near the banner, players are significantly buffed ('''Blessing of the Crusade''': Your power versus the Scourge is significantly increased! Mana and health regeneration increased while stranding and defending the banner.).  The buff will give an almost-invincible amount of health regeneration, although it is still possible to die if you pull aggro on too many attackers at once and you don't overgear the encounter.  [[Crusader Lord Dalfors]] spawn to assist along with three [[Argent Battle-priest]]s, and accompanied by three [[Argent Mason]]s with torches.

Waves of scourge approach to unseat the banner.  First [[Scourge Drudge]]s, then [[Reanimated Captain]]s and [[Hideous Plaguebringer]].  Eventually, [[Halof the Deathbringer]] arrives.  Slaying him ends the attacks.

Concluding this quest and returning to [[Crusaders' Pinnacle]] changes the phase of the Crusaders' Pinnacle region to the completed [[Justice Keep]].
