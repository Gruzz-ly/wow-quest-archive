==Objectives==
Mount and take control of [[Nergeld]].  Defend it from the denizens of the [[Hall of Horrors]] until Dr. Terrible shows himself.

Use Nergeld to slay the doctor, and then return to [[The Bone Witch]] in [[Njorndar Village]].
* [[Dr. Terrible]] slain

==Description==
Opening the tome, you notice all manner of disgusting illustrations concerning the construction of what the doctor refers to as "the ultimate weapon"!

Clearly the prototype, Nergeld, is the massive [[flesh giant]] standing still at the end of the nearby Hall of Horrors.

If an army of those things were to be constructed, then it would mean doom.  The only way to ensure that doesn't happen is to slay Dr. Terrible!

Perhaps if you were to take control of the construct, the doctor would reveal himself?

==Progress==
You recovered the doctor's tome, but you didn't finish him off using the flesh giant?

Get back in there and kill him before it's too late!

==Completion==
You discovered and put an end to the doctor's machinations.

<The [[banshee]]-controlled witch smiles and places a large hand gently upon your shoulder.

That's a fine poke in the eye for the [[Lich King]], but I think we can do better.

==Notes==
After killing Osterkilgr, take a left and mount the flesh giant. #1 is melee attack on a single target, #2 is AoE knockback and dmg, #3 is ground stomp (AoE dmg), and #4 is single-target pull.  Don't waste your energy using #1 on the group mobs; use 2 and 3 on them, keeping them away and killing them until Dr. Terrible appears.  As soon as the good doctor spawns, use #1 on him, knocking all of the other enemies away with #2.  As soon as the doctor is defeated, the rest of the room will despawn.

When the doctor reaches 35% health, he will begin to cast a 4 second heal. He will do this regularly, so make sure to save your interrupts for the heal.
