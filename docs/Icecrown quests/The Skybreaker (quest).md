==Objectives==
Seek out [[High Captain Justin Bartlett]] aboard the ''[[Skybreaker]]'' flying above [[Icecrown]]. 

==Description==
We were neck deep in [[Scourge]] and [[Horde]]. The screams of the dying covered that field. It was torturous... unrelenting!

At some point my body gave out. I fell, only to be awoken by the [[Argent Crusade]]. They pulled me out of the [[Broken Front]] and brought me here. I'm not going to make it. Grant a dying soldier one last wish, <race>? Our base, the ''Skybreaker'', flies high above Icecrown. It is there that you'll find my commanding officer, High Captain Bartlett. Tell him that I died a soldier of the [[Alliance]]. 

==Completion==
<Captain Bartlett salutes.>

He was a damn fine soldier. Damn the Horde and damn the Scourge!

==Notes==
After players complete [[The Crusaders' Pinnacle]] Ivalius (inside the nearby keep) will offer this quest.
