==Objectives==
Return to [[Crusader Bridenbrad]] at the [[Silent Vigil]] in [[Icecrown]]. 

==Description==
I am pleased that you have come to me, <name>. I know of Crusader Bridenbrad, and of your travels in hope of saving him. Bridenbrad's valor has sparked remarkable selflessness in you, and this is a miracle unto itself.

The [[Light]] will take care of its own. I will extend my blessing to Bridenbrad and he shall not endure the corruption of [[undeath]]. I shall return you to [[Dalaran]], and you shall return to him. Know that I remain with you.

==Completion==
<As you approach Crusader Bridenbrad, you cannot help but notice that his skin has taken on a pale hue and his breaths are shallow. It is clear that he has little time left.>

You have returned to me, <class>. I must admit... it is good to see you again... your face renews my hope that this land will be free of [[Lich King|Arthas]]'s grasp one day soon. I'm proud to have met you...

<Bridenbrad's words trail off, a dim smile on his face. As life seems to slip from him, a gentle ringing fills your ears.>

==Notes==
Accepting the quest will instantly teleport the player to Dalaran.

After completing the quest, [[A'dal]] along with [[K'uri]] and [[M'ori]] appears and liberates the [[Spirit of Bridenbrad]], so that he will not be raised as a mindless servant of the [[Scourge]].

:{{text|say|A'dal says: In life, Bridenbrad was the bearer of great deeds. Now, in passing, he shall taste only paradise.}}

[[Bridenbrad's Possessions]] appear at the campfire, and offer the followup.
