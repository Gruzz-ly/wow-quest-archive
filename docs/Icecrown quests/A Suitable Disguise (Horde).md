This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

== Objectives ==
Obtain a [[:Borrowed Tabard]] from [[Shandy Glossgleam]].
* [[Borrowed Tabard]]

== Description ==
Getting you inside the [[Silver Enclave]] will be tougher than it appears. Only those who possess [[Silver Covenant]] tabards are permitted entry to sanctuary. If we can get our hands on one, a simple enchantment will do the rest of the work.

On the balcony above [[Threads of Fate]], you'll find [[Shandy Glossgleam]]. I've helped him a few times in the past, so he owes me a favor. He handles laundry for a wide variety of people in the city. Maybe he can find a way to 'lend' you a tabard for a while.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|20|63}}

== Progress ==
Was Shandy able to help you get a Silver Covenant tabard?

== Completion ==
I knew Shandy would find a way to make it work. Let me get this enchanted and ready for you to use. With any luck, the tabard's owner won't even know it's missing and Shandy will cover the rest of our tracks.

==Notes==
The [[Threads of Fate]] is directly opposite the [[Silver Enclave]] in [[Runeweaver Square]]. On the upstairs balcony is [[Shandy Glossgleam]]:
:{{gossip|Arcanist Hathorel said you might be able to lend me a certain tabard.}}
:{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|You're in luck. I've got just what you need in the load I'm about to wash.}}
:{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|See the piles of laundry and the bucket of water? I'll call out what I need next, and you put it in the tub. Ready?}}

Did you sign up for [[Lab Work]]? He'll call out one of four items:
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|Quick, add some shirts to the laundry!}}
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|Add the unmentionables... uh, I mean, the 'delicates'!}}
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|The tub needs more water!}}
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|Toss some pants in to the tub!}}

And one of a few random responses:
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|I should keep you around.}}
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|Well done!}}
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|That's how it's done!}}
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|Clean and tidy!}}
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|Nice. I don't want to know what the stain was.}}
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|Aquanos can hardly keep up!}}

When he's finally done, the [[Clean Laundry]] spawns next to the tub.
:{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|[[Aquanos]], stop sending the clothes so high! You didn't have to see the look on [[Aethas Sunreaver|Aethas Sunreaver's]] face when he found his pants in the fountain!}}
:{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|See how easy that was with everyone working together? Just take what you need from the clean laundry here, but don't forget to return it when you're finished.}}
