==Objectives==
[[Alexstrasza the Life-Binder]] at [[Wyrmrest Temple]] has requested that you recover Dahlia's Tears from soil freshly cleansed by a [[Ruby Keeper (Dragonblight)|Ruby Keeper]]'s flames.
* [[Dahlia's Tears]]

==Description==
In this dark time, I'll not be the one to abandon a champion of the [[Light]].

We will need something sacred for this to have a hope of saving your [[Crusader Bridenbrad|Bridenbrad]]... a remnant of a [[Dahlia Suntouch|devout being]] that [[Through Fields of Flame|fell victim]] to this very same [[Plague of Undeath|plague]].

Go now to the sacred soil of the passages outside my [[Ruby Dragonshrine]] where the battle is joined. As my [[Ruby Keeper (Dragonblight)|Ruby Keeper]]s fly down and set flame to the ground beneath undead feet, you will witness new life grow forth. Among that life are Dahlia's Tears - bring them to me.

==Progress==
Ah, dear [[Dahlia Suntouch|Dahlia]]. I do miss you so.

==Completion==
With Dahlia's Tears and ancient magic, I fashion you some small amount of hope for your great crusader.

==Progression==
