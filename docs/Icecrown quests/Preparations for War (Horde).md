==Objectives==
Speak to [[Sky-Reaver Klum]] to secure passage to [[Orgrim's Hammer]] in [[Icecrown]], and then report to [[Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar]].

==Description==
You there!

You look like you have some wits about you. We could use some more able bodies in [[Icecrown]].

The [[Alliance]] scum rushed into [[Icecrown]] ahead of us, unprepared, and got just what they deserved for their impatience. We took our time, we made ready, and soon we will mount a true assault from one of the most advanced pieces of [[engineering]] known to [[Azeroth]] - [[Orgrim's Hammer]]. The [[Alliance]] don't stand a chance, and neither does [[Arthas]].

Speak to me when you're ready to depart and lend a hand.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|1|90}}
*5500 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|3|30}} at max level)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Completion==
Welcome to [[Orgrim's Hammer]].

From here we are laying our groundwork for the assault on [[Arthas]]. There's a lot of preparation to be done, but before we can get into the real meat of it, we want to make sure that the [[Argent Crusade]] is adequately reinforced - we're going to need their help later.

If you have not already, speak to [[Brother Keltan]] on the main deck.

==Notes==
Talk to [[Sky-Reaver Klum]] to get to the airship.

:{{gossip|Take me to the ship.}}

The player is mounted on the [[Hammerhead]].
