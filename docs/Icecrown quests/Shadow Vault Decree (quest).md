== Objectives ==
[[Duke Lankral]] at [[Shadow Vault (Icecrown)|The Shadow Vault]] has ordered you to read the [[Shadow Vault Decree]] in the presence of [[Thane Ufrang the Mighty]], and then to slay him.
* [[Thane Ufrang the Mighty]] slain

== Description ==
Thane Ufrang the Mighty sits within [[Ufrang's Hall|his hall]] overlooking the [[Savage Ledge]]. I've studied him. The thane is a patient [[vrykul]], with a head for strategy and warfare. He's also shown a penchant for biding his time and not wanting to overplay his hand in the ongoing battle.

I need him dead!

I've written a decree. Stand before the thane and read it aloud.

<The duke arches his eyebrow in amusement.>

It should... unnerve him at the least. 

* [[Shadow Vault Decree]] (provided)

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Duke Lankral's Velvet Slippers
|Vest of Jotunheim
|Thane's Restraints
|Blackened Breastplate of the Vault}}

== Progress ==
My scouts inform me that Ufrang yet lives.

Do you not know how to read, <race>?

== Completion ==
<Duke Lankral nods his approval at your report of success.>

We face a foe that dwarfs us, not only in stature, but also numerically. If we are to win the battle for [[Icecrown]], we must outthink them!

With Ufrang dead, that gives us an advantage in [[Jotunheim]]. Let us see if we can capitalize it.

== Notes ==
Before aggroing the Duke, pick up [[Get the Key]] from [[Vaelen the Flayed]] in the hall.

Use the decree when in front of the Thane, which will turn him hostile.
