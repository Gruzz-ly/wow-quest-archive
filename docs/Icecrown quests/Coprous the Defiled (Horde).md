== Objectives ==
[[Koltira Deathweaver]] aboard [[Orgrim's Hammer]] wants you to kill [[Coprous the Defiled]] at [[Mord'rethar: The Death Gate|Mord'rethar]].
* [[Coprous the Defiled]] Defeated
* Suggested Players [5]

== Description ==
Reports of a powerful zombie at the death gate have reached my ears, <class>.

We cannot allow a potential threat such as this to go unchallenged. Any information you are able to glean from engaging it will be better than what we know now.

Go to the western chamber of the gate and find this creature. Fight him, and find a weakness we might exploit. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|14|80}}

== Completion ==
You have done well, <class>.

When our armies arrive to march on the [[Icecrown Citadel|Citadel]], we will have a solid plan in place for taking the death gate.

== Notes ==
Coprous can be found in the western building of Mord'rethar at {{coords|61.8|62.1|Icecrown}}

==Progression==
{{Mord'rethar: The Death Gate (Horde)}}
