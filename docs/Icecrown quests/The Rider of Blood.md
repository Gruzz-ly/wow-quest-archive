==Objectives==
[[Vereth the Cunning]] on the [[Rise of Suffering]] wants you to kill Baelok, the Rider of Blood.
* [[Baelok]] slain
Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
Baelok is one of the few [[vrykul]] that I've ever seen rise through the ranks, and that was mostly accomplished through shear brutality. If your competition ends up dead, there's far less to compete against.

When you join battle with him, spread out from your companions and keep your distance as much as you reasonably can. He will not hesitate to steal your life force for himself, so you will need to hinder his ability to do so as much as possible.

You have my confidence. See to it that he dies. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Blood-forged Circle|Grotesque Butcher's Pants|Blood-stalker's Cover|Breastplate of Splattered Blood}}

==Progress==
Is he dead?

==Completion==
So he finally lost? Good to hear.

==Notes==
Baelok can be found near one of the forges on the ground level of Malykriss at {{coords|59.1|71.4|Icecrown}}

:Baelok yells: Don't stop now, I've almost broken a sweat.
:Baelok yells: I know no death. I will... be back... for you...

You can solo this quest as a Death Knight by popping Army of Dead and spamming Death and Decay and Blood Boil.  Make sure you keep him in the Death and Decay for the fight and you should walk away victorious.  Army of Dead should hold aggro on him until just under 50% of his health then it's just a race to the death for you.  Raise Dead helps here also for more dps on him.  (I had 25K health vs his 125K health when I beat him).
