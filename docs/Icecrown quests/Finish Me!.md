==Objectives==
A Dying Soldier in the Broken Front wants you to kill 5 Dying Soldiers and report to [[High Captain Justin Bartlett]] on the ''[[Skybreaker]]''.
* [[Dying Soldier]]s Slain (5)

==Description==
They taunt us - even as they lie dying here...

Please, <brother/miss>... Don't allow their mocking to be the last sounds I hear...

Finish me... deliver me from this torment... into... the [[Light]].

Seek out my companions... offer them the same mercy.

Leave nothing for the [[scourge]] to raise!

I beg you... 

==Progress==
What is it, <class>?

==Completion==
That was a difficult thing you did, <class>. But it was the right thing.

Don't allow the memory of your actions to haunt you. Harness that sorrow and pain you feel! Direct it at those who caused it.

The [[Horde]] must pay!

== Notes ==
Curiously, the [[Avenge Me!|equivalent Horde quest]] '''also''' has you kill dying soldiers (not [[Dying Berserker]]s).  While this accomplishes the same goal at this quest, it shows the differing drives of the factions.

Dying soldier comments:
:Tell my family...

:My last thoughts were of them...
