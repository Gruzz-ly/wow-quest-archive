==Objectives==
Capture 6 ''[[Orgrim's Hammer]]'' Dispatches from [[Orgrim's Hammer Scout]]s and bring them to [[High Captain Justin Bartlett]] aboard the ''[[Skybreaker]]''.
* [[Orgrim's Hammer Dispatch]]: (6)
* [[Dart Gun]] (provided)

==Description==
Despite our efforts, the [[Horde]] continues to send scouts to the area of the [[Icecrown Glacier]], to the west of the [[Ironwall Rampart]] and [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]].

We can't afford to let the Horde gain the upper hand with this scouting operation. Take the dart gun with you again and show the Orgrim's Hammer scouts no mercy! Bring the captured dispatches to me.

The Horde's wasted efforts will be our gain. 

==Progress==
Have you intercepted those dispatches?

==Completion==
<The high captain accepts the dispatches.>

This is just what we need. Not even the Horde is so stupid as to charge in blindly against the Scourge. With their reports in hand, we'll be well prepared.

==Notes==
West of Ymirheim, north of the elite frost wyrms, south of the rampart.
