This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

== Objectives ==
Bring Ancient Dragonforged Blades to [[Caladis Brightspear]] at [[Quel'Delar's Rest]].
* [[Ancient Dragonforged Blades]] (Provided)

== Description ==
We must get this book to Caladis Brightspear immediately. Would you bring it to him? I cannot rely on anyone else to transport the book and you have proven adept at keeping the [[Sunreavers]] at bay.

Take it with you to Quel'Delar's rest, south of the [[Argent Tournament Grounds]] in [[Icecrown]]. Caladis and the sword will be waiting. The sooner we can identify the blade, the sooner we can claim it. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|3|70}}

== Progress ==
We've been expecting your return. What has kept you?

== Completion ==
<Caldais accepts the heavy book and begins leafing through it.>

I knew the symbols on the blade were familiar. The weapon was most certainly forged by the dragons and gifted to one of the mortal races, but which blade is this, and how did it come to rest in Icecrown?

== Notes ==
On completion:
:{{text|say|Caladis Brightspear|I knew this was a dragonforged blade when I first laid eyes on it.}}
:{{text|say|Caladis Brightspear|But can it be? Is this really --}}
:''[[Lana'thel]] appears out of nowhere walking up to Quel'Delar from the southwest. The four sentinels and war mages rush to the sword.''
:{{text|say|Silver Covenant Sentinel|You are not welcome here, minion of the [[Lich King]]!}}
:{{text|say|Lana'thel|[[Quel'Delar]].}}
:''Lana'thel freezes the war mages and sentinels surrounding the sword.''
:{{text|say|Lana'thel|Quiet, fools. If I had wished to kill you, you'd already be dead.}}
:''While Lana'thel speaks, images of what she talks about appear just north of the blade.''
:{{text|say|Lana'thel|As [[:Quel'Serrar]] was forged by the dragons and given to the [[kaldorei]], its twin, Quel'Delar was given to [[blood elf|my people]].}}
:{{text|say|Lana'thel|The king bestowed the blade upon my friend, {{NPC||Thalorien Dawnseeker}}.}}
:{{text|say|Lana'thel|But even Thalorien's skill and Quel'Delar's magic could not save [[Silvermoon]] from the might of the [[Scourge]].}}
:{{text|say|Lana'thel|Thalorien fell before the gates of the [[Sunwell]], buying time for others to escape.}}
:''Lana'thel walks north and kneels down to inspect the image of Thalorien.''
:{{text|say|Lana'thel|After the battle, I recovered the sword from the field. I bore it to [[Northrend]] in the service of my prince, seeking to avenge our people's defeat.}}
:{{text|say|Lana'thel|[[Arthas Menethil|Arthas]] shattered our forces and took the most powerful of us into his service as the [[San'layn]].}}
:{{text|say|Lana'thel|My memories of Thalorien went cold and so did his blade.}}
:{{text|say|Lana'thel|It was I who brought Quel'Delar here, to return it to its makers. In breaking the weapon, so did I break its power.}}
:{{text|say|Lana'thel|Quel'Delar will never serve another!}}
:''The freeze fades and Lana'thel appears to cast some spell on Quel'Delar, disappearing once again.''
:{{text|say|Caladis Brightspear|I vow that the Silver Covenant will see Quel'Delar restored.}}
