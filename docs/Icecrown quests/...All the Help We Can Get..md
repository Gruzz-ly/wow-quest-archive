==Objectives==
[[High Captain Justin Bartlett]] aboard the ''[[Skybreaker]]'' wants you to speak to [[Thassarian]].

==Description==
Desperate times, <class>...

As uncomfortable as it makes me, I'm prepared to accept assistance from anyone - including our resident [[death knight]].

Go to Thassarian and see if he can help us develop tactics against the [[Scourge]] that will ensure victory once we are able to mount another offensive.

We have come so far... we must not fail here!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2200 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|32||}} at level 80)

==Completion==
It was wise of Captain Bartlett to send you.

While he frets over your conflict with the [[Horde]], someone must remain exclusively focused on the real mission here - the march on [[Icecrown Citadel]].

Who better to direct your efforts than a former servant of the [[Lich King]]?
