==Objectives==
Use the SGM-3 to destroy 6 [[Skybreaker Recon Fighter]]s, then report back to [[Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar]] aboard [[Orgrim's Hammer]].
* [[Skybreaker Recon Fighter]] (6)
* [[SGM-3]] (provided)

==Description==
The Alliance is tenacious, I'll give them that, but it'll take more than that to stop us. Take this [[:SGM-3]] with you and shoot down the [[Skybreaker]]'s recon fighters once again.

I doubt the message will get through their thick skulls, but there are enough missiles to keep trying to get our point across. Go and find their fighters flying above the [[Valley of Fallen Heroes]], west of [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]], and don't come back until you've made wreckage of them.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Completion==
Well done, once again. Horde superiority is assured, at least until those Alliance pukes decide to challenge us again.

==Notes==
This is the daily version of [[Blinding the Eyes in the Sky]].


The Skybreaker Recon Fighters fly over the [[Valley of Fallen Heroes]].  This is a simple point and shoot quest, and they do not attack.  The [[SGM-3]] does not need to be equipped to be fired.


As the fighters fly quickly enough to be hard to target, the following macro is useful in completing the quest:

 #show SGM-3
 /target skybreaker
 /use SGM-3
 
==Progression==
# [[Raise the Barricades (Horde)]]
#[[Bloodspattered Banners (Horde)]]
