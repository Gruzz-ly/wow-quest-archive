==Objectives==
[[Setaal Darkmender]] at [[Death's Rise]] has given you the [[Darkmender's Tincture]]. Apply it to the corpses of 10 of any of the [[Scarlet Onslaught]] units found there.
* Scarlet Onslaught corpse transformed (10)

==Description==
How kind... how generous our [[Lord-Commander Arete|lord-commander]] is. Where he is flowers and sunshine, I am filled only with hatred.

It is not enough to end their miserable lives... I want them humiliated... debased!

What could be more unspeakable than to be turned into that which you hate? To dedicate your existence to eradicating a thing, and then in the end to become it?

How sad.

Take this tincture northwest to Onslaught Harbor. Apply it to their still corpses and watch what happens, but avoid the cathedral. 

==Progress==
Surely you're not done so soon?

==Completion==
<The [[draenei]] [[death knight]] fixes you with a cold stare, her eyes as dead as the grave. A sly grin creeps across her features.>

I'll have more of the tincture prepared tomorrow. Until then, be well.

==Progression==
