==Objectives==
Return to [[Koltira Deathweaver]] aboard [[Orgrim's Hammer]].

==Description==
You should leave now. You'll find a portal behind me. It'll take you to the surface.

We'll meet again. He'll be looking for you.

It's only a matter of time until he finds you.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3|70}}

==Completion==
<name>!  We thought you were dead!

We lost a few men in that explosion... but we sure put a hurt on the Scourge.  They're scrambling their forces back to the citadel and leaving big gaps in their defenses.  It's time to push forward.

==Notes==
Click on the [[Surface Portal]] next to Matthias to get back to the surface, where you'll appear at the steps of [[Icecrown Citadel]].

==Progression==
