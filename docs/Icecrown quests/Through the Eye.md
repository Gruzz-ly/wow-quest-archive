==Objectives==
[[The Bone Witch]] in [[Njorndar Village]] has tasked you with using the [[Eye of the Lich King]] to gain information.
* Information gained for The Bone Witch

==Description==
We must use the [[Lich King]]'s tools against him if we are to decide our next step.

Over the mountain to the southwest lies [[Kul'galar Keep]]. Within it reside the [[Kul'galar Oracle|oracles]] of [[Jotunheim]] whom receive orders from their master and scry upon others through the Eye of the Lich King.

It is the eye that you must fight your way to. While it cannot be used to pierce the veil within [[Icecrown Citadel]], you should be able to use it to discern something of value so that we will know how best to proceed. 

==Progress==
You return with no information at all! Is this how you repay my help to you and the [[Knights of the Ebon Blade]]?

Begone and do not return until you have the knowledge I seek!

==Completion==
Perfect! It's true that Iskalder is rumored to have been the finest vrykul warrior to ever live. And Vardmadra herself is going to come here to judge him!

We must move quickly if we are to get to this ancient hero before they do!

==Notes==
The entrance to Kul'galar is southeast of Balagarde in the side of the mountain at {{coords|24.8|61.0|Icecrown}}

When interacting with the eye:
:Ancient magic swirls within the depths of the eye. It gives you a feeling of vertigo, as if you might accidentally tumble into its iris and fall forever.

:{{text|say|Image of a Shadow Cultist says: A name? Oh, yes, the name! I believe it was [[Iskalder]].}}

:{{text|say|Image of Vardmadra says: Return to Jotunheim and tell them to keep him asleep until I arrive. I will judge this vrykul with my own eyes.}}
