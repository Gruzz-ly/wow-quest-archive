==Objectives==
[[Keritose Bloodblade]] at the [[Shadow Vault]] has dispatched you to slaughter 80 [[undead]] in the [[Weeping Quarry]]. Speak to him to secure a [[skeletal gryphon]] for the assault.
* Weeping Quarry Undead slaughtered (80)

==Description==
Effective tool, is it not? Excellent job weakening their defenses, <class>. Now we can push the main assault.

The plan here is straight-forward - we're looking to destroy anything moving, and get in there and steal some information amidst the confusion.

Let me know when you're ready and I'll set you up with a skeletal gryphon. 

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Have some fun of it, eh?

==Completion==
Practically defenseless. It doesn't get much easier than that.

==Notes==
While on the gryphon, #1 is a medium-range no-cooldown/no-GCD ground-targeted AOE. Leave the gryphon manually after getting the 80 kills.
