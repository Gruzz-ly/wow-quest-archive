==Objectives==
[[Absalan the Pious]] aboard the ''[[Skybreaker]]'' wants you to rescue 10 Saronite Mine Slaves.
* [[Saronite Mine Slave]] rescued (10)

==Description==
Our people are being captured and put to work as slaves in the [[saronite]] mines of [[Ymirheim]], the [[vrykul]] stronghold in the middle of [[Icecrown]]. The [[Lich King]] has them mining that unholy ore day and night.

I made a promise to [[Tirion Fordring|Highlord Fordring]] that we would get those wretches out of there alive, and that's exactly what we will do.

Unfortunately, I've been ordered to stay on this gunship and serve as an ambassador to the [[Valiance Expedition]]. Will you please rescue them in my stead, <name>? 

==Progress==
I haven't received many reports of our men returning to the [[Argent Vanguard]].

Are you sure you've been to Ymirheim to free them?

==Completion==
They're being driven insane? Voices in their heads?

Voices in your head?!

I want you to clear your mind of the taint that has crept into that place, <race>.

We'll try to get the remainder of them out of there tomorrow when you've had a chance to rest.

== Notes ==
The miners stand a chance of attacking or running deeper into the cave instead of going free.

Deep in the mine stands [[Darkspeaker R'khem]] who will offer you the quest [[Mind Tricks]].
