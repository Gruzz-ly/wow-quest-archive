==Objectives==
[[Baron Sliver]] at [[Shadow Vault (Icecrown)|The Shadow Vault]] wishes you to plant 15 Ebon Blade Banners within the corpses of [[vrykul]] found within the greater [[Jotunheim]] region.
* Vrykul corpses impaled with Ebon Blade banners (15)
* [[Ebon Blade Banner (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
We must attack the vrykul of Jotunheim on many levels. Brute force, of course, is good, but I prefer a more cerebral approach.

I want you to demoralize them.

My men here have forged a number of banners for you. I would like for you to take and plant them within the corpses of fallen vrykul.

Let the banners serve as a constant reminder to them that they face a more immediate threat than the wrath of the [[Lich King]]. 

==Progress==
Oh now, <name>, I don't think you're quite done yet.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Let them see the desecrated corpses of their fallen comrades and think twice about striking at us!

If you come back tomorrow, I will make certain to have more banners prepared for you.
