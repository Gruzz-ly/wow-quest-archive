==Notes==
Get to any of the neutral drakes on the ground, get on, get up in the air and target the roofs of the wooden buildings.

Currently, you cannot set the same building on fire twice in a row.  You can, though, alternate between two buildings, even if they are currently on fire.

==Quest Error==
In the description of the quest, it says you have to set fire to 10 buildings, when actually, you only set fire to 8.
