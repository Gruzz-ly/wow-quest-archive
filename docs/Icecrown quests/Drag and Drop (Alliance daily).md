==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]], aboard the ''[[Skybreaker]]'', wants you to collect [[Orb of Illusion|Orbs of Illusion]] from [[Bitter Initiate]]s at [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]] and use them on 3 Dark Subjugators there.
*[[Dark Subjugator|Dark Subjugators]] Dragged and Dropped (3)

==Description==
Looks like those initiates are increasing in number again. You know what to do...

At the southern portion of the gate, the new [[Cult of the Damned|cultists]] are being trained. They're certain to be holding a special item given to all initiates - an Orb of Illusion.

These artifacts are used to disguise a cult member, allowing them to gain safe passage, infiltrate, or simply blend in with an enemy.

Slay the fools until you find some, then use them on the Subjugators there. 

==Progress==
Yes, <race>?

==Completion==
An effective tool, given the circumstances, wouldn't you say?

That one never gets old....
