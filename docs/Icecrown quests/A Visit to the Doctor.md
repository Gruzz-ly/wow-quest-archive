==Objectives==
[[Darkrider Arly]] at [[Blackwatch]] wants you to destroy the [[Metal Stake]] imprisoning Patches in the [[Sanctum of Reanimation]] and help him get his revenge on [[Doctor Sabnok]].
* {{Mob|"Patches"}} freed
* Help Patches kill [[Doctor Sabnok]]

==Description==
So they've been embedding these [[ghoul]]s with broken shards of [[saronite]] down in the Sanctum of Reanimation? We must put a stop to this, before these ghouls can be deployed against our troops.

Find the entrance to the Sanctum of Reanimation in the [[flesh giant]] lab area of the [[Fleshwerks]]. There, the ghoul mastermind, Doctor Sabnok, keeps the most fearsome of his creations, Patches. Free Patches from his chains and help him take his revenge on the doctor. Let his own creation be his undoing. 

==Progress==
Have you unleashed the doctor's creation against him?

==Completion==
<Darkrider Arly throws her head back and laughs darkly.>

A fitting end for the 'good' docter, wouldn't you say?

==Notes==
Go in the sanctum and take a right, jump down. Unleash "Patches", let him take aggro and a few swings and after 10 seconds or so Patches will kill Dr. Sabnok. Be on Sabnok's aggro table before Patches kills the good doctor.  While you yourself are unable to damage Sabnok, you need to be nearby to get credit.

:{{text|say|Doctor Sabnok|Oh, bravo. Do you feel proud of yourself now that you've unleashed this terrible mistake?}}
:{{text|say|Doctor Sabnok|I already had him scheduled for disposal, but I suppose we can speed up the process a bit.}}
:{{text|say|Doctor Sabnok|It's a pity so many fine, and reusable, parts will go to waste...}}
:{{text|say|"Patches"|Patches not going to be cut open or sewn up no more!}}
