==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]] on the [[Alliance]] gunship, ''[[Skybreaker]]'', wants you to kill 5 Hulking Abominations, 5 Malefic Necromancers, and 5 Shadow Adepts at the [[Broken Front]].
* [[Hulking Abomination|Hulking Abominations]] killed (5)
* [[Malefic Necromancer|Malefic Necromancers]] killed (5)
* [[Shadow Adept|Shadow Adepts]] killed (5)

==Description==
As someone of your experience must surely know, there's no better way to familiarize one's self with their enemy than by confronting them in combat.

While you no doubt lust for the glory of taking [[Icecrown Citadel]], that cannot happen without taking each of the [[Lich King]]'s gates first. For now, you must focus your efforts on the first of these...

Return to the Broken Front. Engage the enemy in battle. Search for a weakness we might exploit and return to me with a detailed report. 

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox| |Ring of the Fallen Shadow Adept|Hulking Abomination Hide Cloak|Amulet of the Malefic Necromancer}}

==Progress==
You've returned, <class>...

Anything to report?

==Completion==
Really, <class>?

Nothing notable to report?

<Thassarian notices the [[abomination]] remains splattered across your clothes and smiles.>

I beg to differ...
