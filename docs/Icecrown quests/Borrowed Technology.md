==Objectives==
[[Chief Engineer Boltwrench]] aboard the ''[[Skybreaker]]'' wants you to use the [[Smuggled Solution]] at the Broken Front.

Using the solution will require an [[Abandoned Helm]], [[Abandoned Armor]], and [[Pile of Bones (Icecrown)]], all found at the Broken Front.
* Field Tests Conducted (3)

==Description==
I get it, I get it. [[High Captain Justin Bartlett|Cappy's]] too busy to see this for himself. His loss!

See, I've managed to 'acquire' a certain shipment of solution from [[Horde|the enemy]]. And as much as I hate tinkerin' with inferior [[goblin technology]], I'm inclined to make an exception here.

Take this sample. I'll need you to run a few field tests, just to prove its usefulness, while I try to do a little reverse engineering to duplicate the creation process.

Go to the front and gather the materials to make a decoy, then use the oil. 

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Well, how'd it go, <race>?

==Completion==
Good news!

I've managed to reproduce the solution - hardly an accomplishment, of course.

Doubt I'll live the day to see those neanderthal [[goblin]]s cook up somethin' a [[gnome]] can't recreate in his sleep!
