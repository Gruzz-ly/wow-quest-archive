==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]], aboard the [[Skybreaker]], wants you to defeat Alumeth the Ascended at [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]].
*[[Alumeth the Ascended]] slain
Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
It's Alumeth... He's growing in power again. I can sense it. Again his underlings are channeling power to his soul.

If he's allowed to rest, their efforts will soon transform him into a mighty adversary.

Return to his chamber in the north portion of Aldur'thar. Combine his {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Heart|heart}}, {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Skull|skull}}, {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Scepter|scepter}} and {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Robes|robes}}, then use his {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Remains|remains}} on the crystal there.

Hurry, <race>! Destroy him before he becomes any more powerful! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|22|20}}
*33100 [[XP]] (or {{cost|19|86}} at max level)

==Progress==
Well, friend? Were you successful against Alumeth?

==Completion==
Alumeth has suffered a sound defeat, but I sense that his spirit still lingers...

==Notes==
The quest items only last two minutes in your inventory. It would be recommended that players clear the area before picking up the various items.

This quest does not award reputation.
