==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]] aboard the ''[[Skybreaker]]'' wants you to kill [[Coprous the Defiled]] at [[Mord'rethar: The Death Gate|Mord'rethar]].
* Coprous the Defiler Slain
Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
Reports of a powerful [[zombie]] at the death gate have reached my ears, <class>.

We cannot allow a potential threat such as this to go unchallenged. Any information you are able to glean from engaging it will be better than what we know now.

Go to the western chamber of the gate and find this creature. Fight him, and find a weakness we might exploit. 

==Progress==
Were you able to find the zombie, <class>?

==Completion==
Well done, <class>.

Perhaps with some investigation, we can discover how they are bringing such a creature into existence.

==Notes==
Coprous can be found at in the western building of Mord'rethar at {{coords|61.8|62.1|Icecrown}}

==Progression==
{{Mord'rethar: The Death Gate (Alliance)}}
