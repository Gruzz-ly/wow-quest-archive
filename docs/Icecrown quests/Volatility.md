==Objectives==
[[Chief Engineer Copperclaw]] aboard [[Orgrim's Hammer]] wants you to use Copperclaw's Volatile Oil at the Broken Front to attract 3 Frostbrood Skytalons.

To use the oil, you must collect a [[Pile of Bones (Icecrown)|Pile of Bones]], an [[Abandoned Helm]], and [[Abandoned Armor]] from the battlefield there. 
* Field Tests Conducted (3)
* [[Copperclaw's Volatile Oil]] (provided)

==Description==
Where to begin... well, you must know that as chief engineer of this vessel I have access to all of the intelligence reports - yes, yes, it's true, and I've recently taken a particular interest in the frostwyrms you reported seeing to the south, and I do believe I've developed a plan that just might work against them... now it'll take a little legwork on your part, but essentially, you build a dummy out of armor and coat it with a splash of this solution, then run for cover!

...You still here, <race>? 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Smuggler's Bracers
|Glacier-walker's Mukluks
|Skycaptain's Belt
|Plated Bracelet of the Skies}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Completion==
Wahooo! I saw them light up all the way from here! I'll just chalk that up as another success and begin bottling this stuff up for the invasion - of course it might need a little more testing as we go if you're at all interested....

==Notes==
The needed parts are on the ground near [[The Broken Front]]/[[Mord'Rethar: The Death Gate]].
