==Objectives==
[[Chief Engineer Copperclaw]] aboard [[Orgrim's Hammer]] wants you to throw a [[:Writhing Mass]] into a cauldron at [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]].
*Writhing Mass Banished
*[[Diluted Cult Tonic]] (provided)

==Description==
This should do the trick!

Those [[Cult of the Damned|twisted hooligans]] are looking for souls to put in their crazy-juice? Then I say we help 'em out a bit!

Take a swig of this - don't worry, I've diluted it plenty... Its only effect will be to detect any cultist's [[Tainted Essence|essence]] once you've defeated them.

When you've collected a bunch of essences, throw the writhing mass of twisted souls into any of their cauldrons.

Let's see how they like a taste of their own medicine! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bow of Regression
|Twisted Hooligan Whacker
|Writhing Mace

You will also receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Completion==
Wahoo!

That'll teach 'em!
