==Objectives==
Report back to [[Baron Sliver]] at [[The Shadow Vault]]. 

==Description==
It sounds like you did extremely well. And you secured three very important allies for the [[Knights of the Ebon Blade]] in the process.

<[[Thassarian]] gazes out over the horizon.>

You should head back. By now, Baron Sliver and the other [[death knight]]s will be fighting tooth and nail to hold The Shadow Vault against the might of the [[Scourge]].

I'm sure they'll need your help. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Softly Glowing Orb|Chuchu's Tiny Box of Horrors|Thorny Rose Brooch}}

==Completion==
Good of you to return. As you can see, we have our hands full here.

==Notes==
The Shadow Vault is now in a new phase. The Baron can be found southwest of his previous position at {{coords|42.9|25.0|Icecrown}}

Completing this quest also opens up the [[Icecrown Citadel]] quest chain starting with [[Exploiting an Opening]] from [[Thassarian]] aboard the ''[[Skybreaker]]''.
