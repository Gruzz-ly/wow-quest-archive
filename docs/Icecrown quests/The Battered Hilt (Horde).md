This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

== Objectives ==
Bring the [[Battered Hilt#Horde|Battered Hilt]] to [[Myralion Sunblaze]] at [[Quel'Delar's Rest]], south of the [[Argent Tournament Grounds]].

== Description ==
This battered old sword hilt has seen better days. Before the hilt was snapped from the blade, it must've been a magnificent example of the blacksmith's art.

The graceful symbols and exotic gemstones decorating the hilt suggest that the weapon may have belonged to a powerful person. Surely, the [[Sunreavers]] would be interested in hearing about the recovery of such an artifact. Seek out their representatives at Quel'Delar's Rest, to the south of the Argent Tournament Grounds.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5|80}}

==Progress==
What have you discovered?

== Completion ==
<Myralion takes the hilt from you and scrutinizes the artifact.>

This came from the [[Icecrown Citadel|citadel]]? What was it doing there? This blade is certainly not of [[Scourge]] manufacture.

Weapons of this quality can only be crafted by a few of [[Azeroth]]'s creatures. We will have to consult them and see if they can help us identify it.
