==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]], aboard the ''[[Skybreaker]]'', wants you to collect 5 [[Dark Matter (quest item)|Dark Matters]] and summon a Dark Messenger at [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]].
*[[Dark Messenger]] summoned
*[[Rod of Siphoning]] (provided)

==Description==
Alright, <friend/missy>, time to plant a bug.

Relax, it's not a bug exactly, but it'll serve our purposes.

In the the northern portion of Aldur'thar the [[Cult of the Damned|cult's]] [[Void Summoner]]s enslave demonic minions. Use this rod to siphon the dark matter from the corpses of these [[Enslaved Minion]]s, and then use their summoning crystal to bring our little spy into being.

Until it is discovered, the messenger will serve as our eyes and ears, discreetly observing the actions of our enemy. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Mantle of the Dark Messenger|Gilly's Strangulation Gauntlets|Chain Gloves of the Demonic Minion|Legplates of the Northern Expedition|Gutbuster of Aldur'thar}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|7|40}}
*22050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|13|23}} at max level)

==Progress==
Yes, <class>?

==Completion==
You have done well, <class>.

The messenger has already turned up some valuable information.

==Notes==
The [[warlocks]] and [[voidwalkers]] are in the northeast portion of Aldurthar and the summoning crystal is towards the center of the north end of the gate at {{coords|53.8|33.6|Icecrown}}

To collect the dark matter, you must select the Enslaved Minion's corpse and use the provided Rod of Siphoning.  Two very common things can keep you from collecting the dark matter.

* opening another corpse before collecting the dark matter from the enslaved Minion.
* killing another mob before collecting the dark matter.

That is, to successfully collect the dark matter, you have to kill the summoner, then kill the minion, then use the rod.  You can open the minion's corpse without losing the ability to successfully use the rod.

While this is not likely to be the behavior Blizzard intended, this may still be "not a bug"...

==Trivia==
There is a slight Easter Egg in this quest.  The terms "Cannot Reproduce", "Not a Bug" and "Need More Info" are terms used for "states" of a bug tracked in many common software error tracking systems, which is used by Quality Assurance Testers and developers to communicate about bugs written up by the testers.  Therefore this is a slight homage to QA Testers throughout the game industry.
