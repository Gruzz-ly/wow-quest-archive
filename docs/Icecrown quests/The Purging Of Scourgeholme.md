== Objectives ==
[[The Ebon Watcher]] at the [[Valley of Echoes]] in [[Icecrown]] wants you to kill 3 [[Forgotten Depths High Priest]]s, 3 [[Forgotten Depths Underking]]s, and 8 [[Reanimated Crusader]]s.
* [[Forgotten Depths High Priest]] slain (3)
* [[Forgotten Depths Underking]] slain (3)
* [[Reanimated Crusader]] slain (8)

== Description ==
The [[Scourge]] have sent their armies at the [[Argent Crusade]] and have been repelled. What they do now is called a 'slash and burn.' All prisoners that they hold at [[Scourgeholme]] will be executed and raised as servants of the [[Lich King]].

Undoubtedly the Argent Crusade will request that you give their soldiers a proper farewell. I'll ask no such thing of you. To succeed we must kill Scourge indiscriminately.

Venture to Scourgeholme, northwest through the [[Breach (Icecrown)|Breach]], and lay waste to all that stand in your way. 

== Progress ==
Do not waste time, <name>.

== Completion ==
You have done well, <name>. Keeping their numbers down will give the Argent Crusade the time that they need to set a foundation.

== Notes ==
This quest combines well with [[The Restless Dead]] and [[The Scourgestone]].
