==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]] aboard the ''[[Skybreaker]]'' wants you to slay 5 Wyrm Reanimators, 8 Cultist Corrupters and 3 Vrykul Necrolords at Sindragosa's Fall.
* [[Wyrm Reanimator]] slain (5)
* [[Cultist Corrupter]] slain (8)
* [[Vrykul Necrolord]] slain (3)

==Description==
You're a real star, <name>. See, when I give one of these other soldiers an assignment, the odds of them getting it done are about fifty-fifty. The odds of them coming back... well, slightly worse.

But with you, it's always a guaranteed thing. Like gnomish clockwork!

Anyway, I have another one for you. [[Sindragosa's Fall|Sindragosa's fall]], east of the valley. There is some serious [[Cult of the Damned|cultist]] activity, including and not limited to, the raising of [[Frost wyrm|Frost Wyrms]]. I need you to go kick their teeth in.

I hate cultists.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
<Name>, you're back!

==Completion==
Nice job, <name>. You make the rest of us look bad!

==Notes==
Matthias is at the fall and will pick up where he left off in [[Where Dragons Fell]].
