Completing this quest results in [[Shadow Vault]] becoming a friendly (or neutral) quest hub.

==Objectives==
Defeat General Lightsbane and then report your success back to [[Thassarian]] aboard the gunship, [[Skybreaker|The Skybreaker]].
* [[General Lightsbane]] slain

==Description==
[[Death knight]]s, such as General Lightsbane, are held on too tight of a leash to be able to be turned from the [[Lich King]]'s will except under [[Battle for Light's Hope Chapel|the most extraordinary circumstances]].

The general keeps himself within the vault overseeing the creation of new weapons. Disturb one of his weapon racks at the northern [[Runeforge|forge]] and I assure you, he will come. I'll send [[Vile]], [[Lady Nightswood]], and [[The Leaper]] in to help you.

If we are to finally own [[The Shadow Vault]], General Lightsbane must fall!

==Progress==
I ask you, <name>, why would we be speaking again if General Lightsbane yet exists?

==Completion==
General Lightsbane and his forces are defeated? The Shadow Vault is taken?

==Notes==
The weapon rack is by the northern runeforge at {{coords|44.7|19.8|Icecrown}}

Lightsbane has ~65k health. Vile will spawn a few seconds in, so do as much damage as you can so the taunt will be effective. Vile will taunt as often as he can, but he only has ~8k HP so move quick. 

:General Lightsbane says: You're the one that's been disrupting things? This should be easy.
:Vile says: SMASH!
:Lady Nightswood says: My dear general, your time has come!
:The Leaper says: MRMRFRMRFRMRRRR!
