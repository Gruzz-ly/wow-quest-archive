To get this quest, you need to have finished [[Need More Info (Alliance)]] from the [[Sneak Preview (Alliance)|Sneak Preview]] quest chain.

==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]], aboard the ''[[Skybreaker]]'', wants you to construct 8 Barricades using your Barricade Construction Kit.
* Barricades constructed (8)
* [[Barricade Construction Kit]] (provided)

==Description==
When our forces begin to move beyond [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]], they will be vulnerable to attack from the [[Ironwall Rampart]] and the broad glacier below.

We have neither the time nor the materials to build fortifications, but we can put up some barricades to shield our men from fire and break up [[Scourge]] charges.

Take this barricade kit to the [[Valley of Fallen Heroes]], on the west side of Aldur'thar. Locate the markers I've placed there and use this kit to construct your barricades there. 

==Progress==
Have you constructed those barricades?

==Completion==
<Thassarian nods.>

Good. It's not much protection, but it's better than nothing. That gate is till the perfect choke point if the Scourge commanders know what they're doing. We must gain control of as much of the surrounding area as possible.

==Notes==
Just west of the gate on the ground are a bunch of ephemeral beacons.
