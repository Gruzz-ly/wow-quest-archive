==Objectives==
Bring the Breath of Alexstrasza to [[Crusader Bridenbrad]] in [[Icecrown]].
* [[The Breath of Alexstrasza]] (provided)

==Description==
You must understand, young <race>, that cleansing the body in favor of life anew is something well within my grasp... removing the [[plague of undeath]] without affecting the body, however, is beyond the scope of the powers that I control.

If this Bridenbrad is the beacon of light that you profess him to be, perhaps he will endure such a cleansing and thrive, but I cannot state with confidence that this is the salvation that you seek. Take it and go with all of my blessings.

==Progress==
You have returned yet again, <class>. Why do you risk yourself so?

==Completion==
The breath of [[Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Alexstrasza]]... you have gone to the dragon-queen herself? I'm extremely grateful.

I understand the risks of such cleansing and I am prepared. Proceed, <class>.
