==Objectives==
Use the SGM-3 to destroy 6 [[Skybreaker Recon Fighter]]s, then report back to [[Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar]] aboard ''[[Orgrim's Hammer]]''.
* [[Skybreaker Recon Fighter]]s shot down (6)
* [[SGM-3]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Alliance]] has somehow managed to field a squadron of recon vehicles over the [[Valley of Fallen Heroes]] and [[Icecrown Glacier]], the broad areas west of [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]].

They cannot be permitted to take the lead in this fight. [[Chief Engineer Copperclaw]] has supplied me with the perfect weapon to deal with this threat—he calls his new missile the SGM-3. I have his assurances that it will take out the Alliance flying machines in a single hit. Go and use this weapon to give us the upper hand. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Completion==
Good. Fewer Alliance pests to stand in our way. We'll show them what true warriors look like.

==Notes==
The fighters fly over the [[Valley of Fallen Heroes]], northwest of Ymirheim, west of Aldur'thar, east of the rampart. This is a simple point and shoot quest, and they do not attack.  The [[SGM-3]] does not need to be equipped to be fired.


As the fighters fly quickly enough to be hard to target, the following macro is useful in completing the quest:

 #show SGM-3
 /target skybreaker
 /use SGM-3

Completing this quest opens a daily version, [[Keeping the Alliance Blind]].
