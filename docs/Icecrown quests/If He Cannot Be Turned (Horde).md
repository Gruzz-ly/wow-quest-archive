Completing this quest results in [[Shadow Vault]] becoming a friendly (or neutral) quest hub.

== Objectives ==
Defeat [[General Lightsbane]] and then report your success back to [[Koltira Deathweaver]] aboard the gunship, ''[[Orgrim's Hammer]]''.
* [[General Lightsbane]] slain

== Description ==
[[Death knight]]s, such as General Lightsbane, are held on too tight of a leash to be able to be turned from the [[Lich King]]'s will except under the most extraordinary circumstances.

The general keeps himself within the vault overseeing the creation of new weapons. Disturb one of his weapon racks at the northern forge and I assure you, he will come. I'll send [[Vile]], [[Lady Nightswood]], and [[The Leaper]] in to help you.

If we are to finally own [[The Shadow Vault]], General Lightsbane must fall! 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|14|80}}

== Completion ==
General Lightsbane and his forces are defeated? The Shadow Vault is taken?

==Progression==
{{The Duke}}
