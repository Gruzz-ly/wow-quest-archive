==Objectives==
[[Chief Engineer Boltwrench]] aboard the ''[[Skybreaker]]'' wants you to throw a Writhing Mass into a [[Plague cauldron|cauldron]] at [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]].
*[[Writhing Mass]] Banished
*[[Diluted Cult Tonic]] (provided)

==Description==
This should do the trick!

Those twisted hooligans are looking for souls to put in their crazy-juice? Then I say we help 'em out a bit!

Take a swig of this - don't worry, I've diluted it plenty... I'm almost positive that its only effect will be to detect any [[Cult of the Damned|cultist's]] essence once you've defeated them.

When you've collected a bunch of them, throw the writhing mass of twisted souls into any of their cauldrons.

Let's see how they like a taste of their own medicine! 

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Well, <class>?

We have a few less cultists to worry about?

==Completion==
Wahoo!

That'll teach 'em!
