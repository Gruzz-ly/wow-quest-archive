==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]], aboard the [[Skybreaker]], wants you to use the Volatile Acid to dissolve the corpses of 6 Skeletal Reavers.
*[[Skeletal Reaver]] bones dissolved (6)
Suggested Players [5]
*[[Volatile Acid]] (provided)

==Description==
[[The Conflagration]], the ground before [[Corp'rethar]], south of the [[Ironwall Rampart]], is where the [[Lich King]]'s elite soldiers have formed up to defend the [[Icecrown Citadel|citadel]].

Led by a contingent of death knights, a legion of skeletal reavers bars the way. I fear that even when these reavers fall, the [[Scourge]] will simply reconstitute them and send them back at us.

I've come up with a plan to stop this, but I have no way of knowing if it will work. Take this solution and use it to dissolve the remains of the reavers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}} (or {{cost|13|23}} at max level)
*22050 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Knights of the Ebon Blade]]

==Progress==
Have you tested the solution out on the reavers?

==Completion==
<Thassarian listens as you describe your successful tests.>

So the acid worked? Good. We'll need it when the army goes up against the reavers in force.

==Notes==
Many Skeletal Reavers can be found at {{coords|45|65|Icecrown}}.
