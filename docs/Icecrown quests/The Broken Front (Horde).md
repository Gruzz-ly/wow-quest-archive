==Objectives==
[[Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar|Korm Blackscar]] on [[Orgrim's Hammer]] wants you to go to [[The Broken Front]] and question a Dying Berserker to discover what happened there.
*[[Dying Berserker]] Questioned

==Description==
What battle?! Those troops were on a recon mission!

And what's this talk of Alliance - you're sure he said Alliance?

Listen to me, <name>! I need to know what's going on and I need to know NOW!

Get yourself down there and get me some answers! Scour the battlefield and look for survivors - clues - anything!

==Progress==
Well, <Name>?

Have you got new information for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40|}}
*22050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
They saw the Alliance assaulting the gate and they attacked them from behind...

<After a brief pause, Korm bursts into laughter.>

THAT is what it means to be HORDE!

Were it not for them, the Alliance maggots would likely be holding that gate!

Their boldness has bought us precious time.

==Notes==
They can be found around {{coords|70.7|68.5|Icecrown}}. 

When you question the Dying Berserker, they explain what transpired:

-Hold on friend. Tell me what happened here.

Gathering... information.... on the Scourge.
Alliance forces appeared...
We took cover - waited until they attacked the gate, 
then, we hit them from the rear.
Pinched between us... and the Scourge... it was too much for them...

Brother... it was... glorious.
