== Objectives ==
{{npc||The Ebon Watcher}} at the [[Valley of Echoes]] in [[Icecrown]] wants you to kill {{npc||Salranax the Flesh Render}}, {{npc||Underking Talonox}} and {{npc||High Priest Yath'amon}}.
* [[Salranax the Flesh Render]] slain
* [[Underking Talonox]] slain
* [[High Priest Yath'amon]] slain

== Description ==
You must defeat the lords of [[Scourgeholme]] if this place is to be free of the [[Scourge]]'s grasp.

Salranax the Flesh Render lords over the temple on the first tier of Scourgeholme. Nearby Salranax you'll find High Priest Yath'amon preaching at the spirit tower on the second tier. Underking Talonox holds court at the [[Pit of Fiends]], up the high road.

These are formidable opponents and must be approached with caution. Use this war horn should you require aid. The [[death knight]]s of [[Acherus]] will come.

* [[War Horn of Acherus]] (provided)

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Leiah's Footpads
|Sixen's Skullcap
|Cobalt's Shoulderguards
|Jayde's Reinforced Handguards
}}

== Progress ==
Finish them, <name>!

== Completion ==
A hard fought victory, <name>! The lieutenants will be replaced, but at least for today the air about Scourgeholme stands still.

== Notes ==
{{Zone Map|zone=Icecrown|notes=
{{Zone Map Note|77.4|61.9||Salranax the Flesh Render}}
{{Zone Map Note|80.1|61.2||High Priest Yath'amon}}

Using the horn will summon a different death knight on each mob:
* {{npc||Munch}}, an [[orc]] death knight, and his ghoul {{npc||Melt}} will help you killing Salranax.
* {{npc||Jayde}}, a [[blood elf]] death knight, will assist you in killing Yath'amon.
* {{npc||Highlord Darion Mograine}} will help you kill Talonox, who is up north at the [[Pit of Fiends]].

After killing the third named mob, take the [[Death Gate]] back to the Valley of Echoes.

This quest's rewards are named after players who were active in WotLK Friends and Family Alpha. More information concerning these Death Knights can be found here: [[The Death Knights of Acherus]].
