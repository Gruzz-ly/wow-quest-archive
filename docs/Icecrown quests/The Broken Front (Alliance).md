This quest makes available [[No Mercy!]] (PvP daily), [[...All the Help We Can Get.]], and [[Your Attention, Please]].

==Objectives==
[[High Captain Justin Bartlett]] aboard the [[Skybreaker]] wants you to go to the [[Broken Front]] and question a [[Dying Soldier]], then report back to him.
* Dying Soldier Questioned

==Description==
What?! Noooo!

We went to such great pains to keep this attack secret. How could the [[Horde]] have known? The resources... the men... all lost? Inconceivable!

Our plans here in [[Icecrown]] hinged upon our taking that gate before the Horde could. We must recover quickly and prepare to mount another offensive.

Visit the battlefield and search for any survivors. See if there's anything to be learned from this tragedy.

And prepare yourself, <name>, for a war - on two fronts... 

==Progress==
Well, <name>?

What have you learned?

==Completion==
So... It was a rout - a total loss. This shall not be forgotten.

Mark my words, <class>. The Horde shall pay for this... there will be no mercy.

==Notes==
The Broken Front is south of Mord'rethar the Death Gate.

There are plenty dying soldiers south of the wandering mobs just south of the gate.

:Uhnhh.... It is too late for me, <brother/miss>.
:I am... finished...
{{gossip|''Stay with me, friend. I must know what happened here.''}}

:We attacked under cover of a blizzard....
:The Scourge were caught off guard... our victory was certain....
:Then... from behind us... the Horde came from nowhere.
:They cost us... everything...

That completes the quest objectives, but the Dying Soldier then offers [[Finish Me!]]
