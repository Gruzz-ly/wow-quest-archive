==Objectives==
[[Crusader Olakin Sainrith]] at [[Blackwatch]] wants you to burn 7 Festering Corpses using Olakin's Torch.
* [[Festering Corpse]] burned (7)
* [[Olakin's Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Scourge]] uses our own fallen against us, by raising them as [[ghoul]]s or [[skeleton]]s, or by dismembering their corpses and using the parts to make [[abomination]]s. This must stop!

The dead are heroes who fell in defense of all the living, and they cannot be confined to so grisly a fate. Moreover, we cannot afford to face them again on the field, used as weapons against us. Take this torch with you to the [[Fleshwerks]], and burn any of the corpses you find in the [[Sanctum of Reanimation]] or the abomination lab. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Fair Touch of the Crusader|Olakin's Enchanted Torch}}

==Progress==
Have you disposed of the corpses of the Scourge's victims?

==Completion==
<Crusader Olakin Sainrith listens solemnly to your report.>

It is not the burial they deserved, but it is better than nothing, and better for those who yet live. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes and trivia==
There's more than enough festering corpses in the sanctum cave. No need to look for them outside.

The name of the quest is one of [[Ragnaros_(tactics)#Quotes|Ragnaros' quotes]].
