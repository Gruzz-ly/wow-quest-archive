==Objectives==
Return to [[Thassarian]] aboard the ''[[Skybreaker]]''. 

==Description==
Do you see now? Sending your men against the [[Arthas Menethil|prince's]] armies just swells their numbers.

I don't expect you to understand... you'll probably just end like the others. You'd best return to whoever sent you. They might be worried. 

==Completion==
Nice shooting, <name>. The [[Scourge]] never had a chance.

Are you feeling ok? You look like you've seen a ghost. Not that it would be an unusual thing around these parts, now that I think about it.

==Progression==
{{Do Your Worst}}
