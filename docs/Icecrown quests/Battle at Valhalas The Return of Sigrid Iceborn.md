* [[Sigrid Iceborn]] Defeated
Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
An old foe of yours has returned: Sigrid Iceborn. Perhaps you remember besting her in a duel upon the [[Savage Ledge]]?

No matter, she certainly remembers you. She's insisting upon a chance to prove herself once more.

Personally, I think it's more a chance for revenge, but that too can be useful in this place.

I leave it up to you, <name>. Will you face Sigrid Iceborn once more? 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Runic Healing Potion|Runic Mana Potion|q1=5|q2=5}}

==Completion==
The defeat of one of the [[hyldnir]] is mildly impressive, <race>, but you did have the help of your friends.

You're lucky that her drake didn't get involved.
