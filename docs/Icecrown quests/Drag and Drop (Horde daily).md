==Objectives==
[[Koltira Deathweaver|Koltira]], aboard ''[[Orgrim's Hammer]]'', wants you to collect  [[Orb of Illusion|Orbs of Illusion]] from [[Bitter Initiate]]s at [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]] and use them on 3 Dark Subjugators there.
*[[Dark Subjugator]] Dragged and Dropped (3)

==Description==
Looks like those initiates are increasing in number again. You know what to do...

At the southern portion of the gate, the new [[Cult of the Damned|cultists]] are being trained. They're certain to be holding a special item given to all initiates - an Orb of Illusion.

These artifacts are used to disguise a cult member, allowing them to gain safe passage, infiltrate, or simply blend in with an enemy.

Slay the fools until you find some, then use them on the subjugators there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}} (or {{cost|13|23}} at max level)
*22050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes, <race>?

==Completion==
An effective tool, given the circumstances, wouldn't you say?

That one never gets old....

==Notes==
Throwing the Orb at a subjugator will aggro an [[Aldur'thar Sentry]] on the subjugator who will drop him/her from some height.
