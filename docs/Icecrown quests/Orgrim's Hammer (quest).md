==Objectives==
Seek out [[Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar]] aboard [[Orgrim's Hammer]] flying above [[Icecrown]].

==Description==
The [[Argent Crusade]] pulled my ravaged body from the Broken Front. What a glorious battle, <race>. My axe sang as it cut down [[Alliance]] filth and [[Scourge]] alike.

My time is over. It will be a good death. Carry a message for me, soldier.

Our base flies out of reach of [[Scourge]] - overhead between Mord'rethar and Aldur'thar. It is called "[[Orgrim's Hammer]]."

<Hork futilely attempts to salute.>

Fly high and avoid the [[Alliance]] juggernaut, Skybreaker. Tell Korm... tell him I died... fighting... For the [[Horde]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5450 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|3|27}} at max level)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Completion==
<Korm salutes.>

Damn the [[Scourge]] and damn the [[Alliance]]! Hork was one of our best. We will have our revenge. For Hellscream and for the [[Horde]]!
