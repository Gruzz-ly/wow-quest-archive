==Objectives==
Return to [[Highlord Tirion Fordring]] at [[Crusaders' Pinnacle]] with news of [[:Emerald Acorn]]'s effects. 

==Description==
I feel refreshed... renewed... but the [[Plague of Undeath|plague]] still grips me. Not to worry, I am still eternally grateful that you went to such lengths for me, a complete stranger. If nothing else, you've bought me a few more precious hours not plaguing the world as a hideous undead.

Thank you, <class>. Please extend my thanks to Tirion as well, and let him know that it has been an honor to serve beside him. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||74}}

==Completion==
It saddens me to hear that it did not work. No reason to fret though, I have met other beings of good that may still be of aid to us.

==Progression==
{{:A Tale of Valor}}
