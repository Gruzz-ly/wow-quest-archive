== Objectives ==
Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar wants you to speak with Chief Engineer Copperclaw aboard Orgrim's Hammer.

== Description ==
Goblins! Hyper little busy-bodies...

Listen, <name>. Copperclaw, our resident engineer, is insisting that he's got something useful to show me.

I'm in no mood to endure his squeaky nagging. The last time I acknowledged him, he chirped on for an hour straight. It was all I could do to keep from drop-kicking him into Sindragosa's Fall!

You go in my place and humor him. Let me know if indeed he's on to anything.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||74|}}

== Completion ==
Too busy? Phooey! This baby flies herself!

Nevermind that. You'll do...
