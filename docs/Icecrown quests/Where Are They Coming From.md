==Objectives==
Investigate a Summoning Altar in the eastern part of the [[Fleshwerks]], then report back to [[Darkrider Arly]] at [[Blackwatch]].
* Summoning Altar investigated

==Description==
The [[Lich King]]'s tireless minions labor away night and day to assemble scores of [[abomination]]s and [[flesh giant]]s down there in the Fleshwerks.

Yet, that is not enough. More and more [[Skeletal Constructor|skeletal constructors]] keep appearing to increase the pace of work.

If we do not discover where they're coming from and how they're able to work so quickly, we'll be overrun before we can act in force. Search to the southeast and see if you can find the source of these skeletons.

==Progress==
Have you found the source of the [[skeleton]]s?

==Completion==
<You tell the darkrider about your discoveries at the summoning altar.>

I suspected such. We can't let this continue. Our first priority is to destroy those summoning altars and then deal with the mess the Scourge has already created here.

==Notes==
The altars are south of Blackwatch along the path to Corp'rethar at {{coords|37|71|Icecrown}}

Use an altar to summon a [[Skeletal Constructor]].
