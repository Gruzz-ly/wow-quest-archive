== Objectives ==
Report to [[Siegemaster Fezzik]] at the [[Argent Vanguard]] in [[Icecrown]]. 

== Description ==
The chill of death stirs in the west, threatening to freeze our hearts and souls to this wasteland and bind us to its dark master. We will stand and we will fight!

The preparations have begun. Report to Siegemaster Fezzik at the front gate for your assignment.

== Completion ==
We must be quick or face being overtaken by the [[Scourge]]! There's really no time for instructions, <race>. You're just going to have to jump in and hope for the best.

== Notes ==
Fezzik can be found at {{coords|85.6|76.0|Icecrown}}.

Completing this quest puts players in another phase, this one full of [[Frostbrood Destroyer]]s besieging the vanguard.
