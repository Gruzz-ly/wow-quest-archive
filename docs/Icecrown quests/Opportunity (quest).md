== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Sergeant Kregga]] below [[Icecrown Citadel]]. 

== Description ==
We recently came upon schematics that indicate a weakness in Icecrown Citadel. An opening in its defenses, both figuratively and literally.

The captured diagrams show an orifice leading several hundred feet into the ground. We're unsure of its purpose, but our scouting has revealed it to be of high importance to the [[Scourge]].

Speak to Sergeant Kregga below Icecrown Citadel, she's leading the attack on the site. 

== Completion ==
Just in time, <name>.  Koltira spoke highly of you.  Perhaps you'll be able to push the scales in our favor.

== Notes ==
The completion of [[The Shadow Vault (Horde)]] is a prerequisite for Koltira to offer this quest.

Kregga is found under Icecrown Citadel, there are holes down to the area on each side of the main staircase leading to the Citadel proper.
