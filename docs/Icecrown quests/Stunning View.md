==Objectives==
[[Vereth the Cunning]] at the [[Rise of Suffering]] wants you to use a [[Lithe Stalker]]'s heave ability to destroy 12 sleeping Iceskin Sentries.
* [[Iceskin Sentry]] destroyed (12)

==Description==
[[Gargoyle]]s make effective scouts and can be deadly if left to rain attacks from the air, but they have a very obvious weakness. Most of them have to go through long periods resting as stone to maintain the energy they need to carry their heavy bodies through the air.

As I peered through the eye you were using, I noticed dozens of iceskin sentries resting on the eastern and southern walls inside. Use the stalker to leap up to their ledges and devastate them while they sleep. 

==Progress==
Almost too easy.

==Completion==
Not so much of a threat when they're sleeping.

==Notes==
More often than not the heave will destroy the gargoyle. Occasionally they'll wake up and just hover there.

==Progression==
