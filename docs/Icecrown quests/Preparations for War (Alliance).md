==Objectives==
Speak to [[Officer Van Rossem]]{{coords|67.7|47.2|Dalaran}} to secure passage to the ''[[Skybreaker]]'' in [[Icecrown]], and then report to [[High Captain Justin Bartlett]].

==Description==
You there!

You look like you have some wits about you. We could use some more able bodies in Icecrown.

You may have heard rumors of our [[Return To Angrathar (Alliance)|failure in assaulting the glacier]] from the ground, but let me set those concerns to rest. We're now mounting our assault from one of the most advanced pieces of engineering known to [[Azeroth]], the ''Skybreaker''. The [[Horde]] don't stand a chance, and neither does [[Arthas Menethil|Arthas]].

Speak to me when you're ready to depart.

==Completion==
Welcome to the ''Skybreaker''.

From here we are laying our groundwork for the assault on Arthas. There's a lot of work to be done, but before we can get into the real meat of it, we want to make sure that the [[Argent Crusade]] is adequately reinforced - we're going to need their help later.

If you have not already, speak to [[Absalan the Pious]] on the main deck.

==Notes==
Tell Officer Van Rossem "Take me to the ship." to head up there on a [[Skybreaker Cloudbuster]].

On the way, some level 80 elite [[Frost Drake]]s will try to attack.

Bartlett is one deck down from where the gyro will drop players off.
