==Objectives==
Speak with [[The Bone Witch]] within the cave at [[Njorndar Village]]. 

==Description==
You remember [[Lady Nightswood]], don't you? She certainly remembers you. She's the forlorn and very angry [[banshee]] that you 'saved' when you also broke [[Vile]] and myself out from under the [[Lich King]]'s dominion.

The lady has gone into [[Jotunheim]] and possessed their bone witch. She intends to wreak havoc upon the [[vrykul]] from within.

She has asked that you seek her out. You'll find her in the cave on the south side of Njorndar Village to the southwest within Jotunheim. 

==Completion==
<name>, you came.

Already I have heard of your activities on the [[Savage Ledge]]. This is good. I am glad that you seem willing to help with undermining the vrykul here at Jotunheim.

<The face of the witch breaks into a reluctant grin as if she's fighting the will of Lady Nightswood.>

You and I are going to have a great deal of fun with them!

==Notes==
The entrance to the cave is located where the split in the path at Jotunheim is at its widest on the east path at {{coords|32.5|42.9|Icecrown}}.

Just to the northeast of the pen of frost revenants.


She refers to the quest [[Honor Challenge]], which you may not have completed yet, or perhaps [[Eliminate the Competition]], which you have.
