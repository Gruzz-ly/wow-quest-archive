==Objectives==
Speak to [[Highlord Tirion Fordring]] at the [[Crusader's Pinnacle]].

==Description==
There were rumors about the events you speak of among the death knights. I always expected the story to be more... symbolic.

We must warn others, but we must be discreet. As soon as the [[Lich King]] knows we're making our move, he'll move the location of the heart—we'll never get a chance like this again.

The Horde and the Alliance have been infiltrated by the [[Cult of the Damned]] before. The [[Knights of the Ebon Blade|Ebon Blade]] operates too close to the [[Scourge]].

We have to speak to Tirion Fordring and his [[Argent Crusade]].

==Completion==
Heavy words, <name>. If it were somebody else saying them, I'd be likely to judge them insane.
