==Objectives==
[[Sergeant Kregga]] at [[Icecrown Citadel]] wants you to slay 10 Hulking Horrors.
*[[Hulking Horror]] slain (10)

==Description==
We've one shot at dealing some damage to this place—let's make sure we get it right.

We've acquired potent, [[Scourge]]-made, saronite bombs. But we must secure this area before we can set them off.

We're going to need to get the Scourge defenses under control quickly, before reinforcements arrive.

Help my men out and come back when you're ready for some fireworks.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Shock-Proof Head Protector
|Hulking Horror Tunic
|Gloves of the Mad Bomber
|Icewalker's Spikes}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Progress==
For honor, <name>.

==Completion==
You made quick work of the Scourge, <name>. Let's finish what we came to do here.

==Progression==
{{:A Short Fuse}}
