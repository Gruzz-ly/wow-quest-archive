==Objectives==
[[Koltira Deathweaver|Koltira]] aboard [[Orgrim's Hammer]] wants you to use the Partitioned Flask at each of the 3 [[Cult of the Damned|cultists']] [[Plague cauldron|cauldrons]]{{coords|48|34|Icecrown}} at [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]], then bring it to [[Chief Engineer Copperclaw]].
*Blue Sample Collected
*Green Sample Collected
*Dark Sample Collected
*[[Partitioned Flask]] (provided)

==Description==
I smell their cauldrons from here, but that's not plague they're cooking.

Pledges to the cult are forced to drink a concoction that steals their will and enslaves them forever to the [[Lich King]].

Some say the potion contains the twisted soul of a being who was tormented before being mercilessly slaughtered, but I've never been able to reproduce it...

Fill this flask with a sample from each of the three cauldrons in the northwest region of the gate and bring it to Chief Engineer Copperclaw. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Progress==
Whatdya got there, <class>?

==Completion==
<Copperclaw pours the content of the flask into his particle analyzer.>

Ahh... I know just the thing!
