This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

== Objectives ==
Temper the [[Reforged Quel'Delar]] in the {{NPC||Crucible of Souls}}.
* [[Tempered Quel'Delar]]

== Description ==
At last, the pieces of [[Quel'Delar]] are rejoined and the blade is whole, but it cannot see battle until you have tempered it. That jagged [[saronite]] edge is brittle and will shatter the moment it strikes anything.

Deep in [[Icecrown Citadel]]'s [[Forge of Souls]] is a place where the blade can safely be tempered. Take Quel'Delar with you to the abode of the {{NPC||Devourer of Souls||Overseer of Souls}} and look for the crucible. Plunge the blade into the crucible to temper it and bring it back to me. 

* [[Reforged Quel'Delar]] (provided)

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

== Progress ==
Until the sword is tempered, it will be useless.

== Completion ==
I... I don't understand. Tempering the sword should've restored the blade to its original condition. What has happened here?

== Notes ==
The Crucible of Souls is at the very end of the instance.  Simply Use the reforged quel'delar, and get the Tempered quel'delar in return.

== Patch changes ==
* {{patch 3.3.0|note=Added.}}
