==Objectives==
Return to [[Crusader Bridenbrad]] in [[Icecrown]] with the Emerald Acorn.
* [[Emerald Acorn]] (provided)

==Description==
I shall open a portal to take you back to [[Arch Druid Lilliandra|the druid that brought you here]]. You and your crusader have my well wishes. I hope that this acorn is able to purify your crusader and save him from the wretched fate of the plague.

Farewell, <race>.

==Progress==
Well met, <class>. I knew that you would return, despite my warnings, but I'm pleased that you heeded my desire to not risk anyone else.

Why have you come back to me?

==Completion==
Tirion sent you to [[Keeper Remulos|Remulos]]? I'm... I'm flattered. One does not call favors in with beings of such power idly, no matter how noble or altruistic they might be. You are too kind to have gone to such lengths on my behalf. You have my thanks.

Plant the seed - I am ready.

==Notes==
Before you leave, if you have something to do near [[Moonglade]], now would be a good time to do it. You can then taxi back to Moonglade and use your free teleport. Once you accept, you can ask to have your Moonglade Return Portal spawned in, which will do so to Remulos's right:

:{{gossip|I wish to return to [[Arch Druid]] Lilliandra. Can you send me back to her?}}

The portal will send the player back to {{coords|86|76|Icecrown}}, at the [[Argent Vanguard]]. If you happen to be mounted when you go through, you will show up dismounted in Icecrown.

This quest can be used by [[Druid]]s to make their [[Teleport: Moonglade]] into a "Teleport: Alliance Vanguard", if they chose not to complete it.
