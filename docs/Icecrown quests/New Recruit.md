==Objectives==
[[Vereth the Cunning]] on the [[Rise of Suffering]] has requested that you bring a subdued [[Lithe Stalker]] to the top of the rocks northeast of the [[Rise of Suffering]].
* [[Subdued Lithe Stalker]] Returned
* [[Sigil of the Ebon Blade]] (provided)

==Description==
First things first. I saw some Lithe Stalkers on the ramparts just east of us. They used to serve us before we broke with [[Arthas]], and they're about as perfect a scout as you can get... with a little prodding from an [[Eye of Dominion|eye of dominion]].

Fly up, find one of the stalkers, beat it down a bit, and then use this Sigil of the Ebon Blade to command its obedience. It will recognize the sigil, guaranteed. Lead it back to the top of the rocks northeast of here and it will find its way to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|92|50}}
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Knights of the Ebon Blade]]

==Progress==
I'm sure their masters don't go easy on them, but there's no way these things would forget the lessons we lashed into their skins. They'll fear those sigils for as long as they crawl this land.

==Completion==
I've chained the wretch to the post over there and I'll look into getting my hands on more of them.

Now let's make some use of that eye.

==Notes==
The Lithe Stalker [[geist]] can be found on the rampart above and to the east of Vereth's position. After weakening one and using the sigil to subdue it, run north towards the hill {{coords|55.3|70.3|Icecrown}} at the same level as the rampart.
