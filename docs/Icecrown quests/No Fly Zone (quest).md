==Objectives==
[[Uzo Deathcaller]] at [[Death's Rise]] wants you to kill 10 [[Onslaught Gryphon Rider]]s.
* [[Onslaught Gryphon Rider]] slain (10)
* [[Bone Gryphon]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that you got your bone gryphon, I wantcha to take it back down there everyday and make a no fly zone over [[Onslaught Harbor]].

I gotta admit, mon, I don't really care if you use the bone gryphon to kill them gryphon riders or not. But I'm guessin' that if you do, you'll find it much easier to get to 'em.

Besides, its got lots of neat tricks you can use.

==Progress==
What you back so soon for? I know I can still see those Onslaught boys still flyin' around down there!

==Completion==
That's the spirit! And you know, I need this one everyday that we're here.

I hope you'll come back tomorrow. Your bone gryphon will be waitin'.

==Notes==
Any class with heavy AoE, or tanking class may not need the bone gryphon to complete this quest, they may simply land on one of the towers and easily burn down or tank the Gryphon Riders.

==Progression==
