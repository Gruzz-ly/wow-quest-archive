==Objectives==
Deliver the Note from the Grand Admiral to [[Lord-Commander Arete]] at [[Death's Rise]].
* [[Note from the Grand Admiral]] (Provided)

==Description==
At first this note looks like any of the other intel that you've been looking for. However, a quick perusal of its contents disabuses you of this notion.

The letter conveys that [[Barean Westwind|Grand Admiral Westwind]] is present somewhere on the island, but that he is keeping himself secluded for now. He speaks of a glorious day that is coming soon in which the [[Scarlet Onslaught]] will wash over first the [[Lich King]] and then the rest of world to finally bring order to [[Azeroth]].

The lord-commander will want to see this! 

==Progress==
Scarlet Onslaught intel is to be delivered to [[Aurochs Grimbane]].

<The lord-commander gives you an expectant look by way of a dismissal.>

==Completion==
A note written by Westwind? Why didn't you say so?

<Arete tears the letter from your hand to read it.>

The fool! He's actually here?!

<The lord-commander laughs.>

This is new information. I wonder how he imagines that he's going to conquer the world once he's taken down the Lich King? Not that he could accomplish either task in his wildest imaginings.

==Notes==
The note will be in chests opened during the completion of [[Intelligence Gathering]].
