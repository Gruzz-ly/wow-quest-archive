== Objectives ==
[[Ground Commander Xutjja]] at the edge of the glacier north of [[Ymirheim]] has ordered you to use the [[Kor'kron Suppression Turret]] to keep the [[Kor'kron Troop Transport]] alive long enough to make all of its drops.
* [[Kor'kron Infiltrator]]s dropped (4)

== Description ==
Alright scrub, I've got something to keep you from being a complete waste.

A unit of highly trained infiltrators is ready to be dropped inside of Ymirheim. The vrykul inside have automated spear guns that have been ripping our transports to shreds, so we had the engineers on ''[[Orgrim's Hammer]]'' whip us up a suppression turret.

You're the gunner. Launch rounds at their spear guns to obscure their vision and clog their gears. See to it that my men all make their drops and the transport stays in one piece. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

== Completion ==
Only partly useless then. Good work.

== Notes ==
You will be controlling a turret mounted on an airplane which can fire three projectiles in rapid succession before requiring a break to refill energy. The goal is to hit the spear guns scattered throughout Ymirheim, which will prevent them from firing at you for 15 seconds. Aiming is difficult as you are anything but steady. Knowledge of where the turrets are and a good graphics card to support having Terrain Distance at maximum will help significantly.
