==Objectives==
Use the Death's Gaze Orb to place orbs on the [[Abomination]] Lab Orb Stand, the [[Flesh Giant]] Lab Orb Stand, and the [[Plague cauldron|Cauldron]] Area Orb Stand, then return to [[Darkrider Arly]] at [[Blackwatch]].
* Orb placed in abomination lab
* Orb placed in flesh giant lab
* Orb placed in cauldron area
* [[Death's Gaze Orb]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Fleshwerks]] is a vast operation, and it will be difficult to keep an eye on all that transpires there. Fortunately, I have a plan.

<Arly produces an orb from the folds of her cloak and shows it to you.>

This is a death's gaze orb. With it, we can observe the [[Scourge]]'s actions and decide how best to strike.

Place these orbs on the stands at three crucial areas—the abomination lab and the flesh giant lab to the southwest, along with the area surrounding the green cauldron far to the west.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}}
*22050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|13|23}} at 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Knights of the Ebon Blade]]

==Progress==
Have you placed those orbs?

==Completion==
<Darkrider Arly closes her eyes and seems to focus on something far away.>

With the eyes of death itself, I watch our enemy. With this knowledge, we will utterly destroy them.

==Notes==
There are small pillars with blue eyes on top of them at each of the three locations.
