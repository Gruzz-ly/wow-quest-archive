==Objectives==
[[Vaelen the Flayed]] at [[Shadow Vault (Icecrown)|The Shadow Vault]] wants you to free 8 [[Ebon Blade Prisoner]]s. They can be found in the cages throughout the greater [[Jotunheim]] region.
* [[Ebon Blade Prisoner]]s set free (8)

==Description==
Now that I'm back, I'm certain that [[Baron Sliver|the baron]] will want me to recover my men. I can see that we're barely hanging on here. The [[Lich King]]'s forces are about to break through and we won't be able to hold without my captured [[death knight]]s.

Can you assist me once more, <name>?

Go back to Jotunheim and let them out of those cages. Break the damn locks, I don't care what you have to do. The [[vrykul]] likely have the keys.

Just get my men free!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Shadow Vault Cowl
|Gloves of the Flayed
|Links of the Battlemender
|Ebon Pauldrons}}

==Progress==
Certainly there are more of my death knights to be loosed from their cages?!

==Completion==
Thank you, <class>. With the death knights that you freed, we'll be able to hold the line... for now.

==Notes==
After freeing a prisoner, the death knight will follow the player for a few minutes.

==It gets the Key==
During the quest, [[Ebon Blade Prisoner]] may say ''"It gets the key. It comes here. It opens the lock."'' which is a reference to {{wplink|The Silence of the Lambs}} by the way the antagonist, ''Buffalo Bill'', speaks to his victims.
