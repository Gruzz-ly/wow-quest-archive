Text of this quest to the contrary, this is not a daily quest.

The quest [[Let the Baron Know]] is a prerequisite for this.
== Objectives ==
[[Duke Lankral]] at [[Shadow Vault (Icecrown)|The Shadow Vault]] wants you to burn 10 [[Vrykul Banner]]s.
* [[Vrykul Banner]]s burned (10)

== Description ==
Let us see if we can further weaken the resolve of the [[vrykul]], <name>.

Each day I wish you to travel to Jotunheim and put their banners to the torch. It may seem a trivial thing, but to see their ancestral home vandalized on a daily basis will demoralize them more than any physical punishment you can inflict.

At least... it can't hurt.

== Progress ==
You have more work to do.

== Completion ==
<The duke looks at you a moment and nods.>

You're inflicting horrible mental trauma on the Jotunheim vrykul. This is where they were first reawakened. It is a place of significant importance to them, second only to [[Ymirheim]].

You must keep up the pressure there while I hold the vault from the assault of the [[Lich King]].
