==Objectives==
[[Koltira Deathweaver]] aboard [[Orgrim's Hammer]] wants you to go the [[Broken Front]] and defeat 5 Hulking Abominations, 5 Malefic Necromancers, and 5 Shadow Adepts.
*[[Hulking Abomination]]s Slain (5)
*[[Malefic Necromancer]]s Slain (5)
*[[Shadow Adept]]s Slain (5)

==Description==
While your commander has his focus diluted by his loathing of your Alliance rivals, you can depend on me to direct my attention squarely on the real enemy here - the [[Lich King]] and his minions.

In order to hold any hope of conquering him at the [[Icecrown Citadel|citadel]], your people must take and hold each gate.

For now, let us focus on the first. Return to the front and prod their defenses. Look for any sign of weakness that we might exploit.

I'll await your report, <class>. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ring of the Fallen Shadow Adept
|Hulking Abomination Hide Cloak
|Amulet of the Malefic Necromancer}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Progress==
Well, <race>?

What have you learned?

==Completion==
Really, <class>?

Nothing notable to report?

<Koltira notices the abomination remains splattered across your clothes and smiles.>

I beg to differ...

==Progression==
