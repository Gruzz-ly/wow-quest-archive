==Objectives==
[[Lord-Commander Arete]] at [[Death's Rise]] wants you to beat information out of Captains Welsington and Hartford.
* [[Captain Welsington]] beaten for information and killed
* [[Captain Hartford (Icecrown)|Captain Hartford]] beaten for information and killed

==Description==
If anyone knows where the [[Barean Westwind|admiral]] is, then surely it must be his captains on the ships in [[Onslaught Harbor]].

<The lord-commander rubs his hands together.>

Welsington and Hartford are their names if memory serves. Go beat the information out of them and then end their miserable lives.

I want to know where the grand admiral is hidden!
