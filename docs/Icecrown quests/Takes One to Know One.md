== Objectives ==
[[Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar|Sky-Reaver Korm]] wants you to speak to [[Koltira Deathweaver]] on [[Orgrim's Hammer]]. 

== Description ==
While we should never miss an opportunity to strike out against the [[Alliance]], we mustn't forget about the [[Scourge]].

We won't have the numbers here to make a proper assault in the glacier for weeks, but that won't keep us from learning all we can know about their defenses.

I have asked our resident death knight to advise you in this effort. After all, who better knows this enemy than they?

Allow me to introduce, Koltira Deathweaver. 

== Completion ==
<Koltira looks you up and down.>

I hope for your sake that you're up to this, <class>.

==Progression==
{{Mord'rethar: The Death Gate (Horde)}}
