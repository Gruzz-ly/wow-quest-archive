==Objectives==
[[Koltira Deathweaver]] aboard [[Orgrim's Hammer]] wants you to use [[Pustulant Spinal Fluid]] on a plague cauldron at [[Mord'rethar: The Death Gate|Mord'rethar]].
* Plague Cauldron Neutralized
* Suggested Players [5]
* [[Pustulant Spinal Fluid]] (provided)

==Description==
<Koltira takes the [[Pustulant Spine|Pustulent Spine]]s and drains their fluid into a flask.>

A little-know quality of the [[flesh giant]]s...

Their spinal fluid interacts with the plague in a very interesting way, turning it into a corrosive acid.

Poured from the towering ramparts, acid may not be a welcome sight to the troops below, but at least the victims won't rise up and add to the enemy's numbers.

Pour the contents of this flask into one of the plague cauldrons in the western chamber of the death gate. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Newt-Eye Ring
|Frog-Toe Band
|Bat-Wool Signet}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Completion==
Well done, <class>.

Perhaps with some investigation, we can discover how they are bringing such a creature into existence.

==Notes==
Not soloable. You will a minimum of three players also on the quest, four in case of a mistake.

The entrance to Mord'rethar is at the western end of the death gate at {{coords|63|62|Icecrown}}. Go inside and pick a cauldron, clearing out the trash to and around it. Choose one player to channel their Pustulent Spinal Fluid into the cauldron, which will spawn one elite and a few regular adds out of the cauldron. Elite hits on cloth are ~1000. After killing the mobs, another player must be chosen ahead of time to channel their Fluid when the cauldron requires it.

Channeling a Fluid will begin its cooldown, which is at least 1 min, 30 secs. The cauldron will need a Fluid sooner than this, which requires at least three players. The cauldron will accept two Fluids at the same time, but only one will register, thus wasting one channeling attempt. The regular trash inside Mord'rethar will also likely respawn at least once and should be taken down immediately to minimise interference.
