==Objectives==
[[Chief Engineer Boltwrench]] aboard the [[Skybreaker]] wants you to drink the Diluted Cult Tonic, kill any Cultists at [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]] and take their [[Tainted Essence]]s. You are then to combine 10 of the essences into a [[Writhing Mass]] and throw it into any of their cauldrons.
*Writhing Mass Banished
*[[Diluted Cult Tonic]] (provided)

==Description==
Those twisted cultists are looking for souls to put in their crazy-juice? Then let's help 'em out a bit!

Take a swig of this - don't worry, I've diluted it plenty... I'm almost positive that its only effect will be to detect any cultist's essence.

Once you've collected a bunch of 'em, throw the writhing mass of twisted souls in one of their cauldrons.

Let's see how they like a taste of their own medicine!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Progress==
Well? How'd it turn out?

==Completion==
Wahoo!

That'll teach 'em!
