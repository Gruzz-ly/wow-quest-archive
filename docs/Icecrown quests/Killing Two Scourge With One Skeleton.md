==Objectives==
[[Darkrider Arly]] at [[Blackwatch]] wants you to destroy 3 Chained Abominations with [[Burning Skeleton]]s.
* [[Chained Abomination]]s burned (3)

==Description==
The workers in the [[Fleshwerks]] [[abomination]] lab have already completed a number of their creations. For now, the creatures are chained to the pillars around the edge of the lab, but if we do not act, they will march with the [[Lich King]]'s armies.

Grasping arms reach out of the bone piles spread throughout the Fleshwerks. These arms belong to [[skeleton]]s enchanted with the power of fire. Find and free these skeletons, then take them near the completed abominations and watch the show!

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards: {{itembox| |Fleshwerk Shackles|Fleshwerk Wristguards|Flesh-Scaled Bracers|Hardened Bone Wrist Protectors}}

==Progress==
Have you destroyed the completed abominations?

==Completion==
Ah, good. There's nothing like the smell of roasted putrid flesh in the morning. That's the smell of victory over the [[Scourge]].

==Notes==
There are green Grasping Arms all over the Fleshwerks. Find one, get on a land mount and drag it down to the aboms. Kaboom. Rinse and repeat.

On Completion:
:{{text|say|'''[[Crusader Olakin Sainrith]] says:''' Look! What's a [[frost wyrm|frostwyrm]] doing here? It's coming straight for us.}}
:{{text|say|'''[[Ghostwing]] says:''' Destroy our raw materials, will you? Well, the master has a special plan in mind for you...}}
:''Ghostwing snatches Olakin off the ledge and takes off with him.''
:{{text|say|'''Darkrider Arly says:''' Damn it, Olakin, get your arse back here! There's work to be done!}}

Darkrider Arly's completion comment is a reference to a line from the movie {{wplink|Apocalypse_Now}}: "I love the smell of napalm in the morning..." (See also [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/quotes here] for a more complete version of the quote.)
