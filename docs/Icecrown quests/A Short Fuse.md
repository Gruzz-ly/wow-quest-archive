== Objectives ==
Look for clues wherever the fall takes you. 

== Description ==
As you light the fuse, you notice that it is consumed by fire far quicker than you would expect.

The bombs are about to go off and your best chance at surviving is to lean towards the pit and hope the fall doesn't kill you. 

== Completion ==
This pulsing object is covered in a thick layer of ice. It shimmers strangely beneath the water.

== Notes ==
Players will automatically jump into the pit and safely fall into some water in [[Naz'anak: The Forgotten Depths]].

In the water not too far north of where players land is a [[Pulsing Crystal]].
