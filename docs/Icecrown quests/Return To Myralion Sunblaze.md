This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

== Objectives ==
Bring [[:Ancient Dragonforged Blades]] to [[Myralion Sunblaze]] at [[Quel'Delar's Rest]].
* [[Ancient Dragonforged Blades]] (provided)

== Description ==
We must get this book to Myralion Sunblade{{sic}}. Would you bring it to him? I cannot rely on anyone else to transport the book and you have proven adept at evading the [[Silver Covenant]]'s men.

Take it with you to Quel'Delar's Rest, south of the [[Argent Tournament Grounds]] in [[Icecrown]]. Myralion will be waiting for you. If he can identify that blade, we may be able to claim it in the name of [[Aethas Sunreaver]] and show [[Dalaran]] and the Alliance that we will lead the charge against the [[Lich King]].

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|3|70}}

== Progress ==
We've been expecting your return. What has kept you? 

== Completion ==
<Myralion accepts the heavy book and begins leafing through it.>

Those symbols on the blade seemed familiar and now there's little wonder why. This is certainly a dragon blade, gifted to one of the mortal races, but which blade is this, and how did it come to rest in [[Icecrown]]?

== Notes ==
On completion:
:{{text|say|Myralion Sunblaze|The style of this blade and its markings hinted that it might be a dragonforged sword. At last, we will have our answer.}}
:{{text|say|Myralion Sunblaze|After all these years, can it really be --}}
:''[[Lana'thel]] appears out of nowhere walking up to Quel'Delar from the southwest. The four sentinels and war mages rush to the sword.''
:{{text|say|Silver Covenant Sentinel|You are not welcome here, minion of the [[Lich King]]!}}
:{{text|say|Blood-Queen Lana'thel|[[Quel'Delar]].}}
:''Lana'thel freezes the war mages and sentinels surrounding the sword.''
:{{text|say|Blood-Queen Lana'thel|Quiet, fools. If I had wished to kill you, you'd already be dead.}}
:''While Lana'thel speaks, images of what she talks about appear just north of the blade.''
:{{text|say|Blood-Queen Lana'thel|As [[:Quel'Serrar]] was forged by the dragons and given to the [[kaldorei]], its twin, Quel'Delar, was given to [[blood elf|my people]].}}
:{{text|say|Blood-Queen Lana'thel|The king bestowed the blade upon my friend, {{NPC||Thalorien Dawnseeker}}.}}
:{{text|say|Blood-Queen Lana'thel|But even Thalorien's skill and Quel'Delar's magic could not save [[Silvermoon]] from the might of the [[Scourge]].}}
:{{text|say|Blood-Queen Lana'thel|Thalorien fell before the gates of the [[Sunwell]], buying time for others to escape.}}
:''Lana'thel walks north and kneels down to inspect the image of Thalorien.''
:{{text|say|Blood-Queen Lana'thel|After the battle, I recovered the sword from the field. I bore it to [[Northrend]] in the service of [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|my prince]], seeking to avenge our people's defeat.}}
:{{text|say|Blood-Queen Lana'thel|[[Arthas Menethil|Arthas]] shattered our forces and took the most powerful of us into his service as the [[San'layn]].}}
:{{text|say|Blood-Queen Lana'thel|My memories of Thalorien went cold and so did his blade.}}
:{{text|say|Blood-Queen Lana'thel|It was I who brought Quel'Delar here, to return it to its makers. In breaking the weapon, so did I break its power.}}
:{{text|say|Blood-Queen Lana'thel|Quel'Delar will never serve another!}}
:''The freeze fades and Lana'thel appears to cast some spell on Quel'Delar, disappearing once again.''
:{{text|say|Myralion Sunblaze|It falls to us to see Quel'Delar restored for the Sunreavers.
}}

==Trivia==
*During Lana'thel's reiteration of the events surrounding Quel'Delar, a number of the relevant characters can be seen in ghostly forms around Quel'Delar's Rest: [[Anasterian Sunstrider|King Anasterian Sunstrider]] receiving the blade from [[Alexstrasza the Life-Binder]]; the king handing it to [[Thalorien Dawnseeker]]; Lana'thel in her elven form, and her death against the [[Lich King]].
