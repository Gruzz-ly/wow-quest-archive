==Objectives==
Speak to [[Matthias Lehner]] at the [[Court of Bones]]. 

==Description==
You have a lot of questions, <name>. You're the only one who can see me because you touched [[Pulsing Crystal|something]] that once belonged to [[Arthas Menethil|him]]... don't you remember?

You don't know what it is? Well I can't just tell you... that would make him really mad. He's not just a prince anymore... he's [[Lich King|the king]]!

Meet me at the Court of Bones, north of [[Icecrown Citadel]] and you can see for yourself.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|90}}

==Completion==
There you are. I started to wonder whether you'd show up.

==Notes==
Matthias Lehner can be found on the path between Corp'rethar and Icecrown Citadel at {{coords|49.2|73.1|Icecrown}}. You should be able to see him from the [[Argent Crusade]] encampment there.

==Progression==
{{:Where Dragons Fell}}
