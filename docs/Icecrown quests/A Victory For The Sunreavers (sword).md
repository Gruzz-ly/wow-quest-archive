This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Bring the Restored Quel'Delar to {{NPC||Archmage Aethas Sunreaver}} at the [[Violet Citadel]] in [[Dalaran]].
*[[Restored Quel'Delar]] (provided)

==Description==
At last, [[Quel'Delar]] is restored for the glory of the Sunreavers and the [[Horde]]! This is a blessing for our efforts against the [[Lich King]].

Archmage [[Aethas Sunreaver]], the leader of the [[Sunreavers]], asked to see you after you returned from the [[Sunwell]]. Travel to the Violet Citadel in Dalaran as soon as you can, <name> and bring Quel'Delar with you. The archmage wishes to congratulate you personally!

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox| |Quel'Delar, Might of the Faithful|Quel'Delar, Ferocity of the Scorned|Quel'Delar, Cunning of the Shadows|Quel'Delar, Lens of the Mind}}

==Progress==
Is it true that you have restored Quel'Delar?

==Completion==
Quel'Delar rises again, as the sin'dorei have risen from the ashes of defeat and betrayal. Yet, somehow, the weapon of [[Thalorien Dawnseeker]] has chosen to serve an outsider.

Be at ease, <name>. I do not mean to diminish your accomplishment, for you have done what none of my brothers could, although I do not know why. You are clearly meant to be its bearer; the blade is already adapting itself to your abilities. Wield Quel'Delar proudly against our common foes.

==Gains==
[[The Sword in the Skull]]

==Notes==
On completion:
:{{text|yell|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|As the leader of the Sunreavers, it is with great pride that I present <name> as the new bearer of Quel'Delar!}}
