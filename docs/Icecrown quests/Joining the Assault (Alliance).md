==Objectives==
Report to [[Ground Commander Koup]] at the edge of the glacier east of [[Ymirheim]]. 

==Description==
We need more men to join the main assault on Ymirheim.

Any warrior with half a brain can tell you that [[vrykul]] are fierce fighters and should not be taken lightly. That goes two-fold for the Ymirjar. They have shown no restraint in proving to us why the [[Lich King]] deemed them worthy.

Ground Commander Koup is overseeing the assault. The city itself is located in the center of [[Icecrown]] - Koup's troops at positioned near the edge of the glacier, east of the city. 

==Completion==
Welcome to hell, soldier.

My men are leading the assault on the gate from this position, and we're dropping some infiltrators in the city via air - we need more people on both fronts. I have a feeling that this attack will be going on for some time.

==Notes==
Loook on the ground level just east of the black dots on the map east of the word "Ymirheim". Koup stands at {{coords|62.6|51.3|Icecrown}}
