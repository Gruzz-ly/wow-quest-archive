This quest makes available the chain starting with [[Sneak Preview (Alliance)]].

==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]] on the [[Skybreaker]] wants you to use the Abomination Reanimation Kit to create a [[Reanimated Abomination]], which you are to use to kill 15 Icy Ghouls, 15 Vicious Geists, and 15 Risen Alliance Soldiers.
* [[Icy Ghoul|Icy Ghouls]] Exploded (15)
* [[Vicious Geist|Vicious Geists]] Exploded (15)
* [[Risen Alliance Soldier|Risen Alliance Soldiers]] Exploded (15)
* [[Abomination Reanimation Kit]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Abomination]]s...

They can be a very capable enemy. I've seen them turn the tide of battle more than once. What few realize, is that they can also be very capable friends.

They are not deep thinkers. If you know the secrets of their creation, you can issue them basic orders that they will not question.

Fortunately for you, I know these secrets.

This kit will reanimate the remains of the abominations you defeat. Take it, and learn to use them against the scourge on the death gate. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Slippers of the Broken Front|Mantle of Reanimation|Geist Stalker Leggings|Scourgebane Pauldrons}}

==Progress==
Well, <race>?

Did your abomination friends prove effective?

==Completion==
You see, <class>?

Ingenuity can sometimes even the odds against a seemingly overwhelming enemy.

== Notes ==
Kill abominations for their [[Chilled Abomination Guts]] and then create the [[Reanimated Abomination]] and send it in.

See [[Reanimated Abomination]] for details on its use.
