==Objectives==
Speak with [[Vaelen the Flayed]] at [[Shadow Vault (Icecrown)|The Shadow Vault]].

I just saw that incompetent fool, Vaelen the Flayed, sneak into the vault building.

Go see to it that he rectifies his mistake and returns my death knights to me!

==Completion==
I think I can guess why you're here, <name>.

==Notes==
[[Let the Baron Know]] is a prerequisite for this quest.

Vaelen is found to the left as you enter.
