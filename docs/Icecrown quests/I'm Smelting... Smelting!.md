==Objectives==
Use the Bag of Jagged Shards near one of the [[Malykriss: The Vile Hold|Malykriss]] furnaces. Return to [[Crusader Olakin Sainrith]] at [[Blackwatch]] with the Smelted Metal Bar.
*[[Smelted Metal Bar]]
*[[Bag of Jagged Shards]] (provided)

==Description==
<Olakin turns one of the shards over in an armored fist.>

These could pierce armor with enough force. We have to find out what they're made of and what the [[Lich King]] intends to do with them.

To the east, nestled next to [[Icecrown Citadel]] itself, lies Malykriss. From the few reports we have, it's full of smelting and smithing equipment. Bring these shards there, and smelt them in one of the open furnaces at Malykriss. Once the metal has been melted down and reformed, we can identify it. 

==Progress==
Have you smelted those fragments yet?

==Completion==
There is no doubt, this is raw [[saronite]]. We've seen weapons made from it in the hands of the Lich King's chosen before, but this is the first time it's been used to arm anything else. The scale of that mining operation must be huge.

==Notes and trivia==
There are three furnaces on the lower level and four more higher up with circling gouts of flame coming out of them. Walk next to one of the furnaces and use the bag to smelt them into a bar.

Go east of Corp'Rethar.

The quest title is a play on the line from {{wplink|The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz}} where the wicked witch of the west has water splashed on her.
