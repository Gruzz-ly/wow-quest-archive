==Objectives==
Kill Archbishop Landgren and then summon [[Arete's Gate]] in the presence of his corpse. Speak with [[Lord-Commander Arete]] inside [[Crimson Cathedral]] once he's completed his questioning of the archbishop's spirit.
* [[Archbishop Landgren]] slain
* Arete's Gate summoned
Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
I'd heard they have an archbishop in their cathedral, but I had no idea that they'd resurrected and promoted Landgren! The Crimson Cathedral is heavily guarded with only one entrance, so you'll need help.

We still need to know where the [[Barean Westwind|grand admiral]] is, but this time we're not taking any chances!

Take this device. It can be used to summon a gate for me to step through once you've killed the archbishop.

I'll have my answers directly from his compelled soul! We will find Grand Admiral Westwind! 

==Completion==
[[Hidden Hollow|Hidden caves]] on the backside of the island. How very interesting.

Well, at least now I know where all of my [[Captured Death's Rise Spy|missing spies]] are.

==Notes==
Landgren is in the cathedral, which is carpeted by mobs. Take a group. Landgren now has 302,000 HP and 79,880 MP and will cast [[Shadow Word: Pain]] on each group member. If you don't have any heals, your only choice is to take him down with overwhelming DPS. He is flanked by two guards, but they are very easily killed. Do so, then take him down.

At 50% health
:{{text|yell|Archbishop Landgren|I will not die so quickly [[A Fall From Grace|this time]]!}}

Once he's dead, summon Arete's Gate (a [[Death Gate]]) and he'll step through it.
:{{text|say|Lord-Commander Arete|Well done. Let's get this over with.}}
:''Arete walks up to Landgren's corpse.''
:{{text|say|Lord-Commander Arete|Come, Landgren, cough up your soul so that I can ask you a very important question.}}
:''Arete channels a short spell onto Landgren's corpse and pulls out Landgren's Soul, which hovers in the air above your heads.''
:{{text|say|Landgren's Soul|You'll get nothing out of me, monster. I am beyond your ability to influence.}}
:{{text|yell|Lord-Commander Arete|YOU WILL TELL ME WHERE [[Barean Westwind|WESTWIND]] IS OR I WILL DESTROY YOUR SOUL!}}
:{{text|say|Landgren's Soul|No.}}
:{{text|say|Lord-Commander Arete|Then you leave me no choice. I won't say that I won't enjoy this.}}
:''Arete channels another spell, tourturing the captive soul. Only moments later:''
:{{text|say|Landgren's Soul|STOP! It isn't worth it. I'll tell you where he is.}}
:{{text|say|Lord-Commander Arete|Very well. Tell me!}}
:{{text|say|Landgren's Soul|On the south end of [[Onslaught Harbor|the island]] is a cave -- [[Hidden Hollow|a hidden hollow]]. The grand admiral has holed himself up in there, preparing for the final battle against the [[Lich King]].}}
:{{text|say|Lord-Commander Arete|A hidden hollow? How very interesting. You've served your purpose, Landgren, but I'm afraid there'll be no resurrection for you this time!}}
:''Arete uses the spell to finish off Landgren.''
:{{text|yell|Landgren's Soul|AAAEEEEIIIiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii........................................}}
:{{text|say|Lord-Commander Arete|Now that the unpleasantness is finished with, let's talk about you dealing with Grand Admiral Westwind.}}
