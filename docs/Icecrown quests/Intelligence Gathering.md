==Objectives==
[[Aurochs Grimbane]] at [[Death's Rise]] wants you to collect 5 Onslaught Intel Documents.
* [[Onslaught Intel Documents]] (5)

==Description==
I need to know what the [[Scarlet Onslaught]] is planning today. You will be my instrument in this task.

Fly to [[Onslaught Harbor]] and rifle through their baggage trunks for documents. The trunks will be locked, so you'll have to take the keys from the Scarlet Onslaught members by whatever means. 

==Progress==
You have information for me?

==Completion==
Hand them over. I will sift through the useless ones and if there's anything actionable, I will call upon you.

Either way, return tomorrow. It is well known that they change their plans on a daily basis.

==Notes==
While looting chests, the [[Note from the Grand Admiral]] stands a chance of being inside too, which starts [[The Grand (Admiral's) Plan]].

This can be a frustrating quest, as the keys have quite a low drop rate, and the chests also only have a chance of giving the intel documents.  These combined drop rates can make this quest take quite a long time.

==Progression==
