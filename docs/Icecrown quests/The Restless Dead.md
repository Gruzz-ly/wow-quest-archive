== Objectives ==
[[Father Gustav]] at the [[Valley of Echoes]] in Icecrown wants you to use Holy Water on the corpses of [[Reanimated Crusader]]s to free 10 restless souls.
* Restless Soul Freed (10)
*[[Holy Water]] (provided)

== Description ==
Not all of our soldiers made it out of [[Scourgeholme]]. Many were slain and turned into twisted reflections of their former selves. Such is the way of the Scourge. For those damned souls, there is no eternal peace. We must provide their souls rest.

Travel through the [[Breach (Icecrown)|Breach]] into Scourgeholme and slay the skeletal reanimated crusaders. Sprinkle this [[holy water]] on their bones so that their spirits may be freed.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Blade of Echoes
|The Argent Resolve
|Hand of Gustav
|Staff of Redeemed Souls
}}

== Progress ==
It is a grim task, <name>, but it must be done.

== Completion ==
The path of the righteous crusader is one beset by inequity and evil. To cut through the middle is the only salvation. You have done that on this day and much more.

== Notes ==
This quest combines well with [[The Scourgestone]] and [[The Purging Of Scourgeholme]], both from NPCs in the [[Valley of Echoes]] in [[Icecrown]].

==Progression==
{{:The Purging Of Scourgeholme}}
