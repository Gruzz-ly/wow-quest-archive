This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

== Objectives ==
Obtain the Sunreaver Orders.
* [[Sunreaver Orders]]

== Description ==
One of my contacts in the [[Underbelly]] caught sight of a [[Sunreaver Agent|Sunreaver agent]] buying reagents from a dealer in the [[Black Market (Dalaran)|Black Market]] area. The Sunreavers normally aren't known for their interest in what goes on down in the sewers, so that's a big indication that they're planning something.

Head into the Underbelly, find this Sunreaver agent, and take care of him. Search the body for any information that might give us a lead on the location of that tome from [[Wyrmrest Temple|Wyrmrest]]. We can't let them get it back to [[Icecrown]] first. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

== Progress ==
Did you find anything of use on that agent?

== Completion ==
<Arcanist Tybalin examines the captured orders.>

The agent you intercepted was supposed to transport the Wyrmrest Tome to [[Icecrown]], after meeting one {{NPC||Magister Hathorel}} in [[Sunreaver's Sanctuary]]. We have to get that book, <name>, and this is our chance. It's not going to be easy, though.

== Notes ==
Go down to the Black Market in the sewers. A hostile Sunreaver Agent awaits near [[Darahir]].
