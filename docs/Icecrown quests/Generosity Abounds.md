==Objectives==
[[Vereth the Cunning]] wants you to use the [[Lithe Stalker]]'s Iron Chain to drag Scourge Bombs to 4 [[Lumbering Atrocity|Lumbering Atrocities]] inside [[Malykriss: The Vile Hold|Malykriss]].
* [[Scourge Bomb]] gift delivered (4)

==Description==
We need to cause some disruption... anything to bring those [[death knight]]s away from their leaders. If we lay waste to their minions below, I suspect they'll have to devote more attention to keeping a close eye on operations.

[[Abomination]]s are easy prey - slow, predictable, and most importantly, stupid. Take advantage of their trust of the stalkers to drag them some of the scourge bombs scattered throughout the construction area. You'll be able to light the bombs far before they figure out what's going on. 

==Progress==
Did they even see it coming?

==Completion==
They didn't even think to lay a hand on you, did they? At least they're predictable.

==Notes==
A good location to complete this quest is at the very bottom of Malykriss between the forge and the rune camp.  The bombs can be found at {{coords|57.4|75.8|Icecrown}}
