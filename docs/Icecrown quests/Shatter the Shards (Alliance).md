* [[Broken Shard of Suffering]]
Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
Atop the battlements of [[Corp'rethar]], the [[Lich King]]'s minions have erected three crystals, the shards of horror, despair, and suffering. Should our men reach the walls of Corp'rethar, he will unleash these weapons on our army.

In full effect, the crystals will afflict the minds of our men with paralyzing pain and fear. Then, the [[Scourge]] will be able to slaughter them at will.

Find these shards, destroy them, and bring me their broken remains. We cannot allow the Lich King to deploy these weapons! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}} or {{cost|16|53}} at level 80
*27550 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Knights of the Ebon Blade]]

==Progress==
Have you shattered the Lich King's new weapons?

==Completion==
<Thassarian takes the crystal shards from you and speaks in a quiet voice.>

I remember these...

Lesser men would easily crumble beneath their assault. You have done well in removing their threat.

==Notes==
The Shard of Horror is on top of the ramparts at {{coords|47.7|68.6|Icecrown}}.
The Shard of Despair is on the floor below the top ramparts at {{coords|50|67.6|Icecrown}}.
The Shard of Suffering is on the same floor as the Shard of Despair at {{coords|46|70|Icecrown}}.
