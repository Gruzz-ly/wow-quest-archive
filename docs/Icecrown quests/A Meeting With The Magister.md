This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

== Objectives ==
Retrieve the Ancient Dragonforged Blades tome from [[Magister Hathorel]].
* [[Ancient Dragonforged Blades]]

== Description ==
I've placed an enchantment on the tabard that should allow you to slip past the [[Sunreaver's Sanctuary]]'s defenses for a short period of time. You should have enough time to find your way into [[The Filthy Animal]] and meet up with the Sunreaver contact there, one [[Magister Hathorel]].

Obtain the copy of Ancient Dragonforged Blades that his men borrowed from [[Wyrmrest Temple|Wyrmrest]] while your disguise holds, and return it to me. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5|80}}

== Progress ==
Have you recovered that book?

== Completion ==
Excellent work. Now that this is in our hands, we must get it to {{NPC||Caladis Brightspear}} as soon as possible. We can't risk the book falling back into Sunreaver hands.

I'll ensure that {{NPC||Shandy Glossgleam}} gets his tabard back without incident, along with a healthy reward for his help.

== Notes ==
The disguise (buff) will last 5 minutes.  This may be the one opportunity that Alliance characters have of seeing the interior of The Filthy Animal.

Jump down to street level, mount up, run across Dalaran to Sunreaver's Sanctuary. Take a right at the fork. The Filthy Animal is on the left. Run straight in towards the back of the room to find the only neutral NPC.


:Magister Hathorel: At last, you're here.  We have to get this tome to Icecrown as quickly as we can.
{{gossip|I'm ready to deliver the tome, Magister Hathorel.}}
:{{text|say|Magister Hathorel|You're late, courier. No, I don't want any excuses; this errand is far too important.}}
:{{text|say|Magister Hathorel|Here's the tome our representative brought from Wyrmrest. Get this to {{NPC||Myralion Sunblaze}} immediately.}}
:{{text|say|Magister Hathorel|Watch your back, courier. I needn't remind you of the value of the book, nor the fact that the Silver Covenant will stop at nothing to take it from us.}}

If, for some reason, you need another refresh of the tabard, speak to Tybalin again:

{{gossip|Would you renew my Sunreaver disguise?}}
