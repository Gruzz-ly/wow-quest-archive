==Objectives==
[[Knight-Captain Drosche]] on the [[Skybreaker]] has sent you to kill 20 [[vrykul]] in [[Ymirheim]].
* Ymirheim Vrykul (20)

==Description==
Those vrykul of that have gained the favor of the [[Lich King]] call themselves the Ymirjar. They inhabit a city in the center of [[Icecrown]]. We have a lot of preparations to make before we assault [[Icecrown Citadel]], and the one that stands before us now is routing these so-called "Chosen" of the Lich King.

Go to their city, Ymirheim, and slaughter them in their home. Let there be no questions as to who the stronger combatants are here. 

==Completion==
The traitor king will fall. Of that I have no doubt.

== Notes ==
Any vrykul within Ymirheim (except for the Val'kyr in the Saronite Mines) will count for this quest, including the ones that jump you while doing [[Assault by Ground (Alliance)]].
