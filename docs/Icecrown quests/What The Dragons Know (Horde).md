This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Krasus]] at the top of [[Wyrmrest Temple]].
* Ask Krasus about the hilt's origins

== Description ==
There's no mistaking it - this hilt comes from a powerful, ancient weapon, but which one? I do not recognize these particular markings, but we haven't hit a dead end yet.

Korialstrasz, better known as Krasus, has long been a friend to the [[quel'dorei]] and the [[Kirin Tor]]. With his vast knowledge and resources, he's certain to know something. Travel to the top of Wyrmrest Temple and seek his counsel, then report to Magister Hathorel inside Sunreaver's Sanctuary in Dalaran.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Progress==
The courier Myralion send said to expect you. What were you able to find out?

==Completion==
We must recover that book from the Silver Covenant. Without that book from Krasus, we stand little chance of solving the mystery of the sword in Icecrown or unlocking its power.

==Notes==
Speaking with Krasus during the quest will have this gossip:
:<The queen's consort nods in acknowledgment of your presence.>

:{{Gossip|What do you know of ancient swords?}}

The following scene will play out:
:{{text|say|Krasus|You're too late, <name>.  Another visitor from Dalaran came asking after information about the same [[Prismatic Blade|prismatic dragon blades]].}}
:{{text|say|Krasus|From your description, I'm certain that the book I loaned our visitor could allow you to easily identify the weapon.}}
:''[[Kalecgos]] walks toward the conversation, standing in front of [[Alexstrasza]] and Krasus.''
:{{text|say|Krasus|I'm afraid you'll have to ask the -- Well, perhaps Kalecgos can help.}}
:{{text|say|Krasus|<Name> may have found the remains of a prismatic blade, Kalecgos.  Will you offer your help to our visitor?}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Are you certain you should be helping these mortals in their quest for the sword?}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|These blades, Krasus... They were made long ago, when things were... different.}}
:{{text|say|Krasus|You believe our allies will not be able to control the power of the swords?}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Our enemies once turned [[Demon Soul|our strongest weapon]] against us. What makes you think the prismatic blades will be any different?}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Mortal champions have long used these weapons to combat evil. I see no reason to keep the swords from them in this battle.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|As you wish, my queen. I will not stand in their way, but I will keep a close watch.}}
:{{text|say|Krasus|As will we all.}}
:''Kalecgos walks back to his standing position.''
:{{text|say|Krasus|Please, mortal, seek out Magister Hathorel in Dalaran. He might be able to negotiate with the [[Silver Covenant]] for access to the book..}}
