This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Retrieve the Ancient Dragonforged Blades tome from [[Arcanist Tybalin]].
*[[Ancient Dragonforged Blades]]

==Description==
I've placed an enchantment on the tabard that should allow you to slip past the [[Silver Enclave]]'s defenses for a short period of time. You should have enough time to find your way up to the top level of the Silver Enclave and meet up with the Silver Covenant's man there, known as Arcanist Tybalin.

While disguised, obtain the copy of Ancient Dragonforged Blades that his men borrowed from [[Wyrmrest Temple|Wyrmrest]], and return the book to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|80}}

==Progress==
Did you recover the book from Wyrmrest? 

==Completion==
Excellent work. Now that this is in our hands, we must get it to [[Myralion Sunblaze]] as soon as possible. We can't risk the Silver Covenant taking the book from us again.

I'll get that tabard back to Shandy and see that he's well compensated for his assistance. Once the book is in Myralion's hands, the Silver Covenant won't be a threat anymore.

==Notes==
Speak with the Magister if you lost the tabard.
:{{Gossip|Would you renew my Covenant disguise?}}

Speaking with [[Arcanist Tybalin]]:
:There you are! I was beginning to think that the Sunreavers had intercepted you. Are you ready to deliver the tome to our representatives in Icecrown?

:{{Gossip|I'll deliver the tome to our contacts in Icecrown, arcanist.}}

:{{text|say|Arcanist Tybalin|It's good to finally see you, courier. Krasus has entrusted us with one of the few remaining copies of Ancient Dragonforged Blades.}}
:{{text|say|Arcanist Tybalin|Here is the book. You must ensure it gets to Caladis Brightspear in Icecrown before the Sunreavers realize what is happening.}}
:''Player receives the book.''
:{{text|say|Arcanist Tybalin|Travel quickly! The Sunreavers will not waste any time once they realize that we have the information they seek.}}
