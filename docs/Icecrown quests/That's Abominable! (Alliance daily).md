==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]] on the ''[[Skybreaker]]'' wants you to use the [[Abomination Reanimation Kit]] to create a [[Reanimated Abomination]], which you are to use to kill 15 Icy Ghouls, 15 Vicious Geists, and 15 Risen Alliance Soldiers.
* [[Icy Ghoul]]s Exploded (15)
* [[Vicious Geist]]s Exploded (15)
* [[Risen Alliance Soldier]] Exploded (15)

==Description==
You know what to do, <class>.

Take this kit and use the guts from their [[abomination]]s to create one of your own, then command it to attack the enemy forces at the gate.

You would do well to refine this tactic for when we make another assault on the gate. 

==Progress==
Yes, <class>?

==Completion==
I see your skills with the abominations are developing nicely.

Be diligent, friend, and soon the death gate will belong to the Alliance.

== Notes ==
Kill abominations for their [[Chilled Abomination Guts]] and then create the [[Reanimated Abomination]] and send it in.

See [[Reanimated Abomination]] for details on its use.

==Progression==
