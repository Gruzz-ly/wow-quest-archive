This repeatable quest awards 250 reputation the first time, and 10 each time thereafter.

==Objectives==
[[The Bone Witch]] in [[Njorndar Village]] has instructed you to collect 15 Vrykul Bones.
* [[Vrykul Bones]] (15)

==Description==
One of the benefits of possessing this creature is that I have access to all of her powers. As a bone witch and rune reader, she has the power to throw the bones and determine one's fate.

<The Bone Witch smirks.>

Lucky for you and I that I have it within my power to influence those readings.

Bring me the bones of the [[vrykul]] that you kill here in [[Jotunheim]] and I will toss them to allow you to determine your own fate. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Fate Rune of Baneful Intent|Fate Rune of Fleet Feet|Fate Rune of Nigh Invincibility|Fate Rune of Primal Energy|Fate Rune of Unsurpassed Vigor}}

==Progress==
I find it remarkable that these beings ever held sway over the world when they utilized such primitive magic.

==Completion==
And now we shall see what the future holds for you.

<The Bone Witch casts the bones upon the rug in front of her.>

Choose your fate, <class>

==Notes==
Bones will drop from all vrykul in the zone, not just the ones at Jotunheim.
