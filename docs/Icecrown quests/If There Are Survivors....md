== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Penumbrius]] at the [[Argent Vanguard]] in [[Icecrown]]. 

== Description ==
Across the [[Valley of Echoes]], west of here, and through the [[Breach (Icecrown)|Breach]], is the first [[Scourge]] encampment in Icecrown known as [[Scourgeholme]]. We fought a good fight at Scourgeholme and killed many Scourge, but in the end we were forced to retreat. Many soldiers were left behind - their fate unknown.

If there are survivors, we must attempt a rescue. Directly down this southeastern path is Penumbrius, ally of the [[bronze dragonflight]] and caretaker of the proto-brood. Seek him out and ask for his assistance. 

== Completion ==
<Penumbrius nods.>

My kin will help. Together we will battle the [[Lich King]] and his undead legions.

== Notes ==
You must complete [[Curing The Incurable]], [[Defending The Vanguard]] and [[Scourge Tactics‎]] in order to get this quest.

Penumbrius can be found at {{coords|87.0|79.0|Icecrown}}.
