==Objectives==
[[Lord-Commander Arete]] at [[Death's Rise]] wants you to fill the Gore Bladder with the blood of 10 [[Ravenous Jaws]].
* Blood collected from Ravenous Jaws (10)
* [[Gore Bladder]] (provided)

==Description==
The forces at [[Onslaught Harbor]] are heavily reinforced by gryphon riders. You need a mount that will enable you to put them down. But first, we need the components for the ritual that is going to make it all happen.

A great deal of blood is necessary for the ritual to be undertaken.

<The lord-commander points down and to the northwest.>

There is a readily available supply down there in the harbor... sharks. Do not return to me until you've filled this bladder with their blood. 

==Progress==
It's not glamorous work, but it is necessary.

Now why is it that we are talking again before you are done, <class>?

==Completion==
Well done. Take a moment to let the saltwater dry from your skin before we continue.

==Progression==
{{:To the Rise with all Due Haste!}}
