==Objectives==
[[Koltira Deathweaver|Koltira]], aboard [[Orgrim's Hammer]], wants you to slay Alumeth the Ascended at [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]].
*[[Alumeth the Ascended]] Defeated
Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
It's Alumeth... He's growing in power again. I can sense it. Again his underlings are channeling power to his soul.

If he's allowed to rest, their efforts will soon transform him into a mighty adversary.

Return to his chamber in the north portion of Aldur'thar. Combine his {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Heart|heart}}, {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Skull|skull}}, {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Scepter|scepter}} and {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Robes|robes}}, then use his {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Remains|remains}} on the crystal there.

Hurry, <race>! Destroy him while there's still time!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|22|20}}
*33100 [[XP]] (or {{cost|19|86}} at max level)

==Progress==
Well, friend? Were you successful against Alumeth?

==Completion==
Alumeth has suffered a sound defeat, but I sense that his spirit still lingers...

==Notes==
The items are all over the room.
