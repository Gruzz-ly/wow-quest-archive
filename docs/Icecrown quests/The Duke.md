== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Duke Lankral]] at [[Shadow Vault|The Shadow Vault]]. 

== Description ==
We need you focused, <name>. We're barely holding The Shadow Vault as it is. As you can see, we've greatly angered the [[Lich King]].

<The baron chuckles.>

I need you to speak with Duke Lankral. He's in charge here now. You'll find him inside the vault building proper.

Were I you, I would not keep him waiting. 

== Completion ==
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, <name>. We owe you a great deal, but we're not done with you yet.

There is a [[vrykul]] city just over the mountains to the west, a place called [[Jotunheim]].

The vrykul there are in a constant state of challenge to 'ascend'. The winners go to [[Ymirheim]] to serve as the Lich King's elite warrior caste, the [[Ymirjar]], and the losers are reduced to [[Scourge]]d [[Vargul]].

You are going to be my instrument to see to it that more Vargul than Ymirjar emerge.
