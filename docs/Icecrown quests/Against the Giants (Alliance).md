==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]] on the ''[[Skybreaker]]'' wants you to bring him 5 Pustulent Spines from the [[Pustulent Horror]]s on [[Mord'rethar]].
* [[Pustulant Spine]] (5)

==Description==
While it's going to be crucial to defeat the [[Scourge]] on the ground, we mustn't neglect the gate itself.

The [[flesh giant]]s on the ramparts are capable of hurling massive boulders and chunks of ice, inflicting devastating damage to enemy infantry below.

Muster a force and defeat these giants. We need to know just what we're up against in terms of their strength.

Oh... and bring me their spines. If memory serves, there's a little trick I can share with you. 

==Progress==
Any success against the giants, <race>?

==Completion==
Excellent. These look to be usable samples.

Time again to use the enemy's strength against them....

==Notes==
The giants have 67k HP, some of them are not kitable. Grouping up is recommended as the quest items are group loot.
They are soloable by a class with damage absorpstion abilities, such as a [[Death Knight]] in [[Frost Presence]] with some Heroic/Quest gear.

==Progression==
{{Mord'rethar: The Death Gate (Alliance)}}
