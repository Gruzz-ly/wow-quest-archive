Should you succeed, speak with [[Gjonner the Merciless]] overlooking the southern lip of Valhalas.
* [[Prince Sandoval]] Defeated
Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
I'm afraid that your success is going to be your undoing, <name>.

<If the [[val'kyr]] could turn more white, she would.>

Word of your success in [[Valhalas]] has reached deep into [[Icecrown Citadel]], stirring one whom you have no desire to meet.

Prince Sandoval himself is on his way at this very moment. Gjonner warned you that you should run and I cannot disagree.

What will you do? He's on his way. Will you face the blood prince in final battle? 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Robes of Refrained Celebration|Battleplate of Unheard Ovation|Chestguard of Unwanted Success|Tunic of the Unduly Victorious}}

==Completion==
Your defeat of Prince Sandoval sickens me. An unwashed peasant such as yourself should have willingly given over his life simply for the chance to meet him and kneel at his feet.

You've earned your damned [[reward]]. Be quick about your choosing.
