==Objectives==
[[Keritose Bloodblade]] at the [[Shadow Vault]] wants you to use an [[Eye of Dominion]] to take control of a captured Eidolon Watcher.
* Seize Control of an [[Eidolon Watcher]]

==Description==
Look what we have here... eyes of dominion. The [[Cult of the Damned|Cult]] normally goes to great lengths to keep these things safe, but I suppose their options for retreat are few when we're slaughtering them in their own home.

The eyes allow a being of any relative power to control an [[undead]] minion's actions precisely. As you can imagine, this can be extremely useful when it comes to your typical clumsy ghoul or skeleton.

Care to try your hand at it? Use one of the eyes to control a captured shade. 

==Progress==
The options of subterfuge made available with the eyes are obvious. These will be very useful tools.

==Completion==
Nothing to it, eh? Any intelligent being should have little trouble controlling lesser undead. I suspect only the likes of a true [[necromancer]] could use these to seize control of any of the more powerful undead. That won't be a problem though - I can already think of quite a variety of destruction we can wreak with even the most paltry of minions.

Shall we have at it then?

==Notes==
Seizing control of Eidolon Watcher gives access to a number of the [[shade]]'s abilities: #1 is a 30-yard blink on a 2s cooldown, #2 is a very weak blood siphon, #3 is Dephase, exiting combat and increasing run speed for 10 sec, #4 is Feed Hungering Plaguehound, making them less aggressive, #5 is Assasinate Restless Lookout, #6 is Banish Scourge Crystal, #0 is Ethereal, basically putting the shade in stealth.

It is possible to interact with NPCs while in control of the shade.
