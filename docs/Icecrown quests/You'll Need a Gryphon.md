== Objectives ==
Deliver an [[Onslaught Gryphon]] to [[Uzo Deathcaller]] at [[Death's Rise]].
* Onslaught Gryphon delivered to Uzo Deathcaller

== Description ==
What could be more fitting than to take one of their own gryphons to use against them? Go to [[Onslaught Harbor]] and take the reins to one of their gryphons from the dead clutches of its rider.

Return with the gryphon, delivering it to Uzo Deathcaller. He will see to its proper transformation and provide you with further instructions. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Gryphon Rider's Bracers
|Gryphon Hide Moccasins
|Gauntlets of Urgency
|Helmet of the Dedicated}}

== Progress ==
What took so long? Are their gryphons slow? We'll have to do something about that.

== Completion ==
Oh yeah this is gonna be good!

Stand back... I'm gonna call down the wrath of the blood ritual!

== Notes ==
Find and kill an [[Onslaught Gryphon Rider]] and loot the [[Onslaught Gryphon Reins]] it drops, then use it to summon a gryphon and ride back to Death's Rise.
