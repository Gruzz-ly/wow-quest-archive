==Objectives==
[[Vereth the Cunning]] on the [[Rise of Suffering]] wants you to kill Sapph, the Rider of Frost.
* [[Sapph]] slain
Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
Sapph... Sapph's a death knight like no other. She'll shower you with sweet words and you'll swear that she has no evil within her heart, and then she'll run you through without even breaking her smile.

I have no fear that you'll be able to best Sapph, but do not grow over confident. Her strength lies in lulling her victims into a false ease, shortly after shattering them with a fierce barrage of frost attacks.

Do not let your guard down, and do not underestimate her. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Sapph's Cleaver|Frost Climber's Hatchet|Icy Quick Edge|Axe of the Cunning}}

==Progress==
Are we rid of her?

==Completion==
I can't deny, I'll miss her laugh... and that smile that would creep onto her face just before she killed someone. A little less need to watch my back though, so I suppose I can't complain.

==Notes==
Sapph can be found to the northeast of [[Malykriss: The Vile Hold]] standing at the edge of a ledge overlooking [[The Broken Front]] and [[Mord'rethar: The Death Gate]] at {{coords|61.9|68.6|Icecrown}}.

You can solo this quest as a Death Knight by popping Army of Dead and spamming Death and Decay and Blood Boil. Make sure you keep him in the Death and Decay for the fight and you should walk away victorious. Army of Dead should hold aggro on him until just under 50% of his health then it's just a race to the death for you. Raise Dead helps here also for more dps on him. (I had 25K health vs his 125K health when I beat him). For me, this was the easiest of the three to defeat.
