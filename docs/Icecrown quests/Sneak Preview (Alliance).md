==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]], aboard the ''[[Skybreaker]]'', wants you to fly down to the [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|gate of desolation]], visiting the south, central, north, and northwest regions of the gate.
*Aldur'thar South Visited
*Aldur'thar Central Visited
*Aldur'thar North Visited
*Aldur'thar Northwest Visited

==Description==
Progress is being made. We have a promising array of tactics that should gain us control of the [[Mord'rethar: The Death Gate|death gate]]. There will doubtlessly be many casualties, but in the end, we should be able to prevail - barring any interference from those [[Horde]] you insist on contending with...

At any rate, our next focus will be the gate of desolation. Fly down and become familiar with it and with the enemies posted there.

When you return, I will have your missions prepared. 

==Progress==
Have you scouted the gate of desolation, <class>?

==Completion==
Well and good, <class>.

Now that you've seen firsthand what we're up against, it's time to get to work...
