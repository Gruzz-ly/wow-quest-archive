== Objectives ==
[[Koltira Deathweaver]] on [[Orgrim's Hammer]] wants you to use the [[Abomination Reanimation Kit]] to create a [[Reanimated Abomination]], which you are to use to kill 15 [[Icy Ghoul]]s, 15 [[Vicious Geist]]s, and 15 [[Risen Alliance Soldier]]s.
* [[Icy Ghoul]]s Exploded (15)
* [[Vicious Geist]]s Exploded (15)
* [[Risen Alliance Soldier]]s Exploded (15)

== Description ==
[[Abomination]]s...

They can be a very capable enemy. I've seen them turn the tide of battle more than once. What few realize, is that they can also be very capable friends.

They are not deep thinkers. If you know the secrets of their creation, you can issue them basic orders that they will not question.

Fortunately for you, I know these secrets.

This kit will reanimate the remains of the abominations you defeat. Take it, and learn to use them against the scourge on the death gate. 

* [[Abomination Reanimation Kit]] (provided)

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Slippers of the Broken Front
|Mantle of Reanimation
|Geist Stalker Leggings
|Scourgebane Pauldrons}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|40}}

== Completion ==
You see, <class>?

Ingenuity can sometimes even the odds against a seemingly overwhelming enemy.

== Notes ==
Completing this quest opens up the quest [[Sneak Preview (Horde)|Sneak Preview]].

All these mobs can be found in [[The Broken Front]]/[[Mord'Rethar: The Death Gate]].

Kill abominations for their [[Chilled Abomination Guts]] and then create the [[Reanimated Abomination]] and send it in.

See [[Reanimated Abomination]] for details on its use.
