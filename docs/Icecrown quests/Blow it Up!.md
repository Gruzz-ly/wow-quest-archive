== Objectives ==
Go to the nearby [[Saronite Bomb Stack]] to light the fuse. 

== Description ==
This is probably as under-control as this situation is going to get. Let's do this, <name>.

I need someone to light the fuse on those bombs and it looks like you're the one to do it. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||74}} ({{cost|1|32}} at level 80)

== Completion ==
These bombs look pretty potent.  They should at least put a dent in the surrounding structure.

== Notes ==
The Saronite Bomb Stack is located at {{coords|54.4|68.2|Icecrown}}.

==Progression==
{{:A Short Fuse}}
