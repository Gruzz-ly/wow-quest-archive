== Objectives ==
[[Duke Lankral]] at [[Shadow Vault (Icecrown)|The Shadow Vault]] has asked you to use the [[Challenge Flag]] to challenge and defeat 6 Mjordin Combatants.
* [[Mjordin Combatant]]s challenged and defeated (6)

== Description ==
The first step we're going to take is at a place in [[Jotunheim]] called the [[Savage Ledge]]. It's just over the mountains to the west.

On the ledge the [[vrykul]] warriors are always sparring, being instructed in the finer arts of battle by their thane's men.

I want you to take this flag and issue a challenge to a number of them. Let's demoralize them with the 'mere' skills of a <race>, shall we?

<The duke grins, his rotting teeth flashing in the dim light of the vault.> 

* [[Challenge Flag]] (provided)

== Progress ==
Perhaps you could go back and challenge a few more?

== Completion ==
Already I'm hearing reports of the prowess you displayed on the Savage Ledge. Excellent, <name>... excellent!

<The duke flashes his rictus smile again and you can almost hear the wheels in his head turning.>

And now I think it's time to issue a decree to the thane of those vrykul that you so easily defeated.

== Notes ==
Do [[Eliminate the Competition]] alongside this quest.

To get credit, target a vrykul, dueling or not. Get within range then drop the flag on top of him. If the targeted vrykul has a sparring partner, it will despawn.
