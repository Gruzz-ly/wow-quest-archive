== Objectives ==
[[Koltira Deathweaver]] on [[Orgrim's Hammer]] wants you to bring him 5 [[Pustulant Spine]]s from the [[Pustulent Horror]]s on [[Mord'rethar: The Death Gate|Mord'rethar]].
* [[Pustulant Spine]] (5)
* Suggested Players [5]

== Description ==
While it's going to be crucial to defeat the [[Scourge]] on the ground, we mustn't neglect the gate itself.

The [[flesh giant]]s on the ramparts are capable of hurling massive boulders and chunks of ice, inflicting devastating damage to enemy infantry below.

Muster a force and defeat these giants. We need to know just what we're up against in terms of their strength.

Oh... and bring me their spines. If memory serves, there's a little trick I can share with you. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|14|80}}

== Progression ==
Any success against the giants, <race>?

== Completion ==
Excellent. These look to be usable samples.

Time again to use the enemy's strength against them....

==Trivia==
{{wplink|Against the Giants}} was an adventure module for classic Dungeons and Dragons (AD&D).
