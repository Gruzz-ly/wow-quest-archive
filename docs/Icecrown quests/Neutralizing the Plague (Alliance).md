==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]] aboard the [[Skybreaker]] wants you use [[:Pustulant Spinal Fluid]] on a plague cauldron at [[Mord'rethar]].

You can create Pustulant Spinal Fluid by using a [[Flesh Giant Spine|Giant Spine]] collected from a [[Pustulent Horror|Pustulant Horror]].
*Plague Cauldron Neutralized

Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
You no longer need my assistance in neutralizing the enemy's [[plague cauldron]]s, <race>.

Hunt down the [[flesh giant]]s at the death gate and use the fluid from their spines to render batches of the [[Plague of Undeath|plague]] ineffective.

You are striking at the heart of the enemy's strategy. This is an important mission - vital to our cause, and should be carried out whenever time permits.

Remember, the giants and the plague cauldrons can be found on Mord'rethar.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|22|20|}}
*33,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Greetings, <class>.

Can I report that we've rendered another plague cauldron useless?

==Completion==
One less plague cauldron to account for when the battle commences.

Your captain will be highly pleased.

==Progression==
