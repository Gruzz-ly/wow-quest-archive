==Objectives==
[[Koltira Deathweaver|Koltira]], aboard [[Orgrim's Hammer]], wants you to slay Alumeth the Ascended at [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]].
* [[Alumeth the Ascended]] Defeated
*Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
These fools have actually stumbled upon something that could pose a serious threat to our plans!

The leader of this particular sect, Alumeth, has ritualistically sacrificed himself and now his underlings are channeling power to his soul.

If he's allowed to rest, their efforts will soon transform him into a mighty adversary.

Combine his {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Heart|heart}}, {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Skull|skull}}, {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Scepter|scepter}} and {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Robes|robes}} from around their chamber and use his {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Remains|remains}} on the crystal there.

Hurry, <race>! Destroy him before he becomes any more powerful! 

==Rewards==

*{{cost|22|20}}
*33100 [[XP]] (or {{cost|19|86}} at max level)

==Progress==
Well, friend? Were you successful against Alumeth?

==Completion==
Alumeth has suffered a sound defeat, but I sense that his spirit still lingers...

==Notes and trivia==
*The items are all over the room.
*After completion, this becomes a daily quest.
