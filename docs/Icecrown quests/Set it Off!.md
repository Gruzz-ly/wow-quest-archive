== Objectives ==
[[Captain Kendall]], below [[Icecrown Citadel]], wants you to go to the nearby [[Saronite Bomb Stack]] to light the fuse.

== Description ==
Things are looking good. Let's do this.

The stack of bombs is right near the pit. I'll start to evacuate the men. 

== Completion ==
These bombs look pretty potent. They should at least put a dent in the surrounding structure.

== Notes ==
The Saronite Bomb Stack is on the other side of the pit from the captain.

==Progression==
