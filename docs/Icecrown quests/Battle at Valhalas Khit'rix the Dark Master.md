Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
A variety of beings travel the world to prove themselves within Valhalas. Some even come from under the world.

Khit'rix the Dark Master is one such.

Hailing from deep within the ground where insanity reigns, Khit'rix has asked for someone exotic to face in the ring. You will do.

Dare you face this [[nerubian]] nightmare, <race>? 

==Completion==
You want me to be impressed by the fact that you and your friends were able to bring down a lone nerubian priest?

Get out of my sight before I summon my [[ghoul]]s upon you!
