== Objectives ==
[[Crusade Commander Entari]] at the [[Argent Vanguard]] in [[Icecrown]] has asked that you free 8 [[Webbed Crusader]]s.
* Webbed Crusader Freed (8)

== Description ==
We had the element of surprise on our side! We blew a hole in the side of the mountain and charged into [[Scourgeholme]]. [[Scourge]] opposition was fierce and it wasn't long until we were overwhelmed. We fell back to the valley and begin raining artillery down on the Scourge that followed. This held them back for awhile until... Those monsters began using crusaders as living shields. We had to stop shelling for fear of killing our own soldiers.

Free our crusaders trapped on the field outside the base, <class>! 

== Progress ==
Have you freed the webbed crusaders?

== Completion ==
There are still many [[Argent Crusade]] soldiers out on that field and in Scourgeholme, <name>. While your help is appreciated, there is still much left to be done.

== Notes ==
Destroying the cocoons will either spawn a [[Freed Crusader]], or a [[Forgotten Depths Ambusher]]. When freed, the crusader will heal and/or buff the player.

Do the quests [[Curing The Incurable]] and [[Defending The Vanguard]] to continue the chain.

As the enemy are all [[nerubian]], they can be [[skinning|skinned]] for [[Borean Leather]] and [[Nerubian Chitin]]. Skinners may want to take the time to replenish their stocks before turning in [[Into The Wild Green Yonder]], as they will be [[phasing|phased]] out afterward.
