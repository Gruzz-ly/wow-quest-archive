== Objectives ==
Report to [[Lord-Commander Arete]] at [[Death's Rise]]. 

== Description ==
Some would say that our most critical mission lies not with the [[Lich King]], but with the utter destruction of the [[Scarlet Onslaught]]. I would say that is foolish, but who am I to judge?

Death's Rise is far to the southwest, overlooking the sea along the cliff wall. There you will find Lord-Commander Arete personally overseeing the Onslaught's destruction himself.

<The baron clears his throat.>

Do see to it that you report to him with all due haste. He asked for you personally. 

== Completion ==
It's about damned time! No doubt that Baron Sliver took his sweet time in sending you to me.

I should have that empty space above his shoulders removed!

== Notes ==
Death's Rise is marked on the zone map just northeast of Balargarde Fortress at {{coords|20|48|Icecrown}}.
