==Objectives==
[[The Bone Witch]] in [[Njorndar Village]] has asked you to beat information out of Apprentice Osterkilgr concerning the whereabouts of [[Dr. Terrible]].

You are then to slay the apprentice.
* Information beaten out of Apprentice Osterkilgr
* [[Apprentice Osterkilgr]] slain

==Description==
Deep in the bowels of [[The Underhalls]] to the northeast, a mad scientist known as Dr. Terrible is up to something befitting his name.

The doctor has been given dispensation by the [[Lich King]] to perform experiments upon the [[vargul]] -- the [[vrykul]] who fall in battle and are found unworthy, and then turned into [[Scourge]].

We must put an end to his work, but my auguries have been unable to find him. He does, however, have an assistant.

Beat the information out of his apprentice, and then dispose of the body. 

==Progress==
You have not finished what I asked of you.

Please leave and do not return until you have done so or I will be very cross.

==Completion==
Very interesting. It sounds to me that you handled that perfectly. I'm surprised that the doctor was using a [[vargul]] as an assistant given what he was working on.

==Notes==
The entrance to the Underhalls is just to the southeast of the ring at Valhalas at {{coords|32.8|32.4|Icecrown}}

In the Underhalls after taking a left is [[Bethod Feigr]], who offers a short side quest: [[Revenge for the Vargul]]

Take a right, head down the stairs to the bottom. Underneath the stairs is the apprentice.

:Apprentice Osterkilgr says: You've come for the doctor's plans! You'll only find death!
:Apprentice Osterkilgr says: The doctor entrusted me with the plans to [[Nergeld]]! I will not fall!

The apprentice drops [[Dr. Terrible's "Building a Better Flesh Giant"]], which starts the next quest.
