==Objectives==
[[The Leaper]] at [[Shadow Vault (Icecrown)|The Shadow Vault]] wants you to use a [[Jotunheim Rapid-Fire Harpoon]] to shoot down 20 Jotunheim Proto-Drakes and their riders.
* [[Jotunheim Proto-Drake|Jotunheim Proto-Drakes]] & their riders shot down (20)

==Description==
[[Jotunheim]] has aerial defenses, both in terms of [[proto-dragon|proto-drake]] riders and harpoon guns. They've concentrated these on their northern and western facings where they are most vulnerable.

Let's use their defenses against them!

<The Leaper pierces you with his single eye and cackles maniacally.>

Take control of a harpoon gun on the platforms that overhang the cliffs on either side of [[Valhalas]] to the southwest. Take out the proto-drakes and their riders. Shoot 'em up! 

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
You are a true champion for the cause, <name>!

Won't you please come speak to me again tomorrow? I'm certain that there will be more of those nasty proto-drakes to shoot down.

==Notes==
The harpoons do have some travel time, so lead the drakes a little.
