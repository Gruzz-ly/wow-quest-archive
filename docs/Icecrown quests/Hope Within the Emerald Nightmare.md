==Objectives==
[[Keeper Remulos]] at [[Moonglade]] has instructed you to enter the [[emerald dream]] and recover 3 Emerald Acorns.

Leave the vicinity of the [[Shrine of Remulos]] to return to [[Azeroth]].
* [[Emerald Acorn]] (3)

==Description==
What we need exists only in the emerald dream... acorns that are infused with a powerful restorative magic. Many places in this sacred glade are closely tied with the dream, and my shrine is among them.

I will send you into the dream to recover one of these acorns. Be prepared though <class>, for this method of entering the dream is dangerous, and it is very likely you will be beset by nightmares.

Recover a few acorns quickly, and then depart from my shrine or pinch yourself to return to our world.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}}
*22050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|13|23}} at 80)

==Progress==
It is good to see that you are safe. Have you recovered the acorns?

==Completion==
Excellent work, young one.

==Notes==
Once accepted, Remulos applies the buff '''''Fitful Dream''': "Immersed in the Emerald Nightmare. Right-click to pinch yourself."'' Story-wise, this puts the character's body to sleep and sends their dream self into the Emerald Dream. Game-wise, the character simply falls asleep, [[Phasing|phases]] into a green fog that covers the [[Shrine of Remulos]] and returns to a standing position.

A player using the {{text|emote|/pinch}} emote on themself will not end their dream sleep, but right-clicking the buff or simply walking far enough away will do so, whisking them back to where they fell asleep in front of Remulos.

:{{text|say|Keeper Remulos|Welcome back to the waking world, child.}}

If awakened too soon, Remulos can send them back:

:{{gossip|Please send me into the Emerald Dream to recover the acorns. I know of the danger and I do not fear it.}}

The acorns are small objects scattered on the ground near the shrine, spaced fairly widely but not too hard to find.

{{rfg-section|4.2.0}}
The dream boundary was originally marked by a ring of elite [[Nightmare Aberration]] around the area. Getting too close to them ended the dream. [[Nightmare Figment]]s could also attack the character in the form of a shadow version of themselves.
