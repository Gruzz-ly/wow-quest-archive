== Objectives ==
Return to [[Koltira Deathweaver]] aboard [[Orgrim's Hammer]]. 

== Description ==
Do you see now? Sending your men against the prince's armies just swells their numbers.

I don't expect you to understand... you'll probably just end like the others. You'd best return to whoever sent you. They might be worried. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|3|70}}

== Completion ==
There you are. Nice work down in the valley. The carnage was visible all the way up here.

Are you ok? You look like you've seen a ghost.

==Progression==
{{Do Your Worst}}
