==Objectives==
Speak with [[Frazzle Geargrinder]] in [[Ymirheim]]. 

==Description==
I need you down in Ymirheim, that big frost [[vrykul]] town in the middle of [[Icecrown]].

Frazzle Geargrinder is down there on the south side of town representing the [[Valiance Expedition]] in a competition against the [[Horde]] scum. It's her jumpbot versus theirs in a king of the mountain contest!

Don't let us down, <name>. [[Gnomish engineering]] pride is on the line! Besides, all the boys here in the hold are counting on you.

That and we've got money riding on it that you can kick those idiots in the pants! 

==Completion==
Did the chief send you down from the ''[[Skybreaker]]''? Isn't that thing sweet?!

==Notes==
Frazzle can be found at the southern end of Ymirheim hiding behind a building at {{coords|57.0|62.6|Icecrown}}
