'''Army of the Damned''' is a quest that puts the player in [[Arthas]]'s place, requiring them to slaughter a regiment of Arthas's own soldiers.

==Objectives==
[[Matthias Lehner]] at the [[First Legion Forward Camp]] wants you to raise an army of 100 Ghoulish Minions.
* Ghoulish Minion Raised (100)

==Description==
You probably think you're quite strong—fighting these [[undead]] and crushing their bones beneath your war machines.

That is nothing compared to the strength it took to create them.

I saw the [[Arthas Menethil|prince]] do it himself. I can show you how it happened... if you'd like. 

==Progress==
Did you see, <name>?

==Completion==
The prince's true power wasn't his ability to make armies out of corpses... that was easy.

But killing his own men, with whom he'd shared many battles... the prince's true power was ability to do what had to be done.

==Notes==
Accepting the quest will send players a few years back in time as they see through [[The Prodigal Leader]]'s eyes.
