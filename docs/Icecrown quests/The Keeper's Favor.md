==Objectives==
[[Highlord Tirion Fordring]] at [[Crusaders' Pinnacle]] has requested that you secure passage from [[Arch Druid Lilliandra]] and speak to [[Keeper Remulos]] in [[Moonglade]]. 

==Description==
There are those of this world that tap into power unrestricted by the bounds of our mortal frames - powers of restoration, powers of life, and powers of light. And [[Crusader Bridenbrad|Bridenbrad]], this is no ordinary man... his valor and devotion shine through. We can only hope that one of these beings will intervene and bring this hero back from a fate worse than death.

Go now and speak to Arch Druid Lilliandris in the [[Argent Vanguard]]... request passage to Moonglade and seek the aid of Keeper Remulos.

==Completion==
Hello child.

I understand Tirion's request and trust in his judgment, we will see what we can do for this Crusader Bidenbrad. What you ask is no simple task - the [[Scourge]] are not of this world, and many have failed in attempting to strip their corruption over the years.

In a being of nobility and light, all is not without hope.

==Notes==
Arch Druid Lilliandra can be found in the [[Vanguard Infirmary]] at {{coords|87.1|77.0|Icecrown}}.

:It is always a pleasure to meet heroes such as yourself in this [[Icecrown|forsaken land]]. Is there some form of assistance that I can offer you?

:{{gossip|It's a pleasure to meet you as well, [[Arch Druid]]. I'm on a task from Tirion and time is short, might I trouble you for a portal to Moonglade?}}
::Of course! Go with [[Elune]]'s blessing.

Simply walk into the green Moonglade Portal. You will end up at {{coords|37|43|Moonglade}}, at the [[Shrine of Remulos]].

Additional: Sometimes the NPC bugs out and doesn't provide the portal to Moonglade for you, just stand on top of her and problem solved.
