==Objectives==
Capture 6 ''[[Orgrim's Hammer]]'' Dispatches from [[Orgrim's Hammer Scout]]s and bring them to [[High Captain Justin Bartlett]] aboard the [[Skybreaker]].
* [[Orgrim's Hammer Dispatch]]: (6)
* [[Dart Gun]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Horde]] is up to something and I don't like it. After the stunt they pulled on the [[Broken Front]], they're capable of anything, and it's up to us to stop it.

There's been a flurry of activity in the skies over the [[Icecrown Glacier]], to the west of [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]] and the [[Ironwall Rampart]]. Horde scouts and messengers streak in and out on [[dragonhawk]]s, carrying reports and orders. Take this dart gun and use it to kill the Orgrim's Hammer Scouts. It'll probably work best if you're flying, too. 

==Progress==
Have you intercepted those dispatches?

==Completion==
It's good to have someone competent running missions, <name>. If only we had an army of <classes> like you, we could show the Horde what we're made of. These captured reports will help us to maintain the upper hand in this fight. We may be down, but we're far from out.

==Notes==
West of Ymirheim, north of the elite frost wyrms, south of the rampart.

A good macro to use to help with killing the Orgrim's Hammer Scouts:

:/tar Orgrim's Hammer Scout
:/use Dart Gun
:/cleartarget
