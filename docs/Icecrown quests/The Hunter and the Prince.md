==Objectives==
[[Matthias Lehner]] in the [[Court of Bones]] wants you to look for a Bloodstained Stone and complete the Prince's Destiny.
* The Prince's Destiny

==Description==
Before [[Arthas Menethil|the prince]] became [[Lich King|a king]], he fought many battles... but only one where he came close to dying.

It was fought right here. After you let me show you what happened, you'll understand everything.

Find a bloodstained stone and pick it up from the floor. You'll see what happened.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Gloves of Tormented Recollection
|Gloves of Troubled Memory
|Leggings of the Turning Point
|Bloodstained Helmet}}

==Progress==
Did you see, <name>? Did you?

==Completion==
After that fight, the prince realized what was holding him back was that he was still human... he could still feel... he could still bleed. He still had a heart.

The first thing he did when he became king was to rid himself of it. He threw it down the pit where we first met. And you, <name>, were the first person to touch it since.

==Notes==
[[File:Illidan and Arthas Redux.jpg|thumb|300px|The duel]]
There are several stones scattered about the courtyard, just west of the quest giver.

Touching one the stones once again transforms the player into Arthas, with a different set of abilities. This time, it's a one on one with [[Illidan Stormrage]]: the same duel seen after the Warcraft III mission [[A Symphony of Frost and Flame]]. Arthas will start with 188,000 HP and an empty mana bar worth 25,014 MP. Illidan starts with 903,000 HP and Boss status.

:{{text|say|Illidan Stormrage|Prepare to die!}}

Arthas has four abilities:

*1: Parry - "Parry Illidan's attack and regenerate 25% of your mana if successful." Makes Arthas parry Illidan's next attack, giving him mana, as he starts with none. Instant, 3 second cooldown.
*2: Deathstrike - "Deal weapon damage +20000." A heroic strike for 20,000 Dmg, a mediocre amount of damage for this fight. 2000 Mana, Instant, 1 second coodown.
*3: Stomp - "Knock Illidan back." Knock Illidan back, giving Arthas the range he requires to use Annihilate. 5000 Mana, Instant, 4 second cooldown.
*4: Annihilate - "Leap at Illidan dealing weapon damage +400000 and stunning him for 6 seconds." A heroic leap attack that deals a substantial amount of damage, 400,000 Dmg, to Illidan. 10,000 Mana, 8-25 yard range, Instant, 15 second cooldown.

Parry until Arthas has enough mana to Stomp and immediately follow up with Annihilate. Do that about 4 or 5 times to defeat Illidan and complete the quest.

During the fight you will get a debuff called [http://www.wowhead.com/spell=61101 Pierced Heart]. Its text is: "Your heart has been grazed by Illidan's glaives.  If only you could rid yourself of this useless thing..."
