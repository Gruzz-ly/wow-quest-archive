==Objectives==
{{npc||Bethod Feigr}} in [[The Underhalls]] wants you to throw down his sword to challenge [[Thane Illskar]] and then kill him in [[Circle of Suffering|The Circle of Suffering]].
* [[Thane Illskar]] slain

==Description==
I've been praying to The [[Lady of the Sword]] for one to come and strike down my enemy. Thane Illska must pay for what he did to me!

I was the champion of [[Thane Ufrang the Mighty]].  During my fight for ascendance in [[Valhalas]], Illska sabotaged me with dark magic, causing me to lose and be reduced to this.

The thane and his champions can be found below in The Circle of Suffering. Challenge him on my behalf. Defeat him.

Make him know the suffering that I know! 

* [[Bethod's Sword]] (provided)

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Mantle of the Underhalls|Boots of the Fallen Thane|Circlet of Suffering|Gauntlets of the Holy Gladiator|Illskar's Greatcloak}}

==Progress==
I sense that you haven't yet defeated Thane Illska. Does something stay your hand?

==Completion==
Thank you, <class>... thank you!

You've given me the satisfaction of knowing that the coward who made me into this will rot for all eternity as surely I will.

Now leave before I lose control of myself and cut you down.

==Notes==
Turn around and head southwest, run down the stairs, then head further southwest to the Circle.

Throw down the sword in the center of the ring, fight off [[Volgur]] and [[Brita]], then with the [[Val'kyr Arbiter]] watching, kill Thane Illskar.

:{{text|yell|Thane Illskar|Bethod's Sword?!! Very well, <race>, I accept your challenge.  But first, you must best my champions.  Volgur!  Squash this insect!}}
:{{text|yell|Thane Illskar|Brita, create a pincushion of this puny <class>!}}
:{{text|yell|Thane Illskar|You may have defeated my champions, <class>.  I am something else entirely.}}
:{{text|yell|Thane Illskar|Pray to your gods for a quick death.}}
Victory:
:{{text|yell|Val'kyr Arbiter|Thane Illskar, you were challenged to honorable combat and failed.}}
:{{text|yell|Val'kyr Arbiter|You have been found wanting and are judged accordingly.  Now rise, Thane Illskar the Damned!}}
:{{text|yell|Thane Illskar the Damned|NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!}}
