==Objectives==
[[The Bone Witch]] in [[Njorndar Village]] wants you to possess a [[Water Terror]] and use it to slay 10 [[vrykul]] in the greater [[Jotunheim]] region.

Qualifying vrykul are [[Jotunheim Sleep-Watcher]]s, [[Jotunheim Warrior]]s, [[Mjordin Water Magus|Mjordin Water Magi]], [[Njorndar Spear-Sister]]s, and [[Valhalas Vargul]].
* Jotunheim vrykul slain while possessing a Water Terror (10)

==Description==
The water lock outside my cave is teeming with [[elemental]]s that the [[vrykul]] magi have yet to tame. I am going to teach you a trick for possessing these creatures for a short time, and you will use them to wreak havoc upon Jotunheim!

<The [[banshee]]-infested vrykul draws magic in the air and touches a large finger to your forehead.>

Go now and open the gate to the lock. A water terror will rush out and you will possess it to destroy our enemies! 

==Rewards==

==Progress==
My reading of the bones tells me that you're not quite done.

==Completion==
I have never seen such terror in the eyes of a vrykul. They think themselves masters of their world.

You and I are going to prove them wrong. Very wrong.

==Notes==
1 is spell reflect, 2 is melee-range knockback, 3 is frostbolt, 4 is frost nova.
