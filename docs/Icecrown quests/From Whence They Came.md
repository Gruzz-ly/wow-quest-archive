==Objectives==
[[Keritose Bloodblade]] at the [[Shadow Vault]] has sent you to banish 10 Scourge Containment Crystals.
* Banished Scourge Crystals (10)

==Description==
My main concern is the [[Saronite]] [[Weeping Quarry|quarry]] down the path to the southwest. They are pulling up immense amounts of ore from that quarry and I'd like to know what they're building with it. To that end, we'll start by weakening their defenses.

I noticed a series of crystals scattered throughout the base and I assume they are defensive structures of some sort, not unlike [[ziggurat]]s. Use the [[Eidolon Watcher]] to destroy any of those crystals that you find. 

==Progress==
Are those crystals out of the way? I don't want them to prove a nasty surprise for my [[gryphon]]s.

==Completion==
Excellent work. We should have little threat in the air then.
