This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Bring the Restored Quel'Delar to [[Justicar Mariel Trueheart]] at the [[Argent Tournament Grounds]]. 
*[[Restored Quel'Delar]] (provided)

==Description==
At last, Quel'Delar is restored for the glory of the Sunreavers and the sin'dorei!

All of Silvermoon will celebrate you as a hero, <name>.

As a <class>, the sword seems to know you lack the training to wield it and hasn't bonded to you. Where, then, will its next master come from? No worthy sin'dorei has come forward. Let us seek the Argent Crusade's counsel. Go north to the Argent Tournament Grounds and present the sword to Justicar Mariel Trueheart on behalf of the Sunreavers. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Cudgel of Furious Justice|Hammer of Purified Flame|Lightborn Spire}}
*You will also receive:
*{{cost|22|20}} 
*[[The Sword in the Skull]]

==Completion==
That a weapon of such power has been redeemed from the clutches of evil is a great omen in these times, <name>. With Quel'Delar and staunch Sunreaver allies at our side, the Lich King will have good reason to fear.

The crusade maintains an arsenal of exceptional weapons for our strongest allies. Allow me to offer you your choice from among them in return for entrusting us with the care of Quel'Delar.

==Notes==
This quest is only available to [[Blood Elf]] Priests since they cannot use swords and Blood Elves can not be Druids or Shamans.
