This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Bring the Restored Quel'Delar to [[Justicar Mariel Trueheart]] at the [[Argent Tournament Grounds]].
*[[Restored Quel'Delar]] (provided)

==Description==
In spite of [[Blood-Queen Lana'thel|Queen Lana'thel]]'s boasting, you have restored [[Quel'Delar]], <name>. Long have we dreamt of reclaiming Quel'Delar.

The [[Silver Covenant]], and indeed all [[quel'dorei]] owe you a debt of gratitude.

As a <class>, the sword seems to know you lack the training to wield it and hasn't bonded to you. Where, then, will its next master come from? Perhaps the [[Argent Crusade]] can find one. Go north to the Argent Tournament Grounds and present the sword to Justicar Mariel Trueheart on behalf of the Silver Covenant. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Cudgel of Furious Justice|Hammer of Purified Flame|Lightborn Spire}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|22|20}}
*[[The Sword in the Skull]]

==Progress==
Is it true that you have restored [[Quel'Delar]]?

==Completion==
That a weapon of such power has been redeemed from the clutches of evil is a great omen in these times, <name>. With Quel'Delar and staunch Silver Covenant allies at our side, the Lich King will have good reason to fear.

The crusade maintains an arsenal of exceptional weapons for our strongest allies. Allow me to offer you your choice from among them in return for entrusting us with the care of Quel'Delar.

==Mariel's Announcement==
:{{text|yell|Crusaders and combatants, a true hero stands before you this day! <name>, of the Silver Covenant, has restored the ancient blade of Quel'Delar as a symbol of our resolve to defeat the Lich King!}}

==Notes==
This quest is only available to classes that cannot use swords ([[druid]]s, [[priest]]s and [[shaman]]s).
