==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]] aboard the [[Skybreaker]] wants you to use the Partitioned Flask at each of the 3 [[Cult of the Damned|cultists']] [[Plague cauldron|cauldrons]]{{coords|48|34|Icecrown}} at [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]], then bring it to [[Chief Engineer Boltwrench]].
*Blue Sample Collected
*Green Sample Collected
*Dark Sample Collected
*[[Partitioned Flask]] (provided)

==Description==
I smell their cauldrons from here, but that's not plague they're cooking.

Pledges to the cult are forced to drink a concoction that steals their will and enslaves them forever to the [[Lich King]].

Some say the potion contains the twisted soul of a being who was tormented before being mercilessly slaughtered, but I've never been able to reproduce it...

Fill this flask with a sample from each of the three cauldrons in the northwest region of the gate and bring it to Chief Engineer Boltwrench. 

==Progress==
Whatdya got there, <race>?

==Completion==
<Boltwrench pours the contents of the flask into his tetrahydroparticle analyzer.>

What we have here is a simple failure to conglomerate...

==Trivia==
There is a slight Easter Egg in this quest.  The terms "Cannot Reproduce", "Not a Bug" and "Need More Info" are terms used for "states" of a bug tracked in the program "DevTrack", which is used by Quality Assurance Testers and developers to communicate about bugs written up by the testers.  Therefore this is a slight homage to QA Testers throughout the game industry.
