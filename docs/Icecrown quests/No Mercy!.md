==Objectives==
[[High Captain Justin Bartlett]] aboard the ''[[Skybreaker]]'' wants you to kill 15 [[Horde]] Players. 

==Description==
It is as I told you. They were not merely idle words spoken in a fit of anger.

Time and again, the Horde have demonstrated their disdain for everything we hold dear and holy. They must pay with their lives for their transgressions against the light.

All of them.

Just imagine a world free of their stain, <name>. Envision the joy our children will know. Think of the reverence your descendants will have for your memory, knowing they owe their happiness to you.

Now go, and make that vision a reality! 

==Progress==
I trust you have stained the snow with the blood of our enemies, <name>.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>!

Hunt them down and make them pay!

==Notes==
As [[Icecrown]] has no dedicated [[PvP]] area and in fact has a [[Sanctuary]] area (the [[Argent Tournament]]), this quest may be difficult to complete on [[PvE server]]s.

==Progression==
# [[The Broken Front (Alliance)]]
