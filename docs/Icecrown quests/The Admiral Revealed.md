==Objectives==
[[Lord-Commander Arete]] wants you to deal with Grand Admiral Westwind. Return to the lord-commander upon [[Death's Rise]] after you have done so.
* [[Barean Westwind|Grand Admiral Westwind]] dealt with
Suggested Players [5]
* [[Lord-Commander's Nullifier]] (provided)

==Description==
When [[Brigitte Abbendis|High General Abbendis]] was confronted at [[New Hearthglen]], the grand admiral protected himself within an impenetrable sphere of magic before making his escape.

I am particularly adept at [[Anti-magic|nullifying]] magic.

Take this to use against him inside [[Hidden Hollow]] when he puts the sphere up. I wish that I could be there to see the look on his face when you do it.

Deal with him and then return to me on Death's Rise.

<The lord-commander laughs with abandon.>

The fools were taken in by the demons yet again and now they are destroyed!

I trust that my favorite <class> will stick around long enough to help us finish off the rest of them? Perhaps one of these would convince you?

He has 3994 MP and at 100%, he would have 327,000 HP. He gains at least three abilities: Carrion Swarm, Sleep, and [[Vampiric Touch]].''
