==Objectives==
Bring 5 Runed Saronite Plates to [[Crusader Olakin Sainrith]] at [[Blackwatch]].
* [[Runed Saronite Plate]] (5)

==Description==
Those shards you recovered can only have come from one place, [[Malykriss: The Vile Hold|Malykriss]]. It's the seat of the [[Lich King]]'s metalworking operations, to the east of [[Corp'rethar: The Horror Gate|Corp'rethar]].

What's puzzling is that metal isn't needed to stitch together abominations or flesh giants, or to summon skeletal servants. Find the [[Skeletal Runesmith|skeletal runesmiths]] working on the bottom level of Malykriss and capture the plates they're working on. We need to find out why this metal is finding its way to the [[Fleshwerks]].

==Progress==
Were you able to capture those rune plates?

==Completion==
These plates match the shards almost exactly. They must be using cuttings from them to "enhance" the [[ghoul]]s produced here. The Scourge is desperate enough to make a weapon of anything, it seems. All the more reason to hasten our destruction of this abominable place!

==Notes==
The runesmiths that drop the runed plates can be found in large quantity on the middle level to the southeast around {{coords|59|74|Icecrown}}
