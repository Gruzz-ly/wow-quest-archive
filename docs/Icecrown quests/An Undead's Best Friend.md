==Objectives==
[[Keritose Bloodblade]] at the [[Shadow Vault]] wants you to use the [[Eidolon Watcher]] to feed 18 Hungering Plaguehounds.
* [[Hungering Plaguehound|Hungering Plaguehounds]] fed (18)

==Description==
As is usual practice, the [[undead]] at the [[Saronite]] [[Weeping Quarry|quarry]] to the southwest starve [[plaguehound]]s to keep them extra aggressive. Use the shade to get up close and feed some of those hounds and I promise you they'll be content to leave you alone, if not side with the hand that fed them.

Don't get to close to those things until you've fed them though. Their noses don't fall victim to your shade's elusiveness. 

==Progress==
No need to be wasteful - those hounds will serve whoever bothers to feed them.

==Completion==
Put them right to sleep, didn't it?

==Progression==
