==Objectives==
Speak to [[Darkrider Arly]] at [[Blackwatch]].

==Description==
The [[Scourge]] has a large facility called the [[Fleshwerks]], dedicated to producing [[abomination]]s and [[flesh giant]]s. If we can shut it down, we can deprive the [[Lich King]] of a large component of his armies.

I've sent Darkrider Arly to the area. She has a small base, Blackwatch, on a ridge overlooking the Fleshwerks and to the west of [[Corp'rethar: The Horror Gate|Corp'rethar]]. I'm told the [[Argent Crusade]] is sending someone to coordinate their efforts there, but the [[Dark Riders of Acherus|darkrider]] will know what to do. Find and assist her.

==Completion==
Good. We'll need all the help we can get. [[Crusader Olakin Sainrith|Olakin]] is the [[Argent Crusade]]'s contribution to our effort. Let's cut the chatter and get down to the business of denying the Scourge their armies of the flesh.

==Notes==
Blackwatch can be found between Corp'rethar and the Fleshwerks high up on the ridge at {{coords|35.4|66.3|Icecrown}}
