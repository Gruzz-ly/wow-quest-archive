==Objectives==
Return to [[Thassarian]] aboard the [[Skybreaker]].

==Description==
You should leave now. You'll find a portal behind me. It'll take you to the surface.

We'll meet again. He'll be looking for you.

It's only a matter of time until he finds you.

==Completion==
It's you, <name>! We thought you were a goner!

That explosion of yours put quite a bit of hurt on the [[Scourge]]. Nearly took [[Captain Kendall|Captain's Kendall's]]{{Sic}} eyebrows off in the process...
