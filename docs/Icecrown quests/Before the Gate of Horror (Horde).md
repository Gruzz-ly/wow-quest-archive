==Objectives==
[[Koltira Deathweaver]], aboard ''[[Orgrim's Hammer]]'', wants you to use the Volatile Acid to dissolve the remains of 6 Skeletal Reavers.
* [[Skeletal Reaver]] bones dissolved (6)
Suggested Players [5]
* [[Volatile Acid]] (provided)

==Description==
[[The Conflagration]], the ground before [[Corp'rethar]], south of the [[Ironwall Rampart]], is where the [[Lich King]]'s elite soldiers have formed up to defend the [[Icecrown Citadel|citadel]].

Led by a contingent of death knights, a legion of skeletal reavers bars the way. I fear that even when these reavers fall, the [[Scourge]] will simply reconstitute them and send them back at us.

I've come up with a plan to stop this, but I have no way of knowing if it will work. Take this solution and use it to dissolve the remains of the reavers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}} or {{cost|13|23}} at level 80
*22050 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Knights of the Ebon Blade]]

==Completion==
<Koltira listens to your report.>

Good. I'll have the engineers mix up as much of that acid as they can before we prepare to assault Corp'rethar with the main force.

==Notes==
Many Skeletal Reavers can be found at {{coords|45|65|Icecrown}}.
