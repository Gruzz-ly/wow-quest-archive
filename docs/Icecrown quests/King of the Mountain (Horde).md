==Objectives==
[[Blast Thunderbomb]] in [[Ymirheim]] wants you to use his [[Thunderbomb's Jumpbot]] to plant the Horde Battle Standard in the skulls at the top of the mountain.
* [[Horde Battle Standard]] planted

==Description==
Yo, <name>, I need you to get my jumpbot to the top of this mountain to the southeast, like yesterday!

That girly, self-righteous [[Frazzle Geargrinder]] thinks that her jumpbot's better than mine. Hah! We're in a race to see who's gonna be king of the mountain!

Once you jump up there, plant our battle standard in the pile of bones and show everyone that the Horde, and my mad engineering skills, are the best! 

==Completion==
I knew you were the right <race> for the job!

<Blast pats you hard on the back.>

I gotta admit that right now you're my favorite <class> of all time!

What do you say to a repeat performance again tomorrow? I can make it worth your while!

==Notes==
Hit 3 then choose a target to land at. Not on the GCD or any cooldown. Use it to get to the top of the mountain, then hit 1 to plant the banner.

If there happens to be any members of the Alliance out and about, hit 2 and lay down rockets at the targeted spot to knock them back and do some damage!

The jumpbot is immune to fall damage.

==Progression==
# [[Get to Ymirheim! (Horde)]]
