==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]], aboard the [[Skybreaker]], wants you to collect 5 Demolisher Parts from the [[Scavenging Geist]]s and take them to the [[Wrecked Demolisher]] in the [[Valley of Lost Hope]].
* [[Demolisher Parts]] (5)

==Description==
All right. Let's not celebrate just yet. We need to capitalize on the momentum we've gathered with our little bombing mission.

We've spotted a workable [[Horde]] demolisher-class catapult in the field below. The [[geist]] seem to be taking it apart.

If you can put it back together, we'll be able to do some serious damage to the [[Scourge]]'s armies in the Valley.

Sure, you'll be a little outnumbered, but I've a lot of faith in you! 

==Progress==
The demolisher has suffered much damage.

==Completion==
The Demolisher has seen better days, but the structure hasn't suffered any permanent damage. The parts you obtained should be enough to get it running again, at least temporarily.

==Notes==
The Wrecked Demolisher is a few hundred yards north of [[Mord'rethar: The Death Gate]] on the east side of the glacier at {{coords|68.0|51.8|Icecrown}}

The geist litter the valley.
