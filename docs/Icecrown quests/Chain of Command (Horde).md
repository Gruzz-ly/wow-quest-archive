==Objectives==
[[Koltira Deathweaver|Koltira]] aboard ''[[Orgrim's Hammer]]'' wants you to go to [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]] and defeat [[Overseer Faedris]], [[Overseer Savryn]], [[Overseer Veraj]], and [[Overseer Jhaeqon]].
*[[Overseer Faedris]] Killed
*[[Overseer Jhaeqon]] Killed
*[[Overseer Veraj]] Killed
*[[Overseer Savryn]] Killed

==Description==
Based on your report, and my knowledge of the [[Cult of the Damned|Cult]], they have an overseer managing the operation of each encampment on the gate.

While taking their leaders down will only be a temporary setback, it will at least slow them down and keep them off-balance. And that, <race>, is a worthy enough goal for now.

Seek out these overseers and return to me when they have been dispatched. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Cultist's Cowl
|Jhaeqon's Tunic
|Savryn's Muddy Boots
|Cultbreaker's Chestguard}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Progress==
Yes, <race>?

==Completion==
Well done, <race>. But don't break your arm patting yourself on the back. They'll have those overseers replaced in no time...
