== Objectives ==
Report to [[the Ebon Watcher]] in the [[Valley of Echoes]] just outside the [[Breach (Icecrown)|Breach]]. 

== Description ==
The [[Argent Vanguard|Vanguard]] is secure, ally. We have reclaimed the [[Valley of Echoes]] and taken down the web walls blocking entry to the Breach. Now is the time to strike at [[Scourgeholme]] and establish our presence inside [[Icecrown]]. The battlefront moves on!

I have asked the Ebon Watcher for his assistance with our assault upon Scourgeholme. His intimate knowledge of the Scourge will be invaluable in our effort.

Go now and report to him at the tent outside of the Breach, northwest of here. 

== Completion ==
:'''For non-[[death knight]]s:'''
My knowledge of [[Scourge]] tactics is without equal.

<The Ebon Watcher peers at you.>

Before the [[battle for Light's Hope Chapel]], my knights and I served under the [[Lich King]] - his icy grasp controlling our every action. [[The Light of Dawn (quest)|The light of dawn]] changed everything...

:'''For death knights:'''
Your power has grown, my faithful knight.

<Highlord Darion Mograine peers at you.>

Vengeance is at hand, <brother/sister>. Koltira aids the Horde upon the gunship Orgrim's Hammer, while Thassarian assists the Alliance aboard the Skybreaker. The Ebon Blade will soon wash over Icecrown and leave the armies of the Lich King in ruin.

== Notes ==
The Ebon Watcher can be found at {{coords|83.0|72.9|Icecrown}}.
