==Objectives==
[[The Bone Witch]] in [[Njorndar Village]] wants you to defeat Iskalder upon [[Battlescar Spire]].
* [[Iskalder]] defeated in battle
Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
Atop the tallest peak to the southwest overlooking [[Jotunheim]] is Battlescar Spire. It is a place of reverence for the [[vrykul]], second only to [[Valhalas]] in terms of where they prefer to do honorable combat.

We shall visit not-so-honorable combat upon it.

Gather your companions and fly to the spire. When you are ready, light the signal fire and I will appear within the body of Iskalder.

We will fight, you will win, and [[Vardmadra]] is sure to come to witness the battle! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Wristguard of the Bone Witch|Njorndar Furywraps|Iskalder's Fate|Battlescar Spirebands}}

==Progress==
You have yet to defeat the ancient hero!

==Completion==
I've put Vardmadra aside for the moment. She's someplace safe until we can enact our final revenge!

==Notes==
:{{text|yell|Possessed Iskalder yells: Now fight me, <name>! Kill Iskalder!}}
:{{text|yell|Vardmadra yells: Iskalder, there you are. What is this? Engaged in battle already?}}
:{{text|yell|Vardmadra yells: Very well. Finish these lesser beings and let us be about our business.}}
:{{text|yell|Vardmadra yells: NO! How is this possible?}}
:{{text|yell|Vardmadra yells: I know not how this was possible, but you must still be judged Iskalder. Wait... what is this?}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Nightswood yells: This? This is me taking control of you. This is me setting up my final revenge!}}
:{{text|yell|Vardmadra yells: Stay away from me creature! Do not touch me!}}
:{{text|yell|Vardmadra yells: Ahahahahahaha! It is done. Return to my cave. We have much to discuss!}}

==Progression==
{{:Eliminate the Competition}}

==Notes==
Although the recommended players is listed as 5, Iskalder is soloable, although for anyone below plate armor this may prove a challenge. Iskalder is susceptible to stuns, and takes damage easily. A rogue can defeat him solo with skillful use of evasion and kidney shot, although they will be left on low health. A tank and one DPS or Healer can easily beat him.
