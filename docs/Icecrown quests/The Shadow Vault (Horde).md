== Objectives ==
Report back to [[Baron Sliver]] at [[Shadow Vault|The Shadow Vault]]. 

== Description ==
It sounds like you did extremely well. And you secured three very important allies for the [[Knights of the Ebon Blade]] in the process.

<Koltira gazes down at the map on the floor.>

You should head back. By now, Baron Sliver and the other death knights will be fighting tooth and nail to hold The Shadow Vault against the might of the [[Scourge]].

I'm sure they'll need your help. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Softly Glowing Orb
|Chuchu's Tiny Box of Horrors
|Thorny Rose Brooch}}
You will also receive: {{cost||74}}

== Completion ==
Good of you to return. As you can see, we have our hands full here.

== Notes ==
The Shadow Vault is now in a new phase. The Baron can be found southwest of his previous position at {{coords|42.9|25.0|Icecrown}}

Completing this quest also opens up the [[Icecrown Citadel]] quest chain starting with [[Opportunity (quest)]] from [[Koltira Deathweaver]] aboard ''[[Orgrim's Hammer]]''.
