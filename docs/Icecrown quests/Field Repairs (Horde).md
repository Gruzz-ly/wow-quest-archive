== Objectives ==
[[Koltira Deathweaver]] aboard [[Orgrim's Hammer]] wants you to collect 5 Demolisher Parts from the [[Scavenging Geist]]s in the [[Valley of Lost Hope]] and take them to the [[Wrecked Demolisher]].
* [[Demolisher Parts]] (5)

== Description ==
The [[Scourge]] is still reeling from our attack, <name>. Now is the time to capitalize on our momentum.

The strategically important valley below us is wide open. We've located a disassembled demolisher vehicle in what we believe is working condition in the southeastern corner of the Valley of Lost Hope area.

If you can get the remaining parts from the Scourge scavengers, you should be able to get it running again. A single working demolisher can wreak havoc on the enemy's ground units. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

== Progress ==
The demolisher has suffered much damage.

== Completion ==
The Demolisher has seen better days, but the structure hasn't suffered any permanent damage. The parts you obtained should be enough to get it running again, at least temporarily.

== Notes ==
The Demolisher is found at {{coords|68|52|Icecrown}}.
