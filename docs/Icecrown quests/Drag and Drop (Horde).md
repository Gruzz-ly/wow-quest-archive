==Objectives==
[[Koltira Deathweaver|Koltira]], aboard ''[[Orgrim's Hammer]]'', wants you to collect [[Orb of Illusion|Orbs of Illusion]] from [[Bitter Initiate]]s at [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]] and use them on 3 Dark Subjugators there.
* [[Dark Subjugator]] Dragged and Dropped (3)

==Description==
The [[Cult of the Damned]] hold the gate of desolation, eh? No surprise there.

Time to have a little fun. At the southern end of the gate, you mentioned there were new cultists being trained. They're almost certain to be holding a special item given to all initiates - an Orb of Illusion.

These artifacts are used to disguise a cult member, allowing them to gain safe passage, infiltrate, or simply blend in with an enemy.

Kill the fools until you find one, <class>, then use it on a subjugator.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}} or {{cost|13|23}} at level 80
*22050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes, <race>?

==Completion==
An effective tool, given the circumstances, wouldn't you say?

That one never gets old....

==Notes==
Throwing the Orb at a subjugator will aggro an [[Aldur'thar Sentry]] on the subjugator who will drop him/her from some height. 

==Progression==
