==Objectives==
Deliver Father Gustav's Report to [[Highlord Tirion Fordring]] at the [[Argent Vanguard]] in [[Icecrown]].
* [[Father Gustav's Report]] (Provided)

==Description==
[[Crusade Architect Silas|Silas]] and [[Crusade Engineer Spitzpatrick|Spitzpatrick]] have signed off on the [[The Stone That Started A Revolution|materials]] and [[It Could Kill Us All|fuel]] needed to begin construction of Justice Keep. Thanks to you and the Ebon Blade the Scourge presence within Scourgeholme has been decimated and their lieutenants have been defeated.

I have chosen the site at which we will break ground, but first you must deliver my report to Highlord Tirion Fordring. We will begin our march into Icecrown on his command. 

==Progress==
Stand easy, <name>. What have you to report?

==Completion==
Your assistance has been integral in securing the front. The first true victory of the war is close at hand - which is why our next step is the most crucial.

Rest assured, <name>, the [[Scourge]] will not give up without a fight. Your most difficult challenge awaits.

==Notes==
The completion of [[It Could Kill Us All]], [[The Stone That Started A Revolution]] and [[The Air Stands Still]] are all required before Gustav will offer this quest.
