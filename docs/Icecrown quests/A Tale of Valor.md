==Objectives==
[[Highlord Tirion Fordring]] at [[Crusaders' Pinnacle]] has requested that you locate the hero, [[Crusader Bridenbrad]] at the [[Silent Vigil]], in northeast [[Icecrown]]. His fire pit will likely be the most obvious indication of his location from the air. 

==Description==
Perhaps you've heard the praises for our missing hero?

Crusader Bridenbrad was in the [[Broken Front]] aiding the attack against the [[Scourge]] when the undead army came down upon them. The many men of that allied force scattered, but Bridenbrad alone returned and dragged more than a dozen men to safety, one by one through the carnage.

<Class>, he has not returned since. He was spotted heading to the far northeast, towards the Silent Vigil. Bring him back to me that I might honor him for his valor.

==Completion==
Back! Careful! The [[Plague of Undeath|plague]] has gripped me and I'll not see it spread to you nor anyone else.

==Notes==
Crusader Bridenbrad can be found at {{coords|79|30|Icecrown}}.
