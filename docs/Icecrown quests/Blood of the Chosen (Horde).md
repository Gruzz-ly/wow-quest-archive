== Objectives ==
[[Warbringer Davos Rioht]] on ''[[Orgrim's Hammer]]'' has sent you to kill 20 [[vrykul]] in [[Ymirheim]].
* Ymirheim Vrykul slain (20)

== Description ==
Those vrykul that have gained the favor of the [[Lich King]] call themselves the [[Ymirjar]]. They inhabit a city in the center of [[Icecrown]]. We have a lot of preparations to make before we assault [[Icecrown Citadel]], and the one that stands before us now is routing these so-called "Chosen" of the Lich King.

Go to their city, Ymirheim, and slaughter them in their home. Let there be no questions as to who the stronger combatants are here. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

== Completion ==
Not so strong after all, it seems. The Lich King will get what's coming for him.

== Notes ==
Any vrykul within Ymirheim (except for the Val'kyr in the Saronite Mines) will count for this quest, including the ones that jump you while doing [[Assault by Ground (Horde)]].
