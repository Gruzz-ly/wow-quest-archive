==Objectives==
[[The Leaper]] at [[Shadow Vault (Icecrown)|The Shadow Vault]] wants you to duel and defeat [[Sigrid Iceborn]], [[Efrem the Faithful]], [[Onu'zun]] and [[Tinky Wickwhistle (Icecrown)|Tinky Wickwhistle]].
* [[Sigrid Iceborn]] defeated
* [[Efrem the Faithful]] defeated
* [[Onu'zun]] defeated
* [[Tinky Wickwhistle (Icecrown)|Tinky Wickwhistle]] defeated

==Description==
Mrrfrmrfrrmrrr...

<The Leaper clears his throat.>

Sorry about that. It can sometimes be hard to understand what I'm saying. You know how it is.

I wanted to make sure that if you find yourself at the [[Savage Ledge]], over the mountains to the west, that you make sure to eliminate the competition there.

Specifically, I'd like you to challenge to duels and humiliate Sigrid Iceborn, Efrem the Faithful, Onu'zun, and Tinky Wickwhistle in front of the [[vrykul]]. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sigrid's Mittens
|Efrem's Bracers
|Gauntlets of Onu'zun
|Chestplate of the Glacial Crusader
|Iron Coffin Lid}}

==Progress==
Why are you here?

Go and humiliate them!

==Completion==
That was important, <name>. By driving them off, you're keeping them from interfering with whatever we need you to do over there.

==Notes==
The mobs are all found at the [[Savage Ledge]] to the west. It should be done together with the quest [[Honor Challenge]].

Challenging [[Sigrid Iceborn]]{{coords|37.1|22.5|Icecrown}}:
:Do not bother me, pest. I am studying the inept fighting of these so-called combatants.

:I will best them all, and then I will be elevated to serve the [[Lich King]].

:{{gossip|I've heard that vrykul women cannot fight at all. If you wish to prove me wrong, you can try.}}
:{{text|say|Sigrid Iceborn|Taste my steel, little <boy/girl>!}}
:{{text|say|Sigrid Iceborn|You fight well, little one. I am bested for now. [[Battle at Valhalas: The Return of Sigrid Iceborn|We will meet again]] I assure you. When we do I will be much better prepared!}}
Sigrid will occasionally leap backwards ([[Disengage]]?) to strike you with a ranged attack.  If she is faced the wrong way, this could result in adds joining the combat.


Challenging [[Efrem the Faithful]]{{coords|37.9|25.1|Icecrown}}:
:What are YOU doing here?

:Just make sure that you stay out of my way. I didn't leave the [[Scarlet Onslaught]] to be distracted by the likes of you!

:{{gossip|I challenge you to a duel, Scarlet scum!}}
:{{text|say|Efrem the Faithful|You dare to touch ME?! You won't keep me from proving myself to the Lich King.}}
:{{text|say|Efrem the Faithful|Wait, wait... I surrender! Please, no more. I'll leave!}}

Challenging [[Onu'zun]]{{coords|37.9|22.9|Icecrown}}:
:Onu'zun here to challenge the vrykul and work himself up in the ranks.

:Then when Onu'zun fight in [[Valhalas]] and win, Onu'zun gonna be workin' for the Lich King!

:{{gossip|I have bad news for you Onu'zun: I'm gonna have to cut short your dreams!}}
:{{text|say|Onu'zun|Onu'zun gonna kill you dead!}}
:{{text|say|Onu'zun|Onu'zun is number one! You are number two!}}
:--or--
:{{text|say|Onu'zun|Onu'zun is defeated by the ugliest person ever!}}
:{{text|say|Onu'zun|Onu'zun go now. You'll miss me.}}

Challenging [[Tinky Wickwhistle (Icecrown)|Tinky Wickwhistle]]{{coords|36.1|23.6|Icecrown}}; if [[Alliance]] players completed the good Tinky's quests back in [[Borean Tundra]]:
:Hey, I recognize you! I guess I have you to thanks for me being here. That [[Let Bixie Know|teleport accident]] was the best thing that ever happened to me.
:If you find yourself back in Borean Tundra, let my [[Tinky Wickwhistle|goody two-shoes nerd of a duplicate]] know that I've moved up in the world quite a bit!
Or if not:
:Are you here to prove yourself to the Lich King as well?

:It's kind of archaic, don't you think? Having to fight and survive?

:{{gossip|Sorry, Tinky, but I can't afford you as a distraction while I'm doing what needs to be done here.}}
:{{text|say|Tinky Wickwhistle|Grrrrrrr! I'll kneecap ya!}}
:{{text|say|Tinky Wickwhistle|YOU'RE NO FUN!}}
:''Tinky runs to the ledge and equips a parachute cloak...''
:{{text|say|Tinky Wickwhistle|WHEE!!!}}
