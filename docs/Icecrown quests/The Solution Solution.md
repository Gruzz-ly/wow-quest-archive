'''The Solution Solution''' is one of several [[Icecrown]] [[daily]] quests which are essentially repeats of their prerequisites, which in this case means luring [[frost wyrm]]s with explosive bait using salvage found at the [[Broken Front]]. It may be paired with the other Broken Front daily, [[That's Abominable! (Alliance daily)]]. It is offered from the [[Skybreaker]], the Alliance airship circling above and to the north of the quest area.

==Objectives==
[[Chief Engineer Boltwrench]] aboard the ''[[Skybreaker]]'' wants you to use the [[Smuggled Solution]] at the [[Broken Front]].

Using the solution will require an [[Abandoned Helm]], [[Abandoned Armor]], and a [[Pile of Bones (Icecrown)]], all found at the Broken Front.
*[[Frostbrood Skytalon|Frostbrood Skytalons]] Destroyed (3)

==Description==
Oh, yes, yes. Back again, are we? Never enough practice, I suppose.

Here we are, the solution to that pesky [[frost wyrm|frostwyrm]] problem.

Make them scarce, <race>. The more you take out now, the less we face when we are again ready to attempt our march on the [[Icecrown Citadel|citadel]].

Best of luck, now. And do bring back whatever you don't use. 
* [[Smuggled Solution]] (provided)

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}}
*22,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes, friend?

==Completion==
Good show!  Good show indeed.  You're turning into a regular wyrmslayer!

Come back when you're ready to thin their numbers even further.

==Notes==
*This is one of several [[Icecrown]] daily quests with only a gold and experience reward, and no [[reputation]]. They may have been intended simply for those benefits, or they may have been added to allow players to re-experience particularly unique or fun quests - in this case, making [[frost wyrm]]s explode.
*The title is a play on words, using both the chemical and problem-solving definitions of "solution".

==Progression==
