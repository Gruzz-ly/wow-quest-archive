==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]], aboard the ''[[Skybreaker]]'', wants you to collect the 3 pages of Cultists' Research from the [[Cult Researcher]]s at [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]] and use them to create the Cult of the Damned Thesis..

[[Cult of the Damned Thesis]]
*Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
The [[Cult of the Damned]] are notorious for concocting grandiose plans that in the end, rarely succeed. But something feels different this time....

Perhaps it's the proximity to the [[Lich King]] that has their fervor heightened. Whatever it is, they appear to be more confident that ever. We must know what feeds this bravado and then find a way strip them of it!

I believe the key lies with their researchers. Find out what they're up to and report back to me with the details. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*22050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|13|23}} at max level)

==Progress==
Have you determined what their researchers are up to, <race>?

==Completion==
This is alarming, indeed...

==Notes==
The cult researchers are found inside the northern building of Aldur'thar.

==Trivia==
There is a slight Easter Egg in this quest. The terms "Cannot Reproduce", "Not a Bug", and "Need More Info" are terms used for "states" of a bug tracked in the program "DevTrack", which is used by Quality Assurance Testers and developers to communicate about bugs written up by the testers. Therefore, this is a slight homage to QA Testers throughout the game industry.
