== Objectives ==
[[Vaelen the Flayed]] at [[Ufrang's Hall]] has asked you to retrieve the [[Key to Vaelen's Chains]].
* [[Key to Vaelen's Chains]]

== Description ==
<Class>, the key to my shackles is hanging around the neck of [[Instructor Hroegar]] outside.

Perhaps you could retrieve it by separating his head from his shoulders?

== Progress ==
Do you have it?

== Completion ==
Thank you, <race>. Just hand me the key, I'll take care of it myself.

== Notes ==
You might want to accomplish this quest while working on [[Shadow Vault Decree]], as the NPCs required are fairly near each other.

[[Let the Baron Know]] is a direct followup to this quest, though ''Shadow Vault Decree'' only puts you in the right area to pick this quest up.

==Progression==
