==Objectives==
Speak with [[Geirrvif]] in Valhalas.

==Description==
I see and hear many things, <name>, and something very important has happened since your defeat of [[Overthane Balargarde]]: you are wanted for battle in [[Valhalas]]!

You will find the battle pit to the north. Go now with your friends and speak with Geirrvif the [[val'kyr]]. The challengers that she will offer you within Valhalas are sure to require their help.

Good luck. 

==Completion==
You have bested our finest warriors. Your name is renowned, <name>.

Perhaps you think that this concerns me: it does not. If they can fall to you then they are not worthy and should be nothing but lowly vargul!

But perhaps I can give you and your friends different sport. Valhalas is also a place for combat of all types with many different kinds of foes.

Speak to me again when you and your friends are ready to proceed. We shall see if you are truly worthy.
