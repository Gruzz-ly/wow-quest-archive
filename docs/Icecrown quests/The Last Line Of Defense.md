This quest starts (and ends) a phase of [[The Argent Vanguard]] and the [[Valley of Echoes]], where the scourge attack, with Nerubians, scourge of various sorts, and [[Frostbrood Destroyer]]s.

==Objectives==
Use an [[Argent Cannon]] to destroy 100 [[Scourge]] Attackers. You must also kill 3 [[Frostbrood Destroyer]]s.

Return to [[Siegemaster Fezzik]] should you succeed.
*Scourge Attackers slain (100)
*[[Frostbrood Destroyer]] slain (3)

==Description==
I've triggered the base's defenses, <class>! Atop each of the Vanguard's four towers is a retractable Argent Crusade cannon, blessed by [[Father Gustav]] himself. You'll need to fly up to one of those towers and man a cannon. Use it to destroy the Scourge onslaught that the [[Lich King]] has deployed.

Just one warning, the Scourge will undoubtedly send their [[frost wyrm]]s to lay siege the towers. Shoot them out of the sky! If they destroy the walls and towers of this base, we're done for! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Cannoneer's Morale
|Fezzik's Pocketwatch
|Cannoneer's Fuselighter
}}

==Progress==
The screams of the dying will haunt me forever! Help them!

==Completion==
You have handled the cannon like a goblin gunner, friend. You've saved the Vanguard and the [[Argent Crusade]] - all the while backing [[Highlord Tirion Fordring|the Highlord himself]] up on the field of battle! Amazing!

==Notes==
Shoot with the Argent Cannon until it has enough mana for the Reckoning Bomb, which unleashes the Reckoning upon the Scourge, inflicting ridiculous amounts of damage. Some might even say the damage is ludicrous.

The "Reckoning Bomb" attack, described as "... inflicting ridiculous amounts of damage. Some might even say the damage is ludicrous," is a reference to [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4443506634239856545 this video] where a level 60 [[paladin]] soloed [[Lord Kazzak (tactics)|Lord Kazzak]] in the [[Blasted Lands]] that forced a nearly immediate [[hotfix]] to prevent it from happening again.
