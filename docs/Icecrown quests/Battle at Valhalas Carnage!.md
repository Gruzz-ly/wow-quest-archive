==Objectives==
[[Geirrvif]] at [[Valhalas]] has challenged you to defeat Carnage.

Should you succeed, speak with [[Gjonner the Merciless]] overlooking the southern lip of Valhalas.
* [[Carnage]] Defeated
Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
You've been successful up to this point, <name>, but what you must face to continue to battle within Valhalas is a gigantic horror beyond imagining.

I must warn you to turn away now. Carnage is a [[flesh giant|mountain of flesh]] constructed by the [[Lich King]]'s most fiendish minds.

I do not see how you and your friends will defeat it. However, the choice is yours. 

==Completion==
I'm starting to respect your prowess in the ring, <name>. Now I really don't like you.

I would much rather have preferred to see you and your friends stuck to the bottom of that flesh giant's foot!

:{{text|yell|Geirrvif|From the bowels of the Underhalls comes Carnage. Brave and foolish <name> has accepted the challenge. <name> and <his/her> group stand ready to face the monstrosity.}}
:{{text|emote|Lumbering in from the south, the smell of Carnage precedes him!}}
:{{text|yell|Geirrvif|The horror known as Carnage is no more. Could it be that <name> is truly worthy of battle in Valhalas? We shall see.}}
