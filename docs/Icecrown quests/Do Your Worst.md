== Objectives ==
Use the [[Refurbished Demolisher]] to destroy 150 [[Decomposed Ghoul]]s, 20 [[Frostskull Magus|Frostskull Mages]] and 2 [[Bone Giant]]s in the [[Valley of Lost Hope]]. Speak to [[Matthias Lehner]] at the [[First Legion Forward Camp]] when you've completed this task.
* [[Decomposed Ghoul]] slain (150)
* [[Frostskull Magus]] slain (20)
* [[Bone Giant]] slain (2)

== Description ==
You're going to use this machine against the [[Scourge]]? You're not going to win against them like that.

You can destroy hundreds... even thousands of them. But you won't win. Not out here.

When you're done playing with your machine, meet me to the north. There is an old army encampment. What I will show you will teach you a little bit about who you're up against. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Demolisher Driver's Dustcoat
|Refurbished Demolisher Gear Belt
|Drivetrain Chain Leggings
|Accelerator Stompers
|Demolisher's Grips}}

== Progress ==
Are you done playing with your war machines?

== Completion ==
You see? You killed your fair share, but for every one you destroyed, another rose from the dirt to take its place.

You don't know what you're up against, <name>. Let me show you.

== Notes ==
Hop in the demolisher. #1 is Ram, a knockback doing about 20,000 damage. #2 is Hurl Boulder, a targeted AoE with a 70 yard range doing about 13,000 damage, enough to 1-shot ghouls and magi. #3 is Double Speed, 100% movement speed increase for 10 sec.

The bone giants have about 50,000 HP.
