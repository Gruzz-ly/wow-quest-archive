==Objectives==
Report to [[Vereth the Cunning]] on the [[Rise of Suffering]]. 

==Description==
I've already heard some rumors regarding [[Malykriss: The Vile Hold|Malykriss]] and [[Arthas]]'s new [[death knight]] order, but I assumed it nothing more than filling the void. These numbers suggest he's trying to take it up a notch though.

We dispatched one of our best to Malykriss not long ago - Vereth the Cunning. You should be able to find him on the Rise of Suffering, just west of Malykriss, and inside the Court of Bones.

Try not to draw too much attention on your way in. 

==Completion==
The Vile Hold... a testament to how much Arthas hates losing. Let's drive the blade deep.

==Notes==
The Rise of Suffering is just to the southeast of Corp'rethar, west of Valykriss's entrance. Vereth stands at its southern tip at {{coords|53.9|71.5|Icecrown}}
