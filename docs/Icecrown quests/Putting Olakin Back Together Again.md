==Objectives==
Obtain a [[Spool of Thread]] and [[The Doctor's Cleaver]], then take them to the [[Sanctum of Reanimation]] Slab and use Olakin's remains to attempt to reanimate the crusader. Return to [[Darkrider Arly]] at [[Blackwatch]] when this task is complete.
* [[Crusader Olakin Sainrith]] revived
* [[Crusader Olakin's Remains]] (provided)

==Description==
We can't afford to waste any time putting Olakin back together. Fortunately, the [[Scourge]] has provided a perfect place for you to stitch him back together.

Near the [[Fleshwerks]]' [[flesh giant]] lab is the Sanctum of Reanimation. Search the area for a spool of thread and the doctor's cleaver. Then, take Olakin's remains to the large slab in the middle of the sanctum and get to work.

==Progress==
Have you put our brave crusader back together?

==Completion==
Olakin should consider himself fortunate. No one is rescued from the Scourge, no one. No amount of thread and heroism will save him a second time. I'll make certain he remembers it.

==Notes==
The Spool of Thread is in the alcove off to the left to the northwest inside (34,66). The Doctor's Cleaver is on one of the lab tables at the back of the cave to the southeast (36,67). The slab{{coords|35|66|Icecrown}}. is on the ledge between the room where the thread was and [["Stitches"]].
