==Objectives==
[[Vereth the Cunning]] at the [[Rise of Suffering]] wants you to use a [[Lithe Stalker]] to throw rocks at [[Umbral Brute]]s as they near lesser undead in [[Malykriss: The Vile Hold|Malykriss]]. Return after you've started 5 fights.
* Worker fight started (5)

==Description==
The major difference between [[vargul]] and lesser undead minions is that vargul still possess enough of their minds to despise being used for labor. Never will a vargul be pleased to be working aside [[skeleton]]s or [[ghoul]]s.

Lets take advantage of this inevitable animosity and start some fights between the umbral brutes and the other undead in Malykriss. That should serve to slow production and bring the [[death knight]]s down to babysit.

Should be simple - throw rocks at the brutes as they near lesser undead. 

==Progress==
Predictable louts.

==Completion==
No need to sacrifice our own men when they are this easily manipulated, eh?

==Notes==
The runeforging camp is an ideal location to complete this quest.

==Progression==
