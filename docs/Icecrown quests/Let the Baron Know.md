== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Baron Sliver]] at [[Shadow Vault (Icecrown)|The Shadow Vault]].

== Description ==
The most important thing that you can do right now is to return to The Shadow Vault and let Baron Sliver know that I've failed.

You see, I wasn't the only one captured by these [[vrykul]] devils. My entire contingent of [[death knight]]s was also taken.

I should have seen the trap before it was sprung, but there's no use crying over spilled milk now is there?

Go on before you get captured, too! I'll see you back at the vault. 

== Completion ==
What?! We can ill-afford to lose one death knight, let alone an entire contingent!!!

== Notes ==
Completing this quest opens up a number of quests at The Shadow Vault:
* [[Crush Dem Vrykuls!]] from [[Vile]]
* [[Leave Our Mark]] from [[Baron Sliver]]
* [[Vaelen Has Returned]] from [[Baron Sliver]]
* [[Vandalizing Jotunheim]] from [[Duke Lankral]]

==Progression==
