==Objectives==
Kill [[Master Summoner Zarod]] and use his [[:Master Summoner's Staff]] to destroy the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Summoning Altars. When you've completed this task, report to [[Darkrider Arly]] at [[Blackwatch]].
* First Summoning Altar destroyed
* Second Summoning Altar destroyed
* Third Summoning Altar destroyed
* Fourth Summoning Altar destroyed

==Description==
So they're summoning in their workers and warriors at those altars?

They'll need to be the first thing to go. The master summoner should have a staff which allows him to activate the portal. If you kill the master summoner and take the staff, you can use it to overload the summoning portal and destroy its altar.

Do this at all four of the altars and return to me once they've been destroyed. 

==Progress==
Are the summoning altars in ruins?

==Completion==
<Darkrider Aly nods in approval.>

Good. Now, we can focus our efforts on shutting down the rest of the [[Fleshwerks]].

==Notes==
Zarod is a [[lich]] pathing between all four altars.

==Progression==
