== Objectives ==
[[Darkspeaker R'khem]] in the [[Saronite Mines]] wants you to recover the Foreman's Key to his chains.
* [[Foreman's Key]]
* Suggested players: 3

== Description ==
<The creature speaks directly into your mind, its thoughts painful and strange.>

<race>-thing, I am in need of your assistance. Like your enslaved friends, I am a victim of the [[Lich King]]'s [[ymirjar]] and their avarice. When I rose from below to investigate the noises coming from this cavern they captured and chained me.

Will you please help me? The foreman of these mines holds the key to my chains. Kill him!

<You can feel a pushing against your mind as if the creature is trying to coerce you.> 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|The Darkspeaker's Footpads
|The Darkspeaker's Treads
|The Darkspeaker's Sabatons
|The Darkspeaker's Iron Walkers}}
You will also receive: {{cost|14|80}}

== Progress ==
You will be richly rewarded for your service to me.

<The darkspeaker projects soothing feelings into your mind.>

You will not regret unfettering me.

== Completion ==
<Another wave of euphoria, mixed with some pain, crashes through your mind as you approach the creature.>

Good... good! So that you know I am being fair, I will first give you your reward as I promised.

And then you will willingly hand me the key.

== Notes ==
After completing:
:Darkspeaker R'khem makes a strange noise that translates as laughter in your mind.

The Darkspeaker then teleports away as the chain falls to the ground.

This quest is fairly soloable. Thaldrin has 50,400 HP and is susceptible to all sorts of stuns, roots, etc...
