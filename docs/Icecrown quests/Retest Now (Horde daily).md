==Objectives==
[[Chief Engineer Copperclaw]] aboard [[Orgrim's Hammer]] wants you to throw a [[:Writhing Mass]] into a cauldron at [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]].
*Writhing Mass Banished
*[[Diluted Cult Tonic]] (provided)

==Description==
Those twisted cultists are looking for souls to put in their crazy-juice? Then let's help 'em out a bit!

Take a swig of this - don't worry, I've diluted it plenty... I'm almost positive that its only effect will be to detect any cultist's [[Tainted Essence|essence]].

Once you've collected a bunch of 'em, throw the writhing mass of twisted souls in one of their cauldrons.

Let's see how they like a taste of their own medicine!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

The cauldrons will award a 2 hour buff depending upon into which one you throw the mass;

'''Light Blue''' : +100 attack power

'''Green''' : +75 stamina

'''Dark Blue''' (Purple): +60 spell power

==Progress==
Well? How'd it turn out?

==Completion==
Wahoo!

That'll teach 'em!
