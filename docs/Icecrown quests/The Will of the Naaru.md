==Objectives==
Request the aid of [[A'dal]] in [[Shattrath City]].

==Description==
I appreciate everything that you have done for us, <name>. I have one last errand for you... one last gleaming hope for a [[paladin]] who deserves any salvation that we can extend.

Go now to Shattrath and speak to the [[naaru]], A'dal. He has long been a beacon of light and powerful ally to devout paladins. Impart [[Crusader Bridenbrad|Bridenbrad]]'s story and seek any aid that he might have to offer.

I cannot impress how important it is that you move quickly - I fear our crusader does not have much more time in this world. 

==Completion==
<A gentle ringing fills your head as you approach the naaru.>

I know why you have come.

==Notes==
On accepting the quest, [[Rhydian]] the [[Kirin Tor]] [[mage]] will walk over, saying:
:{{text|say|Rhydian|Hail. I could not help but overhear your conversation. Please allow me to lend some assistance.}}
After coming near, she will create a [[Portal (spell)|portal]] to [[Shattrath City]] for you. If you wait too long, the portal will disappear, but if you drop the quest and re-accept, she will create it again.
