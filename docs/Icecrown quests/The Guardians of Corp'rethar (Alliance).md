==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]], aboard the [[Skybreaker]], wants you to kill 5 [[Harbinger of Horror|Harbingers of Horror]] and 5 [[Corp'rethar Guardian]]s.
*[[Harbinger of Horror|Harbingers of Horror]] slain (5)
*[[Corp'rethar Guardian|Corp'rethar Guardians]] slain (5)
Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
[[Corp'rethar]], called the Horror Gate. It is the last barrier between us and the [[Icecrown Citadel]]. It waits to the south of the [[Ironwall Rampart]], beyond the glacier and [[The Conflagration]]. By the time our troops reach it, they will be exhausted and worse.

We must weaken its defenses, or our army's strength will break upon its walls.

Its battlements are manned by some of the [[Lich King]]'s fiercest and most zealous servants. Do all you can to destroy these guardians and hope it is enough. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|80}} (or {{cost|16|53}} at max level)
*27550 [[XP]]
*350 reputation with [[Knights of the Ebon Blade]]

==Completion==
I hope your success at Corp'rethar will prove an omen of the battle ahead. The Lich King cannot sit idly by as we march to the very gates of his stronghold.

==Notes==
The quest mobs can be found all along the ramparts.
Note that the Harbingers of Horror have a [[Knock back|knockback]] that can knock you off the rampart if you are not careful.  The Corp'rethar Guardians also have a [[Mortal Strike]]-like ability that can stack indefinitely, similar to [[Gluth]].
