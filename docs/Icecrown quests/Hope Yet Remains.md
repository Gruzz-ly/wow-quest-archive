==Objectives==
Return to [[Highlord Tirion Fordring]] at [[Crusaders' Pinnacle]] with news of the effects of the [[The Breath of Alexstrasza|Breath of Alexstrasza]]. 

==Description==
<[[Crusader Bridenbrad|Bridenbrad]] raises a hand to you as he catches his breath.>

It was nearly as painful as it looked, but it was as if I could feel some of the corruption being burnt away from within my body. It seems the [[Plague of Undeath|plague]] is not so readily bested though.

<Class>, thank you for everything that you have done. Your selfless actions have renewed my hope that there is yet great good left within this world - I can depart without fear that darkness will prevail in my absence.

Go now, go with no regrets.

==Completion==
The Scourge plague is no simple foe to defeat. [[Alexstrasza]]'s words suggest that perhaps we can yet save our Bridenbrad from the unimaginable fate of the unliving should he fall, but I will not give him up so easily.

There is yet one more path of light I would like to pursue. One more being who might avert this horrible fate.
