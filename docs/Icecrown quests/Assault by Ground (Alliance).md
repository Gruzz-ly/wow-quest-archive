==Objectives==
Escort the ''[[Skybreaker]]'' troops to the gates of [[Ymirheim]]. Return to [[Ground Commander Koup]] at the edge of the glacier east of Ymierheim for compensation after the task is complete.
* Alliance troops escorted to Ymirheim (4)

==Description==
Greetings <class>.

Our troops have been attempting to storm Ymirheim for some time, but these [[Vrykul]] are far more vicious than any we've faced before. They've been ambushing us repeatedly as we try to make it up the pass, and we've lost a lot of men.

If you want to lend yourself to the battle and help get my squad to the gates of Ymirheim safely, we will gladly reward you for your efforts. Once at the gates, we'll dig in and wait for reinforcements to catch up to us. 

==Progress==
Did you get some of my men up safely?

==Completion==
You have my thanks.

This has been a brutal operation, but we haven't had any great options otherwise - they've been equally unforgiving to aerial assault. We need to route these vrykul if we're going to stand any chance of pressing on in [[Icecrown]].

We're likely to need more help later. Please lend yourself to the battle again should the chance present itself.

==Notes==
The player is joined by 6 NPCs. At least 4 need to make it to the gates.

There are 4 packs of "ambushes" of ~5 vrykul and one lone mob standing by the gate.

The Vrykul that jump you while doing this quest work for the quest [[Blood of the Chosen (Alliance)]].

==Progression==
* [[Joining the Assault (Alliance)]]
** [[Assault by Air (Alliance)]]
