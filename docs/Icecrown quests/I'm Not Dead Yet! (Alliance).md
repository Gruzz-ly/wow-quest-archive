==Objectives==
Escort [[Father Kamaros]] to safety and then report to [[Absalan the Pious]] aboard the ''[[Skybreaker]]''.
* Escort Father Kamaros to safety

==Description==
The [[Light]] smiles upon me. I have not yet died in this [[Fleshwerks|living nightmare]], but the [[Scourge]] will kill me and tear my body apart for use in their 'work' here if I cannot escape.

I cannot make it on my own, my child, but with your help, I may yet live to fight the Scourge again.

Will you help me make my escape before the Scourge's butchers come to finish me off? 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Completion==
Thank the Light. I'd thought Father Kamaros dead, or [[undead|worse]]. Through your bravery and compassion, you have restored a great ally to the [[Argent Crusade]]. You have my thanks and those of the crusade.
