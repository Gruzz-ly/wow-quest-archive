This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Bring the Battered Hilt to [[Caladis Brightspear]] at [[Quel'Delar's Rest|Quel'Delar's rest]], south of the [[Argent Tournament Grounds]].
*[[Battered Hilt]] (provided)

==Description==
This battered old sword hilt has seen better days. Before the hilt was snapped from the blade, it must've been a magnificent example of the blacksmith's art.

The graceful symbols and exotic gemstones decorating the hilt suggest that the weapon may have belonged to a powerful person. Surely, the [[Silver Covenant]] members would be interested in hearing about the recovery of such an artifact. Seek out their representative at Quel'Delar's Rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|80}}
*16550 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What is it you have there?

==Completion==
<Caladis takes the hilt from you and slowly turns it over in his hands.>

This seems somehow familar, as though I should know its origins. You say you recovered this in the [[Icecrown Citadel|citadel]]? Most intriguing.

There are few who possess the ability to make such a blade. Perhaps they can tell us something about your find.

==Notes==
If the script event at Quel'Delar's rest is currently taking place, Brightspear will be unavailable. Wait until he returns to his waiting position before trying to turn in the quest.
