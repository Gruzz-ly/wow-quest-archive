==Objectives==
[[Baron Sliver]] at [[The Shadow Vault]] has asked you to collect a Cultist Rod, an Abomination Hook, a Geist Rope, and 5 Scourge Essences.
* [[Cultist Rod]]
* [[Abomination Hook]]
* [[Geist Rope]]
* [[Scourge Essence]]: (5)

==Description==
When I was in the - ahem - employ of the [[Lich King]], we would often use a device known as a [[Sovereign Rod|sovereign rod]] to keep some of the more intelligent [[Scourge]] in line.

I require that you assist me in the construction of a new one.

Luckily for you, all of the necessary components are at hand: a [[Cult of the Damned|cultist]] rod, an [[abomination]] hook, a [[geist]] rope, and a handful of Scourge essences.

This should not be difficult, <class>. 

==Progress==
When you've managed to acquire that which I have asked of you, I will fashion the device, with a few modifications for our purposes, and we'll be on with our business.

==Completion==
Quickly, hand them to me and stay out of sight!

The rod, the hook, and the rope are all very self-evident in their usage when combined. I just need to infuse the result with the essences and we'll be ready to proceed.

It's all very mundane in its composition, but extraordinary in its application!

==Notes==
The named items drop from the respective types of mobs... the scourge essences will drop from any of the undead.
