This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
[[Caladis Brightspear]] at [[Quel'Delar's Rest]] wants you to obtain 5 [[Infused Saronite Bar]]s and use the [[The Forgemaster's Hammer|Forgemaster's Hammer]] to combine them with the [[Remnants of Quel'Delar]] to create the [[Reforged Quel'Delar]].
* [[Reforged Quel'Delar]]
* [[Remnants of Quel'Delar]] (provided)

==Description==
We cannot allow [[Quel'Delar]] to remain broken and disgraced. Take the remnants of the sword, along with the battered hilt you discovered, and venture into the [[Pit of Saron]] within [[Icecrown Citadel]].

In the pit, the [[Lich King]] uses slaves to mine, process, and transform [[saronite]] ore. This infused saronite is what we will use to rebuild Quel'Delar.

You must gather bars of infused saronite and capture the forgemaster's hammer, then bring them to the forgemaster's anvil and re-forge the sword.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Progress==
Were you able to reconstruct Quel'Delar?

==Completion==
You have remade the blade of Quel'Delar, although [[Blood-Queen Lana'thel]] proclaimed we could not! The blade must still be tempered, but she and her master will not stand in our way.

==Notes==
There are plenty of {{loot|common|Infused Saronite Bar|Infused Saronite Bars}} on the ground in the Pit of Saron. [[The Forgemaster's Hammer]] drops off [[Forgemaster Garfrost]], and his anvils are right beside him.

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 3.3.0|note=Added.}}
