==Objectives==
[[The Bone Witch]] at [[Njorndar Village]] has asked you to exact her revenge by challenging and defeating Overthane Balargarde.
* [[Overthane Balargarde]] slain
Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
The time has come, <name>. You and your friends must challenge the lord of [[Balargarde Fortress]], the master of [[Jotunheim]], Overthane Balargarde.

Atop the fortress, which is on the southwestern edge of Jotunheim, you will find a horn. Blow into it. Allow your challenge to resound throughout the steadfast.

Balargarde will have no choice but to face you. And I... excuse me, [[Vardmadra]] will be there to adjudicate the challenge.

<The [[banshee]]-possessed [[vrykul]] lets out a bellowing cackle.> 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Vengance Shiv|Quickblade of Cold Return|The Witching Grimoire|Bonecaster's Endgame|Bulwark of Redemption}}

==Completion==
Words cannot describe what I'm feeling at the moment, <name>. My revenge is complete and there is naught else for me to do.

If only I could be there when the [[Lich King]] is finally taken down.

Don't fool yourself though. [[Jotunheim]] is far from 'dealt' with. I will remain in possession of this witch until such time as the vrykul are no longer a threat.

Look around, there are many items of value in this cave. Take your pick.
