== Objectives ==
Report to [[Crusade Commander Entari]] at the [[Argent Vanguard]] in [[Icecrown]].

== Description ==
Long has been the path to our salvation, young <class>. We have fought across continents, worlds even, to reach this point. Now we face our greatest challenge: the destruction of the [[Lich King]] and his [[Scourge]].

Alas, we fight this battle divided. The [[Horde]] and [[Alliance]] are in the throes of war and will lend us no support. We must remain unyielding in our cause! For what choice have we to do otherwise?

Do you join the cause? Lend us your strength, <class>! My commander, Entari, awaits you at his post.

== Completion ==
Where both the Alliance and the Horde failed, the [[Argent Crusade]] succeeded. The success, however, was short lived. Our breach into Icecrown was quickly - and with force - rebuffed.

The Lich King's retaliatory strike was immediate and brutal. Now we are on the defensive.
