This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Krasus}} at the top of [[Wyrmrest Temple]].
* Ask Krasus about the hilt's origins

== Description ==
There's no mistaking it - this hilt comes from a powerful, ancient weapon, but which one? I do not recall seeing or hearing of a sword with these markings, but that doesn't mean that all is lost.

[[Korialstrasz]], better known as Krasus, has long been a friend to the [[quel'dorei]] and the [[Kirin Tor]]. With his vast knowledge and resources, he's certain to know something. Travel to the top of Wyrmrest Temple and seek his counsel, then report to [[Arcanist Tybalin]] inside the [[Silver Enclave]] in [[Dalaran]].

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Progress==
{{stub-section|verify this - copied base on Horde quest}}
The courier Caladis send said to expect you. What were you able to find out?

==Completion==
We can't let that book remain in [[Sunreavers|Sunreaver]] hands. If we hope to identify the sword and use it to our advantage, we have to find a way to capture the book Krasus lent them.

== Notes ==
Speaking with Krasus during the quest will have this gossip:
:<The queen's consort nods in acknowledgment of your presence.>

:{{Gossip|What do you know of ancient swords?}}

The following scene will play out:
:{{text|say|Krasus|You're too late, <name>.  Another visitor from Dalaran came asking after information about the same [[Prismatic Blade|prismatic dragon blades]].}}
:{{text|say|Krasus|From your description, I'm certain the book I loaned our visitor could allow you to easily identify the weapon.}}
:''[[Kalecgos]] walks toward the conversation, standing in front of [[Alexstrasza]] and Krasus.''
:{{text|say|Krasus|I'm afraid you'll have to ask the -- Well, perhaps Kalecgos can help.}}
:{{text|say|Krasus|<Name> may have found the remains of a prismatic blade, Kalecgos.   Will you offer your help to our visitor?}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Are you certain you should be helping these mortals in their quest for the sword?}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|These blades, Krasus...  They were made long ago, when things were... different.}}
:{{text|say|Krasus|You believe our allies will not be able to control the power of the swords?}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Our enemies once turned [[Demon Soul|our strongest weapon]] against us.  What makes you think the prismatic blades will be any different?}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Mortal champions have long used these weapons to combat evil.  I see no reason to keep the swords from them in this battle.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|As you wish, my queen.  I will not stand in their way, but I will keep a close watch.}}
:{{text|say|Krasus|As will we all.}}
:''Kalecgos walks back to his standing position.''
:{{text|say|Krasus|Please, mortal, speak with Arcanist Tybalin in Dalaran.  He may be able to negotiate with the [[Sunreavers]] for access to the book.}}
