==Objectives==
[[Keritose Bloodblade]] at the [[Shadow Vault]] would like you to assassinate 24 Restless Lookouts.
* [[Restless Lookout|Restless Lookouts]] assassinated (24)

==Description==
[[Ghoul]]s are fragile things when it comes down to it, and the lookouts at the [[Saronite]] [[Weeping Quarry|quarry]] down the path to the southwest are no exception. Using one of the [[shade]]s, I have no doubt that you can sneak up and put down their lookouts without making a sound.

Clear out as many lookouts as you can reach in a reasonable amount of time... we'll want their ranks thinned for our assault to come. 

==Progress==
Hard to lookout for what can't be seen.

==Completion==
Without even getting your hands dirty.

==Progression==
