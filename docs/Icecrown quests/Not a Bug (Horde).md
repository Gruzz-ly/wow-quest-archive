==Description==
Alright, <friend/missy>, time to plant a bug.

Relax, it's not a bug exactly, but it'll serve our purposes.

In the northern portion of Aldur'thar the [[Cult of the Damned|cult's]] [[Void Summoner]]s enslave demonic minions. Use this rod to siphon the dark matter from the corpses of these [[Enslaved Minion]]s, and then use the cultists' summoning crystal to bring our little spy into being.

Until it is discovered, the messenger will serve as our eyes and ears, discreetly observing the actions of our enemy.
