==Objectives==
Bring news of [[Crusader Bridenbrad]]'s fate to [[Highlord Tirion Fordring]] at [[Crusaders' Pinnacle]]. 

==Description==
I know why you've come... they've sent you to bring me back, but that cannot happen. I carry the [[plague of undeath]], <class>, and I'll not share my fate with those near me. No, I shall stay here.

My only regret lies in what I may become when death grips me. I do not fear death itself, but I loathe to consider serving the traitor, [[Arthas]].

Leave me... and see to it that no one else comes looking. You would do me a great disservice if you were to expose anyone to the plague that I carry.

==Completion==
Bridenbrad has contracted the plague? I cannot imagine a worse fate for one who has devoted his life to the ways of the [[Light]], nor can I fathom leaving him to die without lifting a finger to help.

No, undeath shall not be his fate. We shall find a way to aid this hero.
