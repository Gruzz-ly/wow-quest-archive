==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]], aboard the [[Skybreaker]], wants you to defeat Alumeth the Ascended at [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]].
* [[Alumeth the Ascended]] Defeated
Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
These fools have actually stumbled upon something that could pose a serious threat to our plans!

The leader of this particular sect, Alumeth, has ritualistically sacrificed himself and now his underlings are channeling power to his soul.

If he's allowed to rest, their efforts will soon transform him into a mighty adversary.

Combine his {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Heart|heart}}, {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Skull|skull}}, {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Scepter|scepter}} and {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Robes|robes}} from around their chamber and use his {{loot|Common|Alumeth's Remains|remains}} on the crystal there.

Hurry, <race>! Destroy him before he becomes any more powerful!
