==Objectives==
[[Baron Sliver]] at the [[Shadow Vault]] wants you to use the [[Sovereign Rod]] on the corpses of Vile, Lady Nightswood, and The Leaper.
* [[Vile]] turned
* [[Lady Nightswood]] turned
* [[The Leaper]] turned

==Description==
Vile, Lady Nightswood, and The Leaper would make excellent weapons in the fight against the [[Lich King]] if they can be broken from his will. That is what the Sovereign Rod is for.

You'll find them on the ledges to the east and west of the vault, as well as on the mid-tier of the vault above us. The rod is to be used upon the corpses of the three.

Fly now. We will have them as our own! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Lady Nightswood's Engagement Ring|Signet of Baron Sliver|Shadow Vault Shawl|Chain of the Sovereign}}

==Progress==
You have NOT turned them  yet. Do not insult my intelligence, <class>!

==Completion==
We will put those three to good use once we finally take the vault.

Speaking of which....

==Notes==
{{Zone Map|zone=Icecrown|notes=
{{Zone Map Note|44.4|27.0||Vile}}
{{Zone Map Note|41.8|24.5||Lady Nightswood}}
{{Zone Map Note|43.6|19.1||The Leaper}}
{{Zone Map Note|44.2|24.7|ActiveQuest|Baron Sliver}}
}}

Vile and Nightswood are stationary on their ledges (Vile to the right, Nightswood to the left), while the Leaper paths pretty much the entire middle level of the Vault.

:Vile says: Vile free? Vile love <name>!
:Lady Nightswood says: You dare? Where is Baron Sliver? I would have words with him!
:The Leaper says: Mrmrmmrmrmrmrm... mrmrmrmr?!
