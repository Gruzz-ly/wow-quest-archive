==Objectives==
Defeat Grimkor the Wicked and return to [[Thassarian]] aboard the [[Skybreaker]].
* [[Grimkor the Wicked]] slain
Suggested Players [5]
* [[Rune of Distortion]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Ironwall Rampart]] overlooks the [[Valley of Fallen Heroes]], west of [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]]. The rampart dominates the fields below on all sides. We will not be able to advance if the rampart cannot be taken, but it is held by Grimkor the Wicked and his [[Cult of the Damned]] disciples.

If you can weaken Grimkor, our forces will know what to expect as we advance. Take this rune of distortion. Unleashing its power near Grimkor's orb at the end of the rampart should be enough to get the necromancer's attention. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|80}}
*27550 [[XP]] or {{cost|16|53}} at level 80
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Knights of the Ebon Blade]]

==Progress==
Have you completed your mission?

==Completion==
So Grimkor has fallen by your hand? Excellent work. With him out of the way, our chances of taking and holding the rampart during the assault are greatly improved.

==Notes==
The Orb is at the end of the rampart at {{coords|45|45|Icecrown}}.

Grimkor is susceptible to all kinds of crowd control and his elite add can be rooted if necessary.
