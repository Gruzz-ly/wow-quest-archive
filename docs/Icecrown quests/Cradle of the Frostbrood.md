== Objectives ==
[[Koltira Deathweaver]] aboard [[Orgrim's Hammer]] wants you to slay 5 [[Wyrm Reanimator]]s, 8 [[Cultist Corrupter]]s and 3 [[Vrykul Necrolord]]s at [[Sindragosa's Fall]].
* [[Wyrm Reanimator]] slain (5)
* [[Cultist Corrupter]] slain (8)
* [[Vrykul Necrolord]] slain (3)

== Description ==
We need to keep our momentum going. Let's not give the [[Scourge]] forces any respite.

Sindragosa's Fall lies east just beyond the [[Valley of Lost Hope]]. The [[Cult of the Damned]] operate there, under close supervision of the [[Lich King]]'s [[Vargul|undead Vrykul]] lackeys.

It is a place of great power, possibly a [[blue dragonflight]] graveyard. The feared [[Frostbrood]] are raised there from the bones of blue dragons.

An attack there would have great impact on the enemy's access to [[Frost wyrm|Frost Wyrm]]s. Are you up to it, <name>? 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Axe of Bloodstained Ice
|Wyrmstalker's Bow
|Reanimator's Hacker
|Corrupter's Shanker
|Necrolord's Sacrificial Dagger}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|40}}

== Completion ==
You've done well, <name>. You might want to rest for a while. You look a little pale.

== Notes ==
Matthias is at the fall and will pick up where he left off in [[Where Dragons Fell]].
