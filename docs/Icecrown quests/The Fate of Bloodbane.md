==Objectives==
[[Vereth the Cunning|Vereth]] on the [[Rise of Suffering]] has dispatched you to kill Orbaz Bloodbane.
* [[Orbaz Bloodbane]] slain
Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
With the riders of the [[Host of Suffering]] dead, now is time to put an end to their true leader - Orbaz Bloodbane.

[[Darion Mograine|Mograine]] caught up with me while you were off and told me that he found where Orbaz is hiding. Under [[Icecrown Citadel]] itself, there is an immense pit - you will find Orbaz just outside it's lip.

Some of the [[Knights of the Ebon Blade|Ebon Blade's]] strongest agents have already been dispatched - gather aid and join the fight. It is time for Bloodbane to die. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Bloodbane Shroud|Bloodbane Cloak|Bloodbane's Fall|Bloodbane's Resolve}}

==Progress==
Are we finally free of that Arthas want-to-be?

==Completion==
Mograine himself arrived to see the deed done then? I imagine there was some ill blood between those two - no surprise that he wanted a piece of the wretch.

You've done exceedingly well, <race>, and you shall be rewarded appropriately. The Ebon Blade thanks you.
