==Objectives==
[[Koltira Deathweaver|Koltira]], aboard ''[[Orgrim's Hammer]]'', wants you to fly down to the [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|gate of desolation]], visiting the south, central, north, and northwest regions of the gate.
* Aldur'thar South Visited
* Aldur'thar Central Visited
* Aldur'thar North Visited
* Aldur'thar Northwest Visited

==Description==
Progress is being made. We have a promising array of tactics that should gain us control of the [[Mord'rethar: The Death Gate|death gate]]. There will doubtlessly be many casualties, but in the end, we should be able to prevail - barring any interference from the [[Alliance]].

Our next focus will be Aldur'thar, the gate of desolation. Fly down and become familiar with it and with the enemies posted there.

When you return, I will have you missions prepared. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|5|80}}
*16550 [[XP]] or {{Cost|g=9|s=93}} at 80

==Progress==
Have you scouted the gate of desolation, <class>?

==Completion==
Well and good, <class>.

Now that you've seen firsthand what we're up against, it's time to get to work...
