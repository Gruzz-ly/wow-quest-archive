==Objectives==
[[Koltira Deathweaver|Koltira]], aboard ''[[Orgrim's Hammer]]'', wants you to collect the 3 pages of Cultists' Research from the [[Cult Researcher]]s at [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]] and use them to create the Cult of the Damned Thesis.
*[[Cult of the Damned Thesis]]
*Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
The [[Cult of the Damned]] are notorious for concocting grandiose plans that in the end, rarely succeed. But something feels different this time....

Perhaps it's the proximity to the [[Lich King]] that has their fervor heightened. Whatever it is, they appear to be more confident that ever. We must know what feeds this bravado and then find a way strip them of it!

I believe the key lies with their researchers. Find out what they're up to and report back to me with the details. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}}
*22050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|13|23}} at max level)

==Progress==
Have you discovered what their researchers are up to, <class>?

==Completion==
This is alarming, indeed....

==Notes==
The cult researchers are found inside the northern building of Aldur'thar.
