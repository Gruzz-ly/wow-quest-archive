==Progression==
He has departed, hasn't he? I felt a small bit of light leave the land.

==Completion==
I am glad that you were able to save him from undeath. With [[A'dal]]'s blessing, he will know no evil in his afterlife.

We shall take heart in his shining example and in your selflessness. Thank you for all that you have done.
