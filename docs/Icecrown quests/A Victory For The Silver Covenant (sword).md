This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Bring the Restored Quel'Delar to {{NPC||Vereesa Windrunner}} at the [[Violet Citadel]] in [[Dalaran]].
*[[Restored Quel'Delar]] (provided)

==Description==
In spite of {{NPC||Blood-Queen Lana'thel||Queen Lana'thel's}} boasting, you have restored [[Quel'Delar]], <name>. Long have we dreamt of reclaiming Quel'Delar.

The [[Silver Covenant]], and indeed all [[quel'dorei]] owe you a debt of gratitude.

Vereesa Windrunner, the leader of the Silver Covenant, asked to see you after you returned from the [[Sunwell]]. Take Quel'Delar with you and go to Dalaran's Violet Citadel where she waits, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox| |Quel'Delar, Might of the Faithful|Quel'Delar, Ferocity of the Scorned|Quel'Delar, Cunning of the Shadows|Quel'Delar, Lens of the Mind}}

==Progress==
Is it true that you have restored Quel'Delar?

==Completion==
This is nothing short of an amazing accomplishment, <name>. The day that [[Thalorien Dawnseeker|Thalorien]] and [[Anasterian Sunstrider|Anasterian]] fell, the same day that Quel'Delar was lost, was one of the darkest of my life. To see Quel'Delar restored... it is beyond words.

Without a doubt, you are meant to be the true bearer of the blade. Quel'Delar's magic is already adapting the blade to your skills and your strengths.

==Gains==
[[The Sword in the Skull]]

==Notes==
On completion:
:{{text|yell|'''Vereesa Windrunner yells:''' This is a great day for all who oppose the Lich King! Brave <name> has taken up the ancient blade, Quel'Delar, in the name of the Silver Covenant!}}
