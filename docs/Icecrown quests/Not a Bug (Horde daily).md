==Objectives==
[[Koltira Deathweaver|Koltira]], aboard ''[[Orgrim's Hammer]]'', wants you to collect 5 [[Dark Matter (quest item)|Dark Matters]] and summon a Dark Messenger at [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]].
*[[Dark Messenger]] summoned
*[[Rod of Siphoning]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Cult of the Damned|cultists]] have discovered the last messenger you summoned, <race>.

While it was quite informative, it's important that we continue to monitor their every move.

Use this rod to siphon the dark matter from the corpses of enslaved minions at Aldur'thar. Then use their summoning crystal to bring another dark messenger into being.

Until it is discovered, the messenger will serve as our eyes and ears, discreetly observing the actions of our enemy. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}}
*22050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|13|23}} at max level)

==Completion==
Well done, friend.

The messenger is up and reporting in as we speak.

==Notes==
The [[warlocks]] and [[voidwalkers]] are in the northeast portion of Aldur'thar, the summoning crystal is towards the center of the north end of the gate at {{coords|53.8|33.6|Icecrown}}.

To collect the Dark Matter, you must select the Enslaved Minion's corpse and use the provided Rod of Siphoning. Two very common things can keep you from collecting the dark matter.

* opening another corpse before collecting the dark matter from the enslaved Minion.
* killing another mob before collecting the dark matter.

That is, to successfully collect the Dark Matter, you have to kill the summoner, then kill the minion, then use the rod. You can open the minion's corpse without losing the ability to successfully use the rod.

While this is not likely to be the behavior Blizzard intended, this may still be "not a bug"...
