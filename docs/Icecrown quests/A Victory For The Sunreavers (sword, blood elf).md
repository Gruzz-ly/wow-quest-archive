==Objectives==
Bring the Restored Quel'Delar to {{NPC||Archmage Aethas Sunreaver}} at the [[Violet Citadel]] in [[Dalaran]].
*[[Restored Quel'Delar]] (provided)

==Description==
At last, [[Quel'Delar]] is restored for the glory of the [[Sunreavers]] and the [[blood elf|sin'dorei]]! All of Silvermoon will proclaim you a hero, as will all of the Horde.

Archmage [[Aethas Sunreaver]], the leader of the Sunreavers, asked to see you after you returned from the Sunwell. Travel to the [[Violet Citadel]] in [[Dalaran]] as soon as you can, <name> and bring Quel'Delar with you. The archmage wishes to congratulate you personally!

|Quel'Delar, Cunning of the Shadows
|Quel'Delar, Lens of the Mind}}

==Progress==
Is it true that you have restored Quel'Delar?

==Completion==
Quel'Delar rises again, as we sin'dorei have risen from the ashes of defeat and betrayal. The heart and the weapon of [[Thalorien Dawnseeker]] are both with you, <name>.

I see the blade has already started adapting itself to your strengths, <name>. Hold your head high and always keep Quel'Delar at your side.

==Gains==
[[The Sword in the Skull]]

==Notes==
On completion:
