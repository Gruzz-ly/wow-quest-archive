Completion of [[Killing Two Scourge With One Skeleton]] results in [[Crusader Olakin Sainrith|Crusader Olakin]] being abducted by a Frostwyrm ([[Ghostwing]]).  Now, it's time to bring him back.

This quest introduces a new [[Phase]] in [[Fleshwerks]].  The area is teeming with Corpulent Horrors and geists, who are in turn being attacked by Crusaders afoot and Ebon Knights on horseback.

==Objectives==
Recover Olakin's Torso, Olakin's Legs, Olakin's Left Arm, and Olakin's Right Arm and bring them to [[Darkrider Arly]] at [[Blackwatch]].
* [[Olakin's Torso]]
* [[Olakin's Legs]]
* [[Olakin's Left Arm]]
* [[Olakin's Right Arm]]

==Description==
With the abduction of [[Crusader Olakin Sainrith|Crusader Olakin]], the [[Argent Crusade]]'s forces will have no commander in the final assault on the [[Fleshwerks]]. While one crusader is the same as any other to me, the argents won't see it that way.

I hate to see us waste time chasing after this, but I have no choice. Our gallant crusader has likely been dismembered by now, and his remains used to construct abominations. Go down into the Fleshwerks, kill the [[Corpulent Horror|corpulent horrors]] fighting our forces, and recover Olakin's body parts.

==Progress==
Have you recovered the, uh, remains of Crusader Olakin?

==Completion==
Well, I suppose it's good that we've "recovered" the crusader, though I doubt his comrades had this in mind. Let's see what we can do to get him back on his feet so we can get this charade over with and complete our mission here.

==Notes==
While engaged on this quest, the [[Fleshwerks]] will be overrun with Crusaders and Ebon Knights attacking everything scourge.  Remember that to get loot credit on mobs, more than 50% of the damage must be done by players, not NPCs.

The parts drop at random off the Corpulent Horrors.  Multiple parts can drop off the same mob, and everyone on the quest can loot the same parts from the same mob.
