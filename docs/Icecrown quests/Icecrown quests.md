# Icecrown quests

* Argent Vanguard ''(breadcrumb from Dalaran)''
* Valley of Echoes
* Crusaders' Pinnacle
* Skybreaker (Alliance) or Orgrim's Hammer (Horde)
** Ymirheim
* The Shadow Vault
** Blackwatch
** Jotunheim
** Death's Rise
** Icecrown Citadel
* After Icecrown Citadel:
** First Legion Forward Camp
** Sindragosa's Fall
