'''Exploiting an Opening''' begins the ''long'' quest chain involving [[Matthias Lehner]]. Before {{NPC||Thassarian}} will offer it, players must complete [[The Shadow Vault (Alliance)|The Shadow Vault]].

== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Captain Kendall]] below [[Icecrown Citadel]]. 

== Description ==
I've got an interesting assignment for you, <name>. If you're up for a challenge, that is.

We've been tipped off about an opening below Icecrown Citadel. Our engineers have studied the layout and have decided it's a structural weakness.

We've sent some men there along with some "borrowed" [[saronite]] bombs. They're under Captain Kendall's command.

With a little help we could deal a huge blow to the forces of the [[Scourge]]. What do you say, <name>? 

== Completion ==
Hail, <name>. [[Thassarian]] mentioned you'd be dropping by. Any friend of Thassarian's is my friend. Well, any living friend of Thassarian, that is... He does keep odd company.

== Notes ==
Kendall is below the citadel  at {{coords|51.7|86.6|Icecrown}} but not down the hole ([[Naz'anak: The Forgotten Depths]]{{coords|54.0|87.8|Icecrown}}).
