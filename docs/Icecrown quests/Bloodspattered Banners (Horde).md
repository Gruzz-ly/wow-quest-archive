== Objectives ==
[[Koltira Deathweaver]], aboard ''[[Orgrim's Hammer]]'', wants you to kill 5 [[Scourge Banner-Bearer]]s, 5 [[Scourge Converter]]s, and 20 [[Converted Hero]]es.
* [[Scourge Banner-Bearer]] slain (5)
* [[Scourge Converter]] slain (5)
* [[Converted Hero]] slain (20)

== Description ==
In the [[Valley of Fallen Heroes]] and [[Icecrown Glacier]], to the west of [[Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate|Aldur'thar]], the [[Scourge]] seeks to use the fallen against us. Scourge lieutenants have woken the valley's dead and imbued them with fearsome strength and fervor. The banners carried by the Scourge leaders in the glacier area are the source of these powers. Kill the banner-bearers, and you will weaken the converted heroes they lead.

It falls to you to rid us of this obstacle, and thin the resistance before the main body can advance.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

== Completion ==
You have removed the Scourge banner-bearers and their minions? Good. Our preparations must continue.

== Notes ==
The converters are just west of the gate, while the converted heroes and banner-bearers are to the southwest, closer to the rampart.
