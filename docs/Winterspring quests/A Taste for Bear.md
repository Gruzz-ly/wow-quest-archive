==Objectives==
Kill 15 Shardtooth bears.
*[[Shardtooth Bear]] slain (15)

==Description==
Have you ever had the luxury of trying bear meat? I never had the chance to try it in [[Gilneas]], but the bears here are simply exquisite.

The shardtooth bears that roam just to the south are well-marbled with fat from the cold here. I've been hunting them myself, and it's quite a lark, but I much prefer eating them!

I recommend you try your hand at the hunt. Stick to the white-pelted Shardtooth bears, and the Captain will go to field to bring back any you kill.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|60}}
*9500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Don't wander too far to the south. The Captain will follow you there later.

==Completion==

Simply splendid! I've been watching the Captain bring bear after bear back to camp and I can't wait to see them thrown on the smoker.

Perhaps I'll have a taste of them raw...
