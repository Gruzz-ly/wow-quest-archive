==Objectives==
Slay 15 Winterspring Owls.
*[[Winterspring Owl]] slain (15)

==Description==
I've been eatin' owls my whole life. Owls is good eatin', and my friend [[Jez Goodgrub|Jez]] agrees. I was the first one that told him to sell owl!

[[Francis Morcott|Mister fancy-pants worgen]] here says bears taste better, but don't pay him no mind. You should go hunt yourself some owl. There's plenty of 'em wandering just south of here. Stick to the gray ones for now, an' buzz me on the little talky-thing Jez gave you when you've racked up a few.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|60}}

==Completion==
{{questportrait|Jeb Guthrie.jpg|Jeb Guthrie|This here fancy talky thing just confuses me.}}
The Captain's been bringin' back bags full of owl and I can't wait to try it! Maybe Mr. Fancypants Francis here will even try some.
