==Objectives==
Find the [[Winterfall Cauldron]] at the northern Winterfall camp.

==Description==
The aggression of the [[Winterfall]] [[furbolg]] has to have its source somewhere. I'd like to get to the bottom it it if I can!

I've seen the furbolg in the camps to the north brewing something in a cauldron. They seemed very protective of it... if whatever they're cooking up is what's causing this, I must examine it myself.

Find that cauldron if it's still there, and bring me back what's inside!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|0}} (or {{coppercost|4050}} at max level)
* 6810 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Timbermaw Hold (faction)|Timbermaw Hold]]

==Completion==
Inside the cauldron bubbles a rotting, repulsive-smelling substance...

==Progression==
