==Objectives==
Kill 10 Coldlurk Creepers and 5 Coldlurk Burrowers.
*[[Coldlurk Creeper]] slain (10)
*[[Coldlurk Burrower]] slain (5)

==Description==
I've still got no clue where all these bugs came from. My best guess is the cataclysm stirred up some underground nests we never knew about.

No use getting distracted with that when they need killing, though!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|60}}

==Progress==
I figured a talented <class> like you would have no problem taking care of a few bugs.

I GUESS I FIGURED WRONG.

==Completion==
Hey, nice work!

If you ever want to come back and kill some more bugs for absolutely no additional reward, please, feel free!
