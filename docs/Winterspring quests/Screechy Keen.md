== Objectives ==
Slay 15 Winterspring Screechers.
*[[Winterspring Screecher]] slain (15)

== Description ==
Them smaller owls are sure tasty, but {{NPC||Jez Goodgrub||Goodgrub}} says there's even bigger ones further south. Screechers, the folk around here call 'em... they make a heck of a noise when you tussle with them!

But he says they're the best owls he's ever tasted or sold, and I believe him. Why don't you go rustle up some of those for us while I keep arguin' with {{NPC||Francis Morcott||Francis}} here?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|60}}

== Completion ==
{{questportrait|Jeb Guthrie.jpg|Jeb Guthrie|This here fancy talky thing just confuses me.}}
You've put us in enough owls for us to sell for a month, friend. Gotta hand it to ya.
