== Objectives ==
Slay 8 Frostmaul Tumblers.
*[[Frostmaul Tumbler]] slain (8)

== Description ==
My mysterious benefactors gave me more than one task. The second task took me farther south, to the [[Frostwhisper Gorge]]. I was surprised to learn that the gorge's bridge had been broken in two, preventing land travel from one side to the other.

In addition, the juvenile Frostmaul tumblers were separated from their stronger adult parents. I thought that I could defeat them in battle.

I was incorrect. I was forced to run away in shame.

Teach these tumblers a lesson, <name>. Fight them, and win. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

==Completion==
Be glad that the adult giants are trapped on the other side of that gorge. They are far hardier than these tumblers you fight.

I feel rejuvenated by your courage, <class>. Perhaps all hope is not lost after all...
