==Objectives==
Defend Gregory as he completes the ritual to destroy the Mannoroc Echoing Orb.
*Defend [[Gregory]] during the ritual

==Description==
Once we begin the ritual, I can't be sure what will happen. This place is crawling with [[demon]]s and if they detect our ritual, we may need to defend ourselves. You and [[Ada Darkhardt|Ada]] will need to focus on that while I channel the spell. Please stay close however, as you yourself are a vital part of this magic.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Ada's Amulet]]
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Be on your guard, <class>.

==Completion==
No... no. This cannot be! We were so close!

I have failed my mission. [[Azgaloth]] is unleashed. We need to regroup and plan our next steps.

==Notes==
The ritual begins as soon as you accept the quest.

:{{text|say|Diathorus the Seeker|Farewell, fools. You've done me a great service today. Azgaloth will make a fantastic general in the invasion to come!}}
