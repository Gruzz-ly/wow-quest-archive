==Objectives==
Collect bear meat, warm fur, and dry wood. Bring the materials back to your campsite to construct a shelter so that you can survive the storm. If you lose your foundation, make a new one with your survival supplies and bring the materials there.
*Collect [[Dry Wood]] (6)
*[[Shardtooth Meat]] (4)
*[[Warm Fur]] (12)
*[[Survival Supplies]] (provided)

==Description==
Just having a tent won't be enough to survive the night in a {{C|Winterspring}} storm. You'll need food, furs, and fire to keep warm, or you'll freeze to death while you wait. Fortunately, nature provides everything you'll need, and you can forage for it all right here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*660 [[XP]]
*{{cost||39}}

==Progress==
You'll need enough food, fur, and fire to survive the night without freezing to death.

==Completion==
With the additional supplies, it should be possible to camp through the storm.

==Notes==
*[[Dry Wood]] can be collected from nearby fallen branches.
*[[Shardtooth Meat]] drops from various Shardtooth bears.
*[[Warm Fur]] drops from [[Elder Shardtooth]]s and [[Chillwind Ravager]]s.
*If the [[Campsite]] has disappeared by the time you return, use the [[Survival Supplies]] to rebuild it.

After turning in the quest, the screen will fade to black. When it fades back in, [[Estelenn]] will be present with the next quest.
