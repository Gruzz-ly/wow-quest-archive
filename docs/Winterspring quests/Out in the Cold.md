==Objectives==
Use your survival supplies to set up a campsite foundation and a crude tent. If you lose your foundation, make a new one with your survival supplies and bring the materials there.
*Set Up a Campsite Foundation
*[[Survival Supplies]] (provided)

==Description==
The old campsite has a few useful bits of wood and a striking flint. To find more of [[Estelenn]]'s tracks or wait for her return, you'll need to collect the materials to make your own camp so that you can survive the oncoming snowstorm.

Though you can avoid the storm by heading out of the hills, you'll have to come back to find the clues that you need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*660 [[XP]]
*{{cost||39}}

==Completion==
A tent will help protect you from the elements, so that you can wait out here a bit longer without freezing to death.

==Notes==
Use the provided [[Survival Supplies]] to set up a [[Campsite]] anywhere nearby.

==Progression==
