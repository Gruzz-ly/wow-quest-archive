==Objectives==
Test the [[Restored Owlkin Totem]].
*Speak to [[Haleh]] to begin the test
*[[Half-Restored Totem]] tested
*[[Owlkin]] fight completed

==Description==
While you were working, I was inspecting the totemic ruins you retrieved. There has always been something odd about the [[Hidden Grove]]. It used to be occupied by a robust population of harmless white [[Rabbit|hares]]. Now there are only maddened [[owlkin]] and strange totems...

I put the pieces together. It is no masterpiece, but hopefully we can glean a stronger magical effect from the whole.

Maybe it will even make us sprout some feathers and fur. You would think as a [[blue dragon]] I would enjoy the cold, but no.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones

==Progress==
I cannot remember the last time I had proper help. Thank you.

==Completion==
Of course, what did I expect?

:{{Text|say|Haleh|Let us test it over there, where there is more space. Why not? I am feeling quite optimistic after today's results so far.}}
:''Haleh and [[Sindragosa]] walk out of the ruins to a nearby open area.''
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|Haleh, I suggest taking greater care with this particular--}}
:{{Text|say|Haleh|Not to fret, Sindragosa! It seems that there remains mostly harmless curses and hexes, weakened from time.}}
:{{Text|say|Haleh|I may join you in [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]] sooner than I thought!}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|...Indeed. Then I shall observe.}}

;Speaking with Haleh
:Are you ready to test the totem?
