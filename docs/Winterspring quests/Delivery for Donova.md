==Objectives==
Deliver Salfa's Basket to [[Donova Snowden]] in [[Winterspring]].
*[[Salfa's Basket]] (provided)

==Description==
Donova Snowden is a kind [[dwarf]] who frequents the nearby hot springs. She claims to be studying their magical properties.

She is a kind person and has good relations with our tribe. As the Winterfall have become more and more aggressive, she has begun researching the cause of their corruption.

I must keep my post here, but I have made a basket of refreshments for her. Please take it to her for me and tell her we await her next visit.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35}}
*3400 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Timbermaw Hold (faction)|Timbermaw Hold]]

==Progress==
Welcome to the hot springs. What've you got there? 

==Completion==
Oh, how nice of those dear [[furbolg]]. I feel so bad for them, cooped up in that hold, afraid of the world.

But can you blame them? These Winterfall furbolg are turning just as vicious as any in Felwood. I'd like to put a stop to it... if only for the sake of my own research, let alone the dear Timbermaw.
