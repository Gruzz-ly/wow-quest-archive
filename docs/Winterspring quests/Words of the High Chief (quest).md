==Objectives==
Take the [[Crudely-Written Log]] to [[Kelek Skykeeper]] at [[Lake Kel'theril]].

==Description==
The [[Winterfall]] are no longer a threat to me, but if you still want to find out what was driving the [[furbolg]] to create and consume this strange firewater, I think you should seek out Kelek Skykeeper.

He's a druid that once worked to help cleanse [[Felwood]] with the Emerald Circle, and has since come here to study the nearby ruins.

You might be able to find him to the east at Lake Kel'theril, where he spends his time recently.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|3500}} (or {{coppercost|2040}} at max level)

{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Strength of the High Chief|Power of the High Chief}}

* 3400 [[XP]]
* 250 reputation with [[Everlook]]
* 125 reputation with [[Ratchet]]
* 125 reputation with [[Gadgetzan]]
* 125 reputation with [[Booty Bay]]

After some time you'll receive [[Words of the High Chief]] in the mail, containing the translation.

==Progress==
What is it you carry, <class>?

==Completion==
Yes, if you let me examine this for a while, I might be able to translate it for you.

<Kelek flips through the pages.>

When I am able to look over this fully, I will send word to you.

Thank you for sharing this with me, <name>. Very little is known about the Winterfall furbolg.
