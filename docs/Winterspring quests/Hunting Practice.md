== Objectives ==
Bring your cub near snow-covered burrows in northern Winterspring 5 times to help it learn how to hunt arctic hares.

* Hunting Practice (5)

== Description ==
Your Winterspring cub paws playfully at your hands. Without any playmates, the cub has few chances to practice its hunting skills.

Perhaps you should take your cub hunting for the small arctic hares that burrow in the snow of northern Winterspring. Bring your cub close to the mounds of snow covering the hare burrows and wait for the cub's instincts to take over. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
{{itembox||Winterspring Cub Whisker}}

== Progress ==
The cub looks at you, as if asking to continue the game.

== Completion ==
Your Winterspring cub looks tired, content, and perhaps a bit more experienced.

== Gains ==
*1500 reputation with [[Wintersaber Trainers]]
*{{cost|16|54|}} (at level 85)

== Notes ==
Simply bring your cub close to one of the mounds. The cub will pounce on the mound, and the player will see the emote
* {{text|emote|Winterspring Cub pounces on the snow-covered hare burrow.}}
