==Objectives==
Slay 8 [[Anguished Highborne|Anguished]] or [[Suffering Highborne]].
*Highborne spirits released (8)

==Description==
Ten thousand years ago...

The [[Highborne]] lived here in prosperity. We considered ourselves above the common ranks of the other [[Night elf|night elves]]. With our every need met by [[magic]] and wealth, we led lives of indulgence and amusement. And greed...

The [[Ghost|spirits]] you see here are overwhelmed with remorse and regret. Their anguish chains them here. If you wish to learn more of [[Ruins of Kel'Theril|Kel'theril]] and [[Temple of Zin-Malor|Zin'malor]]{{sic}}, free them from their agony. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||75}}
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Amulet of the Kaldorei Spirit|Dagger of Suffering|Zin-Malor Ring}}

==Progress==
Death is not always a relief.

==Completion==
The [[:Crystal of Zin-Malor]] was stolen from a far-off temple without remorse. Its ability to control the arcane was too tempting, and when it was toyed with, its shattering cursed us all. Kel'theril suffered until the Sundering destroyed it for good.

The curse of Zin-Malor binds all who seek its power here. I was the first to fall to its temptation. Thousands of years later, our long lost descendants would be next...
