My friends are always coming up with great ideas. I've never felt like I could match them... until today! I just drew up the plans for something great! If you promise not to tell, I'll let you in on the secret... 

I'm going to make a mechanical yeti! Not only are my friends sure to be freaked out when they see it, but when they get over that, I know they'll be impressed!

I need thick yeti fur from the ice thistle yeti. There's plenty of them in the [[Ice Thistle Hills]] to the southeast.
