==Objectives==
Obtain 5 Mana-Addled Brains from [[Altered Beast]]s.
*[[Mana-Addled Brain]] (5)

==Description==
We, the [[blue dragon]]s, have been forced out of our home, [[Mazthoril]]. An impostor by the name of [[Umbranse]] has taken advantage of us in our weakest hour, and now occupies the cave.

Mazthoril is a place of extremely potent magic, and he does not know how to wield it. Even the wildlife suffers.

The beasts nearby have been altered. Please, <race>, I must ask you a favor. Gather their brains, so I can see if I can undo this Umbranse's wild magic.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||80}}
*7890 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Mazthoril belongs to the [[blue dragonflight]]. This is not right.

==Completion==
Let's see what I can do with these...

==Progression==
