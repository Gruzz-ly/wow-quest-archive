==Objectives==
Obtain 6 pieces of Smoked Meat from either [[Winterfall tribe|Winterfall]] furbolg camp in [[Winterspring]] and feed them to your [[Winterspring Cub (quest item)]].
*Feed Wintersaber Cub [[Smoked Meat]] x6

==Description==
Your cub looks at you expectantly. What could it want now?

The little cat licks its lips. It must be meal time again! As the cub's surrogate <father/mother> you're responsible for providing meat until it can hunt on its own.

But what if you let someone else do the hunting? The Winterfall furbolg of Winterspring usually have a lot of smoked meat on hand in both of their camps. Surely, they wouldn't miss a few pieces and your cub would get to try something new.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
{{itembox||Winterspring Cub Whisker}}

==Progress==
Your cub still looks hungry. What's the hold up?

==Completion==
Your cub looks satisfied for now. 

==Progression==
