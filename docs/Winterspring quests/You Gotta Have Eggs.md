== Objectives ==
Obtain 40 Chillwind Eggs.
*[[Chillwind Egg]] (40)

== Description ==
I don't have a very discerning palate, but even I can't stand the taste of those [[chimaera]]s that you'll find around here. Their eggs, however, are a different story.

Chimaera eggs are the richest, most buttery eggs you'll find this side of [[Orgrimmar]]. Way better than boring owl eggs, and not as sulfurous as those weird [[wildkin]] eggs.

I'll take as many of them as you can gather. Head northeast, and look for their nests in the snow. 

== Progress ==
Mmmm....

== Completion ==
Nice. Eggs.

These will go great with a little bear bacon.  Hey [[Francis Morcott|Francis]], got any bear meat left over?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||80}} and [[Chillwind Omelet]]
