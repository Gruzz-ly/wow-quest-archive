==Objectives==
Slay Hell-Hoot.
*[[Hell-Hoot]] slain

==Description==
Local legend tells of a mighty owl that circles the mountaintops like death on wings. They named her Deathwing.

Soon afterwards, they were told that that name was already taken. So they settled on a moniker that evoked a similar sense of horror and dread:

Hell-Hoot.

Hell-Hoot can be found atop the mountain to the southwest of our smoking pit. Silence the infernal nocturnal... so we can eat her!

==Progress==
I want that owl, <name>.

==Completion==
Hell-Hoot is slain, and her meat is just as succulent as you'd expect.

Today, we eat a legend.  Thank you, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|60}} and [[Hell-Hoot Barbecue]]
