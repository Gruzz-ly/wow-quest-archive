==Objectives==
Slay 15 [[Winterfall]] furbolg of any kind near the [[Frostfire Hot Springs]].
*Winterfall Furbolg slain (15)

==Description==
I came to Winterspring to investigate the Frostfire Hot Springs. I've noticed that the water seems to have... strange qualities. I haven't yet been able to discover the source, and to tell you the truth, I've had some difficulty lately, due to the Winterfall furbolg.

They seem to be drawn to the springs, just as I am. They have become extremely protective of the water, and won't let me come near the two larger springs to the north of here.

I'd like to continue my studies, so won't you help me?

==Rewards==

==Progress==
I appreciate your help!

==Completion==
Thanks so much, <name>! Now I can get back to work here.

Did you find anything of interest at the Winterfall camp?

The furbolgs you need to kill drop [[Winterfall Spirit Beads]], which can be turned in to [[Salfa]] for Timbermaw Hold reputation.
