'''Brumeran of the Chillwind''' is the strongest [[chimera]] in [[Winterspring]].

==Objectives==
[[Storm Shadowhoof]] at [[Everlook]] in [[Winterspring]] wants you to kill [[Brumeran]].
*[[Brumeran]] slain

==Description==
Swift, and clever, Brumeran glides silently across the snowy landscape of southern Winterspring. But do not let her graceful appearance convince you that she is harmless. All that cross her pay considerably, and often with their own lives.

Seek out Brumeran of the chillwind among the chimera. Defeat her, then return again to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Brumeran calls out to you, <name>.

==Completion==
Yes. You have returned. I believe now that you are a true hunter by nature. You have faced the most ferocious of creatures and have returned, surpassing my expectations.

You are now ready for my final request.  

==Notes==
*Brumeran has a large patrol area. She starts from near [[Lake Kel'Theril]] and heads southeast to the road near [[Owl Wing Thicket]].
*She attacks with lightning breath and a stackable poison effect. Nature resistance or some sort of poison cleansing is recommended.
*Possible spawnpoint 54,48. Seen spawn at this location and traveled north to 54,46 and then began traveling back down towards the south-southeast.
