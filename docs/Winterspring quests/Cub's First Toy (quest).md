==Objectives==
Obtain a [[Tough Yeti Hide]] from any [[Ice Thistle Yeti]] and 5 [[Wildkin Feather|Wildkin feather]]s. Combine them to make a [[Winterspring Cat Toy]] and use it to play with your [[Winterspring Cub (quest item)]].
*Try out Winterspring Cat Toy

==Description==
The Winterspring cub plays with a small tuft of fur from a large animal, batting the discarded hair about. While your cub looks like it's enjoying the new game, you wonder if it might get more enjoyment from a proper cat toy.

With a little bit of leather from a yeti pelt and some feathers from crazed moonkin, you could make a respectable toy. You'll need a hide from the yeti in the [[Ice Thistle Hills]] southeast of [[Everlook]] and feathers from the moonkin at the [[Hidden Grove]] or [[Owl Wing Thicket]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|16|54}} (at level 85)
*+1500 [[reputation]] with [[Wintersaber Trainers]]
*[[Winterspring Cub Whisker]]

==Progress==
The cub looks at you. What could you be planning?

==Completion==
Your Winterspring cub seems thrilled with its new toy, but there's no telling how well it will survive the cub's enthusiasm.

==Notes==
After collecting the [[Tough Yeti Hide|hide]] and [[Wildkin Feather|feathers]], right-click to combine them into the cat toy. Then right-click the toy to Use it. 

Using the toy produces a [[area of effect#ground targeted|ground targeted area of effect]] targeting circle (similar to [[Blizzard]], [[Rain of Fire]], [[Hurricane]], etc.). Click the circle to have the cub play with the toy.

The [[Hidden Grove]] can be found at the north end of Winterspring, due north of Everlook, and is labeled on the game map. [[Owl Wing Thicket]] is at the south end of Winterspring, directly northeast of [[Frostwhisper Gorge]].
