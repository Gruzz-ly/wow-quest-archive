==Objectives==
Collect 5 Totemic Ruins from the [[Hidden Grove]].
*[[Totemic Ruins]] (5)

==Description==
It is... certainly bizarre to see [[Sindragosa]], real in all but the flesh.

Look, I appreciate that you have both come all this way for me. [[Dragon Isles|The Isles]] sounds delightful, but I have dedicated many years to cleaning up [[Winterspring]]. I am not about to leave a job unfinished. [[Magic]] is abound and unfortunately not all good.

If you would like to help, The Hidden Grove is next on my list. Therein lie ruins of totems that still emanate with some sort of magic. Will you collect pieces of them?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
And that one, I suppose, is harmless enough...

==Completion==
Thank you. Now, to take a closer look at these.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Haleh|It... seems you already know who I am, though we have never met.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|Since my awakening, I have spent much time learning the current state of affairs in regards to [[Blue dragonflight|my flight]].}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|Many paths led to Winterspring. Change has befallen this area several times over, yet you remain its constant.}}
:{{Text|say|Haleh|This was once a home for many [[blue dragon]]s, including myself. I would like to believe it still can be, after my work is finished here.}}

Destroying the [[Owlkin Totem]]s gives the Totemic Ruins and summons [[Lingering Wrath]].
