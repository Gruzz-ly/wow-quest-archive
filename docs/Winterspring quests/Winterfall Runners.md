==Objectives==
Find and defeat the [[Winterfall Runner]] and take the Winterfall Crate from him.
*[[Winterfall Crate]]

==Description==
Very interesting, <name>...

When this toxic substance is mixed with the water from the hot springs, it loses its toxicity, only retaining the ability to temporarily affect those that ingest it. This must be why the Winterfall protect the hot springs so fervently—they need them to purify their firewater.

We need to stop this—cut off contact between the Winterfall and the Deadwood. A group of runners walks the distance between their village and Felwood. Find and defeat them, and steal their shipment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|14500}} (or {{coppercost|5100}} at max level)
*8500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Timbermaw Hold (faction)|Timbermaw Hold]]

==Progress==
We'll see what happens when the Winterfall don't get their firewater!

==Completion==
<Donova examines the contents of the crate.>

I wonder if consuming this substance makes the furbolg more aggressive. They do seem much larger...
