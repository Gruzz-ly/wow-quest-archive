== Objectives ==
Obtain an Owlbeast Dreamcatcher from [[Dun Mandarr]].
*[[Owlbeast Dreamcatcher]]

== Description ==
What a shame. Whatever [[Umbranse]] has done, he has prevented me from undoing his magic.

He is wiser than I had anticipated.

I do have a backup plan, however. I have seen [[owlbeast]]s enter and leave Mazthoril, even after Umbranse took control. Their ancient druidic magic must be capable of disabling Umbranse's. Luckily, I happen to be somewhat of an expert in their methods.

Travel south, to [[Dun Mandarr]]. You will find a chest with a dreamcatcher in it.

That will be your first step. 

== Progress ==
The owlbeasts' magic will be the key to our retaking of Mazthoril. 

== Completion ==
Good. It is just as {{NPC||Jaron Stoneshaper||Jaron}} described it.
