== Objectives ==
Pursue and slay the {{NPC||Shade of the Spiritspeaker}} and obtain any evidence of its master.
*[[Shard of the Spiritspeaker]]

==Description==
You say it spoke of a master? Of one who holds Zin-Malor?

This is grave news. You must act, <class>! I saw the shade fly off to the south. Take the path to the upper ruins, and you may be able to climb the frozen waterfall after it!

And do not let your guard down... it may be waiting for you. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|50}}

==Progress==
Did you find the shade? Was anything left to indicate its origin? 

==Completion==
Let me see... faintly written, among the engraved incantations, is the name of its master!

"[[Umbranse the Spiritspeaker|Umbranse]]..."
