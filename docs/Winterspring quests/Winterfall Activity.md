==Objectives==
Collect 10 [[Winterfall Spirit Beads|Spirit Beads]] from [[Winterfall]] furbolg.

==Description==
The [[Timbermaw]] tend to stay to themselves, <name>. While we do allow safe passage to those we trust, we try to avoid other furbolg tribes if at all possible.

The Winterfall tribe has become increasingly hostile towards us. They seem to be in a state of rage, completely engulfed by their own fear and hatred of anything they do not understand.

The Winterfall carry spirit beads, which have clearly failed to protect them against corruption. Bring me 10 of these beads to show you have thinned their ranks.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Earth Warder's Gloves|Gloves of the Pathfinder|Vest of the Den Watcher|Ursa's Embrace}}

You will also receive:
*{{coppercost|14500}}
*8500 [[XP]]
*1400 [[reputation]] with [[Timbermaw Hold (faction)|Timbermaw Hold]]

==Progress==
We very much appreciate what you have done for the Timbermaw, <name>.  Your continued efforts will surely earn my tribe's trust and respect.

==Completion==
Thank you for what you have done, as saddening as it is.  Accept this as a token of thanks.

I would ask of you to please continue helping us, <name>.  We have very few allies on which to call upon, and without your aid, the threats against my tribe would surely be too much for us to handle alone.
