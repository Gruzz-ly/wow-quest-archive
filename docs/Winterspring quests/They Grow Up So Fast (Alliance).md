==Objectives==
Accumulate 20 Winterspring Cub Whiskers shed by your Winterspring Cub. Bring the whiskers, 20 Runecloth, 20 Rugged Leather, and 80 gold to [[Rivern Frostwind]].
*[[Winterspring Cub Whisker]] (20)
*[[Runecloth]] (20)
*[[Rugged Leather]] (20)
*[[Winterspring Cub (quest item)]] (provided)
*Required money: {{cost|80}}

==Description==
I think this little fellow will be a good match for you.

This cub is going to require a lot of attention to ensure that he grows up strong and healthy. You should check up on your cub at least once each day. Feeding and caring for your Winterspring cub is the best way to build a bond of trust with him.

As your cub grows, he will shed his old whiskers and grow new ones appropriate to his size. Once your cub has shed twenty whiskers, bring him back to me along with some materials for your saddle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
{{itembox||Reins of the Winterspring Frostsaber|Cub's First Toy}}

==Progress==
How fares your young saber?

==Completion==
It looks like you've done an admirable job of raising your cub, <name>. Your saber has grown up to be strong, healthy, and loyal. Both of you are well-matched.

Your Winterspring frostsaber will respond to your call anytime to wish to ride together.

==Notes==
This quest will take at minimum twenty days to complete, as [[Winterspring Cub Whisker]]s are only rewarded from daily quests offered by the Winterspring Cub. So, once daily, head to Winterspring, call the Winterspring Cub, complete its daily quest, then go back to civilization.
