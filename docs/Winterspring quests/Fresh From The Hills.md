==Objectives==
Collect 7 Pieces of Pure Glacier Ice from the cavern in [[Ice Thistle Hills|Icethistle Hills]]{{Sic}}.
*[[Pure Glacier Ice]] (7)

==Description==
Ice this time? Hoo boy, sure. I've got good news and bad news for you.

The good news is there's a bunch of pure solid ice over in the Ice Thistle Hills cavern, straight east from [[Everlook]]. The bad news is there's also a bunch of vicious [[yeti]]s in there.

But if you can handle the yeti, hey, piece of cake! Just walk right up to the bigger chunks and crack 'em open with your weapon. Bring it all back to me and I'll do my thing.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||75}}

==Progress==
Oh, you're back! How were the yetis? 

==Completion==
Not bad! Let's hope they don't ask for lava or something next, right?
