==Objectives==
Find [[Jez Goodgrub]] at [[Goodgrub Smoking Pit]] in [[Winterspring]].

==Description==
Say there, <class>... do you like meat? Even better, do you like money?

I got a second cousin who's making a killing in the frozen meats business. He's set up a smoking pit up north, and he's looking for help hunting all the dangerous beasties that always tend to taste so good.

Carnivores pay well, friend. I'm too heavily invested here in this barrow den - what was I thinking? - so I might as well pass the tip on to a helpful <race> like yourself.

His name's Jez. Head northeast, and look for the smoke!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

==Completion==
Look around you; you're looking at the largest goblin-owned hunting reserve in [[Kalimdor]]! I've got the licenses to shoot and eat everything that walks on the snow from here to Everlook... and lemme tell you, they're good eatin'!
