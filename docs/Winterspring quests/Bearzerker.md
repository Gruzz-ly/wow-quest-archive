Slay Grolnar the Berserk.
*{{NPC||Grolnar the Berserk}} slain

== Description ==
[[High Chief Winterfall|High Chieftain Winterfall's]] absence has done little to quell the rage of the [[Winterfall]]. In his absence, their greatest warrior has rose to a position of terrible power.

[[Grolnar the Berserk]] lurks in the cave at the top of Winterfall Village, gorged on enough corrupt firewater to kill ten lesser [[furbolg]]s.

He has become a bloated and horrible beast! Our warriors have been unable to face him... do you have the strength to defeat him, <class>?

== Completion ==
Your actions prove yourself a mighty warrior to me and all the Timbermaw!

Let us hope the Winterfall will be defeated for good now...
