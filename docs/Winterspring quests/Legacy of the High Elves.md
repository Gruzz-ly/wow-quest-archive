== Objectives ==
Obtain the Memory of Zin-Malor from the spirit of {{NPC||Archmage Maenius}}.
*[[Memory of Zin-Malor]]

==Description==
One hundred years ago...

I and a small group of other [[High elf|High Elves]] traveled here from our homeland, [[Quel'Thalas|Quel'thalas]]. We sought the ancient mysteries of [[Ruins of Kel'Theril|Kel'thoril]]{{sic}}... to find why it was destroyed.

We found fragments in the ice, shards of the crystal. The Archmage we accompanied did not take long to fall under their sway. In our foolishness, we noticed too late.

His spirit wanders in the southeast, among those he drove to madness, still clutching the memory of the precious shard... 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||75}}

==Progress==
Maenius was a powerful [[mage]] and an honorable elf.  His spirit did not deserve such an ignoble fate.

==Completion==
We were shocked before we died. Shocked that one among our noble and austere kind could descend into vicious obsession so quickly. We died as naive fools, the victims of our own blithe assumptions.

The living would know that these events would play out yet again... both here, and among the entire elven race with the [[Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas|fall]] of [[Quel'Thalas (kingdom)|Quel'thalas]].
