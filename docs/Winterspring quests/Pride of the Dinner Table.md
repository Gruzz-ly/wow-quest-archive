Slay 15 [[Frostsaber Huntress]]es or [[Frostsaber Pride Watcher]]s.
*Frostsaber Pride Watcher slain  (15)

==Description==
Alright kid, time to head out further into the field!

This haul's nice and good, but further to the west you'll find much bigger kitties. The pride watchers and huntresses have a lot more muscle on them, and it makes AMAZING burger patties. They sell like crazy!

Gimme a ping when you've cleared house and we'll see about you going after the main course.

Stopping by to chat?

And the next course...
