== Objectives ==
Kill Ursius.
*{{NPC||Ursius}} slain

== Description ==
I've heard it said that you are what you eat. I don't know if I believe that, but if it's true... I'd prefer to eat the strongest creature that I can find.

Ursius is the largest bear in [[Winterspring]]. He eats first when his pack of shardtooth brings down a [[chimaera]] or an [[owlbear]]. He claims the most comfortable cave in the shardtooth-held lands. And he has... considerable influence with the shardtooth females.

He is my kind of bear.

I want to eat him.

His cave is near the maulers. Good luck!

==Progress==
Good hunting, <name>.

== Completion ==
Ursius is... not delicious.  He tastes like a combination of pinecones and curdled milk, only... oilier.

Are you sure this is Ursius?  The big bear?  In the cave?

This is horrible.  It honestly tastes like his meat has been steeped in urine.

I don't feel like I'm getting any stronger.

Ugh.  It's really bad.  Do you want to try some?

== Rewards ==
