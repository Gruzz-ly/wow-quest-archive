Obtain Icewhomp's Pristine Horns.
*[[Icewhomp's Pristine Horns]]

==Description==
I can't make a yeti without horns!

I've been looking for what seems like forever for the perfect set of horns... and no horn I find is good enough! But just the other day I saw the biggest yeti in Winterspring.

I named him [[Icewhomp]]. His horns are the ones I've been looking for! He lurks all the way in the back of the cave along the eastern ridge of [[Ice Thistle Hills]].

Bring me his horns... but be sure to check on [[Echo Three]] along the way!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|55}}

==Progress==
Are they perfect? They better be perfect!

==Completion==
I can't wait to show my friends! Now, just wait a moment while I attach these...

Perfect!

==Trivia==
*In a reference to [[wikipedia:Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]], the [[Adventurer]] will awake suspended upside-down in the same cave that the Adventurer were just hunting yetis in, referencing the scene at the beginning of the movie where Luke is captured by the wampa on Hoth and suspended in a cave.
