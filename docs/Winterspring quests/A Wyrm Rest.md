I fear Haleh has not been getting adequate rest.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Sindragosa
:{{Gossip|What is the plan?}}
::There is one place of great warmth in Winterspring.

::Follow the path west and you will find some delightful steaming hot springs.

::Meet us there.

::{{Gossip|I understand.}}

:''Sindragosa sits down next to Haleh.''
:{{Text|say|Haleh|It is neverending. Irresponsible [[magic]] remains abundant in every nook and cranny. And I have only been in [[Winterspring]].}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|You are doing an [[Dragon Aspects|Aspect]]'s breadth of work, all on your own. I admire your tenacity.}}
:{{Text|say|Haleh|I do not know why I keep getting my hopes up. This place will never be fully cleansed.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|You said... how many days has it been since the last bad artifact? Forty?}}
:{{Text|say|Haleh|Forty-one! I will not rest until it has been one hundred. I am not even halfway there.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|My dear child. Breathe. Let us walk away from this for a moment. I know the perfect place.}}

Head to the hot springs to the east.

:{{Text|say|Haleh|Why are we here? I need to get back to work!}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|You mean to say in all your years here, you have never been to the hot springs? My research indicated they were very well known.}}
:{{Text|say|Haleh|Lounging about in hot water? That is a luxury I cannot afford.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|Not a luxury. A necessity.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|<Name>! Go on, step into the water. Show Haleh just how nice it is.}}

Enter the pool. The adventurer receives the Relaxed buff.

:''Haleh joins as well in her dragon form.''
:{{Text|say|Haleh|Fine. Just for a moment, then.}}
:{{Text|say|Haleh|Ahhhh. This is... nice.}}
