==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Nymn}} at [[Everlook]] in [[Winterspring]].

==Description==
I have heard tales of [[Umbranse the Spiritspeaker|Umbranse]], though I have not ever met him in person. Rumor has it that he's been collecting [[magic]]al artifacts, though for what purpose, I couldn't say.

Best pass this information on to a trusted ally. Nymn, the [[high elf]], can be found within Everlook, the large [[goblin]] town to the northeast. Tell him all that we learned today.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||8}}

==Completion==
Umbranse... I see. I will carry this information onto my people.

You will be contacted if you are needed again.
