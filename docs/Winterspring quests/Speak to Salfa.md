==Objectives==
Travel through [[Timbermaw Hold]] and exit into [[Winterspring]]. Speak with [[Salfa]], who stands guard outside the entrance to Timbermaw Hold.

==Description==
The threat of corruption comes not only from the Deadwood furbolgs to the south, but also from the east and the Winterfall furbolgs of Winterspring. If you wish to further aid us, speak with Salfa on the other side of the Hold, by the Winterspring entrance. Follow the path to the left to reach it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35}}
*3400 [[XP]]
*+100 reputation with [[Timbermaw Hold (faction)|Timbermaw Hold]]

==Completion==
Greetings, <class> - I stand guard here as both a speaker for the Timbermaw here in Winterspring and as a defender of the tribe.

Our [[Winterfall]] brethren here in this frigid land have fallen under the same corruptive sway as the furbolg of Felwood.  If you've come here offering the Timbermaw furbolgs aid, then we are ready to accept such an offer.

==Notes==
When you reach the bridge inside Timbermaw Hold, go across it and keep going east to exit in Winterspring. Taking the lower path north will bring you to [[Moonglade]] instead.

==Progression==
{{Deadwood of the North}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added, replacing [[Speak to Salfa (Classic)]].}}
