== Objectives ==
Slay 12 Owlbeasts in Owl Wing Thicket.
*[[Crazed Owlbeast]] slain (12)

== Description ==
What happened to me, you ask? Listen, <class>, and listen well, for my tale is one of tragedy...

I was sent here to [[Owl Wing Thicket]] to find some relics. I only made it this far before I was overwhelmed by a flurry of wings and talons.

How they roared and pecked, <class>!

I now lay here, a broken [[orc]], with nothing but vengeance on my mind. Please, <class>, if you have any sense of honor, you will go into Owl Wing Thicket and help me regain mine.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
My honor is restored.

Partially.

My tale continues, <class>, for I have left portions of my honor elsewhere in this forest.
