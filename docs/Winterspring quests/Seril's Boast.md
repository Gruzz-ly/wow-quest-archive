==Objectives==
Speak with [[Deez Rocksnitch]]. 

==Description==
Brutes and amateurs.

It doesn't matter how sharp or heavy your weapon is if all it's good for is hacking like an [[ogre]]. I could go on and on about finesse and speed and balance and control... but it's easier to one-up these fools.

Tell Deez we've got one more order for him. I need a block of ice.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

==Completion==
Oh, it's you again! I'm so surprised!
