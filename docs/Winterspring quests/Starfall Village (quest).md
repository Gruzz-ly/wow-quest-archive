==Objectives==
Speak with [[Wynd Nightchaser]] at [[Starfall Village]].

==Description==
You've been pretty busy around here. If you're still eager to do good deeds, or just get paid, I've got something you might be interested in.

Starfall Village is just northwest of [[Everlook]]. The [[night elf|night elves]] there recently suffered a pretty nasty bug infestation, and they're asking for any help they can get.

A few [[goblin]]s from here already went there to start exterminating, but I'm sure there's room for more. Talk to Wynd Nightchaser, he'll fill you in.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

==Completion==
Welcome to Starfall, <class>. We have opened our doors to all travelers in our time of need.
