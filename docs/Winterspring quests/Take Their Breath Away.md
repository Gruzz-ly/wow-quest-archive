==Objectives==
Retrieve 10 Nivifacient Glands from [[blue dragonspawn]] at [[Mazthoril]] just south of [[Everlook]].
*[[Nivifacient Gland]] (10)

==Description==
I've been working with [[Evie Whirlbrew]] to secure crucial supplies, but she is driving a hard bargain and refuses to budge. She insists that she'll only trade Nivifacient Glands from blue dragonspawn for them. This gland is what allows blue dragonkin to use their icy breath, and it has a variety of special alchemical properties. 

There's a population of very hostile [[blue dragon]]s at Mazthoril to the south and I could really use help obtaining some of these glands to use to satisfy this gouger.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +200 reputation with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Progress==
I’d be lying if I said that I was entirely comfortable with extracting organs from living, breathing beings, even though they are very, very hostile. In any case though, we need these supplies and a [[druid]] has to do what a druid has to do.

==Completion==
I think that the uh, less gory details I know about what went into extracting these, the better off I’ll be. The blues aren’t exactly forgiving.

Anyway, I really appreciate this! I’m sure I can get those supplies from Evie now. Unless, of course, she decides to change the deal on me again!
