==Objectives==
Report to [[Haleh]] at [[Beryl Egress]] in [[Winterspring]].

==Description==
We have isolated [[Umbranse]]'s position here in Winterspring. It is as I suspected.

Umbranse is at [[Mazthoril]], the cavern that once belonged to the [[blue dragonflight]], in the southwest. My mother, Haleh, will greet you there. She is stationed outside of the cave in a small camp with a few other survivors.

Look for her campfire.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||8}}
*785 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You are <name>, yes?

Good, you will serve well. I require the aid of a <class> such as yourself.
