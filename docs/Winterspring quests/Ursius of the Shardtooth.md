'''[[Ursius|Ursius of the Shardtooth]]''' {{co|63|20|Winterspring}} is the largest [[bear]] in [[Winterspring]].

==Objectives==
[[Storm Shadowhoof]] at [[Everlook]] in [[Winterspring]] wants you to kill him.
*[[Ursius]] slain

==Description==
In the snowy mountains of Winterspring, to the northwest, a skilled [[hunter]] stalks his prey... I speak of Ursius of the Shardtooth [[bear]]s, an agile and clever beast.

I send you now against him. He roams the sloping hills to the northwest of Everlook. Find and hunt him, before he discovers your intent.

All that have gone up against Ursius have quickly found themselves to be the prey, and he, the hunter. Stay on your guard.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*8450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Go now, <class>. Seek out Ursius.

==Completion==
This was no easy task, yet you have excelled. But do not be too quick to think you have impressed me, <name>.

==Notes==
*Ursius patrols the mountains north of [[Everlook]]. He ranges over a wide area so it might be advisable to ask over General Chat if any has seen him. He can be kited back to Everlook so the guards can help kill him.
*He doesn't hit very hard and doesn't have any other special attacks.
*Up to [[patch 2.3.0]] this was a group quest.
