==Objectives==
Use Tanrir's Overcharged Totem to overload 4 Winterfall Earth Totems.
*Winterfall Earth Totem overloaded (4)
*[[Tanrir's Overcharged Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
Despite their corruption and madness, the [[Winterfall]] barely cling to their shamanic powers. It disturbs me to see the power of the elements used by them to harm my tribe and other innocents.

We will turn their totems against them! Take my own totem with you into [[Winterfall Village]]. Use its powers on the Winterfall's totems from afar, and the fury of the earth will be unleashed on all nearby!

Needless to say... keep a safe distance!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||75}}
*7,340 [[XP]]
*+1400 [[reputation]] with [[Timbermaw Hold (faction)|Timbermaw Hold]]

==Progress==
Have the totems been destroyed?

==Completion==
May the Winterfall never threaten the [[Timbermaw]] again. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
The totems are located in front of various lodgings in [[Winterfall Village]] with [[Winterfall Shaman]] gathered around them. They can be overcharged from a medium distance away without [[aggro]]ing the shaman, and after a few seconds will explode, killing the shaman (although kills are not required for the quest). [[Tap]]ping the shaman before the explosion gives [[Timbermaw Hold (faction)|Timbermaw Hold]] reputation when they're killed, but no loot. The explosion will not harm the player, even if close by.
