==Objectives==
Slay [[High Chief Winterfall]].
*High Chief Winterfall slain

==Description==
The Winterfall furbolg are not a normally aggressive tribe, and this change in their behavior leads me to think that they must be under orders from their chief. We most likely can't undo the damage that has already been done, but if their leader is slain, they may not get any worse.

Head east again, past where you found that cauldron. High Chief Winterfall is here, at the easternmost part of [[Timbermaw Post]].

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|14500}} (or {{coppercost|6000}} at max level)

{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Wand of Sudden Changes|Furbolg Fur Bracers|Princess Zoe's Old Hunting Gloves|Ambush Armguards}}

You will also receive:
*10200 [[XP]]
*+2000 [[reputation]] with [[Timbermaw Hold (faction)|Timbermaw Hold]]

==Progress==
Maybe you will find out more in [[Winterfall Village]], <name>.

==Completion==
Thank you so much, <name>. I hope to get back to my studies without worry that I will be ambushed. Please accept this as a reward.

==Progression==
{{Winterfall tribe quest chain}}

==Notes==
Make sure to pick up the {{loot|normal|Crudely-Written Log}} from the High Chief to start the next quest chain.
