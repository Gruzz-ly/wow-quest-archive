==Objectives==
Kill 15 Shardtooth Maulers.
*[[Shardtooth Mauler]] slain (15)

==Description==
Many find the meat of the Shardtooth bears to be too gamy for their taste. I disagree, though I'm not one to judge the tastes of others.

The Shardtooth Maulers, however - their brown-furred cousins, to the south - have much more tender flesh, particularly in their paws. And I've heard that the snout is also considered a delicacy.

Continue your hunt, <name>. Let's see if you can bag those maulers for ol' Francis.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|60}}

==Progress==
I'm so hungry I could eat a bear. Bare.

==Completion==
{{questportrait|Francis Morcott.jpg|Francis Morcott|That's some good bear right there.}}
<Francis smacks his lips.>

You've got to try some of this, <name>.  These maulers are perfectly tenderized... possibly because of the pummeling you delivered.
