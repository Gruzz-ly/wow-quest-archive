==Objectives==
Bring the Crudely-Written Log to [[Donova Snowden]] in [[Winterspring]].
*[[Crudely-Written Log]] (provided)

==Description==
The log you found on the high chief looks extensive, but after looking through a couple of the pages, you find that you cannot read the text. The markings are so crude and poorly-formed that you are not sure if anyone would be able to read them.

But perhaps Donova will be able to tell you what it says...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|3500}} (or {{coppercost|2040}} at max level)
*3400 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Timbermaw Hold (faction)|Timbermaw Hold]]

==Progress==
Now, what's this, <name>?

==Completion==
I wonder what all of this means... I can't make anything out...

==Progression==
{{Lake Kel'Theril quest chain}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
