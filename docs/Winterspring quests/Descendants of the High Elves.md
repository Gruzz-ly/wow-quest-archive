==Objectives==
Speak with the [[Sin'dorei Spirit]]. 

==Description==
Long after my death, my people would suffer an even greater mistake. The [[High elf|High Elves]] relied on the [[Sunwell]] and its glory. Never imagining a world without it, we would never make preparations to deal with such a fate.

Later, when the Sunwell fell to the forces of the [[undead]], what was left of my descendants would be lost and helpless... and the path they would take in response would change them forever.

The [[Sin'dorei]], still striving for redemption, would return here as well...

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||19}}

==Completion==
We were not naive, as our forefathers were. We were suspicious and cunning and ready for betrayal at every turn.

Yet our pride and greed drove us to ruin once more. How many more will be lost to Kel'theril?
