'''Strange Life Forces''' is a simple quest that explains the phenomenon of [[E'ko]]. It has a chance of being auto-accepted upon the death of any creature in [[Winterspring]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Witch Doctor Mau'ari]] at the [[Snowden Chalet]] in Winterspring.

==Description==
When this creature died, some sort of energy was released from its body. The energy was passed on to you, and now you feel somewhat stronger.

According to Winterspring locals, Witch Doctor Mau'ari at the Snowden Chalet is an expert in the wildlife of the area. She might know something about this mysterious energy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|55}}
*2,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What's dis? You got de smell of de E'ko on ya! Let Mau'ari tell ya a little bit about de E'ko and what it do.

You're lucky, <race>. De E'ko searched you out. A [[troll]] like me's gotta go find de E'ko herself.

All de creatures of Winterspring have E'ko. De [[furbolg]], de [[Chimaera|chillwind]], de [[Bear|shardtooth]]... even de [[Ice Thistle]] [[yeti]]! You kill dese creatures, and sometimes, a bit of E'ko comes out. Different creatures... different E'ko.

Go on now. Go find de other E'ko!
