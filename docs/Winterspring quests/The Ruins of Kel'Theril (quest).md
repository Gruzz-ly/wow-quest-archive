==Objectives==
Speak with the [[Kaldorei Spirit]] at [[Lake Kel'theril]] in [[Winterspring]].

==Description==
At this lake, the [[:Crystal of Zin-Malor]] was stolen by the [[Highborne]]. The crystal was a powerful artifact that bent [[arcane]] [[magic]] in wild and unpredictable ways... but it could only be held by the worthy, and brought doom upon all others.

The [[Ghost|spirits]] that wander here span generations, each shackled here by [[Temple of Zin-Malor|Zin-Malor]]. Some will speak and tell their fates.

Should you wish to learn the fate of Zin-Malor, seek the spirit at the center of the lake...

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|4000}} (+{{coppercost|2100}} at max level)

==Completion==
Pity me, stranger, and all the Highborne, for it was here our folly began... our folly that cursed our children, and our children's children, to this day.
