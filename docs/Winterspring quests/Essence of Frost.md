==Objectives==
Investigate [[Frostwhisper Gorge]] for a mysterious frost power.
*Collect Spell Notes
*Translate the scroll
*Find source of Frost Essence
*Solve frost puzzle

==Description==
Back a while ago, I heard of some strange goings on down in Frostwhisper Gorge. It seems like those [[ice giant]]s might've found some old power. I'd go investigate myself, but I'm too busy here. Bring me back anything interesting, okay? If you live, that is.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*6600 [[XP]]
*{{cost||70}}

==Progress==
You're not dead yet? Interesting.

==Completion==
What's this? There was actually something down there?! I'm surprised those ice giants didn't turn you into an icicle, <name>. Good job.

==Notes==
Obtain [[Scroll: SEENECS FO ROFTS]] from giants in [[Frostwhisper Gorge]], and use a [[Comprehension Charm]] to turn it into [[Scroll: Essence of Frost]].

Destroy the [[Magical Stone (Winterspring)|Magical Stone]] at [[Frostwhisper Gorge]] in {{C|Winterspring}} with fire spells to spawn an [[Outcast Cryomancer]], who drops the [[Depleted Essence of Frost]]. Combine it with the scroll to get the [[Imbued Essence of Frost]] to complete the quest.

==Progression==
{{Staff of Order}}
