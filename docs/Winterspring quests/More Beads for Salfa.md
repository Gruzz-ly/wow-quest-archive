==Progress==
You've certainly earned my trust, <name>, but you may need to continue to earn the trust of my untrusting tribe.  There is something you can do to earn that trust.

The [[Winterfall]] are known to carry spirit beads to ward against foul spirits.  These beads have clearly failed in their purpose, as the Winterfall themselves are the agents of corruption.  Bring to me these spirit beads from fallen Winterfall furbolgs; for every set of five you bring me, you will earn recognition amongst the [[Timbermaw]].
*[[Winterfall Spirit Beads]] (5)

==Completion==
Once again, you prove your honor to us!  I will make sure that your deeds are known amongst my kind.

Remember to bring any of the Winterfall's beads you find to me.  For each set you continue to bring to me, I will speak on your behalf to the tribe. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||40}}
* 3650 [[XP]]
* +2000 [[reputation]] with {{F|Timbermaw Hold}}
