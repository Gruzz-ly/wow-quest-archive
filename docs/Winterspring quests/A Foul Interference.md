==Objectives==
Stop the corruption of Mazthoril.
*Investigate [[Mazthoril]]
*[[Fel Interloper]] slain (5)

==Description==
While you were gone, I heard there's something real nasty going on over in Mazthoril. It seems like your kind of thing, so go see what you can do to solve it. Those blue dragons know a lot about the arcane, maybe they'll give you something in return for it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*6600 [[XP]]
*{{cost||70}}
*[[Incomplete Staff of Order]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
You have helped me greatly, <name>. Though I fear it pales compared to the heroics you have performed for us, I want you to have this. This staff is incomplete, but perhaps may be restored.

==Notes==
Loot [[Scroll: SERELS PATALIS GNEMIND]] from [[Manathirst Imp]]s and use [[Comprehension Charm]]s to turn them into [[Scroll of Lesser Spatial Mending]]. Use them on the [[Growing Fel Rift]]s within Mazthoril to spawn the [[Fel Interloper]]s.

==Progression==
{{Staff of Order}}
