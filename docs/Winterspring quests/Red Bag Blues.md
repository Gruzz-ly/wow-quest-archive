==Objectives==
Locate the Red Bag that [[Numi]] in [[Everlook]] lost in a [[zeppelin]] mishap over {{C|Burning Steppes}}
*Numi's [[Red Bag]]

==Description==
What you want is safely hidden, and I can only hope the same can be said for what I'm looking for. I had a red bag containing some valuable exotics that I use for electro-optics. But, I lost it in a zeppelin accident over Burning Steppes! The bag could still be there, but with [[orc]]s, [[ogre]]s, and [[poacher]]s, I've had to put my work on hold. If you can locate it and bring it back to me, I'll let you have [[Sebastian Jurgens|Jurgens]]' old book.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||90}}
*6,600 [[XP]]
*[[Red Bag]]

==Completion==
You find the Red Bag laying on the table in a simple, carefree way.

==Progression==
{{Rift Away}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 1.15.3|note=Added.}}
