==Objectives==
Slay 7 [[Wretched Spirit]]s or [[Wretched Spectre]]s at [[Lake Kel'theril]].
*Wretched Spirit slain (7)

==Description==
One year ago...

The legend of the [[:Crystal of Zin-Malor]] reached [[Silvermoon City|Silvermoon]], and I led a group of the finest [[warrior]]s and [[scholar]]s available to this land. We brought ample [[mana crystal]]s, so none of us would be tempted to taste the crystal itself.

The crystal did not need our hunger to ruin us. Once in our possession, it warped all but me into [[wretched]] beasts.

The wretched souls still wander, seeking more lives to chain to this lake. Will you give them mercy... or flee to die on safer ground someday?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||75}} and [[Orb of Kel'theril]]
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Dagger of Wretched Spectres|Mace of the Sin'dorei Spirit|Blade of Wretched Spirits|Staff of Haunted Memory}}

==Completion==
The living [[Farstriders|farstrider]] who sent you here could not bear to see our fate. He ran... a wise decision.

If one now holds the Crystal of Zin-Malor again, it will spell the doom of all around them. It should never have been reassembled.
