Gather 6 pieces of [[Shardtooth Meat]] from any of the Shardtooth bears in [[Winterspring]] and feed them to your [[Winterspring Cub (quest item)]].
*Feed Shardtooth Meat to Cub x6

==Description==
Your Winterspring cub looks at you and licks its lips. The little cat must be hungry and it's up to you to find a suitable meal for your charge.
