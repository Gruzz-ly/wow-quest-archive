This quest is part of the {{questchain|Boasting Weaponsmiths}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Deez Rocksnitch]].

==Description==
Pah!  Crude and clumsy is all I see!

You need more than just strength.  My axes are just as strong as Lilith's Maces, but so sharp, I can cut through a tree in one chop!

You heard me, one chop!  I'll prove it, too, here in front of everyone.  Go ask Deez if he can get a tree in here!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40}}
*3,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
They want a tree now?  Let's see what I got.
