==Objectives==
Slay Umbranse the Spiritspeaker.
* [[Umbranse the Spiritspeaker]] slain
* [[Bluescale Sigil]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Umbranse the Spiritspeaker|Umbranse]] lurks in the back of Mazthoril. His time has come.

Unfortunately, I am unable to join you on this quest. While I'd love to get my hands on that snake, Mazthoril's magic would rip me apart in its current state. No, I need you to finish this for me.

When the deed is done, use this charm. It will return you safely to the [[Beryl Egress|egress]].

==Completion==
You have our thanks, <name>.
