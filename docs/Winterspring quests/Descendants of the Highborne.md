==Objectives==
Speak with the [[Quel'dorei Spirit]].

==Description==
Not long after my death, the greed of my people would lead to their exile. A continent away, they would become Quel'dorei, the [[High elf|High Elves]]. In [[Quel'Thalas|Quel'thalas]] they would bathe in the power of their [[Sunwell]], and forget their legacy of desire and greed.

These distant descendants returned here, drawn by the hand of fate, doomed to repeat history. Hear their tale now, as I have...

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||19}}

==Completion==
We were proud and noble. Our faith in the [[light]] protected us, and with the Sunwell, we wanted for nothing.

Because of that blindness, we came here to repeat the tragedy of history, as our entire race would in time.
