This quest is part of the {{questchain|Boasting Weaponsmiths}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Collect 6 Prime Rubble Chunks from [[Frostshard Rumbler]]s.
* [[Prime Rubble Chunk]] (6)

==Description==
If you want to get a boulder in there, you can use my own patented Boulder-in-a-Box!  Normally I'd just sell you one up front, but I'm fresh out of materials.

Earth elementals have been popping up on the peak directly south of town.  They're a good source of rubble.  If you bring me a back a good amount, I'll pay you for the restock, and I'll throw in a Boulder-in-a-Box absolutely free!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||75}}
*9,150 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Everlook]]

==Progress==
You got that rubble?

==Completion==
Looks like a good amount!  Here's your pay, as promised...
