== Objectives ==
Report to [[Windcaller Proudhorn]] at [[Cenarion Hold]] in [[Silithus]].

==Description==
Let's see... oh, here's a good one! Silithus!

So, apparently the [[Cenarion Circle]] needs assistance with an insect infestation of some sort.

<Vizzie shivers.>

Ugh! No thanks, not for me. I'm perfectly happy freezing to death here in Everlook if the alternative is bugs.

Hmm... it says here that visitors should speak with Windcaller Proudhorn, and the easiest way to get there is via the path up Un'Goro Crater's northwestern cliffs.

You interested?
==Completion==
Welcome to Cenarion Hold.

<Windcaller Proudhorn brushes some snow off of your shoulder.>

You've certainly come from far off.

== Reward ==
You will receive: {{cost||40|}}

==Gains==
*4,050 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Cenarion Circle]]
