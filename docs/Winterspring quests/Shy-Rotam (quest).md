==Objectives==
Slay [[Shy-Rotam]].

==Description==
Time for the big kill, pal!  Shy-Rotam lurks in the north, the largest [[frostsaber]] of them all.

You should feel honored.  There's no fiercer game for a hunter to match their skills against... and if you saw the cash I'm being offered by gourmands that want a piece of this fellow, your eyes would pop out!

Once you've got him, head on back to camp.  Don't want to totally exhaust our frostsaber population in one day...

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|16000}}

{{itembox|You will be able to choose between the following rewards:|Shy Breastplate|Shy Shrug|Breastplate of the Fifth Hunter|Frostsaber Helm|Corpse Dragger's Shield}}

* 11400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Shy-Rotam's in the north.  No food 'til you finish!

==Completion==
Amazing, kid.  You're a cut above!  I went through about five different contracted hunters trying to get that cat.

Well, we found two of them after the Captain got the corpse, but let's not dwell on that...
