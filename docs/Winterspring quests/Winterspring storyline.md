# Winterspring storyline

[[File:WorldMap-Winterspring.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

[[Winterspring]] is a level 50-55 landlocked [[contested]] zone in northeastern [[Kalimdor]]. Players arrive from [[Felwood]] at the exit from [[Timbermaw Hold]] and progress east towards [[Everlook]], then fork north and south until the story culminates with the defeat of [[Umbranse the Spiritspeaker]].

The progression of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Winterspring Quests]].

==Snowden Chalet==
{{Winterfall tribe quest chain}}

[[High Chief Winterfall]] will drop the {{loot|common|Crudely-Written Log}}, which starts the next quest chain with [[The Final Piece]].

In addition, [[Strange Life Forces]] has a small chance to be auto-started upon the death of any Winterspring creature. It is not required for any other quest.

==Lake Kel'Theril==
{{Lake Kel'Theril quest chain}}

==Everlook==

At this point, the questing experience forks. [[Deez Rocksnitch]] offers [[Starfall Village (quest)]]. [[Nymn]] offers [[The Pursuit of Umbranse]].

Breadcrumbs to very far-away zones are available from [[Innkeeper Vizzie]] in Everlook:
* [[The Sands of Silithus]]
* [[Blasted Lands: The Other Side of the World]]
