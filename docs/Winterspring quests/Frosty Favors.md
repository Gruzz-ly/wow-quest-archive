==Objectives==
Explain the book situation to [[Sebastian Jurgens|Doctor Jurgens]]' colleague, [[Numi]], in {{C|Winterspring}}.

==Description==
I'm the chief [[engineer]], founder and head technician of the [[Deepsea Exploration and Liquefaction Technologies Alliance]]. I've nearly finished my latest experiment, and I need your help! I am working on a special device to geolocate resource-rich dimensions. To complete my construction, I need something back: a book of arcane formulas that I lent to an old colleague of mine, Numi, who continues her work in Winterspring. Retrieve the book for me and I'll reward you handsomely!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Sebastian needs it? He's a real piece of work. You're wasting your time asking for the book. I'm not giving it up or telling you where it is quite yet. But maybe we can make a deal.
