==Objectives==
Retrieve 5 Starfall Relics from the [[Ban'Thallow Barrow Den]].
*[[Starfall Relic]] (5)

==Description==
Luckily, when the infestation occurred, no [[druid]]s were slumbering in the western [[barrow den]]. It is still a sacred site to us, however, and its depths hold blessed relics kept there undisturbed for ages.

While I am somewhat trusting of the [[goblin]] exterminators, I am also... familiar with the habits of their race. Please retrieve any relics you can find in the barrow den and bring them back to me so they are not damaged. They are within urns, nestled in the small alcoves throughout the den.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|60}}

==Progress==
I hope you found them intact...

==Completion==
They may not look like much to you, but these relics hold great value to the people of Starfall.  You are kind, <name>.
