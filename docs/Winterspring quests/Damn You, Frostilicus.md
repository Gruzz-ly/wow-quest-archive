Slay Frostilicus.
*[[Frostilicus]] slain

== Description ==
The [[Frostmaul Giant|Frostmaul giants]] wouldn't have been a problem if it weren't for that damned Frostilicus. When the ground shook and the bridge broke, he and his fellow [[water elemental]]s seeped out of the earth and took over the bottom of [[Frostwhisper Gorge]], forcing the giants out.

Damn you, Frostilicus!

You would do me a great honor if you would send him back into the ground, <class>. You will find him to the south, at the bottom of the gorge.

==Progress==

==Completion==
If I survive my wounds, I will always remember your name, <class>.

Whenever the wind whistles through the trees, I will always hear your name.

Thank you.
