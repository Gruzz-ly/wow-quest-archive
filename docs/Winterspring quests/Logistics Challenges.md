==Objectives==
Gather 15 Crates of Moonglade Supplies from the [[Winterfall tribe|Winterfall Furbolg]] camps and villages in [[Winterspring]]
*[[Crate of Moonglade Supplies]] (15)

==Description==
I have a longstanding arrangement with [[Azzleby]] to transport supplies through the mountain passes on his beasts of burden. Recently, his caravans have been getting raided by Winterfall Furbolgs and they've stolen our stuff! 

Search the Winterfall encampments here in Winterspring for our missing supplies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Progress==
I suspect the Winterfall furbolgs think that it's good fun to load up on firewater and ransack our caravans for sport. 

That's just rude, if you ask me.

==Completion==
Thank you so much <name>. It's a huge relief to have these supplies back!
