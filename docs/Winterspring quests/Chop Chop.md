This quest is part of the {{questchain|Boasting Weaponsmiths}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Collect 10 pieces of Fresh-Cut Frostwood from [[Frostleaf Treant]]s.
*[[Fresh-Cut Frostwood]] (10)

==Description==
I deal in small timber plenty, but full trees?  That's a novelty item.  Kinda like those boulders.

Maybe you can do me another favor.  Just west of town there's a grove of trees overlooking [[Lake Kel'Theril]].  I don't know if it's the spooks there, or all that elf magic junk strewn around the place, but we've been getting treants and lashers wandering around there recently.

They're making it a real pain to chop wood over there, so why don't you chop some of them?  Bring the wood from the treants back here.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

You will receive:
*{{cost||75}}
*9,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Show me the lumber.

==Completion==
Not a bad haul.  Maybe we should look into growin' those treants instead...

==Notes==
As the quest text states, both treants and lashers drop the wood needed.
