*[[Unfired Plate Gauntlets]]
*[[Enchanted Thorium Bar]] (6)
*[[Essence of Fire]] (2)
*[[Star Ruby]] (4)

==Description==
By [[Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan|Thaurissan]]'s beard!

Where did you find them?

More importantly, are you willing to part with them? Naturally, I would pay you for such a noble gesture.

I'll tell you what, <name>. If you give me those unfired gauntlets, I will teach you how to make a set all your own. All you need to do is collect the parts for me so that I may narrow down the exact recipe.

Do we have a deal??

Here's the list of what I need, I'll front the non-enchanted thorium myself since you're supplying the gauntlets.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*[[Plans: Fiery Plate Gauntlets of the Hidden Technique]]
*[[Fiery Plate Gauntlets of the Hidden Technique]]

You will also receive:
*8,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Time is money, <name> and I don't have much of either.

==Completion==
As promised, <name>, here's your recipe! I'm also going to throw in a little something extra for all of your hard work and dedication. What am I going to do with these anyway???

==Progression==
# [[Hot Fiery Death]]
