==Objectives==
Find [[Echo Three]]. 

==Description==
A lot of [[goblin]]s have been going missing out there in [[Ice Thistle Hills]]. I was almost one of them!

I had the idea to set up a sensor to tell us when the [[yeti]] were getting close to [[Everlook]]. Of course, it's not working either. There's yeti all over the hills and I haven't heard a peep from it.

Would you mind checking on it for me? It might still be fixable. Echo Three's set up to the southeast on the edge of Ice Thistle Hills. Don't ask what happened to Echo One and Two. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

==Completion==
Part of this machine is still moving, but on closer inspection it's been severely manhandled. The metal is dented and cracked, and there's huge footprints in the snow all around it.

In fact, it sounds like something's approaching right now...
