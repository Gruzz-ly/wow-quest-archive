==Objectives==
Bring the Box of Bugkill Fumigators to [[Remma Curtainfire]] inside the [[Ban'Thallow Barrow Den]].
*[[Box of Bugkill Fumigators]] (provided)

==Description==
My fellow siblings are already further down in the den trying to deal with these bugs, and they're starting to get overwhelmed. I say it's time to gas the place.

Take these fumigators. Don't go setting them off yourself; it takes a highly trained professional, and proper timing. Just find my sisters and pass them out.

Remma should be positioned closest to the entrance. Head down the corridor and keep to your right once you go down the ramp.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

==Completion==
We're bringing out the bug spray, eh? I guess it can't be helped.
