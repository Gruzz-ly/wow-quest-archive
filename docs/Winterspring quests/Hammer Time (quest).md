This quest starts the {{questchain|Boasting Weaponsmiths}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Deez Rocksnitch]].

==Description==
The three of us have been arguing for weeks over whose weapons are superior.

I won't let anyone tell me my maces are second best.  Kilram's axes and Seril's swords could never match the pure strength of my craft.

I'm tired of arguing.  It's time to show those two I'm right with a demonstration.  If you would, dear, head outside and tell Deez Rocksnitch that I need the biggest boulder he can find!

==Rewards==
You will receive {{cost||40}}.

==Completion==
[[Lilith the Lithe|Lilith]] wants a boulder mvoed inside the observatory, eh?  That's my business: consolidated materials.  I usually don't get individual buyers, but hey, I won't ask questions.
