==Objectives==
Report back to [[Donova Snowden]] with your findings.

==Description==
The greenish substance inside the cauldron is putrid and viscous.  No matter what it is, it doesn't seem to be good.

It would be best to report back to Donova with your findings, along with a sample of the liquid in the cauldron.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|5500}} (or {{coppercost|3000}} at max level)
*5100 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Timbermaw Hold (faction)|Timbermaw Hold]]

==Progress==
I hope you found something, <name>. The Winterfall are becoming increasingly aggressive!

==Completion==
Disturbing news indeed. This stuff's much more like what you'd see in Felwood than in Winterspring...

==Progression==
{{Winterfall tribe quest chain}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
