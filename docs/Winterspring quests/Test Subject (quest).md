==Objectives==
Test the artifacts Bottled Spirit, Icy Book, and Left Boot.
*[[Bottled Spirits]] tested
*[[Icy Book]] tested
*[[Left Boot]] tested

==Description==
Today is day forty-one without finding a harmful artifact. I am further delighted to report that while you were away, a handful more proved harmless. Perhaps my hunt in [[Winterspring]] is almost concluded!

Come to think of it... you have some [[magic]]al ability, don't you? Or enough bravery to help me test some more artifacts?

Do not be nervous. None of them will permanently hurt you. Artifacts with that kind of dangerous power were taken care of in my first year here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do take your time, <name>... there are only hundreds more to go.

==Completion==
It seems three out of three were of little magical impact. This is truly great news.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Sindragosa]]|May I assist you, Haleh?}}
:{{Text|say|Haleh|Oh, no, thank you. I have a specific way of doing things. You don't need to trouble yourself.}}

Examine each object next to Haleh.

;Bottled Spirits
:{{Text|say|Haleh|Those souls are beyond my help now, but at least they are free.}}

;Icy Book
:{{Text|say|Haleh|A rather unoriginal and amateur curse. Do not worry, you'll defrost shortly.}}
:''The adventurer is Frozen for 5 seconds.''

;Left Boot
:{{Text|say|Haleh|...Hm. I suspect we would need the right boot to complete the set. Oh well.}}

==Progression==
