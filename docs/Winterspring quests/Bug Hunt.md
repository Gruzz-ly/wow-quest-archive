Travel to the Cenarion Hold in {{C|Silithus}}, on [[Kalimdor]], and speak to the [[druid]]s there about the evolving [[silithid]]s. Aid them as requested while practicing your marksmanship skills.
*Report to [[Commander Mar'alith]] in [[Cenarion Hold]]

==Description==
I followed your tracks and I'm glad to see you're alive! It seems that your survival skills are as good as I suspected. I apologize for keeping you waiting.

I found more signs of our quarry. [[Van Amburgh]] is somewhere in the southwest of Kalimdor. I'm going to head that way and keep looking for tracks. In the meantime, you may want to brush up on your shooting.

Head to Silithus. You can aid the druids at the Cenarion Hold while brushing up on your trick shots.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*660 [[XP]]
*{{cost||39}}

==Completion==
Welcome to Cenarion Hold. You look like a capable [[hunter]], and honestly, we can always use some extra help.

==Progression==
