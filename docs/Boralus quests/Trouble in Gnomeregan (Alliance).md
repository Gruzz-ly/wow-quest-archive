'''Trouble in Gnomeregan''' is a [[breadcrumb quest]] that leads into the [[Gnomeregan (pet battle)|Gnomeregan pet battle scenario]].

==Objectives==
Find [[Micro Zoox]] outside of [[Gnomeregan]] in [[Dun Morogh]]. 

==Description==
Some strange spikes of electric usage have been happening in Gnomeregan recently. We need you to investigate what is going in there as soon as possible.

We've received contact from one of the chief [[engineer]]s in charge of keeping things in Gnomeregan under control, and he has offered to assist us in getting inside to see what's going on. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I don't know how this is possible! What is going on in there?! I don't have time to answer your questions or send you off on trivial tasks, there's work to be done!

Oh, you want to go in Gnomeregan and find out what's going on? Why didn't you say so? 

== Notes ==
*This quest's finish marker ({{questfinish}}) will show in the wrong location unless the player is already near [[Micro Zoox]]. Zoox stands at the [[instance portal]] to the [[Gnomeregan (instance)|Gnomeregan dungeon]]; to reach him, take the elevator down from [[New Tinkertown]] into the non-instanced portion of Gnomeregan, proceed through the [[Loading Room]], then take the first corridor to the west.
*Though this quest is account-wide, characters below level 120 cannot complete it.

==Progression==
#'''Trouble in Gnomeregan'''
#[[Gnomeregan's New Guardians]]
#[[Pet Battle Challenge: Gnomeregan (quest)]] (repeatable weekly)

==Patch changes==
