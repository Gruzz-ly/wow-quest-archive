==Objectives==
Discuss the plan with Alliance leadership.
* Listen to [[Halford Wyrmbane|Halford's]] report {{co|69.3|27.0|Boralus}}

==Description==
Good to see you again, <name>.

[[Mathias Shaw|Mathias]] and I are discussing what to do with new intel that his [[SI:7]] agents procured for us.

The intercepted letter contains orders from [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Warchief Sylvanas]] for an operation the [[Horde]] is undertaking at sea.

This could be a rare opportunity, or a distraction. The letter is purposefully light on details, and it's unclear if we should make this a top priority or focus on our other missions.

Do you have a moment to talk through this with Mathias and me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,930 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We cannot afford a distraction... or a missed opportunity.

==Completion==
It's decided, then. The assassination of [[Blood Prince Dreven]] at sea will be unexpected, demoralizing, and beneficial to the long-term success of our larger campaign.

<Halford Wyrmbane smiles.>

Everything I'm looking for in a strategy.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|What could the Horde be looking for in old shipwrecks...?}}
:{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|We're not sure, but I can send some agents to investigate. This may be low priority.}}
:{{text|emote|[[Shandris Feathermoon]] swoops down onto the deck atop [[Jai'alator|her hippogryph.]]}}
: ''Shandris dismounts and walks up to the table as she speaks.''
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Actually, I believe this is a top priority. Thank you, Mathias.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|In my hunt, I learned that Blood Prince Dreven is traveling via boat with a [[Thomas Zelling|traitorous tidesage]].}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|If Dreven is onboard that boat, he'll be cornered. Nowhere to escape to... if we can strike before they make landfall.}}
: ''[[Falstad Wildhammer]] speaks up from the side of the ship.''
:{{text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|Yer ship's too slow tae get there in time. But speed's no problem for the [[Wildhammer clan|Wildhammer]].}}
:{{text|emote|Falstad Wildhammer whistles and [[Wildhammer Gryphon Rider (Boralus)|gryphon riders]] descend onto the deck.}}
: ''Two Wildhammer Gryphon Riders land beside [[Swiftwing]].''
:{{text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|We can get ye and a small squad there in no time.}}
:{{text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|Who's comin'?}}
