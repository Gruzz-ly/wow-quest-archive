==Objectives==
Gather 2 Frost-Laced Ammunition for [[Norber Togglesprocket]] in [[Boralus Harbor]].
* [[Frost-Laced Ammunition]] (2)

==Description==
Hey there!

Transmission's come down from up top--we need more ammunition! Something with a bit more kick. Something really unexpected!

From what I've heard there's a special frost-based ammunition crafted only by the most experienced engineers. If you were to bring me a few I'm sure our munitions officers would be ecstatic!

Maybe they'd even let me keep one to examine!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]
*500x [[Azerite (resource)]]

==Progress==
I've heard there's a special frost-based ammunition crafted only by the most experienced engineers. If you were to bring me a few of these I'm sure our munitions officers would be ecstatic!

==Completion==
Wow! These are magnificent! The craftsmanship alone is... 

Apologies, I get carried away sometimes.

Take care!
