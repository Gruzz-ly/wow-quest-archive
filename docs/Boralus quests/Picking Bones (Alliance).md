==Objectives==
Collect 18 Unwaning Bones.
*[[Unwaning Bones]] (18)

==Description==
When I was sailing in, I heard some of the sailors talking about the [[Horde]] presence here in [[Tiragarde Sound]].

Apparently they're scrounging around the remains of a massive creature that has washed ashore.

Whatever it was, if the Horde wants it, we need to make sure they don't get it.

Find the Horde, keep them from taking anything, and see if there are any bones from the creature we can use for our drums.

Show them no mercy, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you dealt with our mutual problem?

==Completion==
These bones look good.

I'm thrilled to hear that the Horde bought nothing with their lives.

==Notes==
Travel from [[Boralus]] to [[Driftwood Shore]] and kill any [[Horde Extractor]]s and [[Bilgewater Bruiser]]s you come across. You can also sometimes find a [[Box of Harvested Bones]], which will contain several bones.
