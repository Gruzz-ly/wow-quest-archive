==Objectives==
Retrieve [[Myra Cabot|Myra's]] Favorite Mining Pick.
* [[Myra's Favorite Pick]]

==Description==
Hey, you're not busy, right? I could use your help.

Ya see, I was out mining in [[Stormsong Valley]], when this huge, [[Ettin|two-headed monstrosity]] started chasing after me!

I ran away, but I was back in [[Boralus]] when I realized I dropped my favorite mining pick!

I know this may sound stupid, but if you could get it back for me I'd be grateful.

You don't need to do something crazy, like fight them. Instead, sneak by them and grab it.

I'll show you a trick to mining [[Monelite Ore|monelite]] seams for your troubles.

==Progress==
Did you get my mining pick back?

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Mining techniques|Mining Technique: Monelite Seam (Rank 2)]]

==Completion==
You're a life saver! Well, a livelihood saver!

As for that trick I had mentioned: Don't bother using a pick to separate the rock from the ore when pulling it from a monelite seam.

If the ore is big enough, once you remove it from the earth, you can peel the metal back and remove the rocks by hand.
