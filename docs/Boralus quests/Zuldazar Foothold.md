Listen to [[Halford Wyrmbane|Commander Wyrmbane's]] battle plan, then speak with [[Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth]] to travel to [[Talanji's Rebuke]] in [[Zuldazar]].
* Listen to Halford Wyrmbane's battle plan
* Speak with Jes-Tereth to travel to Zuldazar

==Description==
[[Anduin Wrynn|King Wrynn]] passed along orders to dispatch our finest to establish a foothold in [[Zandalar]]. That means you.

Fortunately, we have a few choices as to where we can set up camp.

Stick around. I'll go over the battle plan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Backups from [[Kul Tiras]]? Perfect. I was just about to finish another execution.

==Notes==
Speak with Wyrmbane:
:The 7th Legion represents the best that Azeroth has to offer.
:For the Alliance!
:{{Gossip|What's your plan, High Commander?}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Gather around, everyone. Here's the plan.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|We already have boots on the ground in not one, but TWO locations in Zuldazar.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|<Name>!}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Rendezvous with [[Brigadier Thom]], one of our 7th Legion officers.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|His crew ran into some trouble at sea, but they've managed to eke out a bit of a camp on the eastern shore.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Kelsey!}}
:{{text|say|[[Kelsey Steelspark]]|Yes sir!}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|You'll be meeting with [[Anvil-Thane Thurgaden]], on Zuldazar's southeastern coast.}}
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Ooh! [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark iron dwarves]]! I love dark iron dwarves! They have MACHINES.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Evaluate these encampments and report back with your findings.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|You have your orders. Dismissed!}}
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Machines.... <sigh>}}
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Sometimes I wish I WAS a machine...}}
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Let's get a move on, <name>! Talk to the ship's captain so we can ship out!}}

Head to the stern of the ship and speak with Jes-Tereth:
:This ship is yours to command, <name>. I have the crew prepared for any eventuality.
:{{gossip|quest=|Set sail for Zuldazar.}}

On the other side of the loading screen, players find themselves on the beach at [[Talanji's Rebuke]]. Head inland to the [[Castaway Encampment]] and find [[Brigadier Thom]] with a [[Captured Zandalari Troll]]:
:{{text|say|Brigadier Thom|This one will speak. At least he still has his tongue, unlike those stinking forsaken.}}
