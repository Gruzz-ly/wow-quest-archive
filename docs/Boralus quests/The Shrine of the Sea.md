==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Shrine of the Sea]] in [[Tiragarde Sound]].

==Description==
This next shrine is right here, in [[Tiragarde Sound]].

According to the journal, the [[earthen]] mentions creating bluish hued jewels. I wonder if that's anything like the [[:kyanite]] we have here.

Go and see if the shrine still stands. Hopefully it's still in a usable state.

I'll continue to study the journal for more information.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<As you peer at the shrine in front of you, you can't help but revel at the construction of it.

Seamlessly constructed with azure jewels placed just so in a radial pattern, collapsing towards a single point.

A single, empty point.>

==Progression==
