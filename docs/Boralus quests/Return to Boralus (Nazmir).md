*Speak to [[Desha Stormwallow]] {{co|62.1|40.1|Nazmir}}

==Description==
I think that's enough excitement for today, <lad/lass>!

Why don't ya get back ta Wyrmbane and tell the man we've got this place all under control.

I'll make sure the [[blood troll]]s don't get any more of our folk! Ha!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* [[Glowing Azerite Crystal]] (250x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The lands of [[Nazmir]] are cruel to all who enter, but [[Fort Victory]] shall stand firm in the face of danger.

Well done, <name>.

==Notes==
This concludes the "Nazmir Foothold" chapter of [[Ready for War]]. Wyrmbane will start [[The Ongoing Campaign (Alliance)]] to start another foothold, the [[Island Expedition (Alliance)]] intro, or [[Uniting Kul Tiras]].
