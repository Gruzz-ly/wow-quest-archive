==Objectives==
Gather 2 Seasoned Loins for Senedras in Boralus Harbor.
* [[Meaty Haunch]] (2)

==Description==
A nice, hearty meat provides the nourishment our allies deserve before shipping off to battle, not to mention it also makes quite a stew, something our troops seem to rather enjoy when the winds are at their best and the chill of night lingers in the air.

If you bring me some freshly seasoned loins I would be more than happy to deliver it to our supply officers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]
*500x [[Azerite (resource)]]

==Progress==
Fresh meat goes a long way. If we're to endure the battle, we've got to be prepared.

==Completion==
This will last for quite some time.

Thank you, <name>.
