==Objectives==
Speak with a [[7th Legion]] [[Mage]] in the [[Sanctum of the Sages]].
* Speak with [[7th Legion Magus]]

==Description==
Sounds like you'll be working with us for awhile.

[[Cyrus Crestfall|Cyrus]] will charter a naval transport between here and [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]], but I expect you'll want something a bit faster for day to day use.

Head back upstairs and take a left when you get outside. You'll find an old study where the [[Tidesages]] used to conduct their magic rituals.

Surely your [[Alliance]] mages have already sensed its power.

Inform them they may open their portals there. The harbor guards will keep the room secure.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|70|}}
* 8,250 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
The Tidesages abandoned that place months ago when they pulled back to their monasteries. We still don't know why.

==Completion==
All set?

Good timing. I have your briefing ready.

==Notes==
Pick up a [[Ferry Pass (quest)]] from Cyrus before heading out. Then go upstairs, take a left, enter the building on the same level, and speak with the [[7th Legion Magus]]:
:This place is steeped in magic. Can you feel it?

:What kind of rituals were they doing here, I wonder?

:{{gossip|The local authority has given us permission to open portals here.}}
:''The three mages open portals to [[Stormwind City]], [[Ironforge]], and the [[Exodar]].''

Mages should also speak with [[Yvia Wavebound]] to learn Teleport: Boralus and Portal: Boralus after reaching level 111.

Return to the [[Harbormaster's Office]], and Taelia will finish compiling her report:
:{{text|say|Taelia|Sir! The situation report is ready!}}
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|Excellent. Hero, Taelia will get you up to speed.}}

==Trivia==
This quest replaced [[Any Port in a Storm]] sometime during testing.
