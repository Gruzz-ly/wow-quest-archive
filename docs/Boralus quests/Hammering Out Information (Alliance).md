==Objectives==
Press [[Grix "Ironfists" Barlow|Grix Barlow]] for more information about where to find a [[Khaz'gorian Anvil|Khaz'gorian Smithing Anvil]].

==Description==
I guess you noticed it requires a special [[anvil]] to make it. And I suppose you want to know where to find a Khaz'gorian Smithing Anvil?

Well, I don't know where you can find one, not to mention I never said you'd be able to actually craft the dang thing.

Now if you wouldn't mind, I have more of these recipes to sell.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Alright, alright, fine! I'll tell you what I know.
