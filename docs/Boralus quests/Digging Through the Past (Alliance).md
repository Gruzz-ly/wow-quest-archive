==Objectives==
Ask [[Jane Hudson]] for her book of Primordial Races: Runes and Writings. Ask [[Tal'ana]] for his Scrolls of the Stonefather. And ask [[Chronicler Toopa|Toopa]] for the The Dungard Codex.
* [[Primordial Races: Runes and Writings]]
* [[Scrolls of the Stonefather]]
* [[The Dungard Codex]]
*Have Zooey translate the Ancient Journal
* [[Ancient Journal Transcription]]

==Description==
Let's see, Jane Hudson probably still has her book on ancient runes and carvings. And I believe Tal'ana has a few scrolls he picked up from [[Ulduar]].

OH! And Toopa found what appeared to be some type of codex the last time he ventured out. I remember seeing the runes on it and they bear a striking resemblance to the ones in this book.

If you could convince them to uh... lend us those items for a bit, I believe I just might be able to create a translation for you. I won't even charge you for it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|5|85|}}
* 4,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How goes the translation?

==Completion==
Was she able to translate it?

<You hand the book over to [[Samuel D. Colton III|Samuel]] and he begins to read it.>

This is incredible. This earthen was able to create jewels with light at special shrines he built. I mean, he mentions building several of them all over the world but...

<Samuel pulls out a few maps and begins scanning them.>

==Notes==
;Jane Hudson
{{gossip|I'm looking for a book you have on runes and carvings. Could I borrow it?}}
:{{text|say|Oh yes, I believe it's here somewhere...}}
:{{text|say|Here it is!}}
:{{text|say|And here you go. Please be careful with it, it's very old.}}

;Tal'ana
{{gossip|I'm looking for some scrolls you may have?}}
:I do! But, and I mean no disrespect, I speak in coin if you catch my drift?
:For the right price, they're all yours.

;Chronicler Toopa
{{gossip|I was told you came across an ancient earthen codex in your recent travels. Could I please borrow it?}}
:Why yes, I did. And quite the read it is.
:However, I came across other books as well. One you may be more interested in as it contains a tale of heartbreak and adventure!
:The protagonist is this man, "Marcus" and it follows his tale as he woos women, and travels the world!
:It's quite a naughty read.
{{gossip|That does sound interesting, however I'd really just like to borrow the codex, please.}}<br/>
{{gossip|That does sound exciting! Tell me more.}}
:Well it starts off with this Marcus fellow having been captured by pirates. He manages to persuade them to let him out after some time, though.
:Along the way, the boat is attacked by none other than a kraken!
:After a lot of fighting and some language not for the faint of heart, the ship is brought down and Marcus falls into the briny deep!
{{gossip|Very interesting so far, but about that codex...?}}<br/>
{{gossip|Oh, and then what happens?}}
:Later he wakes up on the shores of a rather large island. His wounds were wrapped in seaweed and not too far off he could hear the most beautiful voice humming a song.
:When he looked up to see who it was, well, this would never happen in real life but it was a naga!
{{gossip|Very interesting so far, but about that codex...?}}<br/>
{{gossip|That's crazy! A naga?!}}
:Very much so! And then the naga came over and asked how he was feeling. And do you know what he said to her?
:<The tortollan pulls out the book and thumbs through the pages. He clears his throat and begins to recite from the book.>
:"For a moment I thought I was rescued, but staring into those eyes of yours I'm apparently still lost at sea." And then she flirts back with him!
:A naga and a human, conversing and cajoling each other. This is the reason why fiction is so fun to read, wouldn't you agree?
{{gossip|While I'd love to hear more, I really would like to get that codex and be on my way.}}
:Young shells, always in such a hurry. Very well, here's the codex.
:If you ever want to hear the rest of the story about Marcus, you know where to find me.

;Returning to Zooey Inksprocket
:{{text|say|You got them all?! Excellent work, <name>. Now to translate this journal.}}
:{{text|say|OH! So THAT'S what that rune is. Interesting...}}
:{{text|say|Yes? Yes! That's it! Now where are my empty books at...? Ah, here's one.}}
:{{text|say|And here you are, <name>. The translation of your journal. Quite the page-turner if you ask me.}}
