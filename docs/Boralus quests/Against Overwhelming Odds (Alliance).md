'''Against Overwhelming Odds''' is offered to the [[Alliance]] if the [[Horde]] is just overwhelming in odds in [[War Mode]]. This quest is meant to get more Alliance players to turn on War Mode.

==Objectives==
Slay 25 Level 120+ Horde anywhere within [[Kul Tiras]], [[Zandalar]], [[Nazjatar]], [[Uldum]], or [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* Slay Horde Players

==Description==
We've received numerous reports of the Horde overwhelming our forces within both [[Kul Tiras]] and Zandalar. 

Brute forcing the Alliance with sheer numbers is an age-old tactic of the Horde, but we can't allow them to get the upper hand.

Venture forth throughout and thin their numbers the best you can. I recommend bringing reinforcements.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Sentinel Equipment Cache]]
* [[Humming Azerite Heart]] (2000x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Reporting back?

==Completion==
Great work, <class>.
