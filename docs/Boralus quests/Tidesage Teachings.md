==Objectives==
Collect 5 Tomes of Tidesage Research in [[Stormsong Monastery]].
* [[Tome of Tidesage Research]] (5)

==Description==
These people are not [[tidesages]] anymore. They do not deserve to bear our title, our prestige, or our knowledge.

So many of our teachings lay scattered around this monastery, potentially lost to those of us that remain.

We must reclaim these writings. Better in my hands than theirs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
I will not stand for my people's research to be used for evil.

==Completion==
It's a relief to know that this research is free from those who would abuse it.

==Notes==
...

==Progression==
{{The Strike on Boralus}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
