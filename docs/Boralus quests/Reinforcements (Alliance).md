==Objectives==
Speak with [[Mathias Shaw]] to issue a recruitment order.

==Description==
The resources you gather can be used to recruit new troops for the war effort.

Return to me periodically to issue new recruitment orders for your missions.

If you have available resources, you should use them now to issue your first recruitment order.

The war effort rages on even as we speak. We have need of fresh recruits.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you issued the recruitment order?

==Completion==
Excellent. Your new recruits will be available for missions once they have finished their training.

==Notes==
Speak with Shaw:
:We have little time to waste. What is required?

:{{gossip icon|workorder|I require reinforcements.}}

The recruiting interface appears:
:Looking for reinforcements? Place the order and I'll arrange the transport for additional Troops from Stormwind.
*Reagents: 25x [[War Resources]]

Up to four recruits can be in process at any one time. Each recruit requires 30 minutes to train, so come back later to pick them up, but Shaw will complete the quest now.
