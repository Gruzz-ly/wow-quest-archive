==Objectives==
Find [[Patu]] in [[Vol'dun]].

==Description==
Hey <name>, you look like you're ready to handle hostile territory.

Far away in the desert of Vol'dun, on the continent of [[Zandalar]], there grows a plant called [[Akunda's Bite|akunda's bite]]. You couldn't pay me enough to go there myself, and there's almost no mention of them in any of the books I've read, but all is not lost.

I know of an [[Patu|herbalist]] who lives there in the desert and studies that plant. Find him, and I'm sure he'll be able to teach you a thing or two. Oh, and do be warned...

He is a bit... eccentric.

==Completion==
You seek knowledge on akunda's bite? Marvelous plant, but surprisingly delicate given the harsh environment. Only the strongest will survive...

Hmmm... Yes, you'll do nicely.  If you assist me in my work, I would be willing to provide you with some insights.
