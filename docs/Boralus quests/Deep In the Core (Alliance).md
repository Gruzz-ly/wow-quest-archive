Look, you're gonna have to travel to some place called Deepholm and find an [[earthen]] down there.

The guy who sold the [[recipe]] to me said he got it from an earthen called...Ormhun! Ormhun something.

I don't know too much about that place, but maybe you can ask the locals or something where he lives.

Now if you don't mind, I have more recipes to sell.

Ha! Good luck with that! I haven't seen one of those in, oooh... centuries.

Lucky for you though, I know how ta make one. And I like the look of ya.

I suppose I could come out of retirement and help ya for one last craft. It's been so long, it'll be nice to work the forge again. Just gotta find me hammer...
