==Objectives==
Report to [[Flynn Fairwind]] in [[Boralus]].

==Description==
Our [[Spy|spies]] have intercepted a [[Horde]] message describing an outcropping of [[:Azerite]] out in the [[Great Sea]].

The [[Wind's Redemption]] isn't quick enough to get us there before they do. Lucky for us, I've arranged to have a [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]] ship rigged and ready to go for opportunities like this.

Go speak with Captain Flynn Fairwind. He's been briefed, and should be waiting for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh... you're the <class> I'm supposed to be waiting for? Let's get to work.

==Progression==
{{Mission from the King}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
