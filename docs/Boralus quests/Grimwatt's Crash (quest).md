==Description==
The rescue that you planned for Grimwatt's Crash in [[Nazmir]] was successful. Well done.

I believe we should fortify the crash site and turn it into an outpost.

Make your way to Grimwatt's Crash and establish fortifications there.

Grimwatt's Crash will be an essential outpost in our campaign against the [[Horde]].

For the [[Alliance]]!

The crash site was surrounded when we arrived. It's a good thing we made it in time.
