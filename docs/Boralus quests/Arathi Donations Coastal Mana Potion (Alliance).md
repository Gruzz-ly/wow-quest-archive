==Objectives==
Bring 10 Coastal Mana Potions to [[Chelsea Strand]] in [[Boralus Harbor]].
* [[Coastal Mana Potion]] (10)

==Description==
One of our latest shipments of alchemical supplies was raided en route to storage. We're scrambling to get our stock back on track, but I'm worried we won't make our quota.

You wouldn't happen to know where one can acquire additional mana potions, would you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]
*500x [[Azerite (resource)]]

==Progress==
I'm looking to acquire a few potions to sustain our allies in a long-fought battle. Have anything of the kind?

==Completion==
This is just what I was looking for.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.1.0|note=Name changed from '''Wartime Donations: Coastal Mana Potion'''.}}
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
