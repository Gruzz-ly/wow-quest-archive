==Objectives==
Report to [[Jaina Proudmoore]] near [[Proudmoore Keep]] in [[Boralus]].

==Description==
While I deal with the [[naga]] incursions, Lady Proudmoore is going to take on handling the [[Horde]] in [[Stormsong Valley]] and figuring out what happened to our [[Spy|spies]] there.

You'll find her near Proudmoore Keep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It appears the Horde activity in Stormsong Valley is more serious than we originally thought.

==Notes==
*In front of the keep, Jaina has [[Proudmoore Guard (NPC)|six members]] of the [[Proudmoore Guard]] standing at attention in front of her.

==Progression==
{{A Gathering of Foes}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.1.5|note=Added.}}
