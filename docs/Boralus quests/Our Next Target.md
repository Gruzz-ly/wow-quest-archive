==Objectives==
Listen to the [[Alliance]] leadership debate the plan.
* Debate resolved

==Description==
Welcome back, <name>.

We're ready to set sail on our next mission.... Now we just need to reach an agreement on where we're headed.

[[Shandris Feathermoon|General Feathermoon]] and I disagree on which [[Horde]] target we should prioritize next. But if you'll give me just a moment, I'm confident I can convince her the value of my strategy and we'll be swiftly on our way.

I've considered every reasonable alternative. This is the best course of action.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,930 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm grateful for [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria's]] wisdom and our [[Void elf|new allies']] willingness to take the lead. This new two-pronged strategy opens up additional tactical options for us to consider.

I must ask Alleria to stay behind with me to coordinate our efforts on both ends. I'll need you to join [[Magister Umbric|Umbric]] on this mission and ensure its success. Good luck.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|We will deal with [[Blood Prince Dreven]] soon, General. But this is a rare opportunity to cripple the Horde's military. Everything else must wait.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|We can kill that [[Jastor Gallywix|gluttonous goblin]] any day! If Dreven escapes, we may never find him again.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Gallywix funds the [[Horde War Campaign|Horde's war campaign]] and understands [[:Azerite]] better than any of their other leaders.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Tactically speaking, he is their weak link. This is a rare opportunity. We must strike now.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I saw what Dreven was capable of, Wyrmbane. What if there are more like him?}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Forgive my interruption, but I believe you are both right.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|We cannot afford to allow either of these targets to escape us... and we do not need to.}}
:{{text|emote|Alleria opens a void portal behind her.}}
:''Magister Umbric pops out of the portal and takes a bow.''
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|My void elf forces can lead the effort to eliminate Gallywix.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|We will hunt him down and bring you his head. Shandris can focus on tracking that Blood Prince.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|A wise strategy. I approve.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Thank you, Alleria. Your aid is most welcome.}}
