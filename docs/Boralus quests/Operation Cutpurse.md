{{questportrait|Halford Wyrmbane BfA.jpg|Halford Wyrmbane|One thing is for sure: our path leads to [[Zuldazar]].}}
Meet with [[Halford Wyrmbane]] on the [[Wind's Redemption]] in [[Boralus Harbor]].

It is time to reconvene for our next mission, though [[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris]] and I disagree on what exactly that should entail.

Meet us on the Wind's Redemption.

You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,790 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I feel we are close to a conclusion, <name>. Perhaps your presence here will help.

==Notes==
Once completed, a conversation will trigger every time you return.
