==Objectives==
Bring the anvil back to [[Grix "Ironfists" Barlow|Grix Barlow]] in [[Boralus]].

==Description==
Take your anvil, and never speak of its methods of creation to anyone.

Should I find out otherwise, you may find your next visit to my realm an unpleasant one.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34|}}
*1,790 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Wait, what?! You actually got one? And you brought it back here?!

<Grix's eyes widen as you drop the anvil down next to him.>

Do you know what this means? It means I can start charging DOUBLE for the recipes!

Thank you, <name>. You're an amazing blacksmith!
