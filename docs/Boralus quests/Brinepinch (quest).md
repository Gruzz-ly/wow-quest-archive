==Objectives==
Kill [[Brinepinch]], and bring its "head" to [[Camilla Darksky]].
* [[Brinepinch's "Head"]]

==Description==
You! <name>! I have a business proposition for you.

There is a monstrous [[crab]] nesting in some of my favorite hunting grounds.

I've already been forced out of some areas because of the [[siren]]s, I'm not about to lose more to a CRAB!

Bring me the head of Brinepinch! In return I'll teach you how to get more leather when skinning.

<Camilla pauses for a second before clarifying her thought.>

Sorry, most creatures that wrong me have heads. Just bring me some part of it as proof of its death.

==Rewards==
You will learn: Skinning Technique: Leather Gathering (Rank 2)

==Progress==
Have you slain the beast yet?

==Completion==
Excellent! I'll have to celebrate by going hunting later today.

As for you, <name>, allow me to show you a technique you've probably never seen before...

==Progression==
# [[Brinepinch (quest)]]
# [[Ivory Handled Dagger (quest)]]
