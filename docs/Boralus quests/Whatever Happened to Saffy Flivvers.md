==Objectives==
Search for signs of [[Sapphronetta Flivvers]] in [[Tanaris]]

==Description==
When [[:Azerite]] was discovered, my friend Saffy was sent to investigate what it could do. There was an attack and we all thought she'd died. Then it turns out she was forced to work in some kind of [[goblin]] think tank in Tanaris! But before we could get her out, the whole place exploded.

Now, my bosses have written her off as dead. But she wasn't dead the first time so I'm not sure she is now. I've been told not to go looking for her, but you could take a look.

Find Saffy, or what's left of her?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<You find the charred pieces of some mechanical contraption. A parrot, maybe? It isn't Saffy Flivvers, but it's evidence of her work. Perhaps there are more clues to be found in the area.>
