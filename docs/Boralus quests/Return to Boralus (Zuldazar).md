==Objectives==
Return to [[Halford Wyrmbane]] on the [[Wind's Redemption]]. [[Daria Smithson]] can give you a ride.
*Speak to Daria Smithson

==Description==
You know, a lot has happened since you arrived in [[Zuldazar]]! I'm sure Mr. Wyrmbane would appreciate a report.

Oh, not from me. Maybe somebody a bit more serious... like you!

I bet Daria over here could get you back pretty quick!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* Choice of Azerite armor
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* [[Glowing Azerite Crystal]] (250x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We'll base our operations out of [[Xibala]], then. And I'll have some reinforcements sent out to assist [[Brigadier Thom]].

Thank you for your report, <name>. Well done.

This completes the "Zuldazar Foothold" chapter of [[Ready for War]]. Wyrmbane will start [[The Ongoing Campaign (Alliance)]] to start another foothold, the [[Island Expedition (Alliance)]] intro, or [[Uniting Kul Tiras]].
