==Objectives==
Speak with Mathias Shaw in the garden within Proudmoore Keep.
* Speak with [[Mathias Shaw]] near [[Proudmoore Keep]]

==Description==
It's time, <name>. We have the [[:Abyssal Scepter]], along with confirmation that the [[bomb]]s [[Victory is Assured|placed amongst]] the [[Golden Fleet|Zandalari fleet]] are still active.

Unfortunately, even with everything at our disposal, we would still lose a frontal assault against the [[Zandalari Empire|Zandalari empire]].

For that reason, we plan to lure the forces of the [[Horde]] and the Zandalari away from the [[Port of Zandalar|harbor]].

Mathias Shaw is holding a meeting nearby, and he has requested your presence.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I take it you and the [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lord Admiral]] were able to send the Horde packing?

==Completion==
Now you know the gravity of the situation. We must begin.

==Notes==
In the middle of the hedge maze, Mathias stands in a loose circle with Wyrmbane, Jaina Proudmoore, [[Genn Greymane]], and from the [[Army of the Light]] back in [[Krokuun]], [[Blademaster Telaamon]].

Speak with Mathias Shaw:
{{Dialogue|
Good, you're here. I'm assuming Halford has told you about our plan to attack [[Zuldazar]].

Let's go over the details. You'll be playing a key part in all of this.

:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|The [[tidesages]] will use the Abyssal Scepter to conceal our true intentions beneath a thick layer of mist. Meanwhile, [[Kul Tiran fleet|the fleet]] will invade [[Dazar'alor]] from the south.}}
: ''Mathias continues, regretful but committed.''
:{{text|say|Mathias Shaw|I won't lie. Not everyone will be coming back from this. We need the Horde to believe the attack is real.}}
:{{text|say|Mathias Shaw|Sacrifices will be unavoidable... but if we are successful, we can bring this whole war to an end in a matter of weeks.}}
