==Objectives==
Plant 10 Riverbud Seeds in rivermud.
* [[Rivermud|Riverbud Seeds]] Planted (10)

==Description==
With everything that's been happening over in [[Drustvar]], there's been a sudden surge of wildlife in the sound. Normally, I wouldn't care, but they've been eating all the [[:riverbud]]!

If things don't improve soon, we could try thinning their numbers so they don't consume everything, but I'll consider that the last resort.

Instead, could you go plant some of these seeds to produce additional food for them?

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Riverbud (Rank 2)]]

==Progress==
Have you planted the seeds yet?

==Completion==
I can't thank you enough! Riverbud is absolutely critical to the wildlife here. Regardless, I said I'd teach you if you helped out, and I'll ever be true to my word.

The biggest mistake that most herbalists out here do is allow the riverbuds to blow out when harvested.

When you go to pick riverbud, you can't just rip them off the stem, or all the water will spill out. Instead, give them a twist first so they pinch the stem closed. Try it out!
