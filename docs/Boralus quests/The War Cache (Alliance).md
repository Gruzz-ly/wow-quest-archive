==Objectives==
Gather 100 War Resources. War Resources can be obtained from many sources, including quests and treasure chests.
* [[War Resources]] x100

==Description==
<Name>. Let's talk.

This war won't be won simply by adding the [[Kul Tiras|Kul Tirans]] to our ranks. We eventually need to crush the Horde.

You and I will be leading an expedition to... disrupt the Horde operations in [[Zandalar]]. But first, we need resources.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Ready to sail when you are, <name>.

==Completion==
You have gathered enough resources to begin the assault on Zandalar.

==Notes==
This introduces the [[Garrison Resources]] and [[Order Resources]] analog of ''Battle for Azeroth''.

Don't grind it all out this instant - the resources will come while working on the main storyline quests.

==Progression==
{{Mission from the King}}

==Beta version==
{{Rfb-section}}
;Completion
<Halford looks over the gathered resources.>

This should do it.
