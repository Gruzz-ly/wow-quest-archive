==Objectives==
Report to [[Ralston Karn]] in [[Boralus Harbor]].

==Description==
We cannot myopically focus all our efforts on [[Zandalar]]. [[Horde]] treachery simmers all across [[Azeroth|the globe]].

One particular hot spot lies in the [[Arathi Highlands]], near the storied citadel of [[Stromgarde]]. The Horde has set up an encampment nearby, and intends to capture our territory.

Speak with Ralston Karn, the recruitment officer for the division in charge of this particular warfront. He could use a good <class> like you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You're <name>, with the [[7th Legion]]?

Welcome. We've heard about you. Let's get to work.

==Notes==
*After unlocking world quests, you should be able to get this quest automatically by logging in while while outside [[Boralus]].

==Progression==
