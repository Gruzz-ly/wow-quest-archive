==Objectives==
Send [[Falstad Wildhammer|Falstad]] on a mission.
*"[[The Shadow War (Alliance)|The Shadow War]]" mission completed

==Description==
Every war is fought on multiple fronts, <class>.

[[Anduin Wrynn|King Wrynn]] has tasked [[Halford Wyrmbane]] and his [[7th Legion]] with securing our position in [[Kul Tiras]] as well as [[Zandalar]].

But they cannot succeed [[SI:7|without us]]. We are the unseen hand. The shadows in the darkness.

I have been charged with establishing an elite strike force, and I need you to act as liaison between Wyrmbane's efforts and my own.

You will help direct our missions going forward. Let us begin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Without us, this war would be lost easily.

==Completion==
I am sure Falstad will handle this mission with his usual grace.

==Notes==
Interact with the Mission Command Table on the ship and send Falstad on "The Shadow War". The mission will take two hours, so keep questing in the meantime.

One of those quests can be [[The Zandalar Campaign]], offered by Wyrmbane on the other side of the deck.

==Progression==
{{Mission from the King}}
