==Objectives==
Craft a Potion of Durability and a Potion of Shifting States using the recipes given to you. You can find the ingredients you need in [[Elric Whalgrene|Elric]]'s shop.
* [[Potion of Durability]]
* [[Potion of Shifting States]]

==Description==
Would you mind helping me out with something, <name>?

<Elric motions you over to him.>

You see, I have this recipe that, well, I only have half of currently. I've been trying to remember the other half but just can't seem to recall it.

My EX-partner tore the recipe and ran off with the other half over a disagreement we were having. But the stone it makes is invaluable.

How about you grab some vials and start mixing the ingredients on this list. Perhaps together we can figure this out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|5|85|}}
* 4,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I wouldn't dare ask for the other half back, not after what [[Quintin Whalgrene|Quintin]] said to me. I'll get this mystery figured out, you'll see.

==Completion==
Let's give it a try, shall we?

==Notes==
Items needed for the quest are:
* [[Dried Star Moss Leaves]] (10)
* [[Sand Shifter Scales]] (3)
* [[Storm Silver Shards]] (3)
* [[Test Vial]] (2)
