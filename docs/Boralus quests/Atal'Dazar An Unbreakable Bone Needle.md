==Objectives==
Travel to [[Atal'Dazar]] and collect [[Rezan]]'s Bone Fragment.
* [[Rezan's Bone Splinter]]
* [[Yazma (tactics)|Yazma]] slain

==Description==
Hey, <name>, lookin' for work?

I've heard through [[Alliance Intelligence]] that the [[Zandalari troll|trolls]] have a dead [[god]] or something similar. 'Rezan' I think was the name, over in Atal'Dazar.

After the last time I broke a bone needle, I can't help but think that one made from the bone of a god has got to be indestructible, right?

I want you to retrieve one of his bones. Or at least something big enough that I can carve an eye in and use.

In return, I'll show you everything that I know about harvesting bones.

==Rewards==
You will learn:	Skinning Technique: Bone Gathering (Rank 3)

==Progress==
I hope this works. Going the rest of my life without needing to replace that damn needle...

Have ya got it?

==Completion==
Good! This is the perfect size for some of the smaller, more delicate work, the kind that would break needles constantly.

Are you ready for your lesson?

<Camilla spends the next several minutes showing you how to dislocate and quickly flay bones that were previously too time consuming to bother trying to collect.>
