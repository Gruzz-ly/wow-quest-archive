'''Made in Kul Tiras''' is the first quest in the [[allied race recruitment quests|recruitment questline]] for the [[Kul Tiran (playable)|Kul Tiran]] [[allied race]]. This quest can only be picked up after completing [[Proudmoore Admiralty (achievement)]], [[Tides of Vengeance (achievement)]], and [[A Nation United]].

==Objectives==
Speak to Cyrus in [[Boralus Harbor]].
* Speak to [[Cyrus Crestfall|Cyrus]]

==Description==
Are you curious about how the [[Kul Tiran]]s joined the [[Alliance]]?

It was assumed that Kul Tiras would rejoin the Alliance after everything that was done to [[A Nation United|stabilize their nation]].

[[Jaina Proudmoore|Lady Jaina Proudmoore]] wanted to cement the allegiance by building [[Anduin Wrynn|King Anduin]] a ship worthy of the Kul Tiran navy.

She wished for help in finding the best shipwright in Kul Tiras, [[Dorian Atwater]]. It wouldn't be easy, as Dorian was retired. It all began with a trip to see Cyrus in Boralus Harbor... 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
I may be able to help you find this shipwright, <name>.

==Notes==
In the [[Harbormaster's Office]] in [[Boralus]], speak to [[Cyrus Crestfall|Cyrus]]:
:Good to see you again, <name>.
:{{gossip|I am told you know where to find the shipwright, [[Dorian Atwater]]?}}
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|Hmm... Dorian Atwater...}}
:''Jaina enters the room, speaking as she approaches.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I believe Atwater's ships were the gold standard while you were serving in [[Daelin Proudmoore|my father]]'s guard.}}
:''Cyrus chuckles.''
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|That was a long time ago, Lord Admiral. But the name does ring a bell...}}

;Description
The [[Alliance]] and [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiras]] have already sealed their pact, but I want to cement our bond with a grand gesture.

I want to build [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] a ship worthy of the [[Kul Tiran fleet|Kul Tiran navy]].

There is a shipwright in [[Kul Tiras]] whose work is revered above all others. Sadly, they retired many years ago. All I know about them is their name: [[Dorian Atwater]].

Cyrus might know where to find this person. Come with me to [[Boralus]] and we will ask him.

;On accepting this quest:
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I will meet you in the harbormaster's office.}}
:''Jaina teleports away.''
