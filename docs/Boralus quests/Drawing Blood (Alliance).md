==Objectives==
Sign the Bloodbound Ledger.
*Bloodbound Ledger Signed

==Description==
Hey, <name>! I have something exciting to tell you about, but you must keep a secret. Just between us [[Inscription|scribe]]s.

<[[Zooey Inksprocket|Zooey]] gives you a wink and pulls out a large tome.>

This is the Bloodbound Ledger. Inscribing your name in it allows you to learn how to craft "blood contracts" which can hurt a little bit, but are absolutely worth it!

I currently know one of them and I get so excited when I use it 'cause it... well, you'll see.

So whaddya say? Interested?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Let's see here. Yes, everything looks in order and it appears the spell has already taken effect on you.

You're now able to learn how to craft the deadly, eerily haunting, "blood contracts". WoooOOOooo.

<Zooey puts on some theatrics as she says the last part.>

Haha, just messin' with ya, <name>. But seriously, these things can be pretty dangerous.
