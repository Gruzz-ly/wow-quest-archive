==Objectives==
Slay Harlan Sweete in the [[Freehold (instance)|Freehold dungeon]].
* Defeat [[Harlan Sweete]] in Freehold

==Description==
Hey, uh, I don't usually ask for help with personal business, but I know when I'm outmatched.

Someone's gotta take down Harlan.

He's a maniac. The things I saw him do back in the day... that's why I left Freehold in the first place.

H-hey don't think of it as a favor for me--even though it would be a HUGE favor--think of it as making the seas safer for everyone, or something noble like that.

<Flynn leans in and whispers.>

Plus there's a big fat bounty on his head!

("Harlan Sweete: Captain of the Irontide Raiders")

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|131|65|}} (at lvl 120)
* [[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (600x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* +500 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
What's say sixty-forty split on the bounty? Eh?

Seventy-thirty?

How about a finder's fee?

==Completion==
Gotta admit, when I first saw you in that prison cell I wasn't sure what all the fuss was about.

But you really came through for me. You came through for everyone.

Thanks, mate.
