==Objectives==
Meet [[Tinkmaster Overspark]] outside the mysterious vault.

==Description==
I came as soon as I heard! A mysterious vault has been discovered in [[Tiragarde Sound|Tiragarde]]. 

Centuries ago, the last king of the [[gnome]]s, [[King Mechagon]], led his followers in search of a mythical [[Mechagon Island|land of technology]]. He left no clue as to where he was headed, and over time his legend faded into history. This vault could be the first step to discovering King Mechagon's true fate!

I must examine it firsthand. Meet me there, Champion. I could use your assistance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|34}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It's as promising as I had hoped! Now that you're here we shall begin the investigation.
