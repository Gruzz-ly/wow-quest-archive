* Explore the [[Uncharted Island]]

==Description==
Alright! Let's snap to it! We've got to get to that island before the [[Horde]] does, don't we?

You ready?

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (500x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Ready when you are.

==Completion==
You and I make a pretty good team, don't we? Let's, uh, do this again sometime.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Pretty sure this is the place. Supposed to be a lot of Azerite around here.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|You know, there could also be, like, giant spiders here, too. I'm just saying, you never know.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Bring her in, try not to hit anything. And get the gangplanks down, thanks.}}

===Stage 1:===
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Our Azerite detector is showing a source of... well, Azerite close by. Why don't you go out there and investigate? I'll, uh, stay here.}}

===Stage 2: An Oceanic Outcropping===
*''Mine the Azerite Crystals''
*Mine Azerite Crystals (3)
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Wow, that is a big chunk of Azerite. Mine that sucker, and we'll get the shards back to the ship right away.}}

Each outcrop is worth 35 Azerite.

===Stage 3: There's More===
*''Investigate the second source of Azerite.''
*Investigate second source of Azerite
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Woohoo! That's a nice haul. Good work!}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|All right, detector's pointing to another Azerite source near your position. Give it a look.}}

===Stage 4: Encrusted Crustacean===
*''Kill the Encrusted Kingscuttler''
*Kill [[Encrusted Kingscuttler]]
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Whoa, that's a big monster, and it's completely coated in Azerite residue. You kill it, we'll extract the Azerite.}}

Defeat it to acquire 100 Azerite.

===Stage 5: Off the Charts===
*''Investigate the third source of Azerite.''
*Investigate third source of Azerite
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Nice. I mean, it's bloody and gross, but what are you going to do? Azerite's Azerite.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|We just spotted a huge load of Azerite nearby. This is going to be good.}}

===Stage 6: Azerite Raid===
*''Take the Azerite from the Kunzen hozen tribe.''
*Obtain more Azerite Residue (500)
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Hozen? Here? Huh, I guess you never know who's going to show up on these islands.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|And they've also been collecting Azerite. Well, that's convenient. Just kill them and loot their stuff.}}

Get to killing. [[Akakakoo]] in camp is marked on the map, and is worth 120 Azerite. Additionally, the Sack of Azerite behind him is worth another 70.
:{{text|say|Akakakoo|Ookin'... dooker...}}

===Final Stage: Escape!===
*Escape from Uncharted Isle before the Horde arrive.
*Get back to the ship

:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|And that's all of it. Looks like the island's cleared, and not a moment too soon. Zandalari ship on the horizon.}}
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|I see they're after the Azerite, too. Clever, clever, but not fast enough to beat us. Let's get moving before we catch their attention.}}

===Finale===
:{{text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Get those planks up, we're shipping out immediately. Last thing I need is holes in my ship.}}

==Progression==
{{Mission from the King}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
