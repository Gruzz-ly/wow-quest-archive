==Objectives==
Speak with [[Telonis]] in [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]].

==Description==
I was in [[Teldrassil]] when it was set alight. Through the panic and chaos, I knew I could not rest as long as those who did this were unpunished.

I need you to go to Stormwind, find Telonis near the [[Lion's Rest]], and ask for some of his personal collection.

I managed to save him from the fires, so he owes me a great deal. I would go myself, but the loss of Teldrassil is still a fresh wound. I still need to give it time to heal.

Find him, tell him I sent you, and that this will absolve his debt to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<You explain your mission and relation to [[Daniss Ghostdancer|Daniss]].>

I see. Of course I'm more than willing to help. She may be a [[Darnassian#Darnassian primer (official translations)|T'lara]], but I do owe her my life.

However, there is a slight issue that will need to be dealt with.

==Progression==
