==Objectives==
Travel to the location marked on your map and see what you can find.
*Travel to [[Dustwallow Marsh]]
*Search for Clues
*Locate the Cave and Investigate
* [[Vault Guardian (Dustwallow Marsh)|Vault Guardian]] slain
* [[The Missing Chapter]]
* [[Transcribed Final Chapter]]

==Description==
<Samuel puts down the journal and looks back up at you.>

While trying to figure out where the shrines reside, I came across an entry that mentioned him exploring an area that sounds very similar to [[Dustwallow Marsh]].

He mentions hiding something of great importance there.

It's a long shot, given when this earthen roamed [[Azeroth]], but perhaps if you were to retrace his final steps you may find something.

I'll mark the location on your map.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Who knows what you may find out there. Hopefully something...

==Completion==
What did you find?

<You hand the final chapter and its transcription over to Samuel. As he reads through it, he reaches the page with the design for the lens and his eyes go wide.>

You've found it, <name>! We can construct a lens now and use it with the shrines.

Although, the reagents for this design are quite... rare. But nevertheless you've done it!

It was an honor to work with you on this, <name>.
