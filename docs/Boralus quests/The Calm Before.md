==Objectives==
Take the [[SI:7]] report to Lady Jaina
* Take the report to [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]]
* Wait a moment

==Description==
A word, <name>.

There was [[The Fury of the Horde|a raid]] on the [[Norwington Estate]], where we were testing some new designs of [[:Azerite]] systems. Lady Jaina asked SI:7 to look into the matter. I have the report here.

I know the [[House Proudmoore|Proudmoore family]] [[A Nation United (quest)|wants a moment together]] before they're pulled apart again, but the [[Fourth War|war]] is still ongoing.

You have been a friend to her family. Take the report to Jaina. I believe they went to pay respects at the [[Lord Admiral's Rest|family memorial]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 4,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The [[Horde]] cannot be allowed to think it can come to our lands without resistence{{sic}}.

==Completion==
Another attack! The Horde is growing bold. I cannot let this stand.

: ''At Lord Admiral's Rest, Jaina stands back a bit as [[Katherine Proudmoore|Katherine]] and [[Tandred Proudmoore|Tandred]] talk by the memorials.''
: {{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|How quickly the world changes.}}
: {{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|[[Tandred Proudmoore (grave)|The memorial]] is very nice, Mother. I like the bit about how you said I was fearless.}}
: {{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Don't make light of a mother's pain, Tandred.}}
: {{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|First I lost your brother [[Derek Proudmoore|Derek]], then [[Daelin Proudmoore|your father]], then Jaina. When you disappeared with the fleet, I was all alone.}}
: {{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|I'm sorry, Mother. But Jaina and I are here now. Thank the tides that the three of us are together again.}}
: {{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|So we are... and I am very grateful.}}

;Take the report to Jaina
: I knew returning home would be dangerous, but I had to take the chance. I did not expect to find healing.

{{gossip|Sorry to disturb you. I've brought a report from Master Shaw.}}

;Wait a moment
: ''Tandred half turns and addresses Jaina as she walks up.''
: {{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|[[Lord Admiral]].}}
: ''She responds at first with bemusement.''
: {{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Don't start, Tandred. It still feels strange to hear people call me that. I'd always assumed Derek would become the next Lord Admiral.}}
: {{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|Aye. But such was not his fate.}}
: ''Katherine fumes.''
: {{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|When I think of those Horde savages seizing his body and [[When a Plan Comes Together|hanging it on display...]]}}
: {{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|It was a ploy to provoke us. To goad us into making mistakes. We will not give them the satisfaction.}}
: {{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|Part of me wonders what our brother and father would make of all that [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiras]] has been through. All that we've endured as a family.}}
: {{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|I fear Derek would be disappointed by how I behaved. Especially toward you, Jaina.}}
: {{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|Father could be hard, but I do think he'd be happy to see us together again.}}
: {{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|We've all made mistakes, but we'll weather this storm, dear ones. Together.}}
: {{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|We're so glad you're home, Jaina. I believe that we--What's this? Incoming!}}
: ''[[Taelia]] flies in on [[Galeheart]]; as soon as she leaps off, the [[gryphon]] collapses on the ground in exhaustion.''
