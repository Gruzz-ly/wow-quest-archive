==Objectives==
Return the Ivory Handled Dagger to [[Camilla Darksky]].
* [[Ivory Handled Dagger]]

==Description==
While skinning the beast, you feel a lump within the beast's stomach.

Investigating further, you find what appears to be a dagger with a beautifully etched ivory handle.

Carefully extracting it, you wonder if Camilla Darksky might know something about this.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Skinning Technique: Leather Gathering (Rank 3)]]

==Completion==
I wondered what happened to him...

Yes, I recognize the blade. It was my mentor's.

We sailed here together, but later he went missing. He talked about building a home in [[Drustvar]] overlooking the ocean, so I figured that's what happened.

But I guess he was eaten by the creature... in which case, I'm thankful you avenged him by slaying it.

As a thank you for this closure, let me show you his secret to skinning.

<Camilla takes out a fresh pelt and begins showcasing her lost mentor's technique.>
