==Objectives==
Search through patches of sea weed to find a memento of the lost [[sailor]].
* [[Sailor's Cutlass]]

==Description==
I have a task that I can't really trust to anyone else, and I feel you could handle it with the reverence it deserves.

An old friend of mine came to me today, bringing a wilted sea stalk flower with her. Her husband was on a ship south east of [[Freehold]]. I'm not sure if it was [[pirate]]s, the [[Horde]], or a squall, but she said she didn't want revenge, just closure.

If you could get her something to remember him by, I'll tell you everything I know about [[Sea Stalk|sea stalks]], and you'd have my gratitude.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Sea Stalk (Rank 3)]]

==Progress==
Have you found any of his personal effects?

==Completion==
I can't thank you enough for this.

Death seems to always haunt this land, but it's sting is somewhat lessened if we can still hold on to the memories of those departed. I'll need to get some fresh [[Star Moss|star moss]] for the funeral, but I'd prefer to do that myself.

Sadly, there isn't much left I can teach you about [[Sea Stalk|sea stalk]]. Let's see... something to help... ah, yes!

To help you get the most of each plant, instead of cutting it off, carefully pull it out of the sand and tear off the roots.
