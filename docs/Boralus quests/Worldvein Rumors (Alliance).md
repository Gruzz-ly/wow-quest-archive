==Objectives==
Collect 3 Worldvein Intelligence Reports.
* [[Worldvein Intelligence Reports]] (provided) (3)

==Description==
Gather intelligence to assist [[SI:7]] in identifying the location of the [[:Fluctuating Worldvein]].

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Investigating the Rumors (Alliance)]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered enough intelligence?

==Completion==
This is exactly the intelligence [[Mathias Shaw]] wanted me to watch out for, I will pass it over to him immediately. I am sure he will have a Mission waiting for you.

==Notes==
Flynn will not be present to turn in the quest if you haven't started [[The Ashvane Trading Company]]. Head to the [[Harbormaster's Office]], pick up the quest [[A Nation Divided]] from the map board, and complete the first three quests of the Tirigarde campaign. This takes just a few moments of interacting with characters in the Harbormaster's Office. Once you accept the fourth quest, Flynn will again be available at the Island Expeditions table.
