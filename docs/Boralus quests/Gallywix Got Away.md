==Objectives==
Return to [[Halford Wyrmbane|High Commander Halford Wyrmbane]] on the ''[[Wind's Redemption]]'' in [[Boralus]].

==Description==
I must confess my disappointment that we were not able to bring an end to [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix's]] greedy reign today.

But I blame no one but myself, and will report the same to the High Commander. Your performance was exemplary, just as I expected.

I hope the [[Alliance]] will not lose faith in the [[void elf|void elves]] because of this. We have much to offer.

When you're ready, I will open a final Void portal to take us back to Boralus.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* [[Radiant Azerite Matrix]] (800x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Not every failed mission is a failure.

We've put Gallywix on the run and uncovered his decoy operations. And I, personally, also learned a thing or two from the surprising tactics of Umbric's void elf regiment.

I have no doubt that the denizens of the [[Void]] will prove valuable to the Alliance in the trying days ahead.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Magister Umbric|This is not the complete victory I'd hoped to earn for the Alliance, but I will not add tardiness to my failings here.}}
:{{text|say|Magister Umbric|Follow me. I will take us directly to [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] and the High Commander.}}

Take the [[Void Portal]] to return to the ''Wind's Redemption'':
:{{text|say|Magister Umbric|On behalf of all void elves, I apologize for our failure.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Nonsense. You and your people performed admirably, Magister. You're a credit to the Alliance.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|One Gallywix was already more than [[Azeroth]] needed, and now we have... what do you think, Halford, dozens?}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|There's only one real Gallywix, and we'll find him. I'll inform [[Mathias Shaw|Shaw]] of the decoys.}}
:{{text|say|Magister Umbric|I'm happy to share any details I can remember that might help them.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Thank you, Magister. Your insight will be most valuable.}}

This concludes the "A Golden Opportunity" chapter of [[Ready for War]]. The war campaign continues at 7,500/12,000 {{rep|Honored}} standing with the [[7th Legion]] on the quest [[Operation: Gryphon's Claw]]
