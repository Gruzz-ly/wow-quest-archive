==Objectives==
Harvest 9 Mature Anchor Pods from anchor weed.
* [[Mature Anchor Pod]] (9)

==Description==
Everyone in [[Kul Tiras]] knows that [[Anchor Weed|anchor weed]] is a blight that was brought here by merchants.

It thrives in this weather and it leechs nutrients from other plants, so we work to keep it from spreading, but it also has a strong magical essence, keeping us from just eradicating it.

However, if it has mutated so it can disperse more seeds, we may need to finally purge it.

Bring me the biggest seed pods you can find, we need to see if this is a unique case. I'll dissect this one and learn what I can.

==Progress==
If the anchor weed is mutating, we may need to purge it from this land. Do you have the other seed pods for comparison?

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Anchor Weed (Rank 3)]]

==Completion==
These all look reasonably sized, which helps to confirm my suspicions.

While I was dissecting the enormous pod, I found glass splinters and noticed that the interior had an alchemical smell. It sounds crazy, but I think an adventurer dropped an [[Elixir of Giant Growth|elixir of giant growth]], shattering the vial and this plant soaked it up.

The enlarged anatomy of the giant pod let me notice that these thick walls of the seed pod are actually thin and lined with additional seeds!  You can peel the pod for more seeds!
