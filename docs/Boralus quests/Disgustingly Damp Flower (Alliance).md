==Objectives==
Bring the [[Disgustingly Damp Flower]] to {{npc|Alliance|Declan Senal}}.
* [[Disgustingly Damp Flower]] (provided)

==Description==
Rummaging for pollen as usual, you use the harvesting technique you learned from the [[bee]]s. However, when you pull your hand away from the flower, you find that there is no pollen on your gloves.

Looking inside the swirl of petals, despite it being a mature flower, you see that there is no pollen at all within it. Upon closer inspection you see that the flower is filled with a viscous liquid. Could the flower have done this?

While unpleasant to touch, you carefully pluck the flower to show [[Declan Senal|Declan]].

==Completion==
Curious. There's no pollen at all? Can't say that I've heard of a plant doing that before.

Hmmmmmmmmm?

What I think we have here is a more effective way of harvesting pollen than that of the [[Bee|bees]].

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Siren's Pollen (Rank 3)]]
