'''Waning Energy''' begins the [[Allied Races: Mechagnome]] recruitment quest chain. Reaching level 40 on an [[Alliance]] character is the only current precondition. Prior to [[Patch 10.1.5]] further preconditions were being exalted with [[Rustbolt Resistance]] and having completed [[The Mechagonian Threat]], including [[Operation: Mechagon - The Mechoriginator]] (also counts when obtained on a [[Horde]] character). As of [[patch 8.3]], [[Operation: Mechagon]] is available in [[Heroic mode]], including [[Dungeon Finder]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Kelsey Steelspark]] at [[Proudmoore Keep]].

==Description==
[[Gelbin Mekkatorque|Mekkatorque]]'s pod is powering down.

We are no longer able to hear him speak.

His pulse has slowed, in spite of the best efforts of [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]] [[healer]]s.

I have an idea, but I am going to need your help.

Meet me at Proudmoore Keep. We must go soon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What we're about to do may not be... uh... an approved plan.

We will just ask for forgiveness later.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|<Name>! Your timing couldn't be better! Mekkatorque is fading fast...}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|The tidesages are trying to heal him at Proudmoore Keep. Meet me there!}}
: ''She runs off towards the [[flight master]].''

Head to the east side of [[Proudmoore Keep]], where two [[Tidesage Mender]]s and a [[Tidesage Enuser]] are channeling into [[Mekkatorque's Escape Pod]].

==Progression==
