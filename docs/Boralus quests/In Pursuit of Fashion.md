==Objectives==
Loot 3 Pristine [[Saurolisk]] Skins from [[Shallows Saurolisk]]s in [[Drustvar]].
* [[Pristine Saurlisk Skin]] (3)

==Description==
Despite me REPEATEDLY stating that I'm not a [[leatherworker]], [[Nobles of Kul Tiras|one of the fat nobles]] of [[Boralus|this city]] has commissioned me to make him a belt of 'the finest saurolisk' hide.

So... I'm just going to get the materials together, give them and some of the gold to [[Cassandra Brennor|Cassandra]] to make the actual belt, and pocket the difference.

That said, I need you to bring me saurolisk leather, enough to circle a very wide lord.

For your efforts, I'll look at the skins and see if I can give you pointers on how to harvest more.

==Rewards==
You will learn: Skinning Technique: Scale Gathering (Rank 2)

==Progress==
Have ya got the hides?

My employer is becoming... incessant.

==Completion==
<Camilla takes a moment to look over the hides.>

Acceptable work. We'll lose some material trimming, but there should be enough to encompass our esteemed and honorable benefactor.

Also, I think I see an error that, if corrected, could help when you're harvesting from anything with scales. Show me what you did.

<Camilla hands you a knife and watches your movements as you explain. She occasionally stops you to adjust the position of your hands and states that it'll help next time.>
