==Objectives==
Collect 12 Heaping Handfuls of Damp Pollen.
* [[Heaping Handful of Damp Pollen]] (12)

==Description==
What I think happened is that some creature lapped up all the pollen with it's tongue.

While I'm curious as to what creature could have done this, I doubt it matters. I believe we can safely reproduce this without needing any sort of rare or dangerous reagents.

Next time you find a [[Siren's Pollen|siren's sting]], simply try wetting your glove so the pollen will stick to it. Water, wine, spit... It shouldn't matter.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Siren's Pollen (Rank 3)]]

==Progress==
It may not be the most ideal gathering method you've ever experienced, but maybe this could work.

==Completion==
It seems like Declan's theory was right. By wetting your gloves, you've managed to collect copious amounts of pollen.

==Progression==
