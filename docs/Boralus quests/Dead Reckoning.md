==Objectives==
Attend the discussion in [[Unity Square]].
* Speak with [[Anduin Wrynn]]
* Attend the meeting

==Description==
While I have some concerns, I cannot deny the bravery, heroism and sacrifices we have made. That you have made, <name>. Thank you for all the aid you have given to the [[Alliance]].

The future of our [[Alliance War Campaign|ongoing war campaign]] is why I have asked everyone here. I wish to look at what we've done, so we can decide on the best way forward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Core]] (750x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* +2,000 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
This war may have been necessary, but it is my hope it will be over soon. Then we can begin rebuilding.

==Completion==
We may be on the cusp of winning but we cannot lose sight of ourselves or we will have lost what is most important and our victories will be for nothing.

I hope it will be as [[Halford Wyrmbane|High Commander Wyrmbane]] and [[Mathias Shaw|Master Shaw]] say it is and we will see a conclusion soon. Then... Then we can begin the process of rebuilding and healing - Ourselves as well as [[Azeroth]] and the [[Horde]].

==Notes==
;Speak with Anduin Wrynn
There can be no peace without action.

: ''Wyrmbane salutes as he speaks.''
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|My king, the attack on [[Zuldazar]] was a resounding success.}}
:{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|The Horde is losing on all fronts. The Alliance should achieve victory in a matter of weeks.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Yes, but at what cost? So many fallen... including [[Gelbin Mekkatorque|Mekkatorque]], whose life hangs by a thread. And I fear the death of [[Rastakhan]] will ignite a fire in the hearts of the [[Zandalari]].}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|He was a casualty of war, Anduin. A king must be willing to sacrifice himself for his people without doubt or hesitation.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|[[Varian Wrynn|I know that]], Genn... [[Battle for Broken Shore|as well as anyone]].}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|But our mission was to drive a wedge between the Zandalari and the Horde. Instead, we may have strengthened their bond.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|More than half the Zandalari vessels were destroyed in the initial strike, and the Horde fleet is in disarray. Their remaining ships cannot hope to stand against the [[Kul Tiran navy]].}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|The Horde has never been more vulnerable. We should strike hard... before [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] hatches another vile scheme.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Press the attack as the Zandalari mourn their fallen king? That would make us no better than the Banshee.}}
:{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|She's the real problem here. I imagine she is already finding ways to turn this to her advantage.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|We must continue the fight. But as we push toward victory, we must never lose sight of who we are and what we stand for.}}

;Complete
: ''As the meeting ends and the others walk out of the square, Anduin and Jaina turn to each other.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Jaina, is there anything you can do for Mekkatorque?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I'm sorry. The mechanism preserving his body is unlike any magic I have encountered.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Our priests feel just as helpless. ''(Sighs)'' History will say we won a great victory in Zuldazar. Yet I find little cause for celebration.}}
: ''Jaina commiserates.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|It was a costly battle... in many ways.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|But enough of that. How are you faring? You held off the Horde's finest warriors so our fleet could withdraw. You risked everything for the Alliance, Jaina.}}
: ''Jaina reassures him.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Still recovering, but... I'll be fine. You have enough on your mind without worrying about me.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|It is good to have you back with us, Auntie. I missed you.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|So much transpired while I was away. Anduin... I've heard rumors about an old friend of mine--[[Calia Menethil]]. [[Gathering|What happened]] in [[Arathi Highlands|Arathi]]?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|There is much to explain. Some I still don't fully understand... but I'll tell you what I know.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Thank you. Let's find somewhere quiet to talk.}}
: ''They leave the square together.''
