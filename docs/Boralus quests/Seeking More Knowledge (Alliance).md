==Objectives==
Retrieve the Treatise on Anchor Weed from within [[Waycrest Manor]].
* [[A Treatise on Anchor Weed]]
* [[Gorak Tul]] slain

==Description==
It pains me to admit that I don't know everything about plants. I've taught you everything I know about [[:Anchor Weed]], but I think I know where you could look to learn more. Unfortunately, it's in Waycrest Manor, and that whole area's been crawling with monsters as of late.

If you find yourself inside that manor, keep an eye out for a book called, "The Treatise on Anchor Weed". Its author spent decades studying that forsaken weed.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Anchor Weed (Rank 2)]]

==Progress==
Have you retrieved the book?

==Completion==
Outstanding! And it's in such good condition, too! Now let's see if there's anything in here that could be of help for you.

<Several moments pass as Declan mutters to himself excitedly>

Ah ha! Here ya go! The seed pods open when the plant is disturbed, but if the first cut is at the base, that drains a reservoir of water that is used to open and close the pods.  So, start at the bottom, working your way up, and you should get a better harvest.
