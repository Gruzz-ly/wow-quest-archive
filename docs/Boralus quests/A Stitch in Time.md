==Objectives==
Assist [[Timeweaver Delormi|Delormi]] in repairing the Tears in Time.
* Track down a Tear in Time
* Tears in Time repaired (4)
* [[Delormi's Synchronous Thread]] (provided)

==Description==
Hm...I don't know that I've ever been to this time, before.

I suppose I should explain myself. My name is Delormi, and I'm the last remaining member of the [[Synchronous Tailors]].

We make sure the fabric of [[time]] stays, well, mended. But I've found a number of new tears cropping up.

In fact, I believe that's why I've arrived here in this time. Perhaps you could assist me in tracking them down and repairing them?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|5|85|}}
* 4,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Something strange is happening. These tears have become too frequent as of late.

==Completion==
And that takes care of those, although...Something's still wrong...

==Notes==
You do not need to leave your current area. All the rifts for this quest are located close by. They are named [[Gadgetzan Time Rift]], [[Valley of Watchers Time Rift]], [[Zul'Farrak Time Rift]], and [[Sandsorrow Watch Time Rift]].

;Quest accept
:{{Text|say|Timeweaver Delormi|There should be a rift around here somewhere. Let's hurry and repair it.}}

:{{Text|say|Timeweaver Delormi|You found one! I'll take care of this, but please watch closely.}}
:''Delormi channels a mending spell using her synchronous thread, healing the rift.''
:{{Text|say|Timeweaver Delormi|Now that you've seen how it's done, why don't you give it a try? Here, you can borrow my thread.}}
:{{Text|say|Timeweaver Delormi|I'll observe your handling of the thread and see if you have what it takes to be a synchronous tailor.}}
