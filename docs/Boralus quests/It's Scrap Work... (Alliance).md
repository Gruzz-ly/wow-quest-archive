==Objectives==
Use the Coiled Current Culler on dead [[V-300 SENTRY|V-300 SENTRIES]] at the [[Abandoned Junkheap]], then use it to collect the Ub3r-Spanner schematic from the Reinforced Schematic Cache.
* Unstable current harvested (8)
* [[Reinforced Schematic Cache]] overcharged
* [[Encrypted Ub3r-Spanner Schematic (2)]]
* [[Coiled Current Culler]] (provided)

==Description==
<Name>, I'm glad you stopped by.

The Ub3r-Spanner, capable of crafting powerful constructs, and its schematic have been lost for years. Intel tells us that its schematic is located in a locked cache in The Abandoned Junkheap.

You'll need to overcharge its electric barrier to gain access. Take my Current Culler and soak up some of the latent current from the sentries there and zap that chest open!

<Layla makes finger guns and explosion sounds>

Up for some treasure huntin'?

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find the schematic?

==Completion==
Great, let me see what it says!
