==Objectives==
Aid Zelling in retrieving the Abyssal Scepter from [[Stormsong Monastery]].
* Talk to [[Thomas Zelling|Zelling]]
* [[Key of the Sea|Begin the ritual]]
*Zelling protected
* [[Abyssal Scepter]]

==Description==
We need to retrieve the Abyssal Scepter and get out of here before the [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tirans]] break our line in [[Plunder Harbor]].

I did some research while you were gone. I believe I uncovered the location where the ritual must take place.

When you are ready to go, we can make our way over.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
[[Nathanos Blightcaller|Nathanos]] and I believe scepter will help us gain the upper hand on the [[Kul Tiran fleet]]. If you wish to win [[Fourth War|this war]], the Abyssal Scepter is key.

==Completion==
We've got the scepter... for better or for worse.
