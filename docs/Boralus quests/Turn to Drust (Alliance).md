==Objectives==
Seek out [[Kronah]] at the [[Smuggler's Cove]] in [[Drustvar]].

==Description==
There are blood scribe masters all over the place who'll teach you what you need to know. The first master I'd recommend seeking out is Kronah.

She's a bit... eccentric to say the least. One of the few [[tortollan]] who've experienced a thing or two.

She's the one who taught me the blood contract I know how to invoke!

She likes to hang out at the Smuggler's Cove on the western coast of Drustvar. Oh, and could you say hi for me when you see her?!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Kronah eyes you up and down warily.>

Say ahhh for me, would you young one?

<Kronah peers inside your mouth.>

Nice teeth you have there. Would fetch a fine price. But that's not really what you're here for, is it?

No, you're one of those who think they can handle the trials of the blood contracts, aren't you? Very well.
