==Objectives==
Return to [[Samuel D. Colton III]] in [[Boralus]] and report on your discovery.

==Description==
<Samuel will surely want to hear about your progress on this shrine.

You feel as though you should report back to him as soon as you're able.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<You recount your findings about the shrine in [[Drustvar]] to Samuel.>

How fortunate for us that the inhabitants of that area used the same rocks to create their constructs from.

I suppose luck is on our side in the quest for these shrines.

==Progression==
{{A Rocky Start (Alliance)}}
