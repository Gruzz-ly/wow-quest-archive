==Objectives==
Travel to the location marked on your map and investigate the shrine in [[Drustvar]]. Do what you can to repair the shrine, should the need arise.

==Description==
There are two more shrines here on [[Kul Tiras]].

I believe this next one resides within Drustvar, near the [[Bleak Hills Mine]], southeast of [[Corlain]].

Here are the notes on that shrine. Should it also need mending, I'm positive your skills with jewels can meet the challenge of repairing it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Inspecting the shrine, you realize that several of the gems embedded on its surface are cracked and need to be replaced.>

==Progression==
{{A Rocky Start (Alliance)}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.1.5|note=Added.}}
