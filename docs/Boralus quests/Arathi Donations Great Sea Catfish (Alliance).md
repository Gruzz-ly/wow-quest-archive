==Objectives==
Gather 40 Great Sea Catfish for [[Senedras]] in [[Boralus Harbor]].
* [[Great Sea Catfish]] (40)

==Description==
[[Fish]]--it's what's for dinner! Or so say our supply officers. And this weeks meals are based around one delicious ingredient--catfish.

If we're going to keep our allies well fed and full of fish we'll need to gather more stock and begin meal preparations soon. 

If you find yourself swimming in an abundance of catfish I'd be happy to send them along to our stores.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]
*500x [[Azerite (resource)]]

==Progress==
If we're going to keep our allies well fed and full of fish, we'll need to make sure our stockpile is ready.

If you find yourself swimming in an abundance of catfish I'd be happy to send them along to our stores.

==Completion==
Looks like the great fish feast continues.

Our allies will be delighted.
