==Objectives==
Complete the mission "Spy on Warfang Hold"
*"[[Spy on Warfang Hold]]" Started

==Description==
[[Naga]] attacks are on the rise, but that isn't all we have to deal with. We've received word of increased [[Horde]] activity near [[Warfang Hold]] in [[Stormsong Valley]].

Send some of our operatives to investigate what they are doing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hopefully we can gather information on what they're up to in Stormsong Valley.

==Completion==
Damn. Most of our [[Spy|spies]] haven't made their scheduled check-ins. Whatever the Horde is doing I doubt it bodes well for us.

==Trivia==
*Quest name is reference to the ''{{wplink|Spy vs. Spy}}'' comics.

==Progression==
{{A Gathering of Foes}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.2.5|note=Starting the mission will now complete the quest.}}
