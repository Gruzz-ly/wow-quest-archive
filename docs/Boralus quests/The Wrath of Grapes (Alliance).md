==Description==
You look familiar. Do you owe me money? Wait... no, that's not it.

If you are here to learn, I could show you my secret mining technique, bu- Ugh...

I'm a little busy trying to see straight right now. Ugh... it feels like someone is swinging a pick at my skull.

The best cure for a hangover is pickle juice, a big greasy breakfast, and whatever I did not finish last night.

Tell you what, get me those things, preferably quickly and quietly, and I will teach you whatever ya want.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Mining techniques|Mining Technique: Storm Silver Seam (Rank 3)]]

==Progress==
These shadows are loud. Can you fix that, too?

==Completion==
I needed this!

<Franklin spends several moments shoveling food into his mouth.>

Mmm... Right! If I recall correctly, you were asking about storm silver seams?

Let me tell you my secret technique, not even [[Myra Cabot|Myra]] knows. The metal is prone to stress fractures, but instead of scoring the metal where it meets the rock and breaking it off, just remove the rock.

The metal naturally forms prisms, and can be easily pulled out of the stone without wasting anything once it is loosened up.
