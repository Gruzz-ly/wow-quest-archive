==Objectives==
Return to [[Halford Wyrmbane]] on the [[Wind's Redemption]] in [[Boralus]].
*Speak to [[Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth|Jes-Tereth]]

==Description==
[[Shatterstone Harbor]] is an expansive foothold, and one that we will use to great advantage against the [[Horde]].

I will leave [[Magister Umbric|Umbric]] and the others in charge here. Let's get back to the Wind's Redemption and return to Boralus.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|7th Legionnaire's Mantle

}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* [[Glowing Azerite Crystal]] (250x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The waters outside [[Vol'dun]] are rough, but [[Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth|Jes-Tereth]] is one of the best helmsmen on the sea!

Let us roll one victory into another.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|I shall return to the Wind's Redemption. Let the Grand Admiral know when you are prepared to return to Boralus.}}
:''Halford heads downstairs.''

Speak with Jes-Tereth aboard the ship:
:This ship is yours to command, <name>. I have the crew prepared for any eventuality.

:{{gossip|Take us back to Boralus.}}

==Notes==
This concludes the "Vol'dun Foothold" of [[Ready for War]]. Wyrmbane will start [[The Ongoing Campaign (Alliance)]] to start another foothold, the [[Island Expedition (Alliance)]] intro, or [[Uniting Kul Tiras]].

==Progression==
