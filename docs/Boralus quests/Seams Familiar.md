==Objectives==
Return the Lost Necklace to [[Myra Cabot]].
* [[Lost Anchor Necklace]] (provided)

==Description==
You find a necklace in the shape of an anchor with the name "Cabot" etched in a banner.

The name immediately brings up Myra Cabot, the mining trainer in [[Boralus]].

The condition of the necklace makes it look like it has been well maintained. She probably wants it back.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Mining techniques|Mining Technique: Monelite Seam (Rank 3)]]

==Completion==
By the [[Light]]! I thought I lost it forever!

This used to belong to my great grandfather.

<Myra clutches the necklace close to her heart for a moment as a tear runs down her cheek. After a moment, she looks around, shaking her head.>

Nothing here can remotely repay this. It's not much, but I can show you how to get the most out of mining [[Monelite Ore|monelite]] seams.

<Myra spends the next several minutes explaining several techniques to increase the amount of monelite mined from a seam.>
