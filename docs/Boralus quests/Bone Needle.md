==Objectives==
Collect an Immaculate Quill.
* [[Immaculate Quill]]

==Description==
<You see [[Camilla Darksky|Camilla]] sucking blood from a wound on her hand.>

Hey, can you do me a favor? I was sewing shut a battle wound in this skin, when my last bone needle broke, and now I need to get a new one.

I've seen quilrats on the coast of [[Drustvar]], one of their spines should do the trick.

Bring me one in perfect condition, and I'll teach you how to harvest more bones when skinning.

<Camilla looks at her hand.>

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go see a healer before this gets infected.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Skinning Technique: Bone Gathering (Rank 2)]]

==Progress==
I've got a lot of work backed up, waiting on a new needle.

Have you got it yet?

==Completion==
Let's see... smooth, strong, sharp... Ow!  Very sharp!

Yeah, I think this'll do nicely.  Good job!

<Camilla picks up a skin and starts mending another hole in the skin that looks like it's from combat. 

Happy with the result, she turns to you and starts explaining how to extract additional bones when skinning.>
