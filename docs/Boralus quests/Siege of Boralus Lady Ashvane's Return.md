==Objectives==
Complete the [[Siege of Boralus]] dungeon.
* Siege of Boralus completed

==Description==
If [[Priscilla Ashvane|Ashvane]] thinks we will sit idly by as she attempts a coup, she is sorely mistaken. The citizens of [[Boralus]] will fight her to a man.

I'll need you on the front lines to aid them, <class>. Go with [[Taelia]] to the docks and engage the enemy.

With a little luck, we may just make it out of this alive.

==Rewards==
* {{cost|93|60|}}
* +350 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]
[[Radiant Azerite Core]] (750x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Completion==
That was incredible! I had no idea [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lady Jaina]] was so powerful.

==Notes==
[[File:Ashvane invasion fleet.jpg|thumb|Ready to strike.]]
While the quest is active, the Ashvane invasion fleet can be seen in [[Boralus Harbor]], ready to attack it. The [[battleship]]s and [[destroyer]]s are crewed by [[Great Sea Privateer]]s.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Taelia! Take <name> and muster the militia. Jaina and I will prepare the defenses.}}
: ''Katherine turns to Jaina.''
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|It seems our homecoming will have to wait.}}
: ''Jaina salutes.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Understood... [[Lord Admiral]].}}
: ''The Proudmoores head into the keep. Taelia turns to you.''
:{{text|say|Taelia|I'll head to the outskirts and alert the citizens. Hurry to the docks. I'll meet you there!}}
: ''She mounts [[Galeheart]] and takes off.''

If you look out into the harbor, you'll see eight pirate ships loaded with privateers: three main ships that are the same class as ''[[The Relentless]]'', and five [[transport ship]]s of the same design built by the [[garrison]] in [[Draenor (alternate universe)|alternate Draenor]].

This quest requires completing the [[Siege of Boralus]] dungeon on any difficulty (Heroic is available since patch 8.1, while previously it was Mythic-only). However, the following cinematic appears to only work on Mythic difficulty.

:{{text|yell|Lady Priscilla Ashvane|You dare scar my beautiful pet?!}}
:{{text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|You've done well, heroes, but Boralus is not out of danger yet.}}
:{{text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|Speak to me when you're ready to put an end to Ashvane's fleet.}}

Speak to Jaina.
:You've done so much for Boralus, this day, heroes. Now it's my turn.
:*{{Gossip|Finish the fight.}}
:*{{gossip|I'm ready to leave.}}

Choosing the first option plays a cinematic:
:''On the sea wall beside the great gate on an evening filled with storm clouds, Katherine and Jaina look out to sea as Lady Ashvane's fleet approaches, surrounded by their people.''
:{{text|bossemote|Katherine Proudmoore|Our harbor defenses... won't be enough.}}
:''Katherine holds up the necklace she had taken from Jaina on her arrival.''
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|Father's pendant.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Katherine Proudmoore|For generations, the heart of the Kul Tiran fleet. I thought that hope had returned with this seal. That perhaps I could call the fleet home, as your father did. I was wrong. It was never meant... for me.}}
:''Taking Jaina's hand, Katherine places the Proudmoore pendant in Jaina's palm. Holding the chain in her hand and draping the pendant in front of her fingers, Jaina closes her eyes and [[Daughter of the Sea|begins to hum her song]] as she holds out her hand toward the ocean, while ahead, Lady Ashvane's fleet approaches at high speed, cannons ready. With a look of concentration on her face as she reaches the end of the song, Jaina's eyes open.''
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|There you are.}}
:''The pendant begins to glow brightly before suddenly bursting into light and blowing wind, Jaina's irises also suddenly glowing with power, and she raises her hand to the sky. From the water, the pendant's growing light partially obscures the wall itself. The skies come alive with lightning as Lady Ashvane looks behind her, the storm clouds and ocean fog lit with arcing lighting... when with a crack of lightning and thunder, the dark shadows of the Kul Tiran fleet suddenly appear within the mist, and her eyes go wide with terror. A swift-moving [[warship]] leads the charge out of the fog and retreating clouds.''
:{{text|bossemote|Kul Tiran Sailor|We're home, Tandred! Captain, pirates in our harbor!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Tandred Proudmoore|All hands! Let's show them what Kul Tirans are made of.}}
:''From her flagship, Lady Ashvane continues to stare in shock and dismay as she realizes she's trapped - the fleet behind her, and Boralus' defenses in front. Her fleet of twelve ships suddenly looks very small in comparison.''
:{{text|bossemote|Ashvane Officer|Lady Ashvane! Your orders! Lady Ashvane!}}
:''After a moment, Ashvane's flagship raises a white flag, signaling surrender. The siege is over, and the citizens of Boralus cheer. Drained, Jaina sighs in relief as her mother steps up next to her.''
:{{text|bossemote|Katherine Proudmoore|It seems hope has returned... with you, Lord Admiral.}}
:''Smiling, Jaina and Katherine look out as the setting sun lights the harbor.''

After leaving the dungeon, turn the quest in to [[Taelia]] at the [[Harbormaster's Office]] in [[Boralus Harbor]].
