==Objectives==
Gather 2 Incendiary Ammunition for [[Norber Togglesprocket]] in [[Boralus Harbor]].
* [[Incendiary Ammunition]] (2)

==Description==
Though our ammunition stockpiles are faring well, it's my duty to find additional resources, especially those that are harder to come by.

Today I'm looking for a specific type of ammunition, one with incendiary properties. I could really use your help tracking a few of these down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]
*500x [[Azerite (resource)]]

==Progress==
Though our ammunition supplies are faring well, it's my duty to maintain a stockpile of additional resources, especially those that are harder to come by.

Would you let me know if you stumble upon munitions with incendiary properties?

==Completion==
I'll be sure to handle these with care.
