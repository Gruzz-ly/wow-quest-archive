==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Tidesage Archivist|Tidesage Archvists]]{{sic}} or [[Tidesage Summoner]]s in [[Stormsong Monastery]].
* [[Tidesages]] slain (8)

==Description==
The tidesages here have given in to dark [[magic]]s. They have submitted themselves to powers they do not understand, and my people have suffered for it.

I knew them once, my brothers and sisters in the tides. But now they are lost.

I guess I am too.

Redeem the name of the tidesages! Kill these betrayers!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
These people do not deserve to bear the name tidesage.

==Completion==
It didn't feel good to ask that of you, <name>. But it was right.
