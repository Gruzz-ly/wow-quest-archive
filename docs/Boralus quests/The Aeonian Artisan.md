==Objectives==
Meet the [[Night elf|Night Elf]] Leatherworker in [[Boralus Harbor]].

==Description==
Good day, friend!

A Night Elf woman stopped by and asked who was the best leatherworker I knew who didn't mind getting their hands dirty.

I gave her your name, and she asked me to ask you to find her in Boralus Harbor.

She didn't say what she needed my best student for, but the way she acted makes me think that it is for something big.

Head on down to the docks and look for her. She has white hair, purple tattoos, and a pet [[turtle]] named "[[Gouge (dragon turtle)|Gouge]]". Show her what I've taught you!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Elune|Goddess]] be praised!

We have much to discuss.

==Progression==
