==Objectives==
Harvest 10 Fresh Star Moss.
* [[Fresh Star Moss]] (10)

==Description==
Hey, <name>, how would you feel about doing some legwork for a favor?

We have a tradition here in [[Kul Tiras]], that during a celebration, be it funeral, wedding, or birthday, we incorporate star moss into the decorations. We do that so those who are no longer amongst the living can be here in spirit.

With the recent fighting, my stores are near empty due to the number of funerals we've had.

If you bring me fresh star moss to restock my supply, I'll share a secret on how to get more from each [[Star Moss|star moss]].

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Star Moss (Rank 2)]]

==Progress==
There was a funeral the other day, seem to be more and more as of late. Any chance you gathered that star moss I asked for?

==Completion==
I appreciate you doing this, <name>. It's been hard to get out and gather anything myself, but the war doesn't wait for me.

As for that favor, how about a secret to harvesting star moss, something no one else would teach you?

The thing about star moss is that its magic is sensitive to emotions. When you go to harvest, clear your mind and think of those you've lost. That feeling of loss, reverence, and the joy they once brought will keep the bloom from wilting. That is why we use it for celebrations.
