* +250 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
What do you have to report?

==Completion==
Heh, what's this? Haven't seen a coin like this in a long time.

Used to use these around the time of the [[Second War]]. Supplies were limited, we needed a way to trade with the locals. They used these coins, and then so did we.

Still smells like cannon powder, too. Ah, that takes me back.

Well, what are you doing still standing there? Dismissed!
