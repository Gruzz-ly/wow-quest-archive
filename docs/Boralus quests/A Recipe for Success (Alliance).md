==Objectives==
Bring the torn paper back to [[Elric Whalgrene|Elric]].

==Description==
Looking it over more closely, you're convinced that this must be the missing half of the recipe you came for.

An odd signature completes the recipe, signed, "[[Silas Darkmoon]]".

Elric should be very pleased to see this once again.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Recipe: Silas' Sphere of Transmutation]]

You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You have it?! I'm impressed you were able to get it from [[Quintin Whalgrene|Quintin]].

<Elric grabs your half of the recipe and fetches a fresh piece of parchment. He begins copying down the information and once finished, walks back to you with it in his hand.>

Here, this copy is for you. I'll make another copy for myself and keep it safe this time.

If you don't mind me saying, you've made a much better partner than Quintin ever did. It was a pleasure working with you, <name>.
