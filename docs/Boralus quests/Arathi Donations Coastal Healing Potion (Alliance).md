==Objectives==
Gather 10 Coastal Healing Potions for [[Chelsea Strand]] in [[Boralus Harbor]].
* [[Coastal Healing Potion]] (10)

==Description==
I've received word our allies are looking to stash away a few supplementary items for the battle to come. If you happen to stumble across a few Coastal Healing Potions I'd be more than happy to add them to our stores.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]
*500x [[Azerite (resource)]]

==Progress==
I don't suppose you have any healing potions to spare.

I'm trying to maintain a healthy supply for the battle to come.

==Completion==
Oh, no...

<Chelsea catches a falling potion in the palm of her hand before it hits the ground.>

That was a close one!

These wouldn't be very helpful if I dropped them, now would they?

Thanks again, <name>.
