==Objectives==
Accompany Jaina Proudmoore to [[Anglepoint Wharf]] and assist her there.
* Meet [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]] at the canal by [[Crosswind Commons]]
* Take [[Boat to Anglepoint Wharf]]

==Description==
An attack on Anglepoint Wharf can only mean one thing: the [[Horde]] seeks to destroy the seagate there.

This is my home. These are my people. I cannot turn my attention to our operations in [[Zandalar]] until we've routed the Horde.

The military will take a little time to mobilize, but in the meantime you and I can face these monsters. If we can't stop them, we can slow them down.

War has come to my shores once more. I will not stand aside.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Horde has overrun the area. We cannot let this continue.

==Completion==
As I suspected, they're trying to establish a foothold and take out the seawall.

==Notes==

:{{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|The Horde attack on [[Lord Aldrius Norwington|Norwington's]] [[Norwington Estate|place]] emboldened them. It was only a matter of time before they struck again.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|We will teach them there is a price for attacking Kul Tiras.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Mother, I need you to mobilize our infantry and medics.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|I will get them moving to Anglepoint at once, Jaina.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Tandred, take our best ships and sail out to flank them.}}
:{{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|Aye aye, Lord Admiral. Where will you be?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I will be facing the Horde head on.}}
:{{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|HA! They don't stand a chance. Give 'em hell, sister!}}
:''Katherine cautions Jaina, concerned.''
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Jaina, you should not stand alone. Take <name> and [[Taelia Fordragon|Taelia]] at the very least!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Wise counsel, mother. Champion, Taelia--with me. We'll cross [[Tiragarde Sound]]. Meet me by the canal.}}
:''Jaina teleports away and Taelia leaves the memorial at a run.''

Meet with Jaina at the top of the steps going into the water. A rowboat with three of her [[water elemental]]s, one before the bow and the others on either side of the stern, stands ready with Taelia already sitting in it. Three [[Boralus Youth]]s are fishing at the steps asking Jaina questions, with a fourth riding a [[Playful Water Elemental]] on the water.

:{{text|say|Boralus Youth|It's the Lord Admiral!}}
:{{text|say|Boralus Youth|Hi Lady Jaina! Can you do some magic for us? Can I have a water elemental?}}
:{{text|say|Boralus Youth|Momma says you do ice magic. Can we have ice cream?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I'm afraid I have to help some people right now. I'll be back later.}}

;Take Boat to Anglepoint Wharf
:''Standing on the bow, Jaina directs the elementals to swim out into the canal, and they soon rapidly pick up speed.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Taelia, what's the situation at Anglepoint? Do you think the Horde means to take out the seagate?}}
:''Taelia sounds somewhat subdued.''
:{{text|say|Taelia Fordragon|I do, ma'am. When we caught sight of the [[:Azerite]] explosives, we knew what they were planning.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia Fordragon|The [[Outriggers]] and my patrol fought hard, but the enemy was relentless. We were overwhelmed.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia Fordragon|[[Galeheart]]'s our swiftest [[gryphon]], so I was dispatched to sound the alarm.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia Fordragon|I didn't want to leave my company... but it was the only way to get the word out.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|You did the right thing, Taelia.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Sometimes... [[Thros, the Blighted Lands (quest)#Stage 3:Hide and Seek|sometimes there's no way to save everyone]].}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|But we do the best we can... and we never give up hope.}}

A few seconds from arrival:
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Get ready. We're almost there.}}
:''Leaping onto the dock, Jaina blasts what appears to be a lethal version of [[Frost Nova]] to instantly impale the [[Invading Berserker]] guards through the chest with ice. The women run forward to a group of [[Terrified Dockworker]]s surrounded by more berserkers; a second AOE takes care of them as well.''
:{{text|say|Terrified Dockworker|It's the Lord Admiral!}}
:{{text|say|Terrified Dockworker|She brought <name>!}}
:{{text|say|Terrified Dockworker|It's Lady Jaina!}}
:{{text|say|Terrified Dockworker|We're saved!}}
:''[[Okri Putterwrench]] spawns, apparently having been among the dockworkers.''
