==Objectives==
Kill 15 Freshwater Snapper
* [[Freshwater Snapper]] (15)

==Description==
The extra [[Riverbud|riverbud]] you planted has helped, but it's not enough. Some of the local wildlife are consuming the riverbud before they mature. The more riverbud that is eaten, the less we have for our own needs.

The largest group of young riverbud consumers are the turtles.

If the riverbud becomes a threatened species, we'll need to regulate harvesting it. Instead, go thin the number of the turtles in the area.

Do that and I'll teach you everything I know about riverbud.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Riverbud (Rank 3)]]

==Progress==
I regret that it's come to this, but things will get much worse if we don't act now.

==Completion==
Good work, <name>. I can sleep soundly now that those turtles won't be gobbling up all of our precious riverbud.

If I recall correctly, I offered to teach you how to collect riverbud more effectively as thanks for you doing your part.

Well, the secret to riverbud is that there are a couple extra bulbs in the root system. Just pull it by the coil firmly with steady pressure.
