==Objectives==
Stop [[Uu'nat]] within the [[Crucible of Storms]].
* Defeat Uu'nat in the Crucible of Storms Raid

==Description==
Your intention to stop the [[naga]] attacks was noble, <name>. But [[Xal'atath|that shadowy dagger]] tricked you into delivering powerful relics into the hands of a great enemy.

No doubt those artifacts will be well defended. Gather your allies, <class>, and return to the Crucible of Storms.

Defeat any opponents that stand in your way. Ensure the relics cannot be used against the [[Alliance]].

The naga cannot be allowed to summon their storm... or to call forth something even worse. 

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|Radiant Azerite Matrix
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|93|60|}}
* 35,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
[[Kul Tiras]] and the Alliance face grave peril.

==Completion==
I am pleased that you defeated [[N'Zoth]]'s minions, <name>. But I feel in my bones that this danger is far from over.

Remain on your guard, champion. Once an [[Old God]] fixes his gaze upon you, dark times are sure to follow.

==Progression==
{{The Azsharan Medallion}}
