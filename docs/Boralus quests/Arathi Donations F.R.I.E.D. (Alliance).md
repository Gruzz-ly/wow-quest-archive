==Objectives==
Gather 3 F.R.I.E.D. for [[Norber Togglesprocket]] in [[Boralus Harbor]].
* [[F.R.I.E.D.]] (3)

==Description==
You never know when you'll need to deliver a big bang on the battlefield, if you know what I mean. Luckily we can plan for the unexpected!

We've begun to store a special stockpile of explosives for scenarios where we'll need a little something extra to get our point across. I've added one particular item to the list. 

If you have any to spare I'll make sure they're put to good use.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]
*500x [[Azerite (resource)]]

==Progress==
We've started a special stockpile of explosives for scenarios where we'll need a little something extra to get our point across. I've added one particular item to the list.

If you have any to spare I'll make sure they're put to good use.

==Completion==
What a find!

I'll make sure these are handled with care.
