==Objectives==
Defeat [[King Rastakhan]] in the Battle of Dazar'alor raid.
* Defeat [[King Rastakhan (tactics)|King Rastakhan]] in the [[Battle of Dazar'alor (instance)|Battle of Dazar'alor]]

==Description==
Our naval forces are ready to sail for [[Zuldazar]]. By the time we're there, the [[Horde]] and [[Zandalari]] forces should be in [[Nazmir]].

[[John J. Keeshan|Keeshan]] and [[Kelsey Steelspark|Kelsey]] checked on the bombs placed within [[Port of Zandalar|Zuldazar harbor]]. They're primed and ready to destroy the [[Golden Fleet|Zandalari fleet]].

Gather any of your allies and prepare to set sail for Zuldazar.

We will strike down the Zandalari and remove the Horde's most powerful ally from [[Fourth War|this war]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|93|60|}}
* 35,700 [[XP]]
*[[Humming Azerite Heart]] (2,000 [[Azerite (resource)]])
* +2,000 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
We must move, there is no more time.

==Completion==
We have achieved victory, but at a grave cost. [[Gelbin Mekkatorque|Mekkatorque]] is dead, frozen within a device from his mech.

[[Jaina Proudmoore|Lady Jaina]] is being tended to by our best [[healer]]s. She is badly wounded, but should survive.

As for [[Blademaster Telaamon|Telaamon]]... our [[scout]]s found his body torn to shreds. Every last [[soldier]] sent to Nazmir was killed.

But we did it. The Zandalari fleet is decimated, and King Rastakhan is dead.

Our war with the Horde is almost over. [[Anduin Wrynn|King Anduin]] will wish to speak with us soon.

==Notes==
*In LFR, the raid is split into three sections: Siege of Dazar'alor, Empire's Fall, and Might of the Alliance. Rastakhan is the 'final' boss of the Alliance-side story, Empire's Fall. You can complete this section for turn in, but be aware that story-wise, the quest assumes that you went through the entire raid, including the Horde-side story, Might of the Alliance.

;Complete
