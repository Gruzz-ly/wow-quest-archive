==Objectives==
Meet [[Mimiron]] at the [[Inventor's Library]] in the [[Storm Peaks]].

==Description==
;Boralus
<Name>, I have wondrous news!

A recent energy signature tripped several detection relays I installed after that [[Silithus: The Wound|unfortunate incident]] with [[Sargeras]].

I require further data to know for certain, but initial diagnostics suggest that these energies are coming from [[Hati]]! We might still be able to save him!

Hati's [[Ghost|spirit]] is still bound to your own, so I'll need your help. Meet me at my library in the Storm Peaks right away!

;Dazar'alor
<Name>, I require your assistance.

A recent energy signature tripped several detection relays I installed after that unfortunate incident with Sargeras.

Initial diagnostics suggest that these energies emanate from Hati, a legendary creature of lightning [[magic]]. This [[wolf]] was linked to the [[Titanstrike]] artifact, a weapon that proved instrumental in defeating the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]!

Hati's spirit is still bound to Titanstrike's core, so I'll need your help. Meet me at my library in the Storm Peaks right away!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Our scientific team simply would not be complete without Bronzebeard here.

Let's begin!
