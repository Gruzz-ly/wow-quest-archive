==Description==
Hello, <name>.

She has so much to offer those who feel lost, those seeking a better way. Once she is free of doubt, she will know what must be done.

Will you join me?

==Completion==
My death seems to have given me a new purpose.

==Notes==
Return to [[Seabreeze Village]] in [[Stormsong Valley]].
