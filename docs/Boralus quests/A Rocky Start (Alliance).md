==Objectives==
Bring the book to [[Zooey Inksprocket]] and see if she can translate the text.
* [[Ancient Journal]]

==Description==
<As you thumb through the book, the pages are unusually thick and embedded on their surface are runic-shaped jewels. [[Samuel D. Colton III|Samuel Colton]] notices you looking and approaches.>

Ah, now that's a treasure I've had for many years. Beautiful, isn't it? No clue what it says, but I've always reveled at the thought of something being transcribed in jewels.

Come to think of it, I wonder if Zooey Inksprocket would be able to decipher it. Say, <name>, would you mind taking it over to her and see if she can translate it?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Y-yes? Can I help you?

<You hand the book over to Zooey and ask for it to be translated. As she turns each page, wondrous expressions cross the scribe's face.>

Oh my, I've only ever heard of such books in existence but have never seen one up close. Do you know what this is?

It's ancient earthen. And this book must be centuries old!

Of course I'll help translate it! Only... well... my ancient earthen isn't so great. I'll need some reference materials.
