==Objectives==
Bring the Enormous Anchor Pod to [[Declan Senal]].
*[[Enormous Anchor Pod]] (provided)

==Description==
In all the gathering you've done, you have never come across an [[Anchor Weed|anchor pod]] of this size. Whatever the reason that it has gotten so large, there is much that can be learned from it.

Your mind wanders back to [[Declan Senal|Declan]], and if there is anything about it in the [[A Treatise on Anchor Weed|book]] you picked up earlier.

==Completion==
Oh dear... This certainly appears larger than usual. Even the book does not have anything on a giant seed pod. This could be bad...
