==Objectives==
Retrieve the Tol Dagor Master Key from Overseer Korgus.
* [[Tol Dagor Master Key]]
* [[Overseer Korgus]] slain

==Description==
[[Tol Dagor]] stands as a well fortified thorn in this nation's side.

As you are no doubt aware, [[Priscilla Ashvane|Ashvane]] has taken every opportunity she could to throw any opposition into those cells. Among those in the jail are members of the [[Alliance]] that arrived alongside you and [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]].

We now have permission and the needed muscle to free them. Meet up with [[Taelia]] on the eastern shore of the island, find the overseer, and take his key. With it, we will have access to the weapon vault and cells.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|131|65|}} (at lvl 120)
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (600x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* +350 reputation with [[Proudmoore Admiralty]]

==Progress==
Well?

==Completion==
Most of those hostages have seen better days, but they will recover quickly. With Tol Dagor out of the way, Ashvane is quickly running out of places to hide.

==Progression==
