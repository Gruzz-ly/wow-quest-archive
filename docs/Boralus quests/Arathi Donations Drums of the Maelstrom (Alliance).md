==Objectives==
Donate 2 Drums of the Maelstrom to [[Charlane]] in [[Boralus Harbor]].
*[[Drums of the Maelstrom]] (2)

You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]
*500x [[Azerite (resource)]]

==Progress==
In battle, those who are victorious march to the beat of the same drum.

What say we provide our allies with a little drumming of our own?

==Completion==
Finely crafted, taught hide... is this bone? This work is quite masterful.

I'll make sure these are put to good use.
