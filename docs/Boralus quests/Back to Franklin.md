==Objectives==
Speak with [[Franklin The Drunk]].

==Description==
Oh, good! You are still here!

I heard you had built a rapport with Franklin. I'd be lying if I said talking about him didn't make me reminisce when we worked together.

If you're not busy, could you go talk to him? Ask him if he can show you anything else. I'm sure he remembers more, if you're still looking for more information.

And tell him that if he were to get his life sorted out, I'd like to talk to him about working together again.

==Completion==
Myra sent you?

Wait... my old business partner?
