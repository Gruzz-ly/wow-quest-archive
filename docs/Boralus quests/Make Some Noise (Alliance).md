==Objectives==
Craft 6 Drums of Primal Might.
* Talk to [[Daniss Ghostdancer|Daniss]] to begin the ritual
* [[Drum of Primal Might]] (6)

==Description==
We have everything we need to craft the drum, except [[Elune]]'s blessing. 

The drum is but a vessel, like a cup. We need her to imbue the drum with power, filling the cup so that we may drink.

With [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande]] donning the mantle of the [[Elune#Night Warrior|Night Warrior]], much of Elune's power is taxed. Asking for another favor is not insignificant, but I must try.

While I'm doing that, I need you to craft the drum. Try to keep it small. The larger the vessel, the more power it can hold, but the harder it becomes to move.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Clearly exhausted, Daniss is trying to remain composed.>

==Completion==
<Daniss lets out a beleaguered breath, before turning to face you, smiling weakly.>

We did it, <name>.

They may have called me "[[Darnassian#Darnassian primer (official translations)|T'lara]]", a warrior armed only with words, but those words have given us the strength of a goddess.

With these drums, we can break the [[Horde]].

==Notes==
Speak with Daniss to begin the ritual.
:{{Gossip|Begin the ritual.}}

You will be given the training recipe to make the drums, while Daniss walks over to the side to lay out the materials: a Bucket of Hides, a Pail of Scales and a Crate of Bones, and kneels in prayer.
:{{Text|say|Daniss Ghostdancer|Elune, hear my plea...}}
:{{Text|say|Daniss Ghostdancer|Please fill these instruments with your blessings...}}
:{{Text|say|Daniss Ghostdancer|Allow us to bask in your glory, so we may protect your children.}}

Loot the [[Supple Hides]], [[Cleaned Brilliant Scales]], and [[Etched Bones]] in order to craft the drums.
