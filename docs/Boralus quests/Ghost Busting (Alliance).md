==Objectives==
Put the [[Angry Spirit (Boralus)|Angry Spirit]] to rest.
* Summon Angry Spirit
* Angry Spirit put to rest
* [[Smoldering Bundle of Star Moss]] (provided)

==Description==
I hate to ask this of you, but are you available for some more grunt work? I'd do it myself, but this seems beyond my capabilities.

Remember how I told you we use [[Star Moss|star moss]] to allow those no longer living to join us for a special day?

Yeah, well, sometimes once they show up, they don't want to leave. There is a spirit on the other side that is lashing out, harming those it should be protecting.

Take this smoldering star moss and cleanse the area until you find the offender and help them move on.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Star Moss (Rank 3)]]

==Progress==
Have you banished the spirit yet?

==Completion==
I can't thank you enough, <name>. Now that the spirit has been been put to rest, I'll send word to the family so they can get back to their normal lives.

Once again, you've proved that I can rely on you. If you swear to tell no one, I'll tell you the best kept secret of star moss.

This is going to sound crazy, but engage it. Talk to it, sing, hum, anything. I'm not sure why, but since I started I've noticed one or two extra flowers will bloom before my eyes!
