==Objectives==
Speak with [[Yvera Dawnwing]] to return to [[Boralus]].

==Description==
That should just about do it for now, then. We'll be in touch if the fighting heats back up again. No doubt it'll be any day now.

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following: Warfront: The [[Battle for Stromgarde]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You're all caught up? Excellent.

Holding a firm line in [[Arathi Highlands|Arathi]] is critical to the [[Alliance]]'s continued occupation of [[Lordaeron]]. We appreciate your support, both now and in the inevitable upcoming battle.

==Notes==
Back to where the port dropped players off, on the east side of [[Stromgarde Keep]]. Speak with Yvera:

{{Dialogue|
Greetings, <class>. Do you wish to return to Boralus?

{{gossip|Send me to Boralus!}}
}}

Yvera also offers a handful of quests while the Alliance has control, shown in the one-offs section below.
