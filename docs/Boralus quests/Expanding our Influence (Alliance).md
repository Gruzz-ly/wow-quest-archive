==Objectives==
Talk to [[Vindicator Jaelaana]].

==Description==
As we expand the War Effort on the enemy continent we are finding ideal locations to establish new outposts, and even upgrade our current ones.

Once secure, these outposts will allow us to utilize a new flight network to quickly and easily navigate the area.

==Completion==
I have many Scouting Reports and Outpost Upgrades available for you to purchase. These will allow you to unlock new outposts, flight paths and upgrades on both continents.

Once you have chosen a Scouting Report or Outpost Upgrade, use your Mission Command Table and instruct your troops to complete the mission.
