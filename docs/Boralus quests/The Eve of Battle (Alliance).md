:''[[Anduin Wrynn]], accompanied by [[Valeera Sanguinar]] and [[Master Mathias Shaw]], rides through [[Dustwallow Marsh]] to a watchtower answering a letter from Saurfang...''
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|Anduin. Sylvanas' actions have threatened us all and day by day, her power grows.}}
:''Anduin dismounts [[Reverence]] outside a ruined watchtower, where he is greeted by [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]] and [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]].''
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|If our world is to survive we must strike while we still can. Meet with me and we will speak.}}
:''Anduin ascends the ruined tower to meet with Saurfang, looking out at the encampment of Horde soldiers following him.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|So few...}}
:''Saurfang gives a slight grunt of agreement.''
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|How many can you provide?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Enough for one final assault. If that fails... we're done.}}
:''Anduin looks up at Saurfang.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|If we end her reign, what kind of warchief will you be?}}
:''Saurfang holds the necklace of [[Dranosh Saurfang|his fallen son]] in his hand.''
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|The [[Old Horde|Horde]] I joined was birthed in blood. Tainted by [[Fel|corruption]]. The road that led to the [[Dark Portal]] was long and wide paved with the bones of [[draenei|innocents]]. We called it the [[Path of Glory]].}}
:''Saurfang pounds his hand against the stone.''
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|That was the great lie upon which the Horde was founded... that anything we did was honorable. [[Thrall]], [[Vol'jin]]... they were not the true heirs to [[Blackhand]]'s bloody legacy. Sylvanas Windrunner is.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|No. No, this is the Horde. Led by you. Someone who has...}}
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|Honor...}}
:''Saurfang snorts in derision.''
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|I've never known honor. They deserve more. But the Horde is doomed to be shackled by the chains of the past.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|The Horde has no exclusive claim to regrets. [[Arthas Menethil|Arthas]], [[Daelin Proudmoore|Daelin]]... The ghosts of the past haunt us as well.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|We could not fill the chasm between the Horde and Alliance if we labored 1000 years. You know this.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Then what are we fighting for?}}
:''Saurfang is silent as he heads down outside the tower, Anduin following him. As he exits the tower, he grabs his axe.''
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|Soldiers! On your feet!}}
:''The Horde troops stand, including Lor'themar, Thalyssra, Thrall, and [[Rexxar]].''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Start breaking camp immediately!}}
:''[[Zekhan]] looks up at Saurfang questioningly.''
:{{text|bossemote|Zekhan|Lord Saurfang?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|Zekhan... Where is our home?}}
:''Zekhan thinks for a moment.''
:{{text|bossemote|Zekhan|[[Orgrimmar]]?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|Not our city. Our home.}}
:''Saurfang puts a hand on the young troll's shoulder. Zekhan realizes what he is asking.''
:{{text|bossemote|Zekhan|Azeroth.}}
:''Anduin turns to Jaina.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|And ours?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|Azeroth.}}
:''Anduin raises his voice so all can hear him.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Right now, there are only two forces in this world that matter. One bent on harming our world.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|And one that will protect her.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Zekhan|So... what are we doing?}}
:''Saurfang glances at Anduin with a smile.''
:{{text|bossemote|Varok Saurfang|Breaking the cycle.}}

Speak with the [[7th Legion Magus]]:
:I can teleport you to Razor Hill when you are ready.

:{{gossip|Teleport me to Razor Hill.}}

:''You find yourself at [[Razor Hill]] behind an assemblage of soldiers: troops of [[Darnassian Archer (Durotar)|Darnassian Archers]], [[Dwarven Rifleman (Durotar)|Dwarven Riflemen]], [[High Overlord's Raider]]s, and [[Stormwind Knight (Durotar)|Stormwind Knights]] surround a [[7th Legion Siege Tank]] and its accompanying [[7th Legion Engineer (Durotar)|7th Legion Engineer]]. They all face north, toward [[Orgrimmar]]. [[Alliance Guard (Durotar)|Alliance Guards]] and [[Overlord's Guard]]s patrol the area, and all of the town's usual residents are friendly.''
:''Enter the [[Razor Hill Barracks|barracks]] to your right and speak with [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]].
