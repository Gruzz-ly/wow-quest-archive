==Objectives==
Search the [[Ashvane Offices]] for information on where [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]] was taken.
* Ashvane Offices searched {{co|53.5|35.5|Boralus}}
* [[Emery Camden]] slain {{co|53.5|34.9|Boralus}}
* Speak to [[Katherine Proudmoore]] {{co|67.0|36.2|Boralus}}

==Description==
I let grief cloud my judgment and Jaina may have already paid the ultimate price for my mistake. Yet, I hold out hope she lives.

I do not know where Jaina was taken after Ashvane's people took her from the Keep. The records in their offices here in [[Boralus]] will surely tell you where they took her.

<Name>, you helped my people when I thought I did not need it. I ask for your help again now. Save my daughter's life!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* [[Glowing Azerite]] (300x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 22,310 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find what happened to Jaina?

==Completion==
<Katherine looks up, resolved.>

We have little to go on, but I must believe she still lives.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Return to me as soon as you discover where Jaina was taken, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|[[Genn Greymane]]|<Name> is one of the finest champions of the [[Alliance]], Katherine. If anyone will be able to recover Jaina it will be them.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|I hope you are right, Genn.}}

Enter [[Priscilla's Parlor]] at the [[Ashvane Docks]] to find a box of [[Shipping Contracts]] on the table. Interact with it and Emery Camden spawns:
:{{text|say|Emery Camden|What do we have here? Looks like an account that needs to be settled!}}

Take him out:
:{{text|say|Emery Camden|Heh... The only certain things. Taxes and...}}

He drops the [[Shipping Contract]], but it can also be safely deleted.

Return to Katherine:
:I must keep hope. Jaina may yet live.
:{{gossip|I found this clue in Ashvane's offices.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Time is running out, and all we have to go on is a contract that Priscilla made with some brigands out of [[Freehold]]!}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|She hired [[pirate]]s to execute my daughter, Genn! Pirates! The scum of the sea!}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|Think about this, Katherine. It may actually be good news.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|How can you possibly believe that?}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|The contract was to move Jaina somewhere, not to kill her outright.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|Perhaps they have yet to arrive at their destination, Katherine. You may not be too late.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|I... You may be right, Genn. But even if that's true, we are left with scant clues to work from.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|If the pirates sailed out of Freehold, we may find more information there. And I think I know someone who can help us.}}
