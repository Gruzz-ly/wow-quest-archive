==Objectives==
Use the Kul Tiran Orphan Whistle to call for the [[Liam (child)|ward]] that you will be looking after during [[Children's Week]].
* [[Kul Tiran Orphan Whistle]]

==Description==
Thank you for coming by to celebrate Children's Week, <class>. You are going to make one little boy very happy!

Take this whistle. With it, you will be able to call for the child you have agreed to take care of this week. It will serve no use after Children's Week ends, as is custom.

When you are ready, use the whistle and meet your new ward! I know he is ecstatic to meet you.

==Completion==
Whoa, are you a <class>? That's amazing! My name's Liam!

I'm so, so excited to leave the [[Boralus|city]]. I haven't been outside the gates since I was really little.

[[Orphan Matron Westerson|Miss Westerson]] says that we should think about what we want to be when we grow up, but how can I choose when there are so many cool things you can be?!

Can you take me to meet people I've heard stories of? I think meeting grown ups like you might help me decide!
