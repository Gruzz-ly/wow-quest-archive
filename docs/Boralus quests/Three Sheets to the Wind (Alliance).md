==Objectives==
Bring Franklin The Drunk a drink he likes to learn his mining secrets.
* Give [[Franklin The Drunk]] his favorite drink

==Description==
Hey, <name>. Now isn't a great time for me.

If you're interested in learning, you could talk to Franklin, my old apprentice. He used to be a damn fine miner, but now he's just a washed up drunk. You can find him asleep on the docks.

I don't remember what he drinks, but if you bring him something he's sure to at least try it. He'll talk if he likes it.

Talk to [[Harold Atkey]], the bartender, he's{{sic}} sells a variety of drinks, I'm sure one of them is his choice.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Mining techniques|Mining Technique: Storm Silver Seam (Rank 2)]]

==Progress==
<Myra's former apprentice, Franklin drunkenly stares at you.>

I ain't talkin... 'less you got a drink.

==Completion==
<Franklin rambles almost incoherently, explaining the mechanics of mining storm silver from a seam>

... and that is how you... get the most of mining... Zzz...

<As Franklin drifts to sleep amidst a pungent cloud of alcohol vapors, you think of the advice he provided.

Eager to experiment with your new mining technique, you leave the sleeping man laying where he is.>
