'''Time to Fly''' is automatically received the first time a player visits [[Boralus]] with an Alliance character that meets the quest's level requirement.

==Objectives==
Find [[Leila Stafford]].

==Description==
[[Kul Tiras]] is home to many [[gryphon]]s. One will accompany you into the skies.

Visit Leila Stafford at the [[Tradewinds Market]] in [[Boralus]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|62|50}}
* 1,050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm glad you came. This young gryphon was left behind when the rest were sent for training. I didn't think I would ever see this day, but it is now ready to fly.

Will you take it and fly around [[Azeroth|the world]] for me? May it bring you good fortune in your journey.
