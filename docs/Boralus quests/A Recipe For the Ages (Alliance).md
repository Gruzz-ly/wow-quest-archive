==Objectives==
Bring [[Grix "Ironfists" Barlow|Grix Barlow]] back 30 pieces of Revlis Ore from [[Gol Koval]] in [[Drustvar]].
* [[Revlis Ore]] (30)

==Description==
Yo, <name>, over here! You've look like you've been hammering away for a while. I can smell the flux on ya!

<Grix gives you a wide grin.>

Listen, I've got a recipe for the most amazing blacksmith hammer you've ever laid your eyes on. And I'd be willing to let it go for a bit of ore.

Revlis ore to be exact. It's a little rare, but you can find plenty of it over in Gol Koval in Drustvar. The [[elemental]]s there are practically made of it.

Bring me back a haul of it, and the recipe's yours!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This recipe is probably worth a thousand, no TEN thousand gold! Blacksmiths all over will be envious of you, you'll see.

==Completion==
Yea, yea! That's the stuff!

Here's your recipe, have fun with it.
