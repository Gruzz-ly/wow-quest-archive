==Objectives==
Gather 10 Highlands Mauler Eyes and return them to [[Elric Whalgrene|Elric]].
* [[Highlands Mauler Eye]] (10)

==Description==
My next idea involves a creature whose eyes are useful for certain alchemical recipes. At least for potions they are.

Hopefully they're just what we need for this and there aren't any further... miscalculations. Although, I don't entirely recall seeing them on the recipe's ingredient list... but my memory isn't exactly as good as it used to be.

Oh, you caught me rambling. How about you get those eyes and I'll start making the preparations for them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Oh, I do hope you gathered the eyes post mortem. Those creatures make the most awful sound if you try to extract them while they're still alive.

==Completion==
Very good. These should be plenty!

==Progression==
{{A Recipe for Success}}
