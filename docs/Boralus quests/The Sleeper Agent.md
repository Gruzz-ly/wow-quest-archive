==Objectives==
Report back to [[Halford Wyrmbane]] in [[Boralus Harbor]].

==Description==
Your work here is done, <name>. [[Morton Cogswald|Morton]] and [[Megs]] can take it from here.

Head back to [[Boralus]] and let Halford know we've secured the weapon. 

Don't you worry one wink about [[Grong]]. Morton and Megs will make sure he's well looked after.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,800 [[XP]]
* +2,000 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Completion==
Are you certain about this? Our secret weapon is a [[gorilla]]? 

I suppose I'll just have to trust that the [[gnome]]s know what they're doing. 

Thank you for your report, <name>.
