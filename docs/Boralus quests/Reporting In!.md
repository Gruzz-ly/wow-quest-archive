==Objectives==
Report to [[Halford Wyrmbane]] in [[Boralus]].
* Reported in
* [[A Decrypted Letter from Ashvane]] (provided)

==Description==
Well it looks like [[Priscilla Ashvane|Ashvane]]'s been out of contact for some time but this 'Patron' thing could be a problem.

You did excellent work today, <name>. Those [[Ashvane Trading Company|Loyalists]] aren't going to be thinking about causing trouble for awhile, heh.

I'll make my way back. You take the letter to the High Commander.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find anything on Ashvane?

==Completion==
<Wyrmbane gestures to the letter>

If this was Ashvane's last communication, perhaps her meeting with this mysterious "patron" of hers did not go as she planned.

We'll keep an eye on this. In the meantime, perhaps you'd better speak with our... guest.

==Notes==
Back on the ''[[Wind's Redemption]]'', [[Mathias Shaw]] and [[Jaina Proudmoore]] are gathered by the Zandalar Campaign table.

;Reported in
The [[7th Legion]] represents the best that [[Azeroth]] has to offer.

For the [[Alliance]]!

{{gossip|Reporting in, High Commander. I found this letter from Lady Ashvane.}}

:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I knew Ashvane was treacherous, but siding with the [[Horde]] is a new low.}}
:{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Ambition has a way of twisting... wait. We are not alone.}}
:{{text|yell|Master Mathias Shaw|Show yourself!}}
: ''From the end of the east boarding ramp support, a crouched [[Valeera Sanguinar]] leaps into the air and lands gracefully on the deck in a kneel beside the table. She stands as she comes out of stealth and politely applauds, sounding pleasantly impressed.''
:{{text|say|Valeera Sanguinar|Hmm... Not bad, Shaw.}}
: ''Mathias responds in a weary and somewhat exasperated manner.''
:{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Everyone, stand down! Explain why you're here, Valeera. Now.}}
:{{text|say|Valeera Sanguinar|I have a message for the [[Lord Admiral]].}}
: ''Jaina is a little wary.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Can we trust her?}}
:{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|[[Varian Wrynn|King Varian]] did.}}
: ''Jaina relaxes a bit.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I see. Then I will hear what she has to say.}}
