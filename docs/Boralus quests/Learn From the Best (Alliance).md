==Objectives==
Drink [[Declan Senal|Declan]]'s potion and allow bees to harvest your pollen.
* Pollen Harvested
* [[Declan's Potion of Plant Shape]] (provided)

==Description==
You want to learn how these [[bee]]s are so good at harvesting pollen, but if you show up, they'll start swarming you.

What you've got is a problem that can be solved with a little [[alchemy]]. I just so happen to have this potion that, once drunk, will turn the imbiber into a plant.

Here's the deal: you go out and drink the potion, and you'll see firsthand how the bees do what they do. After the potion wears off, you tell me what happened.

Oh, and don't ask why I have that potion on me.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Siren's Pollen (Rank 2)]]

==Progress==
Back already? Have you learned anything from the bees?

==Completion==
Fascinating!  It sounds like they used their bodies to block the mouth of the flower and beat their wings to stir up the pollen.

With the pollen being trapped inside the flower, it has no where to go but to get stuck on the bee.

Hmm, next time you've got a [[Siren's Pollen|siren sting]], try placing your hand over most of the mouth of the flower and gently blowing into it. That might replicate what the bees were doing.
