==Objectives==
Kill 8 Enthralled Mossfangs and 15 Mossfang Egg.
* [[Enthralled Mossfang]] slain (8)
* [[Mossfang Egg]] slain (15)

==Description==
You're no stranger to monster fighting, right?

The other day I found a [[spider]] just outside my house. Nothing out of the ordinary, except it was the SIZE OF A [[Horse|HORSE]]!

Twenty-five minutes of screaming and pick-axeing later and I had managed to kill it.

I spoke with one of the guards, and he said that there was a huge nest of them just over the hill to the northwest.

If you can slay them or whatever you do, I'll teach you a secret to mining [[Monelite Ore|monelite]]. Otherwise, I'm going to have to move.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Mining techniques|Mining Technique: Monelite Deposit (Rank 3)]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
I'm glad to see you made it back in one piece. I'm tempted to ask how it went, but frankly, thinking about it has been causing me quite a bit of anxiety.

If you don't mind, I'm going to distract myself from the thought with a lesson.

You've probably noticed that monelite is really maleable, right? You can use that, even before smelting it.

By using your pick to deform the metal while it's still in the vein, you can heat it up and get a bigger haul using the other technique I taught you.
