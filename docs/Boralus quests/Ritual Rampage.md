==Completion==
I read Magister Umbric's report... It sounded like quite an impressive display over there. The Horde must know now that we can control powers far beyond theirs.

==Notes==
;Intro

:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|This is Zuldazar, the crown jewel of the Zandalari empire. Attack while they are unprepared and decimate the Horde's newest allies.}}

;Four objectives completed
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|We have struck at their army, but we must cut deeper to truly wound them. Assist Magister Umbric as he prepares a ritual for exactly that purpose.}}

;Speaking with Umbric
Our preparations are complete, <name>. The ritual is ready.<br>
Our enchantments on these bones should be sufficient for us to unleash its powers on the Horde, but we must move quickly. Are you ready to begin?

{{Gossip|I am ready.}}
:''Umbric casts Guide the Void.''
:{{Text|say|Magister Umbric|The Void makes for a dangerous ally, and a deadly foe. We must make use of this creature before its strength eclipses our own.}}

The player controls [[Great Xonac]]. Speaking with Umbric shows final gossip:
:It is done. The Void has its vessel, and now it wishes to feed.

:We can use this power to our advantage. Go forth and destroy the Horde, but do it quickly! We can only hold the ritual for so long...

[[Great Xonac]] with three abilities:
#{{Abilities|Engulfing Breath|id=289480|The Void surges from its vessel, dealing massive Shadow damage to all enemies in front of the caster within 30 yds.|icon=spell_fire_twilightflamebreath}}
#{{Abilities|Mind-Shattering Roar|id=287507|Unleash an earthshaking roar, horrifying enemies within 30 yards for 4 sec.|icon=spell_shadow_deathsembrace}}
#{{Abilities|Unnatural Surge|id=287511|The Void rushes forward hungrily, increasing movement speed and trampling enemies underfoot.|icon=ability_hunter_beastmastery}}
#{{Abilities|Devouring Maw|id=287509|The [[Void]] erupts from its vessel, seeking to feast on new flesh. Increases Leech by 20%.|icon=inv_armoredraptorundead}}

Move up to [[Predator Pass]] and the [[Feeding Grounds]] and kill [[Apprentice Beastcaller]]s and [[Beastcaller Guardian]]s to fill up the bar. Then continue to the final target in [[Warbeast Kraal]].

:{{Text|say|Magister Umbric|You have done it! I will break the ritual. One must always use caution when consorting with powers such as these.}}
