==Objectives==
Ride [[Swiftwing]] to accompany [[Falstad Wildhammer|Falstad]] and [[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris]] to the [[Great Sea]].
* Mount Swiftwing {{co|69.7|27.6|Boralus}}
* Locate Horde ships

==Description==
Between the information I gathered from my scouting mission and [[Mathias Shaw|Mathias Shaw's]] intel, we know exactly where [[Blood Prince Dreven]] is going to be.

We will have our revenge, <name>. For ourselves, for my sisters, for the Alliance.

We won't underestimate the san'layn this time. We will keep the [[Horde]] off-balance and distracted with swift, targeted, ruthless attacks.

Thankfully, the [[Wildhammer clan|Wildhammer]] are masters of those combat tactics. I'm glad they'll be joining us.

Are you ready to leave?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,930 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
Our strikes will be swift and true. The san'layn will fall.

==Completion==
The foul weather offers us some cover. Every thick cloud and raindrop is an ally.

<Shandris Feathermoon smirks.>

In that sense, we actually outnumber the Horde. They don't stand a chance.

==Notes==

:{{text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|There they are, General. Two battleships straight ahead. [[Forsaken]].}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Not too close yet. I want to observe and formulate a plan before they know we're here.}}
:{{text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|Aye. Wildhammers, stow yer [[stormhammer]]s and maintain a holding pattern until I give the word.}}
: ''The group flies a simple racetrack oval behind the ships.''
