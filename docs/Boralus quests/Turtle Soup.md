==Objectives==
Loot 5 Sulphur Speckled Skins from [[Enriched Rockshell]]s.
* [[Sulphur Speckled Turtle Skin]] (5)

==Description==
I cannot believe that I'm constantly stuck in [[Boralus|this city]]!

You'd help me out, right?

You see, I've heard about these [[turtle]]s that have been living in hot springs.

What makes it interesting is that some of the sulphur from the water has soaked into their scales to give them interesting patterns.

I'm too busy to go check myself, but if you could go get me some of their skins, I'd be more than willing to teach you everything else I know about skinning anything with scales in exchange.

==Rewards==
You will learn: Skinning Technique: Scale Gathering (Rank 3)

==Progress==
Please tell me you've got the skins.

==Completion==
Wow, these are... underwhelming.

From they{{sic}} way they were described, I figured they would be irridescent{{sic}} or something.

Instead, they're just yellow and smell of farts.

Regardless, you've kept me from losing my sanity for one more day.

<Camilla deftly draws her skinning knife and begins weaving it along and between scales.

While her finesse may be without equal, you feel the demonstration is more than enough to ensure you can harvest more scales.>
