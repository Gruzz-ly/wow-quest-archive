==Objectives==
Acquire the Letter from the [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lord Admiral]] and meet [[Cyrus Crestfall]] in [[Brennadam]].
*[[Letter from the Lord Admiral]]
* Meet Cyrus Crestfall in Brennadam.

==Description==
Now I am starting to remember...

[[Dorian Atwater]] was a very secretive builder. Their slips were famously warded against prying eyes until the vessel was complete. It made something of a stir any time one of their works was revealed.

Last I heard, they retired in [[Stormsong Valley]]. I am not certain how reliable that information is.

Hm. We should head to [[Brennadam]]. It is a crossroads of sorts. If anyone knows where to find our shipwright, they will be there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You've got that letter? I have a feeling we'll be needing it before long.

==Completion==
Right. Let's get started.

==Notes==
On accepting this quest:
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|I can help you in your search, but what if our mysterious shipwright refuses your request?}}
: ''Jaina produces a rolled-up piece of paper in her left hand.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I have prepared [[Letter from the Lord Admiral|a letter]] in case some persuasion is required. I suggest you take it with you.}}
:''Cyrus salutes, then heads toward the stairs.''
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|Aye aye, Lord Admiral. Come, <name>. We'll start in [[Stormsong Valley]], where we build every ship in the [[Kul Tiran fleet|fleet]].}}

Speak to [[Jaina]]:
:<Lady Jaina Proudmoore offers you a folded letter.>
:You may read it, if you wish. It is a touch sentimental but nothing terribly private.
::{{gossip|<Take the letter.>}}

On approaching Cyrus in [[Brennadam]]:
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|Brennadam is a well-traveled crossroads. It's likely that Atwater has passed through here a time or two.}}
