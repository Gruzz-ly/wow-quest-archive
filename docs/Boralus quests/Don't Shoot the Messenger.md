==Objectives==
Listen to Valeera's message.
* Listen to [[Valeera Sanguinar|Valeera's]] Message

==Description==
While he was the [[gladiator]] known as Lo'gosh, [[Varian Wrynn|King Varian]] fought beside Valeera Sanguinar. He trusted her and that allowed [[SI:7]] to have a... cordial relationship with her. Valeera's loyalty has carried on to [[Anduin Wrynn|King Anduin]].

During the [[Third invasion of the Burning Legion|fight]] with the [[Burning Legion|Legion]], I came to know her as a capable if... [[independent]] operative. She can go where even some of my [[agent]]s cannot.

We should listen to whatever message she brings. I imagine the source will be interesting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This is... surprising news.

==Completion==
Anduin is very trusting. Varian was much less so and chose his friends and allies carefully. But Master Shaw has a finely tuned sense of paranoia, shall we say. If he believes Valeera speaks the truth about [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]], then I am inclined to follow his lead.

==Notes==
;Listen to Valeera's Message
<Valeera looks you over>

I do what I can, Champion, as we all must.

{{gossip|What is your message?}}

;Playing as a [[rogue]]
Funny how we keep meeting under dire circumstances, <name>.

<Valeera smirks.>

Think you can convince Lady Proudmoore I'm not out to kill her? She really is going to want to hear this.

{{gossip|I'll vouch for you as well. What did you have to say?}}

:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Let's hear this message of yours.}}
:{{text|say|Valeera Sanguinar|Baine Bloodhoof seeks to [[Righting Wrongs|right a wrong]] done to [[House Proudmoore|your family]]. He asks to meet with you in secret... off the coast of [[Theramore Isle|Theramore]].}}
: ''Jaina irately crouches, hands lit with magic.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|After all that the [[Horde]] has done, you have the audacity to--}}
: ''Valeera plows onward, insistent.''
:{{text|say|Valeera Sanguinar|The [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Banshee Queen]] has eyes everywhere. Theramore is one of the few places she is not watching.}}
:{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Lady Jaina, Valeera was one of King Varian's closest friends. If she says Baine seeks this meeting in defiance of Sylvanas, then I believe her.}}
: ''Jaina stands down.''
:{{text|say|Valeera Sanguinar|You may not trust me, Lord Admiral, but King Anduin will vouch for both me and the chieftain.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I trusted Varian... as I trust Master Shaw. That will have to do. Tell Baine that I agree to this meeting... but I am not going alone.
