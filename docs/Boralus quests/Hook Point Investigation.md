==Objectives==
Speak with [[Grand Marshal Tremblade]] at [[Hook Point]].

==Description==
I'm sure you've heard the constant sound of battle coming from Hook Point.

We sent [[scout]]s over to find out why the fighting never seems to end, and discovered an unexpected training ground.

[[Daniel Poole]] at Hook Point is running some sort of fight circuit near the [[Tradewinds Market|Tradewind Market]]. Seek out Grand Marshal Tremblade at our [[War Headquarters]] and find out what they've learned.

==Completion==
So you've found the [[Dueler's Guild]], <name>.
