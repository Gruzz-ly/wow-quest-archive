==Objectives==
Meet [[Brother Pike]] near the [[Crucible of Storms]] to cleanse your [[Gift of N'Zoth|"gift"]].
* Brother Pike met {{co|85.3|50.0|Stormsong Valley}}
* Curse removed

==Description==
Something dark has taken root within you, <name>. The tendrils of [[N'Zoth]] are burrowing into your mind and soul, eager to consume everything you are.

I can perform a rite of cleansing, but only in a place that resonates with the very power that grips you. 

Meet me near the Crucible of Storms. The ritual will be perilous and painful, but it is your only chance to be free.

The Old God has eyes everywhere. I do not wish you to become one of them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* [[Twitching Eyeball]]

==Progress==
There can be no treating with the darkness, <name>.

==Completion==
It is done. The darkness fades and your mind is once more your own.

You are free of N'Zoth's influence. Let us hope he does not seek to take hold of you again.

==Notes==
*This quest will cleanse/remove the buff [[Gift of N'Zoth]] and provide a toy for it instead.

::{{Text|say|Brother Pike|Now stand very still. I must excise N'Zoth's defilement from you.}}
::''Brother Pike channels the cleansing ritual to purge the [[adventurer]] of the curse.
::{{Text|say|Brother Pike|I am pleased that the cleansing ritual didn't prove fatal. You are either very resilient... or very lucky.}}
