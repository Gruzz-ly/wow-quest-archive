==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Completion==

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Thomas Zelling|Let's get back to the portal.}}

Back in Plunder Harbor, [[Proudmoore Marine]]s have landed and fight against the Horde and pirates.

:{{Text|say|Thomas Zelling|We have successfully retrieved the Abyssal Scepter, Nathanos.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Ah, good. Not only will this be a boon for the [[Golden Fleet|Zandalari armada]]... but also a detriment to that of the [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tirans]].}}
:{{Text|say|[[Captain Amalia Stone]]|[[Katherine Proudmoore|Lady Proudmoore]]'s forces are relentless, Nathanos. We should get out of here as soon as possible.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Lilian Voss]]|I fear it is slightly too late for that, Amalia. We have a new visitor.}}
