==Objectives==
Collect the Compass of Clarity, the Curio of the Depths, and the Key of the Sea in [[Stormsong Monastery]].
* [[Compass of Clarity]]
* [[Curio of the Depths]]
* [[Key of the Sea]]

==Description==
There is a reason why I am accompanying you on this mission, and it's more than familiarity. The [[:Abyssal Scepter]] is locked behind a ritual, the components for which are held by three separate [[lieutenant]]s spread across the compound.

You get the relics, I perform the ritual, we grab the Scepter and we get out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
Have you collected the relics yet?

==Completion==
Please do not tell me who you had to get through to obtain these relics. I do not want to know.

==Progression==
{{The Strike on Boralus}}

==Patch changes==
