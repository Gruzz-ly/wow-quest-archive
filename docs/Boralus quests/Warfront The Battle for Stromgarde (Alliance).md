==Objectives==
Defeat the Horde at the Battle for Stromgarde.
* View the [[War Table]] in [[Boralus]]
* [[Horde]] defeated at the [[Battle for Stromgarde]]

==Description==
If the Horde thinks it can assault [[Stromgarde]], it is sorely mistaken! We will not let [[Arathi Highlands|Arathi]] fall!

Prepare yourself for battle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
*[[Warfronts Equipment Cache]]
*15x [[7th Legion Service Medal]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Core]] (750x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
We must do all we can to claim Arathi for the [[Alliance]].

==Completion==
Well fought, <name>, though I'm afraid it may be premature to let our guard down just yet. I am sure our enemy will not sit idly while we rebuild Stromgarde.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
