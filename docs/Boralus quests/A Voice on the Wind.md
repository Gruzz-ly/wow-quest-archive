==Objectives==
Seek out the source of the mysterious voice in [[Drustvar]].

==Description==
<A distant, mysterious voice fills your mind.>

My enchantments are not lost...

Find me...

Drustvar...

[[Fallhaven]]...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Be at ease, friend. I don't want to hurt you. Instead, I have a proposition for you.

You see, I was a [[druid]] once and the only thing I loved more than tending to the forests and creatures within them was [[enchanting]]. 

Then I was murdered and cursed to wander this peninsula, unable to cross river nor mountain so long as my body still exists. 

If you destroy my old body and help me make a new one, I will teach you how I made the rod you disenchanted.
