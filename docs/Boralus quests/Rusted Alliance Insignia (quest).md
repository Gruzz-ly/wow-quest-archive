* [[Rusted Alliance Insignia]]

You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* +250 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Yes, champion?

==Completion==
This war will not be without casualties, it is a shame that so much must be lost to keep what we hold dear.

This insignia belonged to an [[Alliance]] [[soldier]]. I will see if I can determine who, and I will speak with their family, should they have one.

Let me know if you find more of these.
