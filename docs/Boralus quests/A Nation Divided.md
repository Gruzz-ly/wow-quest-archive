We'll support you however we can.

==Notes==
On acceptance, a short [[Battle for Azeroth in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays as Taelia provides a brief introduction of the three zones' storylines:
{{#ev:youtube|v39utRvCdik|urlArgs=start=9&end=97}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|[[Kul Tiras]] is made up of several major houses. They were unified under [[Daelin Proudmoore|Daelin Proudmoore's]] leadership, but that gradually changed after [[Invasion of Durotar#Admiral's fall|his defeat at Theramore]].}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|[[Katherine Proudmoore|Lord Admiral Katherine Proudmoore]] now rules in his place, commanding both the military and the guard.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Despite our efforts to maintain order, Kul Tiras has seen an increase in crime, corruption, and piracy. People are losing faith in the [[Proudmoore Admiralty]].}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|To the west lies [[Drustvar]], a mountainous region providing most of the kingdom's ore... and some of our toughest warriors.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|[[House Waycrest]] has been a loyal supporter of Proudmoore's rule for centuries, but their recent absence from council meetings has given rise to troubling rumors.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|In [[Stormsong Valley]], to the north, the [[tidesage]]s of [[House Stormsong]] craft and bless the ships of our legendary fleet.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|But nobody has heard from the fleet in months! The tidesages have withdrawn into their cloisters and seem uninterested in finding our missing ships.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|We must unite the houses beneath the Proudmoore banner and locate the missing fleet. Otherwise, Kul Tiras could fall apart before this war even begins.}}

It is possible to replay the cutscene.
:{{gossip|Can you brief me on Kul Tiras again?}}

Interact with the [[Scouting Map]] behind Taelia to view the three scouting reports. Pick one to start that zone's storyline:
;[[Drustvar (quest)]]: Lord and Lady Waycrest are strong allies of the Proudmoores. Investigate their sudden absence and the troubling rumors from Drustvar.
;[[Stormsong Valley (quest)]]: The legendary Kul Tiran fleet has gone missing. Seek answers from the reclusive ocean mystics of House Stormsong.
;[[Tiragarde Sound (quest)]]: Expose the corruption in Boralus and earn Katherine Proudmoore's trust.

This concludes the introduction to Kul Tiras and the [[Battle for Azeroth intro experience]]. Next, [[Genn Greymane]] offers [[The War Campaign (Alliance)]], and get started on the chosen zone storyline.
