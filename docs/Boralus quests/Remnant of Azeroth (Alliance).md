==Objectives==
Bring the Remnant of Azeroth to [[Churbro]] in [[Boralus]].
*[[Remnant of Azeroth]]

==Description==
Upon first glance it appears to be a crystallized shard of [[Azeroth]]'s life blood. Peering into the shard reveals visions of war across familiar fronts, countless lives locked in battle. The sounds of thunderous storms and crashing waves begin to overwhelm you, before coming to an eerie halt.

[[Kul Tiras]] calls out to you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*200 [[XP]]
*500x [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Completion==
A remnant of Azeroth from a time of conflict and strife. Such a troubled artifact has no place in the timeways, thank you for returning it.
