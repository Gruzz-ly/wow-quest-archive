==Objectives==
Collect 100 Stolen Storm Silver Bars.
* [[Stolen Storm Silver Bar]] (100)

==Description==
<Name>, I just got word that one of our ships was attacked and a large amount of [[Storm Silver Ore|storm silver]] stolen!

The sacred materials can't be replaced. Once it is blessed by the [[Tidesages|seapriest]], it is buried underwater for a year!

From what I heard, a group of [[pirate]]s followed the ship to see where the metal was buried on the sea floor before killing the crew and taking her cargo.

Kill the pirates and get back that metal.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Mining techniques|Mining Technique: Storm Silver Deposit (Rank 3)]]

==Progress==
Damn those pirates!

Have you recovered the bars?

==Completion==
Ah!  This is fantastic news! I will have someone run these out to the docks right away.

I was starting to fear that they may have gotten you, too.

That said, you have avenged my people.  In exchange, let me show you the finer points of harvesting storm silver.

<Myra takes the next several minutes to explain what she knows about harvesting storm silver deposits.>
