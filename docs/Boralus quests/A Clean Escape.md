==Objectives==
Return to [[Boralus]] and report to [[Halford Wyrmbane|High Commander Halford Wyrmbane]].

==Description==
Our victory here will echo through the [[Horde]] like a warning shot.

[[Grunt]]s will whisper around the campfire that nowhere is safe from <name> and the [[Alliance]].

[[Soldier]]s will doubt, even for a moment, the strength of their [[Commander (rank)|commanders]].

[[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] herself will hear the story of what we did here today, and it will infuriate her. The thought of her outraged roar when she hears the news will keep me warm tonight.

Let's return to Boralus and inform the High Commander of the good news.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,930 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Core]] (800x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Completion==
You've done the Alliance, and all of [[Azeroth]], a fine service today, <name>.

We will sleep in a better world than we woke to. That is all that can be asked of us.

For the Alliance!

This concludes the "Blood in the Water" chapter of [[Ready for War]]. Keep working on reputation with the [[7th Legion]], as the final chapter opens up at revered standing with [[Operation: Heartstrike]].
