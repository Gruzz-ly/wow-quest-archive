==Objectives==
Speak with [[Yvera Dawnwing]] to teleport to [[Stromgarde]], then report to [[Captain Roderick Brewston]].

==Description==
I need you to see the [[Arathi Highlands]]. The battle has died down for now, but when it flares up again, we'll need you on the front.

Yvera Dawnwing maintains a portal directly to Stromgarde. She can help you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Terrible business, war is. Really.

Glad you could make it, soldier. Let's make this quick.

==Notes==
Yvera Dawnwing is 10 yards to the north.
