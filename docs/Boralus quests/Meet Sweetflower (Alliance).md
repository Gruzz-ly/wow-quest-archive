==Objectives==
Find [[Xun Xun Sweetflower]] in [[Drustvar]].

==Description==
It looks like you've become familiar with the plants around here. There's a flower that grows in the snowy parts of the continent, but I can't tell you much else about it. Can't stand being cold.

However, if you're interested in learning more, I know of someone who may be able to teach you.

Her name's [[Xun Xun Sweetflower]], and last I heard she set up shop on the outskirts of [[Anyport]] over in [[Drustvar]]. Tread carefully, though, that area is crawling with [[Irontide Raiders]].

==Completion==
Oh, you'd like to learn about harvesting winter's kiss?  Well that's very fortunate, for both of us...
