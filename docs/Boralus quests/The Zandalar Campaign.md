==Objectives==
Use the [[Zandalar Campaign]] Map to choose a foothold.
*Choose a foothold

==Description==
It is time that we begin to think of our enemy, <name>. The [[Horde]] spreads its influence throughout [[Zandalar]] unchecked.

[[Anduin Wrynn|King Anduin]] has charged us with establishing footholds in the areas of [[Zuldazar]], [[Nazmir]], and [[Vol'dun]].

I have taken the liberty of deploying some of our forces in key locations, but each will need a firm hand--your hand--to direct our efforts.

Which location shall we secure first?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must secure our foothold on Zandalar.

==Completion==
A fine choice, <name>.

==Notes==
