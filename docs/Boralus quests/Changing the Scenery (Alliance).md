==Objectives==
Go to [[Stormsong Valley]] and transmute [[Barberry Shrub]]s into Shrubbery Bubbles and gather 6 of them.
* [[Shrubbery Bubble]] (6)

==Description==
The stone this recipe becomes is a transmutation stone. What if the missing reagents to make it come from something that's gone through the transmutation process?

I'm willing to try anything at this point. Here's an old recipe my ex-partner devised.

He used to go out to Stormsong Valley, just south of the [[Highland Flats]] and change the shrubs there into bubbles.

Bring back some of those bubbles and we'll see if they're what we've been missing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I've seen him use those globes in some of his projects in the past, so there is clearly some alchemical properties to them.

==Completion==
These bubbles seem...odd. But then again so is [[Quintin Whalgrene|Quintin]].

==Progression==
