==Objectives==
Carefully remove the enchantment from the Ancient Drust relic to learn about its construction.
* Speak to [[Emily Fairweather]]
* Learn the secrets to the [[Ancient Drust Relic|Ancient Drust relic]]'s construction

==Description==
Ahoy, <name>!

If you have a moment, I could use your assistance. I've recently received a large shipment of [[Drust]] relics that I've been processing.

Most of them have been nothing out of the ordinary, but there is this one that is special. Just holding it makes my hair stand on end.

With you being my best pupil, I was thinking that it would be fun if we disenchanted it together, to see how it was made.

What do you say?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
I'm sorry, <name>, I didn't think that enchantment would be so complex. I thought I could maintain the incantation.



I guess that's it. With the relic destroyed the technique behind its construction is lost.

A shame, really. It's not often that I'm left dumbfounded by another enchanter.
