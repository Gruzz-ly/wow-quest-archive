==Objectives==
Using the RJR Rifle, shoot the apple on top of [[Lucky Wilhelm]]'s head, then speak with [[Drostan]].
* Shot apple on Lucky Wilhelm's Head
*[[RJR Rifle]] (provided)

==Description==
So you think you can shoot?

Well, let's give it a try. Here, we'll start you out with something nice and gentle. Don't worry, it's got no kick to it at all. Remember, don't point that gun at anything you don't intend to fire at.

Now, when you're ready, just take aim at that apple on top o' old Lucky Wilhelm's head and let 'er fly!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Satisfied with the results?

==Completion==
You're not a bad shot, but you'll get better with practice. How would you like to make a little wager?

==Notes==
There is, in fact, some kick to the rifle... Players can miss and Wilhelm will exclaim:
:Lucky Wilhelm says: No! That was my good side!
:Drostan says: Calm down, lad, it's just birdshot!

Players can also knock themselves on their back... or actually hit the apple:
:Lucky Wilhelm says: Good shot!

One might even hit one of the nearby hovering [[Sholazar Tickbird]]s. But don't worry, [[Crunchy]], the camp's baby croc, will take care of the carcass for you.

Don't try to use the item while someone else is targeted, the UI will yell at you:
:What are you doing? Only aim that thing at Wilheim!
