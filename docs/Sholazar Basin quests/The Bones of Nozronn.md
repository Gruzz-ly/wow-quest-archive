Use Soo-rahm's Incense near the [[Bones of Nozronn]], then return to [[Hemet Nesingwary]] at [[Nesingwary Base Camp]] with the information you learned.
* Location of Farunn revealed
* [[Soo-Rahm's Incense]] (provided)

==Description==
Bones of Nozronn, [[Oracle Soo-rahm]] sends <name> to you!

We have prepared incense for you. Light it and place it near Nozronn's head and you will hear his voice.

<Confused, you tell Soo-rahm that you haven't even told him your question.>

True, we not know, but mighty Nozronn does. Do not doubt. Nozronn will answer your heart's question.

Go. Nozronn not wait long.

==Progress==
Well, have you consulted the native oracle?

==Completion==
<Hemet listens as you describe what you learned.>

Way to go, <lad/lass>. No dead rhino tells Hemet Nesingwary where and what he can hunt. We'll show that heap o' bones.

Using the incense at the [[Offering Bowl]] makes the Voice of Nozronn talk to the player:
:{{Text|say|Voice of Nozronn|So the oracle has decided to aid you, outlander. Very well, I will offer you what I know.}}
:{{Text|say|Voice of Nozronn|Your companion seeks the shardhorn patriarch [[Farunn]], who holds himself aloof from his brothers.}}
:{{Text|say|Voice of Nozronn|Farunn walks the lands north of what your people call the [[Bittertide Falls]]. You will find him alone, but you will see he requires no defenders.}}
:{{Text|say|Voice of Nozronn|Return to your companion. Tell him to go forth and claim is prize in Farunn.}}
:{{Text|say|Voice of Nozronn|Once he has done so, tell him to leave this land in peace. He does not belong here.}}
