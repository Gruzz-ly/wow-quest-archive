==Objectives==
Look for Vic's Keys inside the lake at [[River's Heart (subzone)|River's Heart]].
* [[Vic's Keys]]
* [[Vic's Emergency Air Tank]] (provided)

==Description==
There's one little problem we have to solve before we head out. You see, I can't seem to find the keys to [[Vic's Flying Machine|my flying machine]].

I've looked pretty much everywhere for them... maybe you can give me a hand. Only place I haven't looked yet is inside the lake.

I'll even give you my very own air tank. It's almost empty, but it's got a couple of hits left. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|50}}

==Progress==
You find anything yet, <name>?

==Completion==
Excellent!

==Notes==
Dive into the lake and look for [[Raised Mud]]. Opening them may spawn a [[Siltslither Eel]] instead of getting the key.
