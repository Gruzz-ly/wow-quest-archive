==Objectives==
Bring a Shattertusk Mammoth to [[Zootfizzle (NPC)|Zootfizzle]] at [[Dorian's Outpost]].
* [[Shattertusk Mammoth]] Delivered
* [[Mammoth Harness]] (provided)

==Description==
Before you go off challenging [[Broodmother Slivina]], [[Dorian Drakestalker|Dorian]] thought it might be a good idea for you and [[Hemet Nesingwary|Hemet]] to coordinate your efforts by riding into battle on the back of a mammoth.

The area around the camp is full of them. Just take this bridle and skip it over the head of a shattertusk mammoth. Be careful of the bulls, though. They won't tolerate the harness at all. Bring the mammoth back here when you've found a suitable one. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|10}}

==Progress==
Everything taken care of?

==Completion==
Perfect! Now, all we need to do is get [[Hemet Nesingwary|Hemet]] a stepladder...
