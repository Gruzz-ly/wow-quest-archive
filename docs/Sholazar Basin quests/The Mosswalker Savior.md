==Objectives==
[[Moodle]] wants you to rescue 6 of the [[Mosswalker Victim]]s in [[Mosswalker Village]], though some of them may no longer be alive to save.

If you lose [[Moodle's Stress Ball]], speak to [[High-Oracle Soo-say]] in [[Rainspeaker Canopy]].
* Mosswalker Victims Rescued (6)

==Description==
There's some small chance that the Mosswalkers are not all dead yet... and at the very least, they deserve to not be butchered like this.

Let's find some revenge for this slaughter and see if there are any to be saved in the process.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|50}}

==Progress==
I wish I had known how key the pillars and the stones were much earlier... perhaps I could have prevented this.

==Completion==
I'm very glad there were some to be saved... with luck, they'll make it back to [[Rainspeaker Canopy]] safely.

==Progression==
