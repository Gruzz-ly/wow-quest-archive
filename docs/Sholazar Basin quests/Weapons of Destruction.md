'''Weapons of Destruction''' is a quest in the [[Waygate (location)|Waygate]] quest chain in [[Sholazar Basin]].

==Objectives==
The [[Avatar of Freya]] wants you to go to the [[Death's Hand Encampment|Cultist Encampment]] to the northwest and destroy 4 Unstable Explosives.
* [[Unstable Explosives]] destroyed (4)

==Description==
The {{npc||Lich King}}'s [[Cult of the Damned|lackeys]] have dared to bring weapons of destruction into my domain. I will not stand for this.

Go to their outpost to the north and destroy the weapons they would use against the land. We cannot let the [[Scourge]] taint another inch of these sacred lands. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|50}}
*21,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is it done, <name>?

==Completion==
I think you, <name>. You're proving to be a worthy ally.

==Notes==
The cultist camp is at {{coords|57|41|Sholazar Basin}}.  The [[Unstable Explosive]]s are the large, [[bomb]]like objects in the camp.  The cultists in the camp drop small bombs, which you'll want to avoid.
