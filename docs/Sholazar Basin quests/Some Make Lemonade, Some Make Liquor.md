==Objectives==
Bring 1 Orange, 2 Banana Bunches, and 1 Papaya to [[Grimbooze Thunderbrew]] at the [[Nesingwary Base Camp]].
*[[Orange]]
*[[Banana Bunch]] (2)
*[[Papaya]]

==Description==
Life's tossed me a cartload of lemons this time! When the ship ran aground, the kegs carrying my best brew burst! All we have now are a few bottles of rum, and it won't sustain a thirsty expedition!

We need to get some booze cooking, and fast!!

The trees in the Wildgrowth Mangal, to the east, seem laden with fruit, but it's too high for me to reach. Look for good, strong vines, see if you can use it to shake some of that fruit out of the trees. Bring me whatever you can find. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Progress==
Did you have luck winning any of that fruit from those darn tall and stingy trees?

==Completion==
Well, that's a better assortment that I would've expected from this place. Now, for the important question: can we distill it into anything drinkable? We'd better get started.

==Notes==
Look for [[Sturdy Vine]]s throughout the [[Wildgrowth Mangal]] and use them to shake down the fruit. The fruit you'll be awarded with is random. Tugging at a vine can also spawn an [[Adventurous Dwarf]], who will give you a choice of either fruit.
