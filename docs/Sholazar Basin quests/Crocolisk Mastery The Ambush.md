==Objectives==
Bring [[Bushwhacker]]'s Jaw to [[Debaar]] at the [[Nesingwary Base Camp]].
* [[Bushwhacker's Jaw]]
* [[Sandfern Disguise]] (provided)

==Description==
The largest [[crocolisk]] in the basin, known around here as "Bushwhacker" for his ambush prowess, likes to sun himself in the shallow waters of [[River's Heart (subzone)|River's Heart]]. It's the large lake at the basin's center, and is to the east of our camp.

I want you to take the camouflage I've prepared and hide on the western beach of River's Heart and ambush Bushwhacker when he shows himself. Bring back his mighty jaws if you are able to overcome him.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Tooth-Marked Girdle
|Crocscale Moccasins
|Muck-Stained Carapace
|Bent Crocolisk Tooth}}
You will also receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Progress==
Did our plan work?

==Completion==
<Debaar listens as you describe the failure of the disguise.>

What do you mean, our plan didn't work as intended?

Well, you did manage to get the kill, to your credit. Look at the size of this jaw! Hemet will be proud of our efforts. This crocolisk was truly a monster.

==Notes==
You will have to use the disguise at the fallen log at the west side of River's Heart.
