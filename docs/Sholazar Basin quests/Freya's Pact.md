'''Freya's Pact''' is a quest in the [[Waygate (location)|Waygate]] quest chain in [[Sholazar Basin]].

==Objectives==
Listen to what the [[Avatar of Freya]] has to say.
* Freya's Pact

==Description==
The [[Cult of the Damned|cultists]] have been taken care of, but the [[Scourge]]'s invasion has not slowed down. The situation is becoming desperate, <name>.

There exists a last resort. Before I reveal any more, however, I must be sure I have your absolute trust.

==Rewards==
* 2,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
There is no turning back now. If you agree to help me, you will do so without hesitation.

==Notes==
The conversation goes:
:{{Gossip|I want to stop the Scourge as much as you do. How can I help?}}

::The [[titan]]s did not create life overnight. The process was gradual and required a great deal of experimentation and iteration.

::It is for that reason that highly protected places such as [[Sholazar Basin]] exist.

::To ensure the safety of their experimentation sites, the titans created a defense mechanism. Its destructive force is unparalleled however, and I will reveal no more unless you swear your fealty to my cause.

::{{Gossip|You can trust me. I am no friend of the [[Lich King]]'s.}}

:::It borders on sacrilege that these secrets be revealed to a [[mortal]] such as yourself, but I have little choice.

:::Ever since {{npc||Freya}}, daughter of the titans, left me here I've had but one task and I cannot fail. Life must be protected at any cost.

:::There is a [[Waygate (location)|waygate]] that links this place with [[Un'Goro Crater|another]] very much like this one. It is there that the weapon we seek can be found.

:::{{Gossip|I will not fail.}}
