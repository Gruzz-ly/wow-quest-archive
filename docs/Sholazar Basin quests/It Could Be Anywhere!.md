==Objectives==
Look for a Golden Engagement Ring on the various creatures in [[Sholazar Basin]].
* [[Golden Engagement Ring]]

==Description==
When I found out that [[Purser Boulian|Miss Boulian]] was helping [[Hemet Nesingwary|Nesingwary]] with his expedition, I signed up as a deckhand immediately. You see, I'd been meaning to marry her for months!

I had it all planned out. I was going to propose the very night of the shipwreck... but now the ring is gone. I've searched everywhere!

I know it might sound crazy, but I know the engagement ring is in the Basin. If some [[Venture Company]] didn't steal it, maybe a wild creature ate it. But it's here somewhere... I just know it! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Cloak of Renewed Hope|Pauldrons of Resolution|Boots of Dominance|Ring of Devoted Promises}}
You will also receive: {{cost|18|60}}

==Progress==
The ring, <name>! Please... tell me you've found it!

==Completion==
You did it! You actually found it!

I don't know... I don't know how to thank you!

==Notes==
This is the first quest you should pick up before killing ''any'' mobs in [[Sholazar Basin]], as everything in the zone has a chance of dropping the ring.
