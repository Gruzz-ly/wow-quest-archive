[[Zepik the Gorloc Hunter|Zepik]] wants you to kill 12 Mistwhisper Gorlocs.

If you lose [[Zepik's Hunting Horn]], speak to [[Elder Harkek]] in [[Frenzyheart Hill]].
* Mistwhisper Gorloc (12)

==Description==
Bristlepine and wasps are boring! Big-tongues the only thing fun to hunt.

While we mess up rain shrine, we kill lots of mist big-tongues. That sure to make them not want to come back to village thing.

<Zepik nods to himself confidently.> 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|50}}

==Progress==
We best hunters of basin!

==Completion==
I stab those big-tongues good.

You did okay I guess.

No, I just kidding! You good hunter. I glad to hunt with you.
