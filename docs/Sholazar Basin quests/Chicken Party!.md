==Objectives==
Capture 12 [[Chicken Escapee]]s for [[Elder Harkek]] at [[Frenzyheart Hill]].
* [[Captured Chicken]] (12)
* [[Chicken Net]] (provided)

==Description==
I bet you not guess what happen again.

Nope, not [[Goregek the Gorilla Hunter|Goregek]] or chickens.

Okay, I lie. Goregek let chickens out again. Dumb Goregek and rumbly belly.

Let me know if you need help from any of the hunters... they around here somewhere. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|50}}

==Progress==
Chickens not get far usually... if wasps not eat them, maybe we just let them stay on field next time.

==Completion==
You good at this.

Maybe someday we just dump Goregek in river so you not have to do this no more.

==Notes==
Completing this quest is a part of the [[Honorary Frenzyheart]] achievement.

Both throwing the net and picking up the chickens can be done while mounted.
