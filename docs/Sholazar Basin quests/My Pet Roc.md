== Objectives ==
Bring 7 [[Roc Egg]]s to [[Zootfizzle (NPC)|Zootfizzle]] at [[Dorian's Outpost]].
* [[Roc Egg]] (7)

== Description ==
Dorian's had me training and feeding the baby drakes he captures, and it has gotten me thinking. I want a pet of my own!

No, not a juvenile drake. I don't want a pet capable of biting my hand off!

However, in the [[Bonefields]] to the northeast of the camp, beyond the area dominated by the drakes, there's a large population of goretalon rocs. The grown ones are beyond hope of domesticating, but if you bring me the eggs from their nests, I can raise them from the time they hatch. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|50}}

== Progress ==
Do you have those eggs?

== Completion ==
Oh, these are very nice! I've gotten so tired of robotic squirrels and chickens for company. It'll be wonderful to have a pet whose joints won't require oiling!
