==Objectives==
Bring Pitch's Remains to [[Tamara Wobblesprocket]] at [[Lakeside Landing]].
* [[Pitch's Remains]]

==Description==
When [[Hemet Nesingwary|Hemet]] asked me to accompany [[Marvin Wobblesprocket|Marvin]] out here, I hoped that I might have the opportunity to work on my own hunting skills in between repairing the [[flying machine]]s and setting up the camp.

I wanted to take down a ferocious [[lion]] named [[Pitch]]. He's said to make his home south of here, near where the [[Wildgrowth Mangal]] meets the northern face of the [[Skyreach Pillar]]. If you can find the beast, would you bring back his remains? If the rumors are true, they'd make a trophy even Hemet will respect!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|20}}
*21150 [[XP]] (or {{cost|12|69||}} at level 80)

==Progress==
Did you find Pitch?

==Completion==
You got it! Now all I have to do is make a trophy out of it. That'll be the hard part -- finding a way to preserve it so that Hemet doesn't have a good laugh at my expense.

==Notes==
Pitch is located at {{coords|50.5|77.3|Sholazar Basin}}, surrounded by three [[wolvar]] of the [[Frenzyheart Tribe]]. [[Tracker Gekgek]] will curse you for stealing the kill, and gives you the quest [[Playing Along]].
