==Objectives==
[[Buck Cantwell]] at the [[Nesingwary Base Camp]] wants you to identify 3 [[Shango (dreadsaber)|Shango]] Tracks from the Dreadsaber Tracks near [[Bittertide Lake]].
*Shango Track identified (3)

==Description==
I have heard that the natives tell stories of a large dreadsaber they call [[Shango (dreadsaber)|Shango]]. I haven't seen any evidence of this Shango's existence, but my injuries have kept me from venturing outside the camp.

If you fancy yourself something of a tracker, you might be able to find out the truth about Shango. [[Debaar]] said she saw some large tracks on her last outing. Go north from the camp toward Bittertide Lake, and search its southern shore for the prints. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Progress==
How goes the tracking?

==Completion==
<Buck listens as you recount your findings.>

I think you may have found the proof we need for this Shango. And I think I have an idea as to where we can find him.
