'''The Lifewarden's Wrath''' is a quest in the [[Waygate (location)|Waygate]] quest chain in [[Sholazar Basin]].

==Objectives==
The [[Avatar of Freya]] at the [[Rainspeaker Rapids]] wants you to use Freya's Horn atop of the [[Glimmering Pillar]].
* The Lifewarden's Wrath
* [[Freya's Horn]] (provided)

==Description==
We were not quick enough, <name>. The [[Cult of the Damned|cultist scum]] have arrived at the [[Glimmering Pillar]] and are making preparations to destroy it, I can sense them.

We don't have much time. Blow upon this horn atop the Glimmering Pillar to channel my power through the crystal.

We shall show this scum to not trifle with the [[titans]]' creations. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|10}}
* 16,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you taken care of the cultists, <name>?

==Completion==
Impressive. I wasn't expecting a mere mortal to prove as worthy an ally as you.

I fear our efforts have not been sufficient, however. The [[Scourge]] shows no signs of stopping.

==Notes==
Blowing the horn activates the floating device above the pillar, which then destroys the surrounding cultists with energy beams.

Getting to the top of the pillar is most easily done with a [[flying mount]].  If you don't have [[Cold Weather Flying]] (or the {{cost|500}} to buy it), you can borrow a flying mount ({{Alliance}}[[Loaned Gryphon Reins]] or {{Horde}}[[Loaned Wind Rider Reins]]) from [["Honest" Max]] at [[K3]] in the [[Storm Peaks]].

==Progression==
