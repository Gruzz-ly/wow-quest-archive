'''Mastery of the Crystals''' is a daily from [[The Oracles]]

==Objectives==
Retrieve the crystal defenses at [[Sparktouched Haven]] and use them to kill 50 of the nearby [[Frenzyheart]] [[wolvar]]. When these tasks are complete, return to [[Lightningcaller Soo-met]] in [[Sparktouched Haven]]. 
*Frenzyheart Attacker slain (50)

==Description==
Sparktouched are still being attacked by puppy-men... we think they maybe not stop if we not make them stop. We have secret weapon though... we sent it out to Soo-met so he can use to protect all Oracles.

Secret weapon is from Great Ones themselves... extra shiny crystals found inside sacred Great One temples. Be very careful... no break them.

Crystals are in chest near shrine at Sparktouched Haven, in far southwest. You go use crystals to help Soo-met beat the puppy-men.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|g=13|s=60}} (or {{Cost|g=16|s=20}} at Level 80)
*27000 [[XP]]
*+700 [[reputation]] with [[The Oracles]]

==Progress==
Very powerful. Puppy-men not know about power of Great Ones. Dumb puppy-men.

==Completion==
Thank you, dryskin.

I hold onto these crystals here to keep us safe. Maybe you come back soon and help us more.

==Criteria of==
*[[Savior of the Oracles]]

==Notes==
The crystal defenses can be found in a chest at 33,75.
There are three crystals. One is an AoE like Hurricane, the other is like Frost Trap, and the third attacks single targets.

If you want to loot the [[Wolvar]] you must tag them, otherwise you'll just get credit for the kill.

A useful macro for this quest is:<br>
/show<br>
/showtooltip<br>
/castsequence [[Crystal of the Violent Storm]], [[Crystal of the Frozen Grip]], [[Crystal of Unstable Energy]]

This will allow you to summon the three crystals quickly by clicking it three times. Saving 2 spots if you put it on your actionbar.

Kill [[Frenzyheart Ravager]]s and [[Frenzyheart Hunter]]s.
