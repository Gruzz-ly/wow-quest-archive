==Objectives==
Bring 7 Venture Co. Spare Parts to [[Weslex Quickwrench]] at the [[Nesingwary Base Camp]].
*[[Venture Co. Spare Parts]] (7)

==Description==
Great, now that we've got an engine, we're going to need an assortment of other parts to get her back in flying condition. Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

A good mechanic can hold his creations together with anything, but we're better off if it doesn't come to that.

Anyway, those Venture Company dullards have plenty of spare parts for their mining equipment all over [[Swindlegrin's Dig]] on the far side of that yellow crystal pillar to the northeast. Scoop up a few and bring them back here. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Progress==
Did you get those parts?

==Completion==
With a little work, these should suffice. My poor flying machine might end up looking more like a Venture Company shredder, though. Poor girl will have to wait until we get back to Dalaran to be restored to her rightful form.

==Notes==
Completing this quest spawns [[The Spirit of Gnomeregan]], which serves as a flight path.
