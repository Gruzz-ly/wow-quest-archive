'''Salvaging Life's Strength''' is a side quest in the [[Waygate (location)|Waygate]] [[quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Avatar of Freya|Freya]] wants you to go to the Sundered Shard to the southeast and use the Lifeforce Gem on 8 destroyed [[Lifeblood Elemental]]s.
* Lifeblood Energy Recovered (8)
* [[Lifeblood Gem]] (provided)

==Description==
The Lifeblood Pillar was toppled over with great force, sending the very earth into an upheaval.

The [[elemental]]s that wander the sundered shard carry with them the very life essence that gave the pillar its strength. I cannot allow this energy to be wasted, for only four pillars remain.

Head to the sundered shard, to the southeast, and seek the lifeblood elementals.

Use this gem on their remains to recover their rampant energy. We'll need the energy to heal the land when all this is over. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|50}}
* 21,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered the elementals' energy, <name>?

==Completion==
I thank you, <name>. It is a shame that the pillar has fallen, but we must salvage what we can.

==Notes==
The elementals are on the hill, not in the cave.  Use the gem on them after killing them.  Miners should use the gem ''before'' [[mining]] the elementals.

To save time, you may want to do this quest at the same time as [[The Fallen Pillar]].
