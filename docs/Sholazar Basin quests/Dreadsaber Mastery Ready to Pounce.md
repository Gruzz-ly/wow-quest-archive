==Description==
[[Shango (dreadsaber)|Shango]] awaits, <name>. If you have succeeded in your tracking, he will not know that you stalk him, and you will need the advantage.

He is supposed to be bigger, stronger, and more ferocious than the other dreadsabers of the [[Sholazar Basin|basin]]. Travel north, to the western shore of [[Bittertide Lake]] and near the falls that feed it, do battle with Shango. If you succeed, return with his pelt.

==Progress==
Have you taken on Shango?

==Completion==
What an exquisite pelt from such a noble animal! It heartens me to see that the rumors about Shango were indeed true, <name>. Your pursuit of the creature has been flawless. You are a true huntsman.
