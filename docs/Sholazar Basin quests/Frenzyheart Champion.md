== Completion ==
I know you weren't traitor thing like others said. We hunt together... I know you better than all of them. Thank you for saving me.

May sound funny... I not a big fan of big-tongues... but even I feel little bad for big-tongue dying like that though... fair fight much better... they fight good enough they deserve fair fight.

You want to be friends with Frenzyheart again? I think I can convince them that you save me and got the big-tongues good. I no want you to make me look dumb though, so you sure?
