==Objectives==
Speak with [[Monte Muzzleshot]] in the [[Wildgrowth Mangal]] of [[Sholazar Basin]].

==Description==
[[Hemet Nesingwary]] was last heard from leading an expedition into the jungle depths of Sholazar Basin. His expedition has not been heard from since.

Monte Muzzleshot is a pilot who was dispatched to provide them supplies, but he hasn't returned, either.

Volunteers are needed to mount an expedition to find the missing expedition. Monte's [[flying machine]] was last seen in the Wildgrowth Mangal south of the [[Suntouched Pillar]] in Sholazar Basin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Aye, Hemet's here. He's at the camp, just go northwest toward the river and you'll soon see it. And for the love of the [[Light]], lad, have him send someone to cut me down!
