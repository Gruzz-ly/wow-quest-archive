'''Returned Sevenfold''' is a quest in the [[Waygate (location)|Waygate]] [[quest chain]].

==Objectives==
The [[Avatar of Freya]] wants you defeat Thalgran Blightbringer by using Freya's Ward to reflect his Deathbolts back to him sevenfold.
* [[Thalgran Blightbringer]] slain
* [[Freya's Ward]] (provided)

==Description==
The agents of the [[Lich King]] have foolishly trespassed upon these lands where the power of life rules supreme. All harm they inflict will be returned to them sevenfold.

The monster directly responsible for corrupting the land is known as Thalgran Blightbringer; you will find him just to the north of here. Take this ward and use it to reflect the power of death upon him. Show the [[Scourge]] that the power of life prevails above all. 

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Cowl of the Purifier
|Scourgebane Treads
|Keeper's Touch
|Lifegiver's Ward}}
{{itembox|You will also receive:
|c1={{cost|6|50}}
|Signet of the Avenging Heart}}
* 21,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is it done, <name>?

==Completion==
You continue to prove yourself, <name>. Perhaps I was too quick to judge you.

I had assumed you were here with the poachers you were recently stranded in my lands, but perhaps you're ready to put that behind you.

==Notes==
Thalgran is at {{coords|66.7|44.1|Sholazar Basin}}, right at the falls to the north of Freya. Use the ward to reflect the deathbolts at him. Stay out of melee range and get out of the rain of fire, and you should be fine.

[[Hunters]] and [[warlock]]s beware! [[Freya's Ward]] only works if Thalgran uses his deathbolts at '''you'''. If his attack is directed at your [[hunter pet|pet]] or [[warlock minions|minion]], the reflection will fail.
