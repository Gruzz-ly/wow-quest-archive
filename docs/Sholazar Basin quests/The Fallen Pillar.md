'''The Fallen Pillar''' is a quest in the [[Waygate (location)|Waygate]] [[quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Lifeblood Pillar]] and look for clues to its destruction.

==Description==
The [[titan]]s shaped entire life forms here, fostering their unfettered growth.

The five crystal pillars that surround the basin emanate pure lifeforce. The [[Scourge]] should've never been able to penetrate the basin, but one of the pillars was destroyed.

Go to the Lifeblood Pillar and see if you can find out what happened. No [[undead]] would've been able to approach the pillar, so keep your eyes out for living intruders. You'll find what remains of the pillar directly south of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10,700 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The corpse is badly burnt. There appear to be the remains of several power kegs in the vicinity.>

==Notes==
The body is at {{coords|65.1|60.3|Sholazar Basin}}, next to the crystal on top of the mountain.  You may want to grab the side quest [[Salvaging Life's Strength]] from Freya before heading there, to save yourself a trip.
