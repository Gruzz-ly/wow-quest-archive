'''Reclamation''' is the final quest in the [[Waygate (location)|Waygate]] quest chain.  It takes place in [[Sholazar Basin]].

==Objectives==
Go to [[the Avalanche]] in [[Sholazar Basin]] and use the Omega Rune to deploy [[The Etymidian]]. Use him to slay 200 [[Scourge]] Minions, Bythius the Flesh-Shaper, Urgreth of the Thousand Tombs and Hailscorn.

Speak to the [[Avatar of Freya]] in [[Sholazar Basin]] when you've completed this task.

* Scourge Minions destroyed (200)
* [[Bythius the Flesh-Shaper]] slain
* [[Urgreth of the Thousand Tombs]] slain
* [[Hailscorn]] slain
* [[Omega Rune#Reclamation]] (provided)

==Description==
It is time, <name>. [[The Etymidian]] is one of the most destructive forces ever created by the [[titan]]s and I am loathe to unleash him in my lands.

There is little choice, however. Our enemies have forced my hand and the fury of the titans will cleanse all.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Gaze of the Punishing Construct
|Helm of the Avenging Protector
|Headguard of Vast Destruction
|Helm of Towering Rage
|Greathelm of the Titan Protectorate}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|20|40}}
* 32,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Those who would threaten life... have they been dealt with?

==Completion==
I am grateful for your help, <name>. It is my duty to watch over these lands and all life that dwells on them.

Thanks to you, that life will continue to thrive while the forces of death wage in the bordering regions.

Your actions will not be forgotten.

==Tactics==
;Generally:
* Spam [http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=50978 Colossal Strike] to hit the enemy. It has a very short cooldown and costs no mana.
* Use [http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=50980 Cataclysm] to wipe out larger numbers (i.e. more than three) of Minions. This costs some mana.
* When you are out of combat, you can quickly restore to full health with [http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=50985 Reconstruction] (costs lots of mana), and then restore to full mana with [http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=50983 Titanic Surge].

;[[Bythius the Flesh-Shaper]]: Use Colossal Strike and Cataclysm to get rid of [[Glonn]] and [[Cerberon]] and any adds. Make sure at all times you have enough mana to heal yourself if needed.

;[[Urgreth of the Thousand Tombs]]: Use Reconstruction to heal yourself when you get low. When he starts casting Dark Barrage run away to avoid the massive damage and use Reconstruction to heal and Titan Surge to get the mana back. When Urgreth is finished casting he will come at you again. Interrupt your Titan Surge before he hits you to avoid the 400% extra damage while casting Titan Surge.

;[[Hailscorn]]: Stand with your back against the mountain wall so you won't get punched down from Wing Barrage. Have enough mana at the start for at least two Cataclysms when he "calls forth an army of frozen corpses", and to use Reconstruction to heal yourself when you're low if needed.
