==Objectives==
Bring the stinger of the [[Sapphire Hive Queen|Sapphire Queen]] to [[High-Shaman Rakjak]] at [[Frenzyheart Hill]].

If you lose [[Dajik's Worn Chalk]], speak to [[Elder Harkek]] in Frenzyheart Hill.
* [[Stinger of the Sapphire Queen]]

==Description==
Bristlepine can be dangerous, but most stay far away from wolvar. Wasps on other hand not fear the Frenzyheart... they even kill some of our hunters.

I know Rakjak want wasp queen dead, but no wolvar want to go into her hive. You go kill wasp queen in Sapphire Hive to southeast and get stinger for Rakjak. Me bet Rakjak like that.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Chitin-Reinforced Hood
|Stinger-Proof Chestguard
|Insect-Filtering Faceguard
|Bug-Smashing Pauldrons}}
You will also receive: {{cost|6|50}}

==Progress==
You smell like wasp things.

==Completion==
You killed queen wasp! You stronger than Rakjak thought.

Maybe wasps go away now and stop attacking Frenzyheart hunters.
