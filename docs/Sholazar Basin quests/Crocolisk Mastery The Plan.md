== Objectives ==
Bring 5 Sandfern fronds to [[Debaar]] at the [[Nesingwary Base Camp]].
* [[Sandfern]] (5)

== Description ==
The mangal crocolisk is a master of the ambush, and I intend to beat the best at his game. To do that, we'll need to construct a convincing camouflage for you. We'll use plants that grow in the sandy soil of the riverbanks and lake beaches.

The sandfern is best for this purpose. It grows in the sandy areas near the shores of the Seabreach Flow, just to the south, Bittertide Lake and Bittertide Falls, to the north, and the edges of River's Heart, the large lake beyond the mangal to the east. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

== Progress ==
Did you bring all the ferns we'll need?

== Completion ==
<Debaar accepts the sandfern fronds from you and starts bending them around your body.>

Yes, this should work. Stand still! We'll make a bush of you yet.
