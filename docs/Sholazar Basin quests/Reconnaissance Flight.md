'''Reconnaissance Flight''' is a quick quest that sends players up to [[the Avalanche]] and back to [[River's Heart (subzone)|River's Heart]] in [[Sholazar Basin]] on [[Vic's Flying Machine]].

==Objectives==
Help [[Pilot Vic]] complete the Reconnaissance Flight.
*Reconnaissance Flight
*Speak to Pilot Vic at Lakeside Landing in Sholazar Basin.

==Description==
It's about time we had planes up and running in this place. The professor's been asking me to check out a strange weather pattern coming from the northeast.

Thing is, I'm going to need a co-pilot if we're going into uncharted territory. No way in hell I'm heading out there alone.

What do you say, <tough-guy/hotshot>? You might learn a thing or two. And once you learn to deal with the [[Cold Weather Flying|northern winds]]... you can pretty much fly anywhere. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|50}}

==Completion==
You saved my life up there, buddy. Nice flying!

==Notes==
[[File:Reconflight-gonebad.jpg|thumb|Vic's Flying Machine after the engine has blown]]
On accepting this quest, you'll automatically be launched into a flight with Pilot Vic. The plane has two abilities:
*{{abilities|Air-to-Air Rockets|Shoot at aerial enemies.}}
*{{abilities|Land Flying Machine|Allows you to safely land the flying machine at the landing pad at Lakeside Landing when you finish your flight.}}

During the flight:
:{{text|say|Pilot Vic|We're off! Watch out for those vines!}}
:{{text|say|Pilot Vic|Looks like the [[Scourge]] have hit the area pretty bad...}}
:''The [[Avatar of Freya]] comes into view, fighting against some [[Bonescythe Ravager]]s.''
:{{text|say|Pilot Vic|You see that? She's... huge!}}
:{{text|say|Pilot Vic|Here we go! Hold on tight -- there's rough wind ahead!}}
:{{text|say|Pilot Vic|The glacier is seeping in from [[Icecrown]]... and undead everywhere! Wait 'til the professor gets a hold of this!}}
:''As the plane passes over [[the Avalanche]], several [[Frosthowl Screecher]]s close in and begin attacking with bolts of dark magic.''
:{{text|say|Pilot Vic|They're coming at us! Be quick with those rockets!}}
:{{text|say|Pilot Vic|Aggggh! I'm hit! You're going to have to get us back! Quick, before the plane explodes!}}
:{{text|bossemote|The engine's blown! Fly Vic's Flying Machine back to Lakeside Landing!}}

At this point, the plane becomes controllable. The plane will gradually take damage from the engine fire, as shown by the {{abilities|Engine on Fire}} debuff. Return to Lakeside Landing before the plane's health depletes and use the Land Flying Machine ability to complete the objective.

If you don't make it back in time, the plane will eject you with a parachute, and you'll have to return to Lakeside Landing on your own to restart the flight.

==Trivia==
