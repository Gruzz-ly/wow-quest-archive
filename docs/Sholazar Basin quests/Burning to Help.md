== Objectives ==
[[Colvin Norrington]] at [[Dorian's Outpost]] wants you to take 5 Hydra Sputum Samples and kill 5 [[Bittertide Hydra]].
* Sputum Samples Collected (5)
* [[Bittertide Hydra]] slain (5)
* [[Sample Container]] (provided)

== Description ==
There's no more caustic material in all of the basin than bittertide hydra sputum. I've got special containers to collect just such a thing for [[Archmage Pentarus]]' studies. Now all I need is a brave, um... collector.

You look like a hardy, adventurous <class>. How'd you like to make a bit of money and aid [[Dalaran]]'s cause at the same time?

All you need to do is take this container with you to [[Bittertide Lake]], to the southwest. Engage the hydra and use the container to sample the sputum they shower you with. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|50}}

== Progress ==
Did you get those samples?

== Completion ==
Wonderful! Here's your payment, as agreed. And, uh, a bit of advice: you might want to enjoy long, hot baths the next few days if that 'burning sensation' persists.
