==Objectives==
[[Professor Calvert]] wants you to take the flight to [[Lakeside Landing]] and speak with [[Pilot Vic]] there.

==Description==
You did a good job helping [[Weslex Quickwrench|Wes]] with getting [[The Spirit of Gnomeregan|that flying machine]] back up and running.

If you'd like to help us further, there is an unusual weather pattern coming in from the northeast. I have a pilot ready to work for me, but I'm afraid he needs a copilot.

If you think you're up to it, you can take the flight to Lakeside Landing. Tell Vic I sent you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*690 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The professor sent you my way?  All right.
