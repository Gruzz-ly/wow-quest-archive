[[Hemet Nesingwary]] was well known for his expedition camp in [[Stranglethorn Vale]]. When the [[Dark Portal]] opened up [[Outland]] for exploration, he set up a camp in [[Nagrand]]. Later, when [[Northrend]] became available, he has set up yet another hunting camp, this time in [[Sholazar Basin]].

They may have some problems with their aircraft, and with injuries to the hunters, but they are still carrying on with their hunting.

As with the [[The Stranglethorn Safari quest chain|Stranglethorn safari]] and the [[The Nagrand Safari quest chain|Nagrand safari]], completing the final quest gains you a significant reward. As before, nice ranged weapons are offered, or a cloak for those who do not use ranged weapons. As before, this quest involves the slaughter of a large number of beasts. Skinners will find most of the quests in this set to be profitable.

And finally, completing the last quest in the series gets you the achievement [[The Snows of Northrend]].
