== Objectives ==
Offer a sample of [[Thunderbrew's Jungle Punch]] to [[Hemet Nesingwary]], [[Hadrius Harlowe]], and [[Tamara Wobblesprocket]], then return to [[Grimbooze Thunderbrew]] at the [[Nesingwary Base Camp]].
* Hemet's taste test
* Hadrius' taste test
* Tamara's taste test
* [[Jungle Punch Sample]] (provided)

== Description ==
And now for the moment of truth!

<Grimbooze chuckles.>

I've always wanted to say that. Normally, I'd debut a new drink at a banquet, but we can't have one in the middle of the jungle.

Instead, just take samples to a few trusted friends and return with their comments. Let's see, we'll definitely want Hemet Nesingwary's opinion, and Hadrius Harlowe's, too. They're here in camp. You'll want to head over to Lakeside Landing, near the center of the Basin and offer Tamara Wobblesprocket a taste. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|12|40}}
|q1=20|item1=Kungaloosh}}

== Progress ==
Don't keep me waiting, <name>. What are the results?

== Completion ==
Two out of three drinkers agree, eh? Not bad for a first try. Not bad at all. I suppose I'll have to whip up something else for Tamara by the way of apology.

Now... what should we call this creation? How about Kungaloosh? I like the sound of that!

== Notes ==
While Hemet and Hadrius are at the camp, you'll need to get to [[Lakeside Landing]] at [[River's Heart (subzone)|River's Heart]] to speak to Tamara.

You must complete the following quests before the chain is available:
*[[Dreadsaber Mastery: Becoming a Predator]]
*[[Rhino Mastery: The Test]]
