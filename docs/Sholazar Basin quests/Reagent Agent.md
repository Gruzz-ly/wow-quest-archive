== Objectives ==
Bring 5 Twisted Roc Claws to [[Colvin Norrington]] at [[Dorian's Outpost]].
* [[Twisted Roc Talon]] (5)

== Description ==
That [[Archmage Pentarus]], back in [[Dalaran]], will be expecting us to return with all kinds of reagents and talismans. It seems the locals are fond of animal parts. Twisted claws from the [[Goretalon Roc|goretalon roc]]s are among their favorite.

It's not my place to say whether the rumors are true or not, but I've a feeling there's something here.

The rocs live in the [[Bonefields]] off to the northeast, where they feed on the corpses of old mammoths. Will you help me gather talons for the archmage's research? 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Field Researcher's Boots
|Hydrafang Breeches
|Roc Hunter's Bracer
|Norrington's Burnished Breastplate}}
You will also receive: {{cost|6|50}}

== Progress ==
Were you able to find any of the twisted talons?

== Completion ==
<Colvin looks admiringly at the talons you've brought back.>

These will more than suffice. The [[gorloc]]s have a saying that the more gnarled the talon, the more power it holds. I'm sure the archmage will get his money's worth from this expedition.
