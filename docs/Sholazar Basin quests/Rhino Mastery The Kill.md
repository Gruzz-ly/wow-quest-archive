== Objectives ==
Bring [[Farunn]]'s Horn to [[Hemet Nesingwary]] at the [[Nesingwary Base Camp]].
* [[Farunn's Horn]]

== Description ==
Now that we know where to find Farunn, all that remains is the battle against the great beast. Are you ready to take on this rhino, <name>? For all the spirit's blustering, I'm certain it was telling the truth about the beast's strength.

When you're ready to face him, head north past the [[Suntouched Pillar]] and look for Farunn on the northeast shore of the [[Bittertide Lake]]. It may even venture near the [[Glimmering Pillar]]. Bring back its horn to commemorate your kill. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Nimblefoot Moccasins
|Toenail Belt
|Shaved Rhinohorn Chestguard
|Rhino-Tail Girdle}}
You will also receive: {{cost|15|87}}

== Progress ==
Did you kill the beast?

== Completion ==
<Hemet examines the horn.>

An astounding trophy from an amazing animal! <name>, I've been hearing rumors of even bigger, more ferocious game in the northern reaches of the basin and I'd like you to help us track it down.

== Notes ==
Farunn patrols between the south and southwest of the [[Glimmering Pillar]].
