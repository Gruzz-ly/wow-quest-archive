You have slain [[Pitch]], the panther that [[Tracker Gekgek]] worked hard to kill! You are now his slave and are to report to [[High-Shaman Rakjak]] at [[Frenzyheart Hill]].

This starts the ''long'' quest chain which eventually leads you to being able to choose between increasing your reputation with either [[Frenzyheart Tribe]] or the [[Oracles]] while reducing your reputation with the other of the two factions.

A lead-in quest, [[The Part-time Hunter]] points here and functions as a breadcrumb.

==Objectives==
Report to [[High-Shaman Rakjak]] at [[Frenzyheart Hill]] as the new "slave." 

==Description==
My kill! You take my kill!

<Gekgek taunts you with his spear.>

You dumb, <race>. Now you owe Gekgek! You be [[Frenzyheart Tribe|Frenzyheart]] slave. You slay many more beasts for Frenzyheart.

You go [[Frenzyheart Hill]] to northeast - you tell High-Shaman Rakjak you the new slave.

Go, <race>! Go or I taunt you a second time!

<Gekgek waves his spear around menacingly.>

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|66}}

==Completion==
You the new slave?

Good. We running out.

==Notes==
Gekgek's final words to the player are an homage to those of the French Soldier to King Arthur and his men in ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'."

Killing Pitch opens this quest, so if you can't pick it up, kill Pitch and it will be available.
