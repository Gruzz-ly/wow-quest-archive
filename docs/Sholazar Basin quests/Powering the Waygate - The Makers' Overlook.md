'''Powering the Waygate - The Makers' Overlook''' is a quest in the [[Waygate (location)|Waygate]] quest chain in [[Sholazar Basin]].

==Objectives==
The [[Avatar of Freya]] wants you to head to the [[Makers' Overlook]] in eastern Sholazar Basin and use the Activation Switch Theta.
* [[Activation Switch Theta]]

==Description==
We cannot stop now, <race>. You've triggered the first switch, but one remains.

The [[titans]] constructed a second vantage point where they oversaw their creations. You'll find it to the east, high in the mountains.

Pull the activation switch theta inside the overlook and the [[Waygate (location)|waygate]] will open.

==Rewards==
* 21,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The waygate is active, <name>. It is time!

==Notes==
The [[Makers' Overlook]] is southwest of [[the Avalanche]], at {{coords|80|54|Sholazar Basin}}. You'll need a [[flying mount]] to reach it.  The switch is in the back.

You may want to grab the quest [[A Timeworn Coffer]] from the ledge outside the Overlook before entering it.

Kill the non-elite [[Sholazar Guardian]]s and avoid the elite guard to reach the switch.
