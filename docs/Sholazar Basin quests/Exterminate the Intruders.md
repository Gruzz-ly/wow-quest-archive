'''Exterminate the Intruders''' is a quest in the [[Waygate (location)|Waygate]] quest chain in [[Sholazar Basin]].

==Objectives==
The [[Avatar of Freya]] at the [[Rainspeaker Rapids]] wants you to go to the [[Death's Hand Encampment|Cultist Encampment]] to the northwest and slay 8 Cultist Infiltrators.
* [[Cultist Infiltrator]] slain (8)

==Description==
I am an embodiment of but one aspect of [[Freya]], daughter of the [[titans]]. I am the Lifewarden—I was left here to protect this land against the threat of the [[Scourge]].

I never anticipated the [[Lich King]] would send [[Cult of the Damned|willing living servants]] to do his work.

I could easily crush these cultists myself, but I am all that stands between the undead armies and the rest of the basin. Go, <name>. Deliver my wrath to these insolent trespassers. 

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Lifewarden's Raiment
|Helm of the Ancient Horn
|Treads of Bound Life
|Wristguards of Titanic Vengeance}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|6|50}}
*21,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you destroyed the trespassers, <name>?

==Completion==
You speak the truth. The intruders at the camp were dealt with... but I'm afraid it might have been too late.

==Notes==
The cultist camp is at {{coords|57|41|Sholazar Basin}}.  The cultists drop small bombs, which you'll want to avoid.

==Progression==
{{:Quest:Force of Nature}}
