==Objectives==
Help [[Engineer Helice]] escape from [[Swindlegrin's Dig]], then speak with [[Hemet Nesingwary]] at the [[Nesingwary Base Camp]].
* Escort Engineer Helice out of Swindlegrin's Dig

==Description==
These goblin goons and their minions have decided that they own this pillar and its crystals. I came here to explore the crystals and take samples, but they overpowered me and won't let me return to the camp.

If you'll help me fight our way out of here, we can teach these thugs a lesson they'll never forget! 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Completion==
Thank you for freeing Helice and seeing to her safe return. We all started to get worried when she didn't return from her crystal hunting trip.

==Notes==

:''Engineer Helice sets off the explosives near where she was being detained, blowing up the large crystal in the middle of the dig.''
:{{text|say|Engineer Helice|It's getting a little hot over here. Shall we move on?}}
:{{text|say|Engineer Helice|Oh, look, it's another cartload of explosives! Let's help them dispose of it.}}
:''Helice sets off the big cache of explosives.''
:{{text|say|Engineer Helice|You really shouldn't play with this stuff. Someone could get hurt.}}
:{{text|say|Engineer Helice|We made it! Thank you for getting me out of that hell hole. Tell Hemet to expect me!}}
