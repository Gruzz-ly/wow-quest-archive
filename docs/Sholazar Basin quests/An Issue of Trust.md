'''An Issue of Trust''' is the second quest of the [[Waygate (location)|Waygate]] [[quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Obtain [[Avatar of Freya|Freya]]'s trust by destroying 6 Blighted Corpses and 10 Bonescythe Ravagers in [[the Lost Lands]].
*[[Blighted Corpse]] slain (6)
*[[Bonescythe Ravager]] slain (10)

==Description==
This should never have happened. The forces of undeath storm the very cradle of life!

If you're not here to destroy the minions of the [[Lich King]], then leave at once. Do not incur my wrath by distracting me from my duties. 

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Binding of Purified Corpses
|Splattered Zombie Wristguards
|Skeleton Smashers
|Preservative-Stained Gauntlets}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*26,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do not waste my time, mortal. The [[titans]]' creations must be defended!

==Completion==
Very well, <race>. I am satisfied that you're not one of the Lich King's minions... perhaps there is something you can do for us after all.

==Progression==
{{:Quest:Force of Nature}}
