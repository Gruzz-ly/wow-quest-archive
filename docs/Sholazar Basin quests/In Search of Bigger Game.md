'''In Search of Bigger Game''' begins the conclusion of [[Hemet Nesingwary]]'s expedition to [[Northrend]].

== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Dorian Drakestalker]] at [[Dorian's Outpost|Dorian's Camp]]. 

== Description ==
Well, <name>, you've certainly proven your mettle as a hunter of all kinds of game animals—rhinos, cats, and crocolisks. For some members of the expedition, these creatures are sufficient to test their hunting skills, but others, like myself, crave larger challenges.

Dorian Drakestalker went north, across Bittertide Lake and established a camp there. He's heard rumors of gigantic primordial drakes. Just imagine what a quarry they would be! Go check up on Dorian and see if he's had any luck. 

== Completion ==
So old Hemet didn't forget about me, after all. I suppose he's going to want to participate in the hunt once we've done all the hard work. Don't worry, there are plenty of drakes to go around. Hemet will get his wish.
