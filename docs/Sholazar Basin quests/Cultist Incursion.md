'''Cultist Incursion''' is a quest in the [[Waygate (location)|Waygate]] [[quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Speak to the [[Avatar of Freya]] at the [[Rainspeaker Rapids]]. 

==Description==
<It appears the Avatar of Freya was right. The undead were not able to enter Sholazar Basin before the [[Lifeblood Pillar]] was brought down—they used their living agents from the [[Cult of the Damned]] instead.>

<You'd best warn her about the [[Lich King]]'s living agents within Sholazar Basin.> 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|80}}
*16,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The living... willingly serve the [[Lich King]]?

All this time I've been searching for the wrong enemy, <race>. Let us make haste and uproot these cultists from these lands.

==Progression==

==Patch changes==
