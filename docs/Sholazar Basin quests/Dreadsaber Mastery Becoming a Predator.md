==Objectives==
Kill 15 Dreadsabers and return to [[Buck Cantwell]] at the [[Nesingwary Base Camp]].
*[[Dreadsaber]] slain (15)

==Description==
If you've hunted with [[Hemet Nesingwary|Hemet]] before, you know that he's tested his skill against many large cats, but the dreadsabers here in [[Sholazar Basin|Sholazar]] are different. They're able to bring down larger game than I've ever seen a cat hunt. To overcome and kill such a predator is the mark of a true hunter.

If you seek to prove you're up to the challenge, test yourself against the dreadsabers. They live in the wilderness surrounding the camp and south of the river. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Progress==
Have you tested your skills against the dreadsabers?

==Completion==
Well, you've proved yourself a capable hunter, but how are you as a tracker?
