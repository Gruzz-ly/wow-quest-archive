'''Back Through the Waygate''' is a quest in the [[Waygate (location)|Waygate]] quest chain.  It takes place in [[Un'Goro Crater]] and [[Sholazar Basin]].

==Objectives==
Bring the Omega Rune to the [[Avatar of Freya]] at the [[Rainspeaker Rapids]] in [[Sholazar Basin]].
* [[Omega Rune]] (provided)

==Description==
You speak the truth, <race>. I can sense the very essence of Sholazar Basin begin to fray by the [[Scourge|blight of undeath]] even as we speak.

I've bound my being into the rune, <race>. Deliver it to she who sent you here—for only her power can grant me passage to her lands. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|30}}
*16,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You've returned, <name>.

==Completion==
You've done well.

Woe unto our enemies. Woe unto those who serve the [[Lich King]] and threaten the [[titans]]' creations—for the Etymidian is here.

==Notes==
As the quest title suggests, the easiest way back to the Avatar of Freya is through the [[Waygate (location)|waygate]].

==Progression==
