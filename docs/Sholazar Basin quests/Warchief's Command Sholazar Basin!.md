==Objectives==
Speak with [[Archmage Pentarus]] in [[Dalaran]] over [[Crystalsong Forest]].

==Description==
All able-bodied members of the [[Horde]] are hereby ordered to report to Archmage Pentarus in Dalaran over Crystalsong Forest.

[[Hemet Nesingwary]], along with his expeditionary force, was sent to explore [[Sholazar Basin]], but has gone missing.

We do not know much about the lush landscape of Sholazar, but there might be secrets in the basin that can give us an advantage in our fight against the [[Lich King]].

For the Horde!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||74|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I am glad you're here, <race>. Hemet has not been heard from for quite some time, and I could really use your help finding him.

==Progression==
