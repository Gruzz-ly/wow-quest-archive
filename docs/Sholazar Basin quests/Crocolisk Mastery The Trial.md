== Objectives ==
Kill 15 Mangal Crocolisks and return to [[Debaar]] at the [[Nesingwary Base Camp|Nesingwary Encampment]].
* [[Mangal Crocolisk]] slain (15)

== Description ==
I warn you, stranger—do not make any comments about crashing the ship. I already get enough of it from the rest of the expedition.

If you're looking to try your hand at hunting, though, you should test your skills against the wily mangal [[crocolisk]]s. They live all along the river to the south, and in the [[Wildgrowth Mangal]] to the east. Prove you can hold your own against them and we'll talk again, hunter. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

== Progress ==
Did you make the kills?

== Completion ==
Impressive, <class>. Are you certain you're not a member of the expedition?

No, I'm certain of it. There would've been a crash joke in there somewhere.
