== Description ==
We try to be nice to puppy-men ever since they came, but they nothing but mean.

We okay with them being dumb - they not do much harm. Now they mess with sacred shrines though. Sacred shrines not for messing with. The Great Stones are here from all the way back when the Great Ones made us.

We wouldn't know what to do if the Great Mist Stone were hurt. Go to their camp to north... make puppy-men stop and not come back!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|50}}

== Progress ==
They always want fight! We no want fight, but we need to protect sacred stuffs.

== Completion ==
You squash good. Thank you for help.
