==Objectives==
[[High-Oracle Soo-say]] at [[Rainspeaker Canopy]] wants you to give a peace offering to [[Shaman Vekjik]] and then return with his response.

If you lose [[Lafoo's Bug Bag]], speak to [[High-Oracle Soo-say]] in [[Rainspeaker Canopy]].
* Extend Peace Offering to Shaman Vekjik
* [[Rainspeaker Peace Offering]] (provided)

==Description==
We have great idea. You were friends with [[Wolvar|puppy-men]], they maybe listen to you.

We want you to go to other side of south river over near the end at the big hole and give offering to Shaman Vekjik. Tell puppy-man we no want fight. Tell him we play nice.

You good <race>. We trust you do this right.

{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Drape of the Offered Branch
|Cloak of the Buzzing Swarm
|Lightning Beetle's Cape
|Cloak of the Hardened Tortoise}}
You will also receive: {{cost|6|50}}

==Progress==
Puppy-men play nice now?

==Completion==
So mean! We only be nice and they only be mean.

They keep messing with great stones... maybe they not know great stones are sacred.

==Notes==
Shaman Vekjik is overlooking [[River's Heart (subzone)|River's Heart]] up on the '''eastern''' edge {{coords|51.30|64.65|Sholazar Basin}}. He does not have a question mark.

Conversation goes as follow:
:Disgusting big-tongue friend, you no belong here. Go from Frenzyheart land or I call magic stuffs to kill you!
:{{gossip|Shaman Vekjik, I have spoken with the big-tongues and they desire peace. I have brought this offering on their behalf.}}
:Frenzyheart never be friends of big-tongues. You dumb to come back here traitor thing!
:{{gossip|No no... I had no intentions of betraying your people. I was only defending myself. It was all a misunderstanding.}}
: {{text|say|Shaman Vekjik|Frenzyheart kill you if you come back.  You no welcome here no more!}}
Vekjik casts Frenzyheart's Fury, which throws you into the lake, and the quest is complete. 
* Note: Make sure you have Water Walking abilities turned OFF before he throws you!
