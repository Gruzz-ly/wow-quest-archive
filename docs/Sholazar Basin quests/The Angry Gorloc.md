== Objectives ==
Travel to [[Mosswalker Village]] and speak to [[Moodle]] once you've arrived.

If you lose [[Moodle's Stress Ball]], speak to [[High-Oracle Soo-say]] in [[Rainspeaker Canopy]].
* Travel to Mosswalker Village.

== Description ==
I not think you be back in time to go out again, but I wrong. I sending Moodle to nearby Mosswalker friends to bop silly Mosswalkers for not coming see shrine. Their village is east, up ridge, northeast of broken pillar.

You go with Moodle! He extra smart Rainspeaker... you listen to him good-like. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|3|30}}

== Progress ==
Soo-say fumbles a bit, but he's not dumb. I do think he's been far too forgiving though... the puppy-men are not going to stop or leave us alone. The only way to stop them is to kill them... there is no "peace."

<Moodle puffs up his chest and points to himself.>

That I am good at.

== Completion ==
Before you say anything, do not assume me as foolish as most of the Oracles you've met. I've been into the world a bit, I've learned your language, and I'm not easily duped.

I knew the Mosswalkers were dead before we ever came, though I didn't know that the undead were behind it.

They are not supposed to be able to enter this land... the destruction of the [[Lifeblood Pillar]] must have allowed them in somehow. We must see to it that they leave.
