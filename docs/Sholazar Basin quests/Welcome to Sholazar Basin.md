==Objectives==
Follow the path to the northwest to reach [[Nesingwary Base Camp|the camp]] that [[Monte Muzzleshot|Monte]] mentioned.

==Description==
So, where did you come from? I don't suppose that fool of an archmage sent you, too?

You're lucky to be in one piece, <laddie/lass>! They nearly blew you up!

The jungle here's a darned dangerous place, 'specially with the [[Venture Company]] about.

Git you! Go see the boss... he'll sort you out. The camp's at the end of that path to the northwest.

Now, git!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3|10}}

==Completion==
Hah! It's not often you run into a complete stranger in the middle of the jungle.

You one of those [[druid]] lackeys sent to "[[Druids for the Ethical and Humane Treatment of Animals|stop me and my evil ways?]]" Yeah, good luck with that one!

<Hemet lets out a hearty laugh and pats his gun.>

Didn't think so! You're more than welcome to join us in the hunt, soon as we've dealt with those Venture Company dogs. There'll be plenty to go around.
