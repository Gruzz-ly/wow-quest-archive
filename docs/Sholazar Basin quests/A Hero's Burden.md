==Objectives==
Kill [[Artruis the Heartless]].

[[Moodle]] will not be able to accompany you on this task.
* [[Artruis the Heartless]] slain

==Description==
Perhaps the crystals will ward off the undead gradually, but there is one more thing that must be done.

We need to find the leader of these undead and kill him to ensure there's no one to push the wretches back upon us. If my suspicions are correct, he will be somewhere inside the fallen pillar... [[the Sundered Shard]].

The corpses being dragged there would suggest as much anyway.

I'll place the shards and bring the news to [[High-Oracle Soo-say|Soo-say]]... I'll leave the rest up to you.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Choker of Binding
|Blood-Infused Pendant
|Artruis's Focus Stone
|Spiked Collar of Servitude}}
You will also receive: {{cost|19|50}}

==Progress==
<The phylactery rests ominously on the ground next to Artruis' dead form.>

==Completion==
<Inside Artruis's Phylactery you see what seems like an endless void... and you think you hear screaming in the distance from somewhere inside.>

<As you're about to leave, you see an object floating in the void, just barely in reach.>

==Notes==
Artruis is a level 77 elite lich, found inside a cave at {{coords|72.2|57.4|Sholazar Basin}} east of [[The Lifeblood Pillar]]. He is very powerful, but a prot warrior or a frost mage (possibly other classes) can solo his encounter. Mid-fight you might be assisted by players off-group and even from oposite faction, since they are there to kill the lich as well.

Killing Artruis comes in three phases. 

'''Phase one''':
* Artruis will stand at the back of the cave with a [[wolvar]], [[Zepik the Gorloc Hunter]], and a [[gorloc]], [[Jaloot]] on either side. When starting the encounter he will occasionally cast frost bolt, frost nova and ice lance to try and kill you, and also engage in melee.

'''Phase two''':
* Artruis protects himself in ice and frees Zepik and Jaloot, turning them against you. '''Killing one of the NPCs allows you to align with the other faction after the fight''', so choose wisely which one you want to become aligned with.

'''Phase three''':
* Starts when either the gorloc or wolvar is down. The one who is still alive will aid you in killing Artruis, and will do so for the rest of the battle.

Artruis cannot be stunned nor silenced nor interrupted. Frostbolt is reflectable.

===Bug===
* Appears to be bugged circa [[Patch 3.0.8]] as all 3 mobs can get shielded and basically immune to attack.<ref>http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14990651652&sid=1</ref>
* Sometimes he despawns mid-fight without explanation. The two little NPC's despawn as well and you have to wait for him to respawn so you can try again.
