==Objectives==
[[Oracle Soo-nee|Soo-nee]] at [[Rainspeaker Canopy]] wants you to use the Didgeridoo of Contemplation at the top of the [[Glimmering Pillar]], the [[Suntouched Pillar]], the [[Mosslight Pillar]] and the [[Skyreach Pillar]].
* Contemplation at Glimmering Pillar
* Contemplation at Suntouched Pillar
* Contemplation at Mosslight Pillar
* Contemplation at Skyreach Pillar
* [[Didgeridoo of Contemplation]] (provided)

==Description==
Of course you not as smart as gorloc! You just simple <race>.

You not without hope, though! You show you can learn. Maybe crystals make you smart like crystals make us smart!

I teach you to play song to clear your mind. You play song by crystals then crystals make your mind better... not as good as gorloc's but better than you have now. Lifeblood Pillar is broken, but other pillars still good! 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

or

{{cost|13|23}} at 80.

==Completion==
You see?  I can tell you smarter already.  And if not smarter... then... happier!

==Notes==
After receiving the item, you are to fly to the top of each pillar (minus the Lifeblood pillar) and stand near the crystals on top and use the [[Didgeridoo of Contemplation]] to count towards quest completion. Rough coordinates for each pillar are:
*Glimmaring Pillar{{coords|49.6|37.4|Sholazar Basin}}
*Suntouched Pillar{{coords|33.3|52.3|Sholazar Basin}}
*Mosslight Pillar{{coords|36.4|75.3|Sholazar Basin}}
