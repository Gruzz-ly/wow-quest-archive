Completing this quest unlocks the majority of the quests for this hub, including [[Kick, What Kick?]], [[Dreadsaber Mastery: Becoming a Predator]], and [[Rhino Mastery: The Test]].

==Objectives==
Kill Foreman Swindlegrin and Meatpie and return to [[Debaar]] at the [[Nesingwary Base Camp]].
* [[Foreman Swindlegrin]] slain
* [[Meatpie]] slain

==Description==
We must send Foreman Swindlegrin packing if we're going to shut down his mine permanently, but be careful. His bodyguard, Meatpie, is a large, mean [[ogre]], and isn't likely to let you see the foreman without a fight.

The two probably occupy a platform that would let them look out over the entire [[Venture Company]] operation at [[Swindlegrin's Dig]].

Remember, the dig is on the far side of the [[Suntouched Pillar]] to the northeast. Good luck, <name>. 

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Have you dealt with Swindlegrin and his bodyguard?

==Completion==
What a relief to hear that the Venture Company will trouble us no more. You have my thanks, and that of [[Hemet Nesingwary|Hemet]] for dealing with this problem. A game hunter cannot, in good conscience, lift her weapon against another person.
