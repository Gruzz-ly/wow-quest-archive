==Objectives==
Find your way back to [[Frenzyheart Hill]] and speak to [[High-Shaman Rakjak]]. 

==Description==
Okay, we done! Time to go back. No crocolisk to ride this time though.

If we go east and stay near ridge, it should lead all the way back near hill.

Need to be careful not to go far below ridge though or we might go right into big-tongue tree village thing. Zepik not think they like us right now. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|50}}

==Completion==
Blown up by lightning?

<Rakjak breaks out laughing for a moment.>

You good hunter. Rakjak like you. Maybe one day you can be honorary Frenzyheart!

Only maybe though!
