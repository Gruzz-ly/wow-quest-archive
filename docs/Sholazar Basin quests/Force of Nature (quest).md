'''Force of Nature''' is an optional lead-in [[quest]] for the [[Waygate (location)|Waygate]] [[quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Blight Line]], between [[Rainspeaker Rapids]] and [[the Lost Lands]] in [[Sholazar Basin]] and seek the [[Avatar of Freya]].

==Description==
I'm not sure about what [[Pilot Vic|I]] saw while flying to the northeast, but to me it looked like a gigantic woman kicking some [[Scourge]] butt.

I'd heard the professor talk about a certain "lifewarden" appointed by the [[titans]] to look over Sholazar. I might not be a titan historian, but it sounds like she fits the bill.

I also know that if the Scourge cross the border between the Lost Lands and the rest of Sholazar, our expedition's as good as dead. What do you say you go look for her and lend a hand?

==Rewards==
* 2150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You are not of this land. But you also are not with the Scourge.

What should I make of you?

==Notes==
You must have [[Cold Weather Flying]] learned in order to start this quest. If you do not have it then it will not appear. You can buy it from [[Pilot Vic|Vic]] right there or from flight trainers in [[Dalaran]] and [[:Cold Weather Flying#Trainers|other places]].
