'''Need an Engine, Take an Engine''' is the prerequisite quest to [[Have a Part, Give a Part]] which spawns the Nesingwary Base Camp flight master, and leads to the Weapon of the Ancients quest chain.

==Objectives==
[[Weslex Quickwrench]] at the [[Nesingwary Base Camp]] wants you to bring him a Flying Machine Engine.
* [[Flying Machine Engine]]

==Description==
She's ruined... ruined! I told that captain to be careful with such a precious cargo, but would she listen to me? No!

When the ship ran aground, it damaged my flying machine, [[the Spirit of Gnomeregan]]. Now, we're left without any means to send our reports!

There is a chance, though, that the [[Venture Company]]'s antics may work in our favor. They shot down another flying machine right about where [[Monte Muzzleshot|Monte]] parachuted into the swamp to the east. Go there and retrieve the engine. It may be our only hope. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|80}}

==Progress==
Well, were you able to get the engine? I just know that the archmage who funded the expedition is getting nervous.

==Completion==
There... just set it down there. Be careful! If you ruin this one, we're in big trouble. Now, let's see what I can do.

==Notes==
The Flying Machine Engine is located at {{coords|38.7|56.7|Sholazar Basin}}
