==Objectives==
[["Shotgun" Jones]] wants you to speak with [[Hemet Nesingwary]] at the [[Nesingwary Safari]] on the outskirts of northeast [[Nagrand]].

==Description==
"Go out and find us some supplies," he said. I was nearly killed about 15 times before I found this place! These [[Broken]] might not be the most hospitable bunch but at least they're not trying to tear my skin from my bones.

Anyway, I'm not going back. My days of huntin' big game are over. If you end up heading northeast towards [[Zangarmarsh]] and run into the Nesingwary Safari, let them know that "Shotgun" quit. 

Hey, maybe you can take my place! Good luck, stranger.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1100 [[XP]] (or {{cost||66|}} at max level)

==Completion==
I suppose we'll have to find a replacement water boy. Say, you look like a powerful <class>. Interested in a job? Or did you come for the hunt?

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
