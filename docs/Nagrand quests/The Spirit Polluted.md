==Objectives==
[[File:The Spirit Polluted TCG.jpg|thumb|In the [[TCG]].]]
[[Elementalist Lo'ap]] at the [[Throne of the Elements]] in [[Nagrand]] wants you to destroy [[Watoosun's Polluted Essence]] and 10 [[Lake Surger]]s.
* [[Watoosun's Polluted Essence]] slain
* [[Lake Surger]] slain (8)

==Description==
Watoosun was able to shed the stink of corruption; but in doing so, created a twisted spirit essence. A spirit essence composed of the vilest corruption found amongst the elements!

You will find this polluted spirit of the swamp southwest of here, hidden in the depths of Lake Sunspring.

Find and destroy the polluted essence of Watoosun and any corrupt offspring that it may have created.

==Rewards==

}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|7|}}
* 11,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Earthen Ring will help in any way possible.

==Completion==
The elements sang of your victory the moment the disturbed essence was destroyed! The Earthen Ring thanks you and wishes for you to choose a reward.

==Notes==
The Throne of Elements is just north of [[Garadar]] on the other side of the lake. At 33, 50 right in the middle of the lake is where you will find [[Watoosun's Polluted Essence]]. The [[Lake Surger]]s are all over the lake itself and hard to miss.
