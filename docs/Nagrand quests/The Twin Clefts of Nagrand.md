Mo'mor the Breaker at [[Telaar]] in [[Nagrand]] has asked that you slay 25 Boulderfist Warriors and 25 Boulderfist Mages.
*[[Boulderfist Warrior]] slain (25)

==Description==
You made a strong showing, <name>. Are you ready for more?

I have received reports of a large contingent of Boulderfist ogres hidden in the twin clefts of [[Nagrand]], northwest of here in the Halaani Basin.

Venture forth to the clefts and deal with the remaining Boulderfist ogres.
