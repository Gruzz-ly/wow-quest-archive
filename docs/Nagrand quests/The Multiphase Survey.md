==Objectives==
[[Harbinger Haronem]] in [[Shattrath City]] wants you to use the Multiphase Spectrographic Goggles to take 6 Multiphase Readings.
* Multiphase Readings (6)
* [[Multiphase Spectrographic Goggles]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm sure [[Whirligig Wafflefry|that]] '[[gnomish inventor]]' is a crackpot. He was babbling about some red clouds that have begun to appear in the [[Spirit Fields]] around [[Oshu'gun]] in [[Nagrand]].

According to him, these, uh, multiphase... um... spectro-something goggles will allow the wearer to see the clouds and take readings from them. He insisted that recording this data was fundamental to our campaign at the [[Sunwell]]. I think he's nuts, but I'm under orders to investigate anything that might help. Would you mind taking some readings?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3|40}} (or {{cost|9|10}} at maximum level)

==Progress==
Did you get those readings? That gnome will scream at me again if I don't get his precious data.

==Completion==
Thanks for your help. You don't know what it's like to deal with "Doctor" [[Whirligig Wafflefry|Wafflefry]] over there. In between his "checkups" on my progress, he's busy hawking some gadget or another derived from his military inventions.

==Notes==
[[File:Nagrand Multiphase Disturbance.jpg|thumb|A Multiphase Disturbance.]]
Equip the [[Multiphase Spectrographic Goggles]] once you get close to [[Oshu'gun]].  Doing so will replace your character's headgear with the goggles (the headgear will be in the pack instead).

Wandering red clouds, much like the engineering mote extractors are designed to extract, are on all sides of [[Oshu'gun]].  When you're in range of a Multiphase Disturbance, open the Character display (press <C>) then use the goggles by clicking the Right Mouse Button on the Head slot.  Note that there is a 10-second cooldown between uses.

Since your character is likely more vulnerable while not wearing his or her regular headgear, you might want to avoid combat with the population of demons, Clefthoof beasts, and the like. ;-)

If you are an Engineer and use goggles anyway, or have your head armor graphics turned off, don't forget to reequip your armor after finishing the quest!

===Warning===
If you equip the goggles outside Nagrand, you might not be able to see the clouds when you arrive and will have to re-equip the goggles closer to Oshu'gun.
