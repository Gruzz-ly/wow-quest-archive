==Objectives==
Escort the [[Mag'har Captive]] out of Sunspring Post. Speak to [[Garrosh]] at [[Garadar]] if you succeed.
*Free the Mag'har Captive

==Description==
Thank you, stranger. They would have surely killed me had it not been for you.

I was kidnapped by these Murkbloods 3 nights ago during a nighttime raid on [[Garadar]]. What I have since uncovered may very well shake the foundation of the Outland: these savages seek to recover the totem of Kar'dash! We cannot allow the totem to fall into the hands of the Murkbloods!

You must help me escape. And stranger, if I do not make it back to [[Garadar]], you must tell [[Garrosh]] what happened here...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*14600 [[XP]] (or {{cost|8|76|}} at max level)
*+700 [[reputation]] with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]

==Progress==
<Garrosh barely acknowledges your presence. He appears deeply depressed.>

==Completion==
What does it matter? The Greatmother is dying. Life is not worth living...

==Notes==
*At the first turn in Sunspring Post, the Mag'har Captive will scream "FROST SHOCK!!!", a reference to the famous "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpoGKw6L4cM Realm Switcher]" video.
*You must complete this quest to unlock the [[Greatmother Geyah]] quest chain.
*Upon successfully escorting the Mag'har Captive out from the ruined village, he will say the following:
:{{text|say|It is best that we split up now, in case they send more after us. Hopefully one of us will make it back to Garrosh. Farewell, stranger.}}

==Patch changes==
