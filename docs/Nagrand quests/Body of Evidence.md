==Objectives==
[[Lantresor of the Blade]] at the [[Burning Blade Ruins]] in [[Nagrand]] wants you to use the [[Damp Woolen Blanket]] at the [[Blazing Warmaul Pyre]] in the Laughing Skull Courtyard to signal his ogres.
* Kil'sorrow Bodies Planted: 1/1

==Description==
Your rampage through Kil'sorrow Fortress has provided us with a special opportunity. We have enough bodies to make it appear as if a great battle has taken place.

Travel to the Laughing Skull Ruins and find the Laughing Skull Courtyard. There should be a blazing pyre in the courtyard. Make sure the area is secure and then use this blanket to send up smoke signals. When my ogres see the smoke, they will sneak in and plant the bodies of slain Kil'sorrow soldiers.

That should be the final straw!

==Progress==
Do you now understand why you could never win a war against me?

==Completion==
I must admit, I have not felt this alive in decades. You have performed well, <name>.

==Reward==
You will receive:
*{{cost|g=7|s=|c=}}
*11300 xp

==Notes==
Once the player has used the [[Damp Woolen Blanket]], two {{Reputation|friendly}} [[Boulderfist Saboteur]]s (level 64) will spawn nearby, chatting as they plant the slain Kil'sorrow soldiers. Random remarks include:
