==Description==
This fight is gonna be painful, <name>. Do you have any friends that are brave enough to help you out? The [[ogre]]s managed to get a giant from [[Blade's_Edge_Mountains|Blade's Edge]] named Rokdar! Trust me, you're gonna need friends, he seems unbeatable! He's hard as a rock - literally!

==Progress==
The fight's over when you or your opponent are dead on the floor.

==Completion==
You've got the ogres sweatin', kid! Here's a little something extra this time - don't use 'em all in one place.

Are you ready for another fight? Gurgthock's bettin' the bank on you!

==Notes==
Round three of [[The Ring of Blood]]. This time you will be facing Rokdar, a level 66 elite [[Colossus]]. Straight forward fight, with the exception of a knockback attack that he does. Have the tank start the event, to get initial aggro.
