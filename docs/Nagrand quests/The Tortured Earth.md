==Objectives==
[[Gordawg]] at the [[Throne of the Elements]] in [[Nagrand]] has asked that you destroy 15 Tortured Earth Spirits.
*[[Tortured Earth Spirit|Tortured Earth Spirit]] slain (15)

==Description==
Bring up the usurper. You will find him. Follow earthen path. First you put to rest tortured earth spirits. Must sleep once more.

<Gordawg smashes his fist into the ground and brings up very foul smelling soil.>

Must sleep!

<Gordawg points southeast.>

Find spirits near mountains. Near hills. Near rocks. Near earth.

Put to sleep.

[[Telaari Basin]]... Southeast.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*11000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Do they sleep?

==Completion==
<Gordawg nods in approval.>

Good. Spirits sleep now.

==Notes==
Gordawg is apparently not familiar with Azerothian concepts of direction. Southeast of the Throne of Elements is [[Shattrath]] and the Murkblood village. The Telaari basin that he's referring to is straight south.
