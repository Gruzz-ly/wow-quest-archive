==Objectives==
Otonbu the Sage at [[Telaar]] in [[Nagrand]] wants you to use the Torch of Liquid Fire to destroy 10 Sunspring Villager corpses. Return the Torch of Liquid Fire when the task is complete.
*[[Sunspring Villager]] (10)
*[[Torch of Liquid Fire]] (provided)

==Description==
I have just gotten word of a catastrophe of epic proportions, <name>. The foul Murkblood have sacked the orc village of Sunspring Post, northwest of here, and murdered its residents. To make matters worse, they have begun dumping the bodies into Sunspring Lake. Should those bodies rot, our primary source of water in the region will be compromised.

It's a gruesome task that I give you next but it must be done. Take this enchanted torch and return to Sunspring. Burn all of the rotting orc corpses...

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Warcaster's Scaled Leggings|Murkblood Avenger's Chestplate|Melia's Lustrous Crown}}
You will also receive:
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at max level)
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Kurenai]]

==Progress==
The orcs will not understand what we are doing but it must be done. For the good of both orc and Broken.

==Completion==
<Otonbu sighs.>

This will set back any chance of peace with the orcs another 10 years. At least we will be around to see those years as opposed to what could have happened had those corpses been allowed to rot.
