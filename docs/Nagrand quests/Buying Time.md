== Objectives ==
[[Altruis the Sufferer]] in western [[Nagrand]] has asked that you kill 2 Felguard Legionnaires, 3 Mo'arg Engineers and 8 Gan'arg Tinkerers.
*[[Felguard Legionnaire]] (2)
*[[Mo'arg Engineer]] (3)
*[[Gan'arg Tinkerer]] (8)

==Description==
As long as the transporters stand, nothing we do to the [[Forge site|forge camps]] will have any permanence. We must find a way to destroy the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] structures.

I need time to devise a plan of attack. If you can keep their [[engineer]]s and [[tinker]]ers busy, it would greatly slow down their progress, buying me the time I need.

Stay as far away as possible from the overseers, <name>. They are extremely dangerous beings.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12000 [[XP]]
*{{cost|7|20}} at level 70.

==Progress==
Back so soon?

==Completion==
It is as I suspected. There are no conventional means of destroying fel steel. All is not lost, however...

==Notes==
If you are a warlock, enslaving Felguard Legionnaire will let you easily solo this quest.

==Progression==
{{Nagrand Forge Camp}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
