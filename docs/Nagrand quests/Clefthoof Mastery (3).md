This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Nagrand Safari}} quest chain, leading to the [[Hills Like White Elekk]] achievement.

[[Hemet Nesingwary]] in [[Nagrand]] wants you to kill [[Banthar]] and bring her horn to him.

==Objectives==
Acquire the Horn of Banthar and return it to Hemet Nesingwary at the [[Nesingwary Safari]] in [[Nagrand]].
*[[Horn of Banthar]]

==Description==
[[Banthar]] is the fiercest and most elusive of all the [[clefthoof]] in [[Outland]]. She's also the hairiest.

It is said that she roams with her clefthoof herd in the [[Spirit Fields|Field of Spirits]] near [[Oshu'gun]].

You want to truly prove your hunting mastery? Bring me her horn!

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox| |Clefthoof Gloves (reward)|Clefthoof Wristguards|Clefthoof Helm}}

*You will also receive:
*{{cost|7|40|}}
*14600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
A warm fire and a man at your side for idle chit-chat is something you can get at home. Here we hunt big game or die trying.

==Completion==
You did it! You took down Banthar! I never had a doubt, <name>.

Here, I think you've more than earned this.

==Notes==
Banthar is located around Oshu'Gun in Southwestern Nagrand, near the road. (As the quest says)
