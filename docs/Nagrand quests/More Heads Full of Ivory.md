==Objectives==
I still have a need for more pairs of ivory tusks from the wild elekk that roam this land. &nbsp;Unfortunately, my budget will no longer handle your cut of the profits. &nbsp;If you continue to provide me what I need, however, you will be ingratiating yourself with the Consortium. 
*[[Pair of Ivory Tusks]] (3)

==Completion==
Excellent, more fine tusk specimens, though some look a bit dingy.

You have the far-reaching gratitude of the Consortium, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
