==Objectives==
Arechron at [[Telaar]] has asked that you find and free Corki. 
*[[Corki]] Freed Again
*[[Northwind Cleft Key]]

==Description==
<[[Arechron]] sighs.>

This is so embarrassing. Do you remember my boy, Corki? You rescued him from the [[Burning Blade Ruins]] recently. Well, his curiosity has gotten the best of him once more. He told me that he was going to investigate the [[Boulderfist]] menace for 'uncle' [[Mo'mor the Breaker|Mo'mor]] and ran off to the [[ogre mound]]s in the [[Halaani Basin]], north of here.

Do you think you could track him down? I would be eternally grateful.

==Progress==
Did you find him?

==Completion==
Thank you so much, <name>. His mother will deal with him from now on.
