== Objectives ==
Find the Boulderfist Key and Free Corki. Speak with Arechron in Telaar should you succeed.
*{{npc||Corki}} Freed

== Description ==
HELP! They're gonna eat me! I just know it!

Find the key, I know it has to be on one of these ogres.

If you get me out of here, my father will reward you handsomely! He's the leader of Telaar, Arechron.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|90}}

==Progress==
That boy...

<Arechron shakes his head in disapproval.>

He'll be the death of me.

== Completion ==
I'm really sorry about this, <race>. He's always getting himself into trouble. I just wish I could put a leash on him...

== Notes ==
The first chain of quests to save a silly boy.  He stands in a cage on the very southern edge of the Burning Blade Ruins, which is populated by Ogres.  He has a quest which when taken, allows you to pick a key off the Ogres in the camp that opens his cage.  The key will not drop unless you have this quest. 

Once you have the key, go and open the cage up.  This is not a normal escort quest, as he escapes right away without any real escorting required.

==Progression==
{{Corki and the ogres}}
