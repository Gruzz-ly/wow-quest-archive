==Objectives==
[[Elementalist Lo'ap]] at the Throne of the Elements in [[Nagrand]] wants you to bring him 8 Digested Caracoli.
* [[Digested Caracoli]] (8)

==Description==
You are ill-equipped to face the restless elements of Nagrand. Before you can help the [[Earthen Ring]], you must help yourself.

To the west you will find [[dung|dung heaps]] left behind by the wildlife of [[Nagrand]]. You must search the dung for the digested remnants of the Nagrand caracoli. From this bean I am able to make a tablet that will aid you in your battle against the restless forces of nature.

Return to me when you have collected no less than two fists worth of caracoli... [[Ogre]] sized fists.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=5|item1=Nagrand Cherry
}}

*11,000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60}} at 70)

==Progress==
<Elementalist Lo'ap makes two fists and shakes his head in disapproval.>

Ogre sized... 

==Completion==
Please do not wash yourself in the sacred waters of the Throne. 

<Elementalist Lo'ap holds a prepared caracoli tablet up.> 

You place this under your tongue and allow it ample time to dissolve. Once it has dissolved, you will be able to breathe water as if it were air.

==Notes and trivia==
*The Throne of Elements is just north of [[Garadar]] on the other side of the lake. The [[Digested Caracoli]] are found west of the quest giver all over the ground and look like giant piles of dung.
*A Rare Bean is [[A Rare Bean|a Common Quest card]] in the [[World of Warcraft: Trading Card Game]]'s [[Drums of War (TCG)|Drums of War]] set.
*The word "{{wplink|caracoli}}" describes unusually round coffee beans.
*In [[Fruitful Ventures]], [[Digrem Orebar]] mentions that he'd "heard the worst rumor about how you have to obtain" Nagrand Cherries. "Something about talbuk first eating them and then 'processing' them, and then... well, I don't want to talk about it."
