This quest is part of the [[Hero of the Mag'har quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Greatmother Geyah]] at [[Garadar]] in [[Nagrand]] has asked that you collect 1 Olemba Root, 1 Marshberry, 1 Telaari Frond and 1 Dragonspine.
*[[Olemba Root]]
*[[Marshberry]]
*[[Telaari Frond]]
*[[Dragonspine]]
*[[Greatmother's List of Herbs]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Mother Kashur]] wishes to speak with you, <name>. Before this becomes possible, you must collect the herbs required to create a potion that will expand your mind, allowing you to commune with the spirits.

You must gather Olemba root from [[Terokkar Forest|Terokkar]], marshberries from [[Zangarmarsh]], Telaari fronds from [[Nagrand]] and dragonspine from the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]]. I have written down instructions on this parchment as to the cultivation of these herbs. Return to me when you have gathered the materials.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2,600 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]

==Progress==
Hello, dear.

==Completion==
You are very resourceful, <name>. Our greatest gatherers would have taken twice as long to collect the herbs.

<Greatmother Geyah mixes the herbs into a potion and then places the tincture to your lips, forcing you to drink.>

Do not be afraid.

==Notes==
Provided with this quest is [[Greatmother's List of Herbs]].
