==Objectives==
Slay Gava'xi near [[Oshu'gun]] and return to [[Zerid]] at [[Aeris Landing]] in [[Nagrand]].
*[[Gava'xi]]

==Description==
The presence of rogue [[ethereal]]s in this area might amuse [[Gezhe]], who sees nothing but opportunity wherever we go, but it's a true threat to the security of our operations.

Their leader, Gava'xi, is a dangerous criminal and I've made it my top priority to see to it that he is neutralized.

If you're looking to make yourself useful, go and take care of Gava'xi. I will see to it that you're rewarded properly.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Ethereal Sash|Oshu'gun Relic|Zerid's Vintage Musket}}

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|3|70}}
*11650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You've returned, <race>.  Is Gava'xi dead?

==Completion==
We won't have to worry about Gava'xi anymore, thanks to you.  Let us arrange for your reward now.

==Notes==
Gava'xi is a solo mob that will actually be quite a distance from the other Ethereals around Oshu'gun in Nagrand.

He will be patrolling around a large hill near coordinates {{coords|42|75|Nagrand}} in the southeast section of Oshu'gun rather than right next to it. Clear the hill of mobs to see him roaming toward that location from the north.
