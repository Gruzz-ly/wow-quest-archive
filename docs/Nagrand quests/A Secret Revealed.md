This quest is part of the [[Hero of the Mag'har quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[A'dal]] in [[Shattrath City]].

==Description==
As my energies bled away over the centuries, a void slowly grew in my place - devouring the souls of those nearby. Helplessly, I watched as generations of orc souls were drawn into the vortex. Recently, my enemies harnessed the vortex and used it to draw countless void minions into their [[Burning Legion]].

Now, the key to ending this cycle and freeing the orc spirits lies with another [[Naaru]] - [[A'dal]]. I have sensed his essence within the ancient city of [[Shattrath]] in the [[Terokkar Forest]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20}} at level 70)
*+500 [[reputation]] [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]
*+250 reputation with [[The Sha'tar]]

==Completion==
K'ure was wise to send you here. While we cannot assist you with the suffering of the orc ancestors, there is one that can.

One that is soon to be reborn of [[Light]]...
