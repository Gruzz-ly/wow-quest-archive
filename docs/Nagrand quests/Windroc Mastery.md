This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Nagrand Safari}} quest chain, leading to the [[Hills Like White Elekk]] achievement.

==Objectives==
Kill 12 Windrocs and then return to Fitz at the Nesingwary Safari in [[Nagrand]].
*[[Windroc (Outland)|Windroc]]  slain (12)

==Description==
Do you live for the hunt as I do, <class>? Do you seek the quietude that comes as you stalk your prey? Would you know what it is to honor the last heartbeats of your fallen quarry? I will help you to achieve this.

Nagrand is a lush land, full of life in the midst of this broken world. Bring down a handful of the windrocs and then we will speak more.

You can find them in many places nearby in all directions around our camp.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|30}}
*11000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Have you come to know the peace that comes with knowing your place in nature?  Are you the hunter or the hunted?

==Completion==
Every day is a gift. &nbsp;Make the most of it. &nbsp;For tomorrow we shall stride swifter over the plains than today. &nbsp;We will spread our arms further and strain to achieve that which tonight we can only dream of, though it may ever elude us.
