'''In Defense of Halaa''' is the Alliance quest related to the [[world PvP]] objective of [[Nagrand]]. It involves killing enemy players in support of capturing or defending [[Halaa]].

==Objectives==
Defeat 10 enemy players in [[Halaa]] and return to [[Lakoor]] in [[Telaar]].
*Halaa Enemy Combatant slain (10)

==Description==
We are not a warlike race, <race>. However when war comes to our lands, we do not run away from it.

The [[Alliance]] and the [[Horde]] wage war in the city of Halaa, to the northwest. We do not know what the [[Blood elf|blood elves]] are scheming, but any victory for the Horde would be disastrous. The history between our people and the [[orc]]s is one of bloodshed and betrayal.

Go and slay the enemy in Halaa and you will be rewarded in coin, honor and renown.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|40}}
*12650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|59}} at max level)
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Kurenai]]
*209 honor

==Progress==
Is your task done, <name>?

==Completion==
I thank you, <name>.  Your efforts will not be ignored.
