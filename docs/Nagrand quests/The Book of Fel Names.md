'''The Book of Fel Names''' sends the player in the search of a magic book that is a source of [[Varedis]]' power.

*[[Book of Fel Names]]

==Description==
I sympathize with your intentions of stopping [[Varedis Felsoul|Varedis]] and his followers, but you won't stand a chance against him. That is, unless you find the artifact that gave him his power.

The Book of Fel Names is rumored to be in the possession of Blackheart the Inciter inside the Shadow Labyrinth in Auchindoun. Obtaining it will be your only hope against Varedis.   

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*25300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you obtained the book, <name>?  

==Completion==
I was able to sense the book's power from yards away.  The temptation to keep it is... very strong.

==Notes==
;Upon completion
:{{text|say|Altruis the Sufferer|This book would give me unlimited power over my enemies... I would become... unstoppable!}}
:{{text|say|Altruis the Sufferer|No... you must take this from me, <name>!  I feel its dark power swaying my will already!  Use it to destroy Varedis.}}
