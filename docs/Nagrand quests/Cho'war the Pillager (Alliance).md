==Objectives==
Corki wants you to get Cho'war's Key so that you can free him from his cage. Return to [[Arechron]] at [[Telaar]] should you manage this task.
* [[Corki]] Freed
*[[Cho'war's Key]]

==Description==
They call him [[Cho'war the Pillager]], &lt;name&gt;. He's the ogre that forced out the [[gronn]] that used to rule over these ogres. You better believe he's powerful!

The chef said that Cho'war lives in the big cave - wherever that may be... Get that key and get me out of here! If we live through this, my father will no doubt give you the big reward! As soon as I'm free, seek him out.

About that reward...
