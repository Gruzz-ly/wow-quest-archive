You must be {{reputation|friendly}} to accept this quest.

==Objectives==
Bring 10 Obsidian Warbeads to [[Gezhe]] at [[Aeris Landing]] in [[Nagrand]].
*[[Obsidian Warbeads]] (10)

==Description==
All this waiting around for [[Oshu'gun]] to be ready for digging is eating into our profits, <name>.

Fortunately, I've devised an alternate source of income. The ogres of Nagrand wear warbeads made of obsidian, a mineral that commands a hefty price in many other worlds.

[[Zerid]] already has had to take care a few of the brutes as a matter of security. Think of the warbeads as an added bonus. Or better yet, don't think about it too much and just bring them to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{Cost|3|70|}}

==Progress==
How are those ogres treating you, <name>?  Tough bunch, aren't they?

==Completion==
Excellent.  This will keep us in business while we wait for the Sha'tar to finish whatever housekeeping it is they need to do inside Oshu'gun.

==Notes==
Obsidian Warbeads drop from any of the [[ogre]]s throughout Nagrand.
