==Description==
The [[Consortium]] is well known for taking good care of its friends. At the beginning of each month I'll have some gems ready for you as payment for your services.

The quality of the gems you get will depend on how loyal you've been to us. Here's to hoping you do the smart thing and stay with us.

== Rewards ==
* At {{reputation|Friendly}} reputation with The [[Consortium]]: [[Gem-Stuffed Envelope]]
* At {{reputation|Honored}} reputation with The [[Consortium]]: [[Unmarked Bag of Gems]]
* At {{reputation|Revered}} reputation with The [[Consortium]]: [[Bulging Sack of Gems]]
* At {{reputation|Exalted}} reputation with The [[Consortium]]: [[Bag of Premium Gems]]

== Notes ==
* At the beginning of each new month you can collect a bag of gems.
* Until [[Patch 4.3.0]] with the addition of the Darkmoon Faire, this was the only [[monthly quest]] to exist in the game.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
