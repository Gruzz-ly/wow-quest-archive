==Objectives==
[[Ohlorn Farstrider]] wants you to speak with [[Shado 'Fitz' Farstrider]] at the [[Nesingwary Safari]] in [[Nagrand]].

==Description==
These [[Mag'har orc|orcs]] have never seen a [[tauren]] before - if you can believe such a thing. If it weren't for [[Captain Kroghan]], they would have probably been serving me for their next meal right about now.

But where are my manners? I am Ohlorn Farstrider, [[hunter]] extraordinaire! I am part of the [[Nesingwary Safari (group)|Nesingwary expedition]] that came up here from [[Azeroth]] in search of big game. If you are interested in the hunt, perhaps you should visit my crew at the Nesingwary Safari, due east of here near the border of [[Zangarmarsh]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1100 [[XP]] (or {{cost||66|}} at max level)

==Completion==
I am relieved to hear that he is safe. Have you come to join the hunt?

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
