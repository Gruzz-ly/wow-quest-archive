The '''Visions of Destruction''' foretells the battles of the [[Wildhammer dwarf|Wildhammer dwarves]] against the Legion in [[Shadowmoon Valley]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Wing Commander Nuainn]] at [[Wildhammer Stronghold]]. 

==Description==
A vision of cataclysm often disturbs my rest—a rain of green fire falling to the earth, felling the valiant defenders of a mighty fortress. It has haunted me for weeks now, although I have only recently come to understand its meaning.

To the far east, in [[Shadowmoon Valley]], the [[Wildhammer dwarf|Wildhammer dwarves]] endure constant attacks from the Burning Legion and numerous other foes. They fight bravely, but without relief, their enemies will triumph. Go to their side, <name>. Help them in their fight.

==Completion==
A vision, you say? I don't care if he saw it in a vision, read it in a letter, or heard it from the mouth of a pit lord. He was dead on! What matters is that you're here, friend, and we need all the help we can get. 

==Progression==
