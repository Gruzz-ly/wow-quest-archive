==Objectives==
Obtain 10 [[Oshu'gun Crystal Fragment]]s and bring them to [[Gezhe]] at [[Aeris Landing]] in [[Nagrand]].
* [[Oshu'gun Crystal Fragment]] (10)

==Description==
[[Nexus Prince Haramad]] has ordered us to not begin work inside of [[Oshu'gun]] as it might anger a certain powerful [[naaru]]. Sort of puts a damper on our operation.

I think I might've found a loophole, however.

You see, we're not the only [[ethereal]]s drawn to this colossal diamond. A thief called [[Gava'xi]] has led a band of rogue ethereals into Oshu'gun and they've begun to dislodge large fragments from it.

Your job, <race>, is to go there and retrieve what is rightfully ours.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|50}}
*11300 [[XP]] (or {{cost||69}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Have you retrieved the crystal fragments I asked of you, <name>?

==Completion==
Color me impressed.  These are in excellent condition, for the most part.

I will make sure to put in a good word for you with our people.

==Notes==
This quest is only available at {{rep|neutral}} reputation with the [[Consortium]].
