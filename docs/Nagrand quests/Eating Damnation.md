<Gordawg raises one of his massive legs and stomps the ground.>

Look. See [[Nagrand]].

<Gordawg directs you to the imprint of his foot. Within the imprint you see what appears to be a perfect geological map of [[Nagrand]], marked with the locations of where you can find the elementals [[Gordawg]] wants you to destroy.>

Take the map.
