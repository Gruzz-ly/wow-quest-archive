==Description==
So are you ready for your first battle? If you are, let me know and I'll get things started. All you have to do is go wait in the Ring of Blood for your opponent to arrive.

This fight is against Brokentoe, a ferocious clefthoof.

Good luck! I hope you brought friends.

And remember, the fight's over when either you or your opponent are lying face down on the arena floor.

*{{cost|11|10}}
*+10 [[Kurenai]] reputation for Alliance / +10 [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]] reputation for Horde

==Progress==
The fight's over when you or your opponent are dead on the floor.

==Completion==
Hrm, not bad. Not bad at all... You've got potential, kid. Here's a little gold to line your pockets with...

==Notes==
Brokentoe, a level 66 elite [[Clefthoof]], is the first opponent you will face when starting [[The Ring of Blood]]. 
It's a basic tank-and-spank fight, no special tricks. The person that starts the quest will have initial aggro, so it might be wise to let your tank start the event.
