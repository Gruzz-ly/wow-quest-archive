This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Nagrand Safari}} quest chain, leading to the [[Hills Like White Elekk]] achievement.

==Objectives==
Hunt down 12 Talbuk Thorngrazers and then return to [[Harold Lane]] at the Nesingwary Safari in [[Nagrand]].
*[[Talbuk Thorngrazer]] slain (12)

==Description==
This darned scratch is getting the worst of me it would seem. So, are you up to filling...&lt;cough&gt;... in for me again?

This time you're going to bag yourself some thorngrazers. They're tougher and wilier than the stags, so keep your wits about you. Look for them... &lt;cough&gt;... sheltered under the trees in the middle of [[Nagrand]] to the west and south.

Go on, get out there and...<cough>... show Hemet what you're made of. I'll be fine.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*1130 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|78|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
I don't suppose...<cough>... you've taken care of those...<cough>... thorngrazers yet?

==Completion==
<cough>, <cough>... <name>! &nbsp;You did it. &nbsp;There's only...<cough>... one thing left to...<cough>... do then.

==Progression==
{{Nagrand Safari}}
