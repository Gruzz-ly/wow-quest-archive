==Objectives==
Elder Yorley at the Mag'hari Procession in [[Nagrand]] has asked that you slay 8 Warmaul Brutes and 8 Warmaul Warlocks.
*[[Warmaul Warlock]] slain (8)
*[[Warmaul Brute]] slain (8)

==Description==
We were en route to the Ancestral Grounds when we were ambushed by Warmaul. They came from all sides, killing several of the procession guards and many of the others. They even desecrated the remains of the elder in the wagon.

And for what? So they could humiliate us and display their power. Not even Boulderfist would have sunk so low.

I am a spiritual orc, <name>, but even I have limitations. Find the attackers at Warmaul Hill to the northwest and destroy them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|70|}}
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at max level)
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]

==Progress==
This is merely one step in a long process. Ogres, like dogs, must be shown the difference between right and wrong. Telling them does no good.

==Completion==
It is a good start, but their leader must be dealt with for your actions to have any lasting impact.

==Progression==
# [[Missing Mag'hari Procession]]
# [[War on the Warmaul]]
# [[Cho'war the Pillager (Horde)]]
