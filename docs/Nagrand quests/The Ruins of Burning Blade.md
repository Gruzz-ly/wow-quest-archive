==Objectives==
[[Mo'mor the Breaker]] at [[Telaar]] in [[Nagrand]] wants you to kill 15 [[Boulderfist Crusher]]s and 15 [[Boulderfist Mystic]]s.

==Description==
These ogre hunting parties are a precursor to invasion. We must strike at them before they have a chance to amass an army big enough to take over our town.

You're going to need to get your hands dirty, <Race>.

The largest collection of Boulderfist in this region can be found at the Burning Blade Ruins, almost directly east of Telaar, near the border of Terokkar. Go there and show the Boulderfist that Telaar will not bend to their will!

==Completion==
Excellent. Did you happen to locate this Lantresor creature that the stupid one's letter mentioned?

Regardless, we must press on. I have gotten reports of more ogre activity that must be dealt with at once!
