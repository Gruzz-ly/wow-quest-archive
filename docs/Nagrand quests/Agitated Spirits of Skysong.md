==Objectives==
[[Elementalist Lo'ap]] at the Throne of the Elements in [[Nagrand]] wants you to destroy 12 [[Lake Spirit]]s.
* [[Lake Spirit]] slain (8)

==Description==
The disturbance in the ebb and flow of the waters of [[Nagrand]] has greatly agitated the water spirits of Skysong Lake. They have in turn begun sowing destruction throughout the waterways of the area.

Watoosun of the Water has come to us in a vision and granted us permission to remedy the problem - so long as the source of the disturbance is also dealt with...

We will get to the source, but first you must deal with the problems immediate to the Throne. Destroy the agitated lake spirits and return to me

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 11,000 [[XP]] (or 6 gold 60 silver at level 70)

==Progress==
Use the Nagrand cherries before delving too deeply into the lake.

==Completion==
<[[Elementalist Lo'ap]] kneels in the water and says a prayer.>

The Earthen Ring takes no pride in what was done. We do what we must to heal the land.

==Notes==
The Throne of Elements is just north of [[Garadar]] on the other side of the lake. The [[Lake Spirit]]s are just south of the quest giver in the lake.
