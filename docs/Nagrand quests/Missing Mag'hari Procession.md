==Objectives==
Search for the missing [[Mag'har]]i procession.

==Description==
[[Greatmother Geyah|Greatmother]] says that we must press on and serve our people. She says that we must serve as an example for Garrosh - to show that life goes on.

I have so many matters to attend to here, especially with Greatmother having taken ill. Would you honor the Mag'har by helping one of their matrons?

Several days ago we sent a funeral procession to the [[Ancestral Grounds]] and they have yet to return. Will you go search for them? They took the western road out of Garadar. Follow it around and avoid Halaa.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thirty [[orc]]s, <race>! Of those original thirty, only [[Elder Ungriz|Ungriz]] and I remain. We found the young orc, [[Dranosh Saurfang|Saurfang]], nearly dead near [[Sunspring Post|Sunspring]]. Apparently he was here for another reason...
