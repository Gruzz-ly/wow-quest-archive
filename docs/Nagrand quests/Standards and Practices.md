==Objectives==
[[Elkay'gan the Mystic]] at [[Garadar]] in [[Nagrand]] wants you to use the Mag'har Battle Standard at the [[First Burning Blade Pyre]], [[Second Burning Blade Pyre]], and [[Third Burning Blade Pyre]]. Return the left-over Mag'har Battle Standards to him when you are finished. 
*First Battle Standard Placed
*Second Battle Standard Placed
*Third Battle Standard Placed
*[[Mag'har Battle Standard]] (provided)

==Description==
If you're venturing into the [[Burning Blade Ruins]], I have a task for you. Take these [[Mag'har]] battle standards and place them at three distinct locations in the [[ogre]] compound. An area of high visibility is recommended. Look for the gigantic flaming pyres on the upper levels. Place a standard near the first, second, and third Burning Blade pyres.

The standard will leave a lasting impression upon any ogres who may have missed the battle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*11000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60|}} at level 70)
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]

==Progress==
Respect from fear! It is as good as any other kind.

==Completion==
Perhaps you would like another task? A more delicate matter, eh?
