'''Visit the Throne of the Elements''' is part of the [[Children's Week (Horde Outland)|Shattrath Children's Week quest chain]] for the Horde.

All three of [[Hch'uu and the Mushroom People]], [[A Trip to the Dark Portal (Horde)]] and [[Visit the Throne of the Elements]] must be completed before the next pair of quests is offered.

==Objectives==
Take your orphan, Salandria, to the [[Throne of the Elements]] in [[Nagrand]]. Make sure to call for her if she is not present when you arrive. Then, speak with [[Elementalist Sharvak]]. 
*Salandria taken to the Throne of the Elements

==Description==
Have you heard of the [[Throne of the Elements]]? It's supposed to be this place in [[Nagrand]] where there are these powerful elementals.

One day soon, I'm going to be a powerful mage, or maybe a warlock. I'm gonna have to learn about some of the elemental forces!

Do you think maybe that we could go there?

&lt;Salandria looks at you slyly.&gt;

Ya know, it would be educational to go there. It's supposedly just north of [[Garadar]], on the other side of [[Skysong Lake]].

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*12650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Lower City]]

==Progress==
The Earthen Ring sees you, <class>.

==Completion==
You bring a child here? &nbsp;Foolhardy, but I promise that she will come to no harm, at least as long as she doesn't get too close to [[Incineratus]].

Hmm, unfortunate that she's a blood elf. &nbsp;Were she capable of a deep connection to the world, we could teach her some things so that she might aid us to heal its wounds. &nbsp;But, perhaps her exposure to the elements here will give her some insight into their workings.

Go in peace and see to it that you take good care of her.

==Notes==
When the orphan is summoned...
:{{text|whisper|Blood Elf Orphan|Hah, it's true!  I'm gonna go have a closer look at the fire one!}}
:''She approaches the [[Incineratus|fire elemental]], and gets zapped (lightning).
:{{Text|say|Blood Elf Orphan|Ow!  Hot!!}}
:{{text|whisper|Blood Elf Orphan|Heh, I got a little too close.  Don't worry, I'm fine.}}

==Progression==
