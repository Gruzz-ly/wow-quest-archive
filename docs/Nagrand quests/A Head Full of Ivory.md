==Objectives==
Collect 3 Pair of Ivory Tusks and return them to [[Shadrek]] at Aeris Landing in [[Nagrand]].
* [[Pair of Ivory Tusks]] (3)

==Description==
Ivory is a much sought after prize.  I have many customers in far off places lined up waiting to purchase it.

I could be convinced to let you in on a cut of the profits.

The wild elekk roaming Nagrand have the high quality of tusks that I'm after.  Steer clear of the bull elekk; their Ivory isn't in the condition that I desire.

Oh and don't worry, it's not poaching; I have an understanding with both the orcs and the draenei.

Do you and I have an understanding?

==Reward==
* {{cost|3|50}}
* 11300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It's ivory that I'm after, not excuses.  Of course, if you'd rather, we can renegotiate your percentage of the profits.  I doubt that you'd be pleased with the result.

==Completion==
Never doubted you for a second, friend.  Most of those look like fine specimens, if a bit dirty and scratched up.  Still, I think they're worth the value we agreed upon previously.

I hope that we can continue to do business in the future.

==Notes==
This quest is an obvious play of elephant hunt for the ivory in Africa, as the [[Consortium]] is very well capable of killing for money
