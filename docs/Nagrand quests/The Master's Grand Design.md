==Objectives==
Find [[Nitrin the Learned]] at the [[Abandoned Armory]] in [[Nagrand]].

==Description==
A couple of [[draenei]] paid us a visit last night. They'd somehow learned that we had the book in our possession and made a very generous offer to "take it off our hands."

We didn't ask them what they wanted with the book but the young one kept talking about "the master's grand design," whatever that means.

Look, I don't ask questions when money is in play. They gave us a lot of gold and we gave them the book.

He said that they lived in Nagrand - in the old Abandoned Armory, north of [[Telaar]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[The Sha'tar]]

==Completion==
The signs were all there but I turned a blind eye.

The [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s grasp grows stronger every day. Even in these parts...

Had I known... Had I known that [[Levixus|my boy]] was communing with demons... They offered him power and then gave him a taste of that power. That was all that it took...

The book is gone. Taken by [[Levixus]]... His plans are known only to me and his dark master.

Stranger, I don't know if you've ever done right in your life, but know this: the boy must be stopped.
