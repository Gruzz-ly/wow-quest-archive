==Objectives==
Kill 40 Murkblood Scavengers and 20 Murkblood Raiders.
*[[Murkblood Raider]] slain (20)
*[[Murkblood Scavenger]] slain (40)

==Description==
I do not know you, stranger, but I ask for your help. I feel shame for this, but I am only one orc.

Emotions have surfaced that I have never felt. I... I seek vengeance. Blood for blood. Do your people ever feel this? I wish to pick up my axe and split my enemies in two. To swing the weapon until my arms fall lifelessly at my sides, exhausted.

Sunspring Post is directly south of this procession. It is there that you will find our enemies... Kill them... Kill them all...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at max level)
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]

==Progress==
For each of my kin that they slew, ten of them must die!

==Completion==
<Saurfang turns to face you.>

Is it blood that I smell? I regret being unable to lend assistance. How proud you must be. My chest swells just knowing what you have done.

Are there others like you? Where you come from, do more heroes exist?

==Trivia==
The name of the quest is a possible reference to the New Zealand drama film, [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110729/ Once Were Warriors].
