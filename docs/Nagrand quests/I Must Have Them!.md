==Objectives==
Wazat across from [[Clan Watch]] in southern [[Nagrand]] wants you to bring him 3 Air Elemental Gases.
*[[Air Elemental Gas]] (3)

==Description==
Do you see them?? By [[Gazlowe]]'s horrific halitosis, I will have those eggs! Say, you look like you might be of some use.

I'll tell you what, <race>; if you gather a few items for me to make my [[Jump-a-tron 4000]] functional, I'll give you a key that will let you operate the machine as well! What can you do with a Jump-a-tron 4000 you say? What can't you do is more like it...

I'll need air elemental gas from the [[air elemental]]s of Nagrand. They're all over the place so don't ask me where to find 'em!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|50|}}
*11300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|78|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Got gas?

==Completion==
Excellent! Now just a few adjustments and this thing will be as good as new. Oh yes, your key! Here you go.

By the way, the Jump-a-tron still has a few kinks that I need to work out. Um, just be careful.
