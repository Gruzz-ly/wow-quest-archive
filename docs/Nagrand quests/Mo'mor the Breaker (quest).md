==Objectives==
Huntress Bintook at [[Telaar]] in [[Nagrand]] wants you to speak to [[Mo'mor the Breaker]].

==Description==
You must seek out Mo'mor immediately! You will find him in the center of [[Telaar]], by the fountain. Tell him exactly what the ogre told you.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*20 [[reputation]] with [[Kurenai]]

==Completion==
<Mo'mor looks perplexed.>

So, a new tribe of ogres is forcing the Boulderfist further and further south. This is quite troubling. We must first deal with the situation closest to home...
