==Objectives==
Communicate with [[Gordawg]]. 

==Description==
Something rails the underneath. It beats the ground as if to punish.

<nowiki>*Thud*</nowiki>

<Untrag beats his chest with his fist.>

It makes this sound a hundred-thousand times. Endlessly it beats. The earth reels. It is calling out to us now.

Gordawg speaks to me. [[Gordawg]] knows that something forces the elements out. Something from the underneath.

Go now and speak to [[Gordawg]]. No, listen to [[Gordawg]], do not speak. Hear [[Gordawg]]...

==Completion==
<Gordawg appears to be nodding at you.>

Sit.
