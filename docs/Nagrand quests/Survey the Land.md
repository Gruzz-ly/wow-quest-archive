==Objectives==
Sit back and enjoy the ride. Speak to [[Altruis the Sufferer|Altruis]] when the survey is complete.
*Forge Camps Surveyed
*Suggested players: 3

==Description==
To be my eyes will require some diligence on your part. [[Nethrandamus]] will take you through the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] camps, but you must catalog everything that you see. Even the smallest detail that you may think to be inconsequential could be useful for our purposes.

Primarily, I want you to note what structures are in the camps and what comprises the camps' defenses.

Nethrandamus is ready when you are, <name>. Do not be afraid, he will keep you safe from harm.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Never flown on the back of a nether drake, eh?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>! We now have a point from which we can plan our counter-attack.

==Notes==
This really is almost as simple as it sounds.  You take the quest, you fly around, you land.  Take advantage of the opportunity to fly on the [[nether drake]]. Enjoy the scenery. It was meant to be appreciated from the air, after all.

If you are mounted or shape-shifted when you take this quest, you will need to dismount and/or return to your normal form in order to complete this quest.  (If you were mounted or shapeshifted, simply drop the quest and get it again.)
