==Progress==
You've got more crystal fragments? Make sure you're not taking any that are still attached to [[Oshu'gun|the mountain]]; we wouldn't want to stir up trouble with the [[naaru]].
*[[Oshu'gun Crystal Fragment]] (10)

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Consortium]]

==Completion==
Keep the crystal fragments coming, <name>.  We cannot let these thieves take our property.

Even if it's not ours just quite yet.  A technicality, of course.

==Notes==
This quest is only available at {{rep|neutral}} reputation with the [[Consortium]].
