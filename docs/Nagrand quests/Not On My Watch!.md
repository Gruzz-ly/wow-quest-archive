==Objectives==
[[Huntress Bintook]] at [[Telaar]] in [[Nagrand]] wants you to speak to [[Lump]]. Return to Huntress Bintook when you have gathered the information that she requested.
*Lump Interrogated

==Description==
The battle plans were written up by an [[ogre]] lieutenant. His name is either Dump or Lump.

<Bintook turns the parchment sideways and cocks her head.>

It could also be Billy.

Anyhow, I think you should go back out there and have a word with Billy or Lump or Dumpy or whatever! Try to approach him diplomatically. If that doesn't work, try using some muscle.

==Rewards==
*11.000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60|}} at level 70)
*+1,000 [[reputation]] with [[Kurenai]]

==Progress==
He'll probably be asleep on a ridge.

==Completion==
Oh my! This is a small scouting and hunting party? You must tell Mo'mor what you have discovered.

==Progression==

==Patch changes==
