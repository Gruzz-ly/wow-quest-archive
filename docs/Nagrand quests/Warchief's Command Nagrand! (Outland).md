==Objectives==
Speak with [[Captain Kroghan]] at [[Garadar]] in [[Nagrand]].

==Description==
The [[Warchief]] has asked for any able bodied champions of the [[Horde]] to ride to the aid of Garadar.

The home of the [[Mag'har (faction)|Mag'har]], lies to the south, in Nagrand. Take the southern road out of the marsh, then turn east at the first fork and look for a large settlement on the lake.

Report to Captain Kroghan there and offer him what assistance you can. Garadar must not fall!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||74|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Even though he endeavors to hide it, a look of relief spreads over Kroghan's face.>

It's about time you got here! Granted, you're not an army, but any able-bodied <race> than can wield a weapon or chant a spell is welcome here. The people of Garadar are kin to all the Horde and we are proud to shed our blood in their defense.

==Progression==
...

== Notes ==
Accepting this quest sets the [[Mag'har (faction)|Mag'har]] reputation to 1/3000 {{Rep|Neutral}}, if it was lower before.

==Patch changes==
