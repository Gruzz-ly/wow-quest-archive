This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Nagrand Safari}} quest chain, leading to the [[Hills Like White Elekk]] achievement.

==Objectives==
Kill 12 [[Clefthoof]] Bulls and then speak to [[Hemet Nesingwary]] at Nesingwary's Safari in [[Nagrand]] about your prowess.
*[[Clefthoof Bull]] slain (12)

==Description==
You've proved to me that you can find and take down a regular clefthoof, but far more dangerous are the clefthoof bulls.

Bag yourself twelve of those. Then you can talk to me of your hunting prowess.

Look for them all along the middle region of [[Nagrand]] to the west and south.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|70}}
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
You think the clefthoof bulls are just going to fall dead at your feet here in front of the campfire?

==Completion==
Impressive. &nbsp;Most impressive.

You've got potential, kid. &nbsp;Now I'm going to give you the chance to have some real fun!
