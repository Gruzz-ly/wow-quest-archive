== Objectives ==
Find someone at the [[Throne of the Elements]] that knows how to speak [[Kalimag]] and show them the [[:Howling Wind]]. 
*[[Howling Wind]] (provided)

== Description ==
This amorphous mass of elemental air is speaking to you in a language that you cannot understand. You believe the language to be the tongue of the elements: [[Kalimag]]. Perhaps someone at the [[Throne of the Elements]] could shed some insight on this unusual find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at level 70)

== Progress ==
Give it here! Quickly!

==  Completion ==
It is a distress call, &lt;race&gt;. An outside force is attempting to subvert the elements.

==Progression==
# [[The Howling Wind]]
# [[Murkblood Corrupters]]
