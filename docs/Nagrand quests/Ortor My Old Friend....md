==Objectives==
Arechron at [[Telaar]] in [[Nagrand]] wants you to kill Ortor of Murkblood. 
*[[Ortor of Murkblood]] slain

==Description==
These invasion plans were written by someone I once knew. Ortor of Murkblood, once a noble [[Broken]], versed in the way of the elements, now a muck addled yes-man of [[Swamplord Musel'ek|Musel'ek the bog lord]].

The plans state that they have taken over an [[orc]] village northwest of here known as Sunspring.

Travel to [[Sunspring Post]] and rid the world of Ortor of Murkblood. What you do, you do for the good of us all...

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Eighty Silver Links|Murkblood Oven Mitts|Murkblood Avenger's Legplates}}

You will receive:
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at level 70)
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Kurenai]]

==Progress==
Remember, <name>, Ortor is a [[shaman]] of great power.

==Completion==
A thousand dead orcs you say? What could have triggered such an audacious advance into orc lands? It is good that he is dead but there is more to this than what meets the tentacle.
