==Objectives==
Speak with [[Captain Kroghan]] at [[Garadar]] in [[Nagrand]].

==Description==
<Still catching his breath, the messenger gestures for you to sit.>

They may not survive, <race>! Get to Garadar as quickly as your legs will carry you.

<In response to your blank stare, the messenger elaborates.>

The home of the [[Mag'har]], lies to the south, in Nagrand. Take the southern road out of [[Zangarmarsh|the marsh]], then turn east at the first fork and look for a large settlement on the lake.

Find our [[Commander (rank)|commander]], Captain Kroghan, there and offer him what assistance you can. Garadar must not fall!

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*2650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|26|}} at level 70)

==Completion==
<Even though he endeavors to hide it, a look of relief spreads over Kroghan's face.>

It's about time you got here! Granted, you're not an army, but any able-bodied <race> than can wield a weapon or chant a spell is welcome here. The people of Garadar are kin to all the [[Horde]] and we are proud to shed our blood in their defense.
