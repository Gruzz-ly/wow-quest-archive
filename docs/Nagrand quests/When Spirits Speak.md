This quest is part of the [[Hero of the Mag'har quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Mother Kashur]] at the Ancestral Grounds in [[Nagrand]] has asked that you seek out the vision you had. Find [[K'ure]] in [[Oshu'gun]].

==Description==
Oshu'gun - the diamond mountain - was once sacred to my people. It was there that the clans would gather every year to celebrate the springtime festival. It was there that our shaman communed with the honored ancestors. It was the center of our culture - until the shadows overtook us. When the clans became a horde, the spirits of Oshu'gun fell silent. The ancestors turned their backs on us.

Yet something now draws them from their rest. Venture to Oshu'gun and discover what could trouble the spirits so.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20}} at level 70)
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]] 
*+250 reputation with [[The Sha'tar]]

==Completion==
<A gentle, melodic voice fills your mind.>

I am [[K'ure]] of the [[naaru]], <Name>. You stand within the heart of my ancient vessel. [[Oshu'gun]], as the orcs named it, is the ship that first brought the [[draenei]] to this world. Though we fell from the heavens and crashed here many hundreds of years ago, my weakened energies have remained trapped within this wreckage. Regrettably, I am the source of the orc spirits' pain.
