==Objectives==
Report to Gezhe at Aeris Landing in Nagrand.

==Description==
My organization, the Consortium, is looking for a few resourceful individuals just like yourself. You'll be hard pressed to find ethereals more honest, hard-working or pleasant to be around than us.

All we require is loyalty, dedication and a reasonable amount of moral flexibility. If you're interested, speak to Gezhe, our ground operations leader. You will find him at Aeris Landing, north of Oshu'gun.

==Completion==
Are you ready to get to work, <race>?  I think I've got the perfect task for you.
