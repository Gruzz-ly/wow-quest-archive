This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Nagrand Safari}} quest chain, leading to the [[Hills Like White Elekk]] achievement.

==Objectives==
Hunt down 12 Clefthooves and return to [[Hemet Nesingwary]] at Nesingwary's Safari in [[Nagrand]] to prove yourself.
*[[Clefthoof (mob)|Clefthooves]] slain (12)

==Description==
You want to earn a place in this safari? You'll have to prove yourself.

I don't care what you've hunted before, you haven't hunted until you hunt what we hunt here. Start with the clefthoof if you're <man/tough> enough.

I know that I've seen them in the immediate area around the safari and also close by to the south.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|50|}}
*11300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|78|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
The clefthoof of Nagrand are a good challenge.  I've bagged myself quite a few.

How are you doing with that?

==Completion==
A fair start. &nbsp;But that's just the beginning.

The lesser clefthoof prove nothing. &nbsp;Let's move you up to a bigger challenge.

==Progression==
