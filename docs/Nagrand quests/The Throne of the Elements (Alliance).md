==Objectives==
[[Elementalist Ioki]] wants you to travel to the [[Throne of the Elements]] and speak with [[Elementalist Sharvak]].

==Description==
Greetings, <race>. I am Ioki, elementalist of the [[Earthen Ring]]. I have come to [[Telaar]] to inform the [[Kurenai]] of the state of the elements.

Could I ask a favor of you? Would you travel to the Throne of the Elements in the northern hills of [[Nagrand]], beyond Skysong Lake, and tell elementalist Sharvak that I have arrived at Telaar safely? She will surely reward you for this small deed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|50|}}
*2850 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|71|}} at max level)
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Kurenai]]

==Completion==
Ah, thank you for the message. Perhaps you would not mind helping out the Earthen Ring? The elements are in flux. We can use all of the assistance that we can get.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
