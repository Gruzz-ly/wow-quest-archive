This quest is part of the [[Hero of the Mag'har quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Greatmother Geyah]] at [[Garadar]] has asked that you speak with [[Garrosh]].

==Description==
You have done so much for the [[Mag'har (faction)|Mag'har]], <name>. Your accomplishments are known to all, including Garrosh. Go to him now and tell him of your latest victory. Tell him that you do what you do for him and his people. Surely he will be lifted by your words.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1200 [[XP]] (or {{cost|s=72}} at level 70)
*+20 [[reputation]] with the [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]

==Completion==
Everyone is proud. Proud that our people will live to see another winter. But beyond that? What is there?

Maybe you should lead this clan, <name>. Maybe then I will be allowed to die when the Greatmother passes. Allowed to finally erase the shame of my family name. I long for such peace.
