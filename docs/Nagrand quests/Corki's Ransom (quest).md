==Objectives==
Arechron wants you to find [[Corki]] at [[Warmaul Hill]]. 

==Description==
[[File:Corki's Ransom TCG.jpg|thumb|In the [[World of Warcraft: Trading Card Game]].]]

<Arechron shows you a grime covered letter.>

I just received this letter. It's from a clan of ogres known as Warmaul that rule the northwestern lands of [[Nagrand]]. It says that they have Corki and if we don't cooperate, they're going to eat him. Admittedly, Corki is a moron, but he's still my blood. Will you rescue him, &lt;name&gt;?

I presume that he's locked up in a cage somewhere on Warmaul Hill. That should be your first stop. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at level 70)
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Kurenai]]

==Completion==
They've got me locked up good this time, <name>. The Warmaul king, Cho'war, has the key.

==Progression==
