==Objectives==
[[Warden Bullrok]] at [[Garadar]] wants you to obtain 10 Obsidian Warbeads from the various [[ogre]]s that inhabit [[Nagrand]].
*[[Obsidian Warbeads]] (10)

==Description==
Though we seek a peaceful life, our enemies are many. Of these, none match the ogres in sheer brute power.

If you seek to prove your prowess to us, bring me the warbeads they wear around their necks. I will tell others of your accomplishments.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at max level)
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]

==Progress==
You have something to show me, <name>?

==Completion==
You are a strong ally indeed, <name>.  Going head to head against the ogres of Outland is not something that just anyone can do.

==Patch changes==
