==Objectives==
Deliver the news to [[Farseer Corhuk]] at [[Garadar]].

==Description==
Will you do me one last honor, <name>? I do not wish to return to [[Garadar]]. I believe that my destiny lies elsewhere - that I will serve a greater purpose someday.

Please, return to [[Farseer Corhuk]] and tell him that I will not be returning. That I cannot return. I must walk the earth... He will understand.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|Choose one of:
|Greenkeeper's Pantaloons
|Thunderbringer's Guard
|Smuggler's Mitts}}
You will also receive:
*5800 [[XP]]
*150 [[reputation]] with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]

==Completion==
<Farseer Corhuk stares at the ground, lost in contemplation. He nods his head affirmatively.>

<Farseer Corhuk wipes a tear away.>

The son is the father... May the spirits have mercy on those that stand in his way.
