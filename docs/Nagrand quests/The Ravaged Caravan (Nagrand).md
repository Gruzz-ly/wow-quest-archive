==Objectives==
[[Huntress Kima]] at [[Telaar]] in [[Nagrand]] wants you to recover 20 Telaar Supply Crates.
*[[Telaar Supply Crate]] (20)

==Description==
I was part of a caravan taking supplies to the [[Orebor Harborage]] in [[Zangarmarsh]]. As we were nearing the border of the marsh, we were jumped by a vicious squad of [[Warmaul]] ogres. They killed the others and took me prisoner, along with all of our supplies.

Thankfully, they neglected to place a backing on my cage. When they fell asleep, I made my escape.

It's too late for my comrades but we could really use the supplies they stole. [[Warmaul Hill]] is in the northwestern mountains of Nagrand.

==Rewards==

*You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|70}}
*11650  [[XP]]
*+700 [[reputation]] with [[Kurenai]]

==Progress==
I feel so stupid. Arechron's son, [[Corki]], asked me what happened and I told him. Now he's gone missing again!

==Completion==
Amazing! How did you manage to carry all of that back by yourself?
