==Objectives==
Take the information that you beat out of Unkor back to [[Kilrath]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].

==Description==
For many years, Boulderfist ruled all ogres in the Outland. The ogres were united under [[Krol]] and content with the lands that they were given. In the past few months, we have lost many ogres to a new clan known as Warmaul. Warmaul has taken most of our land in [[Nagrand]] and killed many of our people.

We had no choice but to take this town. We are being exterminated...

Krol has gone missing and Boulderfist is in turmoil. [[Lantresor of the Blade]] rules in his absence.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*1100 [[XP]] (or {{cost||66|}} at level 70)

==Completion==
Slow down, <name>. I am but a lowly rogue. I have no idea what to do with such information.
