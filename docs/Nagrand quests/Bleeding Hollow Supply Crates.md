==Objectives==
[[Elkay'gan the Mystic]] at [[Garadar]] in [[Nagrand]] wants you to recover 20 Bleeding Hollow Supply Crates. 
*[[Bleeding Hollow Supply Crate]] (20)

==Description==
The [[Boulderfist]] have moved the supplies they stole from our village to the twin clefts of Nagrand, found west of here in the [[Halaani Basin]].

While you are in the area, keep your eye out for the supply crates. If we can get those back, it would ease much of the burden that has fallen upon the matrons of Garadar.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Ogre Mauler's Badge|Ogre Handler's Shooter|Ogre Basher's Slippers}}

You will also receive:
*11300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|78|}} at level 70)
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]

==Progress==
The children might be able to go a day without feeling hunger pangs.

==Completion==
Most of our possessions were destroyed or stolen in the attacks. I cannot offer you much, but there are some items that you may find useful...
