==Objectives==
[[Lantresor of the Blade]] at the [[Burning Blade Ruins]] in [[Nagrand]] wants you to drive 10 [[Warmaul Ogre Banner]]s through the bodies of Kil'sorrow members at Kil'sorrow Fortress.

Return any unused Warmaul Ogre Banners.

==Description==
<Lantresor hands you a pack full of banners.>

These are Warmaul ogre banners that I recently acquired.

I want you to travel to Kil'sorrow Fortress, directly south of here, and kill as many of the Kil'sorrow filth as you can find. Drive a Warmaul ogre banner through the heart of each fallen Kil'sorrow soldier. Return to me when you have completed this task and the other that this plan requires.

==Completion==
Can you imagine their puzzlement over what is happening, <race>? This will be glorious.

==Progression==
