==Objectives==
The plans that start this quest drop off [[Murkblood Invader]]s who wander in groups of three on elekks along the roads of Nagrand.
 
Take the Murkblood Invasion Plans to [[Garrosh]].
*[[Murkblood Invasion Plans]] (provided)

==Description==
The parchment holds a crudely painted map of [[Nagrand]]. There is a big red 'X' where [[Garadar]] would be on the map. It would seem that these savages are planning an attack on the city. Take the Murkblood invasion plans to [[Garrosh]] in [[Garadar]].

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at level 70)
*500 [[reputation]] with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]

==Progress==
What is it?

==Completion==
<Garrosh crumples up the map and throws it into the fire.>

What's the use? They've been attacking us for weeks. This is nothing new.

Don't you understand? We're done for... Greatmother Geyah is dying.
