==Objectives==
Give the Bundle of Skins to [[Harold Lane]] at the Nesingwary Safari in [[Nagrand]].
*[[Bundle of Skins]] (provided)

==Description==
I don't mind sharing. I'm just glad to be saved from that creep, [[Gankly Rottenfist|Gankly]]! And I collected tons of skins from [[Zangarmarsh]], so it's no problem at all!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|30|}}
*11000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Kristen is a very nice...<cough>... person to share her skins, wouldn't you agree?

==Completion==
Well, I couldn't see if you helped out with saving Kristen, or not.  But if she handed you one of her bundles of skins then you're alright in my book.

Here's your reward.

==Notes==
It isn't necessary to be in the group that kills Rottenfist to save her; as long as she's been saved and is still up, she will let you start the quest.
