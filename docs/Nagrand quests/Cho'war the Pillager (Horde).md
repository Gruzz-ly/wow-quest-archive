Cho'war the Pillager is the 3rd quest in the '''Missing Mag'hari Procession''' quest chain.

==Objectives==
Elder Yorley at the Mag'hari Procession in Nagrand has asked that you slay [[Cho'war the Pillager]] and retrieve the Head of Cho'war.
*[[Head of Cho'war]]

==Description==
Have you ever seen an ogre king, <race>? Few have and lived to tell the tale. Unfortunately, that is exactly what we are dealing with here.

The leader of these barbarians is an ogre named Cho'war. Rumor has it that Cho'war was the ogre responsible for forcing the gronn out of the cave. Cho'war then declared himself king and dissolved the ogre clans that served under the gronn. Thus, Warmaul was born.

Find Cho'war deep in the caves of Warmaul Hill. Slay him and bring me his head.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ogre Slayer's Cover|Ogre Slayer's Pendant|Ogre Slayer's Band

You will also receive:
*{{cost|g=7|s=40}}
*14600 [[XP]] (or {{cost|g=8|s=76}} at level 70)
*700 with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]

==Progress==
He will undoubtedly be heavily guarded.

==Completion==
This head will be posted at the gates of Garadar for all to see. The ogres will think twice before interrupting sacred Mag'hari rituals.
