==Description==
<Gurgthock is counting his massive pile of gold.>

You've made me a lot of money, kid. If you can defeat [[Mogor]], I promise to make it worth your while. All that pain you suffered in [[The Ring of Blood]] is gonna end up paying off.

Now get in there and show these [[ogres]] what you're made of!

==Progress==
The fight's over when you or your opponent are dead on the floor.

==Completion==
Gurgthock told you he'd make it worth your while, kid.  Take your pick! 

==Notes==
All along, there's been an Ogre taunting the competitors. After he sees the Warmaul Champion fall, Mogor decides to teach you a lesson personally! He's tough, but easier than the champion. Once you kill him, he'll Reincarnate and attack faster and a bit stronger (hitting plated classes for 1000), so be careful of that. He will use [[Chain Lightning]], [[Totems]] and [[Healing Wave]], so keep the party spread out.

Note: With well-timed use of [[Spell Reflection]], a warrior level 64 or higher can completely negate Mogor's Chain Lightning and deal considerable damage back to him. His Healing Wave is not interruptible, but its results can be reduced with Mortal Strike or a rogue's Wound Poison. However, his heals are not very powerful, and a decently-geared group should do fine with either Spell Reflection or by spreading out in anticipation of the Chain Lightning.
