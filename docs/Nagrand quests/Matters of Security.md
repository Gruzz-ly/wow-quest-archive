==Objectives==
[[Zerid]] at [[Aeris Landing]] in [[Nagrand]] wants you to kill 12 Voidspawn near [[Oshu'gun]].
*[[Voidspawn]] slain (12)

==Description==
[[Gezhe]] chose to base our operations as close to Oshu'gun as possible, without any regard for the safety of our crew. Why? Because he projected a ten percent increase in productivity by setting up shop here instead of in the mountains to the south.

Never mind the crazed voidspawn wandering all of ten feet away from us. That would be the security officer's problem, not Gezhe's.

Kill some voidspawn for me and I'll pay you a tenth of our security budget. Don't get excited, it's not much of a budget.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|3|50|}}
*11300 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Consortium|The Consortium]]

==Progress==
Did you take care of the voidspawn, <name>?

==Completion==
You bring a smile to my face, <name>.  Or you would, rather, if I had a face.

Keep it up and you and I are going to be the best of friends.
