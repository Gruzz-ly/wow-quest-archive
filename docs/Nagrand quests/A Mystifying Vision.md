==Objectives==
Speak with [[Rocket-Chief Fuselage]] at [[Area 52]].

==Description==
A strange vision haunts me, <name>. I see a continuous cloud of smoke ascending toward the sky, left in the wake of a giant fire moving ever faster away. It is not a natural phenomenon, nor a creation of evil; that much I know.

I have no knowledge of what it looks like, save that it is the product of the labor of many. Yet, without more hands, it may never come to be.

Travel to [[Netherstorm]], <class>. Locate those responsible for this creation and offer them your aid.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,040 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The chief listens as you describe the seer's vision.>

Well, I don't know about any of that, but we could certainly use your help around here. Look at the behemoth behind me. That's the [[X-52 Nether-Rocket|X-52]]...

Isn't it the most beautiful thing you've ever seen?
