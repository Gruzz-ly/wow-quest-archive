==Objectives==
Jorin Deadeye at [[Garadar]] in [[Nagrand]] has asked that you slay 10 Boulderfist Warriors and 10 Boulderfist Mages.
*[[Boulderfist Warrior]] slain (10)
*[[Boulderfist Mage]] slain (10)

==Description==
Directly west of here you will find the Halaani Basin. Within the basin are the twin clefts of Nagrand: Northwind and Southwind. Boulderfist shock troops use the clefts to hide their [[ogre mound]]s.

I need you to track down those troops and kill all that you encounter in the name of Mag'har.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Staff of the Four Golden Coins|Bracers of the Battle Cleric|King's Bulwark}}

You will also receive:
*14150 [[XP]] (or {{cost|8|49|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
They must be reminded that we are a force to be reckoned with in this region.

==Completion==
If this does not freeze the blood in their veins, nothing will. You have done the Mag'har justice, &lt;name&gt;. And for justice, Mag'har rewards greatly.
