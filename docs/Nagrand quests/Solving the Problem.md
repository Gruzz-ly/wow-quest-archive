==Objectives==
Poli'lukluk the Wiser at [[Telaar]] in [[Nagrand]] wants you to kill 20 Murkblood Scavengers and 10 Murkblood Raiders. <!-- Seems numbers here were reduced at some point in wotlk. Not sure exactly when. -->
*[[Murkblood Raider]] slain (10)
*[[Murkblood Scavenger]] slain (20)

==Description==
The appearance of the Murkblood in [[Nagrand]] has had a profound negative impact on our environment. The elementals are all in flux which has, in turn, greatly disturbed the wildlife. Worse yet, the razing of Sunspring Post has reignited the hatred that the orcs held for our people.

While the Kurenai are a different tribe than the Murkblood, all an orc sees is Broken.

We must make an effort to solve this dilemma. Travel to Sunspring Post, northwest of here, and resolve the Murkblood problem.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Greenblood Pantaloons|Caustic Feelers|Dark Shaman's Cover}}
You will also receive:
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at level 70)
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Kurenai]]

==Progress==
Murkblood are a nefarious tribe of Broken, <name>. They may look like Kurenai but they are most assuredly savage, murdering beasts.

==Completion==
It is doubtful that the orcs will understand or appreciate what you just did but [[Nagrand]] is better off for the deed. Thank you, problem solver...
