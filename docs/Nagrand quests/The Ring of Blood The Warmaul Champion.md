==Objectives==
Defeat the Warmaul Champion.
*The [[Warmaul Champion]] Defeated
*Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
They had to ship the champion in from the [[Blade's Edge Mountains|Blade's Edge]] gladiator pits. He was training on mountain giants - three at a time.

If you win this one, you become the new champion. What do you think your odds are, kid? Do you have a shot? Just give me the word and I'll bet the house on you.

Now get in there and win!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|10}}
*14600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The fight's over when you or your opponent are dead on the floor.

==Completion==
Oh boy. [[Mogor]] has invoked his right of battle as hero of the Warmaul. You have to fight him!

Nobody ever said the Warmaul were good sports... erm... ogres.

==Notes==
You're in the big leagues now! The Warmaul Champion is either an [[orc]], [[fel orc]], [[ogre]], [[Lost One]], or [[ethereal]] - this is chosen at random, and he is always lvl 67 elite. He's the hardest fight in the arena.  He hits hard, too, so be wary. He does [[Mortal Strike]], along with random charges at your group members. Once the Champion is eating dirt, there's only one final task...
