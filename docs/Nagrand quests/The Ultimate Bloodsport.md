'''This quest''' involves the killing of Tusker, a large white [[elite]] [[Elekk]] in southwestern [[Nagrand]]. Tusker has approximately 25000 health, and it is recommended that you take at least three people, though the quest says two.

This quest is the final part of the {{questchain|The Nagrand Safari}} quest chain.  Completing it awards the [[Hills Like White Elekk]] achievement.

== Objectives ==
Bring the Heart of Tusker to [[Hemet Nesingwary]] at [[Nesingwary Safari|Nesingwary's Safari]] in [[Nagrand]].
*[[Heart of Tusker]]

== Description ==
The queen of all that dwell in Nagrand is known as [[Tusker]]. She's a giant [[elekk]] the likes of which you won't see anywhere else!

You're right to be fearful of that name. [[Bach'lor]], [[Gutripper]], and [[Banthar]] are nothing when compared to her. It is said that she can be found on a huge bluff far to the southwest overlooking [[Oshu'gun]]. Bring me her massive heart if you dare.

Do you want to leave a letter with me so that I can have it delivered to your next of kin in the likely event that you don't return?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of the following:|Nesingwary Safari Stick|Hemet's Elekk Gun}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}
*17,950 [[XP]] (or a {{cost|11|70}} compensation at level 80)

== Progress ==
There's no shame in admitting that you haven't the spine to hunt the mightiest of animals this land has to offer, <name>.

== Completion ==
<Name>! You bring joy to this old dwarf's heart.

You have now proven yourself; you've joined the ranks of the elite! Others ran away in fear, or died, trampled under the foot of the beast. You used your mind, your cunning, your determination to prove your mastery of the hunt.

Take this and know that you are always welcome to hunt at my side!

==Notes==
Tusker is located on a small cliff overlooking [[Oshu'gun]], around 44, 65.
