==Objectives==
Farseer Margadesh at [[Garadar]] in [[Nagrand]] wants you to bring him the Head of [[Ortor of Murkblood]].
*[[Head of Ortor of Murkblood]]

==Description==
We have lost many friends in recent weeks.

For decades we have dealt with the ogres of [[Nagrand]] but now a new threat has arisen. The Broken tribe of Murkblood attacked our fishing village to the southwest, Sunspring Post, and managed to kill or evict all of the orcs that inhabited the town.

While the others feel that the best course of action is to kill indiscriminately, I know that we must destroy their leadership. I do not know who their leader is but I suspect that you will know when you find him.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Eighty Silver Links|Murkblood Oven Mitts|Murkblood Avenger's Legplates}}

You will also receive:
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at max level)
*500 [[reputation]] with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]

==Progress==
Bring me their leader's head, <name>.

==Completion==
So, this is the face of our enemy? I will have this put upon a pike and placed outside of [[Garadar]], near the gates. Should they think to attack us again, they will see the consequences for their actions looking down upon them...
