==Objectives==
Defeat the [[Murkblood Twin|Murkblood Twins]] that call themselves the Blue Brothers.  	
*The Blue Brothers Defeated
*Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
This next battle involves a duo - twin brothers to be precise. They call themselves the "Blue Brothers."

It's not too late to chicken out, <name>. I'd certainly understand.

But if you're ready for some action, step in the Ring of Blood and wait for the Murkblood twins to arrive.

Last one standing is the winner!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|10}}
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Kurenai]] {{Alliance}} / +10 reputation with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]] {{Horde}}

==Progress==
The fight's over when you or your opponent are dead on the floor.

==Completion==
I'll admit that I didn't think you had a prayer, <name>! That was amazing! So how 'bout another fight? Gurgthock's got the perfect match lined up.

==Notes and trivia==
Round two of [[The Ring of Blood]]. This time you will be facing 2 [[Broken]], both melee, both 65 elites. Kill them one at a time and 
you should have no problems here. Have the tank start the event, to get initial aggro.

The name is likely a reference to the film {{Wp|Blues Brothers}}.
