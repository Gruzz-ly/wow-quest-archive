You must deliver '''Kroghan's Report''' to Shadowmoon Valley to explain his absence. Speak with [[Blood Guard Gulmok]] at [[Shadowmoon Village]] of this.

==Objectives==
Speak with Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village.

==Description==
My original orders were to remain in [[Garadar]] for a short time, then continue on and report to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village. What I've seen in my time here is that Garadar could benefit from a long term Horde liaison.

I know that Blood Guard Gulmok needs all the troops he can get, but I know he'll understand that my mission here isn't yet complete. Travel to Shadowmoon Village, in northwestern Shadowmoon Valley, and inform Blood Guard Gulmok of my delayed arrival.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1150 [[XP]] (or {{cost||69|}} at 70}

==Completion==
<Gulmok grumbles upon hearing of Kroghan's decision.>

I understand his point of view, but we need warm bodies in the trenches here too! The Legion's bombarding us with [[infernals]] day and night. If Kroghan's going to be delayed, you can take his place on the field!  

==Progression==
