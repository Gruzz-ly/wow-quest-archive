==Objectives==
Jorin Deadeye has asked that you find and speak with [[Kilrath]].

==Description==
I have escaped certain death, surviving a cowardly nighttime attack by Boulderfist ogres upon my village.

But I ask you, stranger: For what?

<Jorin points to Garrosh.>

He has refused to give us assistance. Ogres are rampaging through my town and he sits here, weeping into a fire. What has become of us? What will become of us?

I've sent a scout, [[Kilrath]], to the village, now the Bleeding Hollow Ruins. Will you find him and give him your assistance? He hides on the border of [[Nagrand]] and Terokkar.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2700 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|62|}} at max level)

==Completion==
<Kilrath speaks in a hushed tone.>

These ogres are extremely peculiar. They are also extremely stupid. Look how the fat one makes the, um, lesser fat ones dance. It's mesmerizing.
