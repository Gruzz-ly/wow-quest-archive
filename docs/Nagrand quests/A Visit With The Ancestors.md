This quest is part of the [[Hero of the Mag'har quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Mother Kashur]] at the Ancestral Grounds in [[Nagrand]] has asked that you visit [[Sunspring Post]],  [[Laughing Skull Ruins]], [[Garadar]] and [[Bleeding Hollow Ruins]].
*Visit Sunspring Post
*Visit Laughing Skull Clan Ruins
*Visit Garadar
*Visit Bleeding Hollow Clan Ruins

==Description==
I need for you to journey to the villages of the ancestors, <Name>. Seek each one out and see if the ancestors remain.

Visit [[Sunspring Post]] to the north, visit the [[Laughing Skull Ruins]] far to the north against the mountains, visit [[Garadar]] to the northeast, and finally, visit the [[Bleeding Hollow Ruins]] on the borders of [[Nagrand]] and the [[Terokkar]] Forest, to the east.

Return to me once you have observed the ancestors in their homes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20}} at level 70)
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]

==Progress==
Move as the wind, <name>.

==Completion==
This is very troubling. You say that none of the ancestors were at their villages? That they were all moving south?

==Notes==
When you go to one of the towns, you will see [[Vision of the Forgotten]] that appears to be a tiny [[Naaru]]. It will whisper things to you. Such as,

"Turn back, mortal... This is not your battle."

"We are infinite...eternal."

"You cannot stop them..."

"They lack control...Oshu'gun calls to them..."

"It is a beacon. A remnant  of a forgotten era."

You can be on a flying mount when completing this quest, but must be fairly close to the ground.

Locations:
:Sunspring Post: 31,42
:Laughing Skull Clan Ruins: 45,24
:Garadar: 56,36
:Bleeding Hollow Clan Ruins: 20,61 ([[Terokkar]] Coords)

The Bleeding Hollow ruins are Terokkar Coords because the ruins are IN Terokkar. The trail along 78,82 will lead you right to them.
