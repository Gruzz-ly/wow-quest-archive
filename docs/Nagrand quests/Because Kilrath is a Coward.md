==Objectives==
Take the information that you beat out of [[Unkor]] to [[Jorin Deadeye]] at [[Garadar]] in [[Nagrand]].

==Description==
Take what you have learned and tell Jorin at Garadar. I can assure you that he won't be happy to know that our village was destroyed and many of our people killed because the [[ogre]]s needed more space.

May the ancestors watch over you... I will be hiding in the bushes if you need me for anything else.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2700 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|62|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]

==Completion==
So they think that they are within their rights to displace and slaughter [[orc]]s on a whim, eh? I'm sure that this had nothing to do with our leader being an impotent whelp... If only he'd gotten a fraction of the passion that his father had...
