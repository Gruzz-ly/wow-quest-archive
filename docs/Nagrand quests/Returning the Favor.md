Return any unused Kil'sorrow Banners. 
*Kil'sorrow Banner Planted (10)

==Description==
Now you must plant the seed of war in the fat, useless heads of the Warmaul. To the northwest, near the mountains, you will find the Laughing Skull Ruins.

<Lantresor points into the crate of armaments you brought him.>

Do you recognize those banners? They are Kil'sorrow banners. I want you to take a stack of Kil'sorrow banners and plant them on the corpses of Warmaul ogres. Remember, northwest is where you will find the ogres.
