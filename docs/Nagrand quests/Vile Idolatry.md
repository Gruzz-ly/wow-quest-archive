==Objectives==
Farseer Kurkush at [[Garadar]] in [[Nagrand]] wants you to bring him 20 Murkblood Idols.
*[[Murkblood Idol]] (20)

==Description==
With our leadership in ruin, we are left open to attacks from all sides. The foul [[Murkblood tribe]] could not have picked a better time to attack us!

In recent days, we have been subject to no less than 5 assaults from the [[Broken]]. They have even taken over our only other territorial holding in the area: [[Sunspring Post]].

We must strike and show them that we are not powerless! Strike down the vile idolaters and bring me their twisted idols of worship so that they may ride the lightning.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Warcaster's Scaled Leggings|Murkblood Avenger's Chestplate|Melia's Lustrous Crown}}
You will also receive:
*11300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|78|}} at max level)
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]

==Progress==
Do this for us because we cannot do it for ourselves.

==Completion==
You have given the Lightning Sons hope, &lt;name&gt;. If our leader will not protect us, perhaps there are others that are capable - like you.
