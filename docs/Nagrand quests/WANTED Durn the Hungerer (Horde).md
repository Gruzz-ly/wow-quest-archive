Slay [[Durn the Hungerer]]. Return to [[Warden Bullrok]] if you manage to complete this task.

You have destroyed two of the biggest threats in [[Nagrand]], <name>. Are you ready to take on the scourge of the [[Spirit Fields]]?

Durn the Hungerer lords over the area surrounding [[Oshu'gun]], decimating all in his path. Thus far, none have been able to rid Nagrand of this ferocious [[gronn]]. Venture to the Spirit Fields, far southwest of here, near Oshu'gun, and track down Durn. Slay him and I assure you rewards commensurate with the difficulty of the task at hand.
