This quest is part of the [[Hero of the Mag'har quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Mother Kashur]] has asked that you put to rest 8 Agitated Orc Spirits.
*[[Agitated Orc Spirit]] slain (8)

==Description==
Do you see them walking around us? The [[Ancestral Grounds]] are normally quiet and undisturbed.

As of late, the ancestral spirits have risen and are extremely agitated. Something is causing a great disturbance to the spirits. We must discover what that something could be, but first, we must put the immediate threat to rest.

These [[ghost]]s that you see walking about are not truly the ancestors but a representation of their state of being. You must destroy the agitated orc spirits.  Do this and return to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|20}} at max level)
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Mag'har (faction)|The Mag'har]]

==Progress==
You do not need a potion to see spirits, <name>.

==Completion==
It's no use. They continue to rise. There must be something more insidious underway.

==Notes==
Some people have found that Mother Kashur disappeared while they were out laying to rest the spirits.  Relogging apparently fixed this problem.

==Progression==
