==Objectives==
[[Elementalist Lo'ap]] at the Throne of the Elements in [[Nagrand]] wants you to destroy the Large Hut, the Western Hut, the Southern Hut and the Eastern Hut at Windyreed Village.

Return the Living Fire to Elementalist Lo'ap when the task is complete.
* Large Hut destroyed
* Western Hut destroyed
* Southern Hut destroyed
* Eastern Hut destroyed
* [[Living Fire]] (provided)

==Description==
The wretched Lost Ones, heretofore banished to the swamps of Zangarmarsh, are seeking to spread their filth to other parts of our world.

I have sought the wisdom of the furies and gained their blessing. To stop the source, we must unleash the elements upon them!

I give you living fire, plucked from the fiery essence of Incineratus himself. Travel to Windyreed Village, southeast of here, and unleash the living fire upon their huts! Let them see the fury of the elements!

==Rewards==
* 11,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
With great shame I tell you that it is my own kin who seek to drudge up the waters of Nagrand and create marshland. 

==Completion==
Your efforts have stifled the spread of pollution but other troubles have surfaced.

==Notes==
The huts are very close together, walk up the ramp into each hut and use the [[Living Fire]] to burn.

* Large Hut {{co|72|50|Nagrand}}
* Western Hut {{co|70|51|Nagrand}}
* Southern Hut {{co|71|53|Nagrand}}
* Eastern Hut {{co|72|54|Nagrand}}

Presumably, it means "Burn Burn Burn". This text is referenced in the flavor text of [[Sho'ravon, Greatstaff of Annihilation]].
