==Objectives==
Elementalist Morgh at the Throne of the Elements in [[Nagrand]] wants you to slay 8 Murkblood Putrifiers.
*[[Murkblood Putrifier]] slain (8)

==Description==
Murkblood are capturing and torturing the spirits of air! Murkblood are my kin: A tribe of the Broken who serve the vile [[Swamplord Musel'ek|Musel'ek]], beast lord of Coilfang.

The air spirit states that the Murkblood putrifiers are capturing other spirits of air and using them to sow chaos into the ranks of the elements. It would seem that the Murkblood have recently sacked an orc village to the southwest known as Sunspring and are using powerful elemental magic to disturb the lake. Find the putrifiers and destroy them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Spaulders of the Ring|Judicator's Gauntlets|Cord of the Ring}}

You will also receive:
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at max level)

==Progress==
The air spirit claims that the Murkblood are searching for something at Sunspring...

==Completion==
You saw them controlling the elements? The wind bent to their will?

<Morgh is lost in thought for a moment.>

This is troubling, <name>. I must consult with the others.

We thank you for your efforts, <name>. Perhaps you should return to your village and see if they have any other information about the Murkbloods and their nefarious goals.
