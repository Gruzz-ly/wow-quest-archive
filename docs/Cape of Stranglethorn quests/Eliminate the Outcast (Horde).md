==Objectives==
Travel to the Ruins of Aboraz in the Cape of Stranglethorn and deal with Zanzil the Outcast. 
*Deal with [[Zanzil the Outcast]]. 
*[[Chabal's Fetish]] (provided)

==Description==
You are to kill Zanzil. You rode on Hir'eek's wings and saw through Hir'eek's eyes; you know where Zanzil hides within the Ruins of Aboraz. Travel there and kill him.

Oh, and <race>: if we become separated, you should use this fetish. It only works within Stranglethorn, but it will transport you back here to me should you need to return switfly.

Good luck, <race>. Zanzil is no ordinary opponent. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|2500}}
*2,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You appear to be too late. Zanzil has left Aboraz.

==Progression==
{{Zanzil the Outcast chain}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
