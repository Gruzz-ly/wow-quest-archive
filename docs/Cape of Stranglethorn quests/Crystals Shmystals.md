==Objectives==
Retrieve [[Captain Grub Redcut|Grub Redcut]]'s treasure from his ship in [[Southern Savage Coast]].
*[[Worn Brass Key]]
*[[Gold Ingot]]

==Description==
Grub. Redcut. <Zeros spits.> A sore, crusty loser, who thinks he's all tough because he's big and buff. He hates that someone like me can make more [[money]] than him.

Believe it or not, I play the [[auction house]] fairly. I'm a saint compared to him!

So Grub sold my crystals, eh? And then paid [[Prospector Arty|Arty]] to lie about them so no one would go looking for them. A fine plan.

Grub must have something valuable on that ship of his. Well we're going to go take it. Search the ship thoroughly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=15|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Please hurry! [[Baron Revilgaz|The Baron]] wasn't kidding about my scales--I'm a [[Blue dragon|dragon]], as you know, and my scales are worth quite a lot.

==Completion==
What did you bring back?

==Notes==
Head to the ship at {{Co|34.46|84.77|Cape of Stranglethorn}} and kill Captain Grub Redcut to loot his key. Go below deck and open the [[Treasure Chest (Crystals Shmystals)|Treasure Chest]].

When all the items are collected, return to Zeros, who is surrounded by [[Baron Revilgaz]] and two [[Booty Bay Bruiser]]s.
:{{Text|say|Baron Revilgaz|Your time is up, Zeros. Did you think you could just fly away?}}

Zeros' gossip:
:Y-y-you returned just in time! Do you have what I need? Please!
