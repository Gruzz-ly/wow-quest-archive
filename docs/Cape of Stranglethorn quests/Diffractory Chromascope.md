==Objectives==
Obtain a Bloodsail Ruby and a Bloodsail Sapphire.
*[[Bloodsail Ruby]] 
*[[Bloodsail Sapphire]]

==Description==
To properly identify this artifact, I will need tools for analysis. A diffractory chromascope should suffice, I think.

I already have the mithril casing, which surprisingly, is the hardest part to find. We simply need two other pieces: a ruby and a sapphire.

There's pirates nearby, just to our south, and a bit farther to the east. Pirates love treasure... why don't you see if you can find some gems for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||25|}}
* 2,450 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
<Flem's eyes sparkle.>

Are those gems I see?

==Completion==
<Flem weighs the gems in his hands and nods in approval.>

Yes, these will do.  Now to perform the analysis...

<The goblin clacks the gems together for a while, then looks up at you.>

Oh, you're still here?  You don't think I'm a fraud or something, do you?
