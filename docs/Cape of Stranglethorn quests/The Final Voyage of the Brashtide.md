For '''The Final Voyage of the Brashtide''', speak with Kebok in Booty Bay to board a Bold Wind Rider. Then use the handbombs to kill 85 Brashtide Crewmen and destroy 6 Brashtide Attack Boats.

==Objectives==
[[Baron Revilgaz]] in [[Booty Bay]] wants you to kill 85 Brashtide Crewmen and 6 Brashtide Attack Boats
* [[Brashtide Crewman]] slain (85)
* [[Brashtide Attack Boat]] destroyed (6)

==Description==
We'll never survive this attack with all these worgen pirates pouring into the harbor from the north. Luckily, it looks like they're not armed with cannons, so if we can get you out of the harbor, you can attack from the skies.

Kebok, the Horde flight master's assistant, is right around the corner. Talk to him and let him know that you're going to need his bravest wind rider.

Bring a couple armloads of handbombs with you. You'll need all of them to stop those attack boats!

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]

==Completion==
I hope those mongrels know how to doggy paddle!

Actually, I take that back.
