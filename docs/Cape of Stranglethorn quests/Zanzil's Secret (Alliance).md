'''Zanzil's Secret''' is an Alliance quest from [[Explorers' League Digsite]] in [[The Cape of Stranglethorn]]. In this quest, players are sent to collect samples of a mixture created by the exile [[Zanzil the Outcast|Zanzil]] which causes those who drink it to become strong but feeble minded - similar to zombies.

==Objectives==
Obtain 5 vials of Zanzil's Mixture.
* [[Zanzil's Mixture]] (5)

==Description==
Years ago, the Gurubashi exiled one of their own from [[Zul'Gurub]]: a troll by the name of Zanzil. The reasons why aren't all that clear, but I'd guess it had something to do with his tendency to administer powerful, behavior-altering drugs to anyone he saw. Anyhow, the Gurubashi priests and their blood god have been slain, but [[Zanzil the Outcast]] remains...

...as do his powerful, behavior-altering drugs.

I need his mixture for my next test. Check the zombies to the north. 

==Rewards==
You will receive the following: {{Cost||30|}}

==Progress==
Excellent... you're not a zombie yet.  That's good.

Oh, umm... nothing.  It's just that... that was a potential risk.  Did I forget to warn you? 

==Completion==
<Dask carefully analyzes the strange compound.>

This mixture is... PERFECT!  Let's see what it does to your potentially-titan artifact here!

==Notes==
The creatures which drop [[Zanzil's Mixture]] can be found at both the [[Ruins of Jubuwal]] and the [[Ruins of Aboraz]]. Many players report a much better drop rate at the [[Ruins of Aboraz]], in addition to less tightly packed mobs. The monsters at [[Ruins of Jubuwal]] are in groups and it is difficult not to get swarmed. Aboraz is along the coastline, reachable either by beach or by a path leading east from the road, just south of Jubuwal.

The following mobs drop [[Zanzil's Mixture]]:
* {{RaceIcon|Naga|Male}}[[Zanzil Naga]]
* {{RaceIcon|Zombie}}[[Zanzil Hunter]]
* {{RaceIcon|Troll|Male}}[[Zanzil Witch Doctor]]
* {{RaceIcon|Troll|Male}}[[Zanzil Mindslave]]
* {{RaceIcon|Zombie}}[[Maury &quot;Club Foot&quot; Wilkins]]
* {{RaceIcon|Zombie}}[[Zanzil Zombie]]

;On completion
:{{text|say|Dask "The Flask" Gobfizzle says: Titan artifacts are largely inert. Something like Zanzil's mixture should have no effect whatsoever. Let's try it out!}}
:''(Big explosion)''
:{{text|say|Dask "The Flask" Gobfizzle says: That was... unexpected.}}
