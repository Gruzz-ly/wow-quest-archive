==Objectives==
Accuse 9 Bloodsail Corsairs of mutiny, then kill them.
*[[Bloodsail Corsair]] accused and killed (9)

==Description==
Before returning to Booty Bay, you should do everything you can to weaken the Bloodsail Buccaneers. Unfortunately, even as captain, you're prohibited from killing other buccaneers in cold blood. Only a Fleet Master can do that.

You can, however, put mutineers to the sword... and mutiny can be awfully hard to disprove.

Speaking of which, those Bloodsail corsairs that hang out on the lowest level of the ships have been acting awfully suspicious...

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Supposed Mace
|Accusing Finger
|Mutineer's Noose}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost||35}}
*3,300  [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]

==Completion==
The fewer Bloodsail Buccaneers that Booty Bay has to fight, the better.  However, it might be best to stop slaughtering your supposed allies before you draw suspicion to yourself.

==Progression==
{{The Bloodsail Buccaneers}}
