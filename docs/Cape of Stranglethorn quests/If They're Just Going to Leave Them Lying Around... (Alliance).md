==Objectives==
Obtain 6 Naga Icons from the Southern Savage Coast in the Cape of Stranglethorn.
*[[Naga Icon]] (6) 
 
==Description==
Father says that a responsible merchant is always keeping an eye out for good deals. I've been trying to look for deals everywhere I go, and I think I've just found one!

The naga to the west have dozens of statues that they place on the ground where they live. They couldn't possibly need all of them... so I was thinking that we'd take some for ourselves!

Free statues! That's a good deal, right? 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Amulet of Brilliant Talent
|Helm of Secrets
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Let's see 'em! 

==Completion==
These statues are beautiful...

Wow, I had no idea the naga were so talented.  Thanks, <name>!
