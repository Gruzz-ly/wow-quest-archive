I know ye just arrived here on the Crimson Veil, but I need to send ye off on another task. The Damsel's Luck is the third ship in me fleet, moored over to the east. Her skipper - Captain Stillwater - is no longer with us.

Damn those masked hoodlums!

Congratulations, matey. Ye be the new captain of the Damsel's Luck.
