==Objectives==
Obtain The Holy Water of Clarity from the [[Nek'mani Wellspring]] in the [[Cape of Stranglethorn]].  
*[[The Holy Water of Clarity]] 

== Description ==
Hey, listen. You don't look like any old tourist, and I'm in a bit of a pickle. My cousin up north sent me this weird artifact, and I need your help to... ah... identify it.

To start out, I'm going to need you to obtain The Holy Water of Clarity. Rumor has it that whoever drinks from this spring is given a vision of clarity.

Sounds pretty promising, doesn't it?

Obtain it from the Nek'mani Wellspring at the peak of the naga camp. Good luck! 


'''OR'''


Skeezy said you'd be coming. Let's identify this... thing.

To start out, I'm going to need you to obtain The Holy Water of Clarity. The nagas to our southeast maintain a hallowed shrine that dispenses a water so clean, so fresh, and so mouthwateringly pure, that when the imbiber quaffs but a mouthful of the sacred stuff, their mind is cleansed and their best path made clear.

Sounds good, doesn't it?

Obtain it from the Nek'mani Wellspring at the peak of the naga camp. Good luck!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||25|}}
*2,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
<Flem's ears perk up as you approach.>

The Holy Water of Clarity?  Is it here!?

== Completion ==
<The goblin downs the water in one gulp.>

Ahh... do you know how hard it is to get fresh water in Stranglethorn?  It's no wonder that the nagas guard their shrine so ferociously!

Oh, right... that artifact.  Clarity...
