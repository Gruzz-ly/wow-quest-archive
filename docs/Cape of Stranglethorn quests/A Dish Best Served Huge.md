==Objectives==
Bring the Giant Crate of Giant Food to Captain Smotts' lifeboat, then use it to summon and kill Negolash.  
*[[Negolash]] slain
*[[Giant Crate of Giant Food]] (provided)

==Description==
Take this food, and put it in our old lifeboat, southeast of here along the coast. When Negolash smells all that food, he'll come running!

And when he does, there will be a stouthearted <class> ready to knock his corpse back into the briny deep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1||}}
*3,600 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]
*-350 reputation with [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]]
*[[Smotts' Compass]]

==Progress==
Is it done, <race>?

==Completion==
I can't believe my fortune, <name>!  Meeting you has turned my luck to the better, make no mistake there!

If I ever get a new ship and you're looking to sail the seas, you would be my honored guest. 

==Notes==
Head towards the quest marker, then look just southwest of it on the coast. There is a clickable Ruined Lifeboat at {{coords|49|81|Cape of Stranglethorn}}, next to two palm trees.

==Progression==
{{The Captain's Chest}}
