==Objectives==
Obtain 4 Supple Tiger Furs and 4 Velvety Panther Furs.
* [[Supple Tigress Fur]] (4)
* [[Velvety Panther Fur]] (4)

== Description ==
I see clearly now... the key to identifying this mysterious talisman revolves around obtaining some rare and precious items. These Primal Reagents of Power, when properly combined, will reveal to us the origin of our treasure.

Travel north, to the western side of the Gurubashi Arena, and hunt the cats that roam the jungle. Their fleecy furs will lead us to the truth! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Velvet Choker
|Hideaway Staff
|Not-Scratchy Helm
|Not-Scratchy Faceguard
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Make sure the reagents are extra-cushy, <name>.  A scratchy reagent simply won't do. 

== Completion ==

Excellent work, <name>!  These reagents will serve perfectly.
