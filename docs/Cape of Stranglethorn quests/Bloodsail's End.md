'''Bloodsail's End''' has you killing the leader of the [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]], [[Fleet Master Firallon]]. 

==Objectives==
[[Baron Revilgaz]] in [[Booty Bay]] wants you to kill [[Fleet Master Firallon]]
* {{npc|neutral|Fleet Master Firallon}} slain

==Description==
We've nearly won the day, largely thanks to you. One task remains, however... kill Fleet Master Firallon.

It looks like most of Firallon's crew is already dead, but I know that old sea dog well enough to know that he's not done yet. No, he's cooped up tight in his cabin, ready to go down with his ship.

Speak with [[Kebok]] again to get a wind rider. I'll try to hold off the cannonfire while you're on board.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Booty Bay Pendant
|Booty Bay Pantaloons
|Booty Bay Helm
|Booty Bay Trousers
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||60|}}
* 2,150 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]

{{itembox||Star of Stranglethorn
}}

==Completion==
<Name>!  You're awake!  We found you bobbing in the harbor, shortly after the remaining attackers had turned tail.  We were worried about you for a while there...

I've been meaning to thank you, <name>.  Not only did you provide us with the intelligence to prepare for this attack, but you helped fight off the [[Bloodsail Buccaneers|Bloodsail]] AND the [[Brashtide crew|Brashtide]].  Your name will always be remembered here in Booty Bay.

We here in Booty Bay pride ourselves on our booty.  Care to take first pick?
