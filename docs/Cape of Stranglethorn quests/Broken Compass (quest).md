*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (700x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Completion==
Hello, are you here to buy herbs?

Oh, what's that, a compass? It certainly looks familiar.

That idiot.

He was always seeking his fortune somewhere and never finding it. Completely useless here at home, too. Couldn't keep an herb alive to save his life.

You know what? I'm glad he's lost at sea. Leave him there.

Here, I'll even give you his stash of Azerite, he would hate that.

Finally free to pursue my own interests, now that's a breath of fresh air. I wonder if [[Kirsty Logan|Kirsty]]'s still available...
