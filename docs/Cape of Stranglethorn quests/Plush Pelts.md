==Objectives==
Obtain 4 Supple Tiger Furs and 4 Velvety Panther Furs.
* [[Supple Tigress Fur]] (4)
* [[Velvety Panther Fur]] (4)

== Description ==
Hi, I'm the town merchant! And Bronwyn's my dad!

Sorry, I shouldn't get too excited. Father says it's not professional.

Anyhow, people always come to me asking for heavy leather, or rough hides, but I think they might also like it if I had some soft materials... like tiger fur! Think you could get some for me?

You'll find a few panthers nearby, but if you want to see the big tigers, you'll have to go northwest from here... north of that big troll arena.

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

== Progress ==
Oooh... I hope they're soft!

== Completion ==
<Linzi feels the hides and smiles to herself.>

These are so nice and cushy!  I think my customers are going to LOVE them!
