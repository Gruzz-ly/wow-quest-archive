==Objectives==
Bring Yer Papers to [[Captain Keelhaul]].
*[[Yer Papers]] (provided)

==Description==
Ye may be a slayer of Fleet Masters, but rules is rules and orders is orders. And MY orders say that all new pirates start out as swabbies. It's the rule.

You're to be working for Captain Keelhaul, the commander of [[the Riptide]]. It's the westernmost ship in the fleet, which is parked south of the tip o' the cape.

Find him in his captain's chambers, and bring yer papers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||25|}}
*2,150  [[XP]]

==Progress==
I trust y'got yer papers, swabbie.  I'd hate t'send ye all the way back to [[Yancey Grillsen|Yancey]].

==Completion==
Yes... yes... I see... well, everything appears to be in order.

Slayer of the great [[Fleet Master Seahorn|Seahorn]], eh?  That doesn't matter on MY ship.  Only thing you're gonna be slaying is deck stains.  Grab a mop.
