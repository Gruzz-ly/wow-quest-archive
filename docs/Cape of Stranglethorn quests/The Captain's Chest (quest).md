'''The Captain's Chest''' was stolen by a giant and he wants it back!

==Objectives==
Obtain Smotts' Chest from [[Gorlash]] in [[The Cape of Stranglethorn]].
*[[Smotts' Chest]]

==Description==
I used to sail a ship from here all the way to Ratchet, in Kalimdor. I was a successful captain with a sterling reputation.

Until...

Those cursed sea giants ruined me! They smashed my ship, killed my crew, and set me on a lifeboat to Booty Bay. And one of the giants, [[Gorlash]], stole my Captain's Chest. He said he wanted it for a snuffbox. The nerve! I hear Gorlash wanders the coast east of here. Find him and get back my chest! Do that, and you'll have earned a captain's gratitude.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Bloodband Bracers]]

==Progress==
Ahoy, <name>! Did you find Gorlash? That chest was my favorite, and it has a hidden compartment that held my greatest treasures!

==Completion==
You found it! Oh happy day, this is! Thank you, <name>. Getting back my chest cools some of the fire in me.

But my revenge isn't complete...

==Notes==
*Leave Booty Bay by the tunnel and turn east and head for the coast. You'll pass through an area of [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]]. Once you get to the coast, turn north. You'll find Gorlash at the water's edge.
*It is possible to kite Gorlash back to Booty Bay so the guards can help kill him.
