==Objectives==
[[First Mate Crazz]] wants you to check the cove north of [[Booty Bay]].

== Description ==
You sure seem eager to work, matey. Not sure why some land-loving <race> <class> is offering help to the Blackwater Raiders, but I'm not going to turn you away.

We've made Booty Bay our happy home away from the high seas, but word has it that the Bloodsail have some new plan cooked up. All me boys are too busy hitting the grog and looking for ladies! What I need is a scout.

Check the cove just north of Booty Bay along the Savage Coast and see what you find.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||25}}

== Completion ==
On top of the barrel, you discover a map with some hastily written text on it, along with some coins.

== Notes ==
The Bloodsail Correspondence is found at {{coords|41.2|61.2|Cape of Stranglethorn}}.
