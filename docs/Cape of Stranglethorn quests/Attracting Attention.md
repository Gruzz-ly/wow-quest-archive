Report to [[Fleet Master Firallon]] within the [[Crimson Veil]] in the [[Cape of Stranglethorn]].

==Description==
Swabbie <name>! This is a sad day fer ol' Cap'n Keelhaul. Today I lose m'best swabbie.

A letter's come in from Fleet Master Firallon. Apparently he's heard about the excellent swabbin' y'been doin', and he wants t'take ye aboard the Crimson Veil as his Jack o' Swords and third mate. She's moored just next t'the Riptide.

Piracy career-wise, this's a big step fer ye, Swabbie <name>. I recommend y'take his offer.

Dismissed!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||25}}
*2,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So ye be the one that did ol' [[Fleet Master Seahorn|Seahorn]]?  Yancey sent word, but I wanted to make sure he hadn't been telling his tall tales again.

I'll make it brief.  Ye did well on Keelhaul's crew, but I expect ye to do even better on mine.  I've got an entire fleet to attend to, so you'll be helpin' to run the day-to-day of me ship.

Welcome aboard the Crimson Veil, sailor.
