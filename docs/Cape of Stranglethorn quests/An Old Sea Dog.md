==Objectives==
Bring the Weather-Beaten Coin to [[Fleet Master Seahorn]] in [[Booty Bay]].
*[[Weather-Beaten Coin]] (provided)

==Description==
This old, weathered coin was found on the body of the pirate [["Good-Boy" Bruce]]. Its front side bears the image of a large, unfamiliar pirate ship; on its back side, the term "[[Brashtide crew|Brashtide Crew]]".

Someone who has been in the piracy business for some time might know what this coin is, or what it means.

==Progress==
What's that you've got there, <race>?  Let me see it.

==Completion==
That coin! Where did you get it?

Bruce... yes, I see. He was one of the [[Blackwater Raiders]] once. One of us, before [[Genn Greymane|Greymane]] closed the [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilneas]] ports and held his crew captive.

I know that what happened in [[Gilneas peninsula|Gilneas]] changed the people there, but I never expected them to change their loyalties. Especially not [["Good-Boy" Bruce|Bruce]].

If you wouldn't mind, could I keep the coin? I'll pay its worth in gold.
