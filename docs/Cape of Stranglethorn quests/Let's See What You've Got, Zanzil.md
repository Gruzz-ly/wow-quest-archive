*[[Gmurgl]] tested 
*[[Orgus]] tested  
*[[Captain Bartholomew Softbeard]] tested 
*[[Jasper's Jungle Cooler]] (provided)

==Description==
Visitors to [[Hardwrench Hideaway]] sign a number of waivers upon arrival, one of which allows us to perform basic tests on them. I'd say it's about time we invoked that clause again.

Actually, let's avoid poisoning our customers this time. Better for business.

<Jasper fills a pitcher with Zanzil's Mixture and some crushed ice.>

The Hideaway's southeastern tower serves as a temporary jail. "Hardwrench Hoosegow," we call it. Anyways, give the prisoners a drink and tell me what happens. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||22|}}
*1,900 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

==Completion==
You don't say!  Well, that certainly is interesting.  In that case...

Forget understanding how the stuff works!  I gotta get my hands on that recipe!
