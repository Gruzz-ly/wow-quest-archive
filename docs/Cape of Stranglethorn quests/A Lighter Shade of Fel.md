==Objectives==
Meet with [[Ph'el Oman|Oman]] in [[Booty Bay]].

==Description==
Dear <name>,

Greetings. I have taken some time and collected my thoughts after our encounter with [[Lord Banehollow]].

I have also sought those who have similarly survived his dark plan, and have gathered them to me in Booty Bay so that we can decide on a way forward.

We would ask that you meet us there.

Darkest regards,

Ph'el Oman

;Ph'el Oman's gossip
:Madam Sha--er, Lord Banehollow, was a poor teacher in many ways, clearly, but I have been given a taste of the Fel.

:I intend to drink deeply.

:One day I may bring this lesson back to my people. Or I may not. 

:It is my choice to make.

;[[Svat]]'s gossip
:Hey, I remember seein' your ugly mug back at the [[Darkmoon Faire]]. What's up?

;Alia Darkleaf
:Are we luckier than the ones who didn't make it?

:Stronger?

:Weaker?

;Agrox Gand
:I am going to get myself a [[Felsteed|Fel Steed]]. 

:One day.

;Tess Undertide
:Call me...

:[[Imp]] slayer.
