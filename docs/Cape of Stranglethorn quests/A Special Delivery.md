==Objectives==
Deliver the package to [[Hobart Grapplehammer]].
* Travel to [[Crapopolis]]
* [[Mysterious Package]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm glad you're finally here, <name>. I've got an important delivery to make and you're the [[goblin]] I trust most.

Yeah, yeah. I know that's not sayin' much, but it's hard to find good help these days!

This package is for Hobart Grapplehammer. He's got a workshop in Crapopolis and I need you to deliver it to him. He's been working on somethin' big lately!

Deliver the package and for the love of money... DON'T DROP IT!

You have no idea how long it took me to locate this thing!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
[[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] sure has some nerve threatening me in my own laboratory!

He thinks he can just do whatever he wants to whoever he wants...

==Completion==
Sassy Hardwrench asked you to deliver this package?

Ah! These must be the parts I ordered last month. I can finally begin the final round of testing on my latest invention!

;In the workshop
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Heard you're workin' on somethin' new, Hobart. Remember that I own the rights to anything you invent in perpetuity.}}
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|That contract is null and void! You forged my signature!}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|What a wild and unprovable accusation! Crapopolis and everything in it belongs to ME. Now get to work on MY new invention.}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Let's go, boys!}}
:''Gallywix and the [[Private Security]] leave.''
