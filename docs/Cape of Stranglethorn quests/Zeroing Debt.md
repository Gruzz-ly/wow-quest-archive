==Objectives==
Return to the Azure Archives.
*Use the [[Portal to the Azure Archives|portal]] to return to the [[Azure Archives]]

==Description==
I do hope that is the last we see of [[Baron Revilgaz|the Baron]]. Truth be told, I respect his seat of power in [[Stranglethorn]].

We were lucky to find [[Zeros]] still alive. He must have developed quite the positive relationship with the Baron before all this nonsense, or else he would not have been given so much time.

Let us return to the Archives.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 23,800 [[XP]]

|q2=10|Flightstones

==Progress==
Ahh...

==Completion==
I am rather spent from this mission, <name>. Let me rest for awhile.

==Notes==
Upon accept, Zeros takes the portal, and Senegos transforms into his troll form and does the same.

==Progression==
{{The Veiled Ossuary}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.1.0|note=Added.}}
