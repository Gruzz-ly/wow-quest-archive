==Objectives==
Bring 5 Mistvale Giblets to [["Shaky" Phillipe]] in [[Booty Bay]].
*[[Mistvale Giblets]] (5)

==Description==
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's people who don't pay their gambling debts! And there are a lot of people who owe me. Think you can help me collect?

First, there's "Shaky" Phillipe down by the docks. He owes me plenty after last week's game and I want my due! But to get it, we'll have to scare him.

Go out of town and hunt [[Elder Mistvale Gorilla|elder mistvale gorillas]]. Find a nice selection of giblets, then take them to Shaky. Don't let on that they're from an animal; let him think the worst.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2710 [[XP]] (or {{cost||6|60}} at max level)
*-250 [[reputation]] with [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]]
*+250 reputation with [[Booty Bay]]

==Progress==
Hey!  I don't like the look you're giving me, <mister/lady>.

==Completion==
Ack!  Where'd you get these?  No, don't tell me. I don't want to know!

Who sent you?  Sea Wolf?
