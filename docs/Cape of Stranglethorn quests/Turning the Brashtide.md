==Description==
The Brashtide are everywhere! The [[Baron Revilgaz|Baron's]] Booty Bay Bruisers are no match for their sheer numbers, I'm afraid.

While you're down here in the fray, why don't you help me get rid of a few of them?

When you're done, don't bother coming back here. I'll probably be pretty busy.
