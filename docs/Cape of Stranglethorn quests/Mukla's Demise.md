==Description==
<Name>, I now put my faith in you to help free me. The great Skymane King Mukla is my captor. He commands the beasts of this island, and they keep me here against my will with the aid of this chain. If you can slay him and find the key to this shackle, I shall be indebted to you greatly.

I often hear him to the southeast side of the island, but please be careful: he is not to be trifled with.

(King Mukla: "The massive skymane knows no predators... except you.")

==Progress==
I thank my ancestors someone has come to aid me. Do you have the key that will free me?

==Completion==
