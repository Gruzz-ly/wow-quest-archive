'''Fencing the Rose''' is a daily quest that turns the normally unsellable vendor trash [[Eternium Rose]] (rarely found inside the [[Blingtron 4000 Gift Package]]) into {{cost|200}}.

Players must be at least neutral with [[Booty Bay]], as the quest NPC is affiliated with that faction.

==Objectives==
* [[Eternium Rose]]

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Bag of Gold (quest reward)]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]

==Progress==
Looking to sell something?

==Completion==
Ah yes, an eternium rose.  I heard vendors suddenly stopped buying them... something about the resell value being too low.

You're in luck though, because I know a collector who still wants them.  In fact, I can take this one off your hands, but you'll have to come back tomorrow if you have another one to sell.
