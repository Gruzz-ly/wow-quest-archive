==Objectives==
Collect 1500 Gold Coins from [[Grub Redcut]]'s [[pirate]]s in the [[Southern Savage Coast]].
*[[Gold Coins (item)]] (1500)

==Description==
Grub Redcut and his crew are notorious for their love of [[money]]. They'll do anything for it.

I assume there is treasure to be had on his own ship, but just in case there isn't, there must be gold within their pockets. Will you do me the dirty business of collecting it?

I won't question your negotiation tactics--just don't kill them! I'm not trying to start a serious blood feud today.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
It's high time those [[pirate]]s learned they can't terrorize anyone they please.

==Completion==
Oh my gold, that looks like a hefty sum.

==Notes==
Head to the ship at {{Co|34.46|84.77|Cape of Stranglethorn}} and kill [[Dreadcut Corsair]]s, [[Grubby Deckhand]]s, and [[Seaspray Blaster]]s to loot their gold coins.

When all the items are collected, return to Zeros, who is surrounded by [[Baron Revilgaz]] and [[Booty Bay Bruiser]]s.
:{{Text|say|Baron Revilgaz|Your time is up, Zeros. Did you think you could just fly away?}}

Zeros' gossip:
:Y-y-you returned just in time! Do you have what I need? Please!
