==Objectives==
Find [[Blixrez Goodstitch]] in [[Tan-Your-Hide Leatherworks]] in [[Booty Bay]].

==Description==
Look, believe it or not, I'd be in [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]] already if it wasn't for unfinished business. Recent events have not been kind to me. I owe [[Baron Revilgaz|the Baron]], and nobody owes the Baron for long. He will absolutely find and skin me if I don't pay up.

I invested his [[money]] in these [[magic]] crystals, but their price just crashed on the market because of the front page ripper in the [[Booty Bay Journal]]. And the shipment of crystals is missing!

Someone must be plotting my demise. Perhaps the Goodstitches will help me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Completion==
...I shouldn't be surprised that no one will help me for free. Ask Blixrez his price.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|[[Senegos]]|Out with it, Zeros. Have you gotten yourself in trouble?}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|That [[goblin]] didn't seem to care much for you. Why didn't you simply eat him?}}
:{{Text|say|Zeros|H-he's the Baron!}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|And you are a [[blue dragon]]. Albeit a young one.}}
:{{Text|say|Zeros|Shh! I took on a more mature visage form to do business. Please, don't blow my cover!}}
:{{Text|say|Zeros|Besides... I don't like violence. I deal in gold, not blood.}}
:{{Text|say|Zeros|Everyone is your friend here -- until you're broke and need their time.}}
:{{Text|say|Zeros|Let's hope I've made at least one real friend all these years.}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|I believe you may handle this, <name>. Zeros seems to know what to do.}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|A short nap calls my name. You know where to find me.}}
:''Senegos teleports away.''
