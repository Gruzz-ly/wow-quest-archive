'''The Heart of Mokk''' is a step in curing [[Fin Fizracket]] of his [[Stranglethorn Fever]], who needs to eat the [[Heart of Mokk]] as a cure. However, [[Mokk the Savage]] isn't easy to find. One needs to enlist the help of [[Witch Doctor Unbagwa]] by giving him one [[Gorilla Fang]].

==Objectives==
Obtain 1 Gorilla Fang from [[Gorilla]]s in [[Feralas]], [[Stranglethorn Vale]], and [[Un'Goro Crater]].
* [[Gorilla Fang]]

==Progress==
Witch Doctor Unbagwa know what Mokk the Savage like.  Yes, yes!

Me speak with spirits and make he come, I do.

But other gorilla-beast like spirit talkin' too.  You protect Witch Doctor Unbagwa and I make he come to you.

Witch Doctor Unbagwa want something first.  You bring a Gorilla Fang and me start spirit talking! 

==Completion==
Witch Doctor Unbagwa like Gorilla Fangs!  For you I talk to spirits.  Make Mokk the Savage come.

You protect Witch Doctor Unbagwa from other Gorilla-beast though or no Mokk for you! 

==Notes==
[[Elder Mistvale Gorilla]]s, who drop Gorilla Fangs, wander around Mistvale Valley{{coords|50.8|55.0|Cape of Stranglethorn}}, right outside the cave{{coords|53.9|47.1|Cape of Stranglethorn}} where Unbagwa resides.

Upon turning in one Fang to Unbagwa, he will summon three waves of gorillas. The first wave consists of an [[Enraged Silverback Gorilla]]. After killing this one, [[Konda]] will come running into the cave. Having disposed of Konda, the player will finally face [[Mokk the Savage]].

Once dead, Mokk can be looted for the Heart of Mokk, which can then be turned in to Fin Fizracket in [[Booty Bay]]{{coords|41.8|72.8|Cape of Stranglethorn}}.

After successfully defending Witch Doctor Unbagwa, you will be able complete [[Stranglethorn Fever (quest)]].
