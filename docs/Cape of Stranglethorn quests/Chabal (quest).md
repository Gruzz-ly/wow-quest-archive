==Objectives==
Bring Sassy's Largesse to [[Chabal]] in [[Hardwrench Hideaway]].
*[[Sassy's Largesse]] (provided) 

==Description==
Chabal, that troll over by the botanical gardens/biological weapons lab, is a special guest. He's a representative of the Zandalari trolls, and has traveled quite far to stay with us.

<Sassy places some of the items you've collected in a small parcel and hands it to you.>

Here, give this to him. Tell him that the Zandalari are always welcome at Hardwrench Hideaway! And mention that referrals are key to maintaining our business!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3}}
*250 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

==Progress==
Care to explain yourself, <class>?

==Completion==
<The troll looks into the package.>

You have my thanks.

I have been waiting for you to approach me, <race>.  I have identified you as the most promising <race> here in this strange town.  I have a task for you, if you would be willing to take it.
