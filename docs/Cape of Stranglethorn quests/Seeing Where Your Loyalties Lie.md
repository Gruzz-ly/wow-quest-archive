==Objectives==
Obtain the Head of [[Fleet Master Seahorn]] in [[Booty Bay]].
*[[Head of Fleet Master Seahorn]]

==Description==
Thar be just one thing...

Yancey hears things. A few o' me hearties were pretty deep in their cups when they told me about some <race> <class> that came a-rollin' through the Southern Command lookin' for charts and orders. Even ran a couple o' good pirates through, <he/she> did.

Like I said, they were up to their eyeballs in grog, but still... a buccaneer's gotta trust his ears. So I've just got one small task for ye, one sent down from Firallon hisself...

Bring me the head of Fleet Master Seahorn.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35|}}
*3,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Firallon special-ordered this one himself.  Said the tauren's too much of a risk.

==Completion==
Well blow me down!  Now there's something ya don't see too often.

<Yancey reaches out and shakes your hand.>

Welcome aboard, <name>.  Plunder and booty await ye.

==Notes==
Do ''not'' go at war with Booty Bay to actually kill Seahorn! He won't drop the quest item. Instead, talk to him. He will offer [[Looks Like a Tauren Pirate to Me]], which will give you what you need.

==Progression==
