==Objectives==
Kill Mok'rash the Cleaver at [[Janeiro's Point]]. 
*[[Mok'rash the Cleaver]] slain

==Description==
Mok'rash the Cleaver is the last of the lot. And the largest, by my memory. Taller than a wave in a windstorm, with a beard like a kelp forest and a hammer like an oak tree.

He taunts me from Janeiro's Point, the island right off the end of this very pier. It's because of him that I'm still trapped here, living this lamentable landlubber's life.

If you can swim, then head out to Janeiro's Point and slay Mok'rash.

Take care, <name>. Mok'rash will not lay down as easily as his brothers. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1||}}.
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Smotts' Signet  
|Sea Song Epaulettes 
|Landlubber Headband  
|Sea Legs (Item)
|Landlubber Helm
}}

*4,350 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]
*-500 reputation with [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]]

==Progress==
I've been waiting for this moment, <name>.

==Completion==
Mok'rash... Negolash... Gorlash... they're all gone.

I suppose I have no excuses now.  I can return to the high seas and a life of pillage and booty!  And it's all thanks to you.

Now I just need to get myself a ship...
