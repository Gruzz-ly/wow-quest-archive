==Objectives==
Deal with [[Zanzil the Outcast]] and [[High Priest Venoxis]].

If you become lost or need to return to Zul'Gurub, speak with [[Chabal]] at [[Hardwrench Hideaway]].
*Deal with High Priest Venoxis
*[[Chabal's Fetish]] (provided)

==Description==
Venoxis was the second of the two priests that Zanzil planned to bring back from the dead. You have already succeeded in destroying the body of High Priestess Jeklik... Venoxis must be the next. 

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Chabal's Favorite Ring]]
*[[Boots of the Foolhardy]]
*[[Cloak of Great Endeavors]]

You will receive:
*{{cost||95}}
*4,050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I ask you to slay Zanzil the Outcast, a lowly, hermetic exile of the Gurubashi, and what do you do?  You dash headfirst into the Gurubashi capital and eliminate one of their High Priests!  Very nearly two!  Only one word suffices to explain such a rash and foolhardy endeavor:

Heroism.

Jin'do the Hexxer still walks within Zul'Gurub's walls, but he lost one of his legs when you crushed Jeklik.  Today's battle is ours.

==Notes==
#Upon entering the room:
#*{{text|yell|Zanzil the Outcast yells: You're back for more huh? Too bad, because I've got a stronger potion mixed up this time! Venoxis will live!}}
#Upon being rediced to 1 [[HP]]:
#*{{text|yell|Zanzil the Outcast yells: I can't take much more of this...}}
#*''Zanzil vanishes leaving behind one [[Zanzil's Elixir]]''
#*{{text|yell|Zanzil the Outcast yells: Here comes Zanzil!}}
#*{{Text|bossemote|Zanzil teleports to another location!}}
#*''Zanzil is reset to full health and battle starts over.''
#Upon killing Venoxis:
#*{{text|yell|Zanzil the Outcast yells: Nooo! Zanzil is a failure...}}
#*{{text|yell|Shade of the Hexxer yells: What's goin' on in here?}}
#*{{text|yell|Shade of the Hexxer yells: Zanzil! Finish with Venoxis, then we'll talk about your failures.}}
##If Zanzil is not dead (not at 1 hp) at this moment:
##*{{text|say|Zanzil the Outcast says: Yes, Jin'do.}}
##*{{text|say|Shade of the Hexxer says: And you. You've interferred with my plans for the last time.}}
#*{{text|say|Shade of the Hexxer says: Hakkar grows impatient. And so do I.}}
#*{{text|say|Shade of the Hexxer says: You may have sain Jeklik, but you will not leave Zul'Gurub alive.}}
#*{{text|yell|Shade of the Hexxer yells: Prepare to die!}}
#At this moment [[Sassy Hardwrench]] flies in on a [[Hardwrench Tour Balloon]]
#*{{text|yell|Sassy Hardwrench: And if you look to your right, you'll see...my friend, about to get killed!}}
#*{{text|yell|Sassy Hardwrench yells: Quick! Grab onto the ladder!}}
