==Objectives==
Obtain 6 Akiris Reeds from [[Naga Explorer]]s.
*[[Akiris Reed]] (6)

==Description==
Yes, can I help...

<[[Sassy Hardwrench|Sassy]]'s jaw drops to the floor.>

<name>! Is it really you?! Look how big and strong you've gotten! Let me feel that bicep!

Me? I've been trying to make my gold here in the jungle. We're mainly in resource acquisition, but we also do tourism.

I know, genius, right?

Hey, listen. I was thinking... the [[naga]] explorers to the south carry Akiris reeds, which we could sell, and use to stuff visitor mattresses. You interested in killing some naga? It'll be just like old times!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||25|}}
*5,320 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Let's see... we're going to need some shotguns for our nature hikes, rowboats for the oil rig day trip, and...

Oh, hey Boss <name>.  You're back already?

==Completion==
I knew you had it in you, boss-man.  You know what they say: You can take the <race> out of the islands, but you can't take the murderous tendencies out of <name>.
