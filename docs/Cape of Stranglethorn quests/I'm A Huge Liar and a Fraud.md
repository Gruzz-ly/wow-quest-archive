==Objectives==
Bring the Opened Mosh'ogg Bounty to [[Garley Lightrider]] at [[Booty Bay]] in the [[Cape of Stranglethorn]].  
*[[Opened Mosh'Ogg Bounty]] (provided)

== Description ==
I have no idea what this artifact is. I have no idea where I would even START finding out what it is.

In fact, I have no idea why anybody expected ME to be able to identify it in the first place.

I asked for water because I was thirsty. I asked for the jewelry and furs for... well, they're for my girlfriend.

Hopefully I can at least point you in the right direction. Garley Lightrider in Booty Bay is a member of the Reliquary, and might be of more use than me.

Sorry.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||8|}}
*2670 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

== Progress ==
Yes, <race>?  I'm quite busy. 

== Completion ==
Fascinating!

I'll need some time to study this.  Why don't you have a look around Booty Bay and come back later?
