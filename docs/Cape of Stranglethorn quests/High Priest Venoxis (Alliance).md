==Objectives==
Deal with [[Zanzil the Outcast]] and [[High Priest Venoxis]].

If you become lost or need to return to Zul'Gurub, speak with [[Maywiki]] at the [[Explorers' League Digsite]].
*Deal with High Priest Venoxis
*[[Maywiki's Fetish]] (provided)

==Description==
Venoxis was the second of the two priests that Zanzil planned to bring back from the dead. You have already succeeded in destroying the body of High Priestess Jeklik... Venoxis must be the next. 

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Maywiki's Favorite Ring]]
*[[Boots of the Foolhardy]]
*[[Cloak of Great Endeavors]]
You will also receive:
*{{cost||95}}
*4,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You've been on quite the adventure, I see.

==Completion==
I ask you to slay Zanzil the Outcast, a lowly, hermetic exile of the Gurubashi, and what do you do?  You dash headfirst into the Gurubashi capital and eliminate one of their High Priests!  Very nearly two!  Only one word suffices to explain such a rash and foolhardy endeavor:

Heroism.

Jin'do the Hexxer still walks within Zul'Gurub's walls, but he lost one of his legs when you crushed Jeklik.  Today's battle is ours.

==Notes==
When you go through the portal you emerge in a safe place. Short distance before you is a room with [[Zanzil the Outcast]] along with [[High Priest Venoxis]].
Venoxis is lying on the altar under the effect of [[Voodoo Juju]] spell. The room is full of [[Snake]], [[Adder]] and [[Water Snake]] critters.

Upon entering the room, Zanzil attacks the player with [[Lightning Bolt]] ability. He also throws [[Zanzil's Elixir]] around. When Zanzil's Elixir hit any critter in the room,
the affected critter is transformed into a [[Spirit of Venoxis]]. Spirit of Venoxis have single Heal ability. They immediately rush toward High Priest Venoxis and begin to heal him.

When Zanzin being reduced to 1 [[HP]] he vanishes leaving behind one bottle of [[Zanzil's Elixir]] object which stays around about 5-10 seconds. If used, the elixir heals the player for small amount of [[HP]].
About 20 seconds after vanishing, Zanzil teleports to new location, his health resets to full, and the battle begins over.

To progress with the encounter player need to kill High Priest Venoxis. When Venoxis is reduced to 1 [[HP]] [[Shade of the Hexxer]] rushes into the room. Upon assessing the situation Shade of the Hexxer casts [[Jin'do's Grasp]] upon the player (45 second stun) to give Zanzil time to revive the Venoxis. Meanwhile Shade of the Hexxer prepares to kill the player and start casting [[Jin'do's Rage]] (12 seconds cast).

At this moment [[Bronwyn Hewstrike]] appears above flying an [[Explorers' League Biplane]]. She drops a ladder down making a single pass over the room.

'''''Player should immediately click the ladder as soon as it's within range! If the player fails to escape Hexxer finishes his [[Jin'do's Rage]] (600-700K damage spell) instantly wiping all players in the area.'''''

Players will loose 10% durability and get ported to a graveyard in [[Northern Stranglethorn]]{{Coords|57|56|Northern Stranglethorn}} but the quest is will still complete. [[Maywiki's Fetish]] may be used to port to [[Maywiki]] to finish the quest.

If player manages to escape with Bronwyn's biplane he is transferred to [[Explorers' League Digsite]] and may immediately finish the quest with [[Maywiki]].
