==Objectives==
Slay 5 [[Jaguero Stalker]]s.
*[[Jaguero Stalker]] slain (5)

==Description==
These vicious jungle cats have been circling me for some time now. I watch them as closely as I can, but they seem to just... disappear into the grass.

How they snarl and hiss!

Don't get me wrong... I still want you to rescue me, but first, clear out some of these cats. I won't need to be rescued if I end up someone's dinner.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|3000}} (or {{coppercost|1620}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Please, my hero, dispose of the stalking panthers!

==Completion==
It's about time you returned.  I was beginning to worry that I was going to be eaten while you hunted.

A cat eating a princess... wouldn't that be a fancy feast?
