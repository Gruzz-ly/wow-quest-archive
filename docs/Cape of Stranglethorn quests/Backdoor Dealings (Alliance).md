==Objectives==
Place the Gurubashi Incense in front of the [[Totem of Hir'eek]], then listen to [[Zanzil the Outcast|Zanzil]]'s plot.
*Place incense in front of Totem of Hir'eek
*Spy on Zanzil
*[[Gurubashi Incense]] (provided)

==Description==
Zanzil the Outcast, an exile from the [[Gurubashi tribe]], is my quarry. Recently, I have heard tales from my brothers in the north about his planned reentry into society, starting with the [[Ambassador|emissary]] he sent to the [[Skullsplitter tribe|Skullsplitters]]. This is not good news.

I want you to peer into Zanzil's current plans. Take this incense, and place it in front of the [[bat]] totem in the [[Ruins of Jubuwal]], to the north. [[Hir'eek]] will guide you from there.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Veil of the Silent Listener]]
*[[Monnion of the Bat]]
*[[Small Pouch of Incense]]
*[[Spaulders of the Bat]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost||30}}
*2540 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You have not done as I asked, <race>. Perhaps I was wrong to have selected you for this task...

==Completion==
It is as I suspected.  Zanzil is too haughty to interfere with the squabbles between the [[Bloodscalp tribe|Bloodscalps]] and the Skullsplitters.  No, he is playing a part in a grander scheme... [[Jin'do|Jin'do the Hexxer]] is using him to help bring [[Hakkar the Soulflayer|Hakkar]] back to [[Zul'Gurub]].

It's good that we found this out now, because it offers us a simple solution.

==Notes==

Head north to the [[Ruins of Jubuwal]] and interact with the [[Totem of Hir'eek]].{{Coords|54|31.4|Cape of Stranglethorn}}
:This ancient totem is fashioned into the shape of a bat. It must be the totem that Maywiki spoke of.
:{{Gossip|Place the Incense at the foot of the statue.}}

Upon placing the Incense, the player is transformed into a form resembling a shadowy humanoid bat or [[gargoyle]], which automatically flies southeast out of Jubuwal, past the [[Explorers' League Digsite]], and into the [[Ruins of Aboraz]], where it lands on top of a wall. Zanzil the Outcast is standing below in front of a large bonfire. Just as the player arrives, the [[Shade of the Hexxer]] appears and walks up to Zanzil.
:{{Text|say|Zanzil the Outcast|Jin'do the Hexxer! It's been a while since I've seen that mask.}}
:{{Text|say|Zanzil the Outcast|What brings you out to my part of Stranglethorn? I'm not accustomed to taking visitors from the esteemed Zul'Gurub.}}
:{{Text|say|Shade of the Hexxer|You know well enough about why I'm here, Zanzil.}}
:{{Text|say|Shade of the Hexxer|The Gurubashi have fallen on hard times. I live, and [[Bloodlord Mandokir|Mandokir]] has returned... but the rest of us are gone.}}
:{{Text|say|Zanzil the Outcast|What a shame... but not a concern for an old exile like Zanzil.}}
:{{Text|say|Shade of the Hexxer|Well, Zanzil, I'd like to make it your concern. I've recovered the bodies of [[High Priestess Jeklik]] and [[High Priest Venoxis]].}}
:{{Text|say|Shade of the Hexxer|I remember what you can do with those elixirs of yours. Can your elixirs help out an old friend?}}
:{{Text|say|Zanzil the Outcast|Friend? You were among those who spit and threw stones, Jin'do. But let's let bygones be bygones, eh?}}
:{{Text|say|Zanzil the Outcast|So your bat and your snake need Zanzil's help? Very well. I'll see you inside Zul'Gurub... old friend.}}

As soon as the conversation ends, the player is transported back to the Totem of Hir'eek. Head back to Maywiki to turn in.
