==Objectives==
Speak with [[Fleet Master Firallon]] aboard the [[Crimson Veil]] off the coast of [[Stranglethorn Vale]].
* [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]] ([[Friendly]])
* [[Booty Bay]] ([[Hated]]) In order to be offered the quest.

==Description==
<Name>... yeah, I've heard of you. I've heard that you're no friend of [[Booty Bay]] - just like us Bloodsail Buccaneers. Fleet Master Firallon is looking for hale and hearty men just like you for a special mission.

If you're interested, head on out to the Crimson Veil and speak with him below decks. She's anchored off the [[Wild Coast]] east of here, next to [[The Riptide]] and the [[Damsel's Luck]].

== Rewards ==
* 650 [[XP]]
* 10 reputaion with Bloodsail Buccaneers (tested at Revered rep. unknown how much rep. loss with Steamwheedle though)
* At Honored Rep, 25 Reputation gained with Bloodsail Buccaneers.  Booty Bay Rep decreased 25 and other Steemwheedle factions decrease 12.5 rep.

==Completion==
Avast ye, scallywag.  I hears that ye be the type for a bit o' the skullduggery.  Well, if yer no friend of Booty Bay, then ye might have a special place with the Bloodsail Buccaneers.

Arrrrr...
