==Objectives==
Obtain [[Poobah's Tiara]], [[Poobah's Scepter]], [[Poobah's Slippers]], and [[Poobah's Diary]] from the apes on [[Jaguero Isle]].

==Description==
I understand that you're anxious to rescue me, but the time is not yet right.  First I'm going to need some of my things.

The gorillas and the monkeys on the other side of the island have taken most of my possessions.  I'll need my tiara, my scepter, my slippers, and my diary before I'm ready to leave.

What?  Stop looking at me like I'm some sort of insane person.  You don't know what it's like being a princess.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|3000}} (or {{coppercost|1620}} at max level)

==Progress==
I shudder to think what Mukla plans to do with me. 

==Completion==
<Poobah surveys her belongings.>

Looks like it's all here.  Alright, I think I'm ready to be rescued now.
