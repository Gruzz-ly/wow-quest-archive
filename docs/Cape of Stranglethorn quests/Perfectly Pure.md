'''Perfectly Pure''' is a quest in the [[Cape of Stranglethorn]].

==Objectives==
Obtain The Holy Water of Clarity from the [[Nek'mani Wellspring]] in the [[Cape of Stranglethorn]].
*[[Pure Water (item)]]

==Description==
This humour won't serve on its own. Too thick. WAY too thick.

The [[naga]]s to our west maintain a shrine that dispenses the only clean water this side of [[Duskwood]]. For most potions, I'll use river water, but [[Bronwyn Hewstrike|Bronwyn]] demands accuracy!

Obtain it from the Nek'mani Wellspring at the peak of the naga camp. Good luck!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||25}}
*2,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
<Dask looks eagerly at your pack as you approach.>

==Completion==
Do you know how hard it is to get fresh water in Stranglethorn? It's no wonder that the nagas guard their shrine so ferociously!

Alright, let's get this mix started!

==Notes==
Find [[The Holy Spring]] at the Wellspring and loot the Pure Water.
