==Objectives==
Kill 8 Bloodsail Sea Dogs and 8 Bloodsail Elder Magi, and bring back the Bloodsail Charts and the Bloodsail Orders. 
*[[Bloodsail Sea Dog]] slain (8) 
*[[Bloodsail Elder Magus]] slain (8)
*[[Bloodsail Charts]]
*[[Bloodsail Orders]] 

== Description ==
I want to know details, <name>. Our supremacy over the Bloodsail is due largely in part to our stronghold here in Booty Bay, but intelligence also plays a critical role.

The Bloodsail maintain a few meager camps to the south which they call their "Southern Command." Well, you're going to raid their excuse for a southern command, find their plans, and slaughter their men. Return with whatever information you can find. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Informant's Gloves
|Belt of Supremacy
|Sea Baron's Breastplate
|Pirate's Musket
|Cord of Supremacy
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]
* -350 reputation with [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]]

== Progress ==
Ahoy, <name>.  What word do you bring of the Bloodsail encampment to the south? 

== Completion ==
Perfect, <name>.  Now that we know their plan, it's just a matter of time.

And to think the fools have dropped anchor just off the cape.... 

==Progression==
{{The Bloodsail Buccaneers}}
