'''Results: Inconclusive''' is a quest in the [[Cape of Stranglethorn]]. 

==Objectives==
Bring the Opened Mosh'Ogg Bounty to [[Airwyn Bantamflax]] at [[Booty Bay]] in the [[Cape of Stranglethorn]].
*[[Opened Mosh'Ogg Bounty]] (provided)

==Description==
Well, we have no idea what this artifact is. It's old, older than dirt... but not titan. I'm completely dumbstruck.

Airwyn Bantamflax in Booty Bay is my direct superior. Our next step should be to inform her of this find. Please, would you bring it to her?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||8|}}.
*670 [[XP]]
*25 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
Yes, <race>?  I'm quite busy. 

==Completion==
Fascinating!

I'll need some time to study this.  Why don't you have a look around Booty Bay and come back later?
