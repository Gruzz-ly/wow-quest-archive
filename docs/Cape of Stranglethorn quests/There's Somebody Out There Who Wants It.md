==Objectives==
Obtain 7 of Sassy's Secret Ingredient from [[Thrashtail Basilisk|Thrashtail]] and [[Ironjaw Basilisk]]s in the [[Crystalvein Mine]].
*[[Sassy's Secret Ingredient]] (7) 

==Description==
So, while you're already all sweaty from doing all that other stuff, I was thinking I might grab you for one more task. You don't mind, do you?

The latest Science and Explosions journal just came in from [[Bilgewater Harbor]], and there's this article about this hot new reagent. Prices on the reagent are skyrocketing, and we're in prime position to capitalize!

<Sassy leans over and whispers the details into your ear.>

You got that? Good. You can find the basilisks in a cave, far to the east.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Basilisk Scale Necklace  
|Helm of Secrets#Horde
}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost||55}}
*3,050 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
I hope you used the extraction procedure we discussed.

==Completion==
Great!  These look... disgusting.  But probably pretty valuable.  Let's get to splitting these up.  Some for me, some for Jasper, some for Chabal...
