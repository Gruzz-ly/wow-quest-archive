==Objectives==
{{questportrait|ZanzilZG.jpg|Zanzil the Outcast|His potion-mixing days are at an end.}}
Travel to the Ruins of Aboraz in the Cape of Stranglethorn and deal with Zanzil the Outcast. 
*Deal with [[Zanzil the Outcast]]. 
*[[Maywiki's Fetish]] (provided)

==Description==
You are to kill Zanzil. You rode on Hir'eek's wings and saw through Hir'eek's eyes; you know where Zanzil hides within the Ruins of Aboraz. Travel there and kill him.

Oh, and <race>: if we become separated, you should use this fetish. It only works within Stranglethorn, but it will transport you back here to me should you need to return switfly.

Good luck, <race>. Zanzil is no ordinary opponent. 

==Rewards==
*You will receive:
*{{coppercost|2500}}
*2,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
{{questportrait|ZanzilZG.jpg|Zanzil the Outcast|Where has he gone?}}

==Progression==
