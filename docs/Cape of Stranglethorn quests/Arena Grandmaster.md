==Objectives==
Avast Lubber!   Bring me 12 trinkets of the Arena Master and then ye shall be a Grandmaster of the Gurubashi Arena!   Arrrr!
*[[Arena Master]] (12)

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Arena Grand Master]]

==Completion==
Much blood have you spilt on the Arena floor and I be glad to name you Grandmaster of the Arena!

==Notes==
Although the [[Arena Master]] requires level 35 to equip, the quest can be started at any level making this item popular for low level [[Twinks]]. The [[Dodge Rating]] used to give around 5% [[Dodge]], but [[patch 2.1]] reduced how much dodge any player under 34 from dodge rating making this give about 2% dodge instead. 3.1 made it even better for low level twinks, replacing the dodge with +12 stamina.

Also, be warned that the [[Arena Master]] trinkets do not stack, so to collect 12 for the hand-in, you will need 12 spare bag slots!

==Patch changes==
