==Objectives==
Return the spyglass.
*[[Magical Spyglass]]

==Description==
<This spyglass allows you to see far off into the distance, but looking through it for too long gives you a headache.

The lens appears to have been specifically crafted for someone else's eyes.

Given the intricate detail on the spyglass, they'd likely provide a hefty reward for its return.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (700x [[Azerite (resource)]])
*{{cost|11|70|}}
*8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Now what do you have there? Oh, oh oh OH, what is this!?

My spyglass!

Oh honey, I never thought I'd see you again. Do you know how expensive this thing was? I had to get the lens custom-made because of my right eye and all.

You didn't look through it, did you?

Listen, I don't tear up often, but I just might this time. It really means the world to me.

Here, all the Azerite I got, its yours. It's... worth a lot... oof. That hurts. You take it though, really. Take it. Go ahead. It's fine.
