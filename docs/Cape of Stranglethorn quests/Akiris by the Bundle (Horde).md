==Objectives==
Obtain 6 Akiris Reeds from [[Naga Explorer]]s.
*[[Akiris Reed]] (6)

==Description==
It's not easy running a combination 5-star exotic resort/jungle resource salvaging plant! That is, it wouldn't be easy, if I didn't have the organizational skills of a [[trade prince]]'s personal assistant!

The first trick is multitasking. For example: the naga explorers to our south carry a valuable ocean reed - Akiris reeds. We can sell these reeds to our clients overseas, and we can also stuff our visitors' mattresses with them! Come to think of it, we could probably use some more of that stuff. 

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost||25|}}
*2450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Let's see... we're going to need some [[Gun|shotguns]] for our nature hikes, rowboats for the [[Oil platform|oil rig]] day trip, and...

Oh, you're back already?

==Completion==
Hey hey!  Not bad, not bad at all!  You may have a future in resource acquisition.  Or hotel management.
