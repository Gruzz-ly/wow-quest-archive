==Objectives==
Report to [[Baron Revilgaz]] at [[Booty Bay]] in the [[Cape of Stranglethorn]].

==Description==
You feel like you've done just about enough damage, and you know the Bloodsail's battle plans. You've done everything that Baron Revilgaz has asked of you.

It's time to hang up the pirate hat and return to Booty Bay. The battle looms near.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35|}}
*3,300  [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]

==Completion==
The Brashtide!?  I thought they were dead and gone YEARS ago!

<Revilgaz listens intently as you relay the information you gathered.>

No, that absolutely makes sense.  And it's not good news either.  The Brashtide are formidable foes, and if their numbers are anywhere near what they were before they disappeared, we're in for a nasty battle.

==Progression==
{{The Bloodsail Buccaneers}}
