'''Pirate Foods and Superstitions''' is part of the third chapter of the [[Guest Relations]] storyline, first made available on 13 November.

Note that this quest involves interacting with NPCs in [[Booty Bay]], so characters that allied with the [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]] will need to at least tank the [[Booty Bay Bruiser]]s. All required NPCs are friendly for this quest.

==Objectives==
Help the Booty Bay Buccaneers figure out how to recreate [[Cooktholomew]]'s lucky feast.
* Ask [[Maru]] for a hint (Optional)
* [[Kelsey Yance|Search Booty Bay for clues about Cooktholomew]]
* [[Property of Cooktholomew|Bunk area searched]]
* [[Scowling Rosa|Find someone to make sense of the notes]]
* [[The Case of the Superstitious and Hungry Pirates]] (provided)

==Description==
Our trusty cook, Cooktholomew, was lost at sea. Quite tragic that was, but now all the more tragic for us here! We don't dare set sail again without the lucky feast ol' Cooktholomew would prepare for us before each voyage.

We've tried to make out his scribbles, but alas, we only managed to make the ink run.

Me matey here swears he heard Cooktholomew say once he only brought copies out to sea. If that be true, the originals must be back in Booty Bay, somewhere near his bunk!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 5x [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Progress==
;Before speaking with Scowling Rosa
:What'ch need, hun? If you're not looking to shop, maybe the Port Authority can help ya out.
;After
:Cooktholomew and I have spun many a yarn talking about words and language. He was a lot deeper than most folk around here gave him credit for.

==Completion==
<Scowling Rosa looks over the notes.>

This looks like a simple enough substitution cipher. It will take me about a day or so to work on it, so I'll hold onto it and send you word when I have something for you.

==Notes==
[[File:A Pirate Predicament.jpg|thumb|[[Bonenose]] and crew]]

[[Bonenose]] hands over [[The Case of the Superstitious and Hungry Pirates]], which initially reads:
{{book|content=Alyx asked me to check on a group of pirates who landed just outside the celebration area to see if they need any assistance.}}

Before leaving, Bonenose has gossip:
{{dialogue|Ahoy there.

{{gossip|It looks like your boat is intact. Why don't you just sail back to Booty Bay yourselves?}}

{{dialogue-child|We're pretty good at this whole privateering thing, but it seems they put all us superstitious lots all on the same crew.

Cooktholomew has been making that lucky feast for us before each voyage for ages now, and we done always seen fairer luck than most.

{{gossip|Except this last one. Didn't you say you lost him at sea?}}

Aye, we did. And that was the one time we were sent out so quickly we didn't have time for our feast. 

So you can see my predicament. We don't have the stomachs to become landlubbers, but there's no way we're getting back on that boat without first having that lucky feast.

{{gossip|Okay, I'll see what I can do.}}}}

{{gossip|Where in Booty Bay can I find  Cooktholomew's stuff?}}

{{dialogue-child|Can't rightly say that I know. But I think all the cooking folk over there bunk together, so it shouldn't be too difficult.}}

{{gossip|Why do you call him Cooktholomew? That can't be his real name, can it?}}

{{dialogue-child|It ain't his birth name, you're right about that. His dear ma called 'im Rufinwag.

{{gossip|Sounds like a strong name. How did he come to be called Cooktholomew?}}

Oh, y'know how snarky friends are. We used to have a human sailing with us. His name was Bartholomew, Bart for short. We all called him Barty and he HATED it. 

Barty was one for letting us know local regulations when we were lookin' to port, and sometimes he would get mighty snooty about letting us know when we were doing things wrong. That's the only time we would use his full name. "Thank you so much for your insight, Bartholemew," we would say. 

Everyone would laugh. Ol' Barty would go red as a ruby!

{{gossip|I can't imagine why.}}

Well, one night, many seasons ago, our whole bunch were nose deep in rum and cakes. Ol' Cookthol--er... Rufinwag started nitpicking how we were eating the cakes. 

Apparently, they were special and there was some traditional way to eat the blasted things. 

We all laughed at first, but his constant hounding was a real pain.

Until someone, somewhere in the shadows of the room, called out, "Thank you so much for your insight, Cooktholomew," and everyone doubled over with laughter. Even good ol' Rufinwag, bless his soul.  

The name stuck like barnacles, and from that day forward...

{{gossip|Cooktholomew.}}

Aye, Cooktholomew indeed.}}}}

After exhausting all of Bonenose's gossip options, the journal adds:
{{book|content=I spoke with Bonenose, the Booty Bay Boatswain. They are apparently stuck here, not because of any mechanical failings of their ship, but rather because they fear setting sail again without the good luck proffered by a special meal their old cook, named Cooktholomew, used to make.

According to Bonenose, "Cooktholomew" is a nickname. The cook's real name was Rufinwag.

Bonenose doesn't know where Cooktholomew bunked, exactly, but he did suggest all the cooking folks at Booty Bay bunk together. That narrows down who I should ask.}}

Check in with [[Maru]], who only has one piece of advice today:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|{{text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain your primary case to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

Cooktholomew was a cook, right? Maybe one of da cooks in Booty Bay knows about him!}}

Head over to [[Booty Bay]] at the southern tip of [[Cape of Stranglethorn]]. Alliance players should fly south out of [[Stormwind City]]. Horde players can connect via the ship from [[Ratchet]] or the zeppelin from [[Orgrimmar]] to [[Grom'gol Base Camp]]. High placers in the [[Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza]] can use their [[Boots of the Bay]].

Note that this quest does ''not'' phase Booty Bay for pirates who are friendly with the [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]] and hostile with Booty Bay or the rest of the [[Steamwheedle Cartel]].

[[Booty Bay Bruiser]]s can be spoken with:
{{Dialogue|
Keep it moving, pal.

{{Gossip|I'm trying to find where Cooktholomew used to bunk. Can you help?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I haven't the foggiest. The Old Port Authority is where you can find cooks. I'd mark it on your map but, well, that ain't my job.
}}}}

As always, check in with the innkeeper in town, [[Innkeeper Skindle]] at {{co|40.9|73.8|Cape of Stranglethorn}} in the [[Salty Sailor Tavern]]:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|I'm trying to find where Cooktholomew used to bunk. Can you help?}}

Cooktholomew? No, sorry, I don't know where he bunked. 

Oh! But you know who might? [[Kelsey Yance]], over in the [[Old Port Authority|old port authority]]. Those two were good friends, from what I gather.}}

Before speaking with Kelsey, [[Scowling Rosa]] does have gossip lines, but will refuse to help for now:

{{dialogue|{{gossip|I'm trying to find where Cooktholomew used to bunk. Can you help?}}

Cooktholomew I knew. You, I do not. Sorry, hun, but why don't you check with the ol' port authority instead. I'm sure someone there should be able to help ya out.}}

The [[Old Port Authority]] is across the bay to the northeast, and Kelsey Yance, the cook, is at {{co|42.8|69.0|Cape of Stranglethorn}} in the northern end of the building.

{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|I'm trying to find where Cooktholomew used to bunk. Can you help?}}

Yeah, all us cooking folk bunk together. [[Mrs. Gant|Mrs. Gnat]]{{sic}} kind of took us all under her wing to make sure we stay outta trouble.}}

Journal entry:
{{book|content=I found a possible associate of Cookthololmew's, Kelsey Yance, in the Old Port Authority. He tells me all the culinary people bunk together under the watch of one Mrs. Gant.}}

[[Mrs. Gant]] is located at {{co|42.7|72.7|Cape of Stranglethorn}} in the bottom-most building. <code>/tar Mrs</code> to find her more easily.

{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|I'm trying to find where Cooktholomew used to bunk. Can you help?}}

Sure can!

<Mrs. Gant gestures to the lower hammock to her left.>

That was his area right there. I'm pretty sure that barrel is all that's left of his.}}

Journal entry:
{{book|content=I spoke with Mrs. Gant, the cooking trainer. She pointed out Cooktholomew's area for me. According to her, the barrel next to his old hammock is the only thing left of his.}}

The [[Property of Cooktholomew]] barrel lights up in a corner. Interact with it at {{co|42.9|72.8|Cape of Stranglethorn}} to pick up the [[Boonful Banquet]].

Journal entry:
{{book|content=I found Cooktholomew's notes, but he clearly wrote them only for himself. I need to find someone to help decipher this.}}

The book reads:
{{:Boonful Banquet}}

Check in with Mrs. Gant again:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|I think I found Cooktholomew's notes. Can you make sense of them?}}

<Mrs. Gant looks at you quizzically.>

Those notes look like gibberish to me, I'm sorry. 

But I also didn't know Cooktholomew all that well. Maybe a friend of his would be better at figuring this out?}}

Also check in with Yance:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|I think I found Cooktholomew's notes. Can you make sense of them?}}

<Kelsey flips through the notes.>

Hmmm. No, this doesn't look at all familiar at all. Cooktholomew was a strange one, that's for sure. 

You know who might be able to help you out? [[Scowling Rosa]]. The two of them used to talk about books and words and languages all the time. It was kind of their thing. If anyone around here could help, I bet it would be her.

{{gossip|Thanks for the tip.}}}}

[[Scowling Rosa]] patrols the main dock all around Booty Bay. Use <code>/tar Scowl</code> to help find her:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|I think I found Cooktholomew's notes. Can you make sense of them?}}

Lemme see that...}}

This completes the quest.
