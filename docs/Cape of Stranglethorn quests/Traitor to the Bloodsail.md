==Objectives==
That mangy dog, [[Revilgaz]], has offered to pardon any former Bloodsails willing to turn on their cap'n! That bilge sucker asked me to go an' off me ole' mates and to bring back their bandannas as proof.

I don't have it in me heart to do that, nor will I ask ye to. Bring me some silk cloth and red dye and I'll make suitable replicas. I'll tell the Baron you went turncoat, but be warned... the Bloodsails are not gonna like it! 
*[[Silk Cloth]] (40)
*[[Red Dye]] (4)

==Completion==
Let us observe a minute of silence for our fallen mates, <name>.

<The Bloodsail Traitor grins at you and winks.>

Being a traitor is one thing, murdering yer own buckos... that'd be just downright despicable, aye!

*+500 reputation with [[Booty Bay]]
*+250 reputation with [[Everlook]]
