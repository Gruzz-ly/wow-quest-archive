==Objectives==
Collect 3 Crocolisk Skins in [[Janeiro's Point]], or give gold to [[Blixrez Goodstitch]].
*Get information from Blixrez Goodstitch
*[[Crocolisk Skin]] (3) (Optional)

==Description==
Information ain't cheap. Outta everyone, Zeros should know that best.

People have sighted dangerous [[crocolisk]]s around Janeiro's Point. You know what I see? [[Money]], money, money! Get me their precious skins and maybe I'll remember something important about those crystals [[Zeros]] is after.

If that's too dangerous for your cup of tea, I might be open to other forms of payment too. You know, the most common form.

<Blixrez folds his arms and waits expectantly.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Friendship is like a scale. It must remain balanced at all costs!

==Completion==
Mmhm, this will do!

==Notes==
There are two options to complete this quest - either go to Janeiro's Point and kill [[Sandy Crocolisk]]s to loot three [[Crocolisk Skin]] or pay Blixrez 2,000 or 3,000 gold.
