'''Cutting Edge Poultry Science''' is started inside [[Drustvar]]'s [[Waycrest Manor]] while the rare world quest [[Waycrest Manor: Witchy Kitchen]] is up.

==Objectives==
Take the [[Delicious Chicken]] to [[Oglethorpe Obnoticus|Dr. Oglethorpe]] in [[Booty Bay]].

==Description==
<Before you is a delicious [[chicken]]... And yet, despite everything, there is something a little bit... lively about this creature.

With a judicious application of science, there might be something that can still be done for this poor bird.

You resolve to bring the chicken to Dr. Oglethorpe in Booty Bay with all haste.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Intact Chicken Brain]]
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Hmm, a difficult case but I believe I can help!

These days so many people concerned if science should do something rather than if science can do it! Now let's see... Some wire, a few gears, a bit of feath-growth potion and some good old rocket fuel for some kick... And presto! One robotic chicken back from the brink!

Er, if it goes insane and tries to kill everyone, you were never here and we never had this conversation.

==Notes==
Head to the [[Banquet Hall (Waycrest Manor)|Banquet Hall]] ([[Raal the Gluttonous]]'s room) in the northeast. Of the three named targets, only kill [[Executive Chef Daniel]] and leave [[Roast Chef Rhonda]] and [[Sauciere Samuel]] alive.

Let Rhonda cast Raw Chicken, which spawns one on the ground. Then let Rhonda cast Roasting Fire while facing the chicken, turning it into a Cooked Chicken. Then, let Samuel cast Gravy Spray on the Cooked Chicken, turning it into a Delicious Chicken. Interact with the Delicious Chicken to pick up this quest, then finish off the mini-bosses.
