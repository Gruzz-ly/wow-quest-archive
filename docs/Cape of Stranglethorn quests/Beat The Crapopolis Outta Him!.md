Complete the Crapopolis scenario.
* [[Crapopolis]] saved

==Description==
Boy am I glad to see you! We've got a bad situation on our hands...

While you were away delivering the invitations, [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] and his goons took over Crapopolis! They're holding [[Hobart Grapplehammer]] hostage until he hands over the [[X-52 Personnel Armor]]!

You have to stop Gallywix before it's too late!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The X-52 Personnel Armor is ruined beyond repair... but at least Crapopolis is saved and Gallywix finally got what he deserves!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Sassy Hardwrench|Word out of Crapopolis is that Gallywix and his goons have taken over the town! You'd better hurry!}}

Take the [[Goblin Flying Machine]] back to Crapopolis.

===Stage 1: Crapopolis===
:Speak with Gazlowe at the dock.
*Speak with Gazlowe at the dock.

Gazlowe is accompanied by [[Pozzik]] and [[Marin Noggenfogger]].

;Speaking with Gazlowe
:Gallywix's goons are all over the place! Looks like this little town's in big trouble...

:{{Gossip|What's the situation here?}}
:{{Text|say|Gazlowe|Gallywix has lost it! He's holding Grapplehammer hostage. That ain't good for business!}}
:{{Text|say|Gazlowe|We've got things under control out here. You'd better put a stop to this nonsense.}}

===Stage 2: Held Hostage===
:Rescue Hobart Grapplehammer.
*Rescue Hobart Grapplehammer.

The area is taken over by [[Hotwired Peacekeeper]]s, [[Hired Scoundrel]]s, [[Street Thug]]s. Enter the town:
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Attention citizens of Crapopolis! As your landlord and employer, I'm assuming direct control of this town's operations.}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|And don't get any smart ideas about taking it back. I'd hate to have to... cut my losses.}}

Head toward Hobart's workshop.
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Listen up, everyone! First goblin to liquidate this intruder gets a hefty bonus AND a promotion!}}

Inside the workshop, Hobart is cornered by [[Dax Blitzblaster]] and a Street Thug.
:{{Text|say|Dax Blitzblaster|Hand over the suit or else!}}
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Do your worst! I'm through working for Gallywix!}}

Attack Dax:
:{{Text|say|Dax Blitzblaster|Oho! Big mistake, pal!}}

;Aiming Shot
:{{Text|bossemote|Dax Blitzblaster is aiming his rifle at you, take cover!}}

And kill him:
:{{Text|say|Dax Blitzblaster|But... my bonus...}}

===Stage 3: Suiting Up!===
:Equip the X-52 Body Armor.
*Equip the X-52 Body Armor.
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Ah, my invaluable assistant! The X-52 is contained in that chest. Put it on, quickly!}}

Open the [[Grapplehammer's Chest]].

:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|I've added a turbo function to the X-52. Activating it will vastly increase the armor's power, but will also overload its core.}}
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|That being said, do not hesitate to utilize it against Gallywix! It may prove necessary.}}

===Final Stage: Taking Back The Town===
:Defeat Gallywix.
*Defeat Gallywix.

Head to the mine field to find Gallywix in a shredder Powered by Azeroth(R). Attack him. The X-52 Personnel Armor extra action button also becomes available.

:{{Text|yell|Trade Prince Gallywix|Nobody messes with me! Nobody!}}

Defeat him three times to deplete his Azerite.

:{{Text|bossemote|Gallywix's mech is completely depleted, finish him off with the X-52 Personnel Armor!}}

Use the new extra action button, Overload.

:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Now, assistant! Activate the turbo!}}

The mech becomes Deactivated. Hobart, Pozzik, Marin, and Gazlowe arrive.
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|You've done it now, mook! As soon as I get outta this thing, you're dead!}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|What the--hey! Hey! Someone open up this piece of junk!}}
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|But of course, Gallywix. Just as soon as we renegotiate our contract.}}

{{Rfptr-section}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Argh! What's wrong with my mech?! Somebody get in here and fix this thing!}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|That armor's mine, you small time scrub!}}
