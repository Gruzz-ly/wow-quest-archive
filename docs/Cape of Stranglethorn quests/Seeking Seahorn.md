==Objectives==
Report to [[Fleet Master Seahorn]] in [[Booty Bay]].

==Description==
When the Brashtide pulled in, Seahorn grabbed the nearest weapon he could find and jumped off the ledge here. You'll find him down below, probably pounding new holes into those worgen's skulls.

Help him out down there. I can handle the motivation from up here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3|50}}
*330 [[XP]]
*10 reputation with [[Booty Bay]]

==Completion==
I should have known these Brashtide were alive and up to no good.  I'd written them off years ago.

==Progression==
{{The Bloodsail Buccaneers}}
