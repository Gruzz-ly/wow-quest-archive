The objective of the quests that these three different people offer only differ in where they start, namely [[Western Plaguelands]], [[Cape of Stranglethorn]], and [[Hinterlands]].

==Objectives==
Report to Koltira Deathweaver within Andorhal in Western Plaguelands.

==Description==
Hurry, <name>... there isn't time to waste.

The city of Andorhal is in the middle of a three-way war between the Forsaken, the Alliance, and the Scourge. Lady Sylvanas has sent one of her best death knights to lead the charge for her cause, but I'm sure he can use all the help he can get. With Arthas dead, now is the perfect time for the Forsaken to take Andorhal.

Speak with me again when you are ready, and I will put you on the first flight out there. 

==Completion==
It's about time you arrived, <class>.
