==Objectives==
Deliver the invitations to Grapplehammer's private auction.
* [[Marin Noggenfogger|Noggenfogger]] invited
* [[Pozzik]] invited
* [[Gazlowe]] invited

==Description==
While you've been assisting [[Hobart Grapplehammer|Grapplehammer]] with his newest invention, I've been hard at work finding potential buyers!

This is going to be a private auction, so we're only inviting the best and the brightest, the cream of the crop, the creme de la creme... got it?

I've narrowed the potential buyers down to an 'A' list of only the wealthiest, classiest, most connected [[goblin]]s around... minus [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]], of course!

Head out and deliver these invitations while I finish up preparations for the auction!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This will be an 'A' list event. Only Kezan's finest will be in attendance!

==Completion==
You delivered the invitations? Good! We're going to need all the help we can get... I've got some bad news for you!

Did I say bad news? I meant REALLY bad news!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Sassy Hardwrench|You round up the buyers and I'll set up the auction! We're gonna be rich!}}

Find the three goblins in their usual locations:
*Marin Noggenfogger is in [[Gadgetzan]] in [[Tanaris]]
*Pozzik is in [[Fizzle & Pozzik's Speedbarge]] in [[Thousand Needles]]
*Gazlowe is in [[Ratchet]] in the [[Northern Barrens]]

The quickest way is to teleport to [[Orgrimmar]], take the portal to the [[Caverns of Time]], fly to Gadgetzan, then to the Speedbarge, and finally to Ratchet.
