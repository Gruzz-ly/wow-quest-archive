'''Too Big For His Britches''' is a quest in the [[Cape of Stranglethorn]].

==Objectives==
Obtain a vial of Ironjaw Humour from the [[Ironjaw Behemoth]] in the [[Crystalvein Mine]].
*[[Ironjaw Humour]]

==Description==
Whatever it is you want to do: I've got a recipe that'll do exactly that. You want an exploding potion? BOOM!! You want a lightning potion? ZAP!! You want a shrinking potion? Smeerp.

So Bronwyn says he wants a carbon-dating potion? Easy. I could make that in my sleep. The thing is... if we want it to be accurate, I need you to get some quality ingredients.

Start with some humour from a basilisk to the north. It'll need to be a pretty big basilisk... 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||25|}}.
*2,450 [[XP]]
*250 reputation with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
You got the task?  I got the flask.  

==Completion==
Alright!  Step one - getting ingredients - is all done.  Time for the next step: getting more ingredients. 

==Notes==
On completion:
