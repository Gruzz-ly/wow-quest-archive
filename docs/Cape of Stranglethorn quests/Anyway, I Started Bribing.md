==Objectives==
Use the gold to bribe Arty's Hired Bodyguards and then confront Prospector Arty in [[Wild Shore]].
*[[Hired Bodyguard (Crystal Shore)|Hired Bodyguards]] bribed (6)
*[[Prospector Arty]] confronted
*[[Pouch of Gold Coins]] (provided)

==Description==
The scoundrel! I had a deal with Arty to market the crystals in the paper. Someone must've cut a bigger deal with him.

Arty routinely inspects the [[Venture Company]]'s working area on the shore. He always brings his own guards, but no one is immune to [[Money|gold]] in [[Booty Bay]].

Take my last bit of gold. Go to the [[oil rig]]s and bribe the guards to look the other way before you confront Arty.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
That's all the gold I got, so if you need to throw in some punches to sweeten the deal, be my guest.

==Completion==
[[Pirate]]s?! Of course. We know where to go next.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Zeros|Thanks, [[Blixrez Goodstitch|Blixrez]]. Come on, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Zeros|I'll be hiding up in the cliffs overlooking the bay. Please, hurry.}}

Head to the [[Crystal Shore]]. There are [[Venture Co. Surveyor (Cape of Stranglethorn)|Venture Co. Surveyors]] and [[Venture Co. Laborer (Cape of Stranglethorn)|Venture Co. Laborers]] guarded by Hired Bodyguards that need to be bribed with the pouch. Some are bribed successfully:
*{{Text|say|Hired Bodyguard|Is this a bribe? Consider me bribed.}}
*{{Text|say|Hired Bodyguard|Sure, sure. Place is all yours.}}
*{{Text|say|Hired Bodyguard|This is triple what Arty paid me. You're the boss now!}}

Others attack instead:
*{{Text|yell|Hired Bodyguard|I'll take your gold, but I'm not giving up my contract!}}
*{{Text|yell|Hired Bodyguard|Thanks. Time to turn you in now.}}
*{{Text|yell|Hired Bodyguard|You think that's enough to pay ME off?}}

Once 6 goblins have been bribed, speak with Arty:
:{{Gossip|<Demand information about Zeros' crystals.>}}
::What? How dare you? Guards! GUARDS!

::<Arty huffs and looks around the emptier-than-usual area around him.>

::Oh... I understand. Look, don't hurt me. No amount of gold is worth losing teeth over.

::New [[pirate]]s in town paid me to devalue the crystals in the [[Booty Bay Journal]]. Their [[Captain (rank)|captain]] didn't seem to fancy Zeros making all this profit.

::Captain's name? [[Captain Grub Redcut|Grub Redcut]]. Now... I do believe their ship is still hanging around in the southern coast.

::Go on. I have important work to finish! You really don't want to irk the [[Venture Company]].

Objective is now complete. In case you speak with Arty again:
:Back again? For what?

:I don't have anything more to tell you. Now, please, shoo! I must finish my report.

Return to Zeros on hills overlooking Booty Bay.
