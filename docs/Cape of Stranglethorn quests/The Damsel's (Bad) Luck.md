For '''The Damsel's (Bad) Luck''', you simply have to kill 8 Bloodsail Corsairs in [[Booty Bay]].

==Objectives==
[[Fleet Master Seahorn]] in [[Booty Bay]] wants you to kill 8 Bloodsail Corsairs
* [[Bloodsail Corsair]] slain (8)

== Description ==
I heard that this ship here is the Damsel's Luck. Didn't you used to be the captain of that thing? You must know your way around it, then.

The Brashtide are our main concern, but we still don't want to take an unnecessary pummeling from those cannons of theirs. Grab this rope behind me and take out some of those angry-looking corsairs. Check in with the Baron when you're done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35|}}
*3300 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]

== Completion ==
Attacking your former crewmen...

You really have grown into a real pirate, <name>!

==Progression==
{{Bloodsail and Brashtide chain}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
