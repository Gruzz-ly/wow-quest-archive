==Description==
<Linzi looks troubled.>

You know, there's a troll hiding behind that pile of boxes. She must be awfully sad, if she doesn't want to come out and talk to anyone.

<Linzi places some of the Akiris reeds in a kerchief and ties it together.>

Here, give these to her. They're very soft, and that maybe they will make her feel a little more comfortable back there.

Care to explain yourself, <class>? 

==Completion==
<The troll looks into the package.>

You have my thanks.  You may tell your young dwarven friend that I am not sad.  I am waiting.  For you.
