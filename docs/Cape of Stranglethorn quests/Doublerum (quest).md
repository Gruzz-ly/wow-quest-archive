==Objectives==
Find Baron Revilgaz's Barrel of [[Doublerum (quest item)]] within [[Booty Bay]]. 

==Description==
<Baron Revilgaz sighs.> Even with all my suspicions about Firallon's plot, we aren't prepared for a full two-front attack between the Bloodsail and the Brashtide. It's going to take a small miracle to hold Booty Bay today.

I've got a barrel of Doublerum in my chambers. Take the stairs down three flights, and check the first door on your right. You can ignore the warnings on the barrel... those should be the least of your worries.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost||3|50}}|Doublerum}}

*330 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]

==Completion==
This must be the doublerum.  You pour a glass for Revilgaz, then consider pouring one for yourself...

==Progression==
{{The Bloodsail Buccaneers}}
