This quest completes the quests about {{questchain|Oglethorpe's Homing Robots}}.

== Completion ==
You've recovered three of my OOX homing robots!  You've gone above and beyond what you needed to, so I will give you something special for all your help.  It is a miniature version of the very same robot that you have come to know and love, the OOX!

I normally wouldn't let anyone have such a potentially lethal device, but you've been a real help.  Besides - the combat mechanisms and the homing logic on this one have been disabled.

Other than that, it's an OOX by golly!

== Rewards ==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*10,200 [[XP]]
*-500 [[reputation]] with [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]]
*500 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]
* [[Mechanical Chicken]]

==Notes==
*This quest helps complete the achievement [[Northern Stranglethorn Quests]] instead of the [[Cape of Stranglethorn Quests]].
