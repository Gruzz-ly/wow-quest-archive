==Objectives==
Practice using the cannon by hitting Smilin' Timmy Sticks 5 times with cannonballs from [[Ol' Blasty (cannon)|Ol' Blasty]].
*Hit [[Smilin' Timmy Sticks]] with a cannonball

==Description==
We've got some work to do. How much experience have you got with cannons? Hmm... really? Well, how about with ancient, fallin'-apart pirate cannons?

We've got a few cannons updecks that work the old-fashioned way: you load one cannonball in at a time, aim, lock it into place, and fire. Works well if you're tryin' to hit the side of a three-sailer... not so well for rowboats and the like.

Why don't you head upstairs and lob a few shots at Smilin' Timmy Sticks?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35|}}
*3,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You look a little green, <name>.  You feelin' alright?

==Completion==
I like the cut of your gib, <name>.

==Progression==
{{The Bloodsail Buccaneers}}
