==Objectives==
Obtain Narkk's Handbombs from the [[Old Port Authority]] inside [[Booty Bay]].  
*[[Narkk's Handbombs]] 

==Description==
I've got an idea, but it's going to involve some footwork on your part. As a [[goblin]] [[cartel]], the [[Blackwater Raiders]] have a lot of explosives on hand. In fact, I know for a fact that our old friend [[Narkk]] keeps a case in the back of his shop, in the Old Port Authority.

Go grab them and bring them here, if they haven't already exploded.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35|}}
*3,300 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]

==Progress==
You're still alive?

==Completion==
You brought them!  I'm beginning to think the tide is turning in our favor, <name>.

==Progression==
{{The Bloodsail Buccaneers}}
