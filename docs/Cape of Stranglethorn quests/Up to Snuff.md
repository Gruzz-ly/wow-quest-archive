==Objectives==
Deeg in [[Booty Bay]] wants you to bring him 15 tiny heaps of Snuff.
*[[Snuff]] (15)

==Description==
Ah, the sea life. I ain't gonna say it's the good life, but it's my life.

When I get into port I like to find me a good bottle of grog and some high quality snuff. Nasty habits but what's a pirate without his vices, right?

So you can imagine how heartbroken I was to find out the herbalist here in town has gone and sold out of the stuff. Says his shipment got hijacked by those damned Bloodsail Raiders.

I bet a fearless <class> like you could convince 'em to share the goods, eh?

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*2,900 [[XP]]
*-250 [[reputation]] with [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]]
*+250 reputation with [[Booty Bay]]

==Progress==
Any luck finding the goods, matey?

==Completion==
Good show, <name>!  And just before I need to ship out too!  Can't thank you enough, old friend.

==Progression==
