==Objectives==
Obtain Maury's Clubbed Foot, Fitztittle's Ratcheting Torque Wrench, and Ephram's Jeweled Mirror.  
*[[Maury's Clubbed Foot]] 
*[[Fitztittle's Ratcheting Torque Wrench]] 
*[[Ephram's Jeweled Mirror]]

==Description==
There's three phases to debt collecting: asking nicely, asking forcefully, and something I like to call "Phase Three".

Unfortunately, collecting during Phase Three is something that this old dog can't do any more. That's why I employ so many cronies, stooges, mooks, goons, and noble adventurers like yourself!

Juntz Fitztittle, Ephram Moonfall, and Maury Wilkins are hiding out on the eastern coast. You should have no problem visiting them all in one trip... and bringing back their valuables.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Nice Shorts
|Phase Three Bracers
|Forceful Shield
|Phase Three Leggings
|Nice Cuffs
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]
* -250 reputation with [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]]

==Progress==
<Name>, did you find those debtors?

==Completion==
Great!  I can get a good price for these, especially for what's inside Maury's foot!  Thanks much, <name>!

I hope those three learned their lesson: don't bet something you can't afford to lose.

And maybe it's too late for them, but...they should be careful of who they gamble with.
