==Objectives==
Ride the ship from [[Booty Bay]] to [[Ratchet]], then speak with [[Gazlowe]].

==Description==
I've been sent by the good people of [[Theramore]] to find loyal members of the [[Alliance]] who are willing to help [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lady Jaina]] with some problems in [[Dustwallow Marsh|Dustwallow]].

You weren't really here working for the [[goblin]]s, were you?

The path back to Dustwallow will take you through Ratchet. Wait on the end of this pier for the next boat. Once you get to Ratchet, speak with Gazlowe. He'll point you in the right direction from there.

Ugh, I think I stepped on a [[Steve (fish)|fish]]! And it flopped!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||27|75}}
*260 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Yeah?  Whaddya need?
