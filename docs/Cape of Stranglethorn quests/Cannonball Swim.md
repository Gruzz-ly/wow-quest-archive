==Objectives==
Obtain 6 Bloodsail Cannonballs from the water beneath the Riptide.
*[[Bloodsail Cannonball]] (6)

==Description==
Help out a fellow swabbie?

Keelhaul asked me to gather up some cannonballs at the bottom of the ocean. Let me tell you why this doesn't work for me.

- One: I have tiny arms. Look at them! Do you really think I can pick up a cannonball, even underwater?

- Two: I have a weak respiratory system. I start to white out after holding my breath for more than ten seconds.

- Three: There are sharks.

You gotta help me, <name>! I've been demoted as far as I can... I don't want to see what comes next!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35|}}
*2,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I wasn't always a swabbie, you know.

==Completion==
Thanks, <name>.  I'd been hearing whispers about "Pretty Boy" and a "boo-box".  I don't think I want to go in the boo-box.
