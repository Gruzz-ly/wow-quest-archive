==Objectives==
Destroy [[High Priestess Jeklik]]'s body before [[Zanzil]] can resurrect her.

If you become lost or need to return to Zul'Gurub, speak with [[Chabal]] at [[Hardwrench Hideaway]].
*Destroy High Priestess Jeklik's body 
*[[Chabal's Fetish]] (provided)

==Description==
Ahead of you looms a ramp up to one of the city's many terraces. The bat-shaped totems ahead of you indicate that this is the domain of High Priestess Jeklik, a follower of Hir'eek.

Jeklik was one of the Hakkar-worshipping priests that Zanzil was planning to resurrect. Perhaps if you hurry, you can stop the resurrection! 

==Rewards==
*You will receive:
*{{cost||65|}}
*4,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
:{{text|yell|Zanzil the Outcast yells: What're you doin' here? Don' matter, I'm gonna resurrect Jeklik before you get a chance to interfere!}}
:{{text|yell|Zanzil the Outcast yells: Uh oh... Jin'do's not gonna be happy about this...}}
:{{text|yell|Zanzil the Outcast yells: Time to get out of here!}}

==Completion==
You have succeeded in preventing Zanzil from resurrecting High Priestess Jeklik. Without one of his priest, Jin'do will certainly have a difficult time summoning Hakkar.

==Progression==
{{Zanzil the Outcast chain}}
