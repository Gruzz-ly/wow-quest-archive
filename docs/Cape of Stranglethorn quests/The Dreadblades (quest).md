==Objectives==
Capture the [[Horizon's Edge]] and obtain [[the Dreadblades]]. 
* Set sail
* Dreadblades obtained
* [[Bloodsail Gryphon|Fly]] to [[Dalaran]]

==Description==
I can promise ya a safe journey to [[Eliza]]'s position, but once we're there... well, we both know there be no guarantees.

The plan is simple. We'll take the [[Crimson Veil]] as close as we can get her without being seen and disembark from there.

Once we're ashore, we'll board the [[Horizon's Edge]], bribe her mutinous crew to hand it over, and hunt down Eliza and her legendary blades wherever she may be.

Just say the word when yer ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}}

==Completion==
You did fine work today, <lad/lass>.
