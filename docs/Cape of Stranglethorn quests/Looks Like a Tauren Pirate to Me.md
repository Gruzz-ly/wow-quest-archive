==Objectives==
Obtain a Cow Head and an Oversized Pirate Hat, then bring them back to [[Fleet Master Seahorn]].
*Return both items to [[Fleet Master Seahorn]]
*[[Cow Head]]
*[[Oversized Pirate Hat]]

==Description==
[[Fleet Master Firallon|Firallon]] wants MY head? Now that's interesting. But it's nothing we can't work around.

This [[Yancey Grillsen|Yancey]] character probably doesn't know my face too well. Most non-[[tauren]] find us tauren indistinguishable from one another. In fact... most non-tauren find us indistinguishable from... a certain four-legged farm creature.

[[Rikqiz]] the leatherworker keeps one of these creatures here in [[Booty Bay]], and [[Narkk]] is my chief supplier for pirate hats. Get a replacement head and a hat, then return with both.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*[[Head of Fleet Master Seahorn]]

==Progress==
You should know that most tauren would find this shameful.  I find it... amusing.

==Completion==
That should fool that [[Bloodsail Buccaneers|Bloodsail]] dimwit.

This was fun, <name>.

==Progression==
{{The Bloodsail Buccaneers}}
