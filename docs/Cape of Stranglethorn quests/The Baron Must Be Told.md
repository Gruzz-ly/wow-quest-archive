==Objectives==
Report the planned Bloodsail attack to [[Baron Revilgaz]].

==Description==
Shiver me timbers! So the Bloodsail Buccaneers are planning some sort of attack on Booty Bay? Why, the nerve of those scoundrels. Booty Bay will always be run by the Blackwater Raiders!

This is bigger than I thought. Report what you have learned to Baron Revilgaz at once! You'll find him here in Booty Bay.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||8}}
*670 [[XP]]
*25 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]
*-25 reputation with [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]]

==Completion==
[[Bloodsail Buccaneers]] attacking Booty Bay?  This isn't the first time that those blaggards have tried something.  Booty Bay is impenetrable!

Sounds like they might be changing their strategies up, though.  Wouldn't put it past Firallon to try something crazy.  Very well, let's see what else they're up to.
