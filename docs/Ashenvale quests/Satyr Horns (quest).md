Kill any [[Satyr]] in [[Ashenvale]] to collect the horns.

==Objectives==
Collect 16 Satyr Horns for [[Pixel]] in [[Splintertree Post]].
*[[Satyr Horns]] (16)

==Description==
Heya! I've been traveling through [[Ashenvale]], heading towards [[Ratchet]], and decided to make a stop here at Splintertree. I'm always looking for an opportunity, and it seems that satyr horns are in high demand in Ratchet these days.

After asking around here, it seems that the satyrs in Night Run, [[Satyrnaar]], and [[Xavian]] all have the type of horns I am looking for. I'm no match for those [[satyr]]s... but you look like you might be!

Tell you what, you collect the horns for me and I'll make it worth your time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||10|15}}
*1,000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ratchet]]

==Progress==
I hope you can be quick about getting those horns, <name>. I'm heading back to Ratchet soon!

==Completion==
These are perfect, <name>! Thanks for helping me out!

Oh, and this is for your time...
