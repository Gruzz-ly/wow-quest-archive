==Objectives==
Take the Troll Charm to [[Hephaestus Pilgrim]] at [[Astranaar]] in [[Ashenvale]].
*[[Troll Charm]] (provided)

==Description==
The man standing right across from me is known as Hephaestus Pilgrim. He's one of the [[worgen]].

He and his [[Sabina Pilgrim|sister]] came to Astranaar not long ago looking for a place to live. From what little I've been able to glean, he's interested in trying to help the [[Earthen Ring]] with the [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]]. His sister is even more powerful. She's gone east to try and help the [[shaman]] deal with the [[Thunder Peak|volcano]].

Perhaps he can help. Take the charm over to him and see what he thinks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*185 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Progress==
<The worgen gives you a blank look as you walk up to him.>

==Completion==
<Looking down at the wooden carving in your extended hand, the worgen reaches out to take it.>

==Progression==
{{Culling the Furbolg Threat}}
