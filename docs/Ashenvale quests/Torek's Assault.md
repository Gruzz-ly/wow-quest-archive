==Description==
Hey! <class>! Come here!

My raiders and I are about to attack the [[Silverwing Outpost]] to the west. Our target is its leader, [[Duriel Moonfire]]. Scouts report the outpost is defended heavily with sentinels and warriors. The battle will be glorious!

Do you want to share in the glory, <name>, and aid us? If so, then when it's over you can report our success to my superior, [[Ertog Ragetusk]] in [[Splintertree]].

What do you say. Are you with us?

You will also receive:
* {{cost||10|15}}
* 1,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Torek was sent on a mission against Silverwing Outpost. Was the attack successful?

==Completion==
[[File:Torek's Assault TCG.jpg|thumb|In the ''[[World of Warcraft: Trading Card Game]]''.]]
So [[Torek]]'s attack was successful! Well done, <name>. Night elves are decent foes. A little skinny, but strong and fierce! I'm sure the battle was something to see...

And I hope you gained a scar or two!
