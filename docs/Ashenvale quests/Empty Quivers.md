==Objectives==
[[Truun]] at [[Mor'shan Rampart]]s wants you to collect 10 Serviceable Arrows from the [[Fallen Sky Lake]] region.
*[[Serviceable Arrow]] (10)

==Description==
Greetings, <class>, and welcome to the Ramparts.

Things may appear a little chaotic here but do not worry. [[Kadrak]] has this juncture sealed up tight. Not a single elf has breached our lines!

While you're here... I'm expecting a shipment of fresh supplies from [[Orgrimmar]] any day, but our [[Mor'shan Watchman|watchmen]] are running dangerously low on arrows.

Bring me any you find and I will make it worth your trouble. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||10|15}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Have you collected the arrows we need, <class>?

==Completion==
Well done, <class>.

This should help get us by until our shipment arrives.

==Notes==
*In ''Cataclysm'', the quest awarded reputation to the [[Warsong Offensive]], but it was changed to [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]] at some point.

==Progression==
