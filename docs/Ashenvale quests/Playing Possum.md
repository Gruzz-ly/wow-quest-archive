==Objectives==
Obtain the final piece of [[Dartol's Rod]], the Iron Pommel.
*[[Iron Pommel]]
*[[Shael'dryn's Playing Possum Technique]] (provided)

==Description==
The last piece of the rod is held by druids of the claw.  I asked their leader, [[Oso Bramblescar]], to give it to me, but he and his guardians nearly killed me!  Clearly they too were affected by the Horde's corruption of the [[Forest Heart]].

But, I have an idea for how you can get into Oso's cave and grab the pommel.

Ever since I was a faun, I've been pretty good at playing possum.  It works great against bears!  I can teach you!  Go east to the [[Shady Nook]], and if they try to get you, just use my technique.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Shael'dryn's Bracers
|Possumfoot Boots
|Dissembling Bracers
|Possumfoot Treads
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||10|15}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Did you find the final piece of the rod, <name>?  How did my technique work?

==Completion==
You got it?  Wonderful for you... and for Raene!

I guess we'll have to see about reassembling it, won't we?

==Notes==
'''Upon accept'''
: {{text|say|Shael'dryn|Playing possum is super easy, <name>.  Just watch....}}
: {{text|emote|Shael'dryn begins to play possum.}}
: ''She falls over "dead" and remains still for several moments before popping back up.''
: {{text|say|Shael'dryn|See?!  That wasn't hard, was it?  You'll have no problem fooling stinky old [[Oso Bramblescar|Oso Bramblepaw]] and his guardians now.}}

'''Completion'''
: {{text|say|Shael'dryn|The rod's design is simple.  [[Dartol]] didn't use his arcane knowledge in its creation... it is more druidic in nature.}}
: {{text|say|Shael'dryn|Hehe... I made a pun, didn't I?  Druidic in nature... I'm so funny.}}
: {{text|say|Shael'dryn|Now, then... the rod.  Let's see about putting it back together, shall we?}}
: ''Shael'dryn casts a brief spell.''
: {{text|say|Shael'dryn|There!  That wasn't too bad.  What did you say you and Raene were going to do with this thing?  It's powerful!}}

The quest texts refer to Oso and his guardians as [[Druid of the Claw|druids of the claw]], but the guardians are tameable bears in-game.
