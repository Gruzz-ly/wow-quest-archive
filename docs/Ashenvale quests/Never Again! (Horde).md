==Objectives==
Obtain Gorgannon's Flaming Blade and the Seeker's Fel Spear.
* [[Gorgannon's Flaming Blade]]
* [[Seeker's Fel Spear]]

== Description ==
<Name>, you will see to it that this attack by the [[Burning Legion]] never comes to pass! Go and slay these [[dreadlord]]s! Without them the rest of the demons are essentially mindless.

You will find [[Gorgannon]] in [[Demon Fall Canyon]] south beyond [[Felfire Hill]], near [[Mannoroth]]'s floating, broken spear.

[[Diathorus the Seeker]] resides somewhere in the barrow den atop [[Demon Fall Ridge]].

Return to me with their weapons as proof of your deeds.

You will also receive:

* 1,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Progress ==
Those dreadlords must die soon, <name>!

== Completion ==
Never again will the Burning Legion make [[slave]]s of the [[orc]]s, or any other [[race]] of the [[Horde]]!

Bravely fought, <class>!  You have the true heart of the Horde beating inside of you!  You give us much honor!
