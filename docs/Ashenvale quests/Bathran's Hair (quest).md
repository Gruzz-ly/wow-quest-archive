==Objectives==
Collect 8 Bathran's Hair.
*[[Bathran's Hair]] (8)

==Description==
There is a plant that grows in the old ruins of [[Bathran's Haunt]] across the road to the east. The plant is called Bathran's Hair and is known to cure ailments of the spirit.

Now the [[Horde]] are there harvesting the plant for their own evil schemes.

There is a [[Relara Whitemoon|sick child]] in [[Astranaar]], and we believe that her illness is more than just physical. I promised [[Orendil Broadleaf|my master]] that I would help seek a cure, but I am no fighter.

Will you go to Bathran's Haunt and gather the plants?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|1300}} (or {{coppercost|1020}} at max level)
*1650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered the Bathran's Hair, <name>?  The child's health grows weaker by the hour....

==Completion==
Ah, you have the hair! This is a good first step. There are other ingredients that we will need, but the hair of the fallen Ancient could well be the most important.

I only hope that whatever the [[Forsaken]] are devising from the plant will not be turned into a weapon. We simply do not have the numbers to remove them right now, especially with [[Maestra's Post]] under attack!
