==Objectives==
Speak with [[Kulg Gorespatter]] at the [[Ashenvale]]/[[Azshara]] border to be transported to the [[Mor'shan Ramparts]]. Report to [[Kadrak]] when you arrive.

== Description ==
These woods may be silent but our enemies lurk behind every trunk. I've discovered many an [[orc]] with arrows in his back, his weapon still sheathed.

It is treacherous here, behind the lines, but we could use strong arms and sharp minds down at the Mor'shan Ramparts. Kadrak is preparing an offensive from there - he prefers action to talk. You and he will get along.

Speak with me when you are ready and I will fly you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You are just in time, <class>. Old Kulg has been slinking around those woods too long. He grows too cautious, jumping at shadows. We will fear this forest no longer - the time has come to subdue Ashenvale once and for all!
