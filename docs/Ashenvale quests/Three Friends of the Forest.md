==Objectives==
Speak with [[Bolyun]] at [[Bolyun's Camp]] in [[Ashenvale]].

==Description==
Care to make a quick trip to the south? I've three friends that I haven't heard from in a while. With these strange tentacles popping out of the ground to the north, and all of the [[demon]]ic activity, I don't dare leave my family.

Bolyun set up his camp in the southwest corner of the forest, just to the northwest of that damnable [[Fire Scar Shrine]]. [[Alenndaar Lapidaar|Alenndaar]] and [[Harlown Darkweave|Harlown]] joined him, so they should all be okay, but you never know.

Thanks, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2,000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Completion==
<Class>, you must be wary! [[Kaliva]], the foul demoness who has chained us is nearby!

==Patch changes==
