==Objectives==
Kill 8 Veiled Deathstalkers.
* [[Veiled Deathstalker]] slain (8)

==Description==
Do you see the encampment on the beach below?

The [[Horde]] followed [[Tyrande]] here.

No doubt some of them have remained here in the shadows in case she returned.

Kill them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Horde will pay the ultimate price for crossing the kaldorei.

==Completion==
These [[Forsaken]] still fight, even beyond death. What drives their wicked hearts?

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Dori'thur will accompany you. We are not alone out here.}}
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|The rest of you stand guard. We move no further until we search the area.}}

[[Dori'thur]], Tyrande's [[owl scout]], joins you for this quest, and thus also the parallel quest, [[Hope]]. It has this ability:

:{{Abilities|Sentinel|Sends Dori'thur to the target area, revealing nearby enemies and increasing the critical strike chance received by 100%.|id=284720|icon=spell_nature_sentinal}}

==Progression==
{{On Whispered Winds}}
