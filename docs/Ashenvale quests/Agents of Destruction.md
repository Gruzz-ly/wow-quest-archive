==Objectives==
Slay Overseer Gorthak and any other 12 Horde at the [[Warsong Lumber Camp]].
* Horde at the Warsong Lumber Camp slain (12)
* [[Overseer Gorthak]] slain

==Description==
The Warsong Lumber Camp is a blight upon an embattled landscape. Every time we make progress in halting their operations, Overseer Gorthak orders his loggers to redouble their efforts!

Now, the orcs are cutting more wood than they can possibly use, leaving it to rot while their blades bite into fresh trees! This is an affront to all we stand for, <name>, and we will show them that we'll not suffer further destruction of our lands!

Go, and do not rest until Overseer Gorthak and his minions are dead!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Starwhisper Monnions
|Woodguard Vest
|Starwhisper Spaulders
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||10|15}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
At last we have sent a message that the orcs won't dare ignore. Any overseer or foreman who sets foot within the camp to replace Gorthak will feel my wrath!

We must press our advantage, <name>, and never rest until the Warsong Lumber Camp is a distant memory and a glade of trees stands upon that ground.

Now what was this about explosives...?

==Notes==
Killing [[Warsong Logger]]s, [[Warsong Grunt]]s, [[Warsong Shaman]]s and [[Goblin Deforester]]s counts toward the credit.
