==Objectives==
Speak with [[Sabina Pilgrim]] at the southern edge of [[Thunder Peak]]'s lava flow in [[Ashenvale]]. 

==Description==
<The worgen stares at you intently before launching into his request.>

The volcano threatens to engulf all of Ashenvale if we do not act quickly. Let me assure you, this was no natural eruption.

My sister, Sabina, is powerful. She has gone east to the edge of Thunder Peak's lava flow, just north of the road to enlist the aid of the other elements against the fire lord that has caused this destruction.

<Name>, go to her and give her what assistance you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*185 [[XP]]

==Completion==
My brother must have sent you. He wouldn't have done so unless you are capable of doing what must be done.

For all of our sakes I hope that he's right.

The elementals here are now my allies. You must do as they ask if we are to prevent the destruction of the rest of Ashenvale.
