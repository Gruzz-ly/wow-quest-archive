==Objectives==
Obtain Bloodclaw's Collection.
* [[Bloodclaw's Collection]]

==Description==
Yes, I speak your tongue, <race>.

We [[furbolg]] have been through this kind of corruption before.  Not long ago our leader stole the [[Idol of Remulos]].  The [[demon]]-tainted thing ensorcelled the entire [[Thistlefur tribe|tribe]] and our redemption was barely delivered by a [[druid]] known as [[Broll Bearmantle]].

But this time, we did not steal.  The [[Jungle troll|trolls]] of [[Zoram'gar]] gave us the charms as a sign of friendship.  A deadly friendship it would seem.

Our chief, [[Dal Bloodclaw]], is too far gone.  Enter the hold and return with his charms.

("Dal Bloodclaw: Obtain Bloodclaw's Collection.")

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Thistle Ring  
|Zoram'gar Cloak 
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||35|}}
*2,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well?  The future of the Thistlefur rests upon your shoulders, <race>.

==Completion==
What was done had to be done.  As our leader, Dal's sickness from the troll charms was destroying us.

It was better for the health and dignity of the tribe that it was you, outsider.  This way there will be no civil war amongst us and we will easily find new leadership... hopefully one that does not have a tendency to so easily trust outsiders.  Perhaps I am guilty of this as well?

Here, allow me to repay the debt we owe you before we part ways forever.
