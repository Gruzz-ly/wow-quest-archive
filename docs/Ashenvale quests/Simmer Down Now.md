==Objectives==
[[Captain Tarkan]] at [[Silverwind Refuge]] wants you to defeat Tideress and 12 Befouled Water Elementals at [[Mystral Lake]].
* [[Befouled Water Elemental]] slain (12)
* [[Tideress]] slain

== Description ==
You should've seen it, <class>!

The elves thought Silverwind to be impenetrable. With its heavy defenses and their army of water elementals, they were almost right.

Almost.

[[Sarilus Foulborne|One of our mages]] was able to summon a twisted elemental designed to send the others into a chaotic rage.

Ahh, the looks on their faces!

<Tarkan laughs.>

Unfortunately, the mage who summoned it fell in battle. Now I need someone to bring down our creation. 

== Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||18}}
*2,000 [[XP]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Have you defeated Tideress, <race>?

== Completion ==
Well done, <class>.

A fitting end to a textbook assault. 

==Trivia==
*In {{g|cata}}, the quest rewarded reputation to [[Warsong Offensive]].
