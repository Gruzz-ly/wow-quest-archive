==Objectives==
Take the [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]] portal to [[Darnassus]] and meet [[Maiev Shadowsong]] at the [[Zoram Strand]] in [[Ashenvale]].
* Travel to Zoram Strand
*Meet Maiev Shadowsong at the Zoram Strand in Ashenvale.

==Description==
So be it. You are more trustworthy an ally than any army [[Anduin Wrynn|Wrynn]] would have sent.

We will reclaim [[Darkshore]] together, but first we must find [[Tyrande]]. Without her at the front, our forces will crumble against the [[Horde]].

She left for the Zoram Strand with a small force not long ago. If we move now, we may be able to find her before the Horde does.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It seems our wayward priestess has been busy.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Your aid is welcome, <name>. At least we can count on you.}}
:''Maiev turns away from the table and starts walking out.''
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Tyrande's ship was last seen near the Zoram Strand. We will start there.}}
:''[[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris]] and [[Sira Moonwarden|Sira]] follow Maiev.''

;Talking to Maiev as she leaves
Prepare yourself for battle. We will not leave Darkshore without Tyrande.

;After the night elves leave the room:
: (If this doesn't trigger right away, quickly run out of the room and back to the map table.)
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|Anduin... I need a word.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Of course. You know you can always speak your mind.}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|The [[Night elf|night elves]] saved my people from [[Worgen curse|our curse]]. They offered us refuge in [[Darnassus]] after our kingdom fell.}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|I cannot stand idle as they endure the same fate we did. [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilneas]] will fight by their side.}}
:''[[Lorna Crowley]] starts walking away.''
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|I don't mean to defy you. But if I didn't give the order, I think [[Mia Greymane|Mia]] would charge off to battle without me.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I understand, Genn. [[Light]] be with you.}}

Go to the night elven dock in [[Stormwind Harbor]] and enter the portal to Darnassus (which actually leads to Darkshore). You will end up in an updated Darkshore with PvP areas, so be careful. Fly all the way south to Ashenvale. Maiev, Shandris and Sira are aboard ''[[The Moonspray]]'' off the coast of the Zoram Strand, looking at the burnt remnants of another night elven ship.

:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Tyrande's ship. Or at least what's left of it.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|She must have destroyed it so she would not be followed.}}
