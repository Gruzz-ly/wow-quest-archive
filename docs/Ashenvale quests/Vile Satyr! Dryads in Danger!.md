==Objectives==
Find [[Anilia]] in Xavian.

== Description ==
Listen, I don't know who you are, but I need your help. My sisters went to take back the [[:Branch of Cenarius]] from the satyr. They said they'd be back soon, but it's been two whole days!

<Name>, you have to find them! They were looking for the ruins of a night elf temple in Xavian to the northwest. I don't know what to think. Look for [[Anilia]], she was leading them on the search.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,650 [[XP]] (or {{cost||15|60}} at level 90)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
Judging by the gaping wound in her side, [[Anilia]] is on the verge of death.
