==Objectives==
Deliver the Diabolical Plans to [[Valusha]] at [[Splintertree Post]] in [[Ashenvale]].
* [[Diabolical Plans]] (provided)

== Description ==
The [[demon]] dropped this parchment, which is amazingly written in the [[Orcish (language)|Orcish tongue]]! The ones mentioned in it, [[Diathorus the Seeker|Diathorus]] and [[Gorgannon]], are the two infamous [[Nathrezim|dreadlords]] that control the demons hereabouts.

The plans detail preparations for a demonic attack on Splintertree Post to the northwest.

You're certain that Valusha at Splintertree Post would be interested in these.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 510 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Progress ==
What do you have there, scout?

== Completion ==
Dreadlords! They plan to attack us here at Splintertree Post?!

Not while I still draw breath!

<Valusha crumples the demon-scrawled plans in her fist.>

No. We will not allow this to happen! They are a blight upon [[Azeroth|our world]]!
