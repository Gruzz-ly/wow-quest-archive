==Objectives==
[[Broyk]] wants you to find [[Stikwad]] at [[Thunder Peak]].

==Description==
Greetings, <class>.

Congratulations on your victorious assault on Astranaar. The elves shall not soon forget the humiliation they have suffered at your hand.

But you must know, the elves are not the only obstacle to the Horde's conquering of Ashenvale....

To the east, a shaman of the Earthen Ring requires assistance with yet another crisis. You can find him near the base of the volcano, Thunder Peak.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|50}}
*190 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The goblin stares at you and blinks several times before speaking.>

The spirits whispered that help would soon arrive.

Pardon my surprise, but I was hoping the spirits would guide someone a little more... heroic.

These elementals are trusted allies. Listen to them and do their bidding. If we fail, there will remain nothing in Ashenvale worth fighting for.
