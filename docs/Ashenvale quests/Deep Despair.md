==Objectives==
Marukai at [[Zoram'gar Outpost|Zoram'gar]] wants you to kill 6 Blackfathom Tide Priestesses. 
*[[Blackfathom Tide Priestess]]es slain (6)

==Description==
There is more to this [[naga]] problem than meets the eye, <class>. It appears that the issue will not be resolved by merely thinning their numbers. To humble them, a more severe impression must be made.

Travel to the northern end of [[Zoram Strand]] and enter [[Blackfathom Deeps|Blackfathom Deep]]. Once there, demonstrate to the naga that their presence in this region will no longer be tolerated!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||14|}}
* 1750 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Hello again, <race>.

Have you shown the naga the might of the [[Horde]]?

==Completion==
Excellent!

Let the naga retreat back into the seas where they belong! 

==Notes==
This quest should be done together with [[The Essence of Aku'Mai]].

The Blackfathom Tide Priestesses are not in the actual instance but in the caves in the temple leading to the entrance of the instance.

In {{g|cata}}, the quest rewarded reputation to the [[Warsong Offensive]] instead.
