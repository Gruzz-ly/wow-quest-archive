==Objectives==
Slay any 15 demons at [[Felfire Hill]], [[Demon Fall Canyon]], and [[Demon Fall Ridge]]. 
*[[Demon]]s Slain (15)

== Description==
The remains of the demonic [[Burning Legion]] have been a thorn in our side for far too long!

No more!

The demons are attacking from the areas known as Felfire Hill, Demon Fall Canyon and Demon Fall Ridge to the east.

Go and destroy as many as you can to bring glory to both yourself and the [[Horde]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||13}}
*1650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Are there not demons yet standing?  You call yourself a <race>?  This is no time to be taking a break from the fighting!

==Completion==
That's better!  There's nothing quite like ridding [[Azeroth|our world]] of a demon.  And they make for worthy opponents as well, unlike the weak races of the [[Alliance]].

==Notes==
Kill [[Searing Infernal]]s, [[Roaming Felguard]], or [[Mannoroc Lasher]]s.
