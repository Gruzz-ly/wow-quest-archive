'''Return Fire''' is an Alliance-only quest that pits the adventurer against the Horde forces attacking [[Astranaar]] in [[Ashenvale]].

==Objectives==
Use an [[Astranaar Thrower]] to shoot down 15 [[Hellscream's Hellions]] & their [[Watch Wind Rider]]s.
*[[Hellscream's Hellion|Hellion]]s & Wind Riders shot down (15)

==Description==
The fires are mostly contained, but we have to do something about those wind riders!

Quick, <name>, you have to jump into one of our [[glaive thrower]]s and return fire!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Fiery Loop
|Thenysil's Vest
|Astranaar Legguards
|Glaivethrower Expert's Chestpiece
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|30}}
* 1,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
There's still more of them bombing us. Please, <name>, shoot them down!

==Completion==
We're saved! You've shot down enough of them that we should be able to handle the rest.

I cannot thank you enough, <name>.

==Notes==
* Refer to [[Astranaar Thrower]] for how to use the thrower.
* Completing this quest phases out the fires and wind riders.
* You will no longer be able to drive an Astranaar Thrower after completing this quest. If that ability is more important to you than the drawback of seeing Astranaar on fire &mdash; for example, for roleplaying reasons &mdash; then do not complete this quest. It does not unlock any follow-ups.
