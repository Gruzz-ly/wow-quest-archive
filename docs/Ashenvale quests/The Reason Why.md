==Objectives==
Deactivate the Blue, Green, and Red Moonstones.
*Blue Moonstone deactivated
*Green Moonstone deactivated
*Red Moonstone deactivated

==Description==
The [[Thistlefur tribe|furbolg]] have descended from the heights and overrun the [[Ruins of Ordil'Aran]] to the north. I believe they did so because they were attracted to what the dead [[Cult of the Dark Strand|cultists]] there uncovered: three moonstones.

[[Liladris Moonriver]] will counsel you to deal with the furbolg in a more direct manner, and I will not gainsay her, but I would ask that you go to the ruins and deactivate the moonstones.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|1300}} (or {{coppercost|1020}} at max level)
*1650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Progress==
Surely not all three of the moonstones have been deactivated, <name>. I can still feel their power from here.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

With the moonstones of Ordil'Aran deactivated, we should not need to worry about any further incursions of furbolg here.

However, my scouts have returned with disturbing news from the furbolg [[Thistlefur Village|village]]. There is an imminent danger massing there.

I wonder, might I entice you to carry a warning to [[Astranaar]] for me?

==Notes==
*Complete this quest along with [[Rear Guard Duty]] from [[Liladris Moonriver]].

==Trivia==
The quest text upon completion seems to suggests that players are tasked to bring the news of an imminent furbolg attack to [[Astranaar]], but no quest is actually given. This could be the leftover from a scrapped quest idea.

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2010-12-07|bluenote=Players should no longer experience issues completing this quest when attempting to interact with the various Moonstones in Ashenvale.}}
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
