==Objectives==
Bring the Strange Water Globe to [[Davius Voidstar|Davidus Voidstar]]{{sic}} in [[Auberdine]], {{C|Darkshore}}.
*[[Strange Water Globe (Season of Discovery)]]

==Description==
Greetings <class>. I've heard the most curious stories from the locals of a great corrupted water elemental named [[Baron Aquanis]] that stands vigil near the entrance to the [[night elf|Night Elf]] ruins known as [[Blackfathom Deeps]]. I'm here looking to hire adventurers brave enough to retrieve the core of Baron Aquanis, a globe of corrupted water. In exchange, I'd be willing to give you access to a portal directly to the [[Zoram Strand]] that I've been using to study the environs around the ruins... from a safe distance, of course.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]
*+150 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*+150 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Ah, hello again <name>. Have you retrieved the globe?

==Completion==
Hmm, most curious. This... isn't what I expected. Very well, thank you for this. As promised, you may now utilize my portal to the Zoram Strand.

==Notes==
Completing this quest unlocks a portal from Auberdine to the Zoram Strand to provide quick access to [[Blackfathom Deeps (Season of Discovery)|Blackfathom Deeps]].
