'''Vortex''' completes the quest chain at [[Thunder Peak]] in [[Ashenvale]], in which the elements of water, earth, and air must subdue their brother element of fire, [[Lord Magmathar]].

==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Lord Magmathar.jpg|Lord Magmathar|The very essence of Thunder Peak. Snuff him out!}}

*[[Lord Magmathar]] slain

==Description==
The time has come, <name>. When you have steeled yourself we will speak again and I will summon forth a whirling vortex to speed your way up to the skies over Thunder Peak.

Channel the power of the [[Earthen Ring]] through the elemental to slay Lord Magmathar so that we may bring him into balance once more.

Lord Magmathar must still be slain, <name>.

The power of fire is subdued and the four elements are returned to harmony.

The rest of Ashenvale is spared this fiery fate. You have the eternal thanks of the Earthen Ring.
