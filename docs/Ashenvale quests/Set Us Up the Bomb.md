==Objectives==
[[Tweedle]] at [[Hellscream's Watch]] wants you to collect 10 samples of Moon-Kissed Clay.
*[[Moon-Kissed Clay]] (10)

==Description==
I'm definitely on to something here!

I have enough volatile elements salvaged from our arsenal to make the explosives Goggath wants, but I need to stabilize it and pack it into bombs.

What I need is some clay - and not just any clay... Moon-kissed Clay.

It's only found on the northern banks of Astranaar Lake, and it possesses the qualities I need to bring out the full potential of my discovery!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||15|}}
*1,850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Let's see what you've brought me, <race>.

==Completion==
This is PERFECT!

Oh, just wait 'til you see what I can do with this....

==Trivia==
The quest title is a nod to the phrase "Someone set up us the bomb," an infamously poor Japanese-to-English translation of a cutscene in the Sega video game ''Zero Wing''. This is the same cutscene that originated the Internet meme "{{wplink|All your base are belong to us}}."

In {{g|cata}}, the quest rewarded reputation to the [[Warsong Offensive]].
