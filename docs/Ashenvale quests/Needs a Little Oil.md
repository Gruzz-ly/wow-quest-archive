==Objectives==
[[Gorka]] at [[Warsong Labor Camp]] wants you to collect 5 Natural Oil from the [[Rotting Slime]]s in [[Ashenvale]].
*[[Natural Oil]] (5)

==Description==
You have your wood, but the encroaching [[Night elf|elves]] have made it impossible for [[Brutusk|your kodo]] to return to [[Mor'shan Rampart]]s.

I've dispatched a runner to [[Splintertree Post|Splintertree]] to summon aid. It shouldn't take long for their forces to clear the way.

In the meantime, I would ask that you do us a service. Rust has rendered our [[shredder]]s inoperable. A little lubrication and they'll be as good as new.

The oil from the rotting slimes just north of here should work just fine.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
{{cost||13|}}
*1650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Were you able to collect the oil we need, <class>?

==Completion==
Thank you for the oil, <class>. Now prepare yourself!

My runner has returned with some desperate news....

Splintertree is surrounded!

==Progression==

*In {{Expac|Cataclysm}}, the quest awarded reputation to the [[Warsong Offensive]].
