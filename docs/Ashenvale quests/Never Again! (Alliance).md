'''Never Again!''' is a quest in Ashenvale.

==Objectives==
Obtain Gorgannon's Flaming Blade and the Seeker's Fel Spear. 
*[[Gorgannon's Flaming Blade]]
*[[Seeker's Fel Spear]]

== Description ==
<Name>, it falls to you to see that this attack by the [[Burning Legion]] never comes to pass. You must go and slay their leaders. Without them the rest of the demons are essentially mindless.

You will find Gorgannon in [[Demon Fall Canyon]] south beyond [[Felfire Hill]], near [[Mannoroth]]'s floating, broken spear.

Diathorus the Seeker resides somewhere in the barrow den atop [[Demon Fall Ridge]]. To find the ridge, look for a ramp up from Demon Fall Canyon near the monument to [[Grom Hellscream]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Band of Argus
|Seal of Argus (ring)
|Signet of Argus
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|30}}
* 1,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Our night elf scouts report that preparations for the attack are almost complete. Those dreadlords must die soon, <name>! 

==Completion==
Never again will the Burning Legion threaten us here!  You have delivered us from a fight we very likely would have lost, <class>.

I give you thanks and the deepest gratitude of the [[Hand of Argus]].  It honors me to have you at our side.

==Progression==
{{Reclaiming Felfire Hill}}
