==Objectives==
Speak with [[Sentinel Velene Starstrike]] at [[Stardust Spire]].

==Description==
We've lost [[Silverwind Refuge]]! All that I know is that there was a surprise attack by the [[Horde]] and that they somehow turned [[Mystral Lake]]'s elemental guardians against us.

The survivors have fallen back to Stardust Spire. <Name>, they need your help.

Head south by southeast. You'll find the spire at the mouth of the [[Talondeep Pass]], which leads into the [[Stonetalon Mountains]]. I'm sure that you'll find Sentinel Velene Starstrike helping with the counter-offensive there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*260 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
Good to finally meet you, <name>. I've heard all about what you've been up to and let me just say that I'm impressed!

Think you can lend us your expertise?
