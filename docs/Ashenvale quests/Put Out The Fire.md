==Objectives==
Slay 10 Lava Ragers. If you need another [[Freezing Surger]], speak with [[Arctanus]].
*[[Lava Rager]] slain (10)

== Description ==
[[Lord Magmathar]]'s minions must first be dealt with if we're to retake this area and put a stop to the fiery destruction of the forest.

The lava ragers on the flow to the north are strengthened by being on their own element. I fear that on your own, you won't have much chance against them.

When you are ready, speak to me again, and I will summon [[Freezing Surger|one of my own]] to assist you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||15|}}
*1850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There are yet more lava ragers that need to be destroyed, <race>.

== Completion ==
You acquitted yourself well in battle on the field. However, I'm afraid that Lord Magmathar has taken notice of you and the destruction that you've wreaked upon his minions.

You will have to deal with him or he is sure to burn you alive, <name>.

==Notes==
Arctanus will summon a Freezing Surger to assist players in combat against the elite-level lava ragers:
{{Effecttip
| doc=
| name = Freezing Surger
| etype = buff
| description = You may only have one freezing surger at a time to assist you against lava ragers. You must stay within the bounds of Thunder Peak or you will lose your freezing surger.
| icon = spell_frost_summonwaterelemental_2
| float = none
}}

The Freezing Surger is a [[Guardian pet|guardian]]; the player has no control over the Surger's attacks.
