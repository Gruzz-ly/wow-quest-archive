==Objectives==
[[Captain Goggath|Goggath]] wants you to bring the Battle Triage Kit to [[Thagg]] at [[Raynewood Retreat]].
*[[Battle Triage Kit]] (provided)

==Description==
We have the enemy on their heels. Victory is within sight!

It is not yet time to celebrate though, <class>. There remains much to be done before the Horde can lay claim to [[Ashenvale]].

At Raynewood Retreat to the east a battle has been joined. Reports indicate many Horde wounded.

Take these medical supplies there and give them to Thagg. Tell him of our assault on [[Astranaar]]. It may help to bolster morale.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||8|}}
*920 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Thagg listens intently as you recount your assault on Astranaar.>

This is good news indeed, <race>. But right now, we need more than just good news here.

These triage kits will be put to good use!
