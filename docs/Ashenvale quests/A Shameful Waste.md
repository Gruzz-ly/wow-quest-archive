==Objectives==
Collect 5 Satyrnaar Fel Wood. 
*[[Satyrnaar Fel Wood]] (5)

==Description==
Welcome to Forest Song, <class>. Where you see tents, there will one day be buildings, but such ambition requires a steady stream of materials. I cannot bring myself to order our workers to fell any of the ancient trees of this grove, but our neighbors to the west have no such reverence for the forest.

We shall reclaim the tainted wood from Satyrnaar to the west. Take the wood to Gnarl at the Warsong Lumber Camp. He is an Ancient who will purify it for our use.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||13}}
*2650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
<The ancient creaks as it turns toward you.>

Architect Nemos said that you might be bringing wood salvaged from befouled Satyrnaar.

==Completion==
Wood warped by foul demonic magic is of no use to the draenei at Forest Song. Nothing sound can be built with it, but I shall purify it and return it in good time to Architect Nemos and his people for their use.

Some good will come from this tragedy, after all.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Quest level reduced from 28 to 21. No longer requires [[Warsong Lumber]]. Text updated.}}
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
