==Objectives==
[[Foreman Jinx]] wants you to collect 3 Bronze Cogs, 3 pieces of Copper Plating, and 5 Locking Bolts.
* [[Bronze Cog]] (3)
* [[Copper Plating]] (3)
* [[Locking Bolt]] (5)

== Description ==
Once it's complete, we're going to need to get this bomb down to [[Saurboz]].

And by 'we', I mean 'you'.

With so many of the enemy prowling about, I'll need to create something special if you're to have any chance of success.

I can modify one of these busted shredders, but I'll need a few parts. You should have no trouble finding them in the woods to the west.

Round them up while I finish work on the bomb.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Progress ==
You got those parts I need, friend?

== Completion ==
This looks right, <class>.

I should have your shredder put together in no time.

==Progression==
