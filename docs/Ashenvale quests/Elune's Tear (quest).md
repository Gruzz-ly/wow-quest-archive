==Objectives==
Collect Elune's Tear.
*[[Elune's Tear]]

==Description==
I'd hoped [[Orendil Broadleaf|Orendil]]'s cure would save [[Relara Whitemoon|Relara]], but I fear it only slowed the disease running through her. We must find more powerful medicine! Thankfully, Orendil spoke to me of further remedies should his first one fail.

Elune's Tear is a type of stone that rests in only one place: the [[remains of Iris Lake]], destroyed by the eruption of [[Thunder Peak]], northeast of [[Astranaar]]. Orendil said the stone will wash away corruption.

Please, <name>, bring me Elune's Tear and pray it will end my child's sickness!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|1500}} (or {{coppercost|1140}} at max level)
* 1850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
<Name>, did you find the remains of the lake?  Do you have the Tear?

==Completion==
Oh, you found it! Odd... it looks tarnished somehow. I will place the tear in a stew, and pray that it will cure her.

Thank you! Thank you, <name>!

==Notes==
The soot-covered Elune's Tear can be found at the Remains of Iris Lake{{coords|45|47|Ashenvale}}. The area is patrolled by [[Singed Shambler]]s.
