==Objectives==
Obtain a Bottle of Wildfire and throw it at [[Bathran's Corpse]] to burn it.
*Bathran's corpse burned
*[[Bottle of Wildfire]] (provided)

==Description==
These creatures... these so-called Horde... they have cut me down in my prime and they are harvesting my [[Bathran's Hair|hair]] for their evil plans.

Will you help me to put an end to it, little <race>?

I have overheard their herbalists speaking of something called wildfire upon their table across the way. If you were to take the bottle of this unnatural stuff and throw it at my corpse to the northeast, it would burn and no more of my hair will grow here.

I am already dead and it is a small price to pay to stop them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|0}} (or {{coppercost|1020}} at max level)
*1650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Progress==
Your lives are all so short. Why is it that you insist on squandering them by killing each other?

==Completion==
You have helped me to return to the ground, <name>.

Now my hair will cease to sprout for these creatures. Better yet, I will be regrown all the sooner.
