==Objectives==
Speak to [[Kalen Trueshot]] at [[Trueshot Point]] in [[Stonetalon Mountains]].

==Description==
So these [[Night elf|night elves]] send out a desperate call for help to us, goes something like this:

<Gnombus changes the pitch of his voice to sound like a woman.>

"Please come help us! The big, mean [[Horde]] has [[goblin]]s! Oh, we can't handle goblins! They pull our hair and make us cry!"

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|0}} (or {{coppercost|120}} at max level)
*200 XP (or {{coppercost|120}} at max level)

==Completion==
