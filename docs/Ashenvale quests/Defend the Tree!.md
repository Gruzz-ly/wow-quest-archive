==Objectives==
Speak with [[Halannia]] to summon the [[Shade of Shadumbra]] and use its power to destroy any 50 [[Warsong]] enemies at [[Raynewood Retreat]].
*Warsong enemies destroyed (50)

==Description==
We have been using the power of the [[Forest Heart]] to defend the tree from the Horde, but its power is not without limit. We must use it to take the fight to them!

[[Shadumbra]], the great cat of the forest, prowls nearby. It is from her that we shall draw our inspiration. You will become one with the shade of Shadumbra. You will take the essence of the panther into you and lay waste to those who dare attack the might of Ashenvale!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Raynewood Shield
|Shadumbra's Wrath
|Frostshadow Crossbow
|Shadumbra's Might
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|30}}
* 1,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

== Progress ==
It doesn't appear to me that you're quite finished, <name>.  Speak with Halannia at the tree again to become invoked with the shade of Shadumbra.

Slay our enemies!

==Completion==
A brutal display, but one fitting for the enemies of Ashenvale. The Horde dares to think that they can take our beloved forest away from us.

They are fatally mistaken!

You have saved [[Raynewood]] from destruction, <name>. Surely we can find a reward suitable for our champion?

==Notes==
Kill [[Warsong Demolisher]]s and [[Warsong Trampler]]s.

==Progression==
{{Recover the Fallen}}
