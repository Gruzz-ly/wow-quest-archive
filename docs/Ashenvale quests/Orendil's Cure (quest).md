{{For|the quest before [[patch 4.0.3a]]|Orendil's Cure (Classic)}}

==Objectives==
Bring Orendil's Cure to [[Pelturas Whitemoon]] at [[Astranaar]] in [[Ashenvale]].
*[[Orendil's Cure]] (provided)

==Description==
<Name>, now that it has been bathed in [[Elune]]'s blessed light, I believe that the concoction will help the [[Relara Whitemoon|afflicted child]]. Please, take it to Astranaar and give it to the child's parent, Pelturas Whitemoon.

To reach Astranaar, follow the road south and then east. However, if you'd like to get there more swiftly, speak with [[Sentinel Avana]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|3000}} (or {{coppercost|1380}} at max level)
* 2300 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
I must apologize, for I have no time to speak. My child, Relara, is deathly ill!

==Completion==
This is from Orendil?

His skill with herbs and healing is great! This cure gives me hope, when before I had little....

==Notes==
Before heading out, take [[Astranaar Bound]] at [[Maestra's Post]]. It will allow you to quickly reach Astranaar.
