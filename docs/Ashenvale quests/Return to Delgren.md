==Objectives==
Return the Orb Shards to [[Delgren the Purifier|Delgren]].
*[[Orb Fragments]] (provided)

==Description==
<The shattered remains of the orb lay at your feet. Delgren will want to see you have succeeded.>

==Progress==
Did you find a way to destroy the orb?

==Rewards==
You will learn:
*Engrave Chest - [[Divine Storm (paladin rune)]]

==Completion==
This is a relief, <name>. But whatever was watching [[Azeroth]] through that orb... I have a feeling they will not be happy it was destroyed.

Take this as my thanks for your efforts. And... be careful.

==Progression==
{{A Strange Artifact}}

==Notes==
The follow-up quest, [[Some Good News]], requires reaching level 44 and completing [[Aeonas the Vindicated (quest)]].
