==Objectives==
Use Gorat's Imbued Blood on [[Gorat]]'s corpse, then defeat Captain Elendilad.
* [[Captain Elendilad]] slain
*[[Gorat's Imbued Blood]] (provided)

==Description==
Fortune is with us this day, <race>.

Gorat's blood was fresh enough for me to conduct a special ritual taught to me as a child.

Use this imbued blood on Gorat's corpse to summon forth his lingering [[Ghost|spirit]].

Do his final bidding, then report back here to [[Kadrak]].

Spirits keep you safe, friend.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Gorat's Bequest

You will also receive:

* 1,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
What have you learned, <race>?

==Completion==
Well done, <race>.

The [[Night elf|elf]] [[Captain (rank)|captain]] is dead and the soul of one of our beloved brethren can sleep in peace.

I shall pass on word of your deeds to my superiors in [[Orgrimmar]].
