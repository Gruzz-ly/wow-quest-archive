==Objectives==
Slay the insane druids: Taneel Darkwood, Uthil Mooncall, and Mavoris Cloudsbreak. 
* [[Taneel Darkwood]] slain
* [[Uthil Mooncall]] slain
* [[Mavoris Cloudsbreak]] slain

==Description==
The [[druid]]s are dead, killed by their leaders who were driven insane by the [[Horde]] tainting the [[Forest Heart]]! I can feel the corruption even from here and I dare go no further.

While I am too well attuned to [[Ashenvale]] and the Forest Heart, you... you could descend into the barrow den and do what must be done. I've laid down breadcrumbs for you in there.

Though it tears me apart, I must ask that you put to rest the druids' once great leaders: Taneel Darkwood, Uthil Mooncall, and Mavoris Cloudsbreak. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Emil's Brand
|Emil's Staff
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|30}}
* 1,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
Rest in peace, my friends.

<You can see the sorrow in the druid cat's eyes.>

I felt the anguish of the [[Dor'Danil Barrow Den|Dor'danil Barrows]] lessen, and knew that you had completed your task.

It was grim work that you did, <name>, for the spirits you destroyed were merely victims of the Horde's evil. But with their destruction, let us hope the maddened spirits will finally find peace.
