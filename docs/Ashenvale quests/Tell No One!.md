{{questportrait|Draaka.jpg|Draaka|Whatever you do, don't read that note.}}
==Objectives==
[[Draaka]] in [[Splintertree]] wants you to bring the Hastily Written Note to [[Durak (demon)|Durak]].
*[[Hastily Written Note]] (provided)

==Description==
Perfect!

This will show the [[Night elf|elves]] what the [[Horde]] is capable of when we're backed into a corner.

Listen, <name>. You must say nothing of this to anyone!

[[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]] will surely approve once he sees the results, but if we are found out beforehand, our heads will be placed on spikes!

<Draaka hands you a hastily written note.>

Bring this to Durak. You can find him in the mines behind me, just to the north. He will instruct you further.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost||3|50}}
*435 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
What's this? Who are you!?

<Durak reads Draaka's note.>

Hrmphh...

Draaka should know better than to be so brazen, but it looks like you're up to your eyes in this with as much to lose as anyone.

Very well.
