==Objectives==
Slay any 15 [[Wrathtail]] naga at the [[Zoram Strand]].
*Wrathtail naga slain (15)

==Description==
There is evil lurking on the coast to the west.

The Zoram Strand is the resting place of the doomed city of Zoram, destroyed during the Sundering and submerged beneath the seas. It has been lost to the night elves for ages. Lost, and nearly forgotten.

Now, the naga have returned, and for what reason we do not know. But reason matters little; we must slay these fiends and throw them back to the depths!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|1300}} (or {{coppercost|1020}} at max level)
*1650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
Very well done, <name>. Your actions in the Zoram Strand against the naga are commendable.

I know your feat was not easily accomplished, for the strength and guile of the naga is well known to the night elves. We know this, for we share a history with them.

The naga are cursed Highborne night elves. Ten thousand years ago, Queen Azshara made a pact of desperation with the Old Gods to save her surviving people from a watery grave.

The naga are the result of that pact.
