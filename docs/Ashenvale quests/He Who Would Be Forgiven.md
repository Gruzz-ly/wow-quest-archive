==Objectives==
Speak with [[Avrus Illwhisper]] at [[Raynewood Tower]] in [[Ashenvale]].

==Description==
;Automatic
<[[Elune|A voice]] from inside the [[Moonwell of Purity|moonwell]] flows over your mind, bringing you a perfect sense of peace.>

You seek to cure a [[Relara Whitemoon|child]], but know that all things come at a cost. To the east lies Raynewood Tower. Standing outside the tower, next to my moonwell, is one who has fallen into corruption.

Avrus Illwhisper seeks forgiveness and redemption, <name>. Will you help him to attain that which he desires and in so doing achieve your own goal?
