==Objectives==
Kill any 10 Horde at [[Bathran's Haunt]].
*[[Horde]] at Bathran's Haunt slain (10)

==Description==
[[Evenar Stillwhisper|Evenar]] and the other [[Orendil's Apprentice|apprentice]]s may not be much use in a battle, but you look like you can more than hold your own. The Horde scum across the road to the east at Bathran's Haunt need to be taught a lesson.

Their new warlord, [[Garrosh Hellscream]], has them up to no good. Feel like teaching them a thing or two?

I'd come with you, but my assignment is to stay here and protect [[Orendil Broadleaf|Orendil]]'s apprentices, and that's exactly what I'm going to do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|1300}} (or {{coppercost|1020}} at max level)
*1650 [[XP]]
+*250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Look, <name>, I wasn't born yesterday. Far from it.

<The sentinel smiles softly as she reins in her nightsaber.>

Perhaps you're simply here to buy some fruit before heading back to finish off the Horde?

==Completion==
<The sentinel eyes you appreciatively for a moment.>

A job well done, <class>. If you're any indication of the quality of the <race> adventurers we're going to be seeing more of, we should have this war against the orcs and their Horde taken care of faster than expected.

==Notes==
*The Horde at Bathran's Haunt consists of [[Forsaken Herbalist]]s and [[Orc Overseer]]s.
