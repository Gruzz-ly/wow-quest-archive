==Objectives==
Place Senani's Banner on the Foulweald Totem Mound. Do not let the [[Foulweald|furbolg]]s destroy the banner. Defeat [[Chief Murgut]] and bring Murgut's Totem to [[Senani Thunderheart|Senani]] at [[Silverwind Refuge]].
*[[Murgut's Totem]]
*[[Senani's Banner]] (provided)

==Description==
My research has paid off.

I believe that with a show of force, we can diminish the furbolgs' aggressiveness.

Take this banner a short ways northeast and place it on their totem mound. They will try to destroy the banner, but hold your ground until their chief, Murgut, appears to save face for the tribe. Bring me the totem he carries.

Gather your allies, <name>. This is no task for a single <class>.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Boorguard Tunic
|Cobalt Legguards
|Feral Vestment
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||10|15}}
* 250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you defeat Chief Murgut, <name>?  Did you retrieve his Foulweald Totem?

==Completion==
Good work, <name>.  Issuing that challenge to the Foulwealds and defeating their leader sends them a strong message:

The Horde is not to be trifled with.

I don't believe that tribe will be giving us much trouble for a long time.

==Notes==
The totem mound is in [[Greenpaw Village]]{{coords|56|63|Ashenvale}}.

After planting the banner, [[Enraged Foulweald]]s will spawn and attack, one at a time. After about 6 or 7 attackers, Chief Murgut will appear.
