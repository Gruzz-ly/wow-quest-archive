==Objectives==
Slay any 15 demons at [[Felfire Hill]], [[Demon Fall Canyon]], and [[Demon Fall Ridge]].
*[[Demon]]s Slain (15)

==Description==
I will not tolerate their existence on this world! The [[Burning Legion]] all but destroyed [[draenei|our race]] and we fell back to settle a new home on a [[Azeroth|new world]]. Then they came again. And we retreated, over and over.

No more!

There is a remnant of the Legion to the south in the regions known as Felfire Hill, Demon Fall Canyon and Demon Fall Ridge. They are what is leftover from a force that once long ago invaded this world.

Go and destroy as many as you can before it is too late!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||13}}
*1650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Completion==
You have my respect and thanks, <class>.  Perhaps we'll be able to create a new home here without having to worry about the Burning Legion yet again.

==Progression==
{{Reclaiming Felfire Hill}}
