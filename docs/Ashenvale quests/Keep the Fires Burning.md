==Objectives==
[[Commander Grimfang]] at [[Zoram'gar]] wants you to pour [[Mystlash Hydra Oil]] on the lighthouse fire.
* Lighthouse Fire lit

==Description==
This is no small task, <race>!

We have more ships arriving, and without the lighthouse they'll be lost - or worse! You are hereby charged with keeping its fire lit.

Collect the [[Mystlash Hydra Blubber|blubber]] from the hydras in these waters, then bring it to the forge here to melt it into [[Mystlash Hydra Oil|oil]].

Throwing that oil on the lighthouse fire will buy us the time we need.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Oily Bracers
|Alighted Boots
|Mystlash Bracers
|Darkbreaker Treads
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||10|15}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Well, <class>...

Have you done as I asked?

==Completion==
Nice work, <race>!

No more ships will run aground, thanks to you. 

== Notes ==
*The fire is on the top deck of the lighthouse.{{coords|6|29|Ashenvale}}
*To light the lighthouse fire you must have [[Mystlash Hydra Oil]] which is created by collecting 10 [[Mystlash Hydra Blubber]] from [[Mystlash Hydra]]s and cooking them at the forge in [[Zoram'gar Outpost]].

*In {{Expac|Cataclysm}}, the quest awarded reputation to the [[Warsong Offensive]].
