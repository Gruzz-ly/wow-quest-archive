'''To Raene Wolfrunner''' continues the Dartol's Rod quest chain. In this quest chain, Alliance adventurers are asked to complete [[Teronis]]' work, namely, to re-assemble a [[Dartol's Rod|rod]] that may help the night elves deal with the corrupted [[furbolg]] of [[Ashenvale]]. As a friend of Teronis, Raene will instruct the adventurer how to proceed.

==Objectives==
Deliver the Glowing Gem to [[Raene Wolfrunner]] at [[Astranaar]] in [[Ashenvale]].
*[[Glowing Gem]] (provided)

==Description==
I would ask you to deliver the gem directly to Raene Wolfrunner. Last I heard, she was still in Astranaar to the southeast.

At least the road between here and there is still relatively safe, so it should be a simple matter of following it there. Of course, if you'd rather, I believe that [[Sentinel Avana]] would be willing to loan you one of her [[nightsaber]]s to swiftly make the trip.

Whatever you choose, good health to you, <name>. May our paths cross again soon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|0}} (or {{coppercost|270}} at max level)
*460 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Progress==
I am Raene Wolfrunner. Who might you be?

==Completion==
[[Teronis]] is dead?

<The lady weeps softly for the loss of her friend and then composes herself after a moment.>

We must see to it that his sacrifice was not in vain. Are you willing to see this through, <class>?

Very well, allow me some time to think about how we should proceed. I will know shortly.
