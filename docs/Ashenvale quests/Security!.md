==Objectives==
[[Overseer Gorthak]] wants you to bring him the Kaldorei Assassin's Head.
*[[Kaldorei Assassin's Head]]

==Description==
It's not as like I haven't got enough to think about here!

Keeping this place operational is hard enough without constant [[Night elf|elf]] and [[draenei]] harassment.

Now, on top of everything, there's an [[assassin]] lurking around the camp who's killed an important [[Envoy Sheelah|diplomat]]... on my watch!

Whoever it is couldn't have gotten far, <class>. Scour the camp until you find her and then avenge the diplomat!

At least I can bring the assassin's head with me when I have to answer to [[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]]. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Detective Buckler
|Pilfered Kaldorei Belt
|Security Crossbow
|Gorthak's Tool Belt
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||10|15}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
I want to know one thing, <race>.

Is that assassin dead?

==Completion==
Well done, <class>.

One last request - it would probably be best if none of my laborers knew this assassin ever existed. 

==Notes==
As the player scours the camp:
:{{text|emote|You have a feeling someone is watching you....}}
:{{text|emote|You think you see a shadowy figure out of the corner of your eye.}}
:{{text|emote|A kaldorei assassin leaps from the shadows and attacks <name>!}}

;If not found
:{{Text|emote|A kaldorei assassin evades <name>'s gaze and slips into the shadows.}}

Nearby Horde NPCs will not help with combat.

In {{Expac|Cataclysm}}, the quest awarded reputation to the [[Warsong Offensive]].
