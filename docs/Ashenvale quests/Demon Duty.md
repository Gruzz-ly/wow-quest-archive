==Objectives==
{{npc||Locke Okarr}} in [[Splintertree Post|Splintertree]] wants you to close 12 Satyr Portals in [[Satyrnaar]] and [[Xavian]].
*[[Ritual Gem|Demon Portals]] Interrupted (12)

==Description==
Listen, <class>, I know this assault on Splintertree has everyone worked up, but if we forget about the [[satyr]] portals we'll come out of this crisis to face an even larger one.

<Locke stares at your expressionless face.>

You don't know about the portals?

To the northeast, in the regions of Satyrnaar and Xavian, the satyrs are attempting to summon in [[demon]]s to bolster their numbers.

We must be vigilant in closing those portals, no matter what issues we face here!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||14|}}
*1750 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Have you managed to close the satyr portals, <race>?

==Completion==
Good work, <race>.

One less thing we have to worry about! 

==Notes==
You will need to complete [[Diabolical Plans (Horde)]] and [[Never Again!]] before Locke Okarr offers this quest.
