==Objectives==
Bring 8 Troll Charms to [[Mitsuwa]] at [[Hellscream's Watch]].
*[[Troll Charm]] (8)

==Description==
My kinfolk were traveling here with many sacred troll charms, but the [[Thistlefur tribe|Thistlefur]] [[furbolg]]s attacked and killed them before they reached [[Zoram'gar Outpost|Zoram'gar]]<ref>Pre-[[Shattering]], Mitsuwa was located at [[Zoram'gar Outpost]]. The quest text must not have been updated to reflect his change in location.</ref>! Those vile furbolgs!

I miss my brothers and sisters who were killed, but we will meet again in the afterlife. However, their troll charms hold great value in this world. It is an outrage that the furbolgs have them!

<Name>, you must retrieve the charms! They are in chests in [[Thistlefur Hold]], a cave at the end of [[Thistlefur Village]], north of [[Astranaar]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Did you find the charms, <name>?  Every moment the furbolgs possess those sacred items, my blood boils with rage!

==Completion==
You found them!  Thank you!  Thank you, <name>!  You do not know how great a thing you have done for me.

A troll without her charm is like an orc without her battle scars...

Worthless.
