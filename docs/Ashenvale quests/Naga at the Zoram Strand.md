==Objective==
Bring 20 Wrathtail Heads to [[Marukai]] along the [[Zoram Strand]].
* [[Wrathtail Head]] (20)

==Description==
There is evil lurking here along the coast, <race>.

It is the resting place of the doomed city of Zoram, long destroyed and submerged beneath the seas. Lost, and nearly forgotten.

Now, the naga have returned, and for what reason we do not know. But reason matters little; we must defend the land we have worked so hard to claim as our own.

Return to me with 20 of their heads! Throw the [[naga]] back to the depths!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
The naga increase in numbers, <name>. Please complete this task for me.

==Completion==
We could use more of your kind around here, <name>. Thank you for your help.
