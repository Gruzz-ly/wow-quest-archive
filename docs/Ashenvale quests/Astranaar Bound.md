==Objectives==
Speak with [[Sentinel Luara]] at [[Astranaar]] in [[Ashenvale]].

==Description==
You have been of great assistance to us, <name>. Without you, we would have been wiped out by now.

It would be my pleasure to offer you one of my nightsabers anytime to ride to Astranaar up and to the southeast. I'm sure that you have very important business to attend to there.

I would consider it a great kindness if you would speak with my sister, Sentinel Luara, when you arrive to tell her that I am well.

Just speak to me again when you are ready to go, and anytime that you need a ride it is yours.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|0}} (or {{coppercost|120}} at max level)
*190 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Completion==
Avana is alive?! I feared that she might be dead when we heard about the attack on [[Maestra's Post]]!

As you can see, we have our hands full with the Horde here as well.

You have given me the greatest gift by letting me know she is well. Any time that you wish to ride one of my nightsabers back to Maestra's Post, it is yours.
