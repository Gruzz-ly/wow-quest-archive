==Objectives==
[[Kadrak]] wants you to bring the Blood-Soaked Axe to [[Durak (demon)|Durak]] in [[Splintertree Post]].
*[[Blood-Soaked Axe]] (provided)

==Description==
We knew the [[Night elf|elves]] wouldn't go down without a fight, but no one expected them to be able to lay siege to Splintertree...

Time for them to pay for their actions!

Nearby, in the [[Dor'Danil Barrow Den]], lies something very dear to the enemy - the [[Forest Heart]].

I need someone to make their way to the heart and corrupt it.

That someone is you, <name>.

First though, bring my axe to Durak here in the mines. He'll make use of the blood of our enemies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||7|}} 
*870 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
Tainting the Forest's Heart?

How ruthless - an utterly vicious blow....

I adore the idea!

==Progression==
{{Ashenvale questline - Splintertree Post}}

==Trivia==
*In {{Expac|Cataclysm}}, the quest awarded reputation to the [[Warsong Offensive]].
