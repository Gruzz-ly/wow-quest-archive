==Objectives==
Place the Bloodtooth Banner on the [[Foulweald Totem Mound]]. Do not let the furbolgs destroy the banner before their chief arrives. Defeat Chief Murgut.
*[[Chief Murgut]] slain
*[[Bloodtooth Banner]] (provided)

==Description==
I care little for who you are, <race>. What I do care about is the salvation of the furbolg.

Take this Bloodtooth tribe banner a short ways northeast into [[Greenpaw Village]] and place it upon their totem mound. They will consider this an act of aggression and try to destroy the banner. Hold your ground until their chief, Murgut, appears to save face for the tribe, then kill the traitor!

Govern your strength wisely, friend, you're in for a long fight.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Greenpaw Belt
|Band of Perseverance
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||18|}}
* 2,550 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Did you defeat Chief Murgut, <name>?

==Completion==
Good. Murgut sold his own tribe out to the [[Horde]], allying with them when they took your precious [[Silverwind Refuge]] in order to 'save' his people.

He sold them into slavery, or worse. And now he has gotten what he deserved!

Let us speak now of a different traitor, one whom I believe has something that will make that rod of yours even more powerful.

==Notes==
The totem mound is in [[Greenpaw Village]]{{coords|56|63|Ashenvale}}.

After planting the banner, [[Enraged Foulweald]]s will spawn and attack, one at a time. After about 6 or 7 attackers, Chief Murgut will appear.
