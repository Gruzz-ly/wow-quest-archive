==Objectives==
Find the Wooden Key and use it to obtain the Iron Shaft portion of [[:Dartol's Rod]].
*[[Iron Shaft]]
*[[Wooden Key]]

==Description==
I wish your tidings were better.

[[Raene Wolfrunner|Raene]] is correct, I know about [[Dartol]]'s creation and the [[treant]]s in the area--at least I did once. They've become corrupted now, their nature twisted.

To find the next piece of the rod, you'll have to find the key to open the chest it's in.

The wooden key is on one of the treants northeast of here near the [[Felwood]] border, at the [[Howling Vale]]. Once you have it, look for a small glade through the tunnel at the vale. The chest should be hidden around there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||15|}}
*1,850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
It upsets me so that the treants have become corrupt. I wish I could do more to help them.

==Completion==
I'm pleased to see you're back, <name>.
