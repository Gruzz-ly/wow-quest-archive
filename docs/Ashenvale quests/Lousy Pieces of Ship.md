==Objectives==
Recover 10 pieces of Sunken Scrap Metal.
*[[Sunken Scrap Metal]] (10)

==Description==
Shoddy workmanship! There's no other explanation...

These ships must've been constructed in a hurry. Entire pieces of armor plating are falling off without even sustaining a direct hit!

I'll show them how it is to be done. But first, I need you to recover the pieces from the sea floor.

Return to me with the pieces and I'll do the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|1400}}
*1750 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Were you able to recover that armor plating, <race>?

==Completion==
Good work, <race>.

I'll show them how an armored ship should be built!

==Notes==
*In ''Cataclysm'', the quest awarded reputation to the [[Warsong Offensive]], but it was changed to [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]] at some point.
