==Objectives==
[[Krokk]] wants you to kill Dorinar, Arminon, Endolar, and 12 Ashenvale Scouts.

Speak to [[Kadrak]] in [[Splintertree]] if you lose your [[Secret Signal Powder]].
*[[Protector Endolar]] slain
*[[Protector Dorinar]] slain
*[[Protector Arminon]] slain
*[[Ashenvale Scout]]s slain (12)

==Description==
Listen carefully, <class>.

There are three leaders in this region who are commanding [[Night elf|the elves]], keeping their focus directed on the lumber camp. Slaying them will certainly cause panic and disarray, hopefully enough for us to successfully complete our mission.

While you're at it, bringing down their scouts can only aid our cause.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Is it done, <class>?

==Completion==
Well done, <class>.

They're in complete disarray. Just look at them!
