==Objectives==
Using Accursed Ore to mark targets for [[Draaka]], you are to kill 30 Night Elf troops and 5 Raging Ancients.

Speak with Durak to reapply Imp Disguise.
*Attacking Elves Slain (30)
*Raging Ancients Slain (5)
*[[Accursed Ore]] (provided)

==Description==
Just in time, <class>. The elves have launched another attack!

From the guard towers, use the Accursed Ore to mark targets for Draaka.

Her projectiles will strike your target and erupt in fel magic flame, destroying any nearby enemies.

There is strong prejudice against the use of demonic magics. Unjustified, but real nonetheless. For this reason, I will transform you into an imp for the duration of the mission to prevent you from being identified.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Impish Blade
|Accursed Mace
|Durak's Wand
|Band of Foul Strength}}

==Progress==
Has the enemy fallen, <name>?

==Completion==
Did you feel it, <name>!?

The raw fel power seething through your being?

There is nothing else like it!

==Notes==
On accepting the quest, the player will receive an "Imp Disguise" buff:
{{Effecttip
|doc=
|etype=buff
|name=Imp Disguise
|type=
|duration=
|icon=racial_troll_berserk
|description=Wearer is enshrouded in the form of an imp. A dirty, devious, depraved little imp.
|float= none
}}

The mine will phase: the ceiling shows signs of collapse and the [[Splintertree Peon]]s cower:
:{{text|say|Splintertree Peon|Me not like ground shaking....}}
:{{text|say|Splintertree Peon|Wh-what happening!?!}}
:{{text|say|Splintertree Peon|Splintertree under attack!!}}
:{{text|yell|Splintertree Overseer|Don't let a little elf attack get in the way of your work!}}
:{{text|yell|Splintertree Overseer|Back to work, dogs! We're behind schedule!}}
:{{text|yell|Splintertree Overseer|Get back to digging! This ore won't mine itself!}}

On exiting the mine and approaching the front gates:
:{{text|bossemote|Climb the guard towers!}}

Atop the towers:
:{{text|bossemote|Use the Accursed Ore to direct artillery fire!}}
:{{text|yell|Draaka|For the Horde!!}}
:{{text|yell|Draaka|Blood and thunder!!}}

Use the Ore to create an [[AoE]] target for Draaka.

When finished, be sure to remain in imp disguise to turn in the quest to Durak.
