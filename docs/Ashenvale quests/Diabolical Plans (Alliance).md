Requires [[Diabolical Plans (starter)|Diabolical Plans]] to start the quest
Drops from demons in [[Ashenvale]]. 

==Objectives==
Deliver the Diabolical Plans to [[Vindicator Vedaar]] at [[Forest Song]] in [[Ashenvale]].
*[[Diabolical Plans]] (provided)

==Description==
The demon dropped this parchment, which is amazingly written in the Common tongue! The ones mentioned in it, [[Diathorus the Seeker|Diathorus]] and [[Gorgannon]], are the two infamous [[dreadlord]]s that control the demons hereabouts.

The plans detail preparations for a demonic attack on [[Forest Song]] to the north; the location where a new draenei settlement is being established.

Perhaps [[Vindicator Vedaar]] at [[Forest Song]] would be interested in these?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1200 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with {{F|Exodar}}

==Progress==
What do you have there, sir?

==Completion==
By the Seven Crystals of Ata'mal, this cannot be!  They plan to attack us here at Forest Song?!

Not on my watch!

<Vindicator Vedaar crumples the demon-scrawled plans in his fist.>

No.  We will not allow this to happen!

==Progression==
