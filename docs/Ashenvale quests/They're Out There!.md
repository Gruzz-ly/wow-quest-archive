==Objectives==
[[Foreman Jinx|Jinx]] at [[Skunkworks|The Skunkworks]] wants you to kill 12 Ashenvale Assassins.
* [[Ashenvale Assassin]] slain (12)
* [[Jinx's Goggles]] (provided)

== Description ==
They're out there, <class>. And they're on to us.

Some of my men have begun turning up dead. Elf attacks, no question about it.

My guess is that your work at Astranaar has them desperate to stop our progress here. A last ditch effort to escape defeat!

Take these goggles. They'll help you see even the sneakiest of the elves. Keep them off my back while we finish weaponizing your explosives.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Weaponized Belt
|Backwatcher's Ring
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||18|}}
*2000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Progress ==
Have you eliminated the assassins, <class>?

== Completion ==
Nice work, friend.

Your skills have bought us the time we needed to prepare the bomb. It's almost complete!

== Notes ==
Upon accepting the quest, a green aura will tinge the screen, indicating the goggles' effect. The player gains the following buff:
{{Effecttip
|doc=
|etype=buff
|name=Jinx's Elf Detection Ray
|type=
|duration=60 min
|icon=inv_gizmo_newgoggles
|description=Detects hidden night elves in proximity to The Skunkworks.
|float= none
}}

If at any time the aura is lost (e.g., leaving the subzone), use the goggles in your inventory to re-apply the buff.

If a [[Silverwind Conquerer]] is nearby while the player is in combat with an assassin, the Conquerer will join in combat against the assassin.
