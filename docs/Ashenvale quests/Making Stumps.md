==Objectives==
[[Krokk]] wants you to use the Splintertree Axe to cut down the Ashenvale Oaks in [[Warsong Lumber Camp]].
*[[Ashenvale Oak]]s Chopped Down (5)
*[[Splintertree Axe]] (provided)

==Description==
As you've been told by now, we are to escort a [[Envoy Sheelah|diplomat]] from within the besieged lumber camp to safety.

As it stands, that's simply impossible. The [[Night elf|elves]] have a thousand arrows trained on the camp's exits.

First we must create a diversion - something that will take their eyes off of the camp for a time.

My idea is simple. Take this axe and cut down the trees they've been nurturing in the region.

When you're through, use the signal powder here to speak with me again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||14|}} 
*1750 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Were you able to chop down the enemy's trees, <class>?

==Completion==
Nice work, <name>.

You've demoralized the enemy and harvested resources for the [[Horde]].

Let's hope the rest of the mission goes as well.

==Trivia==
*In {{Expac|Cataclysm}}, the quest awarded reputation to the [[Warsong Offensive]].
