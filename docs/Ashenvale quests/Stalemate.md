==Objectives==
[[Thagg]] at [[Raynewood Retreat]] wants you to kill Keeper Ordanus.
*[[Keeper Ordanus]] slain

==Description==
The triage kits will help us keep up the fight, but we are at a stalemate.

The dryads die easy enough, but their leader is resurrecting them soon after they fall. We face an endless stream of the vermin!

Keeper Ordanus hides in that mutated tree. Our efforts to fight our way to him have been in vain. Perhaps you could work your way to him while we contend with his dryads...

Surely, this is child's play for someone who has conquered Astranaar. No?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1950 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Well, <race>? Is Ordanus defeated?

==Completion==
Very well, <name>.

You have succeeded where I could not. You have earned my respect. 

==Progression==

==Trivia==
*In {{Expac|Cataclysm}}, the quest awarded reputation to the [[Warsong Offensive]].
