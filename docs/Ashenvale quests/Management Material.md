==Objectives==
Convince [[Demoralized Peon]]s to work and collect 5 bundles of Freshly Cut Wood.
* [[Freshly Cut Wood]] (5)

==Description==
[[Truun]] needs wood, huh? Normally I could provide, but not today.

With constant [[Night elf|elf]] attacks, gathering lumber is dangerous work. The peons I have left are reluctant to venture into the woods.

You want wood? Then you go convince the peons to work.

And keep them safe! I cannot afford to lose any more!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Labor Camp Frock|Manager's Mantle|Hands of Encouragement|Gorka's Brass Shoulderguards}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||13|}}
*1650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Did you get the wood you need?

==Completion==
It seems you've solved one problem only to face another, <class>.
