==Objectives==
Speak with [[Gaivan Shadewalker]] pacing outside the entrance to the [[Dor'Danil Barrow Den]] in [[Ashenvale]].

==Description==
Now that the demon gates have been destroyed, the power of the forest must be replenished. The Forest Heart must be retrieved!

Gaivan Shadewalker, a powerful druid of the claw, has gone southwest, past Felfire Hill, to the Dor'Danil Barrow Den. Therein rests the Forest Heart. It is protected by the druids of Ashenvale deep below the ground.

Seek out Gaivan and tell him of what has transpired, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||13|}}
*1,650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Completion==
You are brave to come here, <class>, but you may be too late. All of the druids are either dead or have been driven insane.

Still, your tale is intriguing, and if what you say is true, then Gnarl must have the Forest Heart and soon, or Ashenvale will begin to wither!
