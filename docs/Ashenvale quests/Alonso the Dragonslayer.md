==Objectives==
Accompany [[Alonso]] to slay the [[dragon]].

==Description==
The time is upon us, <name>. I am adorned with armor befitting a true Dragonslayer! You have been of great assistance.

I should ask that you accompany me now, as my honorary squire, and watch me best the great dragon once and for all!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||18}}
*[[Rune of Raging Blow]]

==Completion==
I've done it <name>! At last my foe is defeated!

Oh the clash of fang and metal; of scale and blade. What peril, what thrill! And through it all, I arise a champion.

Let us not forget your humble contribution as well! Without the armor you retrieved, I surely would not have bested the fiend.

You have been an excellent squire, <name>. Perhaps, one day, you too shall walk the glorious path of a [[knight]].

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Alonso|Come, squire, my moment of triumph is at hand!}}

Follow him through the [[Talondeep Path]] and protect him from the wildlife that attacks:
:{{Text|say|Alonso|Show yourself, o' mighty dragon!!}}

Eventually, a [[Green Dragon Whelp]] attacks:
:{{Text|say|Alonso|Squire! I am in need of aid!}}

;Whelp killed
:{{Text|say|Alonso|Huzzah! The great dragon is slain{{sic}}}}
