==Objectives==
Slay Harbinger Aphotic.
*{{NPC||Harbinger Aphotic}} slain

==Description==
When I sensed these... [[Tendril from Below|thing]]s... rising from below, I came to put them back down. I found the corpse of {{NPC||Teronis||your friend}} and dragged him as far as I could before one of my fetlocks was broken. It is all that I can do to hold off these foul tendrils.

There is one that controls the tendrils and eyes. It calls itself Harbinger Aphotic -- I'm sure that you have heard it yelling from the south.

The harbinger stands out of range of my magic, but you could get to him. If you dare....

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ablution Slippers
|Somber Treads
|Heartwise Boon
|Somber Boots
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|30}}
* 1,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
The harbinger yet lives, <name>. I cannot begin to cleanse [[Lake Falathim]] until it is slain.

==Completion==
With the death of the harbinger, I can begin to cleanse the lake.

You have my deepest thanks, <name>. I mourn the loss of your friend, but know that his remains will fuel the reclamation of the forest hereabouts. 

==Progression==
