==Objectives==
Report the existence of [[The Bomb]] to [[Huntress Jalin]] at [[Stardust Spire]] in [[Ashenvale]].

==Description==
This is clearly the biggest explosive that you've ever laid eyes upon. What in the world could the [[goblin]]s be thinking about bombing with such a monstrosity?

To your eye the thing looks like it's almost complete. The goblins appear to have built it well -- it looks as if it's impervious to any damage that you could do to it, and certainly too big for you to carry out of here.

You'd better report The Bomb to Huntress Jalin at Stardust Spire to the southwest!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||18|}}
*2,000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
They what? IT'S HOW BIG?!!!

I have a very bad feeling about this, <name>.

==Notes==
After turning in:
:{{text|say|Stardust Sentinel|Huntress, there! What is that!?}}
:''A goblin hot air balloon carrying [[The Bomb]] floats by the camp, into [[Stonetalon Mountains]].''
:{{text|say|Huntress Jalin|I... is that it over there, <name>? This land is doomed if the Horde manages to set that off.}}
