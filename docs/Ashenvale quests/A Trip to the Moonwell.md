==Objectives==
Take the Tear of Elune and cleanse it in the waters of the [[Moonwell of Purity]] in [[Ashenvale]].
*Tear of Elune cleansed.
*[[Elune's Tear (2)]] (provided)

==Description==
It didn't work.

<A sorrowful and resigned expression upon his face, [[Pelturas Whitemoon|Pelturas]] removes the [[Elune's Tear|tear]] from the soup and gently washes it.>

The eruption of [[Thunder Peak]] must have affected it in some way. You must take the tear to the Moonwell of Purity, which still lies intact, protected by [[Elune|the goddess]]' power, at the southeast base of the volcano.

There, you will wash it in the sacred waters of Elune. What happens beyond that, I cannot say. I fear for [[Relara Whitemoon|my daughter]]'s life. It is in your hands now, <name>. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|0}} (or {{coppercost|540}} at max level)
*925 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Completion==
<Dousing the tear within the moonwell, the waters begin to glow and churn with startling activity.>

==Notes==
*The Moonwell of Purity can be found at the eastern edge of Thunder Peak{{coords|53|46|Ashenvale}}, attended by [[Blink Dragon]]s.
