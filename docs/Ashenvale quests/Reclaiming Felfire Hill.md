==Objectives==
Plant 8 Tree Seedlings in the [[Fertile Dirt Mound]]s.
*Tree Seedling Planted (8)
*[[Tree Seedlings]] (provided)

==Description==
Little one, to the southwest is an area of [[Nightsong Woods]] that has in recent times come to be called [[Felfire Hill]]. It is very sad to see the [[demon]]s crawling over it, spreading their corruption.

Would you do something to help take back the land?

I have a number of seeds that I have been saving for such a purpose. Take them to Felfire Hill and plant them in the fertile dirt mounds.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||13}}
*1,650 [[XP]] 
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Surely you have not yet planted all of my seeds?

==Completion==
Good. Though it may take a great deal of your years for the seedlings to grow into ancients, in the fullness of time they will aid us in our fight against all of the enemies of Ashenvale.

==Progression==

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Text slightly updated to reflect [[Gnarl]] moving from [[Forest Song]] to the [[Warsong Lumber Camp]], completion text shortened.}}
*{{Patch 2.0.1|note=Added.}}
