==Description==
Thank you for saving me from a fate worse than death, <name>! For saving both the [[Relara Whitemoon|child]] and myself!

Well, the child is almost saved. All you have to do is take the moonstones back west down the road to Astranaar. Hand them to [[Pelturas Whitemoon|Pelturas]] and he will know what to do.

Go in peace, my friend. [[Elune]] be praised!

==Progress==
<Name>, is that you? Have you returned with the cure for Relara?

==Completion==
Oh, <name>, you have saved my daughter! I know the power of the moonstones will give back my daughter her strength!
