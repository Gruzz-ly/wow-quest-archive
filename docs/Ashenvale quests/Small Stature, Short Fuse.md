==Objectives==
Use the Improvised Explosive Stick on the [[Broken-down Wagon]] at [[Hellscream's Watch]].
*Broken Wagon exploded
*[[Tweedle's Improvised Explosive]] (provided)

==Description==
<As [[Tweedle]] gesticulates emphatically, you see that his gloves are unusually loose.>

I've done it! This should satisfy even [[Captain Goggath|Goggath]]!

We just need a test that will sufficiently show off our efforts... ahh - the wagon!

The bossman's wanted that rotted out piece of junk hauled off for days. Use my explosives to get rid of it, then see what the captain has to say!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*460 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
What have you done, <race>?

==Completion==
So, Tweedle found a way to get those explosives working, eh?

It's about time...

==Trivia==
*In {{g|cata}}, the quest rewarded reputation to the [[Warsong Offensive]].
*The quest was originally named '''Small Hands, Short Fuse'''.
