==Objectives==
Create a Bathed Concoction.
*[[Bathed Concoction]]
*[[Unbathed Concoction]] (provided)

==Description==
The concoction is not quite complete; it must be bathed within the Light of [[Elune]] before we can even think about giving it to the child.

There is a known location just to the west at [[Lake Falathim]] where the goddess's [[moonlight]] always touches down, day or night. Please, <name>, I implore you for the sake of [[Relara Whitemoon|Relara]], take the concoction and bathe it in Elune's radiance.

But beware, strange things have befallen the area of the lake, and I fear that it is no longer safe to go there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|1300}} (or {{coppercost|1020}} at max level)
*1650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Progress==
Did you have any trouble getting to the Light of Elune at Lake Falathim?

==Completion==
With the concoction blessed by the Light of Elune, it should be ready for delivery to [[Astranaar]].

There is no time to waste, <name>!

==Notes==
*The moon-bathed area can be found at the western edge of Lake Falathim{{coords|18|41|Ashenvale}}.
