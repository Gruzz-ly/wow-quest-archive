*[[Splintertree Post Report]] (provided)

== Description ==
No reports have made it out of here since the beginning of the siege on [[Splintertree Post|Splintertree]]. By now, Commander Grimfang must be getting anxious.

I am sending you to Zoram Strand to deliver our report. It's not pretty, but at least he'll have the facts.

Speak to [[Vhulgra]] when you're ready to make the trip.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|s=11}}
*1,300 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

This is grim news, indeed.

May the spirits preserve them until we can fight our way to Splintertree....
