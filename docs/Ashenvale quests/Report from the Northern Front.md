==Objectives==
Deliver [[Sentinel Melyria Frostshadow|Sentinel Melyria]]'s report to [[Sentinel Farsong]] at [[Silverwing Grove]] in [[Ashenvale]].
*[[Sentinel Melyria's Report]] (provided)

==Description==
The battle against the [[Horde]] isn't being waged from [[Raynewood Tower]] alone, <name>. There's a more substantial Silverwing Sentinel presence at Silverwing Grove to the southeast, near the border with the Barrens. From the grove, Sentinel Farsong directs our efforts against those who would destroy our lands.

I'm a bit late in sending my latest report to her, but also hesitant to leave the tower unattended.

I am in dire need of your help in getting this report to her as soon as possible!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*510 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Silverwing Sentinels]]

==Progress==
What's that you have there, <class>?

==Completion==
Thank you for delivering this report, <class>. From what Sentinel Melyria writes, it seems our worst fears have come to pass. With each advance we make, the Horde appears more determined to do as much damage as possible.

We can't afford to back down; the fate of our ancestral lands hangs in the balance. With more people like you on the frontlines, I'm certain we could triumph.

Will you join our fight? A new front has just opened in Warsong Gulch to the south.
