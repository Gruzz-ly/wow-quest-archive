==Objectives==
Use the Medicated Salve on 5 Wounded Mor'shan Defenders.
*[[Wounded Mor'shan Defender]]s Rescued (5)
*[[Medicated Salve]] (provided)

==Description==
Our forces are holding up admirably, <class>.

Be that as it may, there are yet wounded to attend to - many still in the field of battle.

I have created a salve that should grant the wounded enough energy to return to the ramparts for treatment. Please administer it to any in need before they become lost to us. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Leggings of the Traveling Medic
|Halfmoon Gloves
|First Responder's Pauldrons
|Battlefield Medic Handguards
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||10|15}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progression==
Have you administered the salve to our fallen warriors, <race>?

==Completion==
Thank you, <race>. I shall include your service to the [[Horde]] in my report.

I should have these troops fit to fight again in no time!
