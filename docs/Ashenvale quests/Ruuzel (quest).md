==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Ruuzel Cataclysm.jpg|Ruuzel|She has the Ring of Zoram!}}
Obtain the Ring of Zoram.
*[[Ring of Zoram]]

==Description==
I fear the ancient statuette's secrets will remain forever hidden unless you find the key to their ancient locks.

That key is a ring, the Ring of Zoram. It belonged to the rulers of this city before the waves of the Sundering drowned it.

For years the ring was lost, but the naga have recently found it.

Their leader, [[Ruuzel]], dwells on her isle on the northern edge of the [[Zoram Strand]]. Please, <name>, retrieve the ring for me!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|3000}} (or {{coppercost|1320}} at max level)
* 2200 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]
*[[Robes of Antiquity]]

==Progress==
It is said that the Ring of Zoram is the key to any lock within the city. Do you have it, <name>?

==Completion==
You found the ring! Thank you, <name>.

Please take this as payment, and know that your deeds today will remain forever in my memory.

==Progression==
{{West to the Strand}}
