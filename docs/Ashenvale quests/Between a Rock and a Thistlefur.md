==Objectives==
[[Karang Amakkar]] at Hellscream's Watch wants you to take down any 15 Thistlefur furbolg in [[Thistlefur Village]].
*Thistlefur Village Furbolgs killed (15)

==Description==
The Thistlefur furbolgs are threatening our expansion! Thistlefur Village to our west blocks the way between us here and the Splintertree Post. It's a path that would circumvent the village of Astranaar; without it, we give the Alliance an extra expansion path.

<name>, we must not allow... an expansion path gap!

Proceed to Thistlefur Village and thin out the furbolgs. You will be given compensation for this task, but more importantly you will be doing your duty for the Horde!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||15}}
*1850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Have you taken the fight to the Thistlefur? With a clear path between our bases, our chances of claiming the whole of Ashenvale increase dramatically.

==Completion==
Well done <class>, well done!  I will continue to send forces to thin out the furbolg, but I can at least count on a different path that will be free of Alliance entanglements.  The Horde conquest of Ashenvale is now in full swing!

You've earned your pay this day, hero.  I salute you!
