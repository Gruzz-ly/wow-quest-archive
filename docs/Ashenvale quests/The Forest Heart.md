Down at the bottom of the [[Dor'Danil Barrow Den]] it sits, corrupted by the [[Horde]]. Only Gnarl can cleanse it.

In order to move it, though, you'll need a [[:Power of Nature]]. If you collect enough untainted spirits from the [[Severed Druid|Severed druids]] and [[Severed Keeper|keepers]], the spirits can be combined into a Power of Nature.

Good luck, <name>!
