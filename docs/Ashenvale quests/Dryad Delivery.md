==Objectives==
Deliver the Glowing Gem to [[Shael'dryn]] at [[Raynewood Tower]] in [[Ashenvale]].
*[[Glowing Gem]] (provided)

==Description==
Ah, there you are, <name>. I've pored over the notes Teronis has made and it sounds like your next course of action is to find the other pieces of Dartol's rod.

I would start by heading east along the road to Raynewood Tower.

A dryad there named Shael'dryn is better suited to guide you. Seek her out.

Keep the gem with you--Shael'dryn will need it if she's to help you recreate the rod.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*920 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Progress==
Hello. How are you?

==Completion==
Oh, Raene sent you? It must be serious indeed.

What can I help you with?

==Progression==
{{Dartol's Rod quest chain}}
