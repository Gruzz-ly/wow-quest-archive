==Description==
As you search through the belongings of the dead [[furbolg]] lying before you, a small charm, very obviously created by [[troll]]s, spills out onto the ground.

Touching the charm, you immediately get a sense that something is not right about the wood. A feeling of unease, of corruption, permeates the object.

Wrapping it in some spare cloth, you put it in your pack and resolve to show it to [[Raene Wolfrunner]] when next you find yourself in [[Astranaar]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||15|}}
*1,850 [[XP]]
*+260 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
What's troubling you, <class>?

==Completion==
A troll charm? What are the furbolg doing with such a thing?

You're right, it does have a feeling of corruption about it... even I can sense that.

There's someone here who might be able to help.

==Progression==
