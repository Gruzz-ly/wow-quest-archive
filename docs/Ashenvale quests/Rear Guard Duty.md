==Objectives==
Slay any 10 [[furbolg]] at the [[Ruins of Ordil'Aran]].
*Furbolg at Ruins of Ordil'Aran slain (10)

==Description==
The [[Moon Priestess Maestra|moon priestess]] has a plan to make sure that no further furbolg descend upon us from the highlands. I am more concerned with those that are already at the ruins, some of which are massing just outside of the post.

Distasteful as it may be, I must ask that you head north into the Ruins of Ordil'Aran and slay the furbolg. We cannot fight on two fronts!

Thank you, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|1300}} (or {{coppercost|1020}} at max level)
*1650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Progress==
Ordil'Aran was a night elf city once long ago. It fell to ruins during the [[Great Sundering|Sundering]] and only recently had some [[Cult of the Dark Strand|outsiders]] moved in to pillage it.

Now they are dead, victims of their own curiosity that attracted the furbolg down upon them.

==Completion==
We are in your debt, <class>. If I know anything about the furbolg, they do not like their noses bloodied.

It won't be long now before they tuck tail and return to their [[Thistlefur Village|village]].

==Notes==
*The furbolg at the ruins are from the [[Thistlefur tribe]], and consist of [[Thistlefur Warrior]]s and [[Thistlefur Wise One]]s.
*Complete this quest along with [[The Reason Why]] from [[Moon Priestess Maestra]].
