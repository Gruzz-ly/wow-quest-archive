# Ashenvale storyline

[[File:WorldMap-Ashenvale.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]
[[Ashenvale]] is a level 20-25 [[contested]] zone in northern [[Kalimdor]], directly between the [[Alliance]] zone of [[Darkshore]] and the [[Horde]] zones of [[Azshara]] and [[Northern Barrens]]. With its location between one Alliance zone, two Horde zones and two contested zones, many of the quests directly involve the conflict between the factions.

The progress of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Ashenvale Quests]].

==Alliance==
===Relara Whitemoon quest chain===
This quest chain starts at [[Orendil's Retreat]] and spans much of the early zone, going through quest givers at [[Maestra's Post]], [[Astranaar]], and [[Raynewood Tower]]. In it, players are trying to heal the young night elf Relara Whitemoon at the bequest of the elf Orendil Broadleaf. He and his apprentices have players collect the leaves of the ancient [[Bathran]] and then sanctify them in the moonlight. When that doesn't work, players seek out Elune's Tear and purify it in a moonwell - however in return they are asked to redeem the satyr [[Avrus Illwhisper]]. Upon completing this task, the young night elf is healed.

{{Relara Whitemoon quest chain}}

===Blackfathom Camp===
Players are sent here from [[Orendil's Retreat]] to investigate the Naga presence in the area.

{{West to the Strand}}

===Maestra's Post===
[[Sentinel Onaeya]] sends players out to repel the Horde's forces attacking Maestra's Post:
#[[A Squad of Your Own]]
#[[Respect for the Fallen]]

[[Liladris Moonriver]] and [[Moon Priestess Maestra]] have players clear out the Furbolg attacking the ruins behind the post:
*[[Rear Guard Duty]] / [[The Reason Why]]

After completing the other quests, [[Sentinel Avana]] offers [[Astranaar Bound]], taking the player to Astranaar, the main city in Ashenvale.

===Dartol's Rod quest chain===
This quest chain starts at [[Maestra's Post]] and spans much of the zone. It requires the completion of the Relara Whitemoon quest chain up to and including [[Bathed in Light]]. In this quest chain, players recreate the mysterious Dartol's Rod with the help of the Dryad Shael'dryn at [[Raynewood Retreat]], then use it to incite an uprising of the Horde's captured Furbolg at the bequest of the escaped Furbolg [[Krolg]].

{{Dartol's Rod quest chain}}

===Astranaar===
When the player first enters Astranaar, it is on fire, under attack from [[Watch Wind Rider]]s. [[Sentinel Thenysil]] sends players to resist this attack:
#[[Astranaar's Burning!]]
#[[Return Fire (quest)]]

Completing these two quests phases the fires and attackers out.

[[Vindicator Palanaar]] sends players to [[Forest Song]] via [[A Helping Hand (Ashenvale)]].

[[Raene Wolfrunner]] starts a quest to clear out the Furbolg, but soon finds that they were intentionally set against Astranaar by the Trolls. In the process players meet Hephaestus Pilgrim, who sends them to his sister Sabina at the nearby volcano. The volcano is being controlled by Lord Magmathar and with the help of the other three elements (earth, water, wind), players defeat him.
{{Culling the Furbolg Threat}}

[[Faldreas Goeth'Shael]] sends players to find his friends the Edunes and while doing so, players help prevent a demonic attack on Ashenvale together with the Ancient [[Big Baobob]].
{{Check in on the Edunes}}

===Forest Song===
The quests here involve fighting satyr in the two camps west of Forest Song, [[Satyrnaar]] and [[Xavian]].

[[Architect Nemos]] and [[Kayneth Stillwind]] start the Satyrnaar quests, collecting the ancient artifact the Chalice of Elune from there:
* [[A Shameful Waste]] / [[The Lost Chalice]]

[[Illiyana]] starts the Xavian quests, retrieving the Branch of Cenarius and slaying the Satyr present in the area:
{{Vile Satyr! Dryads in Danger!}}

[[A Shameful Waste]] is turned in to [[Gnarl]] at the [[Warsong Lumber Camp]], letting the player proceed there.

===Warsong Lumber Camp===
[[Sentinel Luciel Starwhisper]] and [[Gnarl]] start the Horde chain, destroying the Lumber Camp with the help of the Horde's conveniently-placed explosive barrels:

{{Agents of Destruction}}

[[Vindicator Vedaar]] and Gnarl start the Legion chain, which then unlocks the Dor'Danil Barrow Den chain. In it, players fight against the forces of the Burning Legion being pulled in through portals in the area. While fighting, they discover the Legion's intention to invade Forest Song and put a stop to those plans. Then players head into the Dor'Danil Barrow Den to retrieve the Forest Heart so Gnarl may purify it of the Horde's corruption.

{{Reclaiming Felfire Hill}}

Return to Astranaar to get to the final part of the Ashenvale experience.

===Raynewood Tower===
Players come to Raynewood Tower on [[He Who Would Be Forgiven]] and [[Dryad Delivery]] along larger quest chains. There is also a small self-contained quest chain here, defending the Raynewood Tower from Horde attackers.

{{Recover the Fallen}}

===Stardust Spire===
This chain starts at [[Sentinel Thenysil]] in [[Astranaar]]. It concludes the Ashenvale storyline for the Alliance and moves on to the next zone, [[Stonetalon Mountains]].

In addition, [[Sentinel Velene Starstrike]] offers [[Rebels Without a Clue]], a breadcrumb to the [[Northern Stranglethorn storyline]], should the player prefer to continue questing in the Eastern Kingdoms.

This storyline features players investigating the Goblin Skunkworks and finding a massive bomb, appropriately called [[The Bomb]]. It is later carried onwards into the Stonetalon Mountains.

{{Stardust Spire quest chain}}

During [[Do Yourself a Favor]], the player briefly enters the [[Stonetalon Mountains]] zone, but with no way down further forward except by jumping down the cliff. The player then "officially" proceeds into that zone with [[Hellscream's Legacy]], and the quest chain continues into the [[Stonetalon Mountains storyline]].
