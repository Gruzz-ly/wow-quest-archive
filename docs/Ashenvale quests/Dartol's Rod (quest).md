==Objectives==
Use Dartol's Rod to be able to communicate with [[Krolg]] at [[Krolg's Hut]] in [[Ashenvale]].
*[[Dartol's Rod]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm not completely certain what [[Teronis]] had in mind next, but if what he said was true about the rod's power, then it will allow you to take on another form altogether, presumably that of a furbolg.

Perhaps he meant to use its powers to get closer to them, but even the uncorrupted creatures would slaughter him were he not careful. Transformed by the rod, Dartol would have to speak to a furbolg who was uncorrupted.

I would start with one known as Krolg. Seek his hut southeast of [[Mystral Lake]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,500 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Completion==
Yes, yes... you appear as one of my kind, but I care not what you truly are if you can help the furbolg.

The night elves and now the orcs have visited many atrocities upon my people.

Corruption runs through our veins, corruption brought down upon us by the prideful night elves and the warlike orcs. They are the ones who did this to our people... They are the ones I blame for being cast out of my tribe.

At night I can still see the campfires burning in the darkness.
