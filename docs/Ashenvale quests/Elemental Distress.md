==Objectives==
Collect motes of elemental rage, and bring them to [[Je'neu Sancrea]] at [[Zoram'gar Outpost]], {{C|Ashenvale}}.
*[[Mote of Seismic Rage]]
*[[Mote of Infernal Rage]]
*[[Mote of Torrential Rage]]

==Description==
Listen, <name>. The corruption I spoke of before goes beyond [[Baron Aquanis]]. I've been sensing a certain unease within the [[elemental]] world for some time. I fear something is gravely wrong, and the corruption of Baron Aquanis only furthers my suspicions.

Find more of those elementals who are suffering: here in Ashenvale, and in the nearby {{C|Stonetalon Mountains}}. Bring me motes of their essence. Perhaps I can analyze them, and begin to understand the nature of their rage.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||18}}
* 2000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The elementals suffer greatly, <name>. I must know why.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Hopefully these will provide some answers.

==Progression==
{{Elemental Distress}}
