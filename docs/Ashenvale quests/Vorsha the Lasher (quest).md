This is an escort quest in which the player must protect [[Muglash]] as he draws out and defeats [[Vorsha the Lasher]], a [[hydra]].

==Objectives==
Defeat Vorsha the Lasher.
*Defeat Vorsha the Lasher
*Suggested players: 2
*Speak to the Warsong Runner in Zoram'gar Outpost.

== Description ==
Vorsha the Lasher... the fiendish hydra that roams the seas...

She has attacked our [[Zoram'gar Outpost|outpost]], each time unprovoked, laying waste to anything that falls in her path.

But I am ready, <name>. I have prepared to best the hydra and end these attacks on Zoram'gar.

The [[naga]] honor the wicked nature of this beast with a brazier that remains lit on an island just off the coast. I believe that if we put it out, Vorsha will appear in anger.

We will need help, so be sure to bring some strong allies.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive
|Horn Ring}}

==Completion==
I have witnessed many naga attacks since I arrived here. It puts my mind at ease that Vorsha will no longer roam freely.

We are in your debt, <name>.

== Notes ==
Muglash will set off as soon as the quest is accepted, so be prepared to escort him.

Muglash will help you out in this fight. Two or three waves of [[naga]], and finally Vorsha itself, will spawn and must be killed. If Muglash dies, the quest will fail.

:{{text|say|Muglash|Are you sure that you are ready? If we do not have a group of your allies to aid us, we will surely fail.}}
:{{text|say|Muglash|This will be a tough fight, <name>. Follow me closely!}}
:(''Muglash walks out of Zoram'gar and towards the sea. If there are any naga, he will help fight. He will end up at the brazier''{{coords|9|27|Ashenvale}}.)
:{{text|say|Muglash|This is the brazier, <name>. Put it out. Vorsha is a beast, worthy of praise from no one!}}
:(''Player clicks on brazier to put it out''.)
:{{text|say|Muglash|Now we must wait. It won't be long before the naga realize what we have done.}}
:{{text|say|Muglash|Be on your guard, <name>!}}
:(''A wave of three naga attack''.)
:{{text|say|Muglash|Perhaps we will get a moment to rest. But I will not give up until we have faced off against Vorsha!}}
:(''Another wave of three naga''.)
:{{text|say|Muglash|Be on your guard, <name>!}}
:(''Another wave of three naga''.)
:{{text|say|Muglash|I sense that the great beast draws near...}}
:{{text|say|Muglash|Look, just at the water's surface!}}
:(''Muglash and player face off against Vorsha''.)
:{{text|say|Muglash|We have done it!}}
:{{text|say|Muglash|You have my deepest gratitude. I thank you.}}
:{{text|say|Muglash|I am going to patrol the area for a while longer and ensure that things are truly safe.}}
:{{text|say|Muglash|Please return to Zoram'gar and report our success to the Warsong Runner.}}
