==Objectives==
Speak with [[Architect Nemos]] at [[Forest Song]] in [[Ashenvale]].

[[Vindicator Palanaar]] can offer you a ride to get you there more swiftly.

==Description==
My people have undertaken an important endeavor in the eastern part of Ashenvale, with support and cooperation from the kaldorei.
Under the supervision of [[Architect Nemos]] and Vindicator Vedaar, they are revitalizing an old night elf outpost. The task of building won't be easy, &lt;name&gt;, for the challenges and enemies they face are many. I know [[Architect Nemos]] and his compatriots at Forest Song would appreciate any help they can get, and he has asked me to send any interested &lt;men/women&gt; his way.

Speak to me again and I will arrange for fast transport for you to their location.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*830 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Completion==
It's good to see another new arrival here at Forest Song.

Vindicator Palanaar is sending as much help as she can muster and each set of hands is appreciated.

Take a look around, &lt;class&gt;. It may not be much now, but with time and help from our night elf allies, we'll build a settlement worthy of calling home. There is much to be done here and any help you can provide would be welcome. 

== Notes ==
Speak to Palanaar to mount [[Palanaar's Elekk]]. It's a long ride across almost the entire zone, so make sure to pick up [[flight path]]s at both Astranaar and Forest Song.
