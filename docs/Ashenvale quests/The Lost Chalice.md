==Objectives==
Obtain the Chalice of Elune.
*[[Chalice of Elune]]

==Description==
The area to our west, now called [[Satyrnaar]], was once a prominent shrine built by [[Night elf|my people]]. It housed a priceless relic, the Chalice of Elune, entrusted to the shrine's keepers by the [[Priestess of the Moon|priests of Elune]]. Pilgrims once traveled to the shrine to experience the healing powers the chalice was rumored to hold.

These stories might be nothing but old wives' tales, but if there is any truth to them, the relic may hold the key to rejuvenating the wounded forest. I must know, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||10|15}}
*1,000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Can you feel it, <name>, the touch of corruption upon the wind? If we do nothing, it will continue to advance. That is why I seek the Chalice of Elune. Were you able to find it?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. There is certainly a latent power here, one that not even constant exposure to the corruption of the satyr can dim.

Do you see how it still shines, after all these years?
