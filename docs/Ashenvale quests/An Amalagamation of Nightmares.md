==Objectives==
Seek out [[Loganaar]] in [[Moonglade]]

==Description==
The dread aura you experienced emanates not from a place, but from a creature. A particularly deadly creature of darkness, a twisted shadow reflection of the worst aspects of [[Azeroth|our world]], coalesced into an amalgamation of pure nightmare. I can't explain how I know this but I... dreamt of it. Or rather, it was shown to me. It's difficult to explain. Please, go to Moonglade and speak with the [[druid]] Loganaar. There may still be time to stop it before it gets even more powerful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||75}}
*4700 XP

==Progress==
Yes, <class>?

==Completion==
This is most dire news. If it is as Hannalah said, the current crisis in the dream is about to get much worse.

==Notes==
This quest is only available after speaking to [[Field Captain Hannalah]] while under the effects of the {{abilities|Aura of Paralyzing Dread|id=446091|icon=spell_shadow_deathscream}}. This debuff is obtained by entering the portal at [[Bough Shadow]] during a [[Nightmare Incursion]] and then traveling south of the [[Warsong Lumber Camp]]. The debuff will be applied when in the vicinity of the [[Nightmare Amalgamation (Season of Discovery)|Nightmare Amalgamation]].
