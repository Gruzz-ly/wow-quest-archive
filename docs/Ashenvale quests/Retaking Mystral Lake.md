==Objectives==
Slay 12 Befouled Water Elementals and Tideress.
*[[Befouled Water Elemental]] slain (12)
*[[Tideress]] slain

==Description==
We could easily have held [[Silverwind Refuge]] from the [[Horde]] had they not taken control of our [[water elemental]] defenders on [[Mystral Lake]].

One of their shaman summoned in Tideress, an old and angry water spirit of the forest who befouled our elementals and turned them against us. With the lake and the Horde pressing in on us, we had no choice but to retreat to the spire here.

Go east. Take the lake back so that we will have a chance to retake the refuge some day.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||20|}}
*2,100 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
Well done, <name>! With the befouled elemental numbers thinned and Tideress put back into the lake, we should be able to launch a counter-offensive on Silverwind Refuge.

Just as soon as we're done with defending the spire....
