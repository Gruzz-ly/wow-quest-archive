'''Culling the Furbolg Threat''' is part of the [[Ashenvale storyline]].

==Objectives==
Slay any 15 [[furbolg]] at [[Thistlefur Village]] in [[Ashenvale]].
*Thistlefur Village furbolgs killed (15)

==Description==
Directly to the north of [[Astranaar]] are the Thistlefur furbolg.  My scouts report that their numbers have grown greatly over the past few months.  If they grow too great, they may find the courage to attack Astranaar directly!

Go to Thistlefur Village and kill as many of their kind as you can.

I shall remain here in Astranaar and await word from you. [[Elune]] be with you, <class>. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|0|15|0}}
*1850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Progress==
I just received a report that their numbers are still quite high.

Please head back north, <class>, and finish the job.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>.

We are under constant threat from the furbolg.  Hopefully this will keep them at bay for a bit longer.

==Notes==
Kill [[Thistlefur Shaman]], [[Thistlefur Avenger]]s and [[Thistlefur Pathfinder]]s.
