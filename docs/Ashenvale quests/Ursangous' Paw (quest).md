This quest begins with a drop from [[Ursangous]], a level 24 bear which patrols the area west of [[Silverwind Refuge]].

==Objectives==
Bring Ursangous' Paw to [[Captain Tarkan]] at [[Silverwind Refuge]].
*[[Ursangous' Paw]] (provided)

==Description==
The mighty bear Ursangous is no more!

The small quarter-crescent emblem on its paw indicates that this beast was trained by the night elves to prowl the forest in search of their enemies. There is no telling how many of your Horde allies fell to this creature.

The paw should be brought to Tarkan at Silverwind Refuge. He will be pleased that such a weapon has been removed from the enemy's arsenal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||17|}}
*1950 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
What is it, <race>?

==Completion==
The paw of Ursangous!

Have you any idea what trouble this beast has caused us over the years? Those days are over now, thanks to you.

I shall forward this trophy on to [[Orgrimmar]] to be put on display, along with your account of its death.

Congratulations!

==Notes==
*In ''Cataclysm'', the quest awarded reputation to the [[Warsong Offensive]], but it was changed to [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]] at some point.
