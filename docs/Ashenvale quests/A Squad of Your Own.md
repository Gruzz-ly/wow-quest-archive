==Objectives==
Use a squad of [[Maestra's Post Sentinel]]s to destroy 3 Ashenvale Wreckers and slay 10 Horde Invaders.
*[[Ashenvale Wrecker]]s destroyed (3)
*[[Horde Invader]]s slain (10)

==Description==
I certainly hope that you're here to help, <name>. The situation is as dire as it appears. To put it quite simply, we are losing!

My girls and I are the last line of defense against the Horde, but we're not going to get out of this one without taking the fight to them. Up for a challenge?

I have a small squad of sentinels that I can loan to you. Get them close and I'm certain that their magic arrows can destroy those wreckers and invaders.

Speak to me again if you need replacements.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|1300}} (or {{coppercost|1020}} at max level)
*1650 [[XP]]
*250 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
That's not nearly enough, <class>.  We're about to lose our ground her and when that happens, it's all over for this section of the forest.

We must hold the line here!

==Completion==
I'd received a report about you from some of my scouts out in the forest but I had no idea how capable you are!

Thank you, <name>. With what you've accomplished the tide is turned. I've no doubt now that we'll route them by the end of the day!

==Notes==
Speaking with Sentinel Onaeya
: Just let me know when you're ready to take a squad out.
: I'm holding some in reserve, so if you need a few more, come back.
:{{gossip|It's rough out there.  I need some replacements, Sentinel Onaeya.}}
