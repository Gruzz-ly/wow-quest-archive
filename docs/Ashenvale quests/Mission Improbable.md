==Objectives==
Kadrak wants you to use the Secret Signal Powder on the [[Smoldering Brazier]] across from [[Satyrnaar]].
*Smoldering Brazier lit
*[[Secret Signal Powder]] (provided)
*Speak with Krokk at the Smoldering Brazier across from Satyrnaar.

==Description==
I have a special mission that requires a well equipped, competent <class>. As I have no one else to spare, I suppose I'll have to settle for you...

The enemy has assaulted [[Warsong Lumber Camp]] and cut it off from the rest of our forces. An important [[Envoy Sheelah|blood elf diplomat]] en route to [[Orgrimmar]] is trapped there.

She must be liberated.

Take the road northeast and pour this powder into the smoldering brazier to summon our operative there. Do whatever he might require of you.

Dismissed!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||7|}} 
*870 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
You have your work cut out for you here, friend.

Let's hope that you're up to the task,,,,{{sic}}
