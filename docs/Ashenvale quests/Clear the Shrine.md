==Objectives==
Slay any 12 demons at Fire Scar Shrine.  
*[[Demon]]s at [[Fire Scar Shrine]] slain (12)

==Description==
An end must be put to the [[Burning Legion]]'s evil!

<Name>, you have defeated one of their most powerful, but there are still multitudes of demons infesting the woods to the east in Fire Scar Shrine.

As a friend of the forest, will you slay these foul creatures and then warn [[Big Baobob]], the great [[ancient of war]] at the Shrine of Aessina to the northeast?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||18}}
*2,000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
There are yet more demons at Fire Scar Shrine that must be dealt with lest my battle here become hopeless, friend <race>.

==Completion==
A fine job, my little <race> friend. But as you can see, I am a little busy here.

==Notes==
The following demons give credit for the quest: [[Lesser Felguard]]s, [[Felslayer]]s, and [[Akkrilus]].
