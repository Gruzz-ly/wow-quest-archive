==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Kaliva.jpg|Kaliva|Foul demon dominatrix. Get her heart!}}
Obtain [[Kaliva]]'s Heart. 
*[[Heart of Kaliva]]

==Description==
<Name>, you must be cautious. Kaliva is still about and when she captured us, she specifically mentioned your name.

Only her heart can free us from these chains, but I think it's all a trap for you!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||20}}
*2,100 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
If we are to be free, we must have Kaliva's heart.

==Completion==
Disgusting, I know, but if we three are to be free of Kaliva's chains, it is not enough that she is dead.

We must eat of her fel heart!

==Notes==
On accept, [[Kaliva]] spawns at the entrance to the camp.
:{{text|yell|Kaliva|Ahahahaha, you've fallen into my trap, <name>!}}

Before the objective is completed, Bolyun has quest-specific gossip:
{{dialogue|
Beware, <name>!

{{Gossip|Bolyun, is Kariva{{sic}} still about?}}
{{dialogue-child|
Yes, look out behind you, <name>!
