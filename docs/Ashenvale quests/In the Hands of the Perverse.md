==Objectives==
Obtain 5 Fallen Moonstones.
*[[Fallen Moonstone]] (5)

==Description==
My former clan, the [[Felmusk]] of [[Night Run]], raided [[Fallen Sky Lake]] some time ago, stealing the moonstones that were unique to the area.

Those moonstones are known to have great healing properties and surely can be used to cure the little girl that lies sick in [[Astranaar]].

Night Run rests up the road to the east that runs north. There are multiple paths that lead up into the hills on its eastern side, and it is there that you will find my unrepentant brethren. They will have what you seek.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|1500}} (or {{coppercost|1140}} at max level)
*1850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Five moonstones are required to assure that the girl is healed.

==Completion==
You have all of the moonstones that are needed. And yet, it is said that a sacrifice of life is the only way to ensure the saving of another.

I will ensure that no matter what, the moonstones will cure [[Relara Whitemoon|Relara]].
