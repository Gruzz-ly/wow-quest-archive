==Objectives==
[[Draaka]] in [[Splintertree]] wants you to fill the Reinforced Canister with 7 Felfires from [[Felfire Hill]].
*Fel Fires Siphoned (7)
*[[Reinforced Canister]] (provided)

== Description ==
<Draaka leans down to speak to you.>

Listen... Before you say anything, I KNOW we're not to meddle with demonic energies....

But look around you! These are desperate times, <class>.

We'll most likely die here, regardless. May as well go out in a blaze of glory, I say!

So... Are you in?

Take this canister and go southeast to Felfire Hill. Use it near the patches of felfire and bring it back to me when you've filled it.

Oh, and best not to mention this to anyone.... 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Folly's Edge
|Felfire-Tainted Vest
|Legguards of Abandoned Virtue
|Felfire-Scorched Chestguard

}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||10|15}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Did you fill up that canister for me, <class>?

==Completion==
Oh, yes!

This will teach those elves, just you watch!
