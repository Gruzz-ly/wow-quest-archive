==Objectives==
Speak with [[Benjari Edune]] at the [[House of Edune]] in [[Ashenvale]].

==Description==
<Name>, if you have a moment to spare, I would enlist your aid in a simple matter.

I have not heard from my friends, the [[Edune]]s, in some time. I was wondering if you could swing west and check in on them?

You have my thanks. Their cottage sits on a small plot of land just to the west of the [[Shrine of Aessina]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*510 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Completion==
You say that [[Faldreas Goeth'Shael|Faldreas]] sent you?  Good man.

As it happens, we could use your help.
