==Objectives==
Find the Glowing Gem.
*[[Glowing Gem]]

==Description==
As you rummage through [[Teronis]]' belongings, you find a water-damaged journal.

Quickly flipping through the last legible pages, you read that Teronis makes mention of finding the gem, but then of having lost it in the [[Lake Falathim|Falathim]] area.

The only thing left to do is find it. Perhaps the [[Tendril from Below|tendril]]s have it...?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of the following:
|Falathim-Washed Robes
|Broadleaf Mantle
|Maestra's Gloves
|Broadleaf Spaulders
}}

You will also receive:
*{{coppercost|1000}} (or {{coppercost|1020}} at max level)
*1650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Ah, welcome back, <name>.

==Completion==
This is terrible, <name>. Teronis is dead?!

The time for mourning will come, but for now we must focus our efforts. I will send some of the [[Sentinels]] to recover Teronis' body and to assist the [[Keeper Heartwise|keeper]].

You have the gem that Teronis was seeking? It must be delivered to [[Astranaar]].
