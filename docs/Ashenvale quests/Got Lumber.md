==Objectives==
[[Truun]] wants you to ride [[Brutusk]] to the [[Warsong Labor Camp]].

Speak with [[Kadrak]] to get [[:Kadrak's Reins]] to ride Brutusk. 

==Description==
Kadrak has just received fresh orders for our troops. I hear we're to begin offensive strikes into [[Ashenvale]]!

I have far too few supplies to support an assault, and my shipment from [[Orgrimmar]] has yet to arrive.

I am forced to improvise, and could use your help, <class>.

Speak with Kadrak and ask him for the reins to Brutusk. The [[kodo]] will take you to the Warsong Labor Camp. Once there, seek out [[Gorka]] and ask her to load you up with logs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||13|}}
*1650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Quite an entrance, <race>. What can I do for you?

==Completion==
Welcome, <class>. It is good to see that the road to [[Mor'shan Rampart]]s remains clear.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Kadrak
:{{Gossip|Truun is in need of lumber from the Warsong Camp. I need to use Brutusk to haul it.}}

Hop on Brutusk.

==Progression==
