'''Allegiance to the Old Gods''' sends the players back into Blackfathom Deeps to defeat a leader of the Twilight's Hammer cult.

==Objectives==
Kill Lorgus Jett in [[Blackfathom Deeps (Season of Discovery)|Blackfathom Deeps]] and then return to [[Je'neu Sancrea]] in [[Ashenvale]].
*[[Lorgus Jett (Season of Discovery)|Lorgus Jett]] slain

==Description==
This [[Twilight's Hammer]] follower cannot be allowed to complete his plan. The Twilight's Hammer do not understand the spirits of nature. They believe in the [[Old God]]s—creatures of chaos and destruction that were long ago defeated. This Lorgus cannot be allowed to succeed. You must stop him, <name>. I cannot do it myself—I am too weak.

Go into Blackfathom Deeps, find him, and kill him. Return to me here at [[Zoram'gar Outpost|Zoram'gar]] when it's done.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You may choose one of the following:
|Band of the Iron Fist
|Frayed Chestnut Mantle}}

You will also get:
*{{cost||45}}

==Completion==
Very good!! Thank you, <name>. We may not have stopped the Twilight's Hammer completely, but at least you have staved off another of their plans to return the Old Gods to power.

Who knows what other plans they have manifesting, but we can rest easy for now.
