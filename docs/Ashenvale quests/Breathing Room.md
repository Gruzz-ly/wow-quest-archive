==Objectives==
[[Captain Goggath]] wants you to kill 10 Astranaar Skirmishers and 3 Astranaar Officers.
*[[Astranaar Skirmisher]] slain (10)
*[[Astranaar Officer]] slain (3)

== Description ==
Our forces are not ready to assault Astranaar just yet, <class>. They know we're coming, though, and they're not content to sit and wait for us. At the base of this cliff they've created a camp from which they launch bothersome attacks by the light of the moon.

Before these skirmishes bolster their confidence any further, I want you to visit them with the wrath of the Horde! Return to me when the elves have been humbled a bit.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Cloak of Readiness
|Bracers of Humility
|Groundwork Shield

You will also receive:
* {{cost||10|15}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Well, <race>, have you taught the elves a little humility?

== Completion ==
Well done, <race>. But there is much that remains to be done here
