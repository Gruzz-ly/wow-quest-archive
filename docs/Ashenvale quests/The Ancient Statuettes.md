==Objectives==
Collect 10 Ancient Statuettes.
*[[Ancient Statuette]] (10)

==Description==
I would charge you with a task, <class>.

I was on my boat, skimming over the submerged ruins of Zoram, when naga attacked me, surging from the water and tearing at me with their claws! I fled and the rest, as they say, is history.

I am an archaeologist of sorts, and I am attempting to the recover artifacts of the lost city.

Will you head out onto the Zoram Strand to the southwest and recover any ancient statuettes you come across? They are the reason I have braved the dangers of the Zoram Strand.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|1300}} (or {{coppercost|1020}} at max level)
*1650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Have you found many statuettes, <name>? 

==Completion==
That's quite a few that you have found! Thank you, <name>!

The old city of Zoram holds many secrets, and these statuettes may be the key to many of them.
