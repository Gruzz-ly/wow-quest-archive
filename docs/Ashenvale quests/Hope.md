==Objectives==
Search for signs of [[Tyrande]].
* [[Elun'tara, Bow of the High Priestess]]
* [[Discarded Nightsaber Bridle]]
* [[Ancient Kaldorei Tome]]

==Description==
No... it is not possible. She would not have died like this!

Search for signs of her departure along the strand. Personal effects. Weapons. Anything!

Tyrande is still out there, <name>. We must not lose hope.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Anything?

==Completion==
These would not have been set aside so carefully had she been slain. She is alive!

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Dori'thur will accompany you. We are not alone out here.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Maiev Shadowsong]]|The rest of you stand guard. We move no further until we search the area.}}

Returning with objectives:
:{{Text|say|[[Sira Moonwarden]]|That tome... could it be?}}
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|The Night Warrior.}}
