==Objectives==
[[Captain Goggath]] wants you to speak with [[Tweedle]] at [[Hellscream's Watch]].

== Description ==
Delays, delays, delays! I'm at wit's end!

I was told that this goblin was brilliant - that he'd come up with gadgets sure to shock the enemy into submission. So far he's produced nothing but empty promises. If he comes up empty-handed again, I'm going to toss him off the cliff!

You go and speak to him, <class>. Let him know that my fuse is running short!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*185 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Completion ==
Let me tell ya somethin' <class>!

The bossman simply doesn't appreciate the art and craftsmanship that goes into making fine explosives.

==Trivia==
*In {{g|cata}}, the quest rewarded reputation to the [[Warsong Offensive]].
