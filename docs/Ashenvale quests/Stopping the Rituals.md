'''Stopping the Rituals''' is about disturbing the ritual gems used by the [[satyr]] of [[Satyrnaar]] and [[Xavian]].

==Objectives==
Disturb 8 Ritual Gems.

== Description ==
I could not help but overhear Illiyana's loss. I understand her need for revenge. I am wondering if while you are exacting it, you could do us a service?

No doubt you have already seen the satyr of Satyrnaar and Xavian conducting vile rituals. I believe that they are preparing their rituals to corrupt any of the night elves they capture, turning them into satyrs. We draenei also have problems with fel magic exposure.

Would you disturb their ritual gems while you are there?

== Rewards ==
You will receive {{cost||13|}}

== Completion ==
We are in your debt, <class>.

Unable to complete their nefarious rituals, the satyr are now fighting a losing battle where they are unable to replenish their numbers.

== Gains ==
Upon completion you will gain:  

*1650 [[XP]]
*250 reputation with [[Exodar]]

==Progression==
{{Vile Satyr! Dryads in Danger!}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
