==Objectives==
Rescue [[Boog the "Gear Whisperer"]] and [[Minx]] from [[Painmaster Thundrak]]'s [[Wagon of Unending Agony]].

==Description==
The [[gnome]] explosives squad we requested from [[Tinker Town]] arrived last week. Just in time to face an assault by the [[Horde]]. We lost a lot of soldiers that day. Most of the gnome team was taken as well. Now we're neck deep in Horde, [[Silverwind Refuge]] has been lost and we're down a dozen gnomes.

I'm begging for your help here, <name>. Travel east to Silverwind Refuge and look for any gnome survivors. They were all carted off by a big, merciless orc named Thundrak. Find him and you'll find our gnomes.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|1800}} (or {{coppercost|1200}} at max level)

==Progress==
Any luck with the gnomes? I can't really take much more of [[Gnombus the X-Terminator|Gnombus]].

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Grim news you bring of the rest of the gnome team, but at least you managed to save a few. For that I am grateful.
