==Objectives==
Bring an Elixir of Water Breathing and an Elixir of Wisdom to [[Je'neu Sancrea]] at [[Zoram'gar Outpost]], {{C|Ashenvale}}.
*[[Elixir of Water Breathing]]
*[[Elixir of Wisdom]]

==Description==
The motes you gathered are an important clue, <name>, but we will also need some spiritual guidance if we're to fully understand the situation.

There is a ritual I often practice that requires an Elixir of Insight. The visions it grants will reveal the next steps we must take.

I can brew the elixir from two others. An Elixir of Water Breathing to free the body, and an Elixir of Wisdom to open the mind.

Bring these to me, and we can begin the ritual.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||18}}
* 2000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you acquired the component elixirs, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done. Now the ritual can begin.

==Progression==
{{Elemental Distress}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 1.15.0|note=Added.}}
