==Objectives==
Bring the Strange Water Globe to [[Je'neu Sancrea]] at [[Zoram'gar Outpost]], {{C|Ashenvale}}.
*[[Strange Water Globe (Season of Discovery)]] (provided)

==Description==
The defeated [[water elemental]] has left behind a strange water globe. You surmise that the object somehow fed the beast energy. Inside the globe, a putrid-looking form of water sloshes about. The globe itself seems impervious to any sort of physical force.

If anyone can make any sense of this item, it would be Je'neu Sancrea of the [[Earthen Ring]].

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of the following:
|Outlaw Sabre
|Witch's Finger
}}

==Progress==
Ah, hello again <name>.  I was just reading the waves of the sea, much like I always do.  What brings you to me?

==Completion==
This... this is quite the find, <name>.

You acquired this from [[Baron Aquanis (Season of Discovery)|Baron Aquanis]] in [[Blackfathom Deeps (Season of Discovery)|Blackfathom]], you say? Baron Aquanis has long been thought of as a corrupted [[elemental]] power; this globe will prove what exactly had corrupted him. While it would be no surprise if it turned out to be the [[Twilight's Hammer]], our studies will also show how they did it as well.

You did well in bringing this to me. Please - take this, along with the Earthen Ring's warmest regards.

==Progression==
