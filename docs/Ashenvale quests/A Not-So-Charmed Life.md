==Objectives==
Collect 8 Troll Charms. 
*[[Troll Charm]] (8)

==Description==
The furbolg covet that which does not belong to them.

<Hephaestus turns the charm over in his hand and then discards it.>

There's a property to the carving that slowly corrupts those that aren't trolls. As I understand it, the furbolg have done this sort of thing before. Some never learn.

No doubt they hoard most of the charms in Thistlefur Hold above their village to the north.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||15|}}
*1,850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Progress==
Do you think that you retrieved all of the troll charms from Thistlefur Hold?

If any are left behind, the Thistlefur tribe will continue to be influenced by them, and eventually they will attack this place.

==Completion==
<Hephaestus nods slowly as he looks you straight in the eye.>

You've likely saved the Thistlefur from themselves, at least in the short run.  If they can keep from stealing objects of power that don't belong to them, that is.

I understand that the night elves are having problems with the other furbolg tribe to the south. That's something that Raene is going to want to speak to you about.

However, there are more immediate concerns that I would ask for your help with.
