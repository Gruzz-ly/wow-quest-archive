==Objectives==
Find [[Teronis]] at [[Lake Falathim]] in [[Ashenvale]].

==Description==
A friend of mine from [[Astranaar]], [[Raene Wolfrunner]], asked me to send a scout west to Lake Falathim. Teronis left days ago, just before the Horde attacked.

He was searching for an item he thought could slow the furbolg attacks on our people--a [[Dartol's Rod|rod]] created by a now-dead, evil [[Dartol|wizard]].

Before he left, he mentioned a gem for the rod, which he knew to be resting at a shrine on an island in the lake.

Unfortunately, we know that the lake has been invaded by some evil force. Please, <name>, find my friend.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|0}} (or {{coppercost|1020}} at max level)
*1650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
Teronis' body lies broken atop the small rise next to the [[Keeper Heartwise|Keeper]].

Deep slashes crisscross his corpse.

==Notes==
The Relara Whitemoon quest chain, starting at [[Bathran's Hair (quest)]] / [[Don't Forget the Horde]], needs to be completed up to and including [[Bathed in Light]] before this quest becomes available.

==Progression==
{{Dartol's Rod quest chain}}
