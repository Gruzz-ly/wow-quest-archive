==Objectives==
[[Guardian Menerin]] wants you to deliver the Sealed Missive to [[Guardian Gurtar]]. 
*[[Sheelah's Sealed Missive]] (provided)

==Description==
I... I cannot believe [[Envoy Sheelah|she]]'s gone. It all happened so fast....

I understand that I have you to thank for avenging my mistress. For that, you have my gratitude, and that of [[Silvermoon]].

In her wisdom, my lady foresaw this end. She prepared a missive to be delivered in the event that something happened to her.

We were to join an [[Orgrimmar]] retinue at the crossroads just north of here. Please, <race>, meet them in our stead and see that the message is delivered.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||11|}} 
*1300 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
<Gurtar listens as you inform him of Sheelah's passing.>

I'll deliver this to Hellscream personally, <race>.

In the meantime, there's something I need you to do for me....
