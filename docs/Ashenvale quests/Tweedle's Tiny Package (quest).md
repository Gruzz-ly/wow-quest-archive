==Objectives==
[[Tweedle]] wants you to take Tweedle's Tiny Package to [[Flooz]] at [[Silverwind Refuge]].
*[[Tweedle's Tiny Parcel]] (provided)

== Description ==
Wahoo!!

Look at 'em burn! It's revolutionary! A real breakthrough in explosive technology - which, of course, is the only kind that matters....

I'm gunna be the envy of every goblin south of Northrend!

Believe it or not, I've actually refined the formula to be even more potent!

Here. Take a sample of this stuff southeast to Silverwind Refuge. Maybe my cousin Flooz can use it to help the Horde capture that objective.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||12|}}
*1400 [[XP]]
*150 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Completion ==
Well, look at this! Little Tweedle has really come through this time. This stuff blew up [[Astranaar]], you say?

As you can see, we don't need any help taking over Silverwind Refuge, but Tweedle's ideas are as small as his hands.

If this stuff's really as good as you say, there's no limit to what we might do....

==Notes==
After turning in the quest to Flooz:
:{{text|say|Flooz|Let's put this stuff to the test...}}
:{{text|say|Flooz|Just a pinch...}}
:(''explosion'')
:{{text|say|Flooz|Wahoo!!}}

==Trivia==
*In {{g|cata}}, the quest rewarded reputation to [[Warsong Offensive]].
