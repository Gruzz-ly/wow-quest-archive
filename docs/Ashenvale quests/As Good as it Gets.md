[[Krokk]] wants you to enter the [[Warsong Lumber Camp]] and speak with [[Overseer Gorthak]].

==Description==
Well, <class>, this is as good as it gets.

The [[Night elf|elves]] are scrambling to recover from your recent deeds. There's no better time to break into the lumber camp!

Make your way in and speak with Overseer Gorthak. He'll instruct you as to how best escort the diplomat to safety.

Good luck!
