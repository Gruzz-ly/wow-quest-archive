==Objectives==
Search the piles of [[Fresh Rubble]] to find 10 Chunks of Ore.
* [[Chunk of Ore]] (10)

== Description ==
What [[Draaka]] requires is a magnet of sorts - something that her demonic missiles will be drawn to.

<Durak grins slyly.>

I happen to know of a method that should suit our purposes.

You scour the mines for fist-sized chunks of ore, while I prepare a special... enchantment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||11|}}
*1300 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Progress ==
Have you collected the ore we need? 

== Completion ==
Well done! These should hold a curse long enough for our purposes....
