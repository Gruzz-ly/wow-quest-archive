==Objectives==
[[Guardian Gurtar]] wants you to give the Bloodcup Braid to [[Draaka]] in [[Splintertree Post|Splintertree]].
*[[Bloodcup Braid]]
*[[Orc-Hair Braid]] (provided)

==Description==
I have a bit of a personal request for you, <class>.

It has been many moons since I have seen my love, Draaka. It will be many more before we are able to be together again. I fear that as time passes, her love for me will wane.

This braid has special meaning to the two of us, as do [[Thorned Bloodcup]]s, the flower of this region.

I ask that you pluck the flowers and weave them into this twine, then present the gift to Draaka on my behalf.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bloodcup Slippers
|Faithful Treads
|Gloves of Unforgotten Vows
|Faithful Footguards
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||10|15}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Hello, <name>. 

==Completion==
<Recognizing at once the nature of the gift, Draaka begins to weep.>

Oh, <name>. Thank you for this gift! It means more than you could know.

He hasn't forgotten...

==Notes==
* In {{Expac|Cataclysm}}, the quest awarded reputation to the [[Warsong Offensive]].
* The quest objective map does not show the location of the [[Thorned Bloodcup]] flowers required to make the braid. They can be found fairly densely around the fields southeast of [[Splintertree Post]], just across the road.

==Progression==

==Trivia==
In {{Expac|Cataclysm}}, the quest awarded reputation to the [[Warsong Offensive]].
