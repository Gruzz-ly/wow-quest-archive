==Objectives==
Deliver the Bag of Bathran's Hair to [[Orendil Broadleaf]] at [[Maestra's Post]] in [[Ashenvale]].
* [[Bag of Bathran's Hair]] (provided)

==Description==
Quickly, <name>. I will put the [[:Bathran's Hair]] into this bag, but you must deliver it to my master, Orendil Broadleaf. You will find him at Maestra's Post, just south down the road on the left.

But beware, we've received reports that the post is under attack from the Horde!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|0}} (or {{coppercost|240}} at max level)
*420 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
You're a brave one to come here given the circumstances.

What business have you, stranger?

==Completion==
So, Evenar was succesful{{sic}}. Actually, more to the point, YOU were successful.

I cannot thank you enough, <class>, but there is more that must be done to the leaves before they will serve as a curative for what ails the child, [[Relara Whitemoon|Relara]].
