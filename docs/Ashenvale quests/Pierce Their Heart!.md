==Objectives==
[[Durak (demon)|Durak]] wants you to use the Tainted Blood of the Kaldorei on the Forest Heart.
*[[The Forest Heart (item)|Forest Heart]] Corrupted
*[[Tainted Blood of the Kaldorei]] (provided)

==Description==
There...

The blood of the fallen [[Kaldorei]] is turned. It can now be used on the Forest Heart in [[Dor'Danil Barrow Den]]. Doing so will utterly corrupt it.

The sacred relic of the arrogant elves will be turned against them. How poetic!

<Durak laughs cruelly.>

The barrow den lies nestled against the hills to the southeast. One of my [[imp]]s has laid a blood trail from the entrance to the heart.

Make haste! Kadrak is not likely to be in a patient mood.

Off you go, <class>.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Scrupleless Bracers
|Bloodtaint Boots
|Forest Heart Piercer
|Heart-Corruptor Wristguards
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||10|15}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Has the heart been corrupted, <name>?

==Completion==
It is done?

Good work, <name>. That will gradually weaken their forces, as well as their spirit.

==Notes==
Enter the barrow and find red glowing trail on the floor. This lead the way to the Forest Heart on the bottom of the den. The brown spiky egg-like thing is suspended in mid air.

Completing this quest is a criterion of [[Ashenvale Quests]].

In {{Expac|Cataclysm}}, the quest awarded reputation to the [[Warsong Offensive]].
