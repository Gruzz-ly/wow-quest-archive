==Objectives==
Collect 20 Sapphires of Aku'Mai.
*[[Sapphire of Aku'Mai]] (20)

==Description==
Within the beginning tunnels of [[Blackfathom Deeps]], there are large sapphire clusters along the cave walls. We noticed that the [[naga]] started harvesting the crystals around the same time their weaponry greatly improved.

The crystals seem to have great elemental power and, if used inappropriately, could make for a powerful component for my smithing.<ref>Pre-[[Shattering]], [[Je'neu Sancrea]] offered this quest and worried about the naga using the crystals '''in'''appropriately. Presumably, the quest text should have been updated to have Dagrun say "if used '''appropriately'''".</ref>

Will you help me, <name>? Blackfathom Deeps can be found along Zoram Strand to the north of our outpost.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||14|}}
*1300 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
How goes your search for the crystals, <name>? Do you think they'll make an item we can use to stop the naga?

==Completion==
Excellent! These will do nicely. Here's a reward for your hard work.

==Notes==
This quest should be done together with [[Deep Despair]]. The crystals can be found along the tunnel that leads to the Blackfathom Deeps instance entrance. It is not a dungeon quest and can easily be completed solo.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Updated with a new ID and text. Now offered by Dagrun Ragehammer instead of [[Je'neu Sancrea]].}}
