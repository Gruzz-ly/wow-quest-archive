*[[Horn of Xelthos]]

==Description==
<A note sits in the chest>

Hello, <name>.

I desire a treasure known as The Horn of Xelthos, which is somewhere within Shadowfang Keep.

Venturing inside the keep usually calls for backup. However, for this job, a low profile is of utmost importance.

You must go alone.

I have a contact, by the name of [[Veenix]], in the {{C|Stonetalon Mountains}}. He should be able to help you get past the courtyard gate. The rest is up to you.

Return the horn here, and your payment will be sent soon after.

- C

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<The chest sits, empty.>

==Completion==
<You place The Horn of Xelthos into the chest>

==Notes==
===Obtaining the quest===
In order to obtain this quest, you must first reach level 20, at which point you will receive a letter from "C" in the mail. This quest will only appear after reading the letter:
{{Book|An Offer|content=
Greetings <name>,

I've been observing your handiwork for some time now. I must say, I'm impressed. You're clearly no mere street urchin.

There's a job I'd like you to do for me; the retrieval of a certain treasure. I assure you the pay is lucrative.

If you're interested, I've left a dead drop in a cabin beside Pyrewood Village. You'll find more information within.

Regards,<br>
-C
}}

===Completing the quest===
To obtain the Horn, the Rogue must sneak through parts of Shadowfang Keep to the [[Ornamented Chest]] in the stables. This ''must'' be done solo.
*Passing through the door to the courtyard without killing {{C|Rethilgore}} can be accomplished by destroying it with a [[Breaching Charge]] from Veenix in the Stonetalon Mountains, or by waiting until level 22 and using [[Vanish]] after opening [[Deathstalker Adamant]]'s cell.
*Obtaining the key to the chest requires pick pocketing the [[Sister's Half-Key]] from [[Gemela]] in the dining hall, and the [[Brother's Half-Key]] from [[Gefell]] just up the stairs from there. Combine the two halves to make the [[Twin Key]]. Be warned that doing so will take cancel stealth.
