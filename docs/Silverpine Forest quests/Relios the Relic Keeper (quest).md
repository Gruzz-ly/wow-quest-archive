== Objectives ==
Find a Dalaran Archmage's Signet Ring.
* [[Dalaran Archmage's Signet Ring]]

== Description ==
[[Sylvanas Windrunner|The Dark Lady]] is correct in her assertion that I am able to unlock the codex. Unfortunately, I need a signet ring from a [[Dalaran]] archmage to do it. My own ring was taken when I died many years ago, but there still might be a way.

While Dalaran has floated away, the outskirts of the city remain. Far to the east lie the ruins of Dalaran. It is there that you will find an archmage known as [[Relios the Relic Keeper|Relios]]. "Take" his signet ring and bring it back to me.

You may use the portal behind me to get to the crater.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Codex Breaker
|Relios's Mace
|Betrayal's Sting}}
{{itembox|You will also receive:
|Forsaken Ball}}

== Progress ==
Did you recover a Dalaran Archmage's Signet Ring?

== Completion ==
Perfect. I hope this wasn't too much trouble to come by, <name>. Relios was a pupil of mine when I was a mortal man thereby making him a competent and formidable adversary. I suppose I could have warned you ahead of time.

Now let us see the ring.

<Dalar trails the ring across the spine of the codex.>

There we are...
