==Objectives==
Slay Scarlet Commander Forsythe in Fenris Keep.
*Reach [[Fenris Keep]]
*[[Scarlet Commander Forsythe]] slain
*Meet [[Lilian Voss]] inside Fenris Keep.

==Description==
We haven't seen the [[Scarlet Crusade]] put this many fresh soldiers on the field in a long time.

And we know that they didn't get here on their own. Someone's guiding them. Someone who's fought [[Forsaken]] before.

Someone I remember well.

Come with me, and let's put an end to Commander Forsythe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 8,500 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=15|Flightstones
}}

==Completion==
There, it's done. A few Scarlets may have escaped from us, but we've wiped them off of [[Fenris Isle]].

Without their commander, hopefully they can't regroup anytime soon. And they'll think twice about coming after the Forsaken again.

We have our strength, our common purpose. And we have you.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|The pieces of my past... it's like they're standing in front of me again, trying to scare me.}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|But now, they should fear me.}}

Lilian uses her signature ability on the enemies. Proceed inside the keep.
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|Their commander is here. Let's show him why he should have run.}}
:{{Text|say|Scarlet Commander Forsythe|Lilian Voss... Your father would despise you for what you've become.}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|Keep talking. You'll run out of breath quicker.}}

Head upstairs and attack the commander.
:{{Text|say|Scarlet Commander Forsythe|I will purge the world of you!}}
:{{Text|yell|Scarlet Commander Forsythe|Do you not see that the world would be better off without the Forsaken in it?}}

At around 20%, Forsythe uses Binding Light on Lilian and the adventurer:
:{{Text|yell|Scarlet Commander Forsythe|Monsters! Die in the [[Light]]!}}
:{{Text|yell|Lilian Voss|We will survive!}}

Use the Will of the Forsaken extra action button to cancel Binding Light and kill him.
:{{Text|say|Scarlet Commander Forsythe|Is that... all... there is?}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|It is done. We've retaken the Isle. Let's regroup downstairs and get back to [[Ruins of Lordaeron|the capital]].}}

Head downstairs and turn in to Lilian. Next to her is a [[Forsaken Dreadmage (heritage)|Forsaken Dreadmage]] holding a portal.

Completing this quest reverts the phases across Silverpine back to their original state.
