==Objectives==
Use the [[Mutant Bush Chicken]] to kill the Forest Ettin.
* [[Forest Ettin]] slain

==Description==
Take [[Mutant Bush Chicken Cage|this cage]], <class>. I've placed inside it one of my own mutant bush chickens, with a few slight modifications. Within the butt of this bush chicken is a stick of dynamite laced with gunk from the diseased organs you brought me.

Take the cage out into the surrounding forest and locate the wandering forest ettin. Release the chicken and sit back as my masterwork does its job. The ensuing explosion should be sufficient to kill the ettin or greatly weaken it, allowing you to finish it off.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Chicken Stuffers
|Suppository Preventors
|Bush Chicken Remote Injector}}
{{itembox|You will also receive:
|q=3|"Bear" Steaks}}

You will also receive:
* 1150 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Have you dealt with the ettin?

==Completion==
<Apothecary Wormcrud laughs maniacally.>

Was there every any doubt? An ettin is no match for science!

==Notes==
Target a Forest Ettin and use the quest item on him, releasing the Mutant Bush Chicken. The ettin will promptly eat it, making the chicken explode and take out a huge chunk of health and giving it a debuff that reduces its damage done by 60%, making it easy to finish him off.
