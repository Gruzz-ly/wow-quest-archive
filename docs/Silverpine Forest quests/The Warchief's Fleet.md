==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Admiral Hatchet}} at the [[Forsaken Rear Guard]] in [[Silverpine Forest]].

==Description==
Our reinforcements from [[Kalimdor]] arrived last night. Three [[Destroyer#Orc destroyer|orc gunships]] full of supplies, weapons and soldiers. Three orc gunships lost to {{NPC||Ivar Bloodfang||Bloodfang's}} damned [[worgen]].

How could an entire orc fleet lose to a small band of enemy combatants that lack any siege weaponry? An important question that you will answer for me.

Gather your gear and report to the orc admiral, Hatchet, at the Forsaken Rear Guard, southwest of here.

Get those orcs operational, <name>.

I await your full report.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 100 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]
* +10 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
This fiasco may go down as one of the biggest embarrassments in the history of naval warfare. How did this happen? Drunk happened. That's how.

==Notes==
Follow the road south. Keep an eye out for a branch to the west and follow it. Pick up the flight path just outside, then talk to Hatchet.

She and {{NPC||Warlord Torok}} run down the situation:
:{{text|say|Admiral Hatchet|Who's not drunk, Torok?}}
:{{text|say|Warlord Torok|Including me?}}
:{{text|say|Admiral Hatchet|Yes.}}
:{{text|say|Warlord Torok|<hic>! Well... Let's see... By my count, nobody. The whole crew's drunk out of their gourds, admiral... 'cept the sea pups... <hic!>}}

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Command: Silverpine Forest!}}
