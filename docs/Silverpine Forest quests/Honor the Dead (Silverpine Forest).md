==Objectives==
Recover 6 Forsaken Insignias from [[Veteran Forsaken Trooper]] corpses.
* [[Forsaken Insignia]] (6)

==Description==
[[File:Veteran Forsaken Trooper dead.jpg|thumb|He's dead, Jim.]]
A convoy of veteran troopers and Forsaken catapults were ambushed earlier today while attempting to cross [[Olsen's Farthing]], directly south of here. It was a total loss: all troopers were killed and all catapults destroyed.

[[Ivar Bloodfang|Bloodfang]]'s [[Bloodfang pack|pack]] was responsible for the ambush, though likely they have all fled back into the hills, preparing their next cowardly strike. Their day will come, but for now I want you to go to Olsen's Farthing and honor our fallen.

Recover their Forsaken insignias.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1150 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered the insignias?

==Completion==
I will see to it that these insignias are returned to the [[Undercity]] at once. The registrar will place their names in our records so that their sacrifice may never be forgotten.

==Notes==
Killing any {{NPC||Bloodfang Stalker}} while on the quest starts [[Excising the Taint]].
