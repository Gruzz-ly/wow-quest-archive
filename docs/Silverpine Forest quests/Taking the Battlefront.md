== Completion ==
The hour of victory approaches, <name>. [[Vincent Godfrey|Godfrey]] has devised a plan to decimate our enemies. I am sending you into the field with him and his men to bring the rebel insurgents to their knees and seal the fate of the [[Alliance]] filth encroaching upon our lands.

Our final march begins when you are ready.
