== Objectives ==
Escort {{NPC||Master Forteski}} through the [[Deep Elem Mine]].
* Escort Master Forteski through the Deep Elem Mine.

== Description ==
The mistress has put me in charge of this lot. Our primary mission is to get in there, corner the rats, and kill 'em all, including [[Ivar Bloodfang|Bloodfang]].

You've done us a solid service in gettin' the information, <name>. Join in the glory and help us drive a sword through their miserable skulls!

Let me know when you're ready and I'll call for the charge.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Underestimated Crossbow
|Britches of Desperate Measures
|Mace of Calculated Loss
|Trousers of Desperate Measures
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||16|95}}
* 1,100 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

== Completion ==
WHAT!?

<Sylvanas shrieks.>

CROWLEY!!!!!

Bastards. Those were some of our strongest soldiers. I have underestimated {{NPC||Darius Crowley|Crowley}} and Bloodfang for the last time. Clearly they are an enemy the likes of which we have never seen - willing to sacrifice their own to set a trap like this... unheard of in Alliance warfare.

==Notes==
