Retrieve 6 Servitor Cores.
* [[Servitor Core]] (6)

== Description ==
[[File:Elemental Servitor.jpg|thumb|An {{npc||Elemental Servitor}}]]
The magi of [[Ambermill]] have employed foul magic to keep us away. Elemental servitors created with immunities that we cannot breach protect their territory.

Venture east to Ambermill and slay the unyielding elemental servitors that guard the town and recover their cores. Bring their cores back to me so that I may devise a method by which we are able to destroy them all!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||9}}

== Progress ==
Have you recovered the servitor cores?

== Completion ==
Well done, <name>. The praise the Banshee Queen lavishes upon you is apparently not unfounded.

==Progression==
