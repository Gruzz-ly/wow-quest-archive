==Notes==
Conversation along the way:
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|I have not always been the Banshee Queen, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|And my people have not always been the Forsaken.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Long ago this land comprised the northern kingdoms of Lordaeron, ruled by King [[Terenas Menethil]].}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Terenas had a son named [[Arthas]].}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Arthas... even saying his name makes my body quiver in rage.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|This man-child, Arthas, took for himself a cursed blade known as [[Frostmourne]].}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Through Frostmourne, Arthas killed his own father and razed this land along with every living creature in it!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|My own death came at the hands of Arthas when he and his armies [[Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas|sacked my homeland]], [[Quel'Thalas]], and murdered [[High elf|my people]].}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|In his vast cruelty, Arthas severed my spirit from my body and raised me as a [[banshee]] to serve in his [[Scourge]] army.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|A similar fate befell all that would die to the Scourge war machine.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|In death, they were reborn as mindless [[undead]].}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|But Arthas was not invincible! With each passing day his power wanted - his grip over the will of the damned loosening.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|It was when Arthas was at his weakest that I struck!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|And though the hour of his atonement had come, the worm managed to escape his fate, returning to the frozen wastes of [[Northrend]].}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|With Arthas gone, so too was the control he held over the undead masses of Lordaeron. After recovering my body, I freed the remaining Scourge that were left behind.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|From the cruelty and mercilessness of Arthas, the man who would be the [[Lich King]], the Forsaken were born.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Our goal... Our sole purpose was to destroy the Lich King. We threw our lot in with the [[Horde]] and began our journey towards redemption.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Now the Lich King is dead and we have returned.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|The people who called this land their home in life, do so in death as well.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|But the Alliance does not recognize our rights. They claim this land as their own while attempting to invalidate the claims of the founders of this kingdom.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|I will never allow it... Never!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Lordaeron belongs to the Forsaken - always and forever.}}
