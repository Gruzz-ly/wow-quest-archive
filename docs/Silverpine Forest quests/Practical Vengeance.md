== Objectives ==
Kill any 12 Dalaran humans.
* Dalaran Human slain (12)

== Description ==
Under ordinary circumstances I am not a vengeful man. In fact, I am somewhat of a pragmatist. You see, practicality is a paradoxical notion to vengeance. Most revenge ploys are highly impractical.

BUT... in this case - since you're already going to the ruins of [[Dalaran]] - you might as well kill every Dalaran affiliated human that you see. The reasons that I want them dead range from hatred to anger to betrayal, but I assure you they are all legitimate gripes. Do this for me and I will pay you handsomely.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Edge of Unlifted Burdens
|Dawnweaver's Dagger
|Axe of Practical Vengeance
|Psychopathic Hatchet}}

== Progress ==
The people of Dalaran must suffer for what they did to me!

== Completion ==
I thought for sure that with the death of a dozen of my most hated enemies I would feel a great burden lifted from my shoulders. Sadly, I do not feel a thing. Perhaps I am a psychopath.

== Notes ==
Loot the [[Arcane Remnant (starter)]] that drops from [[Arcane Remnant]]s to start [[Ley Energies]].

==Progression==
