==Objectives==
Plant Explosive Plague and eliminate Scarlet Archmages without being discovered.
*Plant [[Explosive Plague Mixture|Explosive Plague]] (3)
*[[Scarlet Archmage (heritage)|Scarlet Archmage]] slain (6)
*Meet [[Dark Ranger Velonara]] on the north side of [[Fenris Isle]].
*[[Scarlet Disguise]] (provided)

==Description==
We could use those recruits to bolster us, but those dreadful [[undead]] are harrying our supply lines! They will all be put in the ground permanently, soon enough.

Could you check on our stockpiles to make sure we've got enough for your recruits? Of course the good stuff has already gone up to [[Fenris Keep]] for the [[Scarlet Commander Forsythe|Commander]], but everyone has to eat.

Well, almost everyone.

Get a move on, lieutenant.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Careful. We don't want to be seen too early.

==Completion==
I can smell the plague... and the smoke.

Well done, cutting through their defenses.

==Notes==
Proceed further inland.
:{{Text|say|[[Scarlet Footsoldier]]|Welcome to the Isle, lieutenant!}}

:{{Text|yell|[[Huntmaster Scarborgh]]|Keep your wits sharp! The undead draw near...}}

By the first Explosive Plague Mixture.
:{{Text|say|Scarlet Footsoldier|They're an affront to all things good in the world.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Scarlet Confessor]]|Lordaeron is a human kingdom. It belongs to us, not the undead.}}

Interact with the barrel. It explodes, destroying a [[Scarlet Cannon (heritage)|Scarlet Cannon]], and setting two soldiers aflame.
:{{Text|say|Scarlet Commander Forsythe|Soldiers of the [[Scarlet Crusade]], we stand at the threshold of a new Lordaeron, poised to liberate it from the cold grasp of the undead.}}

Continue to the [[Dawning Isles]] and find another barrel to explode.
:{{Text|say|Scarlet Confessor|I can smell the undead whenever they get close. Putrid.}}
:{{Text|say|Scarlet Footsoldier|Disgusting creatures. Those abominations need to be eliminated.}}
:{{Text|say|Scarlet Commander Forsythe|Too long have those monsters polluted the hallowed lands of our people. No more. Today, we will reclaim what is ours and purge the stain of the unliving from the world.}}

Continue to the last barrel.
:{{Text|say|Scarlet Footsoldier|If I saw one of those shamblers here in front of me right now, they wouldn't stand a chance.}}
:{{Text|say|Scarlet Confessor|It's just a matter of time before the last Forsaken is killed. Then the world will be a better place!}}
:{{Text|say|Scarlet Commander Forsythe|Ready yourselves. This is the hour where you will be tested. Only you stand between the darkness of death and the light of the living!}}

;Passing by
:{{Text|say|Scarlet Confessor|Did you hear that a bunch of recruits got eaten?}}
:{{Text|say|Scarlet Footsoldier|Disgusting.}}

;Killing the Archmages
*{{Text|say|Scarlet Archmage|What? You...?}}
*{{Text|say|Scarlet Archmage|How did you...?}}

Find Velonara:
:{{Text|say|Dark Ranger Velonara|Over here. We're ready to proceed.}}
