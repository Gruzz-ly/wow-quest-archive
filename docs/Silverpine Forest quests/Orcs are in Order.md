==Objectives==
Deliver the Admiral's Commendation Letter to {{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||Lady Sylvanas Windrunner}} at [[Forsaken High Command]] in [[Silverpine Forest]].
* [[Admiral's Commendation Letter]] (provided)

==Description==
<{{NPC||Admiral Hatchet}} hands you an envelope sealed with the mark of the [[Horde]].>

This is your commendation letter. It's the least I could do for you given the circumstances.

Return to Lady Sylvanas Windrunner with the letter and inform her of our status. Let her know that we will be ready to march on her command.

Goodbye, <name>. You are an excellent soldier.

Northeast, <lad/ma'am>. To Forsaken High Command!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,350 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]
* +500 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
And the orcs?

==Completion==
<Sylvanas raises an eyebrow.>

So the orcs are in order?

<Sylvanas reads the commendation letter.>

Recovered their supplies? Killed a dozen [[worgen]]? Toppled an [[ettin]]? Freed their soldiers and destroyed the [[Skitterweb Matriarch|Skitterweb matriarch]]?

I say this rarely, <name>. but I am impressed. Perhaps your ability matches your aspirations. We shall see, for now you will be tested!
