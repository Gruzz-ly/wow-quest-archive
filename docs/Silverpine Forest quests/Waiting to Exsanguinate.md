==Objectives==
Enter the Ivar Cottage and find a suitable hiding place upstairs. Then eavesdrop on {{NPC||Lord Darius Crowley}}.
* Learn of Darius Crowley's Plans

==Description==
The [[Gilneas Liberation Front]] leader, Darius Crowley, has been meeting with another [[worgen]] inside this cottage for the past three days. I'm not sure what's going on, but we need to get inside the cottage and find a good hiding place from where we can eavesdrop.

It's now or never, <race>. We may never get another shot.

Just promise me that if I don't make it, you'll return to [[Forsaken High Command]] and inform {{NPC||Deathstalker Commander Belmont||Belmont}} of whatever we discover.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Cloak of Courage
|Yorick's Bequest
|Treads of the Survivor
|Grasps of the Survivor
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||16|95}}
* 1,100 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
News from Yorick?

==Completion==
Alas, poor Yorick! I knew her, <name>. An assassin of infinite courage...

Now, tell me what's going on? What did you and Yorick discover?

==Notes==
Upon accepting:
:{{text|say|[[Deathstalker Rane Yorick]]|We haven't got much time. Crowly will be arriving shortly.}}
:''Yorick goes inside the cottage and upstairs, she points at an Armoire.''
:{{text|say|Deathstalker Rane Yorick|THERE! Hide in the armoire! I'll hide in the shadow next to you.}}

Interact with the Armoire. A cutscene begins:
:''Lord Darius Crowley and {{NPC||Ivar Bloodfang||Packleader Ivar Bloodfang}} enter the room.''
:{{text|say|Lord Darius Crowley|Have you given any more thought to my proposal, Ivar?}}
:{{text|say|Packleader Ivar Bloodfang|Why trust you now, Crowley? You abandoned us. Left us to die.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Darius Crowley|If we're to win this war we will need your help. Our packs must unite! The Forsaken will destroy us otherwise.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Darius Crowley|You are the alpha male, Ivar. The rest of the ferals in Silverpine will do as you command.}}
:{{text|say|Packleader Ivar Bloodfang|I don't care about your war, Crowley.}}
:{{text|say|Packleader Ivar Bloodfang|But...}}
:{{text|say|Packleader Ivar Bloodfang|I have seen firsthand what the Forsaken are capable of doing. It is true. They hunt us... slaughter the defenseless.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Darius Crowley|So will you help?}}
:{{text|say|Packleader Ivar Bloodfang|Aye, I will gather my pack... we...}}
:{{text|emote|Packleader Ivar Bloodfang sniffs the air.}}
:{{text|say|Packleader Ivar Bloodfang|It would appear that we are being watched, Crowley. You have grown soft... Likely {{NPC||Genn Greymane||Greymane's}} fault.}}
:''Ivar seemingly walks towards the player's hiding place, but turns at the last moment, grabbing Yorick by the neck.''
:{{text|say|Packleader Ivar Bloodfang|Treacherous little pup!}}
:{{text|say|Packleader Ivar Bloodfang|What say you now, spy?}}
:{{text|say|Deathstalker Rane Yorick|I live... and die... for the {{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||Banshee Queen}}.}}
:{{text|say|Packleader Ivar Bloodfang|I was hoping you'd say that...}}
:''Ivar throws Yorick at the far wall, killing her.''
:{{text|say|Packleader Ivar Bloodfang|I will prepare the pack. It will take some time to gather them all, but we will join... for now.}}
:''Crowley and Ivar leave the room.''

Head back to High Command.
