==Objectives==
Rouse 8 Orc Sea Dogs.
* [[Orc Sea Dog]] roused (8)
*[[Barrel of Explosive Ale]] (provided)

==Description==
Thank the [[Warchief]] that you're here, <name>. I've made a critical error with the sea dogs and need your help to rectify the situation.

You see, I sent them out against the worgen coming from [[Fenris Isle]] stone cold sober. They attacked the beasts and promptly got their butts handed to them. Many of them died, but a few still live, barely clinging on to dear life.

Take this barrel of ale to the [[Decrepit Fields]], east of here, and force it down the throats of fallen sea dogs.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Treads of the Sepulcher
|Sea Dog Belt
|Ale-Soaked Robes
|Cord of the Sepulcher
}}

You will also receive:
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
* +250 reputation with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]
*3x [[Hair of the Dog]]

==Progress==
Don't let my sea dogs die!

==Completion==
A-HA! I knew it! Lesson learned, I suppose. We will not fall again. I will be sure to have some ale on hand at the front lines.

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Command: Silverpine Forest!}}
