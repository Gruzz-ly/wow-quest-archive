== Objectives ==
Rescue 8 {{npc||Cowering Trooper}}s.
* Cowering Trooper rescued (8)

== Description ==
[[File:Cowering Trooper.jpg|thumb|A Cowering Trooper]]
Our forces in [[Pyrewood Village|Pyrewood]] were recently taken by way of sneak attack. The [[7th Legion]] managed to infiltrate the town with their scouts, ultimately decimating our troops.

{{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||The Dark Lady}} has tasked us with a rescue mission. We are to find survivors and get them out of Pyrewood safely. If any soldiers live they are likely worthless, but we do as the Dark Lady commands.

Let's get this nonsense over with, <name>. Pyrewood is directly southwest of the Forsaken Front.

== Progress ==
The sooner we rescue the survivors the sooner we can burn down the whole of Pyrewood.

== Completion ==
What happened here today is between us. Say a word to anyone and you will find yourself in a corpse pit next to these poor fools.

== Notes ==
The Cowering Troopers will thank the player upon being rescued. [[Lord Godfrey]] has no sympathy for them and will make dismissive remarks in response. In fact Godfrey may even shoot and kill a few of the cowering troopers.

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Command: Silverpine Forest!}}
