== Objectives ==
Recover 8 Arcane Remnants.
* [[Arcane Remnant (quest item)]] (8)

== Description ==
The arcane remnant pulses with strange energy. Perhaps you should search for more remnants. Surely Dalar would be interested in such a find.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||20}}

== Progress ==
What's that you've got there, <name>?

== Completion ==
Smart <boy/girl>! I can most definitely use these arcane remnants in my studies. Indeed, Dalaran was built upon a massive [[ley line]]. It's no wonder, then, that such things exist at the crater.
