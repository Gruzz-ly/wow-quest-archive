{{questportrait|Admiral Hatchet.jpg|Admiral Hatchet|The waters of Lordamere Lake will run red with the blood of the worgen!}}
==Objectives==
Kill 50 Hillsbrad Worgen with the Horde Cannon.
* [[Hillsbrad Worgen]] slain (50)

==Description==
<The communication console hums.>

Those worgen you killed were the scouting party. There are hundreds more incoming! Looks like {{NPC||Darius Crowley||Crowley}} and {{NPC||Ivar Bloodfang||Bloodfang}} made the blood offering to every human in [[Lordaeron]].

Get in one of those Horde cannons and send them all back to their makers. Let the waters of [[Lordamere Lake]] run red with their blood!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Blood Offering Platter
|Sabots of Red Waters

}}

You will also receive:
* 1,100 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
* +500 reputation with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
Though you killed a large number of the newly turned worgen, many more are sure to appear. Still, their assault will have softened. Well done, <name>!
