==Objectives==
Don your disguise and report to the Quartermaster Newlem on Fenris Isle.
*Don Scarlet Disguise
*Pick Up [[Faranell]]'s Mixture
*Speak to the [[Scarlet Boatmaster]]
*While disguised, meet [[Quartermaster Newlem]] on [[Fenris Isle]].
*[[Scarlet Disguise]] (provided)

==Description==
Now it's time to sneak you onto Fenris Isle. I know this armor isn't exactly what you want to wear, but it will help you move around without being noticed.

Approach the isle on their level. No fancy sky maneuvers.

Once you've put on the armor, find a way to get across the water. There's a quartermaster who can tell you where to go from there.

From there, you know how to raise bedlam.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 850 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Completion==
[[Lieutenant Hawlsey|Hawlsey]]! You're looking a bit grey around the gills.

Are those new recruits working you to the bone already?

==Notes==
Upon accept, the Disguised extra action button appears and the [[Explosive Plague Mixture]] becomes interactable. Use the button:
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|Well that... that brings back memories.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Calia Menethil]]|We all have pieces of our past that shame us, Lilian. But we are working toward a better future, together.}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|Together.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Apothecary Faranell|Could we hurry it along? I can't wait to deploy this improved formula.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Dark Ranger Velonara]]|You should get moving. When you've weakened the Scarlet defenses, find me on Fenris Isle and we will bring in the rest of our forces.}}

Head to the dock at the [[Decrepit Fields]] and speak with the boatmaster:
:You'll just have to wait your-- wait, sorry, Lieutenant! I didn't recognize you at first.

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Stare silently until the Boatmaster calls a boat for you.>}}
:{{Text|say|Scarlet Boatmaster|I... err. Yes sir? Here's your boat sir. Please stop looking at me like that sir.}}
:{{Gossip|quest=|Yes, it is I, a lieutenant of the [[Scarlet Crusade]]. An officer in the crusade that calls itself Scarlet. Down with the [[Forsaken]]. Now call a boat for me.}}
:{{Text|say|Scarlet Boatmaster|Of course, right away lieutenant! Have a good ride over!}}
:''With either option, the adventurer is transported on a Boat<!-- 203648 --> to Fenris Isle.''

On the isle, the Scarlet Crusaders are {{rep|friendly}}. Avoid the [[Alert Hound]] with stealth detection. Turn in [[Quartermaster Newlem]].

Wearing the disguise changes the reaction of other mobs and NPCs across Silverpine. All hostile mobs (beasts, Dalaran mages, and their elementals) become {{rep|neutral}}, guards tagged with the [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]] faction outside the Sepulcher become {{rep|hostile}}, and the Alliance forces (Bloodfang worgen) become {{rep|friendly}}.

==Progression==
