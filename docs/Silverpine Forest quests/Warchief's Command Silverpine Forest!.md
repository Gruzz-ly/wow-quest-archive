==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Grand Executor Mortuus}} at [[Forsaken High Command]] in [[Silverpine Forest]].

==Description==
All able-bodied members of the [[Horde]] are hereby ordered to report to Grand Executor Mortuus at Forsaken High Command in Silverpine Forest.

Now, more than ever, your help is needed in routing the enemy infestation of the region and conquering the port of [[Ruins of Gilneas|Gilneas]]!

To reach Forsaken High Command you must travel south through [[Tirisfal Glades]] and enter Silverpine Forest. From there, follow the road south until you reach Forsaken High Command.

Onward, <brother/sister>! Destiny calls!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 850 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
Most excellent! A new recruit has arrived. There is much to do... much to do I say.

==Notes==
Exit [[Undercity]] or [[Brill]] and follow the road southwest to reach Silverpine. Then keep heading south to reach Forsaken High Command, which is off the road to the right. There, Grand Executor Mortuus and {{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||Lady Sylvanas Windrunner}} await, overlooking a pit full of {{NPC||Fallen Human}}s, and three [[Val'kyr]]: {{NPC||Agatha}}, {{NPC||Arthura}} and {{NPC||Daschla}}.
