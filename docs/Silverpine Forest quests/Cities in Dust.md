== Objectives ==
Accompany [[Lady Sylvanas Windrunner]] to the Battlefield and defeat the [[Alliance]]!
* Victory: Final and Absolute

== Description ==
Our armies clash across the battlefield. {{NPC||Darius Crowley||Crowley}}  and his forces are losing ground and they do not yet know the fate of {{NPC||Lorna Crowley}}. We will meet with Crowley and his compatriots at mid field and I will present them with terms of their surrender. They will either accept or we will kill them all and leave their cities in dust.

As my most trusted soldier, you are to stand by my side during the exchange. Tell me when you are prepared to leave.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bracers of the Most Trusted
|Belt of Beginnings
|Slippers of Unturned Loyalties
|Belt of Absolute Allegiance
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||22|60}}
* 1,500 [[XP]]
* +1,000 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

== Completion ==
<Lady Sylvanas Windrunner grimaces in pain.>

This... is not over. Godfrey and his traitorous allies will pay for what they have done as will the remaining Alliance forces occupying Lordaeron.

Our work has only just begun.

:{{text|yell|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Lay down your arms and surrender!}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|I will leave your cities in dust and your lives in ruin!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Look at them, <name>. They scurry like rats, veering headlong to their doom. Surely Crowley and Bloodfang can see the futility in this!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|To the Greymane Wall! We will force their hand.}}
:''The party arrives at the Greymane Wall.''
:{{text|yell|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Crowley, your forces have fallen before my mighty army. You have lost!}}

:{{text|say|Lord Darius Crowley|It's not over, Sylvanas. Not yet.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|You frivolously throw away the lives of your people while your own king sits atop his throne of lies, nary lifting a finger to help.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Is Gilneas worth the lives that have been lost? The lives that will be lost? You cannot win.}} (The audio still says "Is your city worth the lives that have been lost? The lives that will be lost? You cannot win.")
:{{text|say|Lord Darius Crowley|We will die trying!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|And your daughter? You could have saved her... You could have offered her your blood, yet you did not. Why?}}

:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Nothing, yet...}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|I now present you with a choice - a choice that I was never given.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|I offer you the life of Lorna for your unconditional surrender.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Choose your next words wisely, Crowley. Deny me and she will serve me in undeath - forever.}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Bring her, Godfrey!}}
:''[[Lord Godfrey]] arrives at the scene, clutching the body of Lorna Crowley, along with [[Lord Walden]] and [[Baron Ashbury]].''
:{{text|say|Lord Darius Crowley|GODFREY! You deceitful maggot!}}
:{{text|say|Lord Godfrey|Hello, old friend!}}
:{{text|say|Lord Darius Crowley|Lorna... I... Release her. I will sound the retreat.}}
:{{text|say|Packleader Ivar Bloodfang|You can't be serious, Crowley. You miserable bastard!}}
:''Packleader Ivar Bloodfang runs back to Gilneas.''
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Release her, Godfrey.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Godfrey|Of course, mistress.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Now leave here, Crowley, and never return.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Lordaeron belongs to the Forsaken.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Darius Crowley|Forgive me, daughter...}}
:''Darius Crowley and his daughter runs back to Gilneas.''
:{{text|yell|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|SOLDIERS OF THE HORDE! WE ARE VICTORIOUS! LORDAERON IS W...}}
:''Suddenly, Lord Godfrey and his group moves toward Sylvanas, pulling up a gun and shoots her at point blank, killing her instantly.''

:{{text|say|High Warlord Cromush|WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, GODFREY!}}
:{{text|say|Lord Godfrey|Something that should have been done a long time ago, you filthy animal.}}

:{{text|say|Lord Godfrey|NOW JOIN YOUR MISTRESS IN DEATH!}}
:''Lord Godfrey's group joins in combat, attacking Cromush and the val'kyr. Eventually they are defeated.''
:{{text|yell|Lord Godfrey|FALL BACK, BROTHERS! TO SHADOWFANG!}}
:{{text|yell|Lord Godfrey|This land will quiver and shake in the wake of our destruction!}}
:{{text|say|High Warlord Cromush|Fix her... FIX HER!}}
:{{text|say|Agatha|We are bound to her, sisters...}}
:{{text|say|Arthura|It will destroy us, sister...}}
:{{text|say|Daschla|It is our sacred duty. The pact was sealed, the bargain made...}}
:{{text|say|Arthura|Then let it be done.}}
:''The group of val'kyr resurrects Sylvanas, sacrificing themselves in the process.''
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|I saw... only darkness.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|And as I drifted towards nothingness, a brilliant light appeared, then another, and another... My dear val'kyr.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|I know now - beyond a shadow of a doubt - that the val'kyr are our future.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|We will never stop fighting for Lordaeron. Never...}}
