==Objectives==
Raise 15 [[Forsaken]] by killing [[human]]s on [[Fenris Isle]].
* Forsaken raised (15)

==Description==
Fenris Isle stands defiantly at the heart of [[Lordamere Lake]] - a cruel memory of a time long since passed.

Though no longer infested by [[gnoll]] vermin, a new threat has emerged. Human refugees, driven from their holdings in [[Hillsbrad Foothills|Hillsbrad]], have fled to Fenris Isle in hopes of escaping defeat at our hands. A critical error on their part.

You are to take {{NPC||Agatha}} with you to Fenris Isle and slaughter all humans. She will raise the fallen as Forsaken, bolstering our forces in the process.

Do not fail me, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1150 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Victory!

==Completion==
