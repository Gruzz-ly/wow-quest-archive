== Objectives ==
Find the Ambermill Dimensional Portal.
* [[Dalaran Archmage's Signet Ring]] (provided)

== Description ==
<Sylvanas hands you the signet ring.>

Take the ring and make your way to Beren's Peril, southeast of here, located in a cave in the hills. Once there, search the cave for the portal to the pocket dimension that conceals the [[Ambermill]] magi.

I will communicate with you through your thoughts, <name>. Once you have reached the portal I will give you your marching orders.

== Progress ==
<The portal hums.>

== Completion ==

<The Banshee Queen's voice invades your thoughts.>

Yes, this is it. Now run the ring along the runes of the portal and you should become attuned for transdimensional travel.
