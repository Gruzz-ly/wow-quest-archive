==Objectives==
Kill every Scarlet that has a beating heart.
*[[Scarlet Crusade]] routed (0/100%)
*Meet Lilian Voss Ouside Fenris Keep

==Description==
Now it's time for them to pay. They'll wish they never set foot in our lands and threatened our home.

We will drive them out, we will drive them into the ground, and we will leave them to rot.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Completion==
Sometimes, the only way to get through to people is in the language they understand.

And the Scarlet Crusade hears strength.

But those are just the followers. We need to reach the leaders of this brazen invasion and deliver the message, too.

==Notes==
Belmont and Velonara join the adventurer, and the other soldiers move out to join the fight.
