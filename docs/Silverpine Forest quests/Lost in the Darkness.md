==Objectives==
Rescue 6 Orc Sea Dogs from the [[Skittering Dark]].
* [[Orc Sea Dog]] rescued (6)

==Description==
Some would say that we are lucky to be alive. Those people would be idiots. At least had we died we would not have had to face the [[Warchief]]'s wrath. Alas, what's done is done! Now we must attempt to regain our lost honor.

The third ship in our fleet sank off the coast of the Skittering Dark, northwest of here. Those that made it to shore quickly found themselves swarmed by the giant spiders of the area and encased in webbing.

If there are survivors we must free them! Go, <name>! To the Skittering Dark!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||10}}
* 930 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]
* +350 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Thankfully we're almost out of ale.

==Completion==
Lok'tar, <name>! Once the ale wears off my orcs will be ready!

==Notes==
Damage the Webbed Victim to free the Orc Sea Dogs. They may however also have a hostile Bloodfang Scavenger in the web pod.

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Command: Silverpine Forest!}}
