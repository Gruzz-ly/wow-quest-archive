==Objectives==
Kill 50 [[Vile Fin tribe|Vile Fin Murlocs]].
* Bat requisitioned from Bat Handler Maggotbreath
* Vile Fin Murloc slain (50)

==Description==
The concoction is finally ready, but before I can put my seal of approval on this strain, we'll need to run a field test.

Speak to {{NPC||Bat Handler Maggotbreath}}, here at [[Forsaken High Command|High Command]], and requisition a bat. The bat will take you to the [[Dawning Isles]], east of here across [[Lordamere Lake]], right into the heart of depravity itself - the Vile Fin murloc dens!

Use the concoction against the murlocs and report the results back to me.

Those results being that you killed them all, as commanded!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Muckdweller Spear
|Maggot-Ridden Leggings
|T'veen's Cloak
|Maggot-Ridden Greaves
}}

You will also receive:
* 930 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Have you exterminated the Vile Fin murlocs of the Dawning Isles?

==Completion==
Potent enough to exterminate a thousand murlocs! I think I'll put that on the label. You've done well, <name>, and great work around here gets rewarded.

==Notes==
Head down the hill and talk to Maggotbreath at {{co|57.9|8.7|Silverpine Forest}}:
:What do you want? Can't you see I have bat droppings to clean up?
:{{gossip|I need to take a bat to the Dawning Isles.}}
:{{text|say|Bat handler Maggotbreath|You better bring that bat back in one piece, <name>!}}

On the bat, players have two abilities as it circles the Dawning Isles, which are carpeted with Vile Fin murlocs:
*{{abilities|Blight Concoction|range=80|Inflicts 875 to 1125 Nature damage to all Vile Fin murlocs within a 10 yard radius.|notes=Instant}}
*{{abilities|Go Home|Command the Forsaken Bat to take you back to Forsaken High Command.}}

:{{Text|bossemote|Eliminate all murlocs by using the Blight Concoction!}}

The Blight Concoction is a ground-targeted AoE, so take out enough murlocs to complete the quest objective. The bat will then automatically return to Forsaken High Command.
:{{text|bossemote|Returning to Forsaken High Command!}}

The next quest is offered by {{NPC||Deathstalker Commander Belmont}}, to the northeast, near the bat handler.

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Command: Silverpine Forest!}}
