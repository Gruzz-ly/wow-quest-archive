==Objectives==
Report back to [[Fahrad]] at [[Ravenholdt Manor]].

==Description==
The job is done. Better return to [[Ravenholdt]] and notify Fahrad.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4700 [[XP]]
*{{cost||75}}
*[[Rune of the Coterie]]
*[[Filcher's Cowl]]

==Completion==
It seems all has gone according to plan. Good work.

All we can do now is wait for [[Caius Blackwood|Caius]] to make his next move. I will notify you when that time comes. Your commitment to the manor has not been entirely fulfilled.

For now, however, you can rest easy.
