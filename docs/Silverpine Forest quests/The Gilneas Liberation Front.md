==Description==
The battle over this region still rages, <name>nub. Although we soundly beat back the [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilnean]] defenses and took [[Ruins of Gilneas|Gilneas]] for the [[Horde]], a small group of rebels managed to escape. The "[[Gilneas Liberation Front]]" - as they call themselves - make attacks of opportunity against our forces in the field. The rebels have had a few minor victories and now grow brazen in their assaults! The time to strike back is now, <name>nub.

Venture south into the wilds of [[Silverpine Forest|Silverpine]] and kill any rebel that you cross.
