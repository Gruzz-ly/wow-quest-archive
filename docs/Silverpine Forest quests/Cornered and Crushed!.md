Report to [[Master Forteski]] at the [[Deep Elem Mine]] in [[Silverpine Forest]].

== Description ==
<{{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||The Banshee Queen}} speaks through your mind.>

We must act quickly, <name>. They mustn't be given the chance to flee. I am dispatching a squadron of my most powerful troopers to the Deep Elem Mine. I'm also sending the Horseman with them to ensure that nothing goes wrong. Meet him at the Deep Elem Mine, east of [[Olsen's Farthing]], and CRUSH those rats.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||17}}

== Completion ==
I 'spose we're to corner them first then crush, eh?
