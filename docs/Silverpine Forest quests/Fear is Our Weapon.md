==Objectives==
Frighten Scarlet Recruits and slay them.
*Pick a [[Banshee]]
*[[Scarlet Recruit]]s or [[Scarlet Trainer|Trainers]] slain (12)

==Description==
The [[Scarlet Crusade]] is recruiting. Apparently, when you want to blame all your problems on someone else, people flock to the lies.

But that's a choice that they're going to live to regret. We're not the problem here. THEY attacked OUR home.

Take one of the banshees with you. Between the two of you, those recruits will be scared to death.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Have you thinned out those Scarlet recruits?

==Completion==
It's better to kill something dangerous before it spreads. Now [[Fenris Isle]] is on its own, and not getting fresh blood.

It's time for the next phase of our plan.

==Notes==
Choose [[Emalora]], [[Angellene]], or [[Margix]].

Each gives the Banshee Wail extra action button. Head to [[Valgan's Field]] and use the ability to make them {{Abilities|Terrified!|id=406326|icon=ui_darkshore_warfront_horde_banshee}}:
