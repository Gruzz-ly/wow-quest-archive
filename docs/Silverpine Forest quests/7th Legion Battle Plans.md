== Objectives ==
Recover the 7th Legion Battle Plan.
* [[7th Legion Battle Plan]]

== Description ==
While destroying [[Pyrewood Village|Pyrewood]] will certainly garner us an advantage over the [[Alliance]] upon the field of battle, our true purpose here is to leave them crippled.

Southwest of here, near the [[Greymane Wall]], lies the [[7th Legion Base Camp]]. We must search the base camp for battle plans. With the 7th Legion battle plans we will be able to pinpoint all [[Alliance]] troop advancement in [[Silverpine Forest]].

== Progress ==
Search every filthy dwarven corpse.

== Completion ==
<Walden flips through the battle plan.>

It looks like the reinforcements from the ships in [[Ruins of Gilneas|Gilneas]] are marching soon. [[Darius Crowley|Crowley]] and [[Ivar Bloodfang|Bloodfang]] have set up an encampment to the southeast for the [[Gilneas Liberation Front|Gilneas Liberation front]].
