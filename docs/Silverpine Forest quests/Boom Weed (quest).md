==Objectives==
Collect 6 Boom Weed in [[Silverpine Forest]].
*[[Boom Weed]] (6)

==Description==
You've heard of [[:Gloom Weed]], you've heard of [[:Doom Weed]], now it's time for... Boom Weed!

That's right, another variety grows right here in Silverpine! And it can be used in combination with our alchemical formulas for a very incendiary outcome.

Go and collect some for me. Just mind your eyebrows. You don't really need any eyebrows, do you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Have you found all the Boom Weed I need? I cannot wait to mix this up.

==Completion==
Wonderful! And I see you still have your eyebrows. I think. I'm sure you can get some new ones stitched on if you really want to.

Now, let us commence with the alchemy!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Master Apothecary Faranell|Remember, if it explodes in your face, that means it's working!}}

Head to [[Olsen's Farthing]] and find the Boom Weed on the field. As Faranell warned, it explodes with Boom.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Calia Menethil|Master Apothecary, are you sure this concoction will not harm our own?}}
:{{Text|say|Master Apothecary Faranell|Science is never perfectly safe, but it won't harm us.}}

==Progression==
{{Forsaken heritage}}
