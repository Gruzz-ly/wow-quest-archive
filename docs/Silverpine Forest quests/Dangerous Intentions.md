==Objectives==
Find {{NPC||Deathstalker Yorick}} at the [[Ivar Patch]] in [[Silverpine Forest]].

==Description==
Do you know why Mortuus appends 'nub' to your name, <name>? Because he is an incompetent sycophant that has trouble seeing through his oversized helmet. 'NUB' is your classification. You are now part of the NEW UNDERCITY BATALLION{{sic}}.

But enough with the comedy! I sent Deathstalker Yorick on a shadow operation two days ago. Her goal was to get information on the [[Gilneas Liberation Front]] and return. Three days and no word from her.

Head southwest to the Ivar Patch and look for Yorick, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Belmont gets a little nervous and sends some newbie to look for me? Listen, I've been stalking out the old Ivar cottage from inside this outhouse for three days. Your presence threatens the whole damn operation!

There's no time to explain. We have to act now or this mission will be compromised.

==Notes==
Not very far to the southwest of [[Forsaken High Command|High Command]]...

"nub" is a frequently used slang for noob.

Commander Belmont talks about giving Deathstalker Yorick an order two days ago but didn't hear him in three days. The logic is that 'today' is the third day after the order was issued.
