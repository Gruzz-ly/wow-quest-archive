==Objectives==
Gather 8 Ferocious Doomweed.
* [[Ferocious Doomweed]] (8)

==Description==
You have no doubt heard about the [[Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate|incident]] that transpired at the [[Angrathar the Wrathgate|Wrath Gate]] in [[Northrend]], yes? Due to those unfortunate events we are strictly forbidden from using the strain of life-shattering blight that we finally perfected. Now we have rules and regulations and other nonsense!

They've given us some neutered version of the perfected blight and expect us to weaponize it.

If I'm to get this crap functional I'll need several bags full of ferocious doomweed. You'll find it all over [[Silverpine Forest|Silverpine]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||4}}
* 875 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Have you collected the ferocious doomweed I requested?

==Completion==
Agony abounds, friend! The land itself threatens to devour us, and yet we persist. I wonder why that is? With this doomweed and the guts that {{NPC||High Apothecary Shana T'veen||T'veen}} needs, we might have something suitable to send to the Forsaken front.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Gilneas Liberation Front]] and [[Guts and Gore]] before heading out.

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Command: Silverpine Forest!}}
