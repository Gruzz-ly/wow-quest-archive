While the [[Scarlet Crusade]] have taken [[Fenris Isle]], they try to intimidate and cow our people in [[Silverpine Forest]].

We cannot let them win either by strength or by terror.

When you collect materials for [[Faranell]]'s concoction, destroy any slanderous propaganda you find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones

==Progress==
Have you cleared the field of those pamphlets?

==Completion==
Words have power. Power that can be taken away, when the words are also taken away.

Our people have suffered enough by ink and blade.

==Notes==
Head to [[Olsen's Farthing]] and find the propaganda on trees and buildings. It can be read, but otherwise use the rifle on the letters.

==Progression==
{{Forsaken heritage}}
