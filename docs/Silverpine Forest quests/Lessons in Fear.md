== Objectives ==
Kill 12 7th Legion Scouts.
* [[7th Legion Scout]] slain (12)

== Description ==
Our enemies are becoming smarter - adapting to our tactics. Recently an attack was made upon [[Pyrewood Village]], southwest of here. Our troops occupying the town were decimated, of course, but what made the attack especially interesting was the racial composition of the attacking force. No humans were used.

<Walden laughs.>

Rightfully, they fear being reanimated as Forsaken.

Let us teach the non-humans a lesson in fear. Together we will show them what happens to corpses that we cannot use.

== Progress ==
Pyrewood Village must be reduced to ashes and our enemies slain!

== Completion ==
I suspect we'll see fewer humans at the Battlefront. The risk for these cowards is too great.

==Progression==
