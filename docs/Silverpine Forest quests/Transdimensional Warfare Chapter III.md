==Objectives==
Kill [[Archmage Ataeric]] to bring down the Transdimensional Shield.
* Transdimensional Shield destroyed

==Description==
<Sylvanas speaks directly through you.>

You must find the being responsible for keeping this dimensional pocket active. Likely that fool, Ataeric... Search the compound for him. Should you find him, do what you must to stop him from channeling his magic. Though he will be unable to attack you directly, he will surely send his minions after you. Defend yourself and bring down that shield! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Vessel of the Dark Lady
|Ataeric's Gloves
|Transdimensional Cloak}}

==Completion==
Had I not witnessed what you did with my own eyes I would not have believed it, <name>. Now, with the Ambermill magi on our side, there is but one thing left to do before we retake [[Ruins of Gilneas|Gilneas]] and send those [[Alliance]] dogs running for [[Stormwind]].
