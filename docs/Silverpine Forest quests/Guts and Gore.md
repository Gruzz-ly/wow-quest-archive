==Objectives==
Recover 6 "Clean" Beast Guts.
* [["Clean" Beast Guts]] (6)

==Description==
If we're to get this new blight up and running we'll need clean beast guts. The problem is that clean beast guts are a rare commodity in [[Silverpine Forest]]. Most of the beasts here have succumbed to disease and thus only have diseased organs.

Do a sweep of the forested area east of here for worgs and grizzled bears. Kill only the non-diseased variety and rip out their entrails. Bring me all of the clean guts that you can stuff into your backpack!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||4}}
* 875 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Remember, I can only use clean beast guts for the new strain of blight we're developing.

==Completion==
Excellent! With these guts and the ferocious doomweed we'll be able to test out our new strain of blight. Now to select a suitable target...

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Gilneas Liberation Front]] and [[Agony Abounds]] before heading out.

==Progression==
