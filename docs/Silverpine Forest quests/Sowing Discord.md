== Objectives ==
Assassinate General Marstone.
* [[General Marstone]] slain

== Description ==
The [[Alliance]] reinforcements have established a foothold in the southwest region of [[Silverpine Forest|Silverpine]] called [[7th Legion Base Camp]]. Our primary goal at the base camp is to sow discord amongst the troops. This is a lightning fast assassination mission to kill their field commander, General Marstone. His death won't stop the Alliance advance, but it will certainly soften their ranks.

== Progress ==
Marstone is a decorated field general. He will not go down easy.

== Completion ==
The rest of the Alliance fleet will arrive shortly, only to find their base camp decimated. Now for the second and most important part of our plan.

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Command: Silverpine Forest!}}
