==Objectives==
Recover 5 Sea Dog Crates.

Speak with {{NPC||Admiral Hatchet}} to get another Orc Sea Pup if you unexpectedly lose yours.
* [[Sea Dog Crate]] recovered (5)

==Description==
We may not have to live down the shame of this defeat, <name>. The Warchief will likely have us all executed instead.

I'll be damned if we don't go down without a fight. Although the whole beachhead is overrun by [[Bloodfang pack|Bloodfang]] [[worgen]], there may still be hope. I want you to accompany one of our sea pups to the [[North Tide's Beachhead|Beachhead]], directly west of here, and recover our supplies. Return to me when the pup can carry no more.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Steel Thunder Belt
|Bloodfang Vest
|Sober Pup Wristbands
|Steel Thunder Chestbrace
}}

You will also receive:
* 900 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]
* +250 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
The pups might be the only orcs nut drunk at this base.

==Completion==
Within these creates are held STEEL THUNDER! With our weaponry returned we might have a chance to redeem ourselves.

==Notes==
