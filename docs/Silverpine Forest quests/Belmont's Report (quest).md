==Objectives==
Deliver Belmont's Report to {{NPC||Lady Sylvanas Windrunner}} at [[Forsaken High Command]] in [[Silverpine Forest]].
* [[Belmont's Report]] (provided)

==Description==
<Belmont hands you a sealed envelope.>

Deliver this report to Lady Sylvanas Windrunner. It is my assessment of the situation in Silverpine based upon your and {{NPC||Rane Yorick||Yorick's}} field work.

If we do not stamp out the [[worgen]] insurgents, they will overrun us. The time to act is now!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 100 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Kneel before your queen, <name>.

==Completion==
{{NPC||Darius Crowley||Crowley}}... A gnat. An insect, waiting to be crushed beneath my boot heel.

So he thinks to rouse the feral worgen of Silverpine? We shall show him and his allies the might of the [[Forsaken]]!

But first we must clean up the mess made by the {{NPC||Garrosh Hellscream||Warchief's}} fleet. Without their aid we may lose this war.

==Notes==
Completing this quest also awards the Forsaken High Command criterion of [[Silverpine Forest Quests]].
