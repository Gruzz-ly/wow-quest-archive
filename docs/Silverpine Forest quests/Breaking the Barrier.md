== Objectives ==
Find the Ambermill Codex.
* [[Ambermill Codex]]

== Description ==
While [[Vincent Godfrey|Godfrey]] and I make preparations for our assault upon [[Ruins of Gilneas|Gilneas]], I want you to lead our attack upon [[Ambermill]], directly east of here.

The former [[Dalaran]] magi of Ambermill have erected a magical barrier that somehow cloaks them from vision. They currently reside within some type of pocket dimension, awaiting orders from the [[Alliance]] to begin their attack. We must prevent their assault by making a pre-emptive strike. Venture to Ambermill and find information that would grant us access to the mages.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||18}}

== Progress ==
Have you found anything yet?

== Completion ==
Clever mages. The codex is sealed by a magical ward.

Pity that they weren't clever enough to realize that former archmages of Dalaran are now Forsaken.

==Progression==
