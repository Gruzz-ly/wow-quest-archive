==Objectives==
Speak to Velonara to call in the full force of the [[Forsaken]].
*Speak to [[Velonara]]

==Description==
With the [[island]]'s defenses weakened and the [[Scarlet Cannon (heritage)|cannon]]s and [[Scarlet Archmage (heritage)|mages]] silenced, we're ready to safely bring in our troops once more.

You didn't think you would have to fight all of them by yourself, did you?

I know you could, but leave some for the rest of us, too.

When you're ready to call the others in, let me know.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 850 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Completion==
They thought we would stay in our walls and hide?

Childish pretenders. Now we'll show them the might of the Forsaken.

==Notes==
Speak with Velonara again:
:{{Gossip|quest=|I'm ready.}}
:''A cutscene plays out showing the Forsaken force, composed of [[Forsaken Deathguard (heritage)|Forsaken Deathguards]], [[Forsaken Alchemist (heritage)|Forsaken Alchemists]], [[Dark Ranger (heritage)|Dark Rangers]], and [[Banshee (heritage)|Banshees]], invading the isle and killing the Scarlets. [[Belmont]] joins up and kills a [[Scarlet Champion (heritage)|Scarlet Champion]].''
