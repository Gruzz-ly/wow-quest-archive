==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Apothecary Hummel.jpg|Apothecary Hummel|This mad scientist wants to poison the world with perfumes.}}
Speak to Snagglebolt to enter the Crown Chemical Co. battle and defeat Apothecary Hummel.
* Speak with [[Inspector Snip Snagglebolt|Snagglebolt]] to begin the [[Crown Chemical Co.]] battle (Optional)
* [[Apothecary Hummel]] defeated
* Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
We're never gonna see an end to this unless we take on the boss himself.

Look, Apothecary Hummel is holed up in [[Shadowfang Keep]] with his cronies. He's working on a new batch of poisonous perfumes, and they'll knock out all of [[Stormwind]] if we let him finish his research.

You go do what you do best, pal. Get in there and foil his schemes before we're all lavender-scented corpses.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||2|20}}
* 400 [[XP]]
* 50x [[Love Token]]

==Progress==
You ready to see what Hummel is cooking? I guarantee you it's not as pretty as it smells.

==Completion==
Sounds like you got there just in time--great work.

This would have gotten real ugly if Hummel poisoned the entire gala.

Let's just call this our gift to them, eh?

==Notes==
Use [[Dungeon Finder]] to queue for the special holiday encounter, listed as "The Crown Chemical Co." The encounter has not properly scaled up for the current era, and all three "bosses" will fall over in twenty seconds or so.

After the encounter, Snip has returned to the [[Gala of Gifts]] outside [[Stormwind City]].
