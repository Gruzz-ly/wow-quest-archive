*[[Eye of Bhossca]]

==Description==
<A note sits in the chest>

Glad to have you back, <name>.

The latest object of my desire is an artifact known as the Eye of Bhossca. My sources tell me the eye is somewhere within the Scarlet Monastery. As with {{C|Shadowfang Keep}}, you must infiltrate the monastery alone.

It may behoove you to find a disguise before going in. It will make getting around a touch easier. I'm sure you could find something on the monastery's grounds.

Return the eye here, and payment will be delivered as before.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<The chest sits, empty.>

==Completion==
<You place The Eye of Bhossca into the chest>

==Notes==
===Obtaining the quest===
In order to obtain this quest, you must first reach level 30, at which point you will receive another letter from "C" in the mail. This quest will only appear after reading the letter:
{{Book|Return Customer|content=
Hello again, <name>,

I'm sure a rogue of your talents stays quite busy these days, so I'll get right to the point.

I have another job for you. This one is a touch more involved than your foray into Shadowfang Keep, but your pay will be raised accordingly.

If you're interested, return to the cabin beside Pyrewood Village. You'll find your briefing in the same dead drop as before.

Regards,<br>
-C

===Completing the quest===
To obtain the Eye, the Rogue must sneak through parts of Scarlet Monastery to the [[Padlocked Reliquary]] in the [[Gallery of Treasures]] within the [[Scarlet Monastery Library]]. This ''must'' be done solo.
*A [[Scarlet Initiate's Uniform]] can be obtained from the [[Supply Locker]] in the stables behind the monastery, making the Scarlet Crusaders mostly non-hostile.
*Opening the reliquary requires obtaining a series of keys. First, [[Pick Pocket]] a [[Scarlet Scryer]] in the [[Scarlet Monastery Graveyard]] to obtain the [[Scryer's Key]], used to open [[Personal Letterbox]] in the library wing's [[Athenaeum (Scarlet Monastery)|Athenaeum]]. Following the directions on the [[Confidential Message]] found within allows the [[Stone Coffer]] in a crypt in the [[Forlorn Cloister]] of the graveyard wing to be opened, which contains the [[Reliquary Key]].
