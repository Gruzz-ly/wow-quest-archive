==Objectives==
Use the Artisanal Bon-Bombs to destroy [[Crown Chemical Company|Crown]] supplies and kill Crown members.
* Artisanal Bon-Bombs taken
* Crown operations disrupted (0/100%)

==Description==
;Newcomer
:Looks like Hummel's got some security. But don't worry, I came with some special gifts to deliver.
:<Snagglebolt points to the unmarked box.>
:Bombs. I got bombs.
:Playtime's over. Take those bombs and toss 'em at the Crown and their supplies. Let's give them a look at what genuine craftsmanship can do. Once we've cleared out their operations, we can move in on Hummel.
;Returner
:Looks like Hummel's got even more security now. Seems like the Crown thinks extra bodies are cheaper than moving. But don't worry, I came with some artisanally-crafted "gifts."
:<Snagglebolt points to the unmarked box.>
:Bombs. I got bombs.
:Play time's over. Go blast the hell out of the Crown and their supplies. Show 'em what genuine craftsmanship can do. Once we've cleared out their operations, we can move in on Hummel.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||1|65}}
* 300 [[XP]]
* 50x [[Love Token]]
* [[Dangerous Love]]

==Progress==
We need to put a stop to this before the Crown pulls off their smelly sabotage.

==Completion==
Man, I love a good fireworks show! Great job, <name>. That oughta slow them down.

Now there's just Hummel to deal with.

==Notes==
Speak with Snip again:
{{book|content=I don't like this place one bit. Smells like corpse-flavored scented candles.

{{gossip|quest=|Do you have any more bombs?}}

Yeah, they're in the chest there. Take another look.}}

Interact with the [[Box of Artisanal Goods]] to pick up the [[Artisanal Bon-Bombs]] and the [[Note from Bang Sparknozzle]], which reads:
{{book|content=<Name>,

Each of these exquisite specialty Bon-Bombs was lovingly crafted with care, painstakingly designed to bring joy and destruction with every blast. 

The secret ingredient? Why love, of course.

And nitroglycerin. A LOT of nitroglycerin.

If you find yourself needing more of these, come find me at the Gala of Gifts.

Have a blast!
