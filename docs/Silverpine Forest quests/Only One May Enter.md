== Objectives ==
Take the Dalaran Archmage's Signet Ring to [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner]] at the [[Forsaken Front]] in [[Silverpine Forest]].
* [[Dalaran Archmage's Signet Ring]] (provided)

== Description ==
<Dalar flips through the codex.>

HAHAH!

Oh... That's bad.

<Dalar closes the codex and looks up at you.>

With this ring only ONE may enter the pocket dimension at [[Amber Mill]]. That person will then need to fight through an army of magi and kill the archmage that is generating the phase from the inside. Only then will the dimension fold, ejecting all of the magi.

The portal to entry is hidden at the back of a cave in [[Beren's Peril]].

That's all I know. Take the ring back to Sylvanas.

== Progress ==
What have you learned?

== Completion ==
Only one may enter? I know just the person for this mission.

<Sylvanas nods at you.>

I will prepare our forces and have them at the ready.

==Progression==
