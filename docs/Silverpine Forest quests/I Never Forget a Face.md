==Objectives==
Give the Partially Digested Head to [[Lord Godfrey]] in [[Silverpine Forest]].
*[[Partially Digested Head]] (provided)

==Description==
You have discovered a partially digested head. Lord Godfrey perks up when he sees it. Perhaps you should give it to him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1450 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|900}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Undercity}}

==Progress==
I never forget a face!

==Completion==
I know that face, <name>. This head belongs to a former [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilnean]] known as [[Sean Dempsey]]. He was imprisoned with [[Darius Crowley|Crowley]] before the great outbreak.

I wonder if it would be possible to put him back together. The rest of him must be in the belly of these [[crocolisk]]s.
