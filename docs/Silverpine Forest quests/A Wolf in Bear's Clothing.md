== Objectives ==
Kill 10 Inconspicuous Bears.
* [[Inconspicuous Bear]] slain (10)

== Description ==
These [[worgen]] take us for fools! One would think that only an idiot would mistake one of their [[druid]]s in [[Bear Form|bear form]] as a real bear. Unfortunately, there are many idiots here at the [[Forsaken Front]]. We've already lost a few battalions to organized worgen bear attacks. Yes, it's even more idiotic than it sounds.

Directly east of here, heading towards [[Hillsbrad Foothills|Hillsbrad]], you will find worgen druids roaming the woods, masquerading as bears. Kill them and make our southern supply line safe again.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Unmistakable Gloves
|"Bear" Hide Boots
|Inconspicuous Pantaloons
|Inconspicuous Footguards
}}

You will also receive:
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
* +250 reputation with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]
*5x [["Bear" Steaks]]

== Progress ==
Have you killed the "bears?"

== Completion ==
I only hope that we don't end up getting beat down by inconspicuous [[Flight Form|birds]], [[Cat Form|cats]] and [[Tree of Life Form|trees]] next... or [[Aquatic Form|seals]]. Could you imagine it?

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Command: Silverpine Forest!}}
