==Objectives==
Meet [[Detective Snap Snagglebolt|Detective Snagglebolt]] at the entrance to [[Shadowfang Keep]] in [[Silverpine Forest]].

==Description==
Those clues add up to an ugly story, <name>.

That map shows the Crown's got a heavily guarded base of operations in Silverpine Forest. And between that memo and formula, it looks like they're cooking up something intoxicatingly toxic.

I've got a gal that can get us some... artisanal goods... to deal with the Crown. I'll go talk to him and meet you outside Shadowfang Keep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||5}}
* 30 [[XP]]

==Completion==
There you are, right on time.
