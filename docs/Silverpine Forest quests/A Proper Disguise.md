{{questportrait|Lieutenant Hawlsey.jpg|Lieutenant Hawlsey|Leads the Scarlet training in Valgan's Field. Has some nice armor you can steal.}}
==Objectives==
Slay [[Lieutenant Hawlsey]] at [[Valgan's Field]] and take their armor.
*[[Hawlsey's Armor]]

==Description==
Our plan is to send you to [[Fenris Isle]], but first, you must look the part.

We've scouted out a group of [[Scarlet Crusade|Scarlet]] solders{{sic}} training in Valgan's Field, supervised by a [[lieutenant]]. That lieutenant's armor should let you walk deep behind enemy lines, unnoticed.

Take it from them, however you see fit. I don't need to know how.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 8,500 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=15|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Have you acquired your Scarlet disguise?

==Completion==
That's one Scarlet [[officer]] that can't cause more trouble for the [[Forsaken]], and now you can look the part.

Next, let's hope that we can get you on that island without any fuss.

==Notes==
