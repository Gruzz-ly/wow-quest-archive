==Objectives==
Find the [[Refugee Leadership]] inside [[Fenris Keep]].
* Human Leaders found

==Description==
You must strike at their leaders, <name>. You will find them holed up in the old keep. Battle your way inside and find the holdouts! Turn them for your queen!

None shall escape the mighty grasp of the [[Forsaken]]!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sword of Insurgence
|Flesh and Bone
|Staff of the Formidable Opponent}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost||17}}
* 1,100 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
What have you to report?

==Completion==
It would seem that Crowley is more formidable than I anticipated. Still, he is a man - flesh and bone - full of secrets. Secrets that I know all about...

You have served me well, <name>. I could use someone of your ability at the [[Sepulcher]]. I have a plan to deal with Crowley and his insurgents once and for all. Will you help?

==Notes==
Make your way to the top of the keep, going into cinematic mode when you're at the top.
