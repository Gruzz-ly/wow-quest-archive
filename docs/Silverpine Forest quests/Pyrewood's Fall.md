==Objectives==
Use the Bundle of Torches to torch the Pyrewood Town Hall, Pyrewood Inn and Pyrewood Chapel.
* [[Pyrewood Inn]] torched
* [[Pyrewood Chapel]] torched
* [[Pyrewood Town Hall]] torched
* [[Bundle of Torches]] (provided)

==Description==
The attacks against our front are a distraction. With our attention turned towards the worgen onslaught, the Alliance has managed to take [[Pyrewood Village]] from our occupying forces.

<Godfrey hands you a bundle of torches.>

It must be purged.

With these torches we will burn Pyrewood Village to the ground, leaving only ashes for the enemy to hide behind.

Let us not waste another minute. Pyrewood Village is located southwest of the [[Forsaken Front]]. Lead us there, <name>.

==Progress==
I feel no remorse.

==Completion==
The part of me that was Gilnean died at [[Tempest's Reach]]. Only vengeance remains, <name>. To that end, we have work to do. Spare me your pointless queries.

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Command: Silverpine Forest!}}
