==Objectives==
Collect 12 Plagued Flesh from nearby wildlife.
*[[Plagued Flesh]] (12)

==Description==
We of the [[Royal Apothecary Society|Royal Apothecaries]] have synthesized many nuanced plagues in recent years, in keeping with our agreement with the [[Desolate Council]] not to... overdo it.

But when it comes to rooting out [[Scarlet Crusade|Scarlet]] assailants, there really is nothing like the classic. The original plague that exists -- mostly -- only in the diseased tissue of surviving descendants.

Go, gather up samples from this marvelous wildlife and bring them to me. I can put them to greater use.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
I remember the days when we had unfettered license to experiment and brew as we wished... ah, perhaps one day again. Have you found those plague samples?

==Completion==
Excellent! Ah, I can still smell that original plague formula. It brings back such pleasant memories.

Toxifying the ambient air, melting the living down to their bones, how I miss those days - err - did I say that out loud?

==Notes==
Head to [[Olsen's Farthing]] and kill [[Sickly Deer (Silverpine Forest)|Sickly Deer]], [[Plagued Wolf|Plagued Wolves]], and [[Plagued Bear]]s to loot the flesh.

==Progression==
