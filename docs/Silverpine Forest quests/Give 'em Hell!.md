==Objectives==
Kill 10 Bloodfang Scavengers.
* [[Bloodfang Scavenger]] (10)

==Description==
It's the [[goblin]]s' fault, <race>!

<hic!>

You see, we set off for [[Silverpine Forest|Silverpine]] from [[Bilgewater Harbor]], over in [[Azshara]]. Huge mistake that was! Never has such a den of inequity and sin existed in our great empire. Those damnable goblins fueled our every vice and set us off to sail with barrels full of ale.

<hic!>

The shame of it all leaves a mark greater than any scar. Honor must be restored! Kill the [[Bloodfang pack|Bloodfang]] [[worgen]] that ambushed us. They're scavenging the wreckage to the southwest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||5}}
* 900 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]
* +500 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Give 'em hell, <race>!

==Completion==
Looks as if you really gave those worgen a beating and, in the process, lifted the "shame haze" they cast over us. Perhaps the sea dogs will quit drinkin' now.

Who am I kidding?

Hah!
