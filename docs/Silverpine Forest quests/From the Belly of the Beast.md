==Objectives==
Recover Dempsey's Torso, Dempsey's Appendages and Dempsey's Giblets.
*[[Dempsey's Torso]]
*[[Dempsey's Appendages]]
*[[Dempsey's Giblets]]

==Description==
I think we can rebuild him. Perhaps if we put him back together he can give us information about [[Darius Crowley|Crowley]].

We must kill every [[crocolisk]] in this marsh until we find the rest of [[Sean Dempsey]]'s body! From the belly of the beast this man will be reborn!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Leg Bone Covers
|Bracers of the Million Gold Man
|Vest of Forsaken Necromancy
|Better, Stronger, Faster Bracers
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||11|30}}
* 930 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
At the very least we'll have some crocolisk hides to make fancy shoes out of. 

==Completion==
Now let's see if I can do this.

<Godfrey starts mumbling under his breath.>

...leg bone connects to the thigh bone...

...arm bone to torso...

...sprinkle on a little [[Forsaken]] [[necromancy]]...

TA-DA! 

==Trivia==
*Godfrey's dialogs might be a reference to the ''{{wplink|Dem Bones}}'' spiritual song.
