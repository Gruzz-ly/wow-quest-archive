==Objectives==
Kill 12 Darkwood Lurkers in [[The Darkwood]].  The Darkwood forest is just west of here, across the bridge on the central island.
*[[Darkwood Lurker]] slain (12)

==Description==
We have been trying to get a foothold in The Darkwood for weeks now but that forest is infested with [[spiders]].  Do me a favor and see if you can thin them out enough for us to setup an attack.

Careful out there, I have heard reports of [[Horde]] troops nearby earlier in the week.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|16|54|tbc=1}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Baradin's Wardens]]

==Progress==
Any luck with those spiders?

==Completion==
Nice work on those spiders, <name>.  At this rate, we will be taking that forest in no time.

==Achievements==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
