==Objectives==
Kill Foreman Wellson at the [[Wellson Shipyard]]. The shipyard can be found north of here, on the western coast.
*[[Foreman Wellson]] slain

==Description==
Foreman Wellson has been a pain in our side since we got here. His shipyard holds a large amount of supplies that would be extremely useful to us... if we could get to them.

He keeps a close watch over his minions and makes it very difficult for us to get a foothold on the shipyard. I need you to take out Wellson for good this time. Be careful <name>, we have been receiving reports of dirty Alliance all around the area.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|40|tbc=1}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Hellscream's Reach]]

==Progress==
Were you able to "take care of" Foreman Wellson?

==Completion==
Great work <name>.  I will report your efforts to our highest in command immediately.

==Achievements==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].

==Patch changes==
