* [[Stack of Cannonballs]] (4)

== Description ==
[[Commander Largo|Largo]] and his minions have been stealing our supplies ever since we setup camp here. It's frustrating to say the least.

We have heard reports that he is stockpiling cannonballs in the towers overlooking the water up on his overlook. Can you head up there and try to recover some of them for us?

<name>, don't forget to keep a watch out for Alliance too.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|16|54|tbc=1}}

== Progress ==
Did you find the cannonballs?

== Completion ==
Good job on the recovery effort <name>. These cannonballs should last us a while.
