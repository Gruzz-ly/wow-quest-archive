==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Foreman Wellson.jpg|Foreman Wellson|Once a great man, Foreman Wellson has fallen from grace.}}
Kill Foreman Wellson at the [[Wellson Shipyard]]. The shipyard can be found northwest of here, on the western coast.
*[[Foreman Wellson]] slain

==Description==
Foreman Wellson has been a pain in our side since we got here. His shipyard holds a large amount of supplies that would be extremely useful to us... if we could get to them.

He keeps a close watch over his minions and makes it very difficult for us to get a foothold on the shipyard. I need you to take out Wellson for good this time. Be careful <name>, we have been receiving reports of filthy [[Horde]] all around the area. 

==Progress==
Were you able to "take care of" Foreman Wellson?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1x [[Tol Barad Commendation]]
*{{cost|9|40|}}
*12,870 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Baradin's Wardens]]

==Completion==
Great work <name>.  I will report your efforts to our highest in command immediately.

==Achievements==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].

==Patch changes==
