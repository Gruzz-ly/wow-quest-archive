==Objectives==
[[Sergeant Gray]] has asked you to recover 15 pieces of Shipyard Lumber from the [[Wellson Shipyard]]. The lumber can be recovered from the ghosts in the shipyard or found lying around the premises. The shipyard can be found northwest of here, on the coast.
* [[Shipyard Lumber]] (15)

==Description==
Have you been over to the Wellson Shipyard yet, <name>?  Best to stay away from there unless you have a good reason to venture in. Unfortunately, that is exactly what I need you to do.

You see, we have been short on supplies ever since we recaptured the island. That ghost ridden shipyard is overflowing with lumber but every time we send an escort to recover the lumber, they never make it back.

Can you help us out?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|16|54|tbc=1}}

You will also gain 250 [[reputation]] with the [[Baradin's Wardens]] faction.

==Progress==
Did the ghosts scare you off?

==Completion==
I didn't think you would be able to do it, <name>. You are just full of surprises aren't you?

== Achievements ==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].
