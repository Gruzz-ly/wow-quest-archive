== Objectives ==
Kill 12 Darkwood Lurkers in [[The Darkwood]]. The Darkwood forest is just north of here, across the bridge on the central island.
* [[Darkwood Lurker]] slain (12)

== Description ==
We have been trying to get a foothold in The Darkwood for weeks now but that forest is infested with spiders. Do me a favor and see if you can thin them out enough for us to setup an attack.

Careful out there, I have heard reports of Alliance troops nearby earlier in the week.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|16|54}}, {{cost|tbc=1}}.

== Completion ==
Nice work on those spiders <name>. At this rate, we will be taking that forest in no time.

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
