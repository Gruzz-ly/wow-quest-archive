== Objectives ==
Collect 4 Sticky Silk Glands from [[Darkwood Broodmother]] spiders in [[The Darkwood]]. The Darkwood forest is just west of [[Hellscream's Grasp|here]], across the bridge on the central island.
* [[Sticky Silk Gland]] (4)

== Description ==
Finding supplies on the island has been difficult, to say the least.

Fortunately, we have found a good supply of silk in The Darkwood, just west of here. The bad part of this story is that the silk comes from the glands on Broodmother spiders. I need you to gather 4 of these for me.

That should be just enough to finish up this last set of shirts.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|16|54|tbc=1}}

== Progress ==
Were you able to gather the sticky silk glands?

== Completion ==
These glands will do nicely. We are grateful for your help, <name>.

== Patch changes ==
