==Objectives==
Retrieve 12 Rusty Rifles from [[Farson Hold]] on the north side of [[Tol Barad Peninsula]].
*[[Rusty Rifle]] (12)

==Description==
Battle supplies are hard to come by on this rock.  Every time we hold off another [[horde]] attack, it feels like we are fighting with sticks and stones.

Reports have come in that [[Keep Lord Farson]] on the north side of the island has a large stockpile of rifles that we could use.  Can you head down there and check it out?

Be careful <name>, Farson's followers will do anything to protect him. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|94}}
*1x [[Tol Barad Commendation]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Baradin's Wardens]]

==Progress==
Any luck with those rifles?

==Completion==
Thanks for rounding these up for us, <name>.  Kind of hard to fight a battle without any guns. 

==Achievements==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].
