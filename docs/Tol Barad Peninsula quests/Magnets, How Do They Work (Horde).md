==Objectives==
You have been tasked with recovering 7 pieces of Siege Engine Scrap. Use the Magnetic Scrap Attractor in The Restless Front to find the scraps. The Restless Front is due west, just past the second bridge.
* [[Siege Engine Scrap]] (7)
* [[Magnetized Scrap Collector]] (provided)

==Description==
Getting useful machine parts out here on the island has been difficult, <name>. We have been trying to repair the broken siege engines here in camp but we keep running out of useful parts.

Our second regiment reported some wrecked out siege engines in a old battlefield to the west. Maybe we could find some parts over there?

You are going to have trouble finding anything in that old battlefield so take this magnetic scrap attractor and put it to some good use.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|16|54|tbc=1}}

==Progress==
Did that magnet contraptaion actually work?

==Completion==
These parts will really help us out, <name>!  Who would have thought you can find stuff this useful in all that old junk?
