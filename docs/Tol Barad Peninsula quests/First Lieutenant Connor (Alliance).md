==Description==
The first time I heard about Lt. Connor, I was just a young recruit in the [[Stormwind Stockade|Stormwind stockades]].  None of us could believe he ended up here on [[Tol Barad]].  Sadly, he still roams these wretched islands, wreaking havoc on our troops morale.

I need you to put an end to his misery... and ours.

You will receive: {{cost|16|54|tbc=1}}, 250 reputation with [[Baradin's Wardens]].

==Progress==
Is First Lieutenant Connor a goner?

==Completion==
Hey, you made it back alive!  Can't say you were the first one to try this task, but you are definitely the first one to make it back alive.
