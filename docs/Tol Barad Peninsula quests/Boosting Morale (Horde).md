==Objectives==
You have been asked to recover 6 Barrels of Southsea Rum from the shipwrecks on the [[Cape of Lost Hope]].  The cape can be found north of here, along the coast.
* [[Barrel of Southsea Rum]] (6)

==Description==
Morale is low these days, <name>.  We make every effort we can to keep the troops in high spirits but we are running low on our main supply of morale booster... rum.

I have been getting reports from our infantry to the south that the shipwrecks on the Cape of Lost Hope still have a good supply of southsea rum in their wrecked hulls.  Can you head up there and investigate?

Bring back any rum you can find.

==Progress==
Were you able to recover the rum?  I would try but I am deathly afraid of the water.  Not to mention that [[Tank (shark)|crazy shark]].

==Completion==
This rum will really help us out, <name>.  They might not feel great in the morning but at least they will go to sleep happy.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40|tbc=1}}

You will also gain 250 [[reputation]] with the [[Hellscream's Reach]] faction.

== Notes ==
On accept, you will be buffed with "Water Gliding: Increases swim speed by 50%.  Also allows [[Breath|underwater breathing]].", for 15 minutes.  The barrels are also scattered along the bottom.

== Achievements ==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].
