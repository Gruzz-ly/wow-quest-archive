==Objectives==
Release the spirits of 6 tortured souls at Forgotten Hill. Souls can be channeled by touching your hands directly to the gravestones. Forgotten Hill is due west of here, past The Restless Front.

==Description==
Many soldiers died on this island <name>. It is only fair that we pay our respects to them in any way that we can.

I need you to travel to Forgotten Hill, due west of here and release our brothers in arms' tortured souls away from this place. Do be careful over there, reports of undead have been ongoing in the area.

You will receive:
*{{cost|9|40|tbc=1}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Hellscream's Reach]]

==Progress==
Were you able to release our forgotten brothers in arms?

==Completion==
May their souls rest in peace.

Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].
