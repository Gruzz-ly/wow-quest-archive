== Objectives ==
Find and kill First Lieutenant Connor at [[Forgotten Hill]]. You will find Forgotten Hill on the far west side of the island.
* [[First Lieutenant Connor]] slain

== Description ==
The first time I heard about Lt. Connor, I was just a young recruit in [[Ragefire Chasm]]. None of us could believe he ended up here on [[Tol Barad]]. Sadly, he still roams these wretched islands, wreaking havoc on our troops morale.

I need you to put an end to his misery... and ours.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|16|54}}, {{cost|tbc=1}}.

== Progress ==
Is First Lieutenant Connor a goner?

== Completion ==
Hey, you made it back alive! Can't say you were the first one to try this task, but you are definitely the first one to make it back alive.
