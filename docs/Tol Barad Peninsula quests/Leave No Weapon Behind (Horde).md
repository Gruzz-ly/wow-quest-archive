== Objectives ==
Retrieve 12 Rusty Rifles from [[Farson Hold|Farson Keep]] on the south side of [[Tol Barad Peninsula]].
* [[Rusty Rifle]] (12)

== Description ==
Battle supplies are hard to come by on this rock. Every time we hold off another Alliance attack, it feels like we are fighting with sticks and stones.

Reports have come in that [[Keep Lord Farson]] on the north side of the island has a large stockpile of rifles that we could use. Can you head down there and check it out?

Be careful <name>, Farson's followers will do anything to protect him.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|16|54}}, {{cost|tbc=1}}

== Progress ==
Any luck with those rifles?

== Completion ==
Thanks for rounding these up for us, <name>.  Kind of hard to fight a battle without any guns.

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
