The [[Wellson Shipyard]] is constantly receiving supplies from offshore and we need to put a stop to it. They have setup [[cannon]]s along the [[dock]]s for defense but if you can make it to them, we can use them to destroy their supply [[ship]]s.

Head down there and see what you can do. Report back to me on your progress.

Great work on those supply ships, <name>!  We knew you would be good for somethin' around here.
