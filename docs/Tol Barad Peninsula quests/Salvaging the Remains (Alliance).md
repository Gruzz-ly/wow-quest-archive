==Objectives==
You need to recover 9 Cursed Femur bones from the [[ghoul]]s that inhabit [[Forgotten Hill]].  Forgotten Hill is on the west side of the island, just past [[The Forgotten Front]].
* [[Cursed Femur]] (9) 

==Description==
Forgotten Hill has been overrun with [[zombie]]s and ghouls ever since we reclaimed this wretched isle.  We have tried to clear them out many times but they always seem to come back.

One of our lieutenants recommended taking the ghouls' bones when we kill them in hopes that they can't reincarnate overnight.  Think you can help us out with this one? 

==Progress==
Were you able to recover the femur bones?  Better for you to try than me.

==Completion==
I didn't think you would be able to do it, <name>.  You are just full of surprises aren't you? 

==Gains==
You will receive: {{cost|16|54|tbc=1}}, 250 reputation with [[Baradin's Wardens]].

== Notes ==
Any of the undead at Forgotten Hill will drop femurs.

== Achievements ==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].
