== Description ==
I hate sharks. All of my troops hate sharks too. This is where you come in, <name>.

I need you to head up to the Cape of Lost Hope and take out a huge shark named Tank. Tank is not to be trifled with so I would bring a few friends if I were you.

You will receive: {{cost|16|54|tbc=2}}

== Progress ==
I don't think you guys have a chance against that shark.

== Completion ==
No way, you actually killed him?  We are having shark tacos tonight for sure!
