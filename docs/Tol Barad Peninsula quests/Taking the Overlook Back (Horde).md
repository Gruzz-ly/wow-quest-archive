==Objectives==
Private Sarlosk has asked you to kill [[Commander Largo]] at [[Largo's Overlook]]. The overlook is just Northeast of the base camp.
*[[Commander Largo]] slain

==Description==
There is only one way for us to take Largo's Overlook Back.

I think you know what we need to do, <name>. Largo is pretty paranoid these days so you should be able to find him on top of the tower, looking for his imaginary navy to finally arrive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|16|54|tbc=1}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Hellscream's Reach]]

==Progress==
Were you able to take out Largo?

==Completion==
Ha! We finally got Largo! Nice one, <name>.

==Achievements==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].

==Patch changes==
