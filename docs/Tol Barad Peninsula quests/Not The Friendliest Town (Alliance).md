==Objectives==
Commander Marcus Johnson has asked you to kill 14 villagers in [[Rustberg Village]]. Rustberg Village is just north of base camp, on the right side.
* [[Rustberg Village Residents]] (14)

==Description==
Have you been up to Rustberg Village yet <name>? I would suggest you bring a sharpened blade if you are heading that direction.

The folks in that town look alright but something suspicious is going on in there. Reports have been coming in that they are picking off our soldiers left and right. We have had just about enough of that, so I need you to head down there and do a little cleaning house for us.

Take down as many as you can and report back when you are done. 

==Progress==
Did you find out what's up with that village?  Something seems off...

==Completion==
Told you that village was full of wackos.  Nice job clearing it out <name>. 

==Gains==
You will receive: {{cost|16|54|tbc=1}}, 250 reputation with [[Baradin's Wardens]].

== Achievements ==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].
