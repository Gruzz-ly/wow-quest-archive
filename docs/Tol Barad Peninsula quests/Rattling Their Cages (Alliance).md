==Objectives==
[[Camp Coordinator Brack]] has asked you to kill 8 Shipwrecked Sailors at the [[Cape of Lost Hope]].  The cape is located due northwest of here, on the beach.

*[[Shipwrecked Sailor]] slain (12)

==Description==
We have been having issues with the [[undead]] down at the Cape of Lost Hope for a while now.  Every time a new ship wrecks, they end up getting more undead to join their ranks.

Can you do us a favor and thin out the ranks up there?  I know you won't be able to kill them all, but anything you can do will help at this point.

Keep an eye out for [[horde]], we have been getting reports of them ambushing the beach lately. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|16|54}}, {{cost|tbc=1}}.

==Progress==
Any luck taking out those undead on the beach?  They looked freaky to me...

==Completion==
Nice work on the undead up there <name>.  We really appreciate the help. 

== Achievements ==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].
