==Objectives==
Kill 14 [[ghost]]s of any type at [[Largo's Overlook]], just northeast of base camp.
*[[Largo's Overlook]] Ghosts Slain (14)

==Description==
See that hill just beyond our base camp? That's Largo's Overlook and it's not a fun place to setup camp next to. We have been dealing with those spirits and spectres ever since we setup base camp.

Can you head up there and let them know we don't plan on leaving anytime soon? A few good kills on their ranks should put them in line.

Thanks for your help on this, <name>.

==Progress==
Who's afraid of ghosts?  Not me.  Well, maybe in the dark.

==Completion==
Great work, <name>!  We should not hear from the ghosts again anytime soon.

==Achievements==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].

==Notes==
*The ghosts which count as objectives are:
*[[Ghastly Worker]]
*[[Overlook Spectre]]
*[[Overlook Spirit]]

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
