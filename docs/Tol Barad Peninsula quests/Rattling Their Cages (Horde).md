'''Rattling Their Cages''' is one of the daily quests given by [[3rd Officer Kronkar]] in [[Tol Barad Peninsula]].

== Objectives ==
3rd Officer Kronkar has asked you to kill 8 Shipwrecked Sailors at the Cape of Lost Hope. The cape is located due northwest of here, on the beach.

*[[Shipwrecked Sailor]] (12)

== Description ==
We have been having issues with the undead down at the Cape of Lost Hope for a while now. Every time a new ship wrecks, they end up getting more undead to join their ranks.

Can you do us a favor and thin out the ranks up there? I know you won't be able to kill them all, but anything you can do will help at this point.

Keep an eye out for alliance, we have been getting reports of them ambushing the beach lately. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|g=9|s=40}}, {{cost|tbc=1}}.

== Completion ==
Nice work on the undead up there <name>.  We really appreciate the help.
