==Objectives==
Destroy 10 Ghastly Supply Boats.
*[[Wellson Supply Boat]]s Destroyed (10)

==Description==
The [[Wellson Shipyard]] is constantly receiving supplies from offshore and we need to put a stop to it.  They have setup cannons along the docks for defense but if you can make it to them, we can use them to destroy their supply ships.

Head over there and see what you can do.  Report back to me on your progress.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|16|54|tbc=1}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Baradin's Wardens]]

==Progress==
Did you take out the boats?

==Completion==
Great work on those supply ships, <name>!  We knew you would be good for somethin' around here.

This quest appears to be exclusive to [[Walk A Mile In Their Shoes]] - that is, when you accept it, Walk A Mile In Their Shoes is no longer available, and vice versa.
