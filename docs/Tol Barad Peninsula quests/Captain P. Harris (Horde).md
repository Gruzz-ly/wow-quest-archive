==Objectives==
You have been tasked with killing Captain P. Harris at the [[Cape of Lost Hope]].  The Cape of Lost Hope can be found northwest of here, along the coast.  Just look for the shipwrecks.
*[[Captain P. Harris]] slain

==Description==
The Cape of Lost Hope has been a sore in our side for weeks here on Tol Barad.  Half of our supply ships end up on the rocks down there.

To make matters worse, it's been overrun by a gang of undead sailors.  We have tried thinning the ranks, but they just seem to keep coming back.  Our last resort is to try and take out the captain that they report to.  You should be able to find him on a ship, just off the shoreline.

Oh, and I hope you are not too scared of [[Tank (shark)|sharks]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|16|54}}
*1 [[Tol Barad Commendation]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Hellscream's Reach]]

==Completion==
You did it! Maybe we can finally get some ships into port now.  Thank you, <name>.

==Achievements==
Completing this quest is an objective of [[Just Another Day in Tol Barad]].
