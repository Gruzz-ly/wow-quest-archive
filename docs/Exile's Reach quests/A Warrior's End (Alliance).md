==Objectives==
Speak with the strange [[ghost]] at the [[Darkmaul Bridge]].

==Description==
Hey <name>! You're a <class>, right? Maybe you can deal with this... situation.

I was scouting the area with [[Lindie Springstock|Lindie]]'s [[Scout-o-Matic 5000|device]] and saw a ghost who was offering power to any "true" [[warrior]]s.

I know you're still new at this, but why don't you try going over there?

We could use every advantage against these [[ogre]]s.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Execute]]

You will receive:
* {{cost|||30}}
* 250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You are no hero of myth and legend... but I see potential within you.

Stand still, and I shall share with you my mightiest technique.

And then I implore you to end my suffering.
