==Objectives==
Meet [[Lana Jordan]] west of the [[Horde Camp]].

==Description==
[[Thrall]] wants us to search west of here for the site of the next ritual.

We could use your help. I've already died once. It's not an experience I'd care to repeat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Completion==
A giant pit filled with necrotic energy and [[spider]]s.

I used to hate spiders. Now that I'm [[Forsaken]], I don't think they're all that bad.

They will still definitely kill you, though.

==Notes==

;Description
Warlord Breka wants us to scout ahead to find the source of the next ritual.

We could use your help. I've already [[Brace for Impact (Horde)|almost died... again]]. I'd prefer not to experience that a third time.
