==Objectives==
Spar with Captain Garrick.
* Abilities proven against [[Captain Garrick]] (3)

==Description==
[[Alaria]] says that the [[quilboar]] kidnapped other members of her expedition.

Chances are we'll have to brave the quilboar's den. That's no small feat. They are far more aggressive and intelligent than the [[murloc]]s you faced earlier.

I need to make sure I'm not sending you to your death. We're going to have one last sparring session.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||15}}
* 200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Fine work, <name>. Let's speak with Alaria and hunt down those quilboar.

==Notes==

:{{Text|Say|Captain Garrick|Recruit! Quilboar are far deadlier than [[murloc]]s. You need to be ready for the dangers ahead.}}
:{{Text|Say|Captain Garrick|Alright, let's see what you know!}}
:''Captain Garrick runs over to the nearby field, then turns to face you.''

With Captain Garrick targeted, a pop-up appears:
:{{text|bossemote|Press {{text|cyan|<button>}} to cast [[Frostbolt|{{text|cyan|Frostbolt}}]] to slow your enemy from far away}}

If you attempt to get within melee range:
:''Captain Garrick knocks you back.''
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|Your spells can be used at range. Cast them to start combat! Don't let the enemy start it for you.}}

If you cast [[Fire Blast]] instead of [[Frostbolt]]:
:''Captain Garrick doesn't move.''
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|Fire Blast takes no time to cast. Use it when your opponent is already upon you.}}

Cast Frostbolt:
:''Captain Garrick begins to move toward you.''
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|Good. Frost Bolt slows your enemy's movements. Keep casting it until they get close to you.}}

Once she's in melee range, another pop-up appears:
:{{text|bossemote|Press {{text|cyan|<button>}} to cast [[Fire Blast|{{text|cyan|Fire Blast}}]] when your enemy is close}}
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|You can cast Fire Blast instantly, which makes it an excellent tool in close quarters combat.}}

Cast Fire Blast:
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|Well done! Fire Blast's instant cast makes it perfect to use in melee range. Let's practice this again!}}
:''Captain Garrick knocks you back.''

Cast Frostbolt again:
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|Continue using Frost Bolt to keep your opponent away from you!}}

Then cast Fire Blast once she's in melee:
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|You're getting the hang of this. Let's do it one more time before you face the quilboar.}}
:''Captain Garrick knocks you back once more.''

Cast Frostbolt:
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|Keep your distance from your enemy and hit them with Frost Bolt!}}

Cast Fire Blast once she's in melee:
:{{Text|Say|Captain Garrick|Good. You're ready to face the quilboar. Let's get our people back.}}

With Captain Garrick targeted, a pop-up appears:
:{{text|bossemote|Press {{text|cyan|<button>}} to use [[Sinister Strike|{{text|cyan|Sinister Strike}}]] and build up [[Combo point|{{text|red|Combo Points}}]]}}

If you attack her for too long without using [[Sinister Strike]]:
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|Normal attacks won't do much on their own. Use Sinister Strike!}}

Use Sinister Strike:
:{{Text|Say|Captain Garrick|Sinister Strike builds up your combo points. Try using Eviscerate when you have at least three combo points!}}

If you use [[Eviscerate]] with fewer than three [[combo point]]s:
:{{Text|Say|Captain Garrick|Not bad, but Eviscerate is much more powerful when used with more combo points. Try it again.}}

At three combo points:
:{{Text|Say|Captain Garrick|You have three combo points! Use Eviscerate now!}}
:''Another pop-up appears:''
:{{text|bossemote|Use your {{text|cyan|Combo Points}}! Press {{text|cyan|<button>}} to use [[Eviscerate|{{text|cyan|Eviscerate}}]]}}

Use Eviscerate:
:{{Text|Say|Captain Garrick|Good! Eviscerate deals more damage based on your combo points. Try again, but this time use four combo points.}}

Use Sinister Strike:
:{{Text|Say|Captain Garrick|Use Sinister Strike as often as you can to gain combo points.}}

At four combo points:
:{{Text|Say|Captain Garrick|You have four combo points! Time to use Eviscerate!}}

Use Eviscerate again:
:{{Text|Say|Captain Garrick|Great job! Eviscerate spends all of your combo points. Use five combo points for your final Eviscerate!}}

Use Sinister Strike:
:{{Text|Say|Captain Garrick|Focus on getting five combo points before you try using Eviscerate.}}

At five combo points:
:{{Text|Say|Captain Garrick|You're at five combo points. Use Eviscerate to finish this!}}

Use Eviscerate one more time:
:{{Text|Say|Captain Garrick|Good. You're ready to face the quilboar. Let's get our people back.}}
