==Objectives==
Slay Hjalmar the Undying. You must use Execute in order to truly kill him.
* [[Hjalmar the Undying]] slain with [[:execute]]

==Description==
You can now understand how to wield my most powerful ability, young warrior.

I beg of you, use it to finish me off! These [[ogre]]s trapped my [[Ghost|spirit]] here long ago for daring to defy them.

Only through a glorious death will I finally be allowed to rest.

It is the only way I will see my brothers and sisters in the afterlife.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||30}}
* 250 [[XP]]

==Progress==

==Completion==
Sounds like you had an adventure! Where do you think that ghost went after you fought it?
