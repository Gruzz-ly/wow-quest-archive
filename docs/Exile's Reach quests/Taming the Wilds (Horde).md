==Objectives==
Learn Tame Beast from Mithdran Dawntracker, then use Tame Beast on any nearby wildlife. 
*[[Tame Beast]] learned from [[Mithdran Dawntracker|Mithdran]]
*Any wildlife [[beast]] tamed

==Description==
A [[hunter]] like yourself needs a good [[Hunter pet|pet]] by your side. Did you not bring one with you?

Hmm. I suppose I shall have to compensate for your lack of training.

Listen closely and learn quickly. I will teach you how to tame a beast and make it your pet.

You will need one if you are to fight the [[quilboar]]. 

==Rewards==
You will learn:
*[[Tame Beast]]
*[[Call Pet 1]]
*[[Revive Pet]] (on turn-in)

You will also receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
I will teach you how to tame beasts. Then, you will need to tame any of the surrounding wildlife.

==Completion==
Fine work. The lessons you learn from the inimitable Mithdran Dawntracker will last you a lifetime.

Now, down to the business of our quilboar foes...

;Objectives
Speak with Mithdran Dawntracker to learn Tame Beast, then use Tame Beast on any nearby wildlife.
*Tamed Beast<!-- is this sic? --> learned from [[Mithdran Dawntracker|Mithdran]]
*Any wildlife beast tamed

;Description
A hunter like yourself needs a good pet by your side. Were you not given one before the expedition began?

I suppose it's up to the [[Blood elf|blood elves]] to raise the [[Horde]]'s standards...

This is rather unorthodox, but I'll give you a quick instruction regarding taming your pet.

You'll need one by your side if you're to fight the quilboar.
