==Objectives==
Speak with the [[ghost]] [[paladin]].
* Speak with the [[Yorah|ghost paladin]]

==Description==
I found something strange with [[Lindie Springstock|Lindie]]'s [[Scout-o-Matic 5000|Scout-o-Matic]] that you should check out.

The ghost of a paladin appeared on the hill nearby. It looked straight at the Scout-o-Matic and asked for you.

I don't understand a whole lot about how the [[Light]] and paladins work, but I'd check this out if I were you.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Divine Shield]]

You will receive:
* {{cost||1|10}}
* 250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Those who serve the Light will know its blessing. Accept this gift, paladin.

Call upon it when your strength fails and when hope seems lost. The Light will protect you from harm.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Yorah|Step forward, paladin. The Light will aid you in your time of need.}}

==Progression==
{{The Missing Expedition Alliance}}
