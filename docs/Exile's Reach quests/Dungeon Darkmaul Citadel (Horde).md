==Objectives==
Complete the dungeon, "Darkmaul Citadel".
*Use the [[Group Finder]] to enter the [[dungeon]], "[[Darkmaul Citadel (instance)|Darkmaul Citadel]]"
*[[Gor'groth]]'s final ritual stopped
*Speak with [[Kalecgos]] to leave Darkmaul Citadel

==Description==
Gor'groth seeks to use [[shadow magic]] to gain control of [[Kalecgos]], the [[Dragon Aspects|aspect]] of the [[Blue dragonflight|Blue Dragonflight]].

He's collected enough [[life]] essence to attempt to finish the ritual. I do not know what will happen, but we cannot let him complete it!

Gor'groth will not stop until he is slain!

You must storm the citadel and slay Gor'groth before he can complete his ritual!

I would charge in beside you, were I not still recovering from his dark magic.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of these rewards:
|Expeditionary Cloth Hood#Horde
|Expeditionary Leather Helm#Horde
|Expeditionary Mail Helm#Horde
|Expeditionary Plate Helm#Horde
}}

You will also receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Completion==
Victory is ours today, <name>. More must be done, and I believe you are ready to go off to new adventures.

==Notes==
;Inside the dungeon
:{{text|say|Warlord Breka Grimaxe|Let's move. I'll keep the ogres focused on me while you strike them down!}}
Most of the ogres killed in the first room:
:{{text|say|Warlord Breka Grimaxe|We've slain almost all of them! Keep fighting!}}

;First two lines from description
[[Gor'groth]] seeks to raise a powerful dragon, [[Ravnyr]], from the dead.

He's collected enough life essence to attempt to finish the ritual... even if it means Ravnyr will not be at her full strength.

;Dialogue
:{{text|say|[[Shuja Grimaxe]]|All this necrotic energy... the ritual must nearly be complete!}}

;Completion
Victory for the [[Horde]]! It is time we returned to [[Orgrimmar]] as heroes and conquerors.

;Outside the dungeon
:''[[Bruk'tor]] and several [[Horde Wyvern (Exile's Reach)|Horde Wyverns]] have just arrived.''
:{{text|say|Warlord Breka Grimaxe|Horde reinforcements! I knew they would find us.}}
:{{text|say|Bruk'tor|Blood and thunder, soldiers! We've been trying to push our way past the storm.}}

{{Rfb-section|Shadowlands}}
;Description
Gor'groth is trying to revive a dragon called Ravnyr.

He's collected enough essence to at least try and finish the ritual... even if Ravnyr isn't brought back to her full power.

This won't stop until Gor'groth is slain!

You must storm the citadel and slay Gor'groth before he can complete his ritual!

I wish I could aid you, but I'm still weakened from the ritual.
