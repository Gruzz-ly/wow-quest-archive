==Objectives==
Scavenge parts in the area to create a Freezing Trap.
*[[Ice Mote|Ice mote]] received from [[Herbert Gloomburst]]
*[[Rusted Chain]]
*[[Old Spring]]

==Description==
If you want to be called a true [[hunter]], you'll need to learn the art of trapping.

Fortunately, I happen to be an expert in it.

First, you will need to gather supplies from the surrounding area so you can fashion a proper freezing trap.

Herbert can supply you with a mote of ice. Scavenge the area for other materials.

You will need the trap to handle another issue that has recently arisen.

==Rewards==
You will learn:
*[[Freezing Trap]]

You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you acquire the necessary supplies? Herbert should have the ice mote, while the other two should be nearby.

==Completion==
With a little work, this can become an effective trap.

Part of what makes a real hunter is the resourcefulness to use what your environment provides.

==Notes==
