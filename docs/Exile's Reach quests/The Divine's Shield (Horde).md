==Description==
[[Exile's Reach|This island]] has been cursed by necrotic magic. The [[Light]] can only just reach this place.

Call upon its [[:Divine Shield]] to step through the barrier before us unharmed and destroy this vile altar.

Show the darkness on this island that you are protected by the Light's embrace. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you require aid? Use Divine Shield to safely cross pass{{sic}} the necrotic barrier.

==Completion==
You have done well, <name>. Dispel this foul magic wherever you encounter it.

My task has been fulfilled. The Light calls to me.

Good luck, and remember that the Light's warmth will always embrace you. 

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Daelya Twilightsbane|Divine Shield will protect you against the altar's dark magic.}}

If you attempt to pass through without casting [[Divine Shield]], you'll be instantly killed by {{Abilities|Necrotic Barrier|id=317254|icon=spell_shadow_skull}}. This is probably how [[Yorah]] and a skeleton lying within the barrier died.

;Speaking to Daelya while Divine Shield is on cooldown
:I will aid you as best I can. The necrotic energy in this place must be cleansed.

:{{gossip|I need you to lower Divine Shield's cooldown.}}
::''Divine Shield's cooldown is reset.''

;On completion
:{{text|say|Daelya Twilightsbane|Trust in the Light, brave paladin.}}
:''Daelya fades away.''

==Beta version==
;Description
This island is filled with cursed, necrotic magic. The Light can barely reach this place.

Use your new power to cross through the barrier before us and destroy this vile necrotic altar.

Show the dark energies within this island that you are protected by the Light's embrace.
