==Objectives==
Use the Re-Sizer v9.0.1 on 3 Wandering Boars.
*Re-Sizer v9.0.1 tested on [[Wandering Boar]]s (3)
*Speak with Lady Jaina Proudmoore.
*[[Re-Sizer v9.0.1]] (provided)

==Description==
The Re-Sizer v9.0.1 barely works on inanimate objects. I have no idea what it will do to organic matter!

But if we do nothing, [[Wrathion]] will die!

Desperate times call for massively experimental science, <name>.

Take the Re-Sizer v9.0.1. I'll follow you around and calibrate it.

We're going to whip up a giant [[boar]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||12}}
*150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Be careful where you point the Re-Sizer v9.0.1. Make sure you're only using it on the boars in the immediate area.

==Completion==
I never thought I'd be so relieved to be face to face with a giant, scientifically enhanced boar.

==Notes==

;First boar

:{{text|say|Lindie Springstock|Yikes! That won't do at all... here, try again.}}

;Third boar
