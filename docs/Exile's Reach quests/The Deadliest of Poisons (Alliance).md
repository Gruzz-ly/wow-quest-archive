==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Gutgruk the Tough.jpg|Gutgruk the Tough|Gutgruk is incredibly tough. Use Instant Poison to weaken him!}}
Kill Gutgruk the Tough.
*[[Instant Poison]] cast
*[[Gutgruk the Tough]] slain

==Description==
You've got the poison. Now it's time to take out that [[ogre]]. Gutgruk the Tough.

He usually patrols around [[Darkmaul Citadel|their citadel]]. Probably looking for your expedition as we speak!

Poison your blades, then take that monster down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||30}}
* 250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Wow! The ghost of a rogue taught you how to make poisons and asked you to kill an ogre? You better get on it!

==Completion==
We'll make sure [[Coulston Nereus]] is properly remembered for his sacrifice.

It's a good thing that poison stopped the ogre... otherwise we would've been in trouble!
