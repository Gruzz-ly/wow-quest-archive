==Objectives==
Spar with Warlord Breka
*Abilities proven against [[Warlord Breka Grimaxe|Warlord Grimaxe]] (3)

==Description==
[[Won'sa]] said the [[quilboar]] have kidnapped the missing expedition.

The quilboar will kill you if you're not prepared. They're much smarter and deadlier than [[murloc]]s.

I won't see you die by their hands. We're going to spar one last time.

When we are done, you will cleave a path straight through the quilboar! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Completion==
You're ready to slaughter the quilboar! Let's speak to Won'sa and see what she knows.

==Notes==

==Progression==
{{The Missing Expedition Horde}}

==Beta version==
;Description
Won'sa said the quilboar have taken the missing expedition... which includes my daughter.

Quilboar will kill you if you're not prepared. They're much smarter than those murlocs you fought.

I won't see you die by their hands. We're going to have one last sparring match.

When we are done, you will cleave a path of destruction through the quilboar!

==Trivia==
*The actions the player has to perform differ depending on class:
**Warrior - use [[Slam]] whenever rage allows and [[Charge]] when she knocks the player back.
**Mage - use [[Frostbolt]] normally and [[Fire Blast]] when she enters melee range.
**Rogue - use [[Sinister Strike]] to build combo points and [[Eviscerate]] with different amount of points (first 3, then 4, then 5).
**Paladin - use [[Crusader Strike]] to build holy power and [[Shield of the Righteous]] whenever the player has enough.
**Priest - use [[Smite]] normally, apply [[Shadow Word: Pain]] and renew it when it is about to expire.
**Shaman - use [[Lightning Bolt]] normally and [[Primal Strike]] when she enters melee range.
**Warlock - use [[Shadow Bolt]] normally, apply [[Corruption]] and renew it when it is about to expire.
**Druid - use [[Wrath]] normally, apply [[Moonfire]] and renew it when it is about to expire.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.2.7|note=Description no longer mentions missing daughter.}}
*{{Patch 9.0.1|note=Added.}}
