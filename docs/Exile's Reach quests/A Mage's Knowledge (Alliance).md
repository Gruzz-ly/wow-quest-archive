Ye got some good moves fer a novice [[mage]]. Ye might even be as good as I am one day!

But ye don't know polymorph! How could ye not know that?

This be the key te any mage's spells. I can teach it te ye, if ye find me spellbook.

Last I saw, the [[ogre]]s threw me book in the lake. The LAKE!

Go get me book, and I'll show ye how polymorph works.

I hope me book isn't too damaged after sittin' at the bottom o' the lake.

==Completion==
Perfect! Let's see... ah, the page for Polymorph is fine!

Well, it's missin' a few words, but once ye know the magic ye can skip over most o' this.

Here, I'll teach it tae ye... and I'll show ye how it works!
