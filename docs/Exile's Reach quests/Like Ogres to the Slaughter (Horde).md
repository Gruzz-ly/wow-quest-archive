==Objectives==
Slay 8 ogres within [[Darkmaul Citadel]].
*[[Ogre]]s slain (8)

==Description==
This is worse than I thought. The ogres were counting on us to stage a rescue attempt.

It seems that they plan to attack our camp while they near completion of the ritual.

We can't let that happen. Crush the ogres! Show them the strength of the [[Horde]]! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of these rewards:
|Expeditionary Cloth Gloves#Horde
|Expeditionary Leather Gloves#Horde
|Expeditionary Mail Gauntlets#Horde
|Expeditionary Plate Gauntlets#Horde
}}

You will also receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Show the ogres no mercy!

==Completion==
That should weaken the ogres long enough for us to put an end to their plotting. 

==Notes==
[[Ogre Brute]]s, [[Ogre Shadowcaster]]s, and the [[Ogre Chef]] count toward this quest. [[Jugnug]], [[Wug]], and [[Grunk]] do not.

==Progression==
{{The Missing Expedition Horde}}

==Beta version==

;Description
This is worse than I thought. The ogres were prepared for us to try and rescue [[Warlord Thunderwalker]].

It seemed like the ogres plan on attacking our camp while they're getting ready to revive [[Ravnyr|this dragon]].

We can't let that happen. Fight the ogres, show them the Horde is stronger than them!

We'll hold the line here in case they come this way.
