==Objectives==
Have [[Meredy Huntswell|Meredy]] transform you into an [[ogre]], then scout the nearby ogre citadel.
*Ask Meredy to perform ogre transformation spell
*Enter [[Darkmaul Citadel]]
*Find the ogre cooking area
*Type /wave to [[Gor'groth]].
*Type /dance while in the cooking area (Optional)
*Reach the citadel entrance

==Description==
We need to get inside Darkmaul Citadel, rescue the captain of the expedition, and stop the ogre behind all of this.

Meredy is going to cast an illusion to make you look like an ogre, and you're going to take us all in as "prisoners."

I'll be hiding my efforts to suppress the shadow magic in the meantime.

Speak with Meredy when you're ready for her to cast the spell.

Her illusion spell should be temporary, as long as she casts it in the proper way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||10|15}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We're close to stopping all of this. We just need to push a little further.

==Notes==
;Speaking to Meredy
{{dialogue|
This will be fun, I promise! Just a little forbidden [[void]] magic mixed together with [[druid]]ic components and BAM!

I bet ye'll make a fine ogre.

{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready, transform me into an ogre and I'll sneak into their citadel.}}

:{{text|say|Meredy Huntswell|If ye feel a strange tingle, that means the illusion is working!}}
:''Meredy and [[Ralia Dreamchaser|Ralia]] cast {{abilities|Ogre Transformation|id=313583}} on you. You become an ogre, with a handful of chains connected to Jaina, Captain Garrick, and Henry. Meredy and Ralia run back toward the [[Alliance Camp]].''
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|All right, <name>. Just act like an ogre and get us inside the citadel.}}
:{{text|say|Henry Garrick|Don't use big words. In fact, don't say anything at all. Just smile and wave.}}

;At the front steps
:{{text|say|[[Ogre Shadowcaster]]|More sacrifices! Go to cooking pit, wave at [[Gor'groth]]. Show what you got!}}
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|Keep moving... let's see what we can learn about the ritual.}}

;At the cooking area
As you approach:
:{{text|say|Gor'groth|What do we have here... all the sacrifices we thought we lost!}}

Target Gor'groth and type <code>/wave</code>:
:{{text|emote|You wave at Gor'groth.}}
:{{text|say|Gor'groth|Take them to the back. We'll seal them in with the ward stones like we did their leader.}}
:{{text|say|Gor'groth|It is time to complete the ritual atop the citadel. Then all will bow before us!}}
:''Gor'groth teleports away.''

Before you move on, type <code>/dance</code> if you want:
:{{text|emote|You burst into dance.}}
:''[[Grunk]], [[Jugnug]], [[Wug]], and the [[Ogre Chef]] start dancing too.''
:{{text|say|Grunk|This one got some moves!}}
:{{text|say|Ogre Chef|You dance good!}}
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|<name>, I think you're taking the ogre act a little too far.}}

;At the citadel entrance
:{{text|say|Henry Garrick|[[Captain Kelra]]! No, no, no... how can we break these seals?}}
:''You release your allies from their chains, and they run toward the captive captain.''
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|There is always a way, Henry.}}
:''The ogre transformation ends and you revert back to your previous appearance. Jaina resumes channeling arcane magic toward the top of the citadel.''

==Trivia==
* This quest is a common roadblock for new players, who are confused by the direction to "type /wave to Gor'groth" and type "wave", "wave to Gor'groth", or similar into [[Newcomer Chat]].
