==Objectives==
Search the nearby camp for expedition survivors.
*Travel north to find any expedition survivors
*Speak [[Captain Garrick]] within the [[Abandoned Camp (Exile's Reach)|Abandoned Camp]].

==Description==
[[Captain Garrick]] went ahead to find survivors. It looks like she lit a fire.

Meet her up ahead to see what she found.

I'll look further within the island for survivors... and the source of the magic that attacked us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||65}}
* 240 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Alaria]] was a member of the lost expedition. I've bandaged her wounds, but she'll die if we don't get her some food.
