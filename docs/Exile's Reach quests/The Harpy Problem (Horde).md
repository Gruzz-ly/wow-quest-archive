==Objectives==
Meet with [[Bo (pandaren)|Bo]] near the [[Harpy Roost]].

==Description==
The [[ogre]]s are planning to sacrifice the rest of the expedition to fuel this ritual to control [[Kalecgos]], leader of the [[blue dragonflight]].

It seems one of the survivors was taken to the hills north of here. Bo scouted ahead to investigate.

Come, we'll see what he has found.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Completion==
I have found the missing member of the expedition... but we have many problems to deal with first. 

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Shuja Grimaxe|I will join Bo farther north, where the harpies roost. Meet me there.}}

On your way toward the Harpy Roost, you'll pass by a [[Lightspawn (Exile's Reach)|Lightspawn]], which offers the optional quest [[Freeing the Light]].

;Approaching Bo
:{{text|say|Bo|They seem to have captured a [[Forsaken]] prisoner for their ritual.}}

==Progression==
{{The Missing Expedition Horde}}

Thank you again for saving me, <name>. I promise I will not show such... weakness again.

The ogres are using the surviving members of my expedition to fuel their ritual to revive [[Ravnyr|that dragon]].

Bo scouted ahead to see if he could find the source of the ritual in the hills.

Come, we'll see what Bo has found.
