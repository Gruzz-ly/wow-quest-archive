==Objectives==
Recover [[Herbert Gloomburst]]'s book at the bottom of the nearby lake.
*[[Herbert's Spell Book|Herbert's book]] recovered from the lake

==Description==
You've got some good spells for a novice [[mage]]. There are a few things holding you back, though.

For instance, it's absolutely clear to me you don't know [[:Polymorph]].

If you did, you would've been using it on the [[Harpy|harpies]] that were attacking us!

Let's fix that. My spellbook has details on how to cast it... but my captors threw it into the nearby lake. Grab it for me, would you? Oh, and don't look through the book beforehand.

You will almost certainly regret it if you do.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Polymorph]]

You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Hopefully my book isn't too damaged from sitting at the bottom of the lake. 

==Completion==
Perfect! The page for Polymorph is smudged, but a little guesswork never stopped me from figuring out a spell.

It'll be quick for me to show you how to cast this properly. 

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Herbert Gloomburst|I'd get the book myself, but a good mage knows when to delegate.}}

;On turn-in
:{{text|say|Herbert Gloomburst|Here's an example of Polymorph!}}
:''Herbert casts [[Polymorph]] on you, turning you into a sheep.''
:{{text|say|Warlord Breka Grimaxe|Gloomburst, explain yourself!}}
:{{text|say|Herbert Gloomburst|I'm merely demonstrating how Polymorph is a{{sic}} useful in a fight.}}
:''Herbert begins casting [[Frostbolt]].''
:{{text|say|Herbert Gloomburst|Your opponent will wander around until you attack them. Like so.}}
:''Herbert's Frostbolt hits you and you revert back to your previous form.''
