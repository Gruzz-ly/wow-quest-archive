==Objectives==
Spar with Private Cole.
* Spar with [[Private Cole]]

==Description==
I hope this rain isn't a bad omen... this is supposed to be a simple rescue mission.

You'll be sparring with me today. We have to make sure you can handle yourself once we make landfall.

Let's see what you've got!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||75}}
* 340 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You're a skilled <class>, recruit. I think you'll prove a welcome addition to the main rescue team.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|Say|Private Cole|Let's move into sparring positions. I'll let you have the first strike.}}
:''Private Cole runs to the other side of the deck and becomes attackable.''

;Aggro
:{{Text|Say|Private Cole|Never run from your opponent. Stand your ground and fight until the end!}}

;50% health
:''Private Cole uses {{abilities|Jump Behind|id=312755|icon=ability_rogue_shadowstep}} to get behind you.''
:{{Text|Say|Private Cole|Remember to always face your enemy!}}

This fight is impossible to lose, as losing 50% of your own health will trigger an automatic heal back to full.

;Cole defeated
:{{Text|Say|Private Cole|I yield! Well, I'd say you're more than ready for whatever we find on that island.}}
