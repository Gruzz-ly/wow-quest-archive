Spar with Bo.
*[[:Touch of Death]] used on [[Bo (pandaren)|Bo]]
*Return to [[Warlord Grimaxe]].

==Description==
Let's have a quick sparring session before returning to camp.

I can sense new power rising from within you. I want to see it in action!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Let me know when you're ready to spar.

==Completion==
You look stronger! Good. We'll need such strength if we're to crush these [[ogre]]s.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Bo|Let me see what you've learned!}}
:''Bo runs up the hill and turns to face you.''

If you bring Bo to 1 health without using [[Touch of Death]]:
:''Bo takes a quick drink, restoring some health.''
:{{text|say|Bo|I won't stop fighting until you show me your new skill!}}

Touch of Death used:
:{{text|say|Bo|Impressive! Your skills have grown tremendously. Let's return to camp.}}
