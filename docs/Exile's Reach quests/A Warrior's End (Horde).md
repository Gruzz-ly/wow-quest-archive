==Objectives==
Speak with the [[Hjalmar the Undying|strange ghost]] at the [[Darkmaul Bridge]].

==Description==
Hail, <name>! You've grown stronger since we sparred on the boat. You may one day become a warrior of great renown!

Speaking of which...

I encountered a ghost on the bridge to the north that demands to meet a true warrior.

Perhaps you can see what it wants.

It did not seem hostile. It might even be willing to help us. 

==Rewards==
You will learn:
*[[Execute]]

You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Completion==
You are no hero of myth and legend... but I see potential within you.

Stand still, and I shall share with you my mightiest technique.

And then I implore you to end my suffering.

Speaking of which...

There's a strange ghost on the bridge to the north that demands the presence of a warrior.

Perhaps you can see what it wants.

It did not seem hostile... maybe it would be willing to help us.
