==Objectives==
Recover the Ward Stones from [[Jugnug]], [[Wug]], and [[Grunk]], then use them to free [[Captain Kelra]].
*[[Ward Stone (Jugnug)|Jugnug's ward stone]] recovered
*[[Ward Stone (Wug)|Wug's ward stone]] recovered
*[[Ward Stone (Grunk)|Grunk's ward stone]] recovered
*Disable [[Ogre Runestone|runes]] holding Captain Kelra (3)

==Description==
Captain Kelra won't last much longer. We need to acquire the ward stones to break the ritual before it kills her.

I'll continue weakening the main ritual. Get those ward stones from the ogre lieutenants nearby.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||10|15}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
So, these were the stones used to bind me? The ogres clearly were concerned about you thwarting their plans.

==Completion==
Thank you for saving me, but we have no time to lose. The ogres will not stop until their ritual is complete!

==Notes==
