Purchase any item from [[Quartermaster Richter]] and sell any of your items to her.
*Any item purchased from Quartermaster Richter
*Any item sold to Quartermaster Richter

==Description==
Quartermaster Richter was able to scavenge supplies from the wreckages on [[Exile's Reach|this island]].

Why don't you visit her and see if she has anything that you need?

You'll want to be well equipped for whatever we encounter next.

You will receive:
*{{cost|||12}}
*150 [[XP]]
*[[Standard Issue Knapsack]]

==Progress==
Quartermaster Richter should have a few supplies that you could use.

==Completion==
All stocked up? That's great.

[[Private Cole]] and Quartermaster Richter also found this bag in the nearby ruins. They thought you might make good use of it.

==Notes==
[[Quartermaster Richter]] sells two items here: 5x [[Tough Jerky]] for {{cost|||25}} or an [[Alliance Tabard]] for {{cost|||25}}. The tabard has the same appearance as the [[Private's Tabard]] from PvP.
