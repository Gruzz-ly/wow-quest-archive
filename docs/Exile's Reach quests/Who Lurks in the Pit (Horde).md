==Objectives==
Rescue 5 Trapped Expedition Members
*Trapped [[Freed Expedition Member|Expedition Member]] rescued from [[Thick Cocoon|cocoons]] (5)
*Defeat [[Hrun the Exiled|Hrun]] to rescue [[Crenna Earth-Daughter]]
*Ride Crenna Earth-Daughter to escape
*Report back to [[Warlord Breka Grimaxe|Warleader Breka]].

==Description==
There's a whole lot of shadow energy coming from this pit. I'm guessing a ritual is being performed down there. And that means a sacrifice.

Do you hear that? I've got the best hearing around, ever since I got this new ear sewn onto me.

It sounds like there are some more of our soldiers trapped down there. Probably all webbed up.

[[Won'sa]] and I will... stay up here and help anyone who gets out.

You should jump in and rescue anyone who is left down there!

==Rewards==
You will receive one of the following:
*[[Expeditionary Cloth Cuffs]]
*[[Expeditionary Leather Bracers]]
*[[Expeditionary Mail Armbands]]
*[[Expeditionary Plate Armguards]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost||2|50}}
*1,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What's wrong? Weren't you exploring the area to the west?

==Completion==
Crenna Earth-Daughter will be vital to our cause. Her connection to nature will help us understand what the ogres have done to this island.

Good work, recruit.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Lana Jordan|You're the only hope those survivors have left. No pressure.}}
:{{text|say|Won'sa|And make sure ya be stoppin' dat ritual!}}

;During the quest
Each of the first four [[Freed Expedition Member]]s will say one of the following when rescued:
*{{text|say|Freed Expedition Member|I knew the Horde wouldn't let me die. [[Crenna Earth-Daughter]] is trapped deeper in the pit.}}
*{{text|say|Freed Expedition Member|I thought I was done for! You've got to rescue Crenna Earth-Daughter, she's deeper below.}}
*{{text|say|Freed Expedition Member|Thanks. They have Crenna Earth-Daughter deeper inside, you have to rescue her!}}
*{{text|say|Freed Expedition Member|You have to find Crenna Earth-Daughter! She tried fighting the monster in this pit.}}

On the fifth Expedition Member:
:{{text|say|Crenna Earth-Daughter|A rescue party! [[Earth Mother]], guide their path!}}
:{{text|say|Hrun the Exiled|I will harvest your life force... and then those who sealed me in here shall burn!}}

In the lowest chamber of the pit, [[Hrun the Exiled]] is performing a dark spell on Crenna Earth-Daughter. On aggro:
:{{text|say|Hrun the Exiled|You will be kindling for the flame!}}

When Hrun is near death, he becomes immune and begins casting, setting himself alight with flames.
:{{text|say|Hrun the Exile|If... I die... so... do you!}}
:''Hrun explodes, and fireballs begin leaping out of the nearby braziers.''
:{{text|say|Crenna Earth-Daughter|Thank you, friend. I will bear us to safety. Hop on!}}
:''Crenna Earth-Daughter [[Travel Form|transforms into a stag]]. As you hop on, the entire room catches fire.''
:{{text|say|Crenna Earth-Daughter|[[An'she]], watch over and protect us!}}
:''Crenna begins running through the cave, dodging fires as they spring up. The cave trembles and rocks fall from the ceiling.''
:{{text|say|Crenna Earth-Daughter|Dark magic has brought ruin to this place.}}
:''Having reached the mouth of the pit, Crenna leaps to the surface, where Lana and Won'sa are waiting. The three start back toward the [[Horde Camp]].''
:{{text|say|Lana Jordan|Oh good, you made it out.}}
:{{text|say|Won'sa|Ya did good savin' da survivors an' killin' da spiders.}}
:{{text|say|Crenna Earth-Daughter|Those spiders had their rightful home destroyed. They deserved better.}}
:{{text|say|Won'sa|Well if ya be puttin' it dat way...}}
:''Crenna shifts back into her tauren form and runs ahead.''
:{{text|say|Lana Jordan|You have a problem with spiders, Won'sa?}}
:{{text|say|Won'sa|Ya seen da spiders we trolls be dealin' wit', ya not be a fan of dem either.}}

;Objectives
Rescue 5 Trapped Expedition Members
*Trapped Expedition Member rescued from cocoons (5)
*Defeat Hrun to rescue Cren Earth-Daughter{{sic}}
*Ride Cren{{sic}} Earth-Daughter to escape

;Description
There's a whole lot of necrotic energy coming from this pit. I'm guessing a sacrifice from the first expedition is down there.

Do you hear that? I've got the best hearing around, ever since I got that new ear attached.

It sounds like there are some more of our soldiers trapped down there in cocoons.

Won'sa and I will... stay up here and help anyone who gets out.

You should go down and rescue anyone who is left down there!
