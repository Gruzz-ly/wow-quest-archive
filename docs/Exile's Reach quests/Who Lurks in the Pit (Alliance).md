==Objectives==
Rescue 5 Trapped Expedition Members.
*Trapped [[Freed Expedition Member|Expedition Member]] rescued from [[Thick Cocoon|cocoons]] (5)
*Defeat [[Hrun the Exiled|Hrun]] to rescue [[Ralia Dreamchaser]]
*Ride Ralia Dreamchaser to escape
*Report back to [[Captain Garrick]].

==Description==
The winds whisper of people being trapped in the pit. It seems there may be more members of the expedition within.

I fear it will be up to you to make the descent and save the survivors.

There should be six in total... though the winds say that one is farther away from the others...

With our luck, the last survivor is at the bottom of the pit.

Good luck, <name>. And... make sure no [[spider]]s follow you back out.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of the following:
*[[Expeditionary Cloth Cuffs]]
*[[Expeditionary Leather Bracers]]
*[[Expeditionary Mail Armbands]]
*[[Expeditionary Plate Armguards]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost||2|50}}
*1,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What's wrong? I thought you, [[Bjorn Stouthands|Bjorn]], and [[Alaria]] were investigating a disturbance to the west.

==Completion==
Ralia Dreamchaser is a [[druid]] of the [[Cenarion Circle]], an order dedicated to protecting the wilds of [[Azeroth]].

Thank you for rescuing her. Her aid is sure to be of use against the [[ogre]]s.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Bjorn Stouthands|Good luck! Those survivors are countin' on ye!}}
:{{text|say|Alaria|Rescue anyone you can find!}}

;During the quest
Each of the first four [[Freed Expedition Member]]s will say one of the following when rescued:
*{{text|say|Freed Expedition Member|I thought I was dead! Please, you have to rescue Ralia Dreamchaser deeper below.}}
*{{text|say|Freed Expedition Member|I'll never look at spiders the same ever again. Did you rescue Ralia Dreamchaser yet?}}
*{{text|say|Freed Expedition Member|Thank you! Ralia Dreamchaser tried to rescue us, she must be somewhere below.}}
*{{text|say|Freed Expedition Member|Thank you! Ralia Dreamchaser tried to rescue us. She must be somewhere below.}}
*{{text|say|Freed Expedition Member|You need to rescue Ralia Dreamchaser! She's somewhere deeper in the cave.}}

On the fifth Expedition Member:
:{{text|say|Ralia Dreamchaser|Is someone there? Help! [[Elune]], guide them to me!}}
:{{text|say|Hrun the Exiled|I will harvest your life force... and then those who sealed me in here shall burn!}}

In the lowest chamber of the pit, [[Hrun the Exiled]] is performing a dark spell on Ralia Dreamchaser. On aggro:
:{{text|say|Hrun the Exiled|You will be kindling for the flame!}}

When Hrun is near death, he becomes immune and begins casting, setting himself alight with flames.
:{{text|say|Hrun the Exile|If... I die... so... do you!}}
:''Hrun explodes, and fireballs begin leaping out of the nearby braziers.''
:{{text|say|Ralia Dreamchaser|You saved my life! Allow me to return the favor. Hop on!}}
:''Ralia Dreamchaser [[Travel Form|transforms into a stag]]. As you hop on, the entire room catches fire.''
:{{text|say|Ralia Dreamchaser|Elune, please shield us from harm!}}
:''Ralia begins running through the cave, dodging fires as they spring up. The cave trembles and rocks fall from the ceiling.''
:{{text|say|Ralia Dreamchaser|Out of the way, little spiders!}}
:{{text|say|Ralia Dreamchaser|These poor creatures... we cannot stop to help them.}}
:''Having reached the mouth of the pit, Ralia leaps to the surface, where Bjorn and Alaria are waiting. The three start back toward the [[Alliance Camp]].''
:{{text|say|Alaria|By the [[Light]], you're alive!}}
:{{text|say|Bjorn Stouthands|Ye did a good job, savin' those people and dealin' with those spiders.}}
:{{text|say|Ralia Dreamchaser|Those spiders were victims, too. They just lost their home.}}
:{{text|say|Bjorn Stouthands|Yeah... well, I guess ye could see it that way.}}
:''Ralia shifts back into her night elf form and runs ahead.''
:{{text|say|Alaria|You should have known better than to say that to a druid.}}
:{{text|say|Bjorn Stouthands|Bah, you were just tellin' me how much you hate spiders!}}
:{{text|say|Alaria|The Light shines on all creatures. That does not mean I have to like them.}}
