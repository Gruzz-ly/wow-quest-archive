==Objectives==
Meet [[Thrall]] outside of [[Darkmaul Citadel]].

==Description==
The last remaining survivor is being held within the [[ogre]]'s citadel.

[[Crenna Earth-Daughter|Crenna]] and [[Herbert Gloomburst|Herbert]] have a plan to get us inside.

A small group of us will gather up north. You're coming with us.

If we fail here, the ogres will gain control of [[Kalecgos]] and his powerful [[blue dragon]] [[magic]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Completion==
Darkmaul Citadel looms ahead. 

Herbert's proposed plan is... unconventional.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Thrall|We push forward. Those ogres and their foul ritual will be brought to an end.}}
:''Thrall, Warlord Breka, [[Shuja Grimaxe|Shuja]], Herbert, and Crenna run up the road toward the Darkmaul Bridge.''

On your way to the [[Darkmaul Bridge]], you'll pass by a [[Danger Sign]], which offers the optional quest [[Killclaw the Terrible (quest)]].

==Progression==
{{The Missing Expedition Horde}}

==Previous version==
Last description sentence changed from: "If we fail here, the ogres will raise [[Ravnyr|the dragon]] from the dead. We won't let that happen!"

;Dialogue
:{{text|say|Warlord Breka Grimaxe|Recruit, we push forward! The rest of you, hold [[Horde Camp|this position]].}}

;Beta description
The last sacrifice is within the ogre's citadel up north.

Crenna and Herbert have a plan to get us inside.

A small group of us will meet up north to enact the plan. You're coming with us.

Failure here means the ogres revive this dragon monstrosity. We won't let that happen!
