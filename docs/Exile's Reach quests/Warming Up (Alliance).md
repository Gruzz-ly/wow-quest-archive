'''Warming Up''' is the first quest in the [[Exile's Reach storyline]]. This quest is available from [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]] immediately after the opening cutscene.

==Objectives==
Warm up by fighting a Combat Dummy.
*Destroy a [[Combat Dummy]]

==Description==
Prepare yourself, <name>. We're nearing [[Exile's Reach|the island]] where the previous expedition was lost.

Warm up on these combat dummies. We need everyone ready for whatever we find on that island.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||55}}
*200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Don't be shy. Just walk up to the target dummies, select them, and use your main attack.

==Completion==
Good, looks like you've kept up your <class> training during our voyage.

I'm concerned about the sudden turn in weather. Spar with [[Private Cole]] while I investigate this.

==Notes==
;Intro
:{{Text|bossemote|You are a soldier of the noble Alliance--a coalition of kingdoms upholding the ideals of valor and justice across Azeroth.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Your commanders have learned that an expedition bound for the Dragon Isles has been shipwrecked on a deserted island.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|As a bold new recruit, you have joined a rescue mission led by the dragons Wrathion and Kalecgos.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|It now falls to you to find the lost expedition and see them safely to the Dragon Isles.}}

You find yourself on the deck of an [[Alliance]] ship in the [[North Sea]] near [[Exile's Reach]]. Aboard the ship are [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]], [[Private Cole]], [[Austin Huxworth]], [[Quartermaster Richter]], [[Bjorn Stouthands]], [[Kee-La]], an [[Alliance Sailor]], and [[Helmsman Lenard]]. A [[Hunter pet#Exile's Reach|beast]] is also present if the player character is a hunter. [[Wrathion]] and [[Kalecgos]] flank the ship.

A brief tutorial on movement and camera control appears on-screen. Then, Jaina addresses you:
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|We're near the island. <Name>, let's get some practice in.}}

;On accept
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Refresh yourself on the basics. We don't know what's waiting once we're on the shore.}}

;Combat Dummy slain
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Good! Next we... wait, it's raining? The skies were supposed to be clear...}}

;On completion
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Cole will spar with you for now. Something about this rain doesn't feel right.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Wrathion and I will fly ahead to investigate the island.}}
:''Jaina walks over to Private Cole, salutes, then makes her way to the helm.''
