==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Murloc Watershaper.png|Murlocs|Murlocs have stolen crucial first aid supplies!}}
Recover 6 First Aid Kits from [[Murloc]]s.
*[[First Aid Kit]]s recovered from defeated Murlocs (6)

==Description==
I'm glad you made it out in one piece.

Judging by the nearby shipwrecks, I think it's safe to say the missing expedition ran aground here, too.

We can't move until we've got the remaining survivors back on their feet.

Unfortunately, our remaining supplies have been stolen by [[murloc]]s!

I need you to recover enough first aid supplies for the wounded.

Then we can begin searching for the missing expedition.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||1|25}}
* 470 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you recover the first aid kits? Don't take the murlocs lightly.

==Completion==
Excellent work. Let's get the survivors back on their feet.
