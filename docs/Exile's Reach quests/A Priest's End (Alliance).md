==Objectives==
Find the corpses of the first expedition recruits.
* [[Branven Hammerheart|Look for the corpses of the first expedition recruits]]

==Description==
You're a trained [[priest]], right <name>? This might be up your alley.

We've spotted the corpses of other recruits from our expedition.

I'm guessing they washed up on a different part of the island. They didn't make it very far.

When you have a moment, could you go over to them and say a few prayers? Just to help put their spirits at ease.

We'll give them a proper burial once we deal with the [[ogre]]s.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Resurrection]]

You will receive:
* {{cost|||30}}
* 250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
There's no time fer chatting. I'm going tae bless ye with the power to resurrect.

I'd give ye a bit more ceremony, but we got an urgent problem on our hands.

If we don't hurry, the souls of these poor recruits will be consumed by the ogre's necromancy!
