==Objectives==
Scavenge parts in the area to create a Freezing Trap.
*[[Ice Mote|Ice mote]] received from [[Meredy Huntswell]]
*[[Rusted Chain]]
*[[Old Spring]]

==Description==
By now, most [[hunter]]s would have been trained in the art of trapping. Allow me to get you up to speed.

We'll start with a freezing trap. In order to make one, you'll have to forage materials from your surroundings.

Meredy can provide you with a mote of ice. Scavenge the area for the rest of what is required.

And don't delay. You will need that freezing trap to deal with a problem that has cropped up within the camp.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
*[[Freezing Trap]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||15}}
* 200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you get the supplies needed? Meredy should have the ice mote, while the other two should be nearby.

==Completion==
With a little work, this can become a trap you can use.

Part of being a hunter means making use of what your surroundings provide.
