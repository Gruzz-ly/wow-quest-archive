==Completion==

==Notes==
Despite the warnings, the quest is relatively soloable, by some classes easier than others:
*Warrior: Be sure to dodge Killclaw's charge and counter with a [[Charge]] of your own, while using [[Shield Block]] as much as possible to reduce damage taken. You may need to use a healing potion.
*Mage: Kiting is key. Use [[Frostbolt]] to slow the bear, and don't forget to dodge its charge. A combination of [[Frost Nova]] and [[Blink]] can be used to make some distance in a panic situation.
*Rogue: Easily the hardest class to solo this quest with. Come into battle with at least 4 combo points stored ([[Sinister Strike]] nearby rats to get some), start with [[Cheap Shot]] into immediate [[Eviscerate]], then pray for luck and [[Instant Poison]] procs. Several uses of [[Crimson Vial]] and a healing potion are necessary, and even then the fight will be down to the last bit of health.
*Paladin: Simply avoid the bear's charges and heal with [[Word of Glory]] whenever you have the holy power for it. [[Flash of Light]] can be used if immediate healing is needed.
*Priest: Avoid the bear's charge and use the opportunity to heal up with [[Flash Heal]] while the enemy is not in melee range. [[Psychic Scream]] can also be used to create a breather.
*Hunter: Simply kiting Killclaw after slowing it with [[Wing Clip]] will allow you to kill the bear with relative ease.
*Shaman: Dodge the bear's charges and heal up with [[Healing Surge]] in the meantime. Hitting the bear with [[Earthbind Totem]] after the charge can allow you to squeeze an extra cast before the bear can catch up.
*Warlock: Use [[Summon Voidwalker]] and let the demon tank, heal it once it hits half health with [[Health Funnel]], and weaken the bear with [[Curse of Weakness]].
*Druid: It's best not to try and fight bear with bear; use your humanoid form or [[Cat Form]]. [[Regrowth]] can be used for healing after dodging Killclaw's charge.
*Monk: Dodge the charge and use the opportunity to heal with [[Vivify]] while the bear is not in melee range. [[Touch of Death]] can be used as a finisher.
