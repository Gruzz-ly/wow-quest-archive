==Objectives==
Defeat 10 harpies and their allies.
* [[Harpy|Harpies]] and cohorts slain (10)

==Description==
The harpies seem to be in league with the [[ogre]]s. Many of them are gathering to attack [[Horde Camp|our camp]].

We must thin their numbers and thwart their attempts to eliminate us.

Perhaps they will learn it is best to leave the [[Horde]] be.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
We must do what we can to fight the harpy menace. Slay them and their worgs!

==Completion==
The harpies seem to be retreating to their roost. That should give us time to stop the ogres.
