==Objectives==
Return to the [[Horde Camp]] and speak with [[Thrall]].

Let us return to camp with [[Herbert Gloomburst|Herbert]] in tow.

We're one step closer towards thwarting the ogres and their plans.

{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Expeditionary Cloth Leggings#Horde

}}

You will also receive:

==Completion==
It is good to see you all back in one piece. You are testament to the Horde's strength of will!

Let's hope Gloomburst is as powerful as he is unhinged.

Perhaps my mother was right. Together, we stood against the [[Harpy|harpies]] and claimed victory!

Let us return to camp with Herbert in tow.

We're one step closer towards thwarting the ogres and their plans to revive [[Ravnyr|that dragon]].
