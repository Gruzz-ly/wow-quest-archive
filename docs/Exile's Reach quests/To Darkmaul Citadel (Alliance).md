==Objectives==
Meet [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]] outside of [[Darkmaul Citadel]].

==Description==
We've rescued everyone except for the expedition's captain. [[Lindie Springstock|Lindie]]'s [[Scout-o-Matic 5000|Scout-o-Matic]] spotted her just outside [[Darkmaul Citadel]].

[[Meredy Huntswell|Meredy]] has come up with an... interesting plan to rescue the captain. It may be our only chance.

Come. We'll convene in the shadow of Darkmaul Citadel, and there we will begin our rescue mission.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||85}}
* 510 [[XP]]

==Completion==
All right, <name>. I hope you're a good actor, because you're about to play to a very tough crowd.

==Notes==

:''Jaina, Captain Garrick, [[Henry Garrick|Henry]], Meredy, and [[Ralia Dreamchaser|Ralia]] run up the road toward the [[Darkmaul Bridge]].''

On the way, you'll pass by a [[Danger Sign]], which offers the optional quest [[Killclaw the Terrible (quest)]].
