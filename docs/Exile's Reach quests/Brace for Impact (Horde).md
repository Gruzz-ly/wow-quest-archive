==Notes==
;On accept
:''With a clap of thunder, the screen blackens for a moment, then fades back in. The storm has intensified, casting darkness and heavy rain over the ship.''
:{{text|say|Grunt Throg|Warlord! This storm will soon overwhelm us!}}
:''[[Warlord Breka Grimaxe]] runs down the stairs from the helm.''
:{{text|say|Warlord Breka Grimaxe|Soldiers, brace yourselves!}}
:''The crew, aside from [[Helmsman Da'vees]] and [[Apprentice Kutz]], gathers on the deck in front of the center mast.

;On completion
:''A brief cinematic plays: Warlord Breka attempts to steady herself against a doorway and looks on in awe as a gigantic wave looms over the ship. It crashes down, destroying the ship and tossing the crew underwater.''

:''The camera cuts to the [[Murloc Hideaway]] on [[Exile's Reach]]. You're lying on the beach, surrounded by curious baby [[murloc]]s. They run off as you wake up.''
:{{text|say|Thrall|Thank the elements you survived.}}
:''[[Bo (pandaren)|Bo]], [[Mithdran Dawntracker]], [[Lana Jordan]], and [[Provisioner Jin'hake]] are strewn about the beach, injured. Thrall is kneeling over Warlord Breka. He offers the next quest.''

==Previous versions==
;Pre-''Midnight'' completion
This ship won't make it to the island in one piece.

Hold on to something, and pray that the [[elements]] will spare us from a grim death at sea.

;On the other side of the cinematic
:{{text|say|Warlord Breka Grimaxe|<Name>! You survived! We need to regroup at once.}}

;Shadowlands beta description
You have promise, <name>. Perhaps one day you will bring great glory to the Horde!

Now we just... hold on.

Do you hear that?
