==Objectives==
Ride the Choppy Booster Mk. 5 and blow up the undead army.
*Ride the [[Choppy Booster Mk. 5]]
*[[Monstrous Cadaver]] slain (8)
*[[Torgok]] slain
*Find [[Wrathion]].

==Description==
I got the perfect plan. You're gonna ride the Choppy Booster Mk. 5 and BLAST those walkin' cadavers from the sky!

I hereby dub the Re-Sizer the "Re-Deather." We're gonna show them where the [[undead]] belong!

Er, except for [[Forsaken|OUR undead]]. They're totally fine.

Anyway, hop on the Choppy Booster Mk. 5 and I'll pilot it.

Once we save [[Wrathion]], we'll blast our way to all the other survivors!

Hmph, it's about time. I suppose you'll need my help to find out what else is going on.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Cork Fizzlepop|When you blow up those zombies, remember that my proprietary invention made it happen!}}

;First objective completed
:{{text|say|Cork Fizzlepop|Hey, uh... remember that little talk we had about liability? Looks like that rig is about to... explode.}}
:''The Choppy Booster Mk. 5 drops you.''

Attack Torgok inside the building.
:{{Text|say|Torgok|We take soul for ritual, you no stop!}}

;Torgok slain
:{{Text|say|Torgok|Me never get... to see... ritual...}}

;Approaching Wrathion
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Honestly, the indignity of it all...}}

Upon completion, a cutscene plays out.
:{{Text|bossemote|Wrathion|Kalecgos is here somewhere, captured in his dragon form.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Wrathion|These idiotic ogres are trying to start a ritual to gain control of him and his magic!}}
:''An explosion is heard from the citadel.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Wrathion|And there it is.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Wrathion|Kalecgos and his power will be theirs if these rituals finish!}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|We will not leave Kalecgos to this grim fate.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|These ogres will face the fury of the Horde.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Thrall|Lok-tar ogar!}}
:''The cutscene ends. Thrall heads over to [[Horde Camp|a small camp]] the crew has set up nearby. Shuja waits at the road that goes northeast to the [[Harpy Roost]].''

:{{Text|say|Wrathion|I'll do what I can to forestall the ritual, but don't keep me waiting. I would hate to get captured again.}}
:''Wrathion paces, shifts to his dragon form, and flies toward the citadel.''

Thank you, stranger. I failed the Horde... I was not strong enough to stop this threat on my own.

:''Shuja is released from the dark magic holding her.''
:{{text|say|Warlord Breka Grimaxe|Wretched ogre. Let's check on Shuja.}}
:{{text|say|Shuja Grimaxe|Mother... I tried to stop the ogres on my own. But I failed. My strength was not enough.}}
:{{text|say|Warlord Breka Grimaxe|Shuja, the Horde is strong not when we fight alone, but when we stand united. Now, tell me what's happened here.}}

:''A cutscene begins.''
:{{text|say|Shuja Grimaxe|As you command. The ogres are using necromancy to raise a dragon from the dead.}}
:{{text|say|Shuja Grimaxe|They need sacrifices like us to fuel their magic. They're about to start a ritual that will --}}
:''A pillar of sickly green light bursts from a building to the northwest. Stolen life energy is flying into it from various locations in the area.''
:{{text|say|Shuja Grimaxe|It's already begun. They're going to use the life force they've gathered to reanimate the dragon!}}
:{{text|say|Warlord Breka Grimaxe|Then we must take action. Remember that when we band together, the Horde can conquer any challenge.}}
:{{text|say|Warlord Breka Grimaxe|We will bring an end to these rituals before the ogres can complete them. Lok-tar ogar!}}
