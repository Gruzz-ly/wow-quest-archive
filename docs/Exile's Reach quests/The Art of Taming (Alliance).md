==Objectives==
Learn how to dismiss, tame, and stable pets from [[Austin Huxworth]].
*Use "[[:Dismiss Pet]]" to temporarily dismiss your current pet
*Speak with Austin to summon and [[Tame Beast|tame]] your new pet
*Speak with Austin to learn about [[Stable master|pet stables]]

==Description==
I'm quite surprised to find this beast still alive and kicking. It appears to like you.

Before we finish, you had better learn how to wrangle multiple pets.

I'll give you one last lesson.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||15}}
* 200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Make sure to dismiss your pet before we get started. Oh, and if it's injured, use [[:Revive Pet]] to bring it back.

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. There's nothing left for me to teach you.

Gather as many wild beasts as you'd like. Just make sure not to lose focus on the [[ogre]]s who are trying to kill us.

==Notes==
;On accept
If you have a pet out:
:{{text|say|Austin Huxworth|You need to dismiss your current pet before you can tame another. You can call it back to you later.}}

Otherwise:
:{{Text|say|Austin Huxworth|Let me know when you're ready to tame the beast.}}

Speak with Austin:
{{Dialogue|
{{gossip|I'm ready to tame my pet, call them out.}}
}}

If all [[Call Pet]] slots are currently filled:
:{{text|say|Austin Huxworth|You've got too many pets. Speak with me to place one in a stable.}}

Otherwise:
:{{Text|say|Austin Huxworth|Here it comes. Tame it, just like the one from before.}}
:''The beast runs out in front of the [[Alliance Camp]] and waits.''

Once the beast is tamed:
:{{text|say|Austin Huxworth|Fine work! Now you must learn how to place your pets in a stable.}}

Speak with Austin again and select "{{gossip|I'd like to stable my pet here.}}" Then select one of your active pets and click "Put in Stable."
