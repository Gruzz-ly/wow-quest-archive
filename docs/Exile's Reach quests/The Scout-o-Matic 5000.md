==Objectives==
Use the Scout-o-Matic 5000 to find [[Henry Garrick]].{{sic}}
* Use [[Scout-o-Matic 5000]] to scout the area

==Description==
You look like a <race> that needs help finding the scattered members of our alliance{{sic}} expedition!

Luckily, you have happened to rescue the one and only [[Lindie Springstock]], [[Gnomish inventor|inventor]] extraordinaire!

I've got my Scout-o-Matic 5000 all set to go. It'll fly up in the air and let you scout the entire area.

I'll give you the honors. Use my Scout-o-Matic 5000 to find the rest of the expedition.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||8}}
* 100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Give me a moment to re-size the Scout-o-Matic, then you can ride it!

==Completion==
There's no problem a little re-sizing can't fix! Let's find something to stomp those [[undead]] flat!

==Notes==
;On accept
:''[[Lindie Springstock]] releases a small flying device into the air.''
:{{text|say|Lindie Springstock|I brought along a miniaturized Scout-o-Matic 5000! Let's just unshrink it...}}
:''Lindie hits the device with an electrical beam, which turns it the size of a [[giant]].''
:{{text|say|Lindie Springstock|Whoops, too big! A slight adjustment, and...}}
:''He adjusts its size a few times until it's closer to the size of a [[humanoid]].''
:{{text|say|Lindie Springstock|There! Just right. Give it a try!}}

;Scouting the area
Click on the [[Scout-o-Matic 5000]] to attach yourself to it. It will slowly ascend into the air, taking you toward the [[Ogre Ruins]], where a large number of [[Zombie Servant]]s and [[Monstrous Cadaver]]s are gathered.
:{{text|say|Lindie Springstock|Come in, <name>! It seems the Scout-o-Matic 5000's camera is working as expected!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|If it has a camera why did we just send that recruit up there?}}
:{{text|say|Lindie Springstock|As a backup, of course! What if the machine were to break? We wouldn't be able to see!}}
:{{text|say|Lindie Springstock|I mean, I doubt anything of the sort will happen. Just... don't jostle it around too much.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|Hold a moment. I see... Wrathion?}}
:''A cutscene begins: A [[Ogre mage|two-headed ogre]] walks out from the building and speaks to [[Wrathion]], who's being held aloft with magic.''
:{{text|say|[[Gor'groth]]|Puny dragon! With the power of your soul, we will control the blue one!}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|His name is Kalecgos, you insufferable oaf! Release me or suffer the consequences!}}
:{{text|say|Gor'groth|We have other rituals to oversee. Savor the final moments of your life!}}
:''Gor'groth walks away, following the road to the west. The cutscene ends and the Scout-o-Matic begins its flight back toward Lindie, Garrick, and [[Austin Huxworth|Austin]].''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|We need to break the binding spell on Wrathion. I'll clear out the undead with my magic.}}
:{{text|say|Lindie Springstock|Or... science! The re-sizer can enlarge one of the nearby boars so it can trample all of those monsters flat!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Do it. We have no time to spare if we're to rescue both Wrathion and Kalecgos.}}
:''The Scout-o-Matic has made it back and releases you. [[Kee-La]], [[Alaria]], [[Private Cole]], [[Bjorn Stouthands]], and [[Quartermaster Richter]] appear from the [[Quilboar Briarpatch]] to join the group.''
