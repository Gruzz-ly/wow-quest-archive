==Objectives==
Commune with the nearby druid stone.
* Commune with the [[Druid Stone]]

==Description==
Thank you for rescuing me, <name>. Allow me to aid you in your [[druid]]ic path.

I used a special form to get us out of that pit. I have an idea on how you can learn to do the same.

Come with me. There is an old druid stone nearby. We'll commune with it to see if it can help reveal this form to you.

==Rewards==
You will learn:	[[Travel Form]]

You will receive:
* {{cost|||30}}
* 500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Come. The spirits of nature await us.

==Completion==
Good! I can sense the blessing of the spirits flowing through you.

Focus, and you should find that you can take on a new form.
