Spar with [[Warlord Grimaxe]].

==Description==
[[Won'sa]] said the [[quilboar]] have kidnapped the missing expedition... including [[Shuja Grimaxe|my daughter]].

The quilboar will kill you if you're not prepared. They're much smarter and deadlier than [[murloc]]s.

I won't see you die by their hands. We're going to spar one last time.

When we are done, you will cleave a path straight through the quilboar!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Completion==
You're ready to slaughter the quilboar! Let's speak to Won'sa and see what she knows.
