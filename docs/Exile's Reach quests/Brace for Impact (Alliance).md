==Objectives==
Find [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]] inside the ship.

==Description==
That's it for warming up. You and the other new recruits are a promising bunch, I'll tell you that much.

Hold on... what's that sound? I think something big is headed our way!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||35}}
* 60 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This storm is resisting all of my attempts to dispel it.

Stay near me. I'll ensure we make it onto the island one way or another.

==Notes==

:''With a clap of thunder, the screen blackens for a moment, then fades back in. The storm has intensified, casting darkness and heavy rain over the ship.''
:{{text|say|[[Private Cole]]|Captain! We can't weather this storm for long!}}
:''[[Jaina Proudmoore]] runs down the stairs from the helm, and [[Captain Garrick]] calls out from inside the ship.''
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|Everyone below decks! Now!}}
:''Jaina, Private Cole, Captain Garrick, [[Bjorn Stouthands]], [[Austin Huxworth]], [[Quartermaster Richter]], [[Kee-La]], and [[Hunter pets#Exile's Reach|the beast]] gather inside.''

;On completion
:''A brief cinematic plays: Captain Garrick attempts to steady herself against a doorway and looks on in awe as a gigantic wave looms over the ship. It crashes down, destroying the ship and tossing the crew underwater.''

:''The camera cuts to the [[Murloc Hideaway]] on [[Exile's Reach]]. You're lying on the beach, surrounded by curious baby [[murloc]]s. They run off as you wake up.''
:{{text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|<name>! The sea was kind to you today.}}
:''Captain Garrick, Bjorn Stouthands, Austin Huxworth, Quartermaster Richter, and Kee-La are strewn about the beach, injured. Jaina is kneeling over Captain Garrick. She offers the next quest.''

At this point, a choice window pops up:

Skip Exile's Reach and go to the [[Housing]] tutorial.

You will not be able to return to Exile's Reach.
