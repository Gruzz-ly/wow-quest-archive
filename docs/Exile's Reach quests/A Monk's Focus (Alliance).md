==Objectives==

==Description==
You fought well against the [[Harpy|harpies]], but we all need to become stronger to face what lies ahead.

The first step is to find a nice place to meditate and focus yourself.

A [[monk]] is only as strong as they are focused.

Come. I know of such a place.

You will learn: [[Touch of Death]]

You will receive:
* {{cost|||30}}
* 250 [[XP]]
