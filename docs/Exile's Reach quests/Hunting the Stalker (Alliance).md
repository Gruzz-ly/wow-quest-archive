==Objectives==
Use your Freezing Trap within the Ogre Ruins to lure out the beast stalking the camp.
* [[Freezing Trap|Freezing trap]] used within [[Ogre Ruins]] to capture [[Stalking Prowler|stalker]]

==Description==
Now that you have your trap, there's a problem we need to deal with.

A wild beast has been stalking our camp. It's already stolen some of our food. We have little enough as it is.

You and I will work together. Set your freezing trap and lure out whatever this creature is.

Once it is caught, I will determine if the beast can be tamed... or if it needs to be put down.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
*{{ability|Call Pet|Call Pet 2}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||15}}
* 200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Use the Freezing Trap anywhere within the Ogre Ruins. Just don't do it right within the camp.

==Completion==
Thank you for the help, <name>. I have one last lesson to impart--calling a different companion to your side.

There are plenty of wild beasts on this island. See which ones you can tame.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Austin Huxworth|Place your Freezing Trap within the Ogre Ruins. The beast that's been stalking our camp should emerge.}}

;Setting the trap
If the trap is too close to the [[Alliance Camp]]:
:{{text|say|Austin Huxworth|Place the trap further from the camp. The beast won't be lured out if it's too close to us.}}
:''Freezing Trap's cooldown is reset.''

If it's in a valid spot:
:{{text|say|Austin Huxworth|Look, there it is!}}
:''[[Stalking Prowler|A beast]] appears and walks into the trap.''
:{{text|say|Austin Huxworth|Caught it!}}
:''Austin runs up to it.''
:{{text|say|Austin Huxworth|That's no wild animal... it's one of the beasts that was aboard our ship! It must have survived the crash.}}
:''The beast disappears, and Austin returns to his original location in the camp.''
