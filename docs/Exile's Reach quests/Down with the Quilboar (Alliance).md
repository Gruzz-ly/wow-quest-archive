==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Geolord Grek'og.png|Geolord Grek'og|The quilboar performing a ritual on one of the expedition members.}}
Slay Geolord Grek'og.
*[[Geolord Grek'og]] slain
*Meet [[Lindie Springstock]] to the north of the [[Quilboar Briarpatch]].

==Description==
From what I can gather, the [[quilboar]] are performing a [[Shadow (magic)|shadow]] ritual on one of the expedition members.

Their [[chief]] is [[Geolord Grek'og]]. He is the one who seeks to drain the life from our friend.

Slay Grek'og and save the captive member of the expedition. He may know where the others were taken.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||15}}
* 200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thanks for saving my life! They said this would be a run of the mill, uneventful expedition.

It definitely was NOT! And I couldn't be happier!
