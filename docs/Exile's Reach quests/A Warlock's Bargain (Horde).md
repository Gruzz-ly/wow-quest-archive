==Objectives==
Investigate first expedition warlock's corpse
*[[Sprag Buzzboom|Dead warlock's body]] investigated
*[[Old Grimoire|Old grimoire]] recovered
*[[Summoned Voidwalker (Exile's Reach)|Voidwalker]] summoned with grimoire

==Description==
While scouting the area, I saw an open [[portal]] near [[Darkmaul Bridge|the bridge]] up the hill. That does not bode well for any of us.

It seemed like another [[warlock]] tried to seal the portal, but failed.

I know you dabble in such... affairs. Perhaps you could put your knowledge to good use and close that portal. 

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you: {{ability|Summon Voidwalker|Learn Summon Voidwalker|icon=spell_shadow_summonvoidwalker}}

You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
I see you have the grimoire that enacted the binding ritual. 

==Completion==
Our bargain has been struck.

Call upon me from the [[Void]], and I will answer.

<The voidwalker looks at the goblin's corpse.>

Let us see if you are stronger than those who came before you. 

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Grunt Throg|I am... not fond of [[fel]] magic. But I trust that whatever you do is for the Horde.}}

;Interacting with [[Sprag Buzzboom]]
:<You ignore the dead body and look at a bigger prize - his grimoire!

:It details a ritual to bind a powerful [[voidwalker]] to your service. Clearly this warlock failed his attempt.

:But you could succeed where he failed. Take the grimoire next to the corpse and finish the ritual to gain control of your own voidwalker!>

:{{gossip|<Rise and retrieve the warlock's grimoire and finish the ritual to summon a voidwalker.>}}
::''The [[Old Grimoire]] beside the body can now be picked up.'

;Using the grimoire
:''You channel into the portal, and a voice answers.''
:{{text|say|Voidwalker|Who dares to summon me?}}
:''Small beacons of shadow magic begin to form a circle around you.''
:{{text|say|Voidwalker|You... cannot... bind me...}}
:''As you finish casting the spell, the portal dissipates and a [[Summoned Voidwalker (Exile's Reach)|Summoned Voidwalker]] appears from it.''
:{{text|say|Summoned Voidwalker|The bargain... is struck. I will... obey...}}

;On completion
:{{text|say|Summoned Voidwalker|Call upon me, and I shall answer.}}
:''The voidwalker disappears.''

==Beta version==
;Description
I spotted a portal into the [[Void]]. That's bad news for us considering what monsters lurk there.

It seemed like another warlock tried sealing the portal but failed.

I know you dabble in the forbidden magics. Think you could go find out what happened and try to close the portal?
