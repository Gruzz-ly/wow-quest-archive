==Objectives==
Blow up 4 catapults within [[Darkmaul Citadel]].
*[[Catapult (Exile's Reach)|Catapults]] destroyed (4)

==Description==
As we snuck in here I noticed the [[ogre]]s erecting [[catapult]]s to destroy [[Horde Camp|our camp]].

[[Cork Fizzlepop|Cork]] must have anticipated this and gave me several explosives to use, "just in case".

Take these explosives and blow up those catapults!

Also don't shake them too hard.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Use those explosives to blow up those catapults!

==Completion==
I'm glad to see the catapults are shattered, and you're in one piece.

It can be rare to achieve both with Cork's inventions.

==Progression==

;Description
Did you see the catapults lined up on the way over here?

Seems like the ogres are planning to hurl who knows what at our camp. Good thing I came prepared!

Cork gave me some of his explosives as a contingency plan.

I was going to save them for some enemies back in [[Orgrimmar]]... but I suppose you should use them here instead.

Blow up the catapults before they fire on our camp! 

;Progress
Make sure to give the explosives a nice wave goodbye when you use them on the catapult.

It'll make them feel appreciated before they explode.

;Completion
Good work! You didn't happen to save any of those explosives, did you?

...I didn't think so. Oh well! I have plenty of other ways to blow up my enemies.
