==Objectives==
Learn how to dismiss, tame, and stable pets from Mithran{{sic}} Dawntracker.
*Use "[[:Dismiss Pet]]" to temporarily dismiss your current pet
*Speak with [[Mithdran Dawntracker|Mithdran]] to summon and tame your new pet
*Speak with Mithdran to learn about [[Stable master|pet stables]]

==Description==
Quite the surprise to find this beast so hale and hearty. It seems to have taken a liking to you.

If you're ever going to be as great as one of the Dawntrackers, you must learn how to handle multiple pets.

Allow me to show you how.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Be sure to dismiss your pet before we get started. Oh, and if it's injured, use [[:Revive Pet]] to bring it back.

==Completion==
I don't believe there is anything left to teach you, <name>.

Now you must go forth and find more beasts to tame and call your own.

If you ever need to store or retrieve your pets, speak with me or any other [[stable master]]s you encounter in your travels.

==Notes==
*The species/appearance of the beast you get to tame depends on your character's race; see [[Hunter pet#Exile's Reach]].

:{{text|say|Mithdran Dawntracker|There it goes. Tame it, just like the one [[Taming the Wilds (Horde)|before]].}}

==Beta version==
;Description
It's quite the surprise finding this beast still alive and kicking. It looks like it has taken a liking to you.

If you're ever going to be as great as one of the Dawntrackers, you better know how to handle multiple pets.

Tell you what. I'll lend you a hand and show you the ropes.
