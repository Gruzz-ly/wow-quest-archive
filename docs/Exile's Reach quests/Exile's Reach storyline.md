# Exile's Reach storyline

The '''Exile's Reach storyline''' is the new-to-''World of Warcraft'' starting experience for brand new players with no other characters on the account.

The [[Horde]] and [[Alliance]] sent an expedition to [[Exile's Reach]], but it was never heard from again. Novice [[adventurer]]s travel to the island as part of a bigger and stronger expeditionary force to find out what happened. As with many such journeys, the adventurers find themselves as part of a crew aboard a ship bound to their last known location. When things take a turn for the worse, they make landfall on the island of Exile's Reach, eventually discovering that the previous expedition was captured by an [[ogre]] [[necromancer]] who intends to sacrifice them to raise an [[undead dragon]].

Completing Exile's Reach for the first time will award the achievement [[Exile's Reach (achievement)]].

==Conclusion==
After leaving the island, the tutorial continues with a short quest chain to tour [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]] or [[Orgrimmar]] and learn about [[mount]]s, [[specialization]]s, and [[inn]]s. At the end of this chain, [[The Dragon Isles Await]] will pop up, which starts the intro to ''[[World of Warcraft: Dragonflight|Dragonflight]]''.
#[[Welcome to Stormwind]] / [[Welcome to Orgrimmar]]
#[[Finding Your Way]]
#[[What's Your Specialty? (original)]]
#[[Home Is Where the Hearth Is (original)]]

Alternatively, players who already have at least one level 50 or higher character<!-- Is this still required? --> can tell [[Captain Garrick]] or [[Warlord Breka Grimaxe]] they'd like to skip the tour instead of picking up [[Welcome to Stormwind]]/[[Welcome to Orgrimmar]]. This will start [[Adventurers Wanted: Chromie's Call]], prompting the player to visit [[Chromie]] to pick a [[Timewalking Campaign]].
