==Objectives==
Recover the Ward Stones from [[Jugnug]], [[Wug]], and [[Grunk]], then use them to free Warlord Thunderwalker.
*[[Ward Stone (Jugnug)|Jugnug's ward stone]] recovered
*[[Ward Stone (Wug)|Wug's ward stone]] recovered
*[[Ward Stone (Grunk)|Grunk's ward stone]] recovered
*Disable [[Ogre Runestone|runes]] holding [[Warlord Thunderwalker]] (3)

==Description==
Warlord Thunderwalker won't last much longer. Soon, his life essence will be completely drained.

[[Gor'groth]] mentioned that they are keeping him captive through the use of ward stones.

I want you to recover these ward stones and bring them here so we can release Thunderwalker.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
These were the ward stones used to bind me? Perhaps even the ogres have heard tale of my strength!

==Completion==
Thank you for the aid, but saving me will not stop the ogres.

They already have enough life essence to complete the ritual!
