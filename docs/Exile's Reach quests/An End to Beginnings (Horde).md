==Objectives==
Speak with [[Kalecgos]] to travel to the [[Dragon Isles]].
*Speak with Kalecgos within the [[Wild Coast]]

==Description==
You've done well here, <name>. Kalecgos and [[Wrathion]] are planning to continue on to the Dragon Isles.

I must return to [[Orgrimmar]]. This [[shadow magic]] is concerning... and requires that I look into it more.

Talk with Kalecgos. He'll get you to the Dragon Isles and inform you about what's going on there.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of these rewards:
|Expeditionary Leather Tunic#Horde
|Expeditionary Mail Armor#Horde
|Expeditionary Plate Chestpiece#Horde
|Expeditionary Cloth Robe#Horde
}}

You will also receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Completion==
The Dragon Isles is a beautiful place, <name>.

I must be on my way, but first let me give you a hand.

==Notes==
*This is your last chance to pick up a [[Horde Tabard]] from [[Provisioner Jin'hake]] at the [[Horde Camp]]. This unique design cannot be obtained once you leave the island.

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Kalecgos, can you bring our new recruit to the Dragon Isles? I must return to Orgrimmar and share what happened here.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|After such a daring rescue, how could I refuse? <name>, let me know when you're ready to depart. I'll catch you up on the way.}}

Speak to Kalecgos:
{{Dialogue|
Thank you for freeing me from that terrible ritual.

There's much to do within the Dragon Isles. We can speak about it along the way.

{{Gossip|Quest=|Take me to the Dragon Isles and tell me about what's happening there.}}
}}
:You will not be able to return to Exile's Reach. 

:Are you ready to continue your adventure in the Dragon Isles?

:Yes/No

That Df cinematic plays out.

On the other side, the character and Kalecgos are in the [[Wild Coast]].

;Objectives
Ride a Horde Wyvern back to Orgrimmar.
*[[Horde Wyvern (Exile's Reach)|Horde Wyvern]] rode back to [[Orgrimmar]]

;Description
We're done here. Let's return to Orgrimmar.

When you're ready, hop on one of the [[wyvern]]s.

It's time to go home.

;On accept
:{{text|say|Warlord Breka Grimaxe|Mount a wyvern and fly home to Orgrimmar. Glory awaits us.}}

;On the wyvern
:{{text|say|[[Herbert Gloomburst]]|To think those brutes could wield such magic. If only I had more time to study it!}}
:{{text|say|[[Crenna Earth-Daughter]]|I am glad that you do not. This island must be allowed to heal.}}
:{{text|say|[[Shuja Grimaxe]]|Look, <name>, on the horizon. One of our [[gunship]]s!}}
:{{text|say|Warlord Breka Grimaxe|An impressive display of the Horde's strength. Those ogres would do well to run and hide.}}
:{{text|say|Warlord Breka Grimaxe|Come, recruits. It is time we return to our home.}}

This completes the Horde Exile's Reach storyline. As the player leaves the island, a cutscene plays, with narration varying based on the player character's race:
*Orc: "''Though the orcs came to this world seeking conquest, your people now stand proudly among its greatest champions.''"
*Troll: "''Renouncing the brutality of other troll tribes, you and your fellow Darkspear protect your allies with cunning ferocity.''"
*Tauren: "''As one of the wise and noble tauren, your physical might and spiritual resolve honor the legacy of your ancestors.''"
*Undead: "''The undead Forsaken may be shunned by the living, but your people strive to rise above the ruins of the past and forge a new future.''"
*Blood elf: "''Though the blood elf homeland was nearly lost to tragedy and betrayal, your people have reclaimed your birthright and seek a brighter destiny.''"
*Goblin: "''As members of the Bilgewater Cartel, you and your fellow goblins have sided with the Horde for the promise of adventure... and profit!''"
*Pandaren: "''Like many pandaren, you have known a life of harmony on the traveling isle of Shen-zin Su. But your intrepid spirit yearns for adventure.''"

;Completion
It's good to be back in Orgrimmar.

I must report to the [[warchief]], but I know what you can do in the meantime...
