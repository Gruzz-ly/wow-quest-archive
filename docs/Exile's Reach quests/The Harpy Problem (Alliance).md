==Objectives==
Meet with [[Henry Garrick]] near the [[Harpy Roost]].

==Description==
We need to find the remaining survivors of my expedition before the [[ogre]]s sacrifice them for their dark ritual!

I saw one of the survivors being dragged away by some [[Harpy|harpies]]. They have a roost to the north.

[[Kee-La]] and I will meet you up there with a scouting report.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||4}}
* 440 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It seems the harpies are up to no good. We'll need your help with this.

==Notes==

On your way toward the Harpy Roost, you'll pass by a [[Lightspawn (Exile's Reach)|Lightspawn]], which offers the optional quest [[Freeing the Light]].
