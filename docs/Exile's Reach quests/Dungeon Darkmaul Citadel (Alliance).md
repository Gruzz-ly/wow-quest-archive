==Objectives==
Complete the [[dungeon]], "[[Darkmaul Citadel (instance)|Darkmaul Citadel]]".
*Use the [[Group Finder]] to enter the dungeon, "Darkmaul Citadel"
* [[Gor'groth]]'s final ritual stopped
* Speak with [[Captain Garrick]] to leave Darkmaul Citadel

==Description==
You've slown down [[Gor'groth]]'s efforts to control [[Kalecgos]] atop the citadel, but the ritual itself needs to be thwarted.

You must storm the citadel and stop him from completing the ritual. His dark magic is an affront to the [[Light]].

We will need all the help we can get. Gor'groth's most elite lieutenants await within the citadel.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of the following:
*[[Expeditionary Cloth Hood]]
*[[Expeditionary Leather Helm]]
*[[Expeditionary Mail Helm]]
*[[Expeditionary Plate Helm]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|60}}
* 3,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You must go and slay Gor'groth before it is too late!

==Completion==
Fine work, Brazelbur. It's time for you to continue on to the [[Dragon Isles.

==Notes==
;Inside the dungeon
Jaina, Captain Garrick, and Henry are gathered near the entrance.
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|Let's move. I'll draw the ogres' attacks. The rest of you focus on taking them down.}}
Most of the ogres killed in the first room:
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|We've almost cleared the room! Keep pushing!}}

;Tunk
On approach:
:{{text|say|[[Henry Garrick]]|That's one of Gor'groth's top lieutenants! Can we really defeat him?}}
:{{text|say|[[Captain Garrick]]|We haven't come this far to quit now. <Name>, you lead the attack. I'll charge in after you.}}

Aggro:
:{{text|yell|Tunk|Me gonna smash, you no stop ritual!}}
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|I'll keep his attacks focused on me. Henry, you heal us up!}}
:{{text|say|Henry Garrick|Understood, captain!}}

;Victory 
:{{text|yell|Tunk|Me never... see Gor'groth... win...}}
:{{text|say|Captain Garrick|No time to waste. We've got Gor'groth cornered!}}

;Gor'groth and Kalecgos
Entering the [[Terrace of Reanimation]]:
:''Gor'groth summons a group of [[Decaying Corpse]]s.''
:{{text|say|Gor'groth|Puny vermin! You will not stop the ritual! Not after all we have done!}}

If a player dies:
*{{text|yell|Gor'groth|Hah!}}
*{{text|yell|Gor'groth|Puny vermin!}}

Gor'groth at 40% health:
:{{text|say|Gor'groth|We... will be... the final sacrifice!}}
:{{text|say|[[Henry Garrick]]|No! He's completing the ritual!}}
:''Gor'groth gives his life energy to the ritual. As he dies, his body turns to stone.''
:{{text|say|Henry Garrick|Nothing happened... I think we stopped it!}}
:''[[Kalecgos]] rises from the ground with a fearsome roar.''
:{{text|yell|Kalecgos|I can't... control my actions! Survive while I... dispel this foul magic!}}
:{{text|say|[[Wrathion]]|Is the [[Dragon Aspects|Aspect]] of Magic so easily subjugated? Fight it, Kalecgos!}}

Kalecgos defeated:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Free at last! Let us leave this place at once!}}
:''Jaina, Captain Garrick, Henry, and Wrathion gather in front of Kalecgos, who transforms into his [[visage]] form.''

;Speaking to Kalecgos
{{dialogue|
Well this is an interesting way to meet! I am Kalecgos, aspect of the Blue Dragonfilght.

I thank you for helping me break that foul ritual. I believe there may be some other force that was aiding the ogres.

Shall we get out of here? There's adventure awaiting within the Dragon Isles.

*{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready to get out of this citadel.}}
*{{gossip|Tell me more about what it means to be an aspect of the Blue Dragonflight.}}
{{dialogue-child|
Of course! You can consider aspects to be the leaders of their respective dragonflights. 

There are [[Black dragonflight|Black]], [[Red dragonflight|Red]], [[Green dragonflight|Green]], [[Bronze dragonflight|Bronze]], and [[Blue dragonflight|Blue]]. My dragonflight is focused on the preservation of [[arcane magic]].

{{gossip|(Back)}}}}
