* Ride any [[mount]] from your mount collection

Before you head off, you'll want to get yourself a Hearthstone.

Test out that new mount of yours and ride over to Sil'nori Crestshade. He'll get you sorted out with a Hearthstone.

You will receive:
* 510 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Sil'nori Crestshade nearby can get you set up with a Hearthstone.

==Completion==
If you ever find yourself lost, use your Hearthstone to get yourself back to where you should be.
