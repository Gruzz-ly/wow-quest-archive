==Objectives==
Slay 8 [[ogre]]s within [[Darkmaul Citadel]].
*Ogres slain  (8)

==Description==
This is bad, <name>. [[Captain Kelra]] is bound by magic, the ogres are preparing to attack our friends, and the ritual is almost complete!

I have to stay calm. We can't give up now, right?

This may sound risky, but we need to take the fight to the ogres.

We're behind enemy lines, so we'll be able to get the jump on them and draw their focus away from [[Alliance Camp|the camp]].

Take down any ogres that you can. That should keep them away from our friends.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of the following:
*[[Expeditionary Cloth Gloves]]
*[[Expeditionary Leather Gloves]]
*[[Expeditionary Mail Gauntlets]]
*[[Expeditionary Plate Gauntlets]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost||10|15}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You need to slay the ogres so they don't go after our friends back at the camp.

==Completion==
This should buy us enough time to stop the ritual!

==Notes==
[[Ogre Brute]]s, [[Ogre Shadowcaster]]s, and the [[Ogre Chef]] count toward this quest. [[Jugnug]], [[Wug]], and [[Grunk]] do not.

==Progression==
{{The Missing Expedition Alliance}}
