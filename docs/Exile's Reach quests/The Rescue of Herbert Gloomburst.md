==Objectives==
Rescue Herbert Gloomburst from the [[Harpy|harpies]]' necromantic ritual
*[[Herbert Gloomburst]] rescued
*Meet Herbert Gloomburst at the [[Harpy Roost]] entrance.

==Description==
The harpies plan to sacrifice the expedition's [[mage]], a [[Forsaken]] by the name of Herbert Gloomburst.

Herbert's ethics are... questionable, but he always strives to serve the [[Horde]]. We'll need his magic to stop the [[ogre]]s.

Let's move.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Completion==
Thanks for the save! They must be desperate for sacrifices if they wanted to use someone who's already dead.

If anyone is going to drain my life essence to use in a forbidden ritual, it's going to be me!

==Notes==

:''Both run into the [[Harpy Roost]].''

Herbert Gloomburst is being held with dark magic. Speak to him:
{{Dialogue|
Isn't this ironic! The harpies were JUST discussing using me as bait to capture more members of the Horde.

And now you come strolling up here! By the way, they're going to attack you at any moment.

{{Gossip|quest=|I'll fight the harpies that come. Can you use your magic to break free?}}
}}

:{{text|say|Herbert Gloomburst|A shame I must break such a fascinating spell. Keep the harpies away from me!}}
:''After a couple waves of harpies attack, you're joined by two friendly faces.''
:{{text|say|Bo|I've got your back! Let us strike them down!}}
:{{text|say|Shuja Grimaxe|You do not fight alone! Lok-tar ogar!}}
:''A few more waves of harpies and [[worg]]s appear, then...''
:{{text|say|Bo|Something big is coming this way!}}
:{{text|say|Shuja Grimaxe|Then we slay it together. For the Horde!}}
:''With a screech, the [[dread raven]] [[Bloodbeak (Exile's Reach)|Bloodbeak]] appears from the sky.''
:''As Bloodbeak dies, Herbert is released from the magic. He lets out a maniacal laugh.''
:{{text|say|Herbert Gloomburst|I'm free! Hahaha! Ahem. Let's make ourselves scarce, shall we?}}
:''Shuja, Bo, and Herbert all run back to where you started outside the Harpy Roost.''

Rescue Herbert Gloomburst from the harpy's necrotic ritual
*Herbert Gloomburst rescued

;Description
The forsaken that is in the ritual up ahead must be Herbert Gloomburst.

This must truly be vile magic if it's even being used against the undead.

Herbert is an insane mage, but he always strives to aid the Horde. We'll need his magic to stop the ogres.

Let's move.
