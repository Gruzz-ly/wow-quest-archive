==Objectives==
Use [[:Stealth]] to sneak around and find the first expedition's [[rogue]].
* [[Coulston Nereus|First expedition's rogue]] found
* [[Withering Hemlock]] (3)

==Description==
A rogue from the lost expedition, [[Coulston Nereus]], tried scouting the island for any threats after they made landfall.

The last time [[Henry Garrick|Henry]] saw him, he was headed for a cave not far from here.

Can you make contact with Coulston? He may be able to help with our rescue mission.

Oh, and be careful when heading north. [[Alaria]] spotted [[Killclaw the Terrible|a vicious bear]] roaming the area.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
*{{ability|Instant Poison|Poison|icon=ability_poisons}}

You will receive:
* {{cost|||30}}
* 250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you get the roots? Make sure that bear is far away when you pick them.

==Completion==
Here's the secret to making these poisons. It took me ages to learn it.

Now that I've taught it to you, it should be easy enough for you to make more whenever you need it.

==Notes==

;Speaking to Coulston
{{Dialogue|
Finally, some help! You must be here to help rescue the expedition here.

I was killed trying to take down the ogre that captured us. It healed itself instantly every time we hit it!

I'd bet this same ogre is looking to capture your friends. There's nothing that seems to stop it.

Except poisons. I can teach you how to make a poison that should remove this ogre's special healing.

You in?

{{Gossip|I'm in. How do I make this poison?}}

You're gonna need three withering hemlocks. 

I'll show you how to make some potent poisons if you bring me those hemlocks.

Just make sure the bear isn't too close to you when you pick 'em. The little things make a lot of noise.

{{Gossip|Get three withering hemlocks and make sure the giant bear isn't near me when I do it. Got it.}}

{{text|say|Coulston Nereus|You can craft a deadly poison from those roots. Gather them while the bear is far away.}}
