==Objectives==
Practice using Polymorph against Herbert and Grunt Throg.
*Speak with [[Herbert Gloomburst|Herbert]] to begin sparring
*Practice [[:Polymorph]] with Herbert or [[Grunt Throg|Throg]]

==Description==
I can't send you off without making sure you can cast Polymorph correctly.

Why, if you messed it up you may transform someone into something completely different!

I want to make sure I'm around to take notes if that happens.

Let's see... ah, Throg will do nicely! I can spot a prime test subject from a mile away.

Shall we begin?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
This will be so exciting! Let me know when you're ready to test polymorph.

==Completion==
You've got the hang of Polymorph. Make sure to use it whenever you're faced with more than one foe! 

==Notes==
;Speak to Herbert
{{gossip|I'm ready to practice polymorph.}}
:{{text|say|Herbert Gloomburst|Throg, assist me. We will both attack <name> and teach them how to use [[:Polymorph]].}}
:''Herbert and Throg make their way onto the paved area in front of the Ogre Ruins.''
:{{text|say|[[Grunt Throg]]|I'd rather not be turned into a sheep.}}
:{{text|say|Herbert Gloomburst|That's the kind of thinking that prevents learning!}}
If you use a damaging spell instead of Polymorph:
:{{text|say|Herbert Gloomburst|You've got two foes attacking you now. Even the odds with Polymorph!}}
;Herbert polymorphed
:{{text|say|Grunt Throg|I know this tactic. You keep one foe polymorphed while you focus on the other.}}
:{{text|say|Grunt Throg|Hitting your enemy will break the spell. Attack Herbert to get him back to normal.}}
Attack Herbert:
:{{text|say|Herbert Gloomburst|You're a loose cannon, recruit. I'm impressed! Let's get back to camp.}}
:''Herbert and Throg head back to the [[Horde Camp]].''
OR...
;Throg polymorphed
:{{text|say|Herbert Gloomburst|Observe! Your polymorphed foe will wander around. Use that time to finish off whoever is left.}}
:{{text|say|Herbert Gloomburst|I suppose you'd better hit Throg to break the spell.}}
Attack Throg:
:{{text|say|Grunt Throg|I don't think I learned anything from that.}}
:{{text|say|Herbert Gloomburst|Well I wasn't teaching you, now was I?}}
:''Herbert and Throg head back to the Horde Camp.''
