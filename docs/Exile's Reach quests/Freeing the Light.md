;Disabling the pedestals
As you dispel the magic of each [[Ritual Pedestal]], the Lightspawn speaks:

:{{text|say|Lightspawn|But the ogres ensnared me... drained my power...}}
:{{text|say|Lightspawn|Free me, so I might recover... and pass some of my power to you.}}
On the final pedestal:
:''Light begins arcing between the pedestals, then flows into the Lightspawn.''

:{{text|say|Lightspawn|Ahh, freedom! You have my gratitude.}}
