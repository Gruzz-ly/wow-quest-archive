==Objectives==
Speak with the ghost paladin.
*Speak with the ghost paladin
*Speak to [[Daelya Twilightsbane]].

==Description==
While you were destroying that army of the [[undead]], the [[ghost]] of a [[paladin]] approached me... and asked for you!

They floated over to the ruins nearby.

You should see what this ghost wants. I do not know much about the [[Light]]... but I know not to ignore a ghost.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Divine Shield]]

You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Greetings, <name>. It is good to finally see you.

==Completion==
Those who serve the Light will know its blessing. Accept this gift, paladin.

Call upon it when your strength fails and when hope seems lost. The Light will protect you from harm.

:The Light's presence is weak here. But your struggles have not gone unheard.

:I have been sent here to bestow a boon upon you, one who is a novice paladin.

:{{gossip|What does the Light wish of me?}}
::To protect those as you would wish the Light to protect you.<!-- sic -->

::Do not fret if you fail. The Light loves us for our victories and our failures.

::All the Light wishes is for you to try. To strive to do good... and to try again if you stumble.
