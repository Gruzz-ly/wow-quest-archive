==Objectives==
Use the Re-Sizer on 3 Wandering Boars.
*Re-Sizer v9.0.1 tested on [[Wandering Boar]]s (3)
*Speak with Thrall.
*[[Re-Sizer v9.0.1]] (provided)

==Description==
I call this gadget "the Re-Sizer." It's what I used to unshrink the [[Choppy Booster Mk. 5]].

Look, I'm gonna be honest. I got, at best, a passing understandin' of how this thing works.

That means I'm gonna be pushing a lot of buttons to see what happens.

I'm sure we'll figure out how to upsize one of these [[boar]]s. Then we'll use it to trample those [[undead]] goons!

You hold the Re-Sizer while I fiddle with it. Then just press the button and, uh... hope for the best?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Just don't point the Re-Sizer at me, okay? Use it on the boars.

==Completion==
Cork turned the device meant for enlarging things into a weapon capable of untold destruction?

The goblins in Orgrimmar may give him an award for this.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Cork Fizzlepop|Well, I promised a giant boar. Now we just gotta deliver.}}

;First boar
:''You hit the boar with the Re-Sizer; it shrinks to the size of a mouse.''
:{{text|say|Cork Fizzlepop|Huh. That ain't right. Let's see... just gotta... there! Try it now.}}

;Second boar
:''The boar explodes in a burst of blood.''
:{{text|say|Cork Fizzlepop|Oh ho! Who needs a giant boar when we can do THAT? Here, try it again.}}

;Third boar
:''The Re-Sizer fires balls of electricity at the boar, dealing heavy damage. The boar is dead in seconds.''

==Progression==
{{The Missing Expedition Horde}}

==Previous versions==
;Pre-''Midnight'' completion
So the giant boar was a fool's errand, and you turned the device into a weapon instead?

Good work. Let's see if you can pull this off.

;Beta description
I got this thing called the Re-Sizer. It's what I used to unshrink the Choppy Booster Mk 5.

I'm gonna be honest, I got at best a passing understandin' of how this thing works.

That means I'm gonna be pushing a lot of buttons to see what happens.

I'm sure we'll figure out how to make one of these boars gigantic. Then we'll use it to take out those undead!

You hold the Re-Sizer while I fiddle with it. Then just press the button and, uh... something will happen.
