==Objectives==

*[[Drizza Sidestabber|First expedition's rogue]] found
*[[Withering Hemlock]] (3)

==Description==
[[Shuja Grimaxe|Shuja]] mentioned a rogue from the first expedition. Goes by [[Drizza Sidestabber]].

Drizza was last seen heading northwest... towards [[Killclaw the Terrible|a large bear]]'s den.

None of us can sneak around like you. See if you can find Drizza and bring her back here. 

==Rewards==
You will learn: {{ability|Instant Poison|Poison|icon=ability_poisons}}

You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you get the roots? Make sure that bear is far away when you pick them. 

==Completion==
Here's the secret to making these poisons. It took me a long time to figure it out.

Now that you know how to make 'em, you can kill that ogre for me!<!--

  Here's the secret to making these poisons. It took me ages to learn it.

  Now that I've taught it to you, it should be easy enough for you to make more whenever you need it.

:{{text|say|Grunt Throg|Drizza surely had to evade danger in such hostile territory. Use Stealth to do the same.}}

;Speaking to Drizza
{{dialogue|
You got the look of a rogue. There's a powerful ogre out there that captured part of the first expedition.

This ogre probably wants to capture your friends, too! This thing is crazy tough, but it can be weakened with poisons.

I was trying to make a poison to weaken it when I got killed. You get the supplies, and I'll show ya how to poison your weapons.

Deal?

{{gossip|I'm in. How do I make this poison?}}

You're gonna need three withering hemlocks.

I'll show you how to make some potent poisons if you bring me those hemlocks.

Just make sure the bear isn't too close to you when you pick 'em. The little things make a lot of noise.

{{gossip|Get three withering hemlocks and make sure the giant bear isn't near me when I do it. Got it.}}
