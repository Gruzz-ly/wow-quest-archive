==Objectives==
Ride the Giant Boar to destroy the undead army.
*Ride the [[Giant Boar]]
*[[Monstrous Cadaver]] slain (8)
*[[Torgok]] slain
*Find [[Wrathion]].

==Description==
We don't know how long the re-sizing will last, so let's get moving.

You're going to ride this giant boar and mow down the army of [[undead]] between us and [[Wrathion]].

The large ones are pulsing with [[Shadow (magic)|shadow magic]]. If you kill them, I bet it they'll take out any enemies near them.

Let's hope Wrathion is willing to help us find [[Kalecgos]].

==Rewards==
You will receive one of these rewards:
*[[Expeditionary Dagger]]
*[[Expeditionary Short Sword]]
*[[Expeditionary Cudgel]]
*[[Expeditionary Longbow]]
*[[Expeditionary Quarterstaff]]
*[[Expeditionary Staff]]
*[[Expeditionary Greatsword]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost||11|30}}
* 750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Why are you talking to me? GET ME OUT OF THIS!

==Completion==
It's about time someone showed up!

I almost thought I'd have to rescue myself.

==Notes==
Interact with the [[Giant Boar]] to ride it. You have one ability while on the boar:
*{{Abilities|Trample|Command the giant boar to charge forward, increasing its speed and sending any skeleton in its way flying into the air.|cd=1 sec|notes=Instant|id=305556|icon=ability_mount_charger}}

The [[Monstrous Cadaver]]s can only be killed with Trample. If you run into one without using Trample, the boar will simply be knocked back.

;Torgok
Aggro:
:{{text|say|Torgok|We take soul for ritual, you no stop!}}

Defeat:
:{{text|say|Torgok|Me never get... to see... ritual...}}
:''Wrathion is released from the dark magic holding him. Jaina appears in front of him.''
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Honestly, the indignity of it all...}}

;On completion
:''A cutscene begins.''
:{{text|bossemote|Wrathion|Kalecgos is here somewhere, captured in his dragon form.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Wrathion|These idiotic ogres are trying to start a ritual to gain control of him and his magic!}}
:''A pillar of purple magic bursts from [[Darkmaul Citadel]] to the northwest. More magic flies into it from the [[Harpy Roost]], [[Hrun's Barrow]], and the Darkmaul Citadel approach.''
:{{text|bossemote|Wrathion|And there it is.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Wrathion|Kalecgos and his power will be theirs if these rituals finish!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I will do what I can to slow down their magic while our forces disrupt these foul rituals.}}
:''Jaina grabs her staff off her back.''
:{{text|bossemote|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|We will not let Kalecgos fall to such beasts.}}
:''She holds her staff aloft.''
:{{text|bossemote|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|For the Alliance!}}
:''Jaina, Wrathion, and you run off. The cutscene ends.''

By now, the crew has set up [[Alliance Camp|a small camp]] nearby. Jaina can be seen channeling bolts of arcane magic at the Darkmaul Citadel ritual. A few expedition members stand at the nearby roads to [[Hrun's Barrow]] and the [[Harpy Roost]].

[[Captain Garrick]] in camp offers the next quest.

==Progression==
