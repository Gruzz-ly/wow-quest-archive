==Objectives==
Defeat 10 [[Harpy|harpies]] and their allies.
*Harpies and cohorts slain (10)

==Description==
The harpies are preparing for a dreadful assault, <name>.

They plan to attack our allies [[Alliance Camp|back at camp]]!

Harpies swoop in and snatch their victims before bringing them back to their nests... to feast.

We have to stop them. Slay the harpies and their [[worg]]s to ensure their forces are too weak to stage an assault.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||1|25}}
* 880 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must do what we can to fight the harpy menace. Take them down, as well as their [[worg]]s.

==Completion==
That should keep our camp safe for now. We must hurry and stop whatever these [[ogre]]s have planned.
