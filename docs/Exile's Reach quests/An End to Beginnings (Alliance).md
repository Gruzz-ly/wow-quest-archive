==Description==
You've done fine work within [[Exile's Reach]], recruit. You should continue on to the Dragon Isles.

I'm afraid I must change my plans and go back to [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]]. I need to find out how the ogres found such powerful [[Shadow (magic)|shadow magic]].

I'm sure we'll meet again. I can tell you've got many adventures ahead of you.

==Completion==
The Dragon Isles... it's a beautiful place, but also deadly.

Let me help you get ready for what's ahead.

Thank you for freeing me from that terrible ritual.

There's much to do within the Dragon Isles. We can speak about it along the way.
