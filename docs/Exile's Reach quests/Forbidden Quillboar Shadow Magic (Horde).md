==Objectives==
Slay 7 Quilboar within the [[Quilboar Briarpatch]].
*[[Quilboar]] slain (7)
*Meet [[Mithdran Dawntracker]] to the north of the Quilboar Briarpatch.

==Description==
Quilboar are savage and violent. I did not think they knew how to use [[shadow magic]].

Obviously, we cannot allow them to continue their rituals. And certainly not on members of the [[Horde]].

Slay the quilboar in the den. They must learn the fatal error of their ways.

You will also receive:

==Completion==
A fine job. The quilboar seem to be keeping their distance. Perhaps they learned their lesson. 

==Notes==
*Eligible mobs are [[Quilboar Warrior]]s and [[Quilboar Geomancer]]s.
*While you're in the area, make sure to kill the [[Ogre Overseer]] for some extra experience and a [[Battered Cloak]].

==Beta version==
{{Rfb-section}}
The quilboar are a rather savage [[race]]. It's concerning that they've resorted to necromancy.

Obviously, we cannot allow this filth to get away with performing their twisted rituals on the Horde.

Slay the quilboar ahead. They need to learn the Horde are here... and to stay out of our way.
