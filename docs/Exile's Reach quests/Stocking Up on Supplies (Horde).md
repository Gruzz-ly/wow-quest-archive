==Objectives==
Purchase any item from Provisioner Jin'hake and sell any of your items to him.
*Any item purchased from [[Provisioner Jin'hake]]
*Any item sold to Provisioner Jin'hake

==Description==
Provisioner Jin'hake managed to recover some other supplies from the shipwreck.

Take a look at what he has before heading out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*[[Standard Issue Knapsack]]

==Progress==
Provisioner Jin'hake should have some supplies that you can use.

==Completion==
We've got to be prepared for anything on this island.

Also, [[Grunt Throg|Throg]] found this bag nearby and thought you might have use of it.

==Notes==
[[Provisioner Jin'hake]] sells two items here: 5x [[Tough Jerky]] for {{cost|||25}} or a [[Horde Tabard]] for {{cost|||25}}. This is the only way to get this tabard design; it can't be found on any other item, and this item can't be purchased once you leave the island (even from Jin'hake).

==Progression==
{{The Missing Expedition Horde}}
