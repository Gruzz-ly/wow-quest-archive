==Objectives==
Gather 4 veil blossoms to burn on the campfire in order to rescue the [[Spirit wolf|ghost wolf]]'s [[pack]].
*[[Veil Blossom]] (4)
*Blossoms burned on campfire
* Captured [[Ghost Wolf (Exile's Reach)|ghost wolves]] freed (3)

==Description==
Greetings, young one. Your companions cannot see me. Only you, for you have been trained in the ways of a [[shaman]].

The necrotic energies of [[Exile's Reach|this island]] have ensnared my pack. I need your aid to free them.

Gather veil blossoms from the surrounding area. Burn them on the campfire and breath deep of their smoke.

Then you will be able to see my packmates and release them from their bonds.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Ghost Wolf]]

You will receive:
*{{cost|||30}}
*500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The veil blossoms shall grant you the sight you need to rescue my pack.

==Completion==
My pack and I are too weak to oppose the dark forces on this island.

We will use the last of our strength to grant you our power.

Use it to rid the island of the [[ogre]]s' [[necromancy]].

Free the countless [[soul]]s they have trapped here.
