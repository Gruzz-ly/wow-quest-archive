==Objectives==
Set fire to 5 Harpy Totems.
*[[Harpy Totem]]s burned (5)

==Description==
The [[Harpy|harpies]]' [[totem]]s are scattered throughout the area.

Harpies are known for using their [[magic]] to corrupt those nearby. Even now, I can hear foul whispers in the air...

We must destroy these totems before any of us are tainted by their dark magic!

==Rewards==
You will receive one of the following:
*[[Expeditionary Cloth Cord]]
*[[Expeditionary Leather Belt]]
*[[Expeditionary Mail Waistguard]]
*[[Expeditionary Plate Girdle]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost||1|25}}
* 880 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The totems are not particularly powerful. A simple light and tinder should do.

==Completion==
The foul magic in this area is dissipating. I think we're safe for now.
