;Speaking to Herbert
{{Dialogue|
{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready, transform me into an ogre and I'll sneak into their citadel.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Herbert Gloomburst|A willing test subject! Such a rare find.}}
:''Herbert and Crenna cast {{abilities|Ogre Transformation|id=313583|icon=inv_misc_ogrepinata}} on you. It works and you become an ogre, with a handful of chains connected to Thrall, Breka, and Shuja.''
:{{text|say|Warlord Breka Grimaxe|Good. Now act like an ogre and get us inside.}}
:{{text|say|Shuja Grimaxe|Don't speak. Just smile and wave. The dumber you look, the better.}}

;At the front steps
:{{text|say|[[Ogre Shadowcaster]]|More sacrifices! Go to cooking pit, wave at [[Gor'groth]]. Show what you got!}}
:{{text|say|Warlord Breka Grimaxe|Keep moving. See if we can learn anything about the ritual.}}

;At the cooking area
As you approach:
:{{text|say|Gor'groth|What do we have here... all the sacrifices we thought we lost!}}
Type <code>/wave</code> to Gor'groth:
:{{text|emote|You wave at Gor'groth.}}
:{{text|say|Gor'groth|Take them to the back. We'll seal them in with the ward stones like we did their leader.}}
:{{text|say|Gor'groth|It is time to complete the ritual atop the citadel. Then all will bow before us!}}
:''Gor'groth teleports away.''
Before you move on, type <code>/dance</code> if you want:
:{{text|emote|You burst into dance.}}
:''[[Grunk]], [[Jugnug]], [[Wug]], and the [[Ogre Chef]] start dancing too.''
:{{text|say|Grunk|This one got some moves!}}
:{{text|say|Ogre Chef|You dance good!}}
:{{text|say|Warlord Breka Grimaxe|I said act like an ogre, not dance like one!}}

;At the citadel entrance
:{{text|say|Shuja Grimaxe|[[Warlord Mulgrin Thunderwalker|Warlord Thunderwalker]]! Quickly, help me destroy these seals!}}
:''You release your allies from their chains, and they run toward the captive warlord.''
:{{text|say|Warlord Breka Grimaxe|Raw strength won't be enough. We need to end the spell.}}
:''The ogre transformation ends and you revert back to your previous appearance.''

==Trivia==
* This quest is a common roadblock for new players, who are confused by the direction to "type /wave to Gor'groth" and type "wave", "wave to Gor'groth", or similar into [[Newcomer Chat]].

==Beta version==
;Description
{{Rfb-section}}
We need to get into Darkmaul Citadel, rescue the last sacrifice, and stop the ogre necromancer behind all this.

Herbert and Crenna are going to perform a ritual to turn you into an ogre... and then you're going to take us in as prisoners.

We do not have the strength for a full assault, so this will have to do.

Speak with Herbert when you're ready.
