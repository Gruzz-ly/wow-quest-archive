'''Warming Up''' is the first quest in the [[Exile's Reach storyline]]. After creating a character and choosing [[Exile's Reach]], a small cutscene will play; then, you'll find yourself on a Horde boat in front of [[Thrall]], who offers the quest.

==Objectives==
Warm up by fighting a Combat Dummy.
*Destroy a [[Combat Dummy]]

==Description==
We're nearing the [[Exile's Reach|island]] where the [[Horde]]'s last expedition was lost.

You need to be prepared for what's out there. Warm up on these combat dummies.

Show me your strength!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||55}}
*200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Go and attack those combat dummies. Let's make sure you remember the basics.

==Completion==
Good, you've kept training since we set sail.

I must investigate this storm. Some unnatural force is behind it.

Spar with Throg. He will assess your skills and decide on your role once we make landfall.
