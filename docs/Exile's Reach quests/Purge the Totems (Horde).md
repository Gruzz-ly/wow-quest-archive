==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Harpy Totem.jpg|Harpy Totem|These totems are empowering the harpies. They must be destroyed!}}
Set fire to 5 Harpy Totems.
*[[Harpy Totem]]s burned (5)

==Description==
The [[Harpy|harpies]] have placed vile [[totem]]s throughout the area to attain more power.

We must destroy those totems in order to debilitate our foes.

Take this torch and burn any totems you see. It is wise to weaken one's enemy before the fight even begins.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of these rewards:
|Expeditionary Cloth Cord#Horde
|Expeditionary Leather Belt#Horde
|Expeditionary Mail Waistguard#Horde
|Expeditionary Plate Girdle#Horde
}}

You will also receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
The totems are not particularly powerful. A simple light and tinder should do.

==Completion==
The harpies grow weaker with their totems destroyed. Let us hope they realize that the [[Horde]] is a force to be reckoned with.

The harpies have vile totems throughout the area.

They use these totems to increase their power. If they are against us, then we must destroy these totems.

Take this torch and burn any totem you see. We must weaken our foe if we are to achieve victory against them.
