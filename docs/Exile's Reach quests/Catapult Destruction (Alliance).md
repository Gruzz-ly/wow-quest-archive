==Objectives==
Blow up 4 [[Catapult (Exile's Reach)|catapults]] within [[Darkmaul Citadel]].
* Catapults destroyed (4)

==Description==
Did you notice the catapults on our way up? It appears the [[ogre]]s plan to attack our allies below.

[[Lindie Springstock|Lindie]] anticipated something like this and provided several bombs to handle siege weapons.

Just don't shake them too hard.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||10|15}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Just place the bombs next to the catapults and they'll do the rest.

==Completion==
Fine work. This will give everyone at [[Alliance Camp|base camp]] a fighting chance.

==Progression==
{{The Missing Expedition Alliance}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.2.7|note=Updated from the [[Catapult Destruction (Alliance Shadowlands)|previous version]].}}
