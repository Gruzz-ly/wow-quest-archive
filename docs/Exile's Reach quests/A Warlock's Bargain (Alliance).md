==Objectives==
Investigate first expedition [[warlock]]'s corpse
* [[Hubert Lucas|Dead warlock's body]] investigated
* [[Old Grimoire]]
* [[Summoned Voidwalker (Exile's Reach)|Voidwalker]] summoned with grimoire

==Description==
While you were mowing down hordes of [[undead]], I was scouting more of the area with [[Lindie Springstock|Lindie]]'s [[Scout-o-Matic 5000|device]].

I saw what looked like a [[portal]] out near the bridge, along with the corpse of a warlock we thought was lost in the shipwreck.

Think you can go investigate the area and try to close that portal? We have enough problems on this island as it is.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Summon Voidwalker]]

You will receive:
* {{cost|||30}}
* 500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I see you have the grimoire that enacted the binding ritual.

==Completion==
Our bargain has been struck.

Call upon me from the Void, and I will answer.

<The voidwalker looks at the worgen's corpse.>

Let us see if you are stronger than those who came before you.
