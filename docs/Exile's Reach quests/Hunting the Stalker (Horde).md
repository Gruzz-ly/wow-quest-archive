==Objectives==
Use your Freezing Trap within the Ogre Ruins to lure out the beast stalking the camp.
*[[Freezing Trap|Freezing trap]] used within [[Ogre Ruins]] to capture [[Stalking Prowler|stalker]]

==Description==
Now that you have your trap, we can move onto the true problem at hand.

A strange creature not native to this island has been stalking [[Horde Camp|our camp]].

I think we should capture it and see how it can help us.

Set the freezing trap within these ruins to lure it out. We'll see just what we are dealing with.

==Rewards==
You will learn:
*{{ability|Call Pet|Call Pet 2}}

You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Use the Freezing Trap anywhere within the Ogre Ruins. Just don't do it right within the camp.

==Completion==
I admit, I am rather ashamed I did not immediately recognize this beast.

It must be quite resilient if it was able to survive this long on its own!

Here, let me teach you another trick. You'll want to have multiple pets to switch between if you're to be a hunter of any worth.

==Notes==

;Setting the trap
:''A beast appears and walks toward the Freezing Trap. It's the same beast that you might have noticed next to Mithdran during [[Brace for Impact (Horde)]]. As it touches the trap:''

:{{Text|say|Mithdran Dawntracker|Look, it approaches!}}
:{{text|say|Mithdran Dawntracker|Caught it!}}
:{{text|say|Mithdran Dawntracker|Wait, I recognize this beast... it was aboard our ship! It must have survived the crash.}}

==Progression==

==Beta description==
We'll be dealing with a bigger problem, now that you can trap.

A strange creature not native to this island has been stalking our camp.

I think we should capture it and see how it can help us.

Use the freezing trap within these ruins to lure it out. We'll see just how much it can help us.
