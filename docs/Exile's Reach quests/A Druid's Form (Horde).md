==Objectives==
Commune with the nearby druid stone.
* Commune with the [[Druid Stone]]

==Description==
Thank you for rescuing me, <name>. Allow me to aid you in your [[druid]]ic studies.

To escape from the pit, I took on the form of a stag. I may know of a way you can learn to do the same.

Come with me. There is an ancient druid stone nearby. Let us use it to commune with the wilds.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
*[[Travel Form]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost||1|10}}
* 500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Come. We have no time to lose.

==Completion==
Good! I can sense the blessing of the spirits flowing through you.

Focus, and you should find that you can take on a new form.
