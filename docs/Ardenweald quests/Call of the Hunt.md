==Objectives==
Seek out [[Hunt-Captain Korayn]] in [[Glitterfall Basin]].

==Description==
You've done so much, but [[Winter Queen|the Queen's]] focus is still divided across [[Ardenweald|the forest]].

If you want to deliver your message, then we need to help lessen her burden.

Let's start with the [[Wild Hunt]]. They are the protectors of Ardenweald, and dealing with the threat of the masked fae has stretched them thin.

Seek out Hunt-Captain Korayn at Glitterfall Basin. Last I heard, her hunting party could use reinforcements.

And don't let her ferocity put you off. She's quite nice as long as you're not her prey!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|48|5}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Lady Moonberry said she would be sending a strong hand to help secure this grove.

Now, how are you in a fight?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|The Wild Hunt protects Ardenweald in the queen's name. Helping them might ease her burden!}}

Before leaving [[Tirna Vaal]], [[Guardian Kota]] starts a side quest chain, beginning with [[In Need of Gorm Gris]].

For this quest, exit Tirna Vaal to the west and take the northwest fork in the road to reach [[Glitterfall Basin]].

Approach Korayn:
:{{text|say|Hunt-Captain Korayn|Hail, mortal. Lady Moonberry speaks highly of you.}}

Upon completion, the [[Lady of the Falls]] starts another optional side quest, starting with [[Trouble in the Banks]].

==Progression==
{{Glittering Falls}}

==Beta version==

;Description
You've done so much already, but the [[Winter Queen|Queen]]'s presence is still too divided.

We need to help her restore balance.

Then, maybe she will stay still long enough for you to deliver your message!

For instance, the [[Wild Hunt]] have been called to Glitterfall Basin, but they were quickly overwhelmed. We need their muscle to drive out these invaders.

Go, and seek out Hunt-Captain Korayn.

Oh, and don't let her ferocity deter you. All [[vorkai]] are like that. Just don't get between her spear and her prey.

;Completion
Lady Moonberry sent you here? We could use a strong hand to help secure this grove.
