==Objectives==
Find [[Hunt-Captain Korayn]] on the [[Path of Rebirth]].

==Description==
The [[Wild Hunt]] has answered the call to defend us... except for Hunt-Captain Korayn and her forces.

She had led her hunting party to the west, on the trail of a [[Lorkron the Hunter|powerful foe]]. They may have encountered trouble.

Find her and provide whatever aid she requires. 

We need her hunters and her leadership if our defenses are to hold.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|52|70}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
These Drust thought to send a force to strike us from behind. 

<Korayn smirks.>

Your call brought my fellow huntsmen and huntresses to reinforce us. Our foes were the ones caught by surprise.

==Notes==
Head southwest to find Korayn and a few [[Wild Hunt Swifthoof|Swifthoofs]], [[Wild Hunt Nightblade|Nightblades]], and [[Wild Hunt Deadeye|Deadeyes]]:
