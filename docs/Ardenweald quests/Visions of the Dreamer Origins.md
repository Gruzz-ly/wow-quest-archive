==Objectives==
Grapple with the spirit's vision of their origin.

If you leave the Vision, interact with a Dreamer's Vision portal in [[Dreamshrine Basin]] to enter again.
* Enter the [[Dreamer's Vision]] {{co|61.2|56.7|Ardenweald}}
* Nightmares slain (10)
* [[Abandoned Whelp]]s comforted (6)

==Description==
The spirit within the wildseed dreams of her birth and youth, in the primordial days of [[Azeroth|her world]].

Go to the first Dreamshrine outside of [[Hibernal Hollow]]. Meditate at the shrine, and soothe this vision of how her life began.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you seen what dreams have come?

==Completion==
We all start somewhere. Sometimes in unexpected places. Me, I just popped out of the ground like a flower.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|The nightmares may not be real... but they can still hurt you. Be careful.}}

Pick up both quests before heading out. It does not matter which portal is entered - both quest objectives are in the same phase, accessed via either portal.

Should players enter the first Dreamer's Vision to the south:
:<The veil between Ardenweald and the Dreamer's Vision is weak here. The drumbeat of ancient wings can be heard.>
{{gossip|<Go back to the Dreamer's beginning.>}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|The spirit dreams of her past, of the events that shaped all others to come...}}
The phase changes, showing a great deal of [[Not-Friend]] ghostly black protodrakes. Additionally, [[Food (Ardenweald)|Food]] in the form of [[elk]] can be eaten to recover some health.

Further north, a [[Daughter (Ardenweald)|Daughter]] (Merithra) is hovering, looking at an [[Adopted Son]] (Cenarius):
;Daughter
:Mother, if only you were here with me. Our kin still have hope, but we struggle without you.
:I need your guidance.

;[[Cenarius|Adopted Son]]
:You were the mother that walked the path of the dream with me. You taught me so much.
:The world needs you.

Immediately to the north, a [[Student (Ardenweald)|Student]] (Malfurion) is speaking with a [[Dear Friend]] (Tyrande)
;[[Malfurion Stormrage|Student]]
:My beloved made the right choice, when she tried to save you. I grieve for the way it ended. 
:The Dream will never be the same.

;[[Tyrande Whisperwind|Dear Friend]]
:My friend... I mourn your loss, and the part that I had to play in it.
:I hope that this is not the end.

Other nearby fears include [[Corruption (Ardenweald)|Corruption]], [[Desertion]], [[Extinction (Ardenweald)|Extinction]], [[Failure]], [[The Unknown]], [[Uselessness]], and [[Weakness (Ardenweald)|Weakness]].

Off to the northwest, a [[Consort (Ardenweald)|Consort]] (Eranikus) sits forlorn:
:I miss you, my love. 
:We will be together again in the Dream, one day.

Finally, at the northernmost end of the quest area, [[Azeroth's Demise]] hovers by itself.

Kill all hostile mobs and interact with the friendly Abandoned Whelps.

;Initial
*{{text|emote|Abandoned Whelp whimpers.}}
*{{text|emote|Abandoned Whelp shivers in terror.}}

;Reassured
*{{text|emote|Abandoned Whelp cuddles you.}}
*{{text|emote|Abandoned Whelp shakes off its fear.}}
*{{text|emote|Abandoned Whelp roars mightily!}}
*{{text|emote|Abandoned Whelp wipes away its tears.}}

Complete all objectives:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|So much left unfinished. So much remorse and regret...}}

No need to exit the dream, run to the northwest to find the [[Worldbreaker (Ardenweald)|Worldbreaker]] for [[Visions of the Dreamer: The Betrayal]].

Once both quest objectives are done, simply run back to [[Dreamweaver]].
