==Description==
<Marasmius sighs.> <They're at it again, up in the Stalks.

Seems like we didn't give them enough of a thrashing the first time, eh? What say you and I team up again and teach those younglings a lesson they won't forget?

Let me know when you're ready and we'll get 'em, just like before!>
