==Objectives==
Collect 6 Giant Gorm Gris.
* [[Giant Gorm Gris]] (6)
*Deliver the Giant Gorm Gris to Gormsmith Cavina.

==Description==
[[Foreman Thorodir|Foreman]],

Our supply of gris is running low. You know as well as I do that there is no end to Glitterfall Basin's need of it.

I've overheard from some of the other workers that you have a bit of a gorm problem. But the bigger the gorm, the bigger the gris, right?

If you happen to harvest some more, we can certainly put it to good use.

<The work order is signed: "[[Gormsmith Cavina|Cavina]].">

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|37|20|60}}
*12,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have something for me?

==Completion==
It really is a remarkable substance. We use it in practically everything! Construction, mending, crafts, and it can even be added to rations.

==Progression==
{{Trouble at the Gormling Corral}}

==Beta version==
