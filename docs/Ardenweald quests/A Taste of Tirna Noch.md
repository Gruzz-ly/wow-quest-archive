==Objectives==
Collect 6 Leafy Loam in [[Tirna Noch]].
* [[Leafy Loam]] (6)

==Description==
I'm a simple mushroom with simple pleasures, <name>. And what's simpler than a nice, hearty meal?

Don't look so surprised. I need to eat just like anyone else! How else do you think I grew so big? Nice, tasty compost, that's how!

Back in my day, I had the pick of [[Ardenweald]] for where to feed. Now, not so much.

I've had a hankering for some of the loam that used to be around Tirna Noch. I haven't had shoots out there in a long time. Could you bring me some?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Marasmius]]

==Progress==
Tirna Noch is a beautiful tree located east of Hibernal Hollow. You can't miss it.

==Completion==
Mmmm, it smells just like how I remember it! Maybe a little stale, but you won't hear me complaining about a job well done!
