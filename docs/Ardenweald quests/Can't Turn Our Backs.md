[[File:Can't Turn Our Backs.jpg|thumb|The [[Winter Queen]], [[Lord Herne]], and a carpet of dead [[Mawsworn]].]]

==Objectives==
Check on the [[Winter Queen]].
*Check on the Winter Queen {{co|47.1|48.6|Ardenweald}}

==Description==
That's [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] and her Mawsworn dealt with... for now.

But we need to make sure that the Queen and her [[sigil]] are safe.

The Winter Queen was just outside the [[Heart of the Forest]], protecting the stolen [[wildseed]]s from the Maw.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|57|40}}

==Progress==
The forest answers.

==Completion==
[[Ardenweald]] depends on the cycle. Without these spirits, what purpose would there be?

I could not let [[the Jailer]]'s forces destroy what we have fought so hard to protect.

==Notes==
Southwest to the heart, past where the southern rally point was. The corpses of mawsworn carpet the ground, and while [[Elite Queensguard]] cover the entrances, [[Spirit Tender]]s are channeling into [[wildseed]]s.

Speak with the Winter Queen:
:The Jailer threatened to destroy these spirits we may yet save. He underestimated how nature will fight to keep balance.
