==Objectives==
Witness the decision.
*Speak to [[Malfurion Stormrage]]

==Description==
I am eager to return to the [[Emerald Dream]] and defend the gardens from the [[Incarnates]] and [[Primalists|their followers]]. But I cannot leave [[Ardenweald]] yet, not with my bond to the [[Winter Queen]].

I dare not ask anyone to do this, unless they accept the consequences. As I did.

But there is one who could take my place.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is settled. I will remain in Ardenweald.

I remain to protect the Dream and all the hope that grows within it. It must be me.

==Notes==
On accept, an [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] immediately starts:

:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Ysera, [[Green dragonflight|your flight]] needs you.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|We need you.}}
:''Tyrande starts building steam.''
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Whatever the price may be for your return to [[Azeroth]], name it.}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Tyrande...}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Tell us!}}
:''Ysera silently looks to Malfurion.''
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|It's me.}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|I must be the one to stay.}}
:''This stops Tyrande short.''
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|What?}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Ysera knows this--though she would never ask it of me.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|No.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|We will find another way.}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|When she gave her life for mine in [[Val'sharah]], it was not her time.}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|And now... the balance may be restored.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Then... then I will stay as well.}}
:''Tyrande turns away.''
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|[[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris]] and the others can...}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Tyrande...}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Should everything we hope come to pass, the Kaldorei will need you.}}
:''Tyrande sighs.''
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|I am so tired, Malfurion.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Do not ask this of me.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|After everything we have endured...}}
:''Tyrande closes her eyes and lowers her head. Malfurion lifts her chin with a finger.''
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|My love.}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|You have always been the strength of our people.}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|They will follow you ever onward, and you will never be alone.}}
:''They hug.''
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Until I see you again...}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|I will dream of the night we may truly rest... together.}}
