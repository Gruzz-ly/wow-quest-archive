==Objectives==
Find [[Caretaker Lillythistle|Lillythistle]] in the [[Gossamer Cliffs]].

==Description==
We are running short on silk! We use it for so many things, like instruments, weapons, and tools. But our supply has dried up!

We are in desperate need for fresh silk.

Our main hub of silk production is in the Gossamer Cliffs. If you could, seek out Caretaker Lillythistle, and see what the holdup is!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Of course silk shipments have stopped!

The entire glade has been attacked by [[Boggart|changelings]] and [[spriggan]]s! Our poor [[silkstrider]]s are so stressed out, we can't get any silk from them!

Can you help us?
