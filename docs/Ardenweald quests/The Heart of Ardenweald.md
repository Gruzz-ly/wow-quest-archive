==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Heart of the Forest]].
*Winter Queen's Sigil discovered {{co|47.8|53.6|Ardenweald}}
*Return to the Winter Queen outside the Heart of the Forest.

==Description==
I hid my [[sigil]] in the Heart of the Forest, to keep it safe from the forces of the [[Maw]].

But the horn has called for aid.

You and your allies go, see what has prompted the call.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Queen's Frozen Tear]]
* {{cost|12|87}}

==Progress==
Is my sigil safe?

==Completion==
Our best efforts were still in vain.

Our enemy's plan edges closer to fruition.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|I concealed my sigil within the Heart of the Forest, where it could be best protected.}}
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|But our enemies are cunning. Go, ensure that it remains safe.}}

Follow the path south, to where [[Bolvar Fordragon]] and [[Jaina Proudmoore]] are standing.
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|I fear we may be too late.}}

Speak with Bolvar:
:We cannot fail, not after we have fought to drive [[Sylvanas]] out of [[Ardenweald]].
:{{gossip|Is the sigil safe?}}

A real-time cutscene takes place:
:''Jaina, Bolvar, and the [[Maw Walker]] run up to the entrance to the Heart, but a Maw-flavored barrier appears and blocks their passage.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|[[Anduin]]! No!}}
:''Inside, among several [[Night Fae]] corpses, Anduin is channeling a spell into the Heart itself, sucking the color from it and causing some of its branches to wither away.''
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Resist him! Do not let [[the Jailer]] win!}}
:''Anduin pulls the sigil of the Night Fae out of the Heart and absorbs it into [[Kingsmourne]], causing the blade to briefly flare blue.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|We will save you, Anduin.}}
:''Anduin opens a Maw Portal to exit, not even looking back.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|No matter what it takes.}}
