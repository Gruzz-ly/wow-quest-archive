==Objectives==
Rescue 8 trapped [[Night Fae|night fae]].
* Captives freed (8)

==Description==
Some of my people are still alive! We must rescue them!

The [[prisoner]]s are kept in [[cage]]s throughout the ridge, waiting for this horrible fate to befall them.

Please, set them free. We cannot let what happened to [[Lavrash]] happen to them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|37|20|60}}
* 12,950 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
I pray they can escape.

==Completion==
So few.... But each one is one more friend we can bring to bear against this madness!

==Notes==
Click on [[Enchanted Cage]]s to free [[Imprisoned Sylvar]] and [[Imprisoned Faerie]]s.
