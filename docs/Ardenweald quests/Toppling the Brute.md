{{questportrait|Blighted Beast.jpg|Blighted Beast|This creature has slain too many of the Wild Hunt. We must put a stop to it!}}
==Objectives==
Defeat the Blighted Beast
* [[Blighted Beast]] slain {{co|66.4|49.4|Ardenweald}}

==Description==
A nearby monstrosity has been thwarting our efforts to clear the meadow.

Together, we can bring it down.

You and I will face off against the beast. When the time is right, I will call for the hunt to charge.

The [[Wild Hunt]] has suffered too many losses. Today we will claim victory against these monsters!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Grove Defender's Maul
|Heartwood Bow

|Grove Defender's Pummeler
|Meadow Guardian's Shield
|Grove Defender's Spear

}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|3|80}}
* 7,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Fine work, <name>. This won't win our war... but it will at least help us in the fight for Soryn's Meadow.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ara'lon|<Name> and I strike first. The rest of you attack when I sound the horn!}}

Just to the east is a Blighted Brute. Aggro it, and let Ara'lon tank.
:{{text|yell|Ara'lon|For Queen and grove!}}

At 50% health or so, the brute will enrage, go immune, and snag Ara'lon, tossing the [[Wild Hunt Horn]] from his grasp:
:{{text|yell|Ara'lon|No! The horn!}}
:{{text|yell|Ara'lon|<Name>! Take up the horn!}}

Find the horn, pick it up, and use the Call the Wild Hunt extra button:
:{{text|yell|Ara'lon|Wild Hunt! Now!}}

The defenders will finish off the brute.
:{{text|say|Ara'lon|Well struck! Return and regroup!}}

Return to the tree:
:{{text|say|Ara'lon|This was but one battle. I fear many more await us.}}
