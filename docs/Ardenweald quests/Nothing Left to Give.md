Oh no, oh no!

My friends, they gave so much. So much of their [[anima]], they lost their forms! We all take a form when we come here, you see. Something that suits us!

But we give our anima, we give! To help the groves. And we give so much, that sometimes it's too much.

I still have some anima. I still have my form! Get me to my friends! We can get THEIR forms back!
