==Description==
<Featherlight checks his notes.>

Let's see... There was a request for help regarding an imperiled wildseed and... something about an egg? The original note wasn't entirely clear, but the fae who sent it was... Ah! It was Korenth. Again.

Well, I suppose we'll find out what his trouble is soon enough!

I'll fly ahead and look for him. Stick to the path.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|49|14|}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You survived!

==Completion==
That was fun to watch! You had that bird ready to build a nest and raise hatchlings!

Oh, how I needed that laugh...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Featherlight|Korenth is always getting into trouble. Let's see what it is this time.}}

Head southeast down the path. Korenth runs out of the woods, then heads back north:
:{{text|say|Korenth|Featherlight! Over here!}}

Speak with Korenth:
:I was supposed to take care of them... but they were taken!
:{{gossip|I'm standing in for Lady Moonberry. What happened?}}
:There is so little anima, and I've had to say goodbye to so many slumbering spirits; friends I've looked after for ages.
:But Elder Dunmira is so close to her time of awakening, I couldn't say goodbye like that! 
:I moved her wildseed to a spot where I thought she could get a little more anima to make it through, and then that terrible creature stole it! I think the bird is trying to incubate it like an egg.
:{{gossip|What's a wildseed?}}
:They're the purpose of Ardenweald! Wildseeds contain slumbering nature spirits like Elder Dunmira. Who is under that bird. If you could coax it off the nest for me, I could sneak in and grab her!
:I'm glad Moonberry was able to send someone if she couldn't come herself. You know she normally wants a song and dance for her help?
:<Korenth chuckles.>
:So you'll help me get that bird off the nest?
:<Korenth smiles hopefully.>
*{{gossip|I'll help you.}}
*{{gossip|<Request a song and dance, as Moonberry would have done.>}}

Should players ask for the song and dance...
:{{text|say|Korenth|Well... if you insist...}}
:{{text|emote|Featherlight laughs.}}
:''Korenth briefly performs Song and Dance.''
:{{text|say|Korenth|Lady Moonberry... is the finest faerie... is this really necessary?}}

Speak with Featherlight:
:You know I think I have just the thing for this situation.
:Hold still. This probably won't hurt.
:{{gossip|<Hold still?>}}
:{{text|whisper|Korenth|Try to coax the bird away from the nest!}}

Featherlight transforms the player into "Valeshrieker", a bird with two abilities:
#{{Abilities|Strutting|Shake your tailfeathers|cd=8 sec|notes=Channeled|id=332339|icon=ability_druid_flightform}}
#{{Abilities|Singing|Sing your heart out!|cd=5 sec|notes=Channeled|id=332343|icon=artifactability_survivalhunter_eaglesbite}}

Use the abilities as they come off cooldown. At 50%:
:{{text|say|Korenth|Keep it up! I'll just sneak past...}}

At 100%:
:{{text|bossemote|A twig snaps loudly under Korenth's hoof!}}
:{{text|emote|The valeshrieker notices Korenth.}}
:{{text|say|Korenth|Uh oh... umm... hello?}}
:{{text|yell|Featherlight|Run, Korenth!}}

Defeat the valeshrieker:
:{{text|say|Korenth|Thank you for saving the wildseed! I'll bring it to safety.}}
