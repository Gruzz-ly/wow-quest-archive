'''The Show Must Go On''' ends the ninth and final hidden local story of [[Guest Relations]], started on 19 November and required for [[Assistant to the Assistant Guest Relations Manager]].

==Objectives==
Help [[Dapperdew]] at [[Star Lake Amphitheater|the Amphitheater ]]in [[Ardenweald]].
* Ask [[Maru]] for a hint (Optional)
* Mystery solved (0/100%)
* [[Trickster's Riddles]] (provided)

==Description==
Thank you for coming! We've had a bit of a mishap with the script and various stage props.

They've all gone missing! It seems as though a prankster has decided to make a mockery of our productions and scattered several needed items throughout the area.

At least the prankster was somewhat considerate and left us some clues as to where we can find the missing items. Do you think you can help solve the riddles?

And please, do not carry any [[Torch of Pyrreth|open flames]] or shine any [[Idol of Ohn'ahra|bright lights]] while in our theater.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 5x [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Progress==
Use the play list to find the missing items in the area.

==Completion==
The theater thanks you for your valiant efforts this day!

==Notes==
[[Dapperdew]] hands over a book of [[Trickster's Riddles]], which reads:

{{book|content=Riddle #1:

* Pages whisper tales of falling water and starlight, resting near a scribe's forgotten ink.
----

Riddle #2:

* Amidst the sea of faces, where whispers weave tales of wonder, seek beneath the most grand position.

----

Riddle #3:

* Smiles hide secrets, locked away where laughter echoes loudest.

----

Riddle #4:

* Where harmony and rhythm converge lies the treasure sought by those attuned to the symphony of secrets.}}

The area is affected by {{Abilities|Respecting the Theater|id=466035|Open flames and bright lights are not allowed in the theater.|icon=spell_holy_silence}}
