==Objectives==
Slay 8 Anima-Starved wildlife.
* [[Anima]]-starved wildlife slain (8)
*Speak with Dreamweaver within the Tranquil Pools.

==Description==
Things are chaotic here in the [[Tranquil Pools]]. I'd be devastated if the [[Winter Queen]] saw this.

This is meant to be a peaceful place where we give anima to [[wildseed]]s.

But with the current drought, starving beasts have encroached on the pools and are trying to feed on the anima themselves.

Sadly, we need to put them down... or else they may endanger the spirits within the wildseeds.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|80|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hate having to do this, but if it's a choice between sparing the beasts and saving the wildseeds, I have to choose the wildseeds.

==Completion==
Normally, I wouldn't require help from whatever race you are.

Ah... my apologies. That was rude.

Please understand that Ardenweald is home to souls from across all of the mortal realm. It's hard for me to keep track of every race that arrives here.

==Notes==
Any "Anima-Starved" mob counts, including: [[Anima-Starved Stalker]]s, [[Anima-Starved Shrieker]]s, [[Anima-Starved Patriarch]]s, and [[Anima-Starved Matriarch]]s.

Once done with both quests, find Dreamweaver off to the west, getting a report form some [[Wildseed Tender]]s:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|The plants ate them? Not again...}}

==Progression==

==Beta version==

;Description
With our current anima drought, beasts starved for anima have come here trying to steal what belongs to the wildseeds.

They sadly need to be put down, or else they may endanger the spirits that reside in the wildseeds.

;Completion
Normally, this process doesn't require outside help from whatever species you are. 

Ah... my apologies. That was rude. 

Please understand that we receive a multitude of spirits from all of existence. It's hard for me to keep track of proper names of every race that comes through here.
