==Objectives==
Slay the [[Gorm]] Matriarch.
* [[Gorm Matriarch]] slain
* [[Gormherd Branch#Finish What He Started]] (provided)

==Description==
You tracked the massive gorm here to her den, and we've found [[Master Sha'lor]].

Perhaps not entirely unscathed, but he lives. That is enough.

One last task remains. Let us end this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|74|41|20}}
* 16,200 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
Tirna Vaal will not be safe with that monstrosity about.

==Completion==
How is that possible? The matriarch she... they feasted on the pods. What if there are others like her out there in Ardenweald?

We must report this immediately.
