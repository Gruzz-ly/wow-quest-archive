==Objectives==
Use Soulshape to collect anima from Proglo, then infuse the [[wildseed]] with the collected anima.
* [[Anima]] recovered from [[Proglo]] while in [[:soulshape]] {{co|59.9|54.0|Ardenweald}}
* Speak with [[Dreamweaver]] to perform ritual {{co|60.1|53.0|Ardenweald}}

==Description==
[[Dreamweaver]] tells me of a ritual to quell the wildseed's nightmares... but it will require [[anima]].

A [[soul]] named [[Proglo]] lives beneath this tree, gathering anima for the grove's caretakers to use.

His mortal life came to a violent end, and his soul has been skittish ever since. He will not respond well to your current form.

I will grant you the ability to assume the soulshape of a [[vulpin|fox]]. Approach Proglo in your new form to gain his trust and ask for his anima.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|51|90}}
* 3,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hope we can aid this wildseed.

==Completion==
It's going to be difficult, but I know of a place where there may be enough anima to help this wildseed.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Droman Aliothe|Accept this portion of my power, mortal. Use it to alter your shape into one that the soul below will find more... welcoming.}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|We'll prepare the ritual!}}

Head under the tree. Should players have not been soulshaped when they talk to [[Proglo]]:
:AH! What are you? Four spriggans in a whatever you call yourself costume?
:One of those blighted monstrosities? 
:Whatever you are just... just go away! Please?

Use [[Soulshape]], then head under the tree. Speak with the frog:
:Greetings! Are you here for the anima? Proglo has been making sure to keep it stored for any wildseeds that may need it.
:Those nasty spriggans and blighted creatures won't get their hands on this!
:Proglo is one of the bravest souls in Ardenweald. Nothing gets by him!
:{{gossip|Droman Aliothe said you were storing anima that we could use to help a wildseed.}}
:Of course! Proglo has saved this anima to use just for an event like this.
:Here you go. Take care, and if you need anything remember that Proglo is one of the bravest souls in Ardenweald!
:{{gossip|Thank you Proglo. I'll use this anima to help the wildseed.}}

Speak with [[Dreamweaver]]:
:I see the dreams of the spirits. They are beautiful.
:{{gossip|I'm ready to perform the ritual on the wildseed.}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Let's hope this is enough...}}
:''Magic beams into [[Dreamer's Wildseed]].''
:{{text|say|[[Niya]]|Did it work?}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|No... the nightmares still linger. We need more anima.}}
:{{text|say|Ara'lon|I may know where we can acquire more.}}

This concludes the "This is the Way" chapter of the [[Ardenweald storyline]]. The campaign continues with [[Echoes of Tirna Noch]].

;Description
Dreamweaver tells me of a ritual to purge the nightmares from this wildseed.

A [[soul]] named Proglo lives beneath this platform, gathering anima to use for wildseeds.

He's a skittish soul due to his violent [[death]]. He will not respond well to your current form.

I will grant you the [[ability]] to soulshape into a [[Vulpin|fox spirit]].

Use this to gain the collected anima from Proglo, then bring it to Dreamweaver.
