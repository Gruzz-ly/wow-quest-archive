==Objectives==
Use the Gormherd Branch to collect Wild Gorm Gris from [[gorm]] in the [[Dusty Burrows]].
* [[Wild Gorm Gris]] (10)
* [[Gormherd Branch#Finish What He Started]] (provided)

==Description==
Finding [[Master Sha'lor|Sha'lor]] is our main priority. But there is another opportunity.

Take the Gormherd Branch that he dropped. I know he was tinkering with it so that it would work on wild gorm.

Use it on the gorm in the burrows, and see if you can collect any of their gorm gris.

Don't bother with the little ones; get the really potent stuff from the bigger gorm.

Perhaps if we can collect enough, and find that silly [[sylvar]], he will not rush horns-first into the burrows again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|37|20|60}}
* 12,950 [[XP]]
*+160 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
Have you had any luck?

==Completion==
Well done. You've collected enough gorm gris to hopefully keep Sha'lor from venturing into the burrows all by himself, again.

And we should be able to send some to our friends in Glitterfall, once all this is over. 

Thank you.

==Notes==
The Gormherd Branch extra button becomes available. Use it on [[Gorm Spewer]]s and [[Gorm Borer]]s before (or during) engaging them in combat so that they would drop the quest item.
