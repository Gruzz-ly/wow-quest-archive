==Objectives==
Reach [[Droman Aliothe]] in [[Hibernal Hollow]].

==Description==
[[Lorkron the Hunter|Lorkron]] is here. 

I tracked him all the way from the [[Glittering Falls]]. Then I saw the [[Drust]] try to flank our forces.

I'd say they were rather surprised that we turned the tables against them.

<Korayn's smile is fierce. She lifts her weapon and her voice to address all present.>

Huntsmen and huntresses, with me! We ride to defend the grove! Take no prisoners and leave none standing!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|52|70}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This attack... It is like they are being driven!

==Notes==
On accept, the phase changes as [[Blighted Invader]]s, [[Witherscorn Annihilator]]s, and [[Witherscorn Rotmage]]s lay siege to [[Hibernal Hollow]]:
:{{text|yell|Hunt-Captain Korayn|Wild Hunt, with me! For Ardenweald!}}

Ignore the combat and return to Aliothe.

==Progression==
