==Objectives==
Bring the list of saved [[wildseed]]s to [[Droman Krelnor]] at the [[Heartwood Grove]].
* Continue down the road
* [[List of wildseeds]] (provided)

==Description==
I am surprised--but pleased--that you weren't torn to pieces! Well done.

But now... I fear we have a far more serious task to complete.

The Winter Queen has decreed that Heartwood Grove's anima is to be reclaimed, and its denizens must leave it to wither. Not all of their wildseeds will go with them. In fact, only a few have been chosen to be saved.

We are to bring the final list to Droman Krelnor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|45|70}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Move along, stranger.

==Completion==
<Droman Krelnor sighs wearily as he reads the short list of wildseeds.>

At least a few will be relocated to Tirna Vaal.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Featherlight|Follow me. Heartwood Grove isn't far.}}
:{{text|say|Featherlight|Each wildseed holds a spirit of nature who will one day awaken and return to their world.}}
:{{text|say|Featherlight|The Queen must decide which ones survive... and which wither away, the spirit within lost forever.}}
:{{text|say|Featherlight|It's... a grim task. But until the drought ends, it has to be done.}}
:{{text|say|Droman Krelnor|Look for refuge elsewhere, friend. This grove will soon be gone.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Te'zan|Featherlight! We be in need of help!}}

==Progression==
{{Welcome to Ardenweald}}

;Description
I am surprised but pleased that you weren't destroyed! Well done.

Now we have to move onto an easier but far less fun task.

The Heartwood Grove is being shut down. Not all of their Wildseeds will be saved. In fact, we're only sending a few to another grove. Your next task it to bring the final list to Droman Krelnor.
