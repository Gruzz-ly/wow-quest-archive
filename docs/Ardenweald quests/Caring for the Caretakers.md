==Objectives==
Free Spirit Tenders in the [[Dreamshrine Basin]].
* [[Trapped Spirit Tender]]s freed (8)

==Description==
The [[Drust]] attacked so quickly, they captured some of the spirit tenders of this grove!

It's not an easy job to do, between the drought and monsters and everything. I should know.

Please, see if you can get them out of whatever terrible magic those invaders have cast on them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|27|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found our caretakers?

==Completion==
Those Drust really are cruel to us fae! Those spirit tenders were just trying to do their job...

Thank you for helping them.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|More Drust will surely attack us soon. Please hurry!}}

Pick up both quests (and [[Despoilers]]) before heading out.

Down to the south is the first Dreamshrine. Interact with it and a few small [[Disturbed Nightmare]]s pop out:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|I've seen spirits have nightmares before, but nothing like this. The trauma this one must have been through...}}

Far to the northwest is the second Dreamshrine. Interact with it and a large Disturbed Nightmare pops out:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Well, it's pretty clear that this spirit won't dream peacefully until we confront what haunts it.}}

To the northeast, find [[Skell the Despoiler]]. Aggro her:
:{{text|say|Skell the Despoiler|Your anima will be mine!}}

Once all objectives are done, return to Dreamweaver and interact with the Wildseed.
