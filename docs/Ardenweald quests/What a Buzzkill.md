Deliver [[Buzzkill]]'s Stinger to [[Gormsmith Cavina]].

==Description==
What do you say? Fancy one more hunt?

One of those little flying pests has grown into a very large flying pest. Large, pristine [[gorm]] parts are hard to find in the best of times, and a [[smith]] always appreciates a challenge.

<Cavina's voice drops as he leans in towards you.> Besides, I'm worried about the safety of my family and the rest of us in the grove.

Bring me the stinger from that big fella and I'll make it worth your while.

Do we have a deal?
