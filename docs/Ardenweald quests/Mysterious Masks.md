==Objectives==
Collect 15 Featureless Masks.
* [[Featureless Mask]] (15)

==Description==
The village, my friends, gone. They are no more.

I came back from the nearby grove to find them... like this. Even [[Lavrash]], my best friend! He came at me with only violence in his heart.

They are all wearing these masks now, and they are not themselves any more.

Please, deliver them from this fate. Bring me their masks and perhaps we can decipher this mystery.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|37|20|60}}
* 950 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
For so many to fall, I did not think I was gone that long....

==Completion==
These masks must contain some secret to the possession.

==Progression==
{{An Ominous Stone}}
