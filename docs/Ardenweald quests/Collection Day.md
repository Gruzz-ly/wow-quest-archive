==Objectives==
Use the Gormherd Branch on Gloober, then collect [[gorm]] gris from the Gorged Gormlings.
* Gormherd Branch used on [[Gloober]]
* [[Fresh Gorm Gris]] collected
* Gormherd Branch tested on [[Gorged Gormling]]s (4)
*[[Gormherd Branch]] (provided)

==Description==
Now, we can collect the gorm gris for [[Guardian Kota]]!

Once the gormlings have eaten something, we can 'encourage' them to give it back up. What they produce, we call gorm gris!

My Gormherd Branch should encourage them to do this safely.

Go on, give it a try on good ol' Gloober first.

What has me worried is how the other gormlings might behave. They have been acting so strangely lately!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|30|15}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I wonder what would happen if I overcharged the Gormherd Branch... would that be more efficient? Or would it make things explode?

... probably explode.

==Completion==
Oh, this isn't right at all! The gormlings are supposed to return to their normal, adorable little selves.

What in the Queen's name is happening to them?

And there's no more gorm gris to give to Kota! This won't do at all.

==Notes==
Using the Gormherd Branch on Gorged Gormlings will turn them into [[Agitated Gorm]].
