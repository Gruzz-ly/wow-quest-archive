==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Unleashed Major Hex.jpg|[[Unleashed Major Hex]]|Slay an Unleashed Major Hex}}
Retrieve 5 [[Piece of Shredded Scroll|pieces of Shredded Scroll]] from Rotbriar [[spriggan]]s and a Tattered Binding from [[Unleashed Major Hex|a Major Hex]] to create a Sealed Scroll of Soul Rot.
* [[Sealed Scroll of Soul Rot]] {{co|60.9|25.9|Ardenweald}}
*Return the Sealed Scroll of Soul Rot to Lady Moonberry in the Heart of the Forest.

==Description==
Oh, dear me, this is terrible! Just terrible!

I know precisely which awful curse afflicts [[Qadarin|that poor soul]]! But these damnable spriggans keep stealing my scrolls, scattering them all over and ripping them apart! 

Now the falls are overrun with all manner of dangerous magic!

The spriggans have the pieces of the scroll you need. Gather them along with a binding from one of the major hexes, and you can put it all back together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hmm... Yes, this looks like it could be the one.

==Completion==
I knew Dreyden would have the scroll we need. We don't have time to waste!

==Notes==
Kill Rotbriar spriggan and loot a [[Piece of Shredded Scroll]] from them. Get five, then head to the southwest portion of the quest area and take out the [[Unleashed Major Hex]] for a [[Tattered Binding]]. Combine the parts to make the [[Sealed Scroll of Soul Rot]], then return to the [[Heart of the Forest]].
