==Objectives==
Investigate the unknown area.
* Travel to the Unknown
* [[Young Matriarch]] slain
* [[Pulsing Gorm Egg]]s destroyed (6)

==Description==
Come to pay old [[Marasmius]] a visit? I have a special task for you.

One of my shoots has found a strange place, a place even I've never seen before.

I'm not entirely sure what's in there or if it's even safe. But that's what my trusty mushroomancers are for!

What do you say, <name>? Up for an adventure? 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Marasmius]]

==Progress==
Keep your guard up. It could lead anywhere!

==Completion==
It's a good thing you were there. The gorm have been very hungry lately, and I do not appreciate being nibbled on. Never been my thing! 

==Notes==
Take the Mushroom to the Deep Unknown to see what variant Marasmius offers today.
:{{text|say|Marasmius|A gorm matriarch! She and her brood'll eat up all the ground around the network. Take her out, and make sure you get all those eggs too!}}
