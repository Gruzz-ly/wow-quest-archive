==Objectives==
Meet [[Ara'lon]] in [[Tirna Noch]].
*Listen to Ara'lon's tale {{co|60.1|52.8|Ardenweald}}

==Description==
It is clear that we need more anima than this grove can provide. I may know of a way we can acquire some.

Many of the masked fae have been collecting anima for some unknown purpose. I propose we take it back from them.

The Wild Hunt has tracked them to Tirna Noch... my former grove.

Long has it been since I walked beneath its boughs. Not since it was left to wither so that other groves might survive.

I remember it well...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|50|40}}
* 1,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I never thought I would return to Tirna Noch. The place of so many memories. So many regrets...

But now is not the time for sentimentality. Now is the time for action.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ara'lon|I will meet you outside of my former grove. A place of memories... and of loss.}}
:{{text|say|[[Niya]]|I will join you. Perhaps I can help find what we need.}}

Speak with Ara'lon again:
:I will defend Ardenweald at any cost.
:{{gossip|<Listen to the tale of Tirna Noch.>}}

A cinematic plays, "[[Afterlives]]: Ardenweald":

Exit to the east.

;Description
It's clear we need a great deal more [[anima]], more than this grove alone can provide.

Fortunately, I have an idea. The [[Wild Hunt]] has been watching these [[Possessed]], since they began to appear.

They are collecting anima. Why, we don't know yet.

We have been so busy fighting around [[Ardenweald]], we have not been able to investigate fully.

But we know where they are taking it.

Meet me outside of my old grove. I believe that even with a small force, we can take that anima back.
