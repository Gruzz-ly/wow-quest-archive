==Objectives==
Find somewhere to plant [[Marasmius]] in the [[Heart of the Forest]].
* Plant the Talkative Spore
* [[Talkative Spore]] (provided)

==Description==
I like you, youngling. You put in the work while the others sit in their fancy court, leaving old Marasmius to keep the fae rings thriving.

Here, take one of my spores back with you to the Heart of the Forest. Find somewhere nice and cozy for me to rest, will you?

Come back and visit me whenever you like. [[Cortinarius|Cort]] and I can keep an eye on things for now, but there will always be plenty for you to do here. Might even be something special in it for you.

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following: {{Abilities|Fae Rings|id=325330|icon=inv_misc_food_vendor_blanchedneedlemushroom}}

You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,100 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Marasmius]]

==Completion==
Ahh, it's nice to stretch out again. I've missed this place, you know.

<Marasmius pauses for a moment.>

Don't tell anyone here I said that, all right?

==Notes==
;On completion
:{{Text|Say|[[Zayhad, The Builder]]|Marasmius, has the wind borne your return?}}
:{{Text|Say|Marasmius|Zayhad, you old tree! The wind had nothing to do with it. Our young friend brought me here.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zayhad, The Builder|Then perhaps the fae rings will welcome us once more.}}
:{{Text|Say|Marasmius|Is that what you think? So far, only this mortal has shown me the proper respect.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zayhad, The Builder|Their efforts nourish us all. The Heart of the Forest thrives in your presence.}}
:{{Text|Say|Marasmius|Hmph. Well, I do like what you've done with the place. And it seems the Court works as diligently as ever.}}
:{{Text|Say|Zayhad, The Builder|Fertile soil must be tilled. Grow well, Marasmius.}}
:{{Text|Say|Marasmius|Don't be a stranger, Zayhad! Queen knows good company is hard to find.}}
