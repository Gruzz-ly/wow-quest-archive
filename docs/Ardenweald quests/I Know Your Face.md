{{questportrait|Lorkron the Hunter.jpg|Lorkron the Hunter|He hunts the Wild Hunt, and seems to know their tactics.}}
==Objectives==
Defeat Lorkron the Hunter.
* [[Lorkron the Hunter]] slain {{co|48.5|37.2|Ardenweald}}
* Speak to [[Korayn]] {{co|49.0|35.7|Ardenweald}}
*Return to Ara'lon at Glitterfall Basin.

==Description==
This voice... I have heard it before. Though it is distorted and vengeful now.

He hunts us.

But I am not prey. And I will not let him gloat over his slain quarry. That is not the way of the [[Wild Hunt]].

Though he may draw us to ground of his choosing, we will fight him.

And we will win. Are you with me?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Dreamthorn Spaulders
|Grove Warden's Shoulderplates
|Spirit Tender's Mantle
|Starshroud Shoulderpads
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|49|60|80}}
* 8,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It cannot be easy for Korayn to hunt one of our own... but she is right. The forest is not safe so long as Lorkron lurks within it.

What a terrible fate... both for those who become possessed, and those who must hunt them down.

==Notes==
Head west to the large clearing. Lorkron is riding a [[Blighted Monstrosity]]. Aggro it:
:{{text|yell|Lorkron the Hunter|Your hunt ends here, Korayn!}}

Korayn's ability from before works on the monstrosity and on Lokron... Use it on cooldown for some free damage!
:{{Abilities|Hunter's Strike|Tell Korayn to charge and strike a Blighted Brute.|range=30|cd=12 sec|notes=Instant. Does ~30% of the brute's health in damage.|icon=ability_rogue_surpriseattack|id=330680}}

Defeat the monstrosity and Lorkron hops off:
:{{text|say|Lorkron the Hunter|I serve a new master! One who will watch Ardenweald wither!}}
:{{text|say|Hunt-Captain Korayn|Then you are a huntsman no longer.}}

Get Lorkron below 50% health:
:{{text|yell|Lorkron the Hunter|No! I will not fall to my prey again. Beware the shadows, Korayn...}}
:{{text|emote|Lorkron the Hunter makes his escape!}}
:''The player has the Vile Roots debuff, stunning them.''

Speak with Korayn:
:<Korayn glares into the distance.>
:{{gossip|Who was that? What now?}}
:{{text|say|Hunt-Captain Korayn|A dear friend... twisted into a dire foe. He must be slain.}}
:{{text|say|Hunt-Captain Korayn|Return to Glitterfall Basin. My hunt has only just begun.}}

Head northeast up the hill to return to Glitterfall Basin. Turn in to Ara'lon.

==Progression==
{{Glittering Falls}}

==Beta version==

;Completion
Hunt-Captain Korayn has gone up the falls to continue hunting Lorkron? Then I agree, Ardenweald is not safe until he is caught, and slain.

It is difficult, to put down one of our own. 

I only hope that I am never turned as he was.

Thank you for your help this night.
