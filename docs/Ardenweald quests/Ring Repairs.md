==Objectives==
Use the Fungal Beacon to repair 6 Damaged Mushrooms.
* [[Damaged Mushroom]]s healed (6)
* [[Fungal Beacon]] (provided)

==Description==
The damage wrought here is severe, but it can be reversed.

My master is weakened by all this destruction, but mushrooms are difficult to completely eradicate. By restoring power to the rings throughout the grove, we can strengthen them once again.

Take this beacon. Use it near a damaged mushroom in a ring, and watch how quickly nature can heal its wounds.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Marasmius]]

==Progress==
The rings will be made whole again.

==Completion==
Together we are strong.
