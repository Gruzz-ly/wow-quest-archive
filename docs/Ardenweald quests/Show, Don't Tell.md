==Objectives==
Commune with Lady Moonberry.
*Commune with [[Lady Moonberry|Moonberry]]
*Find Featherlight at the Star Lake Amphitheater.

==Description==
As a new champion of the Court, you'll need to be properly introduced to the rest of the Night Fae. And that calls for something big. Bold. Memorable. A demonstration of who you are and where you've come from. Something with... flair.

Normally, we spend ages crafting a masterpiece presentation. But we don't have time for that! We'll just have to improvise.

<Moonberry winks.>

Commune with me so I can pick up the highlights! I'll make sure it's a show to remember!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Just in time!

==Completion==
Oh good! You're here! No time to rehearse, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem.

==Notes==
Speak with Moonberry:
:Try to think heroic thoughts! When you're ready we'll begin.
:{{gossip|Let us commune with each other.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|I just need a quick glimpse into your dreams...}}
:''Moonberry channels a spell into the player, and when it ends she knocks the player out as the screen fades to black. On the other side...''
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Wake up, <name>! This will be a show to remember!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Best not to keep Featherlight waiting. Meet him at the theater!}}
:''Moonberry flies off.''

Exit to the northwest to reach the [[Star Lake Amphitheater]].

Backstage, check in with Featherlight.
