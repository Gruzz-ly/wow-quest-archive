==Objectives==
Witness the end of the spirit's life.
* Speak to [[Dreamweaver]] {{co|60.1|53.0|Ardenweald}}
* Witness the end of the [[Ysera|spirit's life]]

==Description==
The time has come. The ritual will be complete when you have fully entered into the spirit's dreams.

It will be as if you are her, in every aspect.

She relives the moment of her death over and over again. It torments her. Something about how she ended... she had no control over her actions. She hurt the ones she loved.

Speak to me when you are ready to immerse yourself in her nightmare of the end.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Dreamthorn Headgear
|Grove Warden's Greathelm
|Spirit Tender's Hood
|Starshroud Helm
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|50|54|40}}
* 8,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you entered into the spirit's final dream and witnessed her fate?1

==Completion==
What a terrible end for such a majestic spirit... 

But that was why she connected with you! Because you are of the same world! Azeroth!

Now, I can finally feel her nightmares wane. At last, she knows some peace.

Thank you, my friend.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|It's time. Enter the spirit's nightmare and bring her peace.}}

Speak with Dreamweaver again:
:I see the dreams of the spirits. They are beautiful.
:{{gossip|(Quest) I am ready to relive the Dreamer's nightmare.}}

The Val'sharah intro cinematic plays, showing Xavius corrupting Ysera, as originally seen in [[The Demon's Trail]]:
:''Xavius prepares the corrupted Tears of Elune and as Ysera charges to close the distance, magically fires it at her. It pierces her chest and painfully twists into her body. A burst of Nightmare energy bursts from the wound and knocks her out of the sky. Her crash forms a crater in the ground and when she rises, she has been fully corrupted.''

===Stage 1: Temple of Elune===
:''Begin the attack on the Temple of Elune.''
*Attack the Temple of Elune

On the other side of the cinematic, players are in control of Ysera, the corrupted, flying around the [[Temple of Elune (Val'sharah)|Temple of Elune]] in [[Val'sharah]]. They have access to one ability:
:{{Abilities|Attack the Temple|Begin the attack on the Temple of Elune.|notes=Instant|id=315345|icon=inv_misc_head_dragon_green_nightmare}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|It begins again... the pain and agony, the madness beyond measure...}}
:{{text|yell|[[Koda Steelclaw]]|Ysera is here! Steel your hearts and defend the Temple!}}

===Final Stage: Fall of Ysera===
:''Kill the defenders of the Temple of Elune.''
*Destroy the Temple of Elune (0/100%)

This replays [[The Fate of Val'sharah]] from Ysera's perspective.

After starting the attack, Ysera flies to the temple and lands, gaining three abilities:
#{{Abilities|Claw|range=20|cd=2 sec|Claw nearby enemies, inflicting X Physical damage across multiple targets.|notes=Instant|id=315410|icon=ability_xavius_tormentingswipe}}
#{{Abilities|Nightmare Breath|range=60|cd=6 sec|Unleashes a nightmarish blast, inflicting X Shadow damage to enemies in a cone in front.|notes=2 sec cast|id=315440|icon=sha_spell_fire_blueflamestrike_nightmare}}
#{{Abilities|Tail Swipe|range=30|cd=2 sec|Swipe your tail, inflicting X Physical damage across multiple targets and knocking them back.|notes=1 sec cast|id=315872|icon=inv_misc_voljinsshatteredtusk}}

Attack or not - Ysera does not have any self-healing abilities and there are an unlimited amount of defenders (including a cameo by the adventurer as "Hero". Other enemies include Temple Archers, Temple Guards, Priestesses of Elune, a Druid, Warrior, Hunter, Priest, Death Knight, Shaman, Koda, [[Lyanis Moonfall]], and [[Tyrande Whisperwind]]).
:{{text|say|Ysera|Forgive me, children. My actions... they are not my own...}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Now Xavius has me by the throat. I must abandon my beloved, and subdue the most beautiful creature I have ever known.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|This is your end, mortals. The Dream is undone!}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Not while I still draw breath.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Are you truly lost, Ysera? After all we have built? All we have done?}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|Do what you must, dear friend. It is the only way.}}<!-- Didn't show up, needs doublechecking. -->
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|By the light of Elune, we will end this madness!}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|My time draws near. I feel... her embrace...}}

Once Ysera falls, the Val'sharah epilogue cinematic plays:
:''[[Nightsong]] is heard in the background as Ysera falls to the floor of the Temple of Elune with one last roar, as Tyrande looks at her with regret. The Dreamer raises her head and looks up at the sky with a moan of pain, which darkens as the [[White Lady]] moves in front of the sun, creating a sudden solar eclipse. Lit only by the corona of the sun, Ysera's eyes change from dark red back to emerald green.''
:''Tendrils of lunar light extend down from the moon to Ysera, who lowers her head back to the ground.  As the light suffuses her body, it goes slack as the muscles release and she settles further to the ground; there is a feeling of acceptance as she finally succumbs to death and closes her eyes. The lunar beams gently lift Ysera's spirit, looking as if sleeping, from her mortal coil and into the sky, as the night elves watch in astonishment. With the neck extended to a curve and the wings lifted open to full extension, her spirit dissipates in the sky, the general outline indicated by new stars lighting up &mdash; a new constellation.''
:''The tendrils of moonbeam retreat into the corona and the solar eclipse passes; the night elves momentarily squint at the sudden return of daylight. Tyrande watches solemnly as Ysera's body literally fades in the returning sunlight: the ground blossoms with fresh grass and plants where the corpse touched the ground. From where it had pierced her chest a sapling grows among the grass, revealing the corrupted Tear of Elune, which then sheds off its Nightmare taint into red dust, becoming purified. The night elves lower their heads in sadness and respect as silence falls over the temple grounds.''

===Epilogue===
On complete, Lady Moonberry flies in:
:{{text|yell|Lady Moonberry|Hey! Everyone listen!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|We're not the only ones who witnessed that nightmare. The Drust are approaching as we speak!}}

This concludes the "Visions of the Dreamer" chapter of the [[Ardenweald storyline]]. The campaign continues with [[The Forest Has Eyes]] and [[The Droman's Call]].
