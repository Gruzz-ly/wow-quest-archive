'''Journey to Ardenweald''' begins the [[Ardenweald storyline]]. To be eligible for this quest, players must have concluded the [[Maldraxxus storyline]] and the interlude quests with [[Bolvar Fordragon]] in [[Oribos]].

==Objectives==
Travel to [[Ardenweald]], and find someone to take you to the [[Winter Queen]].
*Activate the Gateway to Ardenweald {{co|49.5|73.0|Oribos|1}}
*Speak to [[Pathscribe Roh-Avonavi|Roh-Avonavi]]
*Speak with Lady Moonberry in Ardenweald.

==Description==
The warning you received from the [[Primus]] needs to reach the [[Winter Queen]] of Ardenweald, <name>. The [[Eternal Ones]] must stand together against the coming darkness.

The Winter Queen oversees the cycle between Death and Life. In her forest slumber ancient spirits of nature that must be reborn.

I fear the anima drought will have taken an especially grim toll upon her realm. 

The night fae can lead you to the Queen. Bring her this message, and she will know what needs to be done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|45|70}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We haven't seen anyone come through the gateway in a very long time! Certainly not someone like you.

What brings you to Ardenweald?

==Notes==
No scripted event this time directing players upstairs, so take the transport rune to the [[Ring of Transference]] and had south to the six o'clock position. Interact with the Ancient Focus to spawn in the portal to Ardenweald, then speak with Pathscribe Roh-Avonavi:
:The way is open. You may now pass through to Ardenweald.

:{{gossip|I am ready. Send me to Ardenweald.}}

On the other side, [[Lady Moonberry]] and [[Featherlight]] are trying to awaken [[Zayhad, The Builder]], who shapes the forest.

:{{Text|say|Lady Moonberry|This will be a prank to remember! Just--oh! Hello there!}}

This message must reach the Winter Queen of Ardenweald, <name>. If we are to face this terrible threat, we need to muster support from all of the Pantheon.

Bring her this message, and she will know what needs to be done.
