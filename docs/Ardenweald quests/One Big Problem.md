Hunt down the Gorm Matriarch.

*Gorm [[Matriarch's Den]] located

==Description==
We must go after [[Master Sha'lor]]. [[Tirna Vaal]] needs him! And I... I...

I will report to the [[Droman Tashmur|droman]]. They must know that Sha'lor is in danger. Then, I will enter the burrows myself from the south and help you defeat it.

For now, see what you can find. I refuse to believe that he is gone.

That monster will know the fury of a [[vorkai]].

You will receive:

* 12,950 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
What's gotten into these gorm?

==Completion==
Well done. You drove the beast hard enough that she spat out Sha'lor. Now she hides in her den.

She has nowhere else to run.

Now we end this.

==Notes==
The matriarch is in the [[Egg Chamber (Ardenweald)|Egg Chamber]].
:{{Text|say|Master Sha'lor|Help! Is anyone out there? I'm still alive in here, despite the horribly corrosive acid!}}

Almost halfway through the fight, the matriarch escapes.
:{{Text|emote|The Gorm Matriarch burrows away!}}

Enter the second Egg Chamber.
:{{Text|say|Master Sha'lor|I do believe I may have found an exit! But I am not going that way! Help!}}

Once again, the gorm escapes.
:{{Text|emote|The Gorm Matriarch retreats into her den!}}

In the den, Kota and Sha'lor are found.
:{{Text|say|Master Sha'lor|Oof! Well, that was one way out.}}
:{{Text|say|Guardian Kota|Sha'lor! By the Queen's grace, it's good to see you.}}
