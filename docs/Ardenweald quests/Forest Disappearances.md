==Objectives==
Find [[Partik]].

==Description==
A moment of your time, friend?

A short while ago a [[sylvar]] named Partik came seeking the aid of our grove. He said his village was under attack by the [[gorm]] and was in danger of crumbling away altogether. I told him we could not spare any [[soldier]]s, but their people were welcome to take refuge with us.

However, it has been some time since he left and I have not seen or heard anyone from that region since.

Can you go investigate? He came from the northeast.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|48|5}}
* 1,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
No, no... what is happening!?
