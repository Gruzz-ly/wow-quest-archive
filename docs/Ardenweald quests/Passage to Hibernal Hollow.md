==Completion==
Dreamweaver has told me much about your strange wildseed. 

I will do what I can to help.

==Notes==
Speak with Ara'lon again:
:Let's not stay here for too long. You need to deliver that wildseed to Hibernal Hollow, yes?
:{{gossip|I'm ready to travel to the Hibernal Hollow.}}
:{{text|say|Ara'lon|Come, we ride for Hibernal Hollow.}}
:{{text|say|Niya|Thank you for escorting us, Ara'lon. It puts me at ease to know we are protected by a fierce huntsman.}}
:{{text|say|Ara'lon|I was not always so. I joined the Wild Hunt only recently... after my grove had to be sacrificed to save the others.}}
:{{text|say|Niya|My grove was lost as well... but not to the drought. We were overrun by masked fae. My friends...}}
:{{text|say|Ara'lon|I am sorry, Niya. If only the Wild Hunt could have been there... but our numbers are stretched perilously thin.}}
:{{text|say|Niya|As is the Winter Queen...}}
:{{text|say|Ara'lon|She bears the greatest burden of us all. We must do what we can to share it.}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Please, Aliothe. Help us end this spirit's nightmare!}}
:{{text|say|Droman Aliothe|Though our resources are stretched thin, I will do what I can.}}

Speak with Aliothe:
:Welcome to Hibernal Hollow.
:{{gossip|Who are you?}}
:I am Aliothe, Droman of the Hibernal Hollow. I protect the tree and all who live within these walls.
:But before that, I lived on a beautiful world full of lush forests and sparkling seas. I was a god, a powerful spirit of the wilderness. My fur was full of stars and my teeth could crack mountains.
:{{gossip|What happened?}}
:I died.
:Green fire rained from the heavens and burned our forests. Boiled our seas. I did all that I could, but it was not enough. My world died too.
:By the Queen's grace I was reborn here in Ardenweald, and the spirits here in the hollow are my responsibility.
:{{gossip|Don't you want to be reborn in your own world?}}
:Even if I still had a home to return to, I could not. This is the way of things.
