==Objectives==
Aid 8 subdued faeries.

==Description==
They need your help!

Not all of the [[Faerie|faeries]] have been turned yet. Some remain prisoner, but they have these masks on their faces....

You've got to help them! I'm not strong enough to pry off the masks, but you could! You could stop the guards from getting us too!

You will receive:
* {{cost|37|55|70}}
* 9,700 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
Please, we have to hurry! I know what comes next....

==Completion==
You saved my friends!

<Primrose gives you a small grin.>

We... we make a pretty good team, huh?
