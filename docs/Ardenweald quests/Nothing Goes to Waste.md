==Objectives==
Collect the Depleted Wildseed, place it in the gormling pen, and coax gormlings to eat it.
* [[Depleted Wildseed]] collected
* Depleted Wildseed placed
* Gormlings Coaxed to Wildseed (0/100%)

==Description==
The gormlings are industrious creatures. Naturally, they are our source of [[gorm]] gris.

Gormlings are cute, small, and hungry, like [[Gloober]] here! Except he is not hungry right now, because I just fed him. Look at that little belly...

<Ahem>. I digress.

Gormlings will be drawn to consume anything that is not brimming with anima. They find it simply delicious.

Take that [[wildseed]] there, and bring it into their pen. Then, see if you can get the gormlings to feast upon it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|30|15}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you fed the gormlings?

==Completion==
Well done!

The gormlings may be easily distracted, sometimes, but they are such helpful little creatures.

That is, when they are small.

The big ones are a different matter. But don't worry about those! I'm sure we won't have to deal with them.

==Notes==
Coax [[Docile Gormling]]s over to the Depleted Wildseed. Those that make it there will eat frm it and grow into [[Gorged Gormling]]s.
