Slay 12 Brittlebark invaders in the [[Growthworks]].

==Description==
If you want my help then you are going to need to help me first.

There is a group of [[spriggan]]s that have assaulted the growthworks to the northeast. They are causing all manner of havoc and I simply will not abide this trespass into my lands.

Go there and teach them a lesson. If they will not flee, then slay them on the spot!

* 12,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good. It is the way of nature for the stronger to prevail.
