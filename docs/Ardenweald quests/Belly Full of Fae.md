==Objectives==
Free 16 Wildseed Tenders from inside [[Devouring Hydra]].
* [[Wildseed Tender]]s freed from [[Hydra]]s (16)
*Meet Dreamweaver outside of Tirna Vaal.
* [[Hydra Gutter]] (provided)

==Description==
The local flora have gone somewhat wild during this [[anima]] drought.

It seems they swallowed most of the young fae who were tending to the wildseeds here.

At least now we know where they've been.

Oh, don't worry. This isn't the first time this has happened. We can last quite a while inside those plants.

Take my dagger. Use it to cut through the shrubbery and free the other [[Wildseed Tender|wildseed tenders]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Dreamthorn Chain
|Grove Warden's Girdle
|Spirit Tender's Cord
|Starshroud Belt
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|24|80|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It would be rude of me if I didn't show you how things work around here first.

==Completion==
Great work. This should help get the Tranquil Pools back to normal.

I admit, I had thought the worst when I couldn't find any of the tenders. I'm glad they were only eaten by the local vegetation.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Use my dagger to open the plants and free the others. We'll meet you in Tirna Vaal.}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Oh, and thank you again! Whatever world you're from, they're lucky to have you.}}

Each plant hydra has four tenders inside. When a hydra is aggroed or defeated, they say:
*{{Text|say|Wildseed Tender|It's getting really cramped in here, cut us out!}}
*{{Text|say|Wildseed Tender|Someone's there! Get us out of here!}}
*{{Text|say|Wildseed Tender|Gut this thing and get us out!}}
*{{Text|say|Wildseed Tender|Help... can't last... much longer in here...!}}
*{{Text|say|Wildseed Tender|Finally, someone is going to save us!}}
*{{Text|say|Wildseed Tender|Urgh... get us out of here!}}

When the hydra is cut:
*{{Text|say|Wildseed Tender|Finally!}}
*{{Text|say|Wildseed Tender|Thanks!}}
*{{Text|say|Wildseed Tender|We're saved!}}
*{{Text|say|Wildseed Tender|Close call!}}

Once all sixteen have been saved, head up the hill to find Dreamweaver, and eighteen tenders:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|We've all been eaten by plants before. It happens.}}

==Progression==
{{Tranquil Pools}}

;Description
The local plantlife have gone somewhat wild during this anima drought.

They went ahead and ate most of the young fae that were tending to this part of the [[Tranquil Pools]].

At least that solves where they've been all this time.

Oh, don't worry. This isn't the first time this has happened. We can last quite a while inside those monsters.

Take my dagger. Use it to carve through those large monsters to free the other wildseed tenders.
