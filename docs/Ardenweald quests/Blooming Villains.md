==Objectives==
Slay 15 masked night fae in [[Shimmerbough]].
* Ritualists slain (15)

==Description==
Something stinks, traveler. The air to the west is rotten with malice.

Shimmerbough has long been a peaceful way station along the [[Path of Rebirth]]. The [[faerie]]s there delight in revelry and celebration. But now their glade has fallen silent.

[[Scout]]s bring reports of the strange masked night fae. I know little other than that they are a threat.

For the sake of [[Ardenweald]], they must be eliminated. Slay any you encounter.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|37|55|70}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with the [[Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
It is the way of nature. A parasite must be removed.

==Completion==
Grim work, but necessary. May they be reborn into useful vassals of Ardenweald once more.

==Notes==
When in Shimmerbough, pick up two additional quests from [[Primrose]].

Eligible mobs are [[Shimmerbough Ritualist]]s and [[Possessed Defender]]s. After killing them, Primrose will occasionally say:
*{{Text|say|Primrose|I h-had to! I had to!}}
*{{Text|say|Primrose|I'm so sorry....}}
*{{Text|say|Primrose|Please, no more....}}
*{{Text|say|Primrose|This is the only way I can help you now....}}

==Progression==
{{Wicked Plan}}
