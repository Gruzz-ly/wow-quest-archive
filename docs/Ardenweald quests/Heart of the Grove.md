==Objectives==
Bring the Heart of the Grove to [[Tirna Vaal]].
* Heart of the Grove found {{co|69.2|26.8|Ardenweald}}
* Korenth inspected {{co|69.2|26.8|Ardenweald}}
*Find Niya further in Heartwood Grove.

==Description==
We were supposed to take the heart of the grove to [[Tirna Vaal]] when we left this place to wither.

The masked fae struck before that could happen. They must be after the heart of the grove!

The heart contains all of the anima that was meant to save the other groves. We can't afford to lose it.

Can you secure it? I need to find Korenth, one of our healers. His skills will help any survivors we find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|40|20}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'll do my part to get some of the wildseeds. You get the others.

==Completion==
Korenth is... gone? And the heart of the grove has been taken?

Then... then we have much to do.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Niya|I'll look for survivors. Meet me further into the grove.}}

Look for [[Korenth]], nearly dead:
:{{text|say|Korenth|He took... the heart...}}

Inspect him to hear his last words:
:{{text|say|Korenth|Krelnor... masked... Shrouded Mire...}}

Head north to find Niya:
:{{text|say|Niya|Korenth! Where are you?}}

On complete of all three:
:{{text|say|Niya|Korenth... we'll take back the heart of the grove. I swear it.}}

==Progression==

;Description
When [[Heartwood Grove]] was chosen to be depleted, we were ordered to take the Heart of the Grove to Tirna Vaal.

The [[possessed]] attacked while that was happening and started forcing these masks onto all of us.

The heart of a grove contains a massive amount of [[anima]]. We can't lose it to these monsters.

Can you recover it? I need to find one of our [[healer]]s, a [[sylvar]] named Korenth.

He'll be able to help us find anyone else who might still be alive out here.

;Completion
Korenth  is dead? And the heart of the grove is gone?
