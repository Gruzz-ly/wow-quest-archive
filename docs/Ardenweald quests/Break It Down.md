==Objectives==
Use Primrose's Pyrotechnic Powder to destroy 5 Ritual Altars.
* [[Runed Altar]] destroyed (5)
* [[Primrose's Pyrotechnic Powder]] (5)

==Description==
I've seen the ritual. It's... terrifying.

But the altars seem to be the key. If only I had my pyrotechnic powder, I could blast them to bits!

<[[Primrose]] is silent for a moment, then takes a deep breath.>

If you could get the powder and guard me, we could blow up those altars.

I stashed as much as I could in our dwellings. They don't seem to care any more.

You don't have wings, but a pinch of [[faerie]] dust should work for a short time.

Let's do this before I change my mind!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|37|55|70}}
* 9,700 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
I don't know if this was a good idea....

==Completion==
We did it! All the altars are destroyed!

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Primrose|Wait! I-I'm coming with you!}}

First, loot [[Pinch of Faerie Dust]] from [[Shimmerbough Ritualist]]s and [[Possessed Defender]]s or click on [[Basket of Enchanted Wings]]. The dust and the basket give the Faerie's Blessing buff that allow you to fly in Shimmerbough. Get up on the baskets (if you are a rogue, [[Grappling Hook]] can be used) that contain [[Faerie Belongings]] to loot [[Primrose's Pyrotechnic Powder]]. Upon looting the first one:
:{{Text|say|Primrose|You found some powder! I can blow up an altar with that much. At least I hope I can....}}

;Approaching one altar
:{{Text|say|Primrose|There's one of the altars. Sprinkle some powder on it and let's give this a shot....}}

;First altar coated
:{{Text|say|Primrose|That should be enough powder. Oh, what if this doesn't work?}}
:{{Text|say|Primrose|I wasn't sure if we could, but we did it. Let's keep going.}}

;Second altar coated
:{{Text|say|Primrose|Another altar... they moved so quickly. Nobody could react in time....}}
:{{Text|say|Primrose|Take that! Heh, I think I'm getting good at this.}}

;Third altar coated
:{{Text|say|Primrose|Stone isn't found in Ardenweald. These altars are an abomination.}}
:{{Text|say|Primrose|With the mask in place, they drive a stone spike into the chest, completing the ritual. Not any more!}}

;Fourth altar coated
:{{Text|say|Primrose|So many of my friends were taken, turned against their wills. I won't let them take any more.}}
:{{Text|say|Primrose|I will make them pay for what they did to all of you....}}

;Fifth altar coated
:{{Text|say|Primrose|This is the last one. Let's take it out!}}
:{{Text|say|Primrose|We did it! Now they can't do any more rituals.}}

==Progression==
{{Wicked Plan}}
