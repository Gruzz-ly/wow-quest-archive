==Objectives==
Bring the Naughty Story to [[Archivist Dreyden]] in the [[Grove of Memory]].
* [[A Naughty Story (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<You have held this book for less than five minutes and it has already escaped once, bitten you twice and somehow managed to steal some [[gold]].

This is not what you were expecting from a "Naughty Story" but then again, maybe you should have.

You bind the book closed so it will hopefully cause a minimum of mischief. Time to bring it to Archivist Dreyden.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You found one of my books!

Oh. That one.

<Dreyden sighs.>

I suppose I will take it back. Thanks, I guess.

==Criteria of==
