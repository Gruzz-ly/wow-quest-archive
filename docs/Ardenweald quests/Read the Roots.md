==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Depleted Soulweb]]s in [[Tirna Noch]], to find the greatest concentration of [[anima]] in the grove.
* South investigated {{co|70.9|57.1|Ardenweald}}
* Northwest investigated {{co|68.9|53.0|Ardenweald}}
* Northeast investigated {{co|70.5|53.5|Ardenweald}}

==Description==
When my grove withered, I answered the [[Winter Queen|Queen's]] call and joined the [[Wild Hunt]].

Nothing can be done for Tirna Noch. But it wounds me to see it crawling with foes of the forest.

We need a great deal of anima. The masked fae must be keeping a stockpile somewhere within the grove--we just need to find it.

They likely used soulwebs to collect and move the anima. If I examine them, I should be able to pick up the trail.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|3|80}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I sometimes mourn what was lost. And then I remember what work there is still left to do.

==Completion==
The Drust have stolen more anima than I expected. To think that they have deprived us of this much in the midst of a drought...

We must take back whatever we can. Not only for the sake of the wildseed, but to also thwart whatever the Drust intend to do.

==Notes==
Pick up all three quests and [[Ara'lon]] and [[Niya]] join the party. Kill hostiles for [[Stolen Mementos]], loot [[Fae Basket]]s for [[Plundered Anima]], and interact with the three marked locations to scout out more anima reserves.

Interact with the Depleted Soulwebs in any order. First:
:{{Text|say|Ara'lon|The anima is somewhere nearby. We must continue our search.}}
:{{Text|say|Niya|Will this be the fate of my grove as well?}}

Second:
:{{Text|say|Ara'lon|We are getting closer. Where could the Drust be hiding so much anima?}}
:{{Text|say|Niya|They must be gathering it for some dark purpose...}}

Third:
:{{Text|say|Ara'lon|The Drust must be storing the anima in the heart of the grove. But it withered so long ago...}}
:{{Text|say|Niya|Perhaps the decaying groves are what drew them to Ardenweald.}}

==Progression==

;Description
When my grove fell, I answered the [[Winter Queen|Queen]]'s call, and joined the [[Wild Hunt]].

Nothing can be done to bring the tree, or the spirits within, back.

But we need a great deal of [[anima]], and if we are careful, we may be able to steal a massive quantity of it, right from under their noses.

Within the grove there are soulwebs, that can help us trace the greatest concentration of anima. If we follow the trail, we will find their stockpile.

Are you with me?

;Completion
There is a huge store of anima here in the grove. Far more than I expected.

Now that we know where it is, we can go take it. 

I rather look forward to dealing them a huge blow, and helping that special wildseed in the process.
