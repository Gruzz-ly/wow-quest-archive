==Objectives==
Collect 6 Blackthorn Clay in [[Blackthorn Grove]].
* [[Blackthorn Clay]] (6)

==Description==
Ah, just the mushroomancer I wanted to see! Mind getting me some clay?

There's all kinds of different soil, you know. It's not all just dirt! And clay... clay is something special. You ever try growing through clay? Oh, I guess not.

It's hard work to break down, but once you do the flavor is incomparable! My roots are looking forward to the challenge.

Blackthorn Grove has a particularly bitter and complex clay that is just what I'm craving. I'm sure they won't mind if you ask them for some.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Marasmius]]

==Progress==
If they give you any trouble, just tell 'em Marasmius sent you. I bet someone there is old enough to remember me.

==Completion==
Ooh, that's the stuff all right. It's bitter, sure, but wonderfully complex and subtle undertones. Mm! You'll have to try some sometime.

==Notes==
Loot Blackthorn Clays from [[Cracked Vertosol]] below the roots of a tree in Blackthorn Grove.
