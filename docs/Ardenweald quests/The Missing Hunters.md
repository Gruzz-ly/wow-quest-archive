==Objectives==
Find Jynkla, Serinkai, Rondar, and Ara'lon.
* [[Jynkla]] found {{co|55.4|31.4|Ardenweald}}
* [[Serinkai]] found {{co|55.9|33.8|Ardenweald}}
* [[Rondar]] found {{co|53.7|32.6|Ardenweald}}
* [[Ara'lon]] found {{co|54.8|36.5|Ardenweald}}

==Description==
Strange creatures have been seen lurking just outside the grove. Terrible, ugly things.

Whatever they might be, they are not native to [[Ardenweald]]. 

It does not matter how they breached our borders, though. Every one of them must be eliminated.

I sent my best huntsmen and huntresses to slay them, but not one has returned. See if you can determine what has delayed them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|80|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found my hunters?

==Completion==
Only Ara'lon and Lumera survived? The rest have fallen?

<Korayn trembles with unbridled fury.> 

I will see to it that their bodies are retrieved. And this cannot go unpunished. We will avenge them all!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Hunt-Captain Korayn|My huntsmen and huntresses are seldom late to report. Find them.}}

Pick up both quests before heading out. Kill a path across the pools. [[Drained Sylvar]] can be seen.

The [[Lady of the Falls]] offers an optional side quest, [[Trouble in the Banks]].

Rondar is in the base of a tree, dead:
:<The sylvar's face is blank and staring. He fell victim to an ambush.>

Serinkai is under a tree to the east, dead:
:<The vorkai's face is marred by dark magic. He was lured into a trap.>

Jynkla is at the edge of the pool, dead:
:<The vorkai's face is twisted into a mask of rage. She died overwhelmed by sheer numbers.>

Once those three have been found, a fourth hunter pops up. Ara'lon is to the south, hiding behind a tree:
:{{text|say|Ara'lon|Over here! Before you are seen!}}

Speak with Ara'lon:
:Beware. This place is crawling with terrible creatures, large and small.
*{{gossip|Hunt-Captain Korayn says to report back to the grove.}}
*{{gossip|Who are you?}}

;Who are you?
:I am Ara'lon. I fight for the Wild Hunt.
:Once, I served in a beautiful grove called Tirna Noch, nurturing spirits through their long winter. But that grove fell, and I found new purpose.
:I serve Ardenweald.
:{{gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}

;Lumera gossip text
:We are the lucky ones. We will hunt another day.

;Report to the grove
:{{text|say|Ara'lon|The falls are overrun. I think... we are being hunted.}}
:{{text|say|Ara'lon|We will return to the grove as soon as we are able. Thank you, friend.}}

==Progression==

;Description
Strange creatures have intruded just outside the grove. Terrible, ugly things.

I refuse to believe that they are native to [[Ardenweald]].

I sent my best [[hunter]]s to slay them, but not one has returned. See if you can discover what has delayed their successful return.

;Completion
Only Ara'lon and Lumera still live? The rest have fallen?

<Korayn trembles with incandescent fury.>
