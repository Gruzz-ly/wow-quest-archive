==Objectives==
Speak to Moonberry and await the [[Winter Queen]]'s arrival.
* Speak to [[Lady Moonberry]] {{co|63.5|36.1|Ardenweald}}

==Description==
Zephyrs herald the Queen's arrival. Hushed silence descends upon the grove.

Wait, watch, and speak when the time has come.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|49|60|80}}
* 8,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Queen shoulders so much because of this drought. But she is powerful, and I know we will make it through.

==Completion==
Gone so soon... the forest must be in even more dire straits than I realized.

<Moonberry looks crestfallen for a moment before resolutely setting her hands on her hips.>

Well, then we'll just have to help ease the Queen's burden. Then she'll have the time to grant you an audience!

==Notes==
Speak with Moonberry:
:Tirna Vaal is one of the more fortunate groves. It has a chance to survive. And the Queen will do everything in her power to make it so.
:{{gossip|I'm ready to meet the Winter Queen.}}

A cutscene plays:
:''The Winter Queen arrives in a cloud of smoke. She casts a spell at the tree and the fae exult in her action. The player walks toward her, but without even noticing, the queen disappears in a poof.''

This completes the "Waning Grove" chapter of the [[Ardenweald storyline]]. The campaign continues with [[Call of the Hunt]]. Additionally, optional side quests open up with  [[In Need of Gorm Gris]] from [[Guardian Kota]] and [[Forest Disappearances]] from [[Brigdin]].

;Objectives
* Speak with Moonberry again {{co|63.6|36.3|Ardenweald}}

;Description
The Queen approaches. The land sings beneath her feet. [[Tirna Vaal]] will bloom once more.

Wait, and listen, and then speak when the time arrives.

;Progress
The Queen is so busy these days. But she is powerful, and I know we will make it through.

;Completion
Don't worry, we can still think of something.

Clearly, there are simply too many crises all across Ardenweald for the Queen, and I'm afraid, her Court, to manage all at once.

We must start putting out some of those fires, or her attention will always be divided!

;Speaking with Moonberry again
:Oh, no! She moved on too quickly. I know you wanted to speak with her, and I thought for certain she could stay long enough to grant you an audience!
:<Moonberry looks down, crestfallen.>
:Things must be worse than I thought. She has to be in so many places all at once.
:<Moonberry sets her hands on her hips, resolute.>
:Well, we'll just have to keep trying to get you to her.
