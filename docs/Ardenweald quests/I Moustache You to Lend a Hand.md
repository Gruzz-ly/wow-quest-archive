==Description==
A message from the Primus of [[Maldraxxus]] you say? We haven't heard from him in... Well, it's been a long time.

This isn't a prank, is it? The Queen doesn't have time for pranks. But I do!

<Moonberry leans in close and whispers to you.>

And for this one, I think we need one more lily.

<Moonberry winks.>

Let me take a look at this message. You bring that last night lily to Featherlight, and then we'll talk.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|28|50}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I hope that your arrival in Ardenweald is a sign that better times are on the horizon.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|The message is magically sealed? Well, that's no fun...}}

Gather a lily from any of the surrounding plants, then return:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Featherlight, you place the lily. This stupid seal just won't open!}}

Speak with Featherlight:
:Were you able to gather the lily we need?
:{{gossip|I have the lily.}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Moonberry|Zayhad! Wake up!}}
:{{text|say|Zayhad, The Builder|My slumber... recedes...}}
:{{text|say|Zayhad, The Builder|A beard, a hat... gifts of time and... mirth of fae.}}
:{{text|say|Zayhad, The Builder|The forest sighs in laughter. You bring joy, Lady Moonberry.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|I try, old friend. And I know you'll help the forest grow again soon!}}

Speak with Moonberry again:
:A mortal? How interesting...
:{{gossip|Will you help me gain an audience with the Queen?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|This way, come along.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Sadly, the Queen cannot grant you an audience. Her spirit is spread thin across Ardenweald.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|This drought threatens the entire forest. Your voice is but one bird singing in the night.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|The Queen's magic protects every branch, every leaf. If not for her vigilance, all might be lost.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|For now, we night fae must act in her stead.}}
:{{text|say|Tanor|Help! Help me!}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Moonberry|I warned you not to come back!}}
:''Moonberry blasts a group of [[spriggan]]s up into the air and lets them drop, killing them.''
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Ugh. Spriggans.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Sorry! I had to make a quick stop on the way.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Surnol|Is that... a new soul? Are Souls finally returning to Ardenweald!}}
:{{text|say|Lourn|By the Queen, I hope so.}}
