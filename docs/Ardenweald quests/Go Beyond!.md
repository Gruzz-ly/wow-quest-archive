==Description==
<Ah, you're just in time. I've made quite the discovery.

I've managed to make a connection, even further out than I ever have before.

How did I do it, you ask? HARD WORK, THAT'S HOW! But you knew that. You're almost as hardworking as I am. That's what you're here for!

Up for an even more exciting adventure?>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +650 reputation with [[Marasmius]]

==Progress==
I feel a breeze on the other side. I guess that means it's not underground. 

==Completion==
;Arkelios' Solace
:Must be nice to have the leisure to just sit and think all the time. 
:I've barely got time myself, with all the work I have keeping this place together!
:Still, that was nice of you to help out the old turtle.
;Distant Grotto
:Nothing wrong with picking flowers for a living. It's good, honest work.
:And giving those blasted spriggans a kick in the rear is worthwhile too. Nice job. 
;Distant Grotto 2
:Always nice to lend a hand to someone who's just tryin' to do their job. A metaphorical hand, obviously... although in your case, it's literal.
:I know what metaphorical means!
:Anyway, good work out there.
;Faraway Pools
:I remember those guys. Bad news.
:They should stick to their own realm of existence!
:Nice job cleaning house.
;Forgotten Retreat
:Those are special moths! They really liven up the place, don't they?
:You know moths work just as hard as anyone else, and they're under-appreciated.
:Thanks for savin' em.
;Forgotten Retreat 2
:That was real nice of you. Not too many people take care of us old folks around here.
:She even gave you silk! How nice. Here, why don't you take it? I certainly don't need it.

==Notes==
===Arkelios' Solace===
[[File:Go Beyond - Arkelios.jpg|thumb|Arkelios and his foci]]
*{{text|say|Marasmius|If someone wanted 'peace and quiet,' this would be the place for it! Maybe that soul there could use a little help.}}
*{{text|say|Marasmius|Now this is what I'd call 'out of the way.' And it looks like one poor soul is stuck out here! See if he needs any help.}}

Far to the south at {{co|54.2|93.5|Ardenweald}} is [[Arkelios' Solace]], where [[Arkelios]] has been resting under a tree for a very long time. Speak with him:
:Greetings, fellow traveler.
:{{gossip|How can I help?}}
*{{text|say|Arkelios|At the edge of existence, it is easy to be overwhelmed by loss. Hm. Perhaps I should meditate on the meaning of loss. Could you find my foci? They should be around here...}}
*{{text|say|Arkelios|You are kind, to visit me out here in the crumbling edge of reality. Hm. Perhaps we could meditate on the nature of kindness. Could you find my foci? They should be around here...}}

Gather the three requested items on the other islands:
;Fear
:{{text|say|Arkelios|We are afraid of no longer having something we once possessed, or not experiencing what we thought we would.}}
;Sadness
:{{text|say|Arkelios|It is painful to see what was, no longer be. We remember the joy that we had in it, the wonder, and the attachment.}}
;Acceptance
:{{text|say|Arkelios|If we release ourselves of the expectations we had, let go of the fear and pain of loss, this is to accept things for what they are.}}
;Compassion
:{{text|say|Arkelios|To step outside of ourselves, and to truly understand the sufferings of others, this is what it means to have compassion.}}
;Forgiveness
:{{text|say|Arkelios|When we release expectations and resentment toward those who wrong us, this is a step toward forgiveness.}}
;Patience
:{{text|say|Arkelios|Every thing happens in its own time, whether or not we wish it at that moment. To know this, is to be patient.}}

Place them before Arkelios:
*{{text|say|Arkelios|We mourn what we have lost, whether it be something we held, or a future that will never be. Relinquish the expectations that possession granted, and know peace.}}
*{{text|say|Arkelios|Thank you. I will reflect on these elements of kindness, as you have shown to me in your visit here today. Farewell, for now.}}
:{{text|emote|Arkelios withdraws to meditate.}}

===Distant Grotto===
[[File:Distant Grotto.jpg|thumb|Distant Grotto]]
:{{text|say|Marasmius|Ughh. Spriggans. Lousy, noisy, scampering little gits. But those flowers ain't gonna pick themselves. Get 'em and leave these rascals to rot.}}

Far to the north at {{co|50.9|7.5|Ardenweald}} is the [[Distant Grotto]], overrun by [[Stranded Spriggan]]s and their [[Summoned Boggart]]s. Clear out the area while looting [[Night Lily]]. Looting lilies will frequently summon another spriggan.

===Distant Grotto 2===
:{{text|say|Marasmius|These little monsters again! Hey, there's one of the fae crafters. See if she needs any help dealing with those nasty spriggans.}}

Speak with [[Lyri]], the artisan of the mists:
:When this part of Ardenweald sundered away, I thought I would finally have some solitude and space for my work.
*{{gossip|What's wrong?}}
:<Gestures vaguely at everything.>
*{{gossip|How can I help?}}
:{{text|say|Lyri|Spriggans stole my tools and my materials, and I would very much like them back! I thought I would finally be able to get some work done out here by myself... but no.}}

Defeat [[Stranded Spriggan]]s and [[Stranded Witch Doctor]]s for their [[Pilfered Materials]], then defeat a [[Shifting Dread]] for the [[Artisan's Implement]].

Speak with her again:
:{{gossip|Here are your things.}}
:{{text|say|Lyri|Thank you. Now, I can get to work! ... Hopefully without too much more spriggan interference.}}

===Faraway Pools===
[[File:Faraway Pools.jpg|thumb|Faraway Pools]]
:{{text|say|Marasmius|That's not right! These guys aren't supposed to be here! They need to be taught a lesson.}}
Southeast of [[Tirna Scithe]] at {{co|26.7|73.7|Ardenweald}} are the [[Faraway Pools]], which have been overrun by the [[Drust]].

Marasmius provides a bonus ability to help with the cleansing:
:{{abilities|Bomblete|range=20|cd=6 sec|Toss a deadly mushroom at your enemies!|notes=1 sec cast. Ground-targeted AoE, hits for 150% of Crawler health and roughly 2/3 of a Reaver's health}}

Fill the bar by killing: [[Darkfront Crawler]]s (2%), [[Darkfront Reaver]]s and [[Darkfront Summoner]]s (6%), and closing [[Portal from Thros|Portals from Thros]] (8%)

===Forgotten Retreat 1===
[[File:Forgotten Retreat.jpg|thumb|Forgotten Retreat]]
:{{text|say|Marasmius|Selenia Moths! They must have just had a hatching. See if you can catch some and bring 'em back.}}

Northwest of [[Tirna Scithe]] at {{co|19.4|36.7|Ardenweald}} is the [[Forgotten Retreat]]. Use the provided [[Moth Net]] to attempt to capture the moths.

===Forgotten Retreat 2===
:{{text|say|Marasmius|What a view! Oh, and a marvelous silk strider! The poor thing must be lonely, all the way out here. See if you can cheer it up!}}

Off the western shore, [[The Lonely Matriarch]] is idle on the western edge of the island. Just to the south is a [[Discarded Harp]]. Pick it up and play it near the matriarch, which emotes one of the following:
*{{text|emote|The silkstrider dances gracefully, and weaves a fresh batch of silk.}}
*{{text|emote|The silkstrider hums contentedly as it spins fresh silk.}}
*{{text|emote|The silkstrider stops trembling, and spins a fresh batch of silk.}}

A [[Very Large Silk Bundle]] appears before her. Interact with it to loot the [[Giant Silk Bundle]].
