==Objectives==
Confront the leader of the possessed fae in [[Shimmerbough]].
* [[Ingra Drif]] confronted
* [[Mindwarped Faerie]] slain

==Description==
It's time to end this.

When I first hid I saw a dark shape on the northeast platform. I think that's their leader.

Now that they can't perform any more rituals, we should be able to scare them off.

<Primrose pauses for a moment.>

I... I just wanted to say thank you. I never could have done this without your help. Now, let's drive out this enemy and retake the village!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Shimmerbough Loop]]
* {{cost|37|55|70}}
* 9,700 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
My hands are shaking... but we can do it!

==Completion==
I see. This is terrible news.

==Notes==
;Confronting Ingra Drif

:''Primrose approaches Ingra Drif.''
:{{Text|say|Primrose|It's over! You have nothing left, and your corruption ends here!}}
:{{Text|say|Ingra Drif|Foolish little fly. What made you think I was incapable of transforming both of you by myself?}}
:''Ingra Drif casts the Fighting the Mask debuff on the player. The Resist Control extra button becomes available.''

You can use the button, but it doesn't affect the outcome.

:{{Text|say|Primrose|No! Fight it! Fight it, <name>!}}
:{{Text|say|Ingra Drif|Fight all you want. No one can resist the might of Thros.}}
:{{Text|yell|Primrose|AAAAAAAAAAGH!}}
:{{Text|say|Ingra Drif|Still you manage to struggle? Worrisome, but futile. No one can stop the Drust. Kill them, little fly.}}
:''Ingra Drif curses Primrose and leaves.''
:{{Text|say|Primrose|End... it....}}

Primrose defeated
:{{Text|say|Primrose|I'm... sorry....}}

;On completion
:{{Text|say|Guardian Molan|Shimmerbough is lost, then? Then we are in more danger than I previously expected. I will send word to the [[Court of Night]].}}
