==Objectives==
Retrieve a Wreath of Night's Veil Flowers from backstage at the Star Lake Amphitheater.
* Get backstage at [[Star Lake Amphitheater]] {{co|41.4|45.0|Ardenweald}}
* Use the [[Trick Powder]] and then stand on the first mark {{co|41.4|43.9|Ardenweald}}
* Stand on the second mark {{co|40.9|44.4|Ardenweald}}
* [[Wreath of Night's Veil Flowers]] {{co|40.3|43.5|Ardenweald}}
* "Enrich" [[Lady Moonberry's Soap]] {{co|41.3|42.7|Ardenweald}}

==Description==
The next thing we need to prepare the vessel is a set of Night's Veil Flowers.

We use these flowers in our ceremonies, but since the drought we've just used them as props in our plays. There are certainly some backstage at the Star Lake Amphitheater.

I bet [[Lady Moonberry|Moonberry]] is there for the rehearsal of their next play. As a bonus, this will work out quite nicely for me to get revenge on her.

<Willowblossom flashes a wicked grin.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the flowers?

==Completion==
Mission accomplished! This will be so funny. Ah, sweet revenge.

==Notes==
North-northeast to the [[Star Lake Amphitheater]], then try to get onstage before [[Stage Security]] says "Not for you!":
:{{text|say|Stage Security|We are in the middle of rehearsal!}}
:{{text|say|Willowblossom|Ooh, I know! Let's disguise ourselves with some leftover trick powder!}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Moonberry|Hey! You with the tree! Get to your mark!}}

A bonus ability appears:
:{{Abilities|Trick Powder|Use Sicklethorn Trick Powder to blend in...|id=323723|icon=inv_enchant_dust|range=100|notes=Instant}}

Use it to spawn in "disguise" tree. Stay out of the detection radius of the [[Stage Hand]]s. If caught the NPC will say:
:{{Text|say|This isn't your scene! Wait for your cue!}}

Stand in the light.
:{{text|yell|Lady Moonberry|Hmm, that's not right. Move the tree to the other side!}}

Head to the other mark:
:{{text|yell|Lady Moonberry|Perfect! Okay, everyone take a break.}}
:{{text|say|Willowblossom|Now's our chance! Head backstage!}}

Up the ramp to the northwest, where a stagehand is patrolling in a clockwise pattern. Sneak past and up the second ramp to reach the Wreath of Night's Veil Flowers sitting on a table. Pick it up:
:{{text|say|Willowblossom|Let's play a little prank on Moonberry. It's only fair she gets pranked sometimes, too!}}
:{{text|say|Willowblossom|Her dressing room is across from here.}}

Cut across to the other side and interact with Lady Moonbery's Soap:
:You find Lady Moonberry's soap resting on the table.
*{{gossip|Add purple petals to the bottle.}}
*{{gossip|Add green petals to the bottle.}}
*{{gossip|Add red petals to the bottle.}}

It doesn't matter for this quest, so pick a color:
:{{text|yell|Lady Moonberry|It's time for the [[burning of Teldrassil]] scene! Where is the tree?!}}
:{{text|say|Willowblossom|Uhh... We better go.}}

==Progression==
{{A Vessel of Ardenweald}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.0.2|note=Added.}}
