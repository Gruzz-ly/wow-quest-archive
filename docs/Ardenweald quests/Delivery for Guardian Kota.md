==Objectives==
Deliver the [[gorm]] gris to [[Guardian Kota]] in [[Tirna Vaal]].
* [[Fresh Gorm Gris]] (provided)

==Description==
This is most disturbing, indeed. The gorm are just too... wild, now!

I wonder if the drought is making everything delicious to them, and that is why.

This isn't enough gorm gris, either. And I do not want to disappoint Kota..

But, I also don't want to put you through more trouble collecting it. I will go myself into the burrows nearby, to see if I can find any more for her.

Would you take this gorm gris to her for me, please?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|
|Gormgris Gorget
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|48|5}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Master Sha'lor]] has gone to the burrows himself, to try and find more gorm gris?

... for me?

That reckless, thick-horned [[sylvar]]! He will get himself killed!
