==Objectives==
Slay Noisul of Many Faces
* [[Noisul of Many Faces]] slain

==Description==
We have to find [[Ol' Gertie]]! She is the broodmother of the [[silkstrider]]s, and is our most reliable producer. We cannot lose her.

But I cannot get to her and see if she is all right. She is usually at the top of the cliffs, at the highest point. Can you get up there, and make sure that she is safe?

If she is not... then may justice fall swift and hard on the perpetrator.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found Ol' Gertie? Is she safe?

==Completion==
<Ol' Gertie lies dead of fear. 

But this little silkstrider larvae{{Sic}} wiggles happily at you.>

==Notes==
Ol' Gertie is lying dead at the topmost northern part of the cliffs. Noisul is roaming nearby. After killing Noisul, find [[Gertie Jr.]] hiding some distance away.

==Progression==
