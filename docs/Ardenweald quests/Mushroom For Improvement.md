==Objectives==
Use the Pouch of Spores to plant mushrooms on 15 masked [[night fae]] in the [[Stalks]].
* Mushrooms planted (15)
* [[Pouch of Spores]] (provided)

==Description==
The mushrooms are under attack! I need your help, or we risk losing it all!

Some fae wearing strange masks came in and demanded to gain access to the rings. When I told them they were closed due to the drought, they attacked me!

I'm too weak to fight back now, and I'm cut off from the center ring. These fae have destroyed so much, but there is something we can do.

Sprinke some of these spores on their corpses so we can regrow the rings. Even when slain, our enemies can still serve [[Ardenweald]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Marasmius]]

==Progress==
They'd be feeding the mushrooms anyway, so you might as well accelerate the process.

==Completion==
Their bodies will nourish the growth and restoration of the fae rings. It is a worthy end for them.

==Notes==
;Beta description
The mushrooms are under attack! I need your help, or we risk losing it all!

These night fae wearing strange masks came in and demanded to gain access to the network. When I told them it was closed due to the drought, they attacked!

We're too weak to fight back now and cut off from the network's center. They've destroyed so much, but there is something we can do.

Take these spores. Sprinkle some on their corpses and we can rebuild the network. Even in death, our enemies can still serve Ardenweald.
