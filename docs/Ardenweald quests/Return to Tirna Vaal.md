==Objectives==
Return to Tirna Vaal.
* Return to [[Tirna Vaal]]
*Find [[Dreamweaver]] in Tirna Vaal.
*[[Spirit Cradle (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Wild Hunt]] are always prepared to return to the cycle, in defense of [[Ardenweald]].

I must move on, and so should you. I advise you to return to [[Droman Tashmur]] in Tirna Vaal. Others will need your help.

Here, take this. It is a gift, and a thank you.

May we all survive this drought. By helping each other.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|40|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh, you have a spirit cradle! That will be quite useful, indeed.

Assuming we can calm this chaos, of course. The wildseed you bonded with is having intense nightmares... and they're manifesting all over the grove!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Ara'lon|I once used this to carry wildseeds in my former grove. May it serve you well.}}

No need to run there... the flight master is yards away.

Before leaving, don't forget to finish the optional side questline started with [[Trouble in the Banks]] from [[Lady of the Falls]] if you haven't already.

Back at [[Tirna Vaal]], [[Unleashed Nightmare (Ardenweald)|Unleashed Nightmares]] have started attacking. Find [[Dreamweaver]] in the tree:
:{{text|say|Droman Tashmur|A spirit's turmoil, nightmare given form. Dreamweaver calls for aid.}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|<Name>! Thank the queen you're here!}}

==Progression==
{{Glittering Falls}}

==Beta version==
{{Rfb-section}}
;Completion
Thank the Queen you've returned. The Dreamer... the spirit within is in trouble. I can't soothe its nightmares!
