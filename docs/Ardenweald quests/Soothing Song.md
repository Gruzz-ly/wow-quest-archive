==Objectives==
Travel with [[Niya]] to take the wildseed to Hibernal Hollow.
* Speak with [[Dreamweaver]] {{co|64.6|39.1|Ardenweald}}
* [[Wildseed]] escorted to [[Hibernal Hollow]] (0/100%)
*Speak with [[Ara'lon]].

==Description==
I will fly ahead to Hibernal Hollow and convince the [[Droman Aliothe]] to help us. Hopefully she will have agreed by the time you and Niya arrive.

This wildseed seems to take comfort in your presence, so you'll need to stick close to it.

Niya will also need to sing to the wildseed to keep it calm... or else the nightmares may return.

Spriggans love to interrupt our songs, so be on the lookout for them.

Let me know when you're ready to head off.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|3|80}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How strange that such a small wildseed could cause so much trouble...

==Completion==
It's good to see you again. The Wild Hunt could use your help.

==Notes==
Speak with Dreamweaver again:
:A lot of strange things have happened recently. I don't quite recall ever seeing Ardenweald in so much chaos.
:{{gossip|I'm ready to take this wildseed to Hibernal Hollow.}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Niya, take my harp. Its music can help to soothe the wildseed.}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|I'll meet you in Hibernal Hollow. Safe journey, you three.}}
:{{text|say|Niya|Thank you for bringing me along, <name>. I'm sorry you couldn't speak to the queen.}}
:{{text|say|Niya|I'll do whatever I can to help you meet with her, just like you helped me.}}
:{{text|say|Niya|The nightmare's returned... I need to play the harp--}}
:{{text|say|Niya|Spriggans! Look out!}}

Stay on foot and follow along. As expected, three [[Blackthorn Ambusher]]s drop out of shadow. Defeat them and Niya keeps moving.
:{{text|say|Niya|The song must be attracting them...}}

Another ambush, this time of four spriggan. Defeat them and Niya takes off again, but don't make it too far as Ara'lon stops the party:
:{{text|yell|Ara'lon|Hold! The road is not safe!}}
:{{text|say|Ara'lon|Wait... you're the one who helped us at Glitterfall Heights. Perhaps you can do so again.}}
