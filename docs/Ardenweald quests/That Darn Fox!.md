==Objectives==
Find and Catch Renny the Vulpin kit.
* Get Fox Finding Boon from [[Clarion Song]]
* Catch [[Renny (NPC)|Renny]]!
* Recapture Renny!
* [[Isengrimm]] slain
* Seriously, catch that fox

==Description==
You! You there!

I, Clarion Song, need your assistance. Yes, yes, give yourself a moment to bask in my glory.

<Clarion Song gives you a moment.>

Done? Good. I need you to catch a troublesome vulpin kit. He is positively barbaric! Running amok, causing havoc, ruining my beauty rest! He's using a concealing charm to make himself invisible, but I know it's him!

Make yourself useful and catch that kit!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well? Did you catch it?

==Completion==
You, you actually caught that little mongrel?

Well! I am pleasantly surprised. Now hand him over. We are going to go right to his parent. I have a few choice words for the esteemed [[Lord Renard]]. Member of the [[Court of Winter|court]] he may be, I am too impossibly valuable to be constantly pestered by this ragamuffin child!

==Notes==
;Speaking with Clarion Song
:Argh! That fox!

:How can I possibly maintain my dapper good looks, charming demeanor, and virtuoso singing when my beauty rest is constantly disrupted!

:{{Gossip|Grant me a boon to catch Renny the fox.}}
:''The player receives the Fox Hunting buff.''

Click on the fox several times until the objective is finished. Renny is running fast as well as blinking. Catching it stuns you and provides the Catch that Fox! buff. Sometimes it bugs, so canceling the buff and relogging helps. After a successful catch, the player is teleported into [[Bastion]]. Each teleport stuns the player for a few seconds with Vulpin Shenanigans. Catch it again. Then the player is teleported into the [[Burning Thicket]] in [[Maldraxxus]]. Enter the building and kill Isengrimm who is holding the fox.

;Isengrimm aggro
*{{Text|say|Isengrimm|You might have some value, too!}}
*{{Text|say|Isengrimm|I'm gonna clobber you and then I'm gonna clobber that pest!}}

;Death
*{{Text|say|Isengrimm|That's not fair...}}
*{{Text|say|Isengrimm|But... My loot...}}

Clicking Renny for the final time teleports the player back to [[Glitterfall Basin]].
