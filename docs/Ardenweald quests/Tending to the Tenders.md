==Objectives==
Slay Egg-Tenders Tiom, Bloome and Erys.
* [[Egg-Tender Tiom]] slain
* [[Egg-Tender Bloome]] slain
* [[Egg-Tender Erys]] slain

==Description==
The eggs are a problem, but so are the gorm that take care of them.

The egg-tenders are the leaders of the hive when no matriarch is present. If left unchecked, they will simply produce more eggs and we will be right back where we started. Or worse, one of them could turn into a queen.

They are simply too large and hostile for us to properly contain. I see no other recourse than to put them down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|37|20|60}}
* 12,950 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
When something threatens the balance, we must act swiftly to correct it.

==Completion==
The population will produce more tenders eventually. You have bought us valuable time.

==Progression==
{{Trouble at the Gormling Corral}}
