==Objectives==
Speak with [[Dreamweaver]] to prepare the ritual.

==Description==
With all of the [[anima]] you recovered from [[Tirna Noch]], it is only a matter of time before my grove becomes the target of every anima-seeking enemy of [[Ardenweald]].

I hope Dreamweaver knows what he is doing with this ritual.

Proceed quickly. Speak with Dreamweaver, and see what needs to be done to aid the spirit within the wildseed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|52|70}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You're ready to begin preparing for the ritual? Wonderful.

I am also ready!
