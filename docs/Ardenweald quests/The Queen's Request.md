==Objectives==
Return to [[Tal-Inara]] in [[Oribos]].

==Description==
Dire portents indeed. 

I have used what little [[anima]] we possess to save our groves and the spirits they nurture. So many were lost... all as the [[Heart of the Forest]] grew ever weaker.

Keeping the [[The Jailer|Banished One]] bound within the [[Maw]] will require more anima than [[Ardenweald]] can spare.

<[[Winter Queen|The Queen]] considers for a moment.>

[[Denathrius|Sire Denathrius]] is a master of anima extraction. Journey to [[Revendreth]] and inform him of our plight. I know he will lend us his aid.

Your allies in Oribos can open the way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Awaken, Ardenweald]]
*{{cost|50|54|40}}
* 8,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What has transpired in Ardenweald? Tell me everything.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|Your path leads onward, mortal. Know that you have gained an ally in me, and in Ardenweald.}}

No quest-provided return here, so get back to [[Oribos]] by any means. [[Tal-Inara]] is on the [[Ring of Transference]] (the upper level, transport gates and flight path) of Oribos.

This concludes the [[Ardenweald storyline]], awarding the achievement [[Awaken, Ardenweald]]. The [[Revendreth storyline]] begins with [[A Plea to Revendreth]].

==Progression==
{{Awaken the Dreamer}}

==Alpha version==
{{Rfa-section}}
During the alpha the quest was named '''The Master'''.
;Description
The news you have brought is troubling. I have used my own power to confront this drought, to save what [[Ghost|spirits]] I could, to spare what worlds I could. More must be diverted to keep the Banished One held. And yet, still more [[anima]] is needed. More than [[Ardenweald]] has to spare.

<The Queen considers for a moment.>

Sire [[Denathrius]] is a master of anima extraction. I now send you to him with a request; grant me what anima he can. Perhaps together we can all survive.
