==Objectives==
Win the Battle for [[Hibernal Hollow]].
* Attackers slain (20)
* Speak to [[Droman Aliothe]] {{co|59.9|53.2|Ardenweald}}
* [[Lorkron the Hunter|Lorkron]] and [[Fulyar the Destroyer]] defeated

==Description==
This is where we make our stand. The [[Drust]] and their minions have us nearly overrun.

But we will not let them destroy Hibernal Hollow. Nor will they take our anima or our wildseeds.

Fight with us. Let us drive them out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|75|81|60}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We have won the battle...

...But I fear we may have lost Ysera.

==Notes==
Attackers include [[Blighted Invader]]s, [[Witherscorn Annihilator]]s, and [[Witherscorn Rotmage]]s.

Run over the runes by each entrance - they each provide a different 10-minute buff:
*{{abilities|Hunter's Efficiency|Empowered by Korayn, increasing damage done by 30%.}}
:{{text|say|Hunt-Captain Korayn|Aim true and strike down our prey!}}
*{{abilities|Energized Spirit|Rejuvenated by Dreamweaver, periodically healing by 10%.}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|I'll heal your wounds! Keep fighting!}}
*{{abilities|Swift of Hoof|Quickened by Niya, increassing haste by 25% and movement speed by 50%.}}
:{{text|say|Niya|Move swift as the wind!}}

Once the quota of enemies has been killed, Aliothe calls out:
:{{text|say|Droman Aliothe|A great danger looms. Come to me, and together we will face it.}}

Speak with Aliothe:
:We shall not let his grove fall!
:The Queen entrusted me with the safety of Hibernal Hollow and all the spirits within. We cannot fail.
:{{gossip|I am ready to stand with you!}}

A cutscene plays: Drust invade the hollow!
:{{text|say|[[Gorak Zhar]]|Their anima will feed our victory.}}
:{{text|say|Gorak Zhar|Leave their husks to rot!}}

Help defeat [[Fulyar the Destroyer]] and [[Lorkron the Hunter]]. Once they fall, another cutscene plays:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Aliothe, look!}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Oh no...}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|The wildseed... I no longer sense its dreams.}}
:{{text|say|[[Lady Moonberry]]|Unless we save her soon, she will be lost forever!}}

On complete, a few Spirit Tenders move Yesera's wildseed to a carrier:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Be gentle! She's almost gone...}}

==Progression==
{{Awaken the Dreamer}}
