==Description==
If you're standing in for Lady Moonberry, then maybe you can help!

Wagonmaster Derawyn was escorting a bunch of us to a new grove when we were attacked by a pack of hungry predators! The wolf be a fast soulshape, so I got away... but some of the little ones weren't so lucky. They're being hunted like prey!

Come on! They're just down the road!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Dreamthorn Sabatons
|Grove Warden's Warboots
|Spirit Tender's Slippers
|Starshroud Boots
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|24|57|}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well, that was exciting.

==Completion==
It's been a while since a new soul arrived in Ardenweald, so each one already here is precious to us.

I'll be sure to let Lady Moonberry know of your heroic rescue efforts on her behalf. She might even decide she owes you a favor!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Te'zan|This way! We were attacked by starving wildlife. There are souls in danger!}}

Run southwest along the road. On the way:
:{{text|say|Niya|I swore an oath to care for those wildseeds! We can't just abandon them!}}

Further southwest:
:{{text|say|Wagonmaster Derawyn|Te'zan! You found help!}}

Speak with [[Te'zan]]:
:You're standing in for Lady Moonberry? Well, I hope you're good at handling starving wildlife!
:{{gossip|Who are you?}}
:Who am I? I'm a soul!
:When my time came, I was called to Ardenweald. I worked with spirits all my life, so it felt only... well, natural.
:How do you like my soul shape form? I always wanted to run around as a wolf ALL the time!

Speak with Derawyn:
:I was trying to take these souls to a place to give of their anima, but it all went wrong!
:The wildlife of Ardenweald was never so dangerous before this drought. I need to get them safely to the Spirit Glen.
:Please help!
:{{gossip|I will help you.}}
:{{text|say|Wagonmaster Derawyn|Please save those poor souls!}}

Choofa the squirrel is sitting on a ruined wagon. Interact with him:
:{{text|say|Choofa|Safe, safe! Here on your head.}}

In the area are [[Starving Shadowstalker]]s holding [[Nature Soul]]s in their mouths. Kill the shadowstalkers, then return to Derawyn:
:Thank you so much! You've been a big help to me and the souls in my care.
:Remember to stick to the road. The forest is filled with dangerous creatures!
:Thank you, again!
:{{gossip|You're welcome.}}
:{{text|say|Wagonmaster Derawyn|Night embrace you. We're in your debt!}}

{{Welcome to Ardenweald}}
