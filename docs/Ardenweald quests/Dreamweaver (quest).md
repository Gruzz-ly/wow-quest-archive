==Objectives==
Speak with [[Dreamweaver]] in the [[Tranquil Pools]].

==Description==
Troubled winds sweep across [[Tirna Vaal]]. The boughs tremble in concern over [[Winter Queen|the Queen's]] arrival. All must be as it should be.

Dreamweaver's wings droop with the weight of worry. Chaos swirls around the [[wildseed]]s under his care.

Calm the churning waters of the grove. Bring harmony to discord and let Dreamweaver flutter once more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|48|5}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You're new, aren't you? Not a fae, not a soul, nor are you bound for a wildseed.

And the droman sent you here to help me? Well, this just got very interesting.

==Notes==
This is one of the two quest chains that [[Droman Tashmur]] starts upon completion of [[Keep to the Path]]. He also starts [[Spirits of the Glen]].

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Featherlight|We have a lot to do before the queen arrives. No time to waste!}}

Find [[Dreamweaver]] to the south at the [[Tranquil Pools]]:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|No, no... this won't please the queen at all...}}

==Progression==
{{Tranquil Pools}}

==Beta version==

;Description
The song of [[Tirna Vaal]] is discordant. This must be corrected for the [[Winter Queen]]'s arrival.

One such discord surrounds Dreamweaver. He oversees the care of Tirna Vaal's [[wildseed]]s that reside nearby.
