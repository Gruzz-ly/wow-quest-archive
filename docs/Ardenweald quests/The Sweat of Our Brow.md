==Objectives==
Disarm 6 trapped tools.
* Booby trapped tools disarmed (6)
*Report to the Lady of the falls at Glitterfall Basin.

==Description==
Ah, an outsider! You are perfect for this task.

The [[spriggan]]s are known for their mischief. They have been cursing our tools and supplies and trapping unsuspecting workers!

Like our curses, they must obey the rules. You'll need shimmerdust for baskets, thread made of gossamer for harps, and minty fresh breath for the dreamcatchers. How odd.

Good luck and let the Lady of the Falls know when you're done. She'll be delighted to hear it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|37|20|60}}
* 12,950 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
The curses can be quite nasty. Do be careful out there. I'd hate to lose someone as useful as you.

==Completion==
Cursed tools? And you brought them back? Un-cursed!? I must say, I was not entirely expecting you to be quite so successful.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|[[Trapped Sylvar]]|Ooof, my hooves are so sore. I couldn't stop dancing after examining that harp....}}
:{{Text|say|Helpful Faerie|Oh, I do love dancing! Too bad you have to keep your feet on the ground. I can fly up here and nothing will throw me off balance!}}

You need to click on objects that will give you buffs, then interact with cursed tools in the area to obtain quest items. Collect any 6 of these quest items to complete the objective.
*[[Suspiciously Untouched Harp]]s can be disarmed while you have the {{Abilities|Gossamar Laces|id=311107|icon=inv_misc_web_01}} buff from [[Gossamer Thread (Ardenweald)|Gossamer Thread]]. Each disarmed harp becomes a [[Faerie Harp]].
**When the buff is not active, interacting with a harp gives the {{Abilities|Gotta Dance|id=311113|icon=ability_hunter_displacement}} debuff. The harp forces you to dance, [[root]]ing you in place for 10 seconds.
*[[Suspiciously Untouched Basket]]s can be disarmed while you have the {{Abilities|Shimmerdusted|id=311058|icon=inv_enchant_dust}} buff from a [[Shimmerdust Pile]]. Each disarmed basket becomes an [[Ordinary Basket]].
**When the buff is not active, interacting with a basket gives the {{Abilities|Basket Trap Sprung|id=310998|icon=inv_misc_basket_05}} debuff. The basket bites onto your hand, making you run in [[Fear effect|fear]] for 3 seconds.
*[[Suspiciously Untouched Soulweb]]s can be disarmed while you have the {{Abilities|Minty Fresh Breath|id=311103|icon=inv_misc_herb_jadetealeaf}} buff from [[Freshleaf]]. Each disarmed soulweb becomes an [[Enchanted Soulweb]].
**When the buff is not active, interacting with a soulweb gives the {{Abilities|Nightmares|id=311124|icon=spell_nature_sleep}} debuff. The soulweb puts you to sleep, [[stun]]ning you for 10 seconds.

;Description
Like our curses, they have to obey the rules. You can break the curse for good! It might not be obvious, but what you'll need will be nearby.

You seem clever enough to figure out how to do it. Good luck!
