==Objectives==
Rescue 5 Wounded Defenders from [[Soryn's Meadow]].
* [[Wounded Defender (Ardenweald)|Wounded Defender]] rescued (5)
*Speak with Ara'lon deeper within Soryn's Meadow.

==Description==
The [[Wild Hunt]] is holding the line against these monsters, lest they overrun the road to [[Hibernal Hollow]].

Too many of my fellow hunters have been possessed by the dark magic of those twisted masks.

But with you here, we might be able to turn the tide. 

Aid any hunters you can find before our foes turn them against us.

I will meet you farther within the meadow. If we rally our numbers, we can bring an end to this battle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|3|80}}
* 7,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you for rescuing my fellow hunters. We'll have time to respect those who have returned to the cycle when this is all over.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ara'lon|Come! Many are in need of aid!}}

Run past the immediate combat. Stay away from the [[Draining Totem]]s and interact with the Wounded Defenders to free them:
*{{text|say|Wounded Defender|We will not fail the forest!}}
*{{text|say|Wounded Defender|You have my thanks!}}
*{{text|say|Wounded Defender|They were twisting me into one of them...}}
*{{Text|say|Wounded Defender|This is no time to rest!}}
*{{Text|say|Wounded Defender|Their numbers grow with every battle...}}
*{{Text|say|Wounded Defender|The fight continues! For Ardenweald!}}

Once five have been rescued, head further south:
:{{text|say|[[Recovered Defender]]|They command a giant beast. Many of us fell to its claws.}}
:{{text|say|Ara'lon|Then it will fall to ours.}}

==Progression==
{{This is the Way}}

;Description
The Wild Hunt is holding the line to stop these monsters from overrunning the road to Hibernal Hollow.

Too many of my allies have been transformed into the "possessed", taken over by these strange masks.

With you here, we might be able to turn the tide.

Go and rescue any of the Wild Hunt before these beasts possess them with these strange masks.

Meet me at a hut further in the meadow. With enough numbers, we can cripple this attack.
