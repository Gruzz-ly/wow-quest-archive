* 9,450 [[XP]]

==Notes==
[[File:Swift Shadowstalker.jpg|thumb|A player transformed into a Swift Shadowstalker.]]
The player gets an extra action button:
:{{Abilities|Wrath of Nature|id=332350|Transform into a Swift Moonstalker.{{Sic}}|icon=talentspec_druid_feral_cat}}

Use the button to turn into an elite '''Swift Shadowstalker''' to kill [[Gorm Spewer]]s and [[Engorged Borer]]s in the Dusty Burrows. The Shadowstalker has the following abilities:
#{{Abilities|Swipe|id=332468|Swipe nearby enemies, inflicting Physical damage across multiple targets.|icon=inv_misc_monsterclaw_03}}
#{{Abilities|Claw|id=332469|Claw nearby enemies, inflicting Physical damage across multiple targets.|icon=artifactability_feraldruid_ashamanesbite}}
#{{Abilities|Dash|id=332470|Increases movement speed by 40%.|icon=ability_druid_dash_orange}}
#{{Abilities|Frenzied Regeneration|id=332471|Heals you for 40% of maximum health over 10 sec.|icon=ability_physical_taunt}}

The transformation wears off if the player leaves the Dusty Burrows:
:{{Text|bossemote|You are leaving the designated area and will be removed from your vehicle.}}
