==Objectives==
Slay 8 possessed creatures in [[Heartwood Grove]].
* Possessed slain (8)
*Find Niya further in Heartwood Grove.

==Description==
Heartwood Grove was to give up its anima so that other groves could survive.

But then... I started seeing these masks on many of the other fae. Soon, everyone was wearing them.

I don't know what has come over them, but it's clear they mean us harm. Please... you have to...

They aren't the friends I once knew. Not anymore.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|80|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There is no coming back for those who have become possessed. Believe me... I tried.

==Completion==
Thank you. I tried so hard to save them... but once that mask is on, there is no return.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Niya|I'll look for survivors. Meet me further into the grove.}}

Kill [[Possessed Sylvar]] and [[Possessed Vorkai]].

On complete of all three:
:{{text|say|Niya|Korenth... we'll take back the heart of the grove. I swear it.}}

==Progression==
{{Waning Grove}}

==Beta version==
{{Rfb-section}}
;Description
Heartwood Grove was chosen to be depleted so other groves could survive.

I started seeing [[sylvar]] and [[vorkai]] with these strange masks. Before I knew it, they were on nearly everyone here.

Please... you have to kill any of them who are wearing those masks.

They aren't the friends I once knew. All that remains are monsters that want to destroy [[Ardenweald]].

;Completion
Thank you. I tried so hard to save them from whatever this is... but once that mask is on there is no return.
