==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Maw]] and rescue Lost Souls.
* Lost Souls saved (3)

==Description==
You rescued some of the [[Night elf|night elves]] from the Maw before. While the danger is still great, I must ask you to do it again.

I have to believe that we can save them. As many of them as possible.

Please, go and see if you can recover any more lost souls.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
A great wrong must be righted, any way we can.

==Completion==
I thank you once again, [[Maw Walker]].

These souls are finally free of the torment and pain.

There are still so many more, but I am optimistic that we may yet save them.

==Notes==
Upon completing [[The Lost of Teldrassil]], this quest will be available after the next reset.

Like the previous quest, this one is looking for three specific souls, not any generic lost soul. As before, no dispensation for the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]] has been provided, so use caution if at threat level five, or return after the reset.

These three souls are also up in the [[Tremaculum]]:
* [[Ferryn]] near the stairs to the Convocation of Pain {{co|26.8|14.3|Maw}}
:Where is [[Delaryn Summermoon|Delaryn]]?
:{{gossip|It's time to get you out of here.}}
:{{text|emote|Ferryn's soul is safely secured.}}
* [[Anaris Windwood]] near the center {{co|28.8|16.1|Maw}}
:I will never be broken.
:{{gossip|It's time to get you out of here.}}
:{{text|emote|Anaris Windwood's soul is safely secured.}}
* [[Ilthalaine]] in the vicinity of the [[Chaotic Riftstone]] to the [[Crucible of the Damned]] {{co|25.5|16.0|Maw}}
:I miss [[Shadowglen]].
:{{gossip|It's time to get you out of here.}}
:{{text|emote|Ilthalaine's soul is safely secured.}}
