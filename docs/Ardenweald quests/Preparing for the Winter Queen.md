Receive Ardenweald's essence from Lady Moonberry.
* Received [[Ardenweald]]'s essence from [[Lady Moonberry]]
*Speak with Droman Tashnur in Tirna Vaal.

==Description==
[[Tirna Vaal]] is ready for the [[Winter Queen]]'s arrival! And it's all thanks to you.

You have more than upheld your end of our bargain... and yet I was not able to do the same.

That is absolutely unacceptable for a faerie like me! What would the others think if they knew I had failed to honor our agreement?

Please, allow me to make it up to you. I may not have been able to deliver your message to the Queen, but I have a special surprise that I hope you'll accept instead!

You will learn one of :

Joy follows Lady Moonberry, a scent that lingers as a flower blooms.

==Completion==
Shadows loom over [[Heartwood Grove]]. Things unseen crawl within the darkness.

==Notes==
Speak with Moonberry again:
:Tirna Vaal is one of the more fortunate groves. It has a chance to survive. And the Queen will do everything in her power to make it so.
:{{gossip|I'm ready to be properly prepared to meet the Winter Queen.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|A faerie must always repay a favor. You've done much for the forest, but I couldn't deliver your message in return.}}
:''Moonberry launches the player 200 yards up.''
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Please accept this gift instead. A small part of Ardenweald's magic, yours to use as you wish.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|There! Now that we're even--wait, what's that?}}
:''The camera pans to the road showing a large number of [[Heartwood Grove Evacuee]]s fleeing downhill towards [[Tirna Vaal]].''
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Look! All those fae running from Heartwood Grove... Something's wrong!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|I'll alert the Wild Hunt. It looks like we need your help again!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Tashmur, catch!}}
:''Moonberry releases her spell and the player drops... safely into Tashmur's arms.''
:{{text|say|Droman Tashmur|Keening winds descend from Heartwood Grove... the forest cowers...}}

;Description
You've really helped get [[Tirna Vaal]] ready for the [[Winter Queen]]'s arrival!

The Winter Queen won't regret her decision for Tirna Vaal to survive, not when everything is so well prepared.

There's just one last thing that needs to be fixed. You!

I can't have you meet the Winter Queen without some of Ardenweald's essence!

;Progress
Lady Moonberry's song does fill so many of us with joy and delight.

;Completion
There is great conflict drowning the already sorrowful song of [[Heartwood Grove]].
