'''No Wisp Left Behind''' is a quest offered by [[Ysera]] in the [[Heart of the Forest]], first made available the week of January 16, 2021.

==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Maw]] and rescue Lost Souls from the [[Tremaculum]] and the [[Planes of Torment]].
* [[Lost Soul (Maw)|Lost Soul]] saved (8)

==Description==
More of the [[Night elf|Kaldorei]] [[soul]]s still languish in the [[Maw]].

I ask you once again, [[Maw Walker]], to find them.

Help correct this wrong.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
A great wrong must be righted, any way we can.

==Completion==
It brings me joy to see more souls freed from that dark place.

Thank you Maw Walker, for continuing to help us.

==Notes==
*Upon completing [[From a Dark Place]], this quest will be available after the next reset.
*Find Lost Souls in the [[Tremaculum]] and the [[Planes of Torment]] in the [[Maw]].
*Note that these souls DO also count for [[Return Lost Souls (Night Fae)]] if that quest has not been completed, and these souls will not advance threat on the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]].
*After completing this quest the first time, a repeatable version will become available.

;Talk to the souls
*I never gave up hope.
*Is there any end to this torment?
*Is it over?
*I prayed that the Goddess would hear us...
