==Objectives==
Find [[Choofa]] in the [[Spirit Glen]].

==Description==
Animals of the forest, mortal souls given form, frolic in the glen. Their anima, a boon to the weald, given freely as rain on the leaves.

But danger lurks in the shadows. A dark storm of malice and enmity tears at the trees. Creatures seeking shelter find only peril.

Rescue them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|45|70}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What's this? What's this?

The Tall Tree has sent you to help us? Help us!

==Notes==
This is one of the two quest chains that [[Droman Tashmur]] starts upon completion of [[Keep to the Path]]. He also starts [[Dreamweaver (quest)]].

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Featherlight|We have a lot to do before the queen arrives. No time to waste!}}

Head northeast to find [[Choofa]] up in [[Spirit Glen]]:
:{{text|say|Choofa|Help! Spriggans stole our anima! They took my friends!}}

==Progression==

;Description
[[Soul]]s most attuned to [[nature]] come to [[Ardenweald]] for their rest. Those not to be reborn, play in the forest. It is their reward, and it is their service.

Their forms are of their choosing, and they give of their [[anima]] to the groves.

The cycle thus continues, even after their [[death]].

But to the north, these souls do not rest. They have fallen into danger, into unrest.

Seek them, and save them.
