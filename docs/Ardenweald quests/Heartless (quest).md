==Objectives==
Return to [[Droman Tashmur]] in [[Tirna Vaal]].

==Description==
So many of my friends have returned to the cycle... all because of those strange masks.

Why did they take my friends? What was the point of destroying the heart of my grove?

You have to return to Tirna Vaal tell Droman Tashmur what happened here. 

I'll make my way there eventually. I just... need some time to say goodbye.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Dreamthorn Chainmail
|Grove Warden's Breastplate
|Spirit Tender's Robe
|Starshroud Vest
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|48|5}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Shadows loom over the weald, harbingers of tragedy to come.

The river of fate flows swiftly, its currents inexorable. Where they lead... cannot yet be seen.
