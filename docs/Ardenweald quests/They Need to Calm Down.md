==Objectives==
Defeat [[Spriggan]]s and use the Soulweb to drain them of stolen [[anima]] in [[Spirit Glen]].
* Stolen Anima reclaimed (8)
* [[Boggart (mob)|Boggart]] slain
* [[Soulweb]] (provided)

==Description==
Spriggans! Nasty spriggans. They came to the grove. They messed it all up!

They took the anima from the soul webs! We were collecting it, yes. Collecting it for the [[Droman Tashmur|Tall Tree]] and their grove. The spriggans have to pay!

Beat them up! Then use this soulweb to take back the anima. We need it! They don't!

You will receive:
* {{cost|24|57|}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you destroy them? Did you make them pay?

==Completion==
Stolen! They stole the anima! They ran like crazy and...

Wait that's normal. They're always that bad. Stupid spriggans!

Kill the spriggan and use the quest items while looking for the named mobs on the other quest.
