==Objectives==
Take Ysera's [[wildseed]] to the [[Heart of the Forest]].
* Speak with [[Lady Moonberry|Moonberry]]
* [[Ysera]]'s wildseed escorted {{co|48.2|54.1|Ardenweald}}

==Description==
We have lost so much... and this one is special.

<Moonberry looks at you, resolute. Her voice is strangely formal, her manner commanding.>

Come, <name>. We will carry her on the [[Path of Rebirth]] and entreat [[Winter Queen|the Queen]] to save her.

Hurry and make preparations. We have little time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|63|60}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well met, stranger. You arrive in... interesting times.

<Herne snorts a laugh.>

And with equally interesting company.

==Notes==
Speak with Moonberry again:
:We must get Ysera's wildseed to the Queen, it's her only hope!
:{{gossip|I am ready to go.}}

Aliothe, Moonberry, Korayn, Niya, and Ara'lon escort Ysera's wildseed up the western road as the fae of the forest follow along:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|I once said that your voice is but one bird singing in the night.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Well... I think it's time we all sang with you.}}

At the [[Heart of the Forest]], the party stops as [[Lord Herne]] approaches:
:{{text|say|Lord Herne|Moonberry. Here to play more tricks? Or are there serious matters at hand?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Matters most serious, I'm afraid.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Lord Herne, we request an audience with the Winter Queen.}}
