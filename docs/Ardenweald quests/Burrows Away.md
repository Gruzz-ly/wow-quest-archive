==Objectives==
Collapse [[Gorm]] Burrows in the [[Dusty Burrows]].
* [[Gorm Burrow]] collapsed (8)

==Description==
<The ground has been freshly dug, and there are signs of more tunnels all over the place.

Collapsing a few burrows would go a long way toward keeping [[Tirna Vaal]] safe from gorm infestation.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|37|20|60}}
* 12,950 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
Have you found out how the gorm are spreading so quickly?

==Completion==
The gorm are digging even MORE burrows beneath Ardenweald? This is very bad news indeed. 

Thank you for taking it upon yourself to close them down. That should give us some time to reinforce our defenses.
