==Objectives==
Destroy 10 [[Gorm]] [[Egg]]s in the [[Banks of Life]].
* [[Gorm Eggs|Gorm eggs]] destroyed (10)

==Description==
As you can see, we have a gorm problem.

I'm not sure what has them so riled up. They've been getting bigger, more hostile. It must be due to the [[anima]] drought. If nothing stops them, they'll eat everything!

Their egg production is out of control. We can't let their population grow any larger. Please, go in to their nests and destroy as many of their eggs as you can find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|37|20|60}}
* 12,950 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
There are plenty of gorm and plenty of eggs. We need to get this situation under control!

==Completion==
This should hopefully curtail their numbers. Thank you for your help.

==Progression==
{{Trouble at the Gormling Corral}}
