==Objectives==
Collect 8 Animacones.
* [[Animacone (Take the Power)]] (8)

==Description==
Wait! Before you enter, I would ask something of you.

While we have not had a [[wildseed]] in some time, we did keep stores of [[anima]]. It served us well in staving off the [[gorm]].

Whatever has happened to my village, I do not want this power to remain in their hands. It will better serve [[Ardenweald]] in other groves.

Keep an eye out for any anima within the village. We will put it to better use elsewhere.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|37|20|60}}
* 12,950 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find any anima?

==Completion==
May this find use in the forest. May their losses not be in vain.

==Progression==
{{An Ominous Stone}}
