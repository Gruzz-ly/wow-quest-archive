;Objective
Shake 8 Swollen Mushroom Stalks.

;Description
The mushrooms in there need your help, <class>!

Some of the larger mushrooms become laden with spores. It is one of my duties to help disperse them and grow the grove, but it is too dangerous for me in there.

If you're going to go in, do you mind giving any particularly full mushrooms a good shake for me? That should get most of the spores loose until we can secure the grove.
