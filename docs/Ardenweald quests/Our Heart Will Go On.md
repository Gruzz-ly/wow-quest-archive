;Upon talking with [[Zayhad, The Builder]]

:A new heart must be grafted for this [[Tirna Rowen|grove]], though such a song will take many seasons to sing.

:The beginning of a new heart is joyful memories. I can feel them within the roots of this grove.

:Take this acorn. It will give you eyes to see and take these memories.

:Recover them and bring them to me.

::I'll tak{{sic|remove if spelled correctly in the game.}} this acorn and recover memories within Heartwood Grove.

{{text|say|[[Zayhad, The Builder]]|Dreams grow into hope. Nourish the acorn with lost song and laughter.}}
