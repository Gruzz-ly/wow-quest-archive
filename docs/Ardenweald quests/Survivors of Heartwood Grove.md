==Objectives==
Rescue Casad, Wagonmaster Derawyn, and Te'zan from the possessed.

* [[Te'zan]] rescued {{co|68.9|22.1|Ardenweald}}

==Description==
[[Korenth]]... I can't believe he's...

We have to save whomever we can. Droman Krelnor is too strong for us to face alone.

I saw a few other survivors scattered around the grove. Hurry, we have no time to waste!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|80|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must rescue my friends!

==Completion==
Derawyn... I can't lose her too! We can use the animacones to save her!

==Notes==
Pick up both quests and kill a path east to reach [[Warden Casad]]:
:{{text|say|Warden Casad|Foul magic... a familiar foe...}}

Interact with him to free him:
:{{text|say|Warden Casad|Gratitude blooms amidst the storm. Our paths converge in the mire.}}

Head north and enter the root of the tree to find [[Te'zan]]:
:{{text|say|Te'zan|These be the meanest fae I've ever met!}}

Free him:
:{{text|say|Te'zan|Thanks, I'll run ahead! I'm guessing you could use some help.}}

Head west downhill to find [[Wagonmaster Derawyn]]:
:{{text|say|Wagonmaster Derawyn|So... dark...}}

Free her:
:{{text|say|Wagonmaster Derawyn|It's... too late... for me...}}

==Progression==

;Description
With [[Korenth]]... passed, we'll need help to get the heart back from the droman.

There are three survivors trapped nearby.

One is Warden Casad, a tirnenn who has tended to Ardenweald longer than I can count.

Another is Wagonmaster Derawyn, who was here to help deliver wildseeds to Tirna Vaal.

The last is... Te'zan. A soul who complains too much for my liking. 

If we rescue them we may be able to recover the heart of the grove from the droman!

Korenth's passing will not be in vain.

;Completion
Derawyn... we can't let her die. If we have the animacones, we can use them to save her!
