==Description==
A stunning performance... in more ways than one.

So much has transpired on [[Azeroth]] in my absence. But there was one dream I did not see portrayed onstage.

I dreamt of [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande Whisperwind]], engulfed in darkness, twisted by anger and a thirst for vengeance. I witnessed a forbidden ritual, the rise of a new [[Night Warrior]], and a hunt that can end only in tragedy. That too must be real.

<Ysera shakes her head.>

The [[Winter Queen]] awaits you in the [[Heart of the Forest]]. We had best be on our way.

==Rewards==
You will learn: Night Fae class ability

You will receive:
* World Quests
* Covenant Callings
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Welcome to the Hunt.

==Completion==
Your actions here will echo beyond the veil. Aid the forest, and all mortal worlds may yet be saved.

==Notes==
Speak with Ysera:
:This place is new and yet I feel almost as if I have been here before.
:{{gossip|I'm ready to go.}}

You hop on Ysera's back. As she flies you to the [[Heart of the Forest]], she speaks:
* ''NOTE: Some of Ysera's voice lines may not properly trigger.''
:{{text|say|Ysera|I thought it was all a dream. [[Argus]] in the sky, the [[Sword of Sargeras|blade]] in the [[Silithus: The Wound|desert]]... [[Teldrassil]] [[Burning of Teldrassil|aflame]]...}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|All of those souls, lost to the [[Maw]]... and Tyrande...}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|Her rage darkens her heart like a shadow on the moon. Her hunt is endless and unrelenting.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|But the Night Warrior's power is as much a curse as it is a blessing. It threatens to tear her asunder from within.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|I could not aid the [[Night elf|kaldorei]] when Teldrassil burned. I pray I can aid Tyrande before it is too late.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|For now, however, I believe the queen bids you speak with her.}}

Just inside, speak with [[Attendant Sparkledew]]:
: {{text|say|Attendant Sparkledew|I can take you to see the queen, <name>.}}
:Greetings, <name>!
:May I be assistance?
:{{gossip|Take me to the Queen's audience chamber, please.}}

A moth [[:soulshape]] flies you up to the audience chamber. Assembled on the sides of the room are [[Ysera]], [[Dreamweaver]], [[Droman Aliothe]], [[Droman Tashmur]], [[Ara'lon]], [[Hunt-Captain Korayn]], and [[Kivarr]]. The Winder Queen stands in front of her chair at the opposit end of the room, with [[Lady Moonberry]] and [[Lord Herne]] at her sides.
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|<Name>, step forward and receive my favor.}}

Stand on the blue swirl on the ground and use the bonus ability {{Abilities|Swearing Oath|id=313378|icon=inv_shield_1h_ardenweald_d_01}}. You kneel, and a cutscene plays:
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|You have achieved much in the span of a mortal life. We are fortunate to call you an ally.}}
:''A group of [[sylvar]] and [[vorkai]] has gathered behind you.''
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|And so by anima, we bless you. By spirit, we embrace you. By oath, we stand beside you.}}
:''As the queen says "we embrace you," Droman Aliothe bows. As she says "we stand beside you," Lord Herne salutes.''
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|Rise, <name> of Azeroth, as <huntsman/huntress> of the Wild Hunt, champion of the Court of Night, and protector of Ardenweald.}}
:''You stand. A beam of blue light shines down on you, fireflies swarm and plants bloom around you, and the fae behind you salute as well.''

On complete:
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|Night embrace you, <name>. Your hunt begins.}}

At this point, [[alt]] characters can speak to the Winter Queen to skip ahead:
:{{gossip|I know my way around the Sanctum. {{text|red|<Skip ahead in the campaign chapter to meet your first soulbind.>}}}}
:''You're teleported in front of Lady Moonberry on the main floor of the Heart of the Forest. She offers [[The Forge of Bonds]].''

;Description
Your performance was certainly... memorable. The Court was impressed, at least. They do seem fond of showmanship.

Even fanciful as the production was, I was startled by what transpired on [[Azeroth]] while I was gone. [[Argus]], [[Silithus]], [[Teldrassil]], [[Fourth War|another war]]...

<Ysera shakes her head.>

I had hoped these were merely dark dreams haunting me. But they were all too real.

Come, <name>. I will convey you to the Heart Tree for the induction ceremony. We will speak along the way.
