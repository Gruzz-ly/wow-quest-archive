==Objectives==
Enter Torghast to recover Tyrande Whisperwind.
* [[Shandris Feathermoon]] followed into [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned|Torghast]]
* [[Tyrande Whisperwind]] recovered from Torghast

==Description==
The [[Night Warrior]]'s power is tearing Tyrande apart. Such rage... it is consuming her.

<Shandris is silent a moment.>

And yet, my mother speaks true. We cannot leave the [[soul]]s of my people to suffer.

We shall follow Tyrande into Torghast. We must find a way to save the spirits of the [[Night elf|kaldorei]].

And in the process, pray that we can save my [[Darnassian|minn'do]] as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 9,350 [[XP]]
*[[Emblem of Renown]]

==Completion==
I cannot fault my mother's intent... but she will be consumed before she finds justice for our people.

We must find another way to bring her back.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Follow me into Torghast, <name>. We must make haste.}}

Head through the Portal to Torghast, then interact with Shandris, near the Wayfinder:
:This place is wrong, <name>. All those who were lost in Teldrassil do not deserve to be tortured here.
:{{gossip|(Quest) Follow Shandris Feathermoon into Torghast to find Tyrande Whisperwind.}}

This sends the player to a special version of the [[Fracture Chambers]].

===Stage 1: Find Tyrande Whisperwind===
:''Search Torghast for Tyrande Whisperwind''

:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|You will know Elune's wrath!}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|She will let nothing bar her path. We must fight our way through to her!}}

The way is barred. Kill of waves of [[Fading Shade]]s, [[Scavenging Soul Eater]]s, Mawsworn Guards, [[Mawsworn Debilitator]]s, and [[Mawsworn Defender]]s, until the quota is met.

===Stage 5: Catch up with Tyrande===

*(Optional) Disable traps
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Quickly, push forward! The Night Warrior's power threatens to consume her!}}

*[[Skuld]] slain
:{{Text|say|Skuld|Ah... more souls to torment.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Their torment ends now!}}

Tyrande will tank Skuld. Use the opportunity to free the three [[Bound Soul]]s surrounding Skuld:
:{{Text|say|Bound Soul|Can you... hear me?}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|By Elune! You can bear these souls to safety!}}
:{{Text|say|Bound Soul|They have taken... everything...}}
:{{Text|say|Bound Soul|I don't deserve this...}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|The fiend is vulnerable! Strike it down!}}

:''Tyrande must be up ahead. Find her!''
*Tyrande found
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|We must reach Tyrande before it is too late!}}

Keep following the trail west, then north, through the massive scythes. At the top of the steps, a huge number of [[Night Elf Soul]]s are chained up. A dozen or so wind up combined into the Tortured Amalgamation:
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|What vile magic is this?!}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|NO!}}
:{{Text|say|Tortured Amalgamation|Pain... suffering... no hope...}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|The souls of the kaldorei... twisted into that monstrosity!}}

:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Forgive us! There is no other way!}}

25%:
:{{Text|say|Tortured Amalgamation|The Banshee... has won! All life... consumed!}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Sylvanas will NEVER win! This I vow!}}

Defeat it:
:{{Text|say|Tortured Amalgamation|Avenge... Teldrassil... avenge... us!}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|The Banshee will know your suffering one hundred fold!}}

===Stage 10: Tyrande Whisperwind's Refusal===
:''The battle is won, but what of Tyrande?''
*Beseech Tyrande to return

Tyrande is still doing her Night Warrior thing. Dodge the swirlies and speak with her:

Alliance dialogue:
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Minn'do, come with us. We can leave the darkness of the Maw behind and bring you back to the light.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|No! My hunt will not cease until every soul is saved... and the Banshee has answered for her crimes!}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|This Maw Walker has the means to deliver our brothers and sisters from their torment.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|If that is true, then I entrust this sacred duty to you, <name/child of Teldrassil>. Save the souls of <my/our> people.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|While I claim vengeance upon the one who put them here!}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Please, Maw Walker! Use the crystal you carry to save these kaldorei spirits!}}

Horde dialogue:
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Minn'do, come with us. We can leave the darkness of the Maw behind and bring you back to the light.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|You think this hero of the Horde will aid us? I should strike them down where they stand!}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I share your doubts... but I have witnessed them saving lost souls. I believe they can help us.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|You need not trust them... but I ask that you trust me.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|So be it. See that this champion of the Horde atones for their people's crimes.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|While I claim vengeance for the kaldorei.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Please, Maw Walker! Use the crystal you carry to save these kaldorei spirits!}}

===Stage 11: Salvation of the Night Elves===
:''Tyrande is gone, but you can still save the group of night elves trapped in the Maw.''
*Soulkeeper Crystal placed
*Night elf souls rescued (80)

Interact with the Soulkeeper Crystal ghost object. The souls will enter the crystal on their own.

===Final Stage: The Kaldorei Rescued===
:''It is time to return to Ardenweald with the rescued night elves in the Soulkeeper.''
*Speak with Shandris to leave
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|At least these kaldorei souls were freed. For the first time in a long while, I feel... hope.}}

Speak with Shandris:
:Tyrande will not stop until the Banshee Queen is destroyed... or the rage of the Night Warrior consumes her.
:<Shandris pauses, as if whispering a prayer.>
:It is a blessing that the crystal you bear was able to draw in so many souls of those who fell at Teldrassil.
:I wonder... perhaps my mother's presence touched the soulkeeper in some way. Making it a beacon for those who were lost. Allowing Elune's grace to aid them one last time.
:I would see them saved from this dark place, <name>.
:{{gossip|I can bring you and these souls to Ardenweald. (Leave Scenario)}}

===Finale===
Return to Shandris at [[Ve'nari's Refuge]] in the Maw.
