==Objectives==
Heal 10 wounded [[sylvar]] in the [[Banks of Life]].
* [[Wounded Sylvar|Wounded sylvar]] healed (10)
* [[Jar of Clay]] (provided)

==Description==
You've returned just in time! Fae are in danger!

It seems our actions have enraged the gorm. They are even more aggressive than they were before!

While some fae were able to evacuate, there are still many who are trapped down there.

Take this jar and slather anyone you find with a generous helping. That should heal their wounds and give them a chance to escape.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|37|20|60}}
* 12,950 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with [[The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
I hope everyone is all right.

==Completion==
Thank you for rescuing them.

;Description
You arrived just in time. There are people in danger!

I'm not sure what has the gorm so riled up. They've been getting bigger, more hostile. It must be due to the aether shortage. If nothing stops them, they'll eat everything!

While some of us were able to evacuate before we were overrun, there are still many that are trapped down there.

Take this jar and slather anyone you find with a generous helping. That should heal their wounds and give them a fighting chance to get out of there.
