==Objectives==
*Assist the patrol

==Description==
:{{text|say|[[Lord Herne]]|Maw Walker, a few of my hunters are on patrol in [[Mistveil Tangle]]. It might do well for their morale if you were to accompany them.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +125 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Completion==
:{{text|say|Lord Herne|Well fought! No matter where they lurk or how fast they run, no prey can elude the Wild Hunt!}}

==Notes==
Find [[Zarkin]] and assist in killing the mobs. They will be at one of several stops -- it does not matter which they are at when joining up with them.

Start:
:{{text|say|Zarkin|Be on your guard, Lumera. This is a dangerous patrol for a novice huntress.}}
:{{text|say|Lumera|I am up to the task, sir. No challenge is too daunting.}}
:{{text|say|Zarkin|We shall see about that. Leithfor, you take point.}}
:{{text|say|Janda|Pay Zarkin no mind, Lumera. He values deeds over words.}}
:{{text|emote|Leithfor nods silently.}}
:{{text|say|Fluffpuff|That's right. So you just need to unleash some mayhem on our foes!}}

First stop:
:{{text|say|Fluffpuff|Spriggans! Perfect for target practice! Too bad there are so few of them...}}
:{{text|say|Krrprripripkraak|The forest obliges.}}
:{{text|say|Leithfor|Look out!}}

Defeat the wave:
:{{text|say|Janda|Spriggans do not usually attack with such coordination. Someone must be guiding them.}}
:{{text|say|Zarkin|Indeed. The question is who that might be.}}

Second stop:
:{{text|say|Lumera|Look, refugees! They need our help!}}
:{{text|say|Zarkin|Lumera, no! Stay back!}}
:{{text|say|Illusionary Mauler|Please, save us! They're almost here!}}
:{{text|say|Illusionary Mauler|Please, save us! They're almost here!}}
:{{text|say|Illusionary Mauler|Please, save us! They're almost here!}}
:{{text|say|Mistveil Deceiver|Please, save us! They're almost here!}}

Defeat the boggarts:
:{{text|say|Lumera|An illusion... and I fell for it.}}
:{{text|say|Janda|There are no refugees to be found in Tirna Scithe. We all learned that the hard way.}}
:{{text|emote|Leithfor nods solemnly.}}

Third stop, near Shigizer:
:{{text|say|Krrprripripkraak|Tears of rain for Tirna Scithe. So little anima, so many gorm.}}
:{{text|say|Fluffpuff|And here come more of them now!}}

Defeat the gorm:
:{{text|say|Zarkin|If this drought doesn't end soon, all of Ardenweald will share Tirna Scithe's fate.}}
:{{text|say|Lumera|We won't let that happen. The Wild Hunt will protect the forest through feast and famine.}}
:{{text|say|Zarkin|Spoken like a true huntress.}}

Fourth stop:
:{{text|say|Zarkin|The [[Drust]]! [[Wild Hunt]], to arms!}}
:{{text|say|[[Fluffpuff]]|They'll be sorry they ever set foot in Ardenweald!}}

Defeat them:
:{{text|say|[[Lumera]]|I once thought the Drust were a myth... mere stories told to frighten young fae.}}
:{{text|say|[[Janda]]|The stories are real. Though long has it been since the Wild Hunt met them in open battle.}}
:{{text|say|Zarkin|And now we encounter them in every corner of the forest. These are grim times.}}

Last stop:
:{{text|say|Janda|Wait. Do you hear that?}}
:{{text|say|Lumera|No, nothing at all...}}
:{{text|say|Janda|That's what I'm worried about.}}
:{{text|say|Leithfor|Devourer!}}

Defeat it:
:{{text|say|Janda|That was a worthy hunt. Your skills are improving, Lumera.}}
:{{text|say|Lumera|I learned much on this patrol. It was an honor to hunt beside you all.}}
:{{text|say|Krrprripripkraak|Roots grow stronger together.}}
:{{text|say|Fluffpuff|And there's no one stronger than the Wild Hunt!}}
:{{text|say|Leithfor|Indeed.}}
:{{text|say|Zarkin|Rest up, everyone. For soon the hunt will begin anew.}}
