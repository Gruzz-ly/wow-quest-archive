Find Finnan's Lucky Mallet.
* [[Finnan's Lucky Mallet]]

==Description==
Oh, I am quite all right! There's just one little thing....

One of these fiends made off with my lucky mallet! I simply cannot leave my mallet behind. I do not even use it much any more, but it is quite lucky and I always keep it with me.

Please, I cannot even think about building anything without it. Do keep an eye out for it, will you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|37|20|60}}
* 12,950 [[XP]]
* +160 [[reputation]] with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
It is small, and quite lucky. I am sure you will know it when you see it.

==Completion==
Oh, you found it! How lucky, do you see?

==Progression==
