==Objectives==
Slay Mothbane the Mighty
* [[Mothbane the Mighty]] slain {{co|64.7|19.9|Ardenweald}}

==Description==
Let's make a deal, <name>. I'll seek out the [[Winter Queen]] on your behalf if you complete a few of my duties in my stead. The Queen isn't the only one who's been kept busy by the drought!

First, you're going to help my fellow fae here with their [[spriggan]] problem. Boot their leader off that poor moth! [[Featherlight]] will tell you where to go after that. 

We'll reunite in [[Tirna Vaal]] if you survive.

Oh, and I would stay on the path if I were you. [[Ardenweald]] can be dangerous for the unwary!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|49|14|}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Not bad! Not bad at all!

==Completion==
If you can handle the spriggans then perhaps I can give you some of the more interesting items on Lady Moonberry's agenda. Excellent!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Featherlight will guide you from here. Help the forest as you head for Tirna Vaal!}}

Mothbane the Mighty is riding a [[Saddled Ardenmoth]].

==Progression==
{{Welcome to Ardenweald}}

==Beta version==
;Description
I will seek out the [[Winter Queen|Queen]] on your behalf, <name>, but in return you are going to need to handle things in my stead. My Queen isn't the only one who's been kept busy by the drought!

First, you're going to help my fellow [[Night Fae]] here with their [[spriggan]] problem. Boot their leader off that poor moth, then [[Featherlight]] will tell you where to go next.

If you survive, we'll meet at [[Tirna Vaal]].

And I would stay on the path if I were you. [[Ardenweald]] can be dangerous for the unwary.
