{{questportrait|Droman Krelnor.jpg|Droman Krelnor|The droman of Heartwood Grove is possessed by these strange masks. He must be slain to save the grove's heart!}}

==Objectives==
Speak with Te'zan to break down the droman's barrier, then confront Droman Krelnor.
* Speak with [[Te'zan]] {{co|66.3|23.8|Ardenweald}}
* [[Droman Krelnor]] thwarted {{co|65.6|24.4|Ardenweald}}
*Speak with Niya within the Shrouded Mire.

==Description==
Darkness grasps the heart of Droman Krelnor, as he grasps the heart of the grove.

Anima drains from the heart, nectar taken from ripened fruit. It must be stopped.

Foul magic bars the way. Anima in peril, anima the salvation.

Beseech [[Te'zan]]. An old soul, brimming with anima, the spark to ignite our hope.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|80|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We've lost so much. Why would anyone do this?

==Notes==
Speak with Te'zan:
:I don't like the way you're looking at me. 
:You do know you're supposed to find everlasting peace in the afterlife, right?
*{{gossip|I need you to use some of your anima to destroy the droman's barrier.}}
*{{gossip|Who are you?}}

;Who are you?
:Who am I? I'm a soul!
:When my time came, I was called to Ardenweald. I worked with spirits all my life, so it felt only... well, natural.
:How do you like my soul shape form? I always wanted to run around as a wolf ALL the time!

;Use anima
:{{text|say|Te'zan|You want my anima? Why can't the ancient tirnenn do it?}}
:{{text|say|Warden Casad|Darkness encroaches. Starlight shines in our defense.}}
:{{text|say|Warden Casad|Anima given shall return in time.}}
:{{text|say|Te'zan|Well, okay. But I better get some back later!}}
:{{text|say|Te'zan|There. Let's finish this!}}

The barrier broken, run forward to engage [[Droman Krelnor]]:
:{{text|say|Droman Krelnor|Ardenweald will belong to the masters!}}
:{{text|say|Niya|You will take nothing more!}}

At 50%:
:{{text|say|Droman Krelnor|All shall bow! All shall wither!}}

Defeat Krelnor and the [[:Heart of Tirna Rowen]] falls:
:{{text|say|Droman Krelnor|Niya... I... am sorry...}}
:{{text|say|Niya|The heart of the grove! No!}}
:{{text|say|Niya|Without the heart's anima, so many wildseeds will starve...}}
:{{text|say|Warden Casad|Hope grows from seeds of ash. The cycle continues, always.}}
:{{text|say|Warden Casad|Our paths diverge in the twilit woods. Tirna Vaal beckons you home.}}

==Progression==

;Description
The droman of [[Heartwood Grove]] seems to be controlled by some sort of otherworldly [[magic]].

If we do not hurry, he will drain all of the [[anima]] out of the heart. I do hate to be in a rush, but we have no choice.

We will need some amount of anima to break through that barrier. 

Lucky for us, Te'zan is an older spirit of [[Ardenweald]]. He has plenty of it to spare. 

Speak with Te'zan, and tell the old spirit to use his anima to help save the heart.
