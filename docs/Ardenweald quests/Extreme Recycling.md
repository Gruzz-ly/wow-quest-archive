==Objectives==
Slay the [[Blighted]] and take their weapons.
* [[Fae Weapon]] collected (10)

==Description==
The [[Wild Hunt]] serves the [[Winter Queen]] under the leadership of [[Lord Herne]]. We are elite [[fighter]]s, [[hunter]]s, and [[tracker]]s.

But we cannot fight without weapons and supplies. The droman here informs me that there are severe obstacles to their delivery.

I do not have time to wait. We need equipment, and we need it now.

See what you can scavenge from the field. A broken weapon can always be mended and put to use again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|80|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find anything of use out there?

==Completion==
You found far more weapons than I expected.

Very strange. How could they acquire so many of OUR blades?

<Korayn appears troubled.>

They will be used against our enemies again, I swear it.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests before heading out. Kill a path across the pools.

The [[Lady of the Falls]] offers an optional side quest, [[Trouble in the Banks]].

==Progression==
{{Glittering Falls}}
