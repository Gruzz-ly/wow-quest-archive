==Objectives==
Speak with the [[Lady of the Falls]] in [[Glitterfall Basin]].

==Description==
I probably would have been digested if not for you. And while that sounds like a fascinating phenomenon, I am glad I did not experience it... firsthand.

You have a knack for solving problems and you're not afraid to get your hands dirty with our tools. Might I suggest paying a visit to Glitterfall Basin, to the west? It is home to our finest minds and workshops, and I am sure they could use your help in this drought.

The Lady of the Falls is [[droman]] there. She will know where you can best help!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|48|5}}
* 1,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Master Sha'lor sent you? Such a darling.

Next time you see him you can tell him that it's perfectly safe here.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|[[Sorcha]]|Our weapons are dull and broken. We require more!}}
:{{Text|say|Lady of the Falls|As you can see, dearie, we are quite preoccupied with our other matters. I will see to it that your request is answered in due time.}}

This is an optional breadcrumb to [[Glitterfall Basin]]. However, to unlock [[Trouble in the Banks|her next quest]], [[Call of the Hunt]] must be completed.
