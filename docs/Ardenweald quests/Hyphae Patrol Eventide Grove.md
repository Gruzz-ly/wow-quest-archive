==Objectives==
Ride the fae rings and slay 30 Possessed Invaders in [[Eventide Grove]].
* Speak to [[Marasmius]]
* [[Possessed Invader]] slain (30)

==Description==
I hope you're ready to fight.

The [[drust]] are bolstering their forces in Eventide Grove. Most of [[Ardenweald]] doesn't remember them, but I do. You have to completely root them out to be rid of their presence, or they'll grow right back, tougher than ever.

Come with me. We're going to exterminate every last one of them. Let me know when you're ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Marasmius]]

==Progress==
Quickly, before they spread any further into Ardenweald. Now's our chance.

==Completion==
Good work. They're still holed up in Darkreach, but that's the best we can do for now. Keep 'em contained, and then we'll burn them out.

==Patch changes==
