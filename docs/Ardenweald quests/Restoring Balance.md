==Objectives==
Speak to [[Lady Moonberry]] at the [[Heart of the Forest]] in [[Ardenweald]].

==Description==
Ardenweald is crucial to the cycle of rebirth for nature spirits that enter their realm.

Unfortunately, the [[anima]] drought has led to the loss of entire groves--[[soul]]s that will never complete their cycle.

Now foes seek to destroy what remains of the once tranquil forests, threatening the already beleaguered [[Court of Night]].

Lady Moonberry of the Court has requested aid. [[Pathscribe Roh-Avonavi]] in the [[Ring of Transference]] above can provide transport.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Welcome! What brings you to the Heart of the Forest?
