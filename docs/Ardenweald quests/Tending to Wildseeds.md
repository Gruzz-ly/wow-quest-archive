[[File:Wildseed (object).jpg|thumb|A wildseed in need of anima]]

==Objectives==
Collect basket of animacones, then use them on 4 wildseeds.
*[[Animacone Basket|Basket of animacones]] taken{{co|64.2|41.3|Ardenweald}}
*[[Wildseed (object)|Wildseeds]] imbued with anima (4)
*Find [[Dreamweaver]] within the [[Tranquil Pools]].

==Description==
We infuse [[wildseed]]s with [[anima]] from the [[animacone]]s we collect in the surrounding area.

But the caretakers are missing, and we have wildseeds in need of an anima infusion.

This is an absolute mess that must be corrected before the [[Winter Queen]] arrives!

I've already gathered a basket of animacones. Can you use them to infuse a few of the wildseeds?

I'll show you how it's done, but then I have to look for the missing caretakers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|80|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There should be four wildseeds in need of anima.

==Completion==
Fine work. We mustn't stop tending to the wildseeds that the Winter Queen has chosen to be saved.

Now, perhaps you can lend me a hand with another matter.

==Notes==
Next to [[Dreamweaver]] is an [[Animacone Basket]]. Pick it up:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Thank you, friend! These pools are anything but tranquil lately...}}

There are four wildseeds in the area:
{{Zone Map|zone=Ardenweald|notes=
{{Zone Map Note|63.5|41.5|Ping}}
{{Zone Map Note|62.2|40.1|Ping}}
{{Zone Map Note|63.9|43.0|Ping}}
{{Zone Map Note|65.6|43.3|Ping}}
}}

Dreamweaver's dialogue for the first three seeds:
#{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Wildseeds need caretakers to give them anima. Without it, the spirits inside can't be reborn.}}
#{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Since the drought started, there hasn't been enough anima to go around. We've had to make some... hard choices.}}
#{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Good, you finish up here. I'll look for the missing caretakers.}}

Once done with both quests, find Dreamweaver off to the west, getting a report form some [[Wildseed Tender]]s:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|The plants ate them? Not again...}}

==Progression==
{{Tranquil Pools}}

==Beta version==

;Description
We infuse wildseeds with animacones that we collect from the surrounding area.

But the wildseed tenders are missing, and we have drained wildseeds right out in the open.

This is an absolute mess that must be corrected before the Winter Queen arrives.

I need you to take these animacones and infuse a few of the wildseeds here with anima.

I'll walk you through a couple, then I have to go find the missing tenders.
