==Objectives==
Lure 30 gormlings to the wrangler in the [[Banks of Life]].
* Take the [[Gormling Lure]]
* Deliver gormlings to southern wrangler (30)

==Description==
Hope you've caught your breath.

The [[totem]] is now a big, tasty beacon to all the nearby [[gorm]]. They're going to want to eat it and you're going to be carrying it!

We need to rehome the smaller ones. If they stay here they're just going to get big and angry again. If you can drop off a few groups of them outside the Banks of Life we can make sure they find their way to more balanced feeding grounds.

Let [[Foreman Thorodir|Thorodir]] know when you're done. I will let him know the plan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|37|20|60}}
* 12,950 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
Get going! Don't lure them back here!

==Completion==
Fluttercatch always was a clever one. Well done.

==Notes==
First, click on the Gormling Lure. The player receives the Gormling Lure Totem buff and Gormlings Lured debuff. Approach [[Gormling Nibbler]] and stack it up to 30 by, then go to the [[Gormling Wrangler]].

==Progression==
