==Objectives==
Report your success to [[Droman Tashmur]] in [[Tirna Vaal]].

==Description==
To the tree, to the tree! It is time for us to return to the grove.

We have our [[anima]]. We have our forms. The Tall Tree needs the anima. The Tall Tree will be happy!

I will see you there!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Dreamthorn Handguards
|Grove Warden's Gauntlets
|Spirit Tender's Handwraps
|Starshroud Gloves
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
From acorns grow forests, from souls comes vital anima. Small though they be, on them our fates depend.

The forest sighs in gratitude.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Choofa|To the tree, to the tree! We'll all be safe at the tree.}}

Back to the road, then south to [[Tirna Vaal]]. As the party returns:
:{{text|say|Choofa|Over here! We're saved!}}
:{{text|say|Droman Tashmur|From brook to lake, waters return. Welcome home.}}

This concludes the "Spirit Glen" chapter of the [[Ardenweald storyline]]. [[Droman Tashmur]] previously started [[Dreamweaver (quest)]], which must also be completed to continue. Once both forks are complete, [[Lady Moonberry]] continues the campaign with [[Preparing for the Winter Queen]].

==Progression==

;Completion
In this time of drought, even the smallest contribution helps.

Small, boisterous, noisy... but still vital.

Thank you.
