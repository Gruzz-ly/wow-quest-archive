You can bring the supplies supplies to [[Groonoomcrooek]], [[Lady of the Falls]], [[Sorcha]], [[Elder Gwenna]], [[Elder Finnan]], or [[Gormsmith Cavina]] in [[Glitterfall Basin]]. Each provides a 30 minute buff that is part of the achievement [[A Bit of This, A Bit of That]].

;Groonooomcrooek
:All things grow to survive. Trees, forests, people; all require food, but not all require the same food.

:Sharing with me is a kindess. If you share with me, then I shall also share my boon with you.
:{{Gossip|I would like you to have the supplies}}
:Grants [[Tirnenn Resilience]], which gives you a 5% stacking damage resistance buff when you stand still, up to 25%.
:{{text|say|Groonoomcrooek|Wondrous. We shall all grow. I bless your limbs with some of the strength in mine. Run your roots deep into the hollows and none may penetrate your bark.}}

;Sorcha
:Supplies? For me? But the Lady...

:I will gladly accept this gift, friend. I have brought our war paints, and would be happy to offer them in exchange. They will bless you with the strength and swiftness of the hunt.
:{{Gossip|I would like you to have the supplies.}}
:Grants [[Vorkai War Paint]], which increases haste and damage by 10%.
:{{text|say|Sorcha|By the Queen... thank you! I will send these off at once. These are the markings of our greatest warriors. Their sigils will make you as fearsome as a vorkai!}}

;Lady of the Falls
:Ah, the supplies from the Growthworks! As the area is under my supervision, it is wise of you to bring them to me for safekeeping.

:I will have just the thing to life{{Sic}} your spirits and put the spring in your step if you give them to me.
:{{Gossip|I would like you to have the supplies.}}
:Grants [[Faerie Pomander]], which increases movement speed by 15 and healing for 1% of your health every 3 seconds for 30 seconds on a 1 minute cooldown.
:{{text|say|Lady of the Falls|I have enchanted this pomander with the wonderful scent of [[Tirna Eas]]. May it remind you of the refreshment and comfort you will always find here.}}

;Elder Gwenna
:Oh, look at all those supplies! I could make soulwebs for some time with those.

:In exchange, I could offer you something to deal with the hostility of the forest, allowing you to disengage or sneak up on an enemy as you see fit.

:Do we have a deal?
:{{Gossip|I would like you to have the supplies.}}
:Grants [[Slumberweb]], which causes your target to fall asleep for 10 seconds on a 2 minute cooldown.
:{{text|say|Elder Gwenna|Wonderful! Here, take this. I modified a soulweb to capture the wakefulness of a creature. Simply put, it should let you send them to sleep! I call it a... slumberweb!}}

;Elder Finnan
:Supplies from the workships, for me to distribute? Oh, this is my lucky day indeed!

:With all this luck, I might even be able to share some of it. Yes, yes. Give me the supplies and I'm sure some of my good luck will follow you!
:{{Gossip|I would like you to have the supplies.}}
:Grants [[Finnan's Luck]], which increases your chance to dodge attacks and your critical strike by 10%.
:{{text|say|Elder Finnan|Well, that seems pretty amazing to me! Now use it to protect Ardenweald.}}

;Gormsmith Cavina
:It's a good thing you're here. I'm running low on [[gorm]] to smith, if you catch my drift.

:Supplies, you say? Well, I won't turn them down. I could probably make something that would give you some temporary friends if you hand them over. What do you say?
:{{Gossip|I would like you to have the supplies.}}
:Grants [[Gorm Whisperer]], which has a chance to summon a gorm to aid you in combat.
:{{text|say|Gormsmith Cavina|Oh yeah, that's the stuff! Here, take this gorm shell. It's from a matriarch, and sometimes the little ones will come to help protect the wielder.}}
