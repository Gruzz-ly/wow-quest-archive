==Objectives==
Investigate the unknown area.
* Travel to the Unknown
* [[Scouring Dustlet]] slain (20)

==Description==
Come to pay old [[Marasmius]] a visit? I have a special task for you.

One of my shoots has found a strange place, a place even I've never seen before.

I'm not entirely sure what's in there or if it's even safe. But that's what my trusty mushroomancers are for!

What do you say, <name>? Up for an adventure? 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Marasmius]]

==Progress==
Keep your guard up. It could lead anywhere!

==Completion==
That was close. Those pests can quickly blast away whole chunks of Ardenweald if we aren't careful. We've got enough problems on our hands as it is!

==Notes==
Take the Mushroom to the Deep Unknown to see what variant Marasmius offers today.
:{{text|say|Marasmius|Pfah, dust elementals! If they keep this up they'll scour the whole place clean and the wildseeds will die!}}
