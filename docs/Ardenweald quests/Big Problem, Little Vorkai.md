==Objectives==
Slay Blighted with [[Hunt-Captain Korayn|Korayn]].
*[[Blighted]] slain (0/100%)

==Description==
[[Ara'lon]]'s report matches what I have seen. Too many enemies, and too few of the Wild Hunt to dispose of them on our own.

Fortunately, I feel strongly inclined to take matters into my own hands. And avenge my fallen [[hunter]]s.

Let us depart. We will show those monsters the fury of nature.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|80|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Ardenweald will endure.

==Completion==
We have slain so many, and yet more remain. We must get to the heart of this evil and tear it out.

If we don't, then soon it could spread all across Ardenweald.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Hunt-Captain Korayn|These vile creatures will know the fury of the Wild Hunt!}}

Eligible mobs are [[Blighted Brute]]s (15%) and [[Blighted Lurker]]s (3%).

While in the party, Korayn provides the player a bonus ability:
:{{Abilities|Hunter's Strike|Tell Korayn to charge and strike a Blighted Brute.|range=30|cd=12 sec|notes=Instant. Does ~30% of the brute's health in damage.|icon=ability_rogue_surpriseattack|id=330680}}

==Progression==
{{Glittering Falls}}

==Beta version==
{{Rfb-section}}
;Completion
We killed so many, and yet there are more. We must get to the heart of it, and tear it out.

Or else this taint will spread all across Ardenweald.
