==Objectives==
Bring [[Gertie Jr.]] to the [[Heart of the Forest]].

==Description==
It's clear that we may not be able to consistently supply [[Ardenweald]] with silk. But there is something that will help.

Take Gertie Jr. and the silk you collected from the other [[silkstrider]]s back to the Heart of the Forest. There, she will be safe, and perhaps grow up into a silkstrider as grand and beautiful as her mother!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you for this silk! But... I see you brought something extra as well.

This little silkstrider will be safe now. I swear it.

==Notes==
On accept, Gertie Jr. hops up on the player's back again until they turn in to Aithlyn back at the Heart of the Forest. On completion:
:{{Text|Say|Aithlyn|I will make sure this little silkstrider is well taken care of, for the future of Ardenweald. Perhaps you can come visit from time to time?}}

After the quest, Gertie Jr. moves to the interior of the Heart of the Forest.
