[[File:Storm's Rest.jpg|thumb|The [[Winter Queen]], [[Ysera]], [[Malfurion Stormrage]], and [[Tyrande Whisperwind]].]]

==Objectives==
Activate the Globes of Rebirth in the [[Grove of Awakening]].
* Reach Middle of Grove of Awakening
* Activate [[Globe of Rebirth|Globes of Rebirth]] (3)
* Convince the [[Winter Queen]]

==Description==
Let us go into the Grove of Awakening. The Winter Queen is the only one who can transfer this bond from [[Ysera]] to me. I have faith that she will agree. She aided Ysera in a time of desperate need, and now Ysera can help us in turn.

If the Winter Queen agrees, I expect that I will not able to remain awake for long. The weight of the bond will be heavy to bear.

In time, I hope that I may wake again and gaze upon the fully grown might of [[World Tree|the new tree]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I long to see the twisting green expanse of the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]] once again.

==Completion==
It has been done. [[Malfurion Stormrage|Malfurion]] will sleep here in my stead. And [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande]] will watch over her people as she has capably done for millennia before.

Now, we must ready ourselves. When I cross over into the Emerald Dream, there will be a brief window when you can join me.

Are you ready?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ysera|[[Somnikus]], return to [[Emerald Gardens|the gardens]] and inform [[Merithra|my daughter]]. Once I have reached the Dream there, we will open the way for the others.}}
:''Malfurion and Tyrande walk south.''
:{{text|say|Somnikus|I will await your return. Then [[Rymek]] will pay for what he's done.}}
:''Ysera follows Malfurion and Tyrande as Somnikus exits to the north.''

Follow them south into the center of the grove, where the Winter Queen is dressing down Ysera, Malfurion, and Tyrande:
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|To this realm are you bound, Child of Dreams.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|My Queen, the Emerald Dream and its ancient groves are under attack, and I must go to defend them.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|In my place, Malfurion Stormrage will stay and fulfill the bond that you used to save me.}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Will you accept me in exchange?}}

The Winter Queen has gossip here:
:The balance of [[life]] and [[death]] is to be guarded with great gravity.

Three Globes of Rebirth light up, so interact with them, then speak with the Winter Queen, who has different gossip for Night Fae and non-Night Fae:
;Night Fae
:An oath made must be kept. As a member of my court, you know the cost to save the Child of Dreams was high, drawing from my own weakened essence.

:Ardenweald may flourish now, but it did not, then. Why should I let her go, when so much was given?

;Others
:An oath made must be kept. It is my power that sustained the Child of Dreams when she was in deepest peril.

:Why should I break that bond?

:{{gossip|<Skip to the end.>}} ''(will do as warned!'')
:{{gossip|<Explain that [[The Sisters' Tear|the seed]] entrusted to Tyrande is in danger.>}}
::Ysera cannot yet leave this realm to help protect the growing seed. She is bonded to me.

::Only if there is another, one who also moves by the great cycle, and who is willing to trade their place for hers, may she go. Then they must bear the weight of the bond.

::{{gossip|<Point out that Malfurion Stormrage has volunteered to take Ysera's place in Ardenweald.>}}
:::Does he understand the import and gravity of this sacrifice?

:::That he may long sleep under the boughs of Ardenweald, away from his love and his people, until Ysera once more returns and renews this bond?

:::{{gossip|<Accept the Winter Queen's terms.>}}
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|Then your pledge is made.}}
:''Ysera briefly reverts to the blue soulshape form, which transfers over to Malfurion.''
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|Go with the blessings of the wilds.}}
:''Ysera moves to the center of the area, Tyrande and Malfurion walk away to the west for a private moment, and the Winter Queen moves to focus on Ysera.''

Should the player follow them, Malfurion and Tyrande have this to say when they reach their spot at {{co|42.8|63.1|Ardenweald}} west of the grove:
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Sleep, my love. Until the forest calls once more.}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Whatever comes, my love, remember: our bond is eternal.}}
:''Malfurion lies down and starts sleeping as Ardenweald magic is swirling around him. Tyrande kneels.''
