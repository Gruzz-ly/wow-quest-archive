==Notes==
The Mask of Bwonsamdi can be found at the [[Starlit Overlook]], fairly nearby where the player first arrives in Ardenweald. The player will be guided here by the main questline, allowing for this breadcrumb quest to be picked up now and completed later.

Players turn in the quest to another Mask just inside the entrance of the dungeon.
