==Objectives==
Perform the final acts!
* Place taken on stage
* [[Gloober|G'huun]] defeated
* [[Glimmerdust|Jaina]] defeated
* [[Astra|Azshara]] defeated
* [[Dreamweaver|N'Zoth]] defeated
* Await the [[Winter Queen|Queen]]'s Judgement

==Description==
Now for our finale! A thrilling performance of the most recent trials on Azathoth!

<Featherlight checks his notes.>

[[Azeroth]]. Whatever. It features an [[G'huun|artificial god]], a [[Jaina Proudmoore|powerful magic ice princess]], an [[Queen Azshara|infamous queen]], and an [[N'Zoth|eldritch abomination of unspeakable terror]]! Who doesn't love a good drama with a dash of existential horror?

You're back to playing yourself, so just... do whatever heroes are supposed to do!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Dreamlight Runestag]]
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well! That was exciting.

==Completion==
A fair enough performance! 

I think everyone's more acquainted with your world and the role you've played within it.

Next time, the set design will be a bit more... prepared. But for now...

<Moonberry nods at [[Ysera]].>

I think your friend wishes to have a word. Don't take too long. We still have to hold the final induction ceremony at the Heart of the Forest.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Featherlight|Another war? That's rough, friend.}}

Head back onstage:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|And so, the [[Battle for Azeroth]] had begun!}}
:{{text|say|Awool|Woo! Yeah! Wait... Which side are we cheering for?}}
:{{text|say|Choofa|I'm not sure. Does it matter?}}

On stage this time are [[Mi'kai]], as the Zandalari Captain {{title|Sailing into a Trap}}, [[Glimmerdust]], as [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]] {{title|A Magic Ice Princess}} on her flying ship, [[Astra]], as [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] {{title|An Infamous Queen}}, [[Senthii (sylvar)|Senthii]], as [[MOTHER|M.O.T.H.E.R]] {{title|A Constructed Researcher}} holding [[Gloober]] as [[G'huun]] {{title|An Artificial God}}, and [[Dreamweaver]], as [[N'Zoth]] {{title|An Eldrich Abomination}}, with some [[Stage Hand]]s behind him wielding red tentacles.

Stand at the marked location and start the play by using the bonus ability {{Abilities|Act 6, Begin!|id=321145|icon=achievement_nazmir_boss_ghuun}}:
:''Senthii runs forward, holding Gloober.''
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Deep in the jungles of [[Nazmir]], <name/the Champions of Azeroth> vanquished the Blood God, [[G'huun]]!}}
:{{text|say|Choofa|Er... Do we get "Blood Gods" or do they go elsewhere?}}
:{{text|say|Slanknen|I do believe everything is going to the [[Maw]], currently.}}

Interact with Gloober to "slay" him. He hops to the ground, runs circles around Senthii's feet, then runs off to the back of the stage.
:{{text|say|Senthii, as M.O.T.H.E.R|Old God unit G'huun exterm--Gloober, no!}}
:''Senthii runs after Gloober.''
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|With G'huun defeated, the Horde and Alliance returned to fighting each other!}}
:{{text|emote|Ysera shakes her head.}}

Go back to the spotlight and use {{Abilities|Act 7, Begin!|id=321122|icon=achievement_boss_zuldazar_jaina}}. Glimmerdust flies out over the front of the stage on her ship, and Mi'kai runs up to face her. You're afflicted by {{Abilities|Blizzard|id=322685|icon=spell_frost_icestorm}} and {{Abilities|Chilled|id=322686|icon=spell_frost_wisp}}, then {{Abilities|Ice Block|id=322683|icon=spell_frost_frost}}.
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|To bring a swift end to the war, the Alliance invaded [[Dazar'alor]] and killed [[King Rastakhan]]!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|The Horde's ships pursued the Alliance fleet, but were blockaded by Lord Admiral [[Jaina Proudmoore]]!}}
:{{text|say|Mi'kai, As The Zandalari Captain|Hey, mon! Horde vessels on de horizon, mon! You have nowhere left to run, ice witch mon!}}
:{{text|say|Glimmerdust, As Jaina|You really think I've been running, captain?}}
:{{text|say|Glimmerdust, As Jaina|I lured you into open waters. Because out here, you have no hope of escape!}}
:{{text|say|Glimmerdust, As Jaina|Muwahahahahaha!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Glimmerdust, Jaina didn't kill her pursuers.}}
:{{text|yell|Glimmerdust, As Jaina|Oh, come on! Really?!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Really. Jaina didn't die, either.}}
:{{text|say|Glimmerdust, As Jaina|Ugh... fine.}}
:{{text|say|Glimmerdust, As Jaina|I am defeated. Yay.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Ahem. Moving along...}}

The spotlight offers {{Abilities|Finale, Begin!|id=314408|icon=achievement_boss_azshara}}:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Far under the sea, <name/the Champions of Azeroth> fought the imperious [[Queen Azshara]].}}
:{{text|yell|Astra, As Azshara|Bow before your queen!}}

There's actual combat for this act. Soak the pink orbs and don't stand in purple, but nuke her as normal.
:{{text|yell|Astra, As Azshara|Stand still! But keep moving!}}
:{{text|yell|Astra, As Azshara|Run right! But go left!}}
:{{text|yell|Astra, As Azshara|Bring me more wine! But stay where you are!}}
:{{text|yell|Astra, As Azshara|I am far too perfect and beautiful to be defeated!}}

Finish her off:
:{{text|say|Astra, As Azshara|You ill-mannered and unfashionable fools will get what's coming to you...}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|The vainglorious queen was dethroned... But it was all part of [[N'Zoth]]'s nefarious plan!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Freed from his prison, the Old God sought to remake the world in his insane image!}}

Dreamweaver and the Stage Hands take the stage. Take out the adds first, then attack N'zoth.
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|And thus, the Corruptor was defeated! <Name/The Champions of Azeroth> had prevailed once more!}}

Return to the light and use {{Abilities|Awaiting the Queen's Judgement|id=321587|icon=spell_holy_divinepurpose}}.
:''The audience turn as one to face the [[Winter Queen]].''
:{{text|emote|The Winter Queen rises from her seat.}}
:{{text|emote|The fae await her judgment with breathless anticipation...}}
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|An excellent performance.}}
:{{text|say|Audience Member|WOOOOO!}}
:{{text|say|Audience Member|YAY! YAAAAAAAY! <Name>!}}
:{{text|say|Audience Member|YAY!}}
:{{text|say|Audience Member|<Name>! <Name>! <Name>!}}
:{{text|say|Choofa|That was fun!}}
:{{text|say|Droman Aliothe|I liked the part where they beat the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].}}
:{{text|say|Awool|I'm still not clear on how that [[Sargeras]] guy got a sword that big.}}
:{{text|say|Slanknen|I'm still unclear how their world could possibly still exist with a sword in it.}}
:{{text|say|Choofa|Well I once met someone whose world was a ring, so is it that weird?}}
:{{text|say|Slanknen|...Really.}}
:{{text|say|Choofa|Yeah! Usually appears as a big cat thing... If they're still here. I haven't seen anyone from that grove in awhile.}}
:{{text|say|Choofa|But that's okay. <Name> will help us get Ardenweald back on track! I just know it!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|I'm sure you and Ysera have a lot to talk about.}}

Ysera starts the next quest, [[For Queen and Grove!]].
