==Objectives==
Recover 25 animacones from the [[Possessed]].
* [[Animacone (Recovering the Animacones)]] (25)

==Description==
The grove's droman is wearing one of the masks. I fear he's going to drain all of the [[anima]] from the grove's heart!

That anima is meant for the forest's other groves. If we lose it... then Heartwood Grove would have been lost for nothing...

We'll carve a path to the Shrouded Mire to find the droman before it's too late.

Many of these masked fae have stolen Heartwood Grove's animacones. We must recover them along the way. 

In this drought, every bit of anima is precious.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|80|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We can't let the possessed take anything else from us.

==Completion==
So many animacones lost... at least we were able to recover these.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests and kill a path through the [[Heartwood Grove]] to free the NPCs ad loot the Animacones.

==Progression==
{{Waning Grove}}

;Description
The grove's droman was possessed by these masks. I fear he's going to drain all the [[anima]] from the grove's heart!

Every grove has a heart that is used to supply it with anima. In this drought, losing a heart would be...

I'd prefer not to think about it.

We'll carve a path to the [[Shrouded Mire]] to find the droman and the heart of the grove.

Many of these possessed have stolen [[Heartwood Grove]]'s animacones.

We must recover them along the way. Every bit of anima counts in this drought.
