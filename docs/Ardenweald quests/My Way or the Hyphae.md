==Description==
<An old, booming voice fills your mind.>

Hmph. More are coming.

I would rather not lose more of myself, and I don't want you to think I'm not appreciative of the work you and [[Cortinarius|Cort]] here have done.

How about you take a ride on the rings and give those oafs a good thrashing? We'll teach them not to mess with Marasmius and his fae rings!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Marasmius]]

==Progress==
Oh, this is going to be good. I can feel it in my toadstools.

==Completion==
Hah! I haven't felt that young in ages!
