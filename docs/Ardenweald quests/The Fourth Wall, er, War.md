==Notes==
[[File:The player as Sargeras.jpg|thumb|Wielding a very large sword]]

On accept:
:{{text|say|Featherlight|Help them set the stage. Quickly, now!}}

On stage, interact with the the Azeroth prop behind the wall to pick it up. Your movement speed is slowed by the {{Abilities|Weight of the World|id=313449|icon=achievement_worldevent_childrensweek}}. Walk forward and place it at the marked spot at stage center, then plant the Teldrassil banner stage left:
:{{text|say|Featherlight|Costume change! Get backstage!}}

Speak with [[Satinstitch]]:
:It's been short notice but I have something which might work well enough.
:Mind the flammable bits of the stage.
:{{gossip|Give me my costume, please}}
:{{text|say|Featherlight|Good, now hit your mark!}}

[[File:Azeroth impaled.jpg|thumb|Azeroth, impaled, though not quite in Silithus]]

You are now {{Abilities|Portraying Sargeras|id=313458|icon=spell_shadow_curseofsargeras}}: You have flaming horns and wings and are holding a wooden replica of the [[Sword of Sargeras]]. Get to the marked location and use the bonus ability {{Abilities|Stab the World|id=313536|icon=ability_backstab}}.
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|But as the titans were imprisoning Sargeras, he plunged his sword into the heart of Azeroth!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Fortunately, he didn't hit any major population centers.}}
:{{text|say|Featherlight|Next costume!}}
:{{text|yell|[[Ysera]]|This cannot be...}}
:{{text|say|[[Awool]]|Wait, so there is a giant sword stuck in <name>'s world? How does that work?}}
:{{text|say|[[Choofa]]|It kinda goes in like "Shunk"?}}
:{{text|say|[[Slanknen]]|I was an environmental protector in life! You can't just stab a planet without serious repercussions to, well, everything!}}
:{{text|say|Choofa|Good point. How would you even make a sword that big anyway? Transmute another world?}}
:{{text|say|Awool|No idea. I don't think I want to meet this Sargeras guy.}}

Return to Satinstitch backstage:
:I could have made the likeness better if I'd had more time. This shall have to do!
:{{gossip|Give me my costume, please}}

[[File:Sylvanas and Tyrande.jpg|thumb|Sylvanas and Tyrande]]
[[File:Teldrassil burning.jpg|thumb|Teldrassil burning]]

You are now {{Abilities|Portraying Nathanos|id=313557|icon=ability_rogue_disguise}}. Despite Satinstitch's worry, you appear exactly like Nathanos. Head back on stage, where [[Astra]], as [[Sylvanas]] {{title|A Warchief with Questionable Motives}} faces off against [[Mi'kai]], as [[Tyrande]] {{title|A Fierce Warrior-Princess}}:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Not long after, Sylvanas Windrunner besieged the night elf home of Teldrassil!}}
:{{text|say|Astra, As Sylvanas|Lay siege to the World Tree!}}
:{{text|emote|Ysera leans forward.}}
:{{text|say|Mi'kai, As Tyrande|You cannot kill hope!}}
:{{text|say|Astra, As Sylvanas|Can't I? Well then, I'll just kill the tree!}}
:{{text|yell|Astra, As Sylvanas|BURN IT!!!}}
:{{text|emote|Ysera stares aghast.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|And so, Teldrassil was consumed by the flames of war!}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|No... that... that was only a nightmare!}}
:{{text|say|Choofa|Oh no! All those souls!}}
:{{text|say|Slanknen|Indeed, Choofa. This is a terrible tragedy.}}
:{{text|say|Awool|Wait... They aren't here! I'd have noticed a big group like that!}}
:{{text|say|Awool|... Oh...}}
:{{text|emote|Ysera weeps.}}

Head to the Teldrassil banner and use the bonus ability {{Abilities|Burning Teldrassil|id=313558|icon=inv_torch_lit}}, then head backstage once more and speak with [[Rickrack]]:
:The costume you are wearing next is a character named [[Reverence]].
:I wanted to go for something avant-garde! Material. Tactile. Corporeal.
:Something you can feel. Something that allows you to physically inhabit the character...
:{{gossip|Give me my costume, please}}

[[File:Reverence costume.jpg|thumb|Reverence, not quite living up to [[Reverence|the namesake]]]]
[[File:Reverence costume 2.jpg|thumb|A slightly higher-fidelity costume of Reverence]]

You become a {{Abilities|Pedestrian Equestrian|id=313591|icon=inv_misc_horsecostume_front}}; you're wearing the front half of a mediocre horse costume.
:{{text|say|Rickrack|HA! My greatest work yet!}}
:{{text|say|Satinstitch|It's a piece of work, all right.}}

Speak with Satinstitch:
:An intriguing idea, but I think this is a bit too avant-garde for this production.
:We just need to change a little bit of this.
:<Satinstitch gestures to all of you.>
:Now, hold still!
:{{gossip|<You hold still.>}}

You're now {{Abilities|A Noble Steed|id=313715|icon=spell_nature_swiftness}} instead, taking the form of a [[unicorn]]. Windy, as Anduin, appears on your back.
:{{text|say|Windy, As Anduin|Forward ho, my noble steed!}}

[[File:Adorable siege engines.jpg|thumb|Adorable siege engines]]
Head back on stage as some downright ''adorable'' siege weapons are lined up, ready for a trampling.
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|The boy king of Stormwind assailed the undead city of Lordaeron.}}
:{{text|say|Astra, As Sylvanas|You are a terrible leader, King Wrynn!}}
:{{text|say|Windy, As Anduin|Well, you're a terrible person, Warchief!}}
:{{text|say|Astra, As Sylvanas|How dare you!}}

Run over fifteen of them:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|But before he could capture Sylvanas, she blighted the land and made her escape!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|This made everyone very unhappy.}}

Head backstage and speak with Satinstitch again:
:And now back to your usual... outfit for the next act.
:{{gossip|Please remove my costume.}}

[[File:The world's open woons.jpg|thumb|"Woonz" with sparklers to represent [[:Azerite]]]]

Head back onstage, where five [[Wound]] objects are onstage, alongside [[Niya]], as [[Magni]] {{title|A Diamond Dwarf}}.
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Then a diamond dwarf reminded everyone about the giant sword.}}
:{{text|say|Niya, As Magni|Ach! Champions! The world is bleedin'! Ye need tae heal her woonz!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|As it turned out, Azeroth's blood held incredible power. It erupted from the earth for anyone to claim!}}
:{{text|say|Choofa|Wait, the world was bleeding? Worlds bleed?}}

Heal the "woonz," removing the sparklers on top of them. Then head backstage again to turn in.
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Coveting this aptly-named "[[:Azerite]]," the Alliance and Horde sounded the horns of war! Again!}}
:{{text|say|Choofa|But they were just in a war!}}
:{{text|emote|Ysera sighs in disappointment.}}
