==Notes==
;On approach
:{{text|say|Choofa|Now where'd Rury run off to...?}}

;On accept
:{{text|say|Choofa|Oh, they're going to be so upset if they miss the party because they weren't here!}}

;Upon talking to Awool
:I'll be ready to fight for Ardenweald again soon! I just need to catch a little rest. Get my strenght{{sic}} back up! Then it's look out - here comes Awool!
:{{Gossip|Ask Choofa's friend to come to the party.}}
:{{text|say|Awool|Oh! A party is just what I need to get my strength back. Then I'll be back in the fight!}}
:{{text|say|Choofa|Awool! did you hear? We are invited to a party!}}
:{{text|say|Awool|Yes! This is so exciting. I think a rest is just what I need so I am ready to get back into the battle to defend Ardenweald.}}
:{{text|say|Choofa|You are so fierce and brave, Awool. I am proud of you.}}

;Upon talking to Rury
:It's all such a bother. Can you keep it down so I can nap? Wake me when the fuss is over.
:{{Gossip|Ask Choofa's friend to come to the party.}}
:{{text|say|Rury|Yes. When Choofa goes, I will go. After my nap.}}

;Upon approaching Slanknen
:{{text|yell|Slanknen|Oh fuss and bother. Help! Is there anyone that can hear me?}}
:Oh dear. Oh my. Something strange is happening with the water.
:{{Gossip|Ask Choofa's friend to come to the party.}}
:{{text|say|Slanknen|I'd rather be at a party with my friends, but I'm stuck. The water has been enchanted to prevent me crossing.}}
:{{Gossip|<Pick up Slanknen.>}}
:{{text|say|Slanknen|It must be those nasty spriggans again. The water didn't bother you, not even those globules. Maybe if you carry me so I don't get wet?}}

;Falling into the water with Slanknen
*{{text|say|Slanknen|What a mess. An otter out of water. Hrmph. Back onto your head I suppose?}}
*{{text|say|Slanknen|I never thought I'd be so eager to stay dry. I love water! Once more, I guess?}}
*{{text|say|Slanknen|I know I look ridiculous up there, but it's the only way to make it. Again?}}
*{{text|say|Slanknen|Those nasty spriggans! Pick me up. Let's try again!}}
*{{text|say|Slanknen|Oh no! Up I go again, I suppose.}}

Carry him to Slanken's Sunning Spot.

;After carrying Slanken
:{{text|say|Slanknen|Oh thank you, thank you for making me safe again. Those tricksy spriggan are such troublemakers!}}

;On turn-in
:{{text|say|Choofa|Going to a party with friends! There's nothing better.}}

;Gossip upon completion at 'Stranger' reputation level
:Safe, safe! We will be safe here. 
:Thank you, Thank you, for saving us!
