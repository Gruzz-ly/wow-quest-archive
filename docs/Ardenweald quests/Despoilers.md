==Objectives==
Slay Witherscorn [[Drust]] and Blighted, and vanquish Skell the Despoiler.
* [[Witherscorn]] or [[Blighted]] slain (12)
* [[Skell the Despoiler]] slain {{co|61.2|49.5|Ardenweald}}

==Description==
Your efforts at [[Tirna Noch]] have enraged the Drust. 

Those creatures of decay and destruction swell at our borders, and already they pierce our defenses.

Now we see their real faces, and know the true nature of our foe.

Strike at them. It will buy us time for you to conduct Dreamweaver's ritual.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|50|54|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It seems we have made some powerful enemies.

==Completion==
This is just the beginning of their attack. But it is still a heavy blow dealt to them. Thank you.

==Notes==
Pick up Dreamweaver's quests before heading out.

Eligible generic mobs are [[Blighted Invader]]s, [[Blighted Subduer]]s, [[Witherscorn Defiler]]s, and [[Witherscorn Vanguard]]s.

Down to the south is the first Dreamshrine. Interact with it and a few small [[Disturbed Nightmare]]s pop out:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|I've seen spirits have nightmares before, but nothing like this. The trauma this one must have been through...}}

Far to the northwest is the second Dreamshrine. Interact with it and a large Disturbed Nightmare pops out:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Well, it's pretty clear that this spirit won't dream peacefully until we confront what haunts it.}}

To the northeast, find [[Skell the Despoiler]]. Aggro her:
:{{text|say|Skell the Despoiler|Your anima will be mine!}}

Defeat her:
:{{text|say|Skell the Despoiler|Thros... beckons...}}

Once all objectives are done, return to Dreamweaver and interact with the Wildseed.
