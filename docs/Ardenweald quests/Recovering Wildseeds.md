==Objectives==
Recover 6 Drained [[wildseed]]s in the [[Heartwood Grove]].
* [[Drained Wildseed]] (6)
*Find Niya further in Heartwood Grove.

==Description==
One of my tasks in Heartwood Grove was to tend to the wildseeds.

Some were chosen to be brought back to [[Tirna Vaal]]. But now the masked fae are draining the anima from them!

We need to save the ones that remain. I beg of you, recover any surviving wildseeds you can find.

The spirits within them were chosen to be reborn. I won't let them wither away!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|80|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We need to split up and rescue as many wildseeds as we can.

==Completion==
You found more wildseeds! They're so weak... I can't stand to see them like this.

We need to finish this and bring them to Tirna Vaal as soon as possible.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Niya|I'll look for survivors. Meet me further into the grove.}}

Drained Wildseeds litter the area and posessed mobs are frequent.

On complete of all three:
:{{text|say|Niya|Korenth... we'll take back the heart of the grove. I swear it.}}

==Progression==
{{Waning Grove}}

==Beta version==

;Description
Some were chosen to be brought back to [[Tirna Vaal]].

But now these monsters have taken over and intend to drain the [[anima]] from the wildseeds!

Please, I need you to recover some of the wildseeds that are left. I'll get the others.

We can't let the spirits that were given a chance to survive die to these monsters.

;Progress
I'll do my part to get some of the wildseeds. You get the others
