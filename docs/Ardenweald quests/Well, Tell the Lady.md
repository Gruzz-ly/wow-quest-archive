Report to the [[Lady of the Falls]] in [[Glitterfall Basin]].

That's that, I'd say. The [[Banks of Life|Banks]] are largely safe now, thanks to you. We can handle the rest of the cleanup on our own now.

The Lady of the Falls will want to hear of your success here. Why not go tell her the good news?

Ah, that is wonderful news. Thank you for your assistance.
