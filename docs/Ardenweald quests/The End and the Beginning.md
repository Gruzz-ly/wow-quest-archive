==Notes==
;Speak to Conservator Starry Night
The [[Winter Queen]] herself teaching you the ways of the Wildseed is an honor indeed.

;Speak to the Winter Queen
:All things end.

:Yet, in the end, we find a new beginning. This is the cycle of Nature. 

:The spirits in my groves are vital to the cycle. Without them, Nature itself begins to die in the mortal realm. Each loss is a tragedy. Every spirit saved, a triumph.

:This spirit is one you helped save from a dying grove and the madness of the [[Drust]]. Today, she awakens from her long slumber and returns to her world. With your help we have upheld our sacred charge.

:{{Gossip|I am ready to begin the ceremony.}}

:''A cutscene plays, showing the ritual of a cloud serpent emerging from a widlseed in the presence of gathered fae.''

;Speaking to the Winter Queen again
:With your aid, [[Ardenweald]] will continue to maintain the cycle.

:I place my Conservatory in your care.

:Speak with [[Warden Casad]]. They will give your further instruction.

;Speak to Conservator Starry Night again
:Warden Casad awaits you in the Queen's Conservatory! They are eager to get started with you.

:Just step into the ring of mushrooms beside me to travel to the Conservatory.
