==Objectives==
Collect Stolen Mementos from slain enemies in [[Tirna Noch]].
* [[Stolen Memento]] (10)

==Description==
At [[Heartwood Grove]], I heard tales about the fall of Tirna Noch. I never thought that I would see it with my own eyes.

It brings me great sadness. And I wonder... if this is the fate that awaits my old grove as well.

I can't believe that everything that was once here is truly gone. 

Perhaps there are still some mementos that can be recovered. Something to remember the fallen.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|3|80}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is this what lies in store for Heartwood Grove? For my old home?

==Completion==
Thank you.

I know these are just objects, but they mean so much. Sometimes just holding a piece of one's past can be a comfort.

It means not everything is lost.

==Notes==
Pick up all three quests and [[Ara'lon]] and [[Niya]] join the party. Kill hostiles for [[Stolen Mementos]], loot [[Fae Basket]]s for [[Plundered Anima]], and interact with the three marked locations to scout out more anima reserves.
