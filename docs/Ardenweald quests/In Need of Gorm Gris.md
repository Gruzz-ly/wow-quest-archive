==Objectives==
Seek out [[Master Sha'lor]] by the [[Tranquil Pools]].

==Description==
Our neighboring grove at [[Glitterfall Basin]] has sent out a desperate plea for [[gorm]] gris.

It may have humble origins, but it is an important ingredient for our artisans and crafters. As this drought goes on, it has become increasingly difficult to collect.
I would like to help them out, with the resources that we are able to spare.

Please, find Master Sha'lor out by the Tranquil Pools, where he keeps our little gormling population.

Ask him for more gorm gris.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|48|5}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Kota has asked for gorm gris?

<Master Sha'lor beams with excitement.>

I would be happy to oblige her request! Come, let me show you how this works.
