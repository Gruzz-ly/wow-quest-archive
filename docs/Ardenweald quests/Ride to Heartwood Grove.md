On accept:
:{{text|say|Droman Tashmur|Ride the stag. Hasten to Heartwood Grove. Dark clouds gather.}}

Find the [[Riding Stag]] just to the northwest. Hop on and it runs in the opposite direction of the evacuees still streaming downhill:
:{{text|say|[[Heartwood Grove Evacuee]]|Please help Niya!}}
:{{text|say|Heartwood Grove Evacuee|Keep running!}}
:{{text|say|Heartwood Grove Evacuee|Niya is still back there!}}

As the stag crosses the bridge to [[Heartwood Grove]], [[Niya]] is facing down a [[Possessed Vorkai]]:
:{{text|say|Possessed Vorkai|Join us, Niya. Don the mask and serve the masters!}}
:{{text|say|Niya|Never! Your masters will answer for what they've done!}}
:{{text|say|Niya|Who are--wait, you're the one helped [[Derawyn]] and [[Te'zan]]....}}
:{{text|say|Niya|These masked fae suddenly attacked the grove. Please, we have to drive them back!}}

;Description
The denizens of [[Ardenweald]] are no strangers to conflict.

But to see such a ripple of [[sylvar]] flee from their grove is of great concern.

[[Lady Moonberry]] makes haste to request the [[Winter Queen]] come at once.

You must move quickly to investigate Heartwood Grove. One of our stags shall deliver you there with utmost speed.
