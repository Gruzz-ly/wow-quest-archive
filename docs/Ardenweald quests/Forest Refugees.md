==Objectives==
Bring Hibernal Hollow supplies to [[Flwngyrr]] in the [[Heart of the Forest]].
* [[Hibernal Hollow Supplies]] (provided)

==Description==
Some of those displaced by the fallen groves have made a home for themselves at the base of the Heart of the Forest.

[[Hibernal Hollow]] is fortunate. We have supplies, when they may not.

If you would, bring these to Flwngyrr. They care for the refugees there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|50|40}}
* 1,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Many cries call in the night. Many creatures seek shelter.

This is a refreshing breeze.

==Notes==
This is an optional breadcrumb to get to the Heart of the Forest. [[Flwngyrr]] also starts [[Tirna Scithe: A Warning Silence]].

==Patch changes==
