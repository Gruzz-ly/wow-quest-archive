==Objectives==
Help Cortanius defend Marasmius.
* Speak with [[Cortinarius]]
* Defend [[Marasmius]]

==Description==
Behold, Marasmius!

This is his home, his heart. Every [[mushroom]] in [[Ardenweald]], maybe even all of the [[Shadowlands]], stems from here. And the masked fae want to take him for their own purposes. As chief mushroomancer, I cannot abide this.

Our foes may look mindless, but they are clever. They will have tracked my position by now.

I shall make my final stand here, and hope that Marasmius is strong enough to lend his aid.

Will you stand with me, <class>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 11,800 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Marasmius]]

==Completion==
<About time you showed up! Good thing I took care of all those young ones, eh?>

==Notes==
;Speak to Cortinarius
:They will begin their assault at any moment! I hope you are prepared.
