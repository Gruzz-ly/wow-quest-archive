==Description==
Bad [[spriggan]]s! Bad! They take our [[anima]]. We lose our forms! And one is worst of all.

Mizik! He tells the others what to do. And he rides a [[gorm]]! Big, nasty gorm!

Get him. Get him!

You will receive:
* {{cost|24|57}}

Gone! The bad spriggan is gone! Spirit Glen will be ours again.

Now to leave. We have to leave.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Choofa|Get him, get him! The one that rides the gorm!}}

Look for the [[Enthralled Gorm]] and defeat it. [[Mizik the Haughty]] hops off. Defeat the spriggan too.
:{{text|say|Mizik the Haughty|But... the Ancient One... promised...}}
