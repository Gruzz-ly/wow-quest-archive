==Objectives==
Collect 3 Culexwood Branches.
* [[Culexwood Branch]] (3)
* [[Enchanted Pipes]] (provided)

==Description==
These [[gorm]] have gone out of control! We need to stop them.

I have a plan, but I cannot do it on my own. We lure the gormlings to the [[Banks of Life]] by using special [[totem]]s that are drained of their [[anima]]. If you can retrieve the [[Lumber|wood]] required for the totem, I can prepare the ritual.

Take these pipes. Find the [[Culex]] trees growing on the banks and play a song for them. You will recognize them by their pale green leaves. The wood must be given freely for the ritual to work.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|37|20|60}}
* 12,950 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
We need that lure for my clever plan. It's very clever, you're going to love it.

==Completion==
Good. This should do it!

==Notes==
Use the quest item on [[Culex Tree]]s.
