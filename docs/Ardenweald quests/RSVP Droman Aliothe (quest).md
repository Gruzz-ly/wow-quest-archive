==Objectives==
Investigate the offers of the Brokers to see whether a remnant of Aliothe's world may be found.
* [[Preserved Berries]]

==Description==
I serve my Queen and abide by my oath to guard this hollow and tend the spirits it encloses.

Once, I might have enjoyed your Prince's party, but I am no longer suited to revelry.

My world was destroyed long ago, and perhaps I too have lost some of the joy I felt as its wild guardian. I would dearly like a reminder of my old home.

I have heard those strange traders, the brokers, have unusual objects from other worlds.

Perhaps they have something from mine?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Droman Aliothe]]

==Progress==
Have you found a reminder of my home for me?

==Completion==
That scent! I would know it anywhere. My den was surrounded by this plant! Thank you. I will keep this token close to me to remember the joyous times.
