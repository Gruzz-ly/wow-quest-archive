==Objectives==
Attune the filled heart of the tree at the shrines in the [[Dreamshrine Basin]].
* South Dreamshrine attuned {{co|61.2|56.7|Ardenweald}}
* North Dreamshrine attuned {{co|57.8|50.0|Ardenweald}}
* Heart Bound to [[Dreamer's Wildseed]] {{co|60.0|52.9|Ardenweald}}

==Description==
Now that we have the [[anima]] we need, we must attune the heart of [[Tirna Noch]] to the shrines of [[Hibernal Hollow]]. 

Then we can bring the [[wildseed]]'s nightmares into the light and dispel them.

Take the heart to the shrines just outside of Hibernal Hollow, in the [[Dreamshrine]] basin. Then bring the heart back to the wildseed to complete the preparations for the ritual.

But be careful. Minions of the [[Drust]] seem to be amassing near the grove.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The spirit dreams.

==Completion==
You're a natural at this. Now we can bring the spirit's nightmares into the open and deal with them directly.

If we succeed, she will be so much more at peace.

==Notes==
On accept, players gain a bonus ability:
:{{Abilities|Anima Expulsion|range=100|cd=20 sec|Expel anima from the Heart, damaging all enemies within 15 yards for x Nature damage.|id=329131|icon=spell_animaardenweald_nova}}

Pick up both quests (and [[Despoilers]]) before heading out.

Down to the south is the first [[Unattuned Dreamshrine]]. Interact with it, and it transforms into [[Dreamer's Vision]] and a few small [[Disturbed Nightmare]]s pop out:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|I've seen spirits have nightmares before, but nothing like this. The trauma this one must have been through...}}

Far to the northwest is the second Dreamshrine. Interact with it and a large Disturbed Nightmare pops out:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Well, it's pretty clear that this spirit won't dream peacefully until we confront what haunts it.}}

Once all objectives are done, return to Dreamweaver and interact with the Wildseed.
:{{Text|say|Dreamweaver|Good. All that's left is to begin the ritual.}}

;Dreamweaver dialogue
{{Gossip|Tell me about the spirit in the wildseed.}}

:Within [[Young Wildseed|this wildseed]] rests a powerful agent of nature. When they died, their spirit was brought directly to Ardenweald.

:It is our honor to care for them as they dream and prepare for rebirth on their world.

:The interesting thing is, though... they seem to know you. Isn't that something?

{{Gossip|Tell me more about the ritual.}}
:This ritual is meant to help restless spirits contend with the troubles that keep them from recovering their strength.

:I have a sense that this spirit, the one so attached to you, has been through a great trial in their life. I hope that we can bring her back into a peaceful slumber.
