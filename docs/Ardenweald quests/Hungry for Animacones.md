==Objectives==
Recover 25 Animacones from [[Gobbling Blossom]]s.
* [[Animacone (Hungry for Animacones)]] (25)
*Meet Dreamweaver outside of Tirna Vaal.

==Description==
I have to apologize for the state of the [[Tranquil Pools]]. Normally, it's quite peaceful here.

The [[wildseed]] tenders tell me that the plants you see walking around have eaten all the animacones intended for use in [[Tirna Vaal]].

Could you rip the animacones out of those plants?

We have wildseeds that are in need of that anima.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|80|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found the animacones? They're still useful, even if they're a little slimy. 

Trust me, the spirits don't mind as long as they get their anima.

==Completion==
The animacones! In this time of drought, we have to scrounge for every bit of anima we can get. Thank you.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Use my dagger to open the plants and free the others. We'll meet you in Tirna Vaal.}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Oh, and thank you again! Whatever world you're from, they're lucky to have you.}}

Each blossom will drop 2-3 Animacones.

==Progression==

;Description
I have to apologize for the state the [[Tranquil Pools]] are in. Normally there's only a few monsters in the area.

The [[wildseed]] tenders tell me that the gobblers have eaten all the animacones intended for use in [[Tirna Vaal]].

Could you go ahead and rip the animacones out of those gobblers?

We have [[Ghost|spirits]] that are in need of more [[anima]] within Tirna Vaal.

;Completion
The animacones! Look at how many there are... and they're brimming with anima.

We need to get these animacones to one special spirit within Tirna Vaal as soon as possible.
