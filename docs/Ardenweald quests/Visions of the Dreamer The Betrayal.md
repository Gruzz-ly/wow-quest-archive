==Objectives==
Grapple with the Dreamer's vision of a great betrayal.

If you leave the Vision, interact with a Dreamer's Vision portal in [[Dreamshrine Basin]] to enter again.
* Enter the [[Dreamer's Vision]] {{co|57.8|50.1|Ardenweald}}
* [[Worldbreaker (Ardenweald)|Worldbreaker]] defeated {{co|58.6|49.6|Ardenweald}}

==Description==
I sense that in the spirit's vision, she struggles with the memory of a betrayal that is truly profound. 

Someone as close to her as a [[Deathwing|brother]], turned to an enemy.

Go to the second Dreamshrine in the Basin, and help vanquish the pain of this nightmare.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you seen what dreams have come?

==Completion==
To have an old friend turn against you, in the most terrible way. How very painful. 

But we are so close now, to soothing the spirit within the wildseed.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests before heading out.

Head to either portal, to the south or to the north. The objective for this quest is at the north, but both quests are in the same phase, regardless of which portal was entered.

At the north portal, the [[Worldbreaker (Ardenweald)|Worldbreaker]] is fighting a [[Sister (Ardenweald)|Sister]] (Alexstrasza) and two [[Friend (Ardenweald)|Friends]] (Kalecgos and Nozdormu). Join in.

Defeat it:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|A dear friend's betrayal... a pain that never fades...}}

No need to exit and head to the southern portal for [[Visions of the Dreamer: Origins]]. Instead, head east from the Worldbreaker past the Consort to see that quest's objectives.

Once both quest objectives are done, simply run back to [[Dreamweaver]].

The next requires level 58, so do some side-questing if not already at that level.
