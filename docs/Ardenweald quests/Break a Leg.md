==Description==
The show is about to begin! You... that's what you're going to wear? Well, I suppose it works.

For your grand introduction, we will re-enact recent victories and events that took place on [[Azzinoth]]. Er, [[Azeroth]]. That's where you're from, right?

The Starlight Company has graciously volunteered to assist us in this production. We've recruited some special guests as well!

Don't worry about the script. This is your story, after all!

Just try not to get too much blood on stage. It's hard to clean.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well, that wasn't... terrible.

==Completion==
Not bad! Not great, but not bad. Quickly now, we'll need to help set the stage for the next act!

==Notes==
On accept, the player gains the title "<Name>, As Themselves":
:{{text|say|Featherlight|Places, everyone!}}

Head back onstage:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|For the third time, the Burning Legion descended upon Azeroth.}}
:{{text|emote|Ysera looks concerned.}}
:{{text|yell|Droman Aliothe|DEATH TO THE LEGION!!!}}
:{{text|yell|Audience Member|BOO! BOOOOO!}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Moonberry|But hope yet remained! Behold! <name>!}}
:{{text|yell|Audience Member|Woohoo! Yay!!}}
:{{text|yell|Choofa|Hey I know them! Hi, <name>!!!}}

On stage are [[Lady Moonberry]], as the narrator, [[Windy]], as [[Illidan]] {{title|The Betrayer}}, [[Niya]], as [[Xavius]] {{title|Some Kind of Evil Sylvar}}, [[Senthii (sylvar)|Senthii]], as [[Gul'dan (alternate universe)|Gul'dan]] {{title|From an Alternate Timeline}}, [[Glimmerdust]], as [[Kil'jaeden]] {{title|of The Burning Legion}}, and [[Mi'kai]], as [[Argus|Argus, the Unmaker]] {{title|A Corrupted World Soul}}.

Stand in the spotlight and use the bonus ability '''Begin Act 1, Xavius''':
:{{text|yell|Niya, As Xavius|I am Xavius...}}
:{{text|say|Niya, As Xavius|Line?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Lord of Nightmares!}}
:{{text|say|Niya, As Xavius|Xavius! Lord of Nightmares! Die!}}

Niya attacks. She has two abilities: Lurking Eruption, which summons a [[Lurking Terror]]; and Nightmare Blades, which deals damage in a line and causes knockback.''
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|<Name> confronted Xavius deep within the Emerald Dream!}}
:{{text|say|Audience Member|Who are the Legion?}}
:{{text|say|Audience Member|Remember when that entire world died? That was the Legion.}}
:{{text|yell|Audience Member|Fight! Fight! Fight!}}

Finish Niya off:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|And so, the Nightmare was brought to an end!}}
:{{text|emote|Ysera looks well pleased.}}
:{{text|yell|Ysera|I knew you would prevail, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Audience Member|Woohoo!}}
:{{text|say|Audience Member|Yeah! Beat that weird looking Sylvar!}}
:''Niya runs to the back of the stage.''

Return to the spotlight and use the bonus ability again: '''Begin Act 2, Gul'dan''':
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Once Xavius fell, <name> took up arms against the evil warlock, Gul'dan!}}
:{{text|yell|Audience Member|Boooo!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|But it wasn't their Gul'dan. This one came from the past... and another world... in an alternate timeline!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|I... think that's how it went...}}
:{{text|say|Audience Member|Wait... What?}}
:{{text|say|Audience Member|How does that work?}}

Attempt to finish Senthii off:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|They fought valiantly, but someone else landed the killing blow!}}
:{{text|yell|Windy, As Illidan|HA! You were not... ready!}}
:{{text|say|Audience Member|Well, that was rude.}}
:''Senthii and Windy leave the stage.''

More spotlight time - now '''Begin Act 3, Kil'jaeden''':
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Enraged by Gul'dan's failure, Kil'jaeden the Deceiver himself sought to destroy the Legion's foes!}}
:{{text|emote|Ysera gasps!}}
:{{text|yell|Glimmerdust, As Kil'jaeden|Death rains upon you!}}
:{{text|say|Droman Aliothe|KILL HIM, <NAME>!}}
:{{text|say|Droman Aliothe|DESTROY HIM!}}

Get Glimmerdust to 20% or so:
:{{text|yell|Glimmerdust, As Kil'jaeden|Fall, hero!}}
:''Glimmerdust knocks the player away.''
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|No! The defenders of Azeroth won this fight!}}
:{{text|say|Glimmerdust, As Kil'jaeden|Oh! Right!}}
:''Glimmerdust dramatically falls to the ground. Then, she gets back up and heads toward the back of the stage.''
:{{text|say|Glimmerdust, As Kil'jaeden|I never believed... that Sargeras could be stopped. Perhaps... you will prove me wrong.}}

To the light once more, to '''Begin Act 4, Argus''':
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Taking the fight to the Legion, Azeroth's champions battled the corrupted world-soul of Argus itself!}}
:{{text|emote|Ysera looks stunned.}}
:{{text|yell|Mi'kai, As Argus, the Unmaker|Death! Death and pain!}}

At 50%, Mi'kai "kills" the player:
:{{text|yell|Mi'kai, As Argus, the Unmaker|END IT ALL!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Hope is not lost! The spark of life still flickers within these mortals. Arise, champions! Fight to save your world!}}

Finish off Argus:
:{{text|say|Mi'kai, As Argus, the Unmaker|My torment... ends...}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|And so, the champions of Azeroth repelled the Burning Legion, ended their crusade, and saved all worlds!}}
:{{text|emote|Ysera cheers.}}
:{{text|say|Droman Aliothe|AND GOOD RIDDANCE!}}
:{{text|say|Audience Member|Woooo! Way to go!}}
:{{text|say|Awool|Wait... Worlds have souls?}}
:{{text|say|Choofa|Apparently? I haven't seen any around here.}}
:{{text|say|Choofa|At least I don't think so. Wouldn't they be... BIG?}}
:{{text|say|Slanknen|Perhaps such beings slumber in our groves?}}

To the spotlight one final time, to Take a Bow, then return backstage to Featherlight:
:{{text|say|Featherlight|Time for the next act!}}

Talking to Ysera in the audience
:This place is new and yet I feel almost as if I have been here before.
