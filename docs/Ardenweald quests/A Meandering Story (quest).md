==Objectives==
Bring the Meandering Story to [[Archivist Dreyden]] in the [[Grove of Memory]].
* [[A Meandering Story]] (provided)

==Description==
<A quick glance at this heavy tome reveals flowery language and a plot that doesn't seem to go anyplace. At least not in the first few chapters.

There is some dirt on the cover, but the damage isn't too bad. This book doesn't seem to have found itself in too much trouble-- a bit like its plot.

Archivist Dreyden would probably be pleased to have his book back.>

* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 950 [[XP]]
