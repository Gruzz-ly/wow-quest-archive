==Objectives==
Remove the threat of [[Gormhive]] so [[Hunt-Captain Korayn]] can attend the [[Ember Court]].
* [[Gorm Egg Tender]] slain  (3)
* [[Hatching Gorm Egg]]s destroyed (8)
* Gormhive Gorm slain (12)

==Description==
I am a [[Captain (rank)|Captain]] of the [[Wild Hunt]], a defender of the sacred groves. As much as I would enjoy the diversion, my place is here fighting back the forces of the enemy, not attending some festivity outside of [[Ardenweald]].

Eggs are hatching again at Gormhive and we shall soon be overrun by [[gormling]] [[larva]]. Until that threat is neutralized I cannot leave my post.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Hunt-Captain Korayn]]

==Completion==
Well done. Thank you for the help.
