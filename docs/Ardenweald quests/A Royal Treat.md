==Objectives==
Collect 6 Royal Peat in the [[Garden of Night]].
* [[Royal Peat]] (6)

==Description==
So nice to see you again. I've got a special request for you.

The [[Winter Queen]] herself used to tend directly to groves, in the early times. Everything she touched burst with life and power. Even the ground she walked on.

Over time, the Queen's Garden came to be known as the Garden of Night, for the Queen had not tended to her garden in so long.

But the ground is still potent with her power. It's the finest meal I've ever had. I know this is indulgent, but you and I both know I deserve it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Marasmius]]

==Progress==
Sometimes you just need to treat yourself to something nice.

==Completion==
Feel how luxurious the soil is! I'm going to savor this for a while. Thank you.
