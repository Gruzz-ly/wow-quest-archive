==Objectives==
Recruit Niya to help you bring the [[wildseed]] to [[Hibernal Hollow]].
* [[Niya]] recruited {{co|62.8|36.6|Ardenweald}}
*Speak with Niya next to the wildseed's cradle in the Tranquil Pools.

==Description==
I've never seen a wildseed quite like this one. Even the ones that bonded with their caretakers in the past never manifested nightmares like this.

Then again, we've also never had a living mortal in our midst.

We need to bring this wildseed to Hibernal Hollow. There it can receive the care and attention it needs.

I'll place it into the spirit cradle. Can you ask Niya if she would accompany you?

The poor [[sylvar]] has been directionless since the fall of her grove. This would be good for her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|51|90}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm surprised that any wildseed could spawn such nightmares.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|The wildseed will fare better in Hibernal Hollow. Perhaps Niya would like to come with you.}}

Find Niya at the edge of a pool to the west:
:It feels like Ardenweald is falling apart. First the possessed, now strange monsters attacking Tirna Vaal...
:Did you need something, <name>?
:{{gossip|I'm taking the wildseed responsible for this to Hibernal Hollow. I could use your help bringing it there.}}
:{{text|say|Niya|I would be glad to join you. I'll prepare for the journey.}}

East and then south to find [[Dreamweaver]] and the [[Spirit Cradle]].

;Objectives
Recruit Niya to escort the strange [[wildseed]] to [[Tirna Glayn]].

;Description
I've never seen a wildseed quite like this before. We've never had one imprint on an outsider or have nightmares.

Then again, we've also never had an outsider come here before who wasn't dead.

We need to take this wildseed to [[Hibernal Hollow]]. [[Tirna Vaal]] cannot take care of it anymore.

I'll handle loading it into a carrier. Can you speak with Niya and see that she accompanies you?

The poor [[sylvar]] has been directionless since [[Heartwood]]. This would be good for her.
