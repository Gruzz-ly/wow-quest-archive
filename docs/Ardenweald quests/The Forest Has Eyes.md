==Objectives==
Slay hidden Possessed Spies throughout [[Hibernal Hollow]].
* [[Possessed Spy]] slain (6)

==Description==
That dream! With the teeth and the claws and the heart... heart-wrenching sacrifice?

<[[Lady Moonberry|Moonberry]] chokes up for a moment then collects herself.>

Sorry! While we were in dreamland, possessed spies have snuck into Hibernal Hollow!

They must be hunted down and slain before they can report back on the grove's defenses.

Here, borrow a bit of my magic. Seek out the ones hidden in the shadows and smite them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|27|20}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you uncovered all those pesky spies yet?

==Completion==
These Drust are bold to send spies into my grove! Very bold, and very foolish.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Droman's Call]] from [[Droman Aliothe]] before getting started.

Look around for shadows on the ground and use the bonus ability when it appears:
:{{abilities|Eyes of the Forest|Reveal all nearby Possessed Spies.}}
