==Objectives==
Slay Bitterfly, Fiona Bleakthorn, and Wildtwister Lewor
* [[Fiona Bleakthorn]] slain
* [[Bitterfly]] slain
* [[Strange Runestone]]

==Description==
It's just as I feared, friend. The entire village is turned, just like [[Lavrash]].

[[Wildtwister Lewor|Lewor]] would have transformed the other elders as soon as possible. They are all strong in their own right. Brave Fiona, clever Bitterfly....

It pains me to say this, but they must be destroyed. For the good of [[Ardenweald]] and the forest, slay our former leaders before they can infect the rest of the land!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|37|20|60}}
* 12,950 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
If they fell, then what hope do we have?

==Completion==
<Partik gulps and turns pale.>

That's all of them, then? Good.
