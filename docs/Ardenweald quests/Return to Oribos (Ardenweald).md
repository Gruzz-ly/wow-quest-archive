==Objectives==
Speak to [[Tal-Inara]] in [[Oribos]].

==Description==
I wish you could stay and relax here, maybe enjoy a play at the [[Star Lake Amphitheater]], but there's simply no time!

There are other realms out there that need your help, too.

You will always be a friend of the [[Court of Night|Court]], but I'm afraid you must return to Oribos. The [[Shadowlands]] needs you!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*850 [[XP]]
*[[Emblem of Renown]]

==Completion==
Your efforts in Ardenweald have not gone unnoticed, [[Maw Walker]].

==Progression==
{{The Threads of Fate}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.0.2|note=Added.}}
