==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Maw]] and rescue Lost Souls.
* Lost Souls saved  (3)

==Description==
I learned that [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] burned [[Teldrassil]], I felt my heart break for the [[Night elf|night elves]].

And that was only the beginning. We know now that the [[soul]]s lost that day, did not go to their intended rest.

But you have the power to begin to correct that, [[Maw Walker]].

If you find yourself in the Maw, look for any of those lost.

Please, bring them home.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
A great wrong must be righted, any way we can.

==Completion==
Thank you, Maw Walker.

You have brought back a little bit of the light from the darkness.

We will make this right, no matter how long it takes.

==Notes==
This is not a normal "Save the Souls" weekly quest - the quest specifically looks for three named targets, all located in the [[Tremaculum]].

Additionally, there's no special dispensation for the [[Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)|Eye of the Jailer]] -- if players are already at threat tier 5 for the day they will need to return after the reset. Unlike normal soul saving, collecting the three souls will not affect threat levels, however.
