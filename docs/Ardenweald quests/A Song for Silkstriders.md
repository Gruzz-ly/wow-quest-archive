==Objectives==
Collect silk from the [[silkstrider]]s by playing the harp for them.
* [[Raw Silkstrider Silk]] (4)
* [[Silkstrider Harp]] (provided)

==Description==
There, the harp is fixed. I am too injured to take it to the silkstriders, but you are strong. You can help them.

Our precious silkstriders are all across the cliffs. When you find one, play the harp for them, and they will give you fresh silk. Make sure that there is nothing nearby to stress them out first though!

If you find yourself in need of a way to move about swiftly, just take a [[Silk Shooter]] there, next to me. Aim it where you want to go, and it will shoot silk to pull you there!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to help the poor silkstriders calm down, and get their silk?

==Completion==
Wonderful job! I'm sure the silkstriders appreciated the song you played. You look like someone who appreciates the fine arts.

==Notes==

:{{Text|Say|Artisan Rees|Use the harp to help calm the silkstriders, and they should give you some silk. They won't listen if they're scared!}}
:{{Text|Say|Artisan Rees|Oh, and if you want to move more swiftly around the cliffs, take a Silk Shooter. It will help you swing to another spot!}}

The named silkstriders around the cliffs are afflicted with the "Terrified!" debuff.
:{{Abilities|Terrified!|id=325426|Frightened! Will not provide silk until soothed.|icon=spell_magic_polymorphrabbit}}

Using the [[Silkstrider Harp]] near them removes the debuff and causes them to produce a bunch of [[Raw Silkstrider Silk]] in front of them.
*{{Text|emote|The silkstrider hums contentedly as it spins fresh silk.}}
*{{Text|emote|The silkstrider stops trembling, and spins a fresh batch of silk.}}
*{{Text|emote|The silkstrider dances gracefully, and weaves a fresh batch of silk.}}

They then get the "Empty" debuff, preventing the player from using the harp on them again.
