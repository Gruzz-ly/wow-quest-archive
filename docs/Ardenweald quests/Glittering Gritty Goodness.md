==Objectives==
Collect 6 Shimmersilt in [[Shimmerbough]].
* [[Shimmersilt]] (6)

==Description==
Well hello there! Fancy helping me out today?

You ever been to Shimmerbough? Ever wonder why it's called that? I was there when it was named, you know.

Lots of people think it's the trees or the water, and they're right. But the secret to the shimmering is in the silt. The soil soaks and gains excess anima from the water, until the ground itself practically sparkles.

I could really go for some shimmersilt right now. Would you let an old mushroom relive his youth?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,450 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Marasmius]]

==Progress==
Oooh, I always used to get tingly all over when I had shimmersilt. And that's a lot of tingling!

==Completion==
Look at it sparkle and shine! I'm getting the tingles just looking at it. I feel ages younger already!
