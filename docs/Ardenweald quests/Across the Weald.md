'''Across the Weald''' proves that there is no escape from the [[Shadowlands]] as [[Somnikus]] drags the [[Maw Walker]] back across the veil.

==Objectives==
Meet [[Somnikus]] at the [[Grove of Awakening]] in [[Ardenweald]].
*Cross into Ardenweald {{co|28.3|57.8|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
It is time. I know I said that I was fine, but ever since [[Solethus]]' death, it's like I've been missing something essential.

I am alive, and he is not. That feels... wrong.

But there might be a way I can set things right. [[Ysera]] is the only one who can help us get control of [[Ancient Bough]] again. I think I can help bring her back.

It's getting harder and harder to cross over. We need to make this count.

[[Tyrande]] and [[Malfurion]] will meet us there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Greetings. Somnikus has told me of the grave threat in the [[Emerald Gardens]]. He has told me of his own part in it.

But I'm afraid the solution will not be as simple as he hopes.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Somnikus|It is time. Let us stand before Ysera and face whatever comes.}}
:''Somnikus walks through the [[Portal to Ardenweald]] held open by two [[Elder Portal Keeper]]s.''

Follow him in to return to the [[Shadowlands]]. The portal drops players off yards away from a return portal back to the Ohn'ahran Plains (yay!), just north of the [[Grove of Awakening]]. Catch up to [[Ysera]], [[Somnikus]], [[Tyrande Whisperwind]], and [[Malfurion Stormrage]]:
:{{text|say|Ysera|If someone else is bound here in my place... yes, I could return to the Dream and protect the gardens from the other side.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|But, my dear old friend, you cannot take my place. You must wait a little longer before you rejoin your son.}}

Ysera has gossip here:
:I thought that I would remain here in these boughs forever. But my dreams of soaring above Azeroth have only become stronger.

:{{gossip|Why can't Somnikus take your place?}}
::Somnikus cannot offer his life. Instead, someone must bear the binding that connects me to the [[Winter Queen]] and to Ardenweald.

::Dragons like him, and like his son, Solethus, are not predestined to come to Ardenweald. Ardenweald is for powerful nature spirits that may one day be reborn to their own realms. It has happened countless times over, and it will happen countless times again.

::Only someone who is already part of that cycle may take my place here.

::{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}

As does Malfurion:
:Much has not felt right since Ysera was cast from the realms of life. It is as if there is a great imbalance striving to be corrected.

:{{gossip|Who are you?}}
::I am Malfurion Stormrage, husband to Tyrande Whisperwind and brother to [[Illidan Stormrage|Illidan]]. I have lived and dreamed in the forests of [[Kalimdor]] since before [[Great Sundering|the Sundering]].

::Throughout the ages I have fought for my people and the lands we call home. One day, I hope that I will stand together with Tyrande before the new world tree, our new home. 

::No matter what happens, she and I share a love that is eternal.

::{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
