==Objectives==
Investigate the unknown area.
* Travel to the Unknown
* Relax! (3)

==Description==
Come to pay old [[Marasmius]] a visit? I have a special task for you.

One of my shoots has found a strange place, a place even I've never seen before.

I'm not entirely sure what's in there or if it's even safe. But that's what my trusty mushroomancers are for!

What do you say, <name>? Up for an adventure? 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Marasmius]]

==Progress==
Keep your guard up. It could lead anywhere!

==Completion==
You know I appreciate hard work, but it's important to take care of yourself from time to time. Hope you had fun, blew off some steam, and are ready to get back at it!

==Notes==
Take the Mushroom to the Deep Unknown to see what variant Marasmius offers today.
:{{text|say|Marasmius|Oh, the [[Root Cellar]]! I'm glad it's still around. Look, you've been doing a lot lately. Go ahead and take a break, and come back when you've properly relaxed a bit!}}

Bang on some instruments, identify the correct [[Shimmersod]], (he prefers the animai tail), help [[Daffodil]] compose a song about [[Gwynceirw]], or have [[Mixy Mak]] make a drink with the help of [[Squeezums]].
