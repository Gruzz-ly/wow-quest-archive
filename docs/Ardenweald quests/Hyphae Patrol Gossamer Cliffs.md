==Description==
<Bad news from the Gossamer Cliffs. We need to help.

The varmints terrorizing the poor silk striders have become more cruel and aggressive lately. The silk striders are important to [[Ardenweald]]; more important than almost anyone else knows. We can't lose any more.

Let me know when you're ready to go and we'll scare those gits away for good!>
