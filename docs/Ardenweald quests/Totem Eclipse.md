==Objectives==
Destroy Foul [[Totem]]s.
* [[Foul Totem (Ardenweald)|Foul Totems]] destroyed (4)

==Description==
I can smell our foes' dark magic, twisting the air and muddling my mind. They are up to something. Bringing awful powers into Ardenweald.

If you see any of their totems, destroy them immediately. 

I always feel better after smashing something to pieces, don't you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|80|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What terrible magic has been brought into Ardenweald?

==Completion==
If it was not clear before, it is now. This is a personal hunt.

We will rid Ardenweald of this monster.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests before heading out.

There are four Foul Totems, marked on the minimap:
*{{co|52.4|35.5|Ardenweald}}
*{{co|52.6|37.2|Ardenweald}}
*{{co|54.9|38.6|Ardenweald}} (in the tree)
*{{co|50.6|37.4|Ardenweald}}

As each totem is destroyed, someone chimes in. The first:
:{{text|say|Lorkron the Hunter|Korayn... ever the cunning huntress.}}
:{{text|say|Hunt-Captain Korayn|I know that voice. But he fell in battle...}}

Second:
:{{text|say|Lorkron the Hunter|Know your prey. The first lesson you taught me. One you have forgotten.}}
:{{text|say|Hunt-Captain Korayn|Lorkron... what has become of you?}}

Third:
:{{text|say|Lorkron the Hunter|Do you not recognize your quarry? The blades they wield? The faces behind the masks?}}
:{{text|say|Hunt-Captain Korayn|The masked fae... this is the fate that awaits them?!}}

Fourth:
:{{text|say|Lorkron the Hunter|You sent us on a doomed hunt. Now you are the prey. And I know you well.}}
:{{text|say|Hunt-Captain Korayn|Enough, Lorkron! If you truly know me, then you should be afraid.}}
