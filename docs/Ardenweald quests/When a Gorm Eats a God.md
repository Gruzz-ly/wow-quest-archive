==Objectives==
Report back to [[Droman Tashmur]] in [[Tirna Vaal]].

==Description==
There is nothing more we can do here. I will get [[Master Sha'lor]] safely back to Tirna Vaal.

When you get there, report to the droman what we found here.

If the [[gorm]] have started to eat the dead [[wildseed]]s, and are absorbing the power of the [[Soul|spirits]] within, we are all in serious danger.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Dreamthorn Legguards
|Grove Warden's Greaves
|Spirit Tender's Leggings
|Starshroud Breeches
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|48|5}}
* 1,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Those that speak, think. A different kind of Queen is born.

The forest worries. For this will surely not be the last.

==Criteria of==
*[[Awaken, Ardenweald]]
