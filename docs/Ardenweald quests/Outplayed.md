{{questportrait|Wicked Wort.jpg|Wicked Wort|A cruel spriggan who has disguised themselves with fae magic. Allergic to puffpetal powder.}}
==Objectives==
Defeat Wicked Wort.
* [[Wicked Wort]] slain
* [[Pouch of Puffpetal Powder]] (provided)
*Return to the Lady of the Falls.

==Description==
Now we can strike down their leader, friend.

It just so happens that I have a large pouch of puffpetal powder right here. Why don't you take it and toss a few handfuls around the workshop floor at the top of the falls? If they are still there, I imagine they will have an... unfortunate reaction.

While you do that I will gather the other elders and make our way to [[Glitterfall Basin]]. Speak with the [[Lady of the Falls|Lady]] when your task is done.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Wakener's Frond
|Soulsifter Root
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|74|41|20}}
* 16,200 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
Puffpetal powder is mostly harmless to the rest of us. It smells quite nice, actually.

==Completion==
Ah, the hero of the hour returns! Thank you for liberating my supplies. Our grove desperately needs them in these trying times.

==Notes==
Use the quest item to make Wort visible.
