{{questportrait|Fortified Desiccator.jpg|Fortified Desiccator|A large gorm whose shell is almost impossible to pierce.}}
==Objectives==
Find Myn'ir in the [[Gormhive]], then kill the Fortified Desiccator.
*[[Myn'ir]] found
*Speak to Myn'ir
*[[Fortified Desiccator]] slain

==Description==
Our quarry is one of the [[gorm]], native creatures who were once helpful beasts of [[Ardenweald|the realm]], until the drought drove them mad.

This particular beast has not only grown to a frightening size, but also has a shell so strong that none of our weapons or arrows have managed to pierce it.

This spear you bring, infused with the [[anima]] of [[Bastion]], could be the exact weapon we need to pierce the gorm's armor and put him down.

My sister went ahead to scout. Let's not linger.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}

==Progress==
The gorm are ravenous. Their appetites have become their downfall.

==Completion==
The terror has been put down. Your aid, and you spear, were quite useful.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Alderyn|My [[Myn'ir|sister]] is one of the most skilled trackers I have ever met. She headed south to find our quarry not long ago.}}

;Entering the cave:
:{{text|say|Alderyn|Ah, this must be the place.}}
:{{text|say|Myn'ir|Alderyn, you're here. Good. The beast is wounded, but I cannot do much more with that armor intact.}}

;Speaking with Myn'ir
:Keep quiet. Cornering the gorm in this cave was no easy feat.

:{{Gossip|I have arrived as aid from Bastion.}}
:{{text|say|Myn'ir|With that spear of yours, we should be able to pierce its armor. By your lead, then.}}

Approaching the gorm, the Heartpierces Javelin extra action button appears.

;Using the Heartpiercer Javelin
:{{text|yell|Myn'ir|Its defenses are broken! Attack!}}

;Defeating the gorm
:{{text|say|Myn'ir|No longer shall that gorm eat our precious forests.}}
:{{text|say|Alderyn|Well hunted, <name>. Come, let us speak of your reward.}}
