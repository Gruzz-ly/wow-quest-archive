==Objectives==
Destroy the barrier and collect the Heart of [[Tirna Noch]].
* [[Barrier (Ardenweald)|Barrier]] Destroyed {{co|71.7|54.7|Ardenweald}}
* [[Heart of Tirna Noch]] collected {{co|71.8|54.7|Ardenweald}}

==Description==
I was right! A great deal of [[anima]] has been stored inside the heart of the grove.

The [[Drust]] must have collected it from all over [[Ardenweald]].

And now, we will take it back.

Quickly, destroy that barrier and grab the heart. [[Niya]] and I will protect you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We will reclaim this anima. The Drust will not use it for their own ends.

==Completion==
Now that we have the heart, we need to find a way out of this place.

And I hear the distinct sound of approaching enemies...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Niya|Get the heart! We'll hold off the Drust!}}

[[Blighted Defender]]s keep running up the ramp, but [[Ara'lon]] and [[Niya]] fend them off.

An attackable barrier guards the path. As soon as the player starts attacking, Niya and Ara'lon have a conversation:
:{{text|say|Niya|So much anima... could we not use it to restore your grove? And mine, as well!}}
:{{text|say|Ara'lon|Our groves are gone, Niya. We must accept it and let them go.}}
:{{text|say|Niya|There must be some way to bring back what we've lost! Some way to ease the pain...}}
:{{text|say|Ara'lon|They were sacrificed to save Ardenweald. The greatest thing we can do now is fight to protect it.}}

Once the [[Barrier (Ardenweald)|Barrier]]<!-- 166222 --> falls, interact with the [[:Heart of Tirna Noch]].

On complete, a cutscene plays. A huge number of Drust start running up the ramp:
:{{text|say|Niya|There are too many of them!}}
:{{text|say|Ara'lon|Protect the heart at all costs!}}
:''As Niya, Ara'lon, and the player get ready to attack, the Drust start getting polymorphed into harmless creatures.''
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Hmph! I can't leave you alone for a moment, can I?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Well, come along! We have work to do!}}
