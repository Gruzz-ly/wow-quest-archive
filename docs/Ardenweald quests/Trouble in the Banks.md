==Objectives==
Find [[Foreman Thorodir]] near the [[Banks of Life]].

==Description==
Ah, be welcome in my glade, [[Maw Walker]]. You are safe here.

While it is regrettable that [[Sorcha]] must wait for her weapons, it is of paramount importance that I keep my charges safe. I will do anything to prevent them from suffering as the rest of [[Ardenweald]].

Perhaps I could ask a small favor of you. I have not heard from the gatherers at the Banks of Life in some time. Would you mind checking on them to make sure they are well? I would go myself, but I must deal with Sorcha. Seek out Foreman Thorodir.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|48|5}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, the Lady sent you? Well, I have some bad news.

==Progression==
