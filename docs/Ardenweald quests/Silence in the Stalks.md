==Objectives==
Speak to [[Cortinarius]] outside the [[Stalks]].

==Description==
Hmm. Well that's not... great. But no cause for alarm, yet!

It has been a long time since our ring withdrew from here, and we probably need to go to its source to get it to return!

Unfortunately, I haven't heard from the Chief Mushroomancer, Cortinarius, since the crisis began.

Please, find him and help us rejoin the rings! Head west of [[Dreamsong Fenn]] to the Stalks. You can't miss them... just follow the mushrooms!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Finally, a friendly face! Are you with the Hunt? You don't look like you're from around here....

;Description
The [[anima]] isn't the problem, but we're not connected to the fae rings any more.

It has been a long time since our ring withdrew from here, and we probably need to go to the source to fix it.

Unfortunately we haven't heard from the Chief Mushroomancer, Cortinarius, since the crisis began.

Please, find him and help us rejoin the rings! Head west of Dreamsong Fenn to the Stalks. You can't miss them, just follow the mushrooms.
