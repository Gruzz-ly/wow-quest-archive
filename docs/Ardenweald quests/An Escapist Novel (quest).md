==Objectives==
Bring the Escapist Novel to [[Archivist Dreyden]] in the [[Grove of Memory]].
* [[An Escapist Novel]] (provided)

==Description==
<Action, adventure, thrills, chills... This book has it all! Penned by a mortal [[soul]] who led an amazing life, this book is a page-turner.

But is it true? Could one person fight conspiracies, ancient evils, vast enemy armies, [[demon]]s and even [[god]]s in a single lifetime?

On further reflection, it could be true, but what is a "[[duck]]" this book speaks of? That part sounds fake.

Still... it was a good story. Archivist Dreyden would probably be pleased to have his book back.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This was a good tale! Oh, I do hope the soul who wrote it down is doing okay in this drought! Oh dear me. Thank you for returning it to me.
