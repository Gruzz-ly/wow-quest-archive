==Description==
<Moonberry looks serious.>

[[Mortal]] though you are, you have chosen to become one of our champions. While you uphold our cause, we are obligated to extend hospitality to you within our sacred hall and grant you certain boons.

As a member of the [[Court of Night]], I can bestow our powers on chosen mortals.

<Name>, <class> of [[Azeroth]], I bid you welcome to the first tree, [[Tirna Achiad]], the Heart of the Forest.

Please, follow me.

You will learn: [[Soulshape]]

You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Accept this boon and use it for the benefit of Ardenweald.

==Completion==
May this boon aid you in the trials ahead, <name>.

Before our Queen grants you our power and we accept you formally into our midst, there are certain... Traditions which we must uphold.

==Notes==
Speak with Moonberry:
:I am pleased to grant you this boon. If you would follow me?
:{{gossip|Lead on.}}
:''Lady Moonberry heads toward the Heart of the Forest. A [[Conjured Image]] of a soul follows behind her.''
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Long ago, after the trees and the Night Fae arose, the first mortal soul appeared in Ardenweald.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|Our Queen met it at the gateway. "You are neither spirit nor fae. Why have you come to my forest?"}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|"I have been sent to you! For in life, I devoted myself to serving Nature."}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|"Then be welcome in my realm," replied the Queen.}}
:''In the Heart of the Forest, many [[Tranquil Soul]]s are gathered. Lady Moonberry makes her way before them, then turns to face you.''

Step inside the circle in front of Lady Moonberry and use the [[Extra Action Button]] ability, {{Abilities|Receive Boon|id=337624|icon=ability_nightfae_soulshape}}:
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|The soul knelt. "How may I be of service, O Queen?"}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|"Tend to these spirits forever more. The cycle must continue, or all is lost."}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|"How shall I do this, O Queen?" the soul asked. "For my body is no more."}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|"I grant you this boon. Become as the wild creatures. Whatever shape you require, it shall be yours."}}
:{{text|say|Lady Moonberry|And so, <name>, I extend the Queen's boon to you. Arise.}}

At this point, [[alt]] characters can speak to Lady Moonberry to skip ahead to [[For Queen and Grove!]].<!-- Forgot to grab the gossip text for this. -->
