==Objectives==
Collect 6 Treated Gorm Husks.
* Treated Gorm Husk (6)
*Deliver the husks to Gormsmith Cavina.

==Description==
I need more husks, [[Foreman Thorodir|Thorodir]]! The Lady herself wants to make sure we are outfitted with the finest armor.

They've been soaking in the waters long enough to be workable. Find some time to retrieve them before our [[hunter]]s find themselves without adequate protection.

<The work order is signed: "[[Gormsmith Cavina|Cavina]].">

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|37|20|60}}
* 12,950 [[XP]]
* +160 reputation with [[Wild Hunt|The Wild Hunt]]

==Progress==
What's that you have there?

==Completion==
I'm glad you found my note. Husks such as these need to soak in running water for several days before they can be shaped without breaking.

At least you were able to salvage something.

==Progression==
{{Trouble at the Gormling Corral}}

==Beta version==

;Description
They've been soaking in the waters long enough to be workable, we just need to remember to go out and get them. Find some time before things get really busy and we don't have adequate protection for our [[warrior]]s.
