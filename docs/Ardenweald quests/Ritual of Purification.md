==Objectives==
Complete the Ritual of Purification.
* Purification Fetish used
* Ritual of Purification (0/100%)

==Description==
I have finished making preparations for the ritual. The moment of truth has come.

The [[Drust]] fetish that [[Ulfar]] gave you will channel the ritual's power into [[Gweyir]]. It should counteract the curse that imprisons her mind.
 
This will not be pleasant. It may not even work. But this is the only chance we have to free her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 11,800 [[XP]]
*[[Emblem of Renown]]

==Progress==
The ritual is our only hope of freeing Gweyir. We must try...

==Completion==
You performed the ritual admirably, but the [[Gorak Zhar]]'s power was too strong for Gweyir to withstand. There is nothing more we can do, I am afraid.

It seems the masked fae are lost to us after all...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kivarr|Be ready, Maw Walker. Gorak Zhar's sorcery will not be easily purged.}}

Players gain a bonus ability:
:{{Abilities|Purification Fetish|Purges the target of Drust enchantments.|range=20|cd=16|notes=Channeled|id=340391|icon=inv_enchanting_815_drustrod}}

Use it, and a handful of [[Purged Manifestation]]s spawn:
:{{text|say|Kivarr|Destroy those things, quickly!}}

Take them out:
:{{text|say|Kivarr|Keep at it! The Drust's hold upon her is weakening!}}
:{{text|say|Gweyir|Unggh...}}

Use the bonus ability again. Each round of four manifestations is worth 25% of the bar. At 75%:
:{{text|say|Kivarr|Stay with us, Gweyir! This curse is nearly broken!}}
:{{text|say|Gweyir|Can't... hold on...}}

Use the fetish a final time and defeat the final four manifestations:
:''Gweyir dies.''
:{{text|say|Kivarr|Gweyir! No...}}
:{{text|say|Lord Herne|She did not survive...}}

==Progression==
{{Drust to Drust}}

==Beta version==
{{Rfb-section}}
;Description
I have imbued the fetish you brought from [[Ulfar]] with the reagents you gathered from within the [[Shadowlands]].

Channel the power of the fetish on [[Gweyir]] and it will counteract the bonds of possession that imprison her.

This ritual will not be pleasant and I will make no promises that it will work or that Gweyir will survive. But this is our only course of action and her freedom depends on it.
