==Objectives==
Use the Droman's Horn to summon the [[Wild Hunt]] at the entrances to the grove.
* Horn Sounded at East Road {{co|62.2|55.5|Ardenweald}}
* Horn Sounded at North Road {{co|60.0|49.0|Ardenweald}}
* Horn Sounded at West Road {{co|58.0|55.5|Ardenweald}}
* [[Droman's Hunting Horn]] (provided)

==Description==
Our enemies close in swiftly, <name>. We must sound the call to defend the grove!

Use this horn to call upon our protectors. Summon the Wild Hunt to slay those who would attack us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|63|60}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Hunt will hear our call and ride to defend the grove!

==Completion==
The Wild Hunt rides to our aid... but not from the west?

That is where Hunt-Captain Korayn was tracking a dangerous foe. She and her hunting party must have been waylaid.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Droman Aliothe|Take the horn, sound the call, and summon the Hunt.}}

Pick up [[The Forest Has Eyes]] from [[Lady Moonberry]] before getting started.

At either the north or the south entrance to the hollow, look for a Hunter's Mark pointing at the ground, and use the quest item:
:{{Text|say|Droman Aliothe|The Hunt did not heed the call? That does not bode well.}}

At the west entrance, a few members of the Wild Hunt appear - [[Queensbow]], [[Wild Hunt Swifthoof]], and [[Wild Hunt Nightblade]].

==Progression==
