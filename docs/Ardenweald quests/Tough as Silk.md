==Objectives==
Slay attackers, save caretakers, and hatch [[silkstrider]] [[larva]]e in the [[Gossamer Cliffs]].
*Silk Production preserved (100%)

==Description==
We are the heart of silk production in [[Ardenweald]], but we can't do our work!

Our grove has been completely taken over by [[spriggan]]s and these [[Boggart|strange shapeshifting... things]].

The silkstriders who spin the silk are very delicate creatures. They need peace and calm, and a little music to keep them happy! But with all these monsters all over the place, they're super stressed out.

Please, can you get in there and eliminate these hooligans, and see if you can help get us up and running again?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We need to get silk production running again, for Ardenweald!

==Completion==
Thank you! We are so grateful for your help with slaying those cretins, and rescuing our people.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Caretaker Lillythistle|[[Ol' Gertie]]... I hope you and all the other silkstriders are all right. [[Rose (silkstrider)|Rose]], [[Daisy (silkstrider)|Daisy]]... [[Lillythistle Jr.]]..}}

The bar is filled by killing spriggans ([[Blackthorn Barbslinger]]s, [[Blackthorn Needler|Needlers]], and [[Blackthorn Witch Doctor|Witch Doctors]]) and boggarts ([[Shifting Horror]]s and [[Noisul of Many Faces]]), destroying [[Silkstrider Cocoon]]s, and interacting with captive [[Silkstrider Caretaker]]s around the Gossamer Cliffs.

The [[Broken Harp]] at {{Co|38.1|28.8|Ardenweald}} offers [[The Shattered Harp]].
