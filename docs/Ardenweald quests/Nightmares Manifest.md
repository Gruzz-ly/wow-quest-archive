==Objectives==
Confront the wildseed's nightmares in [[Tirna Vaal]].
*Nightmares confronted (0/100%)
*Wildseed soothed {{co|65.2|36.7|Ardenweald}}

==Description==
Oh, this isn't good. As soon as you left, the spirit's nightmares spilled out all over Tirna Vaal.

I've done everything to try to soothe her. I've tried singing to her, I've tried telling her stories, but nothing I do seems to calm her.

Please, would you confront and dispel her nightmares? That might be the only thing that will work.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|24|80|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Her dreams are usually beautiful.

==Completion==
There, that seems to have calmed her. I can feel her dreams begin to ease.

You really do have a knack for this!

But I'm worried that we're only buying time, and we need to do something more drastic.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Nothing seems to end the nightmares! Could you try a more... direct approach?}}

Each [[Unleashed Nightmare (Ardenweald)|Unleashed Nightmare]] is worth between 3-8% depending on how much HP it has. The defenders chime in on occasion:
*{{text|say|Grove Defender|What spirit is so powerful that their nightmares become real?}}
*{{text|say|Grove Defender|We must do something to soothe this spirit, before her nightmares overtake us all.}}
*{{text|say|Grove Defender|This is unheard of! How are these manifesting?}}
*{{text|say|Spirit Tender|Are all these nightmares coming from just one spirit? How is that possible?}}
*{{text|say|Droman Tashmur|The storm abates... for now.}}
*{{text|say|Grove Defender|We can only fight for so long. Something must be done for this spirit.}}
*{{text|say|Guardian Kota|Thank you. These nightmares simply keep appearing!}}

Once the bar is full, return to the tree and interact with the Distressed Wildseed to soothe it:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|It looks like the spirit is calm again... Thank you, friend.}}

The wildseed is now Young Wildseed. This completes the "Glitterfall Heights" chapter of the [[Ardenweald storyline]]. The campaign continues with [[The Way to Hibernal Hollow]].

I've done everything to try to soothe her. I've tried singing to her, I've tried talking to her, I've tried reminding her how beautiful she is! But nothing I do seems to calm her.

Please, would you confront some of those nightmares for us, and help her?
