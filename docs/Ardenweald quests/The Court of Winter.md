==Notes==
Speak with the Winter Queen:
:<The Queen regards you steadily.>
:{{gossip|<Deliver the Primus's Message.>}}
:{{text|emote|The Winter Queen observes the message from the Primus.}}
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|My old friend. After countless ages, our worst fears have come to pass.}}
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|If the [[The Jailer|Banished One]] stirs, then we face a danger even more grave than this crippling drought.}}
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|Come, <name>. Join me at my court and stand before the Heart of the Forest. There we shall speak further.}}

Return to the [[Heart of the Forest]] and speak with the Winter Queen again:
:<The Queen regards you steadily.>
:{{gossip|Yes, your majesty?}}
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|The Heart of the Forest is vital to Ardenweald... and to the protection of the realms beyond.}}
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|Long ago, we drew upon its magic to ensure the Maw would be inescapable. That the Banished One would remain forever bound.}}
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|The drought has caused the Heart to wither. Its strength must be bolstered... though we have precious little anima to save our waning groves.}}
:{{text|say|Winter Queen|An impossible choice. Yet, one that must be made for the good of the cycle.}}

===Gossip===
Many of the NPCs have special gossip text regarding Ysera:

;Ysera
:This place is new and yet I feel almost as if I have been here before.
*{{gossip|What will you do now?}}
:I feel that so much has happened in my absence.
:It will take time for me to be myself again, if that is even possible.
:Thank you, <name>, for saving me.
*{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|I feel a profound connection to this realm. And yet, in my dreams I still soar above Azeroth.}}
:{{text|say|Droman Aliothe|You are bound to the Queen, and to Ardenweald, just as I am. Yet I envy your dreams of home.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|The longing in your voice speaks of loss.}}
:{{text|say|Droman Aliothe|My world was shattered beneath the hammer of the Burning Legion. There is nothing left but ashes.}}
:{{text|say|Droman Aliothe|Now this forest is my home. As it is meant to be. We serve the cycle, and the Queen guides us.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|But Ardenweald, too, is under threat. I see many shadows tearing at its fringes. Clawing their way in.}}
:{{text|say|Droman Aliothe|Aye. Though with your help, we will drive them back. Of this, I am certain.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|Thank you, Aliothe. I welcome your counsel, and your friendship.}}
;Lady Moonberry
:I hope the Queen will spare this one. I think having her around will make this place interesting.
;Ara'lon
:So many have been lost. So many have died...
:<Ara'lon trails off into silent contemplation.>
;Hunt-Captain Korayn
:The Drust grow boldder with every attack. How many more friends must we strike down before this is done?
{{Rfb-section}}
:This Ysera fought and died for your world. I can respect that. I hope the Queen will spare her, but the Queen has many hard choices to make.
