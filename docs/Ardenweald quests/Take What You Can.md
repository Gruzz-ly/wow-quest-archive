==Objectives==
Take Plundered Anima from stores in [[Tirna Noch]].
* [[Plundered Anima (item)]] (40)

==Description==
We know that these invaders have taken over the remains of the grove. 

But why? Why are they gathering [[anima]] and bringing it all to one place?

And how did they enter [[Ardenweald]]?

We should stay alert and take as much anima as we can find. Perhaps some good can come out of all this loss.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|3|80}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I sometimes mourn what was lost. And then I remember what work there is still left to do.

==Completion==
This anima will help [[Dreamweaver]] complete his ritual... and perhaps save spirits who otherwise would have been lost.

Good work.

==Notes==
Pick up all three quests and [[Ara'lon]] and [[Niya]] join the party. Kill hostiles for [[Stolen Mementos]], loot [[Fae Basket]]s for [[Plundered Anima]], and interact with the three marked locations to scout out more anima reserves.

;Description
We know that the invaders and their minions, the [[Blighted]], have taken possession of the grove.

But why? Why are they gathering so much [[anima]] in one place?

And how did these creatures get into [[Ardenweald]], in the first place?

;Completion
This anima will go a long way toward [[Dreamweaver]]'s ritual, and perhaps, it can also be used to save spirits that otherwise would have been lost.
