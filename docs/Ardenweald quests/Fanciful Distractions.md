==Objectives==
Find Riverblossom, Lunarwind, and Flitterfly and convince them to return to [[Nuuminuuru]].
*[[Riverblossom]] returned
*[[Lunarwind]] returned
*[[Flitterfly]] returned

==Description==
Ever chasing their fleets of fancy, my [[Faerie|faeries]] friends are seldom seen.

Their mercurial natures oft lead them astray, tracing them paths to distraction and dismay.

Seek my friends, insist they return to my roots, and both you and they may receive recompense.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}

==Progress==
My wards know to return to my roost, to spin stories of their pursuits and strengthen their spirits.

The longer they flit away, the deeper the creases of my concern grow.

==Completion==
The waters of your realm revitilize{{sic}} my wards in ways those of our home cannot.

Once again, they return to rest.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Nuuminuuru|Aid my allies in the troubles that tie them. Reassure them that upon their return, they will receive the rejuvenation they require.}}

Riverblossom‎ is at [[Tranquil Pools]].

;Speaking with Riverblossom
:My poor Gummy is distraught! Nothing is calming him down.

:{{Gossip|Nuuminuuru requests your return.}}

:{{Text|say|Riverblossom|I cannot return while Gummy is so troubled! I left my flute by the water, retrieve it for me so I may calm him down.}}

Head back down to a small pond where [[Riverblossom's Flute]] lies and return back to Riverblossom to speak with her again.

:{{Text|say|Riverblossom|My flute, my flute! It will be okay, Gummy.}}
:{{Text|say|Riverblossom|I will return to Nuuminuuru. I think Gummy could use a break too.}}
:''Briefly plays the flute, then teleports away.''

Lunarwind is at [[Hibernal Hollow]].

;Speaking with Lunarwind
:What was that for? I was having fun on that joyride!

:{{Gossip|Nuuminuuru is worried about you.}}

:{{Text|say|Lunarwind|Nuumi is worried? Aw gorms... I guess it has been a while. I'll go check in with them.}}

Flitterfly is at [[Shimmerbough]].

;Approaching Flitterfly
:{{Text|say|Flitterfly|Ahh! Someone help me!}}

;Speaking with Flitterfly
:The [[possessed]] fae cornered me! I didn't know what to do!

:{{Gossip|You should return to Nuuminuuru. They are concerned.}}

:{{Text|say|Flitterfly|I will be much safer with Nuumi. Thank you!}}
