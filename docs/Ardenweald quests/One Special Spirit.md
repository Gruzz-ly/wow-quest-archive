==Objectives==
Go with Dreamweaver to feed [[anima]] to the wildseed in [[Tirna Vaal]].
* Speak with [[Dreamweaver]] at the young [[wildseed]] {{co|65.2|36.7|Ardenweald}}
* Animacone used on young wildseed {{co|65.2|36.7|Ardenweald}}
*Return to Droman Tashmur.

==Description==
You've been a huge help to Tirna Vaal. I need to bring this anima to one of our newest wildseeds.

I'd love for you to come with me. It's only fair, since you're the one who recovered the animacones.

I'm quite excited for you! Let's go.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|40|20}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The howling wind becomes a gentle breeze. All is well once again.

==Completion==
Starlight shines within [[Dreamweaver]], radiant and serene.

And... two rivers meet in a lush delta. A wildseed and a mortal, both new to the forest. Bonded by spirit and by fate.

Long has it been since the boughs beheld such an event. The weald will be watching.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Come, we'll show you how to care for a wildseed and watch its spirit dream.}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Let's start with a younger one. It arrived just before the drought, and needs a little extra attention.}}
:{{text|say|Droman Tashmur|The wind lifts your wings once more, Dreamweaver.}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|All thanks to our helpful new friend!}}

Follow Dreamweaver and speak with him when the squad makes it to the Young Wildseed:
:Isn't this a great little wildseed? It will be many years before it returns to its plane.
:Go on, take the animacones you found and infuse it with anima.
:{{gossip|I'll take the animacones and infuse this wildseed with their anima.}}

Use the [[Infused Animacones]]:
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Uh oh... a nightmare is afflicting the spirit inside this wildseed. Poor thing must have met a violent end...}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|A touch of anima should soothe it. Once its dreams have calmed, we can--}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Wait... the spirit is... bonding with you! This hasn't happened since... well, since I can remember!}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|We should tell the droman. A wildseed bonding with its caretaker is a rare and joyous occasion!}}
:{{text|say|Dreamweaver|Hmm, this isn't good... the spirit's nightmare still lingers. Whatever could have happened to it?}}

This concludes the "Tranquil Pools" chapter of the [[Ardenweald storyline]]. [[Droman Tashmur]] previously started [[Spirits of the Glen]], which must also be completed to continue. Once both forks are complete, [[Lady Moonberry]] continues the campaign with [[Preparing for the Winter Queen]].

;Description
You've done great work so far. I usually bring this anima to our newest wildseeds in Tirna Vaal.

I'd love for you to come with me and infuse this anima into one of our youngest wildseeds.

;Progress
The song of Tirna Vaal sings beautifully again. How I missed its sweet melody.

;Completion
Dreamweaver's melody has changed... as well as the small spirit residing in the wildseed.

So Dreamweaver has named it Dreamer... and you have bonded with it?

This is a song that has not been sung in all of Ardenweald's existence.

You are a most interesting creature.
