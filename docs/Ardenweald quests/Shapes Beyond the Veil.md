You have done much to aid us in your time here, but I can sense fate calls you elsewhere.

In honor of the many souls you have rescued on your journey, and to serve as a guiding light for those you have yet to encounter, please accept this gift. May it serve as a reminder of what wonder life can bring when given a little assistance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Seed of Renewed Souls]]
