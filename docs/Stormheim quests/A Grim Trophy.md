==Objectives==
Take the Head of [[Thane Wildsky]].
* [[Head of Thane Wildsky]]

==Description==
It would seem [[Sylvanas]] does not wish to be followed - by us or anyone else.

Her will is her own, it is not my place to question. Only to obey.

In the hills nearby, a [[gryphon]] master is preparing to take flight, no doubt to pursue our queen from the sky. My rangers are lying in wait - we need only to close our jaws around him.

I will have his head when this is over.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Footwraps of the Blightcaller
|Duskbat Exterminator's Treads
|Blighthound Master's Greaves
|Sabatons of the Blightcaller
|Black Rose Hood
|Blighthound Master's Hood
|Gryphonstalker's Visage
|Wildsky's Unused Helmet}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
* 15,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have his head?

==Completion==
Look carefully at this head, <name>. This is what comes to those who stand against the [[Forsaken]].

For now, we should begin our search for the Aegis of Agrammar. I will send some scouts out to discern its location. You should start your search as well. 

What are you waiting for?

==Notes==
