==Objectives==
Release 6 7th Legion Dragoons from static fields.
*[[7th Legion Dragoon]] released x6

==Description==
Hngghh!

Nope, can't stand yet. It's all pins and needles.

Small fries like this are usually no problem for the 7th, but we weren't prepared for their electrical attacks. Before I knew it, I was trapped in some kind of static field. Couldn't move a muscle until you came along.

My comrades were carried deeper into the cave. Get 'em out before they become whelp chow!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|14|60|}}

==Completion==
<The transponder lights up. An uneasy voice comes over the line.>

Hello? Is this working? (By the Light, I hate these things.)

This is [[Mishka]]. Missing 7th Legion soldiers have returned to camp. All accounted for.

Uh.. over. Message over.

Over and goodbye.

End transm- <The radio cuts out sharply.>

==Notes==
In the cavern, stand in electric pools and free dragoons to gain some charge, but the fastest way is to let an [[Adolescent Storm Drake]] use it's attacks on the player. [[Storm Drake Whelp]]s can also give some charge.

Freed dragoons may have this to say:
*{{text|say|<cough> I'm good.}}
*{{text|say|Thanks, <class>. I'll be fine.}}
*{{text|say|Go on ahead, I can make it from here.}}
*{{text|say|7th Legion Dragoon says: Is the Admiral okay?}}

==Progression==
{{Stormheim (Alliance)}}
