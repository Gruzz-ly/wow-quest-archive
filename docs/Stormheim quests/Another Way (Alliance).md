Defeat Gunnlaug Scaleheart in [[Hrydshal]], then climb to the top of the tower.

==Description==
Well, the bridge option is out. You still got that grapple launcher handy?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
Well, we made it this far...

==Completion==
Well, there's no stopping you, is there?
