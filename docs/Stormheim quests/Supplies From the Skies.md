==Objectives==
Gather 5 Skyfire First Aid Kits.
* [[Skyfire First Aid Kit]] x5

==Description==
Are you feeling alright? Say 'ah.'

<Mishka attempts to depress your tongue with a damp twig.>

Sorry... we are in desperate need of medical supplies here. The infirmary on the Skyfire was well-stocked, but it's all scattered to the winds now.

Anything you can salvage from the wreck will save lives!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|14|60|}}

==Progress==
Did you find anything?

==Completion==
Just in time! I was about to start bandaging wounds with leaves!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Boarded!]], [[Assault and Battery]], and [[See Ya Later, Oscillator]] before heading out.

Head downhill to the wreck and start killing [[Forsaken Bat-Rider]]s and [[Forsaken Deathstalker]]s. [[Skyfire First Aid Kit]]s are in Skyfire Medical Supplies crates all over the area. There's a Forsaken Deathstalker trying to use [[Pick Lock]] on a Treasure Chest towards the stern of the ship on the lower deck. It contains the [[Skyfire Engineer's Multitool]] and a [[Detailed Gunship Schematic]]. On the top deck, in what was the bridge and communications area of the ship, find [[Dread-Rider Malwick]], who holds the [[Transponder Battery]].

South of the ship, accessed from the upper deck, is another Forsaken camp. The [[Crystal Oscillator]] is found at the southernmost end of the quest area.
