==Objectives==
Defeat the Drekirjar Champion in [[Hrydshal]], then climb to the top of the tower.
* [[Gunnlaug Scaleheart]] slain
* Climb the Tower

==Description==
Wait, do you still have that grapple launcher? I think you can still get to the path if you can launch from the top of that tower. The gap doesn't seem too bad there.

Of course, we'll have to take out the big guy out front first. He looks tough, but I think we have a chance if we can flank him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Progress==
This should be a piece of cake!

==Completion==
What a fight!

And here I thought this place would be boring.

==Notes==
On attacking Gunnlaug:
:{{text|say|Gunnlaug Scaleheart|We are the masters of the storm!}}
When defeated:
:{{text|say|Dread-Rider Cullen|Now's our chance. Let's get up that tower!}}

==Progression==
