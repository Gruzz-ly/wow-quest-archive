==Objectives==
Kill Apothecary Curseheart in the [[Dread-Rider Incursion]]. 
* [[Apothecary Curseheart]] slain

==Description==
This map points out the strategic locations of the [[Forsaken]] forces around [[Greywatch]].  A marker to the east indicates an apothecary camp where Dread-Riders are being supplied from.

If you were to take out the apothecary in charge of creating this plague, it could stem the invasion and prevent the Dread-Riders from spreading the plague any further.

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What is it?

==Completion==
To think that the Forsaken were brash enough to brew their blight in our own backyard. With the loss of their apothecary, their invasion force is left without teeth. 

You have done well, <name>.
