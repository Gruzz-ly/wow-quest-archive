==Objectives==
Find the warlock that has been irresponsibly summoning demons and obtain a written confession of his wrongdoings.
* [[Galius' Confession]]

==Description==
My location has to be kept secret, at least until I have proof of my innocence.

Thanks to the [[Wilfred Fizzlebang|legacy]] of my family name, any time some miserable warlock summons [[demon]]s they can't control, I get the blame.

The scene of my latest "crime" is a nearby cave, where unruly [[imp]]s and other nasty demons are roaming free. Find the lousy warlock who's responsible, and get him to write a confession.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you get a confession yet?

I can't come out of hiding until I can prove my innocence.

==Completion==
This writing is a bit difficult to decipher, but I think all the pertinent information is included.

Armed with this confession, I should be able to prove my innocence and focus on more pressing matters.

==Notes==
The path leading to the entrance of [[Felscale Cavern]] is located southeast of [[Forsaken Foothold]]. {{co|39.2|36.7|Stormheim}}

;Galius
:What do you want, warlock? Can't you see I'm busy?

:{{gossip|Who summoned all these imps?}}
::Uh... not me. Definitely not me.

::Like I told the guards in [[Dalaran]], it's probably the Fizzlebang girl. Just like her brother, always summoning a mess of demons she can't control.

::{{gossip|Lulubelle says you're to blame.}}
:::She would say that, wouldn't she? Further proof that you can't trust a Fizzlebang!

:{{gossip|Confess your crimes!}}
::{{text|yell|Galius Miremoore|Crimes? The only thing I am guilty of is being the most powerful warlock in all of [[Azeroth]]!}}
::{{text|yell|Galius Miremoore|Come minions, aid me in battle against this accuser!}}
::{{text|yell|Galius Miremoore|Minions...?}}
::{{text|say|Galius Miremoore|Stop, please! I'll pen a confession, assuming you didn't break my writing hand...}}

;Galius's gossip
:I gave you what you wanted, now leave me be!
