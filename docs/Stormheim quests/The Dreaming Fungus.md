==Objectives==
Collect 12 Soulthorn Vines in the [[Runewood]].
* [[Soulcap]] (12)

==Description==
So an outsider would seek to be judged by the ancient rulers of the [[vrykul]]? Curious, this. Know that they will not take to your presence kindly, stranger.

If you are so hasty to meet judgment, you can call them forth with a ritual of wakening. To complete this ritual, you will require an aromatic to burn and an offering to present.

A plant grows in the Runewood that will make a suitable incense. Gather it, and I will instruct you further.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
What do you bring?

==Completion==
Yes, this Soulthorn should be adequate for your ritual.

Speak with me once you are ready to proceed and I will guide you further.

==Notes==
*Soulcaps are looted from [[Soulthorn]].
