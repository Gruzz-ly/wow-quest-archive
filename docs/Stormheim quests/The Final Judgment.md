==Objectives==
Defeat [[Runeseer Faljar]] in [[Haustvald]].
* Runeseer Faljar confronted

==Description==
In my fragmented state, I captured glimpses of a hero meting out justice to the corrupted mystics of [[Haustvald]].  I see now, this hero was you, <class>.

I know you seek my judgment, but my spirit is still fragmented.  As we speak, Runeseer Faljar is calling upon dark, forbidden magics in an attempt to banish my spirit to [[Helheim]].  If he succeeds, your trial will be lost.

My connection here is fading.  Go, there is little time!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|19|40|}}
|q1=|Ashildir's Unending Courage
}}

* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
I cannot believe this fate...

I am sorry, outsider, for I had underestimated Faljar's power.

That he could banish us here... is unthinkable.

==Notes==
Get to the runestone:
: {{text|say|Ashildir|You have defiled the old ways, mystic!  The [[God-King]] is not worthy of the [[Halls of Valor]]!}}
: {{text|say|Runeseer Faljar|I spit on your ancient rites, shieldmaiden!}}
: {{text|say|Ashildir|Champion!  Destroy this usurper, and I will grant you my judgment!}}

;Aggro
: {{text|say|Runeseer Faljar|You think to stop me?  I am the master of the vengeful dead!}}

;First Runic Bulwark
: {{text|bossemote|Shatter the [[Empowered Runestone (object)|runestone]] to interrupt Runeseer Faljar's Runic Bulwark!}}
: {{text|say|Ashildir|The runestone grants him power, champion.  Destroy it!}}

;Bonespeaker Drudges summoned
: {{text|say|Runeseer Faljar|You were a fool to meddle. My armies are eternal!}}
: ''Faljar summons four Bonespeaker Drudges, but Ashildir immediately counters:''
: {{text|say|Ashildir|Sisters, to arms!  Show this coward the meaning of valor!}}
: ''Four [[Valkyra Shieldmaiden]]s spawn and engage the skeletons, keeping them busy.''

;Second Runic Bulwark

: {{text|say|Ashildir|He's empowering another runestone!}}


: {{text|say|Runeseer Faljar|Enough of this!}}
: ''Faljar casts Sigil of Binding, rooting the player and shieldmaidens in place.''
: {{text|say|Ashildir|No! This power... it's too strong!}}
: {{text|say|Runeseer Faljar|I would see you banished before I allow you to grant judgment to an outsider!}}
: {{text|say|Ashildir|No... you can't...}}
: {{text|say|Runeseer Faljar|I can. You have sealed your fate, shieldmaiden.  You and this... outsider.}}
: {{text|say|Runeseer Faljar|Enjoy your eternity of damnation. Helheim awaits!}}
: ''Thrusting his arm upwards, Faljar entraps his enemies as purple glowing souls, which fly over and down into the portal to Helheim!''
: ''On the other side, it's just Ashildir and the player, who has become a Lost Soul, a ghostly image of their corporal self.''
: {{text|say|Ashildir|I am sorry, hero. I have doomed us both.}}
