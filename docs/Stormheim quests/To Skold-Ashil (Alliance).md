==Objectives==
Meet with [[Commander Lorna Crowley]] in [[Crowley's Overlook]]. 

==Description==
We have her now!  According to these reports, [[Sylvanas]]' forces are after something in [[Skold-Ashil]] - a [[vrykul]] town not far from [[Greywatch|here]].  We must make our way there and track her down.

I had previously dispatched Commander Lorna Crowley and a detachment of [[Gilneas Brigade]] to scout the position.  Meet up with her there and find out what Sylvanas is after.

Meanwhile, I will muster the fleet to assault their outpost.  We will have justice if I have to reduce their camp to rubble!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,480 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So the cavalry has arrived? 

Good, we must make haste if we wish to uncover Sylvanas' plot before it comes to bear.

==Progression==
