==Objectives==
Defeat 15 Bonespeaker vrykul or their allies in [[Haustvald]].
* Bonespeaker allies slain (15)

==Description==
The crimes of these ritualists must not go unpunished, but we cannot be their executioners.  The [[rune magic]] they practice grants them untold power over the dead.

You, however, are not dead, and I can sense great power from you.  Take the fight to these heretics, and show [[Ashildir]] that you are truly worthy of her judgment!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
* 15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
Have you sufficiently bloodied your blade, <Class>?

==Completion==
Your glorious battle honors the [[Valkyra]] queen.

==Notes==
*Kill: [[Ancient Bonethrall]]s, [[Ancient Boneservant]]s, [[Bonespeaker Carver]]s, [[Bonespeaker Cleaver]]s, and [[Bonespeaker Mystic]]s.

==Progression==
