==Objectives==
Meet with [[Nathanos Blightcaller]] in [[Dreadwake's Landing]].

==Description==
Uh, are these guys friendlies? I guess it's a good sign they haven't tried to eat [[Duchess]]... yet.

Anyway, I have orders. Nathanos caught up with the [[dark ranger]]s, who were sent forward aboard [[the Oblivion]] on a secret mission from [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Lady Sylvanas]] herself! Unfortunately the [[Alliance]] caught wind of our plan, and now [[Genn Greymane|Greymane]] is attacking the outpost!

We could really use you over there, <name>. Duchess can take you there, just give me the word.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}} (at level 100)
*1,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Finally someone competent arrives at this sorry excuse for an outpost.

Our efforts to complete Sylvanas's mission are at a standstill, but now we have even more pressing matters on our hands.

==Notes==
;On approach
{{text|say|Dread-Rider Cullen|Psst! Hey, <name>, over here!}}

Talk to Cullen again:
{{Dialogue|
Nathanos has requested your presence in Dreadwake's Landing.

Ready to go?
