==Objectives==
Find [[Lulubelle Fizzlebang]] in [[Stormheim]].

==Description==
I have reason to believe that [[Wilfred Fizzlebang]]'s sister has made her way to Stormheim.

If she has half his power, but at least twice his intelligence, then we just might succeed in summoning the [[eredar]] twins.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You're the council's new leader, aren't you? I could tell by your weapon. I bet you have an amazing story to tell about how you got it.

My name's Lulubelle, or Lulu for short. But, uh... I'd appreciate if you didn't mention to anyone that you saw me, ok?

==Progression==
