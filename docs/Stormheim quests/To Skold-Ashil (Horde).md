==Objectives==
Meet with the dark rangers in [[Ranger's Foothold]], outside of [[Skold-Ashil]].

==Description==
Thanks to your initiative, <class>, the situation at [[Dreadwake's Landing]] is under control. We have no time to rest on our laurels, however - [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]]'s mission must still be carried out.

The dark rangers are heading up operations in Skold-Ashil from the tower overlooking the river junction. Seek them out there, and see if you can aid in completing this task.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}} (at level 100)
*1,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You seem surprised to find me here? I was surprised as well, to find that my forces were unable to even breach the city of these cursed vrykul!

The time has come to employ some more different tactics, and your arrival couldn't have been more fortuitous.

==Notes==
After accepting the quest, Nathanos has gossip:
{{Dialogue|I could feel the explosion from here!

That Gilnean bastard never knew what him him!}}

At the Ranger's Foothold, [[Ranger Captain Areiel]] and two [[Dark Ranger (Stormheim)|Dark Rangers]] are kneeling before Sylvanas.
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|So you mean to tell me that not only were you not able to secure the vault, you were unable to even overtake the village?}}
:{{text|say|Ranged Captain Areiel|My Dark Lady, the vrykul here have proven more formidable than anticipated.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Formidable for you, perhaps. We'll see how they fare when confronted by the Banshee Queen!}}
:{{text|say|Ranged Captain Areiel|Of course, Dark Lady.}}

==Progression==
