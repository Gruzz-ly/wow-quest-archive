==Notes==

On accept, a cinematic plays.

===Stage 1: Prepare for Battle===
:''Man the Deck Guns''
* Man the Deck Guns
As the scenario begins, a cinematic of the ''Skyfire'' unloading a volley on the Forsaken fleet from above the clouds plays. After the scenario:
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|Any luck contacting the fleet?}}
:{{text|say|Tinkmaster Overspark|It's no use - the weather systems around Stormheim are too strong. I can't get a signal through.}}
:{{text|yell|Sky Admiral Rogers|Cease bombardment!}}
:{{text|yell|Sky Admiral Rogers|Man the guns! All hands, prepare for contact with the enemy!}}
:{{text|yell|Sky Admiral Rogers yells: Gryphon riders, first wing, prepare to descend! Second wing, hold position!}}

Head down to the main deck and hop in one of the Skyfire Deck Guns.

===Stage 2: Fire at Will!===
:''Use the Deck Guns to shoot down Forsaken Dreadwings''
* Shoot down Forsaken Dreadwings x30
The guns have two abilities:
* {{abilities|Flak Blast|Fire a high-explosive round that blasts enemies from the sky.|cd=1 sec|notes=Instant.}}
* {{abilities|Rapid Fire|A rapid-fire barrage of flak blasts.|cd=10 sec|notes=Channeled.}}
[[Forsaken Dreadwing]] bats start appearing. A single Flak Blast will one-shot them. On a timer (roughly once a minute), the deck guns will get frozen.
:{{text|bossemote|An Icebound Dreadnought freezes the gun solid!}}
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Boarding party on the deck!}}
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Main cannons, prepare for a second volley as we breach the cloud-line.}}
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Bring us in!}}
Kill the [[Icebound Dreadnought]] to thaw the guns, then get back to shooting.
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Enemy fliers incoming! All guns, fire at will!}}

===Stage 3: Justice from Above===
:''Head below decks and use a Skyfire Parachute to board the Forsaken ships and defeat their captains.''
* Defeat [[Deathweaver Cassandra|the captain of The Banshee's Wail]]
* Defeat [[Cauldronmaster Mills|the captain of The Black Rose]]
* Defeat [[Dread-Captain Tattersail|the captain of The Windrunner]]

:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Legionnaires, move out! Storm those ships and find Sylvanas!}}
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Gryphon riders, back them up!}}
Head below deck and follow the arrows. Marines will chime in:
:{{text|say|Skyfire Marine|Parachutes are downstairs, <sir/ma'am>.}}
:{{text|say|Skyfire Marine|The legionnaires are deploying from the rear deck. They'll be glad to fight alongside you!}}
There are four Skyfire Parachutes on the rear deck, near some [[7th Legion Paratrooper]]s. Grab one to jump off and land on the poopdeck of ''The Banshee's Wail''.
:{{text|say|Commander Lorna Crowley|Slay these unholy creatures! For the Alliance!}}
After finishing off [[Deathweaver Cassandra]], Crowley lands:
:{{text|say|Commander Lorna Crowley|Hop on. We'll check every ship if we have to!}}
:''She flies to ''The Black Rose''.''
:{{text|say|Commander Lorna Crowley|Watch yourself down there... that doesn't look like Westfall stew in those cauldrons.}}
Same as before, this time with [[Black Rose Apothecary|Black Rose Apothecaries]] and [[Cauldronmaster Mills]].
:{{text|say|Commander Lorna Crowley|No sign of her. Let's keep looking.}}
:''Crowley flies to ''The Windrunner''.''
:{{Text|say|Commander Lorna Crowley|Those are royal guards... This must be her flagship. Seize the captain!}}
Same as the last two, but this time with two elite [[Royal Dreadguard]]s and [[Dread-Captain Tattersail]]. Get her to below 20% health to start the next stage.

===Stage 4: Bats in the Bomb Bay===
:''Remove Volatile Flares from Skyfire bomb bay.''

* [[Volatile Flare]]s removed (7)
:{{text|say|Commander Lorna Crowley|Wait! She may have information!}}
:{{text|yell|Dread-Captain Tattersail|You are too late... The Dark Lady is already gone...}}
:{{text|yell|Dread-Captain Tattersail|And your ship is already doomed!}}
:{{text|say|Commander Lorna Crowley|The Skyfire is being overrun. Come on, we have to help!}}
Hop on Crowley's gryphon:
:{{text|say|Commander Lorna Crowley|So many bats...}}
:{{text|say|Commander Lorna Crowley|They're trying to bring down the ship from inside.}}
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Hero! <cough> Get those chemical flares away from the ammo!}}
Crowley drops the player off at the rear deck balcony. Head in and start killing [[Forsaken Bat-Rider]]s, [[Forsaken Dreadwing]]s and [[Forsaken Deathstalker]]s, and interacting with Volatile Flares. Fill up the bar, but it's a lost cause...

===Final Stage: Last Stand===
[[File:Nathanos vs Genn.jpg|thumb|Genn fighting Nathanos.]]
:''Defeat Nathanos Blightcaller on the deck of the Skyfire.''
* Defeat [[Nathanos Blightcaller]]
:{{text|yell|Nathanos Blightcaller|Slay them all! For the Dark Lady!}}
:{{text|say|Commander Lorna Crowley|It's no use, the ammunition has caught fire! Quickly, up the stairs!}}
:{{text|say|Commander Lorna Crowley|I'll cover you. Go help Greymane!}}
Up on deck, [[Genn Greymane]] and [[Nathanos Blightcaller]] are facing off. Engage Nathanos:
:{{text|yell|Genn Greymane|Monsters! You have no place in this world!}}
:{{text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|You call us monsters? How rich.}}
At 50%:
:{{text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Stop holding back, old man! Show us the real you.}}
:{{text|yell|Genn Greymane|Rrgghhh... ENOUGH!}}
:''Greymane obliges and shifts to his worgen form.''
:{{text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Ah, there you are!}}
At 10% health, a cutscene takes place, ending the fight.
:''The ''Skyfire'' flies away in flames, shaking from explosions.''

===Finale===
On the other side of the cutscene, the player wakes up in the [[Skyfire Triage Camp]].
:{{text|say|Mishka|<He's/She's> waking up!}}
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Good. Can <he/she> fight?}}
The storyline continues with [[Supplies From the Skies]], [[Boarded!]], [[Assault and Battery]], and [[See Ya Later, Oscillator]] from the questgivers in camp.
