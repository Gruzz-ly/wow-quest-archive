==Objectives==
Defeat [[Helya]] in the [[Maw of Souls]] dungeon, then return to [[Havi]] in [[Valdisdall]]
*Stop the [[Naglfar]]

==Description==
In a time before memory, the Naglfar was the prize of Helya's fleet. It would seem that it has lived on to serve her once more.

Now, the dread ship sails the sea of souls, and cuts through the mist unseen by the living. The [[kvaldir]] must have a way to summon her, and this is what you must seek.

Find her berth and board the Naglfar. Put an end to the dread ship, and the [[soul]]s of the [[Tideskorn]] may be redeemed.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|q1=|Helbreaker Amice
|q2=|Helbreaker Epaulets
|q3=|Helbreaker Spaulders
|q4=|Helbreaker Pauldrons
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|77|60|}}
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
With the dread ship sundered, the souls of the dead will know their judgement. 

Odyn will have his champions, and the Tideskorn will have their honor.

==Progression==
{{Stopping the Naglfar}}
