==Objectives==
*Transponder Charged

==Description==
:{{Text|say|[[Odyn]]|The [[gnome|children]] of [[Mimiron]] have crafted a clever toy they claim can harness the power of the storm. Go forth and test their handiwork in battle.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
:{{Text|say|Odyn|A most amusing device. But cleverness is useless without strength of arms!}}

==Notes==
The only way to complete this is to be attacked by the dragons in the cave. If you happen to be a ranged class, there is one dragon up on a ledge that will only use ranged attacks if aggroed with a ranged attack. The lighting tornados are great to follow to fill your bar. A hunter could also misdirect the aggro to their pet and reduce damage to themselves that way.

==Patch changes==
