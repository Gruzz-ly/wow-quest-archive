==Objectives==
Slay 12 [[Forsaken Bat-Rider]]s or [[Forsaken Deathstalker]]s.
* Forsaken slain (12)

==Description==
Glad to see you survived the crash. Unfortunately, so did most of the enemy's boarding party.

Just the thought of those monsters setting foot on my ship makes me sick. Wipe them out, <name>. For my crew... For King Wrynn...

For the Alliance!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}

==Progress==
There will be no peace with those monsters running free.

==Completion==
Don't worry about the ship - it's just wood and metal.

The Skyfire lives on as long as we keep fighting.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Supplies From the Skies]], [[Assault and Battery]], and [[See Ya Later, Oscillator]] before heading out.

Head downhill to the wreck and start killing [[Forsaken Bat-Rider]]s and [[Forsaken Deathstalker]]s. [[Skyfire First Aid Kit]]s are in Skyfire Medical Supplies crates all over the area. There's a Forsaken Deathstalker trying to use [[Pick Lock]] on a Treasure Chest towards the stern of the ship on the lower deck. It contains the [[Skyfire Engineer's Multitool]] and a [[Detailed Gunship Schematic]]. On the top deck, in what was the bridge and communications area of the ship, find [[Dread-Rider Malwick]], who holds the [[Transponder Battery]].

South of the ship, accessed from the upper deck, is another Forsaken camp. The [[Crystal Oscillator]] is found at the southernmost end of the quest area.
