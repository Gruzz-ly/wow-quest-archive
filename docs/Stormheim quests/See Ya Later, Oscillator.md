==Objectives==
Collect the Crystal Oscillator.
* [[Crystal Oscillator]]

==Description==
Those jawless mooks are actually trying to salvage parts from our ship! They can't possibly appreciate superior [[gnomish technology]]... Perhaps its shiny nature is appealing to their simple inclinations.

In any case, I need a crystal oscillator for our new transponder. It's the shiniest part of the whole system, they're bound to have it set aside somewhere!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|14|60|}}

==Progress==
Did you find the oscillator?

==Completion==
<Overspark examines the crystal carefully.>

Yep, still shiny.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Supplies From the Skies]], [[Boarded!]], and [[Assault and Battery]] before heading out.

Head downhill to the wreck and start killing [[Forsaken Bat-Rider]]s and [[Forsaken Deathstalker]]s. [[Skyfire First Aid Kit]]s are in Skyfire Medical Supplies crates all over the area. There's a Forsaken Deathstalker trying to use [[Pick Lock]] on a Treasure Chest towards the stern of the ship on the lower deck. It contains the [[Skyfire Engineer's Multitool]] and a [[Detailed Gunship Schematic]]. On the top deck, in what was the bridge and communications area of the ship, find [[Dread-Rider Malwick]], who holds the [[Transponder Battery]].

South of the ship, accessed from the upper deck, is another Forsaken camp. The [[Crystal Oscillator]] is found at the southernmost end of the quest area.
