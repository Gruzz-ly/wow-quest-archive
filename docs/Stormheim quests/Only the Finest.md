==Objectives==
Collect 18 Patches of Fine Goat Hair from [[Silvertail Mountain Goat]]s in [[Nastrondir]].
*[[Patch of Fine Goat Hair]] (18)

==Description==
Say, you're a pretty good [[hunter]], eh? Maybe you could help these [[Highmountain tauren|tauren]] out by stocking them with some rare furs. I'm sure they'd appreciate it when they got back!

I hear that [[Stormheim]] goat hair can be woven into all kinds of things. The rarest are from the silver-tail goats. I think I saw some in that mountain over there.

Why don't you go and fetch some? I'm sure them tauren would pay you handsomely!

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Make sure to get the good stuff!

==Completion==
You're back? 

I mean... hey, you're back!

Well, the tauren haven't come back yet, but no worries, I'll take that stuff off your hands! Let me show you some of my prime trade goods.
