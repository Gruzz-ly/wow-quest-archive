==Objectives==
Collect the heads of the [[Slash Gutspill|Gutspill]], [[Gro Rumblehoof|Rumblehoof]], and [[Felskorn]] champions in [[Valley of the Sword]].
* [[Gutspill's Head]]
* [[Rumblehoof's Head]]
* Tideskorn Champion's Head(cannot be completed)

==Description==
The watcher [[Yotnar]] keeps the vault, and he is a fickle one. Challengers come from far and wide seeking the trials, but the watcher chooses not to see.

If you wish to catch his eye, show him you are worth being seen.

Some of these challengers await in camps throughout the Valley of the sword. Bring their heads to Yotnar, so that he may see them, and you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Progress==
An ironic gift you bring me, challenger.

==Completion==
It is a shame to see the first worthy challenger for the [[Aegis of Aggramar|Aegis]] treating the trials with such disrespect. Such hubris cannot win the Aegis, for the gods will surely strike him down for his arrogance.

You, however, seem different. You have shown that you are a worthy challenger.

I will allow you to begin the trials.

==Notes==
;Killing the Gutspill Champion
:{{text|say|Slash Gutspill|Not... possible...}}

;Killing the Rumblehoof Champion
:{{text|say|Gro Rumblehoof|You challenge me? I'll crush you like a bug!}}
:{{text|say|Gro Rumblehoof|I will kill... you... ack!}}

The Champion of the Felskorn is absent from his camp. On approach:
:{{text|say|Havi|The vrykul champion is nowhere to be found. Oh well, the heads of the other champions will have to suffice.}}

Upon approaching the Vault, [[God-King Skovald]]—the missing Felskorn Champion—emerges, holding Yotnar's head.
:{{text|say|God-King Skovald|Your ancient rites and rituals mean nothing to me, Yotnar!}}
:{{text|say|God-King Skovald|I will conquer your trials and take the Aegis for my own!}}
:{{text|say|God-King Skovald|Cower here in your cave, while it still stands}}
:''Skovald throws Yotnar's head on the ground, then escapes through a demonic portal.''
:{{text|say|Yotnar|The gods will not tolerate your actions, vrykul! You will answer for your heresy!}}

If the player is a [[warrior]] with the [[Warswords of the Valarjar]] equipped, Yotnar will say this as the player approaches:
:{{text|say|Yotnar|Those swords, I'd recognize Odyn's work anywhere. Aid me, warrior!}}

==Progression==
