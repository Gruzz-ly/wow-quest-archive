==Objectives==
Go to the top of the boulder and use the Stormforged Grapple Launcher to launch over the wall at [[Hrydshal]].
*Grapple over the wall

==Description==
That thing looks like it's got the range to get us over the wall. There's a good spot to hook onto right past us - just climb to the top of this big boulder and you should be able to spot it.

Once you're inside, do me a favor and see if you can distract the guards so I can slip through. I'll see what else I can find out about these [[vrykul]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}} (at level 100)
*1,500 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Completion==
Those vrykul were so distracted seeing someone flying through their village, they never noticed me slip by.

I hope that didn't get you too much unwanted attention.

==Notes==
