==Objectives==
Use the Branch of the Runewood to send 10 weakened Restless Ancestors back to the earth.
* [[Restless Ancestor]] returned to the earth (10)
* [[Branch of the Runewood]] (provided)

==Description==
I would ask a favor, outsider.

As you step through the graves of ancient heroes, you will no doubt come across spirits of the restless dead, agitated by the Bonespeakers misdeeds. They must be returned to the earth where they are buried, so that they may be judged as well.

Take this bough - it carries with it the essence of the Runewood. Channel its power into a weakened spirit, and it will return to rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
I see you carry a branch of the [[Runewood]]. Then it was you who laid the spirit to rest?

Though I do now know your purpose, outsider, I appreciate what you have done for our people.

==Notes==
Attack the mobs below 50% and then use the quest item.
