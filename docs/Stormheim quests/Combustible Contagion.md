==Objectives==
Burn the Forsaken Blight Caches near [[Greywatch]]. 
* Northern Plague Cache Burned
* Eastern Plague Cache Burned
* Western Plague Cache Burned
* [[Blazing Torch (Stormheim)]] (provided)

==Description==
It is true that we may have a lead on [[Sylvanas]].  Though I want nothing more than to get my hands on the Banshee Queen, the situation here at Greywatch requires immediate attention.

Yesterday, a regiment of guards returned with word of [[Forsaken]] forces in the woods. Several of them bore signs of a blight, similar to the one we endured in [[Gilneas peninsula|Gilneas]].  It would appear these Forsaken seek to unleash this blight upon Greywatch.

Seek out their caches and destroy them, before the blight overtakes us!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have the caches been taken care of?

==Completion==
The deed is done. 

You have done a great service to the [[worgen]] of Greywatch, <name>.

==Progression==
{{To Catch a Banshee}}
