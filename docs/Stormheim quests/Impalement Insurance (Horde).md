==Objectives==
Use the High Explosive Grenades to destroy the Harpoon Launchers atop the walls in Hrydshal.
* [[Harpoon Launchers Destroyed]] (7)
* [[High Explosive Grenades]] (provided)

==Description==
It looks like the elements aren't the only thing you'll need to worry about going up that path. Those harpoon launchers on the wall look pretty nasty, and unless we take them out first, they're likely to make short work of anyone trying to scale that path.

They're up on top of the walls, so you'll need to use that grapple launcher to get to them. Just try not to end up drake food!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Completion==
We won't have to worry about those scrap heaps anymore!

It looks like we've got a hitch in our plan though. That bridge was the only way up.

==Notes==
When getting close to the quest giver at the end:

:{{text|yell|God-King Skovald|Only I possess the power of the [[Thorignir]]! The [[Aegis of Aggramar|Aegis]] will be mine!}}
:{{text|yell|God-King Skovald|Give up, outsider. You are not worthy of the [[Halls of Valor]].}}
:{{text|say|Dread-Rider Cullen|I feel like that guy having a dragon is a bad thing.}}

I hope you enjoy blowing things up as much as I do!
