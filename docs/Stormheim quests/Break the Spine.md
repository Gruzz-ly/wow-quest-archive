==Objectives==
Defeat Garzareth, Karuas, Muorg and Ravathes in [[Gates of Valor]].
* [[Garzareth]] slain
* [[Karuas]] slain
* [[Muorg]] slain
* [[Ravathes]] slain

==Description==
To lead his tainted forces, the [[God-King]] has enlisted demons of great power to act as his lieutenants. If we wish to end his assault, we will need to take their leaders.

These demons are too powerful for most mortals to face, but with the power of Stormheim at your disposal, they will prove no match for you.

Take them down, and shatter the spine of Skovald's offensive!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
Are the leaders slain?

==Completion==
With their [[fel]] leaders slain, the God-King's forces will scatter.

Still, we are not finished here. So long as the demons continue to assault the gates, Stormheim will not be safe.

==Notes==
;Upon approach (Warrior only)
