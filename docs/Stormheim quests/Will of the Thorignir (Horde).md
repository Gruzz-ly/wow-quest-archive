==Objectives==
Meet with [[Dread-Rider Cullen]] outside of [[Hrydshal]] to begin the trial of the [[Thorignir]].

==Description==
In the summit of storms the dragons await. Born of the gods, they will test your will.

They roost above Hrydshal, where their children serve the [[Drekirjar]]. But they are no allies to man or [[vrykul]], and so you must earn their blessing as they see fit.

A friend of yours awaits in Hrydshal, no doubt searching for the answers you now possess. Go to her, and together, you will test your might against the storm!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}} (at level 100)
*1,500 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Completion==
These vrykul are so boring! Why does [[Nathanos Blightcaller|Nathanos]] send me on missions like this?

I hope you've come to stir up some trouble here.
