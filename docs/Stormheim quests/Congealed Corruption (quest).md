== Objectives ==
* [[Fel Reaver Core Fragment]] (12)
* Demons slain (10)
* [[Amorphius]] slain

== Description ==
: {{text|say|[[Odyn]]|The shattered core of a fallen [[fel reaver]] is giving rise to a host of aberrations! Recover the core fragments before the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] can salvage their creation!}}

== Rewards ==
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

== Completion ==
: {{text|say|Odyn|Such massive Legion war machines are ill-suited to this terrain. They should think twice before sending another!}}

== Notes ==
Triggers at [[Blackbeak Overlook]] in [[Stormheim]] during [[Legion Invasion]]s. Amorphius is at the bottom of the waterfall by the fel reaver, demons are [[Filthy Scavenger]]s and [[Felbound Guardian]]s.

The very best plan is to only target Filthy Scavenger: they'll drop [[Salvage Sack]]s on the ground which will contain core fragments. If you can't fly however, you'll likely have to fight your way down to get to Amorphius and likely get what you need that way.

== Patch changes ==
