==Objectives==
Search the Shipwreck Debris in [[Helmouth Shallows]] for [[Havi]]'s clue.
* [[Corroded Maritime Plaque|Havi's clue found]]

==Description==
The [[kvaldir]] exist to spite [[Odyn]], and it is here their spiteful work is done. They rob the souls of the living - the souls not yet judged - thus robbing Odyn of his champions.

They bring them here to transport to [[Helya]], though the mists obscure any indications of how.

You seem to fare the mists well. Perhaps if you search the wreckage in the bay, the answer may present itself. You outsiders seem to have a knack for uncovering the most hidden of secrets.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
Have you found answers, or more questions?

==Completion==
The [[Naglfar]]...

So Helya's kvaldir can navigate the mists?

==Notes==
