==Objectives==
Collect 8 Ancient Tideskorn Blades from the [[kvaldir]] in [[Helmouth Shallows]].
* [[Ancient Tideskorn Blade]] (8)

==Description==
[[Soul]]s are not the only plunder [[Helya]] craves, and the kvaldir are ever eager to please.

Among their spoils are the venerable blades of fallen heroes who dared stand against Helya's minions. These blades belong in a place of honor, not among their wretched kind.

Reclaim the blades, for the honor of the [[Tideskorn]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
Do you have the blades?

==Completion==
I will see that these blades are returned where they belong.

The dead smile upon you, outsider.

==Progression==
