==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Spitefeather.jpg|Spitefeather|A giant eagle that hunts the Stormtalon Foothills.}}
Lure down and defeat [[Spitefeather]] to collect Spitefeather's Beak in the [[Stormtorn Foothills]].
*[[Spitefeather's Beak]]

==Description==
Care to help settle a bet, chum?

Those [[Highmountain tauren|tauren]] are [[Skyhorn]], and they fancy themselves big-time hunters. I bet them a pretty penny that they wouldn't be able to take out some of the biggest beasts in [[Stormheim]].

If you take em out before they do, I'll split the wager. Deal?

The first is a big [[eagle]] nesting in the foothills. They call him Spitefeather. You can bait him with some meat, but he's up pretty high, so you'll need a grapple gun to get there. I think there's one of them layin around here...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You got my trophy yet?

==Completion==
So you took him out, eh? Those tauren are gonna be so jealous when they get back!  

Naturally, you'll have to wait till the tauren get back and pay their wager before I can give you your cut. But in the meantime, I've got another target for you.
