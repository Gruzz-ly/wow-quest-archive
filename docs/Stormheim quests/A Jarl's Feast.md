{{Dialogue|
So goes a good leader, and a good friend. I look forward to battling with him in the [[Halls of Valor]] when my time comes.

{{gossip|Why the boat?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
It was once our custom to send a Jarl like this into the sea and set the boat ablaze. But since the mists claimed our shores, we dare not send him out lest he return as a [[kvaldir]].

{{gossip|I want to ask something else.}}
}}}}

Everyone has the same random gossip texts：
*Have you come to drink or fight? Or both?
*Your cloths, they are funny to me.
*The Jarl will he missed by some Not me, but by some.
*The Jarl goes now to serve Odyn in the Valarjar. Let us drink to their good fortune.
*Odyn shines upon you?
*Another Jarl drinks now with Odyn. Between you and me, I never liked that Jarl.
*To be honest, I am going to miss that Jarl. They had some great feasts in their day.
*Why do you speak at me, little <class>?
*You are tiny.
*You have tiny hands.
