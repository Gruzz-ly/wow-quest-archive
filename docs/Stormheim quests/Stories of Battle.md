==Objectives==
Collect 8 verses of [[Ashilvara]] from [[Priestess of Eyir|Priestesses of Eyir]] in [[Skold-Ashil]].
* [[Verse of Ashilvara]] (Provided) (8)

==Description==
The writings carried by the priestess appear to be the first part of an epic poem describing the history of [[Ashildir]], the ancient queen of the [[Valkyra]].

If Ashildir has a connection to the [[shieldmaiden]]s here, you may be able to use that to your advantage.

The answer to her involvement likely lies within the remaining text.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
* 14800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This appears to be the last verse.

==Completion==
The verses of the poem unfold the tale of [[Ashildir]] founding the [[shieldmaiden]]s and bringing them to [[Skold-Ashil]].

If these shieldmaidens revere the [[Valkyra]] queen as this would suggest, your dealings with her in [[Helheim]] may prove advantageous.

==Progression==
Alliance:
{{To Catch a Banshee}}

Horde:
{{The Dark Lady's Bidding}}
