==Objectives==
Examine 6 Engraved Vrykul Shields in [[Skold-Ashil]].
* Examine Engraved Shields (6)

==Description==
Our goal lies within that vault, <class>. I don't have time to explain in detail - just know that it is vital to the Forsaken that we succeed.

The [[shieldmaiden]]s have proven tenacious in their defense, but I believe there may be another way in. A chosen few of their order are allowed entrance, and I need you to find out how.

In the town I have seen intricately engraved shields which I believe are passed down from these champions. The scenes they depict may be the key to passing into the vault.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I would hope that you bring me some good news, <class>.

For both of our sake.

==Notes==
Upon accepting the quest, Sylvanas has gossip:
{{Dialogue|I must commend you on ending that miserable worgen, Greymane.

My only regret is that I was not there to witness his final throes.}}

Each shield shows a unique text when clicked.

First shield:
{{Dialogue|The engravings on the shield depict a goddess of the shieldmaidens, watching over them in battle.

Above her is inscribed the name "[[Eyir]]".}}

Second shield:
{{Dialogue|This shield appears to show various trials undergone by the warriors of [[Skold-Ashil]].

A depiction of the nearby temple adorns the center.}}

Third shield:
{{Dialogue|An image of a shieldmaiden is carved on this shield, kneeling before an elaborate spear.

The priestesses of the temple stand nearby, silently observing the rite.}}

Fourth shield:
{{Dialogue|The scene on this shield shows one of the shieldmaidens hovering above a statue of an ancient champion of Skold-Ashil.

The shieldmaiden is glowing with a radiant aura, and is held aloft by golden wings.}}

Fifth shield:
{{Dialogue|Upon this shield, an engraving of Eyir stands at the entrance to the titan vault.

She appears to be welcoming a winged champion of the shieldmaidens inside.}}

Sixth shield:
{{Dialogue|This shield bears an image of a winged shieldmaiden lifting the body of a fallen vrykul from a battlefield.

The shieldmaiden's image appears eerily similar to that of a [[Val'kyr]].}}
