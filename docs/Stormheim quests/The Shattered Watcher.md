==Objectives==
Collect the pieces of [[Yotnar]]'s body from [[Aggramar's Vault]].
* [[Yotnar's Left Arm]]
* [[Yotnar's Right Arm]]
* [[Yotnar's Left Foot]]
* [[Yotnar's Right Foot]]

==Description==
When your adversary - the one called [[Skovald]]- completed his first trial, he used his ill-begotten powers to sunder my physical body.

I cannot allow a contender to pass through the vault while I remain unwhole.

His forces have no doubt scattered my pieces through the plateau which they currently desecrate. Bring them back to me, so that I may properly guide your trial.
