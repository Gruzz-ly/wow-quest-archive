==Objectives==
Collect Broketooth's Ruby Amulet from [[Captain Broketooth]] on the ships near [[Dreyrgrot]].
* [[Broketooth's Ruby Amulet]]{{Co|76|49.6|Stormheim}}

==Description==
Unfortunately, we may have another problem. That mist seeping out of the ruins has affected the [[Red Blade|looting pirates]]. It's driven them [[Blood-Crazed Swashbuckler|quite mad]].

Only one of them seems to be unaffected - a captainly fellow with a very fine hat. He wears a large ruby amulet, which I believe protects him from the mist. You'll need it if you are to enter the tomb.

He may not give it up willingly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
We will need the amulet's protection to proceed.

==Completion==
You have the amulet! Most excellent!

Of course, that probably won't help you with the pirates that are already mad as hatters, but small victories, eh chap?

==Progression==
