==Objectives==
Collect a Stormforged Grapple Launcher from the [[Drekirjar Pathfinder]]s outside [[Hreidshallr]].
* [[Stormforged Grapple Launcher]]

==Description==
So some old magic vrykul is helping us out? I guess that's good, but this trial of yours might be tricky. You see, the only way up that mountain, is through those big walls. 

You know, the ones with the mean-looking drakes on them. 

I scouted a bit, but couldn't get too far without those drakes trying to make lunch out of poor Duchess. The vrykul have them trained, which can't be good.

I say we sneak in. I managed to snag a few grapple launchers earlier. Grab one and meet me outside the city walls.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
* 15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Progress==
Any luck with the grapple?

==Completion==
Yes, that should do quite nicely.

==Notes==

;Description
So you need some dragons, eh? Well if you want to get up that mountain, you'll have to go through that city.

I was able to scout a bit, but couldn't get too far without those drakes trying to make lunch out of poor [[Duchess]]. The vrykul have them trained, which can't be good for us.

I say we sneak in. The scouts outside are sporting some heavy-duty grapple launchers. How about we procure one?
