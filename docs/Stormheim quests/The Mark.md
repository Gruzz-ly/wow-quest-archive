==Objectives==
Prove your worth to the Valarjar, then receive the Mark of the Valkyra from Eyir.
*{{rep|Revered}} with the [[Valarjar]]
*Mark of the Valkyra received

==Description==
Your blade is powerful, but it has not yet met its full potential. The all-powerful [[Odyn]] in the [[Halls of Valor]] can bestow upon you his strength.

In order to seek this blessing, you must bring him a worthy tribute. I know where you may obtain such a gift, but in order to retrieve it you must first receive the mark of the Valkyra.

Prove yourself worthy of our mark, champion, then you may enter the [[Vault of Eyir]]- the [[Eyir|goddess]] will guide you from there.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|19|40}}

==Progress==
Greetings, champion. How go your trials?

==Completion==
<Ashildir nods knowingly.>

You are ready for the next step.

==Notes==
Inside the vault:
:{{Text|say|[[Eyir]]|Ashildir has told me of your exploits. You seek my mark so that you may impress [[Odyn]].}}
:{{Text|say|Eyir|Stand on the dais and we will begin.}}
:{{Text|say|Eyir|Kneel before me, mortal.}}

Target Eyir and <code>/kneel</code> before her:
:''The player is teleported to the center of the dais if not already on it and [[Chosen of Eyir]] float towards the center, casting a circular light symbol around the platform.''
:{{Text|say|Eyir|You have proven your worth as a [[Valkyra]], but the trials to come are arduous.}}
:{{Text|say|Eyir|Wear proudly our mark, and perhaps you will be worthy of Odyn's blessing.}}
:{{Text|say|Eyir|Now begone!}}

==Progression==
{{Balance of Power}}
