==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Stonefang.jpg|Stonefang|A massive basilisk terrorizing the vrykul of Stormheim.}}
Collect Stonefang's Jaw from [[Stonefang]] in [[Stonescar Gorge]].
* [[Stonefang's Jaw]]

==Description==
The second target is a [[basilisk]] called Stonefang that lives off the bank of the nearby river. 

I put a bigger wager on him, so if you can take him out I'll make sure you get a cut.

I'll need his jaw to verify the kill. Hurry, before those [[Highmountain tauren|tauren]] get him first!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you take him out?

==Completion==
Well, well. I half expected to find your statue on the riverbank. You're gonna get a nice payout once those tauren get back...

You haven't seen them around, have you?
