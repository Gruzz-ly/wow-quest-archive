==Objectives==
Collect 10 pieces of seaweed from [[Kvaldir Mistcaller]]s and [[Kvaldir Soulflayer|Soulflayer]]s in [[Helheim]].
* [[Kvaldir Seaweed]] (20)

==Description==
I'm not sure what yer doin' here, but ye have my thanks. If ye want to get any further, though, ye'll need to get past that foul dog, [[Guarm]].

I've tried meself a few times, and I think I have a plan. If we can get some of the seaweed these kvaldir wear, we might be able to trick the mutt. Guarm's mean, ye see, but not too smart.

What do ye say? Think ye can take on a few kvaldir?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|20}} (at level 100)
* 22,600 [[XP]] (at level 100)
*+150 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
Do ye have enough for a proper disguise?

==Completion==
Wait... ye killed how many kvaldir? Yer braver than I thought, outsider!

I'm sure [[Helya]] will see that neither ye nor I belong here once we get past that dog of hers.
