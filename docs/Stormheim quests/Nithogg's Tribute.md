==Objectives==
Collect 8 Intact Greatstag Antlers and 16 Pristine Eagle Tailfeathers in the [[Stormtorn Foothills]].
*[[Intact Greatstag Antler]] (8)
*[[Pristine Eagle Tailfeather]] (16)

==Description==
It looks like the [[ravenbear]]s have started gathering materials for some sort of tribute, but the [[storm drake]]s are keeping them from finishing what they started. From the looks of it, they're gathering fully intact [[stag]] horns and long tail feathers from the greatstags and [[eagle]]s nearby. It shouldn't take too long to gather the rest of what they need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
Ca-caw?

==Completion==
Caw! Caw! 

<The ravenbear chieftain flaps his wings excitedly when he sees the reagents you've brought.>
