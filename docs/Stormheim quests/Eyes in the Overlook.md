==Objectives==
Recover the SI:7 Intel from [[Spymaster Knockwhistle]] in [[Blackbeak Overlook]].
*[[SI:7 Intel]]

==Description==
Alliance personnel from the [[Skyfire]] were spotted parachuting into Blackbeak Overlook.

I was unable to confirm numbers or positions during my flyover, but I did see parachutes tangled in treetops and a LOT of ravenbears on the ground.

If anyone is up there, they must be laying low and keeping an eye on us.

I have posted a rider at the top of the overlook to keep watch while I press forward into [[Stormheim]].

- Liza Cullen, Dread-Rider - 1st Wing
