==Objectives==
Go to the top of the ridge and use the [[:Stormforged Grapple Launcher]] to launch over the wall at [[Hrydshal]].
* Grapple over the wall

==Description==
Now that you've got the launcher, we should be able to infiltrate the city. It looks like there's a good spot to grapple onto on the wall just past us. There's a vantage point on top of this ridge.

Once we're in, I'll try to slip past the guards and get a look at the mountain path. I'd appreciate if you could make some distractions for me. If all goes well, I'll meet up with you in the upper city. Good luck!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,480 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You should've seen the look on those [[vrykul]]s' faces when you came sailing over their wall! 

I could see that launcher coming in handy in a lot of places. You'd best hold on to it.
