==Objectives==
Gather 4 Ancient Dreyrgrot tablets from the pirate ships outside of [[Dreyrgrot]].
* [[Ancient Dreyrgrot Tablet]] (4)

==Description==
Well met, good chap!

I was on my way to study the [[Bilgefin|local murlocs]] when I stumbled upon these most peculiar ruins. [[Red Blade|Those pirates]] over yonder arrived first, and it appears they've unleashed some [[Blood-Thane Lucard|ancient evil]].

I would be remiss to let such an evil run rampant, but we should learn more of it before we proceed, lest we end up like those chaps.

I spied the crew bringing back some tablets from the ruins. If you can bring them to me, I may be able to decipher the nature of this evil.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* 150 [[reputation]] with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
How goes the hunt for knowledge?

==Completion==
Excellent! Luckily I brought a copy of the [[vrykul (language)|vrykul]] cipher that the [[Explorers' League|League]] procured from [[Northrend]].

I'll get to work on this straightforth! Let us hope the dialects are not too dissimilar.

==Notes==
There are four tablets in fixed locations: two on the southernmost ship,{{Co|75.3|52.1|Stormheim}}{{Co|75.89|51.92|Stormheim}} one on the middle ship{{Co|76.14|49.72|Stormheim}} below [[Captain Broketooth]] (who needs to be killed for [[A Stone of Blood]]), and one on the northernmost.{{Co|75.44|48.92|Stormheim}}

The [[:Crate of Ancient Relics]] in the water between the ships offers the optional [[The Value of Knowledge]].

==Progression==
{{Dreyrgrot}}
