==Objectives==
Follow Sylvanas into the [[Vault of Eyir]].
*Sylvanas Followed

==Description==
It seems that you are full of surprises, <name>. With the blessing of the [[Valkyra]] queen, you have opened a path that will shape the destiny of Azeroth.

I invite you to bear witness, for today a new day dawns on the Forsaken!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sylvanas' Barbed Arrow
|Blessing of the Banshee Queen
|Might of the Forsaken
|Curseheart's Cowl
|Plaguebringer's Mask
|Dark Ranger Coif
|Blightcaller's Braincage
}}

You will also receive:
*[[Fragment of the Soulcage]]
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It looks like we underestimated [[Genn Greymane|Greymane]]'s tenacity - a mistake that cost the Forsaken dearly.

This [[Eyir]] cannot hide for long, however. If I must I will hunt her through the [[Halls of Valor]]!

Go now, <class>. I will call upon you when you are needed.

==Notes==
Upon entering the vault, a cinematic plays.
