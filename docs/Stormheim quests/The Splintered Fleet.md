:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|The Alliance will be upon us soon, and we have nowhere to run. Organize our defenses beginning with the rear. I want bat-riders in the air and catapults at the ready!}}
:{{text|say|[[Nathanos Blightcaller]]|My Queen, your safety must be our first concern. Surely we can leave a few ships behind to-}}
