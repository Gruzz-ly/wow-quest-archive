==Objectives==
Banish demons that have been irresponsibly summoned in [[Stormheim]].
* [[Demon]]s Banished (8)
* [[Orb of Banishment]] (provided)

==Description==
A confession alone won't be enough to clear my name. As long as those [[demon]]s run amuck, people will blame their presence on me.

Someone needs to clean up the mess that warlock made. I'd do it myself, but I can't be placed at the scene of the crime.

You could banish them though. That would do the trick. Use this orb on newly summoned demons to send them right back where they came from - permanently!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have the demons been banished yet?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

Your willingness to help an outcast will not be forgotten.

==Progression==
