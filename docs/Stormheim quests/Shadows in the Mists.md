==Objectives==
Defeat Captain Sten, Sigrid, Kjell and Halvir in [[Helmouth Shallows]].
* [[Captain Sten]] slain
* [[Sigrid]] slain
* [[Kjell]] slain
* [[Halvir]] slain

==Description==
Many of the [[Kvaldir]] here in the bay are former denizens of this harbor, cursed by the sea-witch [[Helya]] to do her bidding for all time.

The ones you read about, they still walk the stagnant waters. They could be given respite, should a kind soul bring it to them at the tip of a blade.

So tell me, how kind is your soul?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|q1=|Sigrid's Phantom Shroud
|q2=|Dreadsworn Waistguard
|q3=|Stormborn Cinch
|q4=|Runesworn Waistguard
|q5=|Runespeaker's Waistcord
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
Their toil is ended, and fewer kvaldir walk the lands of [[Stormheim]].

Both are blessings, I would say.

==Progression==
{{Stopping the Naglfar}}
