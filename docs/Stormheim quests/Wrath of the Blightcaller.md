==Objectives==
Slay 15 [[7th Legion Paratrooper]]s or [[Skyfire Gryphon Rider|Skyfire Gryphon-Riders]].
* Alliance slain (15)

==Description==
The Alliance dogs have bitten off more than they can chew. They have attacked the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Banshee Queen]], and invoked the wrath of her champion!

Like my bow, my axes, and my hounds, you will be an agent of vengeance. Pile the bodies high, <class>, and know that I am doing the same. When next we meet, I expect to see blood upon your hands.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I have no use for soft buffoons! Begone if you haven't the stomach for vengeance!

==Completion==
They have only begun to pay for their insolence.

==Progression==
{{Stormheim (Horde)}}
