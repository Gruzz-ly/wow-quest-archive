"My chute caught a piece of shrapnel. Made a rough landing in a ravenbear nest. Luckily, a bunch of eggs broke my fall.

Lost sight of Illandris and Shwayder. Both are masters of disguise, and I am confident they can remain undetected.

Will continue to monitor the enemy's activity. Just need to clean all the yolk off my cloaking device. Hope the mother's not around...
