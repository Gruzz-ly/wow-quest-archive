==Objectives==
Use the [[Skyfire Propeller]] to broadcast a distress signal, then hold out until help arrives.
* Distress Signal started
* Transponder defended

==Description==
The [[Skyfire]]'s starboard propeller came to rest on the cliffs overlooking our camp - we're gonna use it like a big antenna and push our distress signal so far that even [[Gelbin Mekkatorque|Mekkatorque's]] alarm clock could pick it up!

Unfortunately, it might attract some unwanted attention.

We're braced for enemy contact down here at the camp - fire up that signal and be ready to defend the antenna!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

You will also receive: {{cost|14|60|}}

{{Rfb-section}}
*[[Refurbished Tinkerer's Goggles]]
*[[Almost Undamaged Plate Helm]]

==Completion==
The distress signal got through. We'll be evacuated to [[Greywatch]] immediately.

I'm afraid that, for now, you will have to continue your mission without us.

==Notes==
Exit the cave to the northeast and follow the path downhill. A large chunk of the Skyfire is on the edge of the ridge. Interact with it and Forsaken forces start streaming in. Fend them off.

After a while, Rogers and Overspark fly up on a [[Mind-Controlled Dreadwing]]:
:{{text|yell|Sky Admiral Rogers|I can't believe you talked me into this! Can you even control this thing?!}}
:{{text|yell|Tinkmaster Overspark|Of course I can! Wait... woahh! Woah!}}
:''The bat quickly proves Overspark is not as in control as he thinks he is by barrel-rolling.''
:{{text|yell|Sky Admiral Rogers|Heads up! Very big dragon incoming!}}

[[Vethir]] appears. Get him to about 30% health and he will fly away.
:{{text|yell|Tinkmaster Overspark|Alright, let's just set her down nice and eas-GAAHH!!}}

Follow Overspark and Rogers to the turn-in point off to the northeast. On approach:
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Put that vile thing out of its misery already.}}
:{{text|say|Tinkmaster Overspawk|He's not vile! Just... misunderstood.}}

;On complete:
:{{text|say|Muninn|Caww! <Name>! <Name!>}}

The [[Stormheim storyline]] continues with [[The Ancient Trials (Alliance)]], started from [[Muninn]], a [[dread raven]] near the rest of the questgivers.
