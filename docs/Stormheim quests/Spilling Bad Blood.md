==Objectives==
Kill 8 Blood-Crazed Swashbucklers in [[Dreyrgrot]].
* [[Blood-Crazed Swashbuckler]] slain (8)

==Description==
Ending the evil of the [[Blood-Thane Lucard|Blood Prince]] will be a boon to this land, but we can't just allow these [[Red Blade|crazed corsairs]] to run amok. I'm afraid there is no choice but to put them to the sword.

Carry out this noble deed, my good fellow, and we will celebrate with a nice warm lager.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* 150 [[reputation]] with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
Good riddance to bad rubbish, I say. 

Those louts were ne'er-do-wells before they went crazy. Just imagine what they would do if we let them run rampant!

Cheers to your bravery, sir.
