==Objectives==
Report to [[Nathanos Blightcaller]].

==Description==
Good to see you survived the wreck. Nathanos made it as well, though his face is now even uglier than before.

He took a group of rangers north to look for [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] - nobody has seen her since the battle.

He asked me to send you his way if you ever woke up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Nathanos narrows his eyes at the wreckage of Sylvanas' ship.>

She's out there... she has to be.

==Notes==
Upon accept, Cullen mounts her bat and flies away.

==Progression==
