==Objectives==
Meet with Lorna Crowley outside of Hrydshal to begin the trial of the Thorignir.

==Description==
In the summit of storms the dragons await. Born of the gods, they will test your will. 

They roost above Hrydshal, where their children serve the Drekirjar. But they are no allies to man or vrykul, and so you must earn their blessing as they see fit. 

A friend of yours awaits in Hrydshal, no doubt searching for the answers you now possess. Go to her, and together, you will test your might against the storm!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,480 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It's good to see you, <name>. Greymane sent me away to scout this village for more information on the Aegis. 

I haven't gleaned much so far, other than that the locals here don't seem so friendly. Of course, when are they ever?

I hope your search fares better.

==Notes==
