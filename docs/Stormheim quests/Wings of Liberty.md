==Objectives==
Free Aleifir, Hrafsir, Erilar and Hridmogir in [[Thorim's Peak]].
* [[Aleifir]] Freed
* [[Hrafsir]] Freed
* [[Erilar]] Freed
* [[Hridmogir]] Freed

==Description==
When the [[Drekirjar]] assaulted the nest, the [[Thorignir]] fought bravely to save our brood. But their demonic allies proved too much, and many of us were captured.

Even now they work to corrupt my brothers and sisters to turn them to their side.

Please, outsider, free them from this fate!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Thorignir Punisher Spaulders
|Thorignir Striker Shoulderguards
|Thorignir Javelin Mantle
|Thorignir Heavy Pauldrons
|Goliath Wraps of Hridmogir
|Reaping Gloves of Aleifir
|Marauding Grips of Hrafsir
|Sieging Gauntlets of Erilar
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
+150 reputation with the [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
What news do you bring of my brothers and sisters?

==Completion==
I am truly indebted to you for this act. My siblings were not able to defend themselves against the [[Tideskorn|Felskorn]], and would have ended up their slaves. 

You are a true friend of the Thorignir.

==Notes==
Interact with [[Ritual Circle]]s to free the dragons.
