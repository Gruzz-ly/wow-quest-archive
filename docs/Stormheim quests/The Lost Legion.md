==Objectives==
Locate the missing 7th Legion Dragoons.

==Description==
The heroic men and women of the 7th Legion stayed at the front of the ship to fight off storm drakes while the crew evacuated.

None of them have returned.

Please find them, <name>!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|14|60|}}

==Completion==
<Though his eyes are open, the soldier does not respond to your presence. An electrical field buzzes around him.>

==Notes==
Pick up [[Lightning Rod (quest)]] before heading out.

From camp, head due west up the hill, following the path as it turns south. The forward half of the ship has poked a hole into a cave.

There's a small treasure chest on one of the exposed rafters. To get to it, stand on the edge of the exposed beam on the east side of the ship, dismount, move the camera directly overhead, and line up the edge of the beam with the center of the chest, then jump straight toward it. The angle of the ship makes it appear that the jump will fall short, but it's reachable.

Run up the front of the ship to enter [[Stormscale Cavern]], where [[Knight-Captain Rhodes]] has been stunned by a lightning attack. Turn in The Lost Legion to him, and pick up [[Pins and Needles]].
