==Objectives==
Fly with [[Vethir]] and kill 150 of the God-King's allies in [[Hrydshal]].
* Begin the Assault on Hrydshal
* God-King's Minions (150)
* Leave Hrydshal

==Description==
You have proven yourself an ally of the [[Thorignir]] and we will lend you our strength. I would ask one last favor of our new champion, though.

The dragon who guided you to me awaits his vengeance against the vrykul. Together I wish for you to show these [[Drekirjar]] what it means to cross the Thorignir. Their toll must be paid in blood.

Speak to Vethir when you are ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
<The raven squawks, and [[Havi]]'s voice fills your head>

You are indeed mighty, as the trial shows.

But valor is a different animal - one you think to tame?

==Notes==
