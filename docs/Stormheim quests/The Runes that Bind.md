==Objectives==
Destroy the Ritual Stones to stop the rituals binding [[Ashildir]]'s spirit in [[Haustvald]].
* [[Ritual Stone (Stormheim)|Ritual Stone]] destroyed (3)

==Description==
The stone tablet here describes a ritual where a powerful spirit can be broken into weaker pieces by binding them to special [[runestone]]s. It looks like the [[Bonespeakers]] may be using this very ritual to weaken the spirit of Ashildir.

It may be impossible to summon her with her spirit so weakened. The rituals must be stopped.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60}}
* 11,300 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
These mystics have gone to great lengths to weaken Ashildir.

We must hope that her spirit is strong enough for the wakening.

==Progression==
{{The Final Judgement}}
