==Objectives==
Pour Havi some grog.
* Brought [[Havi]] Grog

==Description==
It is time I told you another tale. While you listen, would you be so kind as to pour me some grog? I've grown a terrible thirst.

The keg is very old and the tap is a bit slow.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I've told you my tale, but did you bring the grog?

==Completion==
Delicious, thank you.

Before we act, we must gather more information onto what [[Helya]] is planning.

==Notes==
Click on the keg near the campfire in [[Valdisdall]] while you listen to Havi.
