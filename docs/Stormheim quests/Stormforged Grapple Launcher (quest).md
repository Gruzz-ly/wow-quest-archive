'''Stormforged Grapple Launcher''' is required to complete [[A Grapple a Day]].  It can be completed before that quest, and will simply be noted as completed when A Grapple a Day is accepted.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|83|50}} at max level)
*[[Stormforged Grapple Launcher]]

==Completion==
This looks like one of the grapple launchers the local [[vrykul]] use to scale the steep ridges in [[Stormheim]].

This could come in handy.

==Notes==
This quest is important to do not just for Stormheim, but also to reach rooftops in [[Suramar City]] and scaling cliffs on the [[Broken Shore]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
