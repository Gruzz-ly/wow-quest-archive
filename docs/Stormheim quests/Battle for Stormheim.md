Defeat Lord Commander Alexius in [[Stormheim]].
*Speak with the Val'kyr of Odyn

==Description==
Your efforts have destroyed the Legions forces upon [[Shield's Rest]], yet they continue to press their assault.

There is only one way to end this - you must venture into the midst of our foe, find their commander, and remove his vile head!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60}}
*12,340 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Valarjar]]
*[[Talisman of the Ascended]]

==Completion==
Well done, <name>! Well done indeed!

The Legion will rue the day they set their sights on the land of Stormheim.

==Notes==
;Quest accept
:{{text|say|[[Val'kyr of Odyn]]|I'm prepared to take you to the [[Halls of Valor]]. Speak with me when your allies have gathered and you are ready.}}

;Val'kyr of Odyn
:Are you prepared to answer the call of glory, <class>?
:{{gossip|I'm prepared! Send me to the [[Gates of Valor]]. [Queue for Scenario]}}

;Quest completion
:{{text|say|Odyn|Well done! [[Azeroth|Our world]] will never fall so long as it is defended by champions such as you!}}

===Stage 1: Freedom===
* Drakes freed (3)

:{{text|say|Odyn|[[Vethir]]'s brood has been captured... again! Free them, so they can aid our fight against this onslaught.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Commander Alexius|The Legion will conquer all! Your pathetic Halls will be turned to dust.}}

Two drakes are located on the middle tier at the Gates of Valor, with one being on the lower tier next to the stairs.

===Stage 2: Siege Breaker===
* Use the storm drakes to eliminate the Legion's ground forces.

:{{text|say|Odyn|Heroes, return to me. Vethir's brood has joined our battle against these invaders. Take to the skies and claim victory!}}

As Odyn said, return to him and mount up on the storm drakes there. Use the storm drakes' ability to kill all the demons you see.

===Stage 3: Insertion===
* Reach the Legion ship.

:{{text|say|Odyn|The Legion must be stricken from the sky! The drakes will carry you to the [[demon]]s' flying fortress. From there, you can sabotage their infernal vessel.}}

===Stage 4: Take Down From Within===
* Sabotage the Legion forces on board the ship.

In order to fill the tracking bar to 100%, you will need to kill nearly all the mobs on board.

===Stage 5: Commander Takedown===
* Kill [[Lord Commander Alexius]]
* Destroy Shield Crystals (4)

:{{text|say|Lord Commander Alexius|Enough of your meddling! Come and seek me out, if your dare!}}

Look for a fel portal to teleport you to the next area of the ship.

===Final Stage: Get Out of There===
* Reach the Storm Drakes to escape from the Legion Ship.

:{{text|say|Odyn|You took down their commander. Well done! Vethir's drakes will see you to safety. I shall strike the final blow against their foul vessel myself!}}

Take a storm drake to leave the ship. A brief cutscene will play afterwards, showing Odyn atop the Gates of Valor throwing his weapon at the ship and destroying it.

You may safely leave the scenario group at this point.
