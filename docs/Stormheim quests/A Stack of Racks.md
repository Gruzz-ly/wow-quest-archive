==Objectives==
Collect 8 Meaty Racks of Musken Ribs from [[Stout Highlands Runehorn]]s in [[Jotunnwood]].
* [[Meaty Rack of Musken Ribs]] (8)

==Description==
So while we're waiting here, maybe you could fetch us up some grub. Them [[Highmountain tauren|tauren]] were runnin low on meats, so I'm sure they'd be thankful to have more.

I hear that [[musken]] ribs are the specialty here. The wild musken here are too lean for any good meat, but across the river there are some nice fat ones. Maybe you should check those out!

Don't worry, I'm pretty sure there aren't any [[dragon]]s over there...

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Crystal Clear Gemstone
|Elixir of Endless Wonder
}}


You will also receive: {{cost|19|40|}}

==Progress==
Aint nothin like some good old meaty musken ribs, eh pal?

==Completion==
Oh hey, it's... you again! Of course you didn't have any trouble with those musken. You're a big, tough hero after all!

The tauren still aren't back, though. I'm a bit worried that they may have gone off and hunted a bit more that they can chew.

Oh, I'll take those ribs, though. What do you want for em?
