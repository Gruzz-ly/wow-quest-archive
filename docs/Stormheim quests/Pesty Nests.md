*[[Raven Nest]]s removed (5)

==Description==
:{{text|say|[[Vydhar]]|[[Haustvald]] is a sacred place that is currently being defiled by pesky [[raven]]s. Filthy creatures and so ''foul'' mouthed. Would you make use of that body of yours and a [[Stormforged Grapple Launcher|grappling hook]] and remove some of those nests?}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
:{{text|say|Vydhar|Ravens can be so ''rude'' sometimes. I am sure you heard all of the uncouth things they were saying about you and your lineage. Thank you for removing their nests.}}
