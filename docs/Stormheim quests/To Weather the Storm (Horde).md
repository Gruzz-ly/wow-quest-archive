==Objectives==
Collect Climbing Treads, an Oiled Cloak, and an Enchanted Lodestone from [[Hrydshal]].
* [[Enchanted Lodestone]]
* [[Climbing Treads]]
* [[Oiled Cloak]]

==Description==
When I was scouting this place out, I noticed the [[vrykul]] here are no strangers to the treacherous mountain path we're trying to get to. They've got some specialized equipment they're using, and if I were you I'd try to get my hands on some.

You'll want to find some climbing treads to keep your grip and an oiled cloak to keep you dry. They've also got these stones they carry to keep the lightning at bay, so you'll want to pick one of those up as well.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Galeborn's Oiled Cloak
|Lodestone of the Mystic
|Lodestone of the Galeborn
|Lodestone of the Stormbreaker}}
You will also receive: {{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)

{{itembox||Longaxe's Oiled Cloak|Shieldbearer's Oiled Cloak}}

==Progress==
Were you able to get all the gear you needed?

==Completion==
Well, the sizing might be a bit big, but I think you can make them work.

That path doesn't look pleasant, so it'll help to be prepared.

==Gains==
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
