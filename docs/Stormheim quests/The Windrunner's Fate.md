==Objectives==
Search the wreckage of the Windrunner and the nearby coastline for signs of Sylvanas.
*[[Dread-Captain's Saber|Search the Windrunner for clues]]
*Find [[Dread-Captain Tattersail]]
*[[Plague-Tipped Arrow|Find the Dark Lady's landing]]

==Description==
Finding Sylvanas is our only priority!

We will cover more ground if we split up. I will lead a team into the hills above the enemy's camp while you search the wreckage itself for any signs of the crew.

Once we've cleared the high ground, I will meet you at the far end of the beach.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found any signs of the queen?

==Completion==
So, she escaped after all...

==Notes==
Upon accept, Nathanos, his hounds, and rangers run further into the cove.

[[Dread-Captain's Saber]]:
{{Book|Dread-Captain's Saber|content=
An officer's sword stands out among the wreckage. Scanning the nearby bodies, you notice the captain is not among them.

Upon finding Tattersail:
:{{text|say|Dread-Captain Tattersail|We got the queen into a rowboat, but she didn't want an escort. Told us to stay behind and fight.}}
:{{text|say|Dread-Captain Tattersail|My guess? She landed somewhere up the coast and continued on foot.}}

Interacting with the arrow:
:{{text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|No sign of Sylvanas in the hills. What have we here?}}
:{{text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|That's one of hers alright...}}
