==Objectives==
* Challengers defeated (4)

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Ashildir]]|There are those among the [[Valkyra]] who wish to test you in single combat. Go to [[Skold-Ashil]] and face them in battle. None shall attack until you strike the first blow.}}

==Completion==
: {{text|say|Ashildir|Only the greatest of the Valkyra are worthy of [[Eyir]]'s gift.}}

==Rewards==
* +75 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Notes==
Triggered in Skold-Ashil. This quest will also make all the regular mobs neutral, so this would be an excellent time to find something in the area, or target a specific mob in the town without having to deal with aggressive mobs.

Out in front of the [[Vault of Eyir]] is the Challenge Horn. Using it will summon the first of the four challengers, in a set order. It doesn't matter which ones you kill, as long as you get four kills. (You could, for example, kill Bretta the Bold four times if you wanted.) Joining in the middle of killing someone else's mobs means you will have to wait for the horn to be usable again to get more challengers.

Should this happen, you won't have to kill more than your required number: if not engaged, the challenger will despawn after a time, and the horn will reset after a couple of minutes.
