==Objectives==
Speak to [[Ritssyn Flamescowl]].

==Description==
What you plan to do is pretty risky, you know? Summoning one sister would be difficult enough, but both of them at once? That's just asking for trouble.

Luckily, I'm up for the challenge. I'll help you and the rest of the [[Council of the Black Harvest|council]] summon those demons, and hopefully restore pride to the Fizzlebang name.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
With Lulubelle's assistance, we should be able to complete the summoning.

==Notes==
If you are having trouble seeing the orange ! mark
