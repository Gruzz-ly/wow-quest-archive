==Objectives==
[[File:Sylvanas with Soulcage.jpg|thumb|upright|Sylvanas with the Soulcage in the Vault.]]
Confront [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] in the [[Vault of Eyir]].
* [[Genn Greymane|Greymane]] followed

==Description==
The Banshee Queen is here!  I'd recognize those tainted arrows anywhere.

This is the moment we have been fighting for.  Sylvanas will answer for her crimes against [[Varian Wrynn]] and the [[Alliance]]!

To arms!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sylvanas' Broken Arrow
|Bane of the Darklady
|Tenacity of Cursed Blood
|Stylish Gilnean Collar
|Raging Worgen Hood
|Wall Watcher's Coif
|Refined Rage Headcage
}}

{{itembox|You will also receive: {{cost|19|40|}}
|Onyx Arrowhead
}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
You're awake! We nearly lost you there... 

It's a good thing we managed to get you and Greymane out of there in time, otherwise we wouldn't have been able to reverse Sylvanas's poison.  It's a shame she got away, but her plans in [[Skold-Ashil]] failed and we have you to thank for it.

I'm sure Greymane will order a commendation for you once he is fully recovered.  You did a great thing here, <name>.

Gilneas is in your debt.

==Notes==
''Accept:''
: ''The four [[Greywatch Guard]]s stand at the ready.  Genn charges forth from his kneel, the guards at his side as they enter the Vault of Eyir.''
: {{text|yell|Genn Greymane|Storm the vault! For [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilneas]]!}}

Upon entering the vault, a cinematic plays.
