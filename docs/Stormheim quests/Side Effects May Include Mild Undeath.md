==Objectives==
Slay 10 [[Volatile Bear]]s or [[Volatile Sailor]]s.
* Volatile subjects slain (10)

==Description==
Exposure to this particular "byproduct" is quite nasty.

Rapid cell degeneration quickly reduces the subject to a shambling husk incapable of any reason or thought beyond a violent, throbbing hatred for the warmth of life.

As you might imagine, the local fauna have been affected by the spill. Oh, and most of the crew as well...

Anyway, good luck!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Come now, surely you don't intend to leave them in this state? Have you no compassion?

How about money - you like money, don't you?

==Completion==
The [[Royal Apothecary Society|R.A.S.]] is nothing if not humane.

==Progression==
