==Objectives==
Collect 8 Ashildir's Bones in [[Haustvald]].
* [[Ashildir's Bones]] (8)

==Description==
So you seek the judgment of the queen of the [[Valkyra]]?  This must be your fault!

The Bonespeakers of Haustvald have committed an atrocity and stolen [[Ashildir]]'s bones.  They must have done this to keep an outsider from completing the trials.  You must not let this stand!

Enter Haustvald and retrieve her remains.  I hope, for your sake, that Ashildir is in a forgiving mood.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Runespeaker's Sandals
|Stormborn Treads
|Runesworn Boots
|Dreadsworn Greaves
|Runespeaker's Trousers
|Runesworn Greaves
|Dreadsworn Legplates
|Stormborn Legguards
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
Were you able to recover her remains?

==Completion==
The treachery of the Bonespeakers knows no limit.

Their rituals seek to sunder the very essence of our queen, but we will use their own magic to return her to us!

==Notes==
On entering Haustvald during the questline, God-King Skovald appears hovering on his [[storm drake]] mount, [[Vaengir]].
: {{text|yell|God-King Skovald|You again?!  Do you really think to beat me, with the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] at my side?}}
: {{text|yell|God-King Skovald|Give up, fool!  The Bonespeakers will never let an outsider be judged worthy!}}
: ''Skovald rises up into the air and despawns.''

==Progression==
{{The Final Judgement}}

;Description
So you seek the judgment of the queen of the Valkyra? It appears you are not the only one.

The Bonespeakers of Haustvald have committed an atrocity and stolen Ashildir's bones. I think they seek to use them to somehow force her judgement on their [[God-King]]. This cannot be allowed!

Enter Haustvald and retrieve her remains, and I will ask that she grants you her favor, outsider.
