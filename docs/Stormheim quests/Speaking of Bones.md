==Objectives==
Help [[Havi]] butcher the moose and learn about your next trial.
* [[Ironhorn Buck]] butchered

==Description==
The Trial of Valor will be your next test, and test you it will!

But only a fool fights on an empty stomach. Are you a fool, outsider?

No? Then lend these old bones a hand and butcher the moose for our meal. I will spin you a tale of rocks, trees and spirits.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
*+10 reputation with the [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
A fine cut, I must say.

Yes, you will do well against the Bonespeakers, I think.
