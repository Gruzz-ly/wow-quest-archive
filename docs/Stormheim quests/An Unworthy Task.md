==Objectives==
Search among the caged [[vrykul]] in [[Helheim]] for one who can help your escape.
* Cooperative spirit found

==Description==
This place is Helheim, the realm of the unworthy dead. Here, the spirits of the dishonorable spend eternity in an endless futile battle, always seeking glory but never able to attain it.

We should not be here.

We must find a way out. I will scout ahead - you should try and release some of these captive spirits here. Perhaps one may have some answers for us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|60}} (at level 100)
*11,300 [[XP]] (at level 100)
*+150 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
Free at last!

The kvaldir caught me while I was tryin' to put together a plan to sneak past that foul dog, [[Guarm]], and have had me locked up ever since!

I thought surely my fate was sealed.

==Notes==
Upon accept, Ashildir runs away. Open [[Colborn's Cage]] in front of you.
