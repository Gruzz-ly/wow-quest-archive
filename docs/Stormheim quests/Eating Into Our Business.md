==Objectives==
Kill 10 Duskpelt [[worg]] in [[Amberfall Mesa]].
*Duskpelt worg slain (10)

==Description==
Greetings traveler! You are welcome to rest at our camp, but if you plan on sticking around a while, I have a proposition for you.

As you can see, the land here has been very good to us, providing a great natural bounty. Lately, however, the worg have become problematic, and are thinning the herds to unacceptable levels.

I can't take care of them all, so I will offer a bounty for every worg slain in the mesa. Return to me when you have culled their pack a bit.

==Rewards==

|Mysterious Coin

*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh, hey! You must be lookin for them [[Highmountain tauren|tauren]] was camped here. They just stepped out for a bit, but [[Snaggle Sixtrigger|Snaggle]] here and I - we can take care of ya!

You say they were gonna pay you for killin' some worgs, huh? No prob, bub!

I ain't got a lot of gold, but these goods are pretty valuable. Take your pick!
