==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Havi.jpg|Havi|This strange old vrykul seems to know you somehow...}}
Speak with [[Havi]] near [[Aggramar's Vault]].

==Description==
<As the raven stares into your eyes, an odd voice fills your mind.>

I know who you are, champion, and I know what you seek. 

Come to me, if you think yourself truly worthy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}}
*1,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm sure your head is filled with questions. Answers will come, in time.

I am Havi, and my words are those of the Valarjar - the glorious keepers of the Halls of Valor.

You will need my help if it is the Aegis you seek. Oh yes, I know your goals outsider. As I know many things...

;Havi's letter voiceover
:{{text|say|Havi|Strength alone will not win what you seek.}}
:{{text|say|Havi|But it will get you started. Find me near Aggramar's Vault, and I will put your strength to the test.}}

If the player is a [[warrior]] with the [[Warswords of the Valarjar]] equipped, Havi will say this as you approach:
:{{text|say|Havi|So, it is none other than Odyn's champion!}}
:{{text|say|Havi|I have heard tales of your exploits. Let us see if there are more than tales, shall we?}}

You take the scroll and open it to reveal glittering runes. A voice echoes in your mind.>

You got my letter!
