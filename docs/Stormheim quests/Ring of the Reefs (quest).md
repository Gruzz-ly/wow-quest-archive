==Objectives==
Solve the riddle.
* [[Ring of the Reefs]]

==Description==
<A light mist twists and curls around this ring as if caressing it.

Holding this object makes you uneasy, deep within your soul. It feels as if invisible, icy hands from the lands of the dead are pulling at you.

There is no mistaking [[Helya]]'s power.

The [[Valarjar]] will want to hear about this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (700x [[Azerite (resource)]])
*{{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Another ring? Hmph. Yes, we have been seeing them more frequently.

<Valdemar grimaces.>

Helya is growing in power.

What, small one, are you surprised? Did you think she was defeated?

<Valdemar laughs heartily.>

You cannot kill death!

I thank you for making me laugh today, little friend.

Odyn has heard about your search for [[:Azerite]], we have gathered what we could.

Here, it is yours.
