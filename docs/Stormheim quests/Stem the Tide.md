==Objectives==
Use the Stormforged Horn to destroy the three [[Felbound Portal]]s in [[Gates of Valor]].
* North Portal Destroyed
* East Portal Destroyed
* South Portal Destroyed
* [[Stormforged Horn]] (provided)

==Description==
Skovald has profaned the [[Gates of Valor]] with his demonic allies. Among his forces his twisted mystics have conjured portals to ferry his fel allies from their blighted worlds.

If we wish to stem this tide, these portals must be destroyed.

I will gather my allies. Take this horn and signal when you have found a portal, and we will strike from the skies!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (level 100), {{cost|19|40}} (level 110)
*15,050 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
The portals must be closed if we wish to stop Skovald's forces!

==Completion==
I do not understand, the portals are closed and yet Skovald's demonic forces still assault the gates!

We must find where they are coming from!

==Notes==
When the horn in blown, Vethir flies in, leading [[Erilar]] at his left and [[Hrafsir]] at his right, and all three fire at the portal.
