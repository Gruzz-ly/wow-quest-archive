==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Greywatch Saboteur]]s or [[Greywatch Infiltrator|Infiltrator]]s in [[Greymane's Offensive]].
*Greywatch worgen slain  (10)

==Description==
The situation has taken a dire turn, <name>. We were unprepared for Greymane's sudden assault, with only a token force left behind at Dreadwake's Landing, and we are paying the toll.

The beach is now swarming with worgen infiltrators, and if the cannons breach our defenses, they will likely swarm in on us. We're spread too thin here to take the fight to them, but you could change that.

Wipe them out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
It looks like the ravens will feast on worgen flesh today, <class>.

Well done.

==Notes==
Nathanos has gossip.
{{Dialogue|
It is good that you arrived when you did. Our walls can't take much more of a beating from Greymane's cannons.
