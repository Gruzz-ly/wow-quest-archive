==Objectives==
Gather 7 Crates of Ancient Relics from the waters outside [[Dreyrgrot]].
*[[Crate of Ancient Relics]] (provided) (7)

==Description==
This crate is filled with relics from the nearby ruins. [[Red Blade|The pirates]] have discarded them, likely thinking they're of little value.

The [[Explorer's League]] would probably appreciate if you retrieved these relics for them to study.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
What's this?

==Completion==
Well that was most noble of you to save these ancient relics from a water-logged fate.

I will be sure that the Explorer's League puts these to good use!

==Notes==
The quest starts from a specific crate floating on the surface in the center of the [[Citrine Bay]].{{Co|75.53|50.81|Stormheim}} The rest are floating under the surface in waters infested with [[Citrine Thresher]]s.

==Progression==
{{Dreyrgrot}}
