Gather 12 Murloc Trinkets from around their camps.
* [[Murloc Trinket]] (12)

==Description==
Ol' [[Hobart Grapplehammer|Hobart]] wanted me ta gather up these shiny, glass trinkets the [[murloc]]s carry around, but those bloody buggers ain't willin' to jes' hand 'em over!

I tried the dip-ler-matic approach, but I don't speak [[nerglish|murloc]], so I just end up shootin' 'em.

Maybe you might have better luck gettin' them baubles.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|17||}}
* 15,620 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Any luck?

Did yeh try shootin' 'em?

==Completion==
Well lookie there! You managed to talk 'em outta their trinkets! Ye'll have to teach me their language someday.
