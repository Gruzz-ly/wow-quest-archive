==Objectives==
Fire 4 Forsaken Catapults in [[Greymane's Offensive]].
*[[Forsaken Catapult (Stormheim)|Fire Catapults]] (4)

==Description==
Our mission is [[Skold-Ashil]] will have to wait, <class> - for now, we have more pressing matters to attend to.

I had just recently arrived with reinforcements for our assault when [[Genn Greymane|Greymane]]'s ship sailed in and began barraging our walls. We deployed our siege weapons, but their ground forces quickly overwhelmed us.

If you can get to those catapults and take out the dogs manning the cannons, it may give us the window we need to push the attack!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Fire those catapults!

==Completion==
Hah! Greymane will find his cannons aren't so useful when the blight takes his crew!

==Notes==
Nathanos has gossip upon accepting the quest.
{{Dialogue|
It is good that you arrived when you did. Our walls can't take much more of a beating from Greymane's cannons.
