==Objectives==
Take the fish from Havi's [[Fish Barrel]] and skewer it on the [[Spear (Stormheim)|spear]] above the fire.
* Carry Havi's fish to the fire

==Description==
With [[Ashildir]]'s judgement, your final trial is complete.

But even [[Valhallas]] can wait, for now we must eat! Being dead works up quite an appetite.

Come now, bring some of that fish to roast over the fire. It is far too heavy for me to carry.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
|Recipe: Pickled Stormray}}
* 15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +10 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
It is clear that your cooking prowess is only matched by your might in combat.

Now, on full bellies, we ride to Valhallas!
