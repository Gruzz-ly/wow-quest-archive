==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Steelscale.jpg|Steelscale|The menace of Citrine Bay.}}
Collect Steelscale's Fin from [[Steelscale]] in [[Citrine Bay]].
*[[Steelscale's Fin]]

==Description==
All right, I've got one last beasty to send you after.  He's a bit far out, but trust me, it'll be worth it.  This one I put a huge wager on!

Along the eastern coast swims a great [[shark]] the locals call Steelscale.  They say his hide is near impenetrable.

But you're gonna prove them wrong, aren't ya chum?  Bring me his fin, and those tauren will have to fork over a princely sum.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|58|20}} (at level 110)
* [[Rax's Magnifying Glass]]
* [[Steelscale's Fin (quest reward)]]
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hmm...

==Completion==
<A note from the goblins is left behind, along with an old magnifying glass>

I wish I coulda been there to see the look on your face, but [[Rax Sixtrigger|Raz]]{{sic}} and I got bigger fish to fry!

Thanks for the trophies and meat. I'm sure they'll fetch a nice sum on the black market, along with all the goodies we got from those stupid tauren! I'm sure they won't be needing them any more!

So long sucker!
