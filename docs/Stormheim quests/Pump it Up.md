==Objectives==
Fill the [[Containment Unit]] with [[Volatile Waste]].
*Containment Unit filled
*Volatile Waste (100)

==Description==
The [[Black Rose (ship)|Black Rose]] was a seafaring laboratory for the [[Royal Apothecary Society]]. Naturally, we had some volatile... "byproducts" onboard.

Regrettably, one such substance was released during our skirmish with the [[Alliance]] [[gunship]]. As you can see, it is taking quite a toll on the coast.

The R.A.S. must remedy this situation before we press further inland.

Please take a containment unit and fill it with waste - for us to dispose of properly at a later time, of course.

==Rewards==

There's still room in that containment unit.

Wonderful, just put that down anywhere. Careful not to spill it!
