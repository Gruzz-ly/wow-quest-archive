==Objectives==
* Helya's forces disrupted.

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Ashildir]]|Champion, once again we must ask that you go where we cannot follow. [[Helya]]'s forces must be weakened if we are to prevail.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
: {{text|say|Ashildir|Do not overextend yourself. The time will come when Helya will face [[Odyn]]'s full wrath. But until then, you have weakened her forces.}}

==Notes==
There are many mobs that you can kill for completion, but the simplest and fastest way is to release [[Unworthy Soul]]s from cages and pillories and help them fight the kvaldir they attack. You could alternately just release Unworthy Souls in the five minutes that your Kvaldir Disguise is up and avoid combat altogether.

Mobs sometimes spawn a [[Worthy Soul Fragment]] on death; these can be clicked on for a stacking buff.

Eligible mobs are: [[Kvaldir Cursewalker]]s, [[Helhound (skeletal hound)|Helhounds]], [[Kvaldir Soulflayer]]s, [[Deepbrine Horror]]s, [[Unworthy Combatant]]s, [[Rotting Jailer]], [[Bloodbeard]], [[Fenri]], and [[Geir]].

==Progression==
{{Victory is Eternal}}
