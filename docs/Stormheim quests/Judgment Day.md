==Objectives==
Receive judgment from the ancient [[vrykul]] rulers.
* Judged by [[Heimir of the Black Fist]]
* Judged by [[Rythas the Oracle]]
* Judged by [[Oktel Dragonblood]]

==Description==
You have proven resourceful thus far, stranger. As promised, I will instruct you on the ritual of wakening.

First, you must place the offering directly atop the grave of the ruler you wish to awaken. Burn the incense so that its aroma wafts over the grave. If your offering is adequate, the ruler will rise, and you may ask your judgment.

Take care, outsider. The dead vrykul kings will not enjoy being awakened from their slumber.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
Ashildir's grave has been disturbed, outsider.

Do you know something of this?

==Notes==
Find [[Offering Bowl]]s to awaken the vrykul.

Awakening Oktel Dragonblood:
:{{text|say|Oktel Dragonblood|You wish to walk among the chosen?}}
:{{text|say|Oktel Dragonblood|Come then, show me your fury!}}
After being defeated:
:{{text|say|Oktel Dragonblood|Never have I faced such ferocity. The blood of the dragon flows within your veins, outsider.}}

Awakening Rythas the Oracle:
:{{text|say|Rythas the Oracle|What's this? An outsider seeks my judgment?}}
:{{text|say|Rythas the Oracle|Insolent worm! You should disgrace Valhalas with your presence!}}
Defeating Rythas the Oracle:
:{{text|say|Rythas the Oracle|I was mistaken. Your worth cannot be denied.}}

Defeating Heimir of the Black Fist:
:{{text|say|Heimir of the Black Fist|Impossible! No outsider has ever bested me in combat!}}
:{{text|say|Heimir of the Black Fist|I judge you worthy, <class>.}}

==Progression==
