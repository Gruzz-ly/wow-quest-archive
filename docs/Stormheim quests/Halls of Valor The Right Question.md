==Objectives==
Defeat [[Hymdall (tactics)|Hymdall]] in the [[Halls of Valor]] and recover his loincloth.
* [[Hymdall's Loincloth]]
* [[Odyn (tactics)|Odyn]] Defeated

==Description==
One might ask what a [[leyweaver]] is doing standing over a dead [[vrykul]]'s body. But such questions only stir up trouble.

Instead let us ask what can be learned from those who have passed on. A question like that promotes progress.

I assume you're here to learn from me, the pattern for [[:Imbued Silkweave]] pants, yes?

If that's true, then I'll need something from one who has passed on. In the Halls of Valor the great guardian, [[Hymdall]] resides.

Bring me his loincloth and I will teach you my pattern.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Imbued Silkweave Pantaloons]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Asking the right questions will get you far.

==Completion==
<Tellumi takes the loincloth from you and gives you a sly smile.>

I trust you now see looking at a situation from a functional angle than a reactionary one will earn you far more knowledge.
