==Objectives==
Deliver the [[Murloc Trinket]]s to [[Hobart Grapplehammer]] in [[Dalaran]].

I gotta finish up 'ere, so why don'tcha take those trinkets back to Hobart fer me.

'Sides, I'ma thinkin' he likes ya more than me.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Schematic: Intra-Dalaran Wormhole Generator]]

==Completion==
The pieces! Well it's about time.

<Hobart moves over to a machine and begins inserting the items you gave him.>

I take it Flintlocke made you deliver these? Well since you did the legwork, you can have a copy of my design.

It's a new type of wormhole generator. Specifically designed for getting around Dalaran in the blink of an eye!
