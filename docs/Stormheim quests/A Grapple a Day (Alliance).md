==Objectives==
Pick up a Stormforged Grapple Launcher and meet [[Lorna Crowley]] outside the wall of [[Hrydshal]].
* [[Stormforged Grapple Launcher (quest)]]

==Description==
So these trials are what will get us the [[Aegis of Aggramar|Aegis]], and the next one is on the top of that mountain?  That may prove problematic.

The only way I see up the mountain is through that vrykul city, and the gates are shut tight.  We should be able to grapple over, though.  If you don't have a launcher, I managed to wrangle a spare from one of these [[vrykul]].

I'll scout ahead and see if I can find a good spot to get in.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
That looks like it'll do the job nicely. 

Let's get in there before we're spotted.

==Notes==
''Accept:''
: ''Lorna stealths and leaves the watch.''
: {{text|say|Commander Lorna Crowley|I'll scout out ahead for a good vantage point.  Meet me close to the city wall once you have a grapple.}}

There are three [[Hillstalker Worg]]s that patrol within aggro distance and one vrykul; don't go AFK here!

''On approach:''
: ''Lorna is kneeling on a rocky outcrop facing the outer wall.''
: {{text|say|Commander Lorna Crowley|Psst... over here!}}

==Progression==
{{Where Dragons Rule}}
