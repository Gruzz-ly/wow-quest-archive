==Objectives==
Collect Storm Drake Scales from the Stormwing drakes in [[Hrydshal|Hrydhsal]]{{Sic}}.
*[[Storm Drake Scale]] (50)

==Description==
The [[vrykul]] around here seem to use scales from these drakes to fashion their armor.

If you were able to gather enough material from the local drakes, you may be able to make something useful out of it.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Electrified Stormwing Cord
|Humming Stormwing Wrap
|Charged Stormwing Belt
|Reinforced Stormwing Waistguard
|Charged Stormwing Robes
|Electrified Stormwing Vest
|Humming Stormwing Chest
|Stormwing Plate Chestguard}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Progress==
What have we here?

==Completion==
Good thing. If the vrykul can use the drake scales for their armor, why not us?

It shouldn't be too tough to work this into something servicable.
