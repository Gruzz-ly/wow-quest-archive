==Objectives==
Power up the archive device and view the holographic record for the Trial of Valor.
*Learn about the Trial of Will

==Description==
Upon the highest point of the plateau above, you will find the archive device for the Trial of Will. Seek it out to learn what awaits you in [[Thorim's Peak]].

Be on your guard, outsider. The one called [[Skovald]] has left behind many of his army, and they will no doubt be unfriendly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Completion==
The knowledge you've gained is a powerful tool to use against your foes.

Do not forget this.

==Notes==
Access the console, which is on the southern peak:
:{{text|say|Titan Console|Powering up archive device...}}
:{{text|yell|Felskorn Raider|The outsider must not learn of the trials!}}

Two [[Felskorn Raider]]s run up, already aggroed on the player. Kill them.
:{{text|say|Titan Console|Archive device power at 50 percent...}}
:{{text|yell|Felskorn Raider|You are unworthy of this place!}}

Three raiders run up the hill. Take them out as well. 
:{{text|say|Titan Console|Archive device power at 75 percent...}}
:{{text|yell|Felskorn Warmonger|The God-King will have your head!}}

A Felskorn Warmonger runs up to finish the task. Finish him instead.
:{{text|say|Titan Console|Archive device activated. The record is now accessible.}}

Access the device again.
:''An image of a storm dragon appears, facing an image of the player.''
:{{text|say|Yotnar|The [[Thorignir]] are the oldest and wisest dragons in Stormheim.}}
:{{text|say|Yotnar|To fly with them is to sail amongst the gods themselves.}}
:{{text|say|Yotnar|Seek their blessing to pass the Trial of Will.}}
