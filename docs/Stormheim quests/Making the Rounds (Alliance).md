:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Stormheim is home to one of the Pillars of Creation - the [[:Aegis of Aggramar]].}}
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Vrykul legends speak of a trial - to conquer this trial is prove one's worth and lay claim to the Aegis.}}
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Impressive, aren't they? The new guns could bag a wyvern at full speed from three hundred meters. Go ahead, have a look.}}

Interact with the [[Skyfire Deck Gun]].
