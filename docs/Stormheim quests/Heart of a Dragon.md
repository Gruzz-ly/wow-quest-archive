==Objectives==
Find and rescue the mother of the Thorignir brood.
* Find the Thorignir Mother
* [[Azariah]] slain

==Description==
Through brute force and corruption, the [[God-King Skovald|God-King]] has taken the power you seek, but there may be hope for you and the [[Thorignir]], <class>.

With the aid of fel powers such as I've never seen, the [[Drekirjar]] are corrupting our young and seeking to enslave the Thorignir. Their leader, a demon of great power, has captured our mother and seeks to bend her to the God-King's will.

Find her and free her from the demon's grasp - only then might the Thorignir regain our power and grant you aid.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
+150 reputation with the [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
Have you found our brood-mother?

==Completion==
I am relieved to hear that our mother is safe.

I am sure she will wish to thank you herself.

==Notes==
Enter the [[Thorignir Refuge]] and find Azariah and [[Thrymjaris]] on the bottom.
