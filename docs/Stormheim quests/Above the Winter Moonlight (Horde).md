==Objectives==
Grapple across from the tower and climb to the top of the mountain path.
* Grapple to the Mountain Path
* Reach the Top of the Path

==Description==
There, it looks like there's a good spot to launch to right across from here. This path should take you all the way to the top.

According to my intel, your dragons should be up there. Let's just hope that they're still in a state to help you.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)

==Completion==
You are here for the trial? I'm afraid you might be too late.

This battle with the [[Drekirjar]] has taken its toll. I am to weak to grant you the power you seek...

But perhaps you may be able to help...

==Gains==
* 15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
