==Objectives==
Toss ingredients from the [[Basket of Root Vegetables]], [[Barrel of Crabs]], and [[Hearty Vrykul Grains]] into [[Havi's Stewpot]].
* Root Vegetables added
* Crabs added
* Hearty Grains added

==Description==
I could sense your power the moment you arrived in this land. You carry great purpose and a heavy task. 

Know that the [[:Aegis of Aggramar]] rests in the high halls of the All-Father. Only if you prove your valor, can you claim it against your foe. 

Many trials must you face for this, but first I must know your strength. My stew is incomplete, and my old bones couldn't carry the ingredients up the hill. 

You look like you have a good arm. Will you help an old man finish his stew?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Completion==
Hah, you throw like a [[shieldmaiden]]!

What? That's a good thing!

Try the stew, young champion, and savor the taste of a task well done.

==Notes==
On accept:

Stir the [[Pot of Stew]].
* Pot of Stew Stirred

;Description
So, you wish to prove yourself in the ancient trials...

Why else would you be here? I could sense your power the moment you arrived in this land.

The [[Aegis of Aggramar]] rests in the [[High Hall of the All-Father]]. How would a mortal claim it?

<Havi's stomach groans loudly.>

Here is your first test...

Stir. That. Cookpot.

;Completion
Ah... smells delicious, doesn't it?
