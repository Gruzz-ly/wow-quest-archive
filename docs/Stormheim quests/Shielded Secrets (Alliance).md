==Objectives==
Examine 6 Engraved Vrykul Shields in [[Skold-Ashil]]. 
* Examine [[Engraved Shield]]s (6)

==Description==
It's obvious at this point that the [[Horde]] wants something in [[Skold-Ashil]].  Unfortunately we still don't know what they're after.

We think the secret lies with the [[shieldmaiden]]s here, so we need to find out more about them.  Some early scouting revealed that they have a method of carving their shields to tell their stories.

Go into the city and find as many of these shields as you can.  With luck, we will find what [[Sylvanas]] seeks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
[[Val'kyr]], you say? This is worse that I had imagined. If Sylvanas is able to create more Val'kyr, there will be no limit to her armies!

It seems the vault is her goal. We must stop her!

==Notes==
Each shield shows a unique text when clicked.

First shield:
:The engravings on the shield depict a goddess of the shieldmaidens, watching over them in battle.
:Above her is inscribed the name "[[Eyir]]".

Second shield:
:This shield appears to show various trials undergone by the warriors of Skold-Ashil.
:A depiction of the nearby temple adorns the center.

Third shield:
:An image of a shieldmaiden is carved on this shield, kneeling before an elaborate spear.
:The priestesses of the temple stand nearby, silently observing the rite.

Fourth shield:
:The scene on this shield shows one of the shieldmaidens hovering above a statue of an ancient champion of Skold-Ashil.
:The shieldmaiden is glowing with a radiant aura, and is held aloft by golden wings.

Fifth shield:
:Upon this shield, an engraving of Eyir stands at the entrance to the titan vault.
:She appears to be welcoming a winged champion of the shieldmaidens inside.

Sixth shield:
:This shield bears an image of a winged shieldmaiden lifting the body of a fallen vrykul from a battlefield.
:The shieldmaiden's image appears eerily similar to that of a [[Val'kyr]].
