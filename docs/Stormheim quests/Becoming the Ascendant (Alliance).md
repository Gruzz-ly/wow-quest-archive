==Objectives==
Seek the blessings at the four shrines in the temple at [[Skold-Ashil]], then commune with the statue.
*[[Eyir's Helm]]
*[[Eyir's Pauldron]]
*[[Eyir's Shield]]
*[[Eyir's Spear]]
*Commune with the [[Statue (Stormheim)|Statue]]

==Description==
Our course is now clear.  We must enter the vault and prevent [[Sylvanas]] from obtaining the power to create more [[Val'kyr]].

The entrance is barred, which is likely what has kept her out so far, but you may have already uncovered the key to this barrier.

You must become the next ascendant.

Complete the rites as depicted on the shields and take down the barrier to the vault.  I will send word to [[Genn Greymane|Greymane]] of our findings - he will wish to confront Sylvanas himself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
It is good to see you, <name>. 

The assault on [[Dreadwake's Landing]] fared poorly, and I had thought our cause lost until Crowley informed me of your success.

Now, let's finish this!

==Notes==
Upon gaining all blessings, interact with the statue:
:Before you stands a statue depicting the leader of the Shieldmaidens in [[Skold-Ashil]].
:Her features look familiar...
{{gossip|Attempt to commune with the statue.}}
: ''A bright light fills the screen; when it fades, the immediate surroudings are encircled with light.  [[Ashildir]] hovers in front of her statue as the player slowly rises to her level.''
: {{text|say|Ashildir|What is this?  The hero of [[Helheim]] seeks entrance to the vault?}}
: {{text|say|Ashildir|I know your worth.  I will grant you an audience with [[Eyir]].}}
: ''As she next speaks, Ashildir charges up a spell and dispels the vault's barrier.''  (Genn will also phase in once this happens.)
: {{text|say|Ashildir|You may proceed, but know that Eyir may not regard you as I do.}}
: {{text|say|Ashildir|Seek your fate in the vault, <name>.  May Eyir be your wings.}}
: ''A bright light fills the screen once more as the communion ends, and the player drops back to the ground.''
