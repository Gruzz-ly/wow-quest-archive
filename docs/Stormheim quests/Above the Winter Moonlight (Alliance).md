==Objectives==
Grapple across from the tower and climb to the top of the mountain path.
* Grapple to the Mountain Path
* Reach the Top of the Path

==Description==
You should have a good vantage from this tower to grapple over to the mountain path. I can't help you once you're across, but you should be able to take it all the way up to the top. I hope you're able to find what you need from the [[storm dragon|dragon]]s up there. Who knows what the [[God-King Skovald|God-King]] has done to them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Completion==
You are here for the trial? I'm afraid you might be too late.

This battle with these [[Felskorn]] has taken its toll. I am too weak to grant you the power you seek...

But perhaps you may be able to help...
