==Objectives==
Plant 3 [[Gilnean Heavy Explosive]]s onto the hull of Greymane's ship and detonate them at a safe distance.
*Explosives Planted (3)
*Explosives Detonated
*[[Detonator (Stormheim)]] (provided)

==Description==
It looks like the Gilnean infiltrators brought some heavy ordnance to the fight. It's likely they intend to use them on the walls of [[Dreadwake's Landing]].

If these could be rigged to Greymane's ship, it could make for a decisive end to his assault on the outpost.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

|Runesworn Armbands
|Runespeaker's Mantle

You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<insert>

==Completion==
By the Dark Lady's favor, you did it! I witnessed the explosion from here - there's no way that Greymane could have survived such destruction!

You have done a great deed today for the Forsaken. Rest assured, it will be remembered.

==Notes==
Upon planting the Explosives
