==Objectives==
Defeat God-King Skovald in the [[Gates of Valor]].
* [[God-King Skovald]] defeated

==Description==
It would seem that the portals we destroyed down here were not the only ones. Demons still pour in from the top of the Gates of Valor's edifice, summoned by the God-King himself!

I cannot face Skovald alone. Come, champion, let us take the battle to him and end this threat!

For Stormheim!

==Progress==
Have you confronted Skovald, champion?

==Completion==
It's unfortunate that the God-King escaped, but his defeat has stemmed the flow of the Legion into Stormheim.

Now, the Halls of Valor await you.

==Notes==
Talk to Vethir again:
:God-King Skovald has been spotted at the top of the gates.

:When you are ready, we will take the fight to him!

{{gossip|''Take me to the top, Vethir!''}}

As you're flying up:
:{{text|say|Vethir|Let us put an end to Skovald's minions once and for all!}}

Aggro:
:{{text|yell|God-King Skovald|Don't think you stand a chance simply because you have come this far. You are nothing! NOTHING!}}

Summoning reinforcements:
*{{text|yell|God-King Skovald|My forces are limitless!}}
*{{text|yell|God-King Skovald|Minions of the Legion, destroy these worms!}}
: {{text|bossemote|God-King Skovald summons a pack of felstalkers!}}

*{{text|yell|God-King Skovald|Thousands of worlds will be mine to conquer!}}
: {{text|bossemote|God-King Skovald summons a squad of Felskorn vrykul!}}

Defeated:
:{{text|yell|God-King Skovald|Enough! I grow tired of this.}}
:The player is stunned with Demonic Bindings, and Skovald jumps off and lands on his mount.
:{{text|yell|God-King Skovald|The Aegis will be mine you fools, and there's nothing you can do to stop me.}}
:{{text|say|Vethir|We are done here, champion. Let us return to Havi.}}

;Vethir
: Skovald may have escaped, but victory is still ours. His demons will no longer be able to plague Stormheim, thanks to you.

: Let us return to the gates, friend. I believe that Havi will wish to thank you.

''{{gossip|Take me back to the Gates of Valor.}}''

Flying back down:
:{{text|say|Vethir|The God-King's demon allies will no longer threaten Stormheim.}}
:{{text|say|Vethir|It is time you pursue Skovald into the high halls.}}

==Progression==

;Objectives
Defeat Valgrinn in the Gates of Valor.
* [[Valgrinn Possessor|Valgrinn]] slain

;Description
It would seem that the portals we destroyed down here were not the only ones. Demons still pour in from the top of the Gates of Valor's edifice, summoned by a demon of great power.

I cannot face this demon alone. Come, champion, let us take the battle to him and end Skovald's demonic threat!

For Stormheim!

;Completion
With the demon felled and the Tideskorn shattered, surely it is time to celebrate!

But wait! Where is the God-King?

;Notes
Talk to Vethir again:
:The demon leading Skovald's fel allies has been spotted at the top of the gates.
:When you are ready, we will take the fight to him!
{{gossip|''Take me to the top, Vethir!''}}

After defeating Valgrinn:
:{{text|say|Vethir|We are done here, champion. Let us return to Havi.}}
Talk to Vethir:
:Victory is ours! We have eliminated the source of Skovald's demons.
:Let us return to the gates, friend. I believe that Havi will wish to thank you.
