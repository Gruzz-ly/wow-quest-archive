==Objectives==
Recover the Transponder Battery from [[Dread-Rider Malwick]].
* [[Transponder Battery]]

==Description==
We need to report our position to the Alliance navy ASAP!

I am building a new transponder to send a distress signal, but I need a battery from the Skyfire's communications console.

You'll find the console at the top of the ship - I just hope those undead haven't put their creepy, bony fingers on it yet!

==Rewards==

You will also receive: {{cost|14|60|}}

==Progress==
I cannot build a new transponder without that battery!

==Completion==
NUTS and BOLTS!

Pardon my language.

This thing is almost as dead as the guy you took it from. We need juice, and lots of it. I have an idea...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Supplies From the Skies]], [[Boarded!]], and [[See Ya Later, Oscillator]] before heading out.

Head downhill to the wreck and start killing [[Forsaken Bat-Rider]]s and [[Forsaken Deathstalker]]s. [[Skyfire First Aid Kit]]s are in Skyfire Medical Supplies crates all over the area. There's a Forsaken Deathstalker trying to use [[Pick Lock]] on a Treasure Chest towards the stern of the ship on the lower deck. It contains the [[Skyfire Engineer's Multitool]] and a [[Detailed Gunship Schematic]]. On the top deck, in what was the bridge and communications area of the ship, find [[Dread-Rider Malwick]], who holds the [[Transponder Battery]].

South of the ship, accessed from the upper deck, is another Forsaken camp. The [[Crystal Oscillator]] is found at the southernmost end of the quest area.

==Progression==
{{Stormheim (Alliance)}}
