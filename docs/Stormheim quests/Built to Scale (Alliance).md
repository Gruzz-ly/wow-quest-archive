==Objectives==
Collect Storm Drake Scales from the Stormwing drakes in [[Hrydshal|Hrydhsal]].{{sic}}
* [[Storm Drake Scale]] (50)

==Description==
The [[vrykul]] around here seem to use scales from these drakes to fashion their armor. 

If you were able to gather enough material from the local drakes, you may be able to make something useful out of it.
