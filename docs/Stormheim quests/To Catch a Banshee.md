==Objectives==
Meet with [[Genn Greymane]] in [[Greywatch]].

==Description==
The [[Havi|strange-talking vrykul]] said I might be able to meet you here.  I have orders from Greymane.  It seems he may have a lead on [[Sylvanas]]' location.

He's set up a camp near the base of the mountain.  We've run into some troubles, though.  It looks like the [[Horde]] may have homed in on our position.

We could use your help.  You can take my [[gryphon]].  Just speak to me when you're ready to leave.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
* 1480 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is good you arrived when you did, <name>.

==Notes==
Upon completing [[A Heavy Burden]], [[Ensign Ward]] in [[Valdisdall]] will offer this quest. Riding the gryphon to Greywatch is optional, you can walk there instead.

''Approach:''
: {{text|say|Ensign Ward|Champion!  I bear orders from Greymane!}}

;Gossip
You are needed at Greywatch, <sir/ma'am>.

Whenever you're ready.
