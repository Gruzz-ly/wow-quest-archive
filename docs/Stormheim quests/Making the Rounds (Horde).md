As you can see, we have spared no expense in showing our support of your great quest.

Final preparations are being made - come, walk with me.

*{{cost|1|54}}
*1,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
As soon as preparations are complete, we set out for Stormheim.

==Completion==
Do you understand the gravity of our task? If we do not fight for our future, we will not have one.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Sylvanas begins walking across the ship.''
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Are you familiar with the [[vrykul]]? Towering, brutish [[warrior]]s from an ancient stock. Subtlety is not a value they hold in high regard.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Their legends speak of the [[:Aegis of Aggramar]]. To claim it, one must undergo some kind of trial. One must be... worthy.}}
:''She stops next to a [[Forsaken Catapult]].''
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|The new catapults are faster and more powerful than ever before. I have our [[goblin]] allies to thank for that.}}
Interact with the catapult to complete the first objective.
:''Sylvanas turns and walks back the way she came.''
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Truthfully, [[Stormheim]] holds another treasure. One that I will be pursuing by my own means.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|I trust you are more than capable of handling whatever trials stand between you and the Aegis.}}
:''She stops before a group of [[Forsaken Ranger]]s.''
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|[[Nathanos Blightcaller|Nathanos]] has been training a new generation of [[Dark ranger|rangers]]. They represent both our past, and our future.}}
An [[Extra Action Button]] to salute the rangers pops up. Use it to complete the second objective.
:''Sylvanas walks up the stairs to stand next to [[Dread-Captain Tattersail]].''
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|I think often about our future, hero. My people cannot reproduce. Are we not destined, then, to wither away eventually?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|No. The [[Forsaken]] will never stop fighting.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Not while I reign. Not when there are still beings out there with the power to stop death.}}
:{{text|say|Dread-Captain Tattersail|News from [[Captain Dreadwake]], my lady. They have found the temple.}}
:{{text|say|Dread-Captain Tattersail|[[The Oblivion]] has landed nearby. They are building fortifications now and will be ready to lay siege at your command.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Good. Send a bat - tell them we are leaving shortly.}}
At this point the final objective auto-completes and the quest can be turned in.
