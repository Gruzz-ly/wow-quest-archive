==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Drekirjar]] [[vrykul]] in [[Thorim's Peak]].
* Drekirjar vrykul slain (10)

==Description==
The Drekirjar who have assaulted the summit are empowered by tainted magics like I have never seen. If we wish to strike back at them, we will need to thin down their numbers.

Awaken your fury, <class>, and take the battle to them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
+150 reputation with the [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
Are we rid of the Felskorn threat?

==Completion==
The Drekirjar have witnessed true strength today.

They will think twice before raising their blades to you again.

==Notes==
Kill [[Felskorn Trapper]]s and [[Felskorn Executioner]]s.

==Progression==
{{Where Dragons Rule}}
