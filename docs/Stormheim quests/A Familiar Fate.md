==Objectives==
Collect the Jailer's Shard from [[Dravax]] and free [[Vethir]] from his prison.
* [[Jailer's Shard]]
* Vethir Freed

==Description==
We had come to defend the [[Halls of Valor]]... I was taken from the sky...

I cannot break free of my bindings. Find the jailer who made this cell...

Set me free, friend...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
* 15,050 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Valarjar]]

==Progress==
The jailer has... the key...

==Completion==
You still manage to surprise me, outsider. Your trials are complete, and yet you have challenges to face.

The God-King's forces are many, but in your artifact you posess<!-- sic --> the powers of Stormheim herself! Approach the gates, and these powers will lay low the enemies of this land!

Now, let us take the flight to the God-King, and cleanse the [[Gates of Valor]] of his fel taint!

==Notes==
Click the [[Circle of Binding]]:
:This fel circle is similar to the ones used in [[Skovald]]'s attempts to enslave the [[Thorignir]] dragons of [[Thorim's Peak]].
:It appears to be too powerful to break by normal means.
