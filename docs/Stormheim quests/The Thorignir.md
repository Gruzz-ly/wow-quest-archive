==Objectives==
Speak with the [[Thorignir]] Broodmother.
*Take the Portal in the [[Roasted Ram]] Inn (Optional)
*Speak with [[Thrymjaris]]
*Speak with [[Vyranoth]]

==Description==
The Thorignir of [[Stormheim]] have the strength and power to greatly aid us in defending [[Amirdrassil]], but they have yet to come to the [[Dragon Isles]]. I suspect this... [[Odyn]] has interfered with their journey.

We will go and speak with their matriarch. [[Wrathion]] tells me her brood is amenable to your kind, and to assisting others.

We will investigate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We will find out why this brood of [[storm drake]]s did not heed the call of the Isles.

==Completion==
How dare he deny any dragons the right to go anywhere!

==Notes==
Upon accept, the [[Blacktalon Mage]] opens a Portal to Stormheim next to Vyranoth. Take it to be teleported to [[Thorim's Peak]]. Vyranoth and Wrathion are already there. Speak with Thrymjaris:

{{book|content=
We have heard the call, but we cannot answer.

{{Gossip|quest=|Why haven't you gone to the Dragon Isles?}}

My brood and I are honor-bound to attend [[Odyn]], our patron and creator.

We have heard the call of the Isles, but Odyn has forbidden us to go. The problems of [[dragon]]s are nothing to him--and as we serve him, we must honor our pledge and follow his judgment.

Less honorable storm drakes have broken ties and left, but my brood and I have remained here.

Truth be told, I would go if it were allowed--but I am bound to remain here.
}}

Speak with Vyranoth:
{{book|content=
How... dare he! How DARE an interloper such as that creature believe he is allowed to compel blind obedience from a dragon. How dare he keep these dragons from their birthright!

I will not stand for this.

Wrathion. <Name>. We are going to pay this Odyn a visit.

It will be... enlightening.

For everyone.

*{{Gossip|quest=|If you're certain...}}
*{{Gossip|quest=|I see...}}
*{{Gossip|quest=|You have no idea how long I have been waiting to punch Odyn in the face.}}
*{{Gossip|quest=|I just want to get some loot, lady.}}
*{{ClassIcon|Warrior}} {{Gossip|quest=|I know Odyn personally... we should be careful.}}
*{{ClassIcon|Warrior}} {{Gossip|quest=|I know Odyn personally, I cannot WAIT to punch him.}}
