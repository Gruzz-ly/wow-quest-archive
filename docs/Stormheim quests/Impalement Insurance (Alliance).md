==Objectives==
Use the High Explosive Grenades to destroy the Harpoon Launchers atop the walls in [[Hrydshal]].
* [[Harpoon Launcher (Stormheim)|Harpoon Launchers]] Destroyed (7)
* [[High Explosive Grenades]] (provided)

==Description==
I've got bad news. Those harpoon launchers up on the walls might cause us some problems.

They can't get at us down here, but once you start climbing that path, they're likely going to try to skewer you.

If you use that grapple launcher, you should be able to get on top of the walls and dismantle them. Watch out for the drakes, though!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Completion==
Hah! I bet they never saw that coming!

Seems like we've got no shortage of obstacles left, though.
