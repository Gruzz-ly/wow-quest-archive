==Objectives==
Use the Sharp Wooden Stake to kill Blood-Thane Lucard in [[Dreyrgrot]].
* [[Blood-Thane Lucard]] slain{{Co|72.2|51.6|Stormheim}}
* [[Sharp Wooden Stake]] (provided)

==Description==
Most Fascinating{{Sic}}! It would appear that we're dealing with our very own [[vrykul]] [[vampyr]]!

All we have encountered have been of [[San'layn|blood elven descent]], but it has long been theorized that the vrykul have suffered the curse as well. It's too bad he's awake - I would dearly like a subject to study.

Oh well, guess there's nothing for it. Take this stake and put it through the old chap's heart. I'm pretty sure that should do the trick.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of these rewards:
|q1=|Dreadsworn Breastplate|c1={{ClassIcon|DeathKnight}}{{ClassIcon|Paladin}}{{ClassIcon|Warrior}}

|q4=|Runespeaker's Vestments|c4={{ClassIcon|Mage}}{{ClassIcon|Priest}}{{ClassIcon|Warlock}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Valarjar]]
*[[The Blood-Thane's Amulet]]

==Completion==
Oh, the stake didn't work you say?  My apologies, I must've had my immortal evil [[undead]] mixed up.

You're all in one piece though, and the evil has seen its end. Hopefully, at least.

Vampyr can die, can't they?

==Notes==
[[File:Blood-Thane Lucard - Consume the Living.jpg|thumb|Blood-Thane Lucard casting Consume the Living on a [[Drained Corsair]].]]
Due to a gap in the path, getting into the tomb requires either flying or the use of a [[Stormforged Grapple Launcher]]. There is one of the latter next to Finley in case the player has not yet obtained one.

Interact with the sleeping Lucard to perform "Staking" and wake him up.
:{{Text|say|Blood-Thane Lucard|Fool! Did you really think a little piece of wood would stop me?!}}
:{{Text|yell|Blood-Thane Lucard|You will bleed!}}

During combat, he casts "Lingering Hunger" (teleports to and briefly stuns the player), "Blood Ritual" (jumps to an alcove and channels blood orbs that move toward the player and deal damage), and most importantly "Consume the Living", which causes him to channel on a [[Drained Corsair]] and, if he completes the cast, heal for 20%. Kill the Corsair to interrupt the heal.
