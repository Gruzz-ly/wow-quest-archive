==Objectives==
Collect the Forsaken Scouting Orders from [[Dread-Rider Stalker]]s and [[Dread-Rider Plaguebringer]]s near [[Greywatch]]. 
* [[Forsaken Scouting Orders]]

==Description==
We still have little knowledge of the [[Horde]]'s activities in the region, but I'm hoping you can help change that.

Lately the woods have been crawling with [[Sylvanas]]' agents.  The few we have taken out carried orders from her [[Dark ranger|Dark Ranger]]s, who are no doubt in command of her forces here.

While you're on the hunt, keep an eye out for any scouting orders.  They may help us pinpoint Sylvanas' objective in the area.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you found?

==Completion==
Excellent. The puzzle is finally coming together. 

We may not know why Sylvanas' forces are here, but I think we know where they are.

==Progression==
{{To Catch a Banshee}}
