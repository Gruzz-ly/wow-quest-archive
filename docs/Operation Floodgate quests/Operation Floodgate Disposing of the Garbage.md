{{Questportrait|Geezle Gigazap.jpg|Geezle Gigazap|Geezle is a real piece of garbage. Out for his own interests and making the cartels look bad.}}
Defeat [[Geezle Gigazap]] in [[Operation: Floodgate]]
* Dispose of Geezle Gigazap

==Description==
Hey, pal. I've heard murmurs of a real piece of work trying to siphon off energy at the [[Waterworks (Operation: Floodgate)|Waterworks]] in the [[Ringing Deeps]].

Stealing from our stone friends ain't good for business, and it certainly ain't something we're willing to let continue.

I know you've made a name for yourself for disposing of the trash, and bad business folks are certainly as trashy as they come.

Do me a favor, will ya? Weapons are optional, but attitude is required... if you catch my drift.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|93|60}}

==Progress==
Yo, you take care of that "thing" for me?

==Completion==
Thanks pal. The cartels will remember what you did for them.

==Progression==
