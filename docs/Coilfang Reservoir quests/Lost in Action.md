==Objectives==
Discover what happened to [[Naturalist Bite]] and [[Weeder Greenthumb]]. Then, return to [[Watcher Jhang]].

* [[Weeder Greenthumb]] Discovered

==Description==
You have to help me! We were sent here to investigate the various parts of the reservoir, but my friends haven't come back yet, and it's been a long time.

That's why I need you to discover what became of them. Naturalist Bite and Weeder Greenthumb went this way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*22000 XP (or {{coppercost|13200}} at max level)

==Progress==
Have you discovered anything?

==Completion==
The loss of life...it pains me.

<Watcher Jhang sighs.>

Thank you, <name>. When we are all reunited, the [[naga]] won't stand a chance.

==Patch changes==
