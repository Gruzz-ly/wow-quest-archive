'''WANTED: The Warlord's Treatise''' is one of the random [[heroic mode]] [[Daily Quest]]s given by [[Wind Trader Zhareem]] in [[Shattrath City]].

==Objectives==
[[Wind Trader Zhareem]] has asked you to acquire [[The Warlord's Treatise]]. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.

This quest may only be completed on Heroic difficulty.
* [[The Warlord's Treatise]]

==Description==
While it is known that [[Warlord Kalithresh]] of the naga is a great warrior in his own right, there are fewer who know that he has codified all of his knowledge.

One of my customers is aware of it though, and is keenly interested in obtaining his treatise.

I ask that you travel to the [[Steamvault]] in [[Coilfang Reservoir]] and obtain this book for me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|20|}}
* 16,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with the [[Consortium]]
* +350 reputation with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
My customer grows restless. I believe he wishes to plumb the depths of the warlord's tactical thinking to help with one of his ongoing conflicts.

==Completion==
Indeed, I fear my customer will not have time to peruse the entirety of this book. Nevertheless, that is not our concern.  Here is your reward.

Come back tomorrow and I will have another request for you to fulfill.

==Notes==
This quest simply requires completing Heroic [[Steam Vaults]]. It was added in [[2.3]] as part of a series to give more incentive to run [[Heroic]] instances.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Re-added and rewards adjusted.}}
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Removed.}}
*{{Patch 2.3.0|note=Added.}}
