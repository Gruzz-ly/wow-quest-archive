'''WANTED: The Heart of Quagmirran''' is one of the random [[heroic mode]] [[Daily Quest]]s given by [[Wind Trader Zhareem]] in [[Shattrath City]].

==Objectives==
[[Wind Trader Zhareem]] has asked you to obtain [[The Heart of Quagmirran]].  Deliver it to him in Shattrath's [[Lower City]] to collect the reward.

This quest may only be completed on Heroic difficulty.
* [[The Heart of Quagmirran]]

==Description==
I have an unusual request.  A certain wealthy individual that I am in contact with off-world is interested in a macabre piece.

Specifically, she wants the heart of [[Quagmirran]].

I hear that [[Fungal giant|the beast]] has three, but one will suffice for our purposes.  As I understand it, you can find Quagmirran resting within a deep pool of water at the [[Slave Pens]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|20|}}
* 16,250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with the [[Consortium]]
* +350 reputation with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
I trust that you know of a way to preserve the heart in transit?

==Completion==
Now that I think of it, it's a pity I didn't ask you to return with the other two hearts as well.  Perhaps next time.  In any case, you've earned your commission.

Come back tomorrow and I will have another request for you to fulfill.

==Notes==
This quest simply requires completing Heroic [[Slave Pens]].  It was added in [[2.3]] as part of a series to give more incentive to run [[Heroic]] instances.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Re-added and rewards adjusted.}}
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Removed.}}
*{{Patch 2.3.0|note=Added.}}
