==Objectives==
[[Jaga]] wants you to collect 5 [[Windswept Balloon]]s from [[Orgrimmar]].

* [[Windswept Balloon]] (5)

== Description ==
Please, <mister/miss>, you just gotta help me!

My pa brought me a bunch of balloons from the [[Darkmoon Faire]].  Best... gift... EVER!  They're magical, you know, and never lose their floatiness!

There's just one thing...

A big ol' gust of wind blew 'em right outta of my hands. They're scattered all over Orgrimmar!

I'd chase after 'em myself, but this city's so big I'd get lost for sure.

Can you round 'em up for me before they float away?

Please?

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost||12|}}
|Horde Balloon}}

== Progress ==
Did you find all of my balloons, <mister/miss>? 

== Completion ==
This is GREAT! You did it!

Thanks, <mister/miss>!

== Gains ==
Upon completing this quest you will also receive:  

*1,550 [[XP]]

== Notes ==
*The [[Windswept Balloon]]s can be found all throughout [[Orgrimmar]], but seem to be found mostly around trees.
*[[Flight Master's License]] is helpful but not necessary for this quest. Balloons are accessible via ground mount.
*After the quest is completed, Jaga will be lifted off the ground by the balloons and drift slowly upwards, exclaiming as he goes:
**{{text|say|Jaga|This is great!}}
**{{text|say|Jaga|Wahoo!}}
**{{text|say|Jaga|You're the best, <name>!}}
**{{text|say|Jaga|Thanks, <name>! I'll tell my pa you helped me see the world!}}
