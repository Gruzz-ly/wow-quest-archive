:{{text|say|Hallegosa|This way <name>. The ceremony is about to begin.}}
''The spellcaster hops on a disk that hovers up in the sky, just 35 meters above the ground. A quartet of Blue Dragons surround the player, anxious for the ceremony. Kalecgos himself arrives.''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Welcome, friend. We've been expecting you.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|You're to be congruatulated for your success in the [[Firelands]].}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|But praise alone won't suffice.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|[[Blue Dragonflight|We]] owe you a great deal for the part you've played in the destiny of our flight.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Present me [[Runestaff of Nordrassil|your staff]] that we may endow it with great power.}}
''The player grabs the Runestaff from his/her back and presents it to the dragons. They empower the runestaff with their magic powers.''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Finally. [[Tarecgosa]], our beloved sister whose essence you've generously born, has chosen [[Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest|this staff]] as her permanent home.}}
''Tarecgosa moves over to the staff and dives in, thus completing the staff''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|May her presence be a source of comfort and companionship to you.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|We thank you, Friend of the Blue Dragonflight.}}
''The ceremony is complete. An image of the player sitting on Tarecgosa's shoulders is seen.''
