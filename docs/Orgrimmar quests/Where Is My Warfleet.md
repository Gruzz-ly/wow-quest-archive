==Objectives==
Speak with [[Warlord Krogg]] at [[Bilgewater Port]] in [[Azshara]].

==Description==
The Highlands are the home of the Dragonmaw orcs. If we show them our might they would ally with us against the Twilight's Hammer. I am certain!

The fleet is gathering at Bilgewater Port in Azshara but there are reports of delays.<br>
You did good getting the goblins to work, I need your skills here too.<br>
Find Warlord Krogg in Azshara and see what is taking so long. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|80}}
*9550 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
What, another message from Saurfang? Bah, I knew if these delays kept pilling up we'd be eventually have his attention on us.

Have you ever worked with goblins before? Everywhere is another hidden cost! Our ships lie half-assembled and the air fleet is scattered to the winds.

If this invasion is going to happen, I'm going to need your help.

;Description
We have a map of the Highland approaches. The plan is clear: we will show ourselves in force. The Dragonmaw orcs, on seeing the might of our combined forces on their shore, will have no choice but to ally with us in our crusade to destroy the Twilight's Hammer.

The fleet is assembling at Bilgewater Port in Azshara. I grow impatient with their progress.

<Class>! You have a knack for greasing the wheels of my war machine. Seek out Warlord Krogg in Azshara and find out what's taking so long.

What, another message from Hellscream? His patience is thinner than calf's hide.
