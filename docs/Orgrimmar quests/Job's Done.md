==Objectives==
Return to [[Commander Dresh]] at [[Grommash Hold]] in [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
I'll stick around here a bit longer to ensure the [[peon]]s get back to work.

You should return to Orgrimmar and let Commander Dresh know that he does not need to fret about the outpost any longer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
The peons have returned? That is good news, indeed.

Let us hope this doesn't happen again, for their sake.

==Notes==
The fastest way back to Orgrimmar is through the portal in [[Dragonmaw Port]]. Upon completion:
:{{Text|say|Commander Dresh|Work has resumed, High Chieftain. I'm pleased to see the [[Horde]] takes these issues seriously.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Baine Bloodhoof]]|We do, Commander. But I cannot take credit for this fortunate turn of events.}}

Dresh turns around and walks out of the hold, passing Kiro who is now standing in the corner next to the entrance. Talk to Kiro to pick up [[On the Outskirts]].
