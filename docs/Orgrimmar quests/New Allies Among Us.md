==Objectives==
Witness [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]] welcome the [[vulpera]] into the [[Horde]].
*Witness Baine welcome the vulpera to the Horde

==Description==
Even in times of peace, the Horde is not without its problems.

Although they can be overwhelming at times, our struggles should never stop us from remembering what it means to be a part of the Horde.

We don't turn people away when times get tough; we band together and endure.

For a moment I forgot this. Burdened by the troubles facing our new allies, I hastily dismissed the [[vulpera]].

My only hope is that they still see as much value in the Horde as I see in them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|70|20}}
|Caravan Hyena
}}

You will also receive: [[Allied Races: Vulpera]]

==Completion==
Vulpera within the Horde. A practical partnership, don't you agree? One that would not have been possible without your help.

Thanks to you, <name>, we now have a home beyond the dunes.

==Notes==
On accept, Baine begins speaking while [[Kiro]], [[Meerah]], and [[Nisha]] all walk into the center of the room to stand in front of the High Chieftain.
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Kiro, I must apologize for so hastily dismissing you earlier.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|The Horde endures because we band together in times of adversity.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Though I turned you away, you selflessly came to our aid. Just as you did in [[Vol'dun]].}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Such is the true spirit of the Horde. If you still desire to join us, you would be most welcome within our ranks.}}
:{{Text|say|Kiro|It would be our honor, High Chieftain.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Then it is decided. From this day forth, the vulpera of Vol'dun are allies of the Horde!}}

Talk to Kiro one last time to turn in. Upon completion:
:{{Text|say|Meerah|They don't eat [[alpaca]]s here, right?}}

Congratulations! You have now unlocked [[Vulpera (playable)|playable vulpera]].
