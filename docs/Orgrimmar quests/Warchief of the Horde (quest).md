'''Warchief of the Horde''' concludes the storyline of ''[[Battle for Azeroth]]''.

==Objectives==
Witness the gathering of champions.
* Speak with [[Valeera Sanguinar]]

==Description==
The meeting to decide the next [[Warchief]] of the [[Horde]] is about to begin.

The other leaders of the Horde have already arrived. They are waiting for you inside the [[Orgrimmar Embassy|embassy]].

Speak with me when you are ready, and we will greet the others together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Speak with me when you are ready, and we will greet the others together.

==Completion==
It has been decided, then. There will no longer be a Warchief of the Horde.

It seems that we have been made witnesses to the beginning of a [[Horde Council|new era...]]

==Notes==
Speak to Valeera.

:If history has anything to teach us, it is that peace between the Alliance and Horde is perillously short-lived.
:{{Gossip|I am ready to meet with the other champions of the Horde.}}

A cutscene will play.
:''Valeera is seen sitting against the wall, with the [[adventurer]] standing next to her. Both watch on as the meeting commences.''
:{{Text|say|[[Lor'themar Theron]]|The [[Alliance]] has sent word. They have agreed to the armistice. This [[Fourth War|bitter war]] is finally over.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Baine Bloodhoof]]|At last we can begin to heal our wounded [[Earth Mother]]... and the wounded Horde as well.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|One question remains. Who will serve as warchief? Perhaps, you, [[Thrall]], would--}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|No. I told [[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]] I would not lead the Horde again.}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|But perhaps the question is not who should become warchief... but whether there should be one at all.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Though the Horde has changed through the years--for good or ill--we have always looked to a warchief to guide us forward.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|That legacy must end. The war nearly cost us everything. There is no place for a warchief in a time of peace.}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|It is true--the Horde has changed. [[Allied race|Our ranks have grown]], and new voices have stepped forth to lead.}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|This is what makes us strong. All of us, building a new future--together.}}

After you've turned in the quest, you can follow up with some of the participants outside the embassy.

;Lor'themar and [[First Arcanist Thalyssra|Thalyssra]]
[[File:Warchief of the Horde - Lor'themar and Thalyssra.jpg|thumb|Lor'themar and Thalyssra]]
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Thank you again for leading our forces in [[Nazjatar]] alongside me, Thalyssra. Your insight and courage were key to our victory.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|It was an honor, Lor'themar. I am relieved the war is finally over. Now you have no excuse to refuse my invitation to visit [[Suramar]].}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Well, uh... I have been away from [[Silvermoon City|Silvermoon]] for some time. No doubt my people require--}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|[[Halduron Brightwing|Halduron]] has assured me that [[Quel'Thalas]] is quite secure. And [[Grand Magister Rommath|Rommath]] said that if you put up a fuss, he will teleport you to the [[Nighthold]] himself.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|It seems my closest allies are conspiring against me!}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Would it really take a conspiracy for you to spend time alone with me?}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|No, my lady. It would be my pleasure.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|A suitably chivalrous answer, Regent Lord. There may be hope for you yet! Perhaps I can even teach you to relish the... simpler joys of life.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Perhaps you can, First Arcanist. Perhaps you can.}}

;[[Overlord Geya'rah]] and [[Lilian Voss]]
[[File:Warchief of the Horde - Lilian and Geya'rah.jpg|thumb|Lilian and Geya'rah]]
:{{Text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|The {{Au|Mag'har}} have never known life without a warchief. It will be hard for them--and for me. But it seems your people have lost a queen as well.}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|The [[Forsaken]] are torn by turmoil and doubt. Many still love [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]], even after all she has done. Others believe their home remains in the Horde.}}
:{{Text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|And you? Where do your loyalties lie?}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|Where they always have--with the Forsaken. To be raised into [[Undead|undeath]] is to be forever haunted by the ghosts of your past. A caring hand can offer comfort through the pain.}}
:{{Text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|I see no crown upon your head. Are you the new queen they seek?}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|No. I'll speak on my people's behalf, but I won't rule them. There is [[Calia Menethil|another]] I believe will prove better suited to that task... when the time is right.}}
:{{Text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|The love you hold for your people burns as bright as my own for the Mag'har. I wish you good fortune, Lilian Voss.}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|To us all, Overlord.}}

;Baine Bloodhoof and [[Rokhan]]
[[File:Warchief of the Horde - Baine and Rokhan.jpg|thumb|Baine and Rokhan]]
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Since da death of [[Vol'jin]], da [[Darkspear tribe|Darkspear]] been lookin' ta me ta guide dem.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|I been fightin' for dem a long, long time... but dat don't mean I deserve ta be deir [[chieftain]].}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|I felt much the same when [[Cairne Bloodhoof|my father]] died. It happened suddenly, and I feared that I was unprepared to take his place.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|But I was ready, just as you are. You proved that in [[Zuldazar]] and at [[Battle for Stromgarde|Stromgarde]]. The Darkspear have faith in you, and so do I.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Heh. Ya best be stoppin' da flattery, Baine, before it be goin' ta me head.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|But... da Darkspear do be needin' a leader. A voice on da council. And if it gotta be me... den it be me.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Trust your judgment, Rokhan. It has led you this far.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|It be havin' a lotta help. From da Darkspear, from da [[loa]]... and from da Horde.}}

;Thrall and [[Gazlowe]]
[[File:Warchief of the Horde - Gazlowe and Thrall.jpg|thumb|Gazlowe and Thrall]]
:{{Text|say|Thrall|[[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] has fled the city along with the rest of Sylvanas' inner circle. That leaves the [[Bilgewater Cartel]] without its [[trade prince]].}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Gazlowe, it was your cleverness and ingenuity that built the walls of [[Orgrimmar]]. I cannot think of anyone I would trust more to take over as leader.}}
:{{Text|say|Gazlowe|A [[cartel]] ain't a [[clan]] or a [[tribe]], Thrall. [[Steamwheedle Cartel|Steamwheedle]], Bilgewater... it don't matter who supplies the cash--so long as the pay's good.}}
:{{Text|say|Gazlowe|"Under new management" is just another way of sayin' "opportunity's knockin'". So, sure... you got yourself a deal!}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Can you be sure that none of the [[goblin]]s here are still being funded by Gallywix?}}
:{{Text|say|Gazlowe|Oh, I guarantee they are. That's why I'm gonna pay 'em more than that cheapskate.}}

Outside of the embassy from the [[Valley of Strength]], [[Dark Ranger Velonara]] can now be found.

:Greetings, <adventurer>.
:These are interesting times.
:{{Gossip|I see you remained in Orgrimmar.}}
:We [[dark ranger]]s were fiercely loyal to Sylvanas. We trusted her... followed her commands.
:It is clear that our loyalty was never truly reciprocated.
:Some of my sisters and brothers have [[Banshee loyalists|chosen to remain]] at the Dark Lady's side. I, and many others, have not.
:<Velonara's expression becomes steely. Determined.>
:I refuse to be a slave to this torment.
:Both the sin'dorei and Forsaken are my kin. I stand with them, and with the Horde.
