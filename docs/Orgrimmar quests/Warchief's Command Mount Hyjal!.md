==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Cenarion Emissary Blackhoof}} to secure transportation to [[Moonglade]].
*Transportation to Moonglade Secured

==Description==
All able-bodied members of the [[Horde]] are hereby ordered to report to {{NPC||Emissary Windsong}} at [[Nighthaven]] in Moonglade.

Our brothers in the [[Cenarion Circle]] report that {{NPC||Deathwing}}'s minions have launched a destructive offensive against the [[Nordrassil|world tree]] and threaten to burn it to the ground!

Speak with Cenarion Emissary Blackhoof to gain entry into Moonglade. Blackhoof is located in the [[tauren]] district in the [[Valley of Wisdom]] in [[Orgrimmar]].

Onward, <brother/sister>! Destiny calls!

==Completion==
We knew the Horde would send help and not a moment too soon!

==Notes==
Speak with Blackhoof:
:Are you here to help the cause? [[Mount Hyjal]] burns!
{{gossip|''Could you please send me to Moonglade, Emissary?''}}

After the teleport, players wind up in the southwest corner of Nighthaven, near the druid-only flight masters. Run forward to the emissary.
