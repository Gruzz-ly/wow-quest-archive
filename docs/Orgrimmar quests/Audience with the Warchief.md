==Objectives==
Speak to [[High Overlord Saurfang]].
* Report to Saurfang
* Learn the Fate of the Horde

==Description==
Welcome to [[Orgrimmar]], the [[Horde]]'s seat of power.

Tensions are running high, [[demon hunter]]. [[Warchief]] [[Vol'jin]] was gravely wounded in a disastrous assault on the Broken Shore.

I suggest you offer your skills in service of the Horde before your presence is... misinterpreted.

[[High Overlord Saurfang]] commands the city's defenses. Though wary of the [[Illidari]], I believe he will give you a chance to prove your worth.

Speak to him and request passage into [[Grommash Hold]].

==Completion==
Vol'jin's death was part of a larger plan. The Legion thrives on weakening its enemies from within. The demons will strike when their enemy is at its most vulnerable.

Whatever grief the Horde's people are feeling, they can no longer afford to ignore us.

Our time is now, Illidari!

==Notes==
Upon meeting Saurfang:
:{{text|say|High Overlord Saurfang|I don't like the looks of them, mage. They smell of demon filth}}.
Talk to Saurfang to continue:
:<Saurfang looks you up and down with narrowed eyes.
:When Khadgar claimed we would be seeing demon hunters today, I laughed in his face. When he said I should hear you out, I laughed louder.
:And yet, here you are.
:I will permit you alone to enter the [[Grommash Hold|Hold]]. You will leave your weapons and companions at the door. You will not speak until spoken to.
:One false move and my axe will end you.
{{gossip|''Take me inside Grommash Hold.''}}
;Cinematic
:''Sylvanas proceeds to walk further into the room, the hold doors closing behind her while Vol'jin has a coughing fit. Vol'jin begins to speak.''
:{{text|say|Vol'jin|Windrunner. Come... forward.}}
:''Sylvanas moves closer to the throne.''
:{{text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Warchief.}}
:{{text|say|Vol'jin|Da [[loa]] spirits say death will claim me soon.}}
:{{text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|In the end, death claims us all.}}
:''She pauses before continuing.''
:{{text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|But the Horde will live on.}}
:{{text|say|Vol'jin|I have never trusted you. Nor would I have ever imagined... in our darkest time... dat you... would be da one to save us. Da spirits have granted me clarity. A vision... dey whisper a name. Many will not unda'stand. But you must step out of da shadows... and lead. You must be... Warchief...}}
:''Vol'jin dies. Sylvanas remains standing at her spot as Vol'jin's covered body is later taken away on a stretcher by Baine and Lor'themar. The scene then changes to Vol'jin's lit funeral pyre outside a night-time Orgrimmar, with Sylvanas facing the pyre.''
:{{text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Vol'jin is dead.}}
:''She then turns to face the people of the Horde.''
:{{text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Who among you will help me avenge him?}}
:''They roar their assent and break into shouts of "for Vol'jin" and "for the Horde!"''
;Sylvanas
:''Many have gathered at the Dranosh'ar Blockade just outside Orgrimmar to pay their final respects to Vol'jin. At the front of his burning funeral pyre stands Sylvanas, with Lor'themar on her left and Baine on her right, and Gallywix to her far right. [[Nathanos Blightcaller]] and Sylvanas' dark rangers are providing protection.''
