==Objectives==
Buy a [[Wyvern|wind rider]] to [[Razor Hill]] from the wind rider master [[Doras]], then bring Gryshka's Letter to [[Grimtak]] at [[Razor Hill]]. 
*[[Gryshka's Letter]] (provided)

==Description==
My wind riders are trained to fly to many different places, as long as you have already been to that place and spoken with the wind rider master there.

You have been to Razor Hill and spoken to their wind rider master [[Burok]], so now you can fly directly to him from here. Once you're at Raor Hill, you can deliver Gryshka's letter to Grimtak.

Speak with me when you are ready to go.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
* +350 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Have you returned from [[Orgrimmar]]? Did [[Gryshka]] like the meat I sent her?

==Completion==
Hah! I guess she liked it! Nothing brings red to a lady's cheeks like a big, juicy steak!

Thank you, <name>. You've done me a great service. Here is some money for your trouble, and don't be surprised if I invite you to my wedding!
