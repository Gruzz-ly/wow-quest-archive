==Notes==
[[Lenara|Dark Ranger Lenara]] runs off after quest acceptance. Head to Windrunner Spire where Sylvanas and [[Nathanos Blightcaller]] are having a conversation:

:{{text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|...As do I, Dark Lady. But when the time comes, there can be no hesitation.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|There won't be. Safe journey, Nathanos.}}
:''Nathanos leaves.''
:{{text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Safe journey, my love.}}

Speak with Sylvanas:
:Nothing can stop what is to come.

:{{gossip|I am here as you requested.}}

Click the gossip option, then a cutscene begins:
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Ah, champion. I wasn't certain you made it out of [[Orgrimmar]]. If the traitors knew of your service to me, they'd have put you in irons...}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Or worse.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|[[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]]'s [[Reckoning|ill-considered challenge]] may have ended the [[Fourth War|war]] prematurely, but it doesn't matter now.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Countless [[soul]]s have been fed to the [[Maw|hungering darkness]].}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Though I cared nothing for the living, I did pity the [[Forsaken]]. For the great injustice that made them [[Undead|what they are]].}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|I understand the cruelty of fate better than anyone.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|But despite all I taught them, they stubbornly clung to hope. To [[life]].}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|They will learn the truth, along with all the rest.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|My bargain with [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] will yet bear fruit. The armies of [[Azeroth]] will fight [[N'Zoth|her master]], and he will line their streets with corpses.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|In the end, he too will serve [[Death]].}}
:''The [[banshee]]s that haunt Windrunner Spire bow to Sylvanas as she walks away.''
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Enough reflection. There are preparations to be made.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Nothing lasts.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|When next you see me, you will understand.}}
Sylvanas is replaced by Lenara when the cutscene ends.
