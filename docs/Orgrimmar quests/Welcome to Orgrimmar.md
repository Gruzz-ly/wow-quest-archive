==Objectives==
Meet with [[Cork Fizzlepop]] at the city gate.

==Description==
The [[Sylvanas Windrunner|warchief]] will be waiting for our mission report from [[Exile's Reach]]. I must deliver it at once.

For now, Cork Fizzlepop will show you around the city. [[Orgrimmar]] has much to offer, so explore it as you see fit.

I'll send for you once I've given my report to the warchief. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Completion==
Hey, <name>! Long time no see, am I right?

Warlord Grimaxe asked me to show you the sights. Let's go!

==Notes==
