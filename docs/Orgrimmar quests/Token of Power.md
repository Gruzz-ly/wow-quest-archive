==Objectives==
Go to [[Shadowfang Keep]] and obtain the Tenebrous Orb from [[Lord Godfrey (tactics)|Lord Godfrey]], the Book of Lost Souls, and 5 Ghostly Essence.
*[[Tenebrous Orb]]
*[[Book of Lost Souls]]
*[[Ghostly Essence]] (5)

==Description==
Your mastery of our ways continues to grow quickly, <name>, and I am far from the only one impressed by your progress. Even the [[warchief]] has taken note of your deeds.

As a reward for your dedication, the warchief has commissioned his personal enchanter to craft a staff.

The cursed Shadowfang Keep in [[Silverpine Forest]] is the only place to get the materials you'll need. Travel there and retrieve the tenebrous orb held by [[Lord Godfrey]], the Book of Lost Souls, and the essence of the [[ghost]]s haunting the keep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2,300 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*[[Staff of the Left Hand Path]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the materials I'll need for your weapon?

==Completion==
So you are the warlock who will receive this staff. It will be a fitting reward for one so dedicated to the pursuit of power and the ascendancy of the [[Horde]].

==Progression==
#[[Kazak's Behest]] (optional)
#[[Token of Power]]
