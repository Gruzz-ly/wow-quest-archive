==Objectives==
Meditate on the Loa, then pray with the kneeling Forsaken to share your meditations.
*Pray over the [[Supplicant]]

==Description==
This poor Forsaken priest can't seem to find a loa who will bargain with him. Maybe you could give him a blessing instead?

==Progress==
Yes, <name>?

==Completion==
The undead aren't too popular with the loa, but it's good of you to help this one out. Try to show some pity for them if you meet any more who need help, yeah?
