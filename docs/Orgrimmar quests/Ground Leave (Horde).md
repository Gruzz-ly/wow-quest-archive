==Objectives==
Explore [[Orgrimmar]].

*Visit the [[Bank of Orgrimmar|bank]]
*Visit the [[Orgrimmar Embassy|Embassy]]
*Visit the [[Pathfinder's Den|Portal Room]]

==Description==
It seems like our arrival was noticed after all. Maybe there's hope for these people yet.

I'll follow up with [[Ebyssian]] and the [[Horde]] leadership and try to smooth this out. You're on recon.

See what this place has to offer. We may be here for a while, after all.

Come find us once you're finished. Hopefully we'll have all the boring bits sorted out by then.

==Progress==
Report back when you've finished.

==Completion==
But how was the food?

:{{Text|say|Mayla Highmountain|Stand down, warriors of the Horde!}}
:{{Text|say|Mayla Highmountain|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn! It is good to meet a familiar face at the city gate, even when accompanied by others that are... less familiar.}}
:{{Text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|I am glad to find you well, Mayla. But I fear pleasantries will have to wait.}}
:{{Text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|Events are unfolding that imperil us all. These [[dracthyr]] and I must speak with the [[Horde Council]].}}
:{{Text|say|Mayla Highmountain|Then let us not linger. Follow me. Soldiers, return to your posts.}}
:{{Text|say|Mayla Highmountain|If these newcomers have earned your trust, Spiritwalker, then they will have mine as well. The [[gates of Orgrimmar]] stand open to them.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Dark Talon]]|Let us see what this city holds for us.}}
:{{Text|say|Dark Talon|After that long flight, I need food. Something more filling than our dusty rations from [[Forbidden Reach|the Reach]].}}
:''The group enters the city.''

Walking through Orgrimmar, guards and inhabitants have various comments while passing and jumping near them:
*{{Text|say|Could I have one of your scales? For crafting purposes, of course.}}

*{{Text|say|Do you know [[Alexstrasza]]?}}
*{{Text|say|Why haven't we seen your people before?}}
*{{Text|say|I won't forget what [[Deathwing]] did to this city.}}
*{{Text|say|Are you hiding a stash of [[gold]]? I hear dragons do that.}}
*{{Text|say|Leave our city, spawn of Deathwing!}}
*{{Text|say|How do you walk through doorways with wings like that?}}
*{{Text|say|Are you sure you're a dragon? Or just a big [[lizard]]?}}
*{{Text|say|[https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Winterfell_(Game_of_Thrones) What do dragons eat, anyway?]}}

*{{Text|say|The belt's [[crocolisk]], I swear!}}
*{{Text|say|Oh! I love your scales!}}
*{{Text|say|[[Guard]]s! Why is this dragon roaming free?}}
*{{Text|say|Do you chase your own tail? My [[dog]] does that all the time.}}

;Dracthyr in the streets
*{{Text|say|Dark Talon|Most of these people are... civilians?}}
