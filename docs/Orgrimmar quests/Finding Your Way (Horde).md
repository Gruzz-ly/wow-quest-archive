==Objectives==
Speak with [[Rohaka Tuskmaul]] at the stables.
*Ask a guard for directions to the Stable Master
*Speak with [[Cork Fizzlepop]]
*Ride with Cork Fizzlepop to the Stables
*Speak with Rohaka Tuskmaul at the stables.

==Description==
[[Orgrimmar]]'s a big city. Way too big to explore on foot. [[Warlord Breka Grimaxe|Warlord Grimaxe]] has arranged for you to receive a mount to help you get around.

She said to speak with Rohaka at the [[stables]]... but I can't seem to remember the way there.

Don't worry, <name>! All we need to do is ask a guard for directions. If you ever need help finding something, the city guards will show you where to go.

Let's ask a nearby guard for directions to the stable master. Then we can be on our way! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[XP]]
*[[Tawny Wind Rider]]

==Progress==
Welcome to the stables, <class>. I've been expecting you.

==Completion==
[[Warlord Grimaxe]] instructed me to give you a mount.

I've been looking for someone special to match with this one. I think they will be perfect for you.

;On accept
:''Cork mounts up on a [[chopper]].''
:{{text|say|Cork Fizzlepop|Bet ya that guard can point us to the stables.}}
A nearby [[Orgrimmar Grunt]] has been marked as the objective. Speak to them and select "{{gossip|quest=|Stable Master}}."
:{{text|say|Cork Fizzlepop|Well, what'd they say?}}

:''A sidecar appears on Cork's [[Chauffeured Mechano-Hog]].''
:{{text|say|Cork Fizzlepop|Yeesh, that's far.}}
:''You hop in and Cork begins driving.''

As you ride, Cork speaks. When passing the [[Auction House (Valley of Strength)|Auction House]]
:{{text|say|Cork Fizzlepop|Welcome to the big time, <name>. You're in Orgrimmar now. Anyone who's anyone does business here.}}
:{{text|say|Cork Fizzlepop|Yeah, it's hot and dusty, and the orcs ain't always hospitable... but it's got charm, huh?}}
''OR, if you're an orc:''
:{{text|say|Cork Fizzlepop|Yeah, it's hot and dusty, and the orcs ain't always hospitable--present company excluded--but it's got charm, huh?}}

On the [[Drag]]:
:{{text|say|Cork Fizzlepop|See, the thing about Orgrimmar is that it's a place we can call our own. And that means a lot to people.}}
:{{text|say|Cork Fizzlepop|If the goons in the [[Alliance]] had their way, we wouldn't even have that much.}}

In the [[Valley of Honor]]:
:{{text|say|Cork Fizzlepop|We're almost there!}}

At the stables, Cork dismounts his chopper and you regain control.

If you stray too far away from Cork, he'll stop and call to you:
:{{text|say|Cork Fizzlepop|Time is money, <name>. Let's go!}}

If you lose track of Cork and can't find him, try returning to where you picked up the quest. He may have despawned and restarted his route. He rides a [[Chauffeured Mechano-Hog]].
