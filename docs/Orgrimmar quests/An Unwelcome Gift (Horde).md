==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Crown Chemical Co.]] members around [[Orgrimmar]].
* Crown Chemical Co. members slain (8)
*[[O.D.I.E.'s Remote Control]] (provided)

==Description==
I have a sinking suspicion there are spies from the Crown Chemical Co. among us. But I know that you know that O.D.I.E. here knows how to latch onto their scent!

But let's not bother anybody just here to have a good time, all right? Keep your nose peeled for chemicals, and make sure we're hitting the right targets.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Love Token]]

==Progress==
Follow your nose, pal! Anyone who stinks could be a suspect.

==Completion==
Yeesh, <name>, you reek!

<Snagglebolt sniffs his own collar.>

Even worse! I reek!

Well at least we've given some peace to the gala. I'd hate to have the Crown ruining the celebrations.

==Notes==
Use [[O.D.I.E.'s Remote Control]] to have O.D.I.E. run off to find someone suspicious, like a [[Lovely Reveler]]:
