==Objectives==
Deliver the letter to [[Thrall]], [[Warchief]] of the [[Horde]] at [[Orgrimmar]]. 
* [[To Thrall, Warchief of the Horde]] (provided)

==Description==
You are now, and forever will be, a [[Knights of the Ebon Blade|Knight of the Ebon Blade]], <name>, but know this: you were once a hero of the Horde.

<[[Darion Mograine|Darion]] stares at you.>

This order must establish allies for itself if it is to survive. You must represent the Knights of the Ebon Blade to the Horde.

On the platform, southeast of me, is a portal to Orgrimmar. Take this letter, given to me on your behalf by [[Tirion Fordring|Lord Fordring]], and deliver it to Thrall. Use the portal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12,250 [[XP]]
*+6000 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
An interesting turn of events.

==Completion==
[[Eitrigg]] is alive because of this [[paladin]]. He would have been executed had Lord Fordring not broken him out of [[Stratholme]].

Tirion Fordring, to have sacrificed everything to save the life of an [[orc]]... I have ever only known one other [[human]] to make such a sacrifice.

<Thrall blinks back a tear.>

You will be in my heart always, [[Taretha Foxton|Taretha]].

Yes. For Tirion Fordring and for Eitrigg! We will accept you as a member of the Horde and your order as allies.

Blood and honor! For the Horde!
