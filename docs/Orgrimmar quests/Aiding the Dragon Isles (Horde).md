==Objectives==
Meet [[Naleidea Rivergleam]] to begin your adventure in the [[Dragon Isles]].

Remember your training and you'll go far. I'm sure we'll meet again within this place.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 510 [[XP]]

==Completion==
How are you? We could use more hands to help us explore the Dragon Isles!
