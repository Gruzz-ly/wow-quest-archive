==Objectives==
Take a hit from [[Varok Saurfang]], then report to Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner in Orgrimmar.
*Take the hit
*Report back to Lady [[Sylvanas Windrunner]] in [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
I have two things to ask of you, and I do not ask them lightly.

First, I need you to retain the favor of the warchief. She will undoubtedly have questions, and seeds of distrust may begin to grow, but she cannot lose you as an ally. Not now. She would not so willingly part with one of her greatest champions.

In order to do so, it will have to look like you faced me in combat, and lost. I trust you can take a hit.

Second, I ask you not to follow me further. I must make this journey alone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I have not heard back from [[Dark Ranger Lyana|Lyana]] since I sent her on her last mission.

Are you here to complete her report?

:{{Text|say|Varok Saurfang|If you are to remain in the Banshee's favor, she needs to believe that I defeated you. But it has to look like you put up a good fight.}}

:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Let me see if I have this right... Saurfang single-handedly slew my [[Deathguard Elite (Swamp of Sorrows)|elite forces]] and a veteran dark ranger?}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|How fortunate that you escaped with little more than a bruise. Fortunate... but disappointing.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Let me be perfectly clear. You will find the traitor Saurfang. You will deliver him to me. And you will not fail me again.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Now go. Remember your duty to the Horde. We have a [[Fourth War|war]] to win.}}
