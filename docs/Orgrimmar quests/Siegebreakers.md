==Objectives==
Covertly place Suspicious Crates and slay guards.
* Bombs set (8)
* [[Put on disguise]] (provided)

==Description==
The fools who follow [[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]] have grown bold enough to launch a direct assault. We cannot allow these pests to swarm before our gates.

Our operatives are collapsing the pass between [[Razor Hill]] and [[Orgrimmar]] as we speak. Saurfang's treasonous forces will be cut in half.

Your task is to sneak into their ranks and sabotage their [[siege engine]]s. Wear this disguise, but know that it will not hold up under close examination. Slay anyone who discovers you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
I weep for them. The fools.

<Nathanos smirks.>

==Notes==
Head to the [[Dranosh'ar Blockade]] and begin to plant 8 [[Explosive Crate|Explosive Crates]] while wearing a disguise. 

If an [[Alliance Guard (Durotar)|Alliance Guard]] see you:
*{{Text|Say|You're not supposed to be there!}}
*{{Text|Say|What are you up to over there?}}

Slay the guards if they attack you.

Head to the [[Gates of Orgrimmar]] and turn in three quests to [[Nathanos Blightcaller]].
