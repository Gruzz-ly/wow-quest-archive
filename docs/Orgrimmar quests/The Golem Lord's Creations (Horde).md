==Objectives==
Obtain 5 Elemental Modules from the [[golem]]s in the [[Manufactory]] of [[Blackrock Depths]] and recover the Elemental Golem Blueprints.
*[[Elemental Module]] (5)
*[[Elemental Golem Blueprints]]

==Description==
The [[Shattered Hand]] has discovered some disturbing information in Blackrock Depths. It appears [[Twilight's Hammer]] is working with the [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron]] [[engineer]], [[Golem Lord Argelmach|Argelmach]], to create [[war golem]]s powered by [[elemental]]s. These golems could be a great advantage for our enemies.

It is your duty to prevent that from happening. Find the Manufactory in Blackrock Depths, capture the blueprints he's using to make those golems, and recover the elemental modules he's using to power them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|10|70|}}
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*[[Helm of the Great Hunter]]

==Progress==
We cannot afford to allow those golems to be used against us.

==Completion==
Can you imagine what would happen if they got these models working and into the field? You've done a great service for the [[Horde]], <name>.

==Progression==
#[[Meet with Tamanji]] (optional)
#[[The Golem Lord's Creations (Horde)]]
