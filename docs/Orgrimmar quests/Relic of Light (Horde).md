==Objectives==
Travel to [[Hearthglen]] in {{C|Western Plaguelands}} and search for information on the artifact described in the journal.

==Description==
This weapon of [[light]] described in the journal troubles me. If the [[Scarlet Crusade]] or the [[Alliance]] were to obtain such a thing, it could be a serious threat to the [[Forsaken]].

Most of the surviving records from [[Andorhal]] are under the Scarlet Crusade's protection in Hearthglen. Search through them and see if you can find more information.

==Completion==
This ledger appears to hold records of Scarlet activity in the [[Plaguelands]].

==Progression==
{{The Prize Within}}
