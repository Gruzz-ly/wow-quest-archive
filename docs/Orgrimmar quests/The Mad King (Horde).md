==Objectives==
Bring Thermaplugg's Engineering Notes to [[Nogg]] at the [[Valley of Honor]] in [[Orgrimmar]].
*[[Thermaplugg's Engineering Notes]] (provided)

==Description==
You find a dirty, tattered notebook full of scribbled schematics and notes. It's quite clear even after just a cursory glance that any of these creations could be used to wreak terrible havoc should anyone ever be foolish enough to build them.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Pendant of Homecoming
|Piston Pendant
|Gnomeregan Peace Officer's Torque
|Justice Badge}}

You will receive:
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan Exiles]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Whatcha got for me?

==Completion==
<Nogg's eyes light up as he reads through the collection of notes and schematics>

I am going to blow so many things up with this stuff.

Good job, <name>. I think this calls for a celebration!
