==Objectives==
Go to [[Shadowfang Keep]] and obtain the Commander's Holy Symbol from [[Commander Springvale]], 5 bundles of Moontouched Wood, and 5 Ghostly Essence.
*[[Commander's Holy Symbol]]
*[[Moontouched Wood]] (5)
*[[Ghostly Essence]] (5)

==Description==
I hear that word of your deeds in service to the [[Horde]] has even reached the ears of the [[warchief]]. He has agreed to allow [[Orgrimmar]]'s master [[enchanter]] to create a staff for you.

The cursed Shadowfang Keep in [[Silverpine Forest]] is the only place to get the materials you'll need. Travel there and find the lost holy symbol of Commander Springvale, a supply of moontouched wood, and the essence of the [[ghost]]s that haunt the keep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2,300 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*[[Staff of Golden Worship]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the materials I'll need for your weapon?

==Completion==
You must be the priest that Brother Silverhallow mentioned. Welcome, <name>. Let me see those materials you gathered from halfway around the world. They seem well worth the travel and you will not be disappointed with your staff.

==Pre-''Shadowlands'' version==

I hear that word of your deeds in service to the [[Horde]] has even reached the ears of the [[warchief]]. I think he might see the error of his earlier judgment about us.

He has agreed to allow [[Orgrimmar]]'s master [[enchanter]] to create a staff for you.

The cursed Shadowfang Keep in [[Silverpine Forest]] is the only place to get the materials you'll need. Travel there and find the lost holy symbol of Commander Springvale, a supply of moontouched wood, and the essence of the [[ghost]]s that haunt the keep.
