==Objectives==
Deal with this traitor.
* Speak with [[Eitrigg]]
* Defeat Eitrigg
* Restrain Eitrigg
* Drag the traitor before [[Nathanos Blightcaller|Nathanos]]

==Description==
There is a difference between loyalty and blind obedience. I am done following the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Banshee]]'s orders!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The [[warchief]] has long suspected that this traitor lacks the necessary resolve.

You, on the other hand... You understand.

==Notes==
Speak with Eitrigg:

:Walk away, <name>.

:{{gossip|I will not allow you to betray the [[Horde]]. For the Dark Lady!}}

After defeating Eitrigg:

:She... will doom us all...

:{{gossip|On your feet! Or do I have to drag you?}}

Drag Eitrigg to [[Grommash Hold]] where Nathanos Blightcaller and [[Lenara|Dark Ranger Lenara]] are waiting.
