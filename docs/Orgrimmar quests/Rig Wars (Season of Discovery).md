==Objectives==
Retrieve the Rig Blueprints and Thermaplugg's Safe Combination from [[Gnomeregan (Season of Discovery)|Gnomeregan]] and bring them to [[Nogg]] in [[Orgrimmar]].
* [[Rig Blueprints]]
* [[Thermaplugg's Safe Combination]]

==Description==
[[Gnome technology]] - two years ago its most common use was as a punch line. Times certainly have changed. Now they've got a new rig built that's better than all our [[shredder]] models combined. I need the blueprints, <name>!

Unfortunately, the plans are locked away in a safe near [[Mekgineer Thermaplugg]]. To make matters worse, the combination to the safe is only known by Mekgineer Thermaplugg.

Do whatever you have to do to get that combination, <name>. Then crack open that safe and bring back those blueprints!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Pristine Civinad Robes
|Nimble Triprunner Dungarees
|Triple Reinforced Leggings}}

You will receive:
*3150 [[XP]]
*{{cost||50}}
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
I don't see any blueprints. Did you hide them somewhere on your body or are you just standing around here to irritate me?

==Completion==
I knew you could do it, <name>! Sovik on the other hand, he had his doubts.

Now that we have the blueprints in our possession, it is only a matter of time before we figure out all of the gnomish innovations that went into the creation of the rig and make them goblin innovations for our new shredder models.
