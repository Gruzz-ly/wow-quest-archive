==Objectives==
Go through the Portal to the [[Maelstrom]] and speak to {{NPC||Thrall}}.

==Description==
Thank the spirits you're here, <name>.

We're not sure how much longer we can maintain the rift in the Maelstrom.

Our most powerful members, led by Thrall, are barely preventing the tear.

Last I heard, our only hope was to go through the breach and attempt to stabilize it from the other side.

I will conjure a portal. Take it and report to Thrall as soon as you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||82}}

==Completion==
<Thrall's muscles strain as primal energy flows through him. His eyes shift your way, acknowledging your arrival.>

It is good to see you, <name>.

==Notes==
The quest-givers can be found in the ''[[World of Warcraft: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]'' portal areas set up by the [[Earthen Ring]], either northwest of {{Alliance}} [[Stormwind Keep]] or northeast of the {{Horde}} [[Valley of Wisdom]].

This quest may not be available on [[modern]] realms without starting a [[Timewalking Campaign]] (aka Chromie Time). It may be skipped, as Deepholm can be accessed directly through the portal, and the following quests do not require this introductory sequence.

==Progression==
This quest starts the [[Deepholm]] storyline.

{{Deepholm, Realm of Earth}}
