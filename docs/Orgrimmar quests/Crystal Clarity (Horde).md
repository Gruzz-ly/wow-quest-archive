==Objectives==
Collect 1 Pristine Crystal Shard from the [[Crystal Spine Matriarch]] on [[Yojamba Isle]] in [[Stranglethorn Vale]].
* [[Pristine Crystal Shard]]

==Description==
You know, there is a way we can improve your S.E.L.F.I.E. cam, if you're interested. With the right focusing lens, I could add all kinds of features to that thing.

I've heard that way out on old Yojamba Isle in Stranglethorn Vale, the mother of all basilisks has been seen. Her hide is dotted with gems that'd make the perfect lens, if I could get my hands on them.

She's not going to go down easy, though. You might want to bring some friends along.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|77|60}}
*10,640 [[XP]]
*[[S.E.L.F.I.E. Lens Upgrade Kit]]

==Progress==
That crystal spine matriarch has the gems we need to upgrade your lens, any luck with that?

==Completion==
Count me surprised to hear from you again, you must be tougher than I thought. You've earned my respect, kid, here's your lens upgrade kit. Now get out there and take some S.E.L.F.I.E.S!

==Notes==
This quest reuses the ID of the unused [[Disarming Axe Throwers]].
