==Objectives==
Retrieve 6 [[Barrel of Darkspear Rice|Barrels of Darkspear Rice]]. Deliver the rice to Marogg in Orgrimmar.
* [[Barrel of Darkspear Rice]] (6)

==Description==
As you know <name>, [[Garrosh]] has relegated the [[Darkspear Trolls|Trolls]] of Orgrimmar to the western outskirts of the city. Fortunately, that means that we have easy access to their supplies. I am working on a large batch of jambalaya for the infantry and I need as much rice as possible. Lucky for us, the Trolls keep it stored in barrels near their structures. Retrieve these barrels of Darkspear rice for me and I should be able to finish up.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{Cost|7|40}}, [[Epicurean's Award]], +1 [[Cooking]] Skill

==Progress==
Were you able to acquire the rice? 

==Completion==
I see you are a skilled thief as well, <name>.  Don't worry, we will return the rice once we are done... or not. 

==Achievements==
This quest is one of the quests required to achieve [[Let's Do Lunch: Orgrimmar]].
