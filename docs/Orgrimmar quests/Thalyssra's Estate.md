==Objectives==
Meet with [[Lady Liadrin]] at the [[Estate of the First Arcanist]] in [[Suramar]].

==Description==
Would you like to hear how the [[nightborne]] came to join the [[Horde]]?

We earned their trust when we aided them in liberating Suramar from the tyranny of Grand Magistrix [[Elisande]] and the [[Burning Legion]].

[[Lor'themar Theron]] later asked them to join him in [[Quel'Thalas]]. Lady Liadrin made the journey to extend the invitation to First Arcanist [[Thalyssra]]...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The [[Suramar City|city of Suramar]] is beautiful to behold. I hope [[Silvermoon City]] is not a disappointment to them.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|The regent lord invited the nightborne to Silvermoon. I am to travel to Suramar and escort Lady Thalyssra to the meeting.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|I am counting on you both. Do not return until Suramar's strength is pledged to the Horde.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|As you command, Warchief. I will meet you at Lady Thalyssra's estate in Suramar, <name>.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Greetings, Lady Liadrin, <name>. Welcome back to Suramar. I am pleased to receive you under more pleasant circumstances.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|It is good to see your city free, First Arcanist.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|For that, we owe you both a great debt. You proved instrumental to our cause.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|The Horde was proud to fight by your side against the Burning Legion, my lady.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|I must admit, when I first learned of the Horde, I was skeptical that we would share common ground.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|I though [[Night elf|our kin]] from [[Kalimdor]] would make obvious allies. But their arrogance and mistrust soon proved otherwise.}}
: ''Thalyssra turns and summons a vision of herself and [[Tyrande Whisperwind]], from the Alliance side of [[Take Me To Your Leader (Alliance)]].''
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Arcanist Thalyssra. I remember where your order stood in the [[War of the Ancients]]. How do we know you won't betray us and become the next [[Elisande]]... the next [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]]?}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|We do not intend to be slaves to the [[Nightwell]]. We seek to drive the Legion from Suramar and put an end to Elisande's oppression.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|The kaldorei will fight to see the Legion defeated and the Nightwell destroyed. Beyond that... we shall see where [[Elune]]'s wisdom guides us.}}
: ''Thalyssra ends the vision and turns back to Liadrin.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|It would seem "Elune's wisdom" guided her away from the bond we once shared. So be it.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|The sin'dorei are also scorned by Tyrande and her prideful lot. Yet for many ages her people slept in dens or hid in trees while my people fought to save this world.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|The Alliance feels too walled off... too cloistered. My people will never endure such stagnation again.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|That is why I am grateful for your invitation to Silvermoon. I would like to inquire whether there could be a place for the nightborne in your Horde.}}

==Progression==

;Description
[[Lor'themar Theron|Regent Lord Theron]] invited the [[nightborne]] to join him in [[Silvermoon City]].

First, we must inform them of the invitation. I prefer to do such things in person.

Please, come with me to Suramar and meet with Lady [[Thalyssra]].
