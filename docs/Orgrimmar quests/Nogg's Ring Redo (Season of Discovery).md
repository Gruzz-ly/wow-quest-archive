==Objectives==
Bring the Brilliant Gold Ring, a Silver Bar, a Moss Agate, and 30 silver coins to [[Nogg]] in [[Orgrimmar]].
*[[Silver Bar]]
*[[Moss Agate]]
*Required money: {{cost||30}}
*[[Brilliant Gold Ring]] (provided)

==Description==
No, no, no - I'm not all of the sudden saying that the ring is mine. I normally don't do this, but your information about the [[Dark iron dwarf|Dark Irons]] was very useful. I'll improve your ring for you, better than whomever made this simple little thing could have ever done. Probably some [[gnome]]...

If you bring me a bar of silver, a moss agate, and thirty silver coins for my trouble, I'll add a silver and agate lattice to the ring that will strengthen the magic inside of it. Interested?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Nogg's Brilliant Gold Ring}}

You will also receive:
*3150 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Do you have the materials I need?  I can't improve on this design without everything I asked for.

==Completion==
Here's your ring, better than before.  Thanks again for the information about those Dark Iron dwarves.  This seems like a reasonable lead as to how those gnomes suddenly were struck with goblin-like inspiration.
