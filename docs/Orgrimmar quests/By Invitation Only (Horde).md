'''By Invitation Only?''' starts the {{g|tww}} season of the [[Brawler's Guild]]. Begin by speaking with the [[Garrulous Gladiator]] outside [[Mythic Aspirations]] in central [[Dornogal]] to begin.

==Objectives==
Talk to [[Alton Philips]] near the [[Brawl'gar Arena]].

==Description==
Fancy yourself a Brawl'gar contender do you, <class>? They don't let just anyone in there, you know. Certainly not without an invitation.

That said... just between you and me, if you know where to look and you've the means they say anyone can have their moment in the spotlight these days.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||86|50}}

==Completion==

Very hard to come by those, or expensive, or both!

But maybe we can work out a deal.
