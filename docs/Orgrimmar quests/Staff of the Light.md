==Objectives==
Go to [[Shadowfang Keep]] and obtain the Commander's Holy Symbol from [[Commander Springvale]], 5 bundles of Moontouched Wood, and 5 Ghostly Essence.
*[[Commander's Holy Symbol]]
*[[Moontouched Wood]] (5)
*[[Ghostly Essence]] (5)

==Description==
You are quickly becoming a talented servant of the [[Light]] and of [[Silvermoon]], <name>. Your loyalty to our people and to the [[Horde]] are exemplary.

In recognition of your dedication, the [[warchief]] has commissioned his master [[enchanter]] to create a staff for you.

The cursed Shadowfang Keep in [[Silverpine Forest]] is the only place to get the materials you'll need. Travel there and find the lost holy symbol of Commander Springvale, a supply of moontouched wood, and the essence of the [[ghost]]s that haunt the keep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2,300 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*[[Staff of the Sunchaser]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the materials I'll need for your weapon?

==Completion==
[[Tyelis]] mentioned that you were visiting Shadowfang Keep to find the materials for your new staff. Few would venture into the keep, even to retrieve such valuable things. Your new staff will be a fitting reward for your bravery.

==Progression==
