==Objectives==
Bring the Dagger to [[Warchief]] [[Sylvanas Windrunner]].
*[[Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire (quest item)]]

==Description==
<The blade that was known as [[Xal'atath]] rests on the ground before you. Though the consciousness that resided within the dagger is gone, it still resonates with power.

Almost as if the weapon speaks with another voice. Another purpose....

You feel a compulsion to bring this artifact to the warchief.>

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|Radiant Azerite Fragment
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<As you present the dagger to Sylvanas, a faint smile curls her lips. For the briefest moment, it seems her eyes darken. A trick of the light, no doubt.>

Once again, you have proven yourself a worthy champion, <name>. This blade is the compass that will guide us to victory.

==Notes==
Before leaving after having killed [[Uu'nat]], pick up this quest and travel to [[Orgrimmar]] to turn it in.
