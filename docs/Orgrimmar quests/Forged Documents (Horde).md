*{{text|say|Ambassador Dawnsinger|I can't believe you sell those here, of all places. I'll swing by the cook later to pick them up.}}
*{{text|say|Ambassador Dawnsinger|They had what on them? Tell the tailor my ceremonial robes had better be perfect with everything she's charging me.}}
*{{text|say|Branzlit|An account of all the fractions of copper we round off...brilliant.}}
*{{text|say|Branzlit|I couldn't have miscalculated your interest...because we don't give any! I'd rather pay than be subject to the trails, so take my personal cash.}}
*{{text|say|Grunt Grimful|I know I worked a hundred and sixty eight hours last week...but if the paperwork says I didn't clock in, maybe you're right.}}
*{{text|say|Grunt Grimful|I really need to stop gambling. Tell them no more cards for me.}}
*{{text|say|Scout Stronghand|So you caught a thief. Enjoy your finder's fee!}}
