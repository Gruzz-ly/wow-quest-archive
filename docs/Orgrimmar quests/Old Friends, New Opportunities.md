Well if it isn't <name>! You're just the goblin we've been lookin' for!

It's been a long time since [[Kezan]], hasn't it? We had some good times cruising around together back in the day!

Now, I don't want to get all sentimental on you but Sassy Hardwrench sent me to find you! She's putting the gang back together for a big job! BIG!

Look, I wish I had more time to catch up but we've gotta split. Time is money, you know?

If you want in on the job, find Sassy. She'll fill you in on the details!
