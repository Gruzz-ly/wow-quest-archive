==Objectives==
Speak to [[Durak (demon)|Durak]] in [[Splintertree Mines]].
*Durak Persuaded
*Durak slain

==Description==
I sense that Durak is more than he seems. [[Demon]]ic power is dangerous and it is easy to fall to its corruption - even for a trained [[warlock]].

I do not trust him, <name>.

Find this Durak and tell him that the [[Horde]] will have nothing to do with him.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Durak's Downfall
|Ring of Pardons
|Bow of Ire
}}

You will also receive:
*2,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Carry on.
 
==Completion==
As I thought, he was a threat after all. Well done, <name>.

==Notes==
After accepting the quest, return to Durak at Splintertree. He is still friendly, but now has a [[Felhunter Minion]] with him. Speak with Durak:
:{{gossip|This is terrible, Durak! Saurfang will have nothing to do with you! What can we do?!}}
::{{text|say|Durak|Saurfang's involved, you say?}}
::{{text|say|Durak|Well then there is only one thing left to be done...}}
::{{text|say|Durak|This is all happening sooner than I would have liked.}}
::{{text|say|Durak|I am afraid that you, <name>, have outgrown your usefulness...}}

Kill him.

In original version of the quest, looting [[Durak's Head]] was an objective.

;Garrosh
*Description:
The demons want nothing more than for us to renew our dependence on their foul magics. That reliance can only lead to the entire orc race becoming enslaved.

You wish to see Draaka go unpunished? Then you must find the demons' pawn who has manipulated her, and destroy him!

If you do not soon return to me with the head of this being, then I shall see both yours and Draaka's hoisted upon a spike!

*Rewards
*[[Garrosh's Pardon]]
*[[Unbountied Cloak]]

*Progress:
Have you brought me the head of the enemy, <race>?

*Completion:
Grah... very well.

I'll remove the bounty I had placed upon your head. Though I am sorely tempted to end your life anyway, just on principle.

Be sure that you never raise my ire again, <name>. Now, get out of my sight...
