==Objectives==
Find a way to open the box and claim the artifact, then deliver it to [[Dietrich Praice]] in [[Orgrimmar]].
*[[Shard of Light]]
*[[Artifact Storage Key (priest)]]
*[[Puzzle Box]] (provided)

==Description==
Power radiates from inside the box. This must be the artifact! Now you just need to get it open...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Jubilant Epiphany]]

==Progress==
What have you found, <name>?

==Completion==
So the story was true... I will hold on to this and investigate its potential. Not only our are enemies deprived of this weapon, but in our own hands it could prove a powerful defense against the [[Scourge]].

Take this, <name>, with my thanks.
