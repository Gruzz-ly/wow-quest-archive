This daily quest requires 475 [[Jewelcrafting]]

==Objectives==
Test Stardust No. 2 on 10 "humanoid subjects".
*Stardust No. 2 Tested (10)
*[[Stardust No. 2]] (provided)

==Description==
Dr. [[Vernstrom]] has been working on this new stardust - what with the fashion in Orgrimmar this season being about all things sparkly, I'm sure if we can get it to the market it will be all the rage! The [[Jewelcrafter's Association]], however, won't let us market it until we've completed some "live testing" - something about tinkering with magical dust being dangerous or some such nonsense. Well, I suppose we need to humor them. Take this bag and test out Stardust No. 2 on humanoid subjects. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|16|54|ijt=1}}

==Progress==
How did the tests go?

==Completion==
It did what!?  We're ruined!  Hmm.  Well, actually...  Maybe the doctor can find some other applications for it? 

==Notes==
You can use [[Stardust No. 2]] on any [[NPC]] or player in [[Orgrimmar]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
