==Objectives==
Speak to [[General Nazgrim]] on ''[[Hellscream's Fist]]''.

== Description ==
<Nazgrim fills his lungs with sea air.>

You smell that, <name>? It's the smell of our home, the lands our kind have bled and died to preserve.

And listen... you hear that? It's the sound of peace and safety - a haven we've carved, where our enemies fear to tread.

Remember these things. You won't experience them again anytime soon. We have ourselves a war to win.

Now to get settled, we're shovin' off!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||98}}

== Completion ==
<Name>!?

They told me you were dead...

I'm glad to see it wasn't true. There's Alliance to kill!

== Notes ==
Talk to Nazgrim again to begin:

:Prepare yourself, <name>.

:We'll be entering a target-rich environment!

:{{gossip|I'm ready to go, General.}}

''The game cuts to a cinematic scene, where ''Hellscream's Fist'' is apparently lost in the mists. The camera zooms to the deck, where [[Gorrok]] approaches General Nazgrim.''
:{{text|say|Gorrok|We've been flying in this mist for hours, General. The crew grows... uneasy.}}
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|Back to your post, soldier! We'll find this land, or die trying.}}
:{{text|say|Rivett Clutchpop|Land ho!}}
:''The camera pans to an Alliance ship sailing around the coast.''
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|Alliance ship! Portside!}}
:{{text|say|General Nazgrim|Attack!}}
''Both ''Hellscream's Fist'' and the Alliance ship open fire on one another. After both of the vessels have been hit, the [[gunship]] and the [[battleship]] are seen on fire.  ''Hellscream's Fist'' has taken a direct hit to its engine, with the player laying on the deck nearby, unconscious.''
''After cutting to black, the player wakes up on the gunship, which is under attack by Alliance ground troops!''
