==Objectives==
Speak to [[Elthyn Da'rai]] at the Illidari camp atop the plateau in Orgrimmar.

==Description==
The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] is bold indeed to strike at the Horde's stronghold! You aided our defense, but now I have a more important task for you.

It seems the [[demon hunter]]s will play a crucial part in this war... but I still don't trust them. You will be my envoy to the [[Illidari]]. Learn what they know. Study their techniques. If they betray us, we'll use their own knowledge against them.

Their camp lies atop the plateau in the city. Go. [[Nathanos Blightcaller|Nathanos]] and I will clean up this mess.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*360 [[XP]]
*{{cost||5}}

==Completion==
Ah, so you're the vaunted <class> I've heard about. Good.

We shall see if your reputation holds true.
