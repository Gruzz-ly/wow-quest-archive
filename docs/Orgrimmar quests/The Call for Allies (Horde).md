Ah, <name>. Now we can begin.

[[File:Orgrimmar Embassy 8.0.jpg|thumb|The embassy's interior in [[Patch 8.0.1]]]]

Upon entering the [[Orgrimmar Embassy]], [[Sylvanas Windrunner]], [[Eitrigg]], [[Baine Bloodhoof]] and [[Lady Liadrin]] can be seen discussing together. [[Rokhan]], [[Nathanos Blightcaller]], [[Jastor Gallywix]] and [[Ji Firepaw]] are also there but silent.

:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Leaders of the Horde, I summoned you here--along with one of our greatest [[Adventurer|champion]]s--because our enemies are gathering their strength.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|The Alliance is scouring the far corners of [[Azeroth]] in search of every advantage against us. We must do the same.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|War is coming. We need fresh blood added to the ranks of the Horde. What say you?}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Warchief, years ago, the Horde pursued the fugitive [[Garrosh Hellscream]] to an echo of the {{Au|Draenor}} I once knew.}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|In saving Draenor from Garrosh and the Burning Legion, this champion earned the trust of the [[orc]]s there. They owe the Horde a debt. I propose we collect what is owed to us.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|An army of militant orcs from another world? Trained soldiers... weapons waiting to be fixed upon the Alliance. Interesting...}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Warchief, the [[Highmountain tauren|tauren of Highmountain]] fought boldly alongside us in our campaign against the Burning Legion, just as our ancestors did long ago.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|I have invited their leaders to a great feast in [[Mulgore]]. This could be our chance to bring them to our side.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|A simple people, but strong. They would be a boon on the battlefield.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Liadrin|I too have a suggestion, Warchief. The [[Blood elf|sin'dorei]] have maintained diplomatic ties with the [[nightborne]] since we helped liberate [[Suramar]] from the Legion.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Liadrin|The regent lord and I agree that our kingdoms have much in common. We believe the nightborne would make valuable allies.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Even without the [[Nightwell]], Suramar holds vast arcane resources. A most useful arrow added to my quiver.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Each option would have its uses. I believe <name> knows these peoples. Which potential ally do you suggest we pursue first?}}

Meet Warchief [[Sylvanas Windrunner]] at the [[Orgrimmar Embassy]].

;Description
The [[Horde]]'s selfless leadership in the war against the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] has left our ranks depleted. Our enemies slaver at the thought of stealing what is ours. We will not let them.

I've authorized the building of an embassy in Orgrimmar. From it, we will win others to our cause. Meet me there at once.

;Completion
Ah, <name>. Now we can begin.
