The '''Joining the Horde''' quest is the first quest [[Pandaren (playable)|pandaren]] players receive upon arriving at [[Orgrimmar]], after choosing to join the [[Horde]] at the end of the [[Wandering Isle storyline]], in which the player, accompanied by [[Ji Firepaw]], has to speak to Warchief [[Garrosh Hellscream]] in [[Grommash Hold]]. The equivalent for players that have chosen to join the [[Alliance]] is [[Joining the Alliance]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Garrosh Hellscream]] in [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
Here we are, <name>... Orgrimmar, heart of the Horde.

We can be helpful beyond the edges of the [[Wandering Isle]]. There are innumerable problems out there, just waiting for us to solve them. This is what [[Master Shang Xi]] would have wanted.

There's no better place to start doing that than here, with the aid of the Horde. Let's find out who their leader is. We need allies.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||35}}

==Completion==
Pandaren... you're here.

Good.

==Notes==
After choosing the Horde and watching the cutscene, players appear just outside the [[Orgrimmar]] gates in [[Durotar]], beside [[Ji Firepaw]]. Speak with Ji to begin.

As you escort Ji through Orgrimmar, various NPCs greet you as you make your way towards [[Grommash Hold]]:

:{{text|say|[[Orgrimmar Grunt]]|Never thought I'd see one of your kind walk through here.}}
:{{text|say|Orgrimmar Grunt|Come on through. The Warchief's expecting you.}}

Passing by the place where [[Nefarian]]'s head is usually mounted:

:{{text|yell|[[Shang'gok]]|Look! It's Ji Firepaw, and <name>!}}
:{{text|say|Shang'gok|They're the ones who helped [[Korga Strongmane]] escape from the Alliance!}}

Approaching the entrance to Grommash Hold, Ji runs up to the [[Warchief's Command]] board:

:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|Look at this!}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|Well, that's good news. Once we join the Horde, we certainly won't run out of things to do.}}

Finally, Ji and the player enter the throne room. Even after his removal from the throne, a copy of Garrosh spawns and spots them almost immediately:

:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Pandaren! Approach.}}
:''Ji kneels before Garrosh.''
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|Emperor Hellscream, I am Ji...}}
:{{text|yell|Garrosh Hellscream|That's WARCHIEF Hellscream!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Now, rise.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|We should talk, pandaren.}}

==Progression==
{{Speak With Garrosh}}
