==Objectives==
Meet [[Grand Magister Rommath]] in the [[Twilight Highlands]].
*Take Umbric's portal to the Twilight Highlands

==Description==
I've spoken with [[Grand Magister Rommath]]. Despite our differences, it seems we are aligned in purpose.

We have both found evidence that [[Twilight's Blade]] cultists are convening in the [[Twilight Highlands]]. It's a place long scarred by the [[Twilight's Hammer|cult]]'s misdeeds. And it's a suitable staging ground for an attack.

Meet us there so we may continue our investigation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|3|9}}
* 180 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well. It seems we are to be working together to investigate the [[Twilight's Blade]].

I do hope you're prepared.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Magister Umbric|Now that we have confirmed the rumors, we must stop the [[Twilight's Blade]] at its source: The [[Twilight Highlands]].}}
:{{Text|say|Magister Umbric|This portal will take you to our base of operations. I'll meet you there.}}

Umbric opens the [[Portal to the Twilight Highlands]] and enters it.

Take it. On the other side:
:{{Text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|Yet more minds twisted by the [[Void]]. This must seem quite familiar to you, Umbric.}}

After completion, both mages have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Grand Magister Rommath|No agent of the [[void]] will escape our watch. I hold everyone in suspicion.

{{Gossip|How do you feel about working with [[Magister Umbric]]?}}
{{Dialogue-child|This is a temporary alliance. If it were up to me, the [[Magisters]] would resolve this threat ourselves.

[[Magister Umbric|Umbric]] is prone to bending the proper order of things to meet his whims. Someone like that has no business calling himself a Magister.

{{gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
}}
}}
{{dialogue|title=Magister Umbric|The [[Twilight's Blade]] are a collection of fools. Fools who have been conscripted by [[Xal'atath]].

{{Gossip|How do you feel about working with [[Grand Magister Rommath]]?}}
{{Dialogue-child|[[Xal'atath]] is not a threat I treat lightly. Whatever shortsighted barbs [[Grand Magister Rommath|Rommath]] throws my way, I will work with him as long as he is useful.

There is more at stake than my pride. Not that it's in much danger.
