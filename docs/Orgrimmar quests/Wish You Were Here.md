==Objectives==
Investigate [[Fallen Sky Lake]] in [[Ashenvale]] and report your findings to [[Gan'rul Bloodeye]] in [[Orgrimmar]].
*[[Withered Scarf]]

==Description==
I met [[Krilge]] while making [[:Mooncloth]] in Ashenvale. He was stationed there to protect civilians from danger, until he disappeared...

They've stopped looking for him and consider him a [[deserter]], but I don't believe it.

We would often meet at Fallen Sky Lake before it became overrun by those aggressive [[bog beast]]s.

I'm not typically one to ask favors, but if you could go to Ashenvale and look for any sign of him, I'd appreciate it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,550 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes, what is it?

==Completion==
What is it you have there, <name>? A scarf made of... Mooncloth? You best not be seeking to romance me.

==Progression==
#[[Love Hurts]]
#[[Wish You Were Here]]
#[[The Binding (Incubus, Orgrimmar)]]
