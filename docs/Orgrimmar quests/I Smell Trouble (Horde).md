==Objectives==
Use O.D.I.E.'s Remote Control to find clues around [[Orgrimmar]].
* Use O.D.I.E.'s Remote Control near the [[Valley of Strength]] (Optional)
* [[Map of Shadowfang Keep Security|First clue found]]
* [[Formula: Intoxicating Toxic Perfume|Second clue]]
* [[Memo from Apothecary Hummel|Third clue]]
* [[O.D.I.E.'s Remote Control]] (provided)

==Description==
You smell that funny odor too? Smells like smoke, cheap cologne, and alchemical nonsense. You ask me, I think the Crown Chemical Co. is up to something. Want to help me get to the bottom of it?

Well, take a look at my pal here. Sure, he looks like a pooch, but this is O.D.I.E.! The Olfactory Detection and Inspection Engine! With this little fella, you and I can sniff out whatever the Crown is plotting from a mile away!

Are you in? I could use a good partner to solve this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Love Token]]

==Progress==
Sure, O.D.I.E. can sniff out the clues, but you still gotta piece 'em together.

==Completion==
Poisonous perfumes? Revenge for kicking 'em out of the city?

Seems like Apothecary Hummel is cooking up something sinister. This could get ugly.

*{{Text|say|Detective Snap Snagglebolt|Follow that scent!}}
;Activating [[O.D.I.E.'s Remote Control]] with no nearby clue
*{{Text|say|Detective Snap Snagglebolt|Everything's on the up and up around here. Let's search somewhere else.}}
:{{Text|say|Detective Snap Snagglebolt|I'm thinking the Valley of Spirits might have what we need.}}
*{{Text|say|Detective Snap Snagglebolt|Nothing, not even a whiff. How about we try the Valley of Honor next?}}
