==Objectives==
Bring a [[Dungeon Set 1]] Belt and a set of [[Dungeon Set 1]] Gloves to [[Mokvar]] in [[Orgrimmar]]. 

==Description==
You've proven to be a very reliable individual, <name>. As much as I trust that you'll help me through this predicament, it would be wise of me to reward you according to your performance.

For now I will exchange your belt and gloves. If we both see this through I shall make the rest of the pieces available to you.

==Rewards==
You will receive (depending on class):
* Druid: [[Feline Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Astral Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Guardian's Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Mender's Gloves and Belt Set]]
* Hunter: [[Pursuer's Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Prowler's Gloves and Belt Set]]
* Mage: [[Sorcerer's Belt (Season of Discovery)]] and [[Sorcerer's Gauntlets]]
* Priest: [[Dawn Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Twilight Gloves and Belt Set]]
* Rogue: [[Thrill's Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Battle's Gloves and Belt Set]]
* Shaman: [[Relief's Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Eruption's Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Impact's Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Resolve's Gloves and Belt Set]]
* Warlock: [[Corrupted Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Wicked Gloves and Belt Set]]
* Warrior: [[Immoveable Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Unstoppable Gloves and Belt Set]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|5|97}}
*9,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You're ready to perform the exchange? 

==Completion==
Our agreement remains in place.  Just remember, this is but a taste of what awaits you.  Free me of this cursed fate and I will reward you with items of truly great power.

== Notes ==
* You must hand in your [[Dungeon Set 1]] belt and gloves to complete this quest. You will lose any enchantment that is on those items.
* If you have multiple sets of belts or gloves (1 equipped, 1 in a bag) and turn in this quest, you will lose both sets of items. If you want to keep one for later, put one set in the bank.
