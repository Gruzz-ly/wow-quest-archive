==Objectives==
Speak with [[Belloc Brightblade]] at [[Grommash Hold]] in [[Orgrimmar]].

== Description ==
That pyramid at the [[Maker's Rise|Maker's Terrace]]{{Sic}} in [[Uldum]] is nothing of the sort. It's a [[Forge of Origination|giant machine]] that can be reconfigured for any number of uses.

[[Deathwing]] was going to have the [[Twilight's Hammer]] turn it into a massive weapon!

<name>, you have to take the portal to get this information to Belloc Brightblade at Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar. He'll know what to do. 

== Completion ==
Uldum? What about Uldum? Speak quickly! 

== Notes ==
There's a portal to Orgrimmar in the [[Temple of Earth]], so take it instead of pestering a mage.

==Trivia==
The quest's title and quest text is a reference to the film ''{{Wp|Star Wars (film)|Star Wars}}'' (1977) and {{Wp|Obi-Wan Kenobi}}'s line "That's no moon", said in reference to the {{Wp|Death Star}}.

==Progression==
{{To Uldum!}}
