==Objectives==
Go to [[Shadowfang Keep]] and obtain the Commander's Holy Symbol from [[Commander Springvale]], 5 crates of Moonsteel Ingots, and 5 Deathless Sinew.
*[[Commander's Holy Symbol]]
*[[Moonsteel Ingots]] (5)
*[[Deathless Sinew]] (5)

==Description==
Your time as an apprentice has come to an end, <name>. You are ready to advance to the rank of adept, to become a full [[Blood Knights|blood knight]] in service to [[Silvermoon City|Silvermoon]].

To honor your accomplishments, the [[warchief]] has commissioned his personal [[smith]] to forge a weapon for you.

The cursed Shadowfang Keep in [[Silverpine Forest]] is the only place to get the materials you'll need. Travel there and recover the holy symbol of Commander Springvale, a supply of moonsteel ingots, and sinew from the [[ghoul]]s and [[geist]]s there.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Morningstar of the Order
|Battlemace of the Order
|Greatmace of the Order
}}

You will also receive:
* 2,300 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the materials I'll need for your weapon?

==Completion==
I don't know how you came by such a large supply of moonsteel, <name>, but I haven't worked with it in years. It will be both a challenge and a pleasure to create this weapon for you.

==Notes==
Saru Steelfury can be found inside the [[Blacksmith|smithy]] in Orgrimmar's [[Valley of Honor]].{{coords|76|34|Orgrimmar}}

:{{text|say|Saru Steelfury|Perhaps you won't have to rely on your chanting so much with a proper weapon by your side.}}

:{{text|say|Saru Steelfury|I haven't worked with moonsteel in years, but it's not the kind of thing you forget. Apprentices, it's time to show you how to work real metal!}}
:{{text|say|Saru Steelfury|Your weapon is finished. I think you will find our work a fitting reward for your loyalty to the Horde. Use it to remind our enemies why they should fear us!}}
