==Objectives==
Meet [[Ebyssian]] in [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
Heroes of the [[Horde]], I bring news. The [[Dragon Isles]] are awakening!

The Isles went dormant in the wake of the [[Great Sundering|Sundering]]. But now, at long last, they have called [[Dragon|my kin]] and I home.

While the Isles hold many wonders, it is also a perilous land. We will require the aid of our mortal allies to reclaim our legacy.

I am about to present the [[Dragon Aspect|Aspects]]' invitation to the [[Horde Council]] in Orgrimmar. Meet me there and we shall see what they have to say.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|57|40}}
*1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I am grateful you have answered the call. Your courage will be welcome on the journey ahead.

==Notes==
During the [[Tempest Unleashed]] event, this quest was available at level 10.
