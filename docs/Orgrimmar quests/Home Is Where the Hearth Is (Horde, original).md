==Objectives==
Speak with [[Innkeeper Nufa]] to make The Wyvern's Tail your home.
* Make [[The Wyvern's Tail]] your home

==Description==
I don't know about you, but I'm in the mood for some good ol' fashioned recreation!

Why don't we head over to The Wyvern's Tail and cool off with a few pints of [[:Cobo Cola]]?

While we're there, speak with Innkeeper Nufa to make The Wyvern's Tail your new home. That way, if you ever find yourself stranded without a [[flight master]] nearby, you can use your [[:hearthstone]] to return to the [[inn]].

Not only is it faster than a [[wyvern]], but you'll save yourself some dough in the process! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
How can I help you today, <class>? Are you looking for a place to stay?

==Completion==
As long as The Wyvern's Tail is your home, you can find a warm fire here when you return.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Cork Fizzlepop|Come on, let's hit the Wyvern's Tail. You can buy me a drink!}}

;Leaving the Barracks
:{{text|say|[[Provisioner Jin'hake]]|Hey <name>! I have some fresh armaments that [[Warlord Breka Grimaxe|Breka]] thought you might be interested in purchasing.}}
He offers the quest reward weapons from [[The Re-Deather]]. You may need to purchase one if your new specialization uses a different [[Weapon|weapon type]] than the item you automatically received from the quest.

;On turn-in
:''[[Shuja Grimaxe]] and two [[Orgrimmar Grunt]]s appear in the doorway to the inn.''
:{{text|say|Shuja Grimaxe|<Name>, I bring word from the [[warchief]]!}}
