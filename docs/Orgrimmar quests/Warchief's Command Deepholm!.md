==Objectives==
Speak with {{NPC||Farseer Krogar}} at the [[Western Earthshrine]] in [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
All able-bodied members of the [[Horde]] are hereby ordered to report to Farseer Krogar at the Western Earthshrine in Orgrimmar.

The [[Earthen Ring]], led by our former Warchief, {{NPC||Thrall}}, requires our aid! They report that the [[elemental plane]] of [[Deepholm]] threatens to overtake our world!

The Western Earthshrine can be found just north of the [[Valley of Wisdom]].

Onward, <brother/sister>! Destiny calls!

==Completion==
Our world is in danger, <name>! We need the help of great heroes, like you, to save it!

==Notes==
Fly north from the Warchief's Command Board past the new flight path/zeppelin tower area to reach the Western Earthshrine on the rise northeast of the Valley of Wisdom.

==Progression==
