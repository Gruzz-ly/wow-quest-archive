This quest is part of the '''Friend of the Sin'dorei''' quest chain.  This quest chain starts with [[Friend of the Sin'dorei]].

==Objectives==
[[Lady Sylvanas Windrunner]] wants you to take the Letter Sealed by Sylvanas to [[High Overlord Saurfang]] in [[Orgrimmar]], capital of [[Durotar]]. 
*[[Letter Sealed by Sylvanas]] (provided)

==Description==
I haven't lost any love for my homeland or its people, as you know. I've fought tooth and nail for [[Silvermoon]] to be allowed a place beside [[Undercity]] and [[Orgrimmar]] at the negotiating table.

This should silence any opposition. Take this letter to Saurfang in Orgrimmar. As leader of the orcs he must have a say in accepting the sin'dorei's pledge.

I've added my own seal to the letter as a personal endorsement. Go northwest of the city and board the zeppelin bound for Durotar at the tower.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1650 [[XP]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Yes, <class>?

==Completion==
<Saurfang begins to read the letter.>

So the [[blood elf|blood elves]] finally are finally taking of that little problem. It is no surprise that it took you and a whole regiment of [[Forsaken]] to get the job done.

<Saurfang breaks into laughter.>

I suppose there's no stopping this. In the end we need them just as much as they need us.
