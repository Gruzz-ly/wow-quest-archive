==Objectives==
Meet [[Ambassador Blackguard]] at the [[Orgrimmar Embassy]].

==Description==
The {{Au|Mag'har}} face a new future, <class>.

{{Au|Draenor}} has fallen. We cannot know if we will ever set eyes upon our homeland again. But this is not the time to wallow in past sorrows.

Destiny is ours to decide. [[Orgrimmar]] is our home now, and we must make our mark upon this land!

Show our allies in the [[Horde]] what it means to be Mag'har. Meet with the [[ambassador]] at the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|warchief]]'s embassy, then go forth and claim victories across [[Azeroth]].

Strength and honor, <name>!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||1|25}}
* 395 [[XP]]
