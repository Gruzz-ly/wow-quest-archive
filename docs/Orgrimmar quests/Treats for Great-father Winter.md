'''Treats for Great-father Winter''' is a one-time quest each [[Feast of Winter Veil]]. Find five [[Small Egg]]s on any level 20-or-below bird, [[Ice Cold Milk]] at any innkeeper or drink vendor, and [[Holiday Spices]] at the [[Smokywood Pastures]] general goods vendors. The recipe to make a [[Gingerbread Cookie]] is sold by the same general goods vendors.

==Objectives==
Bring 5 Gingerbread Cookies and an Ice Cold Milk to Greatfather Winter in [[Orgrimmar]].
*[[Ice Cold Milk]]
*[[Gingerbread Cookie]] (5)

==Description==
Hey, can you do Greatfather Winter a favor, um, little <boy/girl>?

Not to needlessly talk about myself in the third person, but Greatfather Winter has been at this all day and he could use a treat himself. Some gingerbread cookies and ice cold milk to wash them down with would really hit the spot. Think you could be a friend to the Greatfather and fetch some for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|9}} at max level)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]
*+25 reputation with [[Everlook]]
*+25 reputation with [[Gadgetzan]]
*+25 reputation with [[Ratchet]]
*[[Smokywood Pastures Gift Pack]]

==Progress==
All this talk of treats has given me a hankering for some myself.  Mmmm... gingerbread cookies and milk...

==Completion==
You're quite the helper to ol' Greatfather Winter there, <name>.  Have a great Feast of Winter Veil.

Here's a little something... you know, for the effort.
