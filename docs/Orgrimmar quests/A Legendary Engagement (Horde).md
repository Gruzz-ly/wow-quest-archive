==Objectives==
Speak to [[Anachronos]] in the [[Caverns of Time]].

== Description ==
A pleasure, <class>.

<Ziradormi smiles.>

It was kind of you to arrive so quickly.

For reasons unknown to me, my master seeks audience with you.

I would counsel you not to take this invitation lightly, <name>. Anachronos seldom has cause to interact with mortals. Wisdom would dictate that you seek him out in the Caverns of Time at once.

Speak to me when you are ready and I shall personally deliver you.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|25|94}}

== Completion ==
It is no whimsical dalliance that brings you here, mortal.

Muster every fiber of your courage for what you are about to behold.

== Notes ==
In order to obtain this quest, you must either have the [[Defender of a Shattered World]] achievement, or have killed a [[Molten Lord]] in the [[Firelands (instance)|Firelands]].
