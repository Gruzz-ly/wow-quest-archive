;Description
:Hi. I'm Ambassador Blackguard.

:<Blackguard looks down at a piece of paper in his hand.>

:On behalf of the [[warchief]], I am honored to welcome you to Orgrimmar, <race>.

:<Glances at you, smiles unconvincingly, then looks back at the paper.>

:As a lifetime of adventure unfolds before you, be assured that... uh...

:You know what? I've been reading this same greeting all day. Enough's enough.

:Examine the Warchief's Command Board and find out where you can adventure. Run along.

;Progress
:Another world... another time... this is an age of wonder.

This quest used to reuse the progress text of the [[Stranger in a Strange Land (Mag'har orc)|Mag'har orc quest]] of the same name. This makes for a slightly odd result, since vulpera are neither from another world nor from another time.
