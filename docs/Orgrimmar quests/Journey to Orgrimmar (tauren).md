==Objectives==
Speak with [[Martin Goodchilde]] at [[Barracks (Orgrimmar)|The Barracks]] in [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
A messenger just asked me to pass along an invitation. It is from the [[priest trainer]], Martin Goodchilde, at The Barracks in Orgrimmar.

He asks that you meet with him at your soonest convenience. The Barracks can be found within the [[Valley of Honor]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 150 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
Thank you for coming to see me, <name>.

==Pre-''Shadowlands'' version==
{{Rfg-section|9.0.1}}
I just received word that you are needed in Orgrimmar, <name>. Seer Liwatha has asked for you to return to the city as quickly as you are able. Her message didn't include any other information, and the matter seemed urgent.

Look for Seer Liwatha in Orgrimmar's Valley of Wisdom.
