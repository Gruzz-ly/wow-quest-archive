==Objectives==
Burn Dissident Propaganda in [[Orgrimmar]].
*Propaganda burned (6)

==Description==
Recently, dissidents have been posting propaganda around the city and spreading all manner of lies.

This is no time to entertain delusion. An army of traitors and sworn enemies assembles at our gates. These ingrates would see us become pin cushions for the [[Alliance]]'s [[archer]]s.

<Nathanos rolls his eyes.>

Tear down the rubbish. It can only lead to panic in the streets. 

And should you encounter any... resistance... you are hereby authorized to respond with force.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Well done. I expect you faced little resistance of note.

==Notes==
Accept [[Militia (quest)]] and [[Siegebreakers]].

Burn: [[WANTED: Another Warchief!]], [[Warchief or War Criminal?]], [[Do Not Trust Sylvanas!]], [[Worse Than Hellscream!]], [[Dark Rangers, Dark Times]], [[The Death of the Horde]].

If a poster is burnt, the [[Dismayed Citizen]]s will attack. Make Kill them.

Head to the [[Gates of Orgrimmar]] and turn in three quests to [[Nathanos Blightcaller]].
