==Objectives==
Return to [[Bladeguard Sonji]] at [[Grommash Hold]] in [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
That should keep those [[naga]] down!

You can have the honor of telling Bladeguard Sonji that the threat to [[Zuldazar]]'s coast has been contained.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
The naga threat has been contained? I'll trust your word on this, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Nisha|Time for use to get outta here. See you back in Orgrimmar.}}

Upon turning in to Sonji back in Grommash Hold:
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Sonji|Thank you for dealing with dis matter swiftly. De [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] are fortunate to have such dependable allies.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Baine Bloodhoof]]|This was not my doing, Sonji. But I am grateful that the threat has been dealt with.}}

Much like [[Commander Dresh]] did earlier, Sonji turns around and walks out of the hold. Talk to [[Kiro]] in the corner to pick up [[Meet with Meerah]] for the last part of the questline.
