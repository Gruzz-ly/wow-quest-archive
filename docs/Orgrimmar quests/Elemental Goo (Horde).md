This daily quest requires 475 [[Jewelcrafting]].

==Objectives==
Collect 10 Elemental Goo from any Cataclysm elemental and bring them to [[Marith Lazuria]] in [[Orgrimmar]].
*[[Elemental Goo]] (10)

==Description==
Instead of using the tired old method of setting gems into rings and such, I use an innovative new method. I simply glue on the gems with Vernstrom Elemental Glue! The [[Vernstrom|doctor]] needs more elemental goo for another batch, though, and I have a whole bunch of setting to do. Can you go get me some?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|16|53|}} (at max level)
*{{cost|ijt=1}}

==Progress==
Did you bring me the elemental goo?

==Completion==
Thanks.  Erm.  Just set them over there.  I need to figure out how to get my hand off of this jar?

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
