==Objectives==
Capture 5 Elemental-Imbued Weapons from [[Anvilrage]] [[Dark Iron dwarf|dwarves]] in [[Blackrock Depths]], then break them over the [[Black Anvil]] in [[Shadowforge City]].

==Description==
Blackrock Depths has long been home to our enemies, but now the [[Shattered Hand]] has discovered that the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Irons]] and [[Twilight's Hammer]] are increasing their collaboration. Using the cult's knowledge, the Dark Iron dwarves are imbuing their weapons with [[elemental]] powers. They've outfitted the Anvilrage legion with these fearsome new weapons.

I want you to go into Blackrock Depths and gather the weapons from the Anvilrage dwarves there and break them over the Black Anvil in the heart of Shadowforge City.
