==Objectives==
Go to [[Shadowfang Keep]] and obtain the Commander's Holy Symbol from [[Commander Springvale]], 5 crates of Moonsteel Ingots, and 5 Deathless Sinew.
*[[Commander's Holy Symbol]]
*[[Moonsteel Ingots]] (5)
*[[Deathless Sinew]] (5)

==Description==
I have watched your training, <name>. Yours is the path of an exemplary [[Sunwalkers|Sunwalker]], a brave defender of the [[Horde]] and a follower of our ways.

As a reward for your dedication, the [[warchief]] has commissioned his personal smith to forge a special weapon.

The cursed Shadowfang Keep in [[Silverpine Forest]] is the only place to get the materials you'll need. Travel there and recover the holy symbol of Commander Springvale, a supply of moonsteel ingots, and sinew from the [[ghoul]]s and [[geist]]s infesting the keep.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Mace of the Sunwalker
|Battlehammer of the Sunwalker
|Greatsword of the Sunwalker
}}

You will also receive:
* 2,300 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the materials I'll need for your weapon?

==Completion==
I haven't worked with the Sunwalkers before, but from all I've heard, the warchief holds you in high regard. It was a great honor to be asked to forge this weapon for you and I hope it will serve you well.

==Notes==
;On completion
:{{text|say|Saru Steelfury|I have to admit, you're not what I expected when I received the warchief's commission.}}
:{{text|say|Saru Steelfury|Perhaps you won't have to rely on your chanting so much with a proper weapon by your side.}}
:(''Saru Steelfury walks over to the anvil. He is joined by [[Snarl]] and [[Ug'thok]].'')
:{{text|say|Saru Steelfury|I haven't worked with moonsteel in years, but it's not the kind of thing you forget. Apprentices, it's time to show you how to work real metal!}}
:{{text|say|Saru Steelfury|Your weapon is finished. I think you will find our work a fitting reward for your loyalty to the Horde. Use it to remind our enemies why they should fear us!}}

Despite the {{g|Sl}} changes, the quest is still offered by [[Sunwalker Atohmo]].
