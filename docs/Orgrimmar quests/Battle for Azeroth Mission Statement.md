Enter [[Grommash Hold]], and a scene plays:
:''Sylvanas is standing on the throne.''
:{{text|bossemote|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|I require the services of one whom I can trust completely.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|To win this war, the Horde needs allies.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|[[Anduin Wrynn|The boy king]] has something that does not belong to him. I want it back.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|You are to infiltrate Stormwind and liberate a political prisoner. One who could change the course of the war... in our favor.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Are you up to the task?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Nathanos Blightcaller|We will not fail you... my queen.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Oh, I know you won't.}}

On the other side of the cutscene:
:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|I have taken the liberty of assembling a team for you. Retrieve my prize.}}

Sylvanas has unique gossip text here:
:Too many of our navy's ships were destroyed by the Legion or by the Alliance. I have our dockmasters working overnight, but we need more.

Go with Nathanos to [[The Broken Tusk]] where [[Rokhan]] and [[Thalyssra]] are. [[Deathguard Malcolm]] and [[Deathguard Sansa]] guard the entrance.

:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Greetings.}}
:Rokhan waves
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|'Ey, mon.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Good, we're all here.}}

Turn in to Nathanos.
