==Objectives==
Collect 10 [[Monstrous Clam Meat]] from the clams near the eastern shoreline, just south of Orgrimmar. Return to Razgar once you are done.
*[[Monstrous Clam Meat]] (10)

==Description==
Nothing tastes like fresh monstrous clam meat, <name>. I have been so busy with work these past few weeks that I have not been able to make it out to the local clam spawning grounds. Think you could run down there and gather some of those tasty treats for me?

The clams can be found near the shoreline on the eastern coast of Durotar. Should be plenty right around the Orgrimmar docks. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}} (or {{cost|9|40}} on lvl 85), +1 [[Fishing]]
{{itembox|You will also receive:
|Bag of Shiny Things}}

==Progress==
Were you able to find the clams? 

==Completion==
Looks like you found the clams, <name>.  These will do nicely. 

==Notes==
This quest is a requirement for the achievement [[Fish or Cut Bait: Orgrimmar]].
