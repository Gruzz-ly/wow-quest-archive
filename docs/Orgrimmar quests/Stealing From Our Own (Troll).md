==Objectives==
Retrieve 6 [[Barrel of Kezan Rice|Barrels of Kezan Rice]].  Deliver the rice to Marogg in Orgrimmar.

Bring the [[Barrel of Kezan Rice|Barrels of Kezan Rice]] to [[Marogg]].
* [[Barrel of Kezan Rice]] (6)

==Description==
As you know <name>, [[Garrosh]] has relegated the [[Bilgewater Cartel|Goblins]] of Orgrimmar to the western outskirts of the city.  Fortunately, that means that we have easy access to their supplies.  I am working on a large batch of jambalaya for the infantry and I need as much rice as possible.  Lucky for us, the Goblins keep it stored in barrels near their structures.  Retrieve these barrels of Kezan rice for me and I should be able to finish up.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{Cost|7|40}}<br/>
[[Epicurean's Award]], +1 Cooking Skill

==Progress==
Were you able to acquire the rice? 

==Completion==
I see you are a skilled thief as well, <name>.  Don't worry, we will return the rice once we are done... or not.
