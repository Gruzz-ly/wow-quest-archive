==Completion==
A [[dragon]] slayer and a seasoned leatherworker? You do not cease to astonish, hero. I am humbled.

Please accept what I am about to teach you. This knowledge will prove to be invaluable if you are to destroy what remains of the [[Black Dragonflight]].

Create the cloak from the scales of the brood mother. It will protect you and your allies against the incendiary breath of the Lord of [[Blackrock Mountain|Blackrock]]... [[Nefarian]].

==Notes==
This quest is only available to leatherworkers who have completed [[Victory for the Horde]] or [[A Most Puzzling Circumstance (Horde)]]. It teaches the recipe for the [[Onyxia Scale Cloak]].

==Patch changes==
