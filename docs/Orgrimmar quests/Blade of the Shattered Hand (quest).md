==Objectives==
Go to [[Shadowfang Keep]] and obtain Springvale's Sharpening Stone from [[Commander Springvale]], 5 crates of Moonsteel Ingots, and 5 Deathless Sinew.
*[[Springvale's Sharpening Stone]]
*[[Moonsteel Ingots]] (5)
*[[Deathless Sinew]] (5)

==Description==
Many members of the [[Shattered Hand]] do not survive their training, <name>. Not only have you survived, but you will soon become a feared blade of the [[Horde]].

As a reward for your progress, the [[warchief]] has commissioned his personal [[smith]] to forge a weapon.

The cursed Shadowfang Keep in [[Silverpine Forest]] is the only place to get the materials you'll need. Travel there and recover Commander Springvale's sharpening stone, a supply of moonsteel ingots, and sinew from the [[ghoul]]s and [[geist]]s infesting the keep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*[[Blade of the Shattered Hand]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the materials I'll need for your weapon?

==Completion==
[[Gordul]] told me that you would be bringing a variety of unusual materials, but I didn't expect anything like this. Moonsteel is said to be very rare and there's only one place I know to get it. You have risked much for this weapon, <name>, and I'll see to it that you receive a fitting reward.
