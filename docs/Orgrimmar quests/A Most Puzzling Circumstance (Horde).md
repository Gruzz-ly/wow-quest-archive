==Progress==
What is the meaning of this?

==Completion==
You've brought me the head of someone who is... No, best not to think about it too hard. You'll be wanting recompense for your heroic deeds, no doubt.

==Notes==
The reason that this quest doesn't turn in at [[Thrall]] and does not give a city-wide buff as it did in the level 60 version is because in [[Patch 3.2.2]] Onyxia is '''officially dead according to Warcraft lore'''.  Though players still have the ability to kill Onyxia as a boss, in Warcraft lore she was killed by a party led by [[Varian Wrynn]], [[Broll Bearmantle]], [[Valeera Sanguinar]] and [[Thargas Anvilmar]].  This would also explain why the quest name has changed to "A Most Puzzling Circumstance" and why Neeru displays such puzzlement upon seeing the head of Onyxia.

Blizzard put in a number of rather subtle "jokes" into the quest such as stating in the quest text that "You have accomplished the truly impossible," referencing of course that although Onyxia is still a level 80 raid boss, she is officially dead according to lore.
