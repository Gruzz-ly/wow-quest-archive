Kill 6 Twilight Emissaries and recover Loregrain's Grimoire from [[Pyromancer Loregrain]] at the [[Shrine of Thaurissan]] in [[Blackrock Depths]].
*[[Twilight Emissary]] slain (6)
*[[Loregrain's Grimoire]]

==Description==
The power of the [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron forces]] and their [[Twilight's Hammer]] allies is growing within [[Blackrock Mountain]]. Pyromancer Loregrain is a powerful and influential [[Mage|magus]] in the Twilight's Hammer delegation. If we could get our hands on his grimoire, I could develop counters for Twilight's Hammer spells and curses.

You must descend into Blackrock Depths, locate the Shrine of Thaurissan, and capture the grimoire. Show Loregrain and his Twilight minions no mercy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|10|70|}}
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*[[Hood of the Arcane Path]]

==Progress==
Have you managed to capture the pyromancer's grimoire?

==Completion==
<Ureda looks through the grimoire with interest.>

There's a wealth of [[arcane]] knowledge in this book! We will learn much about our enemies and the arcane arts.

==Progression==
#[[Meet with Feenix Arcshine]] (optional)
#[[The Pyromancer's Grimoire (Horde)]]
