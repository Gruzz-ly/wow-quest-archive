==Objectives==
Make contact with an [[Alliance]] [[Priest]] at the gates of [[Stormwind]] and gain Diplomatic Immunity by using your Diplomat Rings on each other. Then, enter [[Stormwind Cathedral]] and speak to [[High Priestess Laurena]]. You will lose Diplomatic Immunity if you stray too far from your escorting Priest or engage in combat.

==Description==
Your next task will be quite difficult, <name>.

You must make contact with an Alliance priest who seeks the shards. You will identify each other with your rings. They will escort you into Stormwind Cathedral, where you will need to speak with High Priestess Laurena.

If you can convince the priests of the Alliance that our intentions are peaceful, we may have a chance at reuniting the shards.

==Completion==
You must be the <class> I was told to expect. I hope my countrymen were polite, if not welcoming.
