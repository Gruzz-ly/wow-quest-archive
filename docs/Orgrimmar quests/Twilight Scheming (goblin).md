==Objectives==
Use the Glowing Torch to destroy 8 copies of The Twilight Creed in the [[Domicile]] of [[Blackrock Depths]].
*Copies of [[The Twilight Creed]] burned (8)
*[[Glowing Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
It wasn't enough for [[Deathwing|their master]] to [[Cataclysm (event)|break]] [[Azeroth|the world]], no! [[Twilight's Hammer]] is doing its best to unite our enemies against us, particularly in Blackrock Depths. They've got a whole team of [[Ambassador|emissaries]] down there spreading propaganda aimed at starting a joint campaign.

I've always heard that the medium's the message. Well, it's time to destroy the message!

I want you to go into the Domicile of Blackrock Depths and use this torch to burn those Twilight's Hammer books!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|10|70|}}
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]
*[[Crown of Golden Worship]]

==Completion==
That's the way you do it when you don't have an army. And now, Twilight's Hammer won't, either.

==Progression==
#[[Journey to Orgrimmar (goblin) (2)]] (optional)
#[[Twilight Scheming (goblin)]]
