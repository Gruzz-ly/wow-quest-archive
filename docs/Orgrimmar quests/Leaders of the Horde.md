==Objectives==
Order the [[Horde]] leaders in [[Orgrimmar]] to prepare for [[Battle at the Gates of Orgrimmar|battle]].
* Speak with [[Overlord Geya'rah]]
* Speak with [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]]
* Speak with [[Eitrigg]]

==Description==
[[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]] has shown his true colors and now enlists the aid of the [[Alliance]].

Meet with those who have remained loyal to the Horde. They are to ready themselves for the battle against our enemies.

And as for Eitrigg... bring him to [[Nathanos Blightcaller|Nathanos]]. A quick death is too lenient a punishment for his treachery.

Go, <name>. Let us end this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So be it. Our choices have been made.

==Notes==
Upon acceptance:

:''[[Lenara|Dark Ranger Lenara]] runs out of [[Grommash Hold]] and stops in front of its gate.''

:{{text|say|[[Sylvanas Windrunner|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner]]|Report to Nathanos once you have rallied our forces. There remains much to do.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|We will grind these traitors into dust. Your loyalty will be rewarded.}}

Geya'rah is standing before her soldiers. Speak with her:

:So these cowardly traitors show their faces at last! I shall enjoy removing their heads from their necks.

:{{gossip|Have you completed your preparations for the battle?}}

:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|HA! The {{Au|Mag'har}} always stand ready to crush the bones of our enemies! For the Horde!}}

Gallywix is busy destroying evidence.

:{{text|say|[[Trade Prince]] Gallywix|Move it, you mooks! Make like the [[warchief]] and burn those files!}}

Speak with Gallywix:

:What do you want? Can't you see I am very busy filin' important paperwork?

:{{gossip|Have you completed your preparations for the battle?}}

:{{text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|The warchief's mechs are good to go, but those things ain't cheap! She better be ready to pay on delivery.}}

Eitrigg is in the [[Hall of the Brave]]. Speak with him:

:We come to this crossroads once again. Have we learned nothing?

:{{gossip|You were seen meeting with Saurfang in secret.}}

:So Sylvanas knows where I stand. Good. I tire of deceit.

:She is driven by something dark, and I will draw blood for her no longer.

:I plan to join Saurfang's army outside the gates. Will you come with me?

:{{gossip|Never, traitor!}}

This choice leads to [[Traitors In Our Midst]].

:{{gossip|This is madness. We must leave Orgrimmar at once.}}

This choice leads to [[Not My Warchief]].
