==Objectives==
Speak with [[Great-father Winter]]. He is located near the [[Smokywood Pastures]] vendor area in [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
;Wonderform Operator
I hear Great-father Winter - with the generous support of Smokywood Pastures - has put presents for everyone under the tree in Orgrimmar. I wish I could go, but I've got to look after the [[PX-238 Winter Wondervolt]].

But you should definitely check it out. I'm sure Great-father Winter has some presents with your name on them.

;Holiday Enthusiast
I hear Great-father Winter has put presents for everyone under the tree in Orgrimmar.

You should definitely check it out. I'm sure Great-father Winter has some presents with your name on them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*10 [[XP]]
*{{cost|2|20}} at max level

==Completion==
Oh, ho hello there! You can only be here for one reason: to open your Winter Veil presents.

Now, don't you worry, Great-father Winter hasn't forgotten about his favorite <race> <class>. Look under the tree and you'll find your gifts.

During this season of giving, perhaps your friends would also enjoy receiving some of Smokeywood Pasture's excellent products?
