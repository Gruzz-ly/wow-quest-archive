==Objectives==
Using the Withered Scarf, summon and subdue an [[incubus]], then return the Withered Scarf to [[Gan'rul Bloodeye]] in [[Orgrimmar]].
*[[Summoned Incubus]] slain
*[[Withered Scarf]] (provided)

==Description==
Yes... I see. I feel the residual emotions bound within these threads. Love is woven into its stitches. The incubus will not be able to resist.

Take this to the summoning circle in [[Neeru Fireblade|Neeru]]'s tent, <name>. Summon forth a malevolent incubus, then show it your mastery. Do not expect it to be subdued quietly. Ready your [[magic]] and prepare yourself for a fight. Underestimating a [[demon]] has been many a [[warlock]]'s final mistake.

When you have defeated it, return the cloth to me. I will let Magar know what you found.

==Rewards==
You will learn:
*[[Summon Incubus]]

You will also receive:
*1150 [[XP]]
*[[Small Soul Pouch]]

==Progress==
The sayaad are dominators of minds and torturers of souls. Their visage brings the heart joy, leaving you defenseless when they rend your flesh with whip and claw.

Do not entertain the incubus' charms, <name>. Slay it quickly and let it be done.

==Completion==
Hah! Victorious, as expected!

The incubus is subdued, and it will be my pleasure to teach you to summon the demon. You strength is growing, and I have no doubt that this is a mere stepping stone to even greater powers.

I will return the scarf to Magar. I have known that orc for many years, and never did I think he would care for someone the way he cared for Krilge.

It is a reminder of what separates us from the demons. We wield their darkness, but they will never wield us.
