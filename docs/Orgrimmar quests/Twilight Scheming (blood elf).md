==Objectives==
Use the Glowing Torch to destroy 8 copies of The Twilight Creed in the [[Domicile]] of [[Blackrock Depths]].
*Copies of [[The Twilight Creed]] burned (8)
*[[Glowing Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
In Blackrock Depths, [[Twilight's Hammer]] has started to persuade the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Irons]] to strengthen their alliance and prepare their armies for a campaign outside [[Blackrock Mountain|the mountain]].

We must not allow this manipulation to create a combined Dark Iron-Twilight's Hammer force! We must destroy the tools of the cult's persuasion.

I want you to go into Domicile portion of Blackrock Depths and use this torch to burn the books that the Twilight's Hammer is distributing there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|10|70|}}
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]
*[[Crown of the Sunchaser]]

==Completion==
We can only hope your efforts will keep the two forces apart long enough for us to exploit their weakness.

==Progression==
#[[Journey to Orgrimmar (blood elf) (2)]]
#[[Twilight Scheming (blood elf)]]
