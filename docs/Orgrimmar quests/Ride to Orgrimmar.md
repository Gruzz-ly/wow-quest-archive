==Objectives==
Buy a [[Wyvern|wind rider]] to [[Orgrimmar]] from the wind rider master [[Burok]], then bring Grimtak's Meats to [[Gryshka]] in [[Orgrimmar]]. 
*[[Grimtak's Meats]] (provided)

==Description==
For just a few coins I will have a wind rider bring you to Orgrimmar. When you get there, you can take Grimtak's meats to Gryshka. Her inn is in the [[Valley of Strength]].

Speak with me again when you are ready for the journey.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||30}}
* 100 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
* +75 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Something smells good! You don't have raw meat on you, do you?

==Completion==
Oh, wonderful! Those are fine cuts! These are from [[Grimtak]], are they? That orc sure knows his way into a lady's heart...

Oh, I can't wait to cook it. But not too much! Meat is best served rare, don't you think?
