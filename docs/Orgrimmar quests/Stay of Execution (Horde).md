Thank the [[Sunwell]] you were able to save Baine's life, <name>. Thank you.

And [[Jaina Proudmoore]] came to his aid as well. Interesting...

I am glad a champion of the Horde stands with us today.

Are you ready, <name>?

{{Gossip|I am ready to go.}}

===Scenario: Stay of Execution===
''Warlords of Draenor'' [[Bloodmaul Slag Mines]] [[loading screen]] appears. The player appears in the '''Baine Rescue''' version of the [[Siege of Orgrimmar (instance)|Siege of Orgrimmar]]'s [[Underhold]] map.

====Stage 1 – It Begins====
*Description: Get past the guards at the end of the passage.
*Defeat the guards (2)

:''Thrall and Varok run forward.''
:{{Text|say|Thrall|I have not walked these halls since [[Siege of Orgrimmar|we faced]] [[Garrosh Hellscream|Garrosh]].}}
:{{Text|say|[[Varok Saurfang]]|[[Vol'jin]] reopened these halls to provide shelter when the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] [[Third invasion of the Burning Legion|invaded]].}}
:{{Text|say|Varok Saurfang|Now Sylvanas uses them to train her elite soldiers and build her [[:Azerite]] weapons.}}
:''They stop in front of a closed gate and two [[Underhold Elite Guard]]s.''

:{{Text|say|Underhold Elite Guard|Halt! This area is off limits!}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Stay your hand. We're only here to--}}
:{{Text|say|Underhold Elite Guard|That's Saurfang! Kill the traitors!}}
:''Varok leaps at the talking guard, killing her. The other one turns hostile and attacks.''

====Stage 2 – Under Watchful Eyes====
*Description: Avoid the guards as you cross the room with Thrall and Saurfang.
*Speak with Thrall
*Cross room with Thrall and Saurfang.

;Speaking with Thrall
With Saurfang branded a traitor by Sylvanas, the guards will attack us on sight.

[[Rokhan]] provided a totem that can conceal us for a time. Even so, wary guards may spot us.

Go carefully, <name>. I don't want to leave a trail of bodies in our wake. These loyalists are still part of the Horde.

{{Gossip|Understood. I'll stick close.}}

[[File:Stay of Execution - Totem of Concealment.jpg|thumb|Thrall holding the Totem of Concealment.]]
All three are stealthed with the [https://www.wowhead.com/spell=295885/totem-of-concealment Totem of Concealment].

:{{Text|say|Underhold Elite Guard|You aren't supposed to be in here!}}
:{{Text|say|Orgrimmar Peon|Ahh! No more work! No more work!}}
:''The peon runs away.''
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Move! Quickly!}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Go!}}
:{{Text|say|Underhold Elite Guard|It's the traitor, Saurfang!}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Hold here!}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Go!}}

====Stage 3 – Devise a Plan====
*Description: Devise a plan with Thrall.
*Devise a plan with Thrall

;Speaking with Thrall
We've gotten this far, but the power of Rokhan's totem is fading.

Saurfang and I need another way to avoid being noticed.

Even these loyalists know you as a champion of the Horde, <name>. Perhaps you could provide a distraction.

{{Gossip|I can keep them busy.}}

====Stage 4 – Fight Me!====
[[File:Stay of Execution picnic.png|thumb|For wandering Hordies, a surprising but beautiful sight awaits!]]

*Description: Challenge Elite Horde warriors to provide a distraction.
*Duel Lenara

After entering the room, Varok and Thrall sneak through. The first area is full of [[Forsaken War-Alchemist]]s and [[Unruly Experiment]]s. Continue further to the training area with [[Dark Ranger (Stay of Execution)|Dark Rangers]], [[Lyani Shadestalker]], and [[Lenara|Dark Ranger Lenara]].

;Speaking with Lenara
<Name>. You are a reasonably capable <class>. Do you seek to test your skills before returning to the war?

{{Gossip|Yes I would. Care to duel?}}

;Jaina's gossip
The longer we are here, the greater the risk. We must keep going.

;Speaking with Thrall
It seems our lot has been thrown in with the Alliance.

I know what it is to fight against them, <name>. To feel the loss and rage of war in your heart.

But I ask you to put that aside... At least until our friend Baine is safe.

{{Gossip|I will do this for Baine, and for the Horde!}}

{{Gossip|I don't trust the Alliance, but I don't see another alternative right now.}}

:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|That animosity only benefits [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]]. Her power is considerable. Divided, we are no match for her--or the [[N'Zoth|master]] she serves.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Sylvanas has the loyalty of the people. So long as she is warchief, this war will rage within their hearts. We cannot stop it.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Perhaps we do not need to. It might be enough to direct our attacks against Azshara rather than the Alliance.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|That plan would infuriate [[Nathanos Blightcaller|Blightcaller]]... which makes me like it all the more. Hmm... [[The Fall of Shan Bu (Alliance)#Notes|"It stops when you turn from one another and walk away..."]]}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|What was that?}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|A lesson that Jaina Proudmoore and I needed to learn. Your counsel is wise, Thalyssra. Our focus must be on ending Azshara's reign.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|But if the Alliance undermines our efforts, the flames of war will rise again.}}
