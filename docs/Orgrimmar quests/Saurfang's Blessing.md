==Objectives==
Deliver the letter to [[High Overlord Saurfang]] at [[Orgrimmar]].
* [[To Saurfang of the Horde]] (provided)

==Description==
You are now, and forever will be, a [[Knights of the Ebon Blade|Knight of the Ebon Blade]], <name>, but know this: you were once a hero of the [[Horde]].

<[[Darion Mograine|Darion]] stares at you.>

This order must establish allies for itself if it is to survive. You must represent the Knights of the Ebon Blade to the Horde.

On the platform, southeast of me, is a portal to Orgrimmar. Take this letter, given to me on your behalf by [[Tirion Fordring|Lord Fordring]], and deliver it to High Overlord Saurfang. Use the portal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,700 [[XP]]
*+6000 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
You bring me a letter, [[death knight]]?

Let me see it.

==Completion==
Fordring... Yes, I know him well. If any other man or [[orc]] asked me for such a favor I would have killed you where you stood. Fordring, though, is an honored hero among orcs.

Very well, Death Knight, We accept you as a member of the Horde, and embrace your order as allies.

For the Horde!

Eitrigg is alive because of this paladin. He would have been executed had Lord Fordring not broken him out of Stratholme.

Tirion Fordring, to have sacrificed everything to save the life of an orc... Indeed, this is a rare event.

Yes. For Tirion Fordring and for Eitrigg! We will accept you as a member of the Horde and your order as allies.

Blood and honor! For the Horde!
