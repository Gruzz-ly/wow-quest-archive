==Objectives==
Return to [[Grommash Hold]] within [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
Let's head back to Orgrimmar.

I'm sure [[Kiro]]'s expecting us.

We really shouldn't make him wait.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
<name>, I have done the [[vulpera]] a disservice.

I am afraid my oversight may have cost the [[Horde]] a notable ally.

==Notes==
On accept, Meerah runs out of the building.
:{{Text|say|Meerah|Meet you back in the big city!}}

She stops in front of [[Dolly]], [[Dot (alpaca)|Dot]], and her wagon. If talked to again, she says:
:No need to wait for me, <name>. I'll make my way back to Orgrimmar once I've fed Dolly and Dot.

Return to Grommash Hold, where [[Bladeguard Sonji]], [[Baine Bloodhoof]], [[Commander Dresh]], and [[First Arcanist Thalyssra]] now stand gathered in front of the throne while Kiro, Meerah, and [[Nisha]] wait near the entrance. Talk to Baine to turn in.
