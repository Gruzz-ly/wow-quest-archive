==Objectives==
Take the Mark of Bloodhoof to [[Garrosh Hellscream]], located in [[Grommash Hold]] in [[Orgrimmar]].

You may speak with [[Tal]] the Wind Rider Master to travel there, or wait for the zeppelin.
* [[Mark of Bloodhoof]] (Provided)

== Description ==
Much has changed outside of [[Mulgore]], <name>. The world is torn, and our Horde allies have turned down dark paths. We must guide them. Even in the darkest hour, we will bravely hold our heads high, and honor the [[Earth Mother]] in all we do.

You must go, <name>, and be this example. Go to Orgrimmar. Tell Saurfang how the [[Grimtotem]] were driven out. Let him know our pride and discipline, our strength and sorrow.

Tal at the Skytower will send you on your way. Go in peace, and never forget your people.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3|50}}
*[[Tauren Bluff Rug]]

==Progress==
What brings you to me, <class>?

==Completion==
The Grimtotem have been forced out of Mulgore? You must be a fierce warrior to earn the praise of Baine Bloodhoof. The Horde needs heroes, ones that hold honor in their hearts. Very well, <class>. I accept you as one of us.

For the Horde!

== Notes ==
Walk to the high tower in the middle and up to the top where Tal is. Talk to him to get a free ride to Orgrimmar.
:{{gossip|''Send me to Orgrimmar.''}}
Walk to the west where there's an elevator down, then move inside the big building in the center of Valley of Strength.

There is no follow-up quest. [[Gotura Fourwinds]] stands nearby, offering [[Preserving the Barrens]], starting the [[Northern Barrens storyline]]. Alternatively, you can head back to the [[Warchief's Command Board]] and pick up [[Warchief's Command: Azshara!]] for the [[Azshara storyline]].
