==Objectives==
Take the Illegible Correspondence to someone in [[Orgrimmar]].
* [[Illegible Correspondence]] (provided)

==Description==
The footlocker contains a number of [[Lord Admiral]] [[Daelin Proudmoore]]'s personal effects. Among them is a rolled letter, sealed with sea-green wax and stamped with the [[House Proudmoore|Proudmoore]] crest. The parchment tears easily and requires careful handling and it appears that the ink has been largely washed away by tide and time.

Perhaps someone can restore the letter and reveal its contents.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|21|94|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What's this?

==Completion==
There were rumors that Daelin searched for [[Jaina Proudmoore|his daughter]] before his demise. If this letter is what I think it is, this is part of the reason we are at war.

==Notes==
The [[Warbringers|Warbringers: Jaina]] cinematic plays after turning in the quest.

==Patch changes==
