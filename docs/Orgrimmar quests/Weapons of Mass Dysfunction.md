==Objectives==
Inspect [[Hellscream Demolisher]]s until you find a faulty one, then teach its Chief Engineer a lesson.
* Faulty Demolisher Discovered
* [[Chief Engineer]] Disciplined

==Description==
<Glibbs mops sweat from his brow with a greasy handkerchief.>

Saurfang isn't happy with our work? This is very bad. My boys need to step it up.

Maybe you can help set an example. A set of Hellscream Demolishers just rolled off the blocks and are ready for inspection. Give them a thorough going-over, and if you find any problems, give the Chief Engineer a good thrashing. Remind them that the Horde is depending upon them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9}}
*12730 [[XP]]
*+250 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
You spoke with the Foreman?

Well?

==Completion==
Some lessons need be rough to be learned.

With this, our preparations are nearly complete.

==Notes==
Right-click on the Demolishers to inspect them.

First demolisher:
:{{text|say|Chief Engineer|Ready for inspection, sir!}}
:{{text|say|Chief Engineer|See that? Ironclad!}}
Second demolisher:
:{{text|say|Chief Engineer|This baby is all mine! I call her, "The Throttler."}}
:{{text|say|Chief Engineer|That's right. Takes a lickin' but keeps on kickin' butt!}}
Third demolisher:
:{{text|say|Chief Engineer|Ready for inspection! ...Be gentle.}}
:''The demolisher falls apart when inspected. The Chief Engineer cowers.''
:{{text|say|Chief Engineer|Uh oh. Um. Oops.}}
:{{text|say|Chief Engineer|Look, look, it's okay! It's just a tiny little glitch. See?}}
:{{text|say|Chief Engineer|A little paint and it'll be fine!}}
:{{text|say|Chief Engineer|It's still good enough to ship. I can fix it with a patch!}}
:{{text|say|Chief Engineer|I ...  I never wanted to be an engineer anyways.}}
:{{text|say|Chief Engineer|I always wanted to be... a dancer! Power tools frighten me.}}
:{{text|say|Chief Engineer|I can float. On my toes. I'm like a butterfly. Wanna see?}}
''Right-click on the goblin to punish him, kicking him away! Workers go to repair the Demolisher right away.''
:{{text|say|Goblin Siegeworker|We'll get right on this, sir!}}
:{{text|say|Goblin Siegeworker|Yes sir! Right away, sir! }}
:{{text|say|Goblin Siegeworker|We're on it!}}
''If the goblin goes unpunished...''
:{{text|emote|Chief Engineer takes off running.}}

<Garrosh laughs.>

Instilled a little discipline in them, did you? Good, good!

Everyone pulls their weight in my Horde, from the smallest peon to the proudest warrior. I tolerate nothing less.

Our preparations for the invasion are almost complete.
