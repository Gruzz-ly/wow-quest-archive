==Objectives==
Acquire 15 [[Silithus Venom Sample]]s and 20 gold and bring them along with a set of [[Dungeon Set 1]] Bracers to [[Mokvar]] in [[Orgrimmar]].
* [[Silithus Venom Sample]] (15)
* [[Dungeon Set 1]] Bracers
* Required money: {{cost|20}}

==Description==
Hail, <class>! I can tell by your demeanor that you've seen and done much in this world. Yet I'm willing to wager you haven't seen a piece of armor like this.

Perform a small favor for me and I'll be willing to trade it to you for an ordinary set of bracers.

I'm in need of a sizeable sample of venom drawn from the [[spider]]s and [[scorpion]]s that inhabit [[Silithus]]. Bring this to me along with a few gold coins and I'll perform the exchange. 

==Rewards==
You will receive (depending on class):
* Druid: [[Feralheart Wristguards]] or [[Feralheart Bands]] or [[Feralheart Bindings]] or [[Feralheart Wraps]]
* Hunter: [[Beastmaster's Bracers]] or [[Beastmaster's Bindings (Season of Discovery)]]
* Mage: [[Sorcerer's Bindings (Season of Discovery)]]
* Priest: [[Virtuous Bracers (Season of Discovery)]] or [[Virtuous Wraps]]
* Rogue: [[Darkmantle Wristguards]] or [[Darkmantle Bracers (Season of Discovery)]]
* Shaman: [[Bindings of The Five Thunders (Season of Discovery)]] or [[Bracers of The Five Thunders]] or [[Bands of The Five Thunders]] or [[Wristguards of The Five Thunders]]
* Warlock: [[Deathmist Bracers (Season of Discovery)]] or [[Deathmist Bindings]]
* Warrior: [[Bracers of Heroism (Season of Discovery)]] or [[Wristguards of Heroism]]

You will also gain:
*6,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you obtained the items I require, <name>? 

==Completion==
Ah, yes. [[Mux Manascrambler|Mux]] will be quite happy with this.

Those bracers were part of a larger armor set.  If you're interested in providing me with further assistance,  I'd be willing to consider parting with the rest of it.

==Notes==
*You must hand in your [[Dungeon Set 1]] bracers to complete this quest. You will lose any enchantment that is on those bracers.
*If you have multiple sets of bracers (1 equipped, 1 in a bag) and turn in this quest, you will lose both sets of bracers. If you want to keep one for later, put one set in the bank.
