==Objectives==
[[File:Guests at Grommash Hold - Best friends.jpg|thumb|Dolly and Dot waiting outside Grommash Hold.]]
[[File:Guests at Grommash Hold - Baine's meeting.jpg|thumb|Baine meeting with Horde representatives.]]
Meet your guests within [[Grommash Hold]].

==Description==
<Name>, I've received word that a [[vulpera]] [[caravan]] has arrived at Grommash Hold. They wish to address the [[Horde]] and have requested your presence.

I'm afraid it is not the best time for guests, so please see them as soon as you are able.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm glad you've come, <name>.

You should be the first to hear what we have to say.

==Notes==
Head to Grommash Hold. [[Dolly]] and [[Dot (alpaca)|Dot]] can be found waiting outside the hold next to a vulpera wagon.

Inside, Kiro, [[Meerah]], and [[Nisha]] are observing a meeting between [[Baine Bloodhoof]], [[Commander Dresh]], [[Bladeguard Sonji]], and [[First Arcanist Thalyssra]].
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|[[Vintner Iltheux|Our vintner]] refuses to work with the staff you have provided.}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Sonji|[[Zuldazar]] requires additional forces along de coast!}}
:{{Text|say|Commander Dresh|Work at the outpost has halted. How should we proceed?}}

Talk to Kiro to continue.
