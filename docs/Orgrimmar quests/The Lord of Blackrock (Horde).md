==Objectives==
Return the Head of Nefarian to [[Eitrigg]] in [[Orgrimmar]].
*[[Head of Nefarian#Horde]] (provided)

==Description==
The old feeling returns. The welcome pangs of victory reverberate throughout your being. Before you lies the monolithic, battle scarred head of [[Nefarian]]. Return it to the [[Warchief]]'s advisor Eitrigg, champion.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 14300 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
* +500 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]
* +500 reputation with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]
* +500 reputation with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]
* +500 reputation with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
I wish I could have seen the look on the beast's face when you struck the killing blow!

==Completion==
Once more you have honored the Horde, <name>. The son of [[Deathwing]] is dead.

Surely, the evil one stirs!
