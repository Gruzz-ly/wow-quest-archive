==Objectives==
Speak with [[Magar]] in [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
A [[sayaad]] male is known as an [[incubus]]. A creature of profound evil and singular mind. The [[demon]] must be lured into [[Azeroth|our world]] with an item of enticement - an object that represents great love and devotion. If you trust a blind man to lead you, <name>, then listen. East from the [[Cleft of Shadow]], along the main [[drag]] of Orgrimmar, lives Magar. He longs for the return of his mate, [[Krilge]]. Seek him out. He'll ask you to search for something precious. That is the key which you must bring to [[Gan'rul Bloodeye|Gan'rul]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 390 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Who told you about Krilge? Have you come with any news? You better not be toying with me...
