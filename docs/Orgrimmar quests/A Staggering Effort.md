==Objectives==
Slaughter a Stag north of Orgrimmar and use it's eye as bait to catch a Sandy Carp in the Valley of Wisdom. Return to Razgar in the Valley of Honor once you are done. 

*[[Sandy Carp]]

==Description==
I've fished sandy carp in Orgrimmar's local water's for years now. Recently, I have noticed my bait is not working as well as it used too. I suspect it has something to do with all the tauren that moved into the Valley of Wisdom.

I spoke with one of their local fisherman and it just turns out their appetite has changed. They are biting on stag eyes these days. You should be able to find plenty of stags north of Orgrimmar, just outside the northern gate. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|74000}} (or {{coppercost|132300}} on lvl 85)
+2 [[Fishing]]
{{itembox|You will also receive:
|Bag of Shiny Things}}

==Progress==
Did the eye work as bait? 

==Completion==
Outstanding!  Those sandy carp are picky eaters aren't they? 

==Notes==
This quest is a requirement for the achievement [[Fish or Cut Bait: Orgrimmar]].
