This daily quest requires 475 [[Jewelcrafting]].

==Objectives==
Cut three Jagged Jaspers and give them to [[Marith Lazuria]] in [[Orgrimmar]].
*Jagged Jasper Cut (3)
*[[Jagged Jasper]] (3)

==Description==
I was supposed to receive a shipment of jasper from [[Azeroth Express]], but I just heard their ship crashed into some tiny island called [[Ogrezonia]]. I worry about the crew, as the giant female ogres on the island are rumored to perform horrible rituals on men who happen upon their island. My work must go on, though, and we need those gems. I've heard great things about your skill as a jewelcrafter - could you deliver three jagged jaspers by the end of the day?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|16|53|ijt=1}}

==Progress==
Have you brought me the gems I need? 

==Completion==
Your work is as good as it is rumored to be!

==Notes==
You need to actually cut the 3 gems ''while on this quest'' to complete it.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
