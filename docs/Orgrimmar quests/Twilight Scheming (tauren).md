==Objectives==
Use the Glowing Torch to destroy 8 copies of The Twilight Creed in the [[Domicile]] of [[Blackrock Depths]].
*Copies of [[The Twilight Creed]] burned (8)
*[[Glowing Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
In Blackrock Depths, [[Twilight's Hammer]] has started to persuade the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Irons]] to strengthen their alliance and wage a campaign of conquest.

We have to act before the cultists can whip up the bloodlust in the Dark Irons and their leadership. Perhaps the best way to deal with this is to destroy the material the cultists are distributing to the dwarves.

I want you to go into Domicile portion of Blackrock Depths and use this torch to burn the books that the Twilight's Hammer is distributing there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|10|70}}
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]
*[[Crown of the Earthmother]]

==Completion==
We can only hope that the confusion and distrust you have created enables us to keep our enemies divided.

==Progression==
#[[Journey to Orgrimmar (tauren) (2)]] (optional)
#[[Twilight Scheming (tauren)]]
