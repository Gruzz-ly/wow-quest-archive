==Objectives==
Locate [[Herezegor Flametusk]] at the Wyvern's Tail inn within the [[Valley of Honor]] in [[Orgrimmar]], and obtain a Twilight Highlands Coastal Chart.
* [[Twilight Highlands Coastal Chart]]

==Description==
The [[Warchief]] has designs to launch an all-out assault on the [[Twilight Highlands]]. Once there we hope to ally with the [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw orcs]].

Through my own sources I've discovered that a Dragonmaw orc resides here, in Orgrimmar. He is known as Herezegor Flametusk, and once he commanded legions of their warriors.

His insider knowledge is precious to us. Find Flametusk and obtain for us a chart of the Twilight Highlands waterways.

Last I hear, Flametusk was washed up at a bar in the Valley of Honor...

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Blade-Dodging Girdle
|Hauberk of Shock
|Awestruck Bracers}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|9}}
*12730 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
<Sauranok is surprised to see you back so soon.>

Ah, <class>, you return. What have you discovered?

==Completion==
<Sauranok seems uninterested in the map as you relate your story.>

Twilight Assassins followed you to the bar? Here, in Orgrimmar?

The Warchief won't be happy about this.

Continue your preparations for the invasion and I will investigate.

==Notes==
;Entering the inn
:{{Text|emote|You sense that you are being followed...}}

;Speaking with Herezegor
:What's this <class>? You know my name?

:Do you know, then, of my reputation?

:I am Flametusk of the Dragonmaw clan. I commanded legions, flew on dragonback, witnessed the sundering of Grim Batol...

:Curse the Twilight's Hammer, and curse their ogre lapdogs. Look at me now. All talk and cheap liquor. 

:{{gossip|The Dragonmaw can be great again. Help our conquest of the Twilight Highlands - can you give me a map?}}

:{{text|say|Herezegor Flametusk|I will help, but know that you're stepping into a vipper's nest. Let's me draw you a map - wha - behind you!}}
:{{text|say|Twilight Nightblade|Cover the door - we've got him!}}
:{{text|say|Gravy|Oh no not de bar! Take it outside, mon!}}
*{{text|say|Herezegor Flametusk|You fight without honor and die like vermin!}}
*{{text|say|Herezegor Flametusk|Feel the bite of the Dragonmaw!}}
*{{text|say|Herezegor Flametusk|Twilight scum.}}
*{{text|say|Herezegor Flametusk|Another worm driven to the ground.}}
:{{Text|emote|Herezegor Flametusk motions for you to speak with him again.}}

;Speaking with him again
:So, Twilight's Hammer is trying to finish me off? Honorless filth!

:I will definitely help you, <class>. You say you need a map?
:{{gossip|Yes, a map of the coastal approaches.}}
:{{text|emote|Herezegor Flametusk scrawls out a depiction of his home port on a torn parchment.}}
:{{text|say|Herezegor Flametusk|There you have it, <name>. All the safe approaches to the Twilight Highlands. Unleash havoc on our foes!}}

;Final gossip
:What are you still doing here, <class>?

:Shouldn't you be in Twilight Highlands laying waste to that wretched cult?
