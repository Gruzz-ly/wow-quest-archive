==Objectives==
Purchase a Foam Sword Rack from [[Blax Bottlerocket]] in [[Orgrimmar]]'s [[Drag]]. Then return your ward to the [[Orgrimmar Orphanage|Orgrimmar orphanage]] by speaking with [[Orphan Matron Battlewail]] in The Drag.
* [[Foam Sword Rack (common)]]

==Description==
You have been so very kind to me, <name>. I never dreamed that I'd have so much fun during [[Children's Week]]. Thank you.

I wish all the orphans were lucky enough to get to see all the stuff we did. Do you think we find Blax Bottlerocket again and get a foam sword rack from him? I think he's still pushing that cart up and down the main road in the Drag. That way, everyone else at the orphanage could do something fun too!

After that, it'll be time for me to go home.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Piglet's Collar]]
*[[Rat Cage]]
*[[Turtle Box]]
*[[Snail Shell]]
*[[Pet Care Package]]
*[[Curmudgeon's Payoff]]
*[[Well-loved Figurine]]

==Progress==
It is a pleasure to see you again, <name>. Have you attended to the duties you've volunteered for during Children's Week?

==Completion==
May the spirits bless you, <name>. You've done more for Grunth than most would ever think of doing for him. Thank you - you're the epitome of what it means to be a hero of the Horde.

The orphans will love your gift; it's not often that they get a new toy.

Grunth had so much fun with you, <name>.  He wanted to give you one of his favorite pets to remember him by.
