==Objectives==
Go to [[Shadowfang Keep]] and obtain Godfrey's Crystal Scope, 5 bundles of Moontouched Wood, and 5 Deathless Sinew.
*[[Godfrey's Crystal Scope]]
*[[Moontouched Wood]] (5)
*[[Deathless Sinew]] (5)

==Description==
You have picked up the ways of the [[hunter]] quickly, <name>. Your skills have made you a credit to the [[Horde]] and an example to the younglings.

As a reward for your progress and hard work, the [[Garrosh Hellscream|warchief]] has commissioned his personal bowyer to create a unique weapon.

The cursed Shadowfang Keep in [[Silverpine Forest]] is the only place to get the materials we'll need. Travel there and retrieve the scope from [[Lord Godfrey]]'s gun, a supply of moontouched wood, and sinew from the [[ghoul]]s and [[geist]]s infesting the keep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2,300 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*[[Bow of the Great Hunter]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the materials I'll need for your weapon?

==Completion==
I'm honored that the warchief chose me to craft a weapon for you, <name>. With such exotic materials, it will be a very fine bow.

==Progression==
