It is a wonder any of our troops survived that bloodbath on the [[Broken Shore]]. If not for [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Lady Sylvanas]]...

[[High Overlord Saurfang]] has been asking for you at [[Grommash Hold]]. He will not say why... but he was insistent that I send you to him.

==Progress==
Dark days are upon us.

==Completion==
You have served the Horde well in the past, <name>.

More will be asked of you... much more.

;Traveling
:''The [[adventurer]] travels from the docks at the [[Dranosh'ar Blockade]] to reach the Hold. Along the way are seen [[Concerned Citizen|concerned citizens]] of [[Orgrimmar]], [[Denizen of Undercity|Undercity denizens]], [[Citizen of Kezan|Kezan citizens]], [[Sen'jin Villager|Sen'jin villagers]], [[Thunder Bluff Native|Thunder Bluff natives]] and [[Silvermoon Citizen (Legion)|Silvermoon citizens]] -- some of them crying.''

:''Upon reaching Orgrimmar, it is obvious that something is ''very'' wrong. The merchants, bankers, soldiers... everyone is watching and waiting outside Grommash Hold. Varok Saurfang is waiting as well, in front of the closed doors to the Hold.''

;Sylvanas - initial gossip
{{Dialogue|
Broken Shore was just the beginning. The Alliance will retaliate. Given the opportunity, they will strike when we are weak.
}}

;Cinematic
:''Sylvanas proceeds to walk further into the room, the hold doors closing behind her while Vol'jin has a coughing fit. Vol'jin begins to speak.''
:'''Vol'jin''': {{text|bossemote|Windrunner. Come... forward.}}
:''Sylvanas moves closer to the throne.''
:'''Lady Sylvanas Windrunner''': {{text|bossemote|Warchief.}}
:'''Vol'jin''': {{text|bossemote|Da [[Loa]] spirits say death will claim me soon.}}
:'''Lady Sylvanas Windrunner''': {{text|bossemote|In the end, death claims us all.}}
:''She pauses before continuing.''
:'''Lady Sylvanas Windrunner''': {{text|bossemote|But the Horde will live on.}}
:'''Vol'jin''': {{text|bossemote|I have never trusted you. Nor would I have ever imagined... in our darkest time... dat you... would be da one to save us. Da spirits have granted me clarity. A vision... dey whisper a name. Many will not unda'stand. But you must step out of da shadows... and lead. You must be... War...chief...}}
:''Vol'jin dies. Sylvanas remains standing at her spot as Vol'jin's covered body is later taken away on a stretcher by Baine and Lor'themar. The scene then changes to Vol'jin's lit funeral pyre outside a night-time Orgrimmar, with Sylvanas facing the pyre.''
:'''Lady Sylvanas Windrunner''': {{text|bossemote|Vol'jin is dead.}}
:''She then turns to face the people of the Horde.''
:'''Lady Sylvanas Windrunner''': {{text|bossemote|Who among you will help me avenge him?}}
:''They roar their assent and break into shouts of "for Vol'jin" and "for the Horde!"''

;Durotar
:''Many have gathered at the Dranosh'ar Blockade just outside Orgrimmar to pay their final respects to Vol'jin. The leaders of the Horde and their advisors are presents, [[guard]]s and unnamed citizens from each Horde capitals are numerous, standing on their feet or on their racial mounts. Many trolls from [[Sen'jin Village]] are especially here, and among the crowds several [[shadow hunter]]s are as well. [[Sen'jin Spirit Drummer]]s and [[Ceremonial Watcher]]s are preparing the ceremony. [[Tyrathan Khort]], Vol'jin's human friend, is hidden among the nearby hills to pay his respects, and an [[Illidari]] delegation led by [[Allari the Souleater]] is also present.''

:''At the front of Vol'jin's burning funeral pyre stands Sylvanas, with Lor'themar on her left and Baine on her right, and Gallywix to her far right. [[Nathanos Blightcaller]] and Sylvanas' [[dark ranger]]s are providing protection.''

;Sylvanas - after
{{Dialogue|
So, the famed <class> from the Broken Shore has returned.

These are dire times. I have need of a hero with your skills.

What say you? Will you help avenge [[Vol'jin]]? Will you drive the Legion from our lands?

{{gossip|For blood and honor, Warchief!}}
}}
::{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|I accept your pledge of loyalty, <name>. The Horde endures!}}
::{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Indeed it shall.}}
::{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Well, said!}}

If the player is a [[warlock]], Sylvanas says the following instead. The gossip option is unchanged:

{{Dialogue|
So, the famed <class> from the Broken Shore has returned.

Your deeds have earned you leniency from my bow, but do not press me. As you can imagine, there is much I must address now that I am Warchief.

We will speak later. You can wait.
}}

It is also possible to head back to Orgrimmar for additional dialogues and extra ambience.

==Trivia==
*A bug can occur which causes Sylvanas to act is if the player is a warlock, regardless of their actual class, when turning in the quest.
*During the duration of the quest, Orgrimmar is phased twice, before and after Vol'jin's death. During the first phase, various inhabitants are seen gathered in front of [[Grommash Hold]] in the [[Valley of Strength]] facing High Overlord Saurfang. After his death, majority of NPCs in the other city districts reflect his passing and the naming of the new Warchief, with guards and other inhabitants slightly moving their positions, offering various remarks, crying and some are even absent.
