This daily quest requires 475 [[Jewelcrafting]]

== Objectives ==
Cut three [[Timeless Nightstone]]s and give them to [[Marith Lazuria]] in [[Orgrimmar]]. 

== Description ==
I'm trying to impress this trade ship captain Lila. I've been working on a necklace to match her lovely purple hair, but the gems have gone missing! They were there when I was showing them off to my good friend Bonder last evening. We were drinking moonshine and I blacked out - when I woke up the gems were gone! They must have been darn good thieves, because Bonder didn't see anything.

Her ship is coming in tonight, and I really need three nightstones to get her present done. Help me out here! 

== Rewards ==
{{cost|16|53|ijt=1}}

== Completion ==
Thanks!  I'm sure to beat out that Isabela Jones in Stormwind with these!  I can't wait to see the look in her beautiful eye when I give this to her.

==Progression==
Have you brought me the nightstones? 

== Notes and trivia ==
*You need to cut the 3 gems ''while on this quest'' to get credit for them.
*Lila and Bonder are references to Leela and Bender from ''{{wp|Futurama}}''.

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
