==Description==
Before the [[Plague of Undeath|plague]] turned me, I was a merchant of some importance in [[Andorhal]]. The town likely interred my former wealth and family records in Sorrow Hill Crypt when they thought me gone.

Would you be kind enough to retrieve my possessions from the crypt and return them to me?

==Progress==
Have you returned from the [[Plaguelands]]?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. You say you found a journal?

==Progression==
