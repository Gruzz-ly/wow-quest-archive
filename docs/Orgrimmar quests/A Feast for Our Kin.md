==Objectives==
Meet [[Baine Bloodhoof]] at [[Thunder Bluff]] in [[Mulgore]].

==Description==
Ah, the Highmountain tauren. They have been our allies ever since we felled the Legion.

Are you interested in hearing how they joined the Horde? It is quite the tale!

It all began with Baine Bloodhoof and Mayla Highmountain. Baine was hosting a great feast in Thunder Bluff to welcome the Highmountain tauren...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Welcome, <name>.

Mayla speaks of you as a trusted ally. Your presence will surely help convince her of the merits of joining the [[Horde]].

==Notes==
;Upon acceptance
:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Chieftain Bloodhoof, have our champion join you for your feast in Thunder Bluff. By the time dessert is served, I want their oath of loyalty to the Horde.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|It shall be so, Warchief.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|This way!}}
:''Baine salutes, leaves the building, mounts a wyvern, and flies away.''

For the duration of the quest, Thunder Bluff is phased. Regular NPCs are not present, and only [[Bluffwatcher]]s patrol the mesas. Fireworks are present. High Rise has several NPCs partying. Mayla, [[Ebonhorn]], and [[Hamuul Runetotem]] are standing with Baine having a discussion.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Thank you for coming, Mayla. It is my honor to welcome you to Mulgore.}}
:{{Text|say|Mayla Highmountain|Your invitation was most kind, Baine. It is time for our two peoples to renew our bonds of kinship.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|It is of kinship that I wish to speak. I hope that--}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Spiritwalker?!}}
:{{Text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|I should never... have left... the mountain...}}
:{{Text|say|[[Uul'gyneth]]|The wards have weakened! He will be ours!}}
:{{Text|say|Mayla Highmountain|Ebonhorn! What dark force grips you?}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|I know this power all too well. Champion! We need your help!}}

;Description
We have planned a great feast to welcome the [[Highmountain tauren]] to Thunder Bluff. It will be their first visit to the lands of [[Kalimdor]]. I have been exchanging missives with [[Mayla Highmountain|their chieftain]]... I look forward to meeting her.

Will you join us in Mulgore? It would be good for them to see a familiar face that aided their fight against the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].
