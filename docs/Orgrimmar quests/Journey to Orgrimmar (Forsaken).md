==Description==
A messenger just asked me to pass along an invitation. It is from the [[priest trainer]], Martin Goodchilde, at The Barracks in Orgrimmar.

He asks that you meet with him at your soonest convenience. The Barracks can be found within the [[Valley of Honor]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 150 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
There you are, <name>. I was beginning to think my message hadn't found you.

==Pre-''Shadowlands'' version==
;Description
{{Rfg-section|9.0.1}}
I just received a message from Dark Cleric Cecille in Orgrimmar. She requests that you join her in the audience chamber in Grommash Hold, where you can find her with the delegation from [[Undercity]]. The cleric didn't mention the purpose of your visit, but it is clearly important. Make haste, <name>.
