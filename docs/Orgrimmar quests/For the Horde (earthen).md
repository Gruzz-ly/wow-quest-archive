==Objectives==
Meet with [[Ambassador Blackguard]] at the [[Orgrimmar Embassy]].

==Description==
For the first time in our history, the [[Azeroth|outside world]] is ours to explore and experience.

An off-island faction known as the [[Horde]] came to the aid of our kin. Spiritual and mighty, the honorable Horde has opened their hand to our people.

Will you be among the first to go where no earthen has ever gone? To walk their lands, hear their songs and learn from their people?

If that path calls to you, then I hope you'll return to share those experiences and show the earthen what the world has to offer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||2}}
* 180 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What's this then? An... earthen? I heard we might be seeing some of your people here.

Well, make yourself at home if you can.

We have plenty of rocks in this sweltering place, so I guess if that's your thing...you'll do just fine.

Just...don't eat the rocks. Do you even eat rocks?

Either way, welcome to [[Orgrimmar]].

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Foreman Uzjax|Your recalibrating of the Awakening Protocol has given this earthen something new. Something... different.}}
:{{text|say|Foreman Uzjax|A spark to experience. An impetus to live. I admit... I misjudged your efforts, Dawn.}}
:{{text|say|Dawn|All earthen deserve something more than what we were bound by, Uzjax. Including yourself.}}
:{{text|say|Foreman Uzjax|For once... I am inclined to believe that.}}
