Completing this quest (to get the mint) is required in order to complete [[Hallow's End Treats for Spoops!]]

==Objectives==
Do a flex emote at [[Innkeeper Gryshka]], and in exchange you'll receive Orgrimmar Nougat!
*Flex for Innkeeper Gryshkas

==Description==
That's an... interesting costume you have on.  Even though you're being nice and helping a sick child trick-or-treat this year, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you perform a trick for me!

Let's see... you look so strong and buff in that... costume... let's see you flex!  Yes, go on now and flex for me, strong <man/woman>!

When and only when you flex, I'll give you some tasty Orgrimmar Nougat.  It's a great Hallow's End treat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Orgrimmar Nougat]]

==Progress==
No candy until you flex for me, <name>...

==Completion==
You are truly mighty, haha! &nbsp;Well done, and thanks for being such a good sport. &nbsp;Here's your candy.

Happy Hallow's End, <name>!
