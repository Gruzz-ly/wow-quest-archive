==Objectives==
Go to [[Shadowfang Keep]] and obtain Silverlaine's Enchanted Crystal from [[Baron Silverlaine]], 5 bundles of Moontouched Wood, and 5 Ghostly Essence.
*[[Silverlaine's Enchanted Crystal]]
*[[Moontouched Wood]] (5)
*[[Ghostly Essence]] (5)

==Description==
All of your trainers agree, <name>, you show an amazing amount of talent for a journeyman. Even the [[Garrosh Hellscream|warchief]] has heard of your rapid progress.

As a reward for mastering your studies, the warchief has commissioned his master [[enchanter]] to create a staff for you.

The cursed Shadowfang Keep in [[Silverpine Forest]] is the only place to get the materials you'll need. Travel there and find a [[magic]]al heirloom of the Silverlaine family, a supply of moontouched wood, and the essence of the [[ghost]]s haunting the keep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2,300 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*[[Staff of the Arcane Path]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the materials I'll need for your weapon?

==Completion==
Ah, you must be the [[mage]] that [[Uthel'nay]] mentioned. I've heard tales about the artifacts the Silverlaine family once kept, but I haven't ever seen one. This should make an excellent focus for your staff. Let's get started.

==Progression==
#[[An Audience with Feenix Arcshine]] (optional)
#[[Mastering the Arcane (Horde)]]
