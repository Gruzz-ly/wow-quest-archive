==Objectives==
Report to [[Sylvanas Windrunner]] in [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
We have raised new [[Champion (rank)|champions]] for the [[Horde]], established footholds on [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]] [[Kul Tiras|soil]], and stolen one of their [[Abyssal Scepter|precious artifacts]].

We hold greater power and sway over our enemies than we have before.

Sylvanas has great plans for our Horde, <name>. I will allow you the pleasure of reporting our victories to her personally.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Core]] (800x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Completion==
<Name>. [[Nathanos Blightcaller|Nathanos]] has been updating me on your progress throughout your efforts.

The [[Alliance]], and the Kul Tirans, shall tremble before the might of my Horde.

==Criteria of==
*[[Ready for War#Horde]]

==Notes==
:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|The [[Azeroth|world]] is full of soldiers, champion. But few truly have the stomach for war. You, it seems, have a genuine taste for it.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Though victory still eludes us, it draws closer every day. We must not rest until the last flicker of hope in the [[Anduin Wrynn|boy-king's]] heart turns to ashes.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|[[Kul Tiras]] has become a rallying point for the [[Alliance]]. The return of its [[Kul Tiran fleet|vaunted navy]] has emboldened them. But soon those tide-born curs will pay the price for defying us.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|You embody the best of the [[Horde]], <name>. I know that you will be the spark that sets [[Boralus]] ablaze.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|For the Horde!}}
