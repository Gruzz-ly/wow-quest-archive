==Objectives==
Speak with Nathanos.
* Speak with [[Nathanos Blightcaller|Nathanos]]

==Description==
Now that we have put our house in order, it is time to purge the filth before our gates.

How thoughtful of those traitors to gather themselves in one place, so that we may slay them all in one fell swoop.

Let us end this pitiful rebellion.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I have orders for you from the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Dark Lady]]. She instructed me to deliver them on her behalf, should things play out this way.

==Notes==
Speak with Nathanos:

:Look at them, <name>. Weak. Pathetic. Small minded.

:I am almost moved to pity.

:{{gossip|I am ready. For the [[Horde]]!}}

Then the [[Reckoning]] cinematic plays:
