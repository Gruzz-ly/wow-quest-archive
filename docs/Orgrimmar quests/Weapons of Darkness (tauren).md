==Objectives==
Capture 5 Elemental-Imbued Weapons from [[Anvilrage]] [[Dark Iron dwarf|dwarves]] in [[Blackrock Depths]], then break them over the [[Black Anvil]] in [[Shadowforge City]].
*[[Elemental-Imbued Weapon]] broken (5)

==Description==
Blackrock Depths has long been home to our enemies, but now the [[Shattered Hand]] has discovered that the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Irons]] and [[Twilight's Hammer]] are increasing their collaboration. Using the cult's knowledge, the Dark Iron dwarves are imbuing their weapons with [[elemental]] powers. They've outfitted the Anvilrage legion with these fearsome new weapons.

I want you to go into Blackrock Depths and gather the weapons from the Anvilrage dwarves there and break them over the Black Anvil in the heart of Shadowforge City.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Helm of the Sunwalker
|Faceguard of the Sunwalker
|Headguard of the Sunwalker
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|10|70|}}
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
We must destroy those weapons before they are used against us, <name>.

==Completion==
Without those weapons, the Dark Irons will never be a match for the [[Horde]]. You have served your brothers and sisters well this day, <name>.

==Notes==
*Despite the {{g|Sl}} changes, the quest is still offered by [[Sunwalker Atohmo]] but not turned in with him.

==Progression==
#[[Meet with Avaros Dawnglaive]] (optional)
#[[Weapons of Darkness (tauren)]]
