==Objectives==
Use the Glowing Torch to destroy 8 copies of The Twilight Creed in the [[Domicile]] of [[Blackrock Depths]].
*Copies of [[The Twilight Creed]] burned (8)
*[[Glowing Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
The influence of [[Twilight's Hammer]] grows within Blackrock Depths. They have allied with the [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron dwarves]] and seek to convince them to strike outside [[Blackrock Mountain|the mountain]].

We must destroy the instruments of the Twilight's Hammer agitation. Their influence over the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Irons]] must be minimized.

I want you to go into Domicile portion of Blackrock Depths and use this torch to burn the books that the Twilight's Hammer is distributing there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|10|70|}}
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]
*[[Crown of Forsaken Faith]]

==Completion==
This will not dissuade Twilight's Hammer, but perhaps it will increase the suspicion between them and the Dark Irons.

==Progression==
#[[Journey to Orgrimmar (Forsaken) (2)]] (optional)
#[[Twilight Scheming (forsaken)]]
