==Objectives==
Discuss [[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]]'s fate with [[Lady Sylvanas Windrunner]] in [[Orgrimmar]].
* Listen to Sylvanas

==Description==
I have asked you here to discuss a matter of great importance to the [[Horde]].

Varok Saurfang is no longer in [[Stormwind]].

Let us discuss this turn of events.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I trust your discretion in this matter.

==Completion==
I hope you understand how grave of a situation this is, champion.

The [[Alliance]] will surely kill him on sight. Some members of the Horde consider him a traitor for his willing surrender at the [[Battle for Lordaeron]].

If Varok Saurfang is to make it back to us alive, it will be up to you. Be discreet.

==Notes==
Speak with Sylvanas:
{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|
My guards have secured the door.

Now let us discuss your assignment.
