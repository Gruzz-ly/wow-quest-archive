'''For the Queen''' is the alternative quest in the Fate of Saurfang questline made available only if players choose to side with [[Sylvanas]] during the interaction with [[Zekhan]] after the completion of [[Tracking Tipoff]].

==Objectives==
Meet with [[Lady Sylvanas Windrunner]] in [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
<You chose not to side with the traitor Saurfang and his [[Jungle troll|troll]] [[Zekhan|lackey]].

Now that you know where [[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]] is, and who is with him, you should report to Sylvanas to see if she has any further orders.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Glowing Azerite Geode]]
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Your loyalty will not go unrewarded, champion. [[Dark Ranger Lyana|Lyana]] departed here only moments ago.

I have dispatched the [[dark ranger]] and a contingent of loyal [[deathguard]] to apprehend the traitor Saurfang in [[Swamp of Sorrows]].

He may come peacefully, or he may not. Your hands should not, in any case, be bloodied in this confrontation. You are to remain a hero, golden in the eyes of the people, as we have need of.

And as for that [[Zekhan|troll]] you mentioned, I have special plans for him.

==Notes==
[[File:I Will Not Betray My Warchief.png|thumb|"I will not betray my Warchief, troll."]]

This quest is obtained by choosing the "I will not betray my Warchief, troll." dialogue option [[Zekhan]] offers instead of accepting the [[Grim Tidings]] quest.
