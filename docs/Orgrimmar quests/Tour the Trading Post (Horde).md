==Notes==
In the tunnel of the Gates of Orgrimmar, a [[Trading Post Barker]] advertises the new venue:
:{{Text|say|Trading Post Barker|Hey Friend! Come check out our new items in the Trading Post, we just got a new shipment!}}

Next to [[Grommash Hold]] in the [[Valley of Strength]] is the [[Trading Post]].

Next to [[Zen'kala]] is the [[Collector's Cache]] to obtain 100 [[Trader's Tender]]. For subsequent visits each month, it contains 500 Trader's Tender for free.

Behind is [[Gothal]], the Stable Keeper:
:The Trading Post gets fresh goods every month.

:The mounts that are stabled here can be purchased this month!

:Next month we will have a new selection of good to display and for you to purchase.

On the right is Zaa'je:
:Whoa! These outfits and weapons are somethin' else!

:Every month Zen'shiri Trading Post gets new stuff and displays them here.

The [[Trading Post Post]] is next to Shiri:
:Welcome to the Zen'shiri Trading Post! 

:Every month our goods and your activities and activity points are refreshed. 

:Make sure to check the Collector's Cache to collect any tender that you have earned.

:<The scroll continues on with more detail on various topics.>

:{{Gossip|<Read the section about "Goods">}}
::Every month we get a new shipment of goods to trade with brave adventurers.

::You can see many examples of the goods we have to offer on display around the trading post.

::If you've got the tender, we've got the latest fashions, faithful companions, and steadfast mounts!

:{{Gossip|<Read the section about "Activities">}}
::Every month a new selection of activities will be available to the bravest adventurers. 

::We've done our best to make sure whatever types of adventures you like to do, you'll find an activity for it. You may also see that some of the activities are based on a theme!

::<Open the Traveler's Log in the Adventure Guide to find this month's activities.>
:{{Gossip|<Read the section about "Purchasing">}}
::Purchasing from the Trading Post could not be simpler, provided you have accrued enough tender.

::If you see an item you like but you don't have enough tender you can "freeze" it.

::A frozen item will not rotate out when we get our new monthly shipment. We will hold it for you as long as you like!

::This opens the Trading Post interface, which shows how the player character looks while astride the mount, with the companion pet, or wearing the armor or weapon.

Speak with Zen'kala:
:Welcome to Zen'shiri Trading Post!

:{{Gossip|I'd like to see what you have to offer this month.}}

On complete:
:{{Text|say|Shiri|Take a look at the Collector's Cache. We tucked a few more tender inside as a thank ya.}}
