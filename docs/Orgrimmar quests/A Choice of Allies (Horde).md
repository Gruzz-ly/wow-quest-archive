==Description==
As ambassador, it is my duty to bolster the [[Horde]]'s ranks and strengthen our numbers in the face of danger.

Your adventures have led you to many different people who can aid the Horde if we can convince them to join our cause.

I've kept a record of the most promising potential allies. The choice of which to approach first is yours.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||2}}
*180 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is there a problem with my notes?

==Completion==
As the one who inspired our allies to fight beside us, I believe it should be you who reaches out to invite them into the Horde. I entrust the task to you.

If you like, I can also recount how our existing allies came to join the Horde.

==Notes==
Inspect the racial banners behind Ji to complete the objectives, then speak to him again.

;Description
:I have called upon those gathered here to suggest potential allies to fortify our ranks. Each of them knows what is needed to keep the [[Horde]] strong.
:
:You have proven to be a formidable champion, <name>. I put it to you to choose which course we pursue.
:
:Hear what they have to say and make your decision. Tell me your choice and we will proceed with our plan to strengthen the Horde.

;Completion: I have come to value your wisdom, <name>. The choice you make today will strengthen the Horde.

;Notes
[[Rokhan]], [[Baine Bloodhoof]], [[Lady Liadrin]], and [[Eitrigg]] are gathered before [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]]. [[Trade Prince Gallywix]], [[Nathanos Blightcaller]], and [[Ji Firepaw]] idle at the edges of the room.

{{dialogue|title=Baine Bloodhoof|
We share much with the [[Highmountain tauren]]. It is my belief that they would make ideal allies in the time to come.

{{dialogue|title=Lady Liadrin|
<name>, I am glad you are here. We must convince the warchief to pursue an allegiance with the [[nightborne]].

{{dialogue|title=Eitrigg|
The Horde needs allies. This is true.

But to be worthy of a place here, those we recruit must have honor in their hearts. If they lack it, their presence only diminishes us.

{{dialogue|title=Rokhan|
I spent a good deal of time with [[Princess Talanji]] and de [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] in [[Nazmir]] and beyond. I be hoping to seal de deal and bring them into de Horde, where we can best help one another.

At long last, the ceaseless posturing between the Horde and the Alliance is coming to an end.
