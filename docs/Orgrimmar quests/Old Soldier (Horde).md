==Objectives==
Honor [[Varok Saurfang|High Overlord Saurfang]].
* Speak with [[Lor'themar Theron|Lor'themar]] to begin honoring Saurfang

==Description==
No matter what anyone says, he was an honorable [[orc]]. A legend in his own right, the ideal to which all [[warrior]]s of the [[Horde]] aspired.

He gave his life to heal the rift in the Horde and give us the chance to forge a new path forward. His was more than a death befitting a warrior. It was the death of a hero.

We shall honor his sacrifice.

==Rewards==
You will learn: {{abilities|Battlefield Commendation|icon=inv_scroll_11|id=311724}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,800 [[XP]]
*You will also be rewarded with [[Worn Cloak (toy)]] if you decided to help Sylvanas at first (and got 500 AP) but now changed your mind to help Saurfang.

==Completion==
He will be buried in [[Nagrand]], as he would have wanted.

I do not know what lies ahead for the Horde, but I know we will face it together.

==Notes==
Speak to Lor'themar:
{{Dialogue|
[[Thrall]] awaits us within [[Orgrimmar]]. We will take this moment to honor Saurfang before we regroup. [[N'Zoth]] is now our primary concern.

Should we survive the Old God's machinations, we will then turn our attention to those of [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]].

A cutscene plays, with the Horde forces assembled outside [[Grommash Hold]] in the [[Valley of Strength]], along with [[Anduin Wrynn]], [[Jaina Proudmoore]], [[Valeera Sanguinar]], and [[Master Mathias Shaw]]. The player character stands next to [[Zekhan]] and [[Baine Bloodhoof]]. Saurfang's body lies on a slab, as Thrall speaks.

:{{Text|say|Thrall|Saurfang inspired all of us to strive for true honor. And his legacy will live on in our deeds.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|When the Alliance and Horde marched on [[Ahn'Qiraj]], it was Saurfang who valiantly commanded our combined forces.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Today, his courage saved thousands of lives... on both sides of the battle.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|His sacrifice will never be forgotten.}}
:''Thrall rests a hand on the slab.''
:{{text|say|Thrall|You have earned your warrior's death, old friend.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Now, greet your son... with honor and glory.}}
:''Thrall salutes Saurfang, and Zekhan blows a war horn as the assembled Horde all kneel. Anduin, Shaw, and Valeera all depart through a portal opened by Jaina to Boralus.''

Speak to Thrall to complete the quest, which awards the "Veteran of the Fourth War" title and completes the achievement [[The Fourth War#Horde]], concluding the [[Horde War Campaign]].

On completion:
:{{text|say|Thrall|Saurfang and I spoke much of honor and the Horde. Of our path forward from this crossroads.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|I never thought we would have to walk it without him. It falls to us to decide what the Horde will become.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Azeroth needs our strength now more than ever. Grieve for Saurfang, and make ready to defend the world he died for.}}

===Leader dialogue===
;[[Thrall]]
:Years ago, I spoke at [[Orgrim Doomhammer|Orgrim]]'s funeral after he died [[Hammerfall|liberating our people]]. Today, I did the same for Saurfang.
:[[Safe Haven|We don't get to hide]]. That was the last lesson he ever taught me. But I have been away from Orgrimmar for a long time, and much has changed since I last walked upon its walls.
:I don't know how best to serve the Horde. But I will fight for it to the bitter end.

;[[First Arcanist Thalyssra]]
:I only knew Saurfang for a brief time, but I respected him for his courage. It is not easy to challenge [[Elisande|your leaders]], even when you are [[Nightfallen rebellion|in the right]].
:He saved many lives today. If we survive against [[N'Zoth]], we will all owe our future to his sacrifice.

;[[Zekhan]]
:Saurfang...
:I knew dis could happen, dat tings could be playin' out dis way... but dat don't make it any easier.
:He always been a hero ta me. Inspirin' me ta be better, ta be stronger. Just like [[Hekazi|me fadda]].
:Spirits guide 'em both. I wonder if dey be watchin' me right now. Waitin' ta see who I become.
:It be time I made 'em proud, <name>. Never gonna rest 'til I do.

;[[Mayla Highmountain]]
:[[Highmountain tauren|My people]] are new to the Horde, and there have [[A Display of Power|been times]] in this war when I wondered if joining it was a mistake.
:But then I would think of Saurfang, and what he represented, of the Horde he fought for. That is the Horde my people joined. That is the Horde we must strive to be.
:I can think of no better way to honor his memory than by continuing that journey.

;[[Baine Bloodhoof]]
:Saurfang... were it not for his courage, [[Stay of Execution|I would have died]] at the hands of Sylvanas. It is a debt I can never repay, except by honoring his memory and carrying his legacy forward.
:The Horde cannot remain divided. We must reflect on all that we have endured and choose our next course of action with strength and wisdom... united as one.

;[[Gazlowe]]
:I hate funerals. Don't get me wrong, I respected Saurfang as much as the next guy. I just don't like standin' around when there's work to be done.
:We [[goblin]]s know how to pay our respects. We just don't overpay; you know what I'm sayin'?
:And you know what? I think ol' Saurfang would have agreed. I'm gonna miss him. But I ain't lettin' the job he started go unfinished.

;[[Overlord Geya'rah]]
:Sylvanas was a strong warchief. But she was not the Horde's warchief. Everything she did was for herself. Saurfang sacrificed everything he had for the Horde.
:Strength and honor. A true warchief must have both.
:That is a lesson I will never forget.

;[[Rokhan]]
:Never had a good feelin' about dis war, mon. I been followin' orders, tryin' ta make da best of a bad situation. But I always thought dat Sylvanas be havin' da Horde's best interests at heart.
:I was wrong. Shoulda trusted me instincts. Shoulda done more for Saurfang.
:Too late for dat now. Loa guide us, <name>. We gonna need it.

;[[Lor'themar Theron]]
:A part of me will always wonder if this would have happened had I acted sooner. If I had confronted Sylvanas in the early days of the war. If [[Teldrassil]] hadn't burned.
:It is not an easy thing to watch a dear friend tread a dark path, to recognize when they have gone astray. I thought I knew her, and Saurfang has paid the price for my error in judgment.
:I have tasked the [[Farstriders]] with tracking down both Sylvanas and [[Nathanos Blightcaller|Nathanos]]... though I am unsure we can find them at all. They were Farstriders themselves, once.
:But I cannot simply stand idle while they are out there. Not anymore.

;[[Lady Liadrin]]
:With Saurfang dead and Sylvanas... absent, Orgrimmar is without a warchief.
:Meanwhile, the threat of N'Zoth looms over us all. We mustn't allow Orgrimmar to descend into chaos.
:Remain vigilant for any signs of N'Zoth's influence... along with any who cling to Sylvanas's twisted ideals.
:Some who sided with the Banshee Queen have seen the error of their ways. They are to be left alone.
:I care not if you fought against them. We must forgive and unite if we are to remain strong in the face of peril.
