==Objectives==
Witness [[Kiro]]'s declaration to join the [[Horde]].
*Kiro's declaration witnessed

==Description==
Our caravan is ready to explore the world beyond the sands, but [[Nisha]]'s blade can't be our only defense against the dangers we know await us.

This is why we've come.

To declare our intent to join the Horde.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I am disappointed with his answer, but not surprised.

Our strength is often overlooked.

==Notes==
On accept, Kiro walks up to [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]]:
:{{Text|say|Kiro|High Chieftain Bloodhoof. I am Kiro, and I speak for the [[vulpera]] of [[Vol'dun]]. We seek to join the Horde.}}
:{{Text|say|Kiro|Long have we survived amidst the sands, without a thought of what lies beyond them. But the Horde has shown us that there is more to life than mere survival.}}
:{{Text|say|Kiro|If you'll have us, we would explore the world by your side.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Though I am honored by your request to join us, I am afraid that I must decline.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Meeting the needs of our current allies has stretched the Horde thin. It would be unwise for us to take your people under our wing.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|But please, enjoy the hospitality of [[Orgrimmar]] as our guests. Horde or not, the vulpera will always be welcome here.}}
:{{Text|say|Kiro|I understand. Thank you for your time, High Chieftain.}}
:''Kiro bows and walks back to his previous position.''

Afterward, Baine has some new gossip text:
:I never like turning anyone away, but I could not agree to add to our ranks when so many within the Horde are struggling.

...as does [[Meerah]]:
:Why don't the Horde want us?

...as well as [[Nisha]]:
:So we'll need to prove ourselves to the Horde? That shouldn't be a problem.

Talk to Kiro again to turn in.
