;Speaking to Lady Sylvanas
:Too many of our [[Horde navy|navy]]'s ships were destroyed either by the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] or by the Alliance. I have our dockmasters working overnight, but we need more.

;Speaking to Nathanos (before the objective to speak to him pops up)
:The Dark Lady has called us together for an important mission. There will be no room for failure.

;Speaking to Nathanos
:We have rescued Princess Talanji of the [[Zandalari]] from the [[Stormwind Stockade|stockade]] in [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]].

:Her boat is on its way to [[Zandalar]], but the Alliance dogs are in pursuit.

:We need the might of the Zandalari navy in order to win this war. The Alliance cannot be allowed to capture the princess again.

:We will travel by air to provide assistance, and then ensure the Zandalari join the Horde.

:Come.

:{{Gossip|I'll make my way to a wyvern to rendezvous with Princess Talanji's boat.}}
:''Nathanos bows to Sylvanas and walks away.''

;Speaking to Warlord Breka again
:The taste of our victory on Exile's Reach will be short-lived. We must now turn our attention to the war.

:{{gossip|I have received my orders. I must go.}}
