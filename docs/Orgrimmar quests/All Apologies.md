==Description==
This could be the end of me... Perhaps my actions were not thought out as well as they should have been...

The good news is that we pushed back an attack that would have otherwise meant the end of [[Splintertree Post|Splintertree]]. Let us pray that [[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]] sees it that way.

I am certain to be summoned to Orgrimmar to explain my actions.

Please, <name>, go ahead of me and present this letter to his advisor Eitrigg.

Do what you can to soften his heart towards me.

==Rewards==

*{{cost||3|50}}
*435 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
This woman, Draaka, needs to mind her step. She plays with powers she cannot possibly understand.

<Saurfang studies you for a moment.>

This Durak, I sense foul things about this one, and my instincts are rarely wrong."
