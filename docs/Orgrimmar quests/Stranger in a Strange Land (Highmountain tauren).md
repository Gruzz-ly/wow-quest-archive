==Objectives==
Talk to [[Chronormu|Chromie]].

==Description==
Hi. I'm [[Ambassador Blackguard]].

I am honored to welcome you to [[Orgrimmar]], <race>.

<He smiles unconvincingly.>

As a lifetime of adventure unfolds before you, be assured that... uh...

You know what? I've been reading this same greeting all day. Enough's enough.

Talk to [[Chronormu|Chromie]] on top of the hourglass, then talk to your emissary. Run along.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|25}}

==Progress==
Not quite as beautiful as [[Highmountain]], is it?

==Completion==
So many [[tauren]]! I think I've seen more tauren since I got here than my entire life in Highmountain.

They all ask to touch my antlers. It's weird at first, but now I kind of like it.

==Notes==
;Completion
:{{text|say|Halian Shlavahawk|Good luck, <name>. As for me, I am going to test my skill in Ashenvale. For the Horde!}}

You know what? I've been reading this same greeting all day. Enough's enough.

Talk to [[Chronormu|Chromie]], she's on the hourglass, then talk to your emissary. Run along.
