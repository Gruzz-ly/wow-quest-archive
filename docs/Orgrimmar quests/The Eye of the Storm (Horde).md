==Objectives==
{{NPC||Farseer Krogar}} wants you to look into the Water of Farseeing.
*Vision of the Farseer Witnessed

== Description ==
Greetings, friend.

On behalf of the [[Earthen Ring]] I thank you for answering my call.

You are known to us by name, <name>.

Your exploits and accomplishments are many. [[Azeroth]] already stands in your debt, and yet again she is need of her heroes.

I am but a messenger. A familiar presence seeks audience with you.

Peer into the Waters of Farseeing and behold the fate of our world.

== Progress ==
Yes, <class>?

== Completion ==
Now that your eyes have seen the truth, where will you choose to serve?

== Notes ==
Clicking the bowl of water transports the player's view to the [[Maelstrom]], where [[Thrall]] is holding control of the chaotic swirl. Thrall also does a voiceover:
:"Citizen of Azeroth, behold.  Our world groans in agony, besieged by an adversary of unspeakable power.  As her lands break and crumble, the fractures that divide her people must be mended, for neither side can overcome this threat alone.  Join me, cast aside your prejudices.  Together, we must heal Azeroth's wounds, and those of her people."

==Progression==
