==Objectives==
Use Razgar's Fillet Knife to cut off a Drowned Thunderlizard Tail in Thunder Ridge, south of Orgrimmar. Once you have the tail, use it near a Golden Stonefish to kill it. Return to Razgar in the Valley of Honor once you are done. 
*[[Golden Stonefish]] (3)

Items provided:
*[[Razgar's Fillet Knife]]

==Description==
You heard of the golden stonefish, <name>? The thing with these fish is that they can't be caught by normal means. They have jaws so strong that they snap right though any hooks or lures you try to use on 'em.

You can find a number of them in thunder ridge, south of Orgrimmar. That ridge used to be full of thunder lizards, but they all drowned in the flood.

Take my knife, swim down there and cut off their tails. You should be able to use the tail to zap any stonefish you find. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}} (or {{cost|13|23}} on lvl 85),
+1 [[Fishing]] skill
{{itembox|You will also receive:
|Bag of Shiny Things}}

==Progress==
How did it go down there?  Any luck with the tails and the stonefish? 

==Completion==
Nice one, <name>!  I tell ya, golden stonefish are not easy to come by so this is a nice treat. 

==Notes==
This quest is a requirement for the achievement [[Fish or Cut Bait: Orgrimmar]].
