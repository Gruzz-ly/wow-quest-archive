==Objectives==
Talk to [[Orgrimmar]]'s wind rider master, [[Doras]].

==Description==
[[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]] is wise, and his intentions are good. In time, he will grow to see your people as a valuable ally.

I am awaiting reports about recent [[Alliance]] activity in [[Durotar]], but they haven't arrived yet. Would you be willing to visit [[Razor Hill]] and ask him for the reports in person? The easiest way to get there is by wind rider. Doras, Orgrimmar's wind rider master will let you use one of his wind riders for a small fee. Look for him on the rise north of the Valley of Strength.

==Rewards==
*85 [[XP]]
*+10 rep with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
So you need to get to Razor Hill in a hurry? That's no problem at all. One of my wind riders will get you there very quickly and it only costs a few coins to hire one.
