==Objectives==
Meet with [[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]] in [[Zuldazar]].

==Description==
You wish to hear how the [[Mag'har orc]]s joined the [[Horde]]? It may be one of the strangest ways we gained an ally!

It all began with a plan from [[Eitrigg]]. He had a fragment of the [[:Vision of Time]] that [[Garrosh Hellscream]] used to travel to {{Au|Draenor}}.

Chief Telemancer Oculeth believed there would be a way to go back to Draenor and get the Mag'har orcs to join the Horde.

This tale begins with a visit to Oculeth in Zuldazar...

==Completion==
<Name>, it is good to see you. I have been in need of an assistant to attune this fragment for some time now.

==Notes==
Travel to Zuldazar and find Oculeth in the [[Hall of Ancient Paths]], the portal room in [[Dazar'alor]].

;Description
We have in our possession a fragment of the [[:Vision of Time]] that was used by [[Garrosh Hellscream|Garrosh]] to travel to {{Au|Draenor}} years ago.

Chief Telemancer Oculeth believes that we can use it to go there once more and collect on our debt with the native orcs of that world.

We must meet with Oculeth in Zuldazar. He awaits our arrival with the fragment in hand.
