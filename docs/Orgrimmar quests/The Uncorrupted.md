On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Eitrigg]]|It is done. Overlord... this is Azeroth.}}
:{{text|say|[[Overlord Geya'rah]]|Mere moments ago, we were fighting for our lives on {{Au|Draenor}}. I never thought I would set eyes upon another world.}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|I felt the same, long ago. It can be... unsettling. I will do what I can to help you and your people.}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Before us stand the walls of Orgrimmar, capital of the [[Horde]].}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|There is no time to mourn what was lost. The Mag'har will make a new home. Here.}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|I will go with you now, Eitrigg, and have words with your warchief. Is it still [[Vol'jin|the troll]] that {{Au|Draka|my mother}} spoke of?}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Not any longer. I will explain...}}

Go to the [[Orgrimmar Embassy]] and turn the quest in to Sylvanas.

:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Our mission was successful, Warchief. Overlord Geya'rah has pledged her soldiers to the Horde.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Eitrigg has told me of your people's strength. I trust honor means as much to you as it does to him?}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Honor is everything to us! We do not make this oath lightly, Warchief.}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Eitrigg and your champion proved their courage and nobility. If they embody the heart of the Horde, then we will gladly fight beside them.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|I accept your loyalty, overlord. Your people are welcome within the gates of Orgrimmar.}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Draenor has fallen, but we will make a new home on Azeroth. Your enemies are now our enemies!}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|For the Horde!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|For the Horde!}}
