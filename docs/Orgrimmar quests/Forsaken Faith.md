==Objectives==
Go to [[Shadowfang Keep]] and obtain the Commander's Holy Symbol from [[Commander Springvale]], 5 bundles of Moontouched Wood, and 5 Ghostly Essence.
*[[Moontouched Wood]] (5)
*[[Ghostly Essence]] (5)
*[[Commander's Holy Symbol]]

==Description==
You have been a diligent student and servant to our cause. Always use your talents in accord with [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Lady Sylvanas's]] wishes and you will be blessed by the [[Void|shadow]].

Our queen has arranged for [[Orgrimmar]]'s master [[enchanter]] to create a powerful staff to recognize your service.

The materials you will need only come from Shadowfang Keep in the heart of [[Silverpine Forest]]. Find the lost holy symbol of Commander Springvale, a supply of moontouched wood, and the essence of the [[ghost]]s that haunt the keep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2,300 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*[[Staff of Forsaken Faith]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the materials I'll need for your weapon?

==Completion==
[[Dark Cleric Cecille]] mentioned that you were visiting Shadowfang Keep to find the materials for your new staff. I see now why she sent you there. Even the twisted magics gripping the keep could not extinguish the power of these items.
