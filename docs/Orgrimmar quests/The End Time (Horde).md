==Objectives==
Speak with [[Nozdormu]] at the [[End Time]].

==Description==
Nozdormu, the bronze aspect, has asked for help from the champions of the [[Horde]]. You are on his short list. I can share few other details.

It is uncharacteristic of my master to request the assistance of mortals, but I suppose that all things change with time... even the Aspect of Time himself.

He awaits you at the End Time, in the distant future. I can help you to travel there, if you so choose.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|1|65|50}}
*6,940 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>, you have arrived. This is good. I apologize for bringing you to this strange place, and under such suspicious circumstances.

I have a good reason for doing so.

We are going to kill Deathwing. And I require your aid.

==Progression==
#[[The End Time]]
#[[Murozond (quest)]]
#[[The Well of Eternity (quest)]]
#[[In Unending Numbers]]
#[[The Vainglorious]]
#[[The Path to the Dragon Soul]]
