Archmage Khadgar, hero of the [[Second War]], is assembling a coalition of [[Azeroth]]'s strongest to bravely step through the Dark Portal and stop the [[Iron Horde]]'s invasion of Azeroth.

Champions who are interested in glory can meet Khadgar at the base of the Dark Portal in Blasted Lands.

Safety not guaranteed.

*{{cost|5|70}}
* 6850 XP

==Completion==
Looks to me like we ended up in the right place.

==Notes==
Go to the {{Horde}} [[Pathfinder's Den]] / {{Alliance}} [[Wizard's Sanctum]] portal room and speak with the mage to be teleported to the [[Shattershore]] camp.
;Speaking with the Vanguard Battlemage
:What is it, <name>?

:{{Gossip|I must help Khadgar. Send me to the Blasted Lands!}}

Go to the Dark Portal crater to speak with Khadgar.

;Speaking with Khadgar
:<The archmage focuses intently on the portal.>
:Look. Their numbers are abating, however briefly. This may be our chance.
:Are you prepared to face whatever's on the other side of that portal?
{{gossip|''FOR AZEROTH!''}}

A second check appears:
:You are about to embark on a dangerous mission, and you may not be able to return immediately. Are you sure?

After hitting accept, cinematic plays:
:'''Archmage Khadgar''' {{text|bossemote|This is our chance. Storm the portal!}}

At expansion release, a projection of Khadgar was located in Stormwind's [[Trade District]], Orgrimmar's [[Valley of Strength]], and the [[Shrine of Seven Stars]] and the [[Shrine of Two Moons]] in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]], which acted the same way as the one in Blasted Lands. This was a means to easing server stress by spreading out the questers and not having all the level 90s of a realm suddenly show up in one spot. This also resulted in obtaining [[Warlords of Draenor: The Dark Portal (Blasted Lands)|a new version of the quest]].

Possessing this quest blocks access to quests in the [[Iron Horde Invasion! (Horde)]] chain. You can either drop this quest to finish the Blasted Lands quests, or complete the quest chain through the Tanaan Jungle and then return to the Blasted Lands to complete the quest chain there.
