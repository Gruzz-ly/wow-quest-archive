==Objectives==
Go to [[Shadowfang Keep]] and obtain the Commander's Holy Symbol from [[Commander Springvale]], 5 bundles of Moontouched Wood, and 5 Ghostly Essence.
*[[Commander's Holy Symbol]]
*[[Moontouched Wood]] (5)
*[[Ghostly Essence]] (5)

==Description==
Your skills have grown and you are now ready to become a full [[seer]]. You have completed your early training with skill and dedication.

To mark this occasion, the [[warchief]] has commissioned his master [[enchanter]] to create a staff for you.

The cursed Shadowfang Keep in [[Silverpine Forest]] is the only place to get the materials you'll need. Travel there and find the lost holy symbol of Commander Springvale, a supply of moontouched wood, and the essence of the [[ghost]]s that haunt the keep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2,300 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*[[Staff of the Earthmother]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the materials I'll need for your weapon?

==Completion==
[[Seer Liwatha]] mentioned that you were visiting Shadowfang Keep to find the materials for your new staff. I see now why she sent you there. Even the twisted magics gripping the keep could not extinguish the power of these items.

==Progression==
