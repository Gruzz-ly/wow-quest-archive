==Objectives==
Complete "The Stormwind Extraction" scenario.
*Take a [[Blightcaller's Easy Death|potion]]
*Transport from the Ramparts taken
*"The Stormwind Extraction" scenario complete

==Description==
My lady is shrewd indeed. If we are to infiltrate [[Stormwind City]], we will need the very best the [[Horde]] has to offer, and yet a team so small as to be able to infiltrate the heart of [[Alliance]] territory unseen.

<Nathanos peers at the gathered group, stroking his chin.>

Yes, I see.

The path ahead is clear. Speak to me when you are ready to undertake the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Warchief's]] mission, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|58|20|}}
*24,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must not fail the Warchief.

==Completion==
Well, here we are. [[Zuldazar]]. We had better stick with [[Talanji]] and [[Zul]] for now. The Warchief will be interested to know what happens next.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|I have a potion for each of you. Don't drink it just yet.}}

Alts can choose to speak with Nathanos again to skip the scenario:
{{Dialogue|
I need not stress the importance of this mission, <name>. The Dark Lady is depending on us to enact her will.

{{Gossip|I have heard this story before. (Skip the Scenario and teleport to The Great Seal in Zuldazar)}}
}}

Players who wish to continue, pick up the potion, [[Blightcaller's Easy Death]]:
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|My queen has seen to everything. Our transport awaits us on the ramparts.}} (removed in ''Shadowlands'')
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Let's move out.}}

[[Deathguard Malcolm]] and [[Deathguard Sansa]] join the party. Go near the [[Bank of Orgrimmar]] (pre-''Shadowlands'': the Gates of Orgrimmar) where [[Lasan Skyhorn]], [[Aviash]], and [[Skyhorn Eagle]]s await.
:{{Text|say|Lasan Skyhorn|These war eagles will carry us to our destination. Ready to go? Then climb aboard!}}

Hop on a war eagle to begin the scenario:

===Stage 1: In the Dead of Night===
*Description: Infiltrate Stormwind City.
*Infiltrate Stormwind City

:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Listen closely. We will not be in contact once we've entered Stormwind.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|You, [[Thalyssra]], and [[Rokhan]] will infiltrate the [[Stockades]] and extract the prisoners.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Our scouts have located a hidden entrance. The tauren and I will cover your escape.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|I have supplied each of you with an easy death. If you find yourself out of options, use it.}}
:''The party flies past a Zandarli ship in the slip.''
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|There's our way out. Get to that [[Rezan's Wake|ship]] once you have the prisoners.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|I'll find you. Good luck.}}
:''Upon arriving at [[Lion's Rest]], Nathanos breaks off and the team flies to the Sewer Access Gate.''

===Stage 2: Down the Drain===
[[File:WorldMap-StockadeScenario.jpg|thumb|Stockades world map.]]
*Description: Open the sewer access gate.
*Enter the Stockades
*Open the Sewer Access Gate

If you move out of the area and attack guards, Thalyssra will teleport you to back to the sewer gate.
*{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Are you trying to draw attention to us?}}
*{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Stay focused, <name>.}}
*{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Stay close, friend. We do not want to risk discovery.}}

Interact with two [[Padlock]]s to open the Sewer Access Gate. Rokhan and Thalyssra jump down. Follow them to enter the [[Stormwind Stockade]].

===Stage 3: The Stockades===
*Description: Infiltrate the Stockades.
*Meet up with Rokhan
*Follow Thalyssra

Upon arriving, Rokhan kills a [[7th Legion Enforcer]] and Thalyssra blasts a [[7th Legion Sharpshooter (Stockade)|7th Legion Sharpshooter]]. Rokhan goes to pick the cell door lock.

:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Da 7th Legion be here. Whoever we breakin' out, da humans not be takin' chances.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|I be goin' on ahead ta find da prisoners. Watch me back.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|We will draw their attention. Be careful.}}
:''Rokhan sneaks away.''

Start clearing a path alongside Thalyssra. Several [[Jailed Thief|Jailed Thieves]], [[Incarcerated Troublemaker]]s, and [[Imprisoned Thug]]s can be seen. Make it to the center of the dungeon to catch up with Rokhan.

Looking at a locked [[Cell Door]], Rokhan quickly delegates:
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|You bettah be taking dis.}}

He also has gossip:
{{Dialogue|
I think you best be taking this.
}}

===Stage 4: Honor and Loyalty===
*Description: Release High Overlord Saurfang.
*Open Saurfang's Cell Door
*Release Saurfang

Interact with the Cell Door to unlock it. Then speak with Saurfang:
{{Dialogue|
You think you are here to take me back to Orgrimmar. Back to the warchief. You are mistaken.

{{Gossip|What do you mean?}}
}}
:{{Text|say|High Overlord Saurfang|I have lost track of the time I have sat in this cell. But it matters not in the end.}}
:{{Text|say|High Overlord Saurfang|After all she has done, I will never return to her Horde.}}
:{{Text|say|High Overlord Saurfang|Make sure you know the difference between loyalty and honor.}}
:{{Text|say|High Overlord Saurfang|And pray that you never have to choose.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|You not be comin' wit' us.}}
:{{Text|say|High Overlord Saurfang|We both know you are not here for me. Those you seek are down the hall.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|I see... If you are certain, High Overlord.}}
:{{Text|say|High Overlord Saurfang|I am. Lok'tar.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Come, <name>. Dis way.}}
:''Saurfang remains in his cell, while Rokhan and Thalyssra return to the main hall.''

===Stage 5: The Primary Objective===
*Description: Release the prisoners and escape the Stockades.
*Release the other prisoners
*Escape the Stockades

Rokhan and Thalyssra run to face the remaining guards. Once they are dead, the group moves to the cell containing [[Zul the Prophet]] and [[Princess Talanji]].
:{{Text|say|Zul the Prophet|Ah, our escort arrives. Just as I said, Princess.}}

Interact with the Cell Door to break the lock.
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|Hmm... Thank you. My Prophet tells me you are allies.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Hahaha, naw naw naw, mon. I be knowin' you. You be dat snake dat--}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|We have come on behalf of the Horde. I am Thalyssra, and this is Rokhan.}}
:{{Text|say|Zul the Prophet|Greetings will have to wait.}}
:{{Text|say|Mage-Commander Lyra|Lock it down!}}
:''[[7th Legion Battlemage (Stormwind Stockade)|7th Legion Battlemage]]s and [[Mage-Commander Lyra]] teleport in, stunning the group for a second and pacifying them. Additionally, they conjured magic barriers to prevent escape.''
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Dat be some nasty voodoo. Thalyssra?}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|It is a [[Anti-magic|nullification field]]. I cannot cast!}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Bah! Follow me, den!}}
:''The group moves back to the dungeon's crossroad where they are cornered by barriers. Thalyssra looks to the north side, Rokhan to the west side, and Zul and Talanji to the eastern side.''

Join them in the hall:
:{{Text|yell|First Arcanist Thalyssra|We need to move!}}

Follow them to the center of the hall:
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|How do we get out?}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Dis way!}}
:{{Text|say|Zul the Prophet|Dat would be a mistake. It is de other way.}}
:''The group starts facing the eastern side.''
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|You best be right, Zul.}}
:''Talanji blasts the barrier on the eastern side with a spell, breaking the pacification.''

Start attacking the battlemages and other guards, clearing to the eastern end of the stockade. In the next intersection, Mage-Commander Lyra teleports in:
:{{Text|yell|Mage-Commander Lyra|You will go no further!}}

Start attacking:
:{{Text|say|Mage-Commander Lyra|No one catches the 7th Legion unawares. Die, Horde filth!}}

On her death:
:{{Text|say|Mage-Commander Lyra|Someone... stop them...}}

Enter the last room, where a trapdoor provides Stormwind Sewer Access:
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|It smells... unpleasant.}}
:{{Text|yell|Rokhan|Where dis be leadin'?}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Out, if the troll is to be believed.}}
:{{Text|say|Zul the Prophet|By all means, waste more time discussing it.}}

Interact with the [[Stormwind Sewer Access]] to continue.

===Stage 6: The City Stirs===
*Description: Escape Stormwind City undetected.
*Follow Rokhan

Rokhan used his power of Blind Eye, calling a [[Loa]] to stealth the group, much like a rogue's [[Shroud of Concealment]]. Keep in the circle, close to him during the duration. Avoid [[Stormwind Guard (Stormwind City)|Stormwind Guards]], [[Stormwind Knight (Stormwind City)|Stormwind Knights]], [[D.R.O.N.E.]]s, [[Town Crier (Stormwind City)|Town Criers]], and even King [[Anduin Wrynn]] himself!

:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|The city is stirring. We cannot linger here for long.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|I be keepin' us hidden, long as no one does anyting stupid.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Just give da word, <name>.}}

If you leave, Rokhan will summon you.
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|What I say about doin' something stupid?}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Get back here, mon!}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Ya tryin' ta get us killed?}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Don't be gettin' us caught, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Ya got a death wish, <name>?}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Gah! Don't be runnin' off!}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Stay focused, <name>.}}

Nearby [[Stormwind Citizen]]s and a Stormwind Guard also have dialogues
:{{Text|say|Stormwind Guard|I cannot allow anyone to pass. King's orders.}}
:{{Text|say|Stormwind Citizen|Let me through at once! I demand to speak to your superior.}}
:{{Text|say|Stormwind Citizen|What's with all this racket? Do you know how late it is?}}
:{{Text|say|Stormwind Guard|No harm will come to you or your family. Return to your home immediately.}}
:{{Text|say|Stormwind Citizen|Please, my daughter lives in the Trade District. I need to go to her!}}
:{{Text|say|Stormwind Guard|I have already told you everything I know. Go back to your homes.}}
:{{Text|say|Stormwind Citizen|What is happening? Why is the gate closed?}}

Talk to Rokhan to begin moving:
{{Dialogue|
We gotta get out of here. I kin help us sneak past all dem guards.

Let me know when you be ready to go.

{{Gossip|Let's go.}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Alright. Stay close. We all friends now.}}
:''Walking up a bit, a town crier appears, stopping the group.''
:{{Text|say|[[Crier Goodman]]|Attention, citizens of Stormwind!}}
:{{Text|say|Crier Goodman|Horde infiltrators have breached the Stockades! Civilians are to remain in their homes until the threat has been subdued!}}
:{{Text|say|Crier Goodman|By order of the king!}}
:''Once the crier finishes, he leaves and the group continues. They stop for a bit when more D.R.O.N.E.s pass by.''
:{{Text|say|Zul the Prophet|Wait here.}}
:{{Text|say|Zul the Prophet|Continue.}}
:''Another town crier, looking for intruders, appears, and the group moves to a building, then they continue. [[SI:7 Operative (Stormwind City)|SI:7 Operatives]] are also present.''
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Move quick, off da path.}}

:{{Text|say|Stormwind Guard|How do you think they broke into the Stockades?}}
:{{Text|say|Stormwind Guard|Can't have been easy. Keep your eyes peeled.}}
:{{Text|say|Stormwind Guard|Is there anything that Windrunner cur would not try at this point?}}

:''They move to a side when the robots appear.''
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Let's cross at da bridge. Unless ya prophet be havin' a problem wit' dat.}}
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|Do not worry, we will know if his life is in danger.}}
:''The group moves to the bridge.''
:{{Text|say|Zul the Prophet|Jump off de bridge. Now.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Eh?}}
:{{Text|say|Zul the Prophet|NOW.}}
:''The group jumps into the water, avoiding Anduin Wrynn who is personally on duty to protect his people, flanked by his [[Stormwind Royal Guard (NPC)|Stormwind Royal Guards]] and [[Stormwind Cleric (Stormwind City)|Stormwind Clerics]]. He stops on the bridge.''
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Remain alert. [[SI:7]] has informed us that the enemy emerged near the Keep.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|They cannot have gone far. Your vigilance safeguards us all.}}
:''Anduin leaves, and the group moves.''
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|A little more warnin' woulda been nice.}}
:{{Text|say|Zul the Prophet|Clearly you did not need it.}}
:''The group emerges from water.''
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|We not be stoppin' again 'till we get to da docks. Say when ya be ready, <name>.}}

Speak with Rokhan again:
{{Dialogue|
We not gonna last much longer at dis pace. We got tah run for deh docks.

Say de word an' we go.

{{Gossip|I will be right behind you.}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Let's go. Stay together.}}
:{{Text|say|Stormwind Citizen|I'm scared...}}
:''The group continues through the bridge to Cathedral District.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Wait... where are the guards?}}
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|Zul is not soiling himself. It may be nothing.}}
:{{Text|say|Zul the Prophet|Well, not nothing.}}

===Stage 7: WAY Behind Enemy Lines===
*Description: Escape Cathedral Square.
*Defeat the worgen ambush
*Escape Cathedral Square

Thalyssra conjured up a barrier that deflects the attacking [[Gilnean Mauler (Stormwind City)|Gilnean Maulers]]. Talanji and Rokhan also attack the worgen. If Talanji is killed, Rezan brings her back to life.

:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|There are too many... the barrier will not hold!}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Kill dem before dey get through!}}
:''[[Genn Greymane]], who harbors a deeply seated hatred for the Horde, along with [[Gilnean Battlemage]]s and [[Gilnean Shieldwall]]s appear. Nearing them will result in death.''
:{{Text|yell|Genn Greymane|I have found them, my king! I will bring you their hides for a trophy!}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Da old wolf got our scent. We got ta get outta here!}}

Defeat the Gilnean Maulers throwing themselves against Thalyrssra's shield. Once the maulers are defeated, the magic barrier is down and the group begins to run, no longer stealthed. Genn and his party will continuously walk toward the group. If he catches up, everyone will die.

:{{Text|yell|You are mine!}}
:{{Text|yell|Let this old wolf show you his teeth!}}
:{{Text|yell|Grown a spine, have you? Hah!}}

Keep killing interlopers.
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|Look out!}}
:{{Text|yell|Genn Greymane|Scurry, like the rats you are!}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|We need to find cover!}}

Onward, a town crier drops [[Abandoned Torch|his torch]], and Zul picks it up:
:{{Text|say|Zul the Prophet|Well now, dis will be useful.}}

Keep moving.
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|We gotta get back to da canals. Follow me!}}
:{{Text|say|Zul the Prophet|You will want to wait here.}}
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|What is it now?}}
:''The path to [[Stormwind Harbor]] is blocked by [[Jaina Proudmoore]] who has not forgotten the crimes the Horde has committed against her and her people. She has a frozen aura around her and casts an ice wall to block the way into the harbor.

Approaching Jaina will also result in a quick death.
*{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|I think not.}}
*{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|Not today.}}
*{{Text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|Pathetic.}}

Continue with the group.
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I have known the Horde to be cruel and heartless; ruthless in its pursuit of victory. But this...}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|This is folly. You will die here, and an unmarked grave will be all you have to show for it.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|We cannot fight her. Run!}}
:''The group begins to move to the cemetery, with Genn and his group still behind them.''
:{{Text|yell|Genn Greymane|Look at them flee, tails between their legs!}}
:''[[Stormwind Battlemage]]s teleport to the entrance of the cemetery and attack the group:''
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Dey be tryin' ta box us in. Don't let dem corner us!}}
:{{Text|say|Zul the Prophet|One would think dat a city of stone would be less... flammable.}}
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|You are a cruel enemy, Zul.}}
:''Zul drops the torch and sets a building ablaze. Soon it spreads, blocking the path. The group keeps running.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|The harbor! We must press forward!}}
:''Nathanos Blightcaller and his two Deathguards appear on the platform leading down to the harbor. Nathanos fires arrows at guards and knights charging at the group. Jaina stands on the opposite side of the platform, shooting numerous frostbolts on the ground.''
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Well this is a fine mess we're in.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Don't be actin' like you not happy to see us.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Delighted. Truly. Now, let's move. On your mark.}}

Speak with Nathanos to continue:
{{Dialogue|
Good. You have managed to make a sleeping city very, very angry.

Let's not waste time pointing fingers, shall we?

{{Gossip|I'm ready.}}
}}

===Stage 8: No Diplomatic Solutions===
*Description: Evade the wrath of Lady Jaina Proudmoore
*Escape Jaina's wrath
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Watch your step. It seems the Alliance's consummate diplomat will not be taking prisoners this time.}}

The group heads down to the harbor. Zul burns a banner. They stop by the lion statue as the path is blocked by Jaina's ice walls.

:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|That is far enough!}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|She has cut off our escape!}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Stop gawking and break through that ice!}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|You will not harm another soul in this city!}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Die, Horde scum!}}

The [[Icy Barrier]] is attackable, so start breaking it.
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|My loa hears us. Mighty Rezan, lend me your strength!}}
:''Talanji casts a spell to shield the group from Jaina's frostbolts. An image of [[Rezan]] appears to break the ice.''

===Stage 9: The Harbor Run===
*Description: Get to Talanji's ship in Stormwind Harbor.
*Reach Talanji's ship

:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Let's move!}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|I don't be knowin' a Rezan, but I be owin' him my thanks.}}

Once the wall is destroyed, continue with the group to the main section of the Harbor filled with [[Dwarven Rifleman|Dwarven Riflemen]], [[Gnomish Gyro-Engineer]]s, [[Teldrassil Sentinel (Stormwind City)|Teldrassil Sentinels]], [[Exodar Peacekeeper (BfA)|Exodar Peacekeepers]], Gilnean Maulers, Stormwind Knights, and Stormwind Battlemages.

:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Their forces must have returned from Lordaeron. How will we get through?}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Already taken care of. Observe.}}
:''Nathanos sets off a bomb, destroying the siege engines in the area. Most of the gathered forces move to fight the fire.''

Continue following the group, clearing a path to the docks. As the party approaches the pier, Zul holds short:
:{{Text|say|Zul the Prophet|Wait here.}}
:''Lasan and the eagles fly above, taking most of the defenders on the pier.''
:{{Text|say|Lasan Skyhorn|Hahahaha!}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Aha! Lasan ya clever moose-mon!}}
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|I need twenty of those birds.}}

Continue to the end of the pier. Jaina and her [[Mageguard Elite]]s are there.
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Are they not pursuing us?}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|No... but I think I know why. Look.}}

===Final Stage: Fate's Cold Logic===
*Description: Escape Stormwind Harbor on Talanji's Ship.
*Escape Stormwind Harbor

:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|You have slain many innocents to get this far. But your little jailbreak is over.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Surrender, and I will return you to the Stockades where you belong. There, you will await the king's justice.}}
''Jaina roots the group with a Frost Nova and starts walking towards it.''
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|Respectfully, we have a boat to catch.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Then perish.}}
:{{text|say|Zul the Prophet|Do not be so hasty, now.}}
:{{text|say|Zul the Prophet|You can try to subdue us, and likely succeed.}}
:{{text|say|Zul the Prophet|But do you have time to waste?}}
:''The camera pans around, revealing most of Stormwind Harbor is aflame!''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|No... it can't be.}}
:{{text|say|Zul the Prophet|Seems a mage of your... skill... could be very useful right now, hm?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|This isn't over!}}
:''Jaina, vexed, teleports away with her mageguards. The group starts boarding the ship. Lasan and his eagles also arrive.''
:{{Text|say|Rokahn|Loa help dem dat cross ya, Zul.}}
:{{Text|say|Zul the Prophet|I believe de phrase you be looking for is "thank you."}}
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|Come. We set sail for Zuldazar.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|I think not. I have orders to return you to the warchief directly.}}
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|Seeing as how this is my ship, I think you will need to adjust your plans.}}
:{{Text|say|Zul the Prophet|We can discuss it on de way, your highness.}}
:''Thalyssra casts a spell to block [[Stormwind Cannon|cannon]] fire. Alliance soldiers come to the pier, attacking the ship while Rokhan and the two Deathguards defend it.''

Speak with Talanji to continue:
{{Dialogue|
Regardless of what your warchief wants, I must return to my people. We are going to Zuldazar, as dis is my ship and dis is your only way out of Stormwind.

Do you have a problem with dat?

{{Gossip|Not at all.}}
}}

An ending [[Battle for Azeroth in-game cinematics|cinematic]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|Gc3045fMI9w}}

:''The Horde extraction team sails on Talanji's ship to Zandalar.''
:{{text|bossemote|Nathanos Blightcaller|It appears the Alliance dogs have lost our scent.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Zul the Prophet|Good, good. Our journey is almost over.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Nathanos Blightcaller|I hope the Warchief's faith is well-placed.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Zul the Prophet|She seems very powerful. Certain. In control.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Nathanos Blightcaller|It is an honor to serve my queen.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Zul the Prophet|My princess is also strong willed and sure of herself. Our king has always found her to be... challenging.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Princess Talanji|Oh mighty Rezan...as always, you come when I ask your aid.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Rezan|Speak and I will listen.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Talanji|I have sought the aid of the Horde, but my father may not agree with my actions. Advise! You are the loa of kings.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Rezan|My eyes see much... They see your boldness, your power, and enemies who fear both. And those who seek your demise are here!}}
:''The Alliance fleet is closing in on the Horde ship. Talanji walks out onto the top of the deck and casts a mighty spell, summoning Rezan! The dinosaur then charges towards the Alliance fleet, mowing them down. As the ship moves closer towards the shores of Zandalar, the Zandalari fleet can be sighted in the distance and Talanji gives the signal for the fleet to open fire on the Alliance.''
:{{text|bossemote|Princess Talanji|We are home.}}

===Finale===
On the other side of the cutscene, the party arrives at the [[Port of Zandalar]] in [[Zuldazar]]. Talk to Nathanos to finish the quest.

Talanji offers the followup, [[Welcome to Zuldazar]].

:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|[[Tze'na]]! Hello, little girl. Did you miss me?}}
:{{text|say|Princess Talanji|Come, champion of de Horde. Let us pay my father a visit. Zul... we will speak later.}}
