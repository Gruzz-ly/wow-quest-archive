==Objectives==
Speak with [[Scooty]] in [[Booty Bay]].

==Description==
As soon as we got word from [[Kernobee]] about the new [[Gnome|gnomish]] rig, Scooty and I began work on the [[Transpolyporter]] 6000: The fastest and most reliable way to [[Gnomeregan]].

It's finally ready for passengers to board, <name>. If you want to give it a try, go to Booty Bay and talk with Scooty at the [[wind rider]] roost. To get to Booty Bay, take the boat from [[Ratchet]].

Of course, you could always try and make the run to Gnomeregan through the [[dwarf]] infested mountains of [[Dun Morogh]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*320 [[XP]]

==Completion==
She's a beauty, isn't she? Pinnacle of [[goblin]] transport [[technology]] -- only exploded a dozen or so times.

Don't worry, <name>, I've got her all fixed up. She won't blow up on you - and if she does, it'll be quick and painless.
