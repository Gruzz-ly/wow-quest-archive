==Objectives==
Kill 6 Fireguard Destroyers and recover the General's Attack Plans from [[General Angerforge]] at the [[West Garrison]] in [[Blackrock Depths]].
*[[Fireguard Destroyer]] slain (6)
*[[General's Attack Plans]]

==Description==
The [[Shattered Hand]] believes that the [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron dwarves]] and [[Twilight's Hammer]] are working together. There's evidence that they are preparing a joint attack from within [[Blackrock Mountain]]. We can't allow such a force to depart Blackrock Mountain.

You must go into Blackrock Depths and capture the Twilight's Hammer attack plans from General Angerforge in the West Garrison. Eliminate the [[elemental]]s Twilight's Hammer has provided to support his forces.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Faceguard of the Horde
|Headguard of the Horde
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|10|70|}}
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
We cannot afford to allow the Dark Iron dwarves to ally with Twilight's Hammer.

==Completion==
The [[warchief]] will be most interested in seeing these plans. You are a most loyal member of the [[Horde]].
