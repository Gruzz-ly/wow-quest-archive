==Objectives==
Walk with [[Garrosh Hellscream]].
* Walk with Garrosh

==Description==
I recently received word that some of your kind might be coming our way.

I've recently been trying to bolster the strength of the Horde. A few [[pandaren]] might do us good.

Walk with me, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||35}}

==Completion==
;Current
I know that few would be willing to leave their homeland to join the Horde. You, and the rest of your people, are welcome among our ranks.

Hellscream's eyes are upon you, pandaren. Welcome to the Horde.

;Old
Ji. <name>. You're here, good.

Let's keep this moving.

==Notes==
The player, followed by [[Ji Firepaw]], follows Garrosh around [[Grommash Hold]]'s throne room towards the exit. While they walk, Garrosh has words for the pandaren delegation:

:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|You've made a wise decision to join my [[Horde]].}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|There are some that would call us barbarians... the "mongrel races" of [[Azeroth]].}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|They are ignorant, and blind to reality. Look around you, pandaren.}}
:''Garrosh halts in front of [[Sauranok the Mystic]].''
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|You will find no better partner in battle than an [[orc]].}}
:''Garrosh walks over to [[Gotura Fourwinds]].''
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|The tauren have made themselves useful. Look - this one is a [[shaman]].}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Even a [[blood elf]] can hold a sword.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Do you see it? Everyone in my Horde earns their keep. You and your friends will be no exception!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Do you understand this, pandaren?}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|Yes, [[warchief]].}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Hm. Good.}}
:''Garrosh begins walking towards the door.''
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Moving on. I know that you are not the only pandaren to escape from that island.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|[[Tushui Pandaren|Some]] of your kind chose to join the [[Alliance]].}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|They are now your enemies.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|You may have had friends and kin who chose to cast their lot with the enemies of the Horde. They are no longer your friends... no longer your family.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|The minute they put on that Alliance tabard, they died. I will NOT tolerate any lingering ties across enemy lines. Traitors to the Horde will die a traitor's death!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Do I make myself clear?}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|I... I believe so. Yes.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Good.}}

{{rfg-section|7.0.3}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Meet me in the Valley of Honor. I have a gift for you.}}
:''Garrosh exits the Hold and mounts onto an armored [[wyvern]], flying away toward the Valley of Honor.''

At the [[Warchief's Command Board]] next to Grommash Hold:
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|Look at this!}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|Well, that's good news. Once we join the Horde, we certainly won't run out of things to do.}}

On the way to the Valley of Honor, more citizens call out. Just outside of the [[Drag]]:
:{{text|say|[[Omakka Wolfbrother]]|Welcome to Orgrimmar!}}
:{{text|say|[[Orgrimmar Grunt]]|Have you come to serve the Horde?}}

Entering the Drag:
:{{text|say|[[Ukos Bloodwhisper]]|Best move quickly through this area, stranger.}}
:{{text|say|Ukos Bloodwhisper|The warchief doesn't take kindly to non-orcs loitering in this part of Orgrimmar.}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|He... he segregates the city?}}
:{{text|say|Ukos Bloodwhisper|Move along, then. Hellscream's eyes are upon you.}}

Outside the [[Orgrimmar Orphanage]]:
:{{text|say|[[Gogu]]|Whoah.}}
:{{text|say|[[Sasi]]|Whoah.}}
:{{text|say|Gogu|Cool!}}
:{{text|say|Sasi|Cool!}}

At the entrance to the [[Valley of Honor]], from two garishly-dressed goblins:
:{{text|say|[[Flekky Nox]]|Hah! Look at these goofy guys comin' through.}}
:{{text|say|[[Zazzle]]|Pretty funny-lookin', if you ask me.}}
:{{text|say|Flekky Nox|Yeah... pretty funny-lookin' alright.}}

Passing by [[Rok'kal]]:
:{{Text|say|Rok'kal|Zug Zug.}}
:{{Text|say|Rok'kal|Me like fish}}
:{{text|say|Ji Firepaw|That's great! I like fish too!}}

Garrosh waits at the [[Ring of Valor]].

==Trivia==
*"Welcome to Orgrimmar! Have you come to serve the Horde?" was one of [[Thrall]]'s quotes when he was the [[Warchief]].
*Despite the quest being updated and shortened, Garrosh still appears in the [[Valley of Honor]].
