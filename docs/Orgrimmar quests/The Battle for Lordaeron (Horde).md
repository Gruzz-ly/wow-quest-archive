Upon defeating all three waves, a cutscene plays:
:''Anduin manages to strike the Azerite War Machine, destroying it.''
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Prepare the Blight! Let it rain down upon their armies!}}
:{{text|say|High Overlord Saurfang|There must be another way, Warchief!}}

:{{Text|yell|High Overlord Saurfang|Maintain your honor, heroes. Lok-narash.}}

Attack the enemies and push them to Brill. A cinematic plays:

:''Anduin and Greymane lead Alliance forces back to Brill, away from the cloud of blight. As they reach a clear area, both kings turn and face the walls of Lordaeron.''
:{{text|bossemote|Genn Greymane|The blight has broken our ranks!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Our assault...has been for nothing.}}
:''A cold wind begins to blow; both kings turn, and Genn growls as a stormcloud approaches them from the rear.''
:{{text|bossemote|Genn Greymane|What now?}}
:''The cloud parts, revealing a vessel held aloft by arcane magic. Standing at the bow, hair and cloak whipping in the wind, is...''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Jaina!}}
:''[[Jaina Proudmoore]] raises her hands, channeling a wave of frost magic to clear the blight clouds and freeze the Forsaken catapults and the risen skeletons.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Alliance! Forward!}}
:''Anduin leads his rallied troops through the clearing haze towards Lordaeron. As he approaches the base of the walls, he turns and looks upward.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Jaina! The wall!}}
:''Jaina uses her magic to turn the ship to starboard, its arcane-charged cannons blasting a hole in the city's outer walls. Approaching the breach, Anduin dismounts and draws Shalamayne.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|We end this... now.}}

===Like Wildfire===
*Description: The Alliance have breached the wall. Meet with Nathanos Blightcaller to intercept them at a crucial chokepoint.

:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|The chokepoint we create will funnel them through the side of the keep and thin their ranks.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|With us out in the open, we will outnumber them ten to one!}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Understood. I will meet you as soon as I can.}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|No. Lor'themar and I will handle the interlopers. I can't risk leaving the warchief unguarded. You are not to leave her side.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|How long are you expecting to hold them off? What is the warchief's strategy?}}
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|It is better if she tells you herself. Now go!}}
:{{Text|yell|Nathanos Blightcaller|Champions, with me! We rally in the keep! Your warchief commands it!}}
:{{Text|yell|Nathanos Blightcaller|Lor'themar, command our rangers from the flank! Position them on the rooftops!}}

:{{text|yell|Baine Bloodhoof|RETREAT!}}
:''Sylvanas shoots a plague wagon of blight, obliterating most of the underlings.''
:{{text|say|Jaina Proudmoore|No! They must not escape!}}
Run with Nathanos back to the courtyard while Sylvanas plagues the area.

:{{Text|yell|Sylvanas Windrunner|Everyone! Follow Nathanos to the courtyard! I will block the Alliance from behind!}}

:{{Text|yell|Sylvanas Windrunner|We're almost there! Make haste, heroes!}}

===The Dark Lady===
*Description: Follow Sylvanas.
*Follow Sylvanas Windrunner
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|So good of you to finally show up, High Overlord.}}
:{{Text|say|High Overlord Saurfang|I had to see it for myself. Was this your plan all along? Is this how you meant to achieve victory? This... honorless travesty?}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Honor means nothing to a corpse, Saurfang. You have the luxury of underestimating death, but it is something with which I am intimately familiar.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Maybe you don't care if your people die so long as it is honorable. But to me, this Horde is worth saving. Anyone who disagrees does not deserve to stand among us.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|So die your warrior's death, High Overlord Saurfang. It means little to me. Perhaps I will raise your broken body to serve me once more.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Or perhaps you will have a chance to say hello to your son.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Champions, with me. You are invited to bear witness to the grand finale.}}
:''Sylvanas and the party runs in the direction of the Throne room.''

An ending cutscene plays:

:''Baine slams the door of the throne room shut before angrily rounding on Sylvanas.''
:{{text|bossemote|Baine Bloodhoof|You abandoned Saurfang to die out there!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|It is the death he wanted. If that troubles you, you're free to join him. Or you can tend to the living. The choice is yours.}}
:''Baine closes his eyes a moment, then glares for a moment at Sylvanas.''
:{{text|bossemote|Baine Bloodhoof|For the Horde.}}
:''After Baine leaves, Sylvanas turns to Nathanos, holding out her bow.''
:{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|You know what must be done.}}
:''As Nathanos takes her bow, she lifts his chin with her finger, so that his eyes meet hers.''
:{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|Go... my champion.}}
:''Nathanos nods and leaves the room. Sylvanas approaches the empty throne of King Terenas and lounges in it, waiting for her "visitors". A moment later, the doors slam open, and Anduin, Genn, Jaina, and Alleria enter. Anduin steps into the center of the seal on the floor to face her. Her sarcasm drips heavily.''
:{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|Look at you. The boy's playing soldier.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Genn Greymane|Our king just routed your army!}}
:''Huffing at the interruption, Sylvanas rolls her eyes.''
:{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|Muzzle your dog, Your Majesty.}}
:''Genn snarls in anger, but Anduin raises an arm to hold him back.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Sylvanas Windrunner, you have led the Horde to a place without honor. Lordaeron is ours. It's over.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|Your father would be ''so'' proud. Is that... his?}}
:''Sylvanas points at the blade of Shalamayne, splashed with blood.''
:{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|You've gotten it all bloody.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Only one of us wanted this war.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|You call for peace when it suits you, little lion, but you're quick enough to kill.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|I should have killed you when last we met.}}
: ''Sylvanas sighs.''
:{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|How rude, sister. You're a guest in my home.}}
: ''Stepping forward, Genn responds with barely suppressed rage.''
:{{text|bossemote|Genn Greymane|Your home? You desecrate that throne with ''your filth!''}}
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|'''Enough!'''}}
: ''Snapping at Genn, Anduin slams the tip of Shalamayne's blade against the floor with a resounding clang. Genn shifts his posture back to a standing position. Anduin turns back to the Warchief.''
:{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|You put the torch to Teldrassil. But I failed those who burned. I will not make that mistake again. Surrender... or die.}}
:''Jaina looks away briefly while Anduin talks about his failure. Sylvanas rises from Terenas' throne and approaches the Alliance leaders; Genn snarls in anticipation for an attack while Alleria nocks an arrow and holds it steady at full draw, the two spreading out from Anduin to form a triangle with Jaina, surrounding him and Sylvanas as she stops face-to-face with him. Alleria glances up to the left as she hears a sound in the distance, but quickly turns her attention back to her sister.''
:{{text|bossemote|Sylvanas Windrunner|You've won... nothing.}}
:''Sylvanas becomes enveloped in shadows and lets out a banshee scream, knocking down her opponents and detonating barrels of Blight hidden in the balconies around the throne room before smashing through the ceiling of the dome. Anduin and the others move towards the door as the masonry collapses in front of them, blocking their exit.''
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|Hold on!}}
:''Jaina channels a teleportation spell, taking her, Anduin, Genn, and Alleria to her ship. Sylvanas lands on the deck of a Horde gunship, and silently takes back her bow when Nathanos holds it out to her. She watches the blight spread through Lordaeron, then looks over at Jaina's ship, and the Alliance leaders staring in shock and anger at her...which she acknowledges with a slight smirk.''

On the other side players are riding an [[Undercity Plaguebat (NPC)|Undercity Plaguebat]] back to Orgrimmar, and land on top of the front gate. Turn in to Nathanos.
