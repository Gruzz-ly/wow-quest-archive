==Objectives==
Fish up 6 Toxic Puddlefish and return them to [[Razgar]] in the [[Valley of Honor]] once you are done. 
*Toxic Puddlefish (6)

==Description==
Ever since those [[goblin]]s took up refuge in [[Orgrimmar]], they have been dumping all of there waste in our water supply.

I have no idea what effect this is having on our local fishing supply, but I don't think it's good. I have heard reports of a new mutated fish species spawning in that toxic pool near their camp. A few specimens would really help me figure out what exactly is going on.

Can you help me out?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|74000}} (or {{coppercost|132300}} on lvl 85)
*+1 [[Fishing]]
*[[Bag of Shiny Things]]

==Progress==
Were you able to fish up a few specimens?

==Completion==
Nice work <name>.  These samples will help us figure out what is going on in that toxic soup over there.

==Notes==
* This quest is a requirement for the achievement [[Fish or Cut Bait: Orgrimmar]].
* Following the removal of the [[Goblin Slums]], Toxic Puddlefish can now be fished in the shallow pond water north of the [[Orgrimmar Embassy]]. There is no specific pool or target to fish in; anywhere in the section highlighted on the minimap will work.
* The drop rate is fairly low - several casts will likely be needed per Puddlefish.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
