==Objectives==
Meet with [[Dark Ranger Lyana]] in [[Elwynn Forest]].

==Description==
My [[spies]] report that our [[Varok Saurfang|High Overlord]] did not leave the way he entered, nor any other way we know of. No signs of him were seen at any of the known exits from the [[Stockades]] or the sewers. He simply was in his cell one moment, and gone the next.

Begin your investigation around the city of [[Stormwind]]. There must be another way out that we do not know of.

Dark Ranger Lyana will meet you there. Her [[Tracker|tracking skills]] are second to none.

Do not fail me, my champion.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
There is no time to waste. Let us begin our investigation.

==Notes==
