==Objectives==
Talk to [[Chronormu|Chromie]] in [[Orgrimmar]].
*Speak with [[Melitier Vahlouran]] in the [[Valley of Strength]].

==Description==
Hi. I'm [[Ambassador Blackguard]].

<Blackguard looks down at a piece of paper in his hand.>

On behalf of the warchief, I am honored to welcome you to [[Orgrimmar]], <race>.

<Glances at you, smiles unconvincingly, then looks back at the paper.>

As a lifetime of adventure unfolds... ugh!

That's it! I'm tired of reading this same greeting day in and day out.

Talk to [[Chronormu|Chromie]], she's on the hourglass, then talk to your emissary. Run along.

I'm too old for this.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|25}}

==Progress==
Not quite as beautiful as Suramar, is it?

==Completion==
So this is Orgrimmar. The [[orc]]s have made some... interesting aesthetic choices. Be careful of the spikes, <name>.

And the smells. So many smells.

==Notes==
;Completion
:{{text|say|Melitier Vahlouran|Stars guide you, <name>. I have heard intriguing talk of the Hillsbrad Foothills. I will likely journey there.}}
