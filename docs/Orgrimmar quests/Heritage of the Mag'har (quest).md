==Objectives==
Meet [[Overlord Geya'rah]] in [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
You have fought countless battles across the face of [[Azeroth]]. You have shown both our allies and enemies what it means to be [[Mag'har]]!

Return to [[Orgrimmar]] that I may recognize your dedication to our people.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Heritage of the Mag'har|id=280416|Collect the appearances of the Heritage of the Warsong, Blackrock, and Frostwolf clans.|icon=achievement_alliedrace_magharorc}}

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Though {{Au|Draenor}} is lost to us, we will never forget our ancestral home... or those who were lost in the fight for our freedom.

Your victories in Azeroth prove that our people have earned a place in the [[Horde]]. It pleases me to honor you with this symbol of our proud lineage.

==Notes==
*The quest is automatically accepted when you reach level {{Level|bfa-max}}.
