==Objectives==
Speak to [[Doras]] to purchase a wind rider ride to [[Razor Hill]]. Once you arrive, speak with [[Gar'Thok]].

==Description==
When you're ready to take the wind rider down to Razor Hill, simply speak with me again. When you get there, waste no time in finding Gar'Thok. He's the one responsible for preparing reports on recent [[Alliance]] activity in Durotar.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*85 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
[[Eitrigg]] sent you? The [[warchief]] must be getting anxious to read my reports. I'd've sent them long ago, but each day we discover more about the Alliance's plans for invading [[Durotar]].
