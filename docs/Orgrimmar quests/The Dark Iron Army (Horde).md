==Objectives==
Use the Fast-Acting Poison to contaminate 6 Grain Rations in the [[West Garrison]] or [[East Garrison]] of [[Blackrock Depths]].
*Poison [[Grain Rations]] (6)
*[[Fast-Acting Poison]] (provided)

==Description==
As a member of the [[Shattered Hand]], you know that it is our job to watch the [[Horde]]'s enemies. We have discovered that the [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron dwarves]] and their new allies, [[Twilight's Hammer]], are preparing to attack.

I'm sending you to help deal with this threat before the [[Dark Iron Army|Dark Iron army]] marches. Take this poison and apply it to the soldiers' rations of grain in Blackrock Depths.

The rations for most of the Dark Iron army are kept in the East and West Garrison of Blackrock Depths.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|10|70|}}
* 3,450 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*[[Facemask of the Shattered Hand]]

==Progress==
Have you done as asked? We can't afford to let a full-strength army depart [[Blackrock Mountain]].

==Completion==
The poison should decimate their ranks if they're slow in discovering the tainted rations. Even if it does not kill most of the troops, we will have delayed them significantly. Well done.

==Progression==
#[[Meet with Thega Graveblade]] (optional)
#[[The Dark Iron Army (Horde)]]
