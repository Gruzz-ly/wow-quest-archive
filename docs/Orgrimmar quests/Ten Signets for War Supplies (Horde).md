==Objectives==
Ah, here for additional supplies for yourself, are you? Well, I can certainly understand the need for additional materiel... just take a look around if you need any proof.

I'll issue you some additional supplies, but you'll need to give me an appropriate number of commendation signets in exchange. You won't receive any recognition for surrendering the signets in this manner, but you might find something useful that will help keep you alive when battle is finally upon us.
*[[Horde Commendation Signet]] (10)

==Rewards==
You receive:
*[[Ahn'Qiraj War Effort Supplies]]

==Completion==
Well then, it's settled; here are your supplies, <class>. If you wish to do an additional exchange, then I am prepared to authorize it. Just give me the word and I'll make it happen.

Keep up the good work, <name>. We need all the materiel we can muster if we're going to win this thing. If we all do our part, then victory shall be ours for the taking!
