==Objectives==
Meet [[Grand Magister Rommath]] in the [[Twilight Highlands]].
*Take Rommath's portal to the Twilight Highlands

==Description==
I've received word from [[Magister Umbric]]. He has found similar evidence that the [[Twilight's Blade]] are recruiting in [[Stormwind]].

The [[Void]] poses an existential threat to all of [[Azeroth]]. We must stop the cult at its source.

We've agreed to meet in the cult's homeland, the [[Twilight Highlands]]. Find me there so we may continue our investigation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|3|9}}
* 180 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good, you've arrived.

Keep an eye on our allies. We may be working with them to stop the Twilight's Blade, but the Void is insidious.

They cannot be fully trusted.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|It's imperative that we stop the Twilight's Blade at its source: The Twilight Highlands.}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|This portal will take you to our base of operations. I'll meet you there.}}

Rommath opens the [[Portal to the Twilight Highlands]] and enters it.

Take it. On the other side:
:{{Text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|Yet more minds twisted by the Void. This must seem quite familiar to you, Umbric.}}

After completion, both mages have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Grand Magister Rommath|No agent of the [[void]] will escape our watch. I hold everyone in suspicion.

{{Gossip|How do you feel about working with [[Magister Umbric]]?}}
{{Dialogue-child|This is a temporary alliance. If it were up to me, the [[Magisters]] would resolve this threat ourselves.

[[Magister Umbric|Umbric]] is prone to bending the proper order of things to meet his whims. Someone like that has no business calling himself a Magister.

{{gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
}}
}}
{{dialogue|title=Magister Umbric|The [[Twilight's Blade]] are a collection of fools. Fools who have been conscripted by [[Xal'atath]].

{{Gossip|How do you feel about working with [[Grand Magister Rommath]]?}}
{{Dialogue-child|[[Xal'atath]] is not a threat I treat lightly. Whatever shortsighted barbs [[Grand Magister Rommath|Rommath]] throws my way, I will work with him as long as he is useful.

There is more at stake than my pride. Not that it's in much danger.
