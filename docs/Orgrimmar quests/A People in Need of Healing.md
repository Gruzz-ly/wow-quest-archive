'''A People in Need of Healing''' properly begins the [[Heritage of Draenor]] questline, after the optional [[A Summon to Orgrimmar]] breadcrumb. The quest mostly place in the single-player scenario '''The Future of Our People''' in [[Alterac Valley]].

==Objectives==
Travel with [[Eitrigg]] to [[Alterac Valley]] to discuss the future of the [[orc]] people with [[Drek'Thar]].
*Portal to Alterac Valley taken{{Co|51.17|78.94|Orgrimmar}}
*Complete Scenario "The Future of Our People"

==Description==
It is strange, <name>. Despite the years of peace, I am restless. Despite having the [[Horde]] and [[Ariok|my son]], I am lonely. You feel the same, don't you? I see it in your eyes, and in the eyes of many orcs.

I feel perhaps that while we have found our way on [[Azeroth]], we have lost our way as orcs.

Come with me. I wish to speak with an old friend about these troubles, and I would like you by my side.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Completion==
This was meant to be a quiet family visit with Drek'Thar, and perhaps a conversation with [[Durak]] about his future.

Instead, we have set off on a path that will affect the orcish people as a whole!

Do not misunderstand me. I think this is the best course of action. It is just surprising how quickly it happened. I am to be a [[Farseer]]...

There is much for us to do. We had best get to it.

==Notes==
[[File:A People in Need of Healing - Kashra and portal.jpg|thumb|Arcweaver Kashra and the portal.]]
On accept, Eitrigg walks out of Grommash Hold into the [[Valley of Strength]], where [[Arcweaver Kashra]] is waiting with a Portal to Alterac Valley.
:{{Text|say|Eitrigg|When I think of the ways we've lost, I think of the [[Kosh'harg]].}}
:{{Text|say|Eitrigg|Twice each year, the clans came together. But that tradition died with [[Draenor]].}}
:{{Text|say|Eitrigg|I shared my desire to see it return with [[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]], long before the [[Fourth War]].}}
:{{Text|say|Eitrigg|"This is no time for dead traditions," he said. He may have been right, then.}}
:{{Text|emote|Arcweaver Kashra bows as you and Eitrigg approach.}}
:{{Text|say|Eitrigg|Perhaps it is finally time for it to live again!}}

He takes the portal and disappears. Arcweaver Kashra has some gossip text:
:Greetings, <name>.

:When you are ready, this portal will take you to the [[Frostwolf clan|Frostwolf]] lands in Alterac Valley.

Using the portal places the player in the scenario "The Future of Our People".

===Stage 1: A Family Visit===
[[File:A People in Need of Healing - arrival.jpg|thumb|Eitrigg and Galvangar in the tower.]]
[[File:A People in Need of Healing - guards and villagers.jpg|thumb|Two Frostwolf Guardians keeping curious villagers out.]]
:You have arrived with Eitrigg in the Frostwolf lands. You should follow him to your audience with Drek'Thar.
*Follow Eitrigg to the [[Hall of the Frostwolf]]{{Co|48.11|82.62|Alterac Valley}}
*Talk to Drek'Thar{{Co|47.13|86.96|Alterac Valley}}

The player arrives at the base of a tower in [[Frostwolf Village]]. During the scenario, invisible walls are present around the village to prevent the player from going too far. At the tower's northern entrance, two [[Frostwolf Guardian]]s are holding off [[Yaelika Farclaw]], [[Smith Regzar]], [[Shrye Ragefist]], and further back some [[Frostwolf Legionnaire]]s. One of the Guardians says:
:Everyone is excited to see [[Thrall]], but we don't want them to crowd his family!

The other says:
:More important guests? [[Frostwolf Keep]] hasn't been this busy in years!

[[Usha Eyegouge]], the [[Frostwolf Quartermaster]], and [[Jorek Ironside]] are standing on the backside of the building, but don't offer their normal services. [[Captain Galvangar]] is standing halfway up the stairs. His gossip text:
:Alterac Valley hasn't seen this much excitement in years!

:What's so special about today to warrant such prestigious visitors?

:{{Gossip|<Explain Eitrigg's desire to bring back the Kosh'harg.>}}
::That's all? A party?

::I thought you were here to tell us about a new [[Scourge]] or [[Burning Legion|Legion]] invasion or some other world-ending threat!

[[File:A People in Need of Healing - Palkar and Whiteclaw.jpg|thumb|Whiteclaw and Palkar.]]
Somewhat hidden away at the top of the stairs are [[Palkar]] and [[Whiteclaw (wolf)|Whiteclaw]]. Palkar's gossip:
:Who are you, stranger?

:<You explain that you are here with Eitrigg to talk to Drek'Thar about bringing back the Kosh'harg.>

:Ahh, <name>. I have heard tales of your exploits on the battlefield. You have made quite the name for yourself.

:I am Palkar, steward of Drek'Thar. It is my duty to tend to all the [[Farseer]]'s needs. Your quest seems worthy, but I am afraid even if the festival returns, I will not travel to see it.

:Drek'Thar's health is fading. Powerful he may be, but he is mortal. I must stay by his side while he is still with us.

Eitrigg is waiting at the tower's southeastern entrance. On approach, he starts walking up the hill toward Frostwolf Keep.
:{{Text|say|Eitrigg|Drek'Thar is ahead.}}

[[File:A People in Need of Healing - Aggra and Eitrigg.jpg|thumb|Aggra, Rehze, their wolves, and Eitrigg.]]
Outside the Keep are [[Aggra]] and [[Rehze]], along with [[Moonpaw]], [[Ryala]], [[Spring]], and [[Winter]].
:{{Text|say|Eitrigg|Aggra?}}
:{{Text|say|Aggra|Eitrigg! We have come with the children to see Drek'Thar.}}
:{{Text|say|Aggra|Say hello, Rehze.}}
:''Rehze makes a shy noise and backs away to stand behind her mother.''
:{{Text|say|Aggra|Ah, she is still shy!}}
:{{Text|say|Aggra|Come--Drek'Thar and Thrall are inside.}}

Aggra, Rehze, and Eitrigg walk into the Hall of the Frostwolf, where Drek'Thar—sitting in his wheelchair and accompanied as always by [[Duros]] and [[Drakan]]—is talking to Thrall and [[Durak]].
:{{Text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|No need to worry, young Durak. When you complete your [[om'riggor]], your path will reveal itself.}}
:{{Text|say|Durak|Did you become a shaman after your om'riggor, father?}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|I... did not complete the om'riggor.}}
:{{Text|say|Durak|Then how did you know your path?}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|I... ah! Aggra. And Eitrigg! What brings you here?}}

[[File:A People in Need of Healing - Laggrond and Jotek.jpg|thumb|Warmaster Laggrond and Jotek.]]
[[File:A People in Need of Healing - Bloodsnarls.jpg|thumb|Yazra and Teeka Bloodsnarl.]]
Standing around in the upper level of the village around Frostwolf Keep are some generic [[Frostwolf Bowman|Frostwolf Bowmen]], [[Warmaster Laggrond]] and [[Jotek]], Wing Commanders [[Wing Commander Guse|Guse]] and [[Wing Commander Mulverick|Mulverick]], [[Sergeant Yazra Bloodsnarl|Yazra]] and [[Corporal Teeka Bloodsnarl|Teeka Bloodsnarl]], [[Commander Mulfort]], [[Voggah Deathgrip]], and [[Primalist Thurloga]] and her [[Frostwolf Shaman (Alterac Valley)|Frostwolf Shaman]]. Thurloga is the only character to have gossip text:
:Though the valley has been relatively quiet in the last few years, we [[tauren]] who served alongside the Frostwolf in battle have decided to stay.

:Alterac Valley has become our home, and we have even grown to prefer the colder climate.

[[File:A People in Need of Healing - Thrall and family.png|thumb|Durak, Thrall, Aggra, and Rehze.]]
The characters inside the Hall have dialogue as well. Aggra:
:It is good to see you, <name>. I hope you will be as good a friend to my children as you have to Go'el and myself.

Thrall:
:It is good to see you, my friend. We brought the children to meet Drek'thar{{Sic}} and the other Frostwolves.

:Please, say hello to Durak. He has heard many, many tales of your victories.

:<Thrall grins.>

:You have a fan.

Durak:
:Oh, <name>! I've heard all about you from my father! It's an honor to meet you!

Rehze:
:<Rehze blushes and looks away as you approach.>

:...Hi.

Speak to Drek'Thar to advance the scenario:
:We Frostwolves haven't had many visitors in years. Now we have so many, and all at once! My day has been blessed.

:What brings you and Eitrigg?

:{{Gossip|Eitrigg wishes to discuss bringing back the Kosh'harg.}}
::<Drek'Thar's expression changes, suddenly reminded of something long forgotten.>

::I foresaw this moment long ago, <name>. Today will define the future of our people.

::Do an old orc a favor, hm? Take my totems, and place them around the room.

::The elements should be present for what comes next.

::{{Gossip|<Take Drek'thar's{{Sic}} Totems.>}}

===Stage 2: A Matter of Great Importance===
[[File:Farseer's Totems.jpg|thumb|Farseer's Totems on the player's back.]]
:You have assembled in Frostwolf Keep with Eitrigg, Thrall, Aggra, and their children. It is time to discuss the return of the Kosh'harg.
*Discuss the Kosh'harg with Drek'thar{{Sic}}
*Totems Placed (4)

The player gains 4 stacks of the Farseer's Totems buff, with a visual of a totem placed on their back:
:{{Abilities|Farseer's Totems|id=400890|Carrying Drek'Thar's totems.|icon=spell_totem_wardofdraining}}

:{{Text|say|Eitrigg|I fear that our people have lost the old ways. It has been long since old traditions were set aside. I wish to see the return of the Kosh'harg.}}
:{{Text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|You are right--it has been long. Too long. Many orcs no longer feel they belong to a clan.}}
:{{Text|say|Aggra|If I may... we could offer more than just a reunion. The om'riggor tradition has never been enough in my eyes, and many did not have the chance to attempt it.}}
:''Aggra briefly turns to look at Thrall as she says the last part, before turning back to Drek'Thar.''
:{{Text|say|Aggra|I suggest a new rite of passage. One that teaches not just of the hunt, but of what it means to be an orc. An [[om'gora]]--a rite of honor.}}
:{{Text|say|Aggra|A rite for all orcs of age. Including you, Go'el.}}
:{{Text|say|Durak|Yes!}}
:{{Text|say|Eitrigg|<name>, I asked you here for a reason. You are everything an orc should aspire to be--an example for others to follow.}} ''(The voice-over says "My friend" in place of the player's name.)''
:{{Text|say|Eitrigg|You should be the first to complete this new rite.}}
:{{Text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|An honor! But one I wish to see you prove yourself worthy of.}}
:{{Text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|Will you accept my challenge, <name>? I warn you--ancient as I am, I still wield the power of the elements.}}

Interact with the ghost images of four totems around the room: the [[Totem of Water]], [[Totem of Air]], [[Totem of Earth]], and [[Totem of Fire]].

===Stage 3: Drek'Thar's Challenge===
[[File:A People in Need of Healing - Drek'Thar's Challenge.jpg|thumb|Drek'Thar preparing to empower his wolves.]]
[[File:A People in Need of Healing - Duros and Drakan.jpg|thumb|The empowered Duros and Drakan.]]
:Drek'Thar has issued you a challenge! Prove you are worthy of being the first to complete the new rite by defeating Duros and Drakan.
*Talk to Drek'thar{{Sic}} to Begin{{Co|47.13|86.96|Alterac Valley}}
*Duros Defeated
*Drakan Defeated

Talk to Drek'Thar:
:Eitrigg has placed his faith in you. Will you prove yourself worthy of this honor?

:{{Gossip|I accept your challenge!}}

Duros and Drakan walk into the center of the room while Drek'Thar briefly rises from his chair to channel elemental magic in his hands. The other orcs back away to the edges of the room.
:{{Text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|Face the might of the Frostwolves, and the strength of the elements!}}

He empowers Duros with a Boon of Storm and Flame and Drakan with a Boon of Frost and Earth, giving them elemental-themed abilities. Both wolves then attack the player.
:{{Abilities|Boon of Storm and Flame|id=404074|Enhanced by the powers of storm and flame.|icon=spell_shaman_stormearthfire}}
:{{Abilities|Boon of Frost and Earth|id=404078|Enhanced by the powers of frost and earth.|icon=spell_fire_bluehellfire}}

Upon being brought to 30% health, the wolves turn friendly again and lie back down in their old spots. Defeat both to complete the stage.

===Stage 4: The Farseer's Power===
[[File:Elemental Projection.jpg|thumb|The Elemental Projection.]]
:You have defeated Drek'Thar's wolves, but he is not finished with you yet!
*Defeat the [[Elemental Projection]]

:{{Text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|Duros... Drakan... You did well.}}
:{{Text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|But I am not yet finished!}}
:He rises from his wheelchair again and channels elemental magic to create an Elemental Projection of himself.
:{{Text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|Elements! Hear my call!}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Drek'Thar's totems greatly empower the projection!}}
:{{Text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|Show me your true strength, <name>!}}

The Projection turns hostile and attacks. Each of the four totems turn hostile as well; each one channels a buff into the projection. Destroy them to remove the buffs. Drek'Thar keeps separately channeling magic into the Projection.
*Totem of Water: {{Abilities|Soothing Waters|id=404313|Water soothes the target, healing them for X every 4 sec.|icon=shaman_pvp_ripplingwaters}}
*Totem of Fire: {{Abilities|Raging Flames|id=404276|Surrounds the target with raging flames that leap out when attacked, inflicting X Fire damage.|icon=inv_elemental_eternal_fire}}
*Totem of Air: {{Abilities|Fury of Air|id=400972|Hastens the target's actions with helpful gusts, increasing their attack speed by 35%.|icon=inv_elemental_primal_air}}
*Totem of Earth: {{Abilities|Shield of Earth|id=400969|Protects the target with earth, reducing damage taken by 80%.|icon=spell_nature_skinofearth}}

===Final Stage: Preparations===
[[File:A People in Need of Healing - end.jpg|thumb|Aggra and her children in the Broken Tusk.]]
:You have proven yourself worthy of being the first to complete the new rite. It is time to begin preparations for the Kosh'harg!
*Talk to Thrall{{Co|47.42|86.76|Alterac Valley}}
*Use [[:Thrall's Hearthstone]] to return to [[Orgrimmar]]

Upon the Projection's defeat, Drek'Thar sits down again and the other orcs walk back into the center.
:{{Text|say|Durak|That was amazing.}}
:{{Text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|Ha! You are worthy indeed. But these old bones won't make it to [[Kalimdor]]. Another will have to preside over the Kosh'harg.}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|If I am to complete the rite, I cannot lead the--}}
:{{Text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|Not you. Aggralan.}}
:{{Text|say|Aggra|Me?}}
:{{Text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|Your strength speaks for itself. You are more than ready... Farseer.}}
:{{Text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|A title long overdue.}}
:''Aggra bows.''
:{{Text|say|Aggra|I... I am honored.}}

Drek'Thar gets new gossip text:
:Aggralan is nervous, but I know [[Greatmother Geyah]] has taught her everything she will need. She will serve as both your judge and your guide.

:Good luck on your om'gora, <name>. May the Kosh'harg bring our people together.

Talk to Thrall:
:Everything has been decided, then. Go with my family to Orgrimmar to prepare for your rite. Eitrigg and I will gather the clans and meet you in [[Durotar]].

:Here, take my [[:hearthstone]]. It will take you to the [[Broken Tusk]]. I will see you soon, with the assembled clans!

:{{Gossip|<Take Thrall's Hearthstone>}}

The player receives [[Thrall's Hearthstone]], both as an item and as an extra action button:
:{{Abilities|Thrall's Hearthstone|id=398099|Hearths the user to The Broken Tusk in Orgrimmar.|icon=achievement_guildperk_hastyhearth}}

Use either one to leave the scenario. On arrival, Aggra is waiting in the inn with Durak and Rehze.
