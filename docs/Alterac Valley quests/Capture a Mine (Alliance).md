==Objectives==
Capture a mine that the [[Stormpike Guard|Stormpike]] does not control, then return to [[Sergeant Durgen Stormpike]] in the [[Alterac Mountains]].
*Mine Captured

==Description==
The mines in [[Alterac Valley]] hold more than just minerals. Both the [[Frostwolf clan|Frostwolf]] and Stormpike have cached excess supplies in the [[Irondeep Mine|Irondeep]] and [[Coldtooth Mine|Coldtooth]] [[mine]]s... that's not a bad idea, if we could only maintain control of them!

Capture a mine, then return to me. To capture a mine, enter one that we do not control and kill its leader. When you do that, the mine will be ours, and we'll send troops to protect it!

==Progress==
You haven't captured the mine yet, <name>! After we control a mine, it will be much easier to gather minerals and supplies from it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 8,190 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Stormpike Guard]]
* +250 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Completion==
You did it!  Well done, <name>!

When we control a mine and have troops stationed there, it's much easier to gather minerals and supplies from it.

==Patch changes==
