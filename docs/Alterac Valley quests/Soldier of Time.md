==Description==
Long ago, the land of [[Alterac Valley]] was peaceful. However, when the [[Frostwolf clan|Frostwolves]] moved in it became highly contested real estate between them and the [[Stormpike Guard|Stormpikes]]. Battles used to rage for days.

You made it back and through the battle, or did you have to leave for a short respite?

==Completion==
The battles for Alterac were bloody affairs, I'm glad they're done. Oh wait, the battles are still ongoing! The cycle of strife is never ending.
