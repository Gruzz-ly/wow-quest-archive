==Objectives==
Capture a mine, then return to [[Corporal Teeka Bloodsnarl]] in the [[Alterac Mountains]].
*Mine Captured

==Description==
As battle rages over the landscape of [[Alterac Valley]], so too does it rage through the [[Coldtooth Mine|Coldtooth]] and [[Irondeep Mine|Irondeep]] mines.  Both are rich sources of [[mineral]]s and both are used to store supplies; it's no wonder they are so highly valued!

Help our war effort, <name>!  Capture one of the mines for the [[Horde]]!  To capture a mine, enter one that we do not control and kill its leader.  When that is done, the mine will be ours and we'll send troops to protect it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9550 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Clan]]
*+250 reputation with {{F|Orgrimmar}}

==Progress==
You haven't yet captured a mine, <name>!  Find one that we do not control and defeat it's{{sic}} leader!

==Completion==
You captured a mine!  With our own warriors protecting it, it will be much simpler to extract minerals from its depths, or gather supplies that have been cached there.

Well done, <name>.  The deed you have done is a great boon to our battle efforts.
