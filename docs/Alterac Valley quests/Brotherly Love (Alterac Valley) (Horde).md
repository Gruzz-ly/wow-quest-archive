==Objectives==
Travel into [[Stormpike clan|Stormpike]] territory and slay Commander Karl Philips. Return to [[Commander Louis Philips]] when the task is complete.
* [[Commander Karl Philips]] slain

==Description==
Tragic... My brother faces me on the field of battle: A commander for the Stormpike.

Of the four Stormpike Commanders, he is undoubtedly the most dangerous. Perhaps if he is slain, the [[Banshee Queen]] could turn him as she did me - show him the error of his ways...

Deep within enemy territory you will find my brother. Slay him and return to me. I trust that you are capable of completing this mission, soldier.

And soldier, do not go alone.

==Rewards==
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Frostwolf Clan]]
* +250 reputation with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]
* +250 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
How it must pain him to remain as one of the living while his beloved brother has ascended to perfection.

==Completion==
Your heroics will not go unnoticed, <name>.

I must waste no time if he is to be saved. Sylvanas must be contacted!
