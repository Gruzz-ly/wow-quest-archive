==Objectives==
Their spirits are low, soldier. After our last failed air strike against the [[Horde]], they refuse to fly! It is up to you to bolster their morale.

Return to the battlefield and strike at the heart of the Frostwolf's command. Take down their commanders and guardians. Return to me with as many of their medals as you can stuff in your pack! I promise you, when my gryphons see the bounty and smell the blood of our enemies, they will fly again! Go now!
*[[Frostwolf Commander's Medal]]

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+10 [[reputation]] with {{F|Ironforge}}
*+5 reputation with [[Stormpike Guard]]

==Completion==
Can you see it? Look at them, soldier! They're coming around... Soon, Ichman's flight will once again strike at the heart of the valley! Stormpike will rule the skies!
