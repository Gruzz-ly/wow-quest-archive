==Objectives==
Speak with the [[Stormpike Quartermaster]].

==Description==
<name>, our quartermaster charged me to direct new recruits to him. He needs supplies from caches stored in the [[mine]]s of [[Alterac Valley|Alterac]], and he'll probably send you to get them.

Follow the road. You'll find our quartermaster to the west.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 820 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Stormpike Guard]]
* +10 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Completion==
It's good to see fresh troops here, <name>, but with a little luck you'll get into some action and won't be fresh for long!

Speak with me again.  I have tasks I must discuss with you....
