==Objectives==
Capture an enemy tower, then return to [[Corporal Teeka Bloodsnarl]] in the [[Alterac Mountains]]. 
*Tower Captured

==Description==
Towers and bunkers are important positions, and we must capture and hold them all! So to that end, I want you to attack a bunker that is controlled by the enemy.

To do that, enter one with an [[Alliance]] banner. You will see another banner inside. Pull out that banner, and a white [[Horde]] banner will appear in its place. Well done!

At that point your task for me will be complete, but if you hold the place long enough, and if the Alliance doesn't take it back, then it will be destroyed!

==Reward==
You will receive:{{cost||90|}}

==Progress==
You haven't yet assaulted a tower or bunker, <Name>! Are you waiting for others to claim your glory?

==Completion==
I heard of your mission's success! &nbsp;That pleases me...

Our troops can now charge forward with impunity, and show the [[Alliance]] that [[Alterac Valley]] is no place for them!

==Gains==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*6600 [[XP]] (or {{cost||39|}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Clan]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar]]
