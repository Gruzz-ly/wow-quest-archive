==Objectives==
Locate an Alterac Ram in Alterac Valley. Use the Stormpike Training Collar when you are near the Alterac Ram to 'tame' the beast. Once tamed, the Alterac Ram will follow you back to the Stable Master. Speak with the Stable Master to earn credit for the capture.
*Ram Collared and Returned
*[[Stormpike Training Collar]] (provided)

==Description==
Just look at the stables, <name>! Empty! The Stormpike Brigade has no rams to ride - the cavalry is defunct.

You must help us, soldier. Take this training collar and enter the wilds of this valley. Locate the Alterac rams that roam throughout the area and use the collar to snare one. When you have captured a ram, return it to me and I shall place it in our stable.

When we have enough rams, the ram rider commander will be notifed. With your help, the cavalry will be reborn!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
* +1 reputation with [[Stormpike Guard]]

==Progress==
Without your help, the Stormpike Ram Riders would not have mounts to ride into battle. You do us a great service!

==Completion==
The stables will be full in no time at all. Keep up the good work!

==Notes==
Upon bringing a ram to the Stable Master she has the following gossip:
:Just a few more and our stables will be overflowing with mounts. Release it into my custody, soldier. I'll take it from here.
:{{gossip|With pleasure. These things stink!}}
