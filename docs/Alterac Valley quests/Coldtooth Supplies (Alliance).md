==Objectives==
Bring 10 Coldtooth Supplies to the [[Stormpike Quartermaster|Alliance Quartermaster]] in [[Dun Baldar]].
*[[Coldtooth Supplies]] (10)

==Description==
The Coldtooth mine is a storage depot for the Horde. I can't stomach the food they give their troops, and the state of their arms and armor is atrocious! But... in times like these when supplies are so important, we can use what they have.

Enter the Coldtooth mine and bring me back their supplies. That will help keep the Alliance in fighting shape, and remove much needed equipment from the Horde's warriors.

Good luck, <name>. The mine is to the distant south, deep in Horde territory.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|40}}

==Progress==
Did you enter the Coldtooth mine in Horde territory, <name>?  Did you raid their supplies?

==Completion==
You got them!  Well done, <name>!  I'll go through these supplies and get them ready for our own troops!
