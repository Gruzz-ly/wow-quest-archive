==Objectives==
Bring 10 Irondeep Supplies to the [[Alliance]] Quartermaster in [[Dun Baldar]].
*[[Irondeep Supplies]] (10)

==Description==
Before the fighting started, we stored supplies for Dun Baldar in the [[Irondeep Mine|Irondeep mine]]. The [[trogg]]s that surfaced there weren't much of a problem when we had spare troops to guard the mine, but now that we're fighting with the [[Horde]] we can't maintain control of Irondeep.

We need the supplies in Irondeep, <name>. Enter the mine and bring me a load of them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||40|}}
*+2 [[reputation]] with [[Stormpike Guard]]

==Progress==
Do you have the supplies, <name>? &nbsp;We can never have enough!

==Completion==
Well done! &nbsp;I'll put these supplies to good use! &nbsp;Thanks, <name>!
