==Objectives==
I was locked up in a dwarven hellhole for days. You better believe I want revenge!

We must plan carefully.

First, my war riders need targets to gun for - high priority targets. I'm going to need to feed them the flesh of Stormpike Commanders. Unfortunately, those little buggers are entrenched deep behind enemy lines! You've definitely got your work cut out for you.
*[[Stormpike Commander's Flesh]]

==Completion==
Not enough! I would expect this level of work from an initiate, but you, &lt;name&gt;? Come on, soldier! HUSTLE! More flesh is needed!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +5 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Clan]]
* +10 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
