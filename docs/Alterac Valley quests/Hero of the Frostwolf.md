==Objectives==  
Speak with [[Voggah Deathgrip]]

==Description==
How does it feel, <name>? How does it feel to crush your enemies and watch their lines break apart? It feels good, doesn't it?

You should be rewarded for this heroic deed, soldier.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these weapons:|Wand of Biting Cold|Ice Barbed Spear|Bloodseeker|Cold Forged Hammer}}

==Notes==
The [[Alliance]] have a quest chain along similar lines, [[The Battle of Alterac]], to kill the Horde general. Their quest leads to [[Hero of the Stormpike]], yielding the same choice of weapon rewards as given to the Horde.

In essence, this quest chain requires you to win AV. You should pick up [[The Battle for Alterac]] quest before you head into the battleground for the first time.
