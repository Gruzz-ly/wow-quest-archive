==Objectives==
Slay [[Horde]] and loot a Storm Crystal and return it to [[Elerethe Renferal|Archdruid Renferal]] in [[Alterac Valley]].
* [[Storm Crystal]]

==Description==
The [[Frostwolf clan|Frostwolf Clan]] is protected by a taint of [[elemental]] energy. Their [[shaman]] meddle in powers that will surely destroy us all if left unchecked.

The damage has grown too great for the [[Cenarion Circle|Circle]] to control! [[Ivus the Forest Lord|Ivus]] must be called to our aid.

The Frostwolf [[soldier]]s carry elemental charms called storm crystals. We can use the charms to conjure Ivus. Venture forth and claim the crystals, <name>!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +10 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Have you brought us some crystals, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. I will use the power of this charm to augment the [[magic]] that has already been gathered. When enough power has been amassed, I shall focus the collected energies and call upon the Forest Lord to aid our cause.

==Patch changes==
