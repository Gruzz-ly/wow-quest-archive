==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these weapons:|Wand of Biting Cold|Ice Barbed Spear|Bloodseeker|Cold Forged Hammer}}

==Notes==
The [[Horde]] have a quest chain along similar lines, [[The Battle for Alterac]], to kill the Alliance general. Their quest leads to [[Hero of the Frostwolf]], yielding the same choice of weapon rewards as given to the Alliance.

In essence, this quest chain requires you to win AV. You should pick up [[The Battle of Alterac]] quest before you head into the battleground for the first time.
