==Objectives==
We must prepare the new fleet of War Riders, <race>! My riders are set to make a strike on the central battlefield; but first, I must wet their appetites - preparing them for the assault.

I need enough Stormpike Soldier Flesh to feed a fleet! Hundreds of pounds! Surely you can handle that, yes? Get going!
*[[Stormpike Soldier's Flesh]]

==Completion==
The fleet feeds on their flesh. It consumes the enemy.

Flight is imminent!

==Rewards==

*+1 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Clan]]
*+10 reputation with {{F|Orgrimmar}}
