==Objectives==
The [[Stormpike Guard|Stormpike Brigade]] cannot charge into battle bareback! We require harnesses for our mounts, after all, we are not savages.

While we could easily slay the [[ram]]s that roam near our base for the leather required to fashion a harness, doing so would be idiotic. We need those rams for [[mount]]s.

You must strike at our enemy's base, slaying the [[frostwolves]] they use as mounts and taking their hides. Return their hides to me so that harnesses may be made for the cavalry. Go!
*[[Frostwolf Hide]]

==Completion==
Well done, soldier. I will notify you when I have stockpiled enough of the hides.

Carry on!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+10 reputation with {{F|Ironforge}}
*+2 reputation with [[Stormpike Guard]]

==Patch changes==
