==Description==
We got them held prisoner, &lt;race&gt;. I'm talking about their Wing Commanders. It was a furious battle in the skies but they finally fell! Unfortunately, our best pilots were shot down in a counterattack against [[Frostwolf Keep]]. You gotta find out what happened to them.
Search [[Tower Point|Tower Point West]] and Frostwolf Keep. These were their last known locations. Search these areas thoroughly.

Unbelievable! You did free them, right? Right??? Well at the very least we know where they were held.
