==Objectives==
Bring 10 Irondeep Supplies to the Horde Quartermaster in [[Frostwolf Keep]].
*[[Irondeep Supplies]] (10)

==Description==
The [[Stormpike Guard|Stormpike]] dwarves are using the [[Irondeep Mine|Irondeep mine]] as a storage depot. I want you to raid that mine and bring me its supplies. This will curtail the Stormpikes' efforts in [[Alterac Valley]], and will provide us with needed equipment!

Be wary, <name>. The Irondeep mine is deep in [[Alliance]] territory, and control of the mine is as shifting as the snows of Alterac.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

==Progress==
Did you enter the Irondeep mine, <name>?  Did you raid its supplies?

==Completion==
You got them!  Nicely done, <name>!  And I hope you saw a few dwarves during your raid, and shed their blood for the Frostwolves!
