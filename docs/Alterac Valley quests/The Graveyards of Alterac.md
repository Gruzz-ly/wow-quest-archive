==Objectives==
Assault a graveyard, then return to [[Corporal Teeka Bloodsnarl]] in the [[Alterac Mountains]]. 
*Graveyard Assaulted

==Description==
The battle lines of [[Alterac Valley]] are ever shifting. Territories swing back and forth as we meet our opponents in deadly combat. And graveyards, <name>, are where battles rage most fierce.

I want you to attack an [[Alliance]] held graveyard! Find a graveyard with an Alliance banner in its midst and pull it from the ground.

Do that and your task for me will be complete, but... if you hold the graveyard for a few minutes, then it will be ours and troops will come and relieve you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||90|}}
*6600 [[XP]] (or {{cost||39|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Clan]]
*+250 reputation with [[Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Attack a graveyard held by the Alliance!

==Completion==
Well done, <name>!  With each graveyard under our control, the spirits of our enemies will wander more lost and aimless.

==Patch changes==
