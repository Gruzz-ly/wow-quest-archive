==Objectives==
Enter [[Alterac Valley]], defeat the Horde general [[Drek'thar]], and then return to [[Prospector Stonehewer]] in the Alterac Mountains.
*Defeat Drek'thar.

==Description==
The [[Explorers' League]] believes there are artifacts in Alterac Valley, but the [[Frostwolf]] orcs won't let us explore. We can't allow the Horde to stop our scholarly pursuits! Defeat the Frostwolf general, Drek'Thar. With him dead, the orcs will lose their edge.

Drek'Thar is in [[Frostwolf Keep]], in the south of Alterac Valley. Vanquish him, and then return to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|58|20|}}
* 12,285 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Stormpike Guard]]
* +500 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Go, <name>. Go to Alterac Valley and defeat the orc general!

==Completion==
Well done, <name>!  With the Horde's nose bloodied after the death of their general, we'll have the breathing room we need to explore!

==Notes==
Upon completion of this quest, you can speak to the NPC again to receive the quest [[Hero of the Stormpike]].

The [[Horde]] have a quest along similar lines, [[The Battle for Alterac]] to kill the Alliance general. Their quest leads to [[Hero of the Frostwolf]], yielding the same choice of weapon rewards as given to the Alliance.

In essence, this quest requires you to win AV. You should pick up this quest before you head into the battleground for the first time.

==Patch changes==
