==Objectives==
You've worked hard, <name>, but we have only just begun!

My War Riders must taste in the flesh of their targets. This will ensure a surgical strike against our enemies!

My fleet is the second most powerful in our air command. Thusly, they will strike at the more powerful of our adversaries. For this, then, they need the flesh of the Stormpike Lieutenants.

Make haste, soldier!
