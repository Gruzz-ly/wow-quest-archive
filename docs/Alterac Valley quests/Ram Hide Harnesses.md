==Objectives==
While some of our soldiers are busy capturing [[Wolf|wolves]] for the [[stable master]], others must provide for the simple necessities that riding requires. I am speaking of riding harnesses, of course.

You must strike at the indigenous [[ram]]s of the region. The very same rams that the [[Stormpike]] cavalry uses as [[mount]]s!

Slay them and return to me with their hides. Once we have gathered enough hides, we will fashion harnesses for the riders. The [[Frostwolf Wolf Rider]]s will ride once more!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*+2 reputation with [[Frostwolf Clan]]

==Completion==
Well done, soldier. I will notify you when I have stockpiled enough of the hides.

Carry on!
