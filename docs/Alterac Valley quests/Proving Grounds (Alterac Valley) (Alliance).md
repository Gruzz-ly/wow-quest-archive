==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Icewing Cavern]]s located southwest of [[Dun Baldar]] in [[Alterac Valley]] and recover the Stormpike Banner. Return the Stormpike Banner to [[Lieutenant Haggerdin]] in the [[Alterac Mountains]].
*[[Stormpike Banner]] {{co|41.8|36.2|Alterac Valley}}

==Description==
You've arrived just in time, <class>. These [[Frostwolf clan|Frostwolf]] savages just won't give up! We must show them the might of the [[Stormpike Guard|Stormpike]]. They must bow to our superiority.

Before you make your way to the field of battle, you will want to join the rank of Stormpike.

Southwest of Dun Baldar, you will find the Icewing Caverns. Planted deep within the caverns is a Stormpike Banner. Venture forth and recover that banner. Return it to me, and you will have earned a Stormpike initiate's insignia.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Stormpike Insignia Rank 1]]
*[[The Frostwolf Artichoke]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormpike Guard]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Beware the harpies of the region, <class>. They'll not think twice to rip out your throat!

==Completion==
Take and wear this insignia with pride, <name>. As your rank among the Stormpike grows, so too will the insignia. Return to me as you gain honor with Stormpike, and I shall replace your insignia with other, more powerful insignias.

Perhaps someday you will grow to be a legend on this field of battle. Should that day ever come, you will be granted the Eye of Command.
