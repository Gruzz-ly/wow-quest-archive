==Objectives==
Bring 20 Armor Scraps to [[Smith Regzar]] in [[Frostwolf Village]].
*[[Armor Scraps]] (20)

==Description==
When you fight the enemy, gather the scraps of their armor and bring them to me.  I'll use those scraps to make armor for our own troops!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9550 [[XP]]
*+1 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Clan]]
*+250 reputation with {{F|Orgrimmar}}

==Progress==
How goes the hunting, <name>.  Do you have any armor scraps for me?

==Completion==
These will do nicely.  I'll melt them down and patch them up and you'll never know they came from those [[Stormpike Guard|Stormpike]] cowards!

Thanks, <name>.  And let me polish up that armor of yours...
