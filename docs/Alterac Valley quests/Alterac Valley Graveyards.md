==Objectives==
Assault a graveyard, then return to [[Sergeant Durgen Stormpike]] in the [[Alterac Mountains]]. 
*Graveyard Assaulted

==Description==
The graveyards in [[Alterac Valley]] are prized territories. Both the [[Horde]] and the [[Alliance]] fight savagely for these sacred grounds. Are you, <name>, ready to join that fight?

I want you to assault an enemy graveyard. Find a graveyard with a Horde banner in its midst, and pull it from the ground! Do that, and your task will be complete....

But if you can also hold the graveyard for a few minutes, then our troops will soon come to relieve you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||90|}}
*6600 [[XP]] (or {{cost||39|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
*+250 reputation with [[Stormpike Guard]]

==Progress==
<Name>, you have not yet assaulted a graveyard. Return to me when this task is complete!

==Completion==
Well done!  Graveyards are vital to our control of Alterac Valley.  When you capture one, you help ensure the Alliance's sovereignty here.

Go now, <name>.  Reenter the battle, and if you see a graveyard under the Horde's control... you know what to do!
