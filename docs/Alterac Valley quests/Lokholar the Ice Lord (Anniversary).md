==Objectives==
Slay [[Alliance]] and loot [[Stormpike Guard|Stormpike]] Blood and return it to [[Primalist Thurloga]] within [[Frostwolf Village]] in [[Alterac Valley]].
* [[Stormpike Soldier's Blood]]

==Description==
I come from [[Thunder Bluff]], <race>. [[Cairne Bloodhoof|Cairne]] himself has seen to it that I assist the [[Frostwolf clan|Frostwolf Clan]] in these dire times.

But let us not waste any more time. You must strike down our enemies and bring to me their blood. Once enough blood has been gathered, the ritual of summoning may begin.

Victory will be assured when the [[Lokholar the Ice Lord|elemental lord]] is loosed upon the Stormpike army.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +10 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Have you come with an offering?

==Completion==
The blood of our enemies has been shed. I shall mix this blood with the rest that has been gathered. Once the offering is complete, the Ice Lord shall show these Stormpike dogs the full wrath of the Frostwolf Clan!
