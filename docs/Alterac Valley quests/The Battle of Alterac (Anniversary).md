==Description==
The [[Explorers' League]] believes there are artifacts in Alterac Valley, but the [[Frostwolf clan|Frostwolf]] [[orc]]s won't let us explore. We can't allow the [[Horde]] to stop our scholarly pursuits! Defeat the Frostwolf general, Drek'Thar. With him dead, the orcs will lose their edge.

==Progress==
Go, <name>. Go to Alterac Valley and defeat the orc general!

==Completion==
Well done, <name>!  With the Horde's nose bloodied after the death of their general, we'll have the breathing room we need to explore!
