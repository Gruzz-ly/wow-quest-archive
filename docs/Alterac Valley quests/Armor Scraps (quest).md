==Objectives==
Bring 20 Armor Scraps to [[Murgot Deepforge]] in [[Dun Baldar]].
*[[Armor Scraps]] (20)

==Description==
Battles rage constantly in [[Alterac Valley]], and the supplies we get from [[Ironforge]] are not enough to outfit our experienced troops.

If you find armor scraps from the battlefield, aid the war effort and bring those scraps to me!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*6600 [[XP]] (or {{cost||39|}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
*+1 reputation with [[Stormpike Guard]]

==Progress==
Did you bring any armor scraps, <name>?

==Completion==
These are some good pieces, <name>.  I can use them to fashion new equipment for our troops.

If my supply level gets high enough, then maybe our seasoned fighting units will enter the field!

==Patch changes==
