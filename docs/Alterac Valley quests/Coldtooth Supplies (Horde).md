==Objectives==
Bring 10 Coldtooth Supplies to the [[Horde]] Quatermaster in Frostwolf Keep.
*[[Coldtooth Supplies]] (10)

==Description==
The Coldtooth mine to the north was once an ideal place to store extra supplies, but now that the fighting with the Stormpikes grows fierce, we do not always have the spare warriors to station at the mine and protect it. And so, control of the mine often falls to the [[Alliance]], or to underground denizens...

But we still need our supplies, <name>! Go to the Coldtooth mine and bring me a load of them. And be wary of enemies as you go; the tides of battle shift quickly in that place...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|70}}
*+25 [[reputation]] with {{F|Orgrimmar}}

==Progress==
Have you been to the Coldtooth mine, <name>? Do you have the supplies I asked for?

==Completion==
Ah, you got them. Good work, <name>! These supplies are a little musty from sitting in that dark mine for so long, but we'll make use of them nonetheless.

Thank you, <name>. Your deeds are vital to the maintenance of our fighting forces.
