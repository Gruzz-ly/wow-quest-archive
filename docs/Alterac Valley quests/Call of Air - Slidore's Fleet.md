==Objectives==
My gryphons are poised to strike at the front lines but cannot make the attack until the lines are thinned out.

The Frostwolf warriors charged with holding the front lines wear medals of service proudly upon their chests. Rip those medals off their rotten corpses and bring them back here.
Once the front line is sufficiently thinned out, I will make the call to air! Death from above!
