'''Legendary Heroes''' is offered once players reach {{rep|exalted}} standing with the [[Stormpike Guard]].

==Progress==
Before me stands an exalted hero of the Alliance.

<Lieutenant Haggerdin salutes.>

Few have earned such a rank among the Stormpike. I have watched the enemy fall before you. I have seen their resolve crumble in your presence. When you enter the fray, you become the beacon of hope for our forces!

Present your insignia.
*[[Stormpike Insignia Rank 4]]

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Stormpike Insignia Rank 5]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Stormpike Guard]]
*+500 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Completion==
Surely it will be you who carries the Eye of Command!
