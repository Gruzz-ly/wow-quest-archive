==Objective==
Enter Alterac Valley and defeat the dwarven general, Vanndar Stormpike. Then, return to Voggah Deathgrip in the Alterac Mountains.

==Description==
The [[Stormpike]] dwarves and their allies have invaded [[Alterac Valley]], and we must drive them out! To win the battle for Alterac, we must defeat their general, [[Vanndar Stormpike]]!

You will find Vanndar in [[Dun Baldar]], in the north of Alterac Valley.

Destroy him, <name>, and then return to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,800 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Frostwolf Clan]]
* +500 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
We will not suffer the [[dwarf|dwarves]] in our home! Fall upon our foes and defeat their leader, general Stormpike!

==Completion==
Well done, <name>!  Stormpikes have no hope in this foolish invasion.

Hah!  So far, all they've done is get their general killed!

==Notes==
Upon completion of this quest, you can speak to the NPC again to receive the quest [[Hero of the Frostwolf]] .

The [[Alliance]] have the same quest [[The Battle of Alterac]] to kill the Horde general, which leads to [[Hero of the Stormpike]] with the same rewards.

In essence, this quest requires you to win AV. You should pick up this quest before you head into the battleground for the first time.
