==Objectives==
Slay 12 defenders inside Shadow Hold.
* [[Shadow Hold]] Defenders Slain (12)

==Description==
With their sentries gone, the greater members of the [[Shadow Council]] are next.

They lurk within Shadow Hold, its entrance in the northwest corner of [[Jaedenar]]. Deep within the corrupted [[barrow den]]s you'll find powerful [[warlock]]s, and terrifying [[demon]]s.

They must be defeated if these lands are to be saved!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Shadow Hold Mace
|Moonbow
|Purified Jaedenar Amulet
|Shadow Hold Dagger
}}

You will also receive:
*725-7,200 [[XP]]
*{{cost|1|30}}

==Progress==
Do not falter, <name>. Shadow Hold will fall.

==Completion==
The cleansing of Shadow Hold will take much time and effort, but without your defeat of the Shadow Council, it would not be possible at all. Thank you, <name>.
