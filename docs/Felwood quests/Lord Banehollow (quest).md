== Objectives ==
Slay Lord Banehollow.
*[[Lord Banehollow]] slain

== Description ==
Only one final power remains lurking in the depths of Shadow Hold now: Lord Banehollow.

The Shadow Council here serves his whims, and even Fel'dan was a mere instrument for him to prepare this land for another invasion of the Burning Legion.

Proceed carefully, <name>. A dreadlord is a terrifying foe. Stand tall and triumph!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Cleansed Shadow Council Belt|Farlus' Staff}}

You will also receive: {{cost|2}}

== Progress ==
You have returned. Is everything alright?

== Completion ==
Truly incredible, <name>. To journey within the very lair of evil here and slay every fiend that stands before you... I am overwhelmed.

The Emerald Circle thanks you for your work here in Felwood. As for [[Andalar Shadevale|Andalar]], we will send [[scout]]s to rescue him at once. He shall have a hero's welcome.

==Notes==
;Aggro
:{{Text|yell|Lord Banehollow|Pathetic mortal... I will build a new empire atop your corpse!}}

;Death
:{{Text|yell|Lord Banehollow|No... NO! This is my domain! You cannot have... it...}}

After Banehollow's death, [[Arcanist Delaris]] appears and opens a Portal to Wildheart Point.
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Delaris|Beat me to it, I see. Your exit awaits...}}

:It looks like the cultists had their eye on the druids!

:You can see Wildheart Point through the swirling portal. Stepping through it will take you on a one-way trip back to the camp.

:Once your business here is finished, this would be a good way to make a quick exit.

:{{Gossip|Step through the portal and return to Wildheart Point.}}
