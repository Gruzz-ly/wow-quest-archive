==Objectives==
Collect 7 Deadwood Weapons from [[Felpaw Village]].
*[[Deadwood Weapons]] (7)

==Description==
I would prefer to do as much as we can to protect my people from the Deadwood tribe without slaughtering every last one of them. We've taken steps towards this before, and if you wish to prove yourself to the [[Timbermaw tribe]], I would ask you do this as well.

Look for the piles of weapons kept in Felpaw Village to the southwest. Take as many as you find. If we disarm the Deadwood tribe, we may be able to stop some bloodshed later.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Timbermaw Breastplate	
|Timbermaw Bracers
|Timbermaw Leggings	
|Timbermaw Boots
}}

You will receive:
*{{cost||70|}}
*6,550 [[XP]]
*+1,000 [[reputation]] with [[Timbermaw Hold (faction)|Timbermaw Hold]]

==Progress==
Do you have the weapons?

==Completion==
Thank you, <race>. An action like this will go a long way towards proving yourself as an ally of the Timbermaw.

==Progression==
{{Deadwood of the North}}
