==Objectives==
Retrieve the Unusual Flask from the [[Irontree Stomper]]s and bring it to the [[Frostfire Hot Springs]] in {{C|Winterspring}}.
* [[Unusual Flask]]
* Collect Frostfire Hot Springs water

==Description==
I am in need of your help. My flask was stolen from me by the [[corrupted treant]]s of [[Irontree Woods]] in {{C|Felwood}}. The herbal mixture should help with my wounds, but it will not be enough alone. Bring it to the hot springs of Winterspring. The healing waters there will aid in my recovery.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 6,600 [[XP]]
* {{cost||90}}

==Progress==
You have made it, <name>.

==Completion==
Thank you, <class>. You have saved me much time in bringing my flask to me. With this, corruption will spread much quicker.

Unfortunately, this will be the last time that you will be needed.
