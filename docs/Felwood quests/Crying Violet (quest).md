==Objectives==
Collect 8 Crying Violets.
*[[Crying Violet]] (8)

==Description==
We must prepare carefully before assaulting [[Jaedenar]]. The [[magic]] of the [[warlock]]s and [[demon]]s within Jaedenar is strong, and we will need wards of our own before entering.

We need only one more ingredient: Crying Violet, which grows in the hills near the enemy's stronghold to the northwest.

Gather the crying violet, then meet my assistant in the field. He will know what to do next.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||65}}
*575-5,790 [[XP]]

Have you found the crying violet yet, <name>? We need them quickly.

==Completion==
Wonderful. [[Greta Mosshoof|Greta]] chose wisely when she asked you to perform this task. I will work the herbs immediately...

;Description
We must prepare carefully before assaulting Jaedenar. The magic of the warlocks and demons within Jaedenar is strong, and we will need wards of our own before entering.

I have prepared many herbs, and need only one more ingredient: crying violet, which grows in the hills to the south. This flower fluorishes in even these tainted lands, a testament to its strength of purity.

Gather the crying violet for me, but beware the corrupted creatures of the forest. 

;Progress
Speak quietly now, <name>. The crying violet is a sensitive blossom.
