==Objectives==
Kill 15 [[Deadwood]] [[Furbolg]] of any kind in [[Felpaw Village]].
*Deadwood Furbolg slain (15)

==Description==
There is a camp of Deadwood furbolgs directly to our southwest. Corruption permeates the camp, and I wish to put an end to it before they become a problem.

The [[Deadwood tribe]] is evil, but it is the effects of the fel that pollutes their minds. Their hostility is not truly an innate quality, yet they cannot be helped. It saddens me that we must fight our own brethren.

Please, <name> - I ask you to do what must be done. Simply spare me the details; such troublesome images upset me far too much.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Leggings of the Ursa
|Helm of the Pathfinder}}
You will also receive: {{cost|1|40}}

==Progress==
Once you gain the trust of the [[Timbermaw]], I am confident there will be something we will be able to do for you. The Timbermaw do not forget their allies, especially in dark times such as these.

==Completion==
I sense that you have achieved victory.  Victory... such a hollow word considering what had to be done. Regardless, you've proven yourself to be worthy of our trust.

It may take some time before the Timbermaw welcome you without hostility within the Hold. Still, your perseverance will erode any suspicion my brethren may have about you.  So long as you never betray us and raise weapons against us, we will find common ground.

==Notes==
Killing [[Deadwood Avenger]]s and [[Deadwood Shaman]]s count toward quest credit.
