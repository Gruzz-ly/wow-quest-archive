==Objectives==
Fill the vial at the moonwell in [[Whisperwind Grove]] and pour it on the ground between the dead ancient protectors in [[Irontree Woods]].
*Irontree Hill watered
*[[Empty Moonwell Vial]] (provided)

==Description==
The ancient protectors of Irontree Woods to the north have been dead for years, their bodies a grim symbol of the damage to these lands.

Every season, we take the water from this moonwell, and pour it on the ground before them, hoping it will nurture new life. If you'd like, you can deliver the water yourself.

It is an excellent opportunity for reflection. Take this vial and fill it at the moonwell, and pour it on the very top of the small hill between the three ancients.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[XP]]
*[[Money]]

==Completion==
The moonwell water quickly seeps into the ground with a soft glow. A few moments later, a rustling noise is heard, and a small sprout pops up before your eyes.

==Notes==
Before you leave [[Whisperwind Grove]], use the [[Empty Moonwell Vial]] in the moonwell to receive [[Whisperwind Moonwell Water]].

On completion, a [[Seedling Protector]] will appear and begin following you around. The next quest, [[Seeking Soil]], automatically starts.
