== Objectives ==
Speak with Kelnir Leafsong at Bloodvenom Post.

== Description ==
While we dealt with Jaedenar, I sent a friend of mine north to Bloodvenom Post. We used to have infrequent visits from the tauren there, but they have stopped coming as of late.

My friend, Kelnir Leafsong, has yet to return. Would you travel north to check on her and the situation at Bloodvenom?

Should you find her, do be aware... dryads like her tend to strike other races as a bit odd. 

== Completion ==
Oh, hi! Did Farlus send you? I'm so happy he remembered!

Bloodvenom post is all overrun with awful slime thingies, and this poor tauren is the only one left! We've got to help him!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||17}}
