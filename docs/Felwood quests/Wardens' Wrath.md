==Objectives==
Defend Lysander as he works to disrupt [[Lord Hel'nurath]]'s ritual.
*[[Maiev]] signaled
*[[Lysander Starshade|Lysander]] protected
*Speak with Lysander Starshade in Jaedenar

==Description==
Lord Hel'nurath's hubris gave me an opportunity to study what he's doing. I think I found a way to give us an opening to strike.

<[[Arko'narin]] glances at [[Lysander Starshade|her brother]].>

I fear this will take a lot out of Lysander. But I know he'll give it everything he has. Perhaps... perhaps my perceptions have been misplaced.

It is time to put my... our demons to rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 8,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Don't worry over me, <name>. My sister does enough of that already.

Look at the [[moonwell]] instead. It's beautiful...

==Notes==
Up ahead are [[Slain Hel'nurathian Defender]]s and [[Slain Hel'nurathian Cultist]]s. Proceed further to the bridge and speak with Maiev:

{{Dialogue|
It is time for Lord Hel'nurath to meet my blades.

Steel yourself, <name>. We take back what has always been ours. For the kaldorei!

On the bridge, the Lightforge's Blessing buff is given. Lord Hel'nurath is channeling three Legion Portals and is protected by a Fel Barrier. Lysander has a progress bar. Kill the attacking demons (+5%) as Lysander is closing the portals.

:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|If I can just... break... ah! One more, champion! Do not falter!}}
:{{Text|say|Arko'narin Starshade|Lysander! Look out!}}

A cutscene plays out.
