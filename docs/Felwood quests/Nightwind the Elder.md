==Completion==
The heavens, in their countless stars, hold answers to earthly mysteries, <name>.  Might, then, the wise, and the lucky, gaze up and find truth?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Coin of Ancestry]]

==Notes==
Elder Nightwind is found in Jaedenar, at {{Coords|38.3|52.8|Felwood}}, outside of the main area where the humanoids mobs congregate.  Like all elders, he is illuminated by a shaft of light from the sky.  After reaching the end of the long road with the [[Shrine of the Deceiver]] in site, follow the land to the right along the edge of the hill that is lined with ruins.  There are [[Angerclaw Mauler]] in the area as well as some [Ironbeak Hunter], a non-aggressive mob unless attacked.  This Elder gives the locations of [[Elder Skygleam]] and [[Elder Starweave]].
