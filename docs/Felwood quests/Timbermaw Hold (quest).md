==Objectives==
Speak with [[Nafien]] at the entrance to [[Timbermaw Hold]].

==Description==
Okay, I know this is a longshot, but I figure it never hurts to ask.

While I deal with the fallout of all the ridiculous nonsense that just went on here, I need you to go speak to some bears. The Timbermaw furbolg control the forests to the northeast, and they're not too fond of us.

I just need someone to give them the idea the Horde isn't all that bad. Head northeast up the road to Timbermaw Hold--don't go into Felpaw Village--and ask the furbolg outside if they have any favors they'd like done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||18|}}
*1,630 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Timbermaw Hold (faction)|Timbermaw Hold]]

==Completion==
We furbolg are not foolish, <name>. We will not yield Timbermaw Hold to any askers.

However, we are also in dire need of assistance. If you help us, we will grant you our favor and allow you passage.

==Progression==
