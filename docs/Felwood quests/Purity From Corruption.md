The flowers you brought me were the essential ingredient.

;Description
Deep within Jaedenar to the northwest lies [hadow Hold—the main fortress of the Shadow Council.

Protective barriers surround it, projected from demonic braziers. If we are to drive the Shadow Council from Felwood, then those braziers must be extinguished.

This vial has been infused with crying violet and the magic of the wilds. Fill it at the corrupted moonwell in the center of Jaedenar. You will hear my voice when you have done this.

;Progress
Once you have the waters from the moonwell, you will purify it and use it to extinguish the braziers of protection within Shadow Hold.
