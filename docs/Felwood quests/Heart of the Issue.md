==Objectives==
Disrupt 4 Portals to the [[Twisting Nether]] in the depths of [[Shadow Hold]].
*[[Portal to the Twisting Nether|Portals]] closed (4)
*Meet [[Arko'narin Starshade]] in the depths of Shadow Hold

==Description==
I can't believe how much [[Arko'narin Starshade|Nari]] has been through. This perversion of our history, our culture... my family...

<Lysander glances at his sister.>

These [[demon]]s came in here from somewhere. I'm certain the source of their invasion lies in the depths of our barrow den. You and I can put a stop to it.

I won't let this place haunt her any longer, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I will not let my family's legacy wither away.

==Completion==
Lysander... he is determined, I'll give him that. 

And brave. 

Thank you, <name>. Now... it is time to face the leader of all of this.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Champion, [[Arko'narin]] and I will find Lord Hel'nurath. Take the ma... take Lysander with you. Put an end to the demon's minions. Meet with us after you have finished.}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|Yes, [[Warden]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|I am sorry, my friend. I did not realize what this place really was.}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|Long ago, these were [[barrow den]]s. My mother used to rest here when she was called to the [[Emerald Dream]].}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|That must be why my sister came here with her friend, [[Trey Lightforge|Trey]]. To fix this place for my mother and our family.}}

;First portal
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|I can disrupt this portal, but it will require concentration. Please, defend me while I shut it down.}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|My parents told me she was captured. But they were certain she'd return home.}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|And she did. But the sparkle left her eyes. I knew there were things they didn't tell me.}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|Things she didn't tell me.}}

;Second portal
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|Another portal! Protect me, and I will take care of it.}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|I may be young, but I have tasted grief. You have, too. I can tell.}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|Sometimes I feel like that's all Nari thinks we are worth. Mourning.}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|We are more than that. My face bears the scars of our tragedies, but I am not broken.}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|None of us are.}}

;Third portal
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|Blasted portal. Cover me, and I'll tear it down.}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|We need each other. Now more than ever. I hope I can show her that, in time.}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|I know you see it too. It's why you're here, isn't it? For yourself... and for all of us.}}
