==Objectives==
Slap 7 Panicked Workers to make them cap the oil gushers.
*[[Panicking Worker]] slapped (7)

==Description==
Oh for... not again! If you heard the deputy yelling out there, that means we've got a fullblown oil leak on our hands! It's those filthy worgen again!

Listen, it's going to be total chaos out there. Sleep-deprived goblins running around screaming and not knowing what to do. I need you to snap the workers back to their senses.

A good, swift backhand across the face should do it! Once they shake themselves off, they'll get to work capping those gushers!

==Completion==
It's not working! We're going to have to shut it off at the source.

Go talk to the Deputy outside, he'll walk you through it!
