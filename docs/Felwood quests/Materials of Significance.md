==Objectives==
Locate the materials listed in Gregory's Note and return them to [[Gregory]] at the source of [[Bloodvenom Falls]] in {{C|Felwood}}.
*[[Fiery Infernal Core]] (3)
*[[Shimmering Grave Dust]]
*[[Triple-Brewed Molten Lager]]
*[[Symbol of Faith]]
*[[Note from Gregory]] (provided)

==Description==
Each of the Echoing Orbs is attuned to a different aspect of its master and the method you used in {{C|Ashenvale}} to destroy the [[:Althalaxx Orb]] will not be effective on the orb we possess. I know of a ritual that may be able to destabilize the orb and allow us to destroy it, but it requires components with specific magical significance. We already possess some of the required materials, but you'll need to retrieve the rest. Take this, it should help you in your search.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It must have been quite the adventure to obtain these items. Well done.

==Completion==
Now that we have the materials, I must prepare the ritual. For now, consult with Aeonas. He wishes to speak with you.

==Notes==
To start this quest, you must first talk to the [[Silver Hand Charger (Season of Discovery)|Silver Hand Charger]] at the [[Emerald Sanctuary]] in {{C|Felwood}}, then head north to {{co|43|57|Felwood (Classic)}} and use the Climbing Ropes to reach [[Aeonas]] above [[Bloodvenom Falls]]. Speak to him, then to [[Gregory]], and the quest will become available.
