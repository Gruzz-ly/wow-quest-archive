==Objectives==
Slay [[Feronas Sindweller]].
*Feronas Sindweller slain

==Description==
Since reclaiming [[Jadefire Run]] from the [[satyr]], the [[Emerald Circle]] has sent many druids to begin the long task of cleansing the ruins.  Last night, several of them were murdered... by a [[night elf]].

The witnesses say it was a [[demon hunter]], a crazed disciple of [[Illidan]].  A rare sight.  No doubt he's gone mad with power just like his master.

I'll pay top bounty for proof of this murderer's death. He's been spotted just off the road to the north, in a valley beneath Jadefire Run.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||70|}}
* 6,290 [[XP]]

==Progress==
So they sent another?

==Completion==
How noble of you... to blindly kill without question, to come for my head on the barest word of another.

Sheathe your fury and hear my tale first.  You'll see what noble ignorance has done to these lands.
