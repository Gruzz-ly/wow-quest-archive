==Objectives==
Use the Stolen Irontree Explosives to ignite 7 Oil Geysers in [[Irontree Clearing]].
*Oil Gusher ignited (7)
*[[Stolen Irontree Explosives]] (provided)

==Description==
Your pump sabotage has caused pipes to break all over camp. The [[goblin]]s are in a panic over the geysers, and it's about to get worse.

Take the gathered explosives and use them to set the geysers aflame. We're going to do as much damage to the camp as we can, and keep that oil from being used to fuel [[shredder]]s... or worse, [[Horde]] [[warship]]s.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||70|}}
*6,550 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Progress==
Well?

==Completion==
Look at them run... the live ones, that is. Glorious.

==Progression==
