== Objectives ==
Slay 8 [[Talonbranch Defender]]s.

==Description==
Those mangy curs think they can just snoop around my site and get away with it? I'll show them...

And what I mean by that is, of course, that YOU will show them. You and the small army of axe-wielding goblin hires I've sent to Talonbranch Glade.

The place will be swarming with worgen by now. Just where we want them. Head to the southeast, join up with the rest of our forces, and let some fur fly.

== Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||70}}
*6,550 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

==Progress==
You go on now, I've got important strategizing and economy management to do.

==Completion==
Let's hope we put down enough of them to get the message across.

==Progression==
{{Irontree Clearing}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
