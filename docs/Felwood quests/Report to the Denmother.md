==Objectives==
Speak with [[Denmother Ulrica]] at [[Talonbranch Glade]].

==Description==
With the [[goblin]]s scattered and their equipment destroyed, they'll either get the message and leave, or be easy pickings if they choose to stay. We've won here.

You've fought as fiercely as any member of the pack, <name>. Return to the Denmother and let her know of our success. I'll be maintaining my watch.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Fists of the Pack	
|Denmother's Cloak
|Token of the Bond
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|40|}}
*8,150 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Completion==
Let the goblins and all the [[Horde]] know we will not have offers of peace and sanctuary abused... most of all not in our new home.

I am grateful my people have found allies as bold as you, <name>. This reward will represent your bond with our pack. You will always be welcome here.
