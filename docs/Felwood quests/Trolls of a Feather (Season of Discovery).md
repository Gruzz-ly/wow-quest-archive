==Objectives==
Bring a total of 6 Voodoo Feathers from the trolls in [[Sunken Temple (Season of Discovery)|Sunken Temple]].
*[[Amber Voodoo Feather]] (2)
*[[Blue Voodoo Feather]] (2)
*[[Green Voodoo Feather]] (2)

==Description==
My pet is almost done. Now I just need something to stuff it with.

Only the voodoo feathers from the trolls in the sunken temple will do. They go by the names [[Gasher]], [[Mijan]], [[Zolo]], [[Hukku]], [[Zul'Lor]], and [[Loro]]. Kill them. Kill them all.

This is no trivial task <name>, so I'll make it worth your while by giving you something of Niby's -- he probably doesn't need it anyhow.

==Rewards==
You will be receive:
*{{cost|1|45}}
*5900 [[XP]]
*[[Soul Harvester]]
*[[Abyss Shard]]
*[[Robes of Servitude]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the feathers?  This doll needs stuffed!

==Completion==
Wonderful, now my pet is complete!

<Impsy quickly stuffs the doll and gives it a demonic hug.>

Oh, what an odd side effect these voodoo feathers have...

==Notes==
The feathers drop from the [[Atal'ai Defenders]] in the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Season of Discovery)|Temple of Atal'Hakkar]]
