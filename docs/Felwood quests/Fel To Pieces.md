==Objectives==
Collect 9 pieces of Infernal Debris from [[Shatter Scar Vale]].
*[[Infernal Debris]] (9)

==Description==
The [[infernal]]s that lurk in Shatter Scar Vale are formidable, but not invincible. Much progress has been made in thinning their numbers.

Destroying them is only part of the solution, however. I've found that the stone that infernals are made of still contains large amounts of [[fel]] magic even after the infernal's death.

The rubble of slain infernals now litters Shatter Scar Vale, leeching its corruption back into the ground. If you could collect it and bring it to me, I would be grateful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||70|}}
*6,290 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do be sure to pick up after your own kills, as well.

==Completion==
It's good to see someone who cares about keeping the forest clean. Thank you, <name>.

==Progression==
