==Objectives==
Speak with [[Gregory]] to begin the ritual.
*Complete the ritual

==Description==
I wanted to thank you for your efforts, <name>. Without you, I'd likely be dead and the servants of the [[Burning Legion|legion]] would still have possession of this dangerous artifact. I know its{{sic}} difficult to trust an agent of the [[Lich King]], but it is my hope that after this is over we can sway my friend back to the [[light]]. It's clear that the man I cared for is still in there. He may only need a nudge.

Come now, we are needed by Gregory to help him complete the ritual. Let us speak again when it's done.

==Rewards==
You will learn:
*Engrave Bracers - [[Hammer of the Righteous (paladin rune)]]

You will receive:
*5900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Aeonas stares blankly off the cliff edge in obvious shock at what just transpired>

==Completion==
I have no words, <name>.  Seeing Gregory again filled me with a dangerous kind of hope. His nature was laid bare from the moment we reconnected and there were plenty of signs pointing towards this end. I was blind to them.

Please, take this accursed orb and leave me. I have much to contemplate.

==Notes==
Speak to [[Gregory]]:
:{{gossip|I've spoken with Aeonas and he is ready to start the ritual.}}

:{{text|say|Gregory|Grave dust from the resting place of one murdered by those most loved...}}
:{{text|say|Gregory|An elixir of fire, craeated{{sic}} with steady hands and an unsteady mind...}}
:{{text|say|Gregory|A symbol of faith, gifted from one with newly discovered purpose...}}
:{{text|say|Gregory|And the final ingredient... is you, [[paladin]]. "The blood of a would-be hero, unwillingly given, and coldly taken".}}

:{{text|say|Aeonas the Vindicated|Wait... what?! What are you doing Gregory! Stop this at once!}}
:{{text|say|Gregory|Stand clear my friend. This is what must be done. This mission is bigger than one single mortal. Even one as useful as this.}}
:{{text|say|Aeonas the Vindicated|No Gregory, please. This is wrong! I cannot let you do this!}}
:{{text|say|Gregory|Silence Aeonas. That is enough. I must concentrate on the ritual.}}
:{{text|say|Aeonas the Vindicated|No. I will not be silent. I dared to hope that some shred of my friend was left in there, but I can see that hope has blinded me. In the name of the light... I DENY YOU!}}
:''Aeonas attacks Gregory with the light, setting him ablaze.''
:{{text|say|Gregory|Aeonas... no... what have you... done.}}
