==Objectives==
Slay Grolvitar the Everburning.
*[[Grolvitar the Everburning]] slain

==Description==
Land's sakes, pardner! You done shut off those valves but good.

Unfortunately we've had a critical blowout in our gosh-darned central burnoff regulator! Missus Darla's done sent as many workers as she can rustle to go shut it off, but those flames have a mind of their own!

Literally! They're hoppin' up and grabbin' anyone who comes near! So Darla says if you can muster up out of that cave you're in and beat that elemental, she's got a mighty fine prize in store for ya!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Gauntlets of Raw Strength
|Everburning Cloak
|Drilldozer Band}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|40}}
*8,150 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Completion==
Well, my entire operation's nearly been ruined. But you came through in the clinch, <name>.

It could've been worse! I gotta hand it to you.

==Notes==
If you are on a flying mount, Grolvitar may not appear, or he may appear and then immediately despawn. Approach the burning patch of land on foot, or by ground mount.
