# Felwood storyline

[[File:WorldMap-Felwood.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

[[Felwood]] is a level 45-50 landlocked [[contested]] zone in northern [[Kalimdor]]. Players arrive to the southern end from [[Ashenvale]] through a path north from [[Raynewood Retreat]], then proceed north towards [[Timbermaw Hold]].

Interestingly, there are no breadcrumb quests to Felwood from other zones, other than the Hero's Call/Warchief's Command quests, though Alliance at least gets [[A Little Slime Goes a Long Way]] to point them towards the zone.

The progression of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Felwood Quests]].
