== Description ==
It is time to say goodbye now. You have raised me from a seedling, brief though it was, but now I must rejoin the forest.

Take me back to the hill you found me on. There I will set my roots, and grow in the shadow of the ancients that came before me.

Farewell, <name>. Have patience... and if you live long, you may see me again one day.
