After spending the last several quests [[Do the Imp-Possible|doing the impossible]] and [[See the Invisible|seeing the unseeable]], the allies of the [[Emerald Circle]] must '''Break the unbreakable''' hold the [[Jadefire]] have on southern Felwood.

==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Xavathras.jpg|Xavathras|Vile Duke of the Jadefire.}}
Slay Xavathras.
*[[Xavathras]] slain
*[[Claw of Tichondrius]] (provided)

==Description==
With the claw, we are ready to break through the Jadefire's defenses.

Head into the ruins to the northwest. Beyond the frontline of the satyr you'll find a narrow pass heading to their corrupted moonwell. An enormous wall of demonic flame bars the path, but the Claw of Tichondrius should be able to dispel it.

Beyond the barrier you will find the leader of these forces, Xavathras, guarding the corrupted moonwell. Slay him once you are through!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Delaris' Gloves|Glovelettes of Opening|Spellbreaker's Helm|Demon Smasher}}

You will also receive: {{cost|1|30}}

==Progress==
Has Xavathras fallen?

==Completion==
See what can get done with a little cooperation?

I'll make sure the claw is given to people responsible enough to contain such things... assuming it can't be destroyed.

==Notes==
Go past the massive battle between the druids and satyrs until you find a wall of fire. Use the Claw of Tichondrius to break through the fire. Xavathras has a lot of health but otherwise is not much of a threat. 

Like the rest of the quest chain, the name of the quest is a reference to the song "Fight the Power" used in the anime Gurren Lagann.

==Progression==
{{Do the Imp-Possible}}
