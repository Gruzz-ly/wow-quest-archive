==Objectives==
Obtain Kroshius' Infernal Core.
*[[Kroshius' Infernal Core]]

==Description==
The most fearsome demon in Shatter Scar Vale is known as Kroshius. Though many have hunted him over the years, destruction has only made him stronger.

Time after time, warlocks have come to this forest and reanimated Kroshius. He now lurks in the southeast, surrounded by demonic fire, awaiting any who come to try and claim his power.

I will not have this corrupt cycle continue! Kill Kroshius, and bring his infernal core to me.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Shadow Curse Hood
|Whisperwind Armbands
|Infernal Breastplate
|Warlockbane Shield
}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|40|}}
*7,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The core must be kept away from Shatter Scar Vale.

==Completion==
This foul chunk is what those warlocks sought year after year. I will protect it myself, or destroy it if possible, and ensure Kroshius never rises again.

==Progression==
