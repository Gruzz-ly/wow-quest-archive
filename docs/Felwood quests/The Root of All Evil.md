==Objectives==
Plant the Demon Summoning Torch in the mouth of [[Grolnar the Berserk|Grolnar]]'s cave in the Winterfall furbolg [[Winterfall Village|village]]. Defeat the demon and retrieve the Essence of Xandivious for [[Gorn One Eye]] in [[Timbermaw Hold]].
*[[Demon Summoning Torch]] (provided)
*[[Essence of Xandivious]]

==Description==
<Name>, thanks to you we have devised a way to summon forth the root of all evil for the [[Winterfall tribe]] - the corrupting demon that dominates them!

Take this torch to the mouth of Grolnar's personal cave and plant it there. Doing so will force the demon to reveal itself and investigate. This is when you and your allies must strike it down! Only the essence of the fallen demon will begin the lengthy healing process of the Winterfall tribe... and the salvation of [[Timbermaw Hold]]. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*8170 [[XP]]
*[[Defender of the Timbermaw]]

==Progress==
You have returned to us, <name>... does this mean that the demon has been slain? 

==Completion==
You've... you've saved us! Your defeat of the demon [[Xandivious]] has ensured the safety of [[Timbermaw Hold]] for years to come. &nbsp;You are truly a hero amongst our kind.

Please, accept this with our blessing. Though the healing process will be slow amongst the furbolgs - and the conflict will still go on - you have given the Winterfall something they never had before this day.

They have a chance at survival.
