==Objectives==
Slay 12 [[Jaedenar]] Forces.
* Jaedenar Forces Slain (12)

==Description==
The [[Shadow Council]] perpetuates the corruption of this land. At [[Jaedenar]] in the northwest, they worship the [[demon]]s of the [[Burning Legion]], and work to open the path for their masters to return to [[Azeroth|this world]].

The grounds are patrolled by [[Jaedenar Hound]]s, [[Jaedenar Guardian|Guardians]], [[Jaedenar Adept|Adepts]], and [[Jaedenar Cultist|Cultists]] - thugs that act as lookout for the more vile forces beneath. They will be the first to die so that these forests may no longer suffer!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||65}}
*5790 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How goes your fight, <name>? I know the shedding of blood as proof of honor can be disgusting to some, but it must be done if this land is to heal.

==Completion==
Good, <name>! With their numbers weakened, we can soon begin our assault on their forces deep within Shadow Hold. 

==Progression==
{{Wildheart Point}}

==Beta version==
