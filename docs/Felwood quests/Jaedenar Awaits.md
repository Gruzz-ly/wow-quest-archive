==Objectives==
Deliver the Arcanist's Herbs to [[Greta Mosshoof]] at [[Wildheart Point]].
*[[Arcanist's Herbs]] (provided)

==Description==
The cultists you saw guarding the claw were members of the [[Shadow Council]], foul [[warlock]]s behind nearly every attempt to bring demons into [[Azeroth]].

North of here is [[Jaedenar]], named in worship of [[Kil'jaeden|Kil'Jaeden]]{{sic}} himself. Deep beneath it stretches [[Shadow Hold]], a former [[barrow den]] and the Shadow Council's own stronghold on Azeroth.

Take these herbs north to Wildheart Point, on the east side of the road. Greta Mosshoof will need them for her plan to purify Shadow Hold for good. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||7}}

==Progress==
Greetings, <class>. What brings you here?

==Completion==
Ah, just what I was expecting. With these herbs, our preparations for Jaedenar are nearly ready.
