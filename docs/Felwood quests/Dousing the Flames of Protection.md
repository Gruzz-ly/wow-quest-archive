==Objectives==
Use the Purified Moonwell Water to douse the four Braziers of Protection within [[Shadow Hold]].
*Extinguish the [[Brazier of Pain]]
*Extinguish the [[Brazier of Malice]]
*Extinguish the [[Brazier of Suffering]]
*Extinguish the [[Brazier of Hatred]]
*[[Purified Moonwell Water]] (provided)

==Description==
The braziers are spread throughout Shadow Hold.

Enter the tunnel into Shadow Hold, and follow it through the underground passageways. Douse each of the brazier's flames and the protections the [[Shadow Council|Council]] has set up will fall for at least a short period of time.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Belt of the Lost Barrow|Jade Green Spaulders|Sanctuary Pauldrons|Emerald Orb}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|30}}
*725-7,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The braziers must be extinguished if we are to stop the Shadow Council once and for all.

==Completion==
With the braziers gone, the [[druid]]s of the [[Emerald Circle]] can enter Shadow Hold and clear out the last of the cultists. In time, it may even be used as the [[barrow den]] it once was.

You have my thanks, <name>. Please take this reward.
