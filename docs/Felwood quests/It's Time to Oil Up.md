==Objectives==
Use Darla's Grapple to collect [[Irontree Oilcan]]s and use them to oil 7 Irontree Shredders.
*Shredder oiled (7)
*[[Darla's Grapple]] (provided)

==Description==
Three things come out of Irontree Clearing: lumber, oil, and exhausted workers. The first two are pretty much the cause of the third, but I like to be efficient about things where I can.

I've got our shredders working triple unpaid overtime, and there's really nowhere in the schedule for them to get maintenance.

Use this grappling hook to nab some of the extra oil cans floating around camp and use them to oil up the shredders, would you?

==Completion==
Efficiency in the workforce! Wonderful.

Maybe I should check on the goblins inside those shredders later.
