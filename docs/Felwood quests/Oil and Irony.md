==Objectives==
Sabotage the [[Master Control Pump]] at the bottom of [[Irontree Cavern]].

==Description==
I plan to use the goblin's greed and pollution against them. Any further despoiling of the land they have already carved here will be worth it to stop their further spread.

Deep within Irontree Cavern, just below us, runs many pipes to pump oil through the ground across the entire clearing. These pipes are attached to a master control pump in the very back of the cavern.

Enter the cavern and sabotage the pump. The ensuing havok will give us opportunity for our final strike.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||70|}}
*6,550 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Completion==
You flip a few switches on the pump and crank a large handle all the way to the right. There's a shuddering rumble in the nearby walls.

==Progression==
