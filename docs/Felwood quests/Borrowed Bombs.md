== Objectives ==
Collect 8 Irontree Explosives from Irontree Cavern.
*[[Irontree Explosives]] (8)

==Description==
The workers in Irontree Cavern below us have been driven out already. Something else has overtaken the cave.

This works in our favor. I spotted at least a few of them dropping explosives as they fled... explosives we'll need for the next part of our plan.

Enter the cave and salvage any abandoned bombs you can find. When you're finished with that and the pump, we'll begin our final assault.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Irontree Cloak	
|Oilfoot Slippers
|Alton's Leggings	
|Breastplate of Protest
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|40|}}
*8,150 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Progress==
Was I right? How many did you find?

==Completion==
Perfect. I've had the pack gather explosives from the rest of the camp as well, and with these, we'll have just enough to get things started once the oil is flowing.
