==Objectives==
Slay 7 Panicking Workers.
*[[Panicking Worker]] slain (7)

==Description==
Sad little cowards... look at them flee in panic!

Don't let it fool you, <name>. The second they've regained their wits, those [[goblin]]s are going to spend every waking moment chopping this forest to bits and sending the pieces to the [[Horde]]'s war effort.

Don't give them the chance. Kill the workers throughout [[Irontree Clearing]] without mercy... show them their greed has a price!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||70|}}
*6,550 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Progress==
Staying your hand? Nobility will get you nowhere with goblins.

==Completion==
Serves every last one of them right. Let's hope those in charge send the rest of their greedy scavengers somewhere else.

==Progression==
