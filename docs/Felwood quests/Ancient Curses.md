==Objectives==
Meet Maiev Shadowsong in Felwood.
*Meet [[Maiev Shadowsong]] in [[Felwood]]

==Description==
Thank you for answering my call so quickly, <name>.

[[Demon]]ic corruption has seen a resurgence in Felwood recently. [[Tyrande]] sent out a contingent of [[Sentinels]] and [[Kaylessa Duskwhisper|one of her own priestesses]] to investigate the matter further. None have returned.

Tyrande asked the [[Watchers]] to look into the matter--and Maiev has asked for your assistance personally.

We need to make haste to Felwood, and see what Maiev has discovered.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
May [[Elune]] guide us all to victory in this forsaken place.

==Completion==
I will fill you in on what we need to do, <name>.

But first, let me put my friend to rest.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Arko'narin Starshade|All that pacing is making me nervous, brother.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Lysander Starshade]]|Nari... I do not know if I am ready for this.}}
:{{Text|say|Arko'narin Starshade|You're the one always telling me to be strong in the face of adversity, Lysander.}}
:{{Text|say|Arko'narin Starshade|I don't have time to sit here and reassure you.}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|I wasn't asking for--I'll... I'll be fine{{sic}}}}
:{{Text|say|Arko'narin Starshade|Let's go.}}
:''Arko'narin and Lysander mount up their hippogryphs and fly away.''
:{{Text|say|Arko'narin Starshade|Meet us in Felwood, champion. We will be waiting for you there.}}

Either take the portal in [[Stormwind Harbor]] to [[Darkshore]] or in the [[Eastern Earthshrine]] to [[Mount Hyjal]], then fly to [[Jaedenar]]. The area is phased with new mobs and NPCs - [[Jaedenar Adherent]]s, [[Jaedenar Scoundrel]]s, [[Jaedenar Warrior]]s, [[Feltouched Ancient]]s, [[Feltouched Conjurer]]s, [[Feltouched Trickster]]s, and [[Felborn Imp]]s. There are also [[Slain Sentinel]]s.

Approach Maiev, Arko'narin, and Lysander.

:''Maiev is kneeling beside the corpse of Kaylessa.''
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Another lost, when we've lost so many already.}}
:{{Text|say|Arko'narin Starshade|Did she... fall like the others?}}
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Yes. The trail leads to here. The [[moonwell]] nearby has been tainted by a foul corruption. Arko'narin, champion, I'll need your assistance to clear the area.}}
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|And you as well, mage.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|May Elune welcome you into her embrace, sister.}}
