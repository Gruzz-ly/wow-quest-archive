==Objectives==
Slay cultists occupying Jaedenar in [[Felwood]].
*Kill enemies in [[Jaedenar]] (15)
*Meet [[Maiev Shadowsong]] at the entrance to [[Shadow Hold]]

==Description==
This place... it was once so important to my family. That is why I agreed to come--and why [[Lysander Starshade|Lysander]] wanted to come along as well.

<[[Arko'narin]] glances over at Lysander before looking back at you.>

Even after the horrors of [[Teldrassil]], my brother still tries to do everything he can to help others. Much like you, <name>.

Come. We must eliminate the threat that these power hungry cretins pose. I think you are just the kaldorei for the job.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you thinned their numbers, <name>?

==Completion==
Good work, <name>.
