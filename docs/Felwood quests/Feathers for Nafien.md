==Progress==
While you have proven yourself to me, you may need to continue to work toward proving yourself to the suspicious brethren of my tribe.  To that end, I may be able to continue assisting you.

Some of the Deadwood furbolgs wear a distinctive headdress that may be used as a means of proof in thinning their numbers.  Bring me a feather from any headdresses you acquire; for every set of five you bring me, you will earn recognition amongst the Timbermaw.
*[[Deadwood Headdress Feather]] (5)

==Completion==

Remember to bring any of the feathers you find to me.  I will continue to accept them as long as necessary.
