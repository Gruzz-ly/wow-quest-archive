==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Vorlus.jpg|Vorlus|Warden of the nether, he holds the key you seek.}}
Use the Phaseblood Potion at the [[Sigil of Tichondrius]] to shift into the nether, and search for the Claw of Tichondrius.
*[[Claw of Tichondrius]]
*[[Phaseblood Potion]] (provided)

==Description==
I've added a drop of my very own essence to the ooze. Look for a glowing sigil to the west, at the edge of [[Shadowlurk Ridge]]. Stand on it, concentrate, and pour this stuff all over yourself. It should be enough to shift you into the nether and let you see what's REALLY there.

You won't be alone... the satyr's treasure is being guarded by the biggest voidstalker they could summon. Defeat him, and the treasure is yours.

And come back in one piece, or this crazy broad's gonna fry me! 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||65}}

==Progress==
Can you hear me in there, <name>? Do you have the claw?

==Completion==
{{questportrait|Arcanist Delaris.jpg|Arcanist Delaris|Stand still now.}}
The Claw of Tichondrius...

You hold a piece of the very demon that led the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] to these woods, <name>. Better for it to be in our hands than with the satyr.

Hold still. I'm going to pull you back to our plane and make sure you and the claw arrive here safely...

==Notes==
Go south-west of the camp to Shadowlurk Ridge, and before you get to the imps, the fel-green sigil will be to the right at {{coords|40.95|75.75|Felwood}}.  Do NOT follow the quest arrow, as that leads to an unreachable ledge to the north.
