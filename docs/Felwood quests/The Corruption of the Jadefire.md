==Objectives==
Slay 12 [[Jadefire Satyr]] or [[Jadefire Felsworn]] in [[Jadefire Glen]].
*Jadefire Glen satyr slain (12)

==Description==
The cleansing of this forest has been a grueling process. For every success we have achieved, a new challenge has arisen.

The Jadefire satyr have been a constant nuisance. They seek to corrupt the forest just as we seek to cleanse it. Now, we have taken steps to begin eradicating them from Felwood entirely.

Travel to Jadefire Glen to the west and rid the forest of their presence. You'll find the entrance just north of the walls of Deadwood Village; look for their vile banners.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||65|}}
*5,540 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Jadefire Glen is our first target in a series of coordinated efforts.  The others will be dealt with in time.

==Completion==
The [[Emerald Circle]] thanks you, <name>. If we all work together here, we can purge these demons from our midst.

==Progression==
{{Emerald Sanctuary}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Changed faction. Moved from Eridan Bluewind to Tenell Leafrunner.}}
