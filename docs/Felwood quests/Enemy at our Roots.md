==Objectives==
Slay 8 Irontree Choppers.
*[[Irontree Chopper]] slain (8)

==Description==
The [[goblin]]s are already upon us!

We have tried everything in our power to warn the goblins to leave [[Irontree Clearing]] before we resorted to violence. As they turned a blind ear to us, we struck, and now rather than spare the forest they would lay down their lives for greed.

They will soon know the full extent of our fury! The battle rages just beyond our northern gate. Join our pack in glory and slay any goblin who dares come before us!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

==Progress==
Do not loiter too long, <class>. If I smell fear, your role in the pack will not be pleasant.

May their blood water our tree. You fight well, <name>.
