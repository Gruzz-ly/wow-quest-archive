== Objectives ==
Use Delaris's Prism to terrify 20 Jadefire Imps.
*Imps terrified (20)
*[[Delaris's Prism]] ''(provided)''

== Description ==
Before you go...

I've taken advantage of my "alone time" with Impsy here to learn some interesting facts about imps. Specifically, he ended up telling me the one thing that all imps fear most. Something they're absolutely terrified of.

I thought that sounded useful as well as interesting, so I've done some basic conjuring. This prism will project an image of... well, of what Impsy described.

Shadowlurk Ridge is still swarming with imps. Why don't you go test their reaction for me? 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Gold Pot Gloves|Cheerful Shoulders|Rainbow Band}}

{{itembox|You will also receive: {{cost||65}}|Rainbow Generator}}

== Progression ==
Having fun?

==Completion==
I see... their eyes are open.

<Delaris smiles with bemusement.>

Maybe I'll keep Impsy around after all. He's got a lot to teach me...

== Notes ==
Head back to the ridge and use the prism near imps.  The vision of an imp's gut-wrenching terror is... a bright and happily colorful rainbow?

The imps will usually emote when they scream.
