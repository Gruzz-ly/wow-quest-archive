==Objectives==
Kill 10 Ironwood Buzzers to feed the Seedling Protector.
*[[Ironwood Buzzer]] slain (10)

==Description==
<The tiny seedling opens its leaves wide, like a baby bird waiting to be fed. It speaks in a very faint voice:>

Hungry... want... bugs...<You can hear the buzzing of wasps to the south. Could they be what the little thing wants to feed on?>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||70|}}
*6,290 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The seedling pats its stalk with a rooty arm, as if full. It looks to have grown a bit, too!>

==Notes==
The zone map may mark this quest as being available from [[Whisperwind Grove]] before it actually is, possibly because it is "unlocked" by the appearance of the Seedling Protector rather than by an explicit prerequisite.
