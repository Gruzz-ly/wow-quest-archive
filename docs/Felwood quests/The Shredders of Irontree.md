==Objectives==
Kill 9 Irontree Shredders.
* [[Irontree Shredder]] slain (9)

==Description==
Disgusting, isn't it? Look at them. Pathetic little things that can't even toil with their own bodies.

They stomp around in their massive metal [[shredder]]s, carving the forest to splinters. I bet they think they're safe in there, all warm and cozy.

Prove them wrong. Blaze north through the camp and destroy as many shredders as you can. Once you've spilled some blood, we're going to take this place apart for good.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||70|}}
*6,290 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]
*[[Gilnean Banded Crate]]

Is the attack complete?

==Completion==
This is but the first strike.
