==Objectives==
Use the Incanter's Tome on 6 [[Fel]]touched [[satyr]] corpses.
*[[Satyr]] corpses neutralized (6)
*Meet [[Maiev Shadowsong]] at the entrance to [[Shadow Hold]]
*[[Incanter's Tome]] (provided)

==Description==
I cannot thank you enough for your help with this, <name>. I knew I had to be here to help [[Arko'narin Starshade|Nari]] when she told me about this mission.

It seems as though my skills are needed, just as I thought. The [[magic]] here is foul and all-corrupting. It must be contained.

Please, take this book and read the incantation within after putting the satyr around [[Jaedenar]] to rest.

Jaedenar need not be a place of death and corruption any longer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Please, <name>, you must make sure to cleanse the fel energies that seep from the satyr's corpses.

==Completion==
These satyr... were [[Sentinels]]? Whoever committed this atrocity will pay!

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both

:''The party proceeds further.''

Kill [[Feltouched Conjurer]]s and [[Feltouched Trickster]]s and use the provided tome on their corpses, which makes the [[Spectral Sentinel]] briefly appear from the bodies.
