==Objectives==
Observe [[Lysander Starshade|Lysander]]'s facial marking ceremony.
*Take your position
*Witness the facial marking ceremony
*Meet Lysander near the [[Stormwind Embassy]] in [[Stormwind City]]

==Description==
Traditions should not hold us back, <name>. They should inform the future.

<[[Maiev Shadowsong|Maiev]] looks at Lysander before turning her gaze back to you.>

I have let my perceptions hold me back as well. No more. I am tired of seeing rifts between our people, regardless of what they use to better themselves or the world.

It is time I give Lysander his marking. The [[kaldorei]] are no strangers to change. Our traditions should adapt to our lives, not define them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I can't believe it, <name>! I can't believe it!

How... why...? Today will go with me for all of eternity. Thank you.

==Notes==
Stand in the targeted area and click on the Observe the Ceremony extra action button.
