==Objectives==
Navigate through Shadow Hold with Maiev Shadowsong, dealing with threats along the way.
*Speak with [[Maiev Shadowsong]]
*[[Felflame Brazier]]s extinguished (6)
*Discover what lurks in the depths of [[Shadow Hold]]

==Description==
Their ranks have been thinned, and their corpses cleansed. You have done well.

<Maiev shifts her weight, looking towards the path leading into Shadow Hold.>

Come, <name>. We must find what lurks below and put an end to it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Not now, <name>.

==Completion==
We no longer need the element of surprise.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Maiev
:{{Gossip|quest=|Let's put a stop to this, Warden.}}
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Stay close and be silent, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|I will shroud us from their eyes.}}
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Arko'narin, mage, stay with our champion.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Arko'narin Starshade]]|As you command, Warden.}}
:{{Text|emote|[[Lysander Starshade]] gives you a nod.}}

Arko'narin and Lysander follow the adventurer, as Maiev goes forward. Follow her. When near her, the adventurer has the Warden's Vigilance buff. In case you distance from Maiev:
*{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Are you looking to get caught, killed, or tortured? Get over here.}}
*{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Do not ruin our mission, <name>.}}
*{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|What do you think you're doing, <name>?}}
*{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Watch your footing, champion.}}

;Passing the tunnel into the first chamber
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|Are you all right, Nari?}}
:{{Text|say|Arko'narin Starshade|Yes. I just... I remember this place well.}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|I'm sorry it's been spoiled for you. Mother loved it here, didn't she?}}
:{{Text|say|Arko'narin Starshade|It's not... it's fine, Lysander. Let's just go.}}
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Keep your eyes sharp, Arko'narin.}}

;Approaching the braziers
:{{Text|emote|Maiev Shadowsong points at the nearby Felflame Brazier.}}

Enemies include [[Hel'nurathian Felmaw]]s, [[Hel'nurathian Imp]]s, [[Jaedenar Warrior]]s, [[Hel'nurathian Felguard]], [[Hel'nurathian Conjuror]]s, and [[Hel'nurathian Trickster]]s.

;Attacking the enemies
:{{Text|say|Arko'narin Starshade|I will make them regret returning here.}}
:{{Text|say|Arko'narin Starshade|They'll never see it coming.}}

;Approaching the cages
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Is this where they held you?}}
:{{Text|say|Arko'narin Starshade|Yes. Over there... in those cages.}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|Wait--Nari, this is where you were captured? I didn't know--we never should have come back here.}}
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|I have felt the walls of confinement close in as well, Arko'narin.}}
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|But you are free, now. Your path is your own. That it led you to the wardens is a boon to the kaldorei, and to me.}}
:{{Text|say|Arko'narin Starshade|Thank you, Warden. That means a lot.}}

In the cages are dead [[Slain Sentinel]]s. Proceed further into the tunnels.
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|Nari... I'm sorry. Why didn't you tell me what this place really was?}}
:{{Text|say|Arko'narin Starshade|Because I do not need you worrying over me. Come on.}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|...let's go, champion.}}

;Past the room with candles
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|Warden... do you have any siblings?}}
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Have you not heard of [[Jarod Shadowsong]]?}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|My apologies, history was never my strongest subject.}}
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Do not apologize. There were many days where I suspect he would have appreciated being forgotten.}}
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|He was not as... outspoken as you. Nor was he keen to lead. But lead us he did--to victory. Long ago.}}

Proceed to the bottom.
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Hush now. We have found our prey.}}
