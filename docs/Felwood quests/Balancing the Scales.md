==Description==
The time for subtlety is over. [[Lord Hel'nurath]] has made himself known to us... and I will not rest until I see him slain.

<[[Maiev Shadowsong|Maiev]] clenches her teeth.>

Ready yourself, <name>. Together we will show these demons why they should fear the [[kaldorei]].

We will not rest until Shadow Hold has been cleansed of this foul corruption!
