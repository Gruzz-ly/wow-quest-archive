== Objectives ==
Speak with Arcanist Delaris at the Ruins of Constellas.

== Description ==
The Emerald Circle is sworn to accept the help of any who wish to fight the demons of Felwood. Though my people have long shunned the arcane, we cannot afford to deny ourselves such advantage here.

Arcanist Delaris, a surviving Highborne mage, helps us battle the Jadefire satyr. Follow the road to the north, and you will find her at our encampment overlooking the Ruins of Constellas.

If you wish to help cleanse Felwood, follow her requests as you have mine. 

== Completion ==
There is little time for talk, <class>. The druids fight valiantly against the satyr, but fel sorcery blocks their path.

Luckily, I have a plan...

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||7}}

==Progression==
{{Emerald Sanctuary}}
