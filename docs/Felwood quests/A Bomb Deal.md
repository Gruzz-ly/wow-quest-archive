==Objectives==
Collect 8 Irontree Explosives from [[Irontree Cavern]].
*[[Irontree Explosives]] (8)

==Description==
All my workers got driven straight out of the cavern here by those big swamp-lookin' things! Darla's sent me here to pick up the pieces, but have you seen it in there? I ain't goin' in!

There's a ton of explosives left behind that we can't just leave layin' around.

I'll make you a deal: You run in there and get those explosives gathered up, and I will stay here and not get killed by swamp-things, and if you don't either, I'll pay ya! How's that sound?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|40|}}
*8,150 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
We had a deal, right? Right?

==Completion==
Hey, nice! I'll just take those... carefully...

Don't go tellin' the workers I didn't have the guts to go down there myself, you hear? Here's your pay... and a little somethin' extra.
