==Objectives==
Obtain Ran Bloodtooth's Skull and Dartol's Rod.
*[[Ran Bloodtooth's Skull]]
*[[Dartol's Rod]]

==Description==
I'm certain that the long-dead [[wizard]], [[Dartol]], intended to use his rod to subjugate and destroy us just as the [[Night elf|night elves]] and [[orc]]s have, but I think now we'll put that thing to an unintended use.

[[Ran Bloodtooth]] is the king of all of the [[Ashenvale]] furbolg. His tribe, the [[Bloodtooth tribe|Bloodtooth]], are the most powerful and keep themselves secluded in a camp just to the east.

Kill them all and bring back his skull. Let us see if we can put it to good use.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||20|}}
*2,100 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Have you slain Ran yet, my friend? We must have his skull if you're to deliver my people from bondage.

==Completion==
You have done well, my friend.

Now quickly, hand me Ran's skull. While his essence yet taints it, we shall fashion it upon Dartol's Rod giving you the power to influence my brethren and deliver them from evil!
