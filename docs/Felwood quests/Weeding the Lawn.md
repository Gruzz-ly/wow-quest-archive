==Objectives==
Pull up 7 Whisperwind Lashers to check them for corruption.
*[[Whisperwind Lasher]]s checked (7)

==Description==
In a place like this, even something as simple as growing flowers and pulling weeds can require some heroic effort.

The orchid lashers that grow on all sides of the grove are a sign of healing. But they're not flawless; some of them do succumb to demonic corruption now and then.

I've found the best way to check is to just pull them up. If they're normal, they'll wander around a bit and reroot themselves. If they aren't... well, you'd better be ready for a fight!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Floral Pantaloons
|Puregrove Spaulders
|Weed Puller's Bracers
|Thornward Greaves
}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|40|}}
*7,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Checking the lashers will really help me here.

==Completion==
It's hard work, but it's so rewarding when you see them growing up big and strong.

When they're not covered with demonic thorns, that is!
