==Objectives==
Use the Swiftwind Switch to collect 5 Talonbranch Wisps.
*[[Talonbranch Wisp]] captured (5)
*[[Swiftwind Switch]] (provided)

==Description==
I have toiled long here with [[Denmother Ulrica|the Denmother]] to spread the teachings of [[Cenarius]] and the ways of the wild. She has gained much of my trust, and in return, I have been allowed to introduce the spirits of the forest to her students. The company of [[wisp]]s is a great honor, as well as a useful blessing.

But now the goblins descend on us, and seek to steal the wisps for nefarious use. Please, prevent this [[Blasphemy|blasphemy]]!

Call the wisps back here from the western woods with this blessed branch, and keep them safe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||70|}}
*6,550 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Have the wisps been saved?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Now the Horde will not be able to defile these poor spirits to aid their brutish ways.
