==Objectives==
Collect 10 Crude Tarballs from [[Oily Sludge]]s.
*[[Crude Tarball]] (10)

==Description==
Last time we had an oil leak this bad, the oil itself tried to get away!

I don't know what does it, maybe all the demon goop floating around here, but when we get a big enough crude leak half of it globs together and tries to run away.

That's profit trying to escape! Go run after those oil sludges and bring back their sweet, precious oil!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||70}}
*6,550 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

==Progress==
That stuff better not still be moving when you bring it back here.

==Completion==
Thank goodness the oil is safe! Well done, <name>.
