==Objectives==
Speak with Arko'narin Starshade to learn about [[Jaedenar]].
*Speak with [[Arko'narin]]

==Description==
[[Tyrande]] suspected there was something foul happening here in [[Felwood]]... and she was right.

Her priestess, [[Kaylessa Duskwhisper|Kaylessa]], was sent here to purify the [[moonwell]] from the [[fel]] corruption that plagues this land, in an effort to reclaim that which belongs to us.

Now we have lost one of our sisters and the moonwell still remains corrupted. We cannot let this stand. We will finish what Kaylessa started, and heal the moonwell.

Arko'narin has history with this place. I will let her tell you why we are here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 3,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you spoken with Arko'narin yet, <class>?

==Completion==
It is time to put our skills to use, <name>.

==Notes==
Speak with Arko'narin:
{{Dialogue|
As Warden Maiev said, we're here to clear this place of those that unrightfully claim it.

This place was once touched by [[Elune]]'s blessing. The moonwell must be purified, and the [[demon]]ic stain upon this land driven out.

:{{Text|say|Arko'narin Starshade|Nicer? There's a reason she and Father wouldn't let you come here, brother. This place was already far gone by the time you were born.}}
:{{Text|say|Arko'narin Starshade|Like everything else, I suppose.}}
:{{Text|say|Lysander Starshade|Nari, don't. We can fix this. This place reeks of foul magic--like it has been overrun--}}
:{{Text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|This place is riddled with [[satyr]]. You need not meddle with the [[arcane]] to see it. Simply open your eyes and look.}}
