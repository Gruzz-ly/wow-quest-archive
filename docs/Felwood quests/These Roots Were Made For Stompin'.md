== Objectives ==
Slay 10 [[Irontree Stomper]]s.

==Description==
There's so many other spirits still trapped in rotting bodies here...

Do you see? The irontree stompers, in the north. They're sick with demon-stuff and icky with mold. Poor spirits inside them can't get out.

You can help! Chop them down, and the spirits can get out. I'll put the spirits in me and we can all be happy together when I grow up. Will you help? Please?

Bigger and bigger, with room for each friend...
