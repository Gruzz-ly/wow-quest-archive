==Objectives==
Bring the Mannoroc [[Echoing Orb]] to [[Katherine the Pure]] in [[Stormwind]].
*[[Mannoroc Orb]] (provided)

==Description==
<[[Aeonas]] says nothing, he merely hands you the orb and turns away>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4700 [[XP]]
*[[Whisper (mace)]]

==Progress==
Welcome back, <name>. What is that you have there...

Oh my.

==Completion==
That is quite the troubling tale. The part of me that is a [[paladin]] finds it impossible to reconcile that he willingly consorted with a member of the [[scourge]]... but the [[human]] part of me understands how strong the bonds of friendship can be.

I thank you for bringing the orb here. I will see that it is stored in the deepest vault we have for now.

Oh, One last thing, I had this repaired and had hoped to present it to Aeonas on his return. I think he would want you to wield it in his stead.
