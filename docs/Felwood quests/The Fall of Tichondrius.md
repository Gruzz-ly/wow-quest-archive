== Objectives ==
Relive [[Illidan Stormrage|Illidan]]'s battle with Tichondrius.
*[[Tichondrius]] defeated

== Description ==
Yes, Illidan took the power of the [[Skull of Gul'dan]] for himself.

But did he flee with it into the night? Did he use it for his own glory? No... his very first action was to use his new power to assault the [[dreadlord]] Tichondrius!

Witness his triumph, <class>. Witness how Illidan reclaimed [[Felwood]] from the [[demon]]s... and the thanks he was given. 

== Completion ==
Do you see now? For doing what was needed to drive the demons from these lands, my master was banished.

Now these [[druid]]s pick up the pieces, patting themselves on the back for scrubbing the remaining vestiges of the [[Burning Legion|legion]]'s forces.

But that is not why I killed them.
