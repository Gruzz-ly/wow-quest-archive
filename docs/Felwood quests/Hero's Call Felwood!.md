==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Tenell Leafrunner}} at the [[Emerald Sanctuary]] in [[Felwood]].

==Description==
By order of his royal highness, {{NPC||Varian Wrynn||King Varian Wrynn}}, all able-bodied citizens of the [[Alliance]] are to report to Tenell Leafrunner at the Emerald Sanctuary.

His order requires your help to redeem Felwood from the [[demon]]ic influences that rule the forest. Head north from [[Ashenvale]] and follow the road into Felwood until you reach the Emerald Sanctuary. 

For the glory and honor of the Alliance!

==Completion==
There is much work to do here. The forest is on the mend, but without our help, it will take generations to restore this once-sacred wood.
