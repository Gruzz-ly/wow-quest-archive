== Objectives ==
Collect Kitty's Eartag from Winna's Kitten.  
*[[Kitty's Eartag]]

==Description==
Mr. Tauren here's told me a lot about what happened at Bloodvenom Post. He says Winna Hazzard is still there!

She's pretty far gone, but what's left of her is making a bunch of new slime. We've got to stop it!

Luckily, I have a plan. Mr. Tauren said Winna used to have a kitten. She fed it corrupted slime water and it ran off into the woods. I saw something lurking to the southeast just past the Bloodvenom Tower, but it sure was bigger than a kitten! Go see if the kitty has a tag... 

==Progress==
Did you find the kitten?

==Completion==
Poor little kitty, suffering out there in the woods for so long! You did a good thing for it, <name>. And probably for all the travelers it's been eating.

This tag will be handy... 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|70}}

==Progression==
{{Bloodvenom Falls}}
