==Objectives==
Slay 12 [[Jadefire Shifter]]s in [[Jadefire Run]].
* [[Sindweller Blindfold]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that you've had a lesson in keeping an open mind, perhaps you'd like to learn WHY I killed those [[druid]]s.

The answer is simple: They are not druids at all.

[[Demon]]s still roam the ruins, now hiding in plain sight in the guise of friendly caretakers. See for yourself...this blindfold is soaked in demon blood. Take it north up the hills to Jadefire Run and place it on your eyes. It will show even the most oblivious fool the true nature of any demon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||70}}
* 6,290 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Don't tell me you would leave the demons to walk among us unopposed?

==Completion==
Enough! Your enthusiasm is impressive, but foolish. Gazing through the veil for too long without practice will break your mind.

The rest will be mine, <name>. For now, I summon you back to me.
