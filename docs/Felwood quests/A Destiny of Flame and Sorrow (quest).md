==Objectives==
[[File:IllidanFelwoodQuest.jpg|thumb|Reliving Illidan's battle with Arthas.]]
Relive Illidan's battle with Arthas.
*Arthas defeated

==Description==
My kind has always been hated for what we do... despised outcasts, accused of corruption beyond redemption.

Yet if it was not for a demon hunter, these very woods would be the greatest stronghold of the Burning Legion on Azeroth. I speak of my master, Illidan Stormrage, the "Betrayer".

See for yourself. See what occured{{sic}} here when Illidan was first freed, and the demonic forces of the dreadlord Tichondrius ruled this forest completely unopposed... 

==Rewards==
You will receive>
*{{cost||70|}}
*6,290 [[XP]]

==Completion==
And so my master set out to find the skull... risking his own life against an army of demons to find the source of corruption in Felwood. Imagine if he had not! Imagine what these woods would look like if the Skull of Gul'dan had continued its work, undisturbed...
