== Objectives ==
Collect 8 [[Entropic Essence]]s from [[Entropic Horror]]s in [[Shatter Scar Vale]].
* [[Entropic Essence]] (8)

==Description==
Though we druids shun the demonic powers infesting this land, it must still be confronted.

Shatter Scar Vale to the south seethes with corruption. The energies there are so chaotic that they manifest as violent entities, pure fel magic given form to lash out at all life.

I have been keeping a close eye on these chaotic beasts, and studying their strength. I need to make sure they are still weakening with time. Bring me the essences they drop, so I may ensure they are diminishing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||70|}}
*6,290 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Be wary with the essence. It is as poisonous as it is powerful.

==Completion==
I can tell just from the size of these that the fel taint is healing. Slowly... but significantly.

Thank you, <name>. I will ensure these are properly purged.
