==Objectives==
Bring the Broken Sentinax Beacon to [[Warmage Kath'leen]] in [[Deliverance Point]].
*[[Broken Sentinax Beacon]] (provided)

==Description==
This device appears to be used to relay messages to the large [[Sentinax|demon ship]] up above. Unfortunately, it is cracked and unresponsive.

Perhaps someone at Deliverance Point will know more about these beacons.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The Legion uses these beacons to communicate with their fleet up above. If we were to find more of these...

==Notes==
;On completion
:{{text|say|Warmage Kath'leen|These beacons send requests for backup directly to the Sentinax. That could be dangerous.}}
:{{text|say|Warmage Kath'leen|However, if you're looking for a fight -- or. if your looking for [[Nethershard|nethershards]] -- using these beacons might not be a bad idea.}}
:{{text|say|Warmage Kath'leen|Just be careful, <name>. Too many reinforcements from one Sentinax, and your might find yourself in a fight you can't win...}}

==Patch changes==
