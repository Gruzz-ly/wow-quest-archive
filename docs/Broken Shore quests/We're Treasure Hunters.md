==Objectives==
Look for the rumored treasure on the [[Felrage Strand]].

* Felrage Strand treasure

==Description==
I have a feeling you're just using me for tips on where all the best treasure is. From now on I'm [[naga]] tell you anything. Did I say, "naga" just then? I meant to say, I'm not gonna to tell you naga. I mean nada! Darn it!

Okay. Seems you got me on this one. I'll tell you what, fetch me whatever is in that chest near those naga freaks and I'll make it worth your while.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|19|40|}}
|Sightless Tormentor's Tome
}}

==Progress==
You fetch that treasure yet?

==Completion==
This is it? You sure you didn't find anything else? Like a giant pile of gold on top of a statue made of diamonds which was holding a scroll listing the combination to the vault in [[Ironforge]]? That would have been pretty sweet.

Oh well. I can make this into a paper weight or throw it at a [[squirrel]].

Come back tomorrow, I'll have another job for you.

==Gains==
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

== Notes ==
The Sandy Treasure Chest{{coords|75.74|21.72|Broken Shore}} is right by the water, beside a [[Felrage Skrog]] that you'll have to kill if you don't have any trapping or stunning abilities.  You should be able to see [[Grossir]] to the southeast.

Inside is the [[Ancient Shard of Binding]].
