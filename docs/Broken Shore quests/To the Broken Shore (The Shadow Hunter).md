==Objectives==
Take the [[Glaive of Vol'jin]] to [[Spiritwalker Ebonhorn]] at the [[Broken Shore]].
* [[The Glaive of Vol'jin#To the Broken Shore]] (provided)

==Description==
Da Broken Shore be where I fell in battle. We were overrun, [[demon]]s everywhere. [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] was doing what she could, but [[Thrall]] was down and I had fallen. It was horror.

And now I need ya to take me back dere. Take me glaive to da battlefield, call to me, and I will come. Perhaps if I be in da spot where me blood was spilled, we might shine some light on dis mystery.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I may be ancient by your standards, but I lack the raw power [[Talanji]] wields. You may wish to stand back, as this will be the first time I have attempted to conjure a [[Ghost|spirit]] that was this powerful.

==Notes==
Ebonhorn and [[Baine Bloodhoof]] are on the [[Screaming Cliffs]].

Speak with Baine (not necessary for the quest):
:I remember the [[Battle for Broken Shore|battle]] on these [[fel]] stained shores. I lost many friends to the endless forces of the [[Burning Legion]].

:Things were set in motion that day that would affect not only [[Azeroth]], but every world the Legion touched.

:{{Gossip|What happened to Vol'jin at the battle of the Broken Shore?}}
:''A cinematic plays.''
