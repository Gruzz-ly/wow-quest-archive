==Objectives==
Retrieve the [[:Waterlogged Handmaiden's Gloves]] from the [[Wrath of Azshara]] on Mythic Difficulty, then treat them.
* [[Oiled Handmaiden's Gloves]]

==Description==
[[Queen Azshara]] and her handmaidens are the subjects of many a tragic tale. Her power and her hubris lead her badly astray but, even so, her handmaidens are loyal to her to this day. There is power in such a thing. 

The Wrath of Azshara is an abomination but, truthfully, it is actually one of her handmaidens who willing gave her life to protect her queen. Few know this. The [[Ancient Wisp (Val'sharah)|Ancient Wisp]] knows this truth and if you take it to battle the Wrath of Azshara, you may find the handmaiden's gloves. Restore them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You need to battle the Wrath of Azshara and find and restore a pair of handmaiden's gloves.

==Completion==
These gloves have an air of sadness about them, do they not? Regardless, thank you for restoring them and bringing them here.

==Progression==
{{Wisp-Touched Elderhide}}
