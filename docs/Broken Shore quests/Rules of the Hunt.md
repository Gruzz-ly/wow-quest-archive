== Objectives ==
* [[Wrathblade Honor Guard]] slain (8)
* [[Xargraxach]] slain

== Description ==
: {{text|say|[[Thisalee Crow]]|[[Goldrinn]] needs our help! A demon decided to cheat the hunt by bringing in backup. Let's give him a taste of his own medicine!}}

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
* 25 [[Legionfall War Supplies]]
* Varies
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

== Completion ==
: {{text|say|Thisalee Crow|Thanks for the help! Those demons are like gnats compared to Goldrinn, but with so many of them, who knows what could have happened...}}

== Notes ==
You will probably want to go down the slope to Goldrinn first, as there are four Honor Guards there also attacking him. Take them out and then focus on Xargraxach. After that, head back up the hill and kill four more Honor Guards on the way.

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 7.2.0|note=Added.}}
