==Objectives==
*Speak with [[Zipp Fizzlebonk]]
*[[Kraken Egg|Eggs]] broken (6)

==Description==
:{{text|say|[[Archmage Khadgar]]|We seem to be having a problem with over-sized eggs... well, not with the eggs per se, but the [[Kraken Spawn|kraken]] hatching from the eggs.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Normally I'd let nature take its course... however, I'd prefer not to fight an army of [[kraken]] ''and'' the [[Burning Legion]] at the same time!}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* Varied reward
* [[Legionfall War Supplies]] x 25
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

==Progress==
;Zipp Fizzlebonk
:Salutations, <class title>!

:As you may already know, this place is more than just a naval graveyard... it's also a massive breeding ground for kraken!  I mean just look at all this incubation!  It's spectacular... and perhaps slightly dangerous.

:Since you're here to destroy the eggs before they hatch, perhaps you'd enjoy my newest, relatively-safe invention:

:I call it... the [[Egg-Sploder]]!

:It almost works perfectly most of the time!  What do you say?

:{{gossip|Sure, I'll give it a shot.  What could possibly go wrong?}}

: {{text|say|Zipp Fizzlebonk|I should warn you that the Egg-Sploder does occasionally cause kraken eggs to hatch instead of explode.  A meager price to pay for the convenience of technology, right?}}

==Completion==
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Well done! With the kraken threat neutralized, we can focus our efforts on defeating the Burning Legion.}}

==Notes==
*The World Quest starts upon entering the [[Forlorn Depths]] area, the waters south of the [[Broken Shore]].
