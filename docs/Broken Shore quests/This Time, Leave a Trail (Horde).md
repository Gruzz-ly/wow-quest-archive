==Objectives==
Rappel down into the cave, then follow [[Lilian Voss|Lilian]]'s instructions.
*[[Rappel Point|Rappel]] used
*[[Fel-Infused Gunpowder Cache (Broken Shore)|Felfire Explosive]] picked up
*[[Felfire Explosive]]s placed (4)
*Gunpowder lit

==Description==
Here goes nothing, Shadowblade. If anybody can pull this off, you can! ...Probably. Just use the rappel point behind me to get into the cave.

What? Don't make that face. I'll give you more instructions once you're in the cave.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|38|80|}}
*20,560 [[XP]]

==Completion==
That couldn't have gone better if I had done it myself. Good work, Shadowblade.

==Notes==
[[Stealth]] is mandatory for this quest, but beware the [[Felhound]]s, which can detect stealthed targets. Don't forget to also use [[Sap]] and [[Distract]] as needed.

Once you've planted the explosives, kill one of the [[Volatile Felblaze]]s to light the gunpowder trail.

;Quest accept
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Alright, use the rappel point. Down you go!}}

;Rappelling down
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|When you reach the ground, you'll see a barrel. It's full of the fel-infused gunpowder you... acquired.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|By the way, unless you're looking for a fel blade in the back, you might want to avoid being seen in here.}}

;Gunpowder cache retrieved
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Good. The next step is simple--just get out of this cave without being seen. The gunpowder will do its job.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Actually, one more thing. Plant some explosives around for a little extra "boom".}}

;Placing explosives
:''While placing the explosives, the rogue [[adventurer]] overhears a conversation...''
:{{text|say|[[Gerax'rul]]|The eve of our attack is nigh. Have you summoned the forces?}}
:{{text|say|[[Barshagax]]|I will notify the summoners shortly. They will open the portals on my word only.}}
:{{text|say|[[Drak'thezzar]]|Good... once they are through, the foolish "[[Armies of Legionfall|Legionfall Offensive]]" will stand no chance. Their demise shall be delivered.}}

;Explosives placed
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Alright, the job's almost complete. Just get out of the cave and light the powder with the match [[Fleet Admiral Tethys|Tethys]] gave you.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Hold on... that drunken buffoon forgot, didn't he? You better find a way to light this powder, Shadowblade. I will not let this mission fail!}}

;Gunpowder lit
:''The gunpowder lights up fast and travels deep into the [[Lost Temple]]. A surge of demons are seen attempting to flee, but fail to escape.''
:{{text|say|Fleet Admiral Tethys|*sniff* That was... right beautiful, matey.}}
