==Objectives==
Look for the rumored treasure outside the [[Tomb of Sargeras]].
* Tomb of Sargeras treasure

==Description==
I said to myself over and over, "Don't go near the citadel. Don't go near the citadel." But what did I do? I went to the citadel. Almost had my hands on that sweet treasure chest before I got chased off by a bunch of crazy [[demon]]s. I made it out of there with just my helmet and my life!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|19|40}}
|Potion of Potion Drinking
}}

==Progress==
I'm always lookin' for more treasure!

==Completion==
Did you bother to read the label on this potion? I'm going to assume, no. You may find some sucker who will pay you for it.

Better luck next time kid.

==Gains==
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

== Notes ==
The Grandiose Treasure Chest{{coords|67.61|16.17|Broken Shore}} is at the northern side of the Tomb, in front of a wall fountain.  Go to the left of the raid entrance and past the [[meeting stone]], the [[Cathedral of Eternal Night]] entrance, and the broken bridge to [[Suramar City]].  If you stick close to the tower wall, the [[Felblade Devastator]]s shouldn't aggro you.

: ''You find the chest, but [[Treasure Master Iks'reeged]] has beaten you to it again.''

: ''The demon runs off.  All that's left is [[Mysterious Potion (quest item)]].''

== Progression ==
{{The Treasure Master's Lair}}
