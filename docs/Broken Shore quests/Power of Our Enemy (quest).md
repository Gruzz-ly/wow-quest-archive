== Objectives ==
* Unleash Eastern Fel Tower
* Unleash Northern Fel Tower
* Unleash Southern Fel Tower

== Description ==
: {{text|say|[[Illidan Stormrage]]|The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] is attempting to repair a [[fel reaver]] using an unstable ritual. Go, disrupt their efforts, and turn their own energies against them.}}

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
* 25 [[Legionfall War Supplies]]
* Varies
* +75 reputation with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

== Completion ==
: {{text|say|Illidan Stormrage|Intimidation is a weapon of the Legion. Intelligence is not.}}

== Notes ==
At the [[Dark Stockades]] are the three towers with an orb of Raw Fel inside to destroy. Unless someone got to the towers just before you did, you will have to kill [[Xorothian Fel Knight]] guards and a [[Xorothian Cultist]] inside. Inside the north tower is [[Zuriwa the Hexxer]] and her [[observer]]s [[Xul'rath]] and [[Kol'rath]].

Once you get to all three orbs, a cutscene plays as the uncontrolled energy blasts from the towers and destroys the fel reaver.
