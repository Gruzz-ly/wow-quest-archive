==Notes==
Triggers at [[Soldier's Torment]] on the Broken Shore. Supplies are scattered mostly by the water, and can be looted from [[Wyrmtongue Scavenger]]s. The Felwing Devourers can be killed normally, or you can use the [[Salvaged Spear]]s imbedded in the sand to buff yourself with the special action button Explosive Spear for one minute, which will oneshot them.
