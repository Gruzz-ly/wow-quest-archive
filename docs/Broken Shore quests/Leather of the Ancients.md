==Objectives==
Obtain 100 pieces of [[:Ancient Dreadleather]] from humanoids in [[Broken Shore]].
* [[Ancient Dreadleather]] (100)

==Description==
<Name>, we are going to need high quality leather to work with. Ancient Dreadleather is the best hereabouts and local tanning techniques were exceptional in the past. To the untrained eye, it may look like normal dreadleather. That is where the wisp comes in. 

Many of your enemies across Broken Shore will have some amount of ancient dreadleather. As you defeat them, you will start to recognize armor made from it and you can harvest the leather for our purposes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Keep your eye out for ancient dreadleather. We will need a good amount for our purposes.

==Completion==
That is, indeed, dreadleather. Should be enough for our needs, <name>. My thanks!

==Progression==
{{Wisp-Touched Elderhide}}
