==Objectives==
Something unexpected has interrupted your discussion, deal with it!
*Assist [[Jace Darkweaver]]

==Description==
I was serving aboard the [[airship]] that crashed on the way to the [[Broken Shore]]. I must have blacked out as the next thing I remember was being jolted awake. I was on a broken land and above me stood a [[eredar|man'ari]] carrying a staff of darkened crystal. There is no mistaking it, that staff was [[T'uure, Beacon of the Naaru|T'uure]]!

All my life I've heard stories about how T'uure flowed with the healing power of the [[light]]. Somehow the crystal has been darkened by [[demon|Man'ari]]. We must get it back and restore it to its pure form!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,050 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Completion==
You seek a demon with a staff of crystal? The Eredar that calls itself [[Lady Calindris]] has one that matches your description perfectly.

She's MY prey though! I've been chasing her minion all over [[Broken Isles|the isles]] and I'm not about to let this opportunity pass.

I could use someone to watch my back though. If you help me out I'd be willing to let you take this staff you seek. I don't care about her equipment, it's her soul that I'm after.

Well, what do you say?

==Notes==
On accept, a cutscene begins.
:''Alora is talking to the player and [[Vindicator Boros]], when suddenly she turns around and points northwest.''
:{{text|say|Alora|Prophet's mercy! What is that?!}}
:''An [[inquisitor]] called [[Subjugator Valith]] slowly floats down the pathway.''
:{{text|say|Subjugator Valith|What are you filthy mortals doing near the master's portal? I'll rip the answer from your souls!}}
:''Valith begins draining the souls of Alora, Boros and the player with a crackling stream of fel energy. The camera pans up and to the right to show Jace Darkweaver kneeling atop a pillar before throwing his glaive at the inquisitor to interrupt its foul magic and then leaping down to face it in combat.''

The cutscene ends. Boros and Alora are kneeling on the ground.
:{{text|say|Vindicator Boros|Go deal with that demon, <name>! I'll tend to Alora.}}
:{{text|yell|Jace Darkweaver|You won't escape me this time, Valith! Tell me where your master is and I may grant you a quick death!}}
Boros casts a "Greater [[Blessing of Protection]]" on Alora before rushing to aid Jace against the subjugator. Upon killing the inquisitor, Jace walks over to stand near one of the torches.
:{{text|say|Jace Darkweaver|Sinu a'manore. You were fortunate I was in the area. What brings you to this forsaken place?}}
