==Objectives==
Look for the rumored treasure in the [[Creeping Grotto]].
*Creeping Grotto treasure

==Description==
I feel like they're still crawling all over me.  I squished one egg and all of a sudden I'm covered head to toe in baby [[spider]]s.

<Shivers>.

That treasure is just sitting there now.  The next guy better not be arachnaphlipic... arachnaphonetic?  Arachniphant?  Afraid of spiders!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Cubic Zirconia]]
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

==Progress==
I'm always lookin' for more treasure!

==Completion==
Oh, look here! You went and got that treasure! Hey... You still got a spider on your shoulder.

Lets see what fantastic treasure you brought me... This is it? This is worthless! Here you keep it.

Tough break, kid. Keep at it.

==Notes==
What you're looking for is the Spider-Covered Treasure Chest{{coords|43.44|31.39|Broken Shore}} above ground at the Creeping Grotto, to the north.  

: ''You find the chest, but the [[wyrmtongue]] [[Treasure Master Iks'reeged]] is already rooting through it.''
: {{text|say|Treasure Master Iks'reeged|Too late!  I already took the good stuff!}}
: ''The demon runs off.  All you find in the chest is [[Potentially Precious Gem]].''

''Complete:''
: {{text|say|Excavator Karla|Come back later.  I might have another job for you.}}

After completing the quest, the next one will be available the next day.
