== Objectives ==
* Spotter locations [[Flare|flared]] (5)
* [[Prowling Shadowstalker]] slain (6)

== Description ==
: {{text|say|[[Illidan Stormrage]]|[[Huntmaster]], gather your flares. Beasts of the shadows are controlling vital ground for the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]. Reveal these creatures so that our archers might rain destruction down upon them.}}

== Rewards ==
* 25 [[Legionfall War Supplies]]
* Varies
* +150 reputation with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

== Completion ==
: {{text|say|Illidan Stormrage|Impressive. Even the most powerful of magics can be undone with the right tools.}}

== Notes ==
Down along the [[Infernal Causeway]] and a bit in [[Impsorrow Approach]] are [[Hunter's Mark]] arrows wandering around in spots. Just flare those spots and a quest version of the Prowling Shadowstalkers will die to a hail of arrows.

There are also the Prowling Shadowstalker mobs that are stealthed; these are the ones that you have to kill. Use Flare or traps or however you want to aggro them. One good indicator that they're close by is a [[Fel Houndmaster]] wandering around.

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 8.1.0|note=''[[Legion]]'' World Quests for the [[Highmountain Tribe]], [[Nightfallen (faction)|Nightfallen]], [[Army of the Light]], and [[Argussian Reach]] now reward increased reputation.}}
* {{Patch 7.2.0|note=Added.}}
