==Objectives==

* [[Deepsurge]] [[Naga]] slain (25)

==Description==
:{{Text|say|[[Archmage Khadgar]]|The naga pose a persistent threat to our efforts. We've subdued one of their brutes to use against them. Ride it into battle against the naga!}}

== Rewards ==
* 25 [[Legionfall War Supplies]]
* Varies
* +75 reputation with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

==Completion==
:{{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Well done. Turning the might of those big bruisers against their own was a... smashing idea!}}

==Notes==
*The world quest starts upon entering the [[Felrage Strand]] on the [[Broken Shore]].
*Kill: [[Deepsurge Tidesinger]]s, [[Deepsurge Punisher]]s and [[Deepsurge Defender]]s.
* The mobs you kill can only be looted if you dismount the Punisher. You can run back and get another one, but obviously this is easier and quicker if you can fly.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.2.0|note=Added.}}
