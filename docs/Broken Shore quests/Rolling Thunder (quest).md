:Oh, am I glad ta see ya!  Our brothers and sisters're fightin' down tha ramp, but they're out of brew!

:These [[Stampeding Felsteed|confounded beasts]] are stampedin' through, so we cannae roll the barrels down without someone...

:That gives me an idea...

:{{gossip|What's the plan?}}

::Simple!  Ye ride down on tha barrel.

::With yer fancy foorwork ye can dodge tha stampede an' deliver the brew!  As me master always said: 'If ye can dodge a horse on a barrel, ye can dodge a punch.'

::Me trainin' was... exotic.  Look, just hop on tha barrel, keep rollin' till ye reach the patrol, an{{sic}} watch out for the horses on the way down!

::{{gossip|What's causing the stampede, anyway?}}

:::Do I look like a [[warlock]] to ye?  I haven't the foggiest clue why.  Maybe this is some sort o' seasonal stampede, where the dreadsteeds are a-runnin for a migration, or matin' season, or runnin' from somethin'...

:::Or maybe they're just runnin' through here to stop us from easily deliverin' our brew!

:::{{gossip|Fair enough.}}

*{{text|say|Weary Brewmaster|We might not have been able to hold out much longer. Many thanks, <class>.}}
