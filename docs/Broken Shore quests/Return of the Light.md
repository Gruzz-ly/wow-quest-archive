==Objectives==
Accompany [[Jace Darkweaver]] through the portal and obtain [[T'uure, Beacon of the Naaru]].
*Travel through the Portal on Darkstone Isle
*Obtain T'uure

==Description==
Excellent!

There is a gateway further down this pathway and like most [[Burning Legion|Legion]] constructs it is powered by souls.

I think the death of that [[Subjugator Valith|Inquisitor]] should be just enough to activate it and open the way back to where it came from.

Let's go see where the path takes us, shall we?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|46|20}}
|T'uure, Beacon of the Naaru
}}

*22,600 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Progress==
So you were able to become acquainted with the Demon Hunters? This is good, we may need their assistance in the war to come.

==Completion==
It is T'uure! I had thought it was lost to us forever!

When I last saw this staff we were escaping from a small world called [[Niskara]]. The Legion came upon us unawares, we were only able to escape thanks to a few brave [[Vindicator]]s who remained behind with T'uure to stall their attack.

I did not think it could be done, but you were able to recover T'uure. You truly walk in the [[light]], <name>. You have my respect, and my thanks.

==Notes==
On accept, Jace begins running up the pathway to the portal. [[Alora]] and [[Vindicator Boros]] are following close behind.
:{{text|say|Jace Darkweaver|Let's get going. The portal is just ahead.}}
Right before entering the portal:
:{{text|say|Vindicator Boros|And so we enter the lair of the beast. May the Light protect us!}}
:{{text|say|Alora|There are others trapped inside. Please, rescue them if you can. Thank you again, <name>!}}
:''Boros walks into the gateway while Alora teleports herself away.''

Upon entering the gateway, you arrive in the hold a large Legion ship on [[Niskara]] and are placed in a single-player scenario.

===Stage 1: Heal Vindicator Boros===
:''You've emerged upon a ship of the Burning Legion to find your allies have become seperated{{sic}} in battle. Help Vindicator Boros recover from his injuries.''
*Heal Vindicator Boros to full health.

When you enter, you are surrounded by the corpses of [[Felflame Trickster]]s and [[Wrath Invader]]s. Boros is kneeling, wounded, a short distance in front of you, just in front of a barrier of fel magic. On approach:
:{{text|say|Vindicator Boros|<Name>! Bless the Light, you made it! This place is crawling with evil!}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Boros|Jace went to scout ahead, but when these demons attacked and put up this barrier, we were separated. He's still out there!}}

Upon healing him to full health:
:{{text|say|Vindicator Boros|Thank you, champion. With my strength renewed, I am able to dispel this foul magic.}}

===Stage 2: To the Rescue===
:''Follow Vindicator Boros and assist Jace.''
*Assist Jace Darkweaver.

Follow Boros as he disables the barrier and runs to the northwest.
:{{text|say|Vindicator Boros|Come, hero! Jace was heading this way.}}

In the northwestern chamber, Jace is busy fighting a [[wrathguard]] named [[Commander Xovoth]].
:{{text|yell|Vindicator Boros|We fight at your side, [[demon hunter]]!}}

After healing Boros and Jace through the fight, the next stage begins.

===Stage 3: Breaking Out===
:''Assist your allies and escape the hold of the Burning Legion ship.''
*Destroy the [[Anchoring Crystal]]
*Exit the lower levels of the Legion Ship.

:{{text|say|Jace Darkweaver|Thank you, friends. I admit, I doubted you'd survive the demon's trap, Boros. Thought it would be just me and <name> now.}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Boros|My wounds were severe, but <name> arrived just in time.}}
:{{text|say|Jace Darkweaver|They closed the gates to the upper levels. <Name>, use your holy magic to destroy the anchoring crystal. That should open our way.}}

After destroying the crystal, Jace and Boros begin running up the ramps to the upper level.
:{{text|say|Jace Darkweaver|Excellent! Now let's get out of here.}}
:{{text|yell|[[Lady Calindris]]|What is that noise? [[Captain Naranoth|Naranoth]]! If you allow another jailbreak, I'll strand you on this pathetic rock and leave you to rot!}}
:{{text|say|Jace Darkweaver|Be on your guard. I sense a powerful demon ahead.}}

===Stage 4: A Friend in Need===
:''Open the cage to free the captured prisoner and defeat Captain Naranoth.''
*Rescue [[Bo'ja]]

:{{text|say|Vindicator Boros|If you had faith in the Light, demon hunter, there would be nothing to fear!}}

On the upper level of the ship, a [[jungle troll]] [[mage]] named Bo'ja has been trapped in a cage surrounded by four {{NPC||Felflame Trickster}}s.
:{{text|say|Jace Darkweaver|A prisoner! We could use her help, <name>. Free her!}}
Interact with the Legion Cage to free Bo'ja.
:{{text|say|Bo'ja|Taz'dingo! T'ank ya for gettin' me outta dere!}}

===Stage 5: What Evil Comes===
:''Defeat Lord{{sic}} Naranoth.''
*Defeat Captain Naranoth

Suddenly, Captain Naranoth, a massive [[doomguard]], appears in the center of the area.
:{{text|yell|Captain Naranoth|No more escapes on my watch!}}
Bo'ja, Boros and Jace immediately begin to attack the demon.
:{{text|yell|Vindicator Boros|The Light has come to vanquish you, demon!}}

Upon getting Naranoth to 50% health:
:{{text|yell|Captain Naranoth|Infidels! Submit to my will, or DIE in the flames of the Legion!}}

===Stage 6: The Den of Evil===
:''Defeat Lady Calindris with the help of your allies.''
*Defeat Lady Calindris

After defeating the doomguard, Bo'ja, Boros and Jace quickly run to the other side of the area but pause in front of the exit of the ship.
:{{text|say|Bo'ja|Many t'anks again, mon, for gettin' me outta dere!}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Boros|We seek the leader of this den of horrors, an [[eredar]] called Lady Calindris.}}
:{{text|say|Bo'ja|Aye, she be outside directin' her demons ta load up more captives. I be havin' a score to settle wid her, so if ya be aimin' ta take her out, count me in!}}
The three run outside.
:{{text|say|Jace Darkweaver|Come, let's move before we encounter anymore surprises.}}

Once outside, two groups of {{NPC||Felsoul Swarmer}}s attack the party. Once these have been defeated, the group runs down to the central lower area, where Calindris stands with the corrupted T'uure.
:{{text|say|Jace Darkweaver|Our prey stands before us! We must strike now, before she can summon her defenses!}}

Aggroing Calindris:
:{{text|yell|Lady Calindris|Are you truly so stupid? You presume to challenge an eredar sorceress of the Burning Legion?}}

Keep Boros, Jace and Bo'ja alive with your healing spells, lest they become Gravely Wounded and unable to fight. When Calindris summons mirror images of herself, [[Mass Dispel]] them out of existence.

;Loss
:{{Text|emote|Vindicator Boros falls to one knee, gravely wounded.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Vindicator Boros is [Gravely Wounded] and cannot fight until healed!}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Your allies have fallen! Lady Calindris retreats!}}

At around 12% health, Calindris casts "Shadow Strangle" to stun your companions, forcing you to fight the eredar by yourself.
:{{text|yell|Lady Calindris|I grow tired of this! Be consumed by the darkness!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Calindris|It's just you and me now, little priest! Your pathetic Light won't save you!}}

As the fight progresses, T'uure begins to absorb the holy magic of the priest's spells.
:{{text|yell|Lady Calindris|No! My staff is absorbing the Light! Damn you, priest, and your accursed magic!}}

Once Calindris reaches 1% health, she is engulfed in holy magic as T'uure slips from her grasp.
:{{text|yell|Lady Calindris|My staff... it senses the Light within you! What is it... Nooooo!}}
:''Calindris dies.''

===Final Stage: The Beacon Relighted===
:''With Lady Calindris dead the staff is now yours. Take it and leave Niskara.''
*T'uure obtained.
*Leave Niskara

Upon being freed from Calindris' spell, Bo'ja, Boros and Jace become engulfed in pillars of "T'uure's Light", which heals them for 20% of their maximum health every 2 seconds. The three of them run over to stand at the eastern side of the area.
:{{text|say|Jace Darkweaver|Such power! I feel the demon's essence infusing every fiber of my being!}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Boros|I fear for your soul, demon hunter. It's not too late! Turn to the Light and be cleansed of your corruption!}}
:{{text|say|Jace Darkweaver|Spare me your platitudes, [[paladin]]! [[Draenei|Your people]] know well the horrors that the Legion plans to unleash.}}
:{{text|say|Jace Darkweaver|The Legion must be stopped, and I will do everything in my power to make it so. NOTHING is more important than their destruction!}}

After retrieving T'uure, Bo'ja walks a few yards south to open a portal back to [[Dalaran]].
:{{text|say|Bo'ja|You two can yell at each other later! It be time ta get outta dis place!}}

Upon taking the portal, you automatically exit the scenario. Head over to the [[Antonidas Memorial]] in the northwestern part of the city to find [[Moira Thaurissan]], [[Alonsus Faol]] and [[Velen|Prophet Velen]] waiting for you.
:{{text|say|Alonsus Faol|Look! <Name> has returned!}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|This champion shows talent!}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Well done indeed!}}

Speak with Velen to turn in the quest.
