'''Minion! Kill That One Too!''' is a summons from [[Daglop]], [[Tehd Shoemaker]]'s [[imp]] minion that the player signed a minion contract with in [[Azsuna]].

== Objectives ==
* Investigate [[Curious Fel Energy]]
* [[Brethkaz the Dominator]] slain

== Description ==
: {{text|say|[[Archmage Khadgar]]|Champion, there is a collection of energy near our camp that seems to be specifically attuned to you. Would you investigate this disturbance?}}

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
* 25 [[Legionfall War Supplies]]
* Varies
* +75 reputation with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

== Completion ==
: {{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Fascinating! Despite the frequency with which we summon forth [[elementals]] and [[demons]], it never occurred to me that the door might swing both ways.}}

== Notes ==
Outside the entrance of [[Deliverance Point]] is the Curious Fel Energy, a sphere-ish mass of fel. Interact with it:

''Accept a summons from an imp?''<br>
''Time Remaining: 30 (seconds)''<br>
(Yes/No)

Accepting will teleport you inside the [[Lost Temple]], where Daglop is waiting. While fighting Brethkaz, Daglop will likely buff you with [[Champion Chow]] if needed. The moment Brethkaz dies, you will be returned to Deilverance Point.

: {{text|say|Daglop|Ah! My Summon Champion spell worked. Minion! We must do battle with another of my former masters up ahead. Get to it!}}
