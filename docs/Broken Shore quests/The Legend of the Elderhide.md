==Objectives==
Capture Ancient Wisps in [[Val'sharah]].
* Capture [[Ancient Wisp (Val'sharah)|Ancient Wisp]]s (3)

==Description==
Leatherworking is one of the oldest forms of craftsmanship in the world. Hides of animals were the first clothing. Legends tell of a particular form of leather curing that has been lost to us in modern times. 

Combining [[magic]] of the earth with some of the finest leathers ever found, this technique has been recreated by yours truly through careful analysis and my understanding of style. 

To begin, you must capture some ancient wisps to channel the exact [[nature]] [[magic]] for the curing process.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found an Ancient Wisp?

==Completion==
Ancient wisps? Beautiful! This is strong start, <name>.

==Progression==
{{Wisp-Touched Elderhide}}
