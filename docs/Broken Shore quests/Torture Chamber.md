== Objectives ==
* Deadwood [[Demon]]s killed (12)
* [[Dying Captive|Captives]] rescued (20)

== Description ==
: {{text|say|[[Prophet Velen]]|Champion, the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] holds our forces captive, torturing them nigh to death. Rescue them... before their [[Light]] fades!}}

== Rewards ==
* 25 [[Legionfall War Supplies]]
* Varies
* +75 reputation with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

== Completion ==
: {{text|say|Prophet Velen|You have saved our forces from a terrible fate. The Light thanks you, hero.}}

== Notes ==
Triggers at [[Deadwood Landing]] just off the [[Broken Shore]]. The demons are [[Vile Soulkeeper]]s, [[Vile Tormentor]]s, [[Volatile Trickster]]s, and [[Bladefury Enforcer]]s.

The main objective is to free captives. While you can do this one at a time by breaking open [[Legion Cage]]s, or killing Vile Tormentors torturing a Wounded Captive, the best way is to find Vile Soulkeepers with a chain of five captives: kill the demon and all five will count toward completion. Once done with that, you can find groups of Volatile Trickster imps to quickly finish off your demon count.
