== Objectives ==
* [[Fire Power Core]] (3)
* [[Water Power Core]] (3)
* [[Earth Power Core]] (3)
* [[Air Power Core]] (3)

== Description ==
: {{text|say|[[Magatha Grimtotem]]|These [[eredar]] are using power cores in their amateurish attempts to bend the [[element]]s to their will. Teach them such powers are ''not'' to be trifled with!}}

== Rewards ==
* 25 [[Legionfall War Supplies]]
* Varies

== Completion ==
: {{text|say|Magatha Grimtotem|Those demons presumed to bind the elements. Fools! They have learned the price of ''such'' an insult!}}

== Gains ==
* +75 reputation with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

== Notes ==
Triggers at [[Soldier's Torment]] on the [[Broken Shore]].

[[Twisted Elementalist]]s  and [[Twisted Felstriker]]s drop the cores. Try to go for the elementalists around the [[infernal]]s (groups of three) as the infernal will simply fall apart, not attack. The felstrikers are melee guards, some of which patrol in pairs.
