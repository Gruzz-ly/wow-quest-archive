== Objectives ==
* Demons stunned in the chasm (50)

== Description ==
: {{text|say|[[Princess Tess Greymane]]|[[Uncrowned|Our rogues]] could use a hand pulling off a mission in [[Lost Temple|this cavern]]. These stun bombs should offer just the advantage they need!}}

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
* 25 [[Legionfall War Supplies]]
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* Varies
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

== Completion ==
: {{text|say|Princess Tess Greymane|Smashing job! Or would "stunning" be more appropriate?}}

==Notes==
You will get a special action button, Arcane Stun Grenades.

*'''Arcane Stun Grenades''' - Inflicts Arcane damage and stuns the target for 10 sec.

You can enter through the cave entrance at [[Felfire Pass]] or drop into it from the large gap above (with slowfall) at [[Moonlight Ascent]]. The easiest thing to do is to fly to the gap and from the edge, lob bombs at the demons below, though you won't be able to feasibly loot any that die.

== Patch changes ==
