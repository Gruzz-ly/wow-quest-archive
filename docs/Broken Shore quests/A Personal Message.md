==Objectives==
Speak with [[Prophet Velen]].

==Description==
The time has come for me to travel to the [[Broken Shore]] and see, for myself, the place where [[Varian Wrynn|my father]] died. 

If I am to be the king my father was... the king [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]] deserves, I must know firsthand the threat my people face. 

Please tell my advisors that I've gone to the Broken Shore. If I told them myself they'd only try and stop me.

I'll wait for you at [[Deliverance Point]]. Farewell.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60}}
*12,340 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Velen listens closely to your words as you tell him of [[Anduin Wrynn|King Anduin]]'s plan.>

The Broken Shore is a dangerous place... far too dangerous to travel alone. But perhaps this journey is necessary for Anduin to find peace.

When the moment is right, I'll inform [[Genn Greymane|King Greymane]] of Anduin's departure. Until then, go and see that Anduin is not alone on the Broken Shore. I trust that you will return him safely.

==Notes==
Travel to Deliverance Point in Broken Shore to pick up the next quest.
