==Objectives==
Look for the rumored treasure deep in the [[Forlorn Depths]].
* Forlorn Depths treasure

==Description==
I haven't told you that I was part of the original landing party when we [[Battle for Broken Shore|lost almost everything]]. I don't care what treasure is left there, I'll never go back to that beach. Never.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|19|40}}
|Soggy Tapestry
}}

==Progress==
I'm always lookin' for more treasure!

==Completion==
It's... Wet. This thing is most likely worthless now.

Is there a good piece of treasure on [[Broken Shore|this cursed island]]? I may not be the brightest tool in the bag, but I'm starting to think this place doesn't really fit my "chance of death versus treasure" ratio.
