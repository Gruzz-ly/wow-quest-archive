==Objectives==
Learn from [[Eliezer Hammerbeard]] how to create "flair and drama" in your wardrobe.
* Listen to Eliezer's manifesto on style.

==Description==
Greetings, <name>. I am a fashion historian and I have astonishing advancements in tailoring, leatherworking, and blacksmithing that I must share with you. Why? 

A true legend is only as good as their ability to form an epic silhouette on the battlefield and--let's be honest--this is not where you shine. 

Speak to me again if you wish to learn.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|83|50}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let me know when you are ready to begin your education. You sorely need it!

==Completion==
Glad I could share the Hammerbeard System of Style and Taste with you. Are you ready to work for your legacy in your chosen profession?

==Notes==
;Speaking with Eliezer

:Before I tell you about legendary crafting, you must first be grounded in a philosophy of style and flair. This is non-negotiable! Are you ready to begin?

:{{Gossip|Let me hear your philosophy on style.}}

:I have some news for you, <name>, everything you've learned about your profession to this point was child's play. There was no challenge to it, no fashion, no style, no grace!<br/><br/>Now, I am not merely a Fashion Historian, young <race>, I am also a philosopher and--I don't mind admitting--something of a style icon in these parts.

:{{Gossip|Do tell.}}

:My patented Hammerbeard System of Style and Taste is a natural philosophy of flair. Impeccably researched, finely tuned, and well tested by yours truly, the HSST philosophy will be underlying{{sic}} apparatus of your education.<br/><br/>The dangers will be many, <name>, but the rewards are beyond your current capacity to understand!

:{{Gossip|Uh huh.}}

:Your hands--delicate but powerful, hardened by battle yet skilled--are the only hands that you should trust to create garments or armor worthy of a hero.<br/><br/>Many of the legends of yore that you read of as a child were somewhat lackadaisical with spell and sword but how they dressed--oh how they dressed! This is why we speak of them still.<br/><br/>Few know this and now you are one of them!

:{{gossip|You've thought a lot about my hands.}} 

:Nevermind that! Think instead of the wasted potential of what you have made thus far!<br/><br/>It isn't all your fault, though you've certainly concentrated on deeds and functionality over style. Under the HSST system, you will remedy these failings and perhaps, at last, have a chance at actually becoming a legend.<br/><br/>The road is hard and full of peril.

:{{gossip|Are you wrapping this up soon?}}

:The impatience of youth.<br/><br/>A craftsperson is only as good as his or her materials and the--let's face it--garbage you've been using thus far is a core reason why you look more like an accountant from Stormwind than a potential legend.<br/><br/>Think ahead--when they make paintings of you, the cut and weight of your clothing or armor will echo through history. Is that not what you've always wished for?

:{{gossip|I'm starting to wish I'd chosen another profession.}}

:You lack appreciation for the gift I am giving you. The gift of a guiding philosophy is one that most go their whole lives without, <name>.<br/><br/><sighs> Look, the point is that you will be judged throughout all time by what you wear and with my research and teaching, you will be able create{{Sic}} legendary things that will set you apart from others. Let us start.

:{{gossip|Let us hope this is worth it.}}

:Now, most importantly: we must decide what type of armor you want to craft. Choose carefully - your commendation only earns you one lesson.

;Leatherworking
*{{gossip|I want to make leather boots.}}<br/>[[The Sentinel's Eternal Refuge]]
*{{gossip|I want to make chain mail gloves.}}<br/>[[Vigilance Perch]]

: ''Are you certain this is what you want to make? You can only choose one legendary item to craft with this Armorcrafter's Commendation.''
: (Accept/Cancel)
