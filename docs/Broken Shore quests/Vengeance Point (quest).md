==Objectives==
Defeat the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] siege on [[Vengeance Point]] and report to [[Izal Whitemoon]].
* Defend Vengeance Point
* [[Abhorrent Felwing]] slain (5)
* [[Crazed Felblade]] slain (4)

==Description==
On my way here, I ran across a squad of [[demon hunter]]s headed northwest to Vengeance Point. You can bet the Legion will try to stop them from establishing a forward position.

I spoke to an [[Night elf|elf]] named Izal Whitemoon. Not the friendliest sort, but I'm sure she'd be grateful if you lent the [[Illidari]] a hand... whether she admits it or not.

==Rewards==

* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

==Progress==
This siege is disabling my bats from their scouting duties.

==Completion==
The Illidari don't waste time on congratulations. There is more to do, and you're the one to do it.

Get a move on.

==Notes==
Once completed the position of the ''[[Sentinax]]'' will be unlocked for the [[Broken Shore]] map.
