==Objectives==
Enter the [[Tomb of Sargeras (instance)|Tomb of Sargeras]] and defeat Kil'jaeden.
*Defeat [[Kil'jaeden (Tomb of Sargeras tactics)|Kil'jaeden]]

==Description==
Once he was as a brother to me. Then he bartered the soul of [[Argus|my world]] for his own power. Hounded [[Draenei|my people]] across the [[Great Dark Beyond|stars]]. Twisted [[Rakeesh|my son]] into a monster.

Now he has come to oversee the [[Third invasion of the Burning Legion|final assault]] on [[Azeroth]]. To end this world as he has [[Burning Crusade|countless others]].

[[Kil'jaeden]].

We must ensure he does not escape our grasp this time, <name>. Storm the tomb. Break the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s hold. End the Deceiver's reign.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
+1,500 reputation with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

==Progress==
Give no quarter. The Deceiver must fall.

==Completion==
When we faced the Deceiver, millennia of rage flooded my heart. Hatred took hold, blinding me to every thought but revenge.

Thankfully the [[Light]] helped me see that the future must not be defined by vengeance, but by hope. Your courage showed me that as well, <name>.

In those last moments of Kil'jaeden's life, I had to let go of the past. Not only for my own sake, but for the memory of my son.

My spirit and mind are clear and focused. Now we take the fight to [[Sargeras]] himself. Now we end the Legion.
