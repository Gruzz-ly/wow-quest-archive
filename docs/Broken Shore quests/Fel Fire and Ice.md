== Objectives ==
* Threat extinguished

== Description ==
: {{text|say|[[Archmage Khadgar]]|The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] seeks to extend its fiery reach. We would appreciate your aid in extinguishing this threat, commander.}}

== Rewards ==
* 25 [[Legionfall War Supplies]]
* Varies
* +75 reputation with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

== Completion ==
: {{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Ha! Smoked them! Will I be fired for this? One has to keep up one's spirits somehow. Well done, champion, as usual.}}

==Notes==
*Triggers at the [[Coast of Anguish]] on the [[Broken Shore]].
*You're provided the special action button Cold as Ice, a channeled frost cone attack on an 8 second cooldown that will one shot any of the mobs, but they really don't have all that much health in the first place and you can kill them the normal way. Any of the demons there count:
 
*[[Burning Sentry]] 
*[[Living Felblaze]] 
*[[Felfire Imp]] 
*[[Imp Mother (Broken Shore)|Imp Mother]]

There are also [[Fel Fireball]]s, small [[elementals|elemental]] orbs, wandering around.

At the northeast side of the beach is the cave entrance to the [[Maw of Corruption]]. There can be groups of demons that charge out of here. Groups of demons have also been seen spawning by the entrance itself. There are apparently targets inside the cave as well, but being anywhere other than the Coast of Anguish will make your action button disappear.

==Patch changes==
