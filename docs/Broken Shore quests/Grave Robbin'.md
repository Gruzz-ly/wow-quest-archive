==Objectives==
Look for the rumored treasure in the [[Soul Ruin]]s.
*Soul Ruin treasure {{co|49.7|46.7|Broken Shore}}

==Description==
I am not a grave robber, but is it technically grave robbing if the treasure is sitting on a field of bones? It's not like it's buried or nothin'. I'm just gonna sit this one out, just in case.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Finely-Jeweled Key]]
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

==Progress==
I'm always lookin' for more treasure!

==Completion==
You found a key in a chest? Nothing else?

I'm guessing the last guy took all the goods, then accidentally locked the key in the chest. So, you just found a key to a chest that you've already looted. Fantastic work... And people say I suck at this job.

==Notes==
The Dusty Treasure Chest {{co|49.7|46.7|Broken Shore}} is inside the crashed [[Legion ship]].

: ''You find the chest, but [[Treasure Master Iks'reeged]] has beaten you to it again.''
: {{text|say|Treasure Master Iks'reeged|You again? You can't have my treasure!}}
: ''The demon runs off.  All that's left is [[Promising Treasure Key]].''

''Complete:''
: {{text|say|Excavator Karla|Come back later.  I might have another job for you.}}

==Progression==
{{The Treasure Master's Lair}}
