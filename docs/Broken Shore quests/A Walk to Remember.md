==Objectives==
Escort [[Anduin Wrynn|King Anduin]] to [[Soul Ruin]] at the [[Broken Shore]].
*Speak with King Anduin
*Reach the [[Hijacked Portal]]

==Description==
It's good to have you at my side, <name>. 

I've come to the Broken Shore to see, for myself, the price that [[Varian Wrynn|my father]]... that the [[Alliance]] has paid to protect [[Azeroth|our world]].

As long as I am blind to the suffering and sacrifices of my people, I will never be able to lead them to peace. 

Time is short, we should move onward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This place is filled with indescribable horrors. To think.. I was blind to all of this pain and suffering.

==Notes==
;Anduin
{{Dialogue|
I can close my eyes to the atrocities of war no longer. I must see the threat of the [[Burning Legion]] for myself.

{{gossip|I am ready.}}
