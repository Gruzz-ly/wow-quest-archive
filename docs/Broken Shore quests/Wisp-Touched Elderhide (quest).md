==Objectives==
Use the Legendary Tanner's Kit in [[Hrul Sharphoof|Hrul Sharptooth]]{{sic}}'s dwelling in [[Thunder Totem]].
* [[Bag of Wisp-Touched Elderhide]]
* [[Legendary Tanner's Kit]] (provided)

==Description==
Dreadleather, with knowledge carefully reverse-engineered from ancient texts, can be worked into elderhide. It is partly a matter of advanced craftsmanship and partly a simple [[magic]] of the earth. 

With the ancient wisps you caught and the materials you've captured and the research I have done, I have put together a Legendary Tanner's Kit for you. Take it to the heirloom hides of Hrul Sharptooth{{sic}} in Thunder Totem. The wisp will help you use the kit there to create Elderhide.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=|Wisp-Touched Elderhide
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hrul Sharptooth{{sic}} has hides in his dwelling in Thunder Totem. When you approach them, you will be able to use your kit. Bring it back to me for final inspection.

==Completion==
The Elderhide leather that you've created is magnificent. Take this, and work your magic to create something of wonder and beauty.

It is an extraordinary accomplishment and you will look quite dashing--and I should know!

==Notes==
Inside the tent, use the Create Wisp-Touched Elderhide extra action button.
