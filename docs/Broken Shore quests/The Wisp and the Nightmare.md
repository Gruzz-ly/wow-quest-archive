==Objectives==
Get the [[Xavius' Torn Spellsash|spellsash]] from [[Xavius (tactics)|Xavius]] in the [[Emerald Nightmare (instance)|Emerald Nightmare]] repair it.
* Repair [[Xavius' Torn Spellsash]] (1)
* [[Immaculate Spellsash]]

==Description==
[[Xavius]], the Nightmare Lord in [[Val'sharah|Val'Sharah]]{{sic}}, derives some of his power from his spellsash. It is enchanted and tied to the world beneath his feet and cannot be removed from his body. 

However, with the ancient wisp's help, the spellsash can be removed if you can but defeat Xavius in combat. Trivial for one of your skill, I'm sure. 

Take the wisp to the Emerald Nightmare, take the spellsash, and use your skills to repair any damage you've caused in the battle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Name>, defeat Xavius and obtain his spellsash for me. Make sure that it is repaired to perfect condition!

==Completion==
The spellsash looks perfect, <Name>! I couldn't have done a better repair myself.
