==Completion==
: {{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Good work taking care of those giants! The supplies you've gathered will be a boon to the war effort.}}

==Notes==
*Triggers at [[Forlorn Depths]] offshore. [[Sunken Cache]]s need to be opened to take [[Sunken Cargo (Broken Shore)]]. [[Vaporous Abalone]]s can provide air, but if you have no other recourse, the best thing to do is to buff yourself from [[Damaged Diving Helmet]]s floating in the water.
