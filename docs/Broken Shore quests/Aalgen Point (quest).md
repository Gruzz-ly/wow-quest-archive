==Objectives==
Speak with [[Heidirk the Scalekeeper]] at [[Aalgen Point]].

==Description==
You wanna hold territory on [[Broken Shore|this chunder puddle of an island]], right? Right. That means linkin' up with camps on the outskirts, mate.

I know this bloke called Heidirk. Scrappy fella, loves to get into the thick of it. Headed out to the eastern coast with those drakes of his.

Have a look for him. Remind him he owes me a pint or two!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Armies of Legionfall]]
*{{cost|ns=100}}

==Completion==
Chambers sent you? He can down a tankard with the best of 'em, I'll give him that. But if he says I owe him anything, he's a liar!

Don't you worry, my drakes and I will hold the point here. But more of this shore will need to be secured before your campaign can find victory.
