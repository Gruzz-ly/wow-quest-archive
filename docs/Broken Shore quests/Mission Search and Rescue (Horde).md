==Objectives==
Rescue 8 squads of Captured Warriors.
*[[Captured Warrior]] squads rescued (8)

==Description==
I will make these [[naga]] pay for their audacity.

They and their [[skrog]] lackeys captured our warriors while we were fighting the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]. They have no honor!

We must rescue our fallen soldiers before they are sold as slaves, or worse...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have we found them all?

==Completion==
Our soldiers will be back in action soon, and the Felrage [[naga]] will think twice before messing with us again!

==Notes==
