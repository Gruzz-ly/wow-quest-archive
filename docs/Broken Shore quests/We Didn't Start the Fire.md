== Notes ==
* Triggers at [[Cinder Run]] on the [[Broken Shore]]. The Burning Felcinders have Raging Embers, a damage buff that gives them 75% damage reduction, increased haste, and 10 yard fire AoE every 2 seconds. The AOE is applied as a stacking curse debuff on the player. However, nearby Earthen Ring Shamans provide a dispelling AOE area with their Cleansing Totem that you can fight the Felcinders within, or retreat to in order to dispell the curse.
* Reference to "We Didn't Start the Fire" by Billy Joel.
