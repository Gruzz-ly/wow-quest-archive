==Objectives==
Investigate the cave that [[Excavator Karla]] told you about.
* Investigated Excavator Karla's Cave

==Description==
Pst... Come 'ere! I just got a tip about a cave on this island that is a treasure trove of loot! This could be my biggest score yet.

Problem is, I uhh... sprained my ankle. Yeah, I would be right there with you battling those [[demon]]s to get this treasure, but I shouldn't be putting any weight on this leg of mine. Shucks.

How about you go check on this cave and report back to me. I'll mark your map where the cave entrance is. I've been told it's pretty hidden, so you've got to look around.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* [[Wyrmtongue's Cache Key]]
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

== Progress ==
You find anything?

==Completion==
Looks like we hit the motherlode! Now all we need is a key... Huh. Why don't you go work on getting some keys for these chests and I'll hang out with goofy-nose here.

== Notes ==
At the base of a tree is a Peculiar Rope{{coords|47.82|67.34|Broken Shore}}, along with the sign "Nothing Secret Here!" Clicking the rope teleports you inside the [[Secret Treasure Lair]]{{coords|44.34|52.10|Broken Shore}}, and is the only way into this underground area.
