;Description
These demons have no honor! Rather than meet us in glorious, open-battle; they hide behind their barricades and siege weapons. The [[Valarjar]] have come for the glory of battle and we will not be turned away by cowardly tactics! Destroy their cannons and bring down their barriers, so that our valiant Valarjar may face them in the true spirit of battle! When the dust of battle clears, the corpses of demons shall litter the ground... and the Valarjar will stand triumphant!
