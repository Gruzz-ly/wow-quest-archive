== Objectives ==
* [[Battleship Power Core]] (3)
* Power Core replenished (0/100%)

== Description ==
: {{text|say|[[Kor'vas Bloodthorn]]|Champion! [[Fel Hammer|Our vessel]] requires power cores charged with the energy of fel geysers. These tattered wings could prove useful should you find yourself aloft. Do not hesitate to deploy them!}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

{{Wqr|LBS}}

== Completion ==
: {{text|say|Kor'vas Bloodthorn|Most useful! Did you enjoy your taste of what it is like for a [[demon hunter]] to [[:glide]] through the air, hero?}}

== Notes ==
Kill [[Wyrmtongue Engineer]]s until you get the power cores. You can attack [[Legion Cannon]]s to make them explode and one-shot engineers that you've tapped by them, but will also stun you if close enough.

On the southeast side of the tomb, there are Fel Energy Globes in the air; just fly through them to get 10% completion each. If that doesn't work, the most reliable method is to hover above them.

== Patch changes ==
