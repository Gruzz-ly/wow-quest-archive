==Objectives==
Release 10 [[Lost Soul (Broken Shore)|Lost Souls]].
*Souls released (10)
*Speak with [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] {{co|53.7|43.7|Broken Shore}}

==Description==
Never in my life have I beheld such destruction... such misery. The very ground we walk on paved with the bones of our allies.

Even now I can see the lost [[ghost|spirit]]s of [[Alliance]] soldiers wandering the ruins.

I cannot leave this place without putting the [[soul]]s of our brave soldiers to rest. We owe them... I owe them that much.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. A peaceful rest is all we have to offer those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the [[Alliance]]... for [[Azeroth]].
