== Description ==
<name>, my <boy/beautiful flower>! Are you into [[archaeology]]?

We've an exciting opportunity right outside our front door. All the shaking from today's seismic event has knocked a number of artifacts loose from the soil around our encampment. Survey along [[Coldridge Valley|the valley's]] northern border, and you should find all sorts of treasures. Bring some back to me, and perhaps we can study them together.

Right then! Off you go!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||35}} (or {{cost|||90}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Yes?

== Completion ==
Wonderful! Look at this one... it must be over 200 years old!

Now, onto other matters...

== Notes ==
There are pieces of stone tablets all over the area while looking for the beer kegs.
