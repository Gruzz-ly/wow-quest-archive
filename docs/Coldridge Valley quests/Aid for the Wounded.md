== Objectives ==
Use Sten's First Aid Kit on 4 Wounded Coldridge Mountaineers.
*{{NPC||Wounded Coldridge Mountaineer}}s Aided
*[[Sten's First Aid Kit]] (provided)

== Description ==
<name>, listen! Unlike {{NPC||Joren Ironstock||Joren}}, I've no need for yer blade, but I do need someone with a steady hand and a bit o' courage.

Our {{NPC||Coldridge Mountaineer||mountaineers}} are trained to protect from the odd wolf attack... not an all-out [[trogg]] invasion! Many of our best have succumbed to wounds and exhaustion, and I need yer help bandaging them up.

Here, take my first aid kit and assist as many as ye can.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||35}} (or {{cost|||90}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Thanks for yer help, <name>.

== Completion ==
Many of those that y'saved have already made it back to camp. The wounds're well-dressed! Ye might have a future in first aid, if ye're into that sorta thing.

== Notes ==
Head out into the field. There are plenty of wounded mountaineers suffering attacks from [[Rockjaw Goon]]s. Kill the goons and heal the mountaineers.
