==Objectives==
Obtain a Coldridge Bear Flagon, a Ragged Wolf-Hide Cloak, and some Leftover Boar Meat.
*[[Coldridge Beer Flagon]]
*[[Ragged Wolf-Hide Cloak]]
*[[Leftover Boar Meat (quest item)]]

==Description==
The weight limit on my gyro is such that I only have enough room for one <race>. Looks like you're in luck, <name>!

That dwarf woman [[Jona Ironstock|Jona]] told me that most of your personal belongings have been moved inside Anvilmar. Please gather what you'll need, finish up any affairs that remain, and return to me when you're prepared for takeoff.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||75}} (or {{cost||2|10}} at max level)
{{itembox||Coldridge Mountaineer's Pouch (quest reward)}}

==Progress==
Are you absolutely certain you've taken care of everything? You won't have time to turn back.

==Completion==
Took you long enough. Hold on tight, and take a good look! Chances are you won't be coming back here for quite some time.

==Notes==
Pick up the continuation, [[Don't Forget About Us]], inside.

;Old
The boar meat is on a table in the big room, the beer flagon can be found by the bar in the next room and the wolf-hide cloak is up stars near the shaman trainer.

;Patch 6.0.2
All three items are by a table right by the entrance.

The flight is one-way and will happen upon turning in the quest.

:{{text|say|Milo Geartwinge|Ahh, there you are. Hello! I figured that, while you're flying to Kharanos, I'd give you some data about what's going on outside of Coldridge Valley.}}
:{{text|say|Milo Geartwinge|It seems you Coldridge folks are dreadfully under-informed about the events of the last few days.}}
:{{text|say|Milo Geartwinge|If you thought you had problems with trolls in Coldridge, wait 'til you get to Kharanos! That big cataclysm got the trolls are stirred up out here.}}
:{{text|say|Milo Geartwinge|And if you'll look to your left, you'll see that the gnomes have retaken Gnomeregan. Hooray for us!}}
:{{text|say|Milo Geartwinge|There's plenty else going on out here, too. We've opened up the path to the [[Ironforge Airfield|airport]], there's rumors of [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Irons]] in the east... oh, and I think something weird is going on with that dwarf king, [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]]. Might want to check it out.}}
:{{text|say|Milo Geartwinge|And here we are! Welcome to Kharanos! Watch your step on the way out.}}

Players land next to [[Tharek Blackstone]], the turn-in NPC for [[Don't Forget About Us]].
