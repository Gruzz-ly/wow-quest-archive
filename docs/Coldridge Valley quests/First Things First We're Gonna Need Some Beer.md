== Objectives ==
Obtain a Cask of Stormhammer Stout, a Cask of Theramore Pale Ale, and a Cask of Gnomenbrau.
*[[Cask of Stormhammer Stout]]
*[[Cask of Theramore Pale Ale]]
*[[Cask of Gnomenbrau]]

== Description ==
I don't know how ANYONE expects to get any work done around here if we don't have any ale! Our beer level here in [[Anvilmar]] is dangerously low.

Lucky for us, we've stowed some backup kegs for just such an occasion. West of Anvilmar, along [[Coldridge Valley|the valley's]] northern border, ye'll find kegs of Stormhammer Stout and Theramore Pale Ale. Just to the east of here, ye'll find a stash of Gnomenbrau. That's me personal favorite.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||35}} (or {{cost|||90}} at max level)

== Progress ==
The ale, darling, the ale!

== Completion ==
<Jona drinks deeply from the Gnomenbrau.>

Ahh... that hits the spot. Now we can get some work done around here.
