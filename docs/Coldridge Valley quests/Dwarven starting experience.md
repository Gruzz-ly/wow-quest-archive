The '''dwarven starting experience''' takes place in [[Coldridge Valley]], in southwestern [[Dun Morogh]], a level 1-20 zone. When freak natural disasters rocked [[Azeroth]] just prior to the [[Cataclysm]], dwarven lands were not spared from calamity. A series of quakes tore through areas surrounding [[Ironforge]], reducing settlements to rubble and taking the lives of many innocent [[Dwarf|dwarves]]. The quakes roused numerous [[troggs]] from their subterranean dwellings and drove the bestial creatures toward the dwarven settlement of [[Anvilmar]] in Coldridge Valley. The sudden influx of troggs also caused the savage [[Frostmane tribe|Frostmane trolls]] to abandon their usual holdings on [[Shimmer Ridge]] and encroach upon dwarf-occupied areas. Threatened on two fronts, Dun Morogh's mountaineers are spread thin. Without additional assistance, the prized lands of Dun Morogh might soon fall to the dwarves' barbarous foes.<ref>[https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/game/races/dwarf World of Warcraft Website - Dwarf Race description]</ref>

[[Adventurer]]s in Anvilmar are recruited by the mountaineers to fend off the trogg invasion.<ref>[[Hold the Line!]]</ref><ref>[[Give 'em What-For]]</ref> The dwarven mountaineers were trained to protect themselves from odd wolf attacks but not from an invasion of troggs. Many dwarves in the battle zone were injured and exhausted, and the adventurers were sent with first aid kits to help them.<ref>[[Aid for the Wounded]]</ref> After that, they are sent inside Anvilmar, which was put on lockdown due not only to the trogg invasion, but also the earthquakes causing destruction.<ref>[[Lockdown in Anvilmar]]</ref> There they help [[Jona Ironstock]] resupplying the settlement with food<ref>[[All the Other Stuff]]</ref> and beer (no one can expect the dwarves to work without their ale,<ref>[[First Things First: We're Gonna Need Some Beer]])</ref> and [[Grundel Harkin]] with his [[archaeology]] quest, by recovering dwarven artifacts exposed by the quakes.<ref>[[Dwarven Artifacts]]</ref><ref>[[Make Hay While the Sun Shines]]</ref>

Afterwards, the adventurers are sent to [[Grelin Whitebeard]]'s [[Whitebeard's Encampment|camp]],<ref>[[Whitebeard Needs Ye]]</ref> to deal with the fleeing Frostmane trolls.<ref>[[The Troll Menace]]</ref> After spying on the troll encampments, the dwarves find out the Cataclysm tore open a portal to the [[Elemental Plane]], and a [[fire elemental]] was terrorizing the trolls and causing them to flee their caves.<ref>[[Trolling for Information]]</ref> The adventurers are sent to end the fire elemental before he caused the trolls to occupy the whole valley and expel the dwarves from their homes.<ref>[[Ice and Fire]]</ref>

Finally, the adventurers are sent by Grelin to deliver a report of the elemental's presence to Ironforge. However, once they reach [[Coldridge Pass]], an aftershock causes the tunnel to collapse, preventing them to cross to [[Kharanos]].<ref>[[A Trip to Ironforge]]</ref> With the help of the [[gnome]] [[Hands Springsprocket]], they send a distress signal to the [[Gnomeregan Airmen]] who quickly come to their aid.<ref>[[Follow that Gyro-Copter!]]</ref> After collecting supplies for the journey from Anvilmar,<ref>[[Don't Forget About Us]]</ref> they travel to Kharanos on [[Milo Geartwinge]]'s [[Milo's Gyro|gyrocopter]]. Apparently, the Coldridge folk were ill-informed of the events going on outside of the valley, and Milo informs them that the rest of Dun Morogh was in distress as well. From the Frostmane trolls invasion, to rumors of [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Irons]] in the east, and the political upheaval with King [[Magni]] turned into a diamond, the dwarves at Kharanos had their hands full, and needed help too.<ref>[[Pack Your Bags]]</ref>
