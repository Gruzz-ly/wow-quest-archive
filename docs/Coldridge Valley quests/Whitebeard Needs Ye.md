== Objectives ==
Report to {{NPC||Grelin Whitebeard}}'s [[Whitebeard's Encampment|camp]] in [[Coldridge Valley]].

== Description ==
Ye've done us a great service here, but I'm afraid I've gotta send ye off elsewhere.

Grelin Whitebeard, a good friend of mine, has put in word that he may need some reinforcements for the troll camps to the southwest. Follow the road westward, ye should find him soon enough.

Be well, <name>. [[Trogg]]s may be a pain, but trolls are a whole other type of trouble.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||5}}

== Completion ==
Welcome, <class>. Are you ready to get to work?

== Trivia ==
This quest conveys that [[troll]]s are far more powerful than [[troggs]] ("Troggs may be a pain, but trolls are a whole other type of trouble."). Interestingly, a later quest [[Forced to Watch from Afar]] suggests that troggs forced trolls "to flee for their lives".
