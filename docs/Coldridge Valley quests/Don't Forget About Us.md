==Objectives==
Report to [[Tharek Blackstone]] in [[Kharanos]].

==Description==
You're leaving? Make sure you stock up before you head out.

More importantly, please speak to Tharek Blackstone once you arrive in Kharanos. Tell him what has happened here in [[Coldridge Valley]], and that we could use some assistance. Hopefully he'll be able to arrange something for us.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||10}} (or {{cost|||30}} at max level)

==Completion==
[[Coldridge Valley]]? I've got my own problems here! What, they can't deal with a couple of troggs? And trolls? And incursions from the [[elemental plane]]?

Actually, on second thought, that's kind of a lot. I'm surprised they're doing as well as they are. I'll see what I can do.

==Notes==
This concludes the [[Dwarven starting experience]]. The [[Kharanos quest chain]] is next, starting with [[Beer Basted Boar Ribs (quest)]] from [[Ragnar Thunderbrew]], [[The Perfect Stout]] from [[Rejold Barleybrew]] and [[Frostmane Aggression]] from [[Captain Tharran]]. Before doing those, however, head inside the [[Thunderbrew Distillery]] and make it your new home.
