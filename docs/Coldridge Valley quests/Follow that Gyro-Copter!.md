== Objectives ==
Report to {{NPC||Milo Geartwinge}} near [[Anvilmar]].

== Description ==
D-d-did you see that? How the [[Coldridge Pass|whole cave]] just crumbled like that? I guess it's good that you got here when you did, and not a minute earlier.

While this development makes my job of monitoring the cave entrance much easier, I imagine it makes it a lot harder to get to [[Kharanos]].

Hey wait, I've got an idea! The [[Gnomeregan Airmen]] have a flight path not far from here. I'll send up a signal, and they should be able to help. I'll imagine they'll land back over at Anvilmar.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||10}} (or {{cost|||30}} at max level)

== Completion ==
Milo Geartwinge, reporting for duty. You sent up a distress signal?

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Hands Springsprocket|I recommend that you return to Anvilmar, <name>... and quickly! I'll send the signal to the Gnomeregan Airmen.}}
:''Hands lights a flare.''
:{{text|say|Hands Springsprocket|Look for a fellow by the name of Milo Geartwinge. I suppose I'll see what I can do about this cave-in.}}
