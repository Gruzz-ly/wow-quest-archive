==Objectives==
Stand near a Frostmane Soothsayer in each of the [[Frostmane tribe|Frostmane]] camps and listen to what they have to say.
*[[Soothsayer Shi'kala]] Scouted
*[[Soothsayer Rikkari]] Scouted
*[[Soothsayer Mirim'koa]] Scouted

==Description==
I'm notoriously bad at reading troll facial expressions. That being said, these trolls don't look angry to me. They seem to be confused... maybe a little frightened.

Something happened that we're not seeing here, <name>. I say we do some investigation before we just kill every troll in sight.

There are three troll camps in the area: one to the southeast, one to the southwest, and one due west. Each camp has a soothsayer... see if you can get close enough to listen to what they're saying.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||50}} (or {{cost||1|50}} at max level)

==Progress==
I can't even begin to imagine what would make the trolls act like this.

==Completion==
Hmm... interesting. From what you're saying, it sounds like a [[fire elemental]] might have snuck in from [[Searing Gorge]]. Or, the earthquake opened up a crack to the [[elemental plane]]...

<Soren laughs uncomfortably.>

Either way, this is bad news. You should probably report this information to {{NPC||Grelin Whitebeard||Grelin}}.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Troll Menace]] and [[A Refugee's Quandary]] before heading out.
