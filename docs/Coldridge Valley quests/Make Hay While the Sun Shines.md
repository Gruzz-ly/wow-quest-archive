==Objectives==
Obtain 5 Priceless Rockjaw Artifacts from [[Rockjaw Scavenger]]s.
*[[Priceless Rockjaw Artifact]]

==Description==
The [[trogg]] village to the southwest suffered similar damage to ours. One would assume, logically, that there would be some trogg artifacts sticking out of the ground, too!

Unfortunately, it looks like most of the artifacts have already been scooped up by trogg scavengers. Please, go see if you can find some way to get them back. Believe it or not, knowledge about troggs may eventually lead to further knowledge about the mighty dwarves!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Explorer's Robe
|Winter Jacket
|Rockjaw Breastplate
|Plundered Rockjaw Chestguard
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||35}} (or {{cost|||90}} at max level)
* +250 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Did you manage to pry any artifacts away from the troggs?

==Completion==
Well, would you look at this! An axe blade, a couple of arrowheads, and what appears to be some sort of rudimentary spoon. This is indeed fascinating.

Thanks again for your help, <name>. I've much studying to keep myself occupied while {{NPC||Joren Ironstock||Joren's}} got us under lockdown.

==Notes==
Head southwest. There's a ruined camp full of troggs. One of their abilities is to throw their priceless artifact into players' backpacks! How considerate of them.
