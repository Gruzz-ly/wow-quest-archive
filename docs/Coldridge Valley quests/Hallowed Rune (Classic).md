==Objectives==
Read the Hallowed Rune and speak to [[Branstock Khalder]] in Anvilmar. 
*[[Hallowed Rune]] (provided)

==Description==
While you were helping me out, this rune was given to me to pass on to you. Take some time to read it when you have a chance. I'm thinkin' it came from the priest trainer [[Branstock Khalder|Branstock]]. Take a gander at it and go find him inside [[Anvilmar]] when you've a chance. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*40 [[XP]] (or {{cost|||30}} at level 70)
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Ach! Ya made it, <name>! Wonderful!

I was gonna say, I was about to lose faith that ye'd arrive at all... get it, lose faith? It's a joke, lad... aww, nevermind. Ya didn't come here for me bad jokes anyway.

==Completion==
I'm the one who can train ya as you start to find your way around [[Coldridge Valley]]. When ya feel yer ready, come back to me and we'll see about maybe teaching you a new spell or two to fend off the valley from them blasted [[trogg]]s.

Ya got the Light on yer side, along with all of [[Ironforge]], <name>... no pressure on ya to become somethin' special.
