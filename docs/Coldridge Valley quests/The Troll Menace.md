== Objectives ==
Kill 10 Frostmane Troll Whelps.
*[[Frostmane Troll Whelp]] slain x10

== Description ==
The trolls're acting up. More than usual, I'd say. We've seen them put together war parties before, but this time it's... different.

What matters most, however, is the continued protection of [[Anvilmar]]. I've no intention to let those trolls flank Anvilmar while its attention is turned towards [[trogg]]s. Go thin their ranks a bit. They need to know that we're still not without defenses.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Anvilmar Hand Axe|Anvilmar Sledge|Anvilmar Knife|Anvilmar Musket}}
You will also receive: {{cost|||75}} (or {{cost||2|10}} at max level)
{{itembox||Healing Herb|q1=3}}

== Progress ==
From what I've learned, these trolls hail from the [[Frostmane tribe|Frostmane clan]]. I'm afraid I don't know much else about them that would be of any use to you, <name>.

== Completion ==
Hopefully that did the trick. Anvilmar will be safe from trolls for the time being. Now, to find out what it is that has the trolls so agitated.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Trolling for Information]] and [[A Refugee's Quandary]] before heading out.

There are plenty of trolls in each of the three camps. Try to pick trolls that are not clumped together, as they are social and will come in a group.

==Progression==
