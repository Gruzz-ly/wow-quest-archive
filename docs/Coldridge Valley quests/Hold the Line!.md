Slay 6 Rockjaw Invaders.

==Description==
Hey, you there! Ye're a stout-looking <class>. Lend us a hand?

It looks like today's big earthquake shook a bunch o' those barbarous [[trogg]]s out of the ground, and they're sure steamed about something. My men are doing what they can to hold them off, but we could use a hand.

Do yer part - head just south of here and help dig me mountaineers outta trouble. We've got to hold the line!

==Progress==
How many of 'em did ya get?

==Completion==
Impressive work, <laddie/lass>. We can hold the perimeter from here on out.

Here, take this for yer troubles. It might come in handy, as I've got something more important to ask of ye...
