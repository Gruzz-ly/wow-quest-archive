== Objectives ==
Report to {{NPC||Hands Springsprocket}} in [[Coldridge Valley]].

== Description ==
The presence of a [[fire elemental]] here in Coldridge is no small matter. That earthquake did more than just upset a bunch of [[trogg]]s... it changed the world enough to tear a gash into the [[elemental plane]]. We should submit a report to [[Ironforge]].

You wouldn't be willing to take a trip, would ya? Don't worry, I've a feeling that you'll do just fine. Talk to Hands Springsprocket by the tunnel on the eastern edge of the valley. He'll point you in the right direction.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||10}} (or {{cost|||30}} at max level)

== Completion ==
To Ironforge? Well first, you'll need to go through [[Kharanos]], and before that, you'll have to go through [[Coldridge Pass|this tunnel]].

== Notes ==
Complete the quest and an aftershock happens, blocking the cave!

On complete:
:{{text|say|Hands Springsprocket|Alright, so you're just going to head through this tunnel and whaaaaa....?}}
