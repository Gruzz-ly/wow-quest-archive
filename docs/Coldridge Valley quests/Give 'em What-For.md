==Objectives==
Kill 3 Rockjaw Goons.
*[[Rockjaw Goon]] slain x3

==Description==
Alright, <name>, listen up. I know a thing or two about [[trogg]]s, and one of those things is that the biggest, strongest troggs get the most respect. The brutes value strength over anything else.

Ya see those great big troggs sitting back behind the front lines? They're the closest they have to what ye'd call a leader. Go take out a few, and show 'em what it means to mess with the Sons of [[Ironforge]]!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Boots of the Blameless
|Big Trogg Armbands
|Belt of So-Called Leaders
|Big Trogg Bracers
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Well, what're ye waitin' for, <class>?

==Completion==
Hm... they blame us for destroying their home, ye say? Well, that wasn't us, that was the horrible earthquake we had earlier today. Are they that dense that they can't see we nearly lost our camp too?

Can't blame a trogg for fightin' for his home, though.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Aid for the Wounded]] before heading out.
*You break our cave, I break your skull!
*Why you break our home?!
