== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Jona Ironstock}} in [[Anvilmar]].

== Description ==
We appreciate yer help out here, but there may be a place where they need ye even more.

Due to the [[trogg]] attacks - not to mention that massive earthquake we just had - we're putting all civilians on lockdown inside Anvilmar, just up to the hill to the northwest.

Go an' talk to me wife, Jona, inside Anvilmar. I'm certain she's in need of an able-bodied <man/lass> such as yerself.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||3}}

Your [[Hearthstone]] will also be automatically set to Anvilmar.

== Completion ==
Ach... and what do YOU want? Can't ye see I'm busy in here! Go an' bother someone else, I haven't the time.

Wait, what's that ye say? Joren sent you to help? Well why didn't ye say so?
