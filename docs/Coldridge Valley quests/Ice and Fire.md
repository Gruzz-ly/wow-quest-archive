==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Grik'nir the Cold.jpg|Grik'nir the Cold|Leader of the local Frostmanes}}
Kill Grik'nir the Cold, 6 Frostmane Blades, 3 Frostmane Novices, and the Wayward Fire Elemental.
*[[Grik'nir the Cold]] slain
*[[Wayward Fire Elemental]] slain
*[[Frostmane Novice]] slain (3)
*[[Frostmane Blade]] slain (6)

==Description==
[[Apprentice Soren|Soren]] did well to send you out on recon. That's some good information you have right there.

Trouble is, this just adds more work for us to do. The trolls, confused as they are right now, still would like to kick the dwarves right out of [[Coldridge Valley|Coldridge]]. And I'm certainly not going to let some fiery demon turn our snowy valley into a mountain lake.

The troll leader, his servants, and the [[fire elemental|fire creature]] should all be in the cave to the southeast. Take 'em all out.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of these rewards:
|Grik'nir's Chilly Belt
|Whitebeard's Bracer
|Legs of the Wayward Elemental
|Grik'nir's Warming Bands
}}

You will also receive:
*[[XP]]
*[[Money]]
*+350 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
<Name>! Any luck?

==Completion==
I'm glad you've returned safely, <name>. While it may not look like it now, you've proven to be a tremendous asset in the protection of [[Anvilmar]].

Here, take this as a symbol of my gratitude.

==Notes==
Enter the cave to the southeast and take the left fork. It'll head directly to the back of the cave with both named. Kill trolls along the way. Remember that humanoids are social and will gladly aggro nearby trolls if they're in trouble!
