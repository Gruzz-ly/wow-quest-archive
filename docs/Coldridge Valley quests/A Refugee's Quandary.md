== Objectives ==
Obtain Felix's Box, Felix's Chest and Felix's Bucket of Bolts.
*[[Felix's Box]]
*[[Felix's Chest]]
*[[Felix's Bucket of Bolts]]

== Description ==
I was on my way to join my fellow [[gnome]]s at [[Gnomeregan]], but then it all went so horribly wrong!

I left [[Anvilmar]], bags packed and wading through waist-deep snow. Then we had this ridiculous earthquake, and I got all turned around. I ended up here, and what's worse: the trolls stole all my stuff!

<Name>, I've obviously proven myself to be quite incompetent over the last day and a half. Would you mind infiltrating the troll camps southwest of here and returning my stuff to me?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||50}} (or {{cost||1|50}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Once I get my tools, I'm outta here.

== Completion ==
Huzzah, you've found them! Get ready, women of Gnomeregan: here comes Felix!

Now, which road takes me out of here...

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Troll Menace]] and [[Trolling for Information]] before heading out.

The items are by the soothsayer in each camp.
