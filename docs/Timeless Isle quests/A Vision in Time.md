==Objectives==
Use the Vision of Time in the [[Siege of Orgrimmar (instance)|Siege of Orgrimmar]].
* Vision of Time Used
*[[Vision of Time]] (provided)

==Description==
Look at how the Vision reacts! Astounding! Even now it shows shadows of timeways that flit around us constantly. Though not true sands of the [[Hourglass of Time]], the finely-ground epoch stones certainly have a power all their own. Our first task is to use them to calibrate the Vision of Time.

Take the Vision of Time to a location where history is in the making: the Siege of Orgrimmar. Once there, turn the hourglass and see what happens.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|tc=1000}}
* 236000 XP

==Progress==
Did you use the Vision of Time? What was the result?

==Completion==
How very intriguing. I will have to make some additional modifications, and perhaps locate a more proper catalyst. Thank you for performing this experiment, I trust that you did not experience any adverse effects? Should you feel up to the task, I may have use of your services again shortly.

== Notes ==
The vision appears to show [[Thrall]] and [[High Overlord Saurfang|Varok Saurfang]] attempting to enter Orgrimmar, apparently in an effort to parlay with [[Garrosh Hellscream]]. The [[Kor'kron]] guarding the gate refuse them entry, then [[Nazgrim]] comes and orders the Kor'kron to leave, while then escorting Thrall and Saurfang inside. The vision then ends.
