==Objectives==
Defeat the Sha of Doubt.
*[[Sha of Doubt]]

==Description==
If you've come here to try my family's famous noodle soup, I'm afraid you're out of luck.

My father passed away before he could teach me the secret ingredient. He did mention writing down the recipe for a friend of his that studied at the [[Temple of the Jade Serpent]].

Perhaps you can find it there?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|45|60}}
*471000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You recognize the name, Lin, on the scroll. A few characters down you see the character for "Recipe."

This must be it!

Your only worry is that the sha energies that manifested themselves in the tales of the pandaren may have corrupted the scroll as well.

There is only one way to find out....

==Notes==
The objective of this quest is the final boss of the [[Temple of the Jade Serpent]]. This quest can be completed in normal or heroic mode. The turn-in for this quest, and the objective of the next quest is in the same room as the [[Sha of Doubt]], so don't instantly teleport out!

==Progression==
