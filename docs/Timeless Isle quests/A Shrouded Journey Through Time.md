==Objectives==
Defeat 5 Timewalking dungeons.

==Description==
The shrouded star flickers upon the land with its intermittent light ushering in an eerie mist upon the land. This star and the mists bring deep shadows to the land hiding its secrets and dangers. While its influence holds, new paths may open up, to distant places and even distant times. No sage truly understands the nature of this sign, but fortune favors the daring.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Timely Goodie Bag]]

==Progress==
I foresee that you will follow the shrouded star, and walk the paths it reveals.

==Completion==
Ah, <name>, you have returned. An{{sic}} misty air hangs heavy about you.
