==Objectives==
Consume a ripe crispfruit, sand-covered egg, charged crystal, huge yak roast, roasted seed, or fire poppy on the [[Timeless Isle]].
*Timeless Nutriment

==Description==
As you have surmised, the flora and fauna of this island are quite unusual. Not all explanations are mysterious, however. Sometimes, we must listen to the land, to hear the tales of the world around us. Have you considered that the creatures of this island grew to such proportions simply from the nutriment of the land you walk upon?

You will find nutriment in abundance throughout the island: ripe fruits, eggs, meat, flowers, nuts, and even the stones themselves. Eat, and discover the power of the land.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|tc=250}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Emperor Shaohao (faction)|Emperor Shaohao]]

==Progress==
Have you enjoyed the abundance of the island?

==Completion==
The island gives in abundance, in nutriment and in answers. You only need look around to find what you seek.

==Notes==
The closest source would be red [[Ripe Crispfruit]] at the base of trees surrounding the [[Celestial Court]], but there are many, many other options.
