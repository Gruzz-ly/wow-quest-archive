==Objectives==
Use the Vision of Time in the [[Siege of Orgrimmar (instance)|Siege of Orgrimmar]].
* Vision of Time Used
* [[Vision of Time]] (provided)

==Description==
You have kept our mission a secret, and for that I thank you.  Knowledge of the timeways, when in the wrong hands, can cause catastrophic devastation.  [[Bronze dragonflight|My flight]] has little power to repair it, now.  We must be careful.

The hourglass grows in power.  I believe it can now be used to see much further than before.  I wish you to push it to its limits.

Return to the Siege of Orgrimmar, and focus the hourglass on the most devastating timeway you can find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|tc=1000}}
* 236000 XP

==Progress==
Did you use the Vision of Time?  What was the result?

==Completion==
Stormwind... destroyed?

I realize that this vision may come as a shock to you.  I know little more than you at this time.  I will do my best to search for answers, you have my word.

The vision is the most devastating timeway in that--in contrast to the previous vision showing victory underneath [[Orgrimmar]]--it shows the results if [[Garrosh Hellscream]] succeeds in his goals.  It depicts [[Stormwind Harbor]] and the city itself destroyed and heavily infested with [[sha]] energy as it burns.  On pikes jutting out of the stone wall separating the harbor from the city are the impaled corpses of the major characters that have crossed Garrosh.  On the left side is [[Lor'themar Theron]], [[Sylvanas Windrunner]], [[Baine Bloodhoof]], [[Vol'jin]] and finally, [[Thrall]].  On the right is [[Varian Wrynn]], [[Anduin Wrynn]], [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]], [[Tyrande Whisperwind]], and [[Taran Zhu]].  After the vision pans the wall, it fades.
