==Objectives==
Speak with [[Emperor Shaohao]].
*Speak with Emperor Shaohao

==Description==
From what I have gathered, this place used to be a tournament ground of sorts, where warriors from throughout Pandaria would show their prowess by following in the footsteps of their last emperor, Shaohao.

I have heard that when Shaohao completed his trials, he became one with the land, and enveloped Pandaria in a thick mist, obscuring it from even our abilities to penetrate the passages of time.

That sounds quite interesting, perhaps you should speak with him?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|tc=500}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Emperor Shaohao (faction)|Emperor Shaohao]]

==Progress==
Greetings, I am Shaoaho. Are you here to hear the wisdom of the Celestials?

==Completion==
In my pride, I sought to keep Pandaria a secret, and once again I have found myself learning great lessons from this land. I am glad to be able to share my stories with my people, once again, in that they may learn as I have, and learn from my mistakes. Perhaps you, too, can still learn a thing or two from the lessons of Pandaria.

==Notes==
Shaohao is on the pillar between mistweavers [[Mistweaver Ai|Ai]] and [[Mistweaver Ku|Ku]] directly opposite the [[Celestial Court]] from Kairoz.
