==Objectives==
Speak with [[Watcher Alundra]] on the [[Timeless Isle]], off the coast of the [[Jade Forest]].
*[[Curious Bronze Timepiece#Horde]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[bronze dragonflight]] has discovered a most unusual pandaren phenomenon, <class>. Emerging from the mists, far off the coast of the Jade Forest - an island that was lost in time!

It is a dangerous place, perhaps the most perilous in all of [[Pandaria]]. But we are determined to unravel its mysteries.

Here, take this timepiece. A single click will whisk you to the island. Get yourself established, and speak with Watcher Alundra. She will guide you to our chief investigator.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|14}}
* 23600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I see [[Chronormu]] has made good on her promise! You are right on time.

==Notes==
Accepting the quest provides a one-time use [[Curious Bronze Timepiece]], which will teleport players directly to [[Watcher Alundra]]'s position on the isle. Learn the flight path upon getting there!
