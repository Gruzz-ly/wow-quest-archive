==Objectives==
Find an active [[Time-Lost Shrine]] and request a blessing from the Celestials.
*Celestial Blessing Requested

==Description==
Many years ago, these grounds were a place where my people would come in pilgrimage. Here, they would listen to the words of the Celestials, and meditate for many days. In their meditations, they found the fear, anger, despair, doubt, and violence that plagued their spirits.

Before them would be a pathway to enlightenment. For each, the pathway would be different. For all of them, the pathway began with wisdom.

Travel the island, as they did, and discover one of the lost wayshrines of the Celestials.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|tc=250}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Emperor Shaohao (faction)|Emperor Shaohao]]

==Progress==
The shrines will not always avail themselves to you. Do not give up, such is the test of patience.

==Completion==
You have experienced the power and wisdom of the Celestials. Let it flow through you now, and remain in your heart for all time.

==Notes==
There are roughly a dozen [[Time-Lost Shrine]]s that look like the one 30 yards to the southeast of Shaohao's position. Each one may only be interacted with by one player, then it will deactivate for ten minutes before becoming interactive again. Circle the island until an active one turns up.
