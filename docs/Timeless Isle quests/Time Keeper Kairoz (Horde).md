==Objectives==
Speak with [[Kairoz]] on the [[Timeless Isle]].

==Description==
You have found your way to the Timeless Isle, <class>. The [[bronze dragonflight]] is keen to investigate the mysteries of this place, but the island is dangerous, and we will need your help.

Midway down this beach, you will find a paved path to the east.

It will lead you the ancient Celestial Court. You will find Kairoz there, one of the Keepers of Time that we are working with.

Kairoz will answer any questions you might have, and explain how you might help our cause. Be careful: The way may be dangerous.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|tc=100}}
*118,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah! Well met, <name>!

I was told you would be coming, but had not expected you so soon.

...or has it been a long while? Is difficult to tell, here.

So! Shall we begin?

==Notes==
Head south along the [[Timeless Shore]], then east to the [[Celestial Court]]. Kairoz is found sharing a table with [[Wrathion]], [[Anduin Wrynn]], and [[Lorewalker Cho]]!

:{{text|say|Kairoz|Exactly. Time is frozen in perpetuity. Cause and effect - rendered all but meaningless.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|What could create such a thing?}}
:{{text|say|Kairoz|I should like to find out! Perhaps it is related to the mists? Or the power that was unleashed in the [[Great Sundering|sundering]] ten thousand years ago? We must investigate!}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Is it dangerous?}}
:{{text|say|Kairoz|Indeed. This place overturns our very notion of time, and how it shapes the universe.}}
:{{text|say|Kairoz|Stranded on this island you will find the most dangerous creatures in all of Pandaria. Explore if you must, Prince Anduin. But be cautious.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I will.}}
