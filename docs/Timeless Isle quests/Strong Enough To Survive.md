==Objectives==
Defeat five Rare or Rare Elite creatures on the Timeless Isle.
*Rare Creatures Vanquished (5)

==Description==
An island lost in time and yet it returns flourishing with life!

Where did this island travel to?  Did it simply hop forward in time, or did it languish in the dark reaches of the [[Twisting Nether]]?

There is one thing for certain: the creatures that inhabit this place are far more than they seem.  I sense a hidden power in them, forged by the eons.  Seek out the champions of their species, duly marked by their power and prowess, and vanquish five such creatures.

In death, we may find the clues we seek.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|72|tc=1000}}
*294000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This journal really is fascinating.  I wonder what happened to our dear explorer friend in the end.

==Completion==
An interesting story of combat and bravery, though I fear that we learned little from your endeavors save that you are quite the [[adventurer]].  It seems that we find ourselves at an impasse with each twist and turn of this tale.  Time is a fickle mistress.

You may wish to spend some time honing your skills here, before the sun sets.

==Notes==
There are plenty of rare and rare-elite mobs on the island--see the [[Timeless Isle#Timeless events|timeless events]] list. They all count.
