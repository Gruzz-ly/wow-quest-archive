==Objectives==
Bring the [[Shrouded Timewarped Coin]] to [[Mistweaver Xia]] on the [[Timeless Isle]].

==Description==
A swirling mist envelops the coin and it begins to float above your hand. The mist briefly parts to reveal a shiny new coin, yet in the next instant the coin appears worn from years of exchange. As the coin settles back in to your hand, visions of jungles and mist shrouded peaks waft into your mind, and through the vision you recognize the four [[August Celestial|Celestials]] gathered in the courtyard of an island.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|19|40}}
|q1=500|Timewarped Badge
}}

* 13,830 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Coins are interesting items.  They travel far and wide across the lands, yet this one seems to also travel through time.

The fact that you found this coin where you did is both an omen and a blessing.
