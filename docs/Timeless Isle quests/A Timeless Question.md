==Objectives==
Correctly answer one of [[Senior Historian Evelyna|Evelyna's]] questions about the history of [[Azeroth]].
*Answered Evelyna's question

==Description==
Destiny. Fate. Karma. Words like these imply that the timeways are unassailable.

Would that were the case. To this day, many of Azeroth's inhabitants yearn to change the past. Yet just as our experiences shape us, they also shape the world around us.

Consider how those threads have woven the fabric of today's reality. Cut enough threads, and causation inevitably fails, unraveling that fabric. Indeed, cutting even a single thread short can result in disaster, provided it is the right thread.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|45|60|tc=100}}
*471000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let us speak, then, of events that have already come to pass.

==Completion==
This is the great buren of the Historian - should Azeroth's timeways come under attack, we must reconstruct history exactly as it happened, or the consequences could be dire. As we spread our stories and knowledge, so do we create a future for us all.

==Notes==
;Wrong
Incorrect!
;Right
That is correct!

There are a huge number of possible questions! The correct answer is in '''bold type'''.
;Let us test your knowledge of history, then!<onlyinclude>
