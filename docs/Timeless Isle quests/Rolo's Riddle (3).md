The only waterfall on the isle has its source at [[Ruby Lake]] in the northeast corner of the zone. However, it's not accessible on foot, but the "no path to walk but air and sky" points to using a [[Highwind Albatross]] to get up there. Aggro one where it flies close to the ground (see the albatross article for locations), then let it fly until it's over the lake. Aggro it again and finish it off, then look for a shade tree. The accessible tree is found on the northern end of the area above the lake, and the path to it starts from the southern end of the lake and goes counterclockwise to reach it. Next to the tree at  {{coords|66.0|23.2|Timeless Isle}} is [[Rolo's Treasure]].
