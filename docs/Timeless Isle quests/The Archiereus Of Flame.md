==Objectives==
Summon and defeat the Archiereus of Flame.
*[[Archiereus of Flame]] slain

==Description==
Your efforts have driven back the Ordon and brought peace to the Celestial Court, but it will not last. It is time to silence the great emissary of [[Ordos]] - the Archiereus of Flame.

Speak with [[Mistweaver Ku]] and purchase a [[Scroll of Challenge]], then travel to [[Three-Breeze Terrace]] to the north. Issue a challenge at the challenge stone to bring forth a powerful creature. Continue until you have caught the attention of the Ordon, drawing the Archiereus out of the [[Ordon Sanctuary]]. It is your only chance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|tc=2500}} and [[Burden of Eternity]]
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Emperor Shaohao (faction)|Emperor Shaohao]]

==Progress==
The emissaries of Ordos are powerful, do not underestimate them.

==Completion==
The emissaries of Ordos have been silenced, for a time.

Know that anger, violence, and hatred will never cease. Wherever there is the darkness within one's spirit, you will find these Sha awaiting you. They may become manifest in many forms: [[Garrosh Hellscream|a warlord]] hungering for power, [[Anduin Wrynn|a young prince]] following [[Wrathion|a dark path]], and even your own battle against forces not aligned with your own.

Learn from the lessons of these emotions, lest you lose yourself to the darkness.

==Notes==
A few yards north of Emperor Shaohao is [[Mistweaver Ku]], who sells a [[Scroll of Challenge]] for {{cost|tc=500}}. Purchase one, then head north-northwest from the Celestial Court to reach [[Three-Breeze Terrace]]. In the center of the terrace is a [[Challenger's Stone]]. Use the scroll on the stone when it reappears (it has a ten-minute cooldown). The stone will summon an [[Archiereus of Flame]], alongside the rest of the denizens of [[Ordon Sanctuary]].

If the area is clear, when the Archiereus does spawn, pull it north from his location next to the [[Time-Lost Shrine]] up close to the water, so it will be away from the rest of the yaungol that spawn in a few seconds after it does.
