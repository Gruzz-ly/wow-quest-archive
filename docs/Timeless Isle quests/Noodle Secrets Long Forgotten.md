==Objectives==
Search the village, [[Old Pi'jiu]], on the [[Timeless Isle]], for the owner of the old sign fragment.

==Description==
Searching amidst the rubble, you find the fragment of an old sign. Wiping away the dust, you can make out the well-weathered [[pandaren]] characters for, "Noodles," and, "Lin."

Looking above, you suspect that the establishment this sign belonged to was situated on the bridge, which now lies in rubble about you. An eatery placed on a bridge sounds very temporary, so its owner would likely live nearby.

Perhaps there is a clue to be found in the village here on the island?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well, hello there. I am Lin Chao-Wei.

Have you come to try my family's famous noodle soup?

==Notes==
The Old Sign Fragment is found amid the rubble below the broken bridge leading to [[Ordon Sanctuary]], just to the east of [[Mossgreen Lake]] near the center of [[Timeless Isle]]. At [[Old Pi'jiu]], in the ruins of the northeasternmost house is [[Lin Chao-Wei]], pacing about complaining about her recipe.
