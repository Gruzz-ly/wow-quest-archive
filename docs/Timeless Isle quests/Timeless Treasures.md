==Objectives==
Find a hidden treasure on the [[Timeless Isle]].
*Hidden Treasure Found

==Description==
The journal indicates that treasures abound across the island, sometimes temptingly out of reach, and other times hidden in dark caves and hollows. What might have been secreted away here, many generations ago?

And perhaps more importantly, by whom?

Search the island for such treasures, and return to me with your findings. Be warned that all that glitters is not gold, yet the reverse is also true. Sometimes the simple hollowed-out stump is the best hiding place for one's valuables.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|tc=500}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Time flows oddly in this place, I cannot tell if I should be sleeping or eating my mid-day meal.

==Completion==
I am happy that you have discovered some riches for your efforts, though we are no closer to unraveling this mystery than before. Take solace in the knowledge that many such bounties are surely scattered throughout the island, eagerly awaiting your exploration skills and combat prowess.

Oh, one last thing, my young adventurer - do not forget to look to the skies now and again.

==Notes==
There are plenty of chests of all types on the island--see the [[Timeless Isle#Timeless events|timeless events]] list. Treasure chests that don't show up on the minimap count.
