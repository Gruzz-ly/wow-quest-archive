==Objectives==
Speak with [[Kairoz]] on the [[Timeless Isle]].

==Description==
You have found your way to the Timeless Isle, <class>. The [[bronze dragonflight]] is keen to investigate the mysteries of this place, but the island is dangerous, and we will need your help.

Midway up this beach, you will find a paved path to the east.

It will lead you the ancient [[Celestial Court]]. You will find Kairoz there, one of the [[Keepers of Time]] that we are working with.

Kairoz will answer any questions you might have. Be careful: The way may not be safe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|tc=100}}
*118,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah! Well met, <name>!

I was told you would be coming, but had not expected you so soon.

...or has it been a long while? Is difficult to tell, here.

So! Shall we begin?

==Notes==
Head north along the [[Timeless Shore]], then east to the [[Celestial Court]]. Kairoz is found sharing a table with [[Wrathion]], [[Anduin Wrynn]], and [[Lorewalker Cho]]!

:{{text|say|Kairoz|Exactly. Time is frozen in perpetuity.  Cause and effect - rendered all but meaningless.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|What could create such a thing?}}
:{{text|say|Kairoz|I should like to find out!  Perhaps it is related to the mists?  Or the power that was unleashed in the [[Great Sundering|sundering]] ten thousand years ago?  We must investigate!}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Is it dangerous?}}
:{{text|say|Kairoz|Indeed.  This place overturns our very notion of time, and how it shapes the universe.}}
:{{text|say|Kairoz|Stranded on this island you will find the most dangerous creatures in all of Pandaria.  Explore if you must, Prince Anduin.  But be cautious.}}
