==Notes==
[[File:Mound of Dirt (Red Stone Run).jpg|thumb|The mound of dirt in Red Stone Run.]]
[[Rolo's Riddle]] is found in any random pile of [[Glinting Sand]] on the beaches or the seafloor surrounding [[Timeless Isle]]. Loot them until the riddle is contained within.

The quest map covers the entire southeastern portion of the isle from [[Old Pi'jiu]] and [[Mossgreen Lake]] through the [[Red Stone Run]], [[Firewalker Ruins]], and the [[Croaking Hollow]], so it doesn't help too much.

At the southwestern end of the Red Stone Run are four circular pillars in decreasing height leading from the Firewalker Ruins to a [[Gleaming Treasure Chest]] on top of the fourth pillar. At the base of that pillar at {{coords|49.4|69.4|Timeless Isle}} near the tree is a [[Mound of Dirt (Timeless Isle)|Mound of Dirt]]. The quest will not complete until players are within a few yards of it.
