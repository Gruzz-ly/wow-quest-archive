==Objectives==
Obtain an Epoch Stone from one of the creatures on the [[Timeless Isle]].
*[[Epoch Stone]]

==Description==
It is about time that I revealed to you my purpose on this island.

The [[bronze dragonflight]]'s powers have diminished greatly - we can now only catch furtive glimpses through time. It is... quite frustrating.

But we are not entirely without means. I hold in my hand the Vision of Time, an artifact of my own creation. The creatures of this isle have passed through time, and may carry with them some of its essence. With it, we will fill the hourglass, granting us a window into the timeways once more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|tc=1000}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Epoch stones are rare, crystallized essence.

==Completion==
Epoch stones are quite rare. The crystallized essence of time, they require rapid passage through the ages to form. Their presence here indicates that the island may not exist in one time at all, but shift rapidly from timeway to timeway.

That is of little importance at the moment, though. There are important moments in time that require our attention. Give me a moment to grind the stones and add them to the Vision of Time Hourglass.

==Notes==
Stones drop from all mobs on the isle, rarely from non-rares, slightly more commonly from elites, and nearly guaranteed from rares and rare-elites.
