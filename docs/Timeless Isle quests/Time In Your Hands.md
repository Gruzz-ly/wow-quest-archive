==Objectives==
Gather 1000 Timeless Coins and introduce yourself to Mistweaver Ai and Mistweaver Ku.
* Meet [[Mistweaver Ai]] {{co|42.7|55.7|Timeless Isle}}
* Meet [[Mistweaver Ku]] {{co|42.7|54.7|Timeless Isle}} 
*[[Timeless Coin]] (1000)

==Description==
Inhabitants of [[Timeless Isle|this strange island]] barter with a special currency, immune from the fickle fluctuations of time.

You would do well to gather as many of these "Timeless Coins" as possible! They can be found hidden away in small caches, or gathered from creatures all around the island. Larger, rarer creatures are a better source of coins - you may find it profitable to venture forth as part of a group.

Introduce yourself to Mistweavers Ai and Ku across the [[Celestial Court]], and gather some coins for me.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox||Timeless Plate Armor Cache|Timeless Mail Armor Cache|Timeless Leather Armor Cache|Timeless Cloth Armor Cache}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You're back already? It feels like we spoke only moments ago.

==Completion==
I believe you are getting the feel for this place! Yes, opportunities abound to gather up timeless treasures. Strange events happen all the time here - always keep your eyes open.

Speak to the mistweavers you met to spend your hard-earned currency. Meanwhile, I will continue my research.

Here is a taste of some of the treasures you can find here. More powerful items are available. You'll find that hidden caches in the more dangerous parts of the island can be... extremely rewarding. Good luck.

==Notes==
The two named mistweavers are directly opposite the [[Celestial Court]] form Kairoz's postion, on either side of [[Emperor Shaohao]]. Simply interact with both of them to get credit for the quest, then go gather more coins.
