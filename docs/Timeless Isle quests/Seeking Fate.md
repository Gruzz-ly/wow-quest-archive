==Objectives==
Use the Vision of Time in the [[Siege of Orgrimmar (instance)|Siege of Orgrimmar]].
* Vision of Time Used
* [[Vision of Time]] (provided)

==Description==
I have not been completely forthright with you, despite all that you have done to aid the [[Timewalkers]].  I cannot tell you everything, not yet, but know this - there is a traitor amongst us.  Tell no one of your mission today, and take caution around any of [[Bronze Dragonflight|my flight]] while you hold the Vision of Time.

Quickly now, return to the Siege of Orgrimmar once more and use the hourglass.

And be safe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|tc=1000}}
* 236000 XP

==Progress==
Did you use the Vision of Time?  What was the result?

==Completion==
Was that... me?  How very interesting.

Now we are beginning to see the shadows between worlds.  Was this the future of our world, or simply one possibility?  Regardless, our newfound ability to see more deeply into the timeways will allow us to push forward towards the answers we seek.

Allow me some time to continue my research.  And be vigilant, hero, for the timeways are as infinite as our enemies.

The vision appears to take place immediately after [[Garrosh Hellscream]] has been defeated and is lying unconscious on the floor of his throne room underneath [[Orgrimmar]]. The camera pans to show the [[Horde]] factional leaders and [[Thrall]] standing over Garrosh on the left, and most of the [[Alliance]] faction leaders standing on the right. The vision then pulls back to show the entire room, as well as Kairoz from behind standing on the balcony at the room's entrance. The vision then fades.
