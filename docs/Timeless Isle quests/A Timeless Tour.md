==Objectives==
Explore the [[Timeless Isle]].
*[[Cavern of Lost Spirits]] {{co|43|41|Timeless Isle}}
*[[Croaking Hollow]] {{co|65|72|Timeless Isle}}
*[[Firewalker Ruins]] {{co|54|75|Timeless Isle}}
*[[Misty Strand]] {{co|26|30|Timeless Isle}}
*[[Old Pi'jiu]] {{co|37|77|Timeless Isle}}
*[[Red Stone Run]] {{co|56|50|Timeless Isle}}

==Description==
You should first familiarize yourself with the island.

Explore. Investigate anything that catches your interest. Return when you're done, and I'll reward you for whatever information you've gathered about this strange place.

And do be careful! Monstrous beasts and supernatural creatures abound.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|tc=500}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you already explored the island?

==Completion==
Bizarre place, is it not?

I do hope you found some adventure along the way.

==Notes==
It would be fastest to make a clockwise loop of the isle, starting from [[Old Pi'jiu]] to the south.

Unlike previous-patch quest areas, the Timeless Isle does not have much in the way of daily quests or quest hubs after this quest. Instead, go exploring the island, finding random treasure chests and killing random mobs to gather more coins. There is one daily quest at [[Whispershade Hollow]]: [[A Timeless Question]].
