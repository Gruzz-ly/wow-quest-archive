==Objectives==
Use the Vision of Time in the [[Caverns of Time]] in [[Tanaris]].
* Vision of Time Used
* [[Vision of Time]] (provided)

==Description==
I do not wish to ask this of you again, but I do not know who I can trust any longer.  I have been using the Vision of Time to gather information, and in my searches, I believe I have found another crux in time.  It is in the Caverns of Time itself.

I did not want to believe it when the vision first came to me, but I cannot sit idly by and let this information pass.  The Caverns of Time - you must go there, now, and use the Vision of Time.

Move quickly!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|tc=5000}}
* 236000 XP

==Progress==
Did you use the Vision of Time?  What was the result?

==Completion==
[[Soridormi]], the prime consort of [[Nozdormu]], dead?  And I was there as well?

We cannot know what this means, or what will come to pass, or even if this vision takes place in our timeway.  You must speak of this vision to no one, lest we alter the course of time and cause great danger to us all.  All we can do now is complete the Vision of Time - it will show us what the future truly holds.

==Notes==

{{#vlink:lCjkYwNz7xU|One Final Turn}}

The quest can be completed by using the hourglass anywhere in the main area of the Caverns of Time.

The vision begins looking upward towards the hourglass in the middle of the cavern, then pans slowly downward to show, in slow motion, a bronze dragon in its death throes on the ground (it is not identified as being [[Soridormi]] until the completed quest is turned in) by the paths for [[Battle for Mount Hyjal (instance)|Battle for Mount Hyjal]] and the ''[[Cataclysm]]'' instances.  The vision moves slightly to the left to reveal what appears to be Kairoz (or someone dressed similarly) walking away from the corpse and the camera; it is not clear whether this person is the killer.  The vision then fades.
