==Objectives==
Use the Vision of Time in the [[Siege of Orgrimmar (instance)|Siege of Orgrimmar]].
* Vision of Time Used
* [[Vision of Time]] (provided)

==Description==
I have finished grinding the stones, and have attuned the hourglass to a new series of timeways.  Will you return to the Siege of Orgrimmar and turn the hourglass once more?

Return quickly, I am most curious.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|tc=1000}}
* 236000 XP

==Progress==
Did you use the Vision of Time?  What was the result?

==Completion==
A tale of true heroism, and a powerful moment in history.  But not quite what we are after, I am afraid.

Not much time remains - I shall double my efforts.

The vision shows the room where the [[Klaxxi]] paragons boss encounter takes place, and also focuses for a moment on the chest that contained the [[Y'Shaarj|Heart of Y'Shaarj]]. The vision then pulls out toward the room's entrance, where [[Thrall]] and [[High Overlord Saurfang|Varok Saurfang]] arrive on their journey to locate [[Garrosh Hellscream]]. They glance at each other a moment as if to ask each other what they should do, then both simultaneously begin powering up their skills and charge into the room. The vision then fades.
