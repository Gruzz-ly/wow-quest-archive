==Objectives==
Use the Vision of Time at [[Temple of the White Tiger]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]] in [[Pandaria]].
* Vision of Time Used
* [[Vision of Time]] (provided)

==Description==
The Vision of Time is nearly perfected, we now have much more control over the visions we seek.  Your efforts have been instrumental in completing the artifact and restoring the strength of not only [[Bronze dragonflight|my flight]], but also our allies in the [[Timewalkers]].  All of us are in your debt.

Quite fortunately, I have located a sort of crux in time - an intersection of timeways - right here in Pandaria.  Take the Vision of Time to the Temple of the White Tiger.  There, in the cellars, turn the hourglass.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|tc=1000}}
* 236000 XP

==Progress==
Did you use the Vision of Time?  What was the result?

==Completion==
Ah, it seems that our little prince has a role to play yet.  We should not speak further of this, lest we alter the future ourselves.

The woods have ears, hero.  Keep silent, we will find our answers in time.

To complete the quest, go to large arena building at the top of the Temple of the White Tiger and go down the steps to the left or right just inside the entrance into the basement. The hourglass is to be used here.

The vision begins by showing a hooded male orc in his magic-reinforced prison cell from behind, then moves to the front of the room where [[Anduin Wrynn]] is seen coming down the ramped hallway, requesting entrance of the two [[Shado-Pan]] guards.  After a moment, the guards allow him through, and he walks to the center of the room where he engages in conversation with the orc, who has walked up to the door to meet his visitor, through the door of the cell.  The prisoner's bare hand is visible, revealing him to be a [[Mag'har orc]].  After a few moments, the vision fades as their conversation continues.
