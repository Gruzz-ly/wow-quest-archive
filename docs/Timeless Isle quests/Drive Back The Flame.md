==Objectives==
Earn an Honored Reputation with [[Emperor Shaohao (faction)|Shaohao]] by defeating yaungol forces on the [[Timeless Isle]]. 
*Reach {{rep|Honored}} with Shaohao.

==Description==
The pandaren once existed in harmony with the Ordon yaungol. When the island suddenly disappeared, the Ordon faced certain death. In their desperation, the chief shaman called out for aid to the Fire Lords, and was answered.

[[Ordos]] was his name. Now, he is a creature of anger and violence. Though his people were saved, he burns endlessly in molten agony.

There is harmony no longer. The Ordon seek to take the Celestial Court, and sacrifice us all to Ordos. Drive them back, and restore balance. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|tc=2000}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Emperor Shaohao (faction)|Emperor Shaohao]]

==Progress==
The Ordon are not to be trifled with. They have survived on this island under the protections of their ever-burning demigod, Ordos.

==Completion==
Your accomplishments are many, and your bravery cannot be questioned. The Ordon have been driven back for the moment, but do not underestimate them. To restore harmony to the isle, we must continue to be vigilant.

==Notes==
Lots of yaungol killing. Non-elites are worth five points of reputation, elites range from 10-25.
