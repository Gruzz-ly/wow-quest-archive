==Objectives==
Meet [[Maddy Scattershot]] at [[Camp Nowhere]] within the [[Azure Span]].

==Description==
Ye look like a willin' and able [[adventurer]]! How would ye like to help out the [[Dragonscale Expedition]]?

We've got ourselves a lovely camp in the middle of a nice bit of wilderness.

There's plenty for ye to do if ye'd like to take the trip over there. 

Talk to me sis, Maddy, when ye get there. She'll get ye all settled in.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|69|15}}
* 980 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Caddy Scattershot|Caddy]] sent ye? She wasn't here before all the commotion broke out with the [[tuskarr]] and the [[furbolg]]!

To say we got things to do in the camp is a wee understatement. We're flooded with problems!
