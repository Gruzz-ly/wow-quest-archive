==Objectives==
Mount an Overladen Mammoth and return it to your lines.
*Liberate an [[Overladen Hauler]]
*Return the mammoth to safety

==Description==
Trying to kill me I can forgive, but attacking my Hideaway? Now it's personal.

The djaradin are loading their mammoths with all the ingots they can bear to get them back to their precious Fyrakk.

Hijack one and bring it back here, cargo and all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Iskaara Tuskarr Insignia]] (+250 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]])
* [[Flightstones]]
* [[Whelpling's Dreaming Crest]]s
* A piece of Suffused Gear of Explorer quality

==Progress==
What are you waiting for? A thaw?

==Completion==
Now that's a statement!

==Notes==
Look for yellow-orange Overladen Haulers in the area. Hop on and fend off [[Tarasek Boarder]]s by attacking or interrupting their cast, then return the [[magmammoth]] to Old Grimtusk.

==Progression==
{{Fyrakk Assaults}}

==Patch changes==
