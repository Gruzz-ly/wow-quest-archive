==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Arcane Manipulator Tharohn.jpg|Arcane Manipulator Tharohn|A Sundered Flame leader who will stop at nothing to wield the power of the Ruins of Karnthar.}}
Kill Tharohn.
*[[Arcane Manipulator Tharohn]] Killed

==Description==
The [[arcane]] wounds I suffered cannot be healed in the field. I am afraid that they are too grave for me to fight.

I must ask your help again, <name>.

You have to find Tharohn and stop her from overloading more consoles.

Doing so would buy [[Rannan Korren|Rannan]] a few precious moments to calibrate the [[R.A.D.]] ... [[:R.A.D.D.E.R.]].. whatever he's calling it now.

Maybe then we can thwart the [[Sundered Flame]]'s machinations.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|27|72}}
*9,800 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with the [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Do not waste a moment. We are on borrowed time.

==Completion==
It is done then.

Now it is all on Rannan. I trust his abilities. They have gotten us this far...
