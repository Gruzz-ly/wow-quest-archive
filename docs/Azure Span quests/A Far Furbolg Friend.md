==Objectives==
Find [[Barst]] on [[Longclaw Island]].

==Description==
Barst was one of the toughest [[furbolg]]s I've ever known. It says something about [[Frostbite (gnoll)|Frostbite]] that his pack beat him in a fight.

Last I heard, Barst left for some island off the coast of [[Iskaara]]. Called it his "retirement" or some other garbage.

Tell Barst it's time to get back into action.

Oh, and don't be fooled by the way he talks. He'll tear you in two if you look at him wrong.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Winterpelt Furbolg]]

==Completion==
Well, look at you! You made it all the way over here! How can I help you?

==Progression==
{{Grimtusk Hideaway}}
