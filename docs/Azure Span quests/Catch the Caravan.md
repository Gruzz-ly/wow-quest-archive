==Objectives==
Catch up with Brena near the [[Big Tree Hills]].
*[[Brena]] found

==Description==
You should catch up with [[Brena]]. Her [[caravan]] passed through no more than a few hours ago.

They were collecting our late [[chieftain]]'s most prized possessions for a funeral to honor him.

Given that the caravan was heavily burdened, she can't be far ahead.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|69|15}}
* 1,250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I've got you, Hanu.

==Completion==
The gnolls were ruthless in their assault.

They hit us hard and fast and took everything that wasn't nailed down.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Babunituk|With that dragon, you'll catch up with them in no time!}}

Head east out of [[Camp Antonidas]] along the main road out of past the clearing to the edge of the next forest. The caravan has been hit, and Brena, [[Hanu]], [[Elder Poa]], [[Arvik]], [[Tikukk]], [[Oopa]], and two [[Injured Tuskarr]] are sorting themselves out:
:{{text|say|Brena|Hang in there, Hanu. You're no good to [[Norukk]] dead.}}
:{{text|say|Hanu|N-Norukk...}}

Speak with her:
:Busy at the moment.

:{{gossip|You must be Brena. I...}}
:{{text|say|Brena|This is no time to chat.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Our caravan was ambushed by gnolls. They took half my people and many left are seriously wounded.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|We can talk once my brothers and sisters are safe.}}

On complete:
:''Hanu runs off!''
:{{text|say|Hanu|No more waiting. I must save Norukk.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Hanu, wait!}}
:{{text|say|Brena|... Please, <class>, I'd appreciate any help you can offer us.}}

Brena's gossip:
{{Dialogue|We'll need to be at least as cunning as these gnolls if we want to recover what they stole.}}
