==Objectives==
Acquire 15 Gnawbone Armaments.
*[[Gnawbone Armaments]] (15)

==Description==
There's a frankly unnerving amount of weaponry being waved about up there. Relieving them of some should help calm things down. Or at least calm my nerves.

What are they going to do without weapons, after all? Attack you with their bare hands? Ha!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|27|62}}
*10,200 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*+150 reputation with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Surely they're just lying about?

==Completion==
Oh, those? Just dump them anywhere. I'm sure the elementals won't mind.

==Notes==
Head to the camp and loot [[Gnawbone Weapon Rack]] and kill the gnolls in the area.

==Progression==
{{Brackenhide Water Hole}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
