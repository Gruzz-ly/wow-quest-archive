==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Decaymonger Rotpaw.jpg|Decaymonger Rotpaw|Few gnolls have spread more decay, or harmed more innocents, than Rotpaw.}}
Help Hadwin defeat Decaymonger Rotpaw.
*[[Decaymonger Rotpaw]] slain

==Description==
We've been out here for a good bit of time. Time enough for me to watch the gnolls around here.

[[Gnoll]]s are usually a nuisance, but the [[decay]] gnolls around [[Brackenhide Hollow]]...

The decay doesn't just warp their bodies. It warps their minds too.

Decaymonger Rotpaw is the worst of them. She's indiscriminate in who or what she spreads her decay to: the unwilling of her people, travelers, [[animal]]s, [[child]]ren...

If there's any justice in this world, she should be taken down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|28|9}}
*[[Flightstones]] x10

==Progress==
We've got to end Rotpaw's decay-spreading.

==Completion==
Perhaps I bit off a bit more than I could chew... But with your help, Rotpaw and her ilk paid for their crimes.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Hadwin|<Name>, I'm going to knock some gnoll skulls together. Maybe knock some sense into 'em. Meet you out there!}}
:''Hadwin runs away.''

Decaymonger Rotpaw is in [[Brackenhide Brambles]]. Attack him.
:{{Text|say|Decaymonger Rotpaw|So much meat! Meat runs to decay.}}
:{{Text|say|Hadwin|Your time has come, Rotpaw. Time to pay what's due for the evil you've spread!}}

During the fight, he summons [[Concentrated Rot]]s.
:{{Text|say|Decaymonger Rotpaw|Decay is for all meat. Have decay for you!}}

;Death
:{{Text|say|Decaymonger Rotpaw|Decay takes Rotpaw. Decay takes all...}}
:{{Text|say|Hadwin|You'll never spread your decay again, Rotpaw. I'm glad to be the one who brought you to justice.}}
:{{Text|say|Hadwin|Thanks, <name>. I see a few of Rotpaw's followers skulking about. I'll meet you back at camp when I'm done with them.}}
