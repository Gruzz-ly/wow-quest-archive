==Objectives==
Free 6 abused animals.
*Abused animals freed (6)
*[[Duskpaw Key]] (6)

==Description==
Those fiends! Pillaging and murder are one thing, but animal abuse? I'll not stand for it.

The [[gnoll]]s have set out traps for animals to catch and feed to their [[slaver]]ing [[hyena]] mutts. Find a way to free their fluffy captives and show the ruffians how a [[mage]] ethically treats [[animal]]s!

Of course this makes ethical sense in light of my recent actions. What exactly are you trying to insinuate?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|91|48}}
*10,200 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*+150 reputation with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Have you checked their pockets for keys? They have to keep them somewhere.

==Completion==
That'll show those brutes!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Illusory Mage|Have my finest illusion to speed you on your way! Just try not to get too close to them. I never quite mastered olfactory occlusion...}}
:{{Text|say|Illusory Mage|Even I cannot sustain both images though, so report back to my temporary aquatic command center when you've shown these gnolls what for!}}

The Gnoll Disguise extra action button becomes available.

Loot [[Gnawed Keys]] and kill the Duskpaw gnolls to obtain [[Duskpaw Key]]. Use them to free the trapped beasts: [[Trapped Mammoth]], [[Trapped Vorquin]], [[Trapped Beaver]], [[Trapped Hornswog]], [[Trapped Bruffalon]], and [[Trapped Ottuk]].

==Progression==
