==Objectives==
Talk to Archmage Khadgar in [[Camp Antonidas]].
*Talk to [[Khadgar]]

==Description==
I do not have time to quibble with [[sorcerer]]s. 

Go and treat with this "Archmage", <name>. Learn what you may, and be on your guard always. They might be allies still or enemies yet...

Our reports indicate there's a [[Azure Archives|large archival complex]] to the south of here.

That is where I'm going.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|13|45|74}}
*4,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You appear uneasy, friend.

==Completion==
On behalf of the [[Kirin Tor]], I'm deeply concerned to hear what [[Malygos]] did to [[Dracthyr|your people]].

This demands an immediate investigation.

... Where are your companions?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Telash Greywing|Enough of this sneaking about!}}
:''Telash turns, then takes into the air.''
:{{Text|say|Telash Greywing|I don't have time for riddles or parlor tricks. I'm going straight to the source.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Scalecommander Emberthal]]|Telash, wait!}}
:{{Text|say|Telash Greywing|To the archives...}}

Head inside the camp and speak to Khadgar.
:Well-met, <name>.

:{{Gossip|Do you serve the blue dragonflight?}}
::<Khadgar raises his eyebrows in surprise.>

::No, not at all. We do not serve the blue dragonflight in any official capacity. Rather, we are here assisting its [[Dragon Aspects|aspect]], [[Kalecgos]].

::He is a good... colleague of mine. I find that our interests often overlap, not least of all in matters arcane.

::{{Gossip|<Tell Khadgar about your imprisonment by the blue dragons.>}}
:::I see.

:::This is grave news indeed.

:::{{Gossip|<Nod.>}}

Upon completion, a cutscene occurs:

:''[[Noriko the All-Remembering|Noriko]], [[Khadgar]], and [[Althanus]] run to the landing platform. In the skies, [[Proto-Drake (Azure Span)|Proto-Drakes]] appear and start firing at the camp. Noriko raises a protective bubble over her and Altanus, and Khadgar runs to the other side and starts firing arcane bolts at the drakes.''
