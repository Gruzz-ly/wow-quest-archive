==Objectives==
Find Hudson's last piece.
*[[Hudson's Final Drawing|Hudson's drawing found]]
*Drawing shown to [[Hudson]]

==Description==
<[[Ranpiata]]'s eyes look damp.>

Is it me? Am I the reason he has lost his spark?

He says he loves me, but... you heard how not painting makes him feel.

I want what is best for him. If he is better off... I will go.

There is one last piece he threw away. The last thing he tried to draw before giving up.

I could not bear to see it go. I hid it away in our home. Please... bring it to him... as a memento.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
What a strange [[tuskarr]]. How does one get so stuck in their own head?

Is this just what being an artist is like? Will that happen to me too? Oh dear.

==Completion==
This all seems a bit much for me. I just wanted to learn to paint from a master!

But... it has made me think about what my art means to me a bit more.

I think... maybe I'm done with painting.

I'm just going to leave my paints here... maybe try something new...

==Notes==
Head back downstairs and search up [[Ranpiata's Satchel]]. Then, speak with Hudson:
:{{Gossip|<Hand Hudson the drawing.>}}

:''[[Ranpiata]] and [[Rauvros]] head downstair and stand in front of Hudson.''
:{{Text|say|Ranpiata|My love... I won't be what holds you back. I will leave.}}
:{{Text|say|Hudson|No! Ran, I never said that! Losing you would be far worse than never painting again!}}
:{{Text|say|Ranpiata|But you said--}}
:{{Text|say|Rauvros|This drawing... it's messy, unfinished... and the proportions are totally off.}}
:{{Text|say|Rauvros|But look how happy you both are! The smile... the twinkle in her eyes... you captured it perfectly!}}
:{{Text|say|Rauvros|You're happy! Isn't that what matters?}}
:{{Text|emote|Hudson looks stunned.}}
:{{Text|say|Hudson|I... You're right. Maybe my art... was something that comforted me when I was lonely.}}
:{{Text|say|Hudson|I see it now... I don't need to paint! Our love, Ranpiata, is my greatest work of art.}}
:{{Text|emote|Ranpiata smiles at Hudson.}}
:''Ranpiata stands next to Hudson. Heart emotes appear above their heads.''

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Hudson|Wait!}}
:{{Text|say|Hudson|It's a good thing you gave those old tools away. Such fine materials are merely a crutch!}}
:{{Text|say|Rauvros|Huh?}}
:{{Text|say|Hudson|Come, use my brush. We must start with the fundamentals.}}
:{{Text|say|Hudson|Maybe I'll paint again one day, maybe not. But helping you find your own joy in your art... that feels like it will also give me happiness.}}
:{{Text|emote|Rauvros beams.}}
:''All three exist the building, Ranpiata stands in front of it, while Hudson and Rauvros head further and the tuskarr instructs the dragonspawn on painting.''
