==Objectives==
Locate [[Alia Sunsoar]] in the [[Lost Ruins]] within [[Azure Span]].

==Description==
We've got a myriad, no, an incalculable number of problems here!

Oh man, where to start!

The [[Kirin Tor]] uncovered a [[Sundered Flame]] plot. They're after an artifact called "[[Valthrux]]".

It's immensely powerful and... sentient? That's an exponential increase in danger if you're keeping track.

One Alia Sunsoar went south with a pair of [[tuskarr]] to investigate the Sundered Flame. She should have been back by now.

Please find her and stop the Sundered Flame from acquiring the artifact!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|69|15}}
* 980 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Finally, a stroke of good luck! We could really use a hand here.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Polky Cogzapper|We cannot allow the Sundered Flame to get control of that artifact. We have enough to handle with the [[primalists]]!}}

;On approach
:{{Text|say|Alia Sunsoar|Help... me...}}
:{{Text|say|[[To'tik]]|Hang in there! Kattigat, we have to get help. We can't fight the ice spiders and the Sundered Flame!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Kattigat]]|Wait. Is that?  Someone's coming. Hey! Over here!}}

==Progression==
{{Lost Ruins}}
