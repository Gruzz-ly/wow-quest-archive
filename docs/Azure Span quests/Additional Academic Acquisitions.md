'''Additional Academic Acquisitions''' is a [[repeatable quest]] from [[Sonova Snowden]] in the [[Winterpelt Hollow]]. Each five [[Liberated Furbolg Artifacts]] is worth one skill point in the 99 necessary to cap the Language: Furbolg skill. Unlike daily or weekly quests, this quest can be repeated as often as desired.

==Objectives==
Recover furbolg artifacts from [[Primalists]] in the [[Azure Span]].
* [[Liberated Furbolg Artifacts]] (5)

==Description==
Keep 'em comin'!

The more examples o' furbolg writin' ye collect for me tae cross reference, the better.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
: {{Abilities|Knowledge: Winterpelt|Increases your understanding of the Winterpelt language.|id=403661|icon=inv_10_misc_winterpeltfurbolg_totem|notes=+1 skill}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|80|9}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Don't stop now; we got ourselves a language tae learn!

==Completion==
I'll get right on catalogin' this batch.

==Notes==
Just like in [[Academic Acquisitions]], Sonova marks four far-flung Primalist locations on the map: [[Vakthros Range]] {{co|76|38|Azure Span}}, the [[Rustpine Den]] {{co|61|52|Azure Span}}, [[Imbu]] {{co|58|67|Azure Span}}, and [[Shiverweb Vale]] {{co|50|62|Azure Span}}. Pick whichever.

Note that players are ''not'' required to be on this quest for the items to drop. Feel free to pre-gather a hundred or so at a time... Additionally, any creatures that can drop artifacts have a slim chance of dropping an [[Intact Scribe Stick]], which is worth one point of skill via [[Astonishing Academic Acquisitions]]!
