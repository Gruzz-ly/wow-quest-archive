==Objectives==
Collect Taut Tethercoil from powerful foes throughout the [[Emerald Dream (zone)|Emerald Dream]].
* [[Taut Tethercoil]] (50)
* [[Tethercoil Rune]]

==Description==
I've read of a root in the [[Emerald Dream]] known for its defensive qualities. It binds its tendrils to powerful foes as a way to protect surrounding flora and fauna. A friendly scribe might be able to help you adapt its properties.

If I could just get my hands on some of that root, I'm sure I could dissect its properties and mold it into something capable of harnessing [[Fyr'alath]]'s power.

Here are my notes. You should be able to find powerful creatures guarding patches of wild tethercoil. Good hunting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* [[Prototype Binding Rune]]

==Progress==
Ah, thank you for bringing these to me.

==Completion==
I'm impressed! You're certainly tenacious.

Now we can craft the base of our binding rune.

==Notes==
