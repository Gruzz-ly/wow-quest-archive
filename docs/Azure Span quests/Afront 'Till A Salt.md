==Objectives==
Gather 120 Crystal Flakes in [[Gorloc Shore]].
*[[Crystal Flakes]] (120)

==Description==
We don't mind accommodating you and your friends in our little place--not that anyone asked-- but would you be a good neighbor and nab me some crystal flakes if you're going up to the springs? We use 'em to preserve all kinds of things. It's a crucial part of keeping food around here.

The larger [[gorloc]]s are absolutely covered in the stuff. Maybe get some flakes off them?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Now that you mention it, I'm actually pretty hungry.

==Completion==
This is will go a long way in helping us in these parts. We just might let your friends stick around...

==Progression==
