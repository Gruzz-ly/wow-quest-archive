==Objectives==
Collect 12 Coldsnap Sagittate leaves.
*[[Coldsnap Sagittate]] (12)
*Return to [[Rumiastrasza]] at The [[Ruby Feast]] in [[Valdrakken]].

==Description==
I believe the plant you're looking has a fine, narrow stem and red leaves all about it.

You'll be hard-pressed not to run into any of those dastardly crawlers while you're collecting flowers though. I'd advise you steer clear when you can, or ready a sharp weapon when you can't.

And let your [[dragon]] friend know they can repay me in a cup or two of the stuff next time I'm in the city.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
*[[Elegant Dracthyr's Tea Cup]]

==Progress==
Steeped just right, coldsnap fills the drinker with warmth for hours to come.

==Completion==
Ah! This is most certainly the Coldsnap Sagittate! My nostrils are exhilarated! 

Excellent work, <name>! I am positive our venerable guests will be gargling your praises with each sip of warmth imbibed. Let us not forget to do so with some of these delicious little cakes [[Chef Morsel|Morsel]] and [[Alchemist Flemthroat|Flemthroat]] made as well!

==Notes==
;On completion
:{{text|say|[[Alchemist Flemthroat]]|Truly a remarkable specimen! It's chilled on the outside, yet the inside provides a warm numbing sensation when crushed.}}
:{{text|say|[[Rumiastrasza]]|Soothing for mind and body of all levels of decay, I hope!}}

==Progression==
{{The Ruby Feast}}
