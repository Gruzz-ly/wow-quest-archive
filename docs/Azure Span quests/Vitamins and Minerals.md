==Objectives==
Collect 4 Mineral Water Vials.
*[[Vial of Mineral Water]] (4)

==Description==
I suppose I should have expected that [[Steria Duskgrove|Steria]] would be upset at me asking you to fight animals...

There are of course alternative research methods.

Take these vials and collect some water from the nearby ice crystals.

I theorize that they contain minerals infused with ley crystal energy--and may be fueling the outbreak here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|91|48}}
*9,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you filled all the vials?

==Completion==
Excellent, <name>.

These samples should give us a more complete picture of how the outbreak is spreading.

==Notes==
The vials are looted from [[Strange Ice Crystal]]s.

==Progression==
{{Slyvern Plunge}}

==Alpha version==
;Objective
Investigate 6 strange crystals.
*[[Strange Icy Crystal|Strange Crystals]] Investigated (6)

;Description
Steria is going to need some other components if she wants to pull this off. I have noticed crystals nearby. Perhaps they contain minerals that could help us.
