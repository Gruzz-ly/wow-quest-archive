'''Our Loyal, Lanky Steeds''' becomes available after reaching Renown 25 with the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]].

==Completion==
Our [[ottuk]]s choose only to be ridden by our most esteemed [[warrior]]s.

I think it is time to see if one will bond with you. They are fiercely loyal, but they love to have fun!

I will leave you and the ottuks to decide which will be your bonded companion.

Ottuks that are large enough to ride are rare, and their tack is expensive. If you wish to train another one, my fellow trainers and I must ask for a large trade in return.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Brown Scouting Ottuk
|Yellow Scouting Ottuk
}}
