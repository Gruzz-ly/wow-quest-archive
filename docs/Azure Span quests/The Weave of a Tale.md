==Objectives==
Tell [[Elder Poa]] a fishy tale.
*Story told

==Description==
My dearest wife, Poa, is an excellent storyteller. 

But it's been thirty years, and she tells the same ones over and over again! Please, <class>, talk to Poa and give her a new story to tell.

What's that? Tell her a story about your adventures? Don't be ridiculous -- I don't want to hear about that! The greatest stories are always about fish. Tell a story about fish, even if you have to make one up!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
I'm waiting...

==Completion==
Thank goodness, a new story. 

Let's hear it!

==Notes==
Speak with Elder Poa:
:Have you come to hear a tale, traveler?
:{{gossip|I have come to tell YOU a tale, Elder.}}
:You think you have a story worthy of my time? Well! We shall see about that, won't we?
:{{gossip|It's about the greatest fish anyone has ever caught...}}
:Oh really?
:You have my attention.
:How did you catch this "legendary" fish?
*{{gossip|By collecting all the rarest fish across the many lands and crafting them into the most irresistible lure.}}
*{{gossip|By slaying a horde of terrible demon fish with nothing but my bare hands!}}
*{{gossip|By doing a handstand and fishing upside down, of course!}}
:Did you, now?
:And what exactly was it you caught?
*{{gossip|A perfectly average fish.}}
*{{gossip|The biggest shark you've ever seen!}}
*{{gossip|Some weird half-seal, half-squid... thing!}}
:Your powers of description are overwhelming.
:Well? What happened next?
*{{gossip|It slipped from my hands and tried to flop back into the water!}}
*{{gossip|It drew a sword and tried to kill me!}}
*{{gossip|It suddenly spoke and whispered to me promises of great power...}}
*Hmmm... sure it did.
:And then?
*{{gossip|I killed and ate it, of course.}}
*{{gossip|I threw it back into the ocean, of course!}}
:A wise choice.
:Interesting. You are not the most gifted of storytellers, but there is something here. Even if you made it all up.
:Give me a moment and I will weave your tale into something usable.

On completion, Poa will then retell the player's story. Each line corresponds to a given choice.

The first line:
*{{text|say|Elder Poa|One day, the great fisher <name> decided to make a lure by collecting all the rarest fish across the lands. Over land and sea they traveled, and even to other worlds! When finally it was crafted, they caught...}}
*{{text|say|Elder Poa|One day, long ago, the great hero <name> was fishing when they were suddenly beset by a horde of monstrous demon fish! They fought the horde off with their bare hands, only to fish up...}}
*{{text|say|Elder Poa|One day, the notorious fisher <name> thought of the new best way to catch fish - by standing on their head! For three days they remained in this pose, until finally they caught...}}

The second:
*{{text|say|Elder Poa|A seemingly perfectly average fish.}}
*{{text|say|Elder Poa|A mighty shark, with dorsal fins like mountains and teeth the size of mammoth tusks!}}
*{{text|say|Elder Poa|The strangest creature mortal eyes have ever seen! It had a face like a ducking, the torso of a seal, and the tentacles of a giant, toothy squid!}}

The third:
*{{text|say|Elder Poa|Writhing in <name>'s hands, the creature slipped from their grip! It thrashed about and <name>, looking equally foolish, floundered around trying to catch it! It took far too long to recapture the creature, and many an onlooker had a hearty laugh at the scene.}}
*{{text|say|Elder Poa|Then, furious, the creature drew a mighty weapon, a spear the size of a storm cloud! It waved it in the air, threatening to strike the hero down!}}
*{{text|say|Elder Poa|Only then, the creature opened its mouth to speak! it praised <name> for their skill and promised to give them power unimaginable.}}

And the last:
*{{text|say|Elder Poa|But <name>, undaunted, promptly killed it and cooked it into the most delicious of soups, nourishing their family for weeks!}}
*{{text|say|Elder Poa|Then, <name> threw it back into the ocean. They went on to fish in other waters, but never quite felt the same after that one catch...}}

==Patch changes==
