==Objectives==
Gather [[:Blood Berries]], [[:Bronze Horn Berries]], and [[Dragon Foil Blossom]]s.
*Collect fruits, berries, and herbs. (0/100%)

==Description==
The gang had some time off and was hankerin' for a pint, so we bellied up to [[Missing Hinge Inn|the inn]].

But, ach! I can nae believe it! They didna have any brew! What kind o' inn is that? One ran by the Stonehinges--that's what kind!

So we're takin' matters into our own hands! The forest to the east has flowers and herbs that we could use to brew some sweet mead. Feel like helpin' me and doin' some flower pickin'? There'd be somethin' in it for ye!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Ye get a nice mead-brewin' bouquet yet?

==Completion==
Oh, these are be-u-ti-ful! This one is spicy! And this one reminds me of Earthroot. Oh, I can taste the sweet mead now...

Thank ye kindly, friend! Ye saved me and the gang's afternoon!

==Notes==
Head to the east and loot the flowers:
*[[Dragon Foil Blossom]] 10%
*[[Blood Berries]] 7%
*[[Bronze Horn Berries]] 4%
