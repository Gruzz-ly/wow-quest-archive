==Objectives==
Slay the Shiverweb Queen.
*[[Shiverweb Queen]] slain
*[[Spider Squasher]] (provided)

==Description==
Here we go! A lil' formal education, a lil' educated guessin', a touch o' re-chiselin' runes, and we got ourselves a [[magic]] un-infuser! Defuser? Out-fuser?

Whatever! It'll do somethin' unpleasant tae the queen, o' that I'm pretty sure. And she's got tae go if we're aimin' tae stop the threat. Squashin' the lil' ones will only slow 'em down. Ye got tae cut 'em off at the source.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*9,800 [[XP]]
*[[Shiverweb Egg]]
*+400 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
She's in the cave over yonder.  Giant spider. Cannae miss 'er.

==Completion==
Aye, that should throw a wrench intae their plan.

Now... just tae push... a... lil'... harder...

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Grungir Ironspout|Go get 'er, <lassie/laddie>! Show them Primalist ice-lickers it takes more than a big bug tae keep a good dwarf down!}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Grungir Ironspout|Ach, it feels good tae move again, <name>! I told ye me ol' family brew would nae let me down!}}

Completing the quest also awards the "Shiverweb Vale" criterion of [[Sojourner of Azure Span]].

Head back to the camp for the explorers' reunion:
