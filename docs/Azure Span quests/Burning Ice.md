==Objectives==
Extinguish fires across the [[djaradin]] camp.
* Collect water on a drake
* Extinguish Fires (0/100%)

==Description==
Whatever magic the djaradin are employing is lighting the ice on fire out there, <name>.

We can't let this spread to the wider [[Azure Span|Span]]. It has to be stopped before it consumes everything.

Gather as much water as you can while on that drake of yours and drown the fires. Hopefully that will be enough to extinguish them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
The sight of burning ice unnerves me.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. At least we can contain the damage.

==Notes==
Mount up in any open water nearby to gather a gigantic water bubble, then fly over the main djaradin camp and use the [[Extra Action Button]] to drop it:
:{{Abilities|Dump Water|Dump all your collected water at once, extinguishing a large swath of fires.|id=405872|icon=spell_frost_summonwaterelemental}}

==Progression==
{{Fyrakk Assaults}}
