==Completion==
You wish to learn about [[skinning]]? You've come to the right people.

We pride ourselves on the quality of our hides and furs. Our hunts bring back only the finest pelts, and our [[hunter]]s guard their secrets carefully. Or at least some do. I have notes from some of our most prolific hunters that I can share with you. It should get you started skinning like a [[tuskarr]]!
