==Objectives==
Complete the first Challenge of Tyr in the [[Azure Span]].
*Speak with [[Maiden of Inspiration]] to begin
*Fly through rings (10)

==Description==
<As you approach, the inscription on the statue emits a faint glow.>

"Wield the Keeper's power and carry its light to a better future for us all."

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Bottled Essence]]
* {{cost|55|24|}}
* 12,850 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
Admirably done. You have earned your reward.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|You have not shied way from your first challenge. An excellent sign.}}

Interact with the Maiden:
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|For this trial, you must leave the comfort of the ground behind.}}
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|And rely only on your finesse and precision to collect the enchanted rings.}}
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|Good luck.}}
:''The maiden launches the player a few hundred yards up!''

Much like the [[Bastion]] world quest [[Flight School: Falling With Style]], fall through 10 rings.

:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|You have done well and earned your reward.}}

Completing the quest is the "First Challenge: Finesse" criterion of the [[In Tyr's Footsteps]] achievement.

==Progression==
