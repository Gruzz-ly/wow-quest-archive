==Objectives==
Speak with Brena to witness the funeral ceremony.
*Speak to [[Brena]]
*[[Funeral Boat|Boat]] pushed out to sea

==Description==
Thank you, <name>. I have learned what I need for now from our new friends.

The [[Funerary practices|funeral ceremony]] for [[Ponoliak|their former chieftain]] is about to start. Given how kind and hospitable the Iskaarans have been to us, it seems only right that we join them before departing back to the [[Azure Archives|Archives]].

Speak with Brena and let her know we are ready when they are.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Solemn Seashell String]]
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
It is good to slow down, now and then. And interesting to see the tuskarr's traditions.

It has been long since the [[blue dragonflight]] has had traditions such as these.

==Completion==
<[[Kalecgos]] looks distant.>

==Notes==
Speak with Brena, while trying to ignore Kalecgos still slurping of the soup:
:Make yourself at home.

:{{gossip|I'm ready to begin the funeral.}}
:''Kalec finally puts down his bowl of soup and starts walking with Brena to the sea.''
:{{text|say|Brena|We were hoping you would join us, friends. A chieftain's return to the sea is a celebration for all.}}
:''In the meantime, the rest of the tuskarr follow along, pushing the funeral boat.''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|If you... don't mind me asking, how did he pass? Was it the [[gnoll]]s?}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Oh no, Kalecgos. It was simply his time. Ponoliak was a stubborn old coot, but even he had to succumb to age eventually.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Not all deaths are violent, dear friend.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|To be honest... I can't remember a time when they weren't.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Go ahead, <name>, you can have the honor of pushing his boat out to sea. For your help protecting Iskaara.}}

Head over to the Funeral Boat and give it a push to start [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|an in-engine cutscene]]:
{{#ev:youtube|mgq5V7wwnPo}}
:{{text|say|Brena|You treasured us all. May the seas find you as worthy as we do.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Look...}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|<Shocked gasp.>}}
:{{text|say|Brena|[[Gral]] himself has chosen Ponoliak! What a life!}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I... forgive me, I don't understand.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|How can you find such joy in the passing of family?}}
:{{text|say|Brena|It is not that we are not sad for his passing, Kalec.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|But in celebrating his life, he shall remain with us forever.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|What better way to strengthen the bonds of the family that remains, than celebrating all who came before?}}
