==Description==
What? Another one's seized power? Whatever happened to abhorring a vacuum? Or at least waiting for a respectful period of mourning to pass in order to keep up appearances?

Deal with this Bloodclaw fellow. I need a moment.

And I don't need your nagging comments, thank you very much!
