==Completion==
A fellow lover of nature! Good.

All [[tuskarr]] respect the cycle of [[nature]]. [[Herbalist]]s are highly regarded in our community! We have a long tradition of using the gifts of the land in both ritual and medicine. Our elder herbalists are very learned but also... tend to keep to themselves. But they have left behind notes and drawings for those who want to follow their path into the wilderness. Use them well and come back to me for more learning later.
