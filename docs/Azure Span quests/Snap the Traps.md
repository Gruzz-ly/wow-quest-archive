==Objectives==
Spring 5 Bladejaw Traps.
*[[Bladejaw Trap|Traps]] sprung (5)
*Meet [[Hanu]] at the entrance to [[Kargpaw's Den]] in the [[Big Tree Hills]].

==Description==
The hills ahead are littered with insidious bladejaw traps.

With a keen eye, you should be able to locate them. Very carefully spring the traps using this old [[tuskarr]] trick: a long stick. Note that while stepping on them is another way to set the traps off, I wouldn't recommend it.

Once enough have been removed, find [[Hanu]]. [[Elder Poa]] and I will catch up when we can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Have you managed to clear out the traps?

==Completion==
Well done. It will be safer for [[Brena]] to make her way here.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Brena|Be on your guard. There's nothing so cunning and cruel as a [[Shadepaw]] [[gnoll]].}}
:{{text|say|Elder Poa|[[Troll]]? There are no trolls here!}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Err... of course, Elder.}}

Bladejaw Traps litter the [[Big Tree Hills]]. Make sure to poke them with a stick!

On completion of all three, [[Brena]] and [[Elder Poa]] run up:
:{{text|say|Hanu|Brena! You came...}}
:{{text|say|Brena|I see you've been busy.}}
:{{text|say|Hanu|Norukk and the others... they're in the den.}}
:{{text|say|Hanu|Kargpaw is in there... and all these sickly gnolls!}}
:{{text|say|Elder Poa|Slow down, Hanu!}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Tell me everything.}}

==Progression==
