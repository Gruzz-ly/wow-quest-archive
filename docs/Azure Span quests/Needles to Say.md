==Objectives==
Collect 15 Arcane-Infused Quills.
*[[Arcane-Infused Quill]] (15)

==Description==
I want to help [[Sylvie]], but I don't want to delay [[Cally]] any longer.

To give Sylvie the medicine, I need [[arcane]]-infused quills from the [[crystalpine]]. I'm sure they won't mind if you pluck a few off!

And mind the [[bakar]]! They eat crystalpine and might get mad at you touching it. If you do have to defend yourself, you can collect some spines from them as well.

But... try not to do that, please.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|91|48}}
*9,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Be careful handling the quills! They are VERY sharp. Ask me how I know!

<Steria sighs>

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. You didn't hurt yourself on the crystalpine, right?

==Notes==
The quills drop from [[Barbed Bakar]] and are collected from [[Prickly Crystalspine]]s.

==Progression==
{{Slyvern Plunge}}

==Alpha version==
{{Rfa-section}}
;Description
Next I'm going to need quills from some of the nearby wildlife. These quills have some arcane properties that will help us make this treatment. As much as I don't want more [[animal]]s to come to harm, the spell we'll make will help protect more creatures.
