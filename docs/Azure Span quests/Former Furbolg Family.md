==Objectives==
Kill 15 Rustpine furbolg and elementals, then meet [[Narn]] further in [[Rustpine Den]].
*[[Rustpine clan|Rustpine]] [[furbolg]] and [[elemental]]s slain (15)
*Meet Narn in Rustpine Den.

==Description==
[[Primalists]] came. They offered us new strength: the command of the elements.

I did not think [[Stoneheart]] would accept their gifts. Our clan did not need power. He thought nothing of the cost.

His terrible decision cannot be unmade. The [[magic]] has corrupted my clan--like disease rots a root.

My heart breaks, but culling the corrupted is the only way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Winterpelt Furbolg]]

==Progress==
It must be done.

==Completion==
I am sorry you met the Rustpine clan now. This is not my people.
