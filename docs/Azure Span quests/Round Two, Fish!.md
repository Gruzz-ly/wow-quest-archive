Slay Mochoby.
*Set the bait
*[[Mochoby]] slain

==Description==
How do you feel about doing a little [[fishing]], then, <name>?

There's a school of bait [[fish]] just offshore that the dumb beast attacks whenever they gather, forgetting that it's already dead.

Swim out there and wave that lure around, maybe do your best impression of a wounded seal, and it won't be able to resist.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]

{{itembox||Solemn Seashell String

==Progress==
It's out there. I can feel it.

==Completion==
Now who's up one?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''Captain Haab starts accompanying the player.''

Interact with the [[Bait Fish]] to set the bait, which summons Mochoby.
