==Objectives==
Rescue the kits.
*[[Snowypelt Kit|Kits]] Rescued (5)
*Return the Kits to [[Sylvie]]
*[[Steria's Charm of Invisibility]] (provided)

==Description==
If Sylvie is this distressed, that must mean it's her kits that are [[Slyvern Ice Cave|in there]]!

While she was infected, the [[giant]]s must have kit-napped her babies and she was too weak to save them.

Kits are energetic at this age, hopefully they've all been quick enough to evade the giants until now...

Here, make use of my invisibility charm-- Quickly, you must save them before they're eaten!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|53|82|96}}
* 12,250 [[XP]]
* +400 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +800 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Completion==
Now that Sylvie is healing, these kits will be in good hands...

Er, paws...

Claws?

==Notes==
Find the kits inside the cave. Once five have been collected, return to Sylvie:
:<Sylvie perks up, smelling you--and presumably her kits--despite the invisibility spell.>

:{{Gossip|<Return the kits to their mother.>}}
:''The kits are placed on the ground.''

Sylvie's final gossip:
:<Sylvie looks anxious to take her babies far away from the ice giants' cave.>

;Upon completion

:{{Text|say|Callisto Windsor|You know... this is a good case study for our research of ley-sickness. We should add it... if we finish everything else.}}
:{{Text|say|Steria Duskgrove|Really? Well, let's get back to researching then!}}
:{{Text|emote|Callisto gives Steria a fond smile as the two walk off.}}
:''Steria and Callisto go northward.''

Completing the quest also awards the "Slyvern Plunge" criterion of [[Sojourner of Azure Span]].
