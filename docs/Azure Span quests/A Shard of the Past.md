==Objectives==
Recover and bring the artifact to Thanessa Silverbloom.
*[[Ancient Artifact (Azure Span)|Artifact]] collected
*Bring the artifact to [[Thanessa Silverbloom]].

==Description==
I've seen ye runnin' in and out of the camp helpin' people. Ye think ye could help ol' Gannar too?

I surveyed the area, and somethin' caught me old eyes. I think 'tis an ancient potsherd or a jar or somethin' just down south of here at the edge of that waterfall.

Now, I am not much of a swimmer, but I'll give ye some coin and you can deliver the findings to Thanessa Silverbloom.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|21|6|75}}
*6,800 [[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
You must be <name>.

Gannar said you were running some sort of an errand for him?

==Completion==
This is an unbelievable find! I have never seen ancient pottery like this. And these markings... Give me a moment while I inspect them.

==Notes==
The artifact is at the waterfall at {{Co|17.61|28.23|Azure Span}}.

;Upon completion
:''The artifact is placed down next to Thanessa.''
:{{Text|say|Thanessa Silverbloom|These markings are of [[Djaradin]] origins.}}
:{{Text|say|Thanessa Silverbloom|But what is this archaeological piece doing here, in the [[Azure Span]]?}}
:{{Text|say|Thanessa Silverbloom|I will borrow it for further examination.}}
