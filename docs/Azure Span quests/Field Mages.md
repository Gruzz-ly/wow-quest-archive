==Objectives==
Check on the [[Kirin Tor]] [[mage]]s near [[Slyvern Plunge]] in the [[Azure Span]].

==Description==
Lok'tar, <race>.

If you have the time, we have two mages doing fieldwork nearby who I'm sure could use a hand.

This is a dangerous land in the best of times.

These are not the best of times.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|13|45|74}}
* 4,900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We don't need your help.

But we'll take it.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|[[Callisto Windsor]]|Steria, our research is too time sensitive and important to worry about a sick slyvern.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Steria Duskgrove]]|It won't take long. And it would be faster if I had help. Oh! There's someone!}}
:{{Text|yell|Steria Duskgrove|Pardon, fine <class>! A moment of your time?}}
