==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Cracktooth.png|Cracktooth|How many hyenas can one gnoll have, anyway?}}
Kill Cracktooth.
*[[Cracktooth]] slain

==Description==
Aha! Well, it seems that another [[gnoll]] has stepped up to assume command. Just as I expected. Yes.

Having a trusted vice-[[Warlord (rank)|warlord]] to ensure continuation of government makes perfect sense now, doesn't it? We'll just have to hit them a little harder to tumble their bureaucracy, hm?

What? Am I going to take this moment to reflect on whether I'm rushing to judgement on these gnolls? Ridiculous! They're gnolls!

Quickly now! Kill Cracktooth before the iron cools off or they arrange for an election!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|27|62}}
*10,200 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*+150 reputation with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
How goes hunting the hunter?

==Completion==
Ha! Maybe next time they'll think twice before electing a new leader!

==Notes==
Find Cracktooth at {{Co|24.2|41.8|Azure Span}}

==Progression==
{{Brackenhide Water Hole}}
