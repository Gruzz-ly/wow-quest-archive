==Objectives==
Talk to [[Willa Stronghinge|Willa]] at [[Three-Falls Lookout]] in the [[Azure Span]].

==Description==
I love waterfalls. 

Want to know what's better than a waterfall? 

Two waterfalls. 

And the only thing better than that is... well, check out Three-Falls to the west of here and you'll see!

The [[innkeeper]] there is quite nice.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|13|45|74}}
* 4,900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Welcome to Three-Falls Lookout! 

We're pretty high up, and there's rushing water everywhere--so look out!

==Notes==
West to the [[Ancient Lookout]], then north to the [[Three-Falls Lookout]] and the [[Missing Hinge Inn]], where [[Willa Stronghinge]] and [[Guo-Hee Calmwater]] are locked in a game of [[Hearthstone (game)|Hearthstone]].

Also in the area, [[Zon'Wogi]] starts [[The Great Shokhari]], and [[Modurun Sixtoes]] starts [[It's Brew Time!]].
