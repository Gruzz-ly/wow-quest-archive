==Objectives==
Rescue 6 [[Dying Mage]]s.
*[[Kirin Tor]] [[mage]]s rescued (6)
*Meet Khadgar's projection further ahead in the Vakthros Range.

==Description==
When the [[Primalists]] attacked our expedition, I feared many of our mages were lost to us.

It seems they were taken by the Primalists and are being tortured as we speak!

Please, you must rescue the mages left here. They may not be able to help in this fight, but we cannot leave them behind!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
We must aid those mages.

==Completion==
You have my thanks. We cannot forsake anyone in this fight.

==Notes==
The six [[Dying Mage]]s are marked on the minimap trapped in Elemental Drainer whirlwinds. Free them:
#{{text|say|Dying Mage|They wanted to see us tortured... they said we deserved it for using arcane magic!}}
#{{text|say|Dying Mage|They kept telling me I deserved this for studying the "titan's corruption"!}}
#{{text|say|Dying Mage|They want to destroy Azure Span... the Primalists are insane!}}
#{{text|say|Dying Mage|They could've just killed us... the Primalists wanted to see us suffer for using arcane magic.}}
#{{text|say|Dying Mage|The Primalists kept calling me the slave of the titans... all for using arcane magic!}}
#{{text|say|Dying Mage|Please help Kalecgos! They're focusing everything they have to bring him down from the sky.}}
