==Objectives==
Protect [[Valunei]] from [[decay]] [[gnoll]]s.
*Speak to Valunei in Brackenhide Hollow (Optional)
*Protect Valunei from gnolls (2)

==Description==
It makes my heart ache to see what the decay has done to some of the wildlife here...

I cannot save all the creatures that live around [[Brackenhide Hollow]], but I wish for my trial to at least save some.

In a cave to the west, there is a family of [[bear]]s that has recently been corrupted. I believe I can fight my way there and heal them. Will you help me, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Together we can at least ease some of the suffering here.

==Completion==
[[Tyr]]'s compassion for the [[vrykul]] inspires me. I think he would have compassion for animals too, do you not? They suffer and feel pain just as you or I would...

Thank you for helping me save those bears. Even a little compassion goes a long way.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Valunei|I must do something to save the creatures here from the gnolls' decay. Follow me, <name>!}}

Head to Brackenhide Hollow to find Valunei at a cave at {{Co|11.70|37.80|Azure Span}}. Speak with her.
:The bears are inside. The cubs grow more corrupted by the minute. We must act quickly!

:{{Gossip|quest=|I'm ready.}}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|The gnolls are gone for now... but keep alert. They may come back at any moment.}}

She heals [[Decaying Cub]]s and [[Decaying Den Mother]]. As she does, two [[Brackenhide Scrapper]]s attack. Kill them to fulfill the objective.

:{{Text|say|Valunei|I think I heard a gnoll cackling. We may have company soon!}}
:{{Text|say|Brackenhide Scrapper|Me make you dead!}}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|My cleanse spell does not seem strong enough for their mother! Perhaps if I lay hands on her, I can counteract the decay...}}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|It's working! The decay is gone, and I can see she is regaining her strength.}}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|Another gnoll? Keep it away while I save the last cub.}}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|I feel called to help innocents... like these cubs. That is why I was inspired to follow the path of Tyr.}}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|I could not have done this without you, <name>! I am going to see if I can help more creatures here... Then I will meet you at camp.}}
:{{Text|say|Brackenhide Scrapper|Rot... eat us all...}}
:{{Text|say|Brackenhide Scrapper|Me... rot now?}}
