'''Community Feasts''' is the unlock quest for [[Community Feast]]s in [[Iskaara]]. [[Rowie]] will run up and offer this quest when you reach Renown level 3 with the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Big Kinook]] in [[Iskaara]] in The [[Azure Span]].

==Description==
There you are, <name>! The soup's on! 

You better hurry up and get to Iskaara. Big Kinook has been looking for you. 

One time he told me to get a slimy, icky spinefish for the soup and I didn't want to, so I yelled: "No, chef!"

He was so mad I thought he was going to throw me in the soup!

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Community Feasts|Unlock the [[Community Feast]] activity overseen by [[Big Kinook]] throughout the day.|id=388961|icon=inv_cooking_80_minorfeast}}

==Completion==
Are you ready to make magic, adventurer? 

No, I don't mean that hand wavy stuff some like to make. I mean the mystical aroma arts, the deep knowledge of ingredients and flavor, and the way a soup speaks to you to let you know what it needs. Is that you salivating? No? Must be me. 

Let's get cooking!
