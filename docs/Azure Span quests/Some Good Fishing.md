==Objectives==
Catch 3 blue-tailed minnows within [[Khuri's Fishing Spot]].
*Fishing skill learned from [[Khuri]]
*Get a [[Fishing Pole (Azure Span)|fishing pole]] (Optional)
*[[Blue-Tailed Minnow]] fished (3)

==Description==
Another pair of hands! I could use some help catching enough fish to bring home for a meal.

These [[Kirin Tor]] seem concerned about something called magical anomalies in the area, whatever that means.

You're all welcome to stay here as long as you pitch in and help out.

Grab a fishing pole and start fishing. Many hands make light work!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Let me know if you need a few tips.

==Completion==
Ah, that will do nicely! Thank you, [[adventurer]].
