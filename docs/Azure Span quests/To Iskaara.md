==Objectives==
Meet [[Brena]] in [[Iskaara]].

==Description==
Thank you, <name>, for all your help. My family is safe because of you.

Now, we can finally return to Iskaara and see old [[Ponoliak]] taken back to the sea. He was my mentor, and a fine [[chieftain]].

Please, you must join us! A celebration of the [[Cycle of the Sea]] is something all can share in.

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
:{{Abilities|Iskaara Tuskarr Renown|Unlock Renown levels for the Iskaara Tuskarr faction.|id=395584|icon=ui_majorfaction_centaur}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Completion==
I'm so glad you have come to join us.

I must ask you to be patient, however. There is still much to be prepared for the ceremony.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Kalecgos]]|I should get back to the [[Azure Archives]] now. I'm glad I was able to help your people, Brena.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Nonsense, you must join us as well! Nothing could be more important than a warm bowl of soup after a difficult battle. And I thought you would want to discuss the other Gleamcoves!}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Others? You know the locations of more [[ley lines]]?}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Oh, none so large as the one in [[Brackenhide Hollow|Brackenhide]]. But there are many smaller ones scattered about. I have some maps I can show you once we reach Iskaara...}}
:''The three set off for Iskaara.''

;Entering Iskaara
:{{Text|say|[[Hanu]]|Norukk, thank goodness you're safe.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Norukk]]|Oh, yes yes! And I learned much! You see, the decay gnolls...}}

Approach the chieftain's hut in the center of town, where Kalcegos and a mirror image of Khadgar are wrapping up a conversation:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I'm sorry for the delay. I'll join you soon, but I think these [[tuskarr]] may have some valuable information.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|There's no need for concern. Everything is calm up at the tower, I have it perfectly under control.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|What a charming town! Why don't you relax a bit? Take it easy for once, Kalec.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I... yes. It's been a while. Please let me know the moment you need anything. I won't be long.}}

==Progression==
