==Objectives==
Find [[Kirygosa]] in The Jade Forest in [[Pandaria]].
*Take the [[Portal to Jade Forest|portal]] from [[Azure Archives]] to The [[Jade Forest]]

==Description==
Kirygosa wrote me after leaving [[Stranglethorn]] some years ago. She said it was beautiful and balmy, but not very quiet. I presume--and hope--she has found peace in Pandaria.

If I am honest with myself, I should not be surprised that she hasn't answered [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]]' call. Yet, we must do our duty and seek her out. If I am doubly honest with myself, I would have any excuse to see her again.

Let us take a break from these chilly winds and visit the Jade Forest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
And who might you be?

==Completion==
...[[Kalecgos]]?!

==Notes==
Upon accept, Kalec opens a portal and enters it. On the other side of the portal:
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Ah... hear the bird calls!}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Kirygosa|Kalec... it's good to see you.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|It's been too long.}}
:{{Text|say|Kirygosa|Hello and welcome to you, too. I am Kirygosa.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|This is my friend, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Kirygosa|Oh! I think I know of you -- news of your exploits have reached even [[Dawn's Blossom|this humble village]]. We are honored to have you.}}
:{{Text|say|Kirygosa|I suspect you must have important business here?}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Somewhat, yes. Have you heard the call of the Isles? The [[Blue dragonflight|blue flight]] awaits.}}
:{{Text|say|Kirygosa|...Yes. I have heard.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Ah. <Name>, while we catch up, why don't you take a stroll around the village? There is much to do and see.}}

==Progression==
