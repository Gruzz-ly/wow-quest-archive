==Completion==
Do you wanna be a great big soup master, too? 

I can't wait until I can see over the lip of the [[Communal Pot|big pot]]! Then I'll finally be big enough to lead a feast!

Here, this is for you! It'll help you on your soupy journey! Let me know if you wanna trade for anything else!

==Notes==
*This quest appears to be bugged, as some characters will not be offered any rewards. However, the items can still be purchased through [[Lil Ki]].
