==Objectives==
Slay Ice Slitherers and Ice Borers near the [[Kauriq Gleamlet]].
*[[Vicious Ice Slitherer]] slain (10)
*[[Vicious Ice Borer]] slain (3)
*Meet [[Ruriq]] at Kauriq Gleamlet.

==Description==
These [[Worm|wyrms]] don't belong here. I don't know what's driven them from their underground lairs, but there's no way to help them, now.

We can't allow them to destroy the native life here.

Slay the wyrms, <name>. Keep their parts, if you must, and find me in the Gleamlet when you're done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Be careful--some wyrms hide beneath the earth.

==Completion==
It's a pity to wipe out any natural life... even troublesome ones.

==Notes==
