'''Breaching the Brackenhide''' begins the "Decayed Roots" chapter of the [[Azure Span storyline]].

==Objectives==
Investigate [[Brackenhide Outskirts]].
*North area investigated {{co|18.4|34.7|Azure Span}}
*South area investigated {{co|18.9|37.0|Azure Span}}
*West area investigated {{co|17.6|36.9|Azure Span}}

==Description==
If the [[gnoll]]s here have discovered [[decay]] [[magic]], the [[ley line]] and even the land itself are in grave danger.

My [[Projection|mirror images]] are spread too thin to withstand the [[elemental]] disruption of this scale. Please enter the forest and investigate the decay.

I'll work with our new [[tuskarr]] friends to find a place I can maintain my image. Then, I will meet you deeper in the forest.

We must put a stop to this!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Can you sense the disruption of magic all around us?

==Completion==
You may want to cover your mouth. You don't want to breathe in the decay.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Brena]]|I don't know who you are, mage, but thank you.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I'm just someone trying to help this land heal.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Then our goals are aligned. Investigate the decay, <name>, and we'll find a safe spot further in.}}
:''Kalecgos's mirror image teleports away.''
:{{text|say|Brena|[[Norukk]], can you help us slip by the gnolls?}}
:{{text|say|Norukk|If it's gnolls, I know just the thing!}}
:''The two don bushy disguises and sneak along the road before disappearing.''

In addition, the bonus objective [[Stop the Spread]] also activates. Kill anything that moves for a hefty chunk of [[Iskaara Tuskarr]] reputation. No need to grind to finish the bonus objective for this quest -- the follow-ups also take place in the same area! The player has the Kalecgos' Aid buff, and another mirror image will teleport in when combat starts to help out:
*{{Text|say|Kalecgos|You're not alone!}}
*{{Text|say|Kalecgos|On your left!}}
*{{Text|say|Kalecgos|I've got your back!}}
*{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Hang in there!}}

The three [[Rotting Root]]s are marked on the minimap in the quest area. North root:
:The root is leeching a foul sludge into the small pool of water.

:{{gossip|<Cut the root.>}}

South root:
:Out of the corner of your eye, something catches your attention. Did the root just move?

:{{gossip|<Cut the root.>}}

At the west root, the corpse of [[Kaqiata]] can also be found:
:The sludge oozing from the root corrodes the nearby grass as you watch.

:The stench is unbearable.

:{{gossip|<Cut the root.>}}

After cutting the third root:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|This is bad, <name>! Join us quickly. The decay is out of control!}}

Find Kalecgos, [[Norukk]], and [[Brena]] just west of the western root:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|They're infusing an [[Ancient]] with that rot! It could spread decay around the Span faster than a wildfire!}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Have the gnolls gone mad? Don't they see what they are doing to themselves?}}

==Progression==
{{Decayed Roots}}
