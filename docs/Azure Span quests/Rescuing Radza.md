==Objectives==
Rescue Radza Thunderclaw.
*Speak to [[Radza Thunderclaw]] (Optional) {{Co|60.98|51.40|Azure Span}}
*Radza Thunderclaw defended
*Meet Radza Thunderclaw in [[Rustpine Den]].

==Description==
Radza Thunderclaw is our Spiritkeeper. She holds true our traditions and history.

[[Primalist]] beliefs go against everything [[Rustpine clan|our clan]] holds true. I knew she would defy [[Stoneheart]]!

Stoneheart will do anything to bring her to heel. No one is [[chieftain]] without Radza's blessing!

Narn says [[Khargall Fivefangs]], the Chieftain's guard, is trying to break her. If Radza dies, our clan dies with her.

Go aid her, <name>, and be ready. He will not let her go without a fight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Winterpelt Furbolg]]

==Completion==
So many of my clan have fallen in battle with their brothers and sisters... all for the promise of power.

<Radza utters a guttural growl which fades into a long, mournful whisper.>

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{Text|say|Garz|Find Narn when you have done what I asked.}}
:{{Text|say|Garz|Do not worry.}}
:{{Text|say|Garz|He can fend for himself.}}

Find Radza at {{Co|60.98|51.40|Azure Span}}, held by a [[Rustpine Loamcrafter]]:
:{{Text|say|Rustpine Loamcrafter|Join us, Radza, or suffer forever!}}

Speak with Radza after defeating the Loamcrafter:
:The soul of the earth... I hear it!

:No! It is... Primalist trickery... I must... resist.

:Huh? Who are you? Did Garz send you?

:Leave me! If my kin find you here...

:{{Gossip|I am prepared to fight off your captors.}}
:{{Text|say|Radza Thunderclaw|They're coming!}}

The attacking waves count for Former Furbolg Family, so make sure to leave some room in the quota! A Rustpine Loamcrafter and two [[Stonegrabber Fragment]]s attack, followed by two [[Rustpine Rager]]s, then finally [[Khargall Fivefangs]]:
:{{Text|say|Khargall Fivefangs|Radza belongs with us!}}
:{{Text|say|Khargall Fivefangs|Radza... the power... why can you not see?}}
:{{Text|say|Radza Thunderclaw|Karghall... my old friend. How far you have fallen.}}
:{{Text|say|Radza Thunderclaw|How I wish it were not so.}}

;Upon completion of all three
:{{Text|say|Radza Thunderclaw|Is that [[Garz]]?}}
:''Garz jumps to Narn.''
:{{Text|say|Narn|Your little <class> friend has done well, Garz.}}
:{{Text|say|Radza Thunderclaw|They fight like a furbolg: tooth and claw.}}
:{{Text|say|Radza Thunderclaw|But now... will they claw out our clan's heart to save its spirit?}}

==Progression==
