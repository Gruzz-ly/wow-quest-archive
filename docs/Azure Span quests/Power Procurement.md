==Objectives==
Gather energy within [[Imbued Arcana Vessel|the vessel]] for [[Warpcaster Delandra]] at [[Camp Antonidas]].
*[[Energized Arcana Vessel|Energy captured]]

==Description==
In normal circumstances, the capture of energy is not problematic. However, the energy we require is massive and unstable. This enchanted vessel should provide a safe means of transport.

There is a region to the southwest filled with energy-laden creatures. The anomalous energy within these creatures is powerful, but unstable.

Capture their energy and return it to me. Then we may embark on the remainder of this journey together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you collected what we discussed?

==Completion==
Oh my. The warmth within the vessel is fascinating.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Warpcaster Delandra|Take good care of that. The materials are not easy to come by.}}

Head to the [[Azure Archives]]. There, a bar labeled "Captured Energy" will appear on the screen. Fill it by slaying [[Pacified Attendant]]s (10 points of energy), [[Attentive Guardian]]s (10 points), and [[Stabilized Elemental]]s (5 points).

Once the bar is filled, the provided [[Imbued Arcana Vessel]] becomes an [[Energized Arcana Vessel]].
