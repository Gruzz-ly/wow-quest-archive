==Objectives==
Get [[Marithos]] to safety in the [[Azure Span]].
*Escort [[Amythora]] and Marithos to safety

==Description==
He needs to be healed--now.

We're too out in the open here. [[Sundered Flame]] loyalists could ambush us at any time.

Let's find cover somewhere so we can assess his wounds.

Cover me!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
You moved Marithos on your own?

That was very risky.

But you were right. Marithos is gravely injured, and we do not have much time.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Sundered Agitator|They're making off with the prisoner!}}
:{{text|say|Amythora|<Name>, cover me!}}
:''Amythora picks up Marithos and runs off.''

Two sets of two [[Sundered Agitator]]s ambush. Fend them both off, then run up the hill to the east to catch up with them and [[Scalecommander Emberthal]].
