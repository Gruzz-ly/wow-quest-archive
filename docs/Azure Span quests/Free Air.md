==Objectives==
Destroy 4 Lava Beacons.
*[[Lava Beacon|Lava beacon]] destroyed (4)
*Meet [[Kalecgos]] in a cave within [[Vakthros Summit]].

==Description==
The [[Primalists]] are using these massive orbs here to hold off [[Kalecgos]]. 

At this rate, Kalecgos will be too injured to continue the fight. If he falls, I won't be able to fend off [[Raszageth]].

The empowered gem you hold should allow you to disguise yourself as an elemental to sneak ahead.

Use the gem to destroy the orbs. That should give Kalecgos room to unleash his power.

I will focus my attention on shielding the tower from Raszageth.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Now it's time to show the Primalists the true might of the Aspect of the blue dragonflight!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I will focus my efforts on shielding the tower. As long as that stands, we have a chance to stop Raszageth.}}
:''Khadgar's mirror image teleports away.''

Players gain access to an [[Extra Action Button]] here:
:{{Abilities|Elemental Disguise|Transform into a fire elemental, allowing you to move through Vakthros Summit.|id=378814|icon=ability_mage_livingbomb}}

Use it, as the Lava Beacons are all surrounded by elite [[Fire Elemental (Azure Span)|Fire Elementals]]. While in Elemental Disguise form, all elementals and primalists turn neutral instead of hostile. Players also have access to the following abilities:
#{{Abilities|Ember Dash|Dash forward through the air.|notes=Instant. 3 sec recharge. Max 3 charges|id=378811|icon=rogue_burstofspeed}}
#{{Abilities|Hide|Burrow underground to hide from enemy sight and lightning strikes. Use again to emerge.|notes=Instant|id=378820|icon=ability_vanish}}
<ol start="6"><li>{{Abilities|Cancel Disguise|Remove the fire elemental disguise from yourself.|notes=Instant|id=392120|icon=ability_vehicle_launchplayer}}</li></ol>

Move freely around the elite fire elementals, but avoid the [[Ritual Scout]]s, who have truesight and will instantly break the disguise!

Break the fourth:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|That did it... I can use my mirror images once more! Meet me within the nearby cavern.}}

Approach Kalecgos:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Over here! I've found an area to take cover for a moment.}}
