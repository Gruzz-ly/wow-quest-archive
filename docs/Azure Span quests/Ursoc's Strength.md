==Objectives==
Gain [[Ursoc]]'s blessing.
* [[Ursoc]] Contacted {{co|72.9|18.1|Azure Span}}
* Ursoc's Blessing Gained

==Description==
[[File:Ursoc's Totem.jpg|thumb|Ursoc's Totem]]
It has been many years since we last offered sacrifices to mighty Ursoc, but we will need his blessing if we are to restore balance among our people.

His shrine is hidden in the mountains to the east where few would stumble upon it by chance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Seek Ursoc's shrine in the mountains east of here.

==Completion==
Thank you, outsider. Though the news you bring is grim, we will honor Ursoc's memory as best we are able.

==Notes==
[[File:Ursoc's Faithful.jpg|thumb|Ursoc's Faithful]]

East of the [[Winterpelt Hollow]] up a frozen waterfall is a small frozen-over spring. At the eastern end of the area is [[Ursoc's Totem]]. Interact with it:
:{{text|say|Ursoc's Faithful|Who are you to call upon Ursoc, outsider?}}

A ghost of [[Ursoc's Faithful]] appears. Speak with the furbolg:
:Ursoc fell in battle with the Nightmare. Now he has passed beyond even our sight.
:Only we faithful remain to honor his memory.
:The Winterpelt have long spurned our lord. If you seek our blessing in their stead, you must first prove that you, at least, are worthy.
:Only in combat will the truth of your character be revealed.
:Are you willing, <class>?
:{{gossip|I am willing.}}
:{{text|say|Ursoc's Faithful|Then let us begin!}}
:''The furbolg ghost shifts into bear form and attacks!''

Get it to 50% and it will end combat:
:{{text|say|Ursoc's Faithful|You have a stout heart, newcomer. Perhaps there is hope yet for the Winterpelt.}}
:{{text|say|Ursoc's Faithful|You have our blessing. Take it and honor Ursoc's memory.}}

On return, nearly all of the [[Winterpelt Furbolg]] and a few members of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]] have gathered in the cave. Many have gossip, noted in the [[Champion of the Winterpelt]] article.
