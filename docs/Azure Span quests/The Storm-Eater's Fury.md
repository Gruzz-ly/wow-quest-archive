==Objectives==
Ride [[Khadgar]]'s flying disc and hold off the Primalist army.
*[[Arcane Disc]] boarded
*Primalist army repelled (150)
*Storm funnels dispelled (3)
*Primalist army repelled (200)
*Speak with [[Kalecgos]]  at the base of [[Vakthros]].

==Description==
[[Raszageth]] is attempting to rip all the arcane magic out of the tower so she can destroy it!

Kalecgos is doing what he can to hold her back, and I am using my magic to try to replenish the [[ley line|ley energy]].

I fear we will not last much longer. As we speak, more [[Primalists]] make their way up here to overwhelm us!

Take my modified Arcane Disc. Hold off the incoming Primalists... and let us hope for a miracle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Completion==
Raszageth has fled, Vakthros is stabilized... and more [[blue dragon]]s have arrived.

I think we can rest for a moment now.

==Notes==
Hop on the [[Arcane Disc]] a few yards to Khadgar's right and the camera tracks away to look at Raszageth:
:{{text|say|Raszageth|Your cause is hopeless! Soon this land will lie in ruins, just like [[Blue dragonflight|your dragonflight]]!}}
:{{ClassIcon|Shaman|small}} {{text|say|Raszageth|Your command of elemental forces would have been a boon to our cause. But you will fall just like the rest!}}
*{{text|say|Raszageth|Another mortal meddling with forces they do not comprehend. Die alongside your [[dragon]] masters!}}
*{{Text|say|Raszageth|Pathetic mortals, cowering behind the blue dragons and their titan magic! You will die alongside them!}}<!-- blood elf rogue -->

As it pans back to the player, the battlefield is full of hostile fire elementals and friendly arcane elementals. Use the disc's #1 ability to kill time (and enemies!) while the #2 ability comes off cooldown:
#{{Abilities|Arcane Blast|Fires a powerful arcane blast into an area, dealing massive damage to any enemies within it.|range=200|cd=1 sec|notes=Instant|id=394720|icon=spell_arcane_arcanetorrent}}
#{{Abilities|Kalecgos's Aid|See if Kalecgos has built up enough energy to aid you in the fight against the primalist army.|cd=45 sec|notes=Instant|id=394760|icon=inv_misc_head_dragon_blue}}

Once Kalecgos's Aid comes off cooldown, hit it:
:''The camera pulls back to see Kalecgos wind up a breath attack, and unleashes it, automatically killing enemies.''

Get to 150 kills:
:{{text|say|Raszageth|<cackles>}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|There! Below!}}

Players gain access to a new ability as the Disc Stability bar starts falling:
<ol start="3"><li>{{Abilities|Azure Dispel|Call out a target for Kalecgos to dispel.|range=200|cd=1.5|notes=Instant|id=396373|icon=spell_arcane_massdispel}}</li></ol>

Use it to take out the three storm funnels, then the phase advances again:
:{{text|say|Raszageth|Minions of the storm, hear my call!}}
:{{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|The shield won't last much longer!}}

Air elementals start attacking alongside the fire elementals! Kalecgos's aid is on a 15-sec cooldown this time, so use it to help take out 200:
:{{text|say|Raszageth|I may not be able to destroy this tower, but I will have my prize!}}

An [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] starts:
{{#ev:youtube|EqoSBGMVlBU}}
:''Raszageth launches a lightning breath attack at Kalecgos, which takes him out and hits the tower. The feedback interrupts Khadgar's channeling as Kalecgos falls from the sky.''
:{{text|say|Raszageth|Weakling... you need a mortal to defend you!}}
:{{text|say|Raszageth|Abominations, both of you... and you will perish here, cold and alone!}}
:''Raszageth launches another lightning breath attack, but an arcane shield pops up to protect Kalecgos, Khadgar, and the adventurer at the last second.''
:{{text|say|Senegos|He is not alone!}}
:''A number of blue dragons fly in to defend.''
:{{text|say|Raszageth|You have failed, "[[Dragon Aspect|Aspect]]". You will soon learn that killing you would have been a mercy.}}
:''Raszageth takes flight and leaves.''
:{{text|say|Raszageth|Now you can watch your empire collapse alongside your [[Alexstrasza|false queen]].}}

After the cutscene, [[Eragosa]], [[Tharkago]], [[Vexalgos]], [[Stellagosa]], [[Senegos]], and [[Emmigosa]] are looking at Kalecgos.
