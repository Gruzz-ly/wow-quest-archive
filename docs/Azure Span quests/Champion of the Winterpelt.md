Present are [[Kranac Sagesnow]], [[Glohza Brightfur]], [[Radza Thunderclaw]], [[Kazzi]], [[Tyre Coppercog]], [[Sonova Snowden]], [[Elynae Dawnbreaker]], [[Little Toz]], [[Jyrra "Fuzzy Feet" Coldsoar]], [[Elder Mhaz]], [[Lialyn Summersong]], [[Matron Fherg]], [[Garz]], [[Fizzle Swiftsprocket]], [[Valandrus Shadowstar]], [[Jhgaza the Wordkeeper]], and a handful of unnamed defenders, guardians, and snowspeakers.

;Glohza Brightfur: Was it you that encouraged Toz to talk to me?
: I was waiting for him to say something!
;Elder Mhaz: I am glad I was able to see Saza one last time. It is better to focus on the smile she brought to us.
: She wanted us to believe in you, and that's what I'm going to do.
;Jyrra "Fuzzy Feet" Coldsoar: Saza's energy and tenacity will be missed. 
: I regret that I didn't try harder to stop her, but trying to stop Saza was akin to trying to slow an avalanche!
;Matron Fherg: The Winterpelt still must take action, to venture into the world.
: The time of sitting and waiting as the world rolls past us must end. We appreciate your outlook on these strange cultures we have yet to meet.
;Little Toz: Thank you again for the advice about talking to Glozha Brightfur. I was very nervous.
: She has acccepted my proposal!
