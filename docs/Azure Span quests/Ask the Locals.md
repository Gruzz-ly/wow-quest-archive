:{{text|say|Noriko the All-Remembering|The tuskarr will talk your ears off, if you let them!}}

[[Korrikunit the Whalebringer]] to the northeast, spear in hand:
:Been too long on land.

:{{gossip|Do you know of any ley lines in the area?}}
:{{text|say|Korrikunit the Whalebringer|What now? Lake lines? You mean rivers? What nonsense are you on about?}}

[[Jokomuupat]] is immediately across the road to the east:
:I don't remember the ice of the mountains reaching so far west. I wonder if it's spread south all the way to [[Imbu]].

:{{gossip|I'm looking for pockets of concentrated magic in the Azure Span.}}
:{{text|say|Jokomuupat|There's magic in the land everywhere! It's in every rock, plant, animal... Why, the legend of Foxrose Fourtoes goes... There once was...}}

[[Babunituk]] is to the southeast, by a campfire with [[Aluyk the Peddler]], [[Rok]], [[Niqu]], [[Racquili]], and a [[Tuskarr Traveler]]:
:Soup isn't ready yet. You'll have to wait a bit.

:{{gossip|I'm looking for crystals. Purple crystals. In caves.}}
:{{text|say|Babunituk|Oh, the Gleamcoves? Yes, they're everywhere! We try not to disturb them.}}
:{{text|say|Babunituk|Chieftain [[Ponoliak]] knows more about that kind of thing.}}
:{{text|say|Racquili|Ponoliak passed. Remember? [[Brena]] is [[chieftain]] now.}}
:{{text|say|Babunituk|Ah, that's right. She was here with the [[Funerary practices|funeral]] [[caravan]] not long ago. You just missed her!}}
