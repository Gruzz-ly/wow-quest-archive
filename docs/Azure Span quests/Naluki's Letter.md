==Objectives==
Deliver [[Naluki]]'s fishhead to [[Old Grimtusk]].

==Description==
Let me guess, Grim told you not to open the letter, right?

Looks like you did as you were told. No wonder he trusts you so much!

Give him this fish head for me. He'll know what it means.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<It's hard to tell, but you think you see a slight smile on Grimtusk's face. It quickly fades away.>

This will do.

==Progression==
