'''Skewering Even Bigger Fish''' becomes available when you reach [[Renown]] level 18 with the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]. This quest has no rewards; it exists only to direct you to [[Tavio]], who can craft upgrades for your [[Iskaaran Harpoon]].

==Completion==
How is that harpoon working for you? I'd love to hear the tale of your biggest catch with it!

Now, what if I told you we could make harpooning even easier? I have some new designs that will do just that. Take a look!
