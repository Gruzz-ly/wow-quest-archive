==Objectives==
Heal 6 Wounded Guardians using the provided bandages or your own abilities.
* Allies healed (6)
* [[Enchanted Bandage]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[djaradin]] struck without warning, <name>. Our people are capable fighters, but no one escapes a battle like this unscathed.

Please, help with the wounded. Many are trapped behind the enemy lines and can't make their way back in their current state.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
There are always more wounded that need healing.

==Completion==
Fewer deaths is always worth celebrating. We have lost enough as it is.

==Notes==
Look for [[Gruff Fisher]]s with the blood drop over their heads and interact with them to heal them. Once healed, they can say any of:
*{{text|say|That's enough to get me movin'. My thanks.}}
*{{text|say|Thank you for the save. I will never forget this.}}
*{{text|say|Wasn't expecting a <class> out here. My thanks.}}
*{{text|say|That ugly one had a nasty reach.}}
*{{text|say|Well... now this will be a story to tell. Thank you!}}
*{{text|say|I... almost had them. I swear.}}
*{{Text|say|This is almost as bad as when I took an arrow to the knee.}}

==Progression==
{{Fyrakk Assaults}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.1.0|note=Added.}}
