==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Frostfist.jpg|Frostfist|A malicious giant who revels in playing with his prey.}}
Investigate the top of the glacier that overlooks [[Camp Antonidas]].
*[[Frostfist's Eye]]
*Speak to [[Hemet Nesingwary Jr.]] in [[Camp Nowhere]].

==Description==
I've heard whispers while passing through Camp Antonidas. Talk of mutilated fauna being found across the icy steppes. Some nothing more than bloody splatters.

Whatever it is, it's got the [[mage]]s scared and made the local wildlife scarce.

Poke around the top of the glacier. If I was a betting [[dwarf]], I'd say that's where any apex predator worth its salt would stake its claim.

Bring me a piece of it so we can soothe the [[Kirin Tor]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|53|82|96}}
*9,800 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*+150 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Be careful. Whatever this thing is, it's strong. And relentless.

==Completion==
An [[ice giant]]? By [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]]'s bronze beard... And you're in one piece too! Impressive.

I'll show this to the Kirin Tor. Now maybe they'll get off our backs!

==Notes==
[[Frostfist]] can be found in the [[Upper Frostlands]].{{Co|49.12|36.56|Azure Span}}
