'''Astonishing Academic Acquisitions''' is a [[repeatable quest]] from [[Sonova Snowden]] in the [[Winterpelt Hollow]]. Each [[Intact Scribe Stick]] is worth one skill point of the 99 necessary to cap the Language: Furbolg skill. Unlike daily or weekly quests, this quest can be repeated as often as desired.

Snowden will only offer this quest if players have a stick in their inventory.

==Objectives==
Recover an Intact Scribe Stick from [[Primalists]] in the [[Azure Span]].
* [[Intact Scribe Stick]]

==Description==
Where did ya get that beauty?

Tha Primalists seem a lot more interested in destroying civilizations than preserving their history, which makes a find like this all tha more precious.

I'll get out me good rubbing stick for this one!

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
: {{abilities|Knowledge: Winterpelt|Increases your understanding of the Winterpelt language.|id=403661|image=|notes=+1 skill}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|80|9}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I cannae wait to get to work on this!

==Completion==
Nothing like a fresh artifact to start tha day off right.

==Notes==
While gathering [[Liberated Furbolg Artifacts]] for [[Additional Academic Acquisitions]], any creatures that can drop the artifacts have a slim chance at dropping an Intact Scribe Stick. The four locations are: [[Vakthros Range]] {{co|76|38|Azure Span}}, the [[Rustpine Den]] {{co|61|52|Azure Span}}, [[Imbu]] {{co|58|67|Azure Span}}, and [[Shiverweb Vale]] {{co|50|62|Azure Span}}. Pick whichever.
