==Objectives==
Speak with Rauvros.
*Speak to [[Rauvros]]

==Description==
I know you and [[Ranpiata|Ran]] are simply trying to be helpful.

I don't think there's any helping me. My spark--my will to paint--is simply... gone.

But Ran is right. I owe you at least to try.

Bring this budding artist friend of yours to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
All I need is a chance to prove myself.

==Completion==
I cannot believe it! A chance to learn from the master himself!

Oh, goodness... I do hope he likes my work.
