==Objectives==
Free 6 Cocooned Survivors in [[Shiverweb Vale]].
*[[Cocooned Survivor]] freed (6)

==Description==
Many of my friends and colleagues were captured when the [[Ice spider|arachnid]]s and their [[Primalist]] masters attacked.

I saw them being bound in frozen webbing and dragged away to a fate I dare not consider.

Please free any of them that you can!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*9,800 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Have you found them?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I feared I would never see any of them again.
