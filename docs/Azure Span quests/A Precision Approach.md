==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Flayfist.png|Flayfist|What chance do they have without their beloved leader?}}
Kill Flayfist.
*[[Flayfist]] slain

==Description==
[[Gnoll]]s are awful creatures. Smelly. Always scratching, laughing at you. And there are multitudes here and more are constantly arriving. We, and by that I mean you, could reap them like wheat for days and never get anywhere. They can't be suffered to stay here.

We must strike at the heart of the snake! Remove their leadership and they'll be paralyzed with indecision and despair. 

What do you mean why are we doing this? Isn't it obvious? They're gnolls! What more reason could one need?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|27|62}}
*10,200 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*+150 reputation with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Did I mention I'm allergic to gnoll fur? My throat gets itchy just thinking about them.

==Completion==
How they must despair!

==Notes==
Flayfist is inside the cave {{Co|24.8|39|Azure Span}}.

==Progression==
{{Brackenhide Water Hole}}

==Alpha version==
;Description

Instead, we must strike at the heart of the snake! Remove their leadership and they'll be paralysed{{sic}} with indecision and despair. Why, it will takes{{sic}} weeks just to arrange the state funeral!
