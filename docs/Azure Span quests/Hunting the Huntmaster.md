==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Huntmaster Krakle.jpg|Huntmaster Krakle|A wicked gnoll who takes great pleasure in torturing innocent wildlife.}}
Hunt down [[Huntmaster Krakle]] around [[Imbu's Shield]].
*[[Krakle's Trigger Paw]]
*Speak to [[Hemet Nesingwary Jr.]] in Camp Nowhere.

==Description==
I heard from one of the guards in [[Camp Nowhere]] that there's a nasty piece of work mutilating the local wildlife. Calls itself a 'huntmaster'.

Hunting is one thing, but I can't abide torturing any living thing.

Besides, [[Nesingwary's Wagon|my wagon]] could use a good luck charm.

<[[Hemet Nesingwary|Nesingwary]] spits over the side.>

Bring me back its paw.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|53|82|96}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +150 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
How goes the hunt?

==Completion==
Ah, looks like you were successful.

Good.

Here's hoping the [[critter]]s around here can rest a bit more easily.

==Notes==
Huntmaster Krakle is sneaking around in [[Timbertooth Trail]].{{Co|56.90|53.15|Azure Span}}
