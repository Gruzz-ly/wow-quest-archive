==Objectives==
Use the Ice Cold Antidote on [[Alia Sunsoar]].
*Ice Cold Antidote administered
*Speak with Alia Sunsoar.
*[[Ice Cold Antidote]] (provided)

==Description==
All right, the antidote is ready. I'll keep Alia steady. You pour what's in the vial into her mouth.

I hope she will live... we'll need her magic to track down [[Valthrux|this artifact]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Completion==
You have my thanks... I thought I would die before acquiring this artifact.

==Notes==
Clink on Alia to administer the cure.

:{{Text|say|[[Kattigat]]|Hang in there, Alia. We won't find the artifact before the [[Sundered Flame]] if you die now!}}
:{{Text|say|[[To'tik]]|This is a fool's errand. We should cure [[Blood elf|the elf]] and report back to [[Iskaara]] what we've found.}}
:{{Text|say|Kattigat|Iskaara! By then the Sundered Flame will have the artifact. Who knows how much devastation they'd cause?}}
:''Alia stands up and moves to To'tik.''
:{{Text|say|Alia Sunsoar|Thank you all. We've lost valuable time. We must move quickly to recover Valthrux.}}
:{{Text|say|To'tik|We must use caution to avoid ending up like the Sundered Flame in the [[ice spider]] caverns.}}

==Progression==
