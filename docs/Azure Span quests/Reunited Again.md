==Objectives==
Listen to [[Kalecgos]]'s speech.
*Listen to Kalecgos's speech

==Description==
Thanks to you, <name>, all of the [[blue dragon]]s are accounted for. We can get back to caring for [[Azeroth]]'s [[magic]] and making sure its power isn't abused.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
