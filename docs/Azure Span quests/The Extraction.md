==Objectives==
Rescue [[tuskarr]] from the [[Snowhide Camp]] in the [[Azure Span]].
*Missing tuskarr found

==Description==
Right now the most important thing is to bring back my people. Preferably in one piece.

And as much as it pains me to say this, I'm in no condition to fight them on my own.

Will you help us?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You smell like death... Frostbite likes that.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Old Grimtusk|[[Gnolls]]... they came out of nowhere. Outnumbered, we had no chance.}}
:{{Text|say|Old Grimtusk|They took the others with them. Probably thought I was dead.}}
:{{Text|say|Old Grimtusk|But... there's still a chance they're alive. Follow me.}}
:''Grimtusk stands up and heads towards [[Snowhide Camp]].''

Find a group of frozen [[Tuskarr Captive]]s in the center of the camp, with Frostbite captured in a cage.
:{{Text|say|Frostbite|How... unfortunate.}}
