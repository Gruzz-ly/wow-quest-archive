==Description==
Ah, I see my apprentices have roped you into their little games.

<Noriko chuckles.>

It appears they--and you--have stumbled onto something. The purpose behind these ruins is slowly revealing itself to us, and there's more than faded images and song...

Something calls out from atop this tower.

I see the intrigue in your eyes. Go. You have my permission.

See what you can see.

* {{cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Remembrance is a gift--and a burden.

==Completion==
To watch your world crumble into ruin and think it lost forever...

I cannot imagine.

We must remember.

==Notes==
Speak to Noriko to get to the upper area of the tower:
:{{Gossip|Can you send me to the top of the tower?}}

Once there, interact with the Ancient Remains:
:''The ghost of [[Divo Songscale]] appears.''
:{{Text|say|Divo Songscale|Be you friend?}}
:{{Text|say|Divo Songscale|This place was once a monument to love. Now it is a ruin.}}
:{{Text|say|Divo Songscale|In the chamber below rages the parts of my soul which I poured into these works. It will not rest.}}
:{{Text|emote|The spirit gestures to the room below.}}
:{{Text|say|Divo Songscale|Please, let me rest.}}

Jump to the chamber below and attack the hostile Echo of Loss. Mid-fight:
:{{Text|say|Echo of Loss|My work! Woe betide these crumbling walls!}}
:{{Text|say|Echo of Loss|Lord Malygos...Lady Sindragosa...}}

==Progression==
{{Into the Archives}}
