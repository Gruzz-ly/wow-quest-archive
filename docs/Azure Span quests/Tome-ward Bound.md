==Objectives==
Speak with Kalecgos to open the portal, then use what he summons to take out the [[Brackenhide Putrifier]]s and then destroy the Twisted Ancient.
*Speak to [[Kalecgos]]
*[[Tome of Spellflinging]] ridden
*[[Brackenhide Putrifier]] (3) {{co|15.9|38.4|Azure Span}} {{co|15.2|38.0|Azure Span}} {{co|15.6|37.3|Azure Span}}
*[[Twisted Ancient (Azure Span)|Twisted Ancient]] slain {{co|15.7|38.0|Azure Span}}

==Description==
We must stop that tree! With these ley crystals, I can finally help.

Speak with me when you are ready. I'll open a portal into the [[Azure Archives]] and try to bring out something useful.

Stand back, it may be rather unstable.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of these rewards:
|Windswept Slippers
|Twisted Leather Moccasins
|Bramble Chain Sabatons
|Sleet Shined Stompers
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
This should be interesting!

==Completion==
You did well, hero, thank you.

That tree was probably not their only pool of decay, but it was the riskiest one for the tuskarr and this ley line. With it gone, this area may be able to recover. It will take time, but it will heal.

I'm glad we were able to give the spirits of those tuskarr some peace.

==Notes==
Speak with Kalecgos again:
:Pardon me if I'm a little distracted. Have you ever tried to maintain so many mirror images at such distance?

:What a headache.

:{{gossip|I'm ready.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|The Azure Archives have a vast collection of magical items. I won't have much control over this, but surely something useful will come out!}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Nope, not that. Definitely not that.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Ugh... I'm losing connection! Come on!}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Phew. I think this will do!}}
:{{text|say|[[Norukk]]|Oh my!}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Let's do this, <name>! Hop on the book!}}

The [[Tome of Spellflinging]] pops out of the portal. Hop on:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|By [[Norgannon]]'s beard, this thing has a temper! Hold on!}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|There! Now, first take down those shamans holding a barrier around the ancient!}}
:''The book travels on its own a bit to the southeast, obliterating a few wayward gnolls.''

Once Kalecgos gains control of the tome, so does the player, who has access to the following abilities:
#{{Abilities|Tome Charge|Command the spelltome to charge forward, increasing its speed and sending any gnolls in its way flying into the air.|id=376439|icon=inv_relics_libramoftruth|cd=1 sec|notes=Instant}}
#{{Abilities|Arcane Blast|Fire an arcane blast at the decay gnolls.|id=376389|icon=spell_arcane_starfire|range=75|cd=2 sec|notes=Instant. Ground-targeted}}

Charge forward, obliterating gnolls by simply running over them normally, charging them (which transforms some of them into Polymorphed Sheep), or using the area of effect. Don't try to just run over the shaman, though:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Those shamans are tough! Use a charge or a blast to take them out!}}

Once the third shaman dies:
:{{text|say|Brena|The ancient is vulnerable! Quickly, throw everything we have at it!}}

The book provides a new ability:
#{{Abilities|Arcane Spirit Beam|Fire a beam of concentrated arcane energy at the Twisted Ancient.|id=376632|icon=spell_arcane_invocation|range=40|notes=Instant.}}

Use it:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|It's not enough!}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Come, my friends, my family! Help us protect our home!}}
:''The spirits of [[Kaqiata]], [[Popoak]], [[Lutokk]], [[Nomurok]], and [[Tuyuki]] appear and channel their power into the ancient, destroying it.''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Excellent! Now to the cave, before more come!}}
:''The book quickly flies to the southwest to a small, purple-crystal-filled cave.''
:{{text|say|Brena|Thank you, my friends. Rest now. [[Karkut]] awaits.}}

During development, this quest's name was '''Tome-tal Devastation'''.
