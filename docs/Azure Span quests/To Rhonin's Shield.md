==Objectives==
Meet with [[Drok Scrollstabber]] in the [[Rhonin's Shield|Tower Outlook]].
*[[Rhonin's Shield]] reached {{co|65.8|25.3|Azure Span}}
*Drake ridden from the top of the [[Azure Archives]] (Optional) {{co|38.3|61.5|Azure Span}}
*Meet with Drok Scrollstabber in Rhonin's Shield.

==Description==
[[Raszageth]] and the [[Primalists]] are launching an all out assault on [[Vakthros]]. We cannot let her succeed!

[[Khadgar]] and I will go ahead to handle the situation there from the sky.

In the meantime, make your way to the [[Rhonin's Shield]], one of the last [[Kirin Tor]] camps in the area.

You may be able to get there faster by riding that [[drake]] of yours from the top of the archives.

See that the Kirin Tor there are all right, then make your way to Vakthros.

We'll be counting on your help from the ground.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|6|72|87}}
* 2,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I saw [[Kalecgos]] and Khadgar go towards the mountains a moment ago. We're holding our own against the Primalists here, but we can always use more help!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Sindragosa (simulacrum)|Sindragosa]]|Child... you cannot show any mercy to Raszageth. She has made her choice.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I understand.}}
:{{text|say|Sindragosa|No, you do not. You have a kind soul... I know you hesitate at the thought of fighting any more of your own kind.}}
:{{text|say|Sindragosa|I... showed too much mercy, once. Twice. Many times. Before long... it was too late.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|You speak of [[Neltharion]]'s betrayal.}}
:{{text|say|Sindragosa|Do not make my mistake, young one. There can be no mercy... without justice. Remember that.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Thank you, Sindragosa. I will.}}
:{{text|say|Sindragosa|... I hope you truly do, my dear.}}

The quest waymarker points to the [[Azure Stepping Stone]] at {{co|38.3|61.5|Azure Span}} which provides a quick trip to the top of the archives. Use the altitude to make it to [[Rhonin's Shield]]. Take advantage of the new [[Whirling Surge]] ability to quickly cover ground!

At Rhonin's Shield, inside a shield bubble, a few side quests are available: [[Artifacts in the Wrong Hands]] from [[Polky Cogzapper]], and [[Riders in the Snow]] from the [[Tuskarr Elder]]. Additionally, Drok offers [[Drakes be Gone]] and [[Field Mages]] as other optional quests.
