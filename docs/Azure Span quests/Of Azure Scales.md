==Completion==
Do you enjoy poetry? Wait. If you don't, don't tell me. [[Hanu]] might hear you.

In our travels here, Hanu and I have noticed there are few [[Blue dragon|blue-scaled beasts]] outside the [[Azure Span]]!

I hypothesized some theories on the origin and nature of blue scales and jotted them down. And Hanu wrote a lovely poem about their perfect blue color! 

She is shy about her writing, so she asked me to give it to you. Please, treasure it as I treasure her.
