==Description==

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Of course, take your time. That's what you young pups do best.

==Completion==
Honestly? I thought your "help" would be the end of me.

==Notes==
Click on Old Grimtusk to remove the spear:
:{{Text|yell|Old Grimtusk|Aaaarggh! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?}}
:{{Text|say|Old Grimtusk|Did no one teach you NOT to rip a blade out of a puncture wound? I want my innards in not out!}}
:{{Text|say|Old Grimtusk|Ughh... if you really want to help, find something to start a fire.}}
:''Old Grimtusk is Bleeding.''

Find the [[Pile of Wood (Azure Span)|Piles of Wood]] around the [[Tuskarr Sledge]]. Once enough wood has been collected, click on the Campfire silhouette to place it.
:{{Text|say|Old Grimtusk|Good. Now... have you ever cauterized a wound before?}}

;Speaking with Old Grimtusk
:Is this really the best time to chat?
:{{Gossip|<Cauterize the wound as requested.>}}
:{{Gossip|<Suggest finding a healer.>}}
::Don't be so soft, <race>. I'll walk it off.
::{{Gossip|<Cauterize the wound as requested.>}}
:{{Text|say|Old Grimtusk|Ughhh. Another nasty scar for my collection.}}

If you are a healer, Old Grimtusk will have another dialogue option:
::{{Gossip|<Offer to cast a healing spell.>}}
You can then heal [[Old Grimtusk]]
:{{Text|say|Old Grimtusk|I... did not expect that.}}
