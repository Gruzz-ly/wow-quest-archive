*Defeat Gwosh in a Pet battle

==Description==
All right! Now that you used that stone on [[:Lubbins]], let's have a practice bout to test out his skills! 

There's a big ole [[Hornswog]] named Gwosh that lives on the shore to the north of here. Gwosh loves to fight! Well, play really. He's super good with other pets, too! 

It'll be a perfect playtime... I mean fight... for Lubbins.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|Ultimate Battle-Training Stone
}}

==Progress==
Gwosh is real gentle, but still fierce. I think he and  Lubbins will have a fun bout!

==Completion==
Wow! That went great! Good job Lubbins!

Don't worry about Gwosh, he's a big ol' softie. He'll be just fine.

==Progression==
{{Lovin' Lubbins}}
