'''Ice Fishing''' becomes available when you reach [[Renown]] level 10 with the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]. This quest has no rewards; it exists only to direct you to [[Tavio]], who can craft you an [[Iskaaran Ice Axe]].

==Completion==
You've surpassed all of my expectations. And yet you continue to improve! You must hunger to learn more about fishing...

Have you ever wondered what tasty morsels swim under the ice? Ice fishing takes skill, but I think you're up to the challenge.

If you bring me the right materials, I can get you started.
