==Objectives==
Collect a Savory Deviant Dealfish.
*[[Savory Deviant Dealfish]] slain
*[[Savory Deviant Dealfish (item)]]
*Return to [[Rumiastrasza]] at The [[Ruby Feast]] in [[Valdrakken]].

==Description==
Rumi and [[Chef Morsel|Morsel]]?

Gosh, that was quite a long time ago now. Eating a fish with a [[dragon]] and [[duck]] chef duo sounds like the beginning of a tale [[Elder Poa]] might tell for the younglings. We'd be hard-pressed to forget such a happening!

The fish was a Savory Deviant Dealfish, a top [[Tuskarr]] favorite! They're rare, but found just off the coast here.

Fair warning - it's azuretooth mating season. Those bloodthirsty fiends will take a chunk out of you for messing with their favorite snack.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
*5x [[Captain's Caramelized Catfish]]
*[[Venrik's Goat Milk]]
*5x [[Mantis Shrimp Cocktail]]

==Progress==
Morsel is an incredible angler. He does not even require a fishing rod!

==Completion==
Oooh hoo! You smell that? Nothing fresher than fresh-caught right from the sea!

Morsel and I simply must spend another summer with the [[Iskaara Tuskarr|Iskarra]]{{sic}}. There is simply no better way to learn more about an ingredient than with the artisans that source them.

==Notes==
Interact with the Savory Deviant Dealfish and [[Hungering Azuretooth]] appears. Kill it and loot the item.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|[[Chef Coldgale]]|This is a truly beautiful fish! The flesh is so tender. Were these native to the [[Stormsong Coast]], I'm not sure there'd be many left for the following season.}}
:{{Text|say|Rumiastrasza|That is the true power of the Iskaara. They live harmoniously with their natural resources instead of draining them for all the sustenance and profit they are worth.}}
:{{Text|say|Chef Coldgale|I appreciate what you're saying. I'll carry that wisdom back with me, Chef.}}

==Progression==
