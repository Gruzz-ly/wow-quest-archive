==Objectives==
Witness [[Kalecgos]] reclaim the Azure Oathstone.
*[[Azure Oathstone|Oathstone]] reclaimed {{co|39.4|63.2|Azure Span}}

==Description==
Fine work, friend. It seems we've managed to repair the [[leyline]]s within the [[Azure Archives]].

Back when the [[blue dragonflight]] was united, I would tell my brothers and sisters to never doubt the strength of mortals.

Meet me at the oathstone to the south of here. I will reclaim it, and then be on my way to [[Thaldraszus]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|69|15}}
* 1,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is good to be back... or reactivated, as it were. 

There is much to do, and I am glad to give whatever aid I can.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Don't be alarmed, but my mirror images should vanish in a mo--}}

Nothing appears to happen, so manually dive down to the ground to find the actual Kalecgos standing in front of the Oathstone. Speak with him:
:It's good to see you in the flesh, <name>.

:You've been a great help so far. I would appreciate your presence while I reclaim the Azure Oathstone.

:{{gossip|I'm ready to see you reclaim the Azure Oathstone.}}

An [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays out:

:{{text|say|Sindragosa|I was expecting Malygos. Where is he? And who are you?}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Kalecgos... And you--you cannot possibly be...}}
:{{text|say|Sindragosa|Sindragosa? In a way. A simulacrum, created by her in order to preserve her memories and knowledge.}}
:{{text|say|Sindragosa|It would seem a great deal of time has passed since she left.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Yes. And much has happened.}}
:{{text|say|Sindragosa|I sense an Aspect.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|It's a long story. Both you and Malygos... are gone.}}
:{{text|say|Sindragosa|I see. And the rest of our flight? Where are they?}}
:{{text|say|Sindragosa|...tell me.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|After Neltharion betrayed us, we were on the verge of extinction.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|We few who remain are scattered. Aimless and... alone.}}
:{{text|say|Sindragosa|Yet you came here. That tells me you still have hope for our kin.}}
:{{text|say|Sindragosa|Child of my flight, shall we work together to make that hope a reality?}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Nothing would give me more pleasure.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|What must we do?}}
