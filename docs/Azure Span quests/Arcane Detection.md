==Objectives==
Investigate [[tuskarr]] objects in [[Khuri's Fishing Spot]] for signs of [[arcane]] [[magic]].
*[[Unassuming Flask|Unassuming flask]] examined
*[[Dusty Teapot|Dusty teapot]] examined
*[[Toolk's Toy Boat]]

==Description==
Greetings! I am [[Miva Star-Eye]], and I am conducting arcane investigations in this area.

The [[Azure Span]] has magic all around it. Some of it is benign... while some can be quite dangerous.

I've been tasked with ensuring no arcane energies reside in anything the tuskarr possess.

We already had one incident in [[Camp Antonidas]] of a fishing box spontaneously combusting!

Can you take my detector and examine a few objects here? I need to continue speaking with [[Julk]] over here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Let's hope there's nothing out of the ordinary here.

==Completion==
A toy boat that's a magical time bomb?

Oh boy.
