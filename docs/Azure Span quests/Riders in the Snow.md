==Objectives==
Find the missing [[tuskarr]] [[hunter]]s in the [[Azure Span]].

==Description==
Greetings, <class>. This [[magic]]al dome is truly astonishing, is it not? But even though it protects us from the biting cold and the wilderness, we cannot count on the [[Kirin Tor]] forever.

A few days ago, some of our most seasoned hunters ventured into the forests looking for food and supplies, but they never came back. Even though I know their leader, [[Old Grimtusk]], is a seasoned hiker and hunter, it is very hard not to worry about him and his hunting party.

Can you find them for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|6|72|87}}
* 1,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<This tuskarr lies unconscious on the snow with a wooden spear protruding from his side>
