{{questportrait|Frostjaw.jpg|Frostjaw|A legendary portent of death on the ice.}}
Hunt down [[Frostjaw]] north of [[Winterpelt Hollow]].
*[[Frostjaw's Jaw]]
*Speak to [[Hemet Nesingwary Jr.]] in [[Camp Nowhere]].

==Description==
Tell me, friend. Have you ever seen the face of death?

<Nesingwary pauses for dramatic effect.>

What am I saying? Of course you have.

Death, after all, has many faces.

I've heard tell from the [[Imbu]] tuskarr that one of its faces lives up in these hills. To even say its name is to invite a violent, frigid death:

Frostjaw.

<Nesingwary looks around warily.>

Well, now you have to hunt it--for my sake at least!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|53|82|96}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +400 [[reputation]] with the [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Don't dawdle about. I'm in mortal danger now!

==Completion==
You're alive!

Ha ha! I can't imagine what kind of fight that beastie put up when you cornered him. Azure Span's a little safer thanks to you!

Do me a favor and check on my da...
