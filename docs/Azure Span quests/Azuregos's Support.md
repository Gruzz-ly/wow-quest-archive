==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Nexus]] in [[Northrend]] to meet [[Azuregos]].
*Azuregos found within the Nexus in Northrend

==Description==
Many [[blue dragon]]s have returned, and many others have informed me of their plans to make their ways to [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]].

There are a few key members of [[Blue dragonflight|the flight]], however, that I have not heard from. One of them may be able to help: Azuregos, stationed within the Nexus in Northrend.

You, myself, and [[Sindragosa (simulacrum)|Sindragosa]] will travel to meet Azuregos. He has ignored all of my attempts to contact him from afar.

Thanks to [[Azure Oathstone|the oathstone]] being empowered, Sindragosa can now travel further than ever before.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 5,950 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Completion==
Perhaps [[Kalecgos]]'s timing is not as bad as I thought... especially if he has the simulacrum of Lady Sindragosa with him.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|I am quite curious to meet this Azuregos after all you have told me about him.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|He would have been a boon had he answered our original call for aid.}}
:''Kalec opens a [[Portal to the Nexus (Azure Span)|Portal to the Nexus]] and enters it.''

On the other side of the portal, defeated [[Memory of a Torturer|Memories of a Torturer]], [[Memory of a Caster|Memories of a Caster]], and [[Memory of an Attacker|Memories of an Attacker]] are all over the place.
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|This is all your fault, isn't it Kalecgos? It's absolute chaos here, and you just happen to show up to make things worse.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|Azuregos. You shall cease this behavior at once, show respect to your Aspect, and inform us of the situation you find yourself in.}}
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|Lady Sindragosa...?}}
