==Objectives==
Help Ruriq build [[The Fallstrider]].
*[[Ruriq]] helped

==Description==
Have you heard the tale of the Gleamfisher? She built a boat strong enough to pass down waterfalls!

[[Elder Nava]] loves to tell the story.

I think the noble spirits of the On'tuq [[mammoth]]s would be honored if we used their remains to craft such a boat again.

My brother says no. But if we succeed, we can help bring fish to our struggling sister [[tribe]]s.

You've proven your skill and passion! Together, I'm sure we can build something great.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
This will be finest boat [[Kauriq tribe|our tribe]] has seen in generations!

==Completion==
Ruriq is as stubborn as ever.
