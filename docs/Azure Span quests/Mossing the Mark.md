==Objectives==
Collect 5 Drakmoss Clumps.
*[[Drakmoss Clump]] (5)

==Description==
Poor girl...

She must have gotten sick after eating something tainted.

Luckily, my grandfather was a [[druid]] and taught me how to treat [[arcane]]-based illnesses.

I don't have all the components on me, but we can make do with what's around.

First, I will need some drakmoss. It is a rare lichen that only grows on [[dragon]] bones.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*9,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered the moss?

==Completion==
Oh! Thank you so much, <name>!

I may be a mage, but sometimes natural solutions are the most effective.

;Description
The [[Ley Crystal]] in the area seems to have made this poor [[slyvern]] sick... Luckily, my great grandfather was a renowned druid and passed down a remedy that is sure to offer some relief to this darling. For the first ingredient, I will need some drakmoss. Some should be growing on that [[skeleton]] down the hill.
