'''On New Wings''' concludes the "A Single Wing" storyline of the [[Fury Incarnate campaign]] added in [[patch 10.1.7]].

==Objectives==
Talk to [[Emberthal]] in [[Valdrakken]].

==Description==
I am glad that [[Winglord Dezran]] arrived when he did. If he had not, this would have gone... very differently.

We must take [[Marithos]] back to Valdrakken so he can recuperate, but once I have debriefed Dezran, we will send an envoy to help re-introduce them to our people.

They have suffered. We have suffered. Perhaps now we can all heal.

Follow me back to Valdrakken. We have much to discuss.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
Thank you for your help, <name>. Now that Dezran has returned, we can work to finally bring the [[dracthyr]] together.

==Notes==
No quest shortcut back to [[Valdrakken]], so get there the hard way.

On complete:
:{{text|say|[[Amythora]]|Winglord! It is good to have you back. After we left you in the [[titan]] vault...}}
:{{text|say|Winglord Dezran|I am proud to see how you have grown since I last saw you both. But now, go. Get some rest. Emberthal and I must talk.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|You were a good leader, Dezran. Amythora and Marithos idolize you. When you left, it took some coaxing for them to follow me.}}
:{{text|say|Winglord Dezran|I don't deserve their loyalty. I believed [[Sarkareth]]'s rhetoric. I didn't recognize what he stood for.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|[[Nozdormu|A wise dragon]] once [[Legacies|showed me]] that my future--and his--was not in the past. It was in my people.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|We have a chance now to finally unite the dracthyr. Will you help me?}}
:{{text|say|Winglord Dezran|Help you? It sounds like you're more likely to help me.}}

;Dezran's gossip
{{Dialogue|
I have much to think about.

;Emberthal's gossip

I've lost enough soldiers. I'm not losing another.
