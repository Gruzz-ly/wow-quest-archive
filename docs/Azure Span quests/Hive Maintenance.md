At Winterpelt language skill 25, [[Sonova Snowden]] offers this quest and [[Honeyfreeze Mead]]. 

==Objectives==
Bring pollen to the Honeyfreeze [[bee]]s.
* Pollen Delivered (8) {{co|62|18|Azure Span}}

==Description==
[[File:Blooming Frostshell.jpg|thumb|Blooming Frostshell]]

It wouldn't do tae steal a hive's honey without ensurin' they have enough food tae make it through the cold. Especially if we might want more down the line.

Frostbell pollen's sticky stuff an' a wee bit fragile. But if ye run through some of the bloomin' plants, it'll be on ye like fleas on a [[kobold]].

Then, all ye have to do is bring it back tae a bee afore it blows away--they'll lick it right off ye! Tickles a bit too!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It's a rough life out there for a wee bee.

==Completion==
[[File:Honeyfreeze Pollinator.jpg|thumb|Honeyfreeze Pollinator]]
That ought tae keep 'em goin' for a while.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests before heading out.

Southwest of [[Theron's Watch]] and the [[Misty Canyon Overlook]] is an area of the [[Upper Frostlands]] that is not covered in snow, occupied by [[Frostsap Ancient]]s and friendly [[Honeyfreeze Pollinator]]s. Run through [[Blooming Frostshell]] plants to pick up a ten-second buff:
:{{Abilities|Pollen Power!|Coated in delicious, energizing pollen, increasing movement speed by 25%.|id=399327|icon=inv_misc_dust_01|notes=10 sec buff}}

Run the pollen through pollinators and neutral [[Honeyfreeze Buzzer]]s before the buff wears off.

[[Honeyfreeze Honeycomb]]s are on the large fallen tree in the area. Looting the honeycombs will turn the buzzers hostile!

While in the area, Saza is also wandering around:
:{{text|say|Saza|[Furbolg] I saw you in the village before. Some of the others are unsure of you. But you seem friendly to me.}}
:{{text|say|Saza|[Furbolg] Are you here to see the bees too?}}
:{{text|say|Saza|[Furbolg] The best honey is at the wide part of the log, friend!}}
:{{text|say|Saza|[Furbolg] I try to be just like the bees--always busy.}}
:{{text|say|Saza|[Furbolg] Will I see you in the village? I'd like that.}}
