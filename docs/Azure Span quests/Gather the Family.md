==Objectives==
Collect 4 Funeral Offerings from around [[Iskaara]], then place them in the funeral boat.
*Funeral Offerings collected (4)
*Offerings placed in the boat {{co|13.1|48.6|Azure Span}}

==Description==
Your friend [[Kalecgos]] wishes to speak of [[ley lines]], but preparations must be made for the funeral.

While I meet with him, could you gather the final offerings from around [[Iskaara]] and place them in the funeral boat alongside dear old [[Ponoliak]]?

I hope you take a moment to enjoy the town, as well! My people will welcome you warmly, especially after your help in [[Brackenhide Hollow|Brackenhide]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*9,800 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Did you get yourself a bowl of soup?

==Completion==
Your friend is very inquisitive! Does he ever take a moment to relax?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Thank you for taking this time, Brena.}}
:''Kalecgos walks in and takes a seat to the left of Brena.''
:{{text|say|Brena|It is an honor. Let's have a look at these maps. [[Tuukanit]], could you please ensure our guest gets a bowl of soup?}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Oh, that's all right, thank you.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Nonsense, look how you thin you are! Some eel gut soup will get some much needed blubber on those bones!}}
:''Tuukanit walks out, presumably in search of soup.''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|S-some what?}}

Outside, numerous side quests open up, including [[Orientation: Iskaara]] from [[Murik]], [[WANTED: Krojek the Shoreprowler]] from [[Bukarakikk]], [[Scampering Scamps]] from [[Hanu]], a fishing quest from [[Lukoturukk]], and inside the inn, [[Stolen Tuskarr Totems]] from [[Elder Poa]], and [[The Weave of a Tale]] from [[Elder Nappa]].

For this quest, loot four objects marked on the minimap:

The [[Stone Sculpture]] is to the southwest inside the [[Filled Bowl]] at {{co|12.5|49.5|Azure Span}} near Elders [[Elder Nappa|Nappa]], the innkeeper, and [[Elder Poa|Poa]], the weaver of tales:
:{{text|say|Elder Poa|As the tales go, if Old Ponoliak's spirit returns to us restless, we will carve a stone statue for it to rest within.}}

The [[Ornamented Shield]] is further southwest at {{co|12.5|50.3|Azure Span}} near the dock:
:{{text|say|[[Iskaara Defender]]|Chief Ponoliak was a great fighter. He once took a blow from a charging bruffalon for me. That would have killed a lesser man.}}

The [[Decorated Teapot]] is to the northeast at {{co|13.5|48.6|Azure Span}} next to [[Big Kinook]], the Master of Soups:
:{{text|say|Big Kinook|That's ol' Pono's favorite tea. Hopefully he shares some with [[Karkut]] on the journey.}}

The [[Handcrafted Boat]] is to the southeast at {{co|13.9|49.5|Azure Span}} next to [[Jinkutuk]], the Herbalism trainer:
:{{text|say|Jinkutuk|Chieftain Ponoliak carved that for my son, [[Nomurok]]. My son fell in Brackenhide, so... it seems only right this should return to the sea with its maker.}}

Some Iskaara Fishers and [[Arvik]], in charge of repairs, are working on the [[Funeral Boat]] in the center of town. Interact with it to place the offerings:
:{{text|say|Arvik|Thank you, traveler. We should be just about done here. Could you tell Brena?}}

On return to Brena, Kalecgos is dutifully eating his bowl of soup... with slurping sound effects.
