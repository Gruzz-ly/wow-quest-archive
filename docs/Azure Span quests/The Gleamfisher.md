==Objectives==
Retrieve 3 Gleamfish and place them in the offering basket.
*[[Gleamfish (item)]] (3)
*Gleamfish placed in [[Offering Basket (Azure Span)|basket]]

==Description==
I am sorry you have been dragged into this, traveler.

[[Ruriq|My brother]] tends to get... carried away. This is only the latest of his follies. But this one might get him killed.

He won't listen to me. He probably won't listen to you, either.

Our ancestor, [[Kauriq the Gleamfisher]], though, is the center of his fixation. She may be able to.

Please catch some [[Gleamfish]] and bring them here. I shall use them to help us commune with her spirit, which lingers in [[Tuskarr Stone Table|this stone]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Not all my ideas have worked out, but that doesn't mean this one won't!

==Completion==
Did you hear all that, hero?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Ruriq|Brother, not all of my ideas are terrible.}}
:{{Text|say|Kauj|They are when they place [[Kauriq tribe|our tribe]] in danger. Ruriq, you have children to care for!}}
:{{Text|say|Ruriq|My children are healthy and happy. Our tribe is thriving! We should share our good fortune!}}

Find the fish in the nets nearby (those in the water cannot be collected) and return to the table.

:''Magic erupts from the fish and the spirit of the Gleamfisher appears.''
:{{Text|say|Kauj|Gleamfisher, please, counsel my brother Ruriq against his foolish idea.}}
:{{Text|say|Kauriq the Gleamfisher|Aho? What a [[The Fallstrider|fine boat]]! Such thick hides and a sturdy frame!}}
:{{Text|say|Ruriq|Thank you, Gleamfisher! I mean to follow in your footsteps-}}
:{{Text|say|Kauj|-And both waste our resources and get himself killed! Please, Gleamfisher, talk sense into him.}}
:{{Text|say|Kauriq the Gleamfisher|Hmmm... The trouble I am sensing here is not in your idea, Ruriq. It is a noble one.}}
:{{Text|say|Kauriq the Gleamfisher|My journey ended in death because I built my boat alone. But if all three of you do it, you may just succeed where I failed!}}
:{{Text|say|Kauriq the Gleamfisher|You will need the blessings of the Spirits of Wind and Water, as well. My children's children, you will need to work together to prove yourselves to them. I am certain you can do it.}}
:''The Gleamfisher disappears.''
