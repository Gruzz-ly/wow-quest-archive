==Objectives==
Use the [[Arcane Blaster]] to help [[Khadgar]] defeat the primalists.
*[[Primalist]] army repelled

==Description==
I've assembled the pieces of the device you recovered.

Place it near Khadgar and use it to repel the Primalists! 

We just need to hold out a little longer until [[Kalecgos]] arrives.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You receive one of these rewards:
|Windswept Vestments
|Twisted Leather Vest
|Bramble Chain Hauberk
|Sleet Shined Chestplate
}}

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|53|82|96}}
*12,250 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*+100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Just hold out a little longer...

==Completion==
I am relieved that the attack was repelled... but it seems we will need to figure out a plan to help Kalecgos in the [[Azure Archives]].

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Noriko the All-Remembering|We just need to hold them off a little longer. Kalecgos should be here soon!}}

;Mounting the Arcane Blaster
:{{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I'll shield you for as long as I can... take [[Proto-Drake (Azure Span)|those drakes]] down!}}

The blaster has two abilities:
#Arcane Blast
#Arcame Stasis

All drakes need to be killed. Don't leave the Arcane Blaster until the quest objective is marked as complete, or else any progress will be lost.

:{{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Fine work. Hold though... more Primalists are coming!}}
:{{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Fall back! We'll set up defensive positions--}}
:''More drakes, now with [[Fire Elemental (Azure Span)|Fire Elementals]], approach.''
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|The Kirin Tor shall not fall to these monsters!}}
:''From behind, Kalecgos flies in and freezes the enemies.''
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|I must return to the archives. Send help when you can... the Azure Oathstone is proving difficult to reclaim.}}
:{{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I need to fend off the Primalists to the east. It may fall on you to aid Kalecgos, adventurer.}}
:''Khadgar returns to his original spot, and so do all the NPCs. [[Kirin Tor Mage (Azure Span)|Kirin Tor Mage]]s now stand with Noriko and Khadgar.''
