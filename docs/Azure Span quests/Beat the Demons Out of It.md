==Description==
He can be very stubborn, I'm afraid.

But I can't just give up on him. We'll just have to try again!

There are more paintings still out there he threw out. These were in even more dangerous locations, so I hope you are up for the challenge!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
What now?

==Completion==
Again? Why must you keep bringing me these crimes against art?

==Notes==
The quest items drop from the final bosses in the dungeons.

:{{Text|say|Hudson|It's been... ever since I met her... that I stopped wanting to paint. All I want is to spend time with her.}}
:{{Text|say|Hudson|Is that what is stopping me? Has my love for Ran replaced my love for art?}}
