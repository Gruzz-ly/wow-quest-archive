'''Glowing Arcane Jewel''' starts from the [[Glowing Arcane Jewel]] that drops from the [[Stranded Soul]] at {{co|76.3|23.3|Azure Span}} inside an ice cave north of [[Vakthros]] in the [[Azure Span]]. To open the cave, defeat the [[Lost Elemental]] at {{co|75.6|24.6|Azure Span}} just outside the cave to spawn four fire orbs. Four players must interact with the orbs at the same time to open the cave and gain access to the Stranded Soul. Loot the soul for this item, which starts this quest.

==Objectives==
Bring the Glowing Arcane Jewel to [[Noriko the All-Remembering|Noriko the All Knowing]]{{sic}} in [[Camp Antonidas]].

==Description==
<This jewel seems to be quite powerful. There is an eerie glow to it.

Perhaps it's best to deliver it to the [[Kirin Tor]] for it to be placed in a safe spot.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor]]
* [[Highland Drake: Spined Nose]]
* [[Highland Drake: Scaled Pattern]]

==Completion==
Look at this jewel! I'll make sure it gets to [[Dalaran]] immediately for study. 

Here, take this for your efforts. We recently uncovered it from another excavation.

==Patch changes==
