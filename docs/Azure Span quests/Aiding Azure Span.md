Return to [[Noriko the All-Remembering]] in [[Camp Antonidas]].
*Speak to [[Arc Tel XVII|Flightmaster]] {{co|37.1|60.8|Azure Span}}
*Speak with Noriko the All-Remembering within Camp Antonidas.

==Description==
The [[Azure Oathstone|oathstone]]'s energy cannot be reclaimed until the [[ley lines]] within the [[Azure Span]] are repaired.

Some ley lines may only be reachable by those of [[Kalecgos]]'s skills... but you may still be of aid.

If they still yet survive, seek out the [[tuskarr]]. They lived here in my times and have a deep knowledge of the land.

Speak with one of our [[arcane]] aids to return to your allies.

You will receive:
* [[Water-Ordained Signet]]
* {{cost|13|45|74}}
* 4,900 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +50 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
What can I do for you?

==Completion==
The tuskarr? There are a number of tuskarr merchants and travellers who pass through here.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|I'll do what I can to repair any ley lines I find, and send my mirror images to keep an eye on things while I'm gone.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|Good luck to the two of you. If the tuskarr still live, they should know the location of the major ley lines.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|Child... You are staring at me instead of departing. Do you have more to say?}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|I apologize. I have heard many legends of you... my mind is swimming with questions to ask.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|As is mine. Ten thousand years is an incalculable amount of time to miss.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|My dear, I would ask you to apprise me of what I've missed once this mess is settled.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Of course! There's so much to tell... the [[Cataclysm]], the [[Scourge]]... the [[Dragon Aspects|other Aspects]]... the [[Nexus Wars]]...}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|Child of my flight.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Ah! Right... I shall return with hopeful news.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|And I shall aid you in becoming the proper Aspect of the [[blue dragonflight]].}}
