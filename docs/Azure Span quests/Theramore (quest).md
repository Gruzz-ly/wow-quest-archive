==Objectives==
Speak to [[Kalecgos]] about [[Surigosa]]'s last known location.

==Description==
According to [[Azuregos]]'s notes, the [[blue dragon]] Surigosa was last seen investigating a sect of [[Hedge wizard|rogue mages]] known as the [[Sullied Banner]]. 

Surigosa's last missive stated that she intended to travel to the [[ruins of Theramore]]. Perhaps she uncovered traces of the Sullied Banner there. Either way, if Surigosa is to be found, Theramore seems the best place to search for her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Theramore? I would rather not return to that place... but if Surigosa is there, then perhaps there is work to be done.

==Progression==
{{The Veiled Ossuary}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.1.0|note=Added.}}
