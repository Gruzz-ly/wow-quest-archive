'''Ice Cave Ya Got There''' concludes the "Winterpelt Hollow" chapter of the [[Azure Span storyline]].

==Objectives==
Investigate the cave.
*Investigate the cave in [[Winterpelt Hollow]] {{co|66.2|11.1|Azure Span}}
*[[Stormshackler Rynea]] slain {{co|66.0|10.7|Azure Span}}

==Description==
Well, your accent is atrocious and ten-thousand years of isolation and linguistic drift hasn't done us any favors, but I think I got a rough impression at least.

The common thread in what they were trying to say was somethin' aboot a "bad cave wind" or an "evil storm cave." That, or their laundry was too Thursday?

Look, this isn't like learnin' [[Gnomish (language)|Gnomish]]; there're going to be some hiccups. I'm pretty sure on the cave thing though, so let's start there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Winterpelt Furbolg]]
* [[Frozen Shard Ring]]
* [[Windborne Velocidrake: Finned Neck]]

==Progress==
That's the best I got. Ye try translatin' this stuff if ye don't like it.

==Completion==
I told ye I had the cave part right. Now we can see about establishin' some proper diplomatic relations.

==Notes==
Head to the north end of the frozen river -- there's a mouth to a small cave there. Inside, [[Stormshackler Rynea]] has a bunch of [[Winterpelt Prisoner]]s in check. 
:{{text|say|Stormshackler Rynea|Ah, I see we have a visitor. Do come in.}}
:{{text|say|Stormshackler Rynea|Would you care to see how close the Winterpelt are to throwing off the yoke of the [[Titan]]s? They may have turned their backs on their true heritage and spurned our offer of friendship, but the truth cannot be denied!}}
:{{text|yell|Stormshackler Rynea|Feel the elements burn in your veins! Rage against your absent masters and their lapdog [[Dragon Aspects|Aspects]]! Tear down all they have built!}}

She transforms two of the prisoners, turning them into some kind of... half-furbolg half-stone elemental abomination? Defeat them:
:{{text|say|Stormshackler Rynea|It seems that even with all the gifts I could give them, these [[furbolg]] are not up to the task. A pity.}}
:{{text|say|Stormshackler Rynea|I shall have to redouble my efforts once I dispose of you!}}

Rynea loses her shield. Take her out:
:{{text|say|Stormshackler Rynea|Azeroth will... be... free...}}
:{{text|emote|The furbolg speaks in its growling tongue, looking between you and the fallen Primalist. While its words sound harsh and unwelcoming, it makes no move to attack.}}

[[Kranac Sagesnow]], the Winterpelt Chieftain, has some gossip here:
:<The furbolg growls something unintelligible, gesturing to the exit.>

Outside, the furbolg are merely unfriendly instead of hostile and cannot be attacked.

This is the "Winterpelt Hollow" criterion of [[Sojourner of Azure Span]]. The next breadcrumb quest, [[Academic Acquaintances]], will be offered if players have not already completed [[What of the Winterpelt Clan?]], from the "Rustpine Den" chapter of the [[Azure Span storyline]].

Either way, these two chapters conclude the [[Winterpelt Furbolg]] storyline in patch 10.0.
