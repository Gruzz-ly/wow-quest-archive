==Objectives==
Collect fish to restock the fishing hole and throw it into an Ice Hole.
*Collect Stock Fish (3)
*Drop the fish into an Ice Hole (3)
*[[Throw Net]] (provided)

==Description==
The fish could be biting better, don't you think?

You know, that gives me an idea. Seems we have caught almost all the fish under the ice. Could you catch some more from the [[Timbertooth Trail]] downstream, bring it here, and drop it into an ice hole?

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Restock Fish|id=386887|Increases the remaining stock of fish by 20.|icon=achievement_profession_fishing_findfish}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Have you dropped those fish yet?

==Completion==
Good work, I can already see more fish flickering under the ice.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
