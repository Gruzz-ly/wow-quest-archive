==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Edavix.jpg|Edavix|A guardian corrupted by the power of Valthrux. It holds the secrets to finding the artifact's location.}}
Recover the Whispered Shard from [[Edavix]], the Corrupted Guardian.
*[[Whispering Shard]]

==Description==
I appreciate your aid, <class>. I was the [[Kirin Tor]] [[mage]] who first discovered this artifact, [[Valthrux]], and the [[Sundered Flame]]'s plans.

The retrieval and study of this supposedly sentient and powerful artifact is of the utmost importance, and mark my word, I shall be the one to do it.

The Sundered Flame guess at its location, but I've used my [[magic]] to find a path for us.

There is a corrupted guardian nearby that holds a magic shard connected to Valthrux. I can use it to find the rest of the artifact.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|27|62}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
*+100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Did you find the shard?

==Completion==
Give it to me! Quickly now!

Did you hear the whispers too?

==Notes==

:{{text|say|[[To'tik]]|There may not be enough of us to contend with the Sundered Flame. We should pull back and get more help.}}
:{{text|say|Alia Sunsoar|The Sundered Flame will be of no consequence if I can wield Valthrux against them. We should focus on acquiring it.}}
:{{text|say|[[Kattigat]]|We can't leave now, To'tik. We have to do this to protect our families from the Sundered Flame and this artifact.}}
