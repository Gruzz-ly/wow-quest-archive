==Objectives==
Stop the [[Sundered Flame]] within the Azure Vaults.
*Disturbance thwarted within the [[Azure Vault]]s

==Description==
;Sindragosa
We have a problem, <name>.

Beneath the [[Azure Archives]] rests the Azure Vault. In my life, I stored many important and dangerous [[magic]]al curiosities in it.

A large group of Sundered Flame have broken into the vault, convinced it holds some kind of secrets.

Please, you must go in there and stop this brazen assault before they unleash dangers they do not comprehend.

These [[Thief|thieves]] know not what lies within.

;Kalecgos
There's a problem in the Azure Vault, <name>.

==Progress==
;Sindragosa
Do be careful within the vaults.

;Kalecgos
Take care within the vaults.

==Completion==
;Sindragosa
Ten thousand years of delaying what I feared in my heart would be the inevitable end for [[Umbrelskul|my child]].

[[Malygos]] and I hoped one day we would find a cure. Though that day never came, I would not change any of our actions.

We must always strive for hope, even if it seems nonexistent.

I take comfort in knowing at least my child is now reunited with the true [[Sindragosa]] and Malygos.

Now go.

;Kalecgos
Thank you for your help within the vaults, <name>.
