==Objectives==
Look through the Bag of Helpful Goods for the Arcane Stepping Stone, then use at an [[arcane]] focus point to reach the top of the [[Azure Archives]].
*[[Arcane Stepping Stone]]
*Azure Archives apex reached
*Meet [[Kalecgos]] at the top of the Azure Archives.
*[[Bag of Helpful Goods]] (provided)

==Description==
There appears to be something sapping the arcane energies at the apex of the tower.

Now that you've stabilized the energies down here, you should be able to "ride" the arcane magics in the area.

Look in that bag of yours for something called an arcane stepping stone, and use it to meet me at the top.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|69|15}}
*1,250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It's a long way down from here. Be careful.

==Completion==
It's a bit worse up here than I had anticipated!

==Notes==
Head to the arcane fields from the previous quest. The elementals are now neutral and won't attack on their own.

While standing in the rune, use the [[Bag of Helpful Goods]] to find the [[Arcane Stepping Stone]], then use the same-named extra action button to get launched to the top layer of the oculus with an Arcane Missile<!-- ID: 192731 -->.

==Progression==
{{Into the Archives}}
