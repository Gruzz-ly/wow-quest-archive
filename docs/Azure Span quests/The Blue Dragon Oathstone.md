'''The Blue Dragon Oathstone''' concludes the "Vakthros" chapter of the [[Azure Span storyline]], and of the zone storyline itself. The [[Thaldraszus storyline]] begins with [[To Valdrakken]], from [[Kalecgos]].

==Objectives==
Accompany [[Kalecgos]] to claim the [[Azure Oathstone|Blue Dragon Oathstone]].
*Ceremony witnessed

==Description==
The [[Azure Span]] has stabilized for now and more [[blue dragon]]s have arrived... just in time.

It's time to return to the [[Azure Archives]] and reclaim the oathstone.

I would request your presence there, <name>. You've been a great boon throughout this ordeal.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Windswept Mantle
|Twisted Leather Spaulders
|Bramble Chain Pauldrons
|Sleet Shined Shoulderguards
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +150 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
I'm quite relieved you all prevented the complete annihilation of the Azure Span.

Shall we continue?

==Completion==
The Oathstone is empowered once more. There is much to do... but the Azure Span is at least returning to what it once was.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Please, return to the Azure Archives. Sindragosa is awaiting our return--and we should be able to reclaim the oathstone.}}
:{{text|say|Senegos|Sindragosa? She has returned from the grave?}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I'll explain on the way. Let's go!}}
:{{text|say|Senegos|And I thought I had seen it all in my old age...}}
:''The collected party shift into their dragon forms and fly back to the archives.''

Use the [[Winds of the Isles]] directly in front for a free altitude boost to help get back!

Speak with [[Sindragosa]] to witness the ceremony, which starts an [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]]:
:Shall we begin?

:{{Gossip|I'm ready to see the oathstone be reclaimed.}}

{{#ev:youtube|iiwPfEqJV0Y}}
:{{text|say|Sindragosa|Tell me... what have you learned, child of my flight? What is your oath?}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|We've been scattered for far too long. Isolated.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|But a [[dragonflight]] is more than an oath we make--we are a family.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|And it's time I brought my family home.}}
:{{text|say|Sindragosa|I do believe you are ready, Kalecgos.}}

Completing this quest also awards the "Vakthros" criterion and completes the [[Azure Spanner]] achievement.
