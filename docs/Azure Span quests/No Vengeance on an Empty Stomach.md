==Objectives==
Fish 3 Frozen Tail Darters within Grimtusk's Hideaway.
*[[Fishing]] skill learned from [[Young Quickhands]]
*[[Frozen Tail Darter]] (3)

==Description==
Now that we've gotten back to what we aimed to do, we need to have a talk tusk to tusk. That the [[gnoll]] [[Frostbite (gnoll)|Frostbite]]? The one you spoke to?

We've got a history with him.

This may take awhile to explain. You go and get some [[fish]] while I talk, pup. We need to feed everyone. They need their strength for what's next.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It's hard work fishing out here. That's the point.

==Completion==
Now you know what's at stake.

Time to get moving.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Old Grimtusk|This wasn't the first time we crossed spears with the gnolls here--or Frostbite.}}
:{{Text|say|Old Grimtusk|If he's back in power, that's bad news. That old mongrel is the smartest gnoll I've ever seen. Meanest too. A bad combination.}}
:{{Text|say|Old Grimtusk|When we came out here to settle more land, I was completely straight with my new hunting band. This is not so much settlement as re-settlement.}}
:{{Text|say|Old Grimtusk|We had a fishing hole and camp here, and Frostbite ransacked it. Killed a bunch of my old--good hunters, good friends. Spooked them bad.}}
:{{Text|say|Old Grimtusk|But I'd say it's time to get unspooked, round up the old gang, and grow some spines. Frostbite needs to be taken down for the safety all [[tuskarr]]s.}}

If you haven't learned Fishing, do so with Young Quickhands. Otherwise, go ahead and fish in the small pool in front of Grimtusk.
