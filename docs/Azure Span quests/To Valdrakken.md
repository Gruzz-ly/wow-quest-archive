'''To Valdrakken''' begins the [[Thaldraszus storyline]] for players who have completed the [[Azure Span storyline]].

==Objectives==
Travel to [[Valdrakken]] and meet with [[Alexstrasza|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder]].
*Make your way to Valdrakken
*Access teleporter to [[Seat of the Aspects]] {{co|61.9|32.3|Valdrakken}} (Optional)

==Description==
Thanks to you, we narrowly avoided a complete catastrophe.

However, we should convene with the other [[Dragon Aspects|Aspects]] and share word of what happened here.

Please meet me at the Seat of the Aspects within Valdrakken. I'm sure the others will have insight into what [[Raszageth]] and her [[Primalists]] are attempting.

There is a crossing into Thaldraszus north and a bit east of here. The flight is scenic, but do not take too long getting there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Welcome to Valdrakken, <name>. Kalecgos says there is news about the Azure Span.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I depart for Valdrakken shortly, hero. Don't wait for me, I'll be there when you arrive.}}

Consider using the [[Arcane Stepping Stone]] at {{co|38.3|61.5|Azure Span}} for a quick trip to the top of the archives for some bonus altitude. The crossing referred to in the description is west of [[Theron's Watch]] at roughly {{co|56.4|15.6|Azure Span}}, which also has a flight path should players not wish to dragonride manually.

At the [[Seat of the Aspects]], the adventurer interrupts a conversation:
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|These are alarming tidings that you bring us... ah, here is our champion.}}

==Progression==
{{Valdrakken, City of Dragons}}
