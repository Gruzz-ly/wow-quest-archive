==Objectives==
Look for Wingfoil herbs in the [[Lonely Falls]].
*[[Wingfoil]] (6)
*Heal Marithos (Optional)

==Description==
What was done to [[Marithos]] goes beyond what simple healing can fix. If we expect him to fly out of here, he will need extra care.

Thankfully, there are herbs nearby that may give his healing a boost--enough to get him standing, anyway.

Look around and collect some of the Wingfoil nearby, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Have you found that Wingfoil? Marithos cannot fly without it.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Now let's hope for the best...

==Progression==
{{A Single Wing}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.1.7|note=Added.}}
