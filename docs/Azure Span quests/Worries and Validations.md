==Objectives==
Find clues about the origin of the ruins.
*Clues found (2)

==Description==
The deaths of these [[Sundered Flame]] underscore how dangerous The [[Ruins of Karnthar]] are.

But [[Rannan Korren|Rannan]] believes that with some tinkering the [[:R.A.D.]] can still quell the energies here.

Again, we're treating the symptoms and not the root cause.

Search the ruins for clues and see if you can discern their original function. And make haste, <name>. We may not have much time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Were you able to learn anything about the ruins?

==Completion==
This is... not good news.

If [[Sindragosa]] could not control Karnthar and ordered this station abandoned, I can only imagine the nefarious things that the Sundered Flame could do with it.

We must not let it fall into their hands.

==Notes==
Rannan's gossip:
{{Dialogue|
Sorry, I'm a little busy. 

There's an unstable arcane bubble around that dragon console.

I'm calibrating the R.A.D. to dispel it safely!
}}

Look around and find [[Time-Worn Draconic Tablet]] and [[Ruined Draconic Tablet]] and read them.

;Returning to the duo
:{{Text|say|Lathos Sunband|... and we have no idea who [[Arcane Manipulator Tharohn|Tharohn]] is either... are you listening to me, Rannan?}}
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|Hm? Oh, sorry. I was still working on the R.A.D.}}
:{{Text|say|Lathos Sunband|Rannan, we can't function as a team if you don't listen to me!}}

Lathos has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
What I have seen here is troubling. All this power building... A dragon console unable to contain it... 

The situation has gone from exhilarating to terrifying.

Perhaps Rannan's device will continue to be a boon for us.
}}

Rannan has new gossip after the quest:
{{Dialogue|
Lathos is right. I should be listening to him... and reading the expedition's updates.

I just really want the R.A.D. to work.

But I need my partnership with Lathos to work too...
