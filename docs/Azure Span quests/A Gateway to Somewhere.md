==Objectives==
Follow [[Warpcaster Delandra]] to the Waygate's location.
*[[Warpcaster's Portal|Warpcaster Delandra's portal]] taken
*Warpcaster's spire portal taken
*[[Frenzied Arcane Thirster]] slain
*Escape with Warpcaster Delandra

==Description==
The enchantment will protect us from the unstable energy contained within.

I will open the way to the nearest stone. 

Once you pass through, stay close. I shall need your assistance when we arrive to power up the device.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Not quite what I expected, but we have arrived in one piece.

I must admit, with all that has happened I am even more curious about the potency of the vessel's contents now more than ever.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Warpcaster Delandra|The enchantment will only hold so long. Come. I shall open the way.}}
:{{text|say|Warpcaster Delandra|Meet me on the other side.}}
:''Delandra opens and then disappears into [[Warpcaster's Portal|a portal]].''

Take the first portal:
:''The portal leads to a spire at {{co|52.7|35.5|Azure Span}} to the east of [[Camp Antonidas]]. Warpcaster Delandra is holding a [[Spire Guardian]] in arcane stasis.''
:{{text|say|Warpcaster Delandra|Something is wrong. There is interference redirecting us from our destination. The enchantment must be waning!}}
:{{text|say|Warpcaster Delandra|Try the portal beside me, quickly! I will be right behind you.}}

Take the second portal:
:''This portal leads to ruins of a building at {{co|64.8|43.0|Azure Span}} farther east. A [[Frenzied Arcane Thirster]] approaches as Delandra ports in.''
:{{text|say|Warpcaster Delandra|I have never seen this place before. The vessel must be leaking latent energy!}}
:''The Frenzied Arcane Thirster attacks.''
:{{text|yell|Warpcaster Delandra|That thing must have sensed it! Hold it off while I work on getting us out of here!}}
Upon the creature's death:
:{{text|say|Warpcaster Delandra|That was close. Let us depart before more of those things pick up our scent.}}
:''She creates yet another portal and goes through it.''

Take the third portal:
:''This portal leads to {{co|48.7|30.3|Azure Span}} atop the southern spire at the [[Cobalt Assembly]].''
:{{text|say|Warpcaster Delandra|Yes, well. Here we are.}}
:{{text|say|Warpcaster Delandra|That could have gone a lot worse, all things considered.}}
