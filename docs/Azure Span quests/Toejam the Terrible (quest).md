==Objectives==
Help [[Rowie]] slay Toejam the Terrible.
*[[Toejam the Terrible]] slain

==Description==
You're right, I'm not strong enough to take on this [[yeti]]... not alone!

But you're here!

The lair of the evil yeti, Toejam the Terrible, is just ahead. This cave is... big. Not scary! Maybe a little scary.

Could you go in there and soften him up a bit? I'll... I'll be right behind you!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Toejam has been stealing our [[ottuk]]s for years! No doubt he eats our poor friends. How terrible!

==Completion==
Goodness, what did you tell him? I've never seen Rowie so spirited!

Thank you for bringing him home. I will do my best to take care of him in [[Kaqiata]]'s place.

==Notes==
Speak with Toejam the Terrible, a friendly yeti in the back of the cave:

{{book|content=
<Toejam looks at you with bright, curious eyes.>

{{gossip|<Brandish your weapon.>}}

<Toejam's brow furrows.

He shakes his head. No.>

{{gossip|<Try to explain that you need to fight him.>}}

<Toejam looks at you with sad eyes.>

{{gossip|<...>}}

<Toejam picks up a [[Icecling Ottuk|nearby ottuk]] and begins to pet it.>

{{gossip|<Ask if he could just pretend to let Rowie kill him.>}}

<Toejam cocks his head in confusion.>

{{gossip|<Mime pretending to be killed.>}}

<Toejam considers this.

After a moment, he shakes his head.>

{{gossip|<Explain there's this [[tuskarr]] kid, and [[Kaqiata|his mom]] just died, and he really needs some encouragement, and...>}}

<Toejam frowns.>

{{gossip|<... Mime dying and then someone crying over your corpse.>}}

<Toejam grunts in concern for you.

He tries to pass you a comforting ottuk, but it wriggles away.

Toejam frowns.

After a moment, he mimics you pretending to die.

He glances at you for approval.>

{{gossip|<Nod in encouragement.>}}
