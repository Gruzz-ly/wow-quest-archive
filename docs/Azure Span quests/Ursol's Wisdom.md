==Objectives==
Gain [[Ursol]]'s blessing.
* Ride the [[Winds of the Isles]] on a drake (Optional) {{co|66.3|13.2|Azure Span}}
* [[Rustpine Cone]] (12)

==Description==
[[File:Rustpine Cone.jpg|thumb|Rustpine Cone]]
We have strayed from wise Ursol's path, trading focus for obsession and contemplation for fear.

Gather cones from the mighty Rustpines. As their roots stretch deep into the earth, take strength from the waters, reach into the winds, and are ripened by fire, they will be a symbol of our renewed commitment to true balance.

Take to the skies on that drake of yours and you should be able to gather enough. The upper branches are the best place to find them.

Offer them to Ursol at his nearby shrine.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Balance must be restored.

==Completion==

Our path forward is clear now. Thank you for your part in this.

==Notes==
[[Rustpine Cone]]s are high up in the trees of [[Winterpelt Hollow]]. Regardless of outline mode, they'll be shaded in red if there's anything breaking line-of-sight of them to make them easier to collect. Fly through them to gather twelve.

Once complete, fly northeast of the hollow to find Ursol's Totem and a ring of ghost Rustpine Cones around it. Interact with the cones to beseech [[Ursol]]:
:{{text|say|Ursol|Your tenacity is admirable, <name>. The value of communication is lost on many these days.}}
:{{text|say|Ursol|The Winterpelt have lost their way as they now see. Mine and my brother's paths were never meant to be undertaken in isolation.}}
:{{text|say|Ursol|If they truly seek to return to balance, they have my blessing. It is long past due for them to return to the world.}}

On return, nearly all of the [[Winterpelt Furbolg]] and a few members of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]] have gathered in the cave. Many have gossip, noted in the [[Champion of the Winterpelt]] article.

==Progression==
