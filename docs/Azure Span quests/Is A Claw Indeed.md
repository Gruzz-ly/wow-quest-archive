==Objectives==
Attempt to activate the artifact.
*Artifact activated
*Rune drawn
*Runes drawn (3)

==Description==
<[[Venderthvan|Venderthven]]{{sic}} rubs his eyes and groans in pain.>

Fine. If you won't give it to me, you can do the work of figuring out how to make it work. 

I'll just take it from you when you're done. By force, if necessary.

So go ahead. Give it a shake or something.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +15 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
<Venderthvan is distracted, looking at a toy duck [[Nezzie]] is showing him.>

==Completion==
Huh? Oh, right. The arcana.

==Notes==
Players gain an [[Extra Action Button]]:
:{{Abilities|Shake Jar|Surely, SOMETHING will happen!|id=390374|icon=inv_potion_15}}

Use it:
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|Ah, a rune! Quickly, trace it to activate the magic!}}
:{{text|say|Nezzie|Whoa, pretty!}}

[[File:Is a Claw Indeed.jpg|thumb|Rune outlines]]
The outlines of runes appear on the ground, faint memories of a ''Legion'' world quest, [[Pop Quiz: Advanced Rune Drawing]]. Trace them on foot.

When the last circle of the rune is complete, it activates, spawning three more glowy markers on the ground:
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|Did you see? It branched off into other runes! Go trace those, too!}}
:{{text|say|[[Heleth the Wise]]|Why you gotta follow the glowy lights?}}
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|Because that should activate the power to stabilize arcana.}}
:{{text|say|Heleth the Wise|Why?}}
:{{text|say|Nezzie|Yeah, why?}}
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|Uh, Taran said it's so we can control the arcana and gain more power for the Sundered Flame.}}
:{{text|say|Heleth the Wise|Okay, why?}}
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|Er... so we can reclaim what is owed to us. The dracthyr deserve these lands.}}
:{{text|say|Heleth the Wise|Why?}}
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|Because... because, I mean, we're here, too. We didn't want to get locked up in stasis and all...}}
:{{text|say|Nezzie|You were locked up? That sucks!}}
:{{text|say|[[Tikkiz]]|Nobody said you didn't deserve a place!}}
:{{text|say|Heleth the Wise|Yeah! You can stay here with us! You just have to be nice! And helpful!}}
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|...}}

Rinse and repeat for the new runes.
