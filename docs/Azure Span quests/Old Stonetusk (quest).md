{{questportrait|Old Stonetusk.jpg|Old Stonetusk|An ancient bull [[mammoth]] who has become a danger to himself and others.}}
Put [[Old Stonetusk]] down near [[Camp Antonidas]].
*[[Old Stonetusk's Tusk]]
*Speak to [[Hemet Nesingwary Jr.]] in [[Camp Nowhere]].

==Description==
I have a grim task for you, <name>. Not every kill is a measure of skill. Some are measures of kindness.

There's an old bull mammoth wandering the forest east of Camp Antonidas. I saw him from a distance awhile back, and I hear his sad trumpeting every so often. Clearly he's in great pain.

He's started crashing blindly through the undergrowth, and I'm worried he's becoming a danger to others.

It'd make my old heart glad if you put a fellow weary soul to rest. Bring me his tusk so we can honor him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|55|24}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +150 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
This brings me no joy.

But I'll hang his tusk in a place of honor.

Thank you, <name>.
