==Objectives==
Recover personal effects from the fallen [[Winterpelt Forager]]s.
* [[Winterpelt Jewelry]] (6) {{co|68|18|Azure Span}}

==Description==
There's nothin' we can do for the foragers the [[Primalists]] killed, but we can at least try an' provide some closure tae their kin.

See if ye can find anythin' of a personal nature on the fallen. I'm sure the Winterpelt will appreciate whatever ye can bring them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How many did the Primalists kill?

==Completion==
It's not much, but it's somethin'. And that's what matters.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests before heading out. Southeast of the [[Winterpelt Hollow]] village proper is a frozen-over lake full of Charfrost [[primalists]] and elementals, and dead [[Winterpelt Forager]]s. Kill the former for [[Frosty Foraged Foods]] and loot the latter for [[Winterpelt Jewelry]].
