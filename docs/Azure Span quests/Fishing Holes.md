'''Fishing Holes''' is the unlock quest for [[Fishing Hole]]s in the [[Dragon Isles]]. [[Rowie]] will run up and offer this quest when you reach Renown level 4 with the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Nunvuq]] at [[Iskaara]] in The [[Azure Span]].
*Learn Spell: Dragon Isles Fishing

==Description==
Hello again! Did you know I'm gonna be the bestest fisherman in the village? I caught a giant piranha once. It tried to eat my face!

<Rowie looks around distractedly.>

Oh yeah! I have a message for you. Nunvuq, back in Iskaara, wants to tell you about fishing holes.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Fishing Holes|Unlock the ability to see the great [[Fishing Hole]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]] on your map.|id=388968|icon=ui_majorfaction_tuskarr}}

==Completion==
Hail, fellow fisher.

I'm almost hesitant to tell you of these serene fishing holes. But I must, because not doing so would deny you a bounty of fish and also the pleasure of a relaxing time fishing.

In telling everyone I worry about crowding my fishing spot, but I'll admit I can only take so much of the quiet. A good conversation with fishing friends is an even better way to relax than fishing alone!
