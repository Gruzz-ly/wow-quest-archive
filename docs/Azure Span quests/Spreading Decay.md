==Objectives==
Meet [[Brena]] at the trading outpost.

==Description==
<Brena turns [[Kargpaw the Fetid|Kargpaw]]'s [[Kargpaw's Totem|totem]] over and over in her thick hands.>

Kargpaw is a pawn. He isn't the source of this rot. We must find it, before the [[decay]] spreads further.

The closest [[tuskarr]] presence from here is a trading outpost, just across the bridge on the way to [[Iskaara]].

We should check in with them... and quickly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|69|15}}
* 1,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
As I feared, they were attacked as well.

==Notes==
On accept, the gathered tuskarr all move out:
:{{text|say|Brena|Let's be off. We will do what we can to aid you, once we uncover the source of this rot.}}
:{{text|say|Norukk|Judging by the gnoll's sudden aggression... I fear for the inhabitants of the trading outpost.}}
:{{text|say|Hanu|Norukk! Get out of your head and get a move on!}}
:{{text|say|Norukk|Yes, yes. Coming!}}

Back down to the road and head west. Just across the bridge, however...
:{{text|say|Norukk|I hate being right all the time.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Poa|I hate how insufferable you are. All. The. Time.}}
:{{text|say|Hanu|Shh, loves. Both of you.}}

==Progression==
