==Objectives==
Kill 16 Shadepaw gnolls in [[Kargpaw's Den]].
*[[Shadepaw]] [[gnoll]]s slain (16)

==Description==
I'm catching a strange scent on the wind. Something here isn't right...

[[Hanu]] described the gnolls in this cave as strange... and sickly. We should learn more about what is causing this.

Don't let your guard down. Despite their sickly appearance, expect them to be just as devious and dangerous.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Take care not to contract whatever malady these gnolls suffer from.

==Completion==
We have never seen rot take on a form like this.

This is troubling.

==Notes==
On accept of all four:
:{{text|say|Hanu|I will go with you.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|No, Hanu! I will not lose you to Kargpaw.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Our newfound friend is quite skilled. Trust in <name>.}}

Brena's gossip
{{Dialogue|We must learn more about these gnolls, and what they're plotting.}}

Kill [[Sickly Shaman]], [[Sickly Grunt]]s, [[Sickly Ambusher]]s, and [[Sickly Brute]]s.
