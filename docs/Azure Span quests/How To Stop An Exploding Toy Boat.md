==Objectives==
Speak with [[Toolk]]'s mother, then recover [[Toolk's Toy Boat|the toy boat]].
*[[Julk]] spoken to
*[[Miva's Dispelling Wand]]
*[[Arcane]] [[magic]] dispelled from toy boat

==Description==
I am loathe to part a child from their toy, but it would be a great value to the [[Kirin Tor]] to study how it absorbed so much [[arcana]].

Then again... I do not want to slight our new [[tuskarr]] allies. I do have a wand that could dispel the magic...

Let's speak with Toolk's mother, then decide what to do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
The wand should handle any dispelling if we're not too late.

==Completion==
We did the right thing today. There will be more magical oddities to research, but this girl will not get more gifts from her lost father.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Julk
:{{Gossip|Your daughter ran off with a dangerous... boat. We need to either take it or dispel its magics.}}
:{{Text|say|Julk|I heard everything you said. Toolk has been attached to that boat ever since her father left.}}
:{{Text|say|Miva Star-Eye|Then we have no choice... I cannot separate a child from their father's memento.}}
:{{Text|say|Miva Star-Eye|<Name>, take my wand. Toolk could not have gone far. Dispel the boat, then bring everyone back here.}}
:''Miva places her wand on the table.''
:{{Text|say|Julk|She has a hiding spot to the west. Toolk goes there whenever she misses her father.}}

Pick up the wand on the table (but not the [[Scroll of Blinding Speed]]...) and head slightly south.

;Approaching Toolk and the [[Unstable Toy Boat]]
:{{Text|say|Toolk|Boaty? How come you are glowing so weird?}}

Click on the boat to dispel its magic.

:{{Text|say|Toolk|You fixed my boat! Now I can play with it forever and ever! You are the BEST!}}
:''Toolk runs back to his mother.''

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Miva Star-Eye|I am glad your daughter could hold onto her father's last gift. No magical research is worth that.}}
:{{Text|say|Julk|Last gift?}}
:''Suddenly, [[Palv]] enters the camp.''
:{{Text|say|Palv|Guess who has a nice haul of fish from the gleamlet!}}
:{{Text|say|Toolk|DAD! You've been gone forever!}}
:{{Text|say|Palv|It's only been a few hours! And guess what... [[Ruriq]] made you another toy boat!}}
:{{Text|say|Toolk|This one is WAY cooler than my old boat!}}
:{{Text|say|Julk|Toolk will be the most spoiled girl in all [[Iskaara]] if you keep this up!}}
:{{Text|emote|Miva Star-Eye stares into the distance.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Arcane Detector]]|Arcane buildup detected. Source: nearby [[tauren]].}}
