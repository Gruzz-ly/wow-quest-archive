==Objectives==
Use [[Radza Thunderclaw|Radza's]] incense to allow spirit sight.
* Used Radza's Incense

==Description==
[[File:Radza's Spirit Incense.jpg|thumb|Radza's Spirit Incense]]
It is time to take the next step to understanding [[Winterpelt Furbolg|the Winterpelt]]. That step is a spiritual one.

They look to their ancestors for advice as they choose their path forward. We can learn from them too.

But the Winterpelt rite to call their ancestors is... intricate. And long.

It would be rude to copy their ritual anyway. We'll do it our way with Rustpine Spiritspeaker incense.

Come! Let us reveal their ancestors' wisdom and learn more about our new friends!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|2|25}}
* 2,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
When you're ready, the incense will allow you to see spirits.

==Completion==
Can you see them?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Radza Thunderclaw|Our incense is not as strong as the Winterpelts', but I want to respect their traditions. And our time.}}
:{{text|say|Radza Thunderclaw|It only works once. Use it wisely.}}

The incense is next to Radza. Interact with it:
:The strong odor coming from the bowl smells like a mixture of various herbs with burning hair.
:{{gossip|<Breathe in the smoke to entice visions of the Winterpelt ancestors.>}}
:{{text|say|Radza Thunderclaw|I sense... the ancestors are with us.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Radza Thunderclaw|The ancestors may have much to say. You would do well to hear them.}}
:{{text|whisper|Ancestor Brazzok|[Furbolg] <Class>, let us speak.}}

Brazzok offers the direct follow-up, but two more ancestors are also visible in the Hollow with quests: [[Jhagaza the Wordkeeper]] with [[History Heist]] and [[Ancestor Molg]] with [[Our Path Ahead]].

Additionally, the spirit of [[Saza]] is back, next to her sister [[Jyrra "Fuzzy Feet" Coldsoar]]:
:Hi again, <name>!

An Ancestor is sitting by the fireplace near [[Sonova Snowden]] and offers the following gossip:

No, I am not actually eating with my family.

Sometimes it is not about the food itself.
