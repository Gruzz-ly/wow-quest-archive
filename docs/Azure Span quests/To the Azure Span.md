==Objectives==
Meet with [[Glania of the Blessed Ones]] within the [[Azure Span]].

==Description==
Greetings, <name>!

[[Pakina]] and I are here on behalf of the [[Kirin Tor]] looking for aid.

The Kirin Tor are working to safeguard the wild [[arcane]] [[magic]] located all throughout the Azure Span.

[[Kalecgos]], the [[Dragon Aspects|Aspect]] of the [[blue dragonflight]] and one of [[Council of Six|our leaders]], needs aid in reclaiming the [[Azure Oathstone]] there as well.

If you're willing to help, keep traveling along the road to find Glania of the Blessed Ones.

She can direct you to where you can help the most.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|69|15}}
*1,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
;Non-dracthyr
Excellent, an [[adventurer]]. I can fill you in on the details before I have to learn to... fish.

;Dracthyr
Ah, an adventurer. You must be a [[dracthyr]].

The Kirin Tor could use your aid, however some of your allies are also here looking for support.

I suggest you speak with them first before investigating what the Kirin Tor require.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Masud the Wise|Glania can help direct you towards the Kirin Tor's efforts in the Azure Span. Make sure to tell her Masud and Pakina sent you!}}
:{{Text|say|Pakina|Ooo... how many more adventurers should we find?}}
:{{Text|say|Masud the Wise|Hrm... maybe three or four more? Five adventurers seems like a good number to have for any task.}}

Head to [[Khuri's Fishing Spot]].

;Approaching Glania
:{{Text|say|Glania of the Blessed Ones|I am sorry, but I do not know how to do this fishing. Can it not wait?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Khuri]]|If you all insist on examining fish for this "essence", then the least you can do is help me catch more.}}

*[[Some Good Fishing]]
*[[Arcane Detection]]
*[[WANTED: Gorger]]

;Upon completion for dracthyr
