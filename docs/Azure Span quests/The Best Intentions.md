==Objectives==
Look for a key to [[Marithos]]'s shackles in the [[Lonely Falls]].
*[[Sundered Shackles Key]] {{co|72.7|54.1|Azure Span}}

==Description==
Not only did they beat him--they put him in shackles too!

What's worse is... I probably would have done the same...

We will not be able to carry Marithos out of here with this weight chained to him. The key must be around the camp somewhere. Try to find it, <name>, while I keep him comfortable.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
We must free Marithos from his bonds.

==Completion==
Is that the key, <name>? Good. Let's get these shackles off of Marithos. Then we can start thinking about what to do next.

==Notes==
The key is inside a cart at {{co|72.7|54.1|Azure Span}} by the campfire west of the lake.

==Progression==
{{A Single Wing}}
