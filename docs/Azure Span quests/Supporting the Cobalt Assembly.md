==Objectives==
Speak with [[Venthi]] within the [[Cobalt Assembly]].

==Description==
<Name>, excellent timing.

Have you heard of the Cobalt Assembly? It was once a wondrous place where most of my kin lived.

The [[Sundered Flame]] forced us out and have taken it over.

There was a hope that we could take it from them, but the latest information from there shows we are fighting a losing battle.

Can you lend us your support? Meet Venthi within the Cobalt Assembly if you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|4|50}}
*4,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We could always use more aid. Allow me to tell you of our current situation.

==Trivia==
*During development, the quest was named '''Aiding the Cobalt Assembly'''.

==Progression==
