==Objectives==
Find [[Sundered Flame|Sundered Flames]] documents and bring them to [[Lathos Sunband|Lathos]].
*[[Sundered Flames Expedition Orders]] (4)

==Description==
It is vital that we determine the Sundered Flame's mission in [[Ruins of Karnthar|these ruins]] and how it relates to the [[arcane]] surge.

We'll do this the old fashioned way: reconnaissance and espionage.

The ruins are overrun with Sundered Flame devotees. I am sure some of them carry orders that may illuminate their mysterious goals.

Use any means necessary to obtain these documents.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|20|18|61}}
* 5,900 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Have you found anything yet, <name>?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I am humbled by your skill and efficiency.

Maybe I'm not the only one who will be a "good influence" on Rannan.

Now... let us find out what the Sundered Flame is doing here.

==Notes==
Lathos has gossip:
{{Dialogue|
If Rannan's device can neutralize the arcane energy surge, our expedition will be less dangerous... 

But the "R.A.D" won't answer the questions of why, how, and who behind the mysterious surge..

For that we must rely on a more... traditional approach.
}}

Kill [[Arcane Manipulator]]s and [[Tarasek Warrior]]s to loot the orders.

After completion Lathos has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
These documents refer to a "[[Arcane Manipulator Tharohn|Tharohn]]" as the leader of this contingent of [[Sundered Flame]].

She sounds very ambitious and ruthless--a dangerous combination of traits.

These ruins lay atop what she refers to as a "point of power." I think we can safely say she wishes to claim it for the Sundered Flame--and herself.

But it is unclear what she will do with it once she harnesses it...
