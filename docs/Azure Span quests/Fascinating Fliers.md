==Completion==
I saw a [[drake]] with a spotted pattern fly by yesterday! That was certainly a first for me, but you probably see many like it in your travels! 

That said, I took detailed notes in case it's a new subspecies. It also had some other fascinating traits I had not seen previously!

If you'd like to read more of my observations, pick a manuscript to take with you. And if you'd like more reading material, I'll happily trade with you.
