==Objectives==
Meet [[Garz]] at [[Camp Nowhere]].

==Description==
We cannot stay here.

I do not know what to do... where to go next...

We will return to your Camp Nowhere. The [[tuskarr]] should know what happened at [[Rustpine Den|Rustpine]].

If we tell our story and keep it, maybe it will not happen again...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|69|15}}
* 980 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Rustpine clan|Our clan]] has been clawed to shreds.

I hope another will accept us.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|[[Garz]]|Farewell, Rustpine.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Narn]]|We are strong. We will survive.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Radza Thunderclaw]]|We must do more than just... survive.}}
:''The furbolgs head out of the Den.''

Approach the furbolgs and tuskarr at Camp Nowhere:
:{{Text|say|Garz|My home is gone.}}
:{{Text|say|Sirja|...What?}}

On complete:
:{{Text|say|Garz|We could not save my people.}}
:{{Text|say|Radza Thunderclaw|A few of us escaped, thanks to <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Sirja]]|It seems... we have much in common...}}
:{{Text|say|Sirja|Why don't you stay here a while?}}
:{{Text|say|Garz|We will... for a time. But we cannot stay long.}}

Completing the quest also awards the "Rustpine Den" criterion of [[Sojourner of Azure Span]]. The next breadcrumb quest, [[What of the Winterpelt Clan?]] will be offered if players have not already completed [[Academic Acquaintances]], from the "Winterpelt Hollow" chapter of the [[Azure Span storyline]].

Either way, these two chapters conclude the [[Winterpelt Furbolg]] storyline in patch 10.0.
