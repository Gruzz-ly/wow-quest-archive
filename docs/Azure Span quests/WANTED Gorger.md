==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Gorger.jpg|Gorger|A massive beast far from its normal hunting grounds.}}
Slay [[Gorger]] and recover its horns.
*[[Curved Horns]]
*Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
If you are going to be amongst the [[tuskarr]], you would do well to lend a hand!

As of late, a beast we call Gorger has been making its home nearby.

More of its kind seem to be migrating to this area. This is something we can take advantage of.

Kill the Gorger and bring me its horns. We'll need them for building supplies to expand [[Khuri's Fishing Spot|this outpost]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|82|86}}
* 30,800 [[XP]]
* +400 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Do you have the horns?

==Completion==
Fine work! We'll put this aside for our future building plans.

It is concerning Gorger and its kind have migrated down here, but we will make the best of it.

==Progression==
