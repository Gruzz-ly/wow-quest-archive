'''Tuskarr Champion's Tales''' becomes available at Renown level 5 with the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]].

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:

==Completion==
The deeds of the tuskarr of the Dragon Isles are many!

Over the years though, some of our stories have been lost. Many travelers never returned from their journeys with tales to tell.

Please, if you find any scrolls that document what our lost brethren were able to accomplish, bring them back to me.
