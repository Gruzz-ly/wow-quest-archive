At Winterpelt language skill 25, [[Sonova Snowden]] offers this quest and [[Hive Maintenance]]. 

==Objectives==
Collect 8 Honeyfreeze Honey for [[Sonova Snowden]].
* [[Honeyfreeze Honey]] (8) {{co|62|20|Azure Span}}

==Description==
[[File:Honeyfreeze Honeycomb.jpg|thumb|Honeyfreeze Honeycomb]]
Right, so now that we've established somewhat friendlier relations and learned a wee bit of [[Winterpelt Furbolg|Winterpelt]], it's about time tae make friends in the proper dwarf manner.

What gesture of friendship is better than a stiff drink tae ward off tae cold? Both [[dwarf|dwarves]] and [[furbolg]]s have a long history of brewin', so we can call it somethin' of a cultural exchange too!

I saw some hearty lookin' bees a bit south of here. And where there's bees, there's honey. And where there's honey, there could be mead.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I can almost taste it already.

==Completion==
This'll do nicely.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests before heading out.

Southwest of [[Theron's Watch]] and the [[Misty Canyon Overlook]] is an area of the [[Upper Frostlands]] that is not covered in snow, occupied by [[Frostsap Ancient]]s and friendly [[Honeyfreeze Pollinator]]s. Run through [[Blooming Frostshell]] plants to pick up a ten-second buff:
:{{Abilities|Pollen Power!|Coated in delicious, energizing pollen, increasing movement speed by 25%.|id=399327|icon=inv_misc_dust_01|notes=10 sec buff}}

Run the pollen through pollinators and neutral [[Honeyfreeze Buzzer]]s before the buff wears off.

[[Honeyfreeze Honeycomb]]s are on the large fallen tree in the area. Looting the honeycombs will turn the buzzers hostile!

While in the area, Saza is also wandering around:

:{{text|say|Saza|[Furbolg] I saw you in the village before. Some of the others are unsure of you. But you seem friendly to me.}}
:{{text|say|Saza|[Furbolg] Are you here to see the bees too?}}
:{{text|say|Saza|[Furbolg] The best honey is at the wide part of the log, friend!}}
:{{text|say|Saza|[Furbolg] I try to be just like the bees--always busy.}}
:{{text|say|Saza|[Furbolg] Will I see you in the village? I'd like that.}}
