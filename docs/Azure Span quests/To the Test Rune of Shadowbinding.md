==Objectives==
Defeat Gnarlroot, Igira the Cruel, and Volocross in [[Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope]].
* Defeat [[Gnarlroot (tactics)|Gnarlroot]] while Shadowbound
* Defeat [[Igira the Cruel]] while Shadowbound
* Defeat [[Volcoross]] while Shadowbound
* [[Lydiara's Rune of Shadowbinding]]

==Description==
We need to finalize the binding. We can attune the components properly by testing them in combat against [[Fyrakk]]'s most powerful lieutenants. Then we can bind the attuned materials to [[Fyr'alath]].

If you can defeat Gnarlroot, Igira the Cruel, and Volcoross while this rune is bound to them, you'll be ready to fully attune the Rune of Shadowbinding.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* [[Attuned Rune of Shadowbinding]]

==Completion==
How exciting! I'm more of a crafter than a fighter, but your martial skills are quite impressive!
