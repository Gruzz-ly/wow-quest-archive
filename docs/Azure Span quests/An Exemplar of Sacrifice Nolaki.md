==Objectives==
Help [[Nolaki]] defeat a massive slime.
*Find Nolaki (Optional)
*Nolaki assisted

==Description==
Much is said about how [[decay]] spreads through the air and ground. But it also spreads through the water. 

Slimes that live in the rivers and streams ooze pestilence. The water is toxic with it. But if we wade in and kill the big one, the poison in the water will diminish.

It may poison me in the process, but I am going to kill one if it's the last thing I do. This place needs a purging. 

Are you with me, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
When you're ready, meet me northwest of here, and we'll take care of that giant slime.

==Completion==
Thank you for stopping those smaller slimes, <name>. I was able to kill the big one, but I would still be there if it weren't for your aid.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Nolaki|I can smell that slime, <name>. It is close.}}

Find Nolaki at {{Co|16.84|29.96|Azure Span}} and speak with her:
:We must keep the decay from spreading in the water no matter the cost.
:{{Gossip|quest=|I will help you defeat the giant slime.}}

:{{Text|say|Nolaki|There it is! I'll destroy it before it spreads more of its filth!}}
:{{Text|say|Nolaki|Your decay will go no further you nasty thing!}}
:''Nolaki empowers herself and kills the [[Massive Decay]].''
:{{Text|say|Nolaki|No! It slimed me! I can't move! Kill the little ones, <name>!}}

Three [[Decaying Remnant]]s appear. Kill them.
:{{Text|say|Nolaki|Ugh. Thank you for helping me, <name>! But let's not tell the others about me getting slimed. I'll never hear the end of it!}}
