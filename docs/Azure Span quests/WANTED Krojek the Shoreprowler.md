==Description==
We've been watching the great shark we know as Krojek for many years now, waiting for the best time to hunt him down. 

His hunting ground has meandered closer and closer to the shore. That means the time is now. Gather your hunting party and take him out!

You will receive:
* {{cost|80|74|44}}
* 23,550 [[XP]]
* +400 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Completion==
It is the cycle of the sea life out here. Some we leave to continue the line. Some we cull, some we eat. All in balance.

==Patch changes==
