==Objectives==
Destroy 3 Lava Orbs.
*[[Lava Orb|Lava orbs]] destroyed (3)
*Meet Khadgar's projection further within the Vakthros Range.

==Description==
The [[Primalists]] have torn apart the mountain to send their forces streaming to [[Vakthros]]!

I spied some lava orbs in the initial corridor that they're using to spread more of their elemental chaos.

Destroy them to help slow their advance. I'll do what I can from up here to help [[Kalecgos]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Be safe.

==Completion==
That should slow them down a bit. It seems I'm getting a bit rusty compared to the fight with the [[Burning Legion]]...

==Notes==
Lava Orbs are marked on the minimap at {{co|72.3|37.3|Azure Span}}, {{co|73.1|37.8|Azure Span}}, and 

==Progression==
