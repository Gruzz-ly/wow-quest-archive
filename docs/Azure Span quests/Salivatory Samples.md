==Objectives==
Collect 12 Saliva Samples in [[Gorloc Shore]].
*[[Saliva Sample]] (12)

==Description==
<The gaunt [[undead]] pinches the bridge of his nose and sighs heavily.>

This is going to reflect very poorly on my record. Somehow in a single day we've managed to stir up the local [[gorloc]]s, lose half of our equipment, and are now down a [[Dark Iron dwarf|dwarf]].

In this situation, protocol dictates that we be as efficient as possible. Go thin out some of our toothy antagonists and bring me their saliva for further testing while you're at it.

Only the good stuff, mind you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Have you secured the samples?

==Completion==
Well, what do you know? Someone around here actually accomplished something. What's that old saying? Two for you, one for me?

<Rowe takes a small sip from the beaker.>

Ah, that's the stuff.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of all three

:{{Text|say|[[Grak'i]]|Don't know, brother. How many?}}
:{{Text|say|Wayun|One. But you have to throw it pretty far out.}}
:{{Text|say|Grak'i|Ha!}}
:{{Text|emote|Grak'i lets out a booming laugh.}}

==Progression==
