'''Netting More''' becomes available at Renown level 13 with the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]].  This quest has no rewards; it exists only to direct you to [[Tavio]], who can improve your [[:Tuskarr Fishing Net]] with [[Draconium Net Weights]] and an [[Imbu Knot]].

==Completion==
Your nets seem to be faring well in the fishing holes, but I think we can do better!

If you can get me the materials, I can help you craft some improvements to help you catch even more.
