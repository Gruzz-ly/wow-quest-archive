==Objectives==
Slay 6 Feasting Wyrms.
*[[Feasting Wyrm]] slain (6)
*[[Arcane Hook]] (provided)

==Description==
A large number of [[mana wyrm]]s are absorbing the wild [[arcane]] [[magic]] coming out from the archives.

The rate that they're doing it is causing the [[ley lines]] to be thrown off balance... which is preventing the [[Azure Oathstone]] from being reclaimed.

I will use some of the unstable arcana you collected to form a hook of sorts.

Use it to slay several of the wyrms. The brief delay will be enough for me to adjust the energies below.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Windswept Hood
|Twisted Leather Hood
|Bramble Chain Helm
|Sleet Shined Skullguard
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
These wyrms will learn to feast somewhere else.

==Completion==
The Kirin Tor will ensure these archives are properly cared for when this is finished. Thank you for your aid.

==Notes==
Watch out for the swirlies on the platform! Getting hit by one will knock the hapless player off to a (likely) certain death!

Either click on a mana wyrm or target it and use the provided [[Arcane Hook]] to drag it in, then defeat it. Repeat.

==Progression==
{{Into the Archives}}
