==Objectives==
Find Neelo and Nau.
*[[Neelo]] and [[Nau]] found

==Description==
Hello again.

Could you do me and [[Norukk]] a favor? Our kids, Neelo and Nau, left to play. They know they should be back by now.

I am occupied, so please find them. I doubt they are in danger, my kids know how to take care of themselves.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|45|74}}
*3,950 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Neelo and Nau can fend for themselves. But they know they are supposed to be home helping by now.

==Completion==
Ta says all [[gnoll]]s are dangerous and mean. But this is just a baby!

Ma says I always have to take care of Nau, and she's a baby, too.

==Notes==
Find the [[tuskarr]] kids at {{Co|10.60|46.90|Azure Span}} with [[Scaps]].
