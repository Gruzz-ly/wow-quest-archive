==Objectives==
Recover Gruff Fisher's Net from ice holes in [[Azure Span]].

You may unlock only one extra fishing net per day.
*[[Gruff Fisher's Net]]

==Description==
Alas, my fishing net was carried away by the stream. <Sigh> I'm not too keen to use fishing poles like my friends...<br>
If you happen to find my fishing net around, bring it back to me.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Restock Fish|id=384012|Increases the remaining stock of fish by 10.|icon=achievement_profession_fishing_findfish}}
:{{Abilities|Extra Net - Grimtusk's|id=399020|Completing this task frees up space for another net to be placed in this fishing hole today.|icon=inv_fishing_nethooks01}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* [[Ominous Conch]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Any luck finding the net?

==Completion==
You you{{sic}} found it! Alas, too late, I've got a replacement from Tavio in Iskaara already. Feel free to keep it, it's best fit for catching fish in these icy waters.
