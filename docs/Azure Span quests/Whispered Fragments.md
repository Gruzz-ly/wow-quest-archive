==Objectives==
Recover 40 Whispering Fragments from the [[Sundered Flame]].
*[[Whispering Fragments]] (40)

==Description==
I believe [[Valthrux]] is trying to communicate to us through the shard we recovered.

We can use this to our advantage as long as we keep our minds guarded from the artifact's influence.

I was wrong about the Sundered Flame. They have unfortunately collected several shard fragments already.

Valthrux's whispers claim they're close to finding its location.

Go and recover the shards from the Sundered Flame before they reach the artifact!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
The whispers... they're... louder now. Do you have the fragments?

==Completion==
Excellent. With this many shards, I'll be able to easily locate the artifact.

==Notes==
While searching for the tablets, kill any Sundered Flame members to loot the Whispering Fragments.

==Progression==
{{Lost Ruins}}
