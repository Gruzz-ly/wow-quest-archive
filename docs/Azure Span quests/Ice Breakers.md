==Objectives==
Break Freezing Waters from ice near the [[Kauriq Gleamlet]].
*[[Freezing Water]] thawed (5)

==Description==
I knew [[Kauriq the Gleamfisher|the ancestor]] would approve!

I don't know much about spirits -- [[Kauj]] is the [[shaman]]. But we will need to appease the great Spirits of Air and Water before they will appear to us.

Anyone could see [[water elemental]]s up the mountain slowly freezing. It is not a natural freeze. Cold has been coming down the mountains more than usual, lately. Left be, our entire river could ice over.

Release them from their icy prisons!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
We welcome the natural shift of the earth, but this encroaching ice... it threatens our entire home.

==Completion==
Excellent. [[Otu'rorq]], the local River Spirit, will be pleased to know his river will continue to flow, for now.

==Notes==
