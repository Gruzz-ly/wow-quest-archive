==Objectives==
Decrystallize Mordigan Ironjaw in [[Gorloc Shore]].
*[[Mordigan Ironjaw|Mordigan]] decrystallized
*Speak to [[Aelnara]].

==Description==
I've scouted the perimeter. If Mordigan's anywhere, he's inside this cave.

<Muffled curses and insults echo out from the cave entrance.>

He's definitely inside this cave.

[[LOU-C Fitzcog|LOU-C]] said these crystals have dangerous dehydrating properties. See if you can't separate him from his... geological finds. And try not to hurt him too much.

He's fairly respected in his field.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|53|82|96}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +400 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Completion==
An inelegant solution, but I appreciate your quick thinking and... resourcefulness.
