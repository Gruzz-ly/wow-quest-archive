'''A Single Wing''' begins the quest line of the same name in the [[Fury Incarnate campaign]]. Find [[Scalecommander Emberthal]] and [[Amythora]] northwest of the [[Obsidian Enclave]] in [[Valdrakken]].

==Objectives==
Look for [[Marithos]] in the [[Azure Span]].
*Find Marithos in the Azure Span

==Description==
[[Amythora]] has returned with grave news. The [[Sundered Flame]] live on!

We have been trying to locate and repatriate independent bands of [[dracthyr]] here in [[Valdrakken]]. I sent Amythora and Marithos to talk to the last of them, but Amythora reports they are a remnant of the Sundered Flame. 

And they have captured Marithos!

Given that he used to be one of them, Marithos could be in grave danger. We must investigate and ensure his safety.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}

==Completion==
He is badly injured. <name>, we must help him!

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Amythora! Have you and Marithos made contact with the holdout dracthyr settlements? Any news of [[Dezran]]?}}
:{{text|say|Amythora|Scalecommander! The Sundered Flame! They're back!}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|The Sundered Flame? How?}}
:{{text|say|Amythora|I do not know. We were scouting the camp at Lonely Falls and were ambushed. They took Marithos!}}

Head to the [[Lonely Falls]] of southeastern [[Azure Span]] to spot [[Marithos]] with a ball and chain attached to his left leg as Amythora flies in:
:{{text|say|Amythora|Marithos! What have they done to you?}}

;Emberthal's gossip
:We must act quickly, <name>.

;Amythora's gossip
