==Objectives==
6 Winterpelt furbolgs defeated.
*[[Winterpelt tribe|Winterpelt]] [[furbolg]]s defeated (6)

==Description==
With the Winterpelt all in a tizzy, I don't imagine they'll appreciate ya poking around up there. 

Don't be afraid to defend yourself if they start somethin'. A firm reminder that ya mean business might knock some sense back into 'em.

Try not to kill anyone though, will ya? I know how ya adventurin' types can get.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Winterpelt Furbolg]]

==Progress==
If ye hit a furbolg right in tha nose, it'll stun 'em. Or... so I've heard.

==Completion==
Hopefully ye didn't go too hard on 'em.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Hollow Up]] before heading out.

Defeat [[Winterpelt Defender]]s, [[Winterpelt Shaman]], [[Winterpelt Snowspeaker]]s, and [[Winterpelt Guardian]]s, but they will turn friendly, cower, and run off before dying.
