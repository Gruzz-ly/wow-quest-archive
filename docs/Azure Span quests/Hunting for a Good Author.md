'''Hunting for a Good Author''' begins the second chapter of the [[Otherworldly Ecologist]] campaign for [[Ecological Succession]] at the [[Oasis]] in [[K'aresh]]. It was first made available during the second half of the week of 12 August 2025.

==Objectives==
Look for Hemet Nesingwary in the [[Azure Span]] on the [[Dragon Isles]].
* Take the portal to the Azure Span (Optional)
* Speak with [[Ve'nari]] (Optional)
* [[Hemet Nesingwary]] found

==Description==
I am growing concerned that we may be in danger of overbalancing the ecosystem. We require a consultant. 

Have you read "[[The Green Hills of Stranglethorn]]?" I enjoyed it a great deal. The author appears to have turned from hunter to conservationist. Do not ask how I acquired this information. 

However, these are precisely the two skills I need. Retrieve him. Last I heard, he was in the Azure Span on the Dragon Isles. Use the portal to travel there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
If ye need my help, I need yours first.

==Notes==
Speak with Ve'nari again:
{{dialogue|
Ah, you are here. Good. There is work to be done.

{{gossip|quest=|You're keeping tabs on people on Azeroth?}}

Of course, <name>.

I am an information gatherer, and your little rock has a lot of excitement occurring on it.

Why, I have been tracking you since last we met.

{{gossip|quest=|How did you get Hemet's books?}}

I do not need to explain myself to you.

Suffice to say, I enjoyed his book. 

All of his books, not just his famous ones.

{{gossip|quest=|Are you just using this as an excuse to meet your favorite author?}}

I am a consummate professional, <name>.

I do not make decisions based upon my whims, but for the good of everyone.

Now, go retrieve him for me. I mean us.}}

She opens a Portal to the Azure Span to the west, behind [[Om'kota]], which drops players off on the main east-west road of the [[Azure Span]] not far out of [[Iskaara]]:
