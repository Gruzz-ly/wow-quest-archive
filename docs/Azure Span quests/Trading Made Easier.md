Have you traveled much? You don't look like you have--you're missing one of my sturdy backpacks!

A good pack will make all the difference out in the world. You've helped my people out many times, so I want to offer you one of my best basic packs.

I have many other packs as well! If you would like to offer a fair trade, I will gladly trade you for more.
