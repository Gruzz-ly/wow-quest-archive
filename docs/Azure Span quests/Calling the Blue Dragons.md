==Objectives==
View Kalecgos call back the [[blue dragonflight]].
*[[Kalecgos]] spoken to

==Description==
I can no longer be afraid of reuniting the [[blue dragon]]s, <name>. It is better for us to be a family... than a fragment of our former selves.

Even if I cannot reclaim [[Azure Oathstone|the oathstone]], I can still use its power to send a message to all of the blue dragons. 

It is time they received word... from their [[Dragon Aspects|Aspect]].

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Whirling Surge Unlock|Unlocks the ability Whirling Surge. Spiral forward a great distance, increasing speed.|id=377709|icon=ability_dragonriding_barrelroll01}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|6|72|87}}
* 2,450 [[XP]]
*[[Highland Drake]]

==Progress==
Stand back, <name>.

==Completion==
We need to move, <name>.

==Notes==
Speak with Kalecgos:
{{Dialogue|
The blue dragons must be reunited if we are to defend Azeroth once again.

{{gossip|I'm ready to see you call back the blue dragonflight.}}

An [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays out:
{{#ev:youtube|Q-43-EayHv0}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Kalecgos puts out a call for blue dragons. [[Khadgar]] returns, [[Raszageth]] is attacking!}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I... hope that worked. I need my flight.}}
:{{text|say|[[Sindragosa (simulacrum)|Sindragosa]]|We will see in due time.}}
:''The oathstone glimmers with power, but only Khadgar teleports in.''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Khadgar--what's happened?}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|The [[Primalists]] are on the move!}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|It seems we did far too well at stymieing their efforts at [[Vakthros]].}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Raszageth has renewed the attack herself!}}
:{{text|say|Sindragosa|If Vakthros falls, the whole of the [[Azure Span]] will fall with it.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Quickly then! We must stop her, before all is lost!}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Hopefully we won't have to face her alone.}}

On the other side of the cutscene, they continue:
:{{text|say|Sindragosa|Vakthros is connected to the major ley lines in Azure Span. If it is destroyed, the Archives would cease to exist... along with the rest of the Azure Span.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I don't suppose any more blue dragons showed up to help?}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Not yet... it will be up to us to stop this.}}
