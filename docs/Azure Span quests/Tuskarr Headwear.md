Greetings, dear friend. 

You've been so kind to our community here in [[Iskaara]]. I have heard of your deeds and wanted to knit you something as a thanks.

Please, take your pick! I've made many hats to while away the hours of the long winters. I would be happy to trade you for others as well, if you wish!
