'''Abandoned... or Hidden Caches''' becomes available after reaching Renown 27 with the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]].

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Fishing Caches|id=388985|Unlock the ability to find Tuskarr Tackleboxes along the shores of the Dragon Isles waters.|icon=inv_pet_magicalcradadbox}}

==Completion==
Let me let you in on a little secret.

Some of our less-than-friendly neighbors are jealous of our fishing prowess--and our fishing spots.

They trespass on our fishing claims and steal our tackle boxes, stashing them along the shores to not get caught in the act. Let me tell you what to look for, and you might just be able to help yourself to some useful supplies while you're out fishing.
