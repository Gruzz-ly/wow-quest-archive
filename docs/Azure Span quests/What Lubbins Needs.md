Make sure to summon [[:Lubbins]], then use this battle-stone on him. It'll permanently make him stronger.

==Notes==
;Speaking to Patchu
:There's two kinds of [[Companion|pets]], <name>. The ones that are happiest just being your friend and following you around [[Azeroth]], and the ones that like to [[Pet battle|fight other pets]] 'cause it makes them stronger! Lubbins is that second kind of pet.

:I know that fighting seems scary but it's really just their way of playing. Nobody dies in a fight, but they can get hurt. But that's why we gotta train up pets to get stronger.

:<whispers to you> They get hurt less that way.

:You wanna try and help? Here's a magic battle-stone. This'll give Lubbins a boost and help his readiness.

:{{gossip|Thank you. I believe I understand.}}
