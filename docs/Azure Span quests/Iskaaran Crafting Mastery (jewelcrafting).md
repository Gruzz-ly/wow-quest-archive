Jewelcrafter! I am glad to see you again.

I've heard whispers that your jewelcrafting rivals that of the most talented craft masters. I wouldn't know. Both a fine gem and glass glitter to me! But what I do know is that your bravery continues to help our community. As a reward, I have gathered more notes from our craft masters to give to you.
