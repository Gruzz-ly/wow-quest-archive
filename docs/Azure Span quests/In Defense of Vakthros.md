==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Korthrox the Destroyer.jpg|Korthrox the Destroyer|One of Raszageth's lieutenants, bent on the destruction of the blue dragons.}}
Defeat Korthrox the Destroyer.
*[[Korthrox the Destroyer]] slain {{co|79.2|36.4|Azure Span}}
*Speak with [[Khadgar]] further upwards in Vakthros.

==Description==
It's time, <name>. The [[Primalist]] forces in the air are dwindling now that you've handled things on the ground.

[[Raszageth]] is calling in one of her [[lieutenant]]s to reinforce the Primalist forces, thanks to your efforts.

I need you to handle this monster while I push forward to fight Raszageth and help Khadgar.

Look for my [[magic]] during your fight. I will do what I can to aid you.

It is time for Raszageth to face the fury of the [[Dragon Aspect|Aspect]] of magic!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Windswept Gloves
|Twisted Leather Gloves
|Bramble Chain Grips
}}

You also will receive:
*[[Windborne Velocidrake: Curved Horns]]
* {{cost|53|82|96}}
* 12,250 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +150 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
We can't last much longer!

==Completion==
Good to see you adventurer. Time is of the essence!

==Notes==
On accept:
:''The mirror image silently disappears.''

Head outside. The way forward is full of fire elementals and ritual scouts, but Kalecgos comes by on a low pass and takes them all out with a breath attack:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Face the might of the Aspect of Magic!}}
:{{text|say|Raszageth|Hah! I will put an end to you and your pathetic flight!}}

Aggro Korthox:
:{{text|say|Korthrox the Destroyer|The final hour of the blue dragons is nigh!}}

No NPC support here, but Kalecgos will occasionally spawn in immunity runes:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Seek sanctuary in my runes!}}

The immunity lasts for four seconds, but the breath attack lasts longer, so get to another rune before it runs out.

Knock out Korthox:
:{{text|say|Korthrox the Destroyer|Raszageth... cannot... be... stopped...}}

Head northwest to Khadgar:
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Adventurer, you made it not a moment too soon. Raszageth is draining the tower of its energy!}}

==Progression==
{{Vakthros}}
