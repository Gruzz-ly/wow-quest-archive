==Objectives==
Collect 4 Crystal Samples in [[Gorloc Shore]].
*[[Crystal Sample]] (4)

==Description==
We might not look it this moment, but we are professionals. The [[Dragonscale Expedition|Expedition]] entrusted us with finding a clutch of rare crystals in the area--a geological survey if you will.

I'm still collecting myself after the [[gorloc]] attack. Would you be a dear and go look for these crystals? Bring samples back if you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Fieldwork is exhausting.

==Completion==
Excellent work! I'll get this to [[LOU-C Fitzcog|LOU-C]] and see what [[Geoscanner 289-07|her little contraption]] can make of it.
