==Objectives==
Weaken the portals' defenses.
* [[Primalist Portal]]s weakened (3)

==Description==
The [[Primalists]] are channeling elemental forces through those portals, energizing their entire effort and speeding the production of these suffused ingots.

Soon they will be stabilized enough to allow their elemental allies to pass through to reinforce their position.

We have to seal them before that happens or the battle may turn against us.

Take this focus and disrupt the portals' protective runes, then we can strike from above. Only together do we stand a chance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Together, <class>.

==Completion==
Excellent. That will at least stabilize the situation.

==Notes==
Look for Primalist Portals (much like the ones in [[Storm's Fury]]) and interact with them to channel a spell on them as [[Stellagosa]] uses [[Whirling Surge]] on them to destroy the portals. 

==Progression==
{{Fyrakk Assaults}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.1.0|note=Added.}}
