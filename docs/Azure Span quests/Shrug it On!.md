'''Shrug it On!''' becomes available at Renown level 22 with the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]].

==Completion==
<[[Arvik]] examines your wrist armor and grumbles in vague approval.>

Now, have you been supporting your shoulders? Many don't realize it, but proper shoulderpads are important to help redistribute the weight of your other gear. You'll have back pain later in life without it! 

<Arvik rubs his back.> 

Not to mention protecting them from falling debris. With [[dragon]]s, [[gnoll]]s, [[centaur]]s... so much flying in or getting thrown around. Not safe out there. Please, consider my gear and keep your shoulders safe.
