==Objectives==
Recover the caches of hunting supplies.
*[[Meat Curing Salts]] {{co|29.0|75.2|Kargpaw's Den}}
*[[Skinning Tools]]
*[[Hunting Game Calls]] {{co|36.4|93.2|Kargpaw's Den}}

==Description==
There was no sign of our stolen hunting supplies in the [[Big Tree Hills]]. They must be in that cave.

Keep an eye out for the supply containers, and be prepared for anything.

I would not trust the [[gnoll]]s to leave the goods unprotected.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
I'd hate for Iskaara to go hungry...

==Completion==
<Elder Poa looks approvingly at the supplies you've recovered.>

The [[Iskaara Tuskarr|Iskaara tuskarr]] will hunt again.

==Notes==
On accept of all four:
:{{text|say|Hanu|I will go with you.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|No, Hanu! I will not lose you to Kargpaw.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Our newfound friend is quite skilled. Trust in <name>.}}

The [[Hunting Game Calls]] are found in the Basket of Hunting Game Paws just inside the cave, guarded by a [[Sickly Pilferer]]:
:{{text|say|Sickly Pilferer|We have a supplies for you!}}

Further in, the [[Meat Curing Salts]] are in the Barrel of Salt. Looting it spawns in a [[Sickly Ambusher]]:
:{{text|yell|Sickly Ambusher|Supplies, <race>?}}

Finally, the [[Skinning Tools]] are in the Barrel of Skinning Tools. Another Sickly Ambusher pops out of stealth upon looting it:
:{{text|yell|Sickly Ambusher|It's a supplies!}}
