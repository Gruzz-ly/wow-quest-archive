==Objectives==
Seek out [[Lydiara Whisperfeather]] in the [[Azure Span]].

==Description==
Lydiara Whisperfeather is an [[Scholar|academic]] who recognizes the rigidity of the rules that govern [[Azeroth|our world]]. She also likes bending them.

If there is anyone who can assist in binding [[Fyr'alath]]'s power, it's her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You want to bind [[shadowflame]]? How dangerous! How daring! Let's do it.

I've been studying flora in the [[Emerald Dream (zone)|Emerald Dream]]. Studying the realm's exotic and dreamlike plants is quite distracting, but I've seen one in particular that could help us find some answers.

==Progression==
