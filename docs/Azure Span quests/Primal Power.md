==Objectives==
Use the Elemental Focus to drain elemental energy out of slain [[Primalists]] and [[elemental]]s.
*Primal energies recovered (0/100%)
*Meet Khadgar's projection further ahead in the Vakthros Range.
*[[Elemental Focus (quest item)#Usable]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm afraid it's becoming harder to maintain my mirror images. The Primalists are focusing their efforts to tearing me out from the sky.

Not to worry... I have a plan.

I need you to take the orb you recovered and gather elemental magic from slain Primalists. 

We'll need that elemental power up ahead to divert their forces away from me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
We must act quickly.

==Completion==
That orb is brimming with power! That will be perfect for what's next.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Their assaults are overwhelming... I cannot maintain the mirror images any longer!}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Kalecgos!}}
:''Kalecgos's mirror image disappears.''

Valid targets include [[Primal Lava Elemental]]s and [[Primalist Worshipper]]s. Make sure to USE the quest item on their corpses to fill the bar!

At 15%:
:{{text|say|Raszageth|Mortal fools! You fumble with arcane magic and spread its use like blight upon this world!}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|This power is meant to be studied and harnessed, not feared! You would kill those who seek to use it for the greater good?}}
:{{text|say|Raszageth|I will eradicate your insignificant kind and end your meddling with the unnatural!}}

==Progression==
{{Vakthros}}
