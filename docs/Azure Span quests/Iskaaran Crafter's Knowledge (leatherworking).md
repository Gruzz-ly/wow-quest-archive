Greetings, [[leatherworker]].

We [[tuskarr]] prize our ability to work with leather. Our culture has used skins and fur to protect us from the elements and from injury for many generations. You'll find no finer leatherwork anywhere. Because you wish to help us, we'll share our skills with you. I have here patterns and notes that will put you on the path to mastery of tuskarr leatherwork.
