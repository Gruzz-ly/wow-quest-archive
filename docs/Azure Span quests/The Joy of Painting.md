==Objectives==
Deliver Rauvros' Painting of Introduction to [[Hudson]].
*[[Painting of Introduction]] (provided)

==Description==
Do you like my collection? These are all the work of the greatest painter that ever lived, Hudson.

They're rare and probably valuable--he's a recluse and hasn't painted anything in awhile. Oh, but I'd love to meet him... Or to learn from him!

You... seem like the bold type. Would you find him for me? H-here! Take some of my work with you. Maybe he'll be impressed!

Or maybe he'll think I'm terrible... oh dear.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|7|40|50}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Completion==
What's this? A painting?

==Notes==
Travel to [[Hudson's Rock]], southwest of [[Iskaara]].
