On accept:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I have learned much in this short time on [[Dragon Isles|the isles]], friend. And there is something I must do.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|My sister, you are not forgotten to me. You never will be. But you deserve more than an eternity alone.}}
:{{text|emote|You feel a familiar presence envelope you.}}
:{{text|whisper|Tarecgosa|Kalec... my friend, tell him -- no, it can wait. It is something I must say myself.}}

:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Tarecgosa was destined for greatness, but destiny was not kind to her. After the [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]], we were betrayed by [[Arygos|one of our own]]. He chose to serve [[Deathwing]].}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|My sister threw herself in front of an attack meant for me, and suffered a mortal wound in the process. To prolong her time on [[Azeroth]], we bound her soul to a staff. One that you now have in your possession.}}
