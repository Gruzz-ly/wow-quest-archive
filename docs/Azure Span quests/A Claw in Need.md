==Objectives==
Ask [[Venderthvan]] how you can help him and do what he says.
*Speak with Venderthvan
*Artifact found {{co|45.8|25.6|Azure Span}}

==Description==
Let's see what we can do to help this guy!

<[[Heleth the Wise|Heleth]] leans in close and whispers.>

Don't worry, we aren't gonna let him take anything or stuff like that. Let's just have some fun!

It's been ages since anyone has come up here to check up on us. We're SO bored!

<Heleth winks at you.> 

Why don't you ask him what he wants?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +15 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Go ahead, <race>, do all the work for me. It will be a piece of cake to take the artifact from you when the moment is right.

==Completion==
That looks promising. Give it here. 

...what do you mean you're not going to give it to me?

==Notes==
Venderthvan, understandably confused, has some gossip:
:<Venderthvan looks around in confusion.>
:What is happening? 
:What are these kids doing up here alone? Where are their parents?
:<Venderthvan blinks at you.>
:You do realize we are not on the same side here, right?
*{{gossip|<Nod kindly and ask what you can do to help him.>}}
*{{gossip|<Smile menacingly and ask what you can do to help him.>}}
*{{gossip|<Crack your knuckles.>}}
*{{gossip|<Shrug and ask what you can do to help him.>}}

Choose any option, as it doesn't matter:
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|Okay, I get it. I was sent up here to "take care of" whatever is up here. But as far as I'm concerned, that never involved kids.}}
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|Look, Taran was going on about some artifact up here that will stabilize the wild arcana, or something. If you're going to "help", find it, I guess?}}
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|What--what are you kids even doing up here alone, anyway? It isn't safe.}}
:{{text|say|Heleth the Wise|All the adults, like our parents, have to fight the bad guys like you to get our home back in the assembly!}}
:{{text|say|Nezzie|It's not even safe in the central camp. Sometimes your friends charge there, too. But we didn't want to go far, so we promised SUPER hard to be EXTRA careful on top of this tower!}}
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|... Oh.}}

Several objects light up on the bookshelves in the area. Clockwise from the south by Heleth, they are:
;[[Gently-Bubbling Potion]]
:<The jar has bubbles in it that slowly simmer upwards and downwards like goo.>
:<It appears to be some natural alchemical reaction, and useless to you.>
;[[Pretty Jewel]]
:<It's a pretty, but completely mundane, jewel.>
;[[Stained Book]]
:<While this book appears to have been kept safely out of the reach of the children's destructive tendencies, its contents appear unhelpful, as they merely detail some pastry recipes.>
;[[A Colorful Scroll]]
:<Whatever used to be in this scroll, it is long-gone, covered by colorful scribbles and doodles.>
;[[A Dusty Jar]]
:<The jar is covered in dust, but sparkles faintly. You sense an energy humming within.>
:{{gossip|<Take the jar.>}}

Take the jar that [[Venveri]] keeps jumping to reach:
:{{text|say|Venveri|Hey! We're not supposed to touch that!}}
