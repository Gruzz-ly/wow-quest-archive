==Objectives==
Speak with [[Warpcaster Delandra]] at [[Camp Antonidas]].
*Inquire about the stones

==Description==
My hesitation to discuss these symbols was not for a lack of trust in you, but rather the unknown nature of these symbols and the stones upon which they reside.

Yes, stones. Multiple, in fact. Scattered across [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]].

<Warpcaster Delandra glances at you. A hint of curiosity and excitement glows in her eyes.>

You did not know.

Very well. Your persistence and willingness to seek me out shows that you are keen to understand your recent discovery. Perhaps it is time we discuss this at length.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I have prepared a vessel which allows one to capture and store rampant energy.

This knowledge is not known to many. It would be wise to proceed with caution.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Warpcaster Delandra
:What is it you wish to know?

:{{gossip|What can you tell me about the symbols?}}
:Not long ago, I stumbled upon these stones while studying nearby magical energies. After conducting some experiments, I came to realize these symbols were not only using the energy of a single stone, but rather a far more expansive network--an ancient means of travel.

:{{gossip|A network? Does it still work?}}
::Unfortunately these stones are long dormant. The energy that remains--that which you saw in your initial investigations--are merely remnants.

::{{gossip|What kind of energy is required for something like this?}}
:::That is a good question.

:::The amount of energy required to power such an extensive network is immense. Handled incorrectly, that same power has the potential to incite catastrophic consequences.

:::Even in my studies I was only able to apply enough energy for a brief moment before it was too much. If we are to pursue the full extent of these objects, we must proceed with caution.

:::If you agree, I will provide you the assistance required to continue. However, know that this journey may be a fruitless endeavor. On the other hand, this curiosity may in fact allow us to fully realize just how knowledgeable and powerful our predecessors on [[Dragon Isles|these isles]] truly were.

:::{{gossip|If we don't try we'll never know.}}
::::''The objective is completed.''
