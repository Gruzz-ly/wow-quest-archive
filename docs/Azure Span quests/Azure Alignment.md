'''Azure Alignment''' concludes the "Decayed Roots" chapter of the [[Azure Span storyline]]. The final chapter begins with [[Calling the Blue Dragons]].

==Objectives==
Return to [[Kalecgos]] in the [[Azure Archives]].

==Description==
The bonds of [[Iskaara|this community]]... the friendship and family they share.

I... never had that. The [[blue dragonflight]] never had that. And maybe that's because we haven't had a chance to.

Now is the time. I must gather my kind.

Meet me at the Azure Archives. There is much to be done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Completion==
I never expected to learn so much from the [[tuskarr]]. I think I'll visit when I can, and maintain those bonds of friendship.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brena|You're leaving? The celebration has only just begun!}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Thank you Brena--and everyone. I have learned more than I imagined in my short time in your company.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Despite tragedy, you all remain kind and resolute. Because of your community. Because of family.}}
:''Kalecgos resumes his dragon form.''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|The power the blue dragonflight is missing is not [[ley lines]], or ancient artifacts... it's family.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I must go to them. But if you ever have need of me, simply call. I will hear you. And I'll come as swiftly as my wings can carry me.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|It is time for the [[blue dragon]]s to once more be the guardians of this land.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|... I... I see.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Hmph. You could have said something about being a [[dragon]] from the beginning! Seems an important detail to leave out.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Well, you'd best be back any time you need a good meal. There will always be a warm bowl of soup for you here, Kalec.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I look forward to it. Take care, Brena, [[Norukk]]... everyone.}}
:''Kalecgos flies off.''
:{{text|say|Brena|And you, of course, <name>. I cannot thank you enough. I hope you will make yourself at home and know that you always have a family in Iskaara.}}
:''The gathered tuskarr all depart.''

Return to the [[Azure Oathstone]] at the Azure Archives:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I've repaired several ley lines, and our friend here helped repair a major one. Has the oathstone been repowered?}}
:{{text|say|[[Sindragosa (simulacrum)|Sindragosa]]|Some power has returned to it... but I fear something still is preventing its true power from emerging.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Perhaps it has enough power to do one small request...}}
