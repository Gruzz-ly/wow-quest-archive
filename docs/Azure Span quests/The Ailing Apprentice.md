==Objectives==
Collect 5 Frozen Venom Glands.
*[[Frozen Venom Gland]] (5)

==Description==
This mission was a mistake from the beginning. [[Alia Sunsoar]] enlisted our aid to keep the [[Sundered Flame]] from acquiring a dangerous artifact. We had tracked it down to [[Lost Ruins|these ruins]].

But the Sundered Flame beat us here and the area is infested with [[ice spider]]s. Alia was badly poisoned, and I fear she will not last long without the antidote.

I can make it, but I need venom glands from the nearby spiders. I'm afraid to leave her. Will you find some for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Do you have the venom glands I asked for?

==Completion==
Ah, wonderful! With these venom glands, I can brew an antidote for Alia. She'll be feeling better in no time at all.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Kattigat|Please hurry. Her strength is fading quickly!}}
:{{Text|say|[[To'tik]]|This place is cursed. We should cure her and leave to get reinforcements.}}
:{{Text|say|Kattigat|We've all come too far to leave now. We can stop the Sundered Flame with help from our new friend here.}}

Enter the cave and the ruins beyond and kill [[Shiverweb Crawler]]s to loot the glands.

;Returning to Kattigat
:{{Text|say|Alia Sunsoar|Must... get the artifact... before... them...}}
