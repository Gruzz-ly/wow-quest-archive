Turns out there's [[magic]]al art in these ruins. And we can see it!

<[[Apprentice Scrumpy|Scrumpy]] proudly sticks out his chest.>

I can show you how to see 'em too! Just... don't tell [[Noriko the All-Remembering|Noriko]] yet.

==Progress==
Noriko told us to stay out of trouble. Not sure how to do that to be honest.

[[Malygos]] and [[Sindragosa]], huh? Never heard of 'em. Sounds like they were pretty in love though.

I wonder who put these here?

Click on [[Lingering Image]]s at the locations. Near the two vulpera:
:Hark! Dear one!

:You who stand whence magic sprung, where [[titan]]s' children play.

:This is the song everlasting that sings of love eternal in a time before.

:A time of long rebirth.

:A time of loneliness for the eldest son, most loved Malygos, beloved ere begotten in mind and spirit by [[Norgannon]], [[aesir]]-born. 

:From him, platinum clad, did Malygos build these great works. 

:Behold them and rejoice, O' dearly beloved.

:{{Gossip|Close your eyes and listen.}}

Inside [[Mage's Rest]]:
:Hark! Dear one! You who stand whence duty strove, where knowledge freely lives.

:These are the works undying that build cool tempered understanding for she who knows no equal nor master still.

:Sindragosa.

:Illuminated by transcendent intellect; [[arcana]] unfettered, beauty everlasting.

:In her wings the firmament finds itself transformed, the colors run betwixt lilting lines of autumn streams.

:Some run fierce as hot mana burns.

:{{Gossip|Close your eyes and listen.}}

Inside the workshop:
:Hark! Dear one! You who stand whence true love fell off the page like so many words.

:These are the breaths unfading, uttered betwixt sighs of creation arcane;

:In books did twin souls reside, their crackling spines lit with lines of magic.

:He the first steward of knowledge, and she his muse in mind and deed.

:Side by side were they joined, kept atop these icy calving shelves with bookends opalescent and grey.

:These painted halls awash in blue.

:{{Gossip|Close your eyes and listen.}}

At the pavilion:
:Hark! Dear one! You who stand whence all was freely shared, where greed nor hubris live.

:Long may you stay in love's conquered breast, born aloft on wings of knowledge teal.

:This is the song of that mirror blue.

:The image azure incarnate.

:You who stand here remember those whose love made magic manifest, whose power begot flight and fierce aspect in their azure brethren.

:Sing now of these great works, beloved.

:Malygos and Sindragosa.

:Two hearts that time nor distance dims.

:<You can barely make out a faded signature, "[[Divo Songscale]]".>

:{{Gossip|Close your eyes and listen.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Scrumpy|Fine, I'll say it. You should probably tell Noriko about this.}}
