==Objectives==
Assist [[Sonova Snowden|Sonova's]] translation.
*Translation witnessed

==Description==
Aye, sounds like a right mess up there--like a storm blew through and wrecked the whole place. I can see why they'd be up in arms, but why attack us?

This would be a lot easier if we could just talk it out, but the [[Winterpelt tribe|Winterpelt]] are famously tight-lipped and don't seem to speak any of the common branches of [[Furbolg (language)|Furbolg-ish]]. Furbolgian? Eh, ye know what I mean.

I don't suppose ya happened to have a nice chat with any of 'em while ye were checking in on them, did ye?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Winterpelt Furbolg]]

==Progress==
Are ye even listenin'?

==Completion==
Now to translate this mess...

==Notes==
Speak with Sonova again:
:Ya said the Winterpelt were shouting things? That could be the key to unlocking this whole mystery! 

:Could ya repeat what ya heard?
:{{gossip|<Repeat the growling furbolg sounds as best you're able.>}} (''skip to "gGch" or a "Ggch"'')
:{{gossip|<Roar loudly while lifting your arms in mimicry of a bear.>}} (''skip to "gGch" or a "Ggch"'')
:{{gossip|What? Do I look like a linguist to you?}}
::No, ya don't. But I do. Me family's been studying furbolg languages fer generations.

::Now, are ya ready to give this a try?

::{{gossip|I am. <Growl out the furbolg as best you can.>}}
::{{gossip|If there's no other way. <Begrudgingly snarl out the unfamiliar syllables.>}}
::{{gossip|<Give a toothy grin around the low, rumbling sounds you mimic.>}}
:::Yes. Mhmm. Was that with a "gGch" or a "Ggch" at the end, there?

:::{{gossip|GraagGch. Definitely.}}
:::{{gossip|GraaGgch. With a downward inflection.}}
:::{{gossip|<Growl uncertainly.>}}
::::Right. Go on.

::::{{gossip|<Recreate what you heard to the best of your ability.>}}
::::{{gossip|<Swipe at the air while growling.>}}
::::{{gossip|Grar?}}
:::::Ah, yes. Indeed. And how deep in the throat was that last one?

:::::{{gossip|<Growl from the back of your throat.>}}
:::::{{gossip|<Rumble from deep within, engaging your diaphragm.>}}
:::::{{gossip|Like choking on a salmon.}}
::::::That deep, you say? Interesting. Do keep going.

::::::{{gossip|<Imitate the rumbling vocalizations of the Winterpelt.>}}
::::::{{gossip|<Roar and snap your teeth at Sonova.>}}
::::::{{gossip|Imagine a bear yelling at you to get off its lawn while chewing on a log. It was like that.}}
:::::::Mhm. I see. And the grinding was all in the molars?

:::::::{{gossip|All the way in the back, yes.}}
:::::::{{gossip|<Gnash your teeth and growl.>}}
:::::::{{gossip|Wait, do bears even have molars?}}
:{{text|say|Sonova Snowden|Aha! That'll do it!}}
