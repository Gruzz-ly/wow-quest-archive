*[[Dormant Embercone]] (12)
*Return to [[Custodian Vernagos]] iin [[Camp Antonidas]].

==Description==
If you're looking for an instructor, I'm sorry to say I... Ah, you're not an apprentice! My apologies. Allow me to introduce myself.

I am Custodian Vernagos, one of the caretakers of these ruins. More specifically, the task of restoring this workspace to its former glory has fallen upon my very tired shoulders.

Would you be able to lend a hand? All the reagents I need are nearby: [[ice elemental]] cores, embercones, hornswog leather...

Fairly standard, easily gathered stuff. What say you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*+100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Fresh air and [[magic]]al relics. What more could one ask for? Ha!

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. The embercones will burn hot. The [[elemental]] cores will temper the heat. And this leather... is fairly disgusting. But the bellows they produce will more than suffice!

Now all I need is time.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Custodian Vernagos|By the [[Titan]]s! [[Mysterious Forge|This old thing]] sure clings to its secrets...}}

Dormant Embercones are found around the camp, Hornswog Hide Scraps drop from [[Encroaching Hornswog]]s, and Frozen Core drop from [[Calving Elemental]]s.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Custodian Vernagos|Let's start by tossing a couple embercones in there...}}
:{{Text|say|Custodian Vernagos|[[Dragon Aspects|Aspects]] be praised, it worked!}}
:{{Text|say|Custodian Vernagos|It will take me some time to forge the bellows and restore the rest of the workshop, but this is a fine start!}}
