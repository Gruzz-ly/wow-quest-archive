==Objectives==
Empower Azure Defenders in [[Camp Antonidas]].
*[[Azure Defender]] Empowered (6)
*[[Arch Instructor's Wand]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Custodian Cynegos]] and I were just discussing the impact the [[Primalist]] attack has had on the plans to assault the [[Cobalt Assembly]], and I had an idea.

<Celeste withdraws a wand from the folds of her robes.>

Take my wand and empower their weapons!

A little bit of fire should do the trick...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Have they been sufficiently enchanted?

==Completion==
Fantastic job!

After repelling their attack on the camp, it's imperative that we keep the Primalists on the back foot.

Now please give me my wand back.
