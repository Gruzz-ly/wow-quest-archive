==Objectives==
Destroy 10 Infected Corpses with the Flamethrower Torch.
*[[Infected Plunderer (Azure Span)|Infected Plunderers]] burned (10)
*[[Flamethrower Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Ice spider|These vile spiders]] lay their eggs in [[corpse]]s.

And sometimes the living.

We've seen several bodies of [[Sundered Flame]] who have fallen victim to them.

We can't let those eggs hatch if we want to survive here and defeat the Sundered Flame.

Take this torch. It is imbued with the power of air and fire. Point it in the direction of what you want scorched, and it will do the rest.

The [[Tuskarr]] don't mess around with spiders. I came prepared.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progresss==
It's a dirty job, and I guess you're doing it.

==Completion==
Good work. This should give us some breathing room.

==Notes==
Enter the cave and use the Flamethrower Torch on the corpses of Infected Plunderer to burn them.

==Progression==
{{Lost Ruins}}
