==Objectives==
Speak with Senegos one last time.
*Speak with [[Senegos]] one last time
*Speak with [[Kalecgos]] within the [[Azure Archives]].

==Description==
It brightens my heart to see everyone reunited, and [[Malygos]] and [[Sindragosa]] at peace at long last.

It is time that I give you all one last gift, something the [[blue dragon]]s have not seen in quite some time.

The peaceful passing of one of their own.

It is my time, <name>. I should have flown beyond some time ago, but I could not leave with my kin still in disarray.

Would you do an old [[dragon]] the honor of seeing me off on one last adventure?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|56|18}}
*[[Ensemble: Azure Renewal Finery]] (first time completing)
*[[Azure Flightstone]] (alts)
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
Senegos... what a tremendous gift he's given to us all. 

Thank you, <name>. I don't know if I could have united the blue dragons without you--and for that I will be forever grateful.

It's time for me to lead everyone forward.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Senegos
:I have been waiting for this moment for quite a long time.

:The blue dragons are together again. Sindragosa and Malygos's legacies have been put to rest, and my children's children can once again experience the beauty of the [[Dragon Isles]].

:It is time for me to rest, <name>. There are many dragons waiting for me... and many who I have sorely missed every day of this long life of mine.

:{{Gossip|quest=|Goodbye, Senegos.}}

:{{Gossip|You don't have to go, Senegos. I can figure out a way to save you.}}
::I'm sure you could find some ancient artifact that would grant me another thousand years or reverse my age. I know because I've found several! How do you think I've lasted this long?

::I made a promise to my daughter, [[Stellagosa]]'s mother, when she was killed. I told her I would look after Stellagosa and the others until [[Blue dragonflight|our flight]] was renewed.

::There are many things I've done to artificially extend my life. I should have passed some time ago... but I could not leave [[Azurewing|my brood]] alone.

::There is nothing I need to be "saved" from, <name>. It has been my time for a while. I finally get to rest and accept it.

::{{Gossip|quest=|Goodbye, Senegos.}}
::A cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|i2zILzoZtLw}}
::''Stellagosa approaches Senegos.''
::{{Text|say|Stellagosa|Grandfather?}}
::{{Text|say|Senegos|Ah... no tears, my dear.}}
::{{Text|say|Senegos|A life as full as mine should be celebrated, not mourned.}}
::{{Text|say|Senegos|It is up to you to lead the Azurewing now.}}
::{{Text|say|Stellagosa|You cannot go -- I am not ready!}}
::{{Text|say|Senegos|We rarely are, my dear starlight.}}
::{{Text|say|Senegos|Carry my lessons close to your heart, and I will never be far from you.}}
::''Emmigosa joins Stellagosa. The present dragons all watch as Senegos ascends to the power nexus at the center of the Archives, his body dissipates, and leaves only sparks, that fall below on the dragons. Kalec in his visage approaches Stellagosa.''

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|It... it is hard to believe he's really gone. What do we do now?}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|We strengthen the bonds of our flight that remain by celebrating those who came before. Senegos, Sindragosa, Malygos... all those we've lost.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|You are all welcome to stay in the Archives for as long as you need. This is our new home.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Azuregos]]|I suppose it is a bit bigger than the [[Nexus]]. [[Azure Vault|The vaults]] seem to have more knowledge that I haven't recorded yet.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Surigosa]]|I can help you look after the Nexus if you want to start to come here.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Zeros]]|Me too! I bet you old Malygos had a few ideas on how to play the market back in his day.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Haleh]]|Let us just... make sure someone always accompanies Zeros to the Nexus.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Lanigosa]]|Azuregos, I shall join you in studying the vaults. I have a few things I am curious about...}}
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|I suppose company in my studies would be a change of pace.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|I will be here whenever any of you have need of me.}}

For an extra bit of lore, head back to the [[Veiled Ossuary]], where [[Stellagosa]] and [[Emmigosa]] are updating the [[Faded Gravestone]].

For characters with [[Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest]], Kalecgos starts a new questline, starting with [[Tarecgosa's Rest (quest)]].
