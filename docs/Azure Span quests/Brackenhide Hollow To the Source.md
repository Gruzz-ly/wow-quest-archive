==Objectives==
Enter Brackenhide Hollow and confront [[Decatriarch Wratheye]].
*[[Decay]] source slain

==Description==
We cannot thank you enough for your aid pushing back the [[Brackenhide]] [[gnoll]]s.

But they continue to gather, using their foul decay [[magic]] from some source deep within [[Brackenhide Hollow]]. Worse, we have not heard from the [[tuskarr]] in that area for weeks, now.

I fear something terrible is happening there. We must protect our home. Please, gather your forces, find our people, and see what you can do about the decay!
