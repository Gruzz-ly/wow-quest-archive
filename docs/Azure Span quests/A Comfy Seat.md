'''A Comfy Seat''' becomes available after reaching Renown 23 with the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]].

==Completion==
After a long day's work, it's good to relax. I've come up with a comfortable cushion to aid with that. It's very cozy!

Would you like one? I'll gladly make one for you if you can bring me the materials to craft it!
