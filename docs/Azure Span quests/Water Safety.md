==Objectives==
Bring three water samples to [[Manny Read]].
*Waterfall samples collected (3)
*[[Water Testing Flask]] (provided)

==Description==
My greatest responsibility is to make sure everyone has access to clean drinking water.

With the [[gnoll]]s to the east dealing with the [[decay]], I must make sure that the camp is safe.

I don't want to alarm anyone by personally taking samples, but I feel testing is necessary.

Bring me samples from the three nearby waterfalls, and I will reward you handsomely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
I have the test kits ready for when you have the samples.

==Completion==
A deep wyrm?

Something must have driven it away from its underground nest. Whatever spooked this apex predator must have been very terrible indeed.

Thank you, <name>, I will remove the carcass so it doesn't contaminate the water.

==Notes==
Find the waterfalls and use the quest item at {{Co|19.39|23.94|Azure Span}}, {{Co|20.01|24.19|Azure Span}}, and {{Co|17.30|23.20|Azure Span}}. The last location has [[Deep Wyrm Larvae]] around and spawns a [[Deep Wyrm]] after collecting a water sample.

==Progression==
{{Three-Falls Lookout}}
