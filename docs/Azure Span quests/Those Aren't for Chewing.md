==Objectives==
Recover 8 Funerary Offerings.
*[[Funerary Offering]] (8)
*Meet [[Hanu]] at the entrance to [[Kargpaw's Den]] in the [[Big Tree Hills]].

==Description==
I found one of [[Ponoliak]]'s funerary offerings, mishandled and then discarded by these [[Shadepaw]] [[gnoll]]s... It has bite marks all over it!

This offering, and others like it, are needed for the memorial ceremony for the recently deceased [[Iskaara]] [[chieftain]].

It's a travesty that something so sacred should be employed as a chew toy. Please keep an eye out for more offerings.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
<Hanu leans forward and gazes into your pack hopefully.>

==Completion==
<Hanu's nose crinkles.>

Ugh... slathered in slobber.

They will have to suffice for the chieftain's memorial.

==Notes and trivia==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Brena|Be on your guard. There's nothing so cunning and cruel as a Shadepaw gnoll.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Poa|[[Troll]]? There are no trolls here!}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Err... of course, Elder.}}

Any non-named gnoll or hyena in the [[Big Tree Hills]] can drop a [[Funerary Offering]], including: [[Scavenging Hyena]]s, [[Shadepaw Bandit]]s, [[Shadepaw Bruiser]]s, [[Shadepaw Hunter]]s, [[Shadepaw Skulker]]s, [[Shadepaw Trainer]]s, and [[Trained Hyena]]s.

The actual items that drop include [[Beaded Feather Band]], [[Carved Stone Whale]], [[Engraved Tusk]], and [[Fragmented Tuskarr Effigy]].

On completion of all three, [[Brena]] and [[Elder Poa]] run up:
:{{text|say|Hanu|Brena! You came...}}
:{{text|say|Brena|I see you've been busy.}}
:{{text|say|Hanu|Norukk and the others... they're in the den.}}
:{{text|say|Hanu|Kargpaw is in there... and all these sickly gnolls!}}
:{{text|say|Elder Poa|Slow down, Hanu!}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Tell me everything.}}
