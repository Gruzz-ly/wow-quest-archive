==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Mysterious Apparition.jpg|Mysterious Apparition|Whatever the reason, there are always better and smarter decisions than stealing.}}
Find the [[Drakonid|draconid]]{{sic}} [[ghost]] and retrieve the legendary card.
*Legendary foil card returned.

==Description==
Last night, I was lying in my bedroll, tossing and turning, when an unnatural chill filled the inn.

Then, out of nowhere I saw... the ghost of a draconid{{sic}}! It went through my luggage then vanished into thin air!

But the true horror is that when I woke up... the ghost had taken my most beloved card!

Would you be so kind as to track down the ghost and get my card back? It is my most prized possession.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*9,800 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Please, you have to find my legendary card! It was a family heirloom given to me as a young cub. It means the world to me!

==Completion==
The apparition explained itself and asked for forgiveness.

But then they asked to play a single match with me.

Our game is apparently very different from what they used to play, and they wanted to try it.

Thank you for helping both of us. Maybe the match will be fun?

==Notes==

Head to the ruined tower at {{Co|17.32|26.08|Azure Span}} and attack the [[Mysterious Apparition]]:

:{{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|Stop! I yield! I will return the card myself.}}
:''The apparition turns {{Rep|friendly}} and runs away.''

Return to the Missing Hinge Inn:

:{{Text|say|Guo-Hee Calmwater|Please, don't take my other cards!}}
:{{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|Have no fear, mortal. I came to apologize for my actions.}}
:{{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|Here is your card.}}
:{{Text|say|Guo-Hee Calmwater|I... thank you.}}
:{{Text|say|Willa Stronghinge|And they say an innkeeper's life is boring...}}
