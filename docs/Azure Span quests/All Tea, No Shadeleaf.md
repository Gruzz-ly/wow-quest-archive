'''All Tea, No Shadeleaf''' is available at the [[Ruby Feast]] in [[Valdrakken]] when [[Alchemist Flemthroat]] is the chef of the day.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lilial Dawnburst]] in [[Shiverweb Vale]].

==Description==
Today is a celebration of tea - brewed, iced, and otherwise! Extravagant little cakes and biscuits too.

But there is a rare ingredient of the [[Dragon Isles|Isles]] I feel could add a whole new dimension of flavor! Deep within the crawler-infested domain of the Shiverweb Vale is a bush laden with the most wondrously uplifting leaf: [[:Coldsnap Sagittate]].

The [[Dragonscale Expedition]] was exploring that area recently. Perhaps one of them could assist?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|2|25}}
* 2,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A "Coldsnap Sagittate"? Hmm...

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|[[Alchemist Flemthroat]]|Chef Rumi, did you know that the [[undead]] experience very little taste when eating?}}
:{{text|say|[[Rumiastrasza]]|I had no idea, Flemthroat! How then did you achieve such precise culinary instincts?}}
:{{text|say|Alchemist Flemthroat|Though they've rotted beyond tasting, these tongues of ours have become accustomed to the textures and sensations of food. That is why teas are such a delight to us!}}

==Progression==
{{The Ruby Feast}}
