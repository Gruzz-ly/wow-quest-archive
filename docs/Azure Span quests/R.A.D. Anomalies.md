==Objectives==
Use the R.A.D. to dispel three arcane anomalies.
*[[Unknown Arcane Anomaly|Anomalies]] Recorded (3)
*[[R.A.D.]] (provided)

==Description==
There is a LOT of [[arcane]] energy here...

But! The R.A.D. can help with that! It's an awesome device--it's right in the name: "Rannan's Awesome Device!" It detects AND dispels arcane energy.

Here... hold it! Do you feel the POWER in your hands? No?

Well, now that you've got it, take it and dispel those anomalies!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|20|18|61}}
* 5,900 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Go! Go! That arcane energy is not going to dispel itself.

==Completion==
Hm... You dispelled the anomalies, but the R.A.D. still detects an arcane surge... and it's rising by the minute.

That... can't be a good thing.

==Notes==
Look for purple orbs and use the quest item.
