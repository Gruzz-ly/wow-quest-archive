'''Urgent Action Required''' concludes the "Tuskarr Troubles" portion of the [[Azure Span storyline]]. The campaign continues with [[Breaching the Brackenhide]]. 

==Objectives==
Meet [[Brena]] at [[Brackenhide Hollow|Brackenhide]].

==Description==
The source of these attacks must be the Brackenhide.

We've fought with the Brackenhide [[gnoll]]s for generations, but until now they've been nothing more than a nuisance.

We have no choice but to take urgent action against the gnolls. Their foul [[decay]] will destroy the [[Azure Span]], including whatever you're searching for.

Meet us outside Brackenhide. We will need all the help we can get.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of these rewards:
|Windswept Wraps
|Twisted Leather Bindings
|Bramble Chain Bracers
|Sleet Shined Armguards
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|69|15}}
* 1,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Just standing here, I can feel the dread of this forest wash over me. Something is deeply wrong here. 

I'm beginning to regret sending our best fighter back to [[Iskaara]].

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brena|[[Norukk]] and I will find a safe location near Brackenhide. [[Hanu]], please guard the caravan the rest of the way to Iskaara.}}
:{{text|say|Hanu|You need my protection more.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|No, your children do. All of Iskaara does, if we are unable to contain this decay. Go home and get yourself a bowl of soup. Rest.}}
:{{text|say|Norukk|Give the children my love, Hanu.}}
:{{text|say|Hanu|... Fine. Be safe.}}
:''The tuskarr move out.''

Follow the road west, just past the crossroads at the [[Ancient Outlook]] to catch up with Brena and Norukk outside the [[Brackenhide Outskirts]]:
:{{text|say|Brena|I can smell the rot on the wind.}}

On complete:
:''A mirror image of [[Kalecgos]] teleports in:''
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Somewhere around here...}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Ah, <name>, what a pleasant surprise! And you've made some new friends, I see. Greetings!}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I am Kalecgos, and I am searching for ley crystal caves. I believe I sense one nearby, and yet...}}
:{{text|say|Brena|[[Ley lines]]? There is a Gleamcove deep within Brackenhide, yes, but the gnolls have made this forest thick with decay.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Decay?! Could it have eaten at the ley line itself? This is dire, indeed!}}
