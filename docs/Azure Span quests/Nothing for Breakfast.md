==Objectives==
Collect meat from the [[vorquin]] striders and striped [[bruffalon]] south of [[Three-Falls Lookout]].
*[[Vorquin Meat]] (8)
*[[Moose Flank]] (3)

==Description==
My brother [[Valdo Stronghinge|Valdo]] was supposed to order more supplies. But it's been a week and nothing has come.

I'm not surprised. The lazy oaf probably took a nap instead! Now we're short on food, and I'm too busy to hunt on top of my chores--and Valdo's!

Would you hunt for us? The meat of the vorquin striders and striped bruffalon south of here would keep the kitchen open until I can order supplies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*9,800 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Did you get some vorquin meat? Any bruffalon flanks? Great! I was ready to put fillet of boot on the menu...

==Completion==
Thanks to you--and no thanks to Valdo--I can feed all these hungry travelers!

Hmm... are you looking for a job? I've got a recent "opening"...

Can't pay you much, but you can have Valdo's spot! No? Ah well, can't blame me for trying.
