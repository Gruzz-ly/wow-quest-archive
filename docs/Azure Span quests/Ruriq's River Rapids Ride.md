==Objectives==
Ride the Fallstrider down the river.
*[[Minorrow|Fish]] caught on [[The Fallstrider]] (10)

==Description==
I did not expect [[Kauj|my brother]]'s approval... but it is welcome, all the same.

The time has come! Let's see if our hard work has paid off!

Join me in The Fallstrider, <name>, and we shall take off down the river, catching fish for [[Iskaara]] as we go!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

{{itembox|You will also receive one of the following:

}}

==Progress==
With all of our hard work together, I'm certain our trip will be successful.

==Completion==
Phew, what a ride! It's a miracle the boat is in one piece!

Thank you very much, <name>. Let us meet again for another ride!

In case you want to repeat it for the [[River Rapids Wrangler]] achievement, speak with Ruriq again:

Do you need a lift to the top?
