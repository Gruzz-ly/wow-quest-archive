==Objectives==
Collect On'tuq Hide Scraps and On'tuq Tusks from fallen [[On'tuq Mammoth]]s near the [[Kauriq Gleamlet]].
*[[On'tuq Hide Scraps]] (7)
*[[On'tuq Tusk]] (5)
*Meet [[Ruriq]] at Kauriq Gleamlet.

==Description==
[[Kauriq tribe|Our tribe]] has proudly nurtured the On'tuq [[mammoth]] herd for generations. Now they're... gone. 

Their [[soul]]s will linger in rage, after such a massacre. We must honor their lives by making good use of their remains.

There's too many for us to gather alone. Please, gather what materials you can from the youngsters and matriarchs, then meet me in the Kauriq Gleamlet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
My children had already picked out calves to foster into companions. How will I tell them?

==Completion==
With these remains, I think we can make something truly special... something that will put the souls of the mammoths at ease.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{Text|say|Kauj|We're too late to save the mammoths. We must honor their remains before they're consumed.}}
:{{Text|say|Ruriq|Look, a stranger approaches! Perhaps they've the extra muscle we need.}}

Upon acceptance of both quests:
:''Ruriq approaches [[Kauj]].''
:{{Text|say|Kauj|We'll need a massive offering to calm the mammoth spirits.}}
:{{Text|say|Ruriq|I have an idea. In the Tale of the Gleamfisher, [[Kauriq the Gleamfisher|Kauriq]] built a boat to bring Gleamfish to [[Iskaara]] during famine.}}
:{{Text|say|Ruriq|With Iskaara and [[Imbu]] in danger again, we could please the mammoth spirits by using their remains to craft such a boat once more!}}
:{{Text|say|Kauj|That journey killed Kauriq! No, brother.}}
:''Kauj and [[Kauriq Fisher]]s start walking away.''
:{{Text|emote|Ruriq sighs heavily.}}
:''After a while, Ruriq follows suit.''

Click on [[On'tuq Mammoth Matriarch]] and [[On'tuq Mammoth]]s to gather the material.
