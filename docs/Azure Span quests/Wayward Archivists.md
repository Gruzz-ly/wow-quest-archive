==Objectives==
Meet [[Sindragosa (simulacrum)|Sindragosa]] in the upper archive in the [[Azure Archives]].

==Description==
You, [[dracthyr]]. 

Two of your kin have been searching the archives just south of here. I have yet to introduce myself, and would appreciate the company.

If you have the time, I can meet you in the upper archive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|6|72|87}}
* 1,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You are a very jumpy bunch.

==Notes==
Head to the platform at {{Co|41.93|63.42|Azure Span}}. Inside the chamber are [[Telash Greywing]] and [[Scalecommander Emberthal]].
