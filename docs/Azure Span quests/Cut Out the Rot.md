==Objectives==
Kill 5 Rotting Treants and 10 Brackenhide Rotflingers.
*[[Rotting Treant]] slain (5)
*[[Brackenhide Rotflinger]] slain (10)

==Description==
This [[decay]] must have rotted these [[gnoll]]s' brains as well as their bodies!

Destructive as they are, gnolls are native to this land--just like us.

But we already saw them spreading decay to the [[Big Tree tribe|Big Tree Tribe]]. At this rate, they'll consume [[Azure Span|the Span]] and destroy themselves.

We can't let this happen. It's a shame... but put an end to them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Er, please, do tell... Did you see any interesting effects of the decay on any gnolls you observed? The effect on their social structure must be enormous...

Ah, we should stay on task.

==Completion==
Gnolls can be fascinating creatures! They're not evil, only wild. And very dumb.

Killing them is a shame, but the decay helps no one. And we can't let them hurt our family.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I'm so sorry to see tuskarr have been captured and killed here. If only I'd arrived sooner...}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Thank you for your kindness. Decay is part of the natural cycle--we all return to the earth. But this... this is a perversion.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|The souls of my kin sense the wrongdoing and linger. We must help them! My totem will reach their spirits. I only hope it is enough to calm them.}}

[[Kalecgos]] is still teleporting in to help out. Use this time to finish off the bonus objective [[Stop the Spread]]!
