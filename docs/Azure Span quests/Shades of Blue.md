==Objectives==
Accompany [[Emberthal]] and [[Telash Greywing|Telash]] to [[Camp Antonidas]].

==Description==
You there, <name>!<br>
It's good to see a friendly face in these parts. Telash and I were just discussing reports we've heard of... newcomers, in the area.

<Emberthal lowers her voice.>

[[Blue dragon]]s.

Given our... history, with the blues, Telash and I thought it necessary to assess the situation ourselves.

Please, join us.

==Progress==
Keep your head clear and your wings ready, my friend.

==Completion==
No sign of blue dragons yet, but plenty of their underlings.
