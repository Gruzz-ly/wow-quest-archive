==Objectives==
Collect the Head of Shadeisethal.
*[[Head of Shadeisethal]] (provided)

==Description==
<[[Fyrakk]]'s disciple has fallen. Perhaps the remains of this beast will bring some comfort to those whose land has been ravaged.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Drake's Shadowflame Crest]]
* {{cost|386|10}}
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
That was a lot of fire. So many people burned.

==Completion==
This thing was so angry. Rage and fury festering for eons before my people first sailed the seas. I cannot even imagine that depth of hate.

You have put it to rest. I thank you, <name>, on behalf of all of those whose lives you have saved by slaying this beast.
