==Objectives==
Speak with [[Wayun]] in [[Whaler's Nook]] of the [[Azure Span]].

==Description==
The smell of the sea! Do you smell it, <name>? Do you smell the multitude of minerals, laden with thick sea salt? Do you??

Suspiciously absent from the delights here today is a rare variety of fish I once tasted near the [[Iskaara Tuskarr|Iskaara]]'s home in Azure Span. Two [[Tuskarr]] fellows were simply roasting one over a fire, and it filled that glacial tundra with the most savory aroma!

See if you can not find one for us. I know our patrons will be just as ensorcelled by the sea's flavor as I was that day.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|2|25}}
* 2,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Please tell me you aren't here with that Ironjaw fellow. We had enough gorloc troubles before he showed up...

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Chef Coldgale]]|I've heard tale of the Tuskarr, but I've never the pleasure to entreat with them here or in [[Northrend]]. Can you tell me what they're like?}}
:{{Text|say|Rumiastrasza|They are a truly incredible and resilient people with a deeper respect for the seas that any others I have come to know. I believe you could find much in common with them, Chef.}}
:{{Text|say|Chef Coldgale|I'd be most honored to meet with them. Their skills with fish are told far and wide, even amongst the [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]].}}
