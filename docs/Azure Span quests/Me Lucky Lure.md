==Objectives==
Recover [[Captain Haab]]'s Lucky Lure.
*[[Captain Haab's Lucky Lure]]

==Description==
Ya find me in a low place, <race>, and it's not because I'm dead.

I died on the hunt, making sure the beast that killed me crew wouldn't live to kill again. There's nothing wrong with that, it's what me Pa would have wanted.

No, the problem is that the fight was a draw!

The beast's spirit is still out there, as sure as I stand here before ya. But, being a [[ghost]], I can't even reclaim me lucky lure from the [[critter]]s that picked me body clean to have another go!

Would ya mind helping me out?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
No, I don't know which one ate it. I was busy being dead at the time.

==Completion==
No fish can resist me lucky lure, living or dead!

==Notes==
Kill [[Crusty Seawing]]s or [[Scavenging Snipshell]]s (which are level {{Level|df-max}}) to obtain the lure.
