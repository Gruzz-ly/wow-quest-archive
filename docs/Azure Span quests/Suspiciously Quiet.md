==Description==
Can you spare a minute, <name>? I haven't heard from my two apprentices, [[Apprentice Scrumpy|Scrumpy]] and [[Apprentice Tucky|Tucky]], in some time. 

This is concerning. 

I sent them to fetch us supplies for [[Mage's Rest|the inn]]. They couldn't have strayed too far...

Please find them, but I warn you... They're... quite the handful.
