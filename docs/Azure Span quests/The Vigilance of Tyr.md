==Objectives==
Recover the fragments of the stone.
* [[Magnetized Splinter]] (6)
* [[Agitated Fragment]] (4)
* [[Tarasek Pillaged Piece]] (2)
* [[Far-Flung Fragment]] {{co|55.0|49.7|Azure Span}}
* [[Half Swallowed Sliver]] {{co|53.6|49.5|Azure Span}}

==Description==
Bodies, broken gear, uncontrolled [[titan]] energy. What a disregard for safety, and... and protocol! It looks like they found the stone and it was unstable, bursting into pieces.

Fortunately, I'm particularly adept at repairing magical devices.

But before I can reform the stone we need to collect each and every piece.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I can't believe it. It's all here! Well done.

==Completion==
I'll head back to basecamp and have my people reconstruct this stone. Don't worry <name>, artifact restoration is our specialty.

==Notes==
Take chip shots at the elite [[Crystallized Horror (Azure Span)|Crystallized Horror]] to spawn [[Agitated Shard]]s (who each drop an [[Agitated Fragment]]) and [[Magnetized Splinter]] objects. The horror is strictly passive and will not attack.

A [[Tarasek Pillaged Piece]] rarely drops from the [[Tarasek Scavenger (Azure Span)|Tarasek Scavengers]] in the area.

The [[Far-Flung Fragment]] is at {{co|55.0|49.7|Azure Span}} atop the tower.

The [[Obstructed Hornswog]] at {{co|53.6|49.5|Azure Span}} to the northwest has half-swallowed a [[tarasek]]. Approach:
:{{text|say|Obstructed Hornswog|Is somebody there? Help!}}

Aggro:
:{{text|say|Obstructed Hornswog|Oh no, what's happening?!}}

Defeat it, then interact with the spit-out tarasek for the [[Half Swallowed Sliver]].

:{{text|say|Tarasek Hauler|Here, take this! But please don't hurt me.}}

;On complete
:{{Text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|And we're one step closer to a new discovery. I'll meet you at the next site, <name>.}}
:''Naleidea teleports away.''

Complete the other forks of the storyline to continue.
