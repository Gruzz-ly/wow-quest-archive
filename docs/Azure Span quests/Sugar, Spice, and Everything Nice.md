==Description==
There! Now I have all I need for Sylvie!

And just in time. I doubt she would have lasted much longer like this.

But... I need someone to help me. I'd ask Cally but... would you mind assisting me again?

Let me know when or if you're ready, <name>.

I've healed her, but she is clearly still in distress.

Hm, I wonder if...

==Notes==
;Speaking with Steria
:Are you ready to start, <name>?

:{{Gossip|I'm ready to begin.}}

Interact with [[Steria's Mortar and Pestle]].

:''Sylvie howls and shakes.''
:{{Text|say|Steria Duskgrove|Whoa there! It's okay! It's not going to hurt, I promise!}}
:{{Text|say|Callisto Windsor|Steria, you're going to hurt yourself.}}
:{{Text|say|Steria Duskgrove|Don't worry! I just need your help holding her still.}}
:{{Text|say|Callisto Windsor|What will I tell the [[Kirin Tor]] if you get mauled by a [[slyvern]] you weren't supposed to be treating?}}

Speak to Callisto:
:Surely you two can manage on your own...

:{{Gossip|Steria needs your help.}}
:{{Gossip|Don't be a coward! Go help her.}}
:{{Text|say|Callisto Windsor|Fine, but if I get my face eaten and we lose our jobs, it's your fault.}}
:{{Text|say|Steria Duskgrove|I promise everything will be fine, my love.}}
:{{Text|say|Callisto Windsor|You know I'd do anything for you, Steria. I'm just worried about our research.}}
:''Callisto approaches Sylvie.''

Interact with Sylvie:
:{{Gossip|<Administer medicine.>}}

:{{Text|emote|As soon as the [[arcane]] illness fades away, the slyvern yips and howls urgently.}}
:{{Text|say|Callisto Windsor|A-AH! It's attacking me!}}
:{{Text|say|Steria Duskgrove|It's alright, Cally! She's just happy to be healed.}}
:{{Text|say|Steria Duskgrove|Wait no, that's not it... She seems worried...}}

Callisto has special gossip:
:I-I was sure it was going to bite me...

So does Steria:
:I'm glad Cally finally lent a hand... even if she didn't agree with my methods.

:We've always made a good team... I hope we always will.
