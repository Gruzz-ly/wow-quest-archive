==Description==
It is no wonder your companions have yet to find anything.

These books were meant for blue eyes only.

However, my presence should suffice in allowing for some of the more pertinent tomes to divulge their secrets.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found that which you seek?

==Completion==
You have the answers you seek, yet you do not look content...

I am sorry.

==Notes==
Look around the chamber and interact with [[Ancient Book]]s. First:
:{{Text|say|Memory of Malygos says|My research into stasis [[magic]] continues apace. [[Neltharion]]'s enquiries are relentless, though he will not say why.}}

Second:
:{{Text|say|Memory of Malygos|My brother is upset. Something about a calamity befalling his work? He grows ever more distant.}}

Third:
:{{Text|say|Memory of Malygos|Neltharion is beside himself. He says it's all falling apart. That it's too soon. That they need to be held. To be contained...}}

Fourth:
:{{Text|say|Memory of Malygos|It is done. His creations are in stasis. I have done my best to ensure they remain undisturbed.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Telash Greywing|I do not believe any of this. Lies... all lies! You wanted us locked away in cages.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|Young one, I assure you I had no idea. Nor did the rest of [[Blue dragonflight|my flight]].}}
:{{Text|say|[[Telash Greywing]]|Liar! You aren't even real! Merely a spell... yet another falsehood!}}
:{{Text|say|Telash Greywing|I'll find what you are hiding, illusion. And when I do, [[Azeroth|the world]] will know the truth!}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|My beloved Malygos, why did you inflict such pain on so many?}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|Forgive me, I was distracted. You wish to continue your research--allow me to unlock the rest of these tomes for you.}}
