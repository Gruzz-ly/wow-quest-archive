==Objectives==
Collect 4 Shiverweb Silk.
*[[Shiverweb Silk]] (4)

==Description==
[[Kattigat]] and [[To'tik|I]] came here to prove ourselves by stopping the [[Sundered Flame]] and recovering the [[Valthrux]].

Now we're stuck watching over [[Blood elf|this elf]] after she takes a few [[ice spider]] bites. We haven't even fought the Sundered Flame yet, and the spiders may do us in before we can!

We need to keep them at bay.

Thankfully, there's a natural way to repel them. Burning silk from their cocoons creates an aroma that repulses the spiders.

Grab some silk and I'll throw it on the fire. It'll keep them away!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find any spider silk?

==Completion==
Great! This spider silk will burn for a long time.

==Notes==
Enter the cave and the ruins beyond and find [[Spider Silk Cocoon]]s. Opening them loots Shiverweb Silk and reveals an [[Unruly Plunderer]].

==Progression==
{{Lost Ruins}}
