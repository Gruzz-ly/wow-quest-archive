==Objectives==
Find [[Haleh]] in [[Winterspring]] in [[Kalimdor]].
*Use the portal to go to Winterspring

==Description==
I am very curious about Haleh--she is one of the last living [[consort]]s of [[Malygos]]. I am grateful for her going to Malygos in his time of need.

I will admit, I have spent some time spying on her. She is a [[blue dragon]] through and through. Studious, proud, and one of the more careful ones around [[magic]].

I do feel most suited to be the one to visit her about the call of [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]]. Take my portal when you are ready. I shall meet you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Name yourself, intruders!

==Notes==
Upon accept, Sindragosa opens a [[Portal to Winterspring]].

;Portal taken
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|This area is rich with the scent of magic... Haleh must be close.}}

;Approaching Haleh
:{{Text|say|Haleh|Really, there must be something useful in this dratted book... why title yourself "Secrets of Aberrations" if all you present is common knowledge? Ugh!}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Haleh|Sindragosa? I--it can't be. Are you an illusion?}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|Indeed, I am but a simulacrum.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|I am here to ask about your return to the Dragon Isles.}}
:{{Text|say|Haleh|I do intend to answer the call. However, as you can see, I have much unfinished business here in Winterspring.}}

==Progression==
