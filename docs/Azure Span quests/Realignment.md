==Objectives==
Focus on the [[Ley Crystal (object)|Ley Crystal]], then destroy 3 Decay Infections.
*Ley Line focused {{co|15.4|39.5|Azure Span}}
*[[Decay Infection]] destroyed (3)
*Find [[Kalecgos]] outside [[Brackenhide]].

==Description==
Now for this [[ley line]]. It looks like my fears were correct -- the [[decay]] has spread into the line itself.

We'll need to purge the decay and speed along the healing process, but I can't channel enough energy with my mirror image alone.

Focus yourself on this ley crystal here. My connection with you will help me teleport here physically. Then, I will be strong enough.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
While the decay here is lessened, it's still thick enough to cause trouble teleporting safely.

==Completion==
We did it. Great work, <name>. Breathe the fresh air again!

With this ley line restored, and [[Khadgar]] finishing up on the one in the tower, the Oathstone should be ready to claim. I must return to the [[Azure Archives]] shortly.

==Notes==
The [[Ley Crystal]] that Kalecgos is looking at lights up. Interact with it:
:''The player and the mirror image channel into the crystal. After a few seconds, Kalecgos himself appears!''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I am here. Thank you.}}
:{{text|say|Norukk|So he is flesh and blood, after all! We were beginning to suspect you were also some spirit.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I assure you I'm very much alive. Now, <name>, destroy those pockets of decay that remain!}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I'll funnel arcane power back into the rotted part of the ley line. It may just be able to restore its power!}}
:{{text|say|Brena|What is this? This shifting of the energy of the earth itself? What power! Just who are you, mage?}}

Interact with the three Decay Infection objects to destroy them:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|It's done! Thank you for your assistance, all of you. I've placed a barrier around this ley line to ensure it's protected from further decay.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Let's leave this place before more of those gnolls descend upon us!}}
:''Kalecgos and the two tuskarr exit the cave, take a left up the hill, and head toward the road before disappearing.''

Catch up with them by the road.
