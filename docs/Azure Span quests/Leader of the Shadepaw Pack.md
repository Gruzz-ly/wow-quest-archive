==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Kargpaw the Fetid.png|Kargpaw the Fetid|Kargpaw has always been malicious, but he's become more aggressive now that he carries a foul totem.}}
Kill [[Kargpaw the Fetid|Kargpaw]] and recover his totem.
*[[Kargpaw's Totem]] {{co|41.6|16.3|Kargpaw's Den}} / {{co|34.1|26.4|Azure Span}}

==Description==
Kargpaw is the true leader of the [[gnoll]]s in this part of the forest. We've had... unpleasant encounters with him in the past.

This time was different. He carried a strange totem that seemed to twist his very essence.

Kargpaw must be stopped and this totem recovered. I fear the gnolls are meddling in something darker than we can imagine.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Steel Draconic Gavel]]
*[[Large Brass Cleaver]]
*[[Gleaming Bronze Blade]]
*[[Sharpened Silver Sword]]
*[[Shined Iron Polearm]]
*[[Archer's Decorated Bow]]
*[[Ornate Steel Cleaver]]
*[[Steel Draconic Gavel]]
*[[Sleek Obsidian Kris]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|53|82|96}}
* 12,250 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Did you recover Kargpaw's totem?

==Completion==
<Brena recoils in disgust as she accepts the totem.>

Kargpaw was always violent, but he was also a coward. He and his band never attacked us if we traveled in large numbers.

Something has changed... and this totem is behind it.

==Notes==
On accept of all four:
:{{text|say|Hanu|I will go with you.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|No, Hanu! I will not lose you to Kargpaw.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Our newfound friend is quite skilled. Trust in <name>.}}

[[Kargpaw the Fetid]] is at the deepest, northernmost part of the cave:
:{{text|say|Kargpaw the Fetid|Rot you... rot tusked ones, rot all!}}
:{{text|say|Kargpaw the Fetid|Rot will spread... everywhere... no escape...}}

==Progression==
{{Tuskarr Troubles}}
