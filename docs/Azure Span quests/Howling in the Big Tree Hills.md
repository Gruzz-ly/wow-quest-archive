==Objectives==
Slay Durgun, Kerwal, and Bakra.
*[[Hyenamaster Durgun]] slain {{co|35.7|34.7|Azure Span}}
*[[Trap-Layer Kerwal]] slain {{co|35.0|32.0|Azure Span}}
*[[Bakra the Bully]] slain {{co|34.0|33.2|Azure Span}}
*Meet [[Hanu]] at the entrance to [[Kargpaw's Den]] in the [[Big Tree Hills]].

==Description==
The [[gnoll]]s that attacked our [[caravan]] were led by three [[lieutenant]]s.

Durgun was flanked by a dozen [[hyena]]s.

Kerwal cackled maniacally each time we tried to pursue him and fell for one of his steel-jawed traps.

Bakra taunted us, mercilessly.

To have a hope in recovering what was stolen, they must be slain.

{{itembox|You will receive one of:
|Windswept Leggings (Dragonflight)

==Progress==
<Hanu stares at you intently.>

==Completion==
Good, you did what I could not. 

But there is another gnoll leading the [[Shadepaw]]... more terrifying than the three you encountered.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Brena|Be on your guard. There's nothing so cunning and cruel as a Shadepaw gnoll.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Poa|[[Troll]]? There are no trolls here!}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Err... of course, Elder.}}

[[Hyenamaster Durgun]] is immediately to the north at a campfire alongside [[Lela]] and [[Lulu (hyena)|Lulu]], her dancing [[hyena]]s:
:{{text|say|Hyenamaster Durgun|Release hyenas!}}
:{{text|say|Hyenamaster Durgun|Need... more hyenas...}}

[[Trap-Layer Kerwal]] is inside a cave to the north:
:{{text|say|Trap-Layer Kerwal|Trip you, trap you!}}
:{{text|say|Trap-Layer Kerwal|Watch your... step...}}

[[Bakra the Bully]] is at the western end of the quest area, taking potshots at two near-dead [[Shadepaw Bandit]]s:
:{{text|say|Bakra the Bully|Tusked ones suffer. Now YOU suffer!}}
:{{text|say|Bakra the Bully|Bakra... had her fun...}}

On completion of all three, [[Brena]] and [[Elder Poa]] run up:
:{{text|say|Hanu|Brena! You came...}}
:{{text|say|Brena|I see you've been busy.}}
:{{text|say|Hanu|Norukk and the others... they're in the den.}}
:{{text|say|Hanu|Kargpaw is in there... and all these sickly gnolls!}}
:{{text|say|Elder Poa|Slow down, Hanu!}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Tell me everything.}}
