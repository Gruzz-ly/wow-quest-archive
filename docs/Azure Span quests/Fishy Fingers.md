==Objectives==
Recover 5 Stolen Parts in [[Gorloc Shore]].
*[[Stolen Parts (Azure Span)]] (5)

==Description==
Now that [[Mordigan Ironjaw|Mordigan]]'s off licking rocks, we can get to the crux of the problem...

Those perfidious fishmen have pilfered my parts!

We weren't in this dinky little village for more than an hour and WHAM! [[Gorloc]] were swarming all over us! [[Examiner Rowe|Rowe]] was yelling, [[Aelnara]] was screaming, and I'm flailing around with my wrench like a mad[[gnome]]!

See if you can't salvage the situation and get some of my parts back!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
This is sub-optimal.

==Completion==
You're back! I'll start getting the [[Geoscanner 289-07]] reconfigured and as functional as circumstances allow. These seaside conditions are admittedly less than ideal.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of all three
:{{Text|say|[[Wayun]]|How many gorlocs does it take to catch a fish, brother?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Grak'i]]|Don't know, brother. How many?}}
:{{Text|say|Wayun|One. But you have to throw it pretty far out.}}
:{{Text|say|Grak'i|Ha!}}
:{{Text|emote|Grak'i lets out a booming laugh.}}

==Progression==
{{Gorloc Shore}}
