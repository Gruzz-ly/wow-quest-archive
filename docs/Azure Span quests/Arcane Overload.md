==Objectives==
Help [[Rannan Korren|Rannan]] dispel the [[arcane]] bubbles.
*Arcane bubbles dispelled (3)
*[[R.A.D.D.E.R.]] (provided)

==Description==
There! Finished!

May I present to you... the R.A.D.D.E.R!

DUN DUN DUUUUN!

I have calibrated it to the frequency of the energy surrounding the dragon consoles and inscribed a glyph of [[dispel]] [[magic]] on it.

The R.A.D.D.E.R. will dispel the arcane energy and shut down the [[Dragon Console|dragon console]], but the glyph will weaken after each use.

Pretty handy, isn't it?

I detect four of these consoles in our vicinity. Go shut them down!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Were you able to dispel all the arcane bubbles with the R.A.D.D.E.R.?

==Completion==
You've done it <name>!

Well, you and the R.A.D.D.E.R...

But whatever... Now, help me get [[Lathos Sunband|Lathos]] back to [[Camp Nowhere]].

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''Lathos approaches the console and starts siphoning it.''
:{{Text|say|Lathos Sunband|Conserve the  R.A.D.D.E.R.'s energy for the other consoles. I will mana drain this one.}}
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|No stop! It's too much raw arca--}}
:''The console explodes, wounding and knocking Lathos to the ground.''
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|Are you alright?}}
:{{Text|say|Lathos Sunband|I'm not dead... but that's going to leave a mark.}}
:{{Text|say|Lathos Sunband|Thank you, Rannan, for the concern.}}
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|Didn't you just say we need to listen to each other?}}
:{{Text|say|Lathos Sunband|I was just... demonstrating the consequences of a lack of communication.}}
:{{Text|emote|Rannan laughs.}}
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|Suuuure you were. <Name>, please take and use the R.A.D.D.E.R., I will stay with Lathos.}}

Head inside the tower and use the quest item on the console there, which summons a [[Overcharged Mana Entity]].

:{{Text|say|[[Image of Tharohn]]|So, you are the fools who are meddling with my work? You will never stop the [[Sundered Flame]]!}}

;Returning to the duo
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|...and we don't see any ley crystals because they haven't had time to form yet.}}
:{{Text|say|Lathos Sunband|That is an interesting observation.}}

;Upon completion
:''The ground shakes, and an explosion is heard in the distance.''
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|What was that?}}
:{{Text|say|Lathos Sunband|I feel a tremendous surge of arcane energy from the east.}}
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|An arcane surge is erupting from the tower! We have to stop it!}}

Lathos has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
This is an... alarming development.

Despite my injuries, I will see our task to its end.

Rannan has done well. I hope his invention, ridiculous acronym aside, will continue to aid us.

;Description
I present you the R.A.D.D.E.R! I have calibrated it and inscribed a glyph of dispel magic on it, but it will make it weaker with each use. Nonetheless, it should do the trick, remove the arcane bubble, and shut down the dragon console. Pretty handy, isn't it?! I detect four of these consoles in our vicinity.
