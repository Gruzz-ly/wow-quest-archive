==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Stoneheart.jpg|Stoneheart|The Primalists' gift transformed the Rustpine chieftain's body into hardened stone.}}
Kill Stoneheart.
*[[Stoneheart]] slain {{co|60.5|49.5|Azure Span}}

==Description==
We howl with grief for our [[chieftain]], yet he lives.

What remains of Stoneheart is in the cave ahead. Many tried to reason with him.

He killed them--and almost killed [[Narn]].

He is a monster! This is the goal of the [[primalists]]. They would turn us into stone and flame to serve them.

There is no [[Rustpine clan|Rustpine]] left in him. He must be destroyed before others meet the same fate.

==Progress==

My chieftain, I am sorry.

There was nothing else that could be done.
