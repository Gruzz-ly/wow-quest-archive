Kill Frigellus near [[Camp Antonidas]].
*[[Frigellus]] slain

==Description==
<The page's script glows with a soft blue light.>

Previously a cherished plaything of [[Malygos]], the [[elemental]] Frigellus suffered from his master's neglect.

While this once-happy settlement crumbled apace, the churlish and playful creature grew warped and twisted by the evils that plague this land.

Please see that it is safely neutralized.

Bring word of your success to [[Custodian Cynegos]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|82|86}}
* 24,650 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +200 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Return to Custodian Cynegos in Camp Antonidas.

==Completion==
Let us hope there aren't any more surprises trapped in that glacier.
