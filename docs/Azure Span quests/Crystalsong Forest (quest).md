==Objectives==
Speak to [[Kalecgos]].

==Description==
The [[blue dragon]] [[Lanigosa]] lent her aid to mortals during [[Third invasion of the Burning Legion|the most recent war]] against the [[Burning Legion]]. However, she failed to respond to the call of [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]].

Has something befallen her? Or has she simply chosen not to return? Whatever her reasons, [[Azuregos]]'s [[Dragon Locator|globe]] seems to suggest that she was last seen in [[Crystalsong Forest]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Lanigosa has always been cordial with me. I hope she is all right.

==Progression==
{{The Veiled Ossuary}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.1.0|note=Added.}}
