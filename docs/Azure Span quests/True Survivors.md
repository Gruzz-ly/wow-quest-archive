==Objectives==
Find and speak with [[Old Grimtusk]] at the [[Frozen Lake]] in the [[Azure Span]].

==Description==
I know we're pretty banged up, we can't forget why we're here. Our people are counting on us, and I don't plan on letting them down. We've got to find a temporary place for ourselves in these savage parts, and I know just the place.

Now quit whining and MOVE IT.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+1,500 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Completion==
That wasn't so hard, was it?

Go to [[Grimtusk's Hideaway]] to turn in the quest. Doing so also awards the "Snowhide Camp" criterion of [[Sojourner of Azure Span]].
