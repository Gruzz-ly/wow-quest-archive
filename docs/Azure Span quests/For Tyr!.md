==Objectives==
Witness the induction ceremony of the [[Tyr's Guard]] on the steps of [[Tyrhold]].
*Speak to Travard at Tyrhold

==Description==
Did they all complete their trials successfully? Good. I'm sure you played no small part in that.

There's one final step we need to take before I can formally induct our recruits as full-fledged members of the Tyr's Guard: the Tyr's Guard initiation ceremony.

It would make me proud if you stood with us on the steps of Tyrhold as I formally reforge the Tyr's Guard. Will you join us?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
The Tyr's Guard stands once again. I feel both renewed and... very old. They still have much to learn, and I have much to teach them.

Now, onto the task of recovering [[Tyr]]'s memories!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''The present paladins all move out.''
:{{Text|say|Travard|Recruits, move out. Our true mission continues at Tyrhold!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Talthis]]|I'm glad we could bring some order to this place, but I look forward to our actual mission.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Valunei]]|Yes! We may be able to restore the compassionate Tyr to our world.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Hadwin]]|Compassion? I think his first order of business will be justice. And it's about time!}}
:{{Text|say|Talthis|Ah, but you said order first. That is always Tyr's primary concern.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Nolaki]]|Whether it be order or justice, Tyr will stand for it no matter the cost.}}
:{{Text|say|Valunei|You do not think his gentle guidance and wise counsel are important?}}
:{{Text|say|Hadwin|We do, but it seems like there are more urgent things, right?}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|We won't know what his priorities are if we don't get to Tyrhold. Less talking more walking, people.}}

Head to Tyrhold and speak with Travard.
:Thank you for coming, <name>. Are you ready to begin the ceremony?

:{{Gossip|quest=|I'm ready.}}
:A cutscene plays out.
