==Objectives==
Confront Quartermaster Doros in the [[Lonely Falls]].
*[[Quartermaster Doros]] confronted {{co|73.5|53.6|Azure Span}}

==Description==
They seem to know that [[Sarkareth]] is gone, but because their missions were so far from [[Zaralek Cavern]], it looks like they never heard how he met his demise. 

We should talk to them. Maybe if they knew why so many of their brethren now follow me they would become [[Ebon Scales]] again. Or not...

<[[Emberthal]] sighs.>

This could backfire catastrophically, but I feel like we must try. Quartermaster Doros seems to be in command here. Go and speak to him, <name>. I do not think he would listen to me...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Find Quartermaster Doros. If you can talk to him, we might be able to avoid a conflict.

==Completion==
That... did not go as I had hoped.

==Notes==
[[Quartermaster Doros]] is on the north shore of the lake, west of the waterfall, gathering meat from a dead [[Broadhoof Bull]].

Speak with him:
{{book|content=
Parlay? With my master's sworn enemy?

<Doros spits and grips his cleaver.>

Never.

{{gossip|quest=|Emberthal wants unity and would welcome you as Ebon Scales.}}
}}

Doros turns hostile. Fend him off:
:{{text|say|Quartermaster Doros|I will not parlay with that disgrace of a [[dracthyr]]!}}
:{{text|say|Quartermaster Doros|The Sundered Flame will never be extinguished!}}
:{{text|say|Quartermaster Doros|Death before dishonor...}}

==Progression==
{{A Single Wing}}
