'''Highland Fishing''' becomes available at Renown level 15 with the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]. This quest has no rewards; it exists only to direct you to [[Tavio]], who can craft you a [[Polished Basalt Bracelet]].

==Completion==
Are you up for an exceptional challenge and added danger in your favorite pastime of [[fishing]]?

I can craft something that will allow you to catch the most intense species of fish: the ones that call the lava rivers of the [[Dragon Isles]] home!
