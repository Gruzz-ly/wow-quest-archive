==Objectives==
Find clues regarding what the artifact [[Valthrux]] really is.
*[[Crumbling Tablet]] found
*[[Scratched Tablet]]
*[[Sundered Flame Journal]] found
*[[Discarded Journal]] Found

==Description==
<[[To'tik]] whispers to you.>

I don't like this. Mysterious artifacts whispering promises of greatness does not sound good.

But we can't just walk away... otherwise the [[Sundered Flame]] will get their hands on it. Whatever "it" is...

I'm familiar with ruins like [[Lost Ruins|this]]. The [[blue dragon]]s often left behind notes on their work. Keep your eyes open, and you may find some around.

We can use whatever evidence you find to warn [[Alia Sunsoar|Alia]] and [[Kattigat]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Did you find anything useful in the ruins?

==Completion==
Let's see what you've found...

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Alia Sunsoar|What are you two whispering about?}}
:{{Text|say|To'tik|How to deal with [[ice spider]]s if they come up again. Figured they might be an issue.}}
:{{Text|say|Alia Sunsoar|We need to work together on this. This artifact could be dangerous if it falls into the Sundered Flame's hands.}}
:{{Text|say|Kattigat|No need to worry! To'tik's been a brave "worrier" ever since we were kids.}}

Discarded Journal is found next to [[Menow]] at {{co|69.53|44.13|Azure Span}}. Sundered Flame Journal is inside a building at {{Co|70.01|46.16|Azure Span}}. While there, head upstairs to find Scratched Tablet at {{Co|70.24|46.17|Azure Span}}. Crumbling Tablet is found inside a tower at {{Co|70.19|43.31|Azure Span}}.
