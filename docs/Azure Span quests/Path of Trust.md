'''Path of Trust''' begins the Winterpelt language skill 75 portion of the [[Winterpelt Furbolg]] storyline.

==Objectives==

==Description==
Radza sent me to find you and tell you to come to her. She set her incense burner out which means she's going to perform a ritual.

That means whatever she wants is important.

Radza's just west of here. I wouldn't keep her waiting!

Thank you for coming to see me. The Winterpelt shaman have begun to trust us! We have much work to do...
