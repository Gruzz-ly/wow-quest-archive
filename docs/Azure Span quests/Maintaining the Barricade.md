==Objectives==
Slay or knock Primal Nightflames from the air with Whirling Surge.
* [[Primal Nightflame]]s grounded (4)

==Description==
It's all I can do to keep this shield up under the barrage these shadowflame drakes are putting out.

Thin their ranks before we're pinned down for good.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Iskaara Tuskarr Insignia]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]
*4x [[Whelpling's Awakened Crest]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]

==Progress==
Incoming!

==Completion==
Excellent work. I might even be able to catch my breath before the next catastrophe.

==Notes==
Mount up and use the #3 [[Whirling Surge]] ability on any [[Primal Nightflame]]s strafing the area. With good aim it's possible to take out multiple proto-drakes with one surge!

==Progression==
{{Fyrakk Assaults}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.1.0|note=Added.}}
