==Objectives==
Slay 6 Infected Frigidpelts.
*Infected Frigidpelts Slain (6)

==Description==
The species we've been sent to study is the frigidpelts.

Their hunting grounds have been tainted by [[ley lines]]. [[Arcane]] energies leech into the water and into the plants... and into prey species like the [[slyvern]].

But unlike other organisms, the frigidpelts survive the process and gain power from it.

They also become aggressive--which is a problem. Engage a few, and I will take notes on their strength and aggression. 

My report will help the [[Kirin Tor]] decide what to do for them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*9,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hm? Oh, sorry. I was just jotting down more observations.

==Completion==
<She scribbles notes down in her journal.>

Yes... Yes, this is all very helpful. Hopefully the Kirin Tor will be able to use this information to help others afflicted by the arcane sickness.

==Notes==
Kill [[Prowling Frigidpelt]]s and [[Frigidpelt Matriarch]]s.

:{{Text|say|Steria Duskgrove|I don't understand how killing frigidpelts isn't "interference" but healing Sylvie is.}}
:{{Text|say|Callisto Windsor|Removing afflicted frigidpelts heals the ecosystem. And it gives us information we can use later.}}
:{{Text|say|Steria Duskgrove|And if we heal enough animals, we'd get the same effect. Cally, why do you still not trust my methods?}}
:{{Text|say|Callisto Windsor|Steria, that's not it. I...}}

==Progression==

;Objectives
Slay 6 Prowling Ice Bears in [[Slyvern Plunge]]
*Ice [[Bear]]s Slain (6)

;Description
[[Steria Duskgrove|Steria]] refuses to continue our research until we heal this sickly beast. I suppose I have no choice but to request you expedite the process. There are some ice bears in the area. They're the natural predators of this [[slyvern]] and might interfere with Steria's healing. Could you slay the beasts?

;Notes
Objectives counted [[Frigidpelt Cub]]s and [[Frigidpelt Den Mother]]s.
