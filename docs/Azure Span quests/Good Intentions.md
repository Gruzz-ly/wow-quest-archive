==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Valthrux.jpg|Valthrux|Let's hope we get there in time before Alia is consumed by the artifact.}}
Stop Alia Sunsoar and destroy the artifact Valthrux.
*[[Alia Sunsoar|Alia]] stopped
*[[Valthrux]] Destroyed

==Description==
I may know where the artifact is. Alia was whispering frantically when you brought all the shards back.

She kept saying something about a "cave" and how the [[spider]]s seemed attracted to it.

There's no cave in the area in front of us... which leads me to believe there might be one deeper in the ruins.

We'll stay here and keep your escape path open, <name>. Please save Alia and destroy this cursed artifact.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of these rewards:
|Windswept Sash#Rare
|Twisted Leather Belt#Rare
|Bramble Chain Belt#Rare
|Sleet Shined Waistguard#Rare
}}

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|55|24}}
*9,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
*+150 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Let's hope this works...

==Completion==
To'tik was right. This place is cursed.

We'll let the [[Kirin Tor]] know what happened here, <name>. Thank you for your help.

This is a lesson I won't soon forget...

==Notes==
Find the entrance to the [[Forgotten Cavern]] at {{Co|71.69|43.70|Azure Span}}. Alia is at the bottom with Valthrux. Attack her:
:{{Text|say|Valthrux|Alia Sunsoar's soul is mine. You shall join her!}}
:{{Text|say|Alia Sunsoar|Alia Sunsoar's soul is mine. You shall join her!}}

;Alia killed
:{{Text|say|Valthrux|Ah... perhaps we can come to an agreement? This was all a massive misunderstanding.}}

Interact with the book:
:<Name>. I know your name from Alia. She thought so many awful things about you. Were you aware of that?

:I know things seemed a bit hostile before, but there's no need for you to destroy me.

:Some considered me a "cursed" artifact, but my power changes depending on who wields me!

:Surely you would do better than all those before you. I can see it as clear as the pages in my book!

:{{Gossip|<Destroy Valthrux>}}

As the tome explodes, the ghosts of [[Freed Soul]]s, [[The Chronicler]], and Alia appear:
:{{Text|say|The Chronicler|Thank you... now we are free.}}
:{{Text|say|Alia Sunsoar|Please... warn others of my tale. Ensure no one else makes my mistake.}}
:''The ghosts disappear.''

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|To'tik|We'll return to the Kirin Tor and warn them of what happened here.}}
:{{Text|say|Kattigat|[[Old Grimtusk|Grimtusk]] will want to hear about this. Another tale of the dangers lurking within this place...}}
:''The pair leave the place.''

Completing the quests also awards the "Lost Ruins" criterion of [[Sojourner of Azure Span]].
