==Objectives==
Clean 6 Rotting Piles from the lake.
*[[Rotting Pile]]s dealt with (6)

==Description==
First things first--I need my base of operations back! But the [[elemental]]s running amok around here have made it very difficult to gain even a toehold.

And of course it is those wretched [[gnoll]]s' fault.

The gnolls have dumped so much refuse, offal, and [[Light]] knows what else into the lake that the local elementals have started to go berserk.

Be a dear and clean up a few of the more revolting messes before things come to a head. And, more importantly, before they stain my robes permanently!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +150 reputation with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Ugh, the smell is horrific.

==Completion==
I can taste the difference already!

==Notes==
Interact with [[Rotting Pile]]s to spawn the [[Muck Elemental]]s.
