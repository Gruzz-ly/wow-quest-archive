==Objectives==
Bring Talthis 5 Tuskarr relics.
*[[Recovered Tuskarr Relic]] (5)
*Return the Tuskarr Relics to [[Talthis]]

==Description==
I know why [[Travard]] chose this area for our training. The [[decay]] here is... chaotic and disordered.

Things that [[Tyr]] and the [[titan]]s are not!

The nearby [[gnoll]]s revel in the decay. Revolting.

They have taken over territory that was once occupied by the proud, noble, and civil [[tuskarr]].

The tuskarr have asked that relics they had to abandon are returned to them. Please help me fight the gnolls and retrieve the relics so the tuskarr can continue their rituals in [[Iskaara]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
The gnolls had no right to those relics. They belong to the tuskarr.

==Completion==
I am glad that we could restore these relics to the tuskarr. It feels good to impose some semblance of order on the chaos of decay.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Talthis|The gnolls have driven out the tuskarr, throwing their lives into upheaval, <name>. I am going to restore what order I can.}}
:''Talthis runs away.''

Head to the [[Brackenhide Outskirts]]. Talthis is standing next to two dead [[Brackenhide Scrapper]]s. Look around the camp and open [[Abandoned Tuskarr Relic]]s. Three gathered:
:{{Text|say|Talthis|An excellent start, <name>! Get a couple more, and I'll take what you and I have gathered back to the tuskarr.}}

;All collected
:{{Text|say|Talthis|I wish the gnolls had returned them to us willingly, <name>. But we can't be blamed for their choices. We must restore order!}}

Speak with Talthis:
:I have gathered a few of the relics the tuskarr left behind, <name>. Can you bring me any you find as well? I will take them to Iskaara.

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Give Talthis the Recovered Relics.>}}
:{{Text|say|Talthis|In some small way, order has been restored. Tyr would be pleased! I will meet you back at camp, <name>.}}
