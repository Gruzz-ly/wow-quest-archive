==Objectives==
Convince Alia to destroy [[Valthrux]].
*[[Alia Sunsoar|Alia]] warned

==Description==
What you found makes it sound like the artifact's power has doomed everyone who has used it so far.

The [[dragonspawn]] who lived here killed each other over it. The [[Sundered Flame]] seem like they're also getting corrupted by its influence too.

This isn't an artifact we need to recover. It's one that needs to be destroyed before it can harm anyone else.

We must convince Alia and [[Kattigat]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Let's hope this works...

==Completion==
This is worse than I thought. Way worse.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Alia
:{{Gossip|Alia, the artifact is too dangerous to use. It must be destroyed.}}

:{{Text|say|Alia Sunsoar|Destroy the artifact? No! Don't you see? Now that I know where it is, we can use its power to end all the enemies of the [[Kirin Tor]]!}}
:{{Text|say|[[To'tik]]|The power will consume you like it consumed the others! It must be destroyed.}}
:{{Text|say|Alia Sunsoar|No. You will thank me upon my return. I will bring peace to the [[Azure Span]]!}}
:''Alia teleports away.''
:{{Text|say|Kattigat|To'tik... <Name>... what do we do?}}
:{{Text|say|To'tik|We destroy the artifact.}}

==Progression==
