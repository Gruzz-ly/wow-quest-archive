:{{Text|say|Gnoll Mon-Ark|Look! Friends who not get decay in cage. They help us!}}

Open the first [[Meat Storage]] cage. The friendly gnoll turns into a hostile [["Friendly" Gnoll]] and attacks:
:{{Text|say|"Friendly" Gnoll|FRESH MEAT!}}

Kill it.
:{{Text|say|Gnoll Mon-Ark|Hm. Maybe was just hungry. Try another.}}

Open the second cage, and the same thing happens:
:{{Text|say|"Friendly" Gnoll|Fresh meat?}}

Kill it too.
:{{Text|say|Gnoll Mon-Ark|Maybe third gnoll no attack.}}

Now, speak with the third gnoll instead:
:<The gnoll looks hungry.>

:{{Gossip|If I open this cage, will you try to eat me?}}
:{{Text|say|Friendly Gnoll|Probably.}}
:{{Text|say|Gnoll Mon-Ark|Maybe friends bad idea. Look for root. It in here somewhere.}}

Find the [[Rotting Root]] near the first cage{{Co|12.99|22.70|Azure Span}} and pull it, which spawns the Root of Decay. Attack it:
:{{Text|yell|Gnoll Mon-Ark|By my crown, kill stinky tree!}}

Kill it.
:{{Text|say|Gnoll Mon-Ark|Finally. It done.}}
