'''Iskaaran Crafting Mastery''' becomes available after reaching Renown 24 with the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]].

==Completion==
The aspiring enchanter returns! Have you mastered your first studies? Good!

Normally, you would now be assigned an enchanter mentor to guide you. But these are desperate times. Instead, I have more notes from out{{sic}} master enchanters. May they serve you well, and may you use them to help our community.
