==Objectives==
Speak to Senegos to temporarily neutralize your standing with Booty Bay, and then find Zeros in Booty Bay in the [[Eastern Kingdoms]].
*Speak to [[Senegos]] to neutralize your standing with [[Booty Bay]]
*Read about [[Zeros]] in [[Senegos' Magical Tome]] (Optional)
*Take the portal from [[Azure Archives]] to Booty Bay

==Description==
You will not believe who I read about today in the [[Booty Bay Journal]]. What is that look, <name>? I too enjoy light reading about [[Azeroth|world]] affairs. Booty Bay is fascinating!

Regardless, I read about Zeros--he was once the captive of an [[Normantis|evil mage]] who hated all [[blue dragon]]s. It looks as though he has found his own way in the world since his rescue.

A bit of advice for you, young one. Debt is a foolish thing to be in, especially in Booty Bay, and especially to [[Baron Revilgaz|the Baron]].

Let us retrieve him before the sharks do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
W-w-who are you?!

==Completion==
Get your hands off me! Oh, wait a minute... you're not from around here.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Senegos
:I have heard some fascinating things about Booty Bay. If you have any history there with the [[goblin]]s or otherwise, we had best cover it up. It will make our rescue mission easier.

:{{Gossip|Help me neutralize my reputation in Booty Bay so we can get started.}} ''(to get the Friendly with Booty Bay buff)''
:{{Text|say|Senegos|Behind me, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|We may use this portal to go to Booty Bay.}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|If you wish, you can read about Zeros in the Booty Bay Journal.}}
:''Senegos takes the [[Portal to Booty Bay]].''

Read the [[Senegos' Magical Tome]] for extra lore, otherwise take the portal. On the other side, Zeros is surrounded by three Booty Bay Bruisers and Baron Revilgaz:
:{{Text|say|Zeros|Baron, you must believe me--}}
:{{Text|say|Baron Revilgaz|I don't care about the truth, only the weight of [[Money|gold]] in my hands!}}
:{{Text|say|Baron Revilgaz|If I'm not repaid in full soon, we'll balance the scales with your own, Zeros.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Baron Revilgaz|Now, get to work, Zeros. If you try to run, we'll find you and clip your wings.}}
:''The goblins leave, and Senegos approaches Zeros.''
:{{Text|say|Senegos|Hm. I might've liked this place when I was young.}}
:{{Text|say|Zeros|Ack! Wait... Senegos? What are you doing all the way out here?}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|Haven't you heard the call, young one? I am here to bring you to the [[Dragon Isles]].}}
:{{Text|say|Zeros|Ah... yes... well... things being what they are...}}
