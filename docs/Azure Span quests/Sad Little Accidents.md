==Description==
You came all this way... I'm sorry.

My dear Hudson used to love painting. It was his life! I don't know what's caused this block.

A few weeks ago on his way back from a painting trip, he took all his unfinished paintings and threw each away in a fit of rage.

Please, traveler, if you don't mind... could you find them? They may just give him back the spark he needs.

Hudson does not shy away from dangerous places to find the best vistas. I hope you are prepared.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Go away.

==Completion==
What? What have you done?

Why would you bring me this garbage?!

:{{Text|say|Ranpiata|I tried not to press him about it. He always seems so happy when we're together.}}
