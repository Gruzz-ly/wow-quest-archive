==Objectives==
Place [[Brena]]'s [[Totem]] near 5 [[tuskarr]] [[corpse]]s to contact their [[Ghost|spirits]].
*Spirits contacted (5)
*[[Brena's Totem (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
There are [[tuskarr]] here! My friends, my people--my family. They left for a hunt not a week ago.

Already they're too decayed to recover.

Their spirits are here still. They linger in rage and regret. [[Kaqiata]], [[Lutokk]], [[Tuyuki]]...

Please, <name>, take this totem and place it near their remains. It'll contact their spirits... and help them find peace.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Tuskarr Spirit Shawl]]
* [[Renewed Proto-Drake: Finned Throat]]
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Some of my fallen kin were able to take [[Karkut]]'s hand into the next world. Others weren't. I feel their presence like a weight.

[[Lutokk]] was going to wed in the next moon.

[[Tuyuki]] wanted to sail to [[Northrend]] to reconnect with our distant kin.

[[Popoak]] was a great hunter, and [[Hanu]]'s cousin. His kills made for the best soups.

[[Nomurok]] was so young. This was his first hunt.

[[Kaqiata]] was little [[Rowie]]'s only blood family left. Now who'll teach him to fish?

==Completion==
So they all chose to lend their power to my totem? 

<Brena squeezes her eyes shut in sorrow.> 

Thank you, my friends. We will use the strength of your spirits well. The gnolls will not reach Iskaara.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I'm so sorry to see tuskarr have been captured and killed here. If only I'd arrived sooner...}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Thank you for your kindness. Decay is part of the natural cycle--we all return to the earth. But this... this is a perversion.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|The souls of my kin sense the wrongdoing and linger. We must help them! My totem will reach their spirits. I only hope it is enough to calm them.}}

[[Kalecgos]] is still teleporting in to help out. Use this time to finish off the bonus objective [[Stop the Spread]]!

[[Kaqiata]] is near where the western root was {{co|17.5|37.1|Azure Span}}:
:{{text|say|Kaqiata|Please, tell my son Rowie in Iskaara that I love him. And I'm sorry.}}

[[Popoak]] is near the center of the quest area {{co|18.1|37.7|Azure Span}}:
:{{text|say|Popoak|We were traveling on the road when the gnolls ambushed us. Take the strength of my spirit to drive them back!}}

[[Lutokk]] is just to the northeast of Popoak in the mouth of the cave {{co|18.5|37.3|Azure Span}}:
:{{text|say|Lutokk|Please, don't let this decay spread to Iskaara. It will consume and destroy everything we hold dear.}}

[[Nomurok]] is southwest of Popoak {{co|17.5|37.9|Azure Span}}:
:{{text|say|Nomurok|If that decayed ancient reaches Iskaara, all of our spears and nets won't be enough to stop it. You must help us!}}

[[Tuyuki]] is just southwest of Nomurok {{co|17.4|38.7|Azure Span}}:
:{{text|say|Tuyuki|I give you my strength, adventurer. Avenge us!}}
