==Objectives==
Meet [[Rannan Korren|Rannan]] and [[Lathos Sunband|Lathos]] in the [[Ruins of Karnthar]].

==Description==
Are you interested in hearing about my invention, the [[R.A.D.|R.A.D]]? No?

Well, I'll tell you anyway--because it found something.

Today it detected a HUGE SURGE of [[arcane]] energy from the Karnthar Ruins. Lathos thinks the [[Sundered Flame]] are to blame. It's the PERFECT opportunity to showcase the R.A.D.!

Wanna come? It's going to be awesome.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|69|15}}
* 980 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You missed it! We walked RIGHT into a Sundered Flame patrol.

Lathos SLASHED through them, but there were too many!

So, I started casting [[arcane]] explosions left and right... KAPOW! ZING!

Oh, but um, yes... the energy surge...

==Notes==
;On approach in Camp Nowhere
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|With a little tinkering, the [[:R.A.D.]] will work perfectly!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Lathos Sunband]]|Perhaps you should set your machine aside for now.}}
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|You don't think I can get the R.A.D. to work?}}
:{{Text|say|Lathos Sunband|No, but I believe you have other talents to explore.}}

Rannan has gossip:
{{Dialogue|
They paired me with Lathos--again.

I'm a man of innovation... of progress! My inventions are revolutionary!

But Lathos... He's always on and on about the importance of protocol. And his military experience makes him bossy.

I think I get on his nerves... but maybe that will change when he sees how useful my invention is!

Lathos has gossip:
{{Dialogue|
Once again I have been partnered with Rannan. The Dragonscale Expedition believes that I will "be a good influence" on him.

They think him too dependent on devices, and that they are a distraction. I know from experience he does not listen well...

But... I feel as though we may all be underestimating him. We shall see...

;Upon accept
:''Lathos and Rannan walk out of the camp.''
:{{Text|say|Lathos Sunband|Protocol dictates I should take point as we enter the ruins.}}
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|Protocol, schmotocol. The R.A.D. will tell us where the surge is and...}}
:{{Text|say|Lathos Sunband|R.A.D. or not, we must be wary. As an officer...}}
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|...The [[Scourge]] attacked [[Silvermoon]]. I know, I know...}}

;Approaching the duo at the ruins
:{{Text|say|Lathos Sunband|Stop this instant! Reckless casting of arcane explosions is very dangerous!}}
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|What? You don't like my J.A.M.?}}
:{{Text|say|Lathos Sunband|Your... J.A.M.?}}
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|Yeah, my "Jumping Arcane Maneuver."}}
:{{Text|say|Lathos Sunband|...}}
