==Objectives==
Reclaim supplies from the [[Primalists]].
* [[Frosty Foraged Foods]] (8) {{co|68|18|Azure Span}}

==Description==
I'm startin' tae grasp the basics of Winterpelt, but what I'm pickin' up is grim.

Seems a band of [[Winterpelt Furbolg|Winterpelt]] foragers fell afoul o' the nearby Primalists. The winters here are as harsh as any in [[Dun Morogh]], an' the supplies they were gatherin' will be sorely missed.

Why don't ya see about recoverin' what ye can. With prejudice, if ye don't mind.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There's a whole village dependin' on these supplies, so don't skimp on what ye bring back.

==Completion==
Maybe next time the thievin' Primalists will keep their mitts tae themselves.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests before heading out. Southeast of the [[Winterpelt Hollow]] village proper is a frozen-over lake full of Charfrost [[primalists]] and elementals, and dead [[Winterpelt Forager]]s. Kill the former for [[Frosty Foraged Foods]] and loot the latter for [[Winterpelt Jewelry]].

The Charfrost units that drop quest items include [[Charfrost Looter|looters]], [[Charfrost Marauder|marauders]], [[Charfrost Pillager|pillagers]], and [[Charfrost Raider|raiders]], as well as [[Snowstone Crusher|snowstone crushers]], but not [[Charfrost Flamebelcher|flamebelcher]]s and [[Charfrost Icicle|icicles]].
