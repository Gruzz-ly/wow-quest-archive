==Objectives==
Recover 3 pieces of the Arcane Blaster.
*[[Broken Arcane Device]] (3)

==Description==
The [[Primalists]] have been hunting the [[Kirin Tor]] since we arrived in the [[Azure Span]]. They detest our practice of [[arcane]] [[magic]].

I'll send word to [[Kalecgos]] to return from the [[Azure Archives]]. In the meantime, we need to hold them off.

It seems one of our main arcane defenses was destroyed in their initial attack. Bring the pieces back to me and I can reassemble it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*9,800 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*+100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Do you have the pieces? I remember exactly how it was assembled, so repairing it should not be a problem.

==Completion==
Excellent. I'll begin the ritual to fix this in a moment.

==Progression==
{{Into the Archives}}
