==Objectives==
Use the R.A.D.D.E.R.E.R to dispel the [[arcane]] barrier.
*R.A.D.D.E.R.E.R. used
*Arcane barrier dispelled
*[[R.A.D.D.E.R.E.R.]] (provided)

==Description==
Alright! The R.A.D.D.E.R.E.R is calibrated and ready to go--for you!

Why am I not using it? Simple!

You have to think of and consider all the possibilities.

Let's say it blows up. Who would fix it if I am injured, unconscious, or dead? Could you imagine?

Now, go dispel the barrier so we can return to camp and get [[Lathos Sunband|Lathos]] patched up. I'll be... standing back.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+400 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Is this day going to get any better?

==Completion==
Just like that he's... gone?

He gave his life to save us because the R.A.... the machine didn't work.

Lathos believed in me... I should have listened... I let him down...

==Notes==
Rannan's gossip:
{{Dialogue|
Can't talk... sorry. 

Gotta think, think, think...
}}
Lathos' gossip:
{{Dialogue|
Rannan is adjusting his machine into, and I quote, "Something awesomer," which I do not think is a word.

While he is indisposed, I have made an assessment of the situation.
