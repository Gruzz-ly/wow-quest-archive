When the Primalists raided our village, they took more than our lives; they stole the heart of our community--our priceless historical documents!

Please, recover them from those looting Primalist scouts so they can be preserved!

While giving [[Little Toz]] his marching orders in [[Ancestral Advice]], players will come across [[Jhagaza the Wordkeeper]] nearby, who starts this quest. Just south is [[Ancestor Molg]], who starts [[Our Path Ahead]].

Find the [[Scribbled Bark Chunks]] on the eastern [[Upper Frostlands]] in front of [[Vakthros Range]] in a [[Stolen Winterpelt Crate]] inside a hollowed-out tree guarded by a [[Storm Scryer]], a [[Storm Scout]], and an [[Animated Icicle]]:
:{{text|say|Storm Scryer|I don't care how cold you are. Burning the crate will give away our position.}}

Aggro them:
:{{text|say|Storm Scryer|We've been discovered!}}

Defeat them:
:{{text|say|Storm Scryer|All this, over bits of wood with scratch marks?!}}

Loot the crate, then turn in to Radza.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Radza Thunderclaw|Let's take a look...}}
:{{text|say|Radza Thunderclaw|I understand less of their written word than their speech, but it speaks of the elders' relationship with the spirit of Ursoc. They turned away from him.}}
:{{text|say|Radza Thunderclaw|This also help explain what led them to turn away from outsiders.}}
:{{text|say|Radza Thunderclaw|Thank you, <name>. We can learn a lot from these writings.}}
:{{text|say|Radza Thunderclaw|I'll share these with [[Sonova Snowden]]. Don't worry; I can deliver them myself.}}
