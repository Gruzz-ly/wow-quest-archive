==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Yetor.jpg|Yetor|The only thing worse than a big yeti is a big yeti with friends.}}
Hunt down [[Yetor]] near [[Rhonin's Shield|Ronin's Shield]].
*[[Yetor's Head]]
*Speak to [[Hemet Nesingwary Jr.]] in [[Camp Nowhere]].

==Description==
<[[Hemet Nesingwary|Nesingwary]] gestures to the side of the path.>

See those imprints in the snow?

[[Yeti]] tracks.

Something must of riled them up to hunt this close to the road. See if you can't hunt down their pack leader. We don't want them to start ambushing travellers!

If he's a particularly mean brute, collect his head. That should dissuade the others.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|53|82|96}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +400 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Careful, friend. Yeti hunt in packs.

==Completion==
Whoa! Talk about a mean mug... I'm glad you made it back alive!

As unsavory as making an example of it is, keeping the yeti off the roads is best for them.

And us.
