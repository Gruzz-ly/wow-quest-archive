==Objectives==
Return to [[Examiner Rowe]] in [[Whaler's Nook]].

==Description==
I saw [[Mordigan Ironjaw|Mordigan]] run out of there like a [[dwarf]] possessed. I'll go chase him down and make sure he gets back to the others in one piece.

If you hug the cliff and jump down the waterfalls, you should be able to avoid stirring up any more of the [[gorloc]]s.

See you back at camp.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|13|45|74}}
* 3,950 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Completion==
It appears you've managed to return our dwarf. And in a single piece, no less. On behalf of both our team and the [[Dragonscale Expedition]], I thank you. 

We'll get Mordigan some fluids, then start packing up.

There's nothing in these hills save blood and salt.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''Aelnara teleports away.''

Return to the camp. Aelnara is seen bathing, and Mordigan is lying on the ground.
