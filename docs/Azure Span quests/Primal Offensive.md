==Objectives==
Defeat 15 [[Primalists]] within [[Vakthros]].
*Primalist forces slain (15)
*Meet Kalecgos's mirror image further within Vakthros Range.

==Description==
[[Khadgar]] and I are doing our best to hold off the Primalists in the sky, but we can't push further towards the tower.

We need you to weaken their ground forces so we can get closer to [[Raszageth]] and stop her before it's too late.

Make your way through the Primalists ahead. If I can maintain my concentration, there'll be another mirror image waiting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Completion==
Good work, some of their forces are diverting from above.

==Notes==
Kill [[Fiery Carver]]s, [[Mountain Shaper]]s, and [[Primal Fire Elemental]]s in the tunnel to the east.

On the first kill:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Raszageth! I am giving you one chance to stop this insanity.}}
:{{text|say|Raszageth|Your flight lies in ruins. What good did clinging to titan magic do for you?}}
:{{text|say|Raszageth|At least your predecessor was an Aspect to be feared. You play with powers you do not understand!}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I am no stranger to putting down maddened dragons, Raszageth. You will be nothing more than a footnote in our history.}}

==Progression==
{{Vakthros}}
