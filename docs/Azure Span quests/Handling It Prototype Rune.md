==Objectives==
Craft or obtain Lydiara's Binding Rune.
* [[Lydiara's Binding Rune]]
* [[Lydiara's Notes on Rune Reagents]] (provided)

==Description==
Ah, I see! We're in uncharted territory here, but I've got a plan.

You'll need some Cosmic Ink, Runed Writhebark, and Shadowflame Essence.

Sharing this recipe with a friendly scribe should allow them to complete a Crafting Order for you. Let me update my notes with a recipe for the Rune of Shadowbinding.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is it ready? Shall we proceed?

==Completion==
Perfect! Of course, we aren't finished yet. We'll need to strengthen the binding if we're to have any hope in making Fyr'alath accept our modifications.

==Notes==
