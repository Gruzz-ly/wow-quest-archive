==Objectives==
Subdue the restless [[Ghost|spirits]] of [[Malygos]] and [[Sindragosa]] within the [[Azure Vault]].
*Complete the scenario, "The Last Conflict"
*Speak with [[Kalecgos]] within the [[Azure Archives]].

==Description==
Malygos and myself both suffered horribly violent ends. The remains of our essences have been trapped in an endless loop.

They must be reformed, and broken out of that loop. To do so will require a tremendous amount of concentrated power.

We will have to utilize every amount of [[arcane]] energy within the [[Azure Archives]]... along with all of the assembled [[blue dragon]]s.

It is the only chance we have to reform these spirits... and to put an end to their suffering.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

{{itembox||Highland Drake: Spiked Legs
|q2=15|Flightstones
}}

==Completion==
Malygos and Sindragosa's spirits can finally rest. Thank you once more for all of your aid, <name>.

There is one last thing that must be done.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Sindragosa
:{{Gossip|quest=|I'm ready to enter the Azure Vaults to free Malygos and Sindragosa's essences.}}
:A cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|Ee7wtspKR_I}}
:''Inside the vault, from top to bottom many blue dragons are channeling energy. The camera sweeps down through the levels as an unknown blue dragon also descends until the camera eventually settles behind Kalecgos, Sindragosa, and the adventurer on the lowest level with the two essences.''
Speak with Kalecgos to continue.

===Scenario: The Last Conflict===
====Stage 1 – Speak to Kalecgos====
:The essences of Malygos and Sindragosa have been moved within the Azure Vault. It is time to release them!
*Speak to Kalecgos

:Give the word, and I will channel the energy we've gathered to release Sindragosa and Malygos.

:We'll be in for a fight. I'll hold off one of them while you handle the other.

:{{Gossip|quest=|I'm ready.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Blue dragons, focus your energies now with mine! We must break Sindragosa and Malygos free of this curse.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Remnants of Malygos]]|What... where am I?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Remnants of Sindragosa]]|Malygos?}}
:{{Text|say|Remnants of Sindragosa|You... abandoned me! You and your mortal kind! You will all pay for this!}}
:{{Text|say|Remnants of Malygos|The mortals are the ones who shall pay for daring to usurp the power of the blue dragons!}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|I'll handle Malygos. You take Sindragosa!}}
:''Kalecgos and Malygos take the fight above.''
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|You have the full might of the Azure Archives behind you, <name>!}}

====Stage 2 – Defeat Sindragosa====
:Withstand the fury of Sindragosa!
*Defeat Sindragosa

The adventurer has the Azure Empowered buff, and the following extra action button becomes available:
*{{Abilities|Azure Assault|id=406529|Interrupts spellcasting. Heals the caster for 5% of maximum health every 0.5 for 4 sec.|icon=spell_nature_wispheal}}

The simulacrum also joins the fight on [[Sindragosa's Attendant]], which is unkillable. When the remnants casts Tomb of Tears, hide behind the iceblocks that appear. In case you die, the Remnants doesn't reset but continues the fight with the attendant.

:{{Text|bossemote|Remnants of Sindragosa begins to cast [Tomb of Tears]!}}

:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|This beast is what became of me? Twisted by darkness and anger?}}
:{{Text|say|Remnants of Sindragosa|The pain... the pain! All must suffer as I did!}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|There must be something left of me in there!}}

;50%
:{{Text|say|Remnants of Sindragosa|It hurts so much... please make it stop!}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|She's holding herself back?}}
:{{Text|say|Remnants of Sindragosa|I cannot contain it... please free me from this eternal torment!}}

;Sindragosa defeated
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|I should have stopped Neltharion when I first suspected his motives... I am so sorry it has come to this.}}
:{{Text|say|Remnants of Sindragosa|I... I should have... stopped him...}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|The fight is over, Malygos! Come to your senses and be free.}}
:''Kalecgos and Malygos descend.''
:{{Text|say|Remnants of Malygos|Never... I cannot... give up...}}

====Final Stage – Speak to Kalecgos====
:Sindragosa and Malygos have been soothed.
*Speak to Kalecgos

Kalecgos and Sindragosa stand in front of [[Sindragosa's Calmed Essence]] and [[Malygos's Calmed Essence]]. Speak with Kalec:
:Malygos and Sindragosa have been soothed.

:It is time that we properly send them... to the beyond.

:{{Gossip|quest=|I'm ready.}}
:Another cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|FtD6DRmO_RU}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|Malygos... is it truly you?}}
:''Actual ghosts of Malygos and Sindragosa appear, standing next to each other.''
:{{Text|say|Malygos|My treasure -- what happened?}}
:''The Simulacrum steps in and transfers her memories to the ghost.''
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|I believe I hold the answer to that.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|Oh... I see.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|My dear, dear Kalecgos. 'Aspect of the blue dragonflight'.}}
:{{Text|say|Malygos|I... remember you. I am so sorry, Kalecgos. My burden should not be yours to bear.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|You did not leave a burden. You left a brilliant legacy. One I... and our flight... will carry onward.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|It seems they are in good hands.}}
:''Malygos nods and takes Sindragosa's hand.''
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|Together. Always.}}
:''The ghosts enter a portal. The simulacrum faces Kalecgos.''
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|You have come so far, my child.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|My work is done, for now.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|Thank you, Kalecgos. Lead them well.}}
:''The simulacrum vanishes as well.''
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|...thank you, my lady. For everything.}}

On the other end of the cutscene, the blue dragons are gathered at the entrance to the Vault. Turn in to Kalecgos.
