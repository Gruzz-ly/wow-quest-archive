==Objectives==
Recover 40 Unstable Arcane Energies.
*[[Unstable Arcana]] (40)

==Description==
The [[Azure Archives]] was once a place where the [[blue dragon]]s would gather to discuss [[magic]].

Now I am the only one of my kind here.

This place controls the [[ley line]]s beneath the [[Azure Span]], but it and its servants have gone out of control.

I believe if we bring order to this place that I can then reclaim the [[Azure Oathstone]].

The various constructs and elements are brimming with unstable [[arcane]] energy that needs to be redirected.

Destroy them and collect what you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* [[Brimming Arcanocrystal]]
* [[Windborne Velocidrake: Finned Tail]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
The archives are in a perpetual state of recreation for most of its guardians. We need to fix its flow.

==Completion==
Excellent work. The creations here are already being soothed with just this amount of unstable arcana removed.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Arcane Pruning]] from another mirror image a few yards away before heading out.

[[Unstable Arcana]] drop from the corpses of [[Destabilized Elemental]]s, [[Unbound Attendant]]s, and [[Uncontrolled Guardian]]s.

==Progression==
{{Into the Archives}}
