==Objectives==
Find [[Varsek]] in the [[Ancient Outlook]].

==Description==
Varsek is one of the toughest [[drakonid]]s you'll ever meet. One of the dumbest ones too, but he'll never admit that.

He got spooked after [[Frostbite (gnoll)|Frostbite]] and started re-evaluating his life or... something. Said he never got to study the ruins left behind by his ancestors. Ran off to be a "[[scholar]]."

Get Varsek back here. He doesn't belong there anyhow!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Winterpelt Furbolg]]

==Completion==
It's very nice to meet you, but as you can see, I'm a bit busy trying to solve this puzzle.

==Progression==
{{Grimtusk Hideaway}}
