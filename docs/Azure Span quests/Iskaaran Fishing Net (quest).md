'''Iskaaran Fishing Net''' becomes available after you reach Renown level 5 with the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]].

==Objectives==
Bring Tavio materials and let her craft an Iskaaran fishing net.
*[[Strong Sea Kelp]] (3)
*[[Stone With Hole]] (2)
*[[Iskaaran Fishing Net]] crafted by [[Tavio]]

==Description==
I see you're getting along with the villagers.

You seek to learn more about our ways of fishing you say? Well, first of all no one fishes with their bare hands. I can craft you a good, strong net worthy of an Iskaaran.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|6|43|50}}
* 2,250 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Have you found suitable materials? I need strongest vines of kelp, and some good stones with holes in them.

==Completion==
Here's your Iskaaran fishing net. Use it wisely, and never take from the cycle of life more than you need to sustain yourself.

==Notes==
To have Tavio craft the net, speak with her and select "I'd like to obtain or improve Iskaaran fishing gear," then create the net in the profession window that pops up. If the Create button acts like it's aiming for a target, hit {{keypress|F1}} (by default) to target the player character.
