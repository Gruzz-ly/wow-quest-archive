==Objectives==
Collect thick bear pelts from thickmane bears.
*[[Thick Bear Pelt]] (7)

==Description==
Being a good [[innkeeper]] means anticipating guests' needs. Unfortunately, I didn't anticipate how cold the nights would be here. Oops?

My guests are going to need blankets--and good, thick ones. Maybe bear pelts will do?

There are some large [[bear]]s in the forest just east of here. If you bring me some of their pelts, I'll pay you for them!

Please? Think of the [[adventurer]]s and their cold, cold feet...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Huh? Oh! You're back already?

Sorry, I got kind of involved in my card game...

Do you have the pelts?

==Completion==
Oh! These are awesome. So luxurious and soft...

Now, only if Valdo were here to clean them up!

==Notes==
Thick Bear Pelts drop from [[Juvenile Thickmane Bear]]s, [[Thickmane Matriarch]]s, and [[Thickmane Bear]]s.
