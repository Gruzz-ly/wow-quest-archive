==Objectives==
Meet [[Rannan Korren|Rannan]] and [[Lathos Sunband|Lathos]] by the tower.

==Description==
An ancient site, an organization with inscrutable motivations--even Rannan's [[R.A.D.|R.A.D]] and its analyses...

It all stirs the explorer in me.

We must discover more about what's going on here.

There are stairs to the south leading up to a tower. We shall press on.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|69|15}}
* 980 [[XP]]

==Completion==
These [[Sundered Flame]] did not die by my hand... or by Rannan's "signature move." 

They were dead when we arrived.

Rannan believes they suffered multiple traumatic wounds caused by [[arcane]] energy.

I agree with his observations. But it's unclear if it was the [[dragon]] console discharging or friendly fire...
