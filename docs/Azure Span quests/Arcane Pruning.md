==Objectives==
Look through the Bag of Helpful Goods for the Ley Scepter, then use it to repair 2 platforms.
*[[Ley Scepter]] recovered from bag
*North arcane field repaired {{co|39.6|60.3|Azure Span}}
*East arcane field repaired {{co|41.2|62.3|Azure Span}}
*[[Bag of Helpful Goods]] (provided)

==Description==
We cannot activate [[Azure Oathstone|the oathstone]] in the [[Azure Archives]] until we fix the issue with the out of control [[Ley lines|ley energy]] here.

Two out of the three [[Dragon|draconic]] [[Rune magic|runes]] that are meant to control it are being choked by unstable [[Arcane|arcana]].

I apologize that this falls to you, given [[Khadgar]]'s responsibilities and the lack of my brethren appearing.

There should be a ley scepter within that bag of helpful goods you have.

Use it to help repair the runes nearby.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
The ley scepter should allow you to properly align and configure the runes nearby.

==Completion==
Excellent work. It seems these runes are able to transport us to the top of the archives.

I believe that may be where our last problem resides...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Driven Mad]] from another mirror image before heading out.

Use the [[Extra Action Button]] to search through the [[Bag of Helpful Goods]]:
:{{Abilities|Search Bag of Helpful Goods|id=396627|icon=inv_misc_bag_01|Search through a seemingly bottomless bag for one specific item. How hard could it be?}}

Luckily, the [[Ley Scepter]] pops out on the first try. Use the scepter at the eastern arcane field:
:{{text|say|????|Who... are... you?}}

Head to the northern arcane field:
:{{text|say|????|Affixes... seek... top... of... archives...}}

==Progression==
{{Into the Archives}}
