==Objectives==
Speak to Akiun and examine 4 nearby corpses.
*Speak to [[Akiun]] {{co|28.7|34.8|Azure Span}}
*Bodies examined (4)

==Description==
A tragedy. And potentially the first of many more.

Find out what Akiun knows, then examine anyone who fell in the attack.

I have my hunches about what happened here. Let's see if the clues support my theory.

Meanwhile, I'll try to reassure my rattled friends.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
We must pinpoint the source of this gnoll aggression, before they can do any more damage.

==Completion==
This is truly a tragedy... but at least we can follow the clues.

We are getting closer to the source of this rot.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brena|Tell my friend what you told me.}}
:{{text|say|Akiun|If you insist.}}

Speak with Akiun:
:<Akiun gazes upon you with weary eyes.>

:For your own safety, please don't stand too close.

:I am injured... and unwell.

:{{gossip|Can you tell me what happened?}}
:{{text|say|Akiun|They came without warning. Foul, fetid gnolls.}}
:{{text|say|Akiun|The only thing they took... was my friend's lives.}}
:{{text|say|Akiun|I'll be dead soon, like the others.}}
:{{text|say|Norukk|You are not dying.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|He's right. You'll pull through, Akiun. We'll escort you to safety.}}

North of the road in the river is a dead [[Tuskarr Fisherman]] at {{co|29.2|33.6|Azure Span}}:
:<Claw marks crisscross all along this tuskarr's back. She was clearly killed while fleeing. Oddly, the fresh wounds have already begun to fester.>

:{{gossip|<Inspect the corpse further...>}}

Two [[Oozing Decay]] pop out of the corpse!

Just northwest is a dead [[Tuskarr Hunter]] at {{co|29.2|32.6|Azure Span}}: 
:<Gnolls would normally retrieve their prey, or at least their belongings, but they have left this tuskarr and his things.>

:{{gossip|<Inspect the corpse further...>}}

Two more oozing decay...

Off to the west is a dead [[Tuskarr Craftsman]] at {{co|28.2|31.9|Azure Span}}:
:<There are wicked daggers embedded in this corpse. The blades are clearly of gnoll design, but you saw no such weapons with the Shadepaw gnolls.>

:{{gossip|<Inspect the corpse further...>}}

As before, out pop the oozing decay.

Finally, and perhaps sensing a pattern, down to the south is not another dead tuskarr, but instead a [[Festering Gnoll]] at {{co|28.0|32.8|Azure Span}}:
:<The hide of this foul gnoll is reminiscent of Kargpaw, but even more fetid. Its fur is missing, in patches, and what remains is matted with oozing pus.>

:{{gossip|<Inspect the corpse further...>}}

Alas, the pattern continues, and two more oozing decay pop out.
