==Objectives==
Reach the east tower.
*Listen to [[Rannan Korren|Rannan]]'s and [[Lathos Sunband|Lathos]]' plan
*Meet Rannan and Lathos by the east tower.

==Description==
I can feel the [[arcane]] surge growing as we speak.

I suspect there is not much time before the ruins make Rannan's J.A.M. look like a distant star in the night sky.

We have to get there and stop it.

Please be careful, <name>.

Meet us by the east tower. We will assess the situation there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|69|15}}
* 980 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This is worse than we thought. The arcane energy is almost at its peak.

Something is hastening the process.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Lathos Sunband|Tharohn, I assume?}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Tharohn|Yes. And you and your "[[Dragonscale Expedition]]" can do nothing to stop us.}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Tharohn|You have lost! We will claim [[Ruins of Karnthar|Karnthar]]'s power and will unleash it on the Dragonscale Expedition!}}
:''The image fades, and the pair starts walking toward the stairs.''
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|Well, wasn't she lovely?}}
:{{Text|say|Lathos Sunband|I assume that you have a plan?}}
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|You assume too much. But yes! I always have a plan.}}

;Entering the tower
:{{Text|say|Lathos Sunband|Rannan, why did you cast mana shield on me on the way here and not <name>?}}
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|I may have, uh, missed. Sorry, <name>. Hard to target someone when you're busy screaming and running...}}
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|Just sit tight and let me figure a way out of this... C'mon, Rannan... think!}}
