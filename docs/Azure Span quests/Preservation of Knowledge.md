==Objectives==
Find 4 Ancient Tomes scattered around [[Camp Antonidas]].
*[[Collection of Tomes]] (4)

==Description==
Greetings, <race>. I am [[Althanus]]. I wish we could have met in a less... chaotic time.

We were helping the [[Kirin Tor]] study the history of this place just a few moments before the [[Primalists]] attacked.

I fear several tomes may still be out there, at risk of being destroyed in this dreadful assault.

Please, you must recover these tomes! If they're destroyed, the history of this place will be lost.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*9,800 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*+100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Do you have the tomes?

==Completion==
What a relief! To lose all that knowledge... I could not bear the thought.

==Notes==
Loot [[Discarded Book]]s to obtain [[Antiquated Guest List]], [[Crumbling Event Planner]], [[Aged Journal]], and [[Broken Texts]].

==Progression==
{{Into the Archives}}
