==Objectives==
Investigate the [[arcane]] disturbances within the [[Veiled Ossuary]].

==Description==
I was hoping that we would find a way to dispel these strange arcane memories from what remains of [[Malygos]] and [[Sindragosa]].

It appears they've grown more out of control than I expected.

Please, accompany some of the gathered [[blue dragon]]s to the Veiled Ossuary and help [[Azuregos]].

Sindragosa and I will remain here, and investigate what to do about this situation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Completion==
I suppose this is that "teamwork" [[Kalecgos]] has been talking about.

Perhaps this is useful after all.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|I'll get you a portal to Azuregos's location in the Veiled Ossuary. Do what you can to aid him and uncover the source of this disturbance.}}
:''Kalecgos opens a [[Portal to the Veiled Ossuary]] and most of the dragons enter it.''
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|I will stay here to monitor the situation with the others... and speak to [[Senegos]] on a matter concerning [[Azurewing|his brood]].}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|It should only be a moment of your time, Kalecgos. [[Stellagosa]], [[Emmigosa]], you will want to be here as well.}}
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|Of course, Grandfather. Whatever you need.}}

Take the portal to be teleported to the upper level of the Veiled Ossuary.
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|Good, you are all here. I need as many of you as possible to drain the arcana coming out of this tomb!}}
:''Azuregos, [[Haleh]], [[Lanigosa]], [[Surigosa]], and [[Zeros]] are channeling an arcane spell to the entrance.''
