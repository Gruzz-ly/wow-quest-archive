==Objectives==
Get the Bag of Helpful Goods, then meet Kalecgos at the base of the Azure Archives.
*[[Bag of Helpful Goods]] requested
*Bag of Helpful Goods recovered
*Meet [[Kalecgos]] at the base of the [[Azure Archives]].

==Description==
I fear we will have to split our attention. The [[Primalist]] threat to the east must be handled.

I must ask you travel to the Azure Archives in my stead to aid Kalecgos in reclaiming the Azure Oathstone.

You'll need to pick up a few supplies to help you with whatever is happening there.

Speak with our portal quartermaster, they ought to have something that can aid you along the way.

Good luck, <name>. Kalecgos will appreciate the aid.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|69|15}}
*1,250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm relieved to have any help. I know [[Khadgar]] and the others must be quite busy with the Primalists.

==Completion==
Khadgar is wise to redirect his efforts towards the Primalists.

But now... we've got a lot of work to do here.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|We'll handle what remains of the Primalists to the east. I'm counting on you to aid [[Kalecgos]], adventurer.}}
:''Khadgar and the [[Kirin Tor Mage (Azure Span)|Kirin Tor Mages]] teleport away.''

Interact with the [[Supply Portal]]:
:{{Gossip|Khadgar said you have something that could help me aid Kalecgos.}}
::{{Text|say|Supply Portal|Ah, this is the "in case Khadgar isn't available, bring this" package. We've got one more left!}}
::{{Text|say|Supply Portal|Here it is. Come back if you need anything else.}}

Enter the tower at {{co|41.03|55.07|Azure Span}} and find multiple mirror images of Kalecgos. Two are having a discussion:
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos (1)|Did you find any tomes detailing the Azure Oathstone?}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos (2)|None. I fear our assumptions are correct--it's a problem with the ley lines.}}

==Progression==
{{Into the Archives}}
