'''Academic Acquaintances''' is an optional breadcrumb to [[Camp Nowhere]] and the [[Rustpine Den]] in southeastern [[Azure Span]], but it will only be offered if players have not completed that storyline, which ends with [[Nowhere to Go]]. [[What of the Winterpelt Clan?]] breadcrumbs back to ''this'' storyline and will block this quest from being offered.

==Objectives==
Find another expert in [[furbolg]] [[language]]s in [[Camp Nowhere]].

==Description==
Aye, this [[Winterpelt tribe|Winterpelt]] variation on [[Furbolg (language)|furbolg]] is provin' to be a tough nut to crack even for me.

I've got some colleagues down in Camp Nowhere who might be able to help. I hear there are other furbolg [[tribe]]s in the area, and comparing notes on those dialects might give us somethin' to go off of.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|69|15}}
* 980 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I will speak my own tongue with you, yes. But there is something I need your help with first.

==Notes==
On complete:
:{{text|say|Sirja|You dare come here? After everything you did at [[Imbu]]?}}
:{{text|say|Garz|That was not me. I did not attack you.}}
:{{text|say|Tanqin|But your people did!}}
:{{text|say|Garz|They are... no longer my people.}}

==Progression==
{{Winterpelt Hollow}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
