==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Kraunot.jpg|Kraunot|The spirit of the whimsical winds of the area around the Kauriq Gleamlet. Known to take pleasure in being challenged by young tuskarr seeking to prove themselves.}}
Face [[Kraunot]], the Spirit of Air, near the [[Kauriq Gleamlet]].
*Spirits challenged

==Description==
Now we should be able to face the Spirits.

Did [[Ruriq]] fail to mention it? By [[Kauriq tribe|our tribe]]'s traditions, we must face the Spirits in combat before asking a boon of them. The strength of their blessing is dependent on how well you impress them.

Perhaps that is why the [[Kauriq the Gleamfisher|Gleamfisher]] insisted we all work together.

If you take on Kraunot, the Spirit of Air, Ruriq and I will tackle [[Otu'rorq]], the Spirit of Water.

They dwell in the cave behind the nearby waterfall. We will meet you there, [[adventurer]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
We must impress those spirits if Ruriq's vision is to come to life.

==Completion==
With how much older he is, Kauj has always been almost... more a father than a brother.

I thought getting older and starting my own family would make me feel less like I needed him.

I was wrong. Even before my wife passed, I was wrong.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Ruriq|Otu'rorq, Spirit of the River, accept this offering-}}
:{{Text|say|Kauj|No, Ruriq, that's not-}}
:{{Text|say|Ruriq|Enough, Kauj! Must you always pick apart every thing I do?}}
:{{Text|say|Ruriq|I shall face the Spirits alone, if I must. A stronger blessing is not worth your attitude.}}
:{{Text|say|Kauj|...Brother, I... wait-}}
:''Ruriq walks away.''

Head to the waterfall at {{Co|45.51|56.89|Azure Span}} and enter the cave.
:{{Text|say|Kraunot|We have seen your deeds, mortals! You want our blessing?}}
:{{Text|say|Otu'rorq|Then show us your mettle and face us in combat!}}

Attack Kraunot. Ruriq attacks Otu'rorq.

After Kraunot is defeated, Otu'rorq gains the upper hand over Ruriq.

:{{Text|say|Ruriq|Curses!}}
:{{Text|say|Otu'rorq|You will never defeat me, fragmented as you are.}}
:''Kauj appears from behind and casts a spell against Otu'rorq.''
:{{Text|say|Kauj|Then we fight as one.}}
:{{Text|say|Ruriq|Brother!}}
:{{Text|say|Otu'rorq|Very good, mortals, you have proven yourselves. Take this and attach it to your boat.}}
:{{Text|say|Ruriq|Thank you, Great Spirits. And you, Kauj... thank you. Come, let us all meet by [[The Fallstrider|the boat]].}}

Head back to the Fallstrider.
:{{Text|say|Ruriq|Have I finally proved myself to you, Kauj?}}
:{{Text|say|Kauj|No, Ruriq. Because you don't need to prove yourself to me.}}
:{{Text|say|Kauj|I never meant to be so hard on you. I got so caught up in the big picture caring for the tribe, I did not see how the details hurt you.}}
:{{Text|say|Kauj|I am truly sorry. I will do better. I am proud of you.}}
:{{Text|say|Ruriq|... I... Thank you, Kauj.}}
