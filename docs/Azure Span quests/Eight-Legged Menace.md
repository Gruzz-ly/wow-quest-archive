==Objectives==
Kill 10 Shiverweb Creepers or Shiverweb Crawlers and 3 Primalist Tenders in [[Shiverweb Vale]].
*[[Shiverweb Creeper]]s or [[Shiverweb Crawler]]s slain (10)
*[[Primalist Tender]]s slain (3)

==Description==
<Class>!

I require your aid if you're willing...

This joint expedition was intended to study the [[Ice spider|unique arachnids]] inhabiting the area, but, as you can see, our plan has gone awry.

What we originally assumed was an evolutionary adaptation is instead a [[Primalist]] perversion of the natural order!

I take my responsibilities as a conservationist seriously, but the time for studying live specimens has passed. We can't let their perversion spread. We can study their [[corpse]]s instead.

Will you help us?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*9,800 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
An unfortunate necessity. We could not allow them to spread.

I think we've learned all we can from them.
