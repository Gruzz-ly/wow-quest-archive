'''What of the Winterpelt Clan?''' is an optional breadcrumb to [[Theron's Watch]] and [[Winterpelt Hollow]] in northeastern [[Azure Span]], but it will only be offered if players have not completed that storyline, which ends with [[Ice Cave Ya Got There]]. [[Academic Acquaintances]] breadcrumbs back to ''this'' storyline and will block this quest from being offered.

==Objectives==
Meet [[Sonova Snowden]] at [[Theron's Watch]].

==Description==
We could join another [[clan]]... if we knew it to be safe.

I worry the [[Primalists]] tempted other clans as they did ours.

This "[[Dragonscale Expedition]]" tells me they have a clawhold near the [[Winterpelt clan]].

They may be tainted. Or they may heed our warning. With either truth, they need us.

There is a "furbolg expert," Sonova Snowden, in Theron's Watch. Please go to him and learn what he knows.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|69|15}}
* 980 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Regretfully, friend... I've got bad news for ya about the Winterpelt furbolg.

==Progression==
{{Rustpine Den}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
