==Objectives==
Meet [[Kalecgos]] back within the [[Azure Archives]].

==Description==
I can hear the pained cries of rage and agony from these essences. I suspect this was triggered after attempting to put them to rest.

They were dormant for a time, but the combined rage of both [[Malygos]] and [[Sindragosa]] merged together to create this phenomenon.

Quickly, we must make for the Azure Archives and inform Kalecgos and Sindragosa of this!

Together, we may be able to finally give them the peace that they deserve.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I am glad you recovered the essences of Sindragosa and Malygos.

I never imagined trying to place their [[Ghost|spirits]] to rest would lead to this.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|Quickly, everyone! Perhaps Kalecgos and Sindragosa know what must be done next.}}
:''All except Surigosa teleport away. Surigosa exists the chamber and heads toward the [[Portal to the Azure Archives]].''

Follow suit. On the other side of the portal, [[Malygos's Lingering Essence]] and [[Sindragosa's Lingering Essence]] are next to Kalec and Sindragosa.

:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Thank you, Azuregos and everyone. I believe we may have an answer to this.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|Indeed. How strange to see what remains of my essence in life. I can hear her cries... calling out to me.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|I have a plan of how to address this matter, though it is a rather dangerous one.}}
