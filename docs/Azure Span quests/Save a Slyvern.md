==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Steria Duskgrove]]|Alright, Sylvie. Lead us to what's troubling you. Go on now!}}

:{{Text|say|[[Callisto Windsor]]|You're welcome...I just worry that our higher ups will think we're slacking.}}
:{{Text|say|Steria Duskgrove|And if that happens, I'll take responsibility for myself.}}
