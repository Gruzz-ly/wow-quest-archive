==Completion==
Fishing is great. I love it! I eat, sleep, and dream it. And when I'm not fishing, I craft fishing gear!

If I've learned anything from my many years fishing, it's that you also have to have a little fun out there--change things up, think outside the net!

Here's a some gear I dreamed up to help you new fishers along! You can have one for free, but if you'd like both, I'll gladly trade you for the other.
