==Objectives==
Collect 7 Ley Crystals from [[Brackenhide Outskirts]].
*[[Ley Crystal]] (7)

==Description==
The [[ley line]] is here--I can feel it!

But first, we must stop the [[gnoll]]s. [[Twisted Ancient (Azure Span)|That ancient]] will be their greatest weapon.

There are some ley crystals the gnolls have gathered. Thankfully, they don't seem to understand the power that the crystals hold.

Bring me as many as you can. They'll empower my mirror image and help me summon something useful from the [[Azure Archives|Archives]] to take that monster down!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*9,800 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
I'm sorry I can't be of more help in this form. I can feel the decay sapping my image's strength.

I hope once we reach the ley cavern, Gleamcove as the tuskarr call it, I'll be able to teleport here fully.

==Completion==
What were they doing with these? Using them as back scratchers?!

<Kalecgos pinches the bridge of his nose.>

...I suppose we should be grateful they didn't figure out their true potential.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I'm so sorry to see tuskarr have been captured and killed here. If only I'd arrived sooner...}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Thank you for your kindness. Decay is part of the natural cycle--we all return to the earth. But this... this is a perversion.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|The souls of my kin sense the wrongdoing and linger. We must help them! My totem will reach their spirits. I only hope it is enough to calm them.}}

[[Kalecgos]] is still teleporting in to help out. Use this time to finish off the bonus objective [[Stop the Spread]]!

==Progression==
