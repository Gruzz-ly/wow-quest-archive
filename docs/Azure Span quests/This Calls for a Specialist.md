==Objectives==
Talk to [[Haniko]] at the [[Wild Preserve]] in The [[Waking Shores]].

==Description==
[[:Lubbins]] is doing lots better now, but I think he still needs some more help. 

A little bit ago I met a super smart [[Dragonscale Expedition]] explorer named [[Haniko]] who works with [[proto-drake]]s all the time. She's a pet trainer, too. I bet she could help Lubbins more! 

I think she was going to the Waking Shores. I bet if you go there you'll find her. 

I'm so happy I was able to help you! 

<she waves happily>

Goodbye! Good luck, Lubbins.

==Completion==
Patchu was right to send you here. I've been working with proto-drakes my whole life. 

I don't know if there's anyone on [[Azeroth]] who knows more about them than I do.

==Progression==
