==Objectives==
Rescue Norukk and 3 other captive tuskarr.
*[[Tuskarr Prisoner|Tuskarr]] rescued (3)
*[[Norukk]] rescued {{co|41.4|64.0|Kargpaw's Den}}

==Description==
I've tracked the captured [[tuskarr]], including my husband Norukk, to this cave.

Norukk doesn't always look out for his own hide, so that responsibility falls to me. But I'm not too proud to ask for help.

Please rescue them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
We can't leave our brothers and sisters behind!

==Completion==
<Hanu wrinkles her cheeks and shoots a tusky grin at Norukk.>

I'm beyond relieved that Norukk made it out alive. We will mourn those we lost once we return to Iskaara.

==Notes==
On accept of all four:
:{{text|say|Hanu|I will go with you.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|No, Hanu! I will not lose you to Kargpaw.}}
:{{text|say|Brena|Our newfound friend is quite skilled. Trust in <name>.}}

[[Tuskarr Prisoner]]s are found in Crude Cages:
*{{text|say|Tuskarr Prisoner|Stop this unnatural illness before it's too late...}}
*{{text|say|Tuskarr Prisoner|Must tell Brena... to stop their foul rot!}}
*{{Text|say|Tuskarr Prisoner|They are trying to spread this... sickness!}}

It looks at first glance like [[Norukk]] did not make it, but after interacting him, it turns out he's good with [[Feign Death]]!
:{{text|say|Norukk|Ah! You saw right through my feign death. I learned it by studying the local [[vorquin]]...}}
:{{text|say|Norukk|I'll make my escape, like a slippery [[ottuk]]. My eternal thanks for the timely rescue!}}

Upon return, the three [[Rescued Tuskarr]] and Norukk have made it out to the three questgivers.
