==Objectives==
Distribute Gear to the [[Tyr's Guard]].
*[[Hadwin|Exemplar of Justice]] equipped
*[[Talthis|Exemplar of Order]] equipped
*[[Valunei|Exemplar of Compassion]] equipped
*[[Nolaki|Exemplar of Sacrifice]] equipped
*[[Tyr's Guard Equipment]] (provided)

==Description==
Before they embark on their last training trial, it is a tradition that recruits first receive their Tyr's Guard gear.

The highest-ranking Tyr's Guard officer would normally do this but... I would be honored if you would bestow their tabard and shield on them for their final trial instead.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* [[Tyr's Guard Bulwark]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
The tabard and shield are important symbols of a new recruit's dedication to the Tyr's Guard.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Now our recruits should be ready for their final trials.

Go to them. I am sure they will want your guidance in completing their missions.
