==Objectives==
Use a water totem to extinguish fires in [[Grimtusk's Hideaway]].
* [[Water Spout Totem]] activated
* Fires extinguished (0/100%)

==Description==
[[File:Water Spout Totem.jpg|thumb|Water Spout Totem]]
This was supposed to be a peaceful retirement, not a warzone!

Grab one of those totems the shamans left lying around and put out these fires before my dreams of a nice fishing retreat go up in smoke! Literally!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Iskaara Tuskarr Insignia]]
*9x [[Flightstones]]
*4x [[Whelpling's Awakened Crest]]
*[[Iskaara Tuskarr Commendation]]

==Progress==
Who burns down an ice fishing hut?

==Completion==
Good job, <race>. Maybe I'll get an afternoon to myself, yet.

==Notes==
Interact with one of the Water Spout Totems in the quest area to enter the vehicle interface:
# {{Abilities|Jet Spray|Spray a constant jet of water at a targeted location.|id=405419|icon=ability_mage_waterjet}}
# {{Abilities|Water Bomb|Hurl a massive orb of water, extinguishing any nearby fires.|id=405555|icon=spell_fire_bluefirenova|range=100|cd=8 sec}}

Hit 1 to start the channel, then 2 on cooldown to help speed up the process.

Players can earn the achievement [[We Didn't Start the Fire (achievement)]] by abandoning and restarting this quest a few times.

==Progression==
