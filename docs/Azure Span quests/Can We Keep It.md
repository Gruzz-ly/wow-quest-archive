==Objectives==
Bring [[Neelo]] 7 Frigidfish from either a [[vendor]] in [[Iskaara]] or [[fishing]] in any [[Dragon Isles]] ocean water.
*[[Frigidfish]] (7)

==Description==
He's only trying to eat us because he's so hungry!

[[Fish]]! Nobody can turn down some tasty, ice cold, raw fish!

Frigidfish are the best, ever. You can fish them up all over the ocean! But if you can't fish one yourself, [[Jinkutuk]] in Iskaara will definitely sell you some.

Bring me so many he won't be hungry any more!

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*[[Neelo's Spare Blanket]]
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
So many fishes! I want to eat them all!

... But no. They're for [[Scaps]]. This is important.

==Completion==
Scaps is gonna love these and then we're gonna be the bestest of friends!
