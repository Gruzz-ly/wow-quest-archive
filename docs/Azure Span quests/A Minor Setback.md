==Objectives==
Reach [[Detry Hornswald|Detry]].

==Description==
Ah, [[adventurer]]! Just the sort of well-armed individual I was hoping to encounter.

I'm here in this literal backwater on very important [[Kirin Tor]] business, you see, and whilst I was beginning to set up my camp, I was chased off by filthy, mangy [[gnoll]]s.

In fact, a rather concerning number of gnolls have gathered nearby, enough that I believe they pose a threat to the wider [[Azure Span|Span]].

Fear not though, for I have a plan! Meet me in the lake just over there, and I'll explain everything.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|69|15}}
*980 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Now, to work!

==Progression==
{{Brackenhide Water Hole}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
