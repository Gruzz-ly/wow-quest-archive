'''A Helping Claw''' concludes the "Help Is Our Way" chapter of the [[Azure Span storyline]].

==Objectives==
Activate the artifact in the tower above [[Cobalt Assembly]] and monitor [[Venderthvan]]'s actions.
*Artifact activated

==Description==
Alright, you've charged the artifact. Let's turn it on.

And stop giving me that look. Don't pretend like you aren't curious to see if it works. 

Just give that thing another shake, back away slowly, and let me finish the job.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +15 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* [[Somewhat-Stabilized Arcana]]

==Progress==
<Venderthvan looks distracted.>

==Completion==
Enough... enough!

I didn't sign up for this. 

Just take the artifact. Before I think too hard about this and change my mind.

==Notes==

Once more with the Shake Jar extra action button:
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|Yes, there it is!}}
:''An arcane orb appears as Venderthvan leaps out of his chair.''
:{{text|say|Nezzie|Oh! Pretty!}}
:{{text|yell|Venderthvan|No!}}
:''Before anyone can stop her, Nezzie runs into the artifact and gets blasted into a bookshelf!''
:{{text|yell|Nezzie|OW!}}
:''Venderthvan and Heleth run over to Nezzie.''
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|It's--it's okay, it's going to be alright. It's just a little mana burn...}}
:{{text|emote|Nezzie cries.}}
:{{text|say|Heleth the Wise|Don't worry! It's not the first time something up here has exploded like that. We've got tough scales!}}
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|What? The wild magic is up here, too? You've been hurt?}}
:{{text|say|Heleth the Wise|Oh-! Uh, no--no! Nobody's been hurt, we're totally safe alone up here! Don't... don't send us away...}}
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|You're children! Even I know children shouldn't be left unsupervised...}}

On complete:
:''Nezzie, Heleth, and Venderthvan walk to the center of the room. Now referring to himself as Vendie, he takes a seat on a cushion as Nezzie curls up on his legs.''
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|To be honest, the [[Sundered Flame]]...}}
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|Well, Taran and the others were passionate about [[Sarkareth]]'s mission. I never quite understood it, but they were my creche mates.}}
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|And if these younglings are alone here because of me and my comrades... Well, I know that doesn't feel right.}}
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|I wish there was a way to make my creche mates stop this madness. But I know there isn't. They've gone too far, seeking power. They'll never listen.}}
:{{text|say|Venderthvan|I will stay and watch over these younglings, at least until their families return and the Assembly is safe again. It feels odd to ask, <race>, but please, do what you must to stop my creche mates.}}
:{{text|say|Nezzie|Yay! Vendie will stay and play with us!}}

Everyone has new gossip:
;Vendie
:<Venderthvan looks up from a toy Nezzie is showing him.>
:I never quite understood my creche mates in their dedication to the Sundered Flame. It never felt right to me. 
:I wish there was a way for them to understand, too. But I know what they're like. They've gone too far, there's no coming back now. 
:I think I'll just... stay here awhile. Some one should look after these little ones, after all.
;Nezzie
:<Nezzie hums to herself.>
:Hiya! Are you here to play with us?
:{{gossip|<Ask about Venderthvan.>}}
:I LOVE Vendie!
:He acts really tough and cool, but he's pretty sweet! I even got him to read me a story once!
:I think he actually really liked it. I don't think anyone has ever read a story to him, before!
:<Nezzie thinks.>
:Maybe next time, I'll read HIM a story!
:<Nezzie thinks harder.>
:But then I'll have to work more on learning how to read...
;Heleth the Wise
:Don't you worry, I'm still keeping a close eye on this one!
:<Heleth narrows their eyes.>
:BOTH eyes, even!
;Fenthik
:<Fenthik is absorbed in a book.>
:{{gossip|<Ask about Venderthvan.>}}
:I like Vendie! He's very smart and knows all sorts of stuff about magic.
:He's even helped me solve some of the arcane problems in this workbook Pa left me!
;Tikkiz
:Heya!
:Did you bring any snacks?
:{{gossip|<Ask about Venderthvan.>}}
:<Tikkiz thinks for a moment.>
:Vendie is pretty cool! He knows how to conjure snacks, and sometimes he gives me cookies!
