==Objectives==
Keep the Sundered Flame away from [[Amythora]] and [[Marithos]].
*Secure the perimeter {{co|74.5|54.8|Azure Span}}
*Defend against the [[Sundered Flame]]

==Description==
The Sundered Flame here are not going to take [[Quartermaster Doros]]'s death well...

They are going to come looking for me. Marithos and Amythora are vulnerable. We cannot let them find us.

Secure the perimeter and keep the Sundered Flame away from Amythora and Marithos.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Drake's Shadowflame Crest Fragment]]
* 15x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
If they find us, I do not think the Sundered Flame loyalists will take prisoners.

==Completion==
I think they are gone. We need to get out of here--now.

==Notes==
A circle of ground lights up to the northwest downhill. Stand in it to start the event. A few [[Sundered Agitator]]s come up attack. Fend them off, then an in-engine cutscene begins:
