==Objectives==
Slay 12 Stormfang elementalists.
*Stormfang elementalists slain (12)

==Description==
Just... kill anyone who looks like they might be magically inclined. Or has organizational skills. Or looks overly ambitious.

Really, just use your best judgement on this one.

Your "best judgement" is to stop speaking to me? Come on, <class>! They're... up to something nefarious, obviously!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*9,800 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*+150 reputation with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Don't they know they've been outwitted?

==Completion==
That had to work, right?

==Notes==
Any combination of [[Stormfang Dustcaller]]s, [[Stormfang Shaman]], [[Stormfang Bonecaster]]s, and [[Stormfang Hexspiter]]s counts.

==Progression==
