==Objectives==
Meet [[Noriko the All-Remembering]] in [[Camp Antonidas]].

==Description==
The [[Kirin Tor]] have our main camp set up to the south of here: Camp Antonidas.

I believe Noriko and [[Khadgar]] are there now gathering [[adventurer]]s to aid [[Kalecgos]] in reclaiming the [[Azure Oathstone]].

If you wish to help in our endeavours, go there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|69|15}}
*1,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, <name>. Good to see you...

Hold on... do you feel that?

==Notes==
;Approaching Noriko
:{{Text|say|Noriko the All-Remembering|I'm getting a bit concerned... we haven't heard back from the patrol up at Rhonin's Shield.}}

Upon completion, a cutscene occurs:

:Noriko, [[Khadgar]], and [[Althanus]] run to the landing platform. In the skies, [[Proto-Drake (Azure Span)|Proto-Drakes]] appear and start firing at the camp. Noriko raises a protective bubble over her and Altanus, and Khadgar runs to the other side and starts firing arcane bolts at the drakes.
