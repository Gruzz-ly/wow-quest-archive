==Objectives==
Meet [[Khadgar]] and [[Kalecgos]]'s mirror images at the base of [[Vakthros Range]].

==Description==
It's a sight to behold up there, Khadgar and Kalecgos fighting the [[Primalists]] in the sky!

They've summoned several mirror images of themselves to help you through the monstrous hole the Primalists have created.

One pair is at the base of the mountains right now. 

If things start to look bad... well I'll get the word out to the rest of us in the [[Azure Span]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|69|15}}
*1,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This is worse than I could have expected. There's no time to lose.

==Notes==
Catch up with Kalecgos' and Khadgar's mirror images to the southeast:
:{{text|say|Khadgar|I'll reinforce the wards around the tower and keep [[Raszageth]] busy.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I'll join you once I deal with these [[proto dragon]]s and the swath of [[elemental]] [[magic]] barraging me from the ground.}}

==Progression==
{{Vakthros}}
