'''Highland Fishing''' becomes available at Renown level 6 with the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]. This quest has no rewards; it exists only to direct you to [[Tavio]], who can craft you a [[Flying Fish Bone Charm]].

==Completion==
Greetings, friend! I see you're getting to know the ways of [[tuskarr]], and thus the ways of the fish.

If you'd like, I could make you something that will allow you to tackle fishing in the highland pools of the [[Dragon Isles]]. Think you're up for the challenge?
