==Objectives==
Help [[Mysterious Apparition|the apparition]] craft a new card.
*New card crafted

==Description==
The day the [[Dragon Isles]] began their slumber was the day of my very last match. Fate was cruel, and I lost my strongest card before I could compete.

[[Guo-Hee Calmwater|Guo-Hee]]'s card, you see, was mine. I do not know how her ancestors came upon it.

Alas, I cannot claim it as my own as it has been in her family for centuries. That was a foolish mistake on my part.

Perhaps you and I could craft a card together? A truly unique card... Yes! Will you help me?

Speak to me once you are ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|27|62}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
*+400 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
The card we create must be powerful as well. I will need your assistance in creating it!

==Completion==
This is it! I have never seen such a card before! Such power! So many possibilities!

Magnificent!

Thank you, <name>. Now I am ready...

==Notes==
;Speaking with the apparition
:{{Gossip|I am ready to craft the card with you.}}
::First, a form is needed. Think of it as a vessel that will nestle the essence of the card. It is much like a rare stone set in a jewel.

::State your chosen form, mortal.

::{{Gossip|I choose the draconic form.}}
::{{Gossip|I choose my form.}}
:::Now, think of the form's goal, a motive to carry on and exist for.

:::Choose the essence.
:::{{Gossip|I choose the Destroyer.}}
:::{{Gossip|I choose the Guardian.}}
:::{{Gossip|I choose the Life-Giver.}}

::::Next, each creation has its own course. How does one act or react to causes and effects?

::::Choose the approach most suitable for our card.

::::{{Gossip|I choose Motivation.}}
::::{{Gossip|I choose Adaptation.}}
::::{{Gossip|I choose Reaction.}}

:{{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|Now that we have your answers, it is time to craft the card. Let us see what you came up with.}}

*(Draconic form chosen) {{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|How very interesting. You choose to be something else other than what you know. I like your sense of adventure and the yearning to experience new ideas and boundaries.}}
*(Mortal form chosen) {{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|Remarkable. You know that you are unique and that you can make a difference. You trust yourself and your own instincts.}}

*(Destroyer chosen) {{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|Essence of the Destroyer? The overwhelming sensation of power! It is a double-edged sword, spinning around you with rage. Beware, mortal, so you do not end that which is precious in your wake.}}
*(Guardian chosen) {{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|Essence of the Guardian? A selfless being? Protector of neither good nor evil, but that of the weak. You are willing to self-sacrifice for what you believe in.}}
*(Life-Giver chosen) {{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|Essence of the Life-Giver? You wish to heal the wounded and cure the diseased. Your choices shed light, and I begin to see you clearly now.}}

*(Motivation chosen) {{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|You are highly motivated. You like to take the first steps and be a leader.}}
*(Adaptation chosen) {{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|You are adaptive. You are intelligent and observant.}}
*(Reaction chosen) {{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|You let others burn their resources and have them at your mercy.}}

:{{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|Thank you, mortal, for sharing such an insight with me. I can tell you, ego put aside, that this is my finest card.}}

;Upon completion
:[[Willa Stronghinge|Willa]] hops down and the drakonid ghost takes his place. Guo-Hee and the drakonid place their heroes: [[Jaina Proudmoore]] and [[Drakonid Hero]]/[[]].<!-- the other equivalent -->
:{{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|It's time for a duel!}}
:{{Text|say|Guo-Hee Calmwater|Ready or not, this is where you go down!}}
:{{Text|say|Guo-Hee Calmwater|I will be playing as Lady Jaina Proudmoore! Tonight's forecast? Heavy frost!}}
:{{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|I will call forth a new hero card! <Name>! Come forth and claim the battlefield as your own!}}
:{{Text|say|Willa Stronghinge|Wow!}}
:{{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|A valiant move!}}
:{{Text|say|Guo-Hee Calmwater|Do you know what killed the [[dragon]]s?}}
:{{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|Not the ice age!}}
:{{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|I special trigger my special ability!}}
:{{Text|say|Willa Stronghinge|PZATS!}}
:{{Text|say|Guo-Hee Calmwater|Is that all you got?}}
:{{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|Witness the might of my new hero card!}}
:{{Text|say|Guo-Hee Calmwater|What? Wait, how?}}
:{{Text|say|Willa Stronghinge|That was the best duel ever!}}
:{{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|Good game, mortal. It's an honor to have you as my last challenge!}}
:{{Text|say|Guo-Hee Calmwater|Good game. I am honored to have had the chance to play against such a formidable opponent.}}
:{{Text|say|Willa Stronghinge|Oof! What a game! I am exhausted!}}
:{{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|I thank you, <name>, for all that you have done for me.}}
:{{Text|say|Mysterious Apparition|It is time for me to move on, but perhaps we will meet again.}}
:''The apparition leaves the inn.''
