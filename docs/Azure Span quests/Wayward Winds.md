==Objectives==
Collect 10 Restless Wind Motes from [[Restless Wind]]s near the [[Kauriq Gleamlet]].
*[[Restless Mote]] (10)

==Description==
Bah! Work together, [[Kauriq the Gleamfisher|she]] says?

But... if the Gleamfisher believes there is a chance we can help the other tribes... we must try.

For the wind spirit [[Kraunot]] to acknowledge us, we will first have to tend to his element. The nearby [[Air elemental|wind elementals]] have been agitated ever since the land began to awaken.

While I inspect this boat you two made, you go and fight to dismantle them, then bring me their restless motes. That should bring some calm back to the area.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
*7,850 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Don't worry, these wind elementals being here simply means they are riled up. By destroying them, we will restore some peace to the winds here.

==Completion==
I will tend to these motes, so they dissipate harmlessly. Kraunot will be pleased.

==Notes==
