==Objectives==
Rescue 6 Wayward Tools.

==Description==
This is terrible! My *hic* tools seem to have run off when I wasn't looking. I can't *hic* stand the thought of them all alone out there, no doubt scared out of their minds!

Would you round them up for me? Just be patient and *hic* try to soothe their nerves and I'm sure they'll warm right up to you!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Did you *hic* find them?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>! I'll *hic* always remember your heroism!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Brinhylde Stoutheart]]|Or jus' give em a whistle. The wee little things always seem ta respond to that.}}
:{{Text|emote|Brinhylde whistles at you.}}

The Wayward Tools have the Skittish debuff and using <code>/whisper</code> or <code>/soothe</code> is advised. However, simply mounting and quickly approaching and clicking on them also works.
