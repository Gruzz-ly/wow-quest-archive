==Objectives==
Find 6 Flasks of Dwarven Antifreeze.
*[[Flask of Dwarven Antifreeze]] (6)

==Description==
I'm in a wee bit of a pickle, <laddie/lassie>. The [[Primalist]] frost lickers stuck me in this overgrown ice cube and the only reason I'm nae frozen solid yet is me secret stash o' the good stuff.

Sadly, me less secret stashes got nicked when tae thieving scum jumped me. I'm runnin' low!

Would ye do a [[dwarf]] a kindness and fetch me flasks afore me blood turns tae ice?

Oh, and <laddie/lassie>, if ye do haftae pull one out o' some [[spider]]'s unmentionables, dinnae tell me. I'd rather nae know.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*9,800 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
I can feel ma wee piggies freezin'!

==Completion==
Thank [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]]! This'll keep me blood from freezin' long enough for the ice tae melt.

==Notes==
Kill [[Shiverweb Crusher]]s, [[Primalist Infuser]]s, and [[Shiverweb Cloaker]]s to loot the flasks. Drop rate is low.
