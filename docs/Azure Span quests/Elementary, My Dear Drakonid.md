==Objectives==
Help [[Varsek]] solve the mystery of the [[Ancient Outlook]].
*[[Instructional Crystal]] activated
*Pattern followed

==Description==
[[Old Grimtusk|Grimtusk]] wants to take another crack at [[Frostbite (gnoll)|Frostbite]], eh? I hate to turn him down, but I left that life behind for the life of a [[scholar]].

I'm trying to uncover the history--and make history. But I'm stumped by this esoteric riddle here in [[Ancient Outlook|these ancient ruins]].

The riddle is this: if you touch a nearby crystal, it says "follow the pattern." But I haven't the faintest idea what that means!

Tell you what. If you can help me crack this riddle, I'll go help Grimtusk finish Frostbite out once and for all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
"Follow the pattern." What could that mean?

==Completion==
Oh dear... I'm not going to lie, <name>, this isn't my proudest moment.

:Remember: follow the pattern and all will be explained.

:{{Gossip|I'm ready to "follow the pattern."}}
:{{Text|say|Varsek|See? It creates these weird symbols on the ground, but I have no idea what language they're in. What could it be saying?}}
