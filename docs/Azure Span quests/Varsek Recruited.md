==Objectives==
Let [[Old Grimtusk|Grimtusk]] know you've recruited [[Varsek]].

==Description==
Seems like I'll be able to solve the mysteries of this place just fine in the future.

Let's just never speak of this to Old Grimtusk, OK?

I'll make my way to his hideaway. I think I'll enjoy taking out some pent up aggression on [[Frostbite (gnoll)|Frostbite]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 7,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
There's Varsek. Guess he finally solved whatever puzzle he was after, eh?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Varsek|I... guess I'll put aside my scholarly pursuits for now to help Grimtusk finally take down Frostbite. See you there?}}
:''Varsek runs out of the ruins.''

==Progression==
