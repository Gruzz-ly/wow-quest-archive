==Objectives==
Dispel 3 Unstable Arcane Energies at the top of the [[Azure Archives]]
*[[Unstable Arcane Energy|Unstable arcane energy]] dispelled (3)

==Description==
It seems the last of the [[arcane]] disruption is up here.

I'll continue adjusting the [[Ley lines|ley energies]]. Use some of the arcana you recovered to dispel the disruptions here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26|91|48}}
* 9,800 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Do you need anything?

==Completion==
Fine work! I can feel the ley lines beneath this place beginning to heal. We're almost done.

==Notes==
Watch out for the swirlies on the platform! Getting hit by one will knock the hapless player off to a (likely) certain death!

Interact with the first Unstable Arcane Energy on the platform:
:{{text|say|????|[[Malygos]]... have... you... returned?}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|You hear that voice too, don't you? It's calling for Malygos, the previous blue [[Dragon Aspects|dragon Aspect]].}}

Nothing from the second, but more from the third:
:{{text|say|????|[[Azure Oathstone|Oathstone]]... is... awaiting...}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|We'll fix this soon and find out what secrets the archives hold...}}

==Progression==
{{Into the Archives}}
