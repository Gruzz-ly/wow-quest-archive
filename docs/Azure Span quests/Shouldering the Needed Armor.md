==Completion==
Hello again! You've done so much for us, friend! We'd be in dire straits indeed without your assistance.

As a token of our appreciation, I want you to have a set of my tufted shoulderpads. They should keep you warm on your adventures.

If you would like me to make you a sturdier set, simply bring me the materials to craft it.
