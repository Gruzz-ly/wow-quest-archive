Slay 3 Hyena Matriarchs and 12 Hyena Mongrels.
*[[Hyena Matriarch]] slain (3)
*[[Hyena Mongrel]] slain (12)

==Description==
Those flea-bitten Hyena Mongrels the [[gnoll]]s breed have got to go! Not only do they have no manners at all--you would not believe the places I've seen them relieve themselves--but they may very well be able to sniff me out despite my exemplary illusions.

Do the well-mannered world a favor and remove them from it.

*{{Cost|26|91|48}}
*10,200 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*+150 reputation with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Why, no I'm not a "[[dog]] person." Why do you ask?

==Completion==
Play dead, indeed!
