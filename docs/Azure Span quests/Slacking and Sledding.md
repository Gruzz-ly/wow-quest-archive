'''Slacking and Sledding''' becomes available after reaching Renown 26 with the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]].

==Objectives==
Seek out [[Kiopo]] on the island to the southeast.

==Description==
As you may know, the [[child]]ren of [[Iskaara]] are fiercely independent. They learn from a young age to fend for themselves.

It's a rite of passage for many of the older kids to sneak off to the iceberg southeast of here. Kiopo, the eldest of our children, is out there right now. Tell him I sent you, and he should offer you one of our sleds!

Ah, that reminds me of my younger days... out there with my friends...

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Magical Snow Sled
|Iskaara Tug Sled
}}

==Completion==
Oh, [[Murik]] sent you? He's really nice, so you must be really nice too!

Why did he send you? A sled? Of course I can give you a sled! 

We have two types. But if you want both, I'm gonna need some good stuff for a trade!
