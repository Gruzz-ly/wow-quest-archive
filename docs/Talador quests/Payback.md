== Objectives ==
Rout 12 [[Shadow Council (alternate universe)|Shadow Council]] forces in [[Telmor (alternate universe)|Telmor]].
*Telmor invaders routed x12

== Description ==
We thought we were safe behind Leafshadow's cloaking veil.

<[[Vindicator Kaluud]] wipes the blood from his face.>

Someone told the Shadow Council's forces how to disable it. We were able to hold them off at first...

Most of the town was slaughtered in the attack. Please, you must avenge our fallen. Rout these invaders out from Telmor forever!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 16350 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Progress ==
We will run from their kind no longer.

== Completion ==
Excellent. The shards are at last together!

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Vindicator Kaluud|I will make sure [[Defender Artaal|Artaal]] gets to safety. [[Retribution Point]] is not far from here.}}

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Restalaan, Captain of the Guard]] and [[Never Forget]] before heading out.

Enter Telmor and take the first right. On the north side of the path is the [[Telmor Registry]], and on the opposite side is a [[Hastily Written Note]], which starts [[Invasion of the Soul Eaters]]. Pick up an Auchenai Torch from the forge to the right of the Telmor Registry, then head southeast to find the first body pile. The second body pile is opposite the central water fixture, and the third and fourth are in the courtyard to the south. After burning the fourth, Invasion of the Soul Eaters completes automatically.

Inside a building on the southeast side of the mid-level courtyard, find the [[Auchenai Prayerbook]], and the [[Leafshadow]] Crystal is found in the building on northwest side of the same courtyard.

Head southwest to the upper courtyard and enter the westernmost building to find Restalaan just inside. Turn in and pick up [[The Final Piece (Talador)]].
