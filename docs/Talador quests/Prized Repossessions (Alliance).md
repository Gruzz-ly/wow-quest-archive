== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Shattrath Guardian Maces from [[Gordunni Basher]]s or [[Gordunni Cleaver]]s within [[Gordal Fortress]].
*[[Shattrath Guardian Mace]] x6

== Description ==
The Gordunni have plagued the people of Shattrath ever since the city was founded. Over time they amassed quite a hoard of weapons they captured from our defenders in raids.

Getting these weapons in the hands of our soldiers would be practical and I personally would like to get them out of the hands of the ogres.

While we are in here can you do me a favor and gather up any of those weapons you come across.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: 20 [[Garrison Resources]] and {{cost|13}}

== Progress ==
Were you able to find any weapons?

== Completion ==
Thank you, commander. With this a great dishonor on the legacy of Shattrath has been removed.

== Gains ==
* 14250 XP

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Supply Recovery (Alliance)]] and [[Punching Through (Alliance)]] before heading out.

''On accept of all three, Miall joins the party'':
:{{text|say|Miall|Let's do this!}}
Start killing ogres to acquire their maces. Crates of Iron Horde Shipments litter the ground, so interact with one to launch a flare and summon one of Thaelin's copters to pick it up.

Inside the fortress, keep an eye out for rare hydra [[Gennadian]], which drops the [[Scales of Gennadian]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]]. Also, in the fourth tower (the one immediately to the northeast of the [[Throne of the Witch Lord]]), find an [[Iron Box]] which contains a [[Gordunni Skullthumper]] and roughly {{cost|15}}.

==Progression==
