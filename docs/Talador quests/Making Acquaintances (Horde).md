==Objectives==
Follow [[Archmage Khadgar]] and speak with [[Magister Krelas]] in [[Zangarra]].
*Khadgar's portal taken {{co|80.6|26.1|Talador}}

==Description==
It's nice to see someone else taking a vested interest in the arcane arts, you know. It's all too rare these days if you ask me!

Unfortunately, I must meet [[Cordana]] to handle an important matter, but we're in luck! One of my good friends in the [[Kirin Tor]] has agreed to help you connect your arcane sanctum to the ley line network.

He's waiting at my tower. Let's leave immediately and introduce you to one another.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|30|}}

==Progress==
''On accept''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Come, <name>. I will introduce you to a friend of mine who can help you with your tower.}}
:''Khadgar transforms into a raven and heads uphill to the east, stopping short at an arcane gatekeeper and changes back to his human form.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Let us pass, gatekeeper.}}
:{{text|say|Kirin Tor Guardian|[[Jaina Proudmoore|Lady Proudmoore]] has expressly forbid Horde from entering Kirin Tor grounds.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Then let Jaina take it up with me. I am a member of the Council, and you WILL let me and my friend pass.}}
:{{text|say|Kirin Tor Gatekeeper|Very well, Archmage. As you wish.}}
:{{text|say\Archmage Khadgar|My tower lies just through this pass.}}
:''Some more riding into [[Zangarra]].''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|When you are ready, take this portal down to my tower.}}
:''After taking the portal...''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|My friend is just ahead.}}
:''He walks past two mages in a magical duel.''
:{{text|say|Kirin Tor Magus 1|Frost is clearly the superior path. Give up!}}
:{{text|say|Kirin Tor Magus 2|We'll see about that!}}
:''Khadgar makes it to Magister Krelas' position.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Ah, there you are! This is the one I was telling you about.}}
:{{text|say|Magister Krelas|Splendid! Thank you, Archmage. I can handle things from here.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Very good. I'm sure I'll be seeing the both of you soon.}}

==Completion==
I am Magister Krelas. Pyromaniac.

Pleasure.
