==Objectives==
Dispatch Ra'tok the Hammer in the [[Orunai Coast]].
*[[Ra'tok the Hammer]] slain
*Suggested players: 3

==Description==
The [[Iron Horde]] have no honor. They disgust me.

We spotted one of their lieutenants wandering the cliffs not far from our base. I believe that she is tracking our movements to prepare for some sort of assault from the Orunai Coast.

I understand you have much to do, commander. If you have the time, I believe it would be beneficial to our position's integrity.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Ra'tok's Painhammer|Ra'tok's Buckler|Ra'tok's Throatguard|Sha'tari Deadeye Belt|Talador Sentinel Belt}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|26|80}}
*17,980 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I knew you'd kill her. No Iron Horde is safe from your wrath.

==Patch changes==
