==Progress==
It's all come down to this moment.

Head southwest to the [[Throne of the Witch Lord]] to find [[Witch Lord Morkurk]]. Aggro him and he will pull all comers to his position and wall off the exit to the platform.

The game gives a hint:

Do so.

Stand in the bubble shields whenever Morkurk does his special, and blow him up.
