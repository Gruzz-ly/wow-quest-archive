==Objectives==
Gather 30 Pulsating Pustules from [[Sporebat]]s and [[Fungal Giant]]s in [[Zangarra]].
*[[Pulsating Pustule]] (30)

==Description==
We need a way to create an artificial nexus at your tower.

I know where we can get the conduit to do that, but it's well-guarded. We need to keep our cool and do this the right way.

I have a plan - a scroll of mass teleportation.

The fungal giants and shamblers down below are covered with pustules full of an oily substance. We can use the oil to craft a makeshift ink substitute for the scroll.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14250 [[XP]]
*20x [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
The giants are harder to take down, but they will yield more pustules!

==Completion==
This isn't quite what they taught me in [[Dalaran]], but it'll have to do!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Forming the Scroll (Alliance)]] and [[Gathering the Spark (Alliance)]] before heading out. After picking up all three:
:{{text|say|Magister Serena|Ready when you are!}}
:''Serena joins the party and buffs everyone with Arcane Brilliance: Increases critical strike chance by 5%. Only works in Zangarra and Gordal Fortress.''

Head out into Zangarra, killing [[Invasive Shambler]]s and [[Encroaching Giant]]s, looting [[Slumbering Protector]]s, and finding Arcane Vortexes.

On the east side of the caldera, way down low, find rare spore walker [[No'losh]].

==Progression==
{{Talador mage tower}}
