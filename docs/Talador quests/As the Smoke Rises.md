==Objectives==
Find [[Crystal-Shaper Barum]] near [[Aruuna]] in [[Talador]].

==Description==
Aruuna burns.

The arakkoa swooped down from their spires and are turning everything to ash. [[Draenei]], [[talbuk]], even [[orc]]; they care not for allegiances. They merely want to watch the world burn.

I barely escaped with my life, but my best friend, Barum, stayed behind to find his daughter. The others all say you are a great champion. Please, I beg of you, go to Aruuna and find them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|30}}
*1420 XP

==Completion==
[[Kalaam]] sent you? By the Light, I knew I could count on him!

==Notes==
Southeast past [[Vol'jin's Pride]]
