==Objectives==
Kill 10 Ango'rosh in the Ango'rosh Ruins.
* [[Ango'rosh]] slain (10)

==Description==
They may be spirits, but the Ango'rosh are still ogres. Even with their books in hand, they won't respect you until you prove yourself, and there's only one way to earn that.

By killing them.

You should take out as many of the Ango'rosh spirits and their pets as you can while in the ruins.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|13|40|}}

==Completion==
<Liadrin smiles.>

I knew they'd see it our way.

==Gains==
*14,380 [[XP]]

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Desperate Measures (quest)]] before heading out.

Both named mobs, [[Dur'gol the Ruthless]] and [[Mok'war the Terrible]], are on the south side of the [[Ango'rosh Ruins]] quest area. Kill them both for their item, and kill other [[Ango'rosh Crusher]]s, [[Ango'rosh Spellweaver]]s and [[Ango'rosh Hunter]]s.

On the northwest side of the quest area is the Altar of Ango'rosh. Interact with the altar and let the channel finish:

:{{text|say|Agg'thok the Eternal|We will help you defeat your enemies. We will repay our debt to you, tiny one.}}
:''Agg'thok buffs the player with "Might of Ango'rosh: Chance on hit to summon Ango'rosh ogres to aid you in combat."''
