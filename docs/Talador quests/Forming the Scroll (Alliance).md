==Objectives==
Rip 3 Pieces of Bark off of Slumbering Ancients in [[Zangarra]].
*Slumbering Protectors pruned (3)

==Description==
We'll need arcane parchment to make the scroll.

The arcane energy everywhere at this nexus froze the ancients in place and settled in their bark.

If we take pieces from the few that haven't been destroyed by the fungal creatures, I can mold them into parchment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14250 [[XP]]
*20x [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
We have to be careful not to take too much.  We don't want to awaken them.

==Completion==
Yes, these will work great! I can freeze the pulp into a fine parchment.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Creating the Ink (Alliance)]] and [[Gathering the Spark (Alliance)]] before heading out. After picking up all three:
:{{text|say|Magister Serena|Ready when you are!}}
:''Serena joins the party and buffs everyone with Arcane Brilliance: Increases critical strike chance by 5%. Only works in Zangarra and Gordal Fortress.''

Head out into Zangarra, killing [[Invasive Shambler]]s and [[Encroaching Giant]]s, looting [[Slumbering Protector]]s, and finding Arcane Vortexes.
;First piece of bark
{{text|say|Magister Serena|It is curious that these ancient protectors never awakened despite all this mess.}}

On the east side of the caldera, way down low, find rare spore walker [[No'losh]].
