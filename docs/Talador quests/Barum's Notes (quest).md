==Notes==
''On approach'':
:{{text|say|Melani|I did it, Papa! I made a wish!}}

In Aruuna for [[Burning Sky]] and [[Pieces of Us]], find [[Barum's Notes]] on the ground, which starts this quest.

Southwest of Barum's notes, between the two buildings, find the [[Crystal-Shaper's Tools]].

Head southeast towards the stairs leading to the upper level, but note a red Honed Crystal on the ground next to the central crystal structure. Halfway up the stairs is a blue Polished Crystal. Just outside the building in the upper courtyard, find [[Raksi]], who offers [[Pyrophobia]]. Just next to her is a green Harmoic Crystal. Before heading in to the inn, find the triangular Annals of Aruuna at the southeast end of the courtyard, and Melani's Doll in a char at the northeast end.

Head in to the inn to find [[Sun-Sage Kairyx]]:
:{{text|yell|Sun-Sage Kairyx|Artifacts from the greatest age belong to us! You have no claim to them!}}
Finish him off:
:{{text|say|Sun-Sage Kairyx|No... the prism...}}

Turn in to Raksi and pick up [[What the Draenei Found]]. Head northeast to the Aruuna Crystal Mine, killing winged arakkoa along the way. After entering the main mine chamber:
:{{text|yell|Adherent Squallbringer|Scour the room! Check every corner and shadow, and dno not move the artifact until we can be certain it is safe.}}
Don't take the rail bridge across, but look to the south to find a fallen rock that bridges across the ravine and points right at the Ancient Prism. Interact with it:
:{{text|say|Raksi|So, this is what they were after... Thank you for clearing the way.}}
Don't worry about not being done with Burning Sky when turning in What the Draenei Found, as more arakkoa killing is coming in the next quests at [[Veil Shadar]]. Once finally at the quota, turn in west of [[Anchorite's Sojourn]] on the [[Pilgrim's Road]].

==Progression==
{{The Plight of the Arakkoa}}
