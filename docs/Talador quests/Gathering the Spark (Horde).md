==Objectives==
Harvest 3 [[Arcane Vortex (Talador)|Arcane Vortexes]] in [[Zangarra]].
*Energy harvested (3)

==Description==
We need to get our hands on arcane energy to complete our scroll. It needs that fiery kick.

I have a device capable of capturing energy in the space below, so let's get moving. The infused creatures shouldn't be an issue for the two of us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14250 [[XP]]
*20x [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
There's so much untapped power... think of the potential!

==Completion==
Excellent. This ought to be just what we need.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Creating the Ink (Horde)]] and [[Forming the Scroll (Horde)]] before heading out. After picking up all three:
:{{text|say|Magister Krelas|Let's burn it up!}}
:''Serena joins the party and buffs everyone with Arcane Brilliance: Increases critical strike chance by 5%. Only works in Zangarra and Gordal Fortress.''

Head out into Zangarra, killing [[Invasive Shambler]]s and [[Encroaching Giant]]s, looting [[Slumbering Protector]]s, and finding Arcane Vortexes.

On the east side of the caldera, way down low, find rare spore walker [[No'losh]].
