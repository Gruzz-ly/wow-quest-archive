...and enjoy the fireworks.

Ogres. It's always ogres.

==Completion==
That's what we were after.

Let's get out of here!

==Notes==
Head southwest to the [[Throne of the Witch Lord]] to find [[Witch Lord Morkurk]]. Aggro him and he will pull all comers to his position and wall off the exit to the platform.
:{{text|yell|Witch Lord Morkurk|You wish to see the power of the Empire firsthand, little <race>? So be it. I could use some entertainment.}}
The game gives a hint:
:{{text|bossemote|Use your {{text|red|[Scroll of Mass Teleportation]}} now!}}
Do so.
:{{text|say|Vol'jin's Pride Grunt|Commander, reinforcements from the arcane sanctum tower have arrived!}}
Stand in the bubble shields whenever Morkurk does his special, and blow him up.

On victory:
:{{text|say|Magister Krelas|Excellent! Lets grab that crystal and get out of here.}}
