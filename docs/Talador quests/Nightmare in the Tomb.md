If this [[Teron'gor]] gains control of Auchindoun, the results would be catastrophic!

==Notes==
In the [[Tomb of Lights]] for [[We Must Construct Additional Pylons]], [[Yuuri]] calls out for help and offers this quest:
:{{text|say|Yuuri|P-please... somebody... anybody...}}

On accept:
:''Yuuri slowly gets up and then flees the tomb.''

Head through the door Yuuri was at, downstairs. In the lower hall:
:{{text|yell|Teron'gor|Tagar, destroy the intruder! These souls are nearly mine!}}

A few sets of [[Felguard Protector]]s stand between the doorway and [[Tagar Spinebreaker (alternate universe)|Tagar Spinebreaker]]. Take them all out.
:{{text|yell|Teron'gor|Fool! Auchindoun will be mine. Every soul I consume grows my power. You face the wrath of a power greater than you can possibly imagine.}}
