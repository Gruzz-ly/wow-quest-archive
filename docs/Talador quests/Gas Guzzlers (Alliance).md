==Objectives==
Obtain 6 samples of Goren Gas from [[Glowgullet Shardshedder]]s and [[Glowgullet Devourer]]s within [[Kuuro's Claim]].
*Goren Gas Samples Obtained (6)
*[[Goren Gas Extractor]] (provided)

==Description==
To complete [[Master Smith Ared|my master's]] designs and to stock up the artillery tower we need to use an exotic resource, namely [[goren]] gut gas.

The nearby mine at Kuuro's Claim just came down with an infestation of the things. Could you collect a few samples for me? The stuff is concentrated, so only a few are needed. Just kill one and give its body a good prod with this gas extractor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*20 [[Garrison Resources]] and {{cost|13}}
* 14250 XP

==Progress==
Fasciniating, isn't it? The gas is extremely corrosive to almost anything.

==Completion==
Thank you, this is just what I needed.

Goren gas is rather difficult to come by but thankfully we can make this supply go a long way.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Out of Jovite (Alliance)]] and [[Iridium Recovery (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Exit the garrison to the east past [[Sharptusk Lake]] to reach [[Kuuro's Claim]]. Enter the mine and start killing goren and geodes. Make sure to ''use the quest item'' on the goren corpses to get quest credit for Gas Guzzlers! Jovite Ore is blue-green and on the mine walls.

Stick to the southern wall of the mine to get to the upper level, where at {{co|78.2|14.7|Talador}} all the way in the back, is a pile of [[Pure Crystal Dust]]. The dust contains an [[Iridium Inlaid Band]].
