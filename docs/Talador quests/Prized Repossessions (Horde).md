== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Gordunni "Toothpick's" from [[Gordunni Basher]]s or [[Gordunni Cleaver]]s within [[Gordal Fortress]].
*[[Gordunni "Toothpick"]] (6)

== Description ==
The Gordunni were given copies of my blades as a gift from the Iron Horde. But what do they use them for? Toothpicks!

Sure the blades are low grade copies but it's still MY design and I can't stand to think of them in those ogre hands for a moment longer!

<Sir/Ma'am>, While we are in here can you do me a favor and get those blades out of their hands!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*20 [[Garrison Resources]]
*{{cost|13}}
* 14250 XP

== Progress ==
Were you able to get all of my blades back?

== Completion ==
Thank you, commander. With this another stain on my honor has been removed.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Supply Recovery (Horde)]] and [[Punching Through (Horde)]] before heading out.

''On accept of all three, Morketh joins the party'':
:{{text|say|Morketh Bladehowl|Let's do this!}}
Start killing ogres to acquire their maces. Crates of Iron Horde Shipments litter the ground, so interact with one to launch a flare and summon one of Gazlowe's copters to pick it up.

Inside the fortress, keep an eye out for rare hydra [[Gennadian]], which drops the [[Scales of Gennadian]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]]. Also, in the fourth tower (the one immediately to the northeast of the [[Throne of the Witch Lord]]), find an [[Iron Box]] which contains a [[Gordunni Skullthumper]] and roughly {{cost|15}}.
