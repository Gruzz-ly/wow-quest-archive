==Objectives==
Rescue 8 Injured Miners.
*[[Injured Miner]]s Saved (8)

==Description==
Not all of the [[draenei]] miners made it out when the chaos erupted, <name>. Many of them are injured and still trapped inside the [[Jorune Mine|mine]].

[[Kaelynara Sunchaser|Kaelynara's]] disruption has caused all hell to break loose. [[Arcane Wraith]]s are forming from the unleashed energy and attacking everything they see. [[Crystal Rager|The elementals]] that slumbered beneath the ground are emerging from the rocks frenzied and dangerous.

Please find as many injured miners as you can and ensure that they return safely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*16350 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you returned the injured miners to safety?

==Completion==
Thank you for getting the workers our{{sic}} of the mine safely, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Arcane Essence (quest)]] before heading out.

Drop to the lower level and target [[Crystal Rager]]s and [[Arcane Wraith]]s that are actively attacking [[Injured Miner]]s to attempt to get credit for both quests at the same time.

==Progression==
{{Jorune Mine}}
