==Description==
Witch Lord Morkurk is the leader of the Gordunni. We need to kill him to secure the jovite for use in our artillery tower.

Morkurk is an accomplished mage so you better be prepared. Here, take the rocket pack and use it if you need to avoid any of his deadly magic.

Archenon poros!

==Completion==
Fine work commander! Your combat skills are clearly second to none. I am honored to be your armorer!

Let's get back to the outpost so we can take stock of our new inventory. I saved a few flares to call us in a ride back.

==Notes==
Head southwest to the [[Throne of the Witch Lord]] to find [[Witch Lord Morkurk]]. Aggro him and he will pull all comers to his position and wall off the exit to the platform.
