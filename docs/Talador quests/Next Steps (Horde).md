==Objectives==
Speak to [[Magister Krelas]] at [[Vol'jin's Pride]].

==Description==
You are positively on fire!

We have everything I need to create the scroll. Your arcane sanctum will be brimming with arcane energy in no time.

I will teleport to Vol'jin's Pride to combine the reagents and marshal your forces. Meet me there when you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|30}}
*1400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Your forces burn with passion for your cause.

Not easy against such towering foes. Well done.

==Notes==

:{{text|say|Magister Krelas|I will go to your outpost to make the scroll. Meet me there when you can.}}

Before exiting camp, some side quests have opened up: [[Shadow Hunter Kajassa]] starts [[One Step Ahead]], starting the "The Battle for Shattrath" chapter of the [[Talador storyline]], and [[Beastmaster Tagh]] has some bounties available. Consider picking up those quests, as Morketh has moved to the opposite side of the zone, way down to the south.

;On approach
:{{text|say|Magister Krelas|Keep your weapons hot. You're going to be teleporting straight into hell.}}
