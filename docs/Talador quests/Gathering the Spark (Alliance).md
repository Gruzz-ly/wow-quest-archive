==Objectives==
Harvest 3 [[Arcane Vortex (Talador)|Arcane Vortexes]] in [[Zangarra]].
*Energy harvested (3)

==Description==
We need arcane energy to complete our scroll. It needs that to coalesce the scroll together.

I have an artifact that can capture energy vortexes in the caldera below, so let's get moving.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
* 14250 [[XP]]
*20x [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
This is why I love [[magic]].  It's so... refreshing.

==Completion==
Perfect! We should have plenty of energy now.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Creating the Ink (Alliance)]] and [[Forming the Scroll (Alliance)]] before heading out. After picking up all three:
:{{text|say|Magister Serena|Ready when you are!}}
:''Serena joins the party and buffs everyone with Arcane Brilliance: Increases critical strike chance by 5%. Only works in Zangarra and Gordal Fortress.''

Head out into Zangarra, killing [[Invasive Shambler]]s and [[Encroaching Giant]]s, looting [[Slumbering Protector]]s, and finding Arcane Vortexes.

On the east side of the caldera, way down low, find rare spore walker [[No'losh]].
