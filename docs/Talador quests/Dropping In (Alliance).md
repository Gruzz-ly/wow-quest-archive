==Objectives==
Help [[Magister Serena]] destroy 3 Gordunni Boulderthrowers.
*Catapults destroyed (3)
*Meet Serena at the gate {{co|69.0|69.4|Talador}}
*Portal taken {{co|69.2|69.4|Talador}}

==Description==
[[Witch Lord Morkurk]], the leader of the fortress, has catapults set up along the road into their compound.

That won't be a problem for us.

Take out the ogres around the catapults and mark them for me. This vortex spell I have prepared will handle the rest.

We'll meet at the gate to the fortress once the catapults are gone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|30}}
*1400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We have the scroll of mass teleportation ready, but we can't use it just yet. We must take proper precautions to ensure our success.

==Notes==
Clear out [[Gordunni Basher]]s or [[Gordunni Cleaver]]s guarding the catapults, then interact with them to mark the catapult for destruction.

After the third catapult has been cleared, keep moving east up the hill and aggro a Gordunni Cleaver:
:{{text|yell|Gordunni Cleaver 1|Intruders approach the keep! To arms!}}
:''Two more run in.''
:{{text|yell|Gordunni Cleaver 2|For Morkuk! For the empire!}}
At the top of the hill, Serena will port in as the path is blocked:
:{{text|say|Magister Serena|How quaint. A wall! The [[Gordunni tribe|Gordunni]] really have been disconnected from the empire for too long.}}
:{{text|say|Magister Serena|This ought to get us over!}}
:''Serena conjures a portal.''
Take it. On the other side...
:{{text|say|Magister Serena|Being a mage does have its perks!}}

==Progression==
