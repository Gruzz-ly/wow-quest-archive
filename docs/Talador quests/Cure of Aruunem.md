== Objectives ==
Collect 60 Aruunem Berries from around [[Duskfall Island]].
* [[Aruunem Berries]] (60)

== Description ==
I need your help in creating an elixir that will allow us passage into the realm of the dead.

In order to create it I require a sampling of the local vegetation. You will find Aruunem berries scattered about on the island. Bring me as many as you can carry.

Be warned, <name>: do not eat them raw! The poison in the berries would kill you within minutes!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|13|40}}

== Progress ==
Have you collected enough Aruunem berries?

== Completion ==
I'm glad you did not eat any berries. I'm not sure what I would do if you were to die.

==Progression==
