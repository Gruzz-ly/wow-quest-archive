==Objectives==
Slay Wing-Guard Kuuan in [[Veil Shadar]].
*[[Wing-Guard Kuuan]] slain {{co|80.3|64.1|Talador}}

==Description==
I was a wing-guard myself, once upon a time.

One afternoon, I was caught away from my post. I just wanted an hour to watch the festival... Kuuan was supposed to cover for me, but instead he sold me out to gain favor with our superiors.

They plucked my eyes, broke my wings, and threw me off the spire.

Yet I am the fortunate one, for if Iskar hadn't found me, I'd have died there. And now Kuuan shows his face in Veil Shadar on the same day that you show up willing to kill for coin. Fortunate, indeed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40}}
*13400 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
Kuuan must be taking great joy in pillaging Veil Shadar. He has no idea that he sealed his fate the day he crossed Kura.

==Completion==
Speaking of fortune, count yourself lucky that I was not among the defenders in Aruuna, for you'd have seen both ends of your guts before you laid eyes on the Fire-Sage.

Ah, sometimes I miss those days.

Here is your coin.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Purge of Veil Shadar]] and [[Forbidden Knowledge]] before heading out.

Southeast to [[Veil Shadar]]. Keep killing arakkoa for [[Burning Sky]] if necessary. Speak with [[Outcast Darktalon]] to send them on their way. Find various books on such enlightening topics as:
*Act Like a Crone, Think Like a Sage
*Augury Without Bounds
*Basketweaving the Sinister Way
*Curses: A Practical Guide
*Eat, Scry, Love
*What Exactly is Scrying Anyway?
...and more in tents and on rocks in [[Veil Shadar]]. At the eastern end of the quest area, in a cave just uphill, find [[Wing-Guard Kuuan]].

By this point, the quota for [[Burning Sky]] should be filled, so turn in those quests just to the north of Wing-Guard Kuuan's cave closer to Aruuna.

This quest completes the "The Plight of the Arakkoa" chapter of [[Don't Let the Tala-door Hit You on the Way Out]]. The [[Talador storyline]] continues back at [[Fort Wrynn]] or [[Vol'jin's Pride]] at level 95 with [[Speaker for the Dead (Talador)]] or [[The Lady of Light]], respectively.
