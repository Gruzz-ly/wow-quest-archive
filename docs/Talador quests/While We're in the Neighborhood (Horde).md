==Objectives==
Collect 10 Gordunni Runebeads.
*[[Gordunni Runebeads]] (10)

==Description==
Ah, the hubris of ogres.

It always backfires.

Morkurk has been using enchanted bracelets to empower his minions with arcane strength.

We can disenchant these bracelets into reagents that will no doubt be useful to your arcane sanctum. What do you think about collecting some while we're here?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14250 [[XP]]
*40x [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
Most mages discount the use of arcane dust these days, but they're wrong.

==Completion==
Yes, these will definitely be useful! Trust me.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Vicious Viziers (Horde)]] and [[Orbs of Power (Horde)]] before heading out. As at [[Zangarra]], Krelas will join the party after picking up all three.

''On accept of all three, Krelas joins the party'':
:{{text|say|Magister Krelas|I'm going to enjoy this.}}
Get to killing [[Gordunni Basher]]s and [[Gordunni Cleaver]]s for their [[Gordunni Runebeads]], destroying Astral Wards, and taking out the named mobs.

Inside the fortress, keep an eye out for rare hydra [[Gennadian]], which drops the [[Scales of Gennadian]] and 20-30x [[Garrison Resources]]. Also, in the fourth tower (the one immediately to the northeast of the [[Throne of the Witch Lord]]), find an [[Iron Box]] which contains a [[Gordunni Skullthumper]] and roughly {{cost|15}}.

==Progression==
