== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Arkonite Crystals and an Arkonite Pylon from the [[Tomb of Lights]].
*[[Arkonite Crystal]] x6
*[[Arkonite Pylon]] {{co|31.8|48.7|Tomb of Lights}}

== Description ==
We came here to retrieve a reserve pylon to power [[Auchindoun (alternate universe)|Auchindoun's]] defenses, but we've been pinned to this position by the [[Shadow Council (alternate universe)|Shadow Council]] for hours!

I need to get these injured back to [[Exarch's Refuge]], but we still need the backup system!

Please, gather Arkonite crystals and an Arkonite pylon from the tomb and meet me at the refuge as quickly as you can!

''On accept:''
:{{text|say|Soulbinder Tuulani|I'll lead the wounded to safety. Cover our escape!}}

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 16350 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Progress ==
''On approach:''
: {{text|say|Soulbinder Tuulani|Don't give up, soulbinders.  Auchindoun must be protected!}}

Do you have the arkonite pylon and the crystals?

== Completion ==
Light bless you, hero! We need to hold out as long as we can so [[Soulbinder Nyami|Nyami]] can track down the remaining power shards. This pylon will help take the load off of our soulpriests.

== Notes ==
There is one crystal in this room along the south wall. Exit the room. In the central sanctum, [[Yuuri]], the head caretaker, calls out for help:
:{{text|say|Yuuri|P-please... somebody... anybody...}}
He offers [[Nightmare in the Tomb]]. There is one crystal in this room, and one just on the other side of the door behind Yuuri. Head to the southeast hall and take out [[Tagar Spinebreaker]], then head to the western room to find the Arkonite Pylon and three more crystals along the walls.

==Trivia==
The title of this quest is a reference to Blizzard's [[StarCraft franchise|''StarCraft'' franchise]]. In the ''StarCraft'' video games, a Protoss player is told that they must construct additional pylons when they attempt to build a unit without having the necessary amount of psi (supply), a resource provided by pylons. The phrase also became an [http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-must-construct-additional-pylons internet meme].
