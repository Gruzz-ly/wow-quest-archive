==Objectives==
Recover 6 Iron Horde Shipments.
*Iron Horde Shipments Obtained (6)

==Description==
We seem to have arrived at just the right time!

The Gordunni have been enchanting armaments for the [[Iron Horde]] and it looks like they haven't picked up the latest shipment.

We could put that gear to far better use in our artillery tower! Lets go hunt down their shipping containers. I brought some signal flares that we can use to call in an air pick-up when we've secured the shipment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14250 [[XP]]
*20 [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
Thaelin said that the flares will surely get his copters' attention. I hope those contraptions actually work.

==Completion==
Alright, that should be the last one we need.

It isn't the same as retaking [[Shattrath]], but knowing the Iron Horde won't be getting these supplies gives me a bit of satisfaction.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Prized Repossessions (Alliance)]] and [[Punching Through (Alliance)]] before heading out.

''On accept of all three, Miall joins the party'':
:{{text|say|Miall|Let's do this!}}
Start killing ogres to acquire their maces. Crates of Iron Horde Shipments litter the ground, so interact with one to launch a flare and summon one of Thaelin's copters to pick it up.

Inside the fortress, keep an eye out for rare hydra [[Gennadian]], which drops the [[Scales of Gennadian]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]]. Also, in the fourth tower (the one immediately to the northeast of the [[Throne of the Witch Lord]]), find an [[Iron Box]] which contains a [[Gordunni Skullthumper]] and roughly {{cost|15}}.
