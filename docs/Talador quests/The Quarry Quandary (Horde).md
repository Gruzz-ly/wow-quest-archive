==Objectives==
Obtain [[Morketh Bladehowl]]'s assistance.

==Description==
Now that our arsenal is built we need a skilled smith to operate it.

We recently caught an [[Iron Horde]] deserter who claims he used to be one of the {{Au|Blackrock clan|Blackrock}}'s best iron workers.

Normally I'd ignore the ravings of a captive, but the weapons we took out of his pack had the finest workmanship I've ever seen.

Commander, I think we should see if he's as good as he claims.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|30}}
*1450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You're the one in charge around here, right? I've heard the guards talk about your exploits and if I wasn't looking at you now I'd swear they were lying.

I've only ever wanted to make the finest blades and put them in the hands of the strongest of fighters. I can tell already that you're exactly the type I want to carry my weapons.

If you can give me a chance I swear you will not be disappointed.

==Notes==
[[Morketh Bladehowl]] is near the exit of the settlement caged up.
