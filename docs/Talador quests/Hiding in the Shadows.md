==Objectives==
Destroy [[Shadow Orb (Talador)|Shadow Orbs]] in [[Gul'rok]].
*Eastern Shadow Orb {{co|37.8|77.4|Talador}}
*Southern Shadow Orb {{co|35.6|79.8|Talador}}
*Northern Shadow Orb {{co|34.5|70.4|Talador}}

==Description==
''On approach''
:{{text|say|Shadowborne Dementor|Yes, Gul'dan. Your will be done.}}

<The voice of Teron'gor enters your mind.>

Our final move must remain concealed from the Auchenai, my minions. Use the shadow orbs Gul'dan provided for us to veil Gul'rok in darkness.

Prepare our forces, we march on Auchindoun on my order. We will feast on the souls of the draenei and usher our demonic allies into this world!

<Destroying these shadow orbs would help the defenders at Auchindoun greatly.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 16350 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Completion==
Without the shadow orbs, the main Auchenai force will be able to march on Gul'rok safely.

==Notes==
In [[Gul'rok]] for [[Retribution for the Light]] and [[Into the Heart of Madness]], find the [[Shadow Council Communicator]] at the southeast end of the quest area. The shadow orbs for this quest are on the top deck of guard towers. The closest is 50 yards to the notheast. A hundred or so yards north of the eastern tower, inside a small cave, is rare warp stalker [[Viperlash]], which drops the [[Warpstalker-Scale Grips]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]].

Loop back to the southwest and head uphill to find the Southern Shadow Orb tower. Cut across the camp to the north on the way to the Northern Shadow Orb tower, noticing [[Kor'thos Dawnfury]] strung up on a hide near the bonfire. Pick up [[Book Burning]] from him and now start killing [[Shadowborne Dementor]]s to loot their [[Shadow Council Spellbook]]. Don't forget about the dementor guarding the north shadow orb! After destroying the third orb, Hiding in the Shadows will complete automatically.
