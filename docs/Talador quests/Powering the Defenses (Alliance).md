==Objectives==
Find [[Soulbinder Tuulani]] in the {{Au|Tomb of Lights}}.

==Description==
What few soulpriests we don't have on the front lines are working fervently to maintain {{Au|Auchindoun}}'s defenses. They aren't going to be able to keep it up much longer alone.

Soulbinder Tuulani went inside the nearby Tomb of Lights to retrieve a backup power pylon and hasn't returned. I need you to find her and get her and the pylon back here safely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|90}}
* 8200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Completion==
You look like you can fight. We need to get out of here!

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{text|yell|Soulbinder Tuulani|Hold your ground. We have to protect the wounded!}}

Pick up [[Holding the Line (Alliance)]], [[The Heart of Auchindoun]], and [[Disrupting the Flow]] before heading out. [[Every Bit Counts (Alliance)]] is a side quest and not part of the main storyline.

Follow the path eastward and enter the tomb at {{co|30|33|Talador}} just southeast of the [[Burning Front]]. At the bottom of the stairs, take the first left. Ignore the Shadow Infiltrators and Pillagers coming out of the portal to reach

==Progression==
{{In the Shadows of Auchindoun}}
