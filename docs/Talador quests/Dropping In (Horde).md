==Objectives==
Help [[Magister Krelas]] destroy 3 Gordunni Boulderthrowers.
*Catapults destroyed (3)
*Meet Krelas at the gate {{co|69.0|69.4|Talador}}
*Portal taken {{co|69.2|69.4|Talador}}

==Description==
[[Witch Lord Morkurk]] is no fool.

He has catapults set up throughout the foothills leading into their compound.

No matter, I have a way to handle them.

Take out the ogres guarding the siege weapons and mark them once they're clear. I'm readying a vortex spell that will handle things from there.

We'll meet just outside their gate afterwards.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|30}}
*1400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Before we take on Morkurk we have some business to attend to in the fortress proper.

==Notes==
Clear out [[Gordunni Basher]]s or [[Gordunni Cleaver]]s guarding the catapults, then interact with them to mark the catapult for destruction.

After the third catapult has been cleared, keep moving east up the hill and aggro a Gordunni Cleaver:
:{{text|yell|Gordunni Cleaver 1|Intruders approach the keep! To arms!}}
:''Two more run in.''
:{{text|yell|Gordunni Cleaver 2|For Morkuk! For the empire!}}
At the top of the hill, Serena will port in as the path is blocked:
:{{text|say|Magister Krelas|The [[Gordunni tribe|Gordunni]] have been disconnected from the empire for too long. They really think a wall can stop us?}}
:{{text|say|Magister Krelas|There we go! Let's, shall we?}}
:''Serena conjures a portal.''
Take it. On the other side...
:{{text|say|Magister Krelas|Now, where were we?}}

==Progression==
