== Objectives ==
Collect 7 Handfuls of Duskwing Dust from the Duskwing Moths on [[Duskfall Island]].
* [[Handful of Duskwing Dust]] (7)

== Description ==
I thought if I could just bring him here that I might be able to correct his transgression against the Light. That perhaps I could save my son! Now my beloved [[Arumel]] is a twisted phantasm.

I'm left with no choice but to right my wrongs and I need your help.

Bring me duskwing dust from the moths on Duskfall Island. With your aid I can craft an elixir that will let us travel to the realm of the dead and lay Arumel to rest.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|13|40}}

== Progress ==
Do you have enough dust?

== Completion ==
Thank you, <name>. With this dust and Aruunem berries I will craft the draught of the dead.

== Notes ==
Dust drops from {{NPC||Duskwing Flutterer}}, {{NPC||Elder Duskwing}} and {{NPC||Agitated Duskwing}}.

==Progression==
