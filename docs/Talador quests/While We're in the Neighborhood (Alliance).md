==Objectives==
Collect 8 Gordunni Runebeads.
*[[Gordunni Runebeads]] (8)

==Description==
[[Ogre]]s from the empire are known for being cold and calculating.

We are fortunate that their calculations are rarely spot on.

[[Witch Lord Morkurk|Morkurk]] has been using enchanted bracelets to empower his minions with arcane strength.

Since we're going to have to dispatch them anyways, we might as well get some reagents out of it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14250 [[XP]]
*40x [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
Ah, [[Arcane Powder|arcane powder]]. Reminds me of my days as an apprentice.

==Completion==
They're not amazing, but I do think these have some worth to us.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Vicious Viziers (Alliance)]] and [[Orbs of Power (Alliance)]] before heading out. As at [[Zangarra]], Serena will join the party after picking up all three.

''On accept of all three, Serena joins the party'':
:{{text|say|Magister Serena|Let's do this!}}
Get to killing [[Gordunni Basher]]s and [[Gordunni Cleaver]]s for their [[Gordunni Runebeads]], destroying Astral Wards, and taking out the named mobs.

Inside the fortress, keep an eye out for rare hydra [[Gennadian]], which drops the [[Scales of Gennadian]] and 20-30x [[Garrison Resources]]. Also, in the fourth tower (the one immediately to the northeast of the [[Throne of the Witch Lord]]), find an [[Iron Box]] which contains a [[Gordunni Skullthumper]] and roughly {{cost|15}}.

==Progression==
{{Talador mage tower}}
