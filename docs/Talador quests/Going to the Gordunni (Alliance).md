==Objectives==
Travel to [[Gordal Fortress]] and meet up with {{Au|Miall}}.

==Description==
We have a good supply of jovite now but there just isn't enough of the material in the mine to keep the artillery tower in stock for long. Down south of here there's a mountain that's just full of the stuff but there's one problem; Ogres!

The Gordunni live on top of that mountain and they have begun trading the jovite to the [[Iron Horde]].

We need to go down there and secure the minerals for ourselves.

I'll pack some supplies and meet you near their fortress down south.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|30}}
*1450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I crafted a few things before we left that we may need: some smoke grenades, a grappling hook, even was able to get [[Thaelin Darkanvil|Thaelin]] to throw together a rocket pack.

I'm sure we'll find a use for everything.

==Notes==
Before exiting camp, some side quests have opened up: [[Sloan McCoy]] starts [[One Step Ahead]], starting the "The Battle for Shattrath" chapter of the [[Talador storyline]], [[Patrick Messer]] has some bounties available, and [[Quartermaster O'Riley]] has another chain starting with [[Why Is The Brew Gone?]]. Consider picking up some of those quests, as Miall has moved to the opposite side of the zone, way down to the south.
