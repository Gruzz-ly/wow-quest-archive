{{questportrait|An'dure the Awakened.jpg|An'dure the Awakened|The eighth wonder of Draenor.}}
Retrieve the Crystal Giant Heart.
*[[Crystal Giant Heart]] {{co|54.2|50.1|Talador}}

== Description ==
In order to break through [[Kaelynara Sunchaser|Kaelynara's]] arcane shield, we will need a focusing crystal of rare power and quality.

Within the mine is a [[Colossus|crystal giant]] known to the Draenei as [[An'dure the Awakened|An'dure]]. The giant has slept far beneath the earth for ages, but due to Kaelynara's recklessness it has awakened.

The heart of a crystal giant is a truly powerful artifact. Defeat An'Dure{{sic}} and return to me with a crystal giant heart.

When you return I will construct the focusing crystal and together we will stop Kaelynara.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: 55 [[Garrison Resources]] and {{cost|13|80}}

== Progress ==
Do you have the crystal giant heart?

== Completion ==
It is sad to see such a mighty creature fall, but An'dure was a danger to all within the mine. The heart of the crystal giant will aid us in restorting peace to the [[Jorune Mine]].

== Gains ==
* 16350 XP

== Notes ==
Back down to the southeast.

* The quest title is a reference to the WWF wrestler André the Giant. He called himself and was sometimes referred to as "The Eighth Wonder of the World".
