*[[Witch Lord Morkurk]] slain {{co|64.1|81.8|Talador}}
*[[Fury of the Forge]]
*[[Emergency Rocket Pack]] (provided)

==Description==
Witch Lord Morkurk is the leader of the Gordunni. He's the one that set up the Iron Horde trade and, even worse, my former boss gave him one of my best maces!

We got to get my mace back! I mean... we need to kill him to secure the jovite for your arsenal!

Morkurk is an accomplished mage so you better be prepared. Here, take the rocket pack and use it if you need to dodge an attack quickly or something.

Also, if you happen to find my mace I'd like to get it back.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 548 helms|Sha'tari Keeper Helm|Auchenai Keeper Hood|Sha'tari Deadeye Helm|Talador Sentinel Helm}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|13}}
* 14250 XP

==Progress==
Do you have my mace?

==Completion==
Fine work commander! Your combat skills are clearly second to none. I am honored to be your armorer!

Let's get back to the outpost so we can take stock of our new inventory. I saved a few flares to call us in a ride back.

==Notes==
Head southwest to the [[Throne of the Witch Lord]] to find [[Witch Lord Morkurk]]. Aggro him and he will pull all comers to his position and wall off the exit to the platform.
