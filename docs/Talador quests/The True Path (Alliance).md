==Completion==
I have never seen anyone fight like that.

I am regrettably in no condition now to join the [[Auchenai (alternate universe)|Auchenai]] in defending [[Auchindoun (alternate universe)|Auchindoun]].  I have heard stories of your fortress in {{Au|Shadowmoon Valley}}.  Could I go there and repair my armor?

Perhaps... I could stay there a while longer than that?  I feel there is much you could teach me.

==Rewards==
You will gain these followers: Follower: {{Au|Defender Illona}}
