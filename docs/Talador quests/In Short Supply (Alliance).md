==Objectives==
Collect 6 Iron Horde Explosives.
*[[Iron Horde Explosives]] (6)

==Description==
The [[Iron Horde]] has explosive devices stored throughout the heart of their [[lumber mill|logging camp]].

We must recover them so they are not used against us.

I will keep an eye on [[Vindicator Maraad|Maraad]]... I worry for him in his anger.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40}}
*{{cost|gr=50}}
*16150 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Have you found the Iron Horde Explosives yet?

==Completion==
I believe we can use those explosives against the Iron Horde.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Too Many Irons in the Fire (Alliance)]] and [[Thaelin's Quick Fix (quest)]] before heading out.

Southwest to [[Mor'gran Logworks]]. The Thunderlord Cache is in the northeastern extent of the quest area and the log storage area is at the northwestern extent, with [[Redemption Rise]], an Alliance flight path, between them. Just northwest of Redemption Rise, a [[Fallen Draenei Defender]] and a dead [[Iron Engineer]] are a few yards from some [[Iron Shredder Decommission Orders]]. Interact with the orders to pick up [[Decommissioned Mission (Alliance)]], a mandatory short side quest to unlock a shredder.

Enter the main camp, down south by the water to find the forge. Plenty of crates of [[Iron Horde Explosives]] are found in the main camp as well.

Turn in up at [[Redemption Rise]].
