==Objectives==
Look through Gazlowe's Eye 'n' Ear.
*Look through [[Gazlowe's Eye 'n' Ear]].

==Description==
Your allies sent along a [[goblin]], [[Gazlowe]], to advise us against the [[Iron Horde]]. Thus far, he has proven a valuable asset.

He has a looking glass set up that can see a great distance and, he claims, even hear.

Use this looking glass and report back what you've seen. I will stick to my standard spyglass.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40}}
*16150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Take a look through Gazlowe's Eye 'n' Ear.

==Completion==
{{Au|Orgrim Doomhammer|Orgrim}} leads these [[orc]]s? Why has he pledged himself to the [[Iron Horde]]?
