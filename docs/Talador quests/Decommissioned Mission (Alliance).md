== Objectives ==
Kill Engineer Trak and recover the Decommissioned Iron Shredder.
* [[Engineer Trak]] slain {{co|63.0|23.7|Talador}}
* [[Decommissioned Iron Shredder]] Stolen {{co|63.2|23.7|Talador}}
* Decommissioned Iron Shredder Transported to Redemption Rise

== Description ==
[[Ketya Shrediron]],

Your new Iron Shredders are a menace to our own soldiers.

Decommission the prototype and store it out of the way until you've worked out the kinks.

I will send Engineer Trak to work on it in the meantime.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40}}
* 16150 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Progress ==
Have you recovered that shredder?

== Completion ==
A prototype Iron Shredder, huh?! I bet we can get this thing working... they didn't have [[Thaelin Darkanvil]] to fix it!

== Notes ==
While in the area for [[Too Many Irons in the Fire (Alliance)]] and [[In Short Supply (Alliance)]], find the [[Iron Shredder Decommission Orders]] on a hill just west of [[Redemption Rise]], north of [[Mor'gran Logworks]].

Trak is to the northeast, up the stairs. Before taking Trak out, however, enter the building to find rare elite orc [[Underseer Bloodmane]], with his [[Prize]] talbuk. Kill them for [[Prize's Horn-Ring]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]], then head back outside, kill [[Engineer Trak]], and hop in the [[Decommissioned Iron Shredder]]. Alas, it's two abilities have been disabled, so quickly turn in to [[Thaelin Darkanvil]] at Redemption Rise. He'll have it ready for use in a few quests.
