== Objectives ==
Recover the Telmor Registry, the Auchenai Prayerbook, and Leafshadow in Telmor.
*[[Telmor Registry]] {{co|49.3|87.8|Talador}}
*[[Auchenai Prayerbook]] {{co|49.3|90.8|Talador}}
*[[Leafshadow]] {{co|47.5|88.9|Talador}}

== Description ==
We had to escape Telmor with what few we could save.

Someone disabled Leafshadow's cloaking field; I know not who, but I suspect it had to have been one of our own.

We will retrieve our livelihoods in time, but we cannot risk losing our sacred artifacts.

If you are able, bring Leafshadow, our town registry, and our prayerbook to safety.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 16350 XP
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Progress ==
Some things are worth fighting for, <race>. These are such things.

== Completion ==
With these, we can account for our fallen and rebuild. We will persevere.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Restalaan, Captain of the Guard]] and [[Payback]] before heading out.

Enter Telmor and take the first right. On the north side of the path is the [[Telmor Registry]], and on the opposite side is a [[Hastily Written Note]], which starts [[Invasion of the Soul Eaters]]. Pick up an Auchenai Torch from the forge to the right of the Telmor Registry, then head southeast to find the first body pile. The second body pile is opposite the central water fixture, and the third and fourth are in the courtyard to the south. After burning the fourth, Invasion of the Soul Eaters completes automatically.

Inside a building on the southeast side of the mid-level courtyard, find the [[Auchenai Prayerbook]], and the [[Leafshadow]] Crystal is found in the building on northwest side of the same courtyard.

Head southwest to the upper courtyard and enter the westernmost building to find [[Restalaan]] just inside. Turn in and pick up [[The Final Piece (Talador)]].
