==Objectives==
Speak to [[Lady Liadrin]] at the [[Burning Front]] in [[Talador]].

==Description==
<Name>, yes? You are the one in charge here? I am [[Knight-Lord Dranarus]], at your service.

Lady Liadrin has responded to a suspected [[demon]] presence near {{Au|Auchindoun}}, southwest of here. She has asked specifically for your assistance in ensuring Auchindoun does not fall into {{Au|Gul'dan}}'s hands.

If you could set forth at your nearest convenience, I am sure the Lady would be most grateful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|34|}}

==Completion==
We'll have to catch up later. We have bigger problems!
