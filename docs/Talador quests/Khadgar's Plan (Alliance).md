==Objectives==
Speak with [[Archmage Khadgar|Khadgar]] near the gates of {{Au|Shattrath City|Shattrath}}.

Shattrath must not fall into the hands of the [[Iron Horde]]. It is time again for me to get my hands bloody.

We will tell Khadgar we are ready to enter the city and take back what is rightfully ours.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40}}
*16,150 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Completion==
You have done great work with Maraad, Yrel, and [[Thaelin Darkanvil|Thaelin]].

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Yrel|Let us make haste to Khadgar and the others.}}
:''Yrel, Thaelin Darkanvil and Maraad mount up and ride down to the road towards the gates.''

Take the path southeast past [[Mor'gran Logworks]] and the [[Archenon Siegeyard]] one last time. Outside Shattrath, [[Archmage Khadgar]], [[Thrall]], [[Yrel]], [[Vindicator Maraad]], {{Au|Draka}}, and {{Au|Durotan}} are all standing around a table with a map of Draenor on it. Speak with Khadgar.
