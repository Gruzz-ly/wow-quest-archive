== Objectives ==
Find [[Restalaan (alternate universe)|Restalaan]] in [[Telmor (alternate universe)|Telmor]].

== Description ==
They killed [[Soulbinder Aedraa|Aedraa]] and took the crystal from her! The captain of the guard, Restalaan, tried to stop them and they took him into the cathedral!

If we can just get this crystal, we can reunite the Heart of Auchindoun and turn its defenses on fully! We can't afford to fail now.

<Name>, you're the only one left that can do it. You have to find Restalaan! He'll know where they took it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 16350 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Completion ==
There's no time for pleasantries. The raid's leader is just ahead.

== Notes ==
Pick up [Never Forget]] and [[Payback]] before heading out.

Enter Telmor and take the first right. On the north side of the path is the [[Telmor Registry]], and on the opposite side is a [[Hastily Written Note]], which starts [[Invasion of the Soul Eaters]]. Pick up an Auchenai Torch from the forge to the right of the Telmor Registry, then head southeast to find the first body pile. The second body pile is opposite the central water fixture, and the third and fourth are in the courtyard to the south. After burning the fourth, Invasion of the Soul Eaters completes automatically.

Inside a building on the southeast side of the mid-level courtyard, find the [[Auchenai Prayerbook]], and the [[Leafshadow]] Crystal is found in the building on northwest side of the same courtyard.

Head southwest to the upper courtyard and enter the westernmost building to find Restalaan just inside. Turn in and pick up [[The Final Piece (Talador)]].
