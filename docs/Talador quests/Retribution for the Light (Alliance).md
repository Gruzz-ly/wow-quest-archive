== Objectives ==
Kill 15 demons in [[Gul'rok]].
*[[Demon]]s slain x15

== Description ==
There are agents of darkness everywhere, fighting tooth and nail to envelop the world. The [[Light]] relies on us to balance the scale.

You have the power needed to destroy [[Teron'gor]]'s demonic minions once and for all. Send them to the [[Twisting Nether]] in pieces!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 16350 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Progress ==
Are Teron'gor's foul demonic minions fleeing to the Twisting Nether with their tails between their legs?

== Completion ==
Already I can feel the Light triumphing over darkness. We've done it!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Into the Heart of Madness]] before heading out.

To the west, this time, to reach Gul'rok. Try very hard to not kill any creatures unnecessarily, as plenty will be put in the way between other quest objectives. Just inside the southeastern extent of the quest area, find a [[Shadow Council Communicator]], which offers [[Hiding in the Shadows]]. The shadow orbs for that quest are on the top deck of guard towers. The closest is 50 yards to the notheast. A hundred or so yards north of the eastern tower, inside a small cave, is rare warp stalker [[Viperlash]], which drops the [[Warpstalker-Scale Grips]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]].

Loop back to the southwest and head uphill to find the Southern Shadow Orb tower. Cut across the camp to the north on the way to the Northern Shadow Orb tower, noticing [[Kor'thos Dawnfury]] strung up on a hide near the bonfire. Pick up [[Book Burning]] from him and now start killing [[Shadowborne Dementor]]s to loot their [[Shadow Council Spellbook]]. Don't forget about the dementor guarding the north shadow orb! After destroying the third orb, Hiding in the Shadows will complete automatically.

Gather three books, then click on the bonfire near Kor'thos to burn them. By this point, the kill quest should be done, so from Kor'thos's position, head west up the hill to find [[Soulbinder Nyami]] at the [[Seat of Depravity]], holding a Demonic Gateway open.
