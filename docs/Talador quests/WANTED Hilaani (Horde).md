==Objectives==
Kill [[Hilaani]] and bring the Pile of Riverbeast Meat to Patrick Messer.
*[[Pile of Riverbeast Meat]]
*Suggested players: 3

==Description==
We need more meat, commander.

I know what you're thinking. What about all of that meat right behind me?

That's the problem. It'll be gone in a day if we're lucky.

There's a riverbeast that lives in the lake to the south. Locals call her Hilaani. Massive, lots of meat.

If you would take down the beast and bring me her meat, your wolves will be better off for it.
