== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Soulbinder Tuulani]] outside [[Telmor (alternate universe)|Telmor]].

== Description ==
You're proven yourself more than capable in battle, <name>. As you know, there may be [[Shadow Council (alternate universe)|Shadow Council]] forces anywhere around [[Auchindoun (alternate universe)|Auchindoun]], including near Telmor.

Tuulani's powers as a soulpriest have not yet fully manifested; she isn't capable of protecting the shard alone. I need you to join her at Telmor to make sure the crystal makes it to Auchindoun safely.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 16350 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Completion ==
It's not safe here. The Shadow Council has already taken the city!

== Notes ==
Southwest along the rim of Auchindoun, taking the first left to the south. On the way is rare [[Draenor ancient]] [[Felbark]], which drops [[Felbark's Skin]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]].

Telemor has been taken by the Shadow Council, but Soulbinder Tuulani is just outside.

==Progression==
{{In the Shadows of Auchindoun}}
