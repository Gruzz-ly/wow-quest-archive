==Objectives==
Speak to Morketh Bladehowl inside of Vol'jin's Pride in Talador.
*Follow Morketh to the Armory

==Description==
Thank you... boss.

I won't let you down! I didn't even try to sneak one of those low quality blades here that one of your peons placed right next to the cage. Which by the way was a pretty terrible idea and that thing should be moved before you get anyone less honorable in here.

Enough talk, lets check this place out!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|30}}
*1450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We have a lot of basic arms here but I'll get them improved in no time.

Thanks for giving me this chance.
