Wow... I've never seen anyone fight like that. That was... impressive.

I'm in no shape to join [[Lady Liadrin]] and the others at [[Auchindoun (alternate universe)|Auchindoun]] now. You have an entire fortress on this world, though. Could I go there and rest awhile? Maybe repair my armor?

I'll stick around and join your forces as a token of my gratitude. Liadrin won't mind... we're all on the same team, right?
