==Objectives==
Retrieve the Crystal-Shaper's Tools, Melani's Doll, and the Annals of Aruuna.
*[[Crystal-Shaper's Tools]] {{co|75.7|44.4|Talador}}
*[[Melani's Doll]] {{co|77.9|43.0|Talador}}
*[[Annals of Aruuna]] {{co|78.2|43.8|Talador}}

==Description==
When the fires broke out, I took only my daughter's hand before we fled. It was the right decision, of course, but I do long for some of the things we left behind.

I am an artificer, a shaper of crystals and gems. Without my tools I am just another refugee.

Our town records are kept in a memory crystal in the main hall. With it, I can carry forward the knowledge and legacy of Aruuna.

Also, my daughter is terrified - it would be a great comfort for her to hold her favorite doll again.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 547 shoulders|Talador Sentinel Spaulders|Sha'tari Keeper Shoulders|Auchenai Keeper Mantle|Sha'tari Deadeye Monnion}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|40}}
*14400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
These are more than mere objects. They are our livelihood, our past and future, our comfort.

They are pieces of us.

==Completion==
Thank you.

==Notes==
''On accept of both''
:{{text|say|Melani|Papa, I'm scared!}}
:{{text|say|Crystal-Shaper Barum|I know, lightning bug. But Papa needs you to be brave right now.}}
:{{text|say|Crystal-Shaper Barum|Do you remember what you want to be when you group up? Come now, you told me just this morning.}}
:{{text|say|Melani|<sniff> <sniif> ... a vindicator.}}
:{{text|say|Crystal-Shaper Barum|And what are vindicators like?}}
:{{text|say|Melani|...they're brave.}}
:{{text|say|Crystal-Shaper Barum|That's right! Can you be brave for me, Vindicator Melani?}}
:{{text|emote|Melani stands up straight and puffs out her chest.}}
:{{text|say|Melani|I'll try!}}
:{{text|say|Crystal-Shaper Barum|There's my girl. Now stay close to Papa. Let's go!}}

Pick up [[Burning Sky]] before heading out.

Ride southeast into Aruuna. Just across the bridge, find [[Barum's Notes]] on the ground, which starts [[Barum's Notes (quest)]].

Southwest of Barum's notes, between the two buildings, find the [[Crystal-Shaper's Tools]].
Head southeast towards the stairs leading to the upper level, but note a red Honed Crystal on the ground next to the central crystal structure. Halfway up the stairs is a blue Polished Crystal. Just outside the building in the upper courtyard, find [[Raksi]], who offers [[Pyrophobia]]. Just next to her is a green Harmoic Crystal. Before heading in to the inn, find the triangular Annals of Aruuna at the southeast end of the courtyard, and Melani's Doll in a char at the northeast end.

Head in to the inn to find [[Sun-Sage Kairyx]]:
:{{text|yell|Sun-Sage Kairyx|Artifacts from the greatest age belong to us! You have no claim to them!}}
Finish him off:
:{{text|say|Sun-Sage Kairyx|No... the prism...}}

Turn in to Raksi and pick up [[What the Draenei Found]]. Head northeast to the Aruuna Crystal Mine, killing winged arakkoa along the way. After entering the main mine chamber:
:{{text|yell|Adherent Squallbringer|Scour the room! Check every corner and shadow, and dno not move the artifact until we can be certain it is safe.}}
Don't take the rail bridge across, but look to the south to find a fallen rock that bridges across the ravine and points right at the Ancient Prism. Interact with it:
:{{text|say|Raksi|So, this is what they were after... Thank you for clearing the way.}}
Don't worry about not being done with Burning Sky when turning in What the Draenei Found, as more arakkoa killing is coming in the next quests at [[Veil Shadar]]. Once finally at the quota, turn in west of [[Anchorite's Sojourn]] on the [[Pilgrim's Road]].

''On approach'':
:{{text|say|Melani I did it, Papa! I made a wish!}}
