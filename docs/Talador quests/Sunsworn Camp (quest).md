==Objectives==
Meet [[Lady Liadrin]] at [[Sunsworn Camp]] in [[Talador]].

==Description==
We no longer have a need to work alongside the Auchenai, champion. I have arranged for their lead soulbinders to continue to advise us, but I believe any action is best left to us at this point.

Meet me at Sunsworn Camp, southeast of here. I can sense more demonic taint in the area, and we may be able to track down the remaining power crystal shards at its source.
If you could set forth at your nearest convenience, I am sure the Lady would be most grateful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|90|}}
*7,260 [[XP]]

==Completion==
There is still much to be done before we can leave Auchindoun with peace of mind, champion.
