==Objectives==
Rip 3 Pieces of Bark off of Slumbering Ancients in [[Zangarra]].
*Slumbering Protectors pruned (3)

==Description==
For this plan to work, we'll need infused parchment.

The latent arcane energy at this nexus quickly froze the ancients in place and settled in their bark.

If we rip off strips from the few that haven't been destroyed by the fungal creatures, I can form them into parchment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14250 [[XP]]
*20x [[Garrison Resources]]

==Completion==
Such clean breaks on each piece! Fantastic.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Creating the Ink (Horde)]] and [[Gathering the Spark (Horde)]] before heading out. After picking up all three:
:{{text|say|Magister Krelas|Let's burn it up!}}
:''Serena joins the party and buffs everyone with Arcane Brilliance: Increases critical strike chance by 5%. Only works in Zangarra and Gordal Fortress.''

Head out into Zangarra, killing [[Invasive Shambler]]s and [[Encroaching Giant]]s, looting [[Slumbering Protector]]s, and finding Arcane Vortexes.

On the east side of the caldera, way down low, find rare spore walker [[No'losh]].

==Progression==
