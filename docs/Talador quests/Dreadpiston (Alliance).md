==Objectives==
Defeat Dreadpiston.
*[[Dreadpiston]] slain {{co|56.4|27.3|Talador}}

==Description==
The [[Iron Horde]] overtook a peaceful draenei outpost without mercy.

They used a machine they call Dreadpiston to level the town in minutes.

Destroy it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40}}
*16150 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Mercy is no longer an option against this enemy.

==Completion==
They will not use that machine to kill any more draenei. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Iron Them Out (Alliance)]] and [[Vol. X Pages ? (Alliance)]] before heading out.

;On accept
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|We should have wiped Draenor clean of orcs when we arrived. None of this would ever have happened.}}

Head northwest of the [[Mor'gran Logworks]] to the [[Archenon Siegeyard]] and start blowing up Iron Horde Siege Engines. [[Burning Blademaster]]s, [[Grom'kar Siegesmith]]s and [[Fireblade Invoker]]s all drop [[Iron Shredder Operation Manual Vol. X Page ?]]. To the north, in the center of the courtyard, is [[Dreadpiston]]. Northeast of Dreadpiston is [[Ahm]], who offers a short side quest: [[Dying Wish (quest)]]. At the western extent of the quest area (on the rise, not down at sea level) is rare orc [[Yazheera the Incinerator]].

;Upon completion
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|It is done.}}
