The '''Talador storyline''' is the level-up experience in [[Talador]] in southern {{Au|Draenor}}.

The progress of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Don't Let the Tala-door Hit You on the Way Out]].

==Main storyline==
===Establishing your Outpost===
Much like in Gorgrond where players had the choice of a lumber mill or a sparring arena and got a different quest chain for each, the same applies here in Talador. This time, the choice is an artillery tower or a mage tower:

;Artillery tower

{{Talador artillery}}

;Mage tower

{{Talador mage tower}}

===The Plight of the Arakkoa===
News that the draenei settlement of [[Aruuna]] has been set alight by the [[arakkoa]], the adventurer is tasked to investigate. However, things are not as they seem with one of the quest givers, and a schism in arakkoa culture is about to be ripped wide open.

===The Battle for Shattrath===
The Iron Horde are making a move on Shattrath, so help put a stop to it.

===In the Shadows of Auchindoun===
The {{Au|Shadow Council}} has ushered in the [[Burning Legion]] to attack {{Au|Auchindoun}}, in an attempt to gather more souls for [[Teron'gor]] to consume. The Auchenai will not stand for this, and it is up to the adventurer to help fend the demons off.

==Side quests==
===Jorune Mine===
In an effort to gather more defense crystals for the [[Burning Front]], the adventurer is dispatched to [[Jorune Mine]], north of {{Au|Auchindoun}}. There, something has gotten out of control with an exceedingly large and powerful arcane crystal, which is flooding the mine with arcane energy and sending all of the elementals into a frenzy.
