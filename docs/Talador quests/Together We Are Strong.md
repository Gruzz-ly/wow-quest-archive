==Completion==
{{Au|Auchindoun}} would have fallen to the demons if it weren't for you. Even the [[Sunsworn|blood elves]] would not have been enough. I don't know how I could possibly ever repay you.

<[[Soulbinder Tuulani|Tuulani]]'s face lights up.>

That's it! We're kindred spirits, <name>. I can feel it! How about I stick around with you?

I'll still have to attend to my duties at Auchindoun, but I can handle it. What do you say, <name>? It'll be great!

*Follower: [[Soulbinder Tuulani]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progression==
