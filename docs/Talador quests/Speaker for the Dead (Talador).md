== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Exarch Maladaar (alternate universe)|Exarch Maladaar]] at the [[Burning Front]] in [[Talador]].

== Description ==
Oh, praise the [[Light]], you're here! Exarch Maladaar asked for me to find you.

We need your help. [[Auchindoun (alternate universe)|Auchindoun]] is under attack by demons!

Go to the Burning Front to the southwest as soon as possible! You're one of the few people he trusts to help lead the defense.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||53|50}}
* 350 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Completion ==
I will not allow a single demon to step foot inside Auchindoun. You will help me ensure that does not happen.

== Notes ==
There's no automatic transport to the opposite side of the zone, so hopefully players picked up the [[Exarch's Refuge]] flight path at some point...

''On approach'':
:{{text|say|[[Lady Liadrin]]|We will stand by you, Exarch. No demon will set foot in Auchindoun on my watch.}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|I hope you're right. The dead grow... fearful. Something truly dark is coming.}}

==Progression==
{{In the Shadows of Auchindoun}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
