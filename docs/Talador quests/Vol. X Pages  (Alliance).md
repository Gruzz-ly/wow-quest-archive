== Objectives ==
Find 20 Manual Pages on orcs at [[Archenon Siegeyard]].
*[[Iron Shredder Operation Manual Vol. X Page ?]] x20

== Description ==
That shredder had a manual jammed in the cockpit, but it's missing a lot o' pages. If we can find those manual pages, I'd bet my third toe I can get the prototype shredder working again.

I coulda swore I saw a few of those pages floatin' about in Archenon Siegeyard. Maybe the orcs there carry them.

''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Thaelin Darkanvil|Only bring back pages that are legible!}}

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40}}
* 16150 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Progress ==
Have you found those pages? These manuals are ridiculous.

== Completion ==
I wondered why the manual was so big.. they write with really big letters!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Dreadpiston (Alliance)]] and [[Iron Them Out (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Head northwest of the [[Mor'gran Logworks]] to the [[Archenon Siegeyard]] and start blowing up Iron Horde Siege Engines. [[Burning Blademaster]]s, [[Grom'kar Siegesmith]]s and [[Fireblade Invoker]]s all drop [[Iron Shredder Operation Manual Vol. X Page ?]]. To the north, in the center of the courtyard, is [[Dreadpiston]]. Northeast of Dreadpiston is [[Ahm]], who offers a short side quest: [[Dying Wish (quest)]]. At the western extent of the quest area (on the rise, not down at sea level) is rare orc [[Yazheera the Incinerator]].

==Progression==
{{The Battle for Shattrath}}
