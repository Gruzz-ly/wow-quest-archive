==Objectives==
Speak to [[Magister Serena]] at the entrance to [[Gordal Fortress]].

==Description==
Your forces are at the ready and the scroll is prepared.

It's time for phase two - stealing a nexus crystal from a fortified [[ogre]] compound.

We'll save the scroll to bring in reinforcements in our confrontation with the [[Witch Lord Morkurk|Gordunni Witch Lord]]. Let's meet at the base of the [[Gordal Foothills]] to head into the fortress proper.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|30}}
*1400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Let's not waste any time. Gordal Fortress awaits just up this hill.

==Notes==
;On accept
