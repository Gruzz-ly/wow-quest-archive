*Investigate the lower chamber
*Destroy the [[Corrupted Soul Foci]] (3)
*Defeat [[Gorefiend]]

==Description==
The {{Au|Auchenai}} have been reporting for some time that something was... wrong... with Auchindoun. They were never able to find a reason. Suddenly the [[Sargerei]] attacked and blew open a hole into a subchamber. Corruption leaks from that hole, we need to stop it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|30|80|}}
*[[Baleful Treads]]
*18,840 [[XP]]
*+1,000 [[reputation]] with [[Vol'jin's Headhunters]]

==Completion==
This is unfortunate. We cannot allow Gorefiend to aid {{Au|Gul'dan}}'s machinations. He must be slain once and for all.
