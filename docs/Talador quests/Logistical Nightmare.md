*[[Sack of Supplies (Talador)]] (5)
*[[Garrison Records]] (5)

==Description==
Commander, I am afraid I have... troubling... news.

These [[saberon]] followed our encampment from [[Gorgrond]], and have been stealing our supplies, ransacking our ledgers, and slaughtering our [[peon]]s!

I hate to ask of your time to deal with the matter, but all of our men are stationed guarding the camp from any further raids. We desperately need those supplies so we may enact your will!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|}}
*14,240 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Commander! Have you had time to locate our supplies and ledgers?

==Completion==
I never doubted you for a moment. You are truly a commander of the people.

Lok'tar ogar!
