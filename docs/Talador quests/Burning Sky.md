==Objectives==
Slay 12 Adherent Invaders in [[Aruuna]] and the [[Aruuna Crystal Mine]].
* Adherent Invaders slain (12)

==Description==
It happened so fast. A white-hot flash of light ignited the nearby woods, followed by terrible winds that swept the flames across Aruuna.

Moments later, [[arakkoa]] began descending through the smoke.

I need to get [[Melani]] to the [[Pilgrim's Road]]. From there we can head for [[Anchorite's Sojourn]] and the protection of the vindicators. With the arakkoa roaming the area freely, I fear we'll be run down, or worse, taken by the spreading wildfires.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40}}
*14,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Without intervention, I fear the arakkoa will burn down all of [[Talador]]!

==Completion==
Their deaths will not bring back Aruuna, but it does give me comfort to know that some among us can stand against them.

==Notes==
''On accept of both''
:{{text|say|Melani|Papa, I'm scared!}}
:{{text|say|Crystal-Shaper Barum|I know, lightning bug. But Papa needs you to be brave right now.}}
:{{text|say|Crystal-Shaper Barum|Do you remember what you want to be when you group up? Come now, you told me just this morning.}}
:{{text|say|Melani|<sniff> <sniif> ... a vindicator.}}
:{{text|say|Crystal-Shaper Barum|And what are vindicators like?}}
:{{text|say|Melani|...they're brave.}}
:{{text|say|Crystal-Shaper Barum|That's right! Can you be brave for me, Vindicator Melani?}}
:{{text|emote|Melani stands up straight and puffs out her chest.}}
:{{text|say|Melani|I'll try!}}
:{{text|say|Crystal-Shaper Barum|There's my girl. Now stay close to Papa. Let's go!}}

''On approach'':
:{{text|say|Melani|I did it, Papa! I made a wish!}}

Pick up [[Pieces of Us]] before heading out.

The mobs for the quest are [[Adherent Wing-Guard]]s, [[Adherent Squallbringer]]s and [[Adherent Sun-Caller]]s.

Ride southeast into Aruuna. Just across the bridge, find [[Barum's Notes]] on the ground, which starts [[Barum's Notes (quest)]].

Southwest of Barum's notes, between the two buildings, find the [[Crystal-Shaper's Tools]].

Head southeast towards the stairs leading to the upper level, but note a red Honed Crystal on the ground next to the central crystal structure. Halfway up the stairs is a blue Polished Crystal. Just outside the building in the upper courtyard, find [[Raksi]], who offers [[Pyrophobia]]. Just next to her is a green Harmoic Crystal. Before heading in to the inn, find the triangular Annals of Aruuna at the southeast end of the courtyard, and Melani's Doll in a char at the northeast end.

Head in to the inn to find [[Sun-Sage Kairyx]]:
:{{text|yell|Sun-Sage Kairyx|Artifacts from the greatest age belong to us! You have no claim to them!}}
Finish him off:
:{{text|say|Sun-Sage Kairyx|No... the prism...}}

Turn in to Raksi and pick up [[What the Draenei Found]]. Head northeast to the Aruuna Crystal Mine, killing winged arakkoa along the way. After entering the main mine chamber:
:{{text|yell|Adherent Squallbringer|Scour the room! Check every corner and shadow, and dno not move the artifact until we can be certain it is safe.}}
Don't take the rail bridge across, but look to the south to find a fallen rock that bridges across the ravine and points right at the Ancient Prism. Interact with it:
:{{text|say|Raksi|So, this is what they were after... Thank you for clearing the way.}}
Don't worry about not being done with Burning Sky when turning in What the Draenei Found, as more arakkoa killing is coming in the next quests at [[Veil Shadar]]. Once finally at the quota, turn in west of [[Anchorite's Sojourn]] on the [[Pilgrim's Road]].

==Progression==
