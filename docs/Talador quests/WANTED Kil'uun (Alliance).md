==Objectives==
Hunt [[Kil'uun]] and bring its beak to Patrick Messer.
*[[Kil'uun's Beak]]
Suggested players: 3

==Description==
I have a bounty set on a bird, commander. Yes, a bird.

The issue is this thing is massive, and it was last sighted a stone's throw away from the Horde base to the south in the forest. The locals call it Kil'uun.

If you'd like to track the creature down and bring back its beak I wager it would fetch a sack or two of gold for your coffers!

==Rewards==

You will also receive: {{cost|26|80}}

==Progress==
Any luck tracking down that bird, commander?

==Completion==
I have no idea how you managed to track down the creature so close to the Horde base, but well done <sir/madame>.

==Gains==
