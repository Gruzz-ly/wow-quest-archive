==Objectives==
Help 8 Arakkoa Outcasts evacuate from [[Veil Shadar]].
*Outcast evacuated (8)

==Description==
Not all [[arakkoa]] are alike.

<Iskar lifts his sleeve to reveal a mangled, useless wing.>

It is no illusion. They did this to me. Before I was even given a name, I was given a place in society: at the bottom.

We are many. We make our homes in the places this world has forgotten.

Veil Shadar was such a place, but the Adherents have found it and started a purge. For morale. For fun.

Help my people escape, and we'll be in your debt.

When the sky burns, it pays to have allies in the shadows.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Shadar Chain Pendant
|Shadar Gorget
|Shadar Medallion
|Shadar Spirit Beads
|Shadar Choker
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|5|35|}}
* 750 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
Will you help us?

==Completion==
Mark my words, <race>: Aruuna and Veil Shadar were only the beginning.

''On completion''
:{{text|say|Shadow-Sage Iskar|Remember, <name>: the sun burns the flesh. Only in shadow will you find refuge.}}
: ''Iskar casts a spell, and he and the other Outcasts vanish.''

==Notes==
Pick up [[Kura's Vengeance]] and [[Forbidden Knowledge]] before heading out.

Southeast to [[Veil Shadar]]. Keep killing arakkoa for [[Burning Sky]] if necessary. Speak with [[Outcast Darktalon]] to send them on their way. Find various books on such enlightening topics as:
*Act Like a Crone, Think Like a Sage
*Augury Without Bounds
*Basketweaving the Sinister Way
*Curses: A Practical Guide
*Eat, Scry, Love
*What Exactly is Scrying Anyway?
...and more in tents and on rocks in [[Veil Shadar]]. At the eastern end of the quest area, in a cave just uphill, find [[Wing-Guard Kuuan]].

By this point, the quota for [[Burning Sky]] should be filled, so turn in those quests just to the north of Wing-Guard Kuuan's cave closer to Aruuna.
