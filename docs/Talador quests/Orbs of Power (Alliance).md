==Objectives==
Destroy 5 Astral Wards.
*[[Astral Ward]] destroyed (5)

==Description==
Minor issue, I'm afraid.

[[Witch Lord Morkurk|Morkurk]] has placed powerful wards throughout [[Gordal Fortress]] that will prevent any sort of mass summoning - not wonderful considering our plan.

Thankfully, no ogre would ever consider that a single enemy or two would attack, so we should be able to slip through their fortress relatively easily.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14250 XP

==Progress==
Morkurk certainly put some effort into protecting himself.

==Completion==
Destroying those wards was key to our success. Well done indeed!

==Notes==
Pick up [[While We're in the Neighborhood (Alliance)]] and [[Vicious Viziers (Alliance)]] before heading out.

''On accept of all three, Serena joins the party'':
:{{text|say|Magister Serena|Let's do this!}}
Get to killing [[Gordunni Basher]]s and [[Gordunni Cleaver]]s for their [[Gordunni Runebeads]], destroying Astral Wards, and taking out the named mobs.

;First ward
:{{text|say|Magister Serena|We've got to get rid of these wards.  They're stopping us from using the scroll of mass teleportation we prepared!}}

Fifth ward:
:{{text|say|Magister Serena|Your forces are waiting for our teleport spell. Morkurk won't know what hit him.}}

Inside the fortress, keep an eye out for rare hydra [[Gennadian]], which drops the [[Scales of Gennadian]] and 20-30x [[Garrison Resources]]. Also, in the fourth tower (the one immediately to the northeast of the [[Throne of the Witch Lord]]), find an [[Iron Box]] which contains a [[Gordunni Skullthumper]] and roughly {{cost|15}}.
