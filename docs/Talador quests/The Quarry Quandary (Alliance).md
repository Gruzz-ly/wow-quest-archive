==Objectives==
Speak to {{Au|Miall|Apprentice Miall}} just outside of [[Fort Wrynn]] in [[Talador]].
*Master Smith Ared Found {{co|69.2|19.3|Talador}}

==Description==
Now that we have the artillery tower built, we're going to need some skilled hands to run it.

I've heard that Ared, one of the best smiths in Shattrath, managed to escape the city's fall. He should be just outside the north wall with the rest of the refugees.

See if you can convince him to work for us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|30}}
*1450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We need to find someone to run this place or we're not going to be producing much of anything.

==Completion==
You are the commander of this fort, yes?

My master wanted to join your fight to reclaim our home but he grew ill and... I'm sorry, he was a great draenei and I will carry on his memory.

Your new building would give me the means to see out my master's vision and honor his passing.

If you would allow me to do this then I would serve you.

==Notes==
Ext the fort to the west and follow the wall north. In a tent, find [[Master Smith Ared]] and [[Apprentice Miall]], but Ared did not survive the fall of Shattrath.

;On approach
: ''Miall is tearful, but still makes the effort to be polite.''
