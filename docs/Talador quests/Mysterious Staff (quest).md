==Objectives==
Bring the Mysterious Staff to [[Zooti Fizzlefury]] at [[Khadgar's Tower]] in [[Talador]].
*[[Mysterious Staff]] (provided)

==Description==
Fluctuations in reality surround this staff so much that it is hard to identify any recognizable markings aside from a large, lavish "V" on its apex.

This might require help to identify by someone from Khadgar's Tower.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|30|80|}}
*3,770 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I did my time with fire and the other [[arcane]] arts. They were good. Nothing compares to hurling a giant ball of fire.

But temporal wizardry? So much fun!

Really hard to master but you always have plenty of [[time]].

==Completion==
Hmm. This staff looks familiar. I wonder...

You did the right thing bringing it to me. I will investigate further!

==Progression==
#[[Mysterious Boots (quest)]], [[Mysterious Hat (quest)]], [[Mysterious Ring (quest)]], [[Mysterious Staff (quest)]]
