== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Magister Serena]] at [[Fort Wrynn]].

== Description ==
Shall we return to your outpost? It would be a much better - and safer - place to celebrate.

I'll teleport us there.

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Magister Serena|Let's get back to your outpost. Your forcers can handle any remaining ogres.}}
:{{text|say|Magister Serena|I'll teleport us back.}}

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|26}}
|Comprehensive Outpost Construction Guide
}}

== Completion ==
We can finally connect your tower to the ley line network with this crystal.

I also edited your blueprint so you can actually read the thing. Should make building another one much easier.

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Magister Serena|We're connected to the ley line network.  Now we can create a portal directly to your garrison.}}

== Notes ==
This completes the "Establishing your Outpost" chapter of [[Don't Let the Tala-door Hit You on the Way Out (Alliance)]]. The [[Talador storyline]] continues with [[One Step Ahead (Alliance)]], offered by [[Sloan McCoy]] a few yards away.

==Progression==
