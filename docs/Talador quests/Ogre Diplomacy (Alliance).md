== Objectives ==
Kill 10 Ango'rosh in the [[Ango'rosh Ruins]].
*Ango'rosh slain x10

== Description ==
Ogres are ogres. Spirits or not, the Ango'rosh are not different.

Even with their ritual books, they won't relinquish their power to you until you prove yourself.

I've fought ogres my entire life, and there's only one way to earn that.

Killing them outright.

The more Ango'rosh spirits and their pets as you take out while you're there, the more respect you'll command among them.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 16350 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Progress ==
I hope you've extended our diplomatic hand to our ogre friends.

== Completion ==
Another successful negotiation.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Desperate Measures (quest)]] before heading out.

Both named mobs, [[Dur'gol the Ruthless]] and [[Mok'war the Terrible]], are on the south side of the [[Ango'rosh Ruins]] quest area. Kill them both for their item, and kill other [[Ango'rosh Crusher]]s, [[Ango'rosh Spellweaver]]s and [[Ango'rosh Hunter]]s.

On the northwest side of the quest area is the Altar of Ango'rosh. Interact with the altar and let the channel finish:

:{{text|say|Agg'thok the Eternal|I am in your debt, little one. You have saved my people from an eternity of suffering.}}
:{{text|say|Agg'thok the Eternal|We will help you defeat your enemies. We will repay our debt to you, tiny one.}}
:''Agg'thok buffs the player with "Might of Ango'rosh: Chance on hit to summon Ango'rosh ogres to aid you in combat."''
