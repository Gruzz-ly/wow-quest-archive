Ah, <name>. It is wonderful to "see" you. As you are no doubt aware the state of Outland in our own timeline is constantly degrading.

I wish to extend my remote services to your cause so that I might better investigate Draenor in the time before it was ripped asunder.

This projection may seem translucent, but I can assure you it acts as a perfect conduit for my own powers.

Will you accept my service?
