==Objectives==
Rescue 7 Frightened Peachicks and return them to [[Caleb]].
*[[Frightened Peachick]]s rescued (7)

==Description==
That mean old [[Sher'khaan]]! He's always been a bully to these poor [[peachick]]s, but this is crossing the line!

I was trying to move this poor clutch out of the way of the demons when he attacked! Now the peachicks are spread out all over and they're scared!

Please help me bring them all back!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40}}
*14,380 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find my missing peachick friends?!

==Completion==
Oh thank you! Now these little peachicks can be moved to safety.

==Notes==
Interacting with the Frightened Peachicks changes them to [[Rescued Peachick]]s, and they start following the adventurer. After completing the quest, the Mommy? buff is acquired and an [[Confused Peachick]] remains following the adventurer.
