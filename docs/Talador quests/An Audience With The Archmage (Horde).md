==Objectives==
Speak to [[Archmage Khadgar]] in [[Talador]].

==Description==
Your Arcane Sanctum is coming along nicely, commander.

Everything's built to spec... except for one detail [[Gazlowe]] scrawled in at the bottom of the blueprint. "Don't forget to connect the sanctum to the [[ley line]] network!"

I, uh... I have no idea how to do that.

I'm sorry commander, but magic just isn't my thing. We did spot Archmage Khadgar and some [[Kirin Tor]] not far from here. To the east, up near the mountains.

Maybe we should ask them for help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|30|}}
*1,420 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, so you've built an Arcane Sanctum! Splendid!

Troubles connecting to the ley line network, I take it?

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{text|say|Cordana Felsong|Very well. I'll meet you there. Stay safe.}}
:''Cordana Felsong drops into stealth and heads away from Archmage Khadgar.''

Take the path heading east from [[Vol'jin's Pride]] to reach a small Kirin Tor camp.

==Progression==
{{Talador mage tower}}
