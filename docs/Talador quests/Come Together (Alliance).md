== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Vindicator Icia]] at [[Fort Wrynn]].

== Description ==
[[Gul'dan]] and his cronies would do well to remember this day. We Auchenai are not to be trifled with.

You should inform Vindicator Icia in your outpost of our success. She can reach out to the scattered refugees and their families.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|1|38}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

== Completion ==
I will gather any remaining survivors so we can rebuild what we have lost.

Thank you.

==Progression==
{{In the Shadows of Auchindoun}}
