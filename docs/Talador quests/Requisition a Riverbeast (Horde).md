==Objectives==
Use the Riverbeast Lasso on a [[Young Riverwallow]] and follow it until it is tamed.
*Riverwallow Tamed
*[[Riverbeast Lasso]] (provided)

==Description==
I have seen great beasts floating slowly along the rivers of Talador. The 'riverbeasts,' I believe they are called.

Their hides are solid, like rock, and yet they float along the waters easily. I would quite like to see one of these up close, if you should head that way. Tormak has created for you another rope, if you are interested.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (50)

==Completion==
Quite a sight, I must say. Big and powerful, yet full of so much air. It will be ready for training tomorrow.
