==Objectives==
Bring the Mysterious Ring to [[Zooti Fizzlefury]] at [[Khadgar's Tower]] in [[Talador]].
*[[Mysterious Ring (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
This elegantly crafted ring is covered in ornate decorations and symbols, the most prominent of which being the letter "V" in a glowing rune. The ring seems to fade in and out of view as if passing back and forth through [[time]].

Someone at Khadgar's Tower may have an interest in such an artifact.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|30|80|}}
*3,770 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Time magic is a young field of research.

==Completion==
Ah. Now what do you have there? This ring is going to require some extra research.

It seems like someone was trying to travel through time but in a very backward fashion.

==Progression==
#[[Mysterious Boots (quest)]], [[Mysterious Hat (quest)]], [[Mysterious Ring (quest)]], [[Mysterious Staff (quest)]]
#[[Temporal Juxtaposition]]

==Patch changes==
