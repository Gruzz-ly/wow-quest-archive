==Objectives==
Slay Ripgut just outside [[Fort Wrynn]].
*[[Ripgut]] slain

==Description==
<Sir/Madame>, we have located the [[saberon]]'s alpha male just outside our gates!

We believe that slaying him will send any remaining saberon running with their tails between their legs, but the beast is positively massive!

I do not wish to call upon you once more, but you are the only one capable of this task.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14,240 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is the alpha male dispatched?

==Completion==
Victory! For the Alliance!

==Patch changes==
