==Objectives==
Find [[Soulbinder Tuulani]] in the {{Au|Tomb of Lights}}.

==Description==
It's good to see a Horde champion joining the fight.

Auchindoun's defenses are faltering quickly. The few Auchenai soulpriests not on the front are working fervently to maintain them.

Soulbinder Tuulani went inside the nearby Tomb of Lights to retrieve a backup power pylon and hasn't returned. If you can find her and get her and the pylon back here safely it would help greatly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|90}}
*8200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You look like you can fight. We need to get out of here!

==Notes==
