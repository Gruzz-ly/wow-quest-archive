Kill [[Hilaani]] and bring the Pile of Riverbeast Meat to [[Patrick Messer]].
*[[Pile of Riverbeast Meat]]
*Suggested players: 3

==Description==
[[Quartermaster O'Riley|O'riley]]{{sic}} wants to thank our peasants for their hard work with a riverbeast dinner. I don't want to waste your time asking you to slaughter the things all day, commander. We've gotten reports of a huge [[riverbeast]] called Hilaani that would feed the whole fort twice over living in the lake to the south.

If you have a chance to bring cuts of her meat back, the men would be grateful.
