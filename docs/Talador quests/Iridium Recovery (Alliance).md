==Objectives==
Gather 8 Iridium Dust from [[Iridium Geode]]s in [[Kuuro's Claim]].
*[[Iridium Dust]] (8)

==Description==
[[Master Smith Ared|Ared]] used to always teach me that the purity of the metal is key. If the metal isn't pure it will crack under stress and be of no use to anyone.

For the artillery tower to function I'll need to make metal as pure as my master would, and for that I need a strong flux.

The dust from crushed iridium geodes would work in a pinch, but we need to find some first. They tend to congregate underground, so check out the mine in Kuuro's Claim nearby.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14250 [[XP]]
*20 [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
I'm going to need a lot of iridium dust to purify the metal to anywhere near my master's standards.

==Completion==
This won't be as good as some of the stuff we had back at the forge in [[Shattrath]], but it will do.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Out of Jovite (Alliance)]] and [[Gas Guzzlers (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Exit the garrison to the east past [[Sharptusk Lake]] to reach [[Kuuro's Claim]]. Enter the mine and start killing goren and geodes. Make sure to ''use the quest item'' on the goren corpses to get quest credit for Gas Guzzlers! Jovite Ore is blue-green and on the mine walls.

Stick to the southern wall of the mine to get to the upper level, where at {{co|78.2|14.7|Talador}} all the way in the back, is a pile of [[Pure Crystal Dust]]. The dust contains an [[Iridium Inlaid Band]].

==Progression==
