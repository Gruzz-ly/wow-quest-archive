==Objectives==
Follow [[Archmage Khadgar]] and speak with [[Magister Serena]] in [[Zangarra]].
*Khadgar's portal taken {{co|80.6|26.1|Talador}}

==Description==
It's nice to see someone else taking a vested interest in the arcane arts, you know. It's all too rare these days if you ask me.

Unfortunately, I must meet [[Cordana Felsong|Cordana]] to handle an important matter, but we're in luck! One of my good friends in the [[Kirin Tor]] has agreed to help you connect your arcane sanctum to the ley line network.

She's waiting at my tower. Let's leave immediately and introduce you to one another.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|30}}
*1,420 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Nice to meet you.

I am Magister Serena. Frost mage extraordinaire!

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Come, <name>. I will introduce you to a friend of mine who can help you with your tower.}}
: ''Khadgar briefly changes to raven form to head uphill to the east, stopping short at an arcane gatekeeper, which coalesces from its bracers.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Let us pass, gatekeeper.}}
: ''The gatekeeper responds in an echoing, male voice.''
:{{text|say|Kirin Tor Guardian|No outsiders allowed. [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lady Proudmoore's]] orders.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Then let Jaina take it up with me. I am a member of the [[Council of Six|Council]], and you WILL let me and my friend pass!}}
:{{text|say|Kirin Tor Gatekeeper|Very well, Archmage. As you wish.}}
: ''The gatekeeper disperses back into its bracers.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|My tower lies just through this pass.}}
: ''Khadgar shapeshifts to fly up the path into [[Zangarra]] and changes back beside a portal.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|When you are ready, take this portal down to my tower.}}
:''Khadgar walks onto the pad and uses the portal. After taking the portal...''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|My friend is just ahead.}}
:''He walks past two mages in a magical duel.''
:{{text|say|Kirin Tor Magus 1|Frost is clearly the superior path. Give up!}}
:{{text|say|Kirin Tor Magus 2|We'll see about that!}}
: ''Khadgar makes it to Magister Serena's position.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Ah, there you are! This is the one I was telling you about.}}
:{{text|say|Magister Serena|Wonderful! Thank you, Archmage. I can handle things from here.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Very good. I'm sure I'll be seeing the both of you soon.}}
: ''Khadgar walks back to the portal and uses it once more.''

Get the flight path before porting down to the tower.
