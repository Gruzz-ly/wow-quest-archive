==Objectives==
Kill 15 [[Iron Horde]] at [[Mor'gran Logworks]].
*Iron Horde slain (15)

==Description==
We must slay the Iron Horde troops who infest our lands.

Find those who would sully our great forest and show them the hand of justice.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40}}
*16150 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Have you slain our enemies?

==Completion==
The Iron Horde has no consideration for the wonders of the forest. In death, they will know respect.

==Notes==
Pick up [[In Short Supply (Alliance)]] and [[Thaelin's Quick Fix (quest)]] before heading out.

Southwest to [[Mor'gran Logworks]]. The Thunderlord Cache is in the northeastern extent of the quest area and the log storage area is at the northwestern extent, with [[Redemption Rise]], an Alliance flight path, between them. Just northwest of Redemption Rise, a [[Fallen Draenei Defender]] and a dead [[Iron Engineer]] are a few yards from some [[Iron Shredder Decommission Orders]]. Interact with the orders to pick up [[Decommissioned Mission (Alliance)]], a mandatory short side quest to unlock a shredder.

Enter the main camp, down south by the water to find the forge. Plenty of crates of [[Iron Horde Explosives]] are found in the main camp as well.

Turn in up at [[Redemption Rise]].
