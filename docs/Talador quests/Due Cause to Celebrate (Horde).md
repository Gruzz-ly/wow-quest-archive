== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Magister Krelas]] at [[Vol'jin's Pride]].

== Description ==
This isn't exactly my idea of the best place to talk.

Shall we return to your outpost? It will be a much better place to celebrate.

I'll teleport us there.

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Magister Krelas|Your forces can handle any remaining ogres. Lets get out of here.}}
:{{text|say|Magister Krelas|I shall teleport us back.}}

== Rewards ==
You will receive: [[Comprehensive Outpost Construction Guide]]

== Completion ==
With this crystal, we can connect your tower to the ley line network at last!

I also made some modifications to your blueprint that should make it much easier to build another tower in your garrison.

== Notes ==
This completes the "Establishing your Outpost" chapter of [[Don't Let the Tala-door Hit You on the Way Out (Horde)]]. The [[Talador storyline]] continues with [[One Step Ahead (Horde)]], offered by [[Shadow Hunter Kajassa]] a few yards away.

==Progression==
{{Talador mage tower}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
