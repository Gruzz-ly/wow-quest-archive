==Objectives==
Kill 8 Sharpfang Stalkers and Destroy Sher'khaan.
*[[Sharpfang Stalker]] slain (8)
*[[Sher'khaan]] slain

==Description==
The [[tiger]]s here have gotten out of control! They're everywhere and meaner than ever!

Sher'khaan is the worst of them! He's huge and mean! Maybe a brave [[adventurer]] like you could take care of Sher'khaan and the other tigers once and for all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40}}
* 14,380 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is it safe to go in the forest again?

==Completion==
You're so brave! I could never have taken Sher'khaan out on my own!

Now I only have to worry about the scary [[orc]]s, giant [[bird]]s, [[hippo]]s, big bird men, [[spider]]s, everything being on fire...

Ya'know maybe I shouldn't be out here all by myself...
