==Objectives==
Wait for [[Zooti Fizzlefury]]'s temporal ritual to complete.
*Wait for Zooti Fizzlefury to complete his ritual

==Description==
I think I figured out what those mysterious artifacts you collected were for.

It would seem someone is attempting to affect a temporal shift by sending items back into [[alternate timeline|this timeline]] from your own timeline.

Technically that shouldn't be possible. But whoever this is found a way.

I think I may try a ritual to bring the traveler through.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|30|80|}}
*3,770 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<name>? Is that you? Fantastic! And they said it couldn't be done.

They said traversing the [[world]]s in this way was the domain of the [[bronze dragonflight]]. Well, guess who's temporally laughing now!

==Progression==
