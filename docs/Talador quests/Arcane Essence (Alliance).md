==Objectives==
Retrieve 6 Arcane Essence.
*[[Arcane Essence]] (6)

==Description==
[[Kaelynara Sunchaser|Kaelynara's]] lust for arcane power has consumed her and she threatens the safety of all in [[Jorune Mine|this mine]]. She must be stopped.

Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do while she shields herself. We will need to find a way to penetrate her shielding spell.

Perhaps if I were to build a focusing crystal, I could use it to lower her shield...I'll need you to search the crystal mine for the necessary components.

First, I'll need arcane essence from the [[Crystal Rager]]s and [[Arcane Wraith]]s in the mine.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*16350 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you collected enough arcane essence yet?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. The arcane essence you've collected will do nicely. All we need now is a suitable crystal to attune...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Caught In The Chaos]] before heading out.

Drop to the lower level and target [[Crystal Rager]]s and [[Arcane Wraith]]s that are actively attacking [[Injured Miner]]s to attempt to get credit for both quests at the same time.

==Progression==
{{Jorune Mine}}
