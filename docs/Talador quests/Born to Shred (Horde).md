==Objectives==
Kill 100 Iron Horde in [[Tuurem]] using the Iron Shredder.
*Take control of the Iron Shredder
*Iron Horde slain in Tuurem (100)

==Description==
The Iron Shredder is operational! It should be primed and ready for you to shred our enemies in Tuurem! Head inside and see what damage you can do. Can't say I'm not jealous.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*75x [[Garrison Resources]]
*{{cost|13|40}}
* 16150 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Completion==
-- ENEMIES ELIMINATED --

==Notes==
Now that Gazlowe has fixed the shredder, it has two usable abilities:
#{{abilities|Electrostatic Distortion|range=60|Inflicts Nature damage to enemies near the lightning orb.|notes=Instant.|cd=1.5 sec}}
#{{abilities|Death from Above|range=10-70|Inflicts Nature damage to enemies at the targeted location and knocks them back.|notes=Instant.|cd=6 sec}}
While out of combat, the shredder is buffed with "Pedal to the Metal: Movement speed increased by 50% when out of combat."

Run west to the [[Archenon Siegeyard]], then cut south across the ford in the river to reach [[Tuurem]]. Then start attacking everything that moves. Try to throw a sawblade at a group of enemies, then jump to them to clear out any stragglers.

Once 100 are dead, click on the Iron Shredder Prototype mech (don't get out of it!) to turn in.

==Progression==
