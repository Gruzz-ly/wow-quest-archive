==Objectives==
Kill Xanatos the Defiler in [[Deathweb Hollow]] and retrieve Sha'tari.
*[[Xanatos the Defiler]] slain {{co|65.6|86.8|Talador}} 
*[[Sha'tari (item)]] {{co|65.8|86.9|Talador}}

==Description==
I've learned that the [[Shadow Council (alternate universe)|Shadow Council]] is using the deathweb spiders' venom to spread fel corruption and augment their forces after their defeat at the [[Burning Front]].

One of my soulbinders saw a [[dreadlord]] headed into the eastern mines with Sha'tari, one of the remaining pieces of the [[Heart of Auchindoun]].

I need you to wrest Sha'tari from the dreadlord's quivering corpse and bring it to me, champion.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 560 chestpieces|Sha'tari Keeper Chestplate|Sha'tari Deadeye Vest|Talador Sentinel Vest|Auchenai Keeper Robe}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 16350 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Did the demon have Sha'tari as we thought?

==Completion==
Just as I suspected.  Thank you, <name>.  With Sha'tari back in our possession there is only one piece of the Heart left to retrieve.

==Notes==
''On accept:''
: {{text|say|Soulbinder Nyami|[[Auchindoun (alternate universe)|Auchindoun]] is safe as long as it is kept sealed.  We need to retrieve the fragments so my priests can protect them.}}

Pick up [[Antivenin]] and [[Vile Defilers (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Kill spiders and egg-watchers. Click on defiling crystals. Try to break open [[Deathweb Cocoon]]s, as they may contain friendly NPCs. If all four are freed, a reward will be offered in town.

Enter the mine at the southeastern end of [[Deathweb Hollow]].

Xanatos and the Sha'tari defense crystal are on the bottom floor of the main chamber.
:{{text|say|Xanatos the Defiler|Ah, there you are. I thought I smelled <race>.}}
Upstairs is rare spider [[Klikixx]], who drops [[Klikixx's Webspinner]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]].
