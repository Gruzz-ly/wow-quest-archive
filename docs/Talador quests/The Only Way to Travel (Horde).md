==Objectives==
Speak to [[Morketh Bladehowl]] in [[Vol'jin's Pride]].

==Description==
Call me cautious but I kept a few flares just in case we needed to evac.

I'm glad that wasn't needed but we could still use the ride back to the arsenal.

Are you ready, <sir/ma'am>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|30}}
*1450 [[XP]]
*[[Comprehensive Outpost Construction Guide]]

==Completion==
The outpost is now fully up and running and we have enough material to outfit an army - your army!

==Notes==
This completes the "Establishing your Outpost" chapter of [[Don't Let the Tala-door Hit You on the Way Out (Horde)]]. The [[Talador storyline]] continues with [[One Step Ahead (Horde)]], offered by [[Sloan McCoy]] a few yards away.
