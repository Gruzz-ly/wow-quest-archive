==Objectives==
Obtain 12 chunks of Jovite Ore from within [[Kuuro's Claim]].
*[[Jovite Ore]] (12)

==Description==
Crafting good equipment requires the best metal and some of the best metal is the jovite that comes from the mine in Kuuro's Claim, just east of here. In order to supply the arsenal I'm going to need this metal.

Unfortunately the place was recently overwhelmed by a pack of goren so you're going to have to fight your way in to get the ore before they manage to devour it.

Nothing that should be too much of a problem for you, <sir/ma'am>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14250 [[XP]]
*20 [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
We need to get that ore before those damned goren eat it all.

==Completion==
Good size chunks and without a lot of the matrix material on them.

These will do just fine.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Iridium Recovery (Horde)]] and [[Gas Guzzlers (Horde)]] before heading out.

Exit the garrison to the east past [[Sharptusk Lake]] to reach [[Kuuro's Claim]]. Enter the mine and start killing goren and geodes. Make sure to ''use the quest item'' on the goren corpses to get quest credit for Gas Guzzlers! Jovite Ore is blue-green and on the mine walls.

Stick to the southern wall of the mine to get to the upper level, where at {{co|78.2|14.7|Talador}} all the way in the back, is a pile of [[Pure Crystal Dust]]. The dust contains an [[Iridium Inlaid Band]].

==Progression==
