== Description ==
W- we have done n-n-nothing to provoke the [[arakkoa]]... w-why would they attack [[Aruuna]]? What do they want from us?

I want to run, but I'm... too afraid. That leader of theirs will burn me to a crisp, I just know it!

H-he's just inside the inn...

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|13|40}}

== Progress ==
SHH! K-k-keep your voice down... they'll find us!

You killed him? Oh, oh thank you!

But what was that he said about an artifact?

== Gains ==
* 13400 XP

== Notes ==
In [[Aruuna]] for [[Burning Sky]], [[Pieces of Us]], and [[Barum's Notes (quest)]], find [[Raksi]] cowering in fear outside the inn. Head inside and kill [[Sun-Sage Kairyx]]:
