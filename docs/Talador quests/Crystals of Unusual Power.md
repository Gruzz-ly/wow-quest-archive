==Objectives==
Collect 10 Unrefined Power Crystals.
*[[Unrefined Power Crystals]] (10)

==Description==
[[Arcane]] crystals of this size and power are quite rare even on {{Au|Draenor}}. It is no coincidence that the [[Draenei]] built {{Au|Shattrath City|Shattrath}} and {{Au|Auchindoun}} so close to [[Jorune Mine|this mine]].

I am interested in learning more about these particular crystals and their arcane nature.

Return to me with any unrefined power crystals that you may find and I will make sure that you are adequately compensated for your effort.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80|}}
*14,520 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you collected the unrefined power crystals I need for my research?

==Completion==
The crystals in this mine are most certainly unique. Thorough study of the samples you have provided should reveal why this is the case.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
