==Objectives==
Take Auch'naaru from Vorpil Ribcleaver in [[Telmor (alternate universe)|Telmor]].
*[[Vorpil Ribcleaver]] slain {{co|44.6|90.8|Talador}}
*[[Auch'naaru]] {{co|44.5|90.9|Talador}}

==Description==
I am too injured to fight, <class>. I have failed my city and its people. This battle is yours.

Vorpil waits just ahead. He's trying to use Auch'naaru's powers for some sort of dark ritual.

You must do what I could not. Cut Vorpil down and retrieve Auch'naaru so the Heart of Auchindoun can be whole once more!

''On accept'':
:{{text|yell|Teron'gor|Receive my gift, Vorpil. You will be the first of a new breed of conquerors!}}
:{{text|yell|Vorpil Ribcleaver|I will use Auch'naaru to enact your will, my lord!}}

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 563 weapons|Talador Sentinel Standard Issue|Telmor Crystal Staff|Telmor Soupriest Staff|Restalaan's Greatsword|Vorpil's Ribsmasher|Restalaan's Longsword|Vorpil's Ribcrusher|Vorpil's Ribnicker}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 16350 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
We need the final piece of the Heart!

==Completion==
Well done! I will take Auch'naaru to [[Auchindoun (alternate universe)|Auchindoun]]. The [[Shadow Council (alternate universe)|Shadow Council]] has no place in our lands.

==Progression==
{{In the Shadows of Auchindoun}}
