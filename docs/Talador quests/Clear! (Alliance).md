==Objectives==
Collect 6 Zapper Sacs from [[Lakebottom Zapper]]s in [[Talador]].
*[[Zapper Sac]] (6)

==Description==
Oh, the gnomanity!

The [[Pleasure-Bot 8000]] broke before it could bring me a single Draenor truffle. It swam here and shorted its power fluctuator.

AGAIN!

I have power going to it, but it isn't enough to override the fluctuator.

Could you get me the sacs from the electric eels in the lake? I think that would be just the ticket!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40|}}
*14,380 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the eel sacs?

==Completion==
Those look perfect! By all that is mechanical, this had better work.

Now let's just insert these here...

==Notes==
