==Objectives==
Gather 30 Pulsating Pustules from [[sporebat]]s and [[fungal giant]]s in [[Zangarra]].
*[[Pulsating Pustule]] (30)

==Description==
We're going to need a way to create an artificial nexus at your tower.

I know where we can get what we need, but it's heavily protected. We don't have the firepower to just waltz in the front door.

I have a plan - a scroll of mass teleportation.

The fungal giants and spore creatures down below are covered in pustules filled with an oily substance. If we gather enough of the oil I can craft a makeshift ink substitute for the scroll.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14250 [[XP]]
*20x [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
The giants have many more pustules than the sporebats, but are much tougher.

==Completion==
These pustules are sizzling with energy. They'll do nicely.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Forming the Scroll (Horde)]] and [[Gathering the Spark (Horde)]] before heading out. After picking up all three:
:{{text|say|Magister Krelas|Let's burn it up!}}
:''Serena joins the party and buffs everyone with Arcane Brilliance: Increases critical strike chance by 5%. Only works in Zangarra and Gordal Fortress.''

Head out into Zangarra, killing [[Invasive Shambler]]s and [[Encroaching Giant]]s, looting [[Slumbering Protector]]s, and finding Arcane Vortexes.

On the east side of the caldera, way down low, find rare spore walker [[No'losh]].

==Progression==
{{Talador mage tower}}
