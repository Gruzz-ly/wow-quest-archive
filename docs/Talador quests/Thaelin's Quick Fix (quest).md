==Completion==
Nothing like a good explosion to warm the heart.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Too Many Irons in the Fire (Alliance)]] and [[In Short Supply (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Southwest to [[Mor'gran Logworks]]. The Thunderlord Cache is in the northeastern extent of the quest area and the log storage area is at the northwestern extent, with [[Redemption Rise]], an Alliance flight path, between them. Just northwest of Redemption Rise, a [[Fallen Draenei Defender]] and a dead [[Iron Engineer]] are a few yards from some [[Iron Shredder Decommission Orders]]. Interact with the orders to pick up [[Decommissioned Mission (Alliance)]], a mandatory short side quest to unlock a shredder.

Enter the main camp, down south by the water to find the forge. Plenty of crates of [[Iron Horde Explosives]] are found in the main camp as well.

Turn in up at [[Redemption Rise]].


You will get an alert when you're close:
: {{text|bossemote|Thaelin's Quick Fix is ready to deploy!}}

At each location the bomb will embed itself at the center and explode; the blast will knock you back. The explosion will startle nearby mobs:

;Thunderlord Cache
: {{text|yell|Grom'kar Grimshot|Ahhh!}}

;Blackrock Forge
: {{text|yell|Grom'kar Deadeye|Watch out!}}

;Log Storage
: {{text|yell|Grom'kar Vanguard|Whoa!}}
: {{text|yell|Grom'kar Vanguard|Duck!}}
