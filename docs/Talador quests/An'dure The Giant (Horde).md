== Objectives ==
Retrieve the Crystal Giant Heart.
*[[Crystal Giant Heart]] {{co|54.2|50.1|Talador}}

== Description ==
In order to break through Kaelynara's arcane shield, we will need a focusing crystal of rare power and quality.

Within the mine is a crystal giant known to the Draenei as An'dure. The giant has slept beneath the rocky earth for ages, but due to Kaelynara's recklessness it has awakened.

The heart of a crystal giant is a truly powerful artifact. Defeat An'Dure and return to me with a crystal giant heart. Once I have the heart, I will have everything I need to construct the focusing crystal!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: 75x[[Garrison Resources]] and {{cost|13|80}}

== Progress ==
Do you have the crystal giant heart?

== Completion ==
Excellent. Give me a moment and I will prepare the focusing crystal.

== Gains ==
* 16350 XP

== Notes ==
