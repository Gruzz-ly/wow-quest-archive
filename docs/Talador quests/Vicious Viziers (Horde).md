==Objectives==
Slay Vizier Vorgorsh, Vizier Zulmork, and Vizier Cromaug.
*[[Vizier Vorgorsh]] slain {{co|68.5|82.9|Talador}}
*[[Vizier Zulmork]] slain {{co|67.0|77.0|Talador}}
*[[Vizier Cromaug]] slain {{co|66.3|81.0|Talador}}

==Description==
We can't just skate in, kill [[Witch Lord Morkurk]], and leave.

His three lieutenants - Vorgorsh, Zulmork, and Cromaug - are all fiercely loyal to Morkurk, and are all respectable mages in their own right.

I suspect that if we attempt to engage the Witch Lord immediately that they will rush to his aid and overwhelm us. We need to take out his lieutenants first.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Now that they're out of the way, Morkurk is exposed.

==Notes==
Pick up [[While We're in the Neighborhood (Horde)]] and [[Orbs of Power (Horde)]] before heading out.

''On accept of all three, Krelas joins the party'':
:{{text|say|Magister Krelas|I'm going to enjoy this.}}
Get to killing [[Gordunni Basher]]s and [[Gordunni Cleaver]]s for their [[Gordunni Runebeads]], destroying Astral Wards, and taking out the named mobs.

Inside the fortress, keep an eye out for rare hydra [[Gennadian]], which drops the [[Scales of Gennadian]] and 20-30x [[Garrison Resources]].

At the southeastern end of the quest area, inside the tower just south of [[Gennadian]]'s position, find [[Vizier Vorgorsh]]:
:{{text|say|Vizier Vorgorsh|You will never take our land!}}
:{{text|say|Magister Krelas|Masterful fighting! Two more to go.}}
Head north across the raised platform to the northeastern tower to find [[Vizier Zulmork]]:
:{{text|say|Vizier Zulmork|Help! Guards! Where are they? Fine, I'll kill you myself!}}
:{{text|say|Magister Krelas|Now to find Cromaug and put an end to his miserable existence.}}
Head southwest to the last tower to find [[Vizier Cromaug]]:
:{{text|say|Vizier Cromaug|It will be a pleasure blasting you into the ground!}}
:{{text|say|Magister Krelas|That's the last of them. We won't have to worry about them interfering.}}

Also, in the fourth tower (the one immediately to the northeast of the [[Throne of the Witch Lord]]), find an [[Iron Box]] which contains a [[Gordunni Skullthumper]] and roughly {{cost|15}}.
