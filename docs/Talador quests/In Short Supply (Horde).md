==Objectives==
Collect 6 Iron Horde Explosives.
*[[Iron Horde Explosives]] (6)

==Description==
The enemy has explosive devices stored on the beach below. We must recover them so they are not used against us. Reports indicate that crates of explosives are scattered along the shoreline. While you search, Durotan and I will carve deeper into Iron Horde territory.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40}}
* 16150 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Frostwolf Orcs]]

==Progress==
Have you found the Iron Horde Explosives yet?

==Completion==
I believe we can use these at Archenon Siegeyard.
