==Objectives==
Destroy 5 Defiling Crystals in [[Deathweb Hollow]].
*[[Defiling Crystal|Defiling crystals]] destroyed (5)

==Description==
The spiders in the nearby overrun mine are feared by many, for their venom twists the very form of their victims. Many of the locals stay far away from their hollow, but I fear the {{Au|Shadow Council}} has become privy to this information.

Our scouts report that their warlocks are infusing these spiders with fel energy so that their venom turns their victims into demonic minions!

Destroy the defiling crystals so this madness does not spread.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 16350 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
We cannot afford another enemy in this war.

==Completion==
We were wise to not underestimate the threat of a land turned against us.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Antivenin]] and [[Into the Hollow (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Kill spiders and egg-watchers. Click on defiling crystals. Try to break open [[Deathweb Cocoon]]s, as they may contain friendly NPCs. If all four are freed, a reward will be offered in town.

Enter the mine at the southeastern end of [[Deathweb Hollow]].

Xanatos and the Sha'tari defense crystal are on the bottom floor of the main chamber.

Upstairs is rare spider [[Klikixx]], who drops [[Klikixx's Webspinner]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]].
