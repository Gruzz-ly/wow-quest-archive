== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Ageilaa]] at the [[Jorune Mine]] in [[Talador]].

== Description ==
[[Manduil Skycaller]] was sent on a sensitive mission to Jorune Mine, but he hasn't returned for hours.

I suspect he requires assistance. I will let him brief you on the situation when you find him, but he is likely deep within the mine.

You should report to Ageilaa, a local draenei miner who has agreed to cooperate with us in exchange for helping her regain control of the mine.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|38}}

== Completion ==
Aeun sent you? Help has arrived!

== Gains ==
* 1650 XP

== Notes ==
This is a side quest, not part of the main storyline. Head northwest to the [[Jorune Mine]], north of Auchindoun.

==Progression==

== Patch changes ==
