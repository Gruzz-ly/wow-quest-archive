==Objectives==
Dispatch Ra'tok the Hammer in the [[Orunai Coast]].
*[[Ra'tok the Hammer]] slain
*Suggested players: 3

==Description==
I've got an issue that could use your assistance, commander.

A few of our men spotted an [[Iron Horde]] lieutenant wandering in the cliffs near here. We suspect she's directing their forces to strategic ground as they land on the Orunai Coast.

I would feel much better about the safety of this fort if you could take her out.

All hail your glory, commander.
