==Objectives==
Obtain 3 [[Shadow Council Spellbook|Shadow Council Spellbooks]] and burn them in the fire by [[Kor'thos Dawnfury]] in [[Gul'rok]].
*Books burned (3)

==Description==
Please, <name>... I don't have much time.

The {{Au|Shadow Council}} have allowed themselves to be turned into demons by [[Teron'gor]] and his [[warlock]]s!

I have reason to believe that the [[Shadowborne Dementor|shadowborne dementors]] are using spells given to them by {{Au|Gul'dan}} to empower the demonic orcs. Take their spellbooks and cast them into the fire by me... it will be a pleasant sight to die to.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|5|35|}}
* 2,750 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
Thank you... kill a couple more for me on your way out, if you can...

==Notes==
In [[Gul'rok]] for [[Into the Heart of Madness]] and [[Every Bit Counts]], find [[Kor'thos Dawnfury]] strung up not far from a bonfire in the center of the area. He offers this quest. Kill [[Shadowborne Dementor]]s and loot their [[Shadow Council Spellbook]], then click on the bonfire after gathering three books to burn them.

==Progression==
{{In the Shadows of Auchindoun}}
