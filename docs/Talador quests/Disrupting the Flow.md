==Objectives==
Destroy 4 [[Burning Resonator]]s in the [[Burning Front]].
*Burning Resonator destroyed (4)

==Description==
You there, we need to stop the flow of demon reinforcements!

Do you see the floating [[fel crystal]]s spread throughout the front? Those resonators are powering the portals unleashing hell on our forces. I need you to take them out!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|5|35|}}
* 2,750 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
We can't hold out forever!

==Completion==
We can take it from here. [[Light]]'s blessings to you, <class>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Holding the Line (Alliance)]], [[Powering the Defenses (Alliance)]], and [[The Heart of Auchindoun]] before heading out. [[Every Bit Counts (Alliance)]] is a side quest and not part of the main storyline.

Four Burning Resonators are found in the fel-tainted area at fixed locations.

In the northeastern part of the quest area, where [[O'mogg Blackheart]] and the [[Karab'uun]] defense crystal are found, one of three rare demons will spawn every five minutes: [[Galzomar]], a [[terrorguard]], [[Kharazos the Triumphant]], a [[wrathguard]], and [[Sikthiss, Maiden of Slaughter]], a [[shivarra]]. The share a loot table, dropping the [[Burning Legion Missive (toy)]], so don't bother waiting for all of them to spawn.

==Progression==
{{In the Shadows of Auchindoun}}
