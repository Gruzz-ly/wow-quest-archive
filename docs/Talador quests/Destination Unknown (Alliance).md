==Description==
[[Teron'gor]] and [[Gul'dan]] were just leaving through the portal as I arrived... and I... I know I won't be able to defeat them.

I'll hold open the portal as long as I can. It will be up to you to strike the killing blow.

Our fate is in your hands, <name>.

* +500 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Completion ==
[[Teron'gor]] and {{Au|Gul'dan}}... they slaughtered everyone...

...and then they just... disappeared... into the shadows...

How did they know where to go?

Take the Demonic Gateway to reach the [[Remains of Xandros]]. On the other side, Gul'dan and Teron'gor are ready to begin a ritual:
:{{text|say|Gul'dan|Ah, the thorn in my side has arrived.}}
:{{text|say|Guld'an|It's time I taught you a lesson.}}
:{{text|yell|Gul'dan|Let the ritual begin.}}
:{{text|yell|Teron'gor|I lend you my strength, master!}}
:{{text|yell|Gul'dan|Lord Mogrenthod, hear my call. This mortal threatens the master's plans!}}
:''They summon in [[Mongrethod]], an [[annihilan]]!''
:{{text|say|Gul'dan|Come, Teron'gor. Our contact has provided another entrance to Auchindoun. Your feast of souls awaits.}}
:''The two orcs depart the far Demonic Gateway, leaving the player to Mongrethod.''

Aggro the annihilan, and [[Exarch Maladaar (alternate universe)|Exarch Maladaar]] and [[Lady Liadrin]] will come out of the Demonic Gateway and start attacking:
:{{text|say|Mongrethod|Your suffering will be legendary.}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|We are bound together by the Light. We fight as one.}}

Part way through the fight, three demonic portals open up and start spilling out felguards, darkhounds, and other demons.
:{{text|say|Mongrethod|Arise, my minions! Rend their flesh.}}

[[Agg'thok the Eternal]] chooses now to pay off his debt, summoning a host of ghostly ogres to keep the lesser demons occupied.
:{{text|say|Agg'thok the Eternal|Today I repay my debt. I will handle the portals.}}
:{{text|yell|Agg'thok the Eternal|ANGO'ROSH! TO ME!}}

Whittle away Mongrethod's health and get him to 1%:
:{{text|yell|Mongrethod|VERMIN! I WILL TURN YOUR WORLD TO ASH!}}
:{{text|yell|Exarch Maladaar|Liadrin, I have it. Finish it!}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Liadrin|You will never defeat the Light, demon!}}
:''Maladaar casts something with a golden beam at the annihilan, and Liadrin casts something else to kill it.''
:{{text|say|Lady Liadrin|Let's go. They went through that portal.}}
:''Liadrin and Maladaar take the Demonic Gateway that Gul'dan and Teron'gor used.''

Take the Demonic Gateway to wind up inside Auchindoun, just northeast of [[Retribution Point]], where scores of Auchenai defenders litter the ground.

This completes the "In the Shadows of Auchindoun" chapter of [[Don't Let the Tala-door Hit You on the Way Out (Alliance)]], concluding the [[Talador storyline]]. At level 96, the [[Spires of Arak storyline]] begins with [[News from Spires of Arak (Alliance)]] at [[Fort Wrynn]].
