==Objectives==
Kill Xanatos the Defiler in [[Deathweb Hollow]] and retrieve Sha'tari.
* [[Xanatos the Defiler]] slain
* [[Sha'tari (item)]]

==Description==
I've learned that the {{Au|Shadow Council}} is using the nearby [[deathweb spider]]s' venom to spread [[fel]] corruption and augment their forces after their defeat at the [[Burning Front]].

One of my soulbinders saw a [[dreadlord]] headed into the eastern mines with Sha'tari, one of the remaining pieces of the [[Heart of Auchindoun]].

I need you to wrest Sha'tari from the dreadlord's quivering corpse and bring it to me, champion.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sha'tari Keeper Chestplate
|Sha'tari Deadeye Vest
|Talador Sentinel Vest
|Auchenai Keeper Robe
}}


You will also receive:
* {{cost|15|40|}}
* 14,240 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did the foul demon have Sha'tari as we thought?

==Completion==
Just as I suspected. Thank you, <name>. With Sha'tari back in our possession there is only one piece of the Heart left to retrieve.

==Notes==
''On accept:''
: {{text|say|Soulbinder Nyami|[[Auchindoun (alternate universe)|Auchindoun]] is safe as long as it is kept sealed.  We need to retrieve the fragments so my priests can protect them.}}

Pick up [[Antivenin]] and [[Vile Defilers (Horde)]] before heading out.

Kill spiders and egg-watchers. Click on defiling crystals. Try to break open [[Deathweb Cocoon]]s, as they may contain friendly NPCs. If all four are freed, a reward will be offered in town.

Enter the mine at the southeastern end of [[Deathweb Hollow]].

Xanatos and the Sha'tari defense crystal are on the bottom floor of the main chamber.
:{{text|say|Xanatos the Defiler|Ah, there you are. I thought I smelled <race>.}}
Upstairs is rare spider [[Klikixx]], who drops [[Klikixx's Webspinner]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]].
