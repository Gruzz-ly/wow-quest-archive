==Objectives==
Obtain 12 chunks of Jovite Ore from within [[Kuuro's Claim]].
*[[Jovite Ore]] (12)

==Description==
[[Master Smith Ared|Ared]] and I came this way because we needed a good supply of metal to build his designs and some of the best metal is the jovite that comes from the mine in Kuuro's Claim. In order to supply the artillery tower I'm going to need this metal.

Unfortunately that place was recently overwhelmed by a pack of [[goren]], so you're going to have to fight your way in to get the ore before they manage to devour it.

Nothing that should be too much of a problem for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14250 [[XP]]
*20 [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
We need to get that ore before those goren eat it all.

==Completion==
These look pretty good. Ared would have loved to get his hands on these.

<Miall wipes away a tear.>

I'm sorry, this is making me too emotional, these will do just fine.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Iridium Recovery (Alliance)]] and [[Gas Guzzlers (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Exit the garrison to the east past [[Sharptusk Lake]] to reach [[Kuuro's Claim]]. Enter the mine and start killing goren and geodes. Make sure to ''use the quest item'' on the goren corpses to get quest credit for Gas Guzzlers! Jovite Ore is blue-green and on the mine walls.

Stick to the southern wall of the mine to get to the upper level, where at {{co|78.2|14.7|Talador}} all the way in the back, is a pile of [[Pure Crystal Dust]]. The dust contains an [[Iridium Inlaid Band]].

==Progression==
