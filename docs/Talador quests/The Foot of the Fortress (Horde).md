==Objectives==
Speak to [[Magister Krelas]] at the entrance to [[Gordal Fortress]].

==Description==
We've enkindled your forces and the scroll is ready.

It's time for phase two - stealing a nexus crystal from a heavily fortified [[ogre]] compound.

We'll save the scroll to bring in reinforcements in our confrontation with the Gordunni Witch Lord. Let's meet at the base of the Gordal Foothills and take what is more or less rightfully yours!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|30}}
*1400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
My apologies for teleporting away. It's cheating, I know.

I merely wanted to put a fire under your feet to get here quickly!

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Magister Krelas|I will meet you at the base of the fortress.}}

Head to the southern half of the zone, east of {{Au|Auchindoun}}, to find [[Magister Krelas]] recovering her mana after teleporting to the [[Gordal Foothills]].

==Progression==
