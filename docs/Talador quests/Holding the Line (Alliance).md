==Objectives==
Slay 15 demons in the [[Burning Front]].
*Demons slain (15)

==Description==
It is good to see you again, champion.

Demons are assaulting {{Au|Auchindoun}} and we are barely standing our ground against them.

We need to push our front lines forward lest our losses reach critical mass.

If your blade is with us, shove it into these foul creatures' throats.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 16350 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
All of Auchindoun, and the countless souls within, depends on our success.

==Completion==
I only hope we are enough.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Powering the Defenses (Alliance)]], [[Every Bit Counts (Alliance)]], [[The Heart of Auchindoun]], and [[Disrupting the Flow]] before heading out. [[Every Bit Counts (Alliance)]] is a side quest and not part of the main storyline.

[[Abyssal Invader]]s, [[Burning Hunter]]s, [[Legion Assailant]]s, and [[Shadow Council Pyromancer]]s all count.

In the northeastern part of the quest area, where [[O'mogg Blackheart]] and the [[Karab'uun]] defense crystal are found, one of three rare demons will spawn every five minutes: [[Galzomar]], a [[terrorguard]], [[Kharazos the Triumphant]], a [[wrathguard]], and [[Sikthiss, Maiden of Slaughter]], a [[shivarra]]. The share a loot table, dropping the [[Burning Legion Missive (toy)]], so don't bother waiting for all of them to spawn.

==Progression==
{{In the Shadows of Auchindoun}}
