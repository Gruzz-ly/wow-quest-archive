==Objectives==
Slay Vizier Vorgorsh, Vizier Zulmork, and Vizier Cromaug.
*[[Vizier Vorgorsh]] slain {{co|68.5|82.9|Talador}}
*[[Vizier Zulmork]] slain {{co|67.0|77.0|Talador}}
*[[Vizier Cromaug]] slain {{co|66.8|81.0|Talador}}

==Description==
To secure the fortress we need to kill [[Witch Lord Morkurk]], but I don't think we should go straight after him.

His three lieutenants - Vorgorsh, Zulmork, and Cromaug - are all powerful mages, and all of them are fiercely loyal to Morkurk.

I suspect that if we engage the Witch Lord that they will rush to his aid. Let's take them out so that cannot happen.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We need to make sure those viziers are taken care of before we can deal with Morkurk.

==Completion==
Now with the viziers gone the whole Gordunni enchantment trade with the Iron Horde will come crashing down!

We can now turn our attention to dealing with Morkurk.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Supply Recovery (Horde)]] and [[Prized Repossessions (Horde)]] before heading out.

''On accept of all three, Morketh joins the party'':

Start killing ogres to acquire their maces. Crates of Iron Horde Shipments litter the ground, so interact with one to launch a flare and summon one of Gazlowe's copters to pick it up.

Inside the fortress, keep an eye out for rare hydra [[Gennadian]], which drops the [[Scales of Gennadian]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]].

At the southeastern end of the quest area, inside the tower just south of [[Gennadian]]'s position, find [[Vizier Vorgorsh]]:
:{{text|say|Vizier Vorgorsh|You will never take our land!}}
:{{text|say|Morketh Bladehowl|A fine strike! Two remain.}}
Head north across the raised platform to the northeastern tower to find [[Vizier Zulmork]]:
:{{text|say|Vizier Zulmork|Help! Guards! Where are they? Fine, I'll kill you myself!}}
:{{text|say|Morketh Bladehowl|Only Cromaug remains now.}}
Head southwest to the last tower to find [[Vizier Cromaug]]:
:{{text|say|Vizier Cromaug|It will be a pleasure blasting you into the ground!}}
:{{text|say|Morketh Bladehowl|...}}

Also, in the fourth tower (the one immediately to the northeast of the [[Throne of the Witch Lord]]), find an [[Iron Box]] which contains a [[Gordunni Skullthumper]] and roughly {{cost|15}}.
