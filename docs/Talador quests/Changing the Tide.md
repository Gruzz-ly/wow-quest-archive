== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Restalaan (alternate universe)|Restalaan]] at [[Retribution Point]].

== Description ==
It is time to retaliate against this foe. Meet me at Retribution Point and we will take this fight to the [[Shadow Council (alternate universe)|Shadow Council]].

[[Teron'gor]] shall not feast on another soul so long as we stand in his way! His reign of terror ends today.

''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Restalaan|I fear that even with the Heart intact, [[Auchindoun (alternate universe)|Auchindoun]]'s defenses may not be enough. The Shadow Council has eyes everywhere.}}
:{{text|say|Restalaan|We must deny Teron'gor entrance to Auchindoun. Come, let us meet at Retribution Point and discuss how to bring the fight to the enemy.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||53|50}}
* 350 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Progress ==
''On approach'':
:{{text|say|[[Lady Liadrin]]|[[:Leafshadow]] has hidden our position from Teron'gor, and his forces have not yet left [[Gul'rok]] for their final march on Auchindoun. We have the element of surprise on our side.}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|They are far too powerful to attack head on. Restalaan is most familiar with this area. I believe he has a plan.}}

== Completion ==
Our enemy has been pushed back and Auchindoun's defenses restored thanks to your help, but we are not yet done here.

== Notes ==
Before heading to Retribution Point, turn in [[Never Forget]] and [[Payback]] on the other side of [[Telmor (alternate universe)|Telmor]]. Then head northwest to Retribution Point. Exarch Maladaar and Lady Liadrin have brought a small squad of forces and Restalaan has set up Leafshadow to hide from Teron'gor's forces. Pick up the flight path!

==Progression==
{{In the Shadows of Auchindoun}}
