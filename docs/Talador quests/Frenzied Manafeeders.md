==Objectives==
Use the Arcane Dissipator on 8 Frenzied Manafeeders.
*[[Frenzied Manafeeder]]s soothed (8)
*[[Dissipation Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
There is a rare breed of [[moth]] in [[Talador]] known as the Manafeeder. These moths sustain themselves by feeding on arcane crystal dust from the [[Jorune Mine|mine]].

Typically speaking, these moths are nothing more than an occasional nuisance. However, they are now gorging themselves upon the intense arcane energy flooding out of the mine and have become highly territorial and aggressive.

I have attuned this crystal to disperse arcane energy. Please use it on the Frenzied Manafeeders to soothe them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 16350 XP

==Progress==
Have you used the Arcane Dissipator on the Manafeeders yet?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. These moths are typically peaceful creatures and are deserving of mercy.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Trouble In The Mine]] before heading out.

Weaken manafeeders to 35% health or less, then use the quest item on them.  If you are lvl 100 with a bodyguard, lightly attack it and let the bodyguard deal with it while you start clicking on the crystal when it drops below 50%. The crystal will work instantly.
