Look through Thaelin's Observicopter.
*Look through Thaelin's Observicopter {{co|63.1|26.2|Talador}}

==Description==
An ally of yours, [[Thaelin Darkanvil|Thaelin]], is helping us counter the [[Iron Horde]].

He claims this device can be used to spy on the enemy, even so far as hearing what they are saying at great distance.

I do not trust such devices. Use it and let me know what you see.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40}}
*16150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Take a look through Thaelin's Observicopter. I don't trust that machine.

==Completion==
{{Au|Orgrim Doomhammer|Orgrim}} leads the Iron Horde in [[Talador]]... Now we know the face of our enemy.

==Notes==
Interact with Thaelin's Observicopter up on the hill behind Maraad as it flies to the south to [[Mor'gran Logworks]]:
