==Objectives==
Collect 6 Zapper Sacs from Lakebottom Zappers in Talador.
*[[Zapper Sac]] (6)

==Description==
You gotta help me fix this robot. I'm friggin' hungry!

I built the Pleasure-Bot 8000 to locate Draenor truffles, and what does it do? It swims to this stupid island and shorts its power fluctuator.

I got it hooked up to these batteries, but it ain't enough juice to jump it.

Be a doll and get me the zapper sacs from the electric eels in the lake, would ya? They oughta be enough.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40|}} 
* 14,380 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You got the stuff, buddy?

==Completion==
Yeah, that's the stuff! You're a good business partner, considering you're a <class> and all.

Now let's just mash these into this port...
