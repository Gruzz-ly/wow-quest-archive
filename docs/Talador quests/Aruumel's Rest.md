==Objectives==
Enter the Spirit Realm and destroy the Memory of Arumel.
* [[Aruumel]] slain
* [[Elixir of Memories]] (provided)

==Description==
It is my job to see what others cannot. I keep the memories and read them for others, but I can no longer do so because of my son.

My son turned his back on the light. When he perished I could not stand the thought that his spirit might not be welcomed into Auchindoun.

I interfered and trapped him here. Now he twists and tortures the memories until they cannot be read.

You must do what I cannot bear to do myself. Use this elixir to enter the spirit realm...

...and destroy my son's spirit.

Some memories are better left forgotten. Thank you, <name>.

I will return you to our world.
