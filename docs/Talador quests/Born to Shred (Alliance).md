==Objectives==
Kill 100 Iron Horde in [[Tuurem]] using the Iron Shredder.
*Take control of the Iron Shredder
*Iron Horde slain in Tuurem (100)

==Description==
I've got this prototype shredder operating on most cylinders.

Boy, will they be surprised when you stomp them with their own machine!

Can't wait to watch you from the safety of the Observicopter.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40}}
*16150 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}
*35 [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
You've got a license to shred!

==Completion==
-- ENEMIES ELIMINATED --

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Thaelin Darkanvil|I got 'er all fixed up for ya!}}

Now that Thaelin has fixed the shredder, it has two usable abilities:
#{{abilities|Electrostatic Distortion|range=60|Inflicts Nature damage to enemies near the lightning orb.|notes=Instant.|cd=1.5 sec}}
#{{abilities|Death from Above|range=10-70|Inflicts Nature damage to enemies at the targeted location and knocks them back.|notes=Instant.|cd=6 sec}}
While out of combat, the shredder is buffed with "Pedal to the Metal: Movement speed increased by 50% when out of combat."

Run west to the [[Archenon Siegeyard]], then cut south across the ford in the river to reach [[Tuurem]]. Then start attacking everything that moves. Try to throw a sawblade at a group of enemies, then jump to them to clear out any stragglers.

Once 100 are dead, click on the Iron Shredder Prototype mech (don't get out of it!) to turn in.
