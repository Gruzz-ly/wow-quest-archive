==Objectives==
Bring the Mysterious Hat to [[Zooti Fizzlefury]] at [[Khadgar's Tower]] in [[Talador]].
*[[Mysterious Hat]] (Provided)

==Description==
Energy flows from this mystical hat with an unseen strength. It hums as it drifts back and forward in time where it rests on the ground.

This is the sort of object that someone at Khadgar's Tower would find very interesting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|30|80|}}
*3,770 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It is so nice to finally be able to research my passion without those interfering [[bronze dragon]]s showing up.

==Completion==
Now THAT is a hat. See how it flickers in and out of time as if someone were temporally jiggling it?

I'd try putting it on if I weren't afraid it would wipe me from [[alternate timeline|the timeline]].

==Progression==
#[[Mysterious Boots (quest)]], [[Mysterious Hat (quest)]], [[Mysterious Ring (quest)]], [[Mysterious Staff (quest)]]
#[[Temporal Juxtaposition]]
