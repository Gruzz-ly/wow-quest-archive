==Objectives==
Destroy 6 Iron Horde Siege Engines.
*[[Iron Horde Siege Engine|Siege Weapons]] destroyed (6)

==Description==
The [[orc]]s themselves are not the only threat. They still have siege weapons of significant power.

They've already been used against [[Tuurem]], and we must not allow for their continued operation.

Sabotage siege weapons using the explosives you collected from the [[lumber mill|logging camp]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40}}
*16150 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
I fear that Maraad might be losing the light... if he has not already lost it.

==Completion==
They will be unable to use those weapons against us when we attack Tuurem.

==Notes==
''On accept''
:{{text|say|Yrel|The Iron Hrode's machines must be disabled. Be careful, <name>.}}

Pick up [[Dreadpiston (Alliance)]] and [[Vol. X Pages ? (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Head northwest of the [[Mor'gran Logworks]] to the [[Archenon Siegeyard]] and start blowing up Iron Horde Siege Engines. [[Burning Blademaster]]s, [[Grom'kar Siegesmith]]s and [[Fireblade Invoker]]s all drop [[Iron Shredder Operation Manual Vol. X Page ?]]. To the north, in the center of the courtyard, is [[Dreadpiston]]. Northeast of Dreadpiston is [[Ahm]], who offers a short side quest: [[Dying Wish (quest)]]. At the western extent of the quest area (on the rise, not down at sea level) is rare orc [[Yazheera the Incinerator]].

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Yrel|Those weapons can no longer be used against our people. Well done, <class>.}}

==Progression==
