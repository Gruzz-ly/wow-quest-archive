*[[Body Pile]]s burned (4)

==Description==
<The note is scrawled hurriedly across the parchment.>

Telmor is lost. The {{Au|Shadow Council}} is dragging our fallen into piles and feeding the souls to their leader. There is blood on my hands...

Please, if anyone reads this message, burn the bodies of our fallen so our enemy cannot use them.

- [[Restalaan (alternate universe)|Restalaan]], Captain of the Guard

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 16350 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Restalaan would be happy to know that someone fulfilled his wishes.

==Completion==
The souls of the citizens of Telmor will no longer be used to empower the Shadow Council leader.

==Notes==
In Telmor for [[Restalaan, Captain of the Guard]], [[Never Forget]], and [[Payback]], find the Hastily Written Note just south of the [[Telmor Registry]] on the northern path. It offers this quest

On the north side of the path is the [[Telmor Registry]]. Pick up an Auchenai Torch from the forge to the right of the Telmor Registry, then head southeast to find the first body pile. The second body pile is opposite the central water fixture, and the third and fourth are in the courtyard to the south. After burning the fourth, Invasion of the Soul Eaters completes automatically.

Inside a building on the southeast side of the mid-level courtyard, find the [[Auchenai Prayerbook]], and the [[Leafshadow]] Crystal is found in the building on northwest side of the same courtyard.

Head southwest to the upper courtyard and enter the westernmost building to find Restalaan just inside. Turn in and pick up [[The Final Piece (Talador)]].
