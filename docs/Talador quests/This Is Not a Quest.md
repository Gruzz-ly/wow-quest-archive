'''This Is Not a Quest''' is exactly what the name says. The {{queststart}} symbol does appear above [[Deceptia]]'s head for both Horde and Alliance players, but it's not intended to be interacted with. This is due to Deceptia and the small area she is located in being exploded by [[Iron Horde]]'s artillery as the player approaches.

Triggering the event will mark this "quest" internally as having been completed.

==Objectives==
Help Deceptia

==Description==
We need help! But not from you...

==Completion==
Haha!
