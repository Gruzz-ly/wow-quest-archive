==Objectives==
Gather 8 Iridium Dust from [[Iridium Geode]]s in [[Kuuro's Claim]].
*[[Iridium Dust]] (8)

==Description==
My goods used to be for the very best, now the Iron Horde make copies out of poor metal and give them to everyone.

I'm going to show them what a real smith can do in your arsenal, but first I'm going to need a powerful flux to make the metal as pure as it can get.

The dust from crushed iridium geodes would work in a pinch but we need to find some first. They tend to congregate underground, so check out the mine in Kuuro's Claim nearby.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14250 [[XP]]
*20 [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
I'm going to need a lot of iridium dust to purify the metal to anywhere near my standards.

==Completion==
This won't be as good as some of the mixes we had back in the Blackrock [[Foundry|foundries]], but it will do.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Out of Jovite (Horde)]] and [[Gas Guzzlers (Horde)]] before heading out.

Exit the garrison to the east past [[Sharptusk Lake]] to reach [[Kuuro's Claim]]. Enter the mine and start killing goren and geodes. Make sure to ''use the quest item'' on the goren corpses to get quest credit for Gas Guzzlers! Jovite Ore is blue-green and on the mine walls.

Stick to the southern wall of the mine to get to the upper level, where at {{co|78.2|14.7|Talador}} all the way in the back, is a pile of [[Pure Crystal Dust]]. The dust contains an [[Iridium Inlaid Band]].

==Progression==
