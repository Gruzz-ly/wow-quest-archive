==Objectives==
Defeat Vindicator Dalu and Soulbinder Halaari.
*[[Vindicator Dalu]] defeated
*[[Soulbinder Halaari]] defeated

==Description==
I was taken captive by the [[Iron Horde]] when they raided our caravan en route to {{Au|Auchindoun}}.

I escaped, but these spirits won't let me through to join my fellow [[Sunsworn]] until someone defeats them in combat!

Please, will you help me defeat them?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40|}}
*14,380 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I appreciate all of your help, hero.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I am truly in your debt.

When I fulfill my duties to [[Lady Liadrin]] I will come find you.
