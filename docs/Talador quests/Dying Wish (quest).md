==Objectives==
Recover Ahm's Heirloom from [[Blademaster Bralok]].
*[[Ahm's Heirloom]] {{co|57.0|24.4|Talador}}

==Description==
I am too far gone to rescue, but thank you for speaking with me.

Blademaster Bralok had his men starve and beat me, and he stole an heirloom that has been in my family since before we arrived on {{Au|Draenor}}.

Should you find it, please let me see it once more so I may die in peace.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40}}
*16150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Blademaster must pay...

==Completion==
Thank you. Now that I know it is out of the hands of the Iron Horde, I can die peacefully.

''On completion, Ahm dies.''

==Notes==
While in [[Archenon Siegeyard]] for [[Vol. X Pages ?]], [[Dreadpiston (quest)]], and [[Iron Them Out]], find [[Ahm]] in the central courtyard, north of where Dreadpiston could be found. He offers this quest.

Head just north to the building to find [[Blademaster Bralok]] jumping hither and yon. Take him out, loot the keepsake, and return to Ahm.

==Progression==
{{The Battle for Shattrath}}
