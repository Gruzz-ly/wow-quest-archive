== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Vindicator Doruu]].

== Description ==
The [[Jorune Mine]] is in trouble!

We recently unearthed an exceedingly large and powerful arcane crystal; however, something has gone terribly wrong and the energy from the crystal is flooding the mine.

The [[Auchenai (alternate universe)|Auchenai]] have already sent their [[Vindicators]] into the mine to assist us.

Speak with Vindicator Doruu inside of the mine, he'll know how you can help.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|38}}
* 1,650 XP

== Completion ==
The Vindicators welcome you, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Frenzied Manafeeders]] before heading out. Head north into the mine proper.
