== Objectives ==
Find 20 Manual Pages on orcs at [[Archenon Siegeyard]].
*[[Iron Shredder Operation Manual Vol. X Page ?]] x20

== Description ==
The manual for the shredder was wedged in there, but it's missing lots of pages. We need to find as many pages of that manual as possible and I might--MIGHT--be able to get this shredder operational. Based on the direction of the wind, I bet the pages flew toward Archenon Siegeyard.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|40}}
* 16150 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
I don't know why those idiots don't just collect all the pages in one place.

== Completion ==
Lots of detail... almost as if a goblin wrote it!

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
