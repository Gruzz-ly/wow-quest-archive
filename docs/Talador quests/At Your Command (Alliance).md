==Description==
I'm glad you're here!

[[Fort Wrynn]] is nearly complete. We only need to fill this last plot.

[[Baros Alexston|Baros]] provided us with blueprints for two different structures that would fit this space - an [[Wrynn Artillery Tower|Artillery Tower]] or an [[Arcane Sanctum (Fort Wrynn)|Arcane Sanctum]].

It's your call, commander. The plans are on the drafting table for your perusal.

==Rewards==

Excellent. This will do nicely.
