: {{text|say|Soulbinder Nyami|We must recover Karab'uun at all costs.  March forward the moment you see a hole in their lines!}}

==Objectives==
Defeat O'mogg Blackheart and retrieve Karab'uun in the [[Burning Front]].
*[[O'mogg Blackheart]] slain {{co|56.5|62.7|Talador}}
*[[Karab'uun]] {{co|56.7|62.5|Talador}}

==Description==
A band of {{Au|Shadow Council}} orcs stole the Heart of Auchindoun!

The Heart powers all of {{Au|Auchindoun}}'s defenses. Thankfully we were able to save its core and one of its four pieces.

The warlock O'mogg Blackheart is using Karab'uun, one of the stolen pieces, to power the largest portal in the Burning Front. Return Karab'uun to me.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Eredar Soulchain
|Warbeads of the Blackheart
|Vacant Soul Crystal
|Soulcrystal Dust Pendant
|Legion Lord's Gorget
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|5|35|}}
* 750 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
I trust you have Karab'uun. I am not known for my patience when the countless souls inside Auchindoun are in danger.

==Completion==
<Soulbinder nyami's lips curl into a smile.>

Well done. Only two pieces remain. I've already dispatched my soulbinders to track them down.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Holding the Line (Alliance)]], [[Powering the Defenses (Alliance)]], and [[Disrupting the Flow]] before heading out. [[Every Bit Counts (Alliance)]] is a side quest and not part of the main storyline.

[[O'mogg Blackheart]] is found guarding the [[Karab'uun]] defense crystal in the northeastern part of the quest area.

In the northeastern part of the quest area, where [[O'mogg Blackheart]] and the [[Karab'uun]] defense crystal are found, one of three rare demons will spawn every five minutes: [[Galzomar]], a [[terrorguard]], [[Kharazos the Triumphant]], a [[wrathguard]], and [[Sikthiss, Maiden of Slaughter]], a [[shivarra]]. The share a loot table, dropping the [[Burning Legion Missive (toy)]], so don't bother waiting for all of them to spawn.

==Progression==
{{In the Shadows of Auchindoun}}
