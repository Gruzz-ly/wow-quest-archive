==Objectives==
Speak to [[Magister Serena]] at [[Fort Wrynn]].

==Description==
We did it! We have all of the reagents for the scroll. Your arcane sanctum will be the talk of {{Au|Draenor}} before long.

I'll go back to Fort Wrynn to finish it and gather your men. Meet me there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|30}}
*1400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Now we can tackle getting that artificial nexus for your tower.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Magister Serena|I will go back to your outpost to make the scroll. See you there!}}
: ''Serena teleports away.''

Back at [[Fort Wrynn]], a handful of side quests are now open: some side quests have opened up: [[Sloan McCoy]] starts [[One Step Ahead (Alliance)]], starting the "The Battle for Shattrath" chapter of the [[Talador storyline]], [[Patrick Messer]] has some bounties available, and [[Quartermaster O'Riley]] has another chain starting with [[Why Is The Brew Gone?]].

As the next quest in this chain takes place halfway across the zone, consider some of the side quests...

;On approach
:{{text|say|Magister Serena|Stay frosty, men. You're going to teleport into the heart of ogre territory.}}
