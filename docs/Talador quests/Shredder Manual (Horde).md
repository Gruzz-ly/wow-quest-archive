==Objectives==
Find the Iron Shredder Decommission Orders.

==Description==
I've been hearing rumors of this new prototype shredder the Iron Horde's engineers have been working on. I think we ought to investigate. A shadow hunter spotted some sort of shredder manual, and it might have something to do with that prototype.

==Completion==
These orders appear to have come from Orgrim Doomhammer.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|34|}}
