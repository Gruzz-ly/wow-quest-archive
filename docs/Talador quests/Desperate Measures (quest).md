== Objectives ==
Gather the Ango'rosh Spellbook and the Grimoire of Binding, then perform the ritual at the [[Altar of Ango'rosh]] in the [[Ango'rosh Ruins]].
*[[Ango'rosh Spellbook]] {{co|39.5|83.6|Talador}}
*[[Grimoire of Binding]] {{co|42.7|84.9|Talador}}
*Ritual performed {{co|41.1|82.4|Talador}}

== Description ==
We've identified the location of [[Teron'gor]]'s compound, but his forces are already far stronger than anything we've ever faced. We need to gain an edge, and quickly.

The cursed spirits of the Ango'rosh ogres, our ancient enemies, linger in nearby ruins. Go there and gather the Ango'rosh Spellbook and the Grimoire of Binding.

Perform the ritual described within at their altar to lift their curse and seek their aid.

It's a long shot, but we don't have any other options.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|5|35|}}
* 2,750 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Progress ==
Were you able to acquire the aid of the Ango'rosh?

== Completion ==
You radiate the power of the Ango'rosh!

<Restalaan smiles.>

It is time to take this battle to Teron'gor's doorstep.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Ogre Diplomacy]] before heading out.

Both named mobs, [[Dur'gol the Ruthless]] and [[Mok'war the Terrible]], are on the south side of the [[Ango'rosh Ruins]] quest area. Kill them both for their item, and kill other [[Ango'rosh Crusher]]s, [[Ango'rosh Spellweaver]]s and [[Ango'rosh Hunter]]s.

On the northwest side of the quest area is the Altar of Ango'rosh. Interact with the altar and let the channel finish:

:{{text|say|Agg'thok the Eternal|We will help you defeat your enemies. We will repay our debt to you, tiny one.}}
:''Agg'thok buffs the player with "Might of Ango'rosh: Chance on hit to summon Ango'rosh ogres to aid you in combat."''
