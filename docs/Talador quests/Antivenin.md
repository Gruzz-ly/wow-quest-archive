==Objectives==
Collect 9 Deathweb Fangs in [[Deathweb Hollow]].
*[[Deathweb Fang]] (9)

==Description==
I'm worried about [[Soulbinder Nyami|Nyami]].  She's so focused on retrieving the Heart of Auchindoun that she seems to have lost sight of everything else.

I'm sorry, I'm not trying to belittle her wisdom, but look around!  Every soldier we sent into the mine has been gravely injured by the deathweb spiders.  Their wounds need immediate attention!

Please, can you retrieve some fangs from the spiders?  I can use them to create an antivenin, but I need to stay here and keep them stable until then.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|5|35|}}
* 2,750 [[XP]]
*{{Alliance}} +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Do you have the fangs?  We don't have much time!

==Completion==
Bless you, <name>.  There have been enough innocent lives taken today.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Into the Hollow]] and [[Vile Defilers]] before heading out.

Kill spiders and egg-watchers. Click on defiling crystals. Try to break open [[Deathweb Cocoon]]s, as they may contain friendly NPCs. If all four are freed, a reward will be offered in town.

Enter the mine at the southeastern end of [[Deathweb Hollow]].

Xanatos and the Sha'tari defense crystal are on the bottom floor of the main chamber.
:{{text|say|Xanatos the Defiler|Ah, there you are. I thought I smelled <race>.}}
Upstairs is rare spider [[Klikixx]], who drops [[Klikixx's Webspinner]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]].

''On completion:''
:{{text|say|Soulbinder Nyami|Tuulani, go to [[Telmor (alternate universe)|Telmor]] and meet with [[Soulbinder Aedraa]]. She has retrieved the final fragment and brought it there.}}
:{{text|say|Soulbinder Tuulani|Right away.}}
