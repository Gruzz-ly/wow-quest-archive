This quest is part of a chain that leads to obtaining the [[Medallion of Karabor]]. You must have completed the chain ending with [[Akama's Promise]].

==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Warden's Cage]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] and speak to [[Akama]].

==Description==
Thanks again, <name>. I recognize your name. Akama has entrusted you with his plans and so I will trust you as well.

The naga discovered I was working against [[Illidan]] and tried to get me to speak by torturing me. I did not tell them a thing - Akama himself taught me to master pain through meditation.

Illidan asked the naga to bring me to him. He would have seen right through my flesh and into my soul's deepest secrets.

Akama must be warned. Our plans are in jeopardy!

==Completion==
I thank you, <name>. Olum is one of my dearest friends and most trusted followers. His contributions have been of vital importance to our plans.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|80}}

==Notes==
Seer Olum spawns in [[Serpentshrine Cavern]] after slaying [[Fathom-Lord Karathress]].

:''Olum walks up to Akama.''
:{{text|say|Olum|Akama, my friend.  Have you been informed?  I was found out by [[Vashj]]'s followers.  Now our secret is in peril!}}
:{{text|say|Akama|Olum, old friend, it is good to see that you are safe.}}
:{{text|say|Olum|Illidan is looking for me.  I'm not safe here; none of us are.}}
:{{text|say|Akama|Illidan will become suspicious, that much is for certain.  We will deal with it as we always do.}}
:{{text|say|Olum|Illidan will find me.  And when he does, he will pry the Ashtongue secret from me.  Such is the power of the Betrayer!  Now, there is only one way.  My usefulness to the cause has come to an end.  I must venture into the spirit world.}}
:{{text|say|Akama|You cannot be serious, Olum.  Your sacrifice has already been too great.}}
:{{text|say|Olum|My decision is final.  I will not be dissuaded.  I have devoted my life to my plan.  To jeopardize it now would betray all who have died for the cause long before me.}}
:{{text|say|Akama|It appears your mind is set then.  We will guide you to the spirit world, with as much kindness as we can.}}
:{{text|say|Olum|I thank you, Akama.  You honor me by allowing me this moment, surrounded by my brothers.  Farewell friend, guide our people well.}}
:{{text|say|Akama|Farewell dear friend.  We shall meet you in the next world when our duties in this one are fulfilled.}}
:''Akama puts Olum to rest.  Shortly thereafter, he summons Illidan.''
:{{text|say|Akama|Master, we've found the traitor who escaped Vashj!  His body lies in front of me, lifeless.}}
:{{text|say|Illidan|You disappoint me Akama.  I wanted to question the treacherous worm myself!  I'm beginning to question your allegiance, broken.}}
:{{text|say|Akama|But sire!  You have misjudged my actions... I do have knowledge of one close to you who plans to betray you!  It is that dog [[Kael'thas]]!  He has allied with [[Kil'jaeden]] and intends to replace you as Lord of Outland!}}
:{{text|say|Illidan|I do not sense lies in your voice Akama.  That Kael'thas would betray me does not come a big surprise.  I'm not as oblivious as some would think.  That one of your own was involved with him puts your loyalties into question.}}
:{{text|say|Illidan|Send your Ashtongue into [[Tempest Keep]] and slay his most prized possession, the [[phoenix]] known as [[Al'ar]].  I must know that you're not on his side.  Do not think of betraying me, broken.  We both know who owns your soul.}}
:{{text|say|Akama|It will be done, my lord.}}
