The final showdown: Destroy [[Illidan Stormrage (tactics)|Illidan Stormrage]], and free Outland from his iron grip!

==Objectives==
[[Seer Kanai]] wants you to defeat Illidan inside the [[Black Temple]].
*{{NPC||Illidan Stormrage (tactics)||Illidan Stormrage}} slain
*[[Medallion of Karabor]]

==Description==
With Illidan's lieutenants defeated, [[Akama]] will be able to force open the doors to Illidan's sanctum. Be ready to bring your force inside as soon as Akama does.

We still do not know what has become of [[Maiev]], but we must make our move without her.

I hope your force is up to the task. Illidan will not be pleased to see Akama. 

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:|Blessed Medallion of Karabor}}
You will also receive: {{cost|13|20}}

==Progress==
Yes, <name>? 

==Completion==
It is as it was foretold, <name>.  One by one, Illidan's lieutenants have fallen... and now the Betrayer himself has met his demise!

Know this, <name>: every decision Akama made and every moment of his life since Illidan arrived, Akama planned for this moment.  Illidan is finally dead and our people... are free! 

==Notes==
The Medallion was required to enter the Black Temple. This quest allows the bearer to upgrade it so that it can teleport the bearer to the Black Temple's gates from anywhere (much like [[Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian]] is used to teleport wielders - and their parties - to Karazhan).
