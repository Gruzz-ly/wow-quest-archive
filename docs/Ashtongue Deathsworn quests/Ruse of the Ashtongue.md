==Objectives==
Travel into [[Eye (Tempest Keep)|Tempest Keep]] and slay [[Al'ar]] while wearing the Ashtongue Cowl. Return to [[Akama]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] once you've completed this task.
* [[Ashtongue Cowl]] (Provided)

==Description==
[[Olum]]'s sacrifice was tremendous. I would never have asked him to give up his life myself. But it is done.

If we're to lure [[Illidan]] back into a false sense of security, we need to do his bidding - at least for now.

I command a vast army of Ashtongue, but - aside from the Deathsworn - none can be trusted.

You are to perform the deed that Illidan demands. Take this cowl; it is magical in nature. You will appear to be one of my men to any who see you slaying Kael's phoenix, Al'ar.

==Progress==
Is the deed done, <name>?  Illidan is not a patient master!

==Completion==
You've done well, <name>.  This will bring us a step closer to shifting Illidan's focus away from us and from...

<Akama looks in [[Maiev Shadowsong]]'s direction.>

More work remains to be done, <name>.

==Progression==
