==Objectives==
Go to the Caverns of Time in Tanaris and gain access to the Battle of Mount Hyjal. Once inside, defeat Rage Winterchill and bring the Time-Phased Phylactery to Akama in Shadowmoon Valley.

==Description==
Illidan's attention is now on Kael'thas, thanks to you. The time has come to make our move.

I've had a vision of an artifact that will aid us in our final struggle - the phylactery of a lich known as Winterchill. Unfortunately its power was lost forever after his defeat in the Battle of Mount Hyjal.

There might be a way to retrieve this artifact, however. Legend speaks of a place in Azeroth guarded by bronze dragons... a place where past and present meet. It is there you will find what we seek.

==Progress==
Have you retrieved the phylactery yet, <name>?

==Completion==
My vision... it all becomes clear now.  The powers this artifact has over a soul.... to contain it... to siphon it into itself... I will use those powers to reclaim what belongs to me!  The time has arrived for us to take the fight to Illidan!

==Progression==
