==Objectives==
Help [[Akama]] wrest control back of his soul by defeating the [[Shade of Akama]] inside the [[Black Temple]]. Return to [[Seer Kanai]] when you've completed this task.

==Description==
When [[Illidan]] obtained the [[Broken]]'s allegiance, Akama was our wisest. He knew that openly opposing the Betrayer would lead to the extinction of our race.

Instead he has plotted and schemed for this very moment under utmost secrecy. Failure would be catastrophic... not just for Akama, not just for the Broken, but for all of [[Outland]]. No one this close to Illidan has ever been able to deliver such a terrible blow to him.

Help Akama free his soul and he will grant you access to Illidan's sanctum.

==Progress==
Yes, <name>?

==Completion==
It is done, <name>.  The time to strike at Illidan has come.

==Progression==
{{The Fall of the Betrayer}}
