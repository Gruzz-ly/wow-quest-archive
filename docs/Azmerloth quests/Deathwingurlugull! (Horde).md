==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|yell|Amrrgla Grglllhrrt|Deathwingurlugull delgrbrrl!!}}

[[Amrrgla Grglllhrrt]], of the Finning Furies, flies a Murloc Hopper in and sets it down a few yards away. Hop in:
:{{text|say|Amrrgla Grglllhrrt|Grl grl argll awrrrgglllll!}}

She takes off and starts a bombing run circling around [[Deathwingurlugull]]. Players have access to four abilities:
#{{Abilities|Fishbolts|Cast a bolt made of spoiled fish.|id=385859|icon=sha_inv_misc_slime_01|cd=1 sec}}
#{{Abilities|Toxic Puffersplosion|Shower the enemy in toxin-infused pufferfish guts.|id=385862|icon=ability_monk_chiexplosion|cd=8 sec}}
#{{Abilities|Charge of the Azmurlocs|Call on your fellow flying Azmerloths for a coordinated fishbolt strike!|id=385870|icon=inv_babymurloc3_red|cd=14 sec}}
#{{Abilities|Murky Bubble|Allow time to repair the Hopper and negate damage inside a bubble of murk.|id=385867|icon=|cd=12 sec}}

Deathwingurlugull is still using his breath attack indiscriminately. Some of those breaths will hit the hopper, so make sure to heal!

While flying, Amrrgla can say any of:
*{{text|say|Finning Fury|Fllrshagglll!}}
*{{text|say|Finning Fury|Fhhhhhhhhsh!!}}
*{{text|say|Finning Fury|Blllgh mrgle shmgg!}}
*{{text|say|Finning Fury|Deathwingurlugull delgrbrrl!!}}

After landing, all the murlocs are celebrating, launching fireworks, including [[Vrglok Saurfin]], [[Murkdeep]], [["Captain" Cookie]], [[Gillvanas]], [[Sir Finley Mrrgglton]], [[Mmmrrrggglll]], [[Sefin]], [[Baine Blrrgfin]], [[Tyrgglrn Webbedring]], and [[Old Murk-Eye]].
