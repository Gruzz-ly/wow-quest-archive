==Objectives==
Drain 12 Temporal Motes.
*Temprgrlglr Motes collected (12)

==Description==
An alternate timeline born from [[murloc]]s??!

Forgive my selfishness, but would you obtain a few stray motes of temporal energy while you locate [[Chronormu|Ambassador Chronomu]]{{sic}}? 

Just walk into them and your staff should do the rest. I will examine the data later. When we are not in the middle of venturing through rips in [[Azeroth]]'s varied realities.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
* [[Heart of Azmerloth]]
* {{cost|27|62|}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
I have no doubt we shall succeed against the Infinite this day, and studying this foreign energy will be our reward!

==Completion==
Astounding work! 

Now, what do you imagine the murlocs of this Murloc World are? I shudder to think...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Mugurlglrlgl!]] from [[Varian Wryngrrlgulgll]] or [[Thrallgrulgulgul]] next to [[Andantenormu]] before heading out.

Temprgrlglr Motes are marked on the minimap all over the quest area.

Don't get too close to [[Deathwingurlugull]], as the fires on the ground will Fear the player away and deal 7% of max health in damage every second!
