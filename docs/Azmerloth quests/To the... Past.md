==Objectives==
Take the portal and meet with [[Andantenormu]] in [[Azmerloth]].
*Portal to Azmerloth taken {{co|60.0|82.1|Thaldraszus}}

==Description==
It is regrettable that we could not stabilize [[Chronormu]], but there is another potential location where we may be able to catch her and bring an end to her fall through [[time]].

<[[Nozdormu]] frowns.>

The glimpses of this timeline past are... strange. Even among some of the visions I have witnessed in my life.

Be on your guard, <name>. I am uncertain what you will face, but it is powerful and... oddly familiar.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Whatever I expected... This is not it.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Andantenormu, you shall hold the second portal open.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|It is... a strange place. I imagine you will find it fascinating.}}
:{{text|say|Andantenormu|I will go at once, my lord.}}
:''Dante runs through the Portal to Azmerloth that spawns.''

On the other side of the loading screen, players spawn on the [[Path of the Titans]] south of [[Wyrmrest Temple]], set in an alternate version of the [[Dragon Soul]] raid. [[Deathwingurlugull]] is attacking, while [[Varian Wryngrrlgulgll]], [[Finduin Wryngrrlgulgll]] and [[Thrallgrulgulgul]] are next to [[Andantenormu]].

==Progression==
