==Objectives==
Relive the siege of the [[Firelands]].
* [[Ragnaros (Firelands tactics)|Ragnaros]] defeated
* [[Time-Locked Cinder]]

==Description==
You're early <name>, I hadn't even sent for you yet.

Another temporal distubrance{{sic}} has flared up, this time in the Firelands. If [[Ragnaros]] hadn't been dealt with when he was, well, you've already seen one way the end time could turn out.

Some intricate time weaving is required to be sure you catch Ragnaros early, but still after whatever is causing the disturbance. Whoever is doing this isn't messing around any more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Timewarped Treasures]]
*500 [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Progress==
Bring me the temporal anomaly as soon as you can, so we can get back to yesterday's problems tomorrow.

==Completion==
Oh no, time-locking?! Who knows how long this had been there before we were able to detect it! This is far worse than I had imagined!

==Notes==
While this quest is available at level 35, level 50 is required to queue for the Timewalking version of the Firelands.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.1.5|note=Now rewards a [[Cache of Timewarped Treasures]].}}
*{{Patch 8.2.5|note=Added.}}
