==Objectives==
Speak with [[Rehgar Earthfury]] in the [[Firelands]].
* Firelands portal taken

==Description==
As we speak, an endless war rages for control of the Firelands. Of the two aspiring [[Firelord]]s, [[Lord Smolderon]] hates mortals less.

If we help him defeat his rival and ascend to Firelord, he may unite with us in return.

The champions of the [[Earthen Ring]] have already made their way to the Firelands. Go and meet with Rehgar Earthfury and find a way to turn an old enemy into a new ally.

If anyone can succeed at this impossible task, I have faith that it is you, Farseer.

May the elements be with you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
*1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
At last you have arrived, Farseer <name>.

It seems our presence in the Firelands has not gone unnoticed.

==Notes==
Take the portal.

Rehgar Earthfury is accompanied by [[Erunak Stonespeaker]], [[Muln Earthfury]], [[Stormcaller Mylra]], and a [[Earthen Ring Shaman]] in the [[Flamebreach]]. They are standing in front of [[Baron Scaldius]].
