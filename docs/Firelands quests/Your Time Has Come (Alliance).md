== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Coridormi]] in [[Stormwind]].

== Description ==
<A pleasant image fills your mind's eye as a calm voice echoes through your being.>

Young <class>, be still and hear my words.

I am called to collect you, to deliver you, to one whose eye none can escape.

Find me in Stormwind, mortal, for your time has come.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|12|97}}

== Completion ==
Let us begin, mortal.

There is little time to spare.

== Notes ==
This quest is the beginning of the [[Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest]] quest line, which starts when killing a [[Molten Lord]] in the [[Firelands (instance)|Firelands]]. The quest is only given to caster classes capable of wielding the staff (druids, priest, mages, warlocks, shamans, and evokers).
