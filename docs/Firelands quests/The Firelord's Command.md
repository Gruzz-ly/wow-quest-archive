==Objectives==
Defeat the forces of [[Pyroth]].
* [[Slagmaul]] slain
* [[Chargore]] slain
* [[Pyroth's Molten Core]]

==Description==
Greetings, mortal. I am [[Baron Scaldius|Scaldius]], emissary of [[Lord Smolderon]].

I have just met with others from [[Earthen Ring|your order]]. They tell me that you will bring an end to those who oppose my master. This pleases Lord Smolderon.

[[Pyroth]] and his minions defy my master's rule and so an example must be made of them. You will slay Pyroth and his champions!

Nothing is more humiliating than death at the hands of a [[mortal]]. Do this and Lord Smolderon will grant you audience.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I will devour the heart of Pyroth with great pleasure!

==Completion==
The son of [[Rhyolith]] slain by mere mortals? What an ignominious death!

You have done well, shaman. This pleases me greatly.

==Notes==
;Upon accept

:{{Text|say|Baron Scaldius|Our enemies shall burn.}}
:''The present shaman push deeper into the Firelands, while Baron Scaldius starts following the Farseer.''

Follow suit. Further down, more [[Earthen Ring Shaman]] are fighting fire elementals alongside [[Mackay Firebeard]].
:{{Text|say|Mackay Firebeard|I was hopin' for a warm welcome... but this ain'na what I had in mind!}}

;Slagmaul killed
:{{Text|yell|Pyroth|Are you so weak, Lord Smolderon, that you require the help of mortals?}}
:{{Text|yell|Lord Smolderon|These mortals do my bidding. A pity you do not share their enthusiasm!}}

;Death

Loot Pyroth's core and head to [[Mortal's Demise]]. A cutscene starts on approach:
:{{Text|bossemote|Lord Smolderon|You may enter, but spare me your pleas for help, shaman. I know of the Earthen Ring's plan to unite the elements!}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Lord Smolderon|The [[Burning Legion]] threatens us all, but the power of the Firelands must be earned.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Lord Smolderon|Approach my throne and we shall see just how far you will go to save [[Azeroth|this world]]!}}
