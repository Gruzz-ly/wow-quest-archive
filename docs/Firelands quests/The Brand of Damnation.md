==Objectives==
Retrieve Emberscar, Brand of Damnation.
* Fly to [[Beth'tilac's Lair]]
* Emberscar Awakened
* Emberscar Fed
* [[Emberscar, Brand of Damnation]]

==Description==
I require a symbol of my dominion as [[Firelord]]. A weapon that will strike fear into the hearts of all who dare to oppose my rule!

Deep within the den of the [[Cinderweb]], there is an ancient spear born from within the heart of the [[Firelands]]. Emberscar is a living weapon whose wicked power is beyond [[mortal]] comprehension.

Prove your strength and claim Emberscar in my name! If you survive, perhaps I will aid the feeble races of humanity against the [[Burning Legion]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Brand of Damnation will be mine!

==Completion==
I see that you have successfully awakened Emberscar, and that it has been well-fed.

Perhaps you are stronger than I first thought...

==Notes==
Hop on the nearby [[Inferno Hawk]] to fly to the lair.
:{{Text|say|[[Stormcaller Mylra]]|The Farseer approaches! Let's show these blasted bugs what we're made of!}}

Proceed further into the lair.
:{{Text|say|[[Garixxia]]|What a delicious looking intruder! It has been ages since I've dined on mortal flesh! Long have I hungered for the taste...}}

Entering the main area:
:{{Text|say|Garixxia|Welcome to my web, delicious mortal! I do hope you'll stick around!}}

Interact with Emberscar:
:''Emberscar glows.''
:{{Text|yell|Garixxia|This mortal seeks to awaken the cursed weapon! Devour the shaman, my children!}}

[[Cinderweb Ambusher]]s attack it. Kill them.
:{{Text|yell|Garixxia|My precious children! I will devour you!}}

Garixxia attacks.
:{{Text|say|Garixxia|I will rend your flesh and dine on your entrails!}}

Kill her.
:{{Text|say|Garixxia|Avenge me my children! Avenge me...}}

==Progression==
{{Shaman artifact and class hall}}
