==Objectives==
[[Waltor of Pal'ea]] at the [[Coast of Echoes]] in the [[Borean Tundra]] wants you to use the Tuskarr Torch to burn the [[Kvaldir]] ships at [[Pal'ea]] and [[Garrosh's Landing]]. You must destroy the following ships: The Serpent's Maw, The Kur Drakkar, Bor's Hammer and Bor's Anvil. 
* [[The Serpent's Maw]] destroyed
* [[The Kur Drakkar]] destroyed
* [[Bor's Hammer]] destroyed
* [[Bor's Anvil]] destroyed
*[[Tuskarr Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Tuskarr]] magic is similar to what your people call shamanism. While we serve the elements differently than you, the power that we are able to call forth is formidable.

<Waltor waves a torch-like baton in front of you.>

With this [[Tuskarr Torch|tuskarr torch]] I want you to return to the mist and strike at the Kvaldir vessels. You will find three of their vessels docked behind the mist at Garrosh's Landing, north of here, and one docked off the shores of Pal'ea, to the south. Burn their ships in effigy! For all to see!

==Rewards==	
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Seafarer Boots|Seaspeaker Legguards|Talisman of the Tundra|Seabone Heaume}}

You will also receive:
* 20100 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[The Kalu'ak]]

==Progress==
Is it done? Are the ships ablaze?

==Completion==
A show of resistance to the [[Kvaldir]] savages might be what is needed to save my people at the other encampments. Perhaps the [[Kvaldir]] will rethink their actions should they believe that retribution will come.
