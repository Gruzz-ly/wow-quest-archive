==Objectives==
[[Endorah]] wants you to go to [[Amber Ledge]] north of [[Warsong Hold]] and thank those there for rescuing her.

==Description==
I told them all that I remember. Why don't they believe me?

I was gathering herbs by the rift. They came from nowhere, dark wizards with magical beasts - I was surrounded!

A magical box appeared above me, opened up and pulled me inside. Just as it began to close around me, my rescuers swooped in on the backs of red drakes. It was breathtaking!

I never thanked them for saving me. Please, <class>, find them, and pass on my gratitude.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|2|40}}

==Completion==
You can tell your friend that her rescue was our pleasure, as well as our duty.

Her encounter was but a small piece in what I believe to be a large puzzle.

[[Dalaran]] is sparing no effort in solving this mystery and to be honest, we could use a little assistance...
