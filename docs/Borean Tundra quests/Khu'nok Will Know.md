==Objectives==
Take the Orphaned Mammoth Calf to [[Khu'nok the Behemoth]] in the [[Borean Tundra]].
*[[Orphaned Mammoth Calf]] Delivered to Khu'nok

==Description==
Although you have acted valiantly in freeing the trapped calves, many of them will still die. You see, without a caretaker, these calves must fend for themselves in the wild.

But there is a way! Hope yet remains!

North of here in the mammoth fields, bordering the [[Scalding Pools]], you will find Khu'nok the Behemoth: a [[mammoth]] as wise as he is ancient. Take this mammoth orphan and present it to Khu'nok. He will know what to do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,050 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
<Khu'nok looks upon you with intelligence unusual for a beast.>

==Completion==
<You hear a voice in your head. It is Khu'nok.>

Your name has been heard in the whistling winds, <name>. You have done a great thing for my kin. For this we will consider you an ally. Alas, our torment cannot end without bloodshed and violence.

The price of peace for the mammoths will be the death of [[Kaw the Mammoth Destroyer|Kaw]]...
