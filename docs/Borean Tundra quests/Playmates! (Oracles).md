==Objectives==

*Roo taken to visit Winterfin Retreat
*Speak to your Oracle Orphan. Use your Oracle Orphan Whistle if your orphan is not nearby.

==Description==
Orphanage gets real lonely, you know? Sometimes we want to go places, meet new friends.

Maybe you can take us somewheres with other hatchlings? We heard about a place called Winterfin Retreat, in the big [[Borean Tundra]]. We think it's way in the northwest, near the edge of the [[Coldarra|Coldarra-island]].

The [[Orphan Matron Aria|orphan lady]] say [[Oh Noes, the Tadpoles!|someone brave save]] a bunch of [[Winterfin Tadpole|hatchlings]] there. We think they lonely, too. We think they need friends. You take us there?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You take us to Winterfin Retreat? Meet new friends maybe?

==Completion==
That was fun! We go again sometime? We can't wait to see our new friend again!

==Notes==
Fly down to the Winterfin Retreat. Land somewhere near [[King Mrgl-Mrgl]] and summon Roo if he's not already out. Then watch the script event:
