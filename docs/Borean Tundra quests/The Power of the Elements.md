==Objectives==
[[Dorain Frosthoof]] at [[Taunka'le Village]] wants you to use the Windsoul Totem to gather the energy of 10 [[Steam Rager]]s.
* Energy Collected (10)
* [[Windsoul Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
I kept trying to tell that silly goblin his machines are unreliable.

But the power of the elements; that is deep and abiding. When my apprenticeship is over, I will wield their full power. What I know now should be sufficient to help out our friend Fezzix, though.

Take this windsoul totem and plant it near any of the steam ragers to the west of the village. The totem will gather up the energies of slain elementals. Return the fully charged totem to me and I'll do the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|g=4|s=70|}}
*20,100 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|g=2|s=40|}}compensation at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Taunka]]

==Progress==
Have you charged the totem?

==Completion==
<Dorain nods.>

Good. This should be sufficient to show Fezzix exactly what I've been trying to tell him.

==Notes==
[[Load 'er Up!|Load 'er Up!]] is a prerequisite. [[Steam Rager]]s can be found in [[Steam Springs]].

==Patch changes==
