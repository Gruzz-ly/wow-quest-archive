==Objectives==
[[Raelorasz]] at the [[Transitus Shield]] wants you to get the Azure Codex from [[Inquisitor Caleras]] and collect 3 Shimmering Runes from his [[Coldarra Spellbinder]]s.
* [[Shimmering Rune]] (3)
* [[Azure Codex]]

==Description==
I sense a distinct peculiarity in the drakes here but the meaning of the runes that cover their bodies still eludes me.

Without a codex, it will take more time than we can afford for me to interpret them.

Not far from here is a [[Kirin Tor]] traitor, Caleras, who is likely to have a copy of the tome I require. His underlings hold the runes I will need for my translation.

Hurry, mortal. [[Malygos]] gains strength with every passing moment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|4|70}}
* +325 [[reputation]] with [[Wyrmrest Accord]]
* 20,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hurry, mortal.

Malygos gains strength with every passing moment.

==Completion==
You have done well, <race>.

Let us hope for a clue that we can use against Malygos.

==Notes==
While killing spellbinders, a [[Scintillating Fragment]] should drop, which is required to continue the quest chain.
