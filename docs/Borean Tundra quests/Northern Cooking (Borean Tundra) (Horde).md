==Description==
The warriors of the [[Warsong Offensive]] need food in their bellies to keep their strength up. If you could bring some chilled meats from the [[Rhino]]s or other beasts, I could make them some stew. I would be willing to teach you the recipe if you were willing.

You will learn: [[Northern Stew]]

You will also receive: {{cost|2|10}}

==Progress==
When the meat is present, the stew will be prepared.

==Completion==
I give my thanks to you.

==Notes==
A version of this quest is available from the cooking trainer at any of the four starting quest hubs in Northrend, but it has a pre-requisite of Cooking 350.
