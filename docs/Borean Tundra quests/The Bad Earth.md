==Objectives==
Bring 8 clods of Scourged Earth to [[Chieftain Wintergale]] at [[Taunka'le Village]].
*[[Scourged Earth]] (8)

==Description==
By curing the hides with the blighted earth outside the Temple City, Sage Aeire believes she can create a cloak which will cause most of the Scourge minions to ignore your presence. You should blend right in, she says.

She'd best be correct. It's our only chance to gather information and plan our counterattack.

You should be able to find the earth she needs poking in the areas to the south and west of the fortress. Bring it to me when you've finished gathering it. 

==Progress==
Do you have the earth Sage Aeire needs to complete the cloak?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

==Completion==
<Chieftain Wintergale gingerly accepts the clods of soil you gathered.>

We should get these into Sage Aeire's hands as soon as possible.

<The chieftain grunts, pretending not to be disturbed by the tainted dirt.>

We can never know when the Scourge commander will launch the final assault on the village.
