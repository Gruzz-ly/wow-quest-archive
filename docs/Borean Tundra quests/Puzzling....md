==Objectives==
Bring the Scintillating Fragment to [[Raelorasz]] at the [[Transitus Shield]].
* [[Scintillating Fragment]] (provided)

==Description==
Something about this scrap of metal prevents you from casting it aside.

Perhaps [[Raelorasz]] might be able to shed some light on its purpose.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|4|70}}
* 20,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Wyrmrest Accord]]

==Progress==
What have you found, <class>?

==Completion==
It was wise of you to bring this to me, <name>.

<Raelorasz eyes the fragment and slowly nods.>

If you truly desire to contribute to our efforts, no matter the risk, I shall share with you its meaning.

==Progression==
This chain continues the theme started in [[Basic Training]].
