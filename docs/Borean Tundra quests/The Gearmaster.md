'''The Gearmaster''' is the [[mini-boss]] conclusion of the [[Distress Call|Distress Call]] quest chain.

==Objectives==
Research the Gearmaster's Manual and return Mechazod's Head to [[Fizzcrank Fullthrottle]].
* The Gearmaster's Manual researched
* [[Mechazod's Head]]

==Description==
[[Gearmaster Mechazod]] is insane! He says that he offers us immortality by removing this so-called 'Curse of the Flesh', but what he's really making are robotic slaves!

<name>, we're pretty certain that he's still at the pumping station out in the middle of the pools to the east.

The last we saw of him, he was in the command hut up top. Go up there and research his stuff.

You must confront Mechazod if [[gnome]]s everywhere,... no, everyone everywhere, are to stay alive!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Mender's Cover|Regenerative Hide Harness|Chilled Mail Boots|Icy Ripper Ring}}
You will also receive: {{cost|10}}

==Progress==
[[Jinky Wingnut|Jinky]] told me to expect you. Is it done?

==Completion==
<The old gnome breathes a heavy sigh of relief.>

It is done then... you have saved us! If you hadn't stopped him here, then who knows how far his madness would have spread?

With the threats from the [[blue dragonflight|blue dragons]] and the [[Nexus War]], not to mention the [[Lich King]], the last thing we need is a mad creation of the [[Titan]]s running loose!

Thank you, <name>!

==Notes==
Inspect the book on the table.

:{{text|say|Gearmaster Mechazod says: Very well. It saddens me that it has come to this. I look upon all of you if you were my children. I will slay you if I must!}}
