==Objectives==
[[Raelorasz]] at the [[Transitus Shield]] wants you to kill [[Coldarra Wyrmkin]] and use their [[Frozen Axe]] to break 5 blue dragon eggs.
* [[Blue Dragon Egg|Dragon Eggs]] Destroyed (5)

==Description==
Our goals here are simple. We are to remain hidden from [[Malygos]], observe his brood, and thwart his efforts wherever possible. To that end, I have a task for you.

The [[blue dragonflight|blues]] are laying their eggs at the base of the [[Nexus]]. Exposure to so much arcane energy will surely make them hatch sooner, and there's no telling what effect it will have on their spawn.

I don't intend to find out. Slay the local wyrmkin and use their frozen axes to break the eggs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|4|70}}
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Wyrmrest Accord]]
* 20,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you destroyed the blues' eggs, <class>?

==Completion==
It pains me to order the destruction of dragon eggs, enemy or no.

May the ends of this war justify the means....

==Progression==
