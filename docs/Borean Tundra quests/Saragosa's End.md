==Objectives==
[[Keristrasza]] wants you to use the Arcane Power Focus to lure [[Saragosa]], and then defeat her.
* [[Saragosa's Corpse]]
* [[Arcane Power Focus]] (provided)

==Description==
Using the mana crystals you provided, I have created this Power Focus.

Saragosa is a glutton. She will be unable to resist its lure. Inside it lie magics that will greatly diminish her power. Let us hope she does not see through my ruse....

Prepare yourself, <name>, and speak to me again when you are ready to face Saragosa. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Flame Hardened Waistband|Flame Hardened Wristbindings|Cauterizing Chain Leggings|Fury of the Crimson Drake}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
Saragosa must not be allowed to live!

==Completion==
The world is a better place now that Saragosa is no more, but our work is not yet finished.

The time has come to strike at Malygos himself!

==Notes==
Talk to Keristrasza ({{gossip|''I am prepared to face Saragosa!''}}) to have her port you up to [[Saragosa's Landing]] where you must use the [[Arcane Power Focus]] to summon Saragosa.
