==Objectives==
Fly with your squadron to [[Storm Peaks]].
* Jump in the [[First Squadron Prototype]]
* Reach the signal point

==Description==
It looks like the signal is being transmitted from [[Storm Peaks]].

Time to put these [[flying machine]]s to work! I'll keep tracking the signal en route in order to get a cleaner read.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Need something, Commander?

==Completion==
I've set up a cloaking device that will cover our current location. We should be safe for now.

==Notes==
[[File:A Signal in Storm Peaks - cloaking field.jpg|thumb|Winklespring's cloaking field]]
Interact with one of the First Squadron Prototype to enter it. The machines automatically lift off and head toward the northeast. [[Herk Winklespring|Winklespring]] pilots one of the prototypes while [[Fizzi Tinkerbow]] handles the other, with the player character and [[Emaedi Autoblast]] as respective passengers.

:{{Text|say|Cog Captain Winklespring|[[Telzo Sparkspanner|Sparkspanner]] always was an odd one... Can't imagine what he has planned.}}
:''Suddenly, Sparkspanner's voice is heard.''
:{{Text|say|Telzo Sparkspanner|Imagine no longer, simpleton! I am more than willing to tell you how you and your little crew will meet your demise.}}
:{{Text|say|Cog Captain Winklespring|Sparkspanner! So you did survive [[Gnomeregan]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Telzo Sparkspanner|Did you really think that I, the great [[Sicco Thermaplugg|Thermaplugg]]'s second-in-command, would die in a scheme I helped engineer?}}
:{{Text|say|Cog Captain Winklespring|You WHAT? What could you possibly have hoped to accomplish?}}
:{{Text|say|Telzo Sparkspanner|Recognition! And what did we get? A fool of a [[gnome]] sweeping in and reaping the rewards of all our work.}}
:{{Text|say|Telzo Sparkspanner|All those who followed [[Gelbin Mekkatorque|Mekkatorque]] must pay! With my [[Ironbound|army of troggs]], I will decimate all of gnomanity.}}

You don't have to actually watch the entire journey to Storm Peaks: shortly after the flying machines enter [[Dragonblight]]'s [[Coldwind Pass]], a loading screen appears and the planes arrive at the southern end of the [[Foot Steppes]].
:{{Text|say|Fizzi Tinkerbow|Commander! The signal tracker is going haywire! I'll need some time to recalibrate it.}}
:{{Text|say|Cog Captain Winklespring|Find a safe spot to land! We'll cover you while you adjust the device.}}

The planes circle around the [[Engine of the Makers]] before landing on a collapsed bridge segment near the southwestern corner of the steppes. Here Winklespring has set up a [[Gnomish Cloaking Device (Storm Peaks)|Gnomish Cloaking Device]], creating a cloaking field for the members of G.E.A.R., the First Squadron Prototypes, and a [[Shrinkified Assault Tank]]. Talk to Winklespring to turn in.
