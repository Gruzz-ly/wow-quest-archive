==Objectives==
Test out Crafty's Ultra-Advanced Proto-Typical Shortening Blaster on 5 [[Magmoth Crusher]]s or [[Mate of Magmothregar|Mates of Magmothregar]]. After you have done so, return to [[Crafty Wobblesprocket|her]] at [[Fizzcrank Airstrip]].
* Crafty's Blaster Tested (5)
*[[Crafty's Ultra-Advanced Proto-Typical Shortening Blaster]] (provided)

==Description==
That'll do her, chief! So, here's what I want ya to do....

Take my blaster and head north to [[Magmoth]]. If we're gonna have a chance at all against those monsters, we need to cut them down to size... so to speak.

In order to gauge its effectiveness, I need you to slay the magnataur while the blaster's effects are still on it. Any of the crushers or mates will do, but don't bother with the offspring... they're too small to worry about. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Wizzlenob Shoulder Covers|Reinforced Elastic Band|Ring-Ridden Wrist Protectors|Thin Dexterity Enhancing Tube}}

==Progress==
You sure that you tested the blaster on enough of those monstrous beasts?

==Completion==
Whadya mean it didn't work?!

But... but...

<Crafty begins to sob.>

Okay, we can deal with this. I'm a big girl. Time to think outside the box!
