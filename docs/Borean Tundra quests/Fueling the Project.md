==Objectives==
[[Abner Fizzletorque]] at [[Fizzcrank Airstrip]] wants you to collect 8 Barrels of Oil using the Portable Oil Collector.
*[[Oil Pool|Barrels of Oil]] Collected (8)
*[[Portable Oil Collector]] (Provided)

==Description==
I plan to build a machine that will collapse the tunnels the [[Scourge]] is using to deploy their [[Nerubian]]s, but with the main drilling rig out of order, we'll have to collect the fuel for the device some other way.

Out in the [[Geyser Fields]] to the southeast, small pools of oil bubble up away from the [[Fizzcrank Pumping Station|main rig]]. If you can collect enough of the oil from those pools, I can make a crude fuel to power the machine.

Simply deploy the collector near the rig, and it will pump and store the oil in its tank.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|70}}
*20100 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
Do you have that fuel?

==Completion==
<Abner sets about draining the fuel tank of the collector.>

Distilling this by hand is going to be messy, but I'll have it taken care of soon. In the meantime, we'll need one more material to complete the machine.

==Progression==
