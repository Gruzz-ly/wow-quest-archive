== Objectives ==
Accompany [[Kalecgos]] to [[Coldarra]].

Speak to him when you are ready.
* Accompanied Kalecgos to Coldarra.

== Description ==
Now, back to the matter at hand...

I am convinced that the vision in the [[Nexus]] is one of [[Deathwing]]'s illusions designed to bring conflict into our flight at a very fragile time.

The Worldbreaker would only be strengthened were we to fall to infighting.

Still, a gnawing sense of unease tempts me to take a path of caution.

It would be wise for me to take [[Tarecgosa]] and withdraw until the time of choosing.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|25|94}}

== Completion ==
She is dying, <name>.

I have... failed her.

==Notes==
''Speak to Kalecgos.''

{{gossip|''I am prepared to accompany you, Kalecgos.''}}

''A cutscene begins. Kalecgos flies the player to Coldarra, and lands.''

{{text|yell|Kalecgos|Tarecgosa!}}

''Suddenly, several twilight portals open, surrounding Kalecgos and the player.''

{{text|say|Kalecgos|What is the meaning of this?}}

''Several Twilight dragonspawn emerge from the portal.''

{{text|say|Kalecgos|Argh! Deathwing's vermin!}}

''The twilight dragons ensnare Kalecgos, preventing him from retreating. The commander of the Twilight dragons begins channeling a powerful spell.''

{{text|say|Twilight Commander|[[Arygos|A new aspect of magic]] has already been selected. There is no place for you, Kalecgos. You are... DISMISSED!!}}

''The camera pans to reveal Tarecgosa soaring to the rescue.''

{{text|yell|Tarecgosa|YOU SHALL NOT HAVE HIM!!}}

''Tarecgosa intercepts the blast, killing the commander, but sacrificing herself in the process. The other twilight dragons flee, releasing Kalecgos.''

{{text|yell|Kalecgos|Nooooooo!!}}
