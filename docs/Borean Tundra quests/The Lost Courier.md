==Objectives==
Speak to Courier Lanson at [[Stars' Rest|Star's Rest]].

==Description==
We're lucky we made it this far, <name>. We were ambushed by Scourge as soon as we landed.

One of our men turned out to be a spy for the [[Cult of the Damned]]. [[Thassarian]] appears to have more evidence of cultist infiltration. Apparently it goes all the way to the top.

I've sent one of my best couriers to our outpost in western Dragonblight, but he has not yet returned. I fear he may have fallen to the Scourge. Will you go to Dragonblight and search for him? Courier Lanson is his name.

==Completion==
As I crossed the bridge into Dragonblight a small group of Anub'ar ambushed me! I was surrounded! Those monsters knew I was coming. I barely made it out of there with my flesh intact. This list I hold must be taken to Wintergarde Keep, but I am too badly injured to make the journey.
