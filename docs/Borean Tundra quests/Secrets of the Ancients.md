==Objectives==
[[Archmage Berinand]] in the [[Transitus Shield]] wants you to collect 3 Glacial Splinters and 3 Magic-Bound Splinters from the [[Ancient]]s in [[Coldarra]].
* [[Glacial Splinter]] (3)
* [[Magic-Bound Splinter]] (3)

==Description==
It's become clear that the instability in the region has had an effect on its indigenous creatures.

I've taken a particular interest in the [[Glacial Ancient]]s and their recent adaptations. I suspect that their transformation into these [[Magic-bound Ancient|'Magic-bound' Ancients]] may hold clues to our predicament here.

For my studies, I'll need samples from both. Do hurry...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|4|70}}
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor]]
* 20,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you collected the samples I requested?

==Completion==
Yes, yes. These shall do nicely.

Thank you, <race>.
