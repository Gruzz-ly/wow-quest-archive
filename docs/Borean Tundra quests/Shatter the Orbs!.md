==Objectives==
Destroy 5 Blood Globes and report to [[Snow Tracker Junek]] at [[Taunka'le Village]].
*[[En'kilah Blood Globe|Blood Globes]] Shattered (5)

==Description==
They're... bleeding the prisoners... putting the blood... in those globes.

<Grumm's eyes close momentarily and he leans his head back.>

The blood... taken up to necropolis... to feed blood prince...

<Grumm gasps for breath.>

P-promise... you'll... destroy blood... globes... bring word... to Junek.

<The snow tracker collapses into unconsciousness.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|86}}
*20,300 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Taunka]]

==Completion==
I feared they might've captured Grumm, but I never thought they'd do such horrific things to him. I've never seen a warrior survive a losing battle with the Scourge.

Thank you for bringing word of his fate, <name>. He was a mighty warrior and we will remember him as such.
