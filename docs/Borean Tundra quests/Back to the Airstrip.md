==Objectives==
Speak with [[Fizzcrank Fullthrottle]] at [[Fizzcrank Airstrip]].

==Description==
Okay, I think I'm going to start making my way back to the airstrip, too. Of course, I'm moving a little slower with this leg injury.

Say, do you think you could get there ahead of me and pass on the good news to Ol' Fizzcrank? I bet anything that there'll be a reward in it for you.

Thanks, <name>!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards
|Amberplate Headguard
|Reinforced Caribou-Hide Boots
|Spiked Magmoth Chestpiece
|Shivering Healer's Ring
|Hypergizmatic Energy Booster}}
You will also gain:
* {{cost|9|40}}
* 25150 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Completion==
That's quite a tale, <name>. With all of the problems out here, it's a wonder that the airstrip hasn't been wiped out already.

But thanks to you, there's one less adversary to worry about.

I put aside some special things for just such an occasion as this. Why don't you take your pick?
