== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Annihilator Grek'lor]] at the [[Coast of Echoes]]. 

== Description ==
Thanks for all your help, buddy. You can let Grek'lor know the tanks are ready for action. Hopefully you can clean up this place once and for all! 

== Completion ==
With the current state of our transports and shipping lanes, we haven't been able to get a damned siege engine to [[Warsong Hold|Warsong]]. These tanks are all that we have left from the original expedition. Now that they're operational, you're gonna use 'em to stomp the [[Scourge]] offensive at the [[Plains of Nasam]].

==Progression==
{{:The Defense of Warsong Hold}}
