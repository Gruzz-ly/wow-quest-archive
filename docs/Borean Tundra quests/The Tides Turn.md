==Objectives==
[[Elder Muahit]] wants you to kill [[Heigarr the Horrible]] in [[Njord's Breath Bay]].
*[[Heigarr the Horrible]] slain

==Description==
The spirits have heard our cry for help, <name>. It's a sign that [[Kaskala]] might yet be saved.

Take advantage of the confusion the weather has created and slay the [[Kvaldir]] leader, [[Heigarr the Slayer]]. Your actions will sway the battle in our favor. I am sure of it.

==Completion==
You've done us a great favor, <race>. The fight is not yet won, but now my people have a chance.

==Notes==
Heigarr's on the other side of the moai statue.
