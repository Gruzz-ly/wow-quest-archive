==Objectives==
Collect 15 Fizzcrank Spare Parts and deliver them to [[Iron Eyes]] at [[Taunka'le Village]].
*[[Fizzcrank Spare Parts]] (15)

==Description==
<A single tear rolls down the face of Iron Eyes.>

I have heard that you are heading back into the pools to the west. I have something for you to do while you are out there, <race>.

The gnomes, who care nothing for the land, have polluted it with their machinery. I want you to pick up any spare parts that you come across.

Return them to me here. I will see to it that they are properly disposed of before we leave this place for good.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox|
|Mantle of Congealed Anger
|Reinforced Caribou-Hide Leggings
|Spiked Magmoth Helm
|Amberplate Grips
}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|70|}}
*20,100 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|2|40|}} at level 80)
*250 reputation with [[The Taunka]]

==Progress==
If we do not take care of the land, she will not suffer us to live for long.

==Completion==
It is the taunka way to leave the land pristine before we move on.

We will be traveling to our capital, Icemist, very soon. You have helped by allowing us to depart that much more quickly.

Thank you.
