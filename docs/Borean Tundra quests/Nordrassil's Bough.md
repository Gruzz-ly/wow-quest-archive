== Objectives ==
Collect the Branch of [[Nordrassil]] at [[Amber Ledge]] in [[Borean Tundra]].

== Description ==
Much has transpired since last we spoke.

I have taken it upon myself to visit the Nexus and recover [[Anachronos]]'s artifact, but not before using it for myself. Now I too have witnessed that which you have seen.

Before discussing the matter further, allow me to express my gratitude to you for your assistance, both here and in the [[Plane of Fire]].

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*[[Branch of Nordrassil]]
*{{cost|53||50}}

== Completion ==
Nordrassil's Bough is now joined with the Timeless Eye.

Even a battleworn hero such as yourself cannot help but be humbled by such a gift.

== Notes ==
Do NOT sell or disenchant the Branch of Nordassil. It is required for a later quest.
