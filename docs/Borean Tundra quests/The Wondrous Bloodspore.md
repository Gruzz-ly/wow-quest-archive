From this innocuous introduction to the [[Bloodspore Plains]], the [[Horde]] player becomes embroiled in a military gambit against the Gammothran magnataur.

==Objectives==
[[Bloodmage Laurith]] at the [[Bloodspore Plains]] in the [[Borean Tundra]] wants you to recover 10 Bloodspore Carpels.
* [[Bloodspore Carpel]] (10)

==Description==
We are witnessing something amazing here, <race>. A whole undiscovered ecology lives and breathes not more than a few paces from us! I surmise it is the bloodspore plant that sets this environment abuzz.

I have collected some pollen from the nearby male species of bloodspore plant but still lack female receptors for pollination. Fetch me a bushel of the bloodspore carpels. You'll find them near the larger plants surrounding us.

Be wary of their guardians! The [[kobold]]s won't give them up easily!

==Progress==
The tests must continue!

==Completion==
Lovely! Just lovely!

<Laurith applies a sprinkling of pollen to one of the bloodspore carpels and then utters an incantation.>

Hrmph... I don't understand. Unless... Why of course!
