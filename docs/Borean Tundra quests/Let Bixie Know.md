==Objectives==
Speak with [[Bixie Wrenchshanker]] just south of [[The Dens of Dying]].

==Description==
My [[Tinky Wickwhistle (Icecrown)|evil twin's]] out there somewhere now.

I'm pretty sure that she's not back at the [[Fizzcrank Airstrip|airstrip]]. In fact, wherever she ended up, it's colder there than here. But I could only 'feel' her for a moment.

Oh well, I'll reconfigure this thing and port myself back to the airstrip soon enough. In the meantime, do you think you could go east and let Bixie know that I'll meet her back there?

Thanks, <name>!

==Completion==
Tinky's got an [[Evil Twin|evil twin]]?

Well, if she says she's okay, and that she'll be able to get herself back to the airstrip soon, that's good enough for me.
