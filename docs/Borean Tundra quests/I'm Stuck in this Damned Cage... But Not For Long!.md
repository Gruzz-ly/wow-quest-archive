==Objectives==
Collect an Engine-Core Crystal, a Magical Gyroscope, and a Piloting Scourgestone. Deliver them to [[Tinky Wickwhistle]] at [[Talramas]].
*[[Engine-Core Crystal]]
*[[Magical Gyroscope]]
*[[Piloting Scourgestone]]

==Description==
The [[Cult of the Damned|cultists]] magicked me into this cage and there's no door to it. Little did they know that I'm the chief transmatter engineer for the airstrip!

With your help, and a little elbow-grease, I won't be in here for long.

I'm going to need an engine-core crystal from one of the [[ghoul]]s in here, a magical gyroscope from their [[Doctor Razorgrin|doctor]], and a piloting scourgestone from the [[Lich-Lord Chillwinter|lich-lord]] up top.

With all of that stuff, I should be able to make a port device to get back to [[Fizzcrank Airstrip|Fizzcrank's]] and escape the [[gnome]] way!

==Progress==
You got all of that stuff?

==Completion==
Outstanding! Now just a little modification here, and a tweak there....

==Notes==
The [[Magical Gyroscope]] drops from [[Doctor Razorgrin]], the [[Piloting Scourgestone]] from [[Lich-Lord Chillwinter]] and the [[Engine-Core Crystal]] from any [[Festering Ghoul]]
