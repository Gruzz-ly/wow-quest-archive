==Objectives==
Return [[King Mrgl-Mrgl]]'s Spare Suit to him at [[Winterfin Retreat]].
* [[King Mrgl-Mrgl's Spare Suit (1)]] (provided)

==Description==
Very well, your king's secret is safe with me as long as he continues to help us against our enemies.

Here, take this to him. I cleaned it up nicely, though I have no idea why he needs a second disguise.

Maybe he has something in mind for you? 

==Progress==
Do you have my spare suit, <name>?

==Completion==
<Upon seeing the spare murloc suit, the king rubs his costumed appendages together.>

Nicely done. Now, back to the pressing matter at hand. I've got something of great importance for you to do.
