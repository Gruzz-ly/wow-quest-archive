==Objectives==
Look for [[Veehja]] at the [[Shrine of Scales]] on [[Riplash Strand]].

==Description==
There is someone who might shed light on this mystery, <race>. It is rumored that the [[Kvaldir]] have kept a [[naga]] priestess alive at the temple on the west side of the shore.

She will no doubt have great reason to resent her uninvited Kvaldir guests. Perhaps my father is expecting her to cooperate with you in some way.

==Completion==
Hsssssssssssss! Have you come to mock me, <race>?
