'''A Mission Statement''' starts the [[D.E.H.T.A]] questline. Completing it opens up a variety of quests at the [[D.E.H.T.A. Encampment]].

==Completion==
The demon has many names and each name has held special meaning at one time or another. While the details were sometimes insignificant, the end result was always the same: death.

But it is now, nearly fifty years after it all began, that the details will find the devil and lead to his downfall.

This time, we have him... There will be no escape for [[Hemet Nesingwary|Nesingwary]].

[[Northrend]] will be the battleground for our war. The hunter will become the hunted!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*180 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with the [[Cenarion Expedition]]
