==Objectives==
[[Imperean]] wants you to beat [[Simmer]] and [[Churn]] into submission. Return to her at the [[Ruins of Eldra'nath]] when they have submitted.
*[[Simmer]] has submitted
*[[Churn]] has submitted

==Description==
Ah, it is information that you crave: the whereabouts and condition of your 'farseer'. He did not see so far as to avoid the trouble which befell him.

Nevertheless, I will give you the means to acquire the knowledge. But first, you will do some things for me.

No doubt you have seen the war between fire and water to the south. Simmer keeps boiling Churn's pool, and the two have been battling for ages.

Go to the [[Charred Rise]] and [[Blistering Pool]], and convince each of them to stop their bickering.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
You still have yet to beat some sense into those two.

==Completion==
I am pleased, though no doubt they will still continue to quarrel a bit longer.

However, there is something else that you will need to accomplish before you can return to your spirit talker.

==Progression==
{{The Sky Will Know}}
