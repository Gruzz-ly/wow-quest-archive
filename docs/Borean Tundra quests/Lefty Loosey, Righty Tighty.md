'''Lefty Loosey, Righty Tighty''' is an assassination mission in the Distress Call quest chain.

==Objectives==
Dismantle Twonky, ED-210, Max Blasto, and The Grinder, and then report back to [[Jinky Wingnut]] at [[Fizzcrank Airstrip]].
* [[Twonky]] slain
* [[ED-210]] slain
* [[Max Blasto]] slain
* [[The Grinder]] slain

==Description==
Okay, I think we're ready for the penultimate assault... before you can bring down [[Gearmaster Mechazod|Mechazod]], you're going to have to dismantle his lieutenants first!

You'll find Twonky, ED-210, Max Blasto, and The Grinder at the [[West Point Station|West Point]], [[North Point Station|North Point]], [[Mid Point Station|Mid Point]] and [[South Point Station|South Point stations]], respectively.

To get them to show up, just turn the valves at the stations to mess up whatever their trying to do out there. You can't miss the places, they all have spinning lights.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}}

==Progress==
Are Gearmaster Mechazod's lieutenants dealt with?

==Completion==
Wow, you survived!

I guess all that's left to do now is deal with Gearmaster Mechazod.

==Notes==
The title of this quest, "Lefty Loosey, Righty Tighty", is a mnemonic from real-world mechanics training.  When the saying is put into practice (staring straight-on at the head of a primed bolt), one sees that tightening results from clockwise rotation, and loosening occurs from a counterclockwise rotation.
