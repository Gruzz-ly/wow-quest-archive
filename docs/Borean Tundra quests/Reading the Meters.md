==Objectives==
[[Archmage Berinand]] at the [[Transitus Shield]] has asked you to collect the readings from his instruments in Coldarra.
* Nexus Geological Reading
* Southern Coldarra Reading
* Northern Coldarra Reading
* Western Coldarra Reading

==Description==
I had hoped that the [[Nexus]]' impact was limited to this region. Recently though, reports have flooded in from all over [[Azeroth]] suggesting that geologic instability is growing exponentially!

I need the Nexus monitored regularly as I work to develop a solution.

I've placed sensitive instruments around [[Coldarra]], disguised as [[Malygos]]' scrying orbs. One lies in the trench near the Nexus, and three are hidden in the structures around the valley's perimeter. Visit each and return to me with their readings. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
Have you read all of my instruments, <class>?

==Completion==
This is worse than I expected.

Malygos is channeling too much power to this place. If he's not stop, [[Azeroth]] will be the next [[Outland]]! Fortunately, I believe that I've engineered a temporary solution....

==Notes==
There are 3 structures around the perimiter of the Coldarra area (a 'caldera').  Just inside the ground level entrance of each lies one of the orbs.  The Nexus orb is a little way counterclockwise from the Nexus [[Meeting Stone]].
