==Objectives==
Speak with [[Spirit Talker Snarlfang]] at [[Bor'gorok Outpost]].

==Description==
Did you feel it?

<[[Sauranok the Mystic|Sauranok]] momentarily clutches his chest in confusion. His hand comes away trailing red-hot steam.>

Something terrible has happened to my old friend, [[Farseer Grimwalker]]. I just sensed it.

He had a pupil that he took with him when he went north. They were going to help the overlord establish an outpost on the edge of [[Sholazar Basin]].

Her name is Snarlfang. She is a spirit talker.

Perhaps she will know what happened. Or, at least, she can help you to find out.

==Completion==
The mystic knows? You say he felt that something horrible happened to Farseer Grimwalker?

It is as I feared!
