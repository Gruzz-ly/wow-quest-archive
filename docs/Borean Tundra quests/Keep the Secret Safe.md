==Objectives==
[[Librarian Serrah]] in the [[Transitus Shield]] needs you to kill [[Arcane Serpent]]s near the [[Nexus]] and collect 5 Nexus Mana Essences from them.
* [[Nexus Mana Essence]] (5)

==Description==
Our existence here depends entirely upon staying hidden. Should the shield fail, even for a moment, [[Malygos]]' minions would have us.

One of my responsibilities is to rejuvenate the warmages' mana levels so their focus doesn't falter. With our supply lines lost, I've been forced to improvise.

I could use your help, <name>.

Very near the Nexus, Arcane Serpents feast on the abundant magical energies. Once defeated, they will yield a mana essence that I can make use of.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Cauterizing Chain Strand|Seared Scale Cape|Gauntlets of the Crimson Guardian|Serrah's Star}}

You will also gain:
* {{cost|4|70}}
* +250 reputation with [[Kirin Tor]]
* 20,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the mana essences I asked for?

==Completion==
Your service to [[Dalaran]] will not go unnoticed, <race>.

I hope you find this payment sufficient.
