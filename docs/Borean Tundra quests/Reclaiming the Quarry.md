==Objectives==
[[Etaruk]], camped near the entrance to the [[Coldrock Quarry]], wants you to kill 12 Beryl Treasure Hunters.
* [[Beryl Treasure Hunter]] slain (12)

==Description==
You're a welcome sight, <class>. My name is Etaruk, and I used to be a craftsman here at the Coldrock Quarry.

My companions and I were preparing a new set of statues for their last set of rites when we saw those mysterious blue platforms come flying over the plateau.

When they landed, the mage hunters they carried swarmed the quarry, murdering my fellows and plundering the quarry. If we don't stop them, they'll destroy our statues and make off with our artifacts. Will you help me defeat the invaders? 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
Have you started ridding the quarry of our enemies?

==Completion==
Now that these strange mages know that the people of [[Kaskala]] and their allies will not give up the quarry so easily, we must maintain our efforts and defeat them completely.

My brothers in Kaskala have also come under attack and will not be able to support us, but with your help, <name>, we can overcome these pillagers.
