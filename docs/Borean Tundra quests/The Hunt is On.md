== Objectives ==
[[Vindicator Yaala]] wants you to use the Oculus of the Exorcist in three different locations in [[Valiance Keep]] to uncover and defeat [[Cult of the Damned]] members.
*[[Tom Hegger|Cultist in docks]] defeated
*[[Guard Mitchells|Cultist in jail]] defeated
*[["Salty" John Thorpe|Cultist in kitchen]] defeated
*[[Oculus of the Exorcist]] (provided)

== Description ==
I've made it my business to learn as much as possible about the vile death cult, including their secret language.

[[Harbinger Vurenn|Vurenn]] was right. The cultists mention disguised operatives in various locations in Valiance Keep: the lower docks, the jail inside the inner hold and in the inn's kitchen.

Take this oculus. Use it at those three locations - anyone that has recently used the cult's necromancy will be enshrouded by a dark aura. Take care of the cultists before something nefarious happens.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Transborean Leggings
|Marshwalker Pauldrons
|Tundrastrider Ringmail
|Mightstone Helm
}}

You will also receive:
*1,400 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with the [[Valiance Expedition]]

== Progress ==
Have you accomplished the task I asked of you, <name>?

== Completion ==
You've done well, <name>.  However, I can't shake the feeling that this is not the last we've seen of these death cultists.

Darkness has a way of hiding even in plain sight.

== Notes ==
Completing this quest will fulfill the "Hiding in Plain Sight" requirement of [[Nothing Boring About Borean]].
