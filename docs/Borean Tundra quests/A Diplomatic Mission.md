==Objectives==
Speak to [[Karuk]] at [[Riplash Strand]], southwest of [[Valiance Keep]].

==Description==
I see that you are very eager to help, <name>. You didn't come all the way to [[Northrend]] to stay holed up in a city! I've just the task for you... something that will take you far away from here.

We've long sought to gain the favor of the [[tuskarr]] native to Northrend. Recently a young tuskarr came to us seeking help, something we couldn't offer at the time.

Now that you're around, maybe you can lend him a hand. Look for Karuk near the Riplash Strand, southwest of here, and see what you can do to help.

==Completion==
You've come to my aid? I thank you, <name>.
