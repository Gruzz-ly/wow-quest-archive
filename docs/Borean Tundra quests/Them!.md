==Objectives==
[[Brglmurgl]] at [[Winterfin Retreat]] has asked you to kill 15 Winterfin [[murloc]]s. Any combination of warriors, oracles, and shorestrikers will do.
* Winterfin murlocs slain (15)

==Description==
Our brothers and sisters across the water are now our mortal enemies. They have kidnapped our tadpoles, driven us out of our village, and killed more of us than I can count.

Prove yourself, <race>! Swim across the rift and slay them!

Despite the favor that the new king has shown you, only then will we consider accepting you here. Fail to do so, and you might as well leave now and never return! 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
If you have killed so many of the Winterfin betrayers, why is it that when I look out across the water, I still see too many of them?

==Completion==
I am pleased. I can smell the coppery tang of their blood on your hands.

This is a good start for you, <race>.
