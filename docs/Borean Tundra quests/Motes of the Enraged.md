==Objectives==
Obtain 5 Tempest Motes and deliver them to [[Imperean]] at the [[Ruins of Eldra'nath]].
*[[Tempest Mote]] (5)

==Description==
Now that their little squabble is dealt with, there is still the matter of helping you and your spirit talker.

As you can see, my vassals have been enraged by the ongoing war between fire and water. This will not change anytime soon, but it will serve to your advantage.

In order to assist you, what we need are their motes. Head further into the ruins and retrieve them from the tempests.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
Once you have the necessary motes, I will combine a portion of my essence with theirs. The result will get you what you need.

==Completion==
I regret the loss of those tempests, but my word is my bond... even to a mortal such as yourself.

Now, let us see if we can fashion something of use to you.
