==Objectives==
[[Bixie Wrenchshanker]], skulking just to the south of [[The Dens of Dying]], has asked you to use Bixie's Inhibiting Powder at a [[Den of Dying Plague Cauldron]] to neutralize it.
*Plague Cauldron Neutralized
*[[Bixie's Inhibiting Powder]] (provided)

==Description==
So, while you were out taking care of those plagued beasts, I took a peek inside the caves up there.

There are [[Cult of the Damned|cultists]] in there plaguing them!

They have some sort of noxious concoction brewing in a cauldron. I have a powder that I normally use as an anti-poison, and I mixed it up with some other stuff. I think it'll neutralize their brew!

Take it up to one of those caves and see if it works.

==Rewards==
You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Sweltering Handwraps]]
* [[Rhinohide Mask]]
* [[Plainhunter's Waistband]]
* [[Chilled Shoulderplates]]
You will also gain:
* {{cost|4|70}}
* 20,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
Time's wasting, <class>. The last thing we need is to have to face plagued [[magnataur]].

The normal ones are bad enough as it is!

==Completion==
I knew you had it in you. Now there's something else that I need to ask you to take care of.

==Progression==
