==Objectives==
[[Raelorasz]] wants you to use the Blood-tipped Spear to subdue a [[Nexus Drake Hatchling]] and return it to him at the [[Transitus Shield]].
* Captured Nexus Drake
* [[Raelorasz's Spear]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[blue dragonflight|blues]] have begun to cover their drakes in mysterious runes. I must discover their significance.

<Raelorasz pokes his hand with a spear and coats the tip with his blood.>

Take this and use it on one of them. Wait for it to become subdued, then bring it here to me before it expires.

Their hatchlings feed around the northwest edge of the valley.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Sweltering Robes|Charred Drakehide Belt|Flame-Infused Bindings|Helm of the Crimson Drakonid}}

You will also receive:
*  {{cost|4|70}}
* +325 [[reputation]] with [[Wyrmrest Accord]]
* 20,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you managed to capture one of the Nexus Drakes?

==Completion==
The fate of these young drakes need not burden your conscience, <race>. [[Malygos]] alone is accountable for this.

I am working ceaselessly to discover the secrets of these runes. We shall take no more lives than we must.

==Notes==
Look up, have a range indicator enabled for Raelorasz's spear as it has a rather long range. Keep the drake occupied but don't kill it in the 25 seconds it takes to subdue it.

On delivery:
