==Objectives==
[[Waltor of Pal'ea]] at the Coast of Echoes in the Borean Tundra wants you to use the Horn of the Ancient Mariner to summon [[Orabus the Helmsman]]. Once summoned, slay Orabus the Helmsman.
*[[Horn of the Ancient Mariner]] (provided)

==Description==
Take the horn and travel west to the Warsong Jetty. Make your way to the end of the jetty and blow into the horn. The sound should rouse Orabus.

Slay the foul beast and return to me!

==Progress==
Orabus must be destroyed!

==Completion==
It seems that the loss of their lieutenant has only stirred the nest. They are more angry and aggressive than before!

<Waltor sighs.>

You've done what you can here, friend. At the very least you deserve some form of compensation for thinning their numbers.
