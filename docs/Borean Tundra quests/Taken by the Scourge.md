== Objectives ==
[[Foreman Mortuus]] at [[Warsong Hold]] wants you to free 5 Warsong Peons.
*[[Warsong Peon (Borean Tundra)|Warsong Peon]] Freed (5)

== Description ==
<Mortuus sighs.>

[[Peon]]s... We may as well post up a sign offering the Nerub'ar a free meal.

See, the problem with a peon is that: (1) they're dumber than dirt; and (2) they're weaker than a [[leper gnome]]. Of course they're the first to be taken by the [[Scourge]]!

This puts me in a bit of a predicament, you see. Without peons, manual labor comes to a halt. No peons, no construction.

Find and release my peons, <race>. If they're alive, you'll find 'em spun up in webbing throughout [[Mightstone Quarry]]. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Weathered Worker Cloak
|Marshwalker Boots
|Westrift Handcovers
|Mightstone Legplates
}}

You will also receive:
*20100 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
No peons, no buildings. And no. we're not going to replace them with goblins. Too damned expensive...

== Completion ==
Most of them made it back. The ones smart enough to know that we're inside the gigantic metal and stone building, anyway...

Regardless, a job well done. I hear you sprung more than a couple peons loose.

Oh yes, you're the talk of the... um... fortress.
