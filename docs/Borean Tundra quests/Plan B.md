==Objectives==
Collect 10 Warsong Outfits and a Warsong Banner. Bring them back to [[Crafty Wobblesprocket]] at [[Fizzcrank Airstrip]].
* [[Warsong Outfit]] (10)
* [[Warsong Banner (objective)]]

==Description==
Okay, don't panic! The blaster might not've worked, but we still have options.

<Crafty snaps her fingers.>

We're going to divert attention away from the airstrip! To make this work, we'll need a few things first.

<Wobblesprocket looks you up and down appraisingly.>

[[Steeljaw's Caravan|Steeljaw's caravan]], just to the west, stupidly took a shortcut through a [[taunka]] graveyard and was destroyed by their risen spirits.

Head over there and get some outfits off of the dead [[orc]]s. Pick up one of their banners, too! 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
We'll need lots of their clothes if this is going to work. I'm no seamstress... we'll just have to find something to fit you!

And then I'll just add a touch of my engineer genius, and poof, you'll look the part you need to play.

==Completion==
Nice, but those clothes reek!

Personally, you'd never catch me dead in such rags. But we're going to have to sort through them and find some that fit your, um... figure.

==Notes==
The banner is at {{coords|49.6|26.7|Borean Tundra}}, just by [[Steeljaw's Corpse]] at the southern end of the caravan.

==Progression==
