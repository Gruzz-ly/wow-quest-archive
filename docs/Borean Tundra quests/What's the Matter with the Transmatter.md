==Objectives==
Collect 15 Fizzcrank Spare Parts and deliver them to [[Mordle Cogspinner]] at [[Fizzcrank Airstrip]].
* [[Fizzcrank Spare Parts]] (15)

==Description==
There're spare parts strewn all over to the east in the [[Scalding Pools]], the [[Geyser Fields]]... heck, probably even up on the pumping station still, too. Bring back a whole bunch. Maybe then I'll be able to get outgoing teleport on this thing working, not to mention getting the incoming transmatter ports aligned.

I'd hate to see another accident.... 

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|70}}
*20,100 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|g=2|s=40|}} at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
It's going to take a lot of spare parts to keep this thing running.

Please tell me that you've returned with everything we need.

==Completion==
That's great, <class>! These parts look like they're in serviceable condition.

Now if I could only figure out how to fix this blasted thing...
