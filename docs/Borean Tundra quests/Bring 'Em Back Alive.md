==Objectives==
[[Farmer Torp]] at [[Warsong Farms Outpost]] wants you to rescue 8 [[Infected Kodo Beast]]s.
* {{NPC||Infected Kodo Beast||Infected Kodo Beasts}} rescued (8)
* [[Torp's Kodo Snaffle]] (provided)

==Description==
Take this riding snaffle, <name>. You'll notice that I've placed a tiny medicine dispenser in the mouthpiece. That thing will cure the infection as soon as a kodo bites down. Once you've cured the sick out of 'em, you'll need to ride 'em home. They'll be weak so you'll need to gently direct 'em here.

Bring my babies back, <name>!

One last thing, you've got ten minutes! That's how long the antidote will remain effective inside that snaffle.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Transborean Cover
|Marshwalker Chestpiece
|Westrift Leggings
|Mightstone Pauldrons
}}

==Progress==
Get them out of those Scourge infested fields!

==Completion==
You're a true hero, <name>. My kodos would have died out there without you. You have my thanks and the thanks of all the soldiers and journeymen that will use these kodos to strengthen our presence in Northrend!
