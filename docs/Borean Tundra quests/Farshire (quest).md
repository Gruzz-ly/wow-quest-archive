'''Farshire''' is a [[breadcrumb quest]] that directs players who've completed the Alliance introduction quests in [[Valiance Keep]] over to the small town of [[Farshire]].

==Objectives==
Travel to [[Farshire]] in [[Borean Tundra]] and speak to [[Gerald Green]].

==Description==
My lads should be able to take it from here, <name>. [[Valiance Keep]] is built to take a beating far worse than this. I worry about our farmlands and mine in Farshire, however.

We sent a full detachment to protect our mining operations right before the invasion - they should be able to defend the civilians.

Gerald Green's in charge of the villagers there. There's a passage out of the northern wall out of Valiance Keep; it'll take you straight to him. See what you can do to help them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*180 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Completion==
You're here to help?  You're just in time then!

==Progression==
{{To the Aid of Farshire}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
