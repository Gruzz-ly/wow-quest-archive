==Objectives==
Speak to [[James Deacon]] at the inn in [[Valiance Keep]].

==Description==
Poor [[William Allerton|Mr. Allerton]] might yet help us find my brother.

<Leryssa unveils a voluminous book, not unlike an army recruitment ledger.>

I borrowed it, ok? Let's see, does that enlistment card have a date?

William saw [[Thassarian]] at the enlistment line. Their entries must be near each other... here it is!

He was assigned to Unit S? All the other military units are named after [[Alliance]] towns.

Who's in the unit? Where are they deployed? We need rumors. See if the innkeeper's heard anything.

==Completion==
Can't say I can help you friend. But I know someone who can.
