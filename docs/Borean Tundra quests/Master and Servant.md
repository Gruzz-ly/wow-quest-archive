==Objectives==
Use the Ultrasonic Screwdriver to reprogram 15 robots and then return to [[Crafty Wobblesprocket]] at [[Fizzcrank Airstrip]].

Make sure to loot the dead robot before you reprogram it.
* Robots reprogrammed (15)
* [[the Ultrasonic Screwdriver (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
The Ultrasonic Screwdriver is the ultimate tool. It can do anything to [[mechanical]] stuff!

Head back into the pools and dismantle a number of Mechazod's robots. Then all you have to do is use the screwdriver on their remains, and I'm betting that they'll turn to our side, for a short time anyway.

I'm pretty sure it won't work on the [[mechagnome]]s, so don't even bother with them.

Oh, and if you want to take anything from the robot's insides, you'll want to do so before using the screwdriver! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Layered Frost Robes|Reinforced Caribou-Hide Helm|Spiked Magmoth Mantle|Amberplate Legguards}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}}

==Progress==
How many robots have you managed to reprogram?

==Completion==
Woo hoo! And you brought the screwdriver intact too!

Reprogramming those robots is going to turn out to be a huge advantage in our favor in the fight against [[Gearmaster Mechazod]]. I think you've earned a little something for that.

==Notes and trivia==
*The screwdriver is very useful while questing in this area, but you will loose it when you hand in or abandon the quest. Wait with handing in until you have done all other quests in the [[Geyser Fields]] area, and you will have the constant assistance of converted mechanoids.
*For a big fight, e.g. against [[Gearmaster Mechazod]], try to first kill several mechanoids, keeping their bodies close together. Then use [[the Ultrasonic Screwdriver (quest item)]] on them in quick succession to make a small army of helpers and then attack the main target.
*"Master and Servant" is Depeche Mode's eleventh UK single (released on August 20, 1984) and the second single from the Some Great Reward album.
