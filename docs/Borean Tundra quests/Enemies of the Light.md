==Objectives==
[[Harbinger Vurenn]] wants you to fight the [[Cultist Necrolyte]]s near [[Farshire]] to the north of [[Valiance Keep]] and retrieve the Cultist Communique from them.
*[[Cultist Communique]]

==Description==
Not so fast there. I don't know about you, <class>, but I was hardly convinced by the general's words. They rung unsure... as if they were not his own.

Something's amiss here. All of our efforts to collaborate have been blocked and delayed. It is time we took a more independent approach.

If we're to learn more about the [[Cult of the Damned|cultists]] inside the keep... perhaps we should investigate those outside.

Intelligence reports a small group of them aiding the [[Scourge]] north of here. See if they carry any clues.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Marshwalker Legguards
|Tundrastrider Coif
|Mightstone Breastplate
|Harbinger's Wrath
}}

You will also receive:
*1,400 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with the [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
You're back, <name>.

==Completion==
Be discreet, <name>.  We cannot look at this evidence in front of prying eyes.

==Progression==
{{Hiding in Plain Sight}}

==Patch changes==
