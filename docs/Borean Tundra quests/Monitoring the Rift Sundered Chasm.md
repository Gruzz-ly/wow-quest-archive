==Objectives==
[[Librarian Garren|Garren]] at [[Amber Ledge]] wants you to use the Arcanometer at the Sundered Chasm anomaly and return to him with the readings.
* Sundered Chasm Reading Taken
* [[Arcanometer]] (provided)

==Description==
Did you feel that?! That was just an aftershock... you should've been here a few minutes ago!

I'm afraid I must call upon your services again. My instruments indicate that there is an immense disruption just west of here, far beneath the water's surface.

Just as before, I need you to take the arcanometer and capture the anomaly's data.

I'll cast a spell that will enable you to breathe underwater. If it wears off before you find it, come let me know and I'll renew its effects. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3|70}}

==Progress==
Well, <class>?

Were you able to locate the anomaly?

==Completion==
It was how big?

That's impossible! I need to report to [[Dalaran]] at once!

==Notes==
On accepting this quest, Librarian Garren casts Water Breathing on the player.

Jump in the water just north of Garren and swim toward the big pink thing on the seafloor. {{coords|44.2|27.8|Borean Tundra}}
