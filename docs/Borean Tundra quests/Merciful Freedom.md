==Objectives==
[[Shadowstalker Canarius]] at [[Warsong Farms Outpost]] wants you to free 5 Scourge Prisoners.
* [[Scourge Prisoner]] Freed (5)

==Description==
The soldiers that they didn't kill are being held in [[Scourge Cage|cages]] scattered across this farmland. Through some thievery we've managed to find a few keys, but we're unable to get close enough to any prisoners without being attacked.

We need your "talents" in securing those [[Scourge Cage Key|keys]] and freeing the prisoners. Bash in the brains of the [[En'kilah Necrolord|necrolord]]s and [[Warsong Aberration|aberration]]s and take their keys. Use those keys to free [[Scourge Prisoner|Scourge prisoner]]s.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*20,100 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|40||}} at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
Save those prisoners!

==Completion==
Each prisoner saved is one less [[undead]] aberration that we have to deal with, <name>. You've done a great service for the [[Horde]].
