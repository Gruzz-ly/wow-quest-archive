==Objectives==
[[Keristrasza]] wants you to speak to her when you are ready to prepare for a confrontation with [[Malygos]].

If you lose your [[:Augmented Arcane Prison]], speak to [[Raelorasz]] at the [[Transitus Shield]].

==Description==
I am... free?

I was destined to spend an eternity roaming an empty abyss, and now am saved? You cannot fathom my gratitude, mortal.

When I refused to bend to his will Malygos bound me to that prison, then shattered it and scattered the pieces. Should I live one hundred of your lifetimes, I shall not forget this kindness.

Perhaps, in time, I will find ways to repay you. For now, though, we must focus our attention on Malygos. I am weak, and there is much to be done.

I need your help, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
* {{cost||48}}
* 2,000 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Wyrmrest Accord]]

==Completion==
We cannot wait for me to regain my strength.

I must rely on you to make our preparations...
