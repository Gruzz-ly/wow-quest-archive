== Objectives ==
[[Jeremiah Hawning]] wants you to retrieve the book "Fields, Factories and Workshops" from the burning building next to the mine in [[Farshire]].
*[[Fields, Factories and Workshops]]

== Description ==
I was in charge of the [[harvest golem]]s - an important job until the [[Scourge]] destroyed most of our farmlands. I've an idea that would make the golems useful again, however.

I think I can rewire the harvest collectors so they'll give us a hand fighting the Scourge.

I'm not an expert at this just yet, so I'm going to need my manual. The problem is, I left it at the workshop... which happens to be that burning building next to the mine. Think you could go salvage it?

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*1,050 [[XP]]
*{{cost||20}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with the [[Valiance Expedition]]

== Progress ==
Did you get my book back?

== Completion ==
Excellent!  The information I need should be in here.

==Progression==
{{To the Aid of Farshire}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
