==Objectives==
Search the [[Spire of Blood]] for more information about the Vial of Fresh Blood.
*[[Vial of Fresh Blood]] (provided)

==Description==
As you inspect the captured blood vial, you realize its contents are still warm. The victim must have just been bled and may still be alive.

What use would the Scourge have for blood? They've never shown an interest in live prisoners in the past. Perhaps if you can locate the source of the blood, you'll be able to discover what the Scourge is planning.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|90}}
*15,250 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|3|66|}} at level 80)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[The Taunka]]

==Progress==
How... how did you find me?

==Completion==
<The taunka snow tracker appears weak and barely responds to you.>

I haven't... long. Maybe... maybe you can stop them... before...

==Progression==
