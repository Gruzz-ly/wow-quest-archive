This ends the chain about Fezzix completing his gyrocopter, and segues into the [[Shrouds of the Scourge]] chain.

==Objectives==
[[Fezzix Geartwist]] at [[Taunka'le Village]] wants you to bring him 5 Steam Cured Hides.
*[[Steam Cured Hide]] (5)
*[[Uncured Caribou Hide]] (5)

==Description==
Remember all that gnomish duct tape you brought me?

Well, I've found a use for it. The body of this [[flying machine]] is so banged up in places, that I'm going to need to reinforce it if I ever hope to fly.

Dorain over there has been telling me that the [[taunka]] use steam cured caribou leather for making watertight containers. Marsh caribou live all around the village and in the [[Flood Plains]] to the south. Get the best hides you can find and cure them over the steam vents in the [[Geyser Fields]].

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox|

|Reinforced Elastic Band
|Ring-Ridden Wrist Protectors
|Thin Dexterity Enhancing Tube
}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|9|40|}}
*25,150 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|3|3|}} at level 80)

==Progress==
Did you get that cured caribou hide for me?

==Completion==
Fantastic! A few more tweaks and I'll be an airborne goblin!
