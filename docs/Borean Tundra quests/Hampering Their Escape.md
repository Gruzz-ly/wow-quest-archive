==Objectives==
[[Etaruk]], outside the [[Coldrock Quarry]], wants you to destroy the North Platform, the East Platform, and the West Platform.
* East Platform Destroyed
* North Platform Destroyed
* West Platform Destroyed

==Description==
I'm sure you've seen those blue and white platforms hovering over the quarry. They're the transportation the mage hunters used to land their forces here, and now they're loading them up with our artifacts and fragments of our statues.

We must stop them before they leave the quarry.

The [[Beryl Reclaimer|small creatures]] digging in the quarry carry [[Gnomish Grenade|explosives]]. Take them and use them to destroy the three floating platforms. The leader keeps watch from a fourth, grounded platform, but we'll deal with him afterward. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
Have you succeeded in destroying the mage hunters' flying platforms?

==Completion==
The mage hunters won't find it as easy to plunder our quarry and steal our artifacts as they'd imagined. With your help, we'll win back the quarry and set things right again.

==Progression==
