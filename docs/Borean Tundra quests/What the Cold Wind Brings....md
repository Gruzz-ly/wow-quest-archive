==Objectives==
Take Ith'rix's Hardened Carapace to [[Varok Saurfang|High Overlord Saurfang]] at [[Warsong Hold]].
*[[Ith'rix's Hardened Carapace]] (provided)

==Description==
You hold the carapace fragment of [[Ith'rix the Harvester]] and realize that this is only the beginning. Even now you sense that victory is fleeting. Surely the [[Lich King]] has a thousand more beasts like Ith'rix, waiting to be unleashed upon the [[Horde]].

Take your trophy and present it to High Overlord Saurfang, inside Warsong Hold. He should be notified of your victory over a powerful [[Scourge]] agent.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sweltering Leggings 	
|Marshwalker Waistguard
|Plainhunter's Epaulettes 	
|Battle Leader's Breastplate}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|2|40}}
*20100  [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
What have you got there?

==Completion==
<Saurfang grins.>

It looks familiar... The Might of Kalimdor trampled a thousand bugs like this one in the desert of [[Silithus]].

This is a different place - a different environment - but the result will be the same.

<Saurfang looks you over.>

You will bring pride and honor to the Horde in [[Northrend]], <name>.
