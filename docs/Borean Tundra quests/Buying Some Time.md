==Objectives==
[[Thassarian]] at [[the Wailing Ziggurat]] in [[Borean Tundra]] wants you to inflict 20 casualties against the [[Scourge]] inside the [[Temple City of En'kilah]]. Use Lurid's Bones if you need assistance.
* En'kilah Casualty (20)
*[[Lurid's Bones]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that we have the [[phylactery]], I shouldn't have any problems getting the information I need. It won't take long for the Scourge in the Temple City to notice something's up, however.

I won't be able to fend off a full scale attack here. Or maybe I would... but I'd rather not find out.

I want you to head down there and inflict some casualties. Hopefully they'll be distracted long enough for these two to spill their guts... figuratively, of course. Take [[Lurid]] with you, he might be of aid.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Dusk Watcher's Belt|Shadewrap Gloves|Tundrastrider Boots|Death Knight's Anguish}}

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
That should buy us some time. [[High Deathpriest Isidorus|Isidorus]] has been cooperative, but I really needed that time alone with the [[lich]].

==Notes==
Targets include [[En'kilah Abomination]]s, [[En'kilah Crypt Fiend]]s, [[En'kilah Gargoyle]]s, [[En'kilah Ghoul]]s, [[En'kilah Necromancer]]s, but ''not'' [[Darkfallen Bloodbearer]]s.
