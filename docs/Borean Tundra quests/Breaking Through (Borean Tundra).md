==Objectives==
Defeat [[Prince Valanar]] and his lieutenants, Vanthryn the Merciless and Luthion the Vile, then report to [[Chieftain Wintergale]] at [[Taunka'le Village]].
*[[Prince Valanar]] Slain
*[[Vanthyrn the Merciless]] Slain
*[[Luthion the Vile]] Slain

==Description==
On the lowest tier of the Temple City, there is a gray altar bathed in light. Step into it to gain entry to the dread necropolis Naxxanar.

Be cautious, <name>. Prince Valanar will certainly be defended by his personal retainers, who will give their lives to keep you from ascending to the top level of the necropolis.

You must find your way through the necropolis to the prince's seat. If you fail to defeat him, <name>, I fear my people will never know the safety Icemist offers.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Chain of Vigilant Thought|Clutch of Undying Will|Choker of Forceful Redemption}}

You will also receive:
*25010 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|3|}} at level 80)
*350 [[reputation]] with [[The Taunka]]

==Progress==
Have you defeated Prince Valanar?

==Completion==
With the prince defeated, the Scourge presence in Borean Tundra is broken. I have no illusions that they will stay away for long, which is why I must focus on preparing Durm to lead the villagers on their way to Icemist.

<The chieftain shakes his head slowly>

For all the disagreemants I've had with Durm, I trust his judgement and his abilities. I cannot bring myself to abandon Taunka'le, so I will defend it until I am slain.
