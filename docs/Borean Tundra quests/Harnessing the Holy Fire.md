==Objectives==
Empower yourself with Unstable Holy Energy by defeating [[Wrath Ember|Wraths of the Light]] or siphoning from [[Breach of Holy Energy|Breaches of Holy Energy]] around the foundation of the [[Nexus]].
*Empowered with Unstable Holy Energy

==Description==
The energy from [[:Light's Wrath]] lashes out from within the weakened [[Nexus Vault]]. We may be able to use this raw, chaotic energy to our advantage.

If we can harness this energy and feed it into the [[Surge needle|Surge Needles]], it should cause a rather... destructive reaction.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I see you are able to harness the energies of Light's Wrath. It has been a long time since there was a [[priest]] that could control it.

Now, are you prepared to unleash it?

==Notes==
Upon accepting the quest (which happens automatically after completing [[Eyes of the Dragon (priest)]]), an "Unstable Holy Energy" bar appears in your UI. The tooltip description reads: "Gathered holy energy unleashed by Light's Wrath from within the Nexus Vault."

To fill the bar, kill [[Wrath Ember]]s or channel energy from the [[Breach of Holy Energy|Breaches of Holy Energy]] around the foundation of the Nexus.

As you absorb energy, you gain the "Unstable Holy Energy" buff, whose description reads: "Absorb energy from Wraths{{sic}} Embers and Breaches of Holy Energy". As the energy bar fills up, your character begins to grow more and more brightly with holy energy.
