==Objectives==
Report to [[Overlord Razgor]] at the hut on the south side of [[Warsong Hold]].

==Description==
Do not let [[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]] dissuade you from your duties as a soldier of the [[Horde]], <race>. He bears a terrible burden in these frozen wastes, with the outcome of his charge resulting in victory over the [[Scourge]] or the extinction of all life on [[Azeroth]]. It is for this reason that we require your strength and wisdom.

The Scourge have begun their assault upon this fortress. Our soldiers steady the line, but are in desperate need of backup. Report to Razgor. He is stationed directly outside of [[Warsong Hold]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2,000 [[XP]] (or {{cost||24||}} at level 80)
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Completion==
Just in time... The [[Nerubian]]s have seemingly doubled in number in just a week's time. We could use all the help we can get out here.

==Notes==
There are three different versions of this quest depending on your progress in earlier game content.

*If you have turned in the [[Head of Nefarian]], you will receive this introduction:

Hellscream has the weight of the Horde upon his shoulders. Do not be dissuaded from your duties because of his temperament, <name>.

<Saurfang nods.>

Did you think that I would forget the name of a hero of Orgrimmar? It is not every day that I have the pleasure of putting the head of Nefarian on a pike!

The Scourge have begun their assault upon this fortress. Our soldiers steady the line, but are in desperate need of backup. Report to Razgor. He is stationed directly outside of Warsong Hold. 

:And this completion:

<Overlord Razgor salutes.>

Your reputation precedes you, <name>.

*If you received the title of [[Scarab Lord]], you will receive this introduction:

It seems that we always meet in the direst of circumstances, Scarab Lord. Were you not saving the world from certain destruction the last time we met?

<Saurfang chuckles.>

Your assistance is most welcome in Northrend, despite what the young chieftain might say.

If we had even a dozen more soldiers with your power, we would be sitting in Orgrimmar right now, hunched over a warm fire.

Report to Overlord Razgor, right outside the main entry to Warsong Hold, to the south.

:And this completion:

<Overlord Razgor salutes.>

A living legend battles among us! Your presence alone rouses the spirits of this army!
