==Objectives==
Speak to [[Kalecgos]] to agree to his proposition.
* Bonded with [[Tarecgosa]]'s Essence
* Speak to Kalecgos in [[Coldarra]].

==Description==
I was charged with her protection, yet it was she who sacrificed herself for my sake.

I cannot bear to lose her, <name>. I must make a solemn request of you.

Never has a mortal borne the essence of a true dragon, but with your permission I would make an exception.

Please, while there is life in her, will you allow me to bind Tarecgosa to you?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|25|94}}

==Progress==
Yes, friend?

==Completion==
I am grateful, <name>.

Were you not present, or had you refused, Tarecgosa would be lost to me.

==Notes==
;Speak with Kalecgos
:The eclipse of [[Azeroth]]'s moons is an occurrence that we of the blue dragonflight hold most sacred.

:{{gossip|It would be my honor, Kalecgos.}}

:''Kalecgos steps away from Tarecgosa, and casts a spell that encases the player in a magic shell. The shell lifts the player a few feet above, and begins siphoning Tarecgosa's essence, drawing it into the player. Tarecgosa's voice echoes in the player's mind.''
