==Objectives==
[[Chieftain Wintergale]] at [[Taunka'le Village]] wants you to wear the Imbued Scourge Shroud in the [[Temple City of En'kilah]] and scout the Spire of Blood, the Spire of Pain, and the Spire of Decay.
* [[Spire of Decay]] Scouted
* [[Spire of Blood]] Scouted
* [[Spire of Pain]] Scouted
* [[Imbued Scourge Shroud]]	 (provided)

==Description==
[[Sage Aeire]] has finished the shroud. Take it with you and travel to the [[Temple City of En'kilah]]. Don the cloak within the city's bounds to hide yourself from most of the [[Scourge]] there. This will be our best opportunity to gather information about the enemy's fortifications and leaders.

While wearing the cloak, scout the three large spires on the grounds of the city. While the shroud will shield you from most of the Scourge, the En'kilah [[abomination]]s will be able to find you if you get too close.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5||}}
*20,300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|4|86||}} at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Taunka]]

==Progress==
Have you finished scouting the temples in the Scourge's fortress?

==Completion==
<[[Chieftain Wintergale]] listens as your describe your observations.>

The information you've gathered will help us to plan our assault on the Temple City. We'll need to find a way to defeat the officers you identified and get into that [[necropolis]].

==Notes==
Equip the shroud once you have fully entered the city. It has no effect otherwise. You will lose the effect if you cast any spell or if you get too close to an [[En'kilah Abomination]], which are the only mobs that can see through your disguise. Simply un-equip and re-equip the shroud to regain the effect.

After completion of this quest, you will be offered [[A Courageous Strike]] and [[Neutralizing the Cauldrons]]. These quests are not required for any quest chains.
