==Objectives==
[[Corporal Venn]] at [[Death's Stand]] wants you to slay 7 Ziggurat Defenders.
* [[Ziggurat Defender]] slain (7)

==Description==
Our situation is nearly hopeless. We were ordered to take [[the Wailing Ziggurat]] with a handful of men.

We'll be lucky if we can hold this position against the [[Scourge]]. We're outnumbered, injured and have no escape route.

If you can take some of the pressure off of us, we might be able to solidify our position. Kill some of the [[undead]] circling the structure - we'll hold off their advance. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards:|Sweltering Leggings|Marshwalker Waistguard|Plainhunter's Epaulettes|Battle Leader's Breastplate}}

==Progress==
Did you make any progress? We're in a bind here.

==Completion==
That should buy us some time, <name>. We'll hope against hope for reinforcements from [[Valiance Keep]].

==Progression==
