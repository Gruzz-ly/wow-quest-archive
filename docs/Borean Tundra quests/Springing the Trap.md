==Objectives==
[[Raelorasz]] wants you to use Raelorasz' Spark at the [[Signal Fire|signal fire]] in [[Coldarra]].
* Assault on [[Malygos]] Complete
* [[Raelorasz' Spark]] (provided)

==Description==
We owe this opportunity in great part to your efforts, <name>.

It is only fitting that you initiate the attack on Malygos.

Take this spark and use it to light the signal fire northwest of the Nexus. [[Keristrasza]] will direct you from there. 

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Crimson Will|Serrated Scale Shank|Fiery Prod|Rod of the Crimson Keeper|Smoldering Talon|Scaled Flame Cloak}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|70}}
*+325 [[reputation]] with [[Wyrmrest Accord]]

==Progress==
Did you meet with Keristrasza?

==Completion==
We have dealt a blow to Malygos, but it has come at a high price.

==Notes==
The signal fire to light is on the northern entrance to the Nexus at {{coords|25.4|21.8|Borean Tundra}}. If the fire is already lit, another player is enjoying the quest script. Wait for the fire to go out (less than two minutes), then use [[Raelorasz' Spark]].

Drop any shapeshifts/forms before using the fire, as part of the script involves getting taxied around [[Coldarra]]. The quest completes before [[Keristrasza]] starts her trip, so the following points do not affect successful completion just whether you see the story.

:{{text|say|Keristrasza|Stay close to me, <name>. I could not bear for any harm to come to you.}}
:{{text|yell|Keristrasza|MALYGOS!!}}
:''Keristrasza puts the Corpse of Saragosa on the ground.''
:{{text|yell|Keristrasza|Come, Lord of Magic, and recover your precious consort....}}
:''Keristrasza flames the Corpse and sets it on fire.''
:{{text|yell|Keristrasza|...what remains of her!}}
:{{text|say|Keristrasza|Come, <name>. Let us see the fruits of our efforts.}}
:''Keristrasza takes the player on her back and flies around the Nexus, observing the situation, including Malygos battling the reds high above.''
:{{text|yell|Malygos|Saragosa! What has become of you?}}
:''She lands in eastern Coldarra'' (at {{coords|34.3|25.2|Borean Tundra}}) ''as the quest completes, but the script event continues.''
:{{text|say|Keristrasza|Hurry, <name>! Flee! Live to finish what we've begun here....}}
:{{text|yell|Malygos|Keristrasza! You've bested my consort... and now YOU shall take her place!}}
:''Malygos shoots a bolt at Keristrasza, freezing her so that he can capture her.''
:{{text|yell|Keristrasza|Never!}}
:''Having caught Keristrasza, both dragons despawn.''
