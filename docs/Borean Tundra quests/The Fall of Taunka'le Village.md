==Objectives==
Speak to [[Mother Tauranook]] outside the gates of Taunka'le Village.

==Description==
We are lost, <name>. This place has been our home for many generations, but it is no longer safe. There remains only death... Death and a memory of what used to be.

I have called for the evacuation of [[Taunka'le]]. All remaining taunka must leave at once and make their way to our capital city, [[Icemist Village|Icemist]], located in the [[Dragonblight]].

<Wintergale points east.>

You must help get my people to safety, <name>. [[Mother Tauranook]] awaits you at the village gates. Hurry! The [[Scourge]] closes in from all sides! 

==Completion==
<Mother Tauranook wipes her tears away.>

There was once a time when I could walk across this tundra and the snow would fill my view for as far as I could see.

But the snow has left us - signaling that our time here has come to an end. We leave behind [[Taunka'le Village]] and the [[Borean Tundra]] with many happy memories...

<Mother Tauranook whimpers.>

Perhaps the future will welcome our return - along with the snow.
