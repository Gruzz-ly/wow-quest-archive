==Objectives==
Slay 15 En'kilah Ghouls and 5 En'kilah Necromancers and report back to [[Durm Icehide]] at [[Taunka'le Village]].
* [[En'kilah Ghoul]] slain (15)
* [[En'kilah Necromancer]] slain (5)

==Description==
From the beginning, I've counseled that [[Chieftain Wintergale]] should assemble our mighty warriors and attack our enemy at their base. My advice has fallen on deaf ears and he has proven that he'd rather tip-toe around according to [[Sage Aeire]]'s plans.

I'll wait no longer. If Chieftain Wintergale is too cowardly to send our warriors into battle, perhaps you'd be willing to show him that a direct attack can succeed. Storm the [[Temple City of En'kilah]] and slay all in your path, <name>. 

==Progress==
Don't bother me unless you've come to report a successful mission.

==Completion==
You have proven your fearlessness and demonstrated your prowess in combat. I believe you would make a fine [[taunka]] warrior. I only wish the chieftain had the same understanding.

We are fortunate to count you as an ally in our struggle to evacuate the village before it is overrun by the [[Scourge]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5||}}
*20,300 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|4|86|}} at level 80)
*250 reputation with [[The Taunka]]

==Notes==
This quest will be offered after completing [[Blending In]]. It is not required for any quest chains.
