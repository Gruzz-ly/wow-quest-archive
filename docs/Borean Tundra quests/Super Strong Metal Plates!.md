==Objectives==
[[Mobu]] at the [[Coast of Echoes]] in the [[Borean Tundra]] wants you to collect 10 [[Super Strong Metal Plate]]s.
* [[Super Strong Metal Plate]] (10)

==Description==
I need metal to patch these tanks up! Super strong metal plates can be found scattered about all across [[Garrosh's Landing]] and at the bottom of the bay.

Just be careful when you're out there searching for plates. The mist is... um... AGGRESSIVE! The mist is what took out the landing and the adjoining [[tuskarr]] town. Poor little tuskarr...

==Progress==
Remember, the mist is bad!

==Completion==
Great work, buddy! Now where'd I put that pneumatic tank transjigamarig.

==Progression==
