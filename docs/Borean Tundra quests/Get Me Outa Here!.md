==Objectives==
Escort Bonker Togglevolt to safety and then report in with [[Fizzcrank Fullthrottle]] at [[Fizzcrank Airstrip]].
* [[Bonker Togglevolt]] escorted to safety.

==Description==
I knew they'd send someone for me sooner or later... turned out to be later, of course.

I came in here to parlay with the [[snobold]]s, but their main shaman, [[Kaganishu]], decided instead that I'd make a tasty snack for [[Magmothregar]].

Wait... what?! They didn't send you?!

DID THEY FORGET ABOUT ME?!

Okay, you're here now and that's all that matters.

As soon as you break this chain we'll make our way back to the airstrip. Then you can tell Fizzcrank I'm safely back.

If he remembers me, that is. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Lost Marksman's Rifle|Dry Earth Circle|Branch of Everlasting Flame}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|10}}
*25400 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Completion==
Huh? What?

Bonker who?

I've no idea who you're talking about, but I'll take your word for it. If you rescued him or her from the pit of Magmoth then I suppose you deserve a reward.

Let me see what I've got lying around in here....

==Notes==
Bonker's at the bottom of the cave in [[Magmoth]], by [[Magmothregar]].
