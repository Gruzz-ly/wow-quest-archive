==Objectives==
[[Etaruk]], on the outskirts of the [[Coldrock Quarry]], wants you to kill Curator Insivius.
* [[Curator Insivius]] slain

==Description==
The leader of the mage hunter forces is a fearsome creature called Curator Insivius. My people have hunted the beasts of the seas and land for countless generations, but I've never seen anything like this curator before.

He's landed one of those flying disks on the upper rim of the quarry and oversees the operation from there. <name>, I can only believe the ancestors themselves sent you to my rescue and I hope you will help me drive the mage hunters from this quarry once and for all. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Sealskin Bindings|Seaspeaker Gloves|Icechill Buckler|Lost Crusader Waistguard}}
You will also receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
Have you done away with the curator?

==Completion==
The curator and his men must've thought the quarry an easy target for their looting, but you've shown them otherwise, <name>. I am deeply grateful for your help and I'm certain the ancestors will continue to watch over you.
