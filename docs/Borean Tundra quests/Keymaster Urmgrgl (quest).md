==Objectives==
[[Glrglrglr]] inside the [[Winterfin Caverns]] has asked you to retrieve Urmgrgl's Key.
*[[Urmgrgl's Key]]

==Description==
I have to get out of these caverns! There's magic stuff seeping in from Coldarra, above, and affecting everyone's minds.

I don't intend to be controlled like these others!

[[Keymaster Urmgrgl]] is in the cave below and to the south. He holds the key to my cage. Get it from him and bring it back so that I can unlock my cage and get out of here.

Hurry! 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
Do you have the key?

No, I don't care about any of these others. I just want to get out of here!

==Completion==
Quickly, hand it here!

==Notes==
;On completion
:{{Text|say|[[Glrglrglr]]|So long, suckers. I'm out of here!}}
:''Glrglrglr runs off.  On reaching the entrance to the cave...''
:{{Text|say|Glrglrglr|I made it.  Freedom at last!}}

This is NOT an escort quest.  Glrglrglr runs off on his own.
