==Objectives==
While disguised as a [[Warsong clan|Warsong]] [[orc]], plant the Warsong Banner in the corpse of Magmothregar. Then, return with the disguise to [[Crafty Wobblesprocket]] at [[Fizzcrank Airstrip]].
* [[Warsong Banner]] Planted in [[Magmothregar]]
* [[Warsong Orc Disguise]] (provided)

==Description==
With all of those outfits you, er, recovered, I fashioned a Warsong orc disguise. I had the genius idea of combining it with some old stuff that I had left hanging around from last [[Hallow's End|Hallows' End]], so it should be foolproof!

Here, in [[Crafty's Sack|this sack]] is the disguise and the banner you recovered. Head down into the bowels of [[Magmoth]] and slay the magnataur chieftain, Magmothregar.

If you're going to convince them to turn their attention on the Warsong orcs, you'll need to plant the banner while disguised.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Frostbiter|Hungering Greatstaff|Shivering Healer's Cloak|Jagged Icefist|Frostspeaker Collar}}
You will also receive: {{cost|10}}

==Progress==
It's all over then? You've done the dirty deed and framed the orcs at [[Bor'gorok Outpost]]?

==Completion==
Holey moley, you did it!

Alright, now those pesky [[magnataur]] and their [[snobold]] flunkies should turn their attentions on the [[Horde]].

How can I ever repay you, <name>?

==Notes==
Magmothregar is located at the bottom of Magmoth in the cave. While down there, pick up [[Bonker Togglevolt]]'s escort quest [[Get Me Outa Here!]]
