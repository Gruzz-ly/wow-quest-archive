'''The Trail's Gone Cold''' concludes day three of the [[Guest Relations]] storyline. On 1 November, the storyline continued with [[Warn the Detective]].

==Objectives==
Find [[Scrapes]]' hideout.
*Ask [[Maru]] for a hint (Optional)
*Mystery solved (0/100%)
*Return to [[Alyx]] outside the [[Caverns of Time]].
*[[Spirit's Whistle (Anniversary)]] (provided)

==Description==
I've tracked the scent of Scrapes as far as here, but this cold air smothers our lead. I found a couple scraps of notes. Nothing useful yet, but he seems to have left a paper trail in his hurry.

Look for clues that may indicate where our villain's lair is hidden. I will mark what I found on your map.

Take [[Spirit (hawk)|Spirit]]'s whistle. Call upon us when you are in need of assistance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 5x [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Progress==
How goes the hunt?

==Completion==
A shapeshifter? Oh, this is very bad.

We should warn the detective. I've not seen him recently, though.

Come back tomorrow. I am sure he will be back by then.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Rexxar|I have marked your map where the trail went cold. Start there and call upon us when you have a lead.}}

===Borean Tundra===
Rexxar has gossip, and Maru has a new clue:
{{Dialogue|title=Rexxar|Prepare yourself for the hunt.}}

If you blow [[Spirit's Whistle]] while next to Rexxar:
:{{Text|yell|Rexxar|You don't need to blow so hard. I'm right here!}}

{{Dialogue|title=Maru|
{{Gossip|{{Text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain your primary case to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

Look around the X on your map using your torch and idol. You're sure to find a clue!}}

Open the world map and head to the X, Marked Trail - The last known location of Scrapes at {{co|86.0|34.0|Borean Tundra}} in [[Transborea]]. At the lake are [[Distracting Wisp]]s, so ignore the [[Idol of Ohn'ahra]] near them. Approach the shed near the lake and melt the snow pile on the outside with the [[Torch of Pyrreth]] to reveal a [[Torn Note (Borean Tundra)|Torn Note]] to loot [[Torn Diary, Page 7]]. Another Torn Note is inside the shed, containing [[Torn Diary, Page 4]].

The idol is useless with the wisps nearby, so summon Rexxar:
{{Dialogue|The wind blows strongly to the east here. We must continue the hunt without Spirit for now.}}

Get away from the shed and the wisps and the idol will lock on a location to the east, where the last Torn Note is at {{Co|88.11|34.60|Borean Tundra}} in some brush, which contains [[Torn Diary, Page 6]].

The relevant parts of the notes read, in order:
{{dialogue|...dreading the return to the humidity, but I have to go somewhere safe.

...at least the crystals are pretty up on that nearby plateau... 

...and purple IS my favorite color... }}

At this point, progress is still at 20%, and Maru offers a new hint:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|{{Text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain your primary case to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

Hmm. Maybe this guy went somewhere north to somewhere humid? If you find tat place, give Rexxar a whistle!
}}

Before leaving, note that the Distracting Wisps are in the shape of {{wp|Crater (constellation)|the constellation Crater}} and some curious junk can be fished from the open water under the wisps. This is part of the secret to obtain {{item|Keys to Incognitro, the Indecipherable Felcycle|Incognitro, the Indecipherable Felcycle}}. More information is on the Incognitro article, or in [[Guest Relations#Incognitro, the Indecipherable Felcycle|the Incognitro section of the Guest Relations article]].

===Sholazar Basin===
Nearby plateaus with crystals on them are in [[Sholazar Basin]], so head northwest into the jungle. Calling Rexxar in Sholozar Basin will mark two locations on the map:
# [[Nesingwary Base Camp]]: Potential Witnesses - Someone here may have information on Scrapes.
# [[Glimmering Pillar]]: Fresh Marks - Scrapes may have come this way.

{{dialogue|Spirit flies above. I will mark on your map what I see through his eyes.}}

Maru also offers advice:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|{{Text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain your primary case to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

Maybe someone at Nesingwary's camp seen him...? Ask around! Ask around lotsa times!
}}

At Nesingwary Base Camp, the innkeeper [[Purser Boulian]] has some information about Scrapes:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|Have you seen any undead come through this way?}}

Actually, yeah. He wandered through here complaining about the heat. Said he was headed north.}}

The plateau with purple crystals specifically is the [[Glimmering Pillar]] at {{co|50|38|Sholazar Basin}} north of the central lake. Fly to the top of the Glimmering Pillar and bring the [[Idol of Ohn'ahra]] back online. It points to a [[Mounted Spyglass]] at {{co|49.7|36.0|Sholazar Basin}} aimed to the north-northeast. Interact with it:

{{dialogue|<The spyglass appears to be aimed at the distant fortress.>}}

Maru has a new hint:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|{{Text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain your primary case to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

Have you tried talking to Rexxar and Spirit?}}

===Icecrown===
[[File:Scrapes Balargarde.jpg|thumb|Scrapes]]
Mount up and cross over to [[Jotunheim]] in [[Icecrown]]. Summoning Rexxar will mark another X on the map at [[Balargarde Fortress]] for Scrapes' Hideout - Spirit has identified Scrapes' Hidden Camp.

At this point, Maru provides another new hint:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|{{Text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain your primary case to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

Can't find any clues? Maybe Rexxar has some ideas!}}

Re-equip the idol and follow it to the southwest corner of the building. At roughly {{co|16|59|Icecrown}} the idol points to a campfire with the corpse of [[Scrapes]] and some [[Footprints]] then [[Hoofprints (Anniversary)|Hoofprints]] leading away! A haunch of [[Mystery Meat (Anniversary)|Mystery Meat]] is also by the fire. Interact with Scrapes, who has some class-specific options:

{{dialogue|title=Scrapes|<Scrapes appears to have been murdered.>

{{ClassIcon|Demon Hunter}}{{ClassIcon|Hunter}}{{ClassIcon|Warlock}} {{gossip|<Attempt to sense demons.>}}

{{Dialogue-child|<Using your ability to sense [[demon]]s, you detect the residue of a demonic presence.>}}

{{ClassIcon|Hunter}}{{ClassIcon|Rogue}} {{gossip|<Inspect the wounds.>}}

{{dialogue-child|<You analyze the body with your knowledge of wounds. Scrapes was clawed, possibly by a beast or [[satyr]].>}}

{{ClassIcon|Druid}}{{ClassIcon|Mage}}{{ClassIcon|Paladin}}{{ClassIcon|Priest}}{{ClassIcon|Shaman}}{{ClassIcon|Warlock}} {{gossip|<Attempt to detect magic.>}}

{{dialogue-child|<Using your magical prowess, you detect the residue of illusion magic.>}}
}}

Summon Rexxar with the whistle:
{{dialogue|title=Rexxar|Spirit flies above. I will mark on your map what I see through his eyes.

{{gossip|I think I know what happened.}}

What do you think?

{{plainlist|
* {{gossip|Scrapes was hunted down by a human on a horse.}}
{{Dialogue-child|Hmm. I sense a darker presence lingering on the corpse.}}
* {{gossip|Scrapes was mauled by a tiger.}}
{{Dialogue-child|Hmm. I sense a darker presence lingering on the corpse.}}
* {{gossip|Scrapes was killed by a shapeshifter.}}}}

{{dialogue-child|Yes, it would appear so. Some sly demon is causing havoc.<br>

Unfortunately, I must return to my other duties soon. I trust you can find this demon and put an end to this.}}
