'''Traversing the Rift''' concludes the primary [[Amber Ledge]] quest line, leading players to the [[Transitus Shield]] and its quests.

==Objectives==
[[Surristrasz]] want you to travel to [[Coldarra]]. Once there, you are to speak with [[Archmage Berinand]].

==Description==
I've been mindful of your efforts, mortal. Do not feign surprise. Surely you've felt my eye upon you.

The time has come to peel back a layer of darkness from your mind. There are stark truths that you have grown ready to accept.

Before hearing the tale, you shall be shown firsthand what we face.

Put your affairs in order, <class>....

==Rewards==
You will gain:
* {{cost|3|70}}
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Completion==
Welcome to Coldarra, <class>.

Under the [[Transitus Shield]] we lie hidden just a stone's throw from the [[Nexus]], fortress of the great [[Dragon Aspect|aspect]] [[Malygos]] and his [[blue dragonflight]].

Do make yourself comfortable.
