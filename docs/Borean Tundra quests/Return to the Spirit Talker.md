==Objectives==
Deliver Imperean's Primal to [[Spirit Talker Snarlfang]] at [[Bor'gorok Outpost]].
*[[Imperean's Primal]] (provided)

==Description==
You have done what was asked, and now I give you that which you desire.

Deliver this primal to the spirit talker back at your [[Bor'gorok Outpost]]. If she is wise, she will know a ritual to gain you the information which you seek. 

==Progress==
<name>, you have returned. What did you learn?

What is that sound?

==Completion==
Imperean gave you a primal essence of herself? I can hear its howling winds!

I know a ritual we can make use of it in. We must hurry before her primal rips itself apart!

==Progression==
