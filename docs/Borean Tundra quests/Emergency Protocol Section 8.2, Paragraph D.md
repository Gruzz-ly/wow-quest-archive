==Objectives==
[[Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle]] wants you to scuttle the Eastern Wreck, a Southern Wreck, and a Northwestern Wreck.
* Scuttle the Eastern Wreck
* Scuttle a Southern Wreck
* Scuttle a Northwestern Wreck

==Description==
There's only one more thing left to do before I can finally return to the [[Fizzcrank Airstrip|airstrip]] and make my report. Section 8.2, paragraph D of the emergency protocol requires me to scuttle as much of the wreckage as possible, in order to prevent our technology from falling into enemy hands.

I'll give you [[Emergency Torch|my torch]] if you agree to help me complete this last duty. I don't want to think about what the [[Horde]]'s [[goblin]] allies will do if these machines fall into their hands. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|70}}
*20100 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
Have you scuttled the wreckage yet?

==Completion==
Once again, you have my thanks, <name>. Without you, I would not have been able to recover anything useful from this disaster.
