==Objectives==
Take Luther's Journal to [[Shadowstalker Barthus]] at [[Warsong Hold]].
* [[Luther's Journal]] (provided)

==Description==
You skim through the pages of the book, looking for anything of importance. On the last page you discover what appears to be frantic scribbling:

[[En'kilah Necrolord|Necrolord]]s. At least a dozen by my count.

Farms to west being used as some sort of horrible spawning glade for Scourge.

Row upon row of victims.

I think they're on to me. Made a dash for the hold. I won't be captured alive.

[[Dreadvenom]] hemotoxin. If they decide to bite into me, they'll be in for a surprise.

Take this information back to Barthus.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|2|43}}

==Progress==
Is he dead?

==Completion==
<Barthus flips to the last page of the journal and begins reading.>

This is very bad news. [[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]] must be notified at once.

==Progression==
{{:Untold Truths}}

==Patch changes==
