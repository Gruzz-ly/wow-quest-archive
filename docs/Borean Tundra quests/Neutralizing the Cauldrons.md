==Objectives==
[[Sage Aeire]] at [[Taunka'le Village]] wants you to use her [[totem]] to neutralize the East Cauldron, the Central Cauldron, and the West Cauldron in the Temple City of En'kilah.
* [[East En'kilah Cauldron|East Cauldron]] Cleansed
* [[Central En'kilah Cauldron|Central Cauldron]] Cleansed
* [[West En'kilah Cauldron|West Cauldron]] Cleansed
* [[Sage Aeire's Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
The presence of [[plague cauldron]]s within the [[Temple City of En'kilah]] worries me greatly, <name>. It's clear that [[Chieftain Wintergale]] trusts your judgment and your knowledge of our enemy. Would you help me deal with the cauldrons as you help the chieftain carry out his plans in the Temple City?

I've prepared a totem which will attack and neutralize the contents of the cauldrons. All you must do is locate the cauldrons and use the totem near each. Each [[Scourge]] weapon we destroy brings us closer to victory.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Layered Frost Hood
|Rhinohide Wristwraps
|Spiked Magmoth Gloves
|Chilled Pauldrons
}}

You will receive:
*{{cost|5||}}
*20300 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|4|86|}} at level 80)
*250 reputation with [[The Taunka]]

==Progress==
Have you used the totem on all the plague cauldrons?

==Completion==
<[[Sage Aeire]] accepts the totem from you.>

Did the totem work? Its preparation required ancient magics the sages haven't used in generations. Of all the knowledge passed down, only a fraction of it remains in use today.

==Notes==
This quest will be offered after completing [[Blending In]]. It is not required for any quest chains.
