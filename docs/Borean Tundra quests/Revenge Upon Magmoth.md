*[[Magmoth Crusher]] slain (3)
*[[Mate of Magmothregar]] slain (3)

== Description ==
[[Overlord Bor'gorok|The overlord]] refuses to allow the [[shaman]] to heal my wounds. He says that it will be a good lesson for me and give me time to reflect upon my failure.

But you could get revenge for me and the others who fell at Magmoth!

I know that the spirit talker wants you to go in there to save the farseer.

It's just to the east. Go, <class>... go slay the magnataur and their snobold servants. Regain the outpost's honor!

== Rewards ==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox|
|Layered Frost Robes
|Reinforced Caribou-Hide Helm
|Spiked Magmoth Mantle
|Amberplate Legguards}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
Lok'tar, <class>. You could not possibly have slain everything at Magmoth in such a short time!

==Completion==
The dead are honored by your actions, <name>.

Perhaps now I can find my way back to being the warrior I once was.
