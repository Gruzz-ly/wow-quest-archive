==Objectives==
Speak with [[Grunt Ragefist]] at [[Steeljaw's Caravan]].

==Description==
That dimwitted cur, [[Force-Commander Steeljaw|Steeljaw]], tried to take our [[caravan]] of supplies on a shortcut through a [[taunka]] [[graveyard]]!

We just struck up relations with them!

Now the caravan lies in ruins, overrun by the taunka [[Ghost|spirits]] that rose out of their graves as he was trampling them.

Head south and see if you can salvage the situation, <class>. I sent Grunt Ragefist and a few others down there with him to help out.

Why don't you see if you can lend a hand.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2000 [[XP]] (or {{cost||s=24|}} compensation at level 80)
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[The Taunka]]

==Completion==
This isn't good, <class>.

[[Longrunner Proudhoof]] says that these are the burial grounds of his honored ancestors.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
