== Objectives ==
Go to the town hall building in [[Farshire]] and ring the bell inside of it.
*[[Bell Rope|Farshire Bell]] Rung

== Description ==
Farshire has a fighting chance now, <name>. That's all we could've asked for and you've made it possible.

All we need now is a rallying point. I'll have my men deliver the weapons to our town hall. Go and ring the town hall bell so any survivors know to rally there.

It's time to show the [[Scourge]] what we're made of.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Indomitable Choker of Light
|Chain of the Tolling Bell
|Pendant of Revolutionary Thought
}}

You will also receive:
*1,400 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with the [[Valiance Expedition]]

== Progress ==
Have you rallied the survivors, <name>?

== Completion ==
Thanks once again for aiding us, <name>.  The people of Farshire will always remember you.

== Notes ==
[[File:Bell Rope.jpg|thumb|The Bell Rope.]]
The bell is rung by interacting with the rope hanging from it. On foot, the rope can be reached by entering the town hall, then taking an immediate left to ascend the stairs; with a flying mount, it's quicker to simply fly up to where the bell is on the bell tower.

After ringing the bell:
:{{text|yell|[[Gamlen]]|To the town hall, everyone!  We've brought you weapons!  Arm yourselves and beat the Scourge back!}}

Completing this quest, [[Repurposed Technology]], and [[Take No Chances]] will fulfill the "To the Aid of Farshire" requirement of [[Nothing Boring About Borean]].
