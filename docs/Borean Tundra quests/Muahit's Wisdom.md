==Objectives==
Find [[Elder Muahit]] in [[Kaskala]].

==Description==
Listen, <name>. Warriors like me are replaceable. If I fall, my brothers and cousins will pick up my spear and fight.

My people cannot survive without wise elders. Stubborn Muahit, our most venerable [[shaman]], refuses to leave the altar to Tayutka in the central island. We would suffer a significant loss if he was to be slain by these monsters.

You are an outsider, maybe he'll listen to you. Show him reason... ask him to flee to the safety of [[Unu'pe]] before it's too late.

==Completion==
Ataika sent you, didn't he? I am not to be swayed.

All is not lost. The spirits are still with us.

==Notes==
Muahit can be found on the island off the coast in Kaskala, at coordinates {{coords|67.2|54.9|Borean Tundra}}.
