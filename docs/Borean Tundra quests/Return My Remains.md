==Objectives==
Deliver Farseer Grimwalker's Remains, which are resting below his spirit, to [[Spirit Talker Snarlfang]] at [[Bor'gorok Outpost]].
*[[Farseer Grimwalker's Remains]]

==Description==
<name>, now that my spirit has been freed would you do me the honor of returning my remains to Spirit Talker Snarlfang? They lay upon the ground beneath me.

I sense that the spirit talker is still at Bor'gorok Outpost to the west where last I saw her.

==Progress==
You return sooner than I expected. What did you learn?

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox| 
|Lost Marksman's Rifle
|Dry Earth Circle
|Branch of Everlasting Flame
}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}}

==Completion==
Thank you for freeing his spirit from Kaganishu and returning with his remains. We have little to reward you with, but you may take whatever catches your eye.

And now, I will return him to the living where he belongs.

==Progression==
