== Objectives ==
Return to [[Gerald Green]] in [[Farshire]].

== Description ==
The sacks of grain emanate the foul stench you've come to associate with the [[Plague of Undeath|Plague]]. This probably explains what happened to the [[Scourged Footman|footmen]] defending the mine.

You'd best bring word back to Gerald Green.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*710 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with the [[Valiance Expedition]]

== Completion ==
Those poor lads... they never had a chance!

This sure sounds like an inside job.  Probably a [[Cult of the Damned]] infiltrator.  Curse those madmen!

==Progression==
{{To the Aid of Farshire}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
