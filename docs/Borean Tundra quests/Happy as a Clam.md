==Objectives==
[[Hierophant Cenius]] at the [[D.E.H.T.A. Encampment]] in the [[Borean Tundra]] wants you to kill 10 Loot Crazed Divers.
*[[Loot Crazed Diver]] slain (10)

==Description==
To the west of us you will find [[Lake Kum'uya]]. It is, as far as we know, the only freshwater giant clam habitat in the world.

Of course [[Hemet Nesingwary|Nesingwary]]'s lackeys are now using the lake as a giant pearl farm. They must be stopped! A lesson must be taught to those that would think to endanger an entire species.

Go to Lake Kum'uya and locate the loot crazed divers. Slay them until the water runs red! Return to me when a proper example has been made!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,400 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with the [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
It is gruesome work that we do, <name>.

==Completion==
Now let us see how their nerve holds up when they see what became of their companions!

==Progression==
{{D.E.H.T.A.}}

==Patch changes==
