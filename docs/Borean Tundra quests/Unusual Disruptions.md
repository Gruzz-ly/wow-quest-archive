==Objectives==
Put down strange [[arcane]] attackers in the [[Nexus]].
*Northern disruption contained
*Southern disruption contained
*Eastern disruption contained
*[[Azuregos's Staff]] (provided)

==Description==
Of course I can help track down the missing [[blue dragon]]s. However, I have a mess on my hands that must be addressed first.

Moments ago, several bursts of arcane energy swept through the Nexus, followed by attacks of strange arcane creations.

I can create a method of tracking down the blue dragons if you can put down the locations of this wild arcana.

Take this staff--do not break it--and use it on three locations within the Nexus. Oh, and prepare yourself for a fight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q=15|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Do you need even more help? Just place the the{{sic}} staff at the disruption.

==Completion==
Well... things appear much calmer now.

I suppose I better investigate how "wide spread" these wild memories will become.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|I apologize, Lady Sindragosa. I did not realize I was in the presence of your simulacrum.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Sindragosa (simulacrum)|Sindragosa]]|I have heard much of you from [[Kalecgos]], young Azuregos.}}
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|Oh? And how did our mighty Aspect describe me?}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|I told Sindragosa you're a recluse, stubborn, and prone to cutting ties with any who slight you.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|But I trust you to aid me in being the Aspect the blue dragons deserve.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|I called for your aid in the [[Azure Span]], but you did not answer. I called for you when [[Azure Oathstone|the oathstone]] was activated, but you ignored me.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|You may never believe in me, but I need you to believe in [[Blue dragonflight|your flight]] and help us find the others who are missing.}}
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|... I will do what I can. Now, do you know what is happening here?}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Judging by the remnants here, I believe we're still seeing the after effects of putting [[Sindragosa]] and [[Malygos]]'s essences to rest.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|[[Senegos]] mentioned this was an uncommon circumstance, but it appears its effects are more wide spread than we thought.}}

Head to the Nexus bridges to find the [[Disruptive Arcana]] and place the staff there. Combinations of [[Memory of a Caster]], [[Memory of an Attacker]], [[Memory of a Defender]], [[Memory of a Torturer]], and [[Memory of a Fiend]] appear. Defeat them to fulfill the objectives and return to the dragons:
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|I've done what I can to create a method to find the other blue dragons.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|You have my thanks, Azuregos. The arcane disruptions have also calmed down for now, thanks to our friend.}}
