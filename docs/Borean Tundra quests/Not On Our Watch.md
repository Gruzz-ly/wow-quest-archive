==Objectives==
[[Hierophant Liandra]] at the [[Abandoned Reach]] in the [[Borean Tundra]] wants you to recover 12 Shipments of Animal Parts.
*[[Shipment of Animal Parts]] (12)

==Description==
Strewn across this beach, amidst the flotsam and jetsam, are crates and sacks of animal parts. It would seem that [[Hemet Nesingwary|Nesingwary]] is in cahoots with the [[Northsea Freebooters]]. Those dirty pirates are transporting the goods that Nesingwary's murderous lackeys gather offshore. No doubt they will end up in the homes and on the backs of wealthy, unscrupulous individuals across [[Azeroth]].

This won't happen. Not on our watch. Bring me all shipments that you find upon this beach. They'll never have them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,400 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with the [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
We will give those animals a proper burial.

==Completion==
A job well done, <name>. Now we strike at the pirate leader!

==Notes==
*Shipments are found in boxes and bags all along the beach. They can also be looted from [[Northsea Thug]]s.
