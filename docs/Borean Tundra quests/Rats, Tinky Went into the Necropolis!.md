==Objectives==
Find [[Tinky Wickwhistle]] inside [[Talramas]].

==Description==
I told Tinky not to go off on her own, but she just HAD to check out that crashed [[necropolis]] to the west.

I'm 100% certain that those [[Cult of the Damned|cultists]] came from inside that thing, which means I'm now 100% certain that Tinky's in trouble!

She's the airstrip's number one engineer. Without her we're doomed!

I'd find her myself, but one of those things got in a swipe on my leg before I could vanish again. <name>, if anyone can get her out, it's you!

==Completion==
Hey there! Who are you?

Bixie sent you? Excellent, let's get me out of here!
