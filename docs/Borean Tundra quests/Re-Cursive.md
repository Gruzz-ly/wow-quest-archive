'''Re-Cursive''' is a rescue mission in the Distress Call quest chain.

==Objectives==
[[Jinky Wingnut]] at [[Fizzcrank Airstrip]] has asked you to use the Re-Cursive Transmatter Injection on 6 [[Fizzcrank Mechagnome]]s.
*[[Fizzcrank Survivor|Fizzcrank Gnome]] cursed & ported (6)
*[[Re-Cursive Transmatter Injection]] (provided)

==Description==
If you listened to the old man, then you know that we have gnomes out there that were changed. [[Gearmaster Mechazod]] infected them with something that reversed the "Curse of the Flesh", and now they're robots!

We think we have a way to re-curse them back to normal. We want you to take this re-cursive transmatter injection and use it on the corpses of any mechagnomes you come across.

We're hoping that this stuff will cure them and allow us to lock onto them to port 'em out of there.

Whaddya say, <name>?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Layered Frost Hood|Rhinohide Wristwraps|Spiked Magmoth Gloves|Chilled Pauldrons}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
How many mechagnomes did you manage to re-curse, <class>?

==Completion==
You did it... it worked!

I can't believe you were able to save so many. We're fortunate to have you around here!
