==Objectives==
[[Mordle Cogspinner]] has asked you to find [[Bixie Wrenchshanker]] to the south of [[The Dens of Dying]].

==Description==
You're a proven <hero/heroine>. I have another problem!

My boss, Tinky, went east with Bixie Wrenchshanker and I CAN'T get the outgoing on this thing to work! Tinky's the only one that can fix it and we really need it working one-hundred percent.

You think you could find them? Bixie said something about following some old [[magnataur]] to a place called The Dens of Dying.

I'm guessing that's where you'll find them.

You can catch a ride out there by talking with [[Kara Thricestar]] at the runway.

==Completion==
What do you need, <class>?
