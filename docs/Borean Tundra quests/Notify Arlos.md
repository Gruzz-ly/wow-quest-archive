==Objectives==
Speak to [[General Arlos]] inside the Inner Hold at [[Valiance Keep]].

==Description==
We must notify General Arlos at once. I've known [[Captain "Lefty" Lugsail|the captain]] for a long time and, believe me, he is one of the more careful ones.

Who knows how many cultists have been smuggled into our settlements in [[Northrend]] in other ships? This could be disastrous.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*180 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with the [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Completion==
Thank you for your concern, <name>.  We were made aware of the situation not too long ago.

[[Counselor Talbot]] assures me that this was an isolated incident and not a cause for military concern.

Our civilian authorities will make sure everyone involved is properly prosecuted.
