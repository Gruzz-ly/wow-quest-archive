==Objectives==
[[Elder Atkanok]] wants you to guide the spirits of Elder Kesuk, Elder Sagani, and Elder Takret to their stone monuments.
* [[Elder Kesuk]]'s ceremony completed
* [[Elder Sagani]]'s ceremony completed
* [[Elder Takret]]'s ceremony completed

==Description==
With your help, the ancestor spirits can now be guided to their rightful homes, the statues lovingly prepared by [[Kaskala]]'s craftsmen and shaman.

The ceremonies for these ancestors were interrupted during the attack on the [[Coldrock Quarry|quarry]], and you will need to complete them. Take with you the objects that you recovered from the quarry, stand in front of the statues with the name markers, and recite this chant.

<Words in a strange language flood your head, but you have no difficulty recalling them.> 

==Rewards==

You will also receive: {{cost|10}}

==Progress==
Have you completed the ceremonies for the ancestors?

==Completion==
The ancestors have found their statues, and they have you to thank, <name>. The craftsmen of [[Kaskala]] will return to the quarry and ensure that the line of ancestors continues unbroken. For our part, the ancestors will continue to observe you with interest, as it seems your path is just beginning.

==Notes==
Head back to the three name markers used in [[The Honored Ancestors]] and use the [[Tuskarr Ritual Object (usable)]] to call forth the ancients.
