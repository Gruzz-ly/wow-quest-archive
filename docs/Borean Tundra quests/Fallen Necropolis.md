==Objectives==
Destroy 20 [[Scourge]] of any type at [[Talramas]] and the [[Festering Pools]]. Then, return to [[Sage Highmesa]] just to the south of [[The Dens of Dying]].
* Talramas Scourge Destroyed (20)

==Description==
The fallen necropolis to the west can only be assumed to still be filled with [[Scourge]].

While you are at Talramas, <class>, I would ask that you dispatch all of the [[Lich King]]'s servants that you find within and in the surrounding pools where it fell.

==Rewards==
You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Layered Frost Sandals]]
*[[Vial of Renewal]]
*[[Reinforced Caribou-Hide Chestguard]]
*[[Amberplate Waistguard]]
You will also gain:
* {{cost|4|70}}
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[The Taunka]]
* 20,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Surely you could not have dispatched so many Scourge in such a short time?

==Completion==
Thanks, <name>.

The Lich King and his Scourge are a blight upon Northrend. We must not stop until they are all truly dead, and his existence is put to an end!

==Progression==
# [[Sage Highmesa is Missing]]
# [[A Proper Death]]
# [[Stop the Plague]]<br />Fallen Necropolis - (optional)
