==Objectives==
Salvage a bottle of [[Kul Tiras]] Wine from the underwater shipwreck northeast of [[Valiance Keep]] and bring it to [[Old Man Colburn]] in the [[Valiance Keep]] inn.
* [[Kul Tiras Wine]]

==Description==
The military was all that old man Colburn had. After he retired, he still clung to it like a lifeline.

He knows the name of every general, unit, brigade, detachment... you name it. He's the man you need.

Problem is, his mind is scarred. He won't talk to anyone unless he gets his Kul Tiras wine. Takes him back to the times he was a [[marine]].

I haven't received a shipment in months. The last merchant ship out of Kul Tiras sunk northeast of here. See if you can salvage a bottle to bring Colburn.

==Progress==
<The old man looks up at you with a blank look on his face.>

==Completion==
Mmmmm... not too bitter... not too dry... it's just like the old days, with the lads at the [[barracks]].

==Notes==
Take a left out of the inn, turn north and head down the ramp, get into the water and look for the shipwreck. At {{coords|61.9|65.7|Borean Tundra}} is a [[Wine Crate]] on the seafloor.

The quest name is the English translation of the Latin phrase [[wikipedia:in vino veritas|"''in vino veritas''"]].
