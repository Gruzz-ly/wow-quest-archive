==Objectives==
[[Archmage Evanor|Lady Evanor]] has sent you to speak with [[Surristrasz]] on [[Amber Ledge]]. 

==Description==
I am aware of your recent deeds here, <name>, and again I thank you.

As for this local menace, we've learned all we need to know from them. They'll be dealt with in short order. On now to more important issues....

[[Azeroth]] needs you. The region just west of here is the center of an urgent crisis.

I'll leave the details to Lord Surristrasz. You must speak with him at once.

Good luck, friend of [[Dalaran]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|40}}
* 10,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Completion==
So, <race>, we speak again.

When you've heard my words you may wish we had not.
