==Objectives==
[[Wind Tamer Barah]] at [[Taunka'le Village]] wants you to collapse the [[Nerubian]] sinkholes using the Horn of Elemental Fury and defeat [[Lord Kryxix]].
* [[Lord Kryxix]] slain
* Nerubian tunnels collapsed
* [[The Horn of Elemental Fury]] (provided)

==Description==
I have created and bound [[Alluvius]] using the Horn of Elemental Fury. He will respond to the horn's call when you stand near the southernmost sinkhole in the [[Geyser Fields]].

The quake [[Alluvius]] will unleash should collapse the [[Nerubian]] tunnels and put an end to their flanking attack. I wouldn't be surprised if the [[Nerubian]] commander showed himself after the quake. If the collapse of the tunnels doesn't break the back of their assault, the defeat of their leader surely will.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sweltering Cuffs
|Rhinohide Gloves
|Plainhunter's Chestpiece
|Chilled Greaves}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}}

==Progress==
Have you unleashed [[Alluvius]] and destroyed the Nerubian assault?

==Completion==
Your efforts against the [[Nerubian]]s have given us a reprieve from the overwhelming [[Scourge]] assault. Thanks to your accomplishments, we can strike at the Scourge fortress to the northeast without fear of attack from the west.

As for the horn, I will safeguard it until next we need its power. [[Stormhoof]] gave his life to secure the horn and we cannot suffer its loss again.
