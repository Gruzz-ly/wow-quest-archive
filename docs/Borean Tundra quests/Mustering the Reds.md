==Objectives==
[[Keristrasza]] has asked you to bring her to [[Raelorasz]] at the [[Transitus Shield]].
* [[Augmented Arcane Prison]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Malygos]] is certainly aware that something is amiss.

I know him. His focus is fragmented. I am confident that I can lure him from the safety of his realm when he learns what has become of his precious [[Saragosa]].

Take me to Raelorasz at once, <name>. He must rouse every dragon he commands to face Malygos.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|40}}
* 10050 [[XP]] (or a {{cost|1|20}} compensation at level 80)
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Wyrmrest Accord]]

==Progress==
You have news for me, <name>?

==Completion==
Word of Keristrasza's rescue has reached my ears. You are to be commended.

I am eager to speak with her again.

==Notes==
Talk to Keristrasza again:

:{{gossip|Keristrasza, I am finished here. Please return me to the Transitus Shield.}}

... and she will teleport you right in front of Raelorasz. Don't bother moving, you'll be close enough to talk to him. On completion, Keristrasza will spawn in front of you to speak to him.

;Upon completion
:''Keristrasza spawns in between you and Raelorasz.''
:{{text|say|Keristrasza|Raelorasz, it is good to see you again.}}
:{{text|say|Raelorasz|Keristrasza! I wish that circumstances allowed for a more fitting welcome.  Fate has been kind to return you to us.}}
:{{text|say|Keristrasza|Fate, it seems, has been more than kind.  A blow has been dealt to Malygos.  When he learns of it, I am confident he will leave the safety of the [[Nexus]].}}
:{{text|say|Raelorasz|Malygos - in the open?  I hadn't dared hope for an opportunity such as this.  I'll assemble our bretheren at once!}}
:{{text|say|Keristrasza|Prepare them well, Raelorasz.  Malygos' power is like nothing they've seen.  We will likely only delay his plans with this diversion.}}
:''(Bowing)'' {{text|say|Raelorasz|Of course, my lady.  Until we meet again...}}
:{{text|say|Keristrasza|Farewell, Raelorasz.}}
:''Keristrasza walks away to the left a ways and despawns.''
