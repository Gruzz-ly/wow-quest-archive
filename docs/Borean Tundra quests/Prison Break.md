This begins the [[Amber Ledge]] questline (aside from the [[breadcrumb]] quests) which focuses on the [[blue dragonflight]] in [[Borean Tundra]]. Adventurers begin working for the [[Kirin Tor]] but transition to tasks for the [[Wyrmrest Accord]] in [[Coldarra]] in the second half of the story.

==Objectives==
[[Librarian Donathan]] on [[Amber Ledge]] wants you to collect the [[Beryl Prison Key]] from one of the [[Beryl Mage Hunter]]s at [[Beryl Point]] and use it to release a trapped [[mage]] from an arcane prison.
* [[Arcane Prisoner]]s Rescued

==Description==
Greetings, <class>. I am Donathan, a loyal representative of [[Dalaran]].

Forgive my abruptness, but we find ourselves in the midst of a crisis. Mages all across [[Azeroth]] are being abducted and I have been authorized to conscript anyone able to assist in the unraveling of this mystery.

The camp just south of ours is where our investigation begins. I call upon you to rescue one of the imprisoned mages held there. You must obtain a key from one of the mage hunters and use it to open an arcane prison. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|4|70}}
* 20,100 [[XP]]
* 250 [[reputation]] with the [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
I trust you are working diligently to rescue an imprisoned mage...

==Completion==
You have done well, <name>.

The [[Kirin Tor]] graciously accept the assistance you have rendered. Know that any service you provide us will not go unrewarded.

Please, accept this humble offering as a token of Dalaran's appreciation.

==Notes==
* This is the first required quest for "The Blue Dragonflight" portion of [[Nothing Boring About Borean]].
* Completing this quest chain provides a base total of 1420 [[Kirin Tor]] [[reputation]].<!--
