==Objectives==
[[Bloodmage Laurith]] at the [[Bloodspore Plains]] in the [[Borean Tundra]] wants you to recover 5 Bloodspore Moth Pollen.
* [[Bloodspore Moth Pollen]] (5)

==Description==
It's obvious! The bloodspore moths are the entities responsible for pollination on these plains. It must be something that happens within the moth's internal system that acts as a catalyst for this pollen to work. It's all starting to make sense now, <name>. That's why the kobolds don't kill the moths and instead go to great lengths to protect them! Those stupid little rats have it all figured out!

Well we'll just have to get our own moth pollen! What do you say? Fetch me some in the name of science?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*20,100 [[XP]] or {{Cost|g=2|s=40|}} at level 80
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
The pollen is the key!

==Completion==
A-ha!

<Laurith sprinkles the moth pollen onto the bloodspore carpels.>

Look at that!
