==Objectives==
Collect 5 Winterfin Clams and deliver them to [[Ahlurglgr]] at [[Winterfin Retreat]].
*[[Winterfin Clam]] (5)

==Description==
Now that you can speak with the Winterfin, it is time for you to let them get to know you. One of the best ways to do that is to conduct business with them.

The murlocs prize clams over any other object and their only surviving merchant is Ahlurglgr. If I were you, I'd collect a handful of Winterfin clams and give them to him as a gift.

The clams can be found all over down in the trench, as well as across it in the [[Winterfin Village|Winterfin village]] and their caverns. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
What's this? Who are you?

You're one of those <race> things! How can you speak our tongue?

==Completion==
There are for me? Is this some sort of <race> trick? No?

Well then, thank you! Come back any time that you have more clams, and we'll do business!

==Notes==
Behind Ahlurglgr are three clams; these are an excellent example of what to look for, only somewhat smaller in size.
