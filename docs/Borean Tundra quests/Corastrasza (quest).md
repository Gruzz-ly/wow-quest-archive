== Objectives ==
[[Librarian Serrah]] wants you to speak to [[Corastrasza]] in [[Coldarra]]. 

== Description ==
Greetings, <class>. Might I impose on you for a favor?

Corastrasza is the sister of [[Raelorasz]] - the red dragon in charge of our outpost here. Against his will, she has ascended to one of the upper rings of the [[Nexus]] to observe some frighteningly powerful blue drakes.

Though he will never say it, he worries about her, and would welcome any news of her well-being.

Please seek her out. Ask her to put her pride aside and send word to her brother. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|90}}  ({{cost|3|30}} at level 80

== Completion ==
It's quite presumptuous of you to interfere in the personal affairs of a dragon, don't you think, <race>?

That aside, it would be wrong of me not to let my brother know that I am well. You may tell your meddling friends that I will keep my brother abreast of my actions.

== Notes ==
* Corastrasza can be found at {{coords|29.5|24.8|Borean Tundra}}. This is the North-Eastern platform floating around the core of [[Nexus]] in the [[Band of Transmutation]]. She can only be reached by [[flying]].
* There is no [[breadcrumb]] to this quest after reaching maximum level; the other quests around it are often completed at lower levels. Players typically encounter it while traveling through Coldarra to visit the various instances of the [[Nexus]] or to complete [[Drake Hunt (daily)]].
