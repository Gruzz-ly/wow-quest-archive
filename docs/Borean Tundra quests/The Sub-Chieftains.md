==Description==
It is known that [[Gearmaster Mechazod]] has four sub-chieftains that manage the robots in the pools.

We must put an end to them!

Our longrunners and snow trackers say that if you were to turn the valves at the west point, north point, mid point and south point stations, each of his sub-chieftains would come quickly to prevent you from fouling their operations.

The stations are centered on the spinning lights in the pools surrounding the pumping station.

Hurry, <name>!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Frostbiter
|Frostspeaker Collar
|Hungering Greatstaff
|Jagged Icefist
|Shivering Healer's Cloak
}}

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|9|40}}
*25,150 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|g=3|s=3|}} at level 80)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[The Taunka]]

==Progress==
Are the sub-chieftains dealt with?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

With these odd creatures destroyed, dealing with the rest of the pools should now be a simple matter.

We owe you a debt of gratitude.

==Notes==
Look for the glowing pump valves. The [[NPC]]s will [[spawn]] after you use them.
