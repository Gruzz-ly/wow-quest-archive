==Objectives==
Kill 10 Plagued Magnataur and then return to [[Bixie Wrenchshanker]] to the south of [[The Dens of Dying]].
* [[Plagued Magnataur]] slain (10)

==Description==
Tinky and I came out here stalking some old [[magnataur]]. Apparently those caves up there are where they go to die.

Of course, we had no idea that they were going to get plagued when they went in there. We can't have plagued things just roaming about; it's not healthy.

Say, why don't you put down a number of those things while I figure out what our next step should be?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

You will also gain:
* 20,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
Doesn't look like enough of the plagued magnataur have been put down yet, <class>.

Think you could take care of a few more before coming back?

==Completion==
Nice work, but I'd grab a shower the next chance you get.

Now, let's really deal with the problem out here.
