==Objectives==
[[King Mrgl-Mrgl]] has given you a conch to use upon [[Scalder]]'s remains. Return The King's Filled Conch to him at [[Winterfin Retreat]].
* [[The King's Filled Conch]]
* [[The King's Empty Conch]] (provided)

==Description==
To help, you must learn how to speak the Winterfin dialect. We'll work with the forces of nature and magic to do that.

Take this empty conch shell. At the bottom of the watery trench below exists [[Scalder]], an [[elemental]] of [[air elemental|air]] and [[water elemental|watery]] fury.

Once she is defeated, use the conch upon her remains to capture her magical steam. Return the full conch to me, and I'll imbue my knowledge of the Winterfin tongue into you.

Luckily, a friend taught me a water breathing spell, which I will cast upon you.

==Rewards==
You will gain:
* {{cost|4|70}}
* 20100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Have you managed to fill the conch with Scalder's steam?

==Completion==
Now I will be able to use Scalder's essence to impart my understanding of the Winterfin murloc tongue to you.

Upon accepting this quest, King Mrgl-Mrgl casts a version of the [[Water Breathing]] spell upon the player.

It is not necessary to tag and/or kill Scalder; simply be near the corpse when using the conch.
