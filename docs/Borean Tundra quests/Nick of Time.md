==Objectives==
[[Midge]] in [[Valiance Keep]] wants you to go to [[Amber Ledge]] to the north and thank those there for rescuing her.

==Description==
I told them all that I remember. Why don't they believe me?

I was gathering herbs by the rift. They came from nowhere, dark wizards with magical beasts. I was surrounded!

A huge magical cube appeared above me. It opened up and pulled me inside. I swear it's true!

Just as it began to close around me, my rescuers swooped in on the backs of [[drake]]s - it was amazing! My captors scattered and I was able to escape.

I never thanked them for saving me. Please, <class>, if you see them, pass on my gratitude.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|2|40}}

==Completion==
You can tell your friend that her rescue was our pleasure, as well as our duty.

Her encounter was but a small piece in what I believe to be a large puzzle.

[[Dalaran]] is sparing no effort in solving this mystery and to be honest, we could use a little assistance...
