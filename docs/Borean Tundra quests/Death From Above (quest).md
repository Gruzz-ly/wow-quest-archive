==Objectives==
[[Sergeant Hammerhill]] wants you to use the Reinforced Net to help you slay 6 Scourged Flamespitters outside of [[Valiance Keep]].
*[[Scourged Flamespitter]] slain (6)
*[[Reinforced Net]] (provided)

==Description==
We're doing a good job of holding the front lines against these bugs. Some of these cheeky bastards, however, can fly over the aforementioned front lines and are really beating down on our inner defenses.

I've requisitioned fishing nets from our civilian ships. If you've got a good enough throwing arm, they'll help you knock the enemy out of the sky. Thin their numbers so that our defenses can hold the keep.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
You're back. Good news, hopefully?

==Completion==
We'll beat them if they come by land and we'll beat them if they come by air. If these motherless [[undead]] come by sea we're going to give them the beating of their lives.

==Progression==
