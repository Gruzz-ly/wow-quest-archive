==Objectives==
Slay [[Gammothra]] and return the Head of Gammothra to [[Primal Mighthorn]] at the [[Bloodspore Plains]] in the [[Borean Tundra]].
* [[Head of Gammothra]]
* [[Pouch of Crushed Bloodspore]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Magnataur]] live in prides, much like lions: one or two dominant males and several females along with their offspring. In the case of [[Gammoth]], the [[magnataur]] den west of here, [[Gammothra]] is the leader. It is [[Gammothra]] that controls this magnataur population and therefore it is Gammothra that must be slain to prevent any type of magnataur uprising.

Take this [[Pouch of Crushed Bloodspore]] flower to [[Gammoth]]. Use the powder from the pouch to weaken [[Gammothra]] and then slay him! Return his head to me as proof.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*20,100 [[XP]] or {{Cost|g=2|s=40|}} at level 80
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
The powder can be used to weaken all [[magnataur]]. It is why the rat men of the area guard it so closely.

==Completion==
A job well done, <name>! Would you honor Laurith and I by taking the head of the beast and presenting it to [[Hellscream]]? He will be extremely pleased.
