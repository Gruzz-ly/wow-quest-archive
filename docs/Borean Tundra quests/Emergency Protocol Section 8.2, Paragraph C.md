==Objectives==
Recover 6 Fizzcrank Pilot Insignia from the bodies of [[Fizzcrank Recon Pilot]]s and return them to [[Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle]] in the [[Scalding Pools]].
*[[Fizzcrank Pilot's Insignia]] (6)

==Description==
Injured or not, as squadron commander, I'm responsible for locating and returning the insignia of all fallen pilots under my command. In all the years I've flown with [[Fizzcrank Fullthrottle|Fizzcrank]], we've never failed to return the signet of a pilot.

My injuries make it dangerous for me to stray far from the safety of the wreckage, but perhaps you would be willing to help me recover the insignia? In the meantime, I'll make preparations to carry out my final duty as squadron commander. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|70}}
*20100 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
Did you get those insignia?

==Completion==
Thank you once again, <name>. With your help, I may yet be able to complete this mission, disastrous as it's been, and return to Fizzcrank to make my report and properly honor the dead.
