==Objectives==
Grunt Ragefist at Steeljaw's Caravan has asked you to use Ragefist's Torch to burn any combination of 10 Dead Carvan{{sic}} Guards and Workers.
* [[Dead Caravan Guard|Fallen Caravan Guard]]s & [[Dead Caravan Worker|Workers]] Torched (10)
* [[Ragefist's Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
Our fallen deserve a hero's funeral, but we cannot bury them here on sacred taunka ground.

I'll not ask you to drag their bodies back here, but take this and head further into the cemetary{{sic}}. When you come across our dead caravan guards and workers, put them to the torch.

Honor our dead, <class>! 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
I was just looking, and spotted the corpses of our fallen still out there.

Do your duty to the Horde, <class>!

==Completion==
Thank you, <class>. We are the Horde, we do not leave our dead behind!

It should never have been necessary in the first place. Steeljaw was a fool!
