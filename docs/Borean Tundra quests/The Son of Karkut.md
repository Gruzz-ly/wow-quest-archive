==Objectives==
Go east to [[Death's Stand]], just beyond [[Unu'pe]]. 

==Description==
The man you seek went far to the east, to a place near the coast called Death's Stand, beyond Unu'pe.

Be careful if you go in search of him, <name>. He bore the mark of [[Karkut]]... he who watches over the dead.

==Completion==
[[Thassarian]]? Yeah he was here... what of it? We may have more pressing problems right now, my friend.
