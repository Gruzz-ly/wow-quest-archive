*[[Crafty's Tools]]
*[[Overcharged Capacitor]]
*[[A Handful of Rocknar's Grit]]

==Description==
As you may have noticed, we created the airstrip on the southern border of a [[magnataur]] den!

<Crafty says something uncharitable about Fizzcrank under her breath.>

The old man has put me in charge of finding a... ahem... creative solution to this situation: if we don't deal with them soon, they'll come down here and tear us limb from limb!

That's where you come in. I want you to get me everything on this [[Crafty's Shopping List|shopping list]]. Please.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
Why is it that I don't believe you've collected everything on my list?

==Completion==
Alright, that's more like it! Now all we gots to do is put all this together.

Yeah, as if you're going to help me with that.

Hold your horses, this'll just take a second now that I've got my tools back!

==Notes==
*[[Crafty's Tools]] are located underneath the [[Fizzcrank Pumping Station]]
*[[Overcharged Capacitor]]s can be created by any 375+ [[Engineering|engineer]]
*[[A Handful of Rocknar's Grit]] is looted from [[Rocknar]], located just west of [[The Wailing Ziggurat]].
