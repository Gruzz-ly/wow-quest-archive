== Objectives ==
Deliver the Crate of Farshire Ore to [[Hilda Stoneforge]] in [[Valiance Keep]].
*[[Crate of Farshire Ore]] (provided)

== Description ==
That's it then. With the last of the ore you salvaged we now have enough to send to Valiance Keep.

If [[Farshire]] is wiped off the face of [[Azeroth]], then at least let us be remembered as the first ones to defend our land and the last ones to give up.

Take this ore to Hilda Stoneforge - she is a good friend of mine. Tell her to make some good weapons with this ore. We'll need plenty of them in the days to come.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*360 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with the [[Valiance Expedition]]

== Progress ==
What do you have there?

== Completion ==
Ore from Farshire?  We weren't scheduled for a shipment just yet.  Is something wrong?

==Progression==
{{To the Aid of Farshire}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
