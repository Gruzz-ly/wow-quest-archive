==Objectives==
[[Sergeant Hammerhill]] wants you to kill 6 Crypt Crawlers in the [[Sands of Nasam]] outside of [[Valiance Keep]].
* [[Crypt Crawler]] slain (6)

==Description==
Well, well, well. It's good to see [[General Arlos|Arlos]] bring out the big guns.

Don't get me wrong - our lads are doing the best they can, but someone of your renown fighting alongside them could really turn the tides for us.

I'm not sure how much longer we can hold out against these [[undead]] [[Nerubian]]s.

What do you say you get out there and kill me some creepers? Show these boys how it's done.

==Progress==
You're back. Hopefully you've put a dent in the enemy's numbers.

==Completion==
Nice job, <name>. Show the lads how it's done. The only good creeper's a dead creeper!
