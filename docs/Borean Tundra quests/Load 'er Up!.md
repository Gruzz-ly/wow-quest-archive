==Objectives==
Help [[Jenny]] make her way from the crash site to [[Fezzix Geartwist]] at [[Taunka'le Village]] without losing all her cargo.

*Return [[Jenny]] to safety without losing cargo
*[[Jenny's Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
Have you seen the [[flying machine]]s buzzing around? That's [[Gnome|gnomish]] innovation at its finest.

I've long waited to get my hands on some of their technology and a perfect opportunity has presented itself. One of their recon wings crashed in the [[Scalding Pools]], in the southwest part of the [[Geyser Fields]].

Blow this whistle near one of the crashed machines and my trusty mule, [[Jenny]] will answer. She'll follow you and carry the salvage, but you must keep her safe. She'll begin to drop the cargo if attacked.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|70|}}
*20,100 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|2|40|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Don't fail! I'm counting on you.

==Completion==
<Fezzix looks over the salvage.>

Jenny's a little roughed up, but she'll be fine. As for the salvage, it's a bit more... piecemeal than I had hoped, but I should be able to find a use for it. You're not off the hook yet, though. We're going to rebuild this baby.
