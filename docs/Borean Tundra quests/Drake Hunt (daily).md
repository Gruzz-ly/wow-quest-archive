==Objectives==
[[Raelorasz]] wants you to use the Blood-tipped Spear to subdue a [[Nexus Drake Hatchling]] and return it to him at the [[Transitus Shield]].
* Captured Nexus Drake
* [[Raelorasz's Spear]] (provided)

==Description==
I need more drake hatchlings to continue researching the runes covering their bodies.

They can be found around the northwest edge of the valley....

<Raelorasz pokes his hand with a spear and coats the tip with his blood.>

Take this and use it on one of them. Wait for it to become subdued, then bring it here to me before it expires.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|4|70}} <!-- SS shows this amount at < 80 -->
* +325 [[reputation]] with [[Wyrmrest Accord]]
* 20,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you managed to capture one of the Nexus Drakes?

==Completion==
The fate of these young drakes need not burden your conscience, <race>. Malygos alone is accountable for this.

I am working ceaselessly to discover the secrets of these runes.

Rest assured, we shall take no more lives than we must.

==Notes==
Look up, have a range indicator enabled for Raelorasz's spear as it has a rather long range. Keep the drake occupied but don't kill it in the 25 seconds it takes to subdue it.
