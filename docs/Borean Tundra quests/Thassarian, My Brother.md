==Objectives==
Look for [[William Allerton]] inside the [[Farshire Mine|Farshire mine]].

==Description==
I recently received word from William Allerton, a family friend, that my brother enlisted here in [[Valiance Keep]] on the same day he did. Thing is... my brother's been dead for years.

I sold everything I owned to come looking for [[Thassarian]], only to be stonewalled by the local bureaucracy. I've even been threatened with arrest if I keep snooping around.

I need someone in the good graces of the higher-ups... someone like you. If you can help me, I heard that William's stationed at the [[Farshire]] mine.

==Completion==
The corpse matches the description that [[Leryssa]] gave you of William Allerton. Oddly enough, there are no bite or claw marks on him.
