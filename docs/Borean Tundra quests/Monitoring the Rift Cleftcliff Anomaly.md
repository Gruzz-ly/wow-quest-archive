==Objectives==
[[Librarian Garren|Garren]] on [[Amber Ledge]] wants you to use the Arcanometer at the Cleftcliff Anomaly.
* Cleftcliff Anomaly Reading Taken
* [[Arcanometer]] (provided)

==Description==
Greetings, <race>. I am Garren of [[Dalaran]].

Not long ago, the rift was a peaceful place - geothermally speaking at least.

Recently though, earthquakes have occurred with alarming frequency and scars in the earth have appeared, exposing unique energy fields of chaotic power.

My mission here is to chart and monitor these anomalies. My instruments indicate that another has appeared on the cliff face to the southwest.

Take this device with you and use it when you locate the new disruption.

==Rewards==
You will gain:
* {{cost|3|70}}
* 15,100 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with the [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Have you taken the readings I requested, <class>?

==Completion==
Fascinating! This is the largest disruption yet.

Though the worst is yet to come, I fear.

==Notes==
The Cleftclift Anomaly is at {{coords|34.2|42.0|Borean Tundra}} in the Borean Tundra (not Coldarra), just under the second A of [[Coldarra]] when looking at the zone map. On the minimap, it appears as a purple coloured "Y".
