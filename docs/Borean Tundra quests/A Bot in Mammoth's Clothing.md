==Objectives==
[[Abner Fizzletorque]] at [[Fizzcrank Airstrip]] wants you to bring him 6 Thick Mammoth Hides.
*[[Thick Mammoth Hide]] (6)

==Description==
I've reconfigured the skeleton of an old bot to create an earthquake large enough to collapse the tunnels, but the machinery is delicate and sensitive to [[Northrend]]'s biting cold.

I've devised a means of insulating it using the thickest hides of the native mammoths. They roam the plains south of the airstrip and adjacent to the [[Geyser Fields]]. Bring back enough of the hides for me to finish the machine and then we'll be able to unleash it on the Nerubians! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|70}}
*20100 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
Bring those hides as quickly as possible! I won't be able to finish the machine without them!

==Completion==
<Abner inspects the hides, coughing at all the dust rising from them.>

Don't these animals even try to keep clean? Some of these are absolutely filthy. Well, I guess I'd better get started cleaning them. It's not like anyone's got spare time around here.
