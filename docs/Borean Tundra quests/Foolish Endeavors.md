==Objectives==
Help Getry defeat [[Varidus the Flenser]] at [[Warsong Farms Outpost|Warsong Farms]].

Report to [[Garrosh Hellscream]] should you succeed.
* [[Varidus the Flenser]] Defeated

==Description==
This is madness. How do they expect us to take on a [[Scourge]] necrolord and an unknown number of his minions?

<Getry sighs.>

If [[Shadowstalker Ickoris|Ickoris]] sent you he must think that you are capable of great feats. Perhaps you will call down a miracle today, eh?

When you're ready we will descend and face Varidus.

If we make it out of this mess in one piece, report back to Hellscream in [[Warsong Hold]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Reinforced Mendicant's Cowl
|Graven Shoveltusk Pendant
|Benign Crusader's Plate
|Ermine Ruff Cloak}}
You will also receive: {{cost|14|46}}

==Progress==
<Hellscream raises an eyebrow at you.>

What's this I hear about a Scourge necrolord?

==Completion==
And you returned victorious, just as I thought! I told [[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]] you'd be fine.

<Hellscream grunts knowingly.>

Perhaps this will show that old dog that he doesn't have all the answers, eh?

==Notes==
During the quest, you will be incapicated by Varidus who is clearly above what you or Getry could handle. However [[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]] comes from under the disguise of an [[En'kilah Necrolord]] to help you. This quest is doable simply by staying back and letting Saurfang do all the dirty work.

:Shadowstalker Gentry: This is it <Character Name>. The start and the end of the world. And your going to see it off...
:Shadowstalker Gentry: Lets Go.
:Varidus the Flenser: Is this it? Is this all the mighty Horde could muster?
:Varidus the Flenser: Pathetic
:Varidus the Flenser: I've never understood your type. The Hero...
:Varidus the Flenser: Why won't you just let go? Why do you fight the inevitable?
:Varidus the Flenser: The Lich King cannot be stopped. Accept it.
:Varidus the Flenser: This world is coming to an end. Let. It. Burn.
:Varidus the Flenser: Take him away and prepare him for reanimation.

:High Overlord Saurfang: I'll rip out your shriveled heart with my bare hands before any harm comes to <Character Name>, Necromancer.
:Varidus the Flenser: What's this now?
:High Overlord Saurfang: You were never alone, <Character Name>.
:High Overlord Saurfang: We will fight you with every fiber of our being- Until we are nothing more than dust and debris. We will fight until the end.
:Varidus the Flenser: Then you are a fool.
:High Overlord Saurfang: A fool that is about to end you, Necrolord. There will be nothing left of you for the Lich King to reanimate!
:Varidus the Flenser: You? A lone orc? Against me and...
:Varidus the Flenser yells: RISE!
After Flenser is killed-
:Shadowstalker Gentry: I... I can't believe it... Saurfang... I... I am honored... honored to have fought along side you, sir.
:Shadowstalker Gentry: You should return to Warsong hold now, friend. Hellscream will surly want to hear of what just happened here... of Saurfang...
:High Overlord Saurfang: You'll make no mention of me. Either of you!
