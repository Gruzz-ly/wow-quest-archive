==Objectives==
[[Zaza]] at the [[D.E.H.T.A. Encampment]] in the [[Borean Tundra]] wants you to use the Pile of Fake Furs to trap 8 Nesingwary Trappers.
*[[Nesingwary Trapper]] Trapped (8)
*[[Pile of Fake Furs]] (provided)

==Description==
Just south of us the [[caribou]] used to roam freely, peacefully. Then [[Hemet Nesingwary|Nesingwary]] showed up and everything changed. Now the caribou are in a perpetual state of frenzy, always in a panic. They are stalked by the hunters and trappers hidden in the field.

Nesingwary's executioners are unfit for death. They must feel the torture that they put the caribou through!

Take this pile of fake furs and lay it upon their [[Caribou Trap|caribou traps]] to the south. Watch as the hunters are caught in their own deadly traps!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,400 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with the [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Feel no pity for them, <race>.

==Completion==
You do the [[Earth Mother]]'s work, <name>, but do not revel in this victory for too long. We have discovered the hiding place of the trapper leader.

==Notes and trivia==
*South of the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment are [[Caribou Trap]]s in the open plains of the [[Borean Tundra]]. Stand on a trap and use the [[Pile of Fake Furs]] to fool a [[Nesingwary Trapper]].
*Unfit for Death is [[Unfit for Death (Scourgewar)|a common quest card]] in the ''[[Trading Card Game]]''. Its flavor text reads: ''"'Watch as the hunters are caught in their own deadly traps!' —Zaza"''
