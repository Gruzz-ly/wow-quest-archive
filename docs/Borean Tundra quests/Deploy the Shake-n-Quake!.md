==Objectives==
[[Abner Fizzletorque]] at [[Fizzcrank Airstrip]] wants you to use the Shake-n-Quake 5000 to collapse the [[Nerubian]] tunnels and defeat Lord Kryxix.
* [[Lord Kryxix]] slain
* Deploy the [[Shake-n-Quake 5000]]
* [[Shake-n-Quake 5000 Control Unit]] (provided)

==Description==
Behold, the machine that will save us from the Nerubian threat!

<Abner beams with pride as he presents the finished bot.>

Take this remote control with you, and go out to the southernmost of the Nerubian sinkholes in the [[Geyser Fields]]. Use the remote to activate the Shake-n-Quake 5000. It will do the rest on its own.

Don't be surprised if the quake it creates attracts the attention of a Nerubian leader. In fact, it would be a great opportunity to finish off the Nerubian offensive. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Sweltering Cuffs|Rhinohide Gloves|Plainhunter's Chestpiece|Chilled Greaves}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|9|40}}
*25150 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
Well, have you deployed the Shake-n-Quake 5000 yet?

==Completion==
<Abner listens eagerly as you report your success and the success of the Shake-n-Quare 5000.>

[[Fizzcrank Fullthrottle|Fizzcrank]] will be delighted to hear the news! And who knows, perhaps we'll make a mechanic of you yet!
