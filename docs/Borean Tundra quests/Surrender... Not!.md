==Objectives==
[[King Mrgl-Mrgl]] at [[Winterfin Retreat]] has asked you to bring him a Claw of [[Claximus]].
* [[Claw of Claximus]]
* [[King Mrgl-Mrgl's Spare Suit (2)]] (provided)

==Description==
The time has come to put an end to this unnatural situation, <name>. For the Winterfin murlocs to have a chance at a future, Claximus must die!

I want you to take my spare murloc suit and enter the [[Winterfin Caverns]] under the pretext of surrender. With the white flag in hand, the murlocs won't attack you.

You'll find him in the southwestern most corner of the caverns. Once you get close enough, deal with Claximus. Bring me one of his claws as proof that the grizzly deed has been done.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Lost Sea Oculus]]
* [[Soggy Hide Pauldrons]]
* [[Rusty Mesh Leggings]]
* [[Bogstrok Plate Gloves]]

You will also gain:
* {{cost|10}}
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]
* 25,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you done it, <class>? Is Claximus dead?

==Completion==
Regrettable, but necessary. I'll take the claw, <name>.

Thank you for all of the help you've given us. With Claximus defeated, maybe we'll be able to reunite the remaining murlocs and seal off those caverns.

Please, my friend, take this... it's the least I can do for all of the help you have rendered us!
