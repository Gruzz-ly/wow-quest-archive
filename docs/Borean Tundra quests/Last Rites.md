==Objectives==
Go to the [[Temple City of En'kilah]] and find the teleportation orb beneath the [[Scourge]] citadel of [[Naxxanar]]. Use it to reach the top and help [[Thassarian]] there.
*Last Rites

==Description==
I served [[Arthas]] in death, because I had no choice. He had control over my will and my body. The [[Cult of the Damned]] serves Arthas in life... willingly.

Now that we know the words of power to enter Naxxanar we can put an end to the cultist blight. Go to En'kilah and look for the teleportation orb beneath the floating citadel.

Work your way up and meet me at the top. Arm yourself with what courage you can, we might not make it out of this alive.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards:
|Borean Smasher
|Axe of Frozen Death
|Staff of the Purposeful Mendicant
|Fury of the Raging Dragon
|Fang of the Desolate Soul
|Tower of the Infinite Mind}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|15}}
*30,450 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
Hail, <name>.

==Completion==
You did well, <name>. I was hoping to leave my sister out of all of this. Thanks to you she is alive and well.

My obligations to my king and my army have been fulfilled. It is clear I'm not welcome among my comrades anymore. I will have to find my own way, fighting no wars but my own and following no orders but my heart's.

Perhaps we shall meet again, <class>.  Until then, take this as a token of my gratitude.

==Notes==
Get to the top of Naxxanar by porting up to the lower level, then going upstairs and taking the orb to the top, where Thassarian awaits.

(One should open their quest log and decide with reward they want: Thassarian will soon despawn after completing the quest, and the only way to pick your weapon is to trigger the quest and win again.  If you want to see what he says after in the quest text, quickly screenshot it and read it later, or look up this quest on Wowhead using the link below.)

: This is where the cultists' orders are coming from.  Their leader is bound to show up soon.
: Let's not miss this opportunity.

{{gossip|''Let's do this, Thassarian. It's now or never.''}}

:''The [[Image of the Lich King]] and [[Counselor Talbot]] walk up. Talbot removes his disguise and reveals himself as [[Prince Valanar]].''
:{{Text|say|Prince Valanar|My liege, the infiltration and control of the [[Alliance]] power structure by our cultists is well underway.}}
:{{Text|say|Image of the Lich King|Your progress in this region has been impressive, Blood Prince. I am pleased...}}
:{{Text|say|Prince Valanar|The power you've bestowed upon me has allowed me great mental influence over human minds. I bear these offerings as proof of my progress.}}
:''[[Leryssa]] and [[General Arlos]] appear and walk toward Valanar and the Lich King. Thassarian runs forward.''
:{{Text|yell|Thassarian|Leryssa!}}
:{{Text|yell|Thassarian|What have you done to my sister, you motherless elf scum!?}}
:{{Text|say|Image of the Lich King|Now this is a surprise, Thassarian. I hadn't heard from [[Highlord Darion Mograine|Mograine]] or the other [[death knight]]s for months. You've come to rejoin the [[Scourge]], I take it?}}
:{{Text|say|Thassarian|I would sooner slit my own throat. You will pay for what you did to your own men, Arthas... for what you did to me! I swear it.}}
:{{Text|say|Prince Valanar|Allow me to take care of the intruders, lord. I will feed their entrails to the maggots.}}
:{{Text|say|Image of the Lich King|Do not fail me, San'layn. Return to [[Icecrown]] with this fool's head or do not bother to return.}}
:{{Text|say|Prince Valanar|Yes, my lord!}}
:''The battle is joined.''

If Thassarian dies:
:{{Text|say|Prince Valanar|Pitiful... just pitiful.}}
:''Valanar and the others all despawn.''

Victory:
:{{Text|say|General Arlos|What... what happened to me?}}
:{{Text|yell|Leryssa|Thassarian, you're alive!}}
:{{Text|say|General Arlos|Ugh!  My head won't stop spinning...}}
: ''Arlos keels over.''
:{{Text|say|Thassarian|Leryssa... you... you're all right!}}
: ''Thassarian returns to the point where he had run to and kneels, and Leryssa joins him.''
:{{Text|say|Leryssa|I thought... I thought you were... dead.}}
:{{Text|say|Thassarian|I cannot return home with you just yet, Leryssa. I am not quite done with the Scourge.}}
:{{Text|say|Leryssa|Don't leave me again! You want to fight for your country, but they don't even want you! They sent you here to die!}}
:{{Text|say|Thassarian|You might be right, sister. My obligations to my land and King have been fulfilled. But there is still something that I owe to myself.}}
:{{Text|say|Leryssa|I know that look in your eye... I'm not going to be able to talk you out of this. If you die on me again...}}
:{{Text|say|Thassarian|Do not worry, Leryssa. I will come back to you when I'm done. Nothing in the world will stop me from coming home to the only family that I have left.}}
