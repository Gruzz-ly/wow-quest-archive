==Objectives==
Put 20 taunka spirits, either [[Ghostly Sage]]s or [[Risen Longrunner]]s, to rest and then report back to [[Grunt Ragefist]] at [[Steeljaw's Caravan]].
*[[Taunka]] spirits laid to rest (20)

==Description==
Force-Commander Steeljaw's idiocy caused this mess. What was he thinking taking a caravan through a taunka burial mound?

Still, what's done is done. Now it is up to us to deal with the consequences.

Overlord Bor'gorok asked me to help Longrunner Proudhoof in any way that I can. The longrunner has asked that we lay to rest the spirits of his ancestors.

What do you say, <class>? Are you <man/strong> enough to handle such a simple task?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|70}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with the [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
If you did such a good job, why is it that I can still see them out there?

==Completion==
Well done, <class>! You must have a great deal of experience fighting the undead. And, if you didn't before, you have some now.

You'll need it if you're going to survive in Northrend.
