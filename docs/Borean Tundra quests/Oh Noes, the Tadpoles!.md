==Objectives==
[[King Mrgl-Mrgl]] has asked you to rescue 20 Winterfin Tadpoles. Return to him at [[Winterfin Retreat]] once you have done so.
*[[Winterfin Tadpole]] Rescued (20)

==Description==
Oh good, you're back!

When the landslide at the village across the water exposed the caverns, a malevolent [[lobstrok]], known as [[Claximus]], came out of the caves and stole the Winterfin tadpoles away.

Something happened to all of the murlocs that followed him in there, and when they re-emerged, they were under his control.

<class>, you must swim across the waters and rescue the Winterfin tadpoles in the village and caverns.

The future of the Winterfin tribe depends upon you!

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Lobstrock Slicer]]
* [[Tidal Boon]]
* [[Sinking Pauldrons]]
* [[Shimmering Band]]

You will also gain:
* {{cost|4|70}}
* 20,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
If more tadpoles aren't rescued, it won't matter what we do: the Winterfin murlocs will cease to have any chance of a future at all!

==Completion==
No matter what happens, the Winterfin murlocs have a secure future.

You are to be commended, and rewarded, for your selflessness, <name>!

==Notes==
The tadpoles are in [[Cage (Borean Tundra)|cage]]s of a few each.  These cages can be found both on the beach and in the cave.  The cages can be opened by clicking on them, no key required.

The tadpoles will follow you around for a little while after being released.  They make cute "baby murloc" noises.

During this quest, the baby murlocs will make comments like
* Da-da? (or "Ma-ma?", as appropriate)
* Me go home?
* Play!

If released at other times, the baby murlocs will make comments like:
* Ewww!  <race>!
