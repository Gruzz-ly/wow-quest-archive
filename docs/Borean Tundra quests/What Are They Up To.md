==Objectives==
Investigate the area surrounding the [[Fizzcrank Pumping Station]]. Then, return to [[Sage Earth and Sky]] at [[Taunka'le Village]].
*Fizzcrank Pumping Station environs inspected.

==Description==
The [[gnome]]s have run into some trouble in the pools to the west. It serves them right as they have been fouling up the land with their so-called inventions.

I want you to go out to their pumping station and observe what has befallen them. Return to me after.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|4|70}}
*20,100 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|g=2|s=40|}} at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Taunka]]

==Progress==
What did you find out, <race>?

==Completion==
Troubling news indeed.

My people are leaving this place soon. We are going to break through the Scourge lines to get to our capital, [[Icemist]], in the [[Dragonblight]].

But, before we do that, we must deal with what the gnomes in their insanity have wrought.
