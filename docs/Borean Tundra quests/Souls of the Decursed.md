==Objectives==
Use The Greatmother's Soulcatcher to capture the souls of 10 Fizzcrank mechagnomes. Then, return to [[Greatmother Taiga]] at [[Taunka'le Village]] once you have done so.
*Gnome soul captured (10)
*[[The Greatmother's Soulcatcher]] (provided)

==Description==
The mechagnomes in the pools to the west are a great mystery to us. They appeared not long after the gnomes disappeared from their pumping station and its environs.

They are an unnatural danger and must be dealt with.

Take this soulcatcher and use it on the remains of the mechagnomes to capture their souls. When you return, we will set them free so that we might find out what happened.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|70|}}
*20,100 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|2|40|}} at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Taunka]]

==Progress==
How fares your progress?

==Completion==
Now we must free the souls that you have captured.

==Patch changes==
