==Objectives==
[[Jeremiah Hawning]] at [[Farshire]] wants you to destroy 5 Harvest Collectors and then use Jeremiah's Tools to rewire them.
*[[Harvest Collector]] Rewired (5)
*[[Jeremiah's Tools]] (provided)

==Description==
Ok, I've got it! The rewiring is a little complicated, but nothing a clever <class> like you can't handle.

Take my tools and put some of the harvest collectors out of commission. Once they're down use the tools to plug all the red wires into the blue sockets. That'll make them go into self-defense mode. Hurry, <name>. Before long there won't be anything left to save.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Weathered Worker Cloak
|Marshwalker Boots
|Westrift Handcovers
|Mightstone Legplates
}}

You will also receive:
*1,400 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with the [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
You done yet, <name>?

==Completion==
Nice job!  I finally feel useful again... and that's sayin' something.

==Notes==
*Completing this quest, [[Call to Arms! (quest)]], and [[Take No Chances]] will fulfill the "To the Aid of Farshire" requirement of [[Nothing Boring About Borean]].
