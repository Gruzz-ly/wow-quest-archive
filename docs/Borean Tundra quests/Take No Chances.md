==Objectives==
[[Wendy Darren]] wants you to use Wendy's Torch to burn 8 sacks of Farshire Grain.
*[[Farshire Grain]] burnt (8)
*[[Wendy's Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
I heard what you told [[Gerald Green|Gerald]] and I don't like it one bit. If [[Cult of the Damned|cultists]] managed to poison the grain in the mines with their foul [[Plague of Undeath|plague]], they could've easily done the same with the grain outside.

We don't have time to sort the good grain from the bad. We must act quickly and burn it all.

Take this torch and set fire to any sacks of grain you find out here. It would be a tragedy if we survived this attack only to succumb to the plague afterwards.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Transborean Mantle
|Floodplain Cover
|Scout's Signet Ring
|Chestguard of Salved Wounds
}}
You will also receive:
*1,400 [[XP]]
*{{cost||20}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with the [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
Have you done what I asked of you, <name>?

==Completion==
I thank you, <name>.  I would hate to see survivors of the attack on [[Farshire]] stumble upon plagued grain.

==Notes==
*Completing this quest, [[Call to Arms! (quest)]], and [[Repurposed Technology]] will fulfill the "To the Aid of Farshire" requirement of [[Nothing Boring About Borean]].

==Progression==
