==Objectives==
Scout out the key locations in [[Coldarra]].
*[[Nexus]] spire scouted
*[[Surge needle|Surge Needle]] scouted
*Nexus foundation scouted

==Description==
You should travel at once to Coldarra in [[Borean Tundra]], <name>. There, I would recommend you scout out a few key locations and report back to me.

I know the area well, and should be able to tell you how to proceed.

Make haste!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,050 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Completion==
It seems that the [[Ethereum]] has gleaned how to use [[Malygos]]' surge needles to bore deeper into the [[Twisting Nether]].

I believe we might be able to use these devices against them.

==Notes==
Low-level characters receive [[Nexus Teleport Scroll]] and still have the extra action button from the previous quest. Head directly west to Coldarra off the western coast of the Borean Tundra, where, much like in the [[Azure Dragonshrine]], the [[blue dragonflight]]'s forces have been slaughtered, with [[Seething Void]]s, [[Voidtouched Channeler]]s and [[Voidtouched Nexus-Stalker]]s replacing them. Barriers of energy are blocking the entrances into the inside of the Nexus, while [[Wrath Ember]]s are wandering around the spire's base.

Flying near the designated areas to scout them will trigger the following messages from [[Kalecgos]].

Nexus spire:
:{{text|say|Archmage Kalec|Whatever the [[ethereal]]s are up to is generating an incredible amount of [[void]] energy.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Kalec|They must be using Malygos's Surge Needles. Fly over to one and let's take a closer look.}}

Surge Needle:
:{{text|say|Archmage Kalec|The Ethereum have altered the Surge Needles. They are tapping into void energy caused by the rift.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Kalec|Their power must also be feeding the shield around the Nexus. Let us take a look at the foundation.}}

Nexus foundation:
:{{text|say|Archmage Kalec|[[Nexus Vault|The vault]] must be weakened. The energy from [[Light's Wrath|your weapon]] is breaking its way free.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Kalec|This may work to our advantage...}}

==Progression==
{{Priest artifact and class hall}}
