==Objectives==
Research [[the Gearmaster's Manual]] and return Mechazod's Head to [[Greatmother Taiga]] at [[Taunka'le Village]].
* The Gearmaster's Manual researched
*[[Mechazod's Head]]

==Description==
Clearly this [[Gearmaster Mechazod]] creature is not in his right mind. If his offer of a cure and immortality means all of us becoming robotic slaves then he must be stopped!

The winds that guide me whisper that he's atop the pumping station out in the middle of the pools to the west.

Most likely, he'll be found in the command hut on top of the structure. Go inside and research his works.

<name>, you must confront Mechazod if we are to survive!

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox|
|Taut Driftwood Bow
|Stave of the Spiritcaller
|Earthborn Greaves
|Fireborn Warhammer
|Stave of the Windborn
|}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|10||}}
*25,400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|9||}} at level 80)
*350 reputation with [[The Taunka]]

==Progress==
Is it over then? Has the threat of Gearmaster Mechazod been eliminated?

==Completion==
<The greatmother breathes a heavy sigh of relief.>

It is done then... you have saved us! If you hadn't stopped him here, then who knows how far this mistake of the gnomes would have spread?

With the threats from the blue dragons and the Nexus War, not to mention the [[Lich King]], the last thing we need is a mad creation of the [[Titans]] running loose!

Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
Read the book lying on the ground of the circular building at the top of the mechagnome/robot structure at [64,22] and [[Gearmaster Mechazod]] will appear behind you. He'll give a small speech and then you can kill him and loot his head.
