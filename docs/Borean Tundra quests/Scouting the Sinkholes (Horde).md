==Objectives==
[[Greatfather Mahan]] at [[Taunka'le Village]] wants you to use the Map of the Geyser Fields to mark the locations of the South Sinkhole, the Northwest Sinkhole, and the Northeast Sinkhole.

* Mark Location of South Sinkhole
* Mark Location of Northeast Sinkhole
* Mark Location of Northwest Sinkhole
* [[Map of the Geyser Fields]] (provided)

==Description==
Can you feel the tremors in the earth?

The [[Scourge]]'s [[nerubian]]s are on the move deep beneath the ground. They've emerged to the southwest in the Geyser Fields, and are harassing the patrols [[Chieftain Wintergale]] sent out.

<The [[taunka]] elder offers you a worn map.>

Perhaps a single person can succeed where the patrols have failed. Take this with you to the [[Geyser Fields]] and map out the locations of the Nerubian sinkholes. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}}

==Progress==
Have you marked the locations of the sinkholes?

==Completion==
<Greatfather Mahan accepts the map, but makes no move to examine it..>

We'll be able to use your information later, once we're prepared to carry out the plan.
