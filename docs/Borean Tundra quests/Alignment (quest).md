== Objectives ==
Accompany [[Kalecgos]] to the blue dragon council.

Speak to Kalecgos in [[Coldarra]] when ready.
* Witnessed Kalecgos's Ascension
* [[Branch of Nordrassil]]

== Description ==
The time of choosing has arrived, <name>.

While only members of the blue dragonflight may attend, Tarecgosa's binding makes your presence requisite.

I must ask that you take on her form and vote on her behalf.

Do not tarry. The moment of the eclipse draws near....

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|53||50}}
|Runestaff of Nordrassil}}

== Progress ==
It is done, <class>.

== Completion ==
Arygos's machinations have been undone, thanks in great part to you, <class>.

As my first act as the aspect of the blue dragonflight, your bond with Tarecgosa is now made stable.

The power that once sustained that bond I now infuse into your staff.

May the Runestaff of Nordrassil serve you well!

== Notes ==

Speak to Kalecgos to begin the event.

<poem>
''Azeroth's two moons enter [[Embrace|alignment]] above Coldarra, as the blue dragonflight gather in the skies above. Kalecgos, and the player in the form of Tarecgosa, fly to join them. Kalecgos lands on a central platform, opposite Arygos.''
{{text|say|[[Arygos]]|We gather to determine the fate of [[Blue Dragonflight|our troubled flight]].}}
{{text|say|Arygos|Our history has been wrought with great challenges.}}
{{text|say|Arygos|Our future promises even greater threats.}}
{{text|say|Arygos|These circumstances demand a powerful leader.}}
{{text|say|Arygos|I was raised at the feet of [[Malygos|my father]].}}
{{text|say|Arygos|I watched as he steered us through adversity, never flinching from difficult decisions.}}
{{text|say|Arygos|Some called my father mad. But even in his darkest hours, his vision was clear.}}
{{text|say|Arygos|He put the needs of this flight first and foremost.}}
{{text|say|Arygos|He sought to consolidate our rightful power, fortifying us for the cataclysm that he saw coming!}}
{{text|say|Arygos|Brothers, we must take what is ours! Under my leadership, this flight WILL rise again, beyond the glory of our past, onwards to an even greater destiny! I will see to it!}}
''Kalecgos steps forward and begins to speak.''
{{text|say|Kalecgos|Brothers, sisters, Arygos speaks of our troubled past. Indeed, we have suffered greatly.}}
{{text|say|Kalecgos|But I would contend that we are at least partly to blame for the scars we bear.}}
{{text|say|Kalecgos|Let us turn from our [[Nexus War|old ways]].}}
{{text|say|Kalecgos|Let us not seek to extinguish magic from [[Azeroth|the world…]].}}
{{text|say|Kalecgos|….but to use it responsibly for the benefit of Azeroth and all its inhabitants.}}
{{text|say|Kalecgos|It is true that our choice [[Northrend|here]] today will affect the destiny of our flight, and likely, the destiny of the world.}}
{{text|say|Kalecgos|May the [[Titans]] guide us. May we be inspired to choose with wisdom.}}
''Beginning with Tarecgosa, a shaft of blue light appears above each dragon in turn. Suddenly, Kalecgos is surrounded by runes as he grows in size and power, transforming into the next aspect of the blue dragonflight.''
{{text|yell|Arygos|Fools! [[Deathwing|Neltharion]] take you all!}}
''Arygos flies off to the east.''
