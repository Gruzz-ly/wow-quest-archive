== Objectives ==
[[King Mrgl-Mrgl]] has asked you to speak with [[Mrmrglmr]] at the northwest end of [[Winterfin Retreat]]. 

== Description ==
I have something embarrassing to admit: I'm being blackmailed!

Mrmrglmr agreed to clean some of my things, and got hold of my spare [[murloc]] costume. He's threatening to reveal my true nature to the other murlocs.

I need not explain to you what a disaster that would be! Besides, I have a plan that's going to require that we get that costume back.

Please, <name>, go to Mrmrglmr at the other end of the Retreat to the north and do whatever he asks of you. 

== Completion ==
Aw, so you must be the so-called King Mrgl-Mrgl's lackey. I suppose that [[night elf]] has sent you to appease me?

Good, I have just the thing that needs doing for someone as powerful as you!
