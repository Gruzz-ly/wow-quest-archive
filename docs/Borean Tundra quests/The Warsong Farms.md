==Objectives==
[[Shadowstalker Ickoris]] at [[Warsong Farms Outpost]] wants you to scout [[Warsong Granary]], [[Torp's Farm]], and [[Warsong Slaughterhouse]].
* Scout Warsong Granary
* Scout Torp's Farm
* Scout Warsong Slaughterhouse

==Description==
According to [[Shadowstalker Luther|Luther]]'s notes the [[Scourge]] is now using this place as a breeding ground for those monsters you see lumbering across the field.

<Ickoris shudders.>

Those monsters were once [[orc]]s... [[tauren]]...

We need more information before a plan can be devised. I want you to investigate three sites that are heavily trafficked by Scourge: the Warsong Granary, southwest of us, Torp's Farm, directly west of us, and the old Warsong Slaughterhouse, north of us.

Return to me once you've scouted 'em out.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|66}}

==Progress==
Have you searched the farms?

==Completion==
This is far worse than what was noted in Luther's journal. They've got this place covered in Scourge and are infecting everything they touch.

<Ickoris nods.>

It gets worse - if you can imagine such a thing...
