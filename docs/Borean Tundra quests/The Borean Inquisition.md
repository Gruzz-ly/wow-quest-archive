==Objectives==
[[Librarian Donathan|Donathan]] ordered you to offer your assistance to [[Librarian Normantis]] in the [[mage tower]] on [[Amber Ledge]]. 

==Description==
Listen closely, <name>, for there is not a moment to spare.

[[Imprisoned Beryl Sorcerer|Your prisoner]] is being prepared for interrogation here in our tower. In the event that he is less than forthcoming, your assistance may be required.

Make your way up to where he is being detained and tell Librarian Normantis that I've sent you to assist him.

==Rewards==
You will gain:
* {{cost|2|40}}
* 5050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with the [[Kirin Tor]]

==Completion==
It was wise of Donathan to send you, <class>.

As it turns out, I am in need of someone outside the [[Kirin Tor]].

==Notes==
''Nobody'' expects [[wikipedia:The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|The Borean Inquisition]]!

The title of this quest is more likely to be inspired by the real world [[wikipedia:The Spanish Inquisition|Spanish Inquisition]], than by the antics of ''Monty Python''.
