==Objectives==
Report to [[Sergeant Hammerhill]] at [[Valiance Keep]].

==Description==
It's good to have you among us, <name>. We've all heard of your past deeds.

As you know, [[Varian Wrynn|King Wrynn]] is moving great armies into [[Northrend]] to meet those of [[Arthas]]. But armies are nothing without true heroes to inspire and lead them.

I want you to be the hero for my men. Fight alongside them against the [[Scourge]] that lays siege to our stronghold.

Report to Sergeant Hammerhill outside the inner hold. Valiance Keep cannot fall. The future of our campaign depends on it.

==Completion==
By [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni's]] beard! Looks like the heavy artillery's arriving.
