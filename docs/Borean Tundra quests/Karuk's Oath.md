==Objectives==
[[Karuk]] wants you to slay 6 Skadir Raiders and 5 Skadir Longboatmen.
* [[Skadir Raider]] slain (6)
* [[Skadir Longboatsman]] slain (5)

==Description==
They call themselves the [[Kvaldir]]. My people have legends about them; we call them the tuk-hariq - walkers of the fog.

My village was destroyed by these giant mist-men. Everyone I knew was slain, including my father [[Ariut]].

By [[tuskarr]] law I must seek retribution against those who shed my kin's blood.

I am but a fisherman and I've not yet passed the first test of manhood... I cannot stand toe-to-toe with the vile Kvaldir.

If you were to carry out my blood duty for me, I will be in great debt to you.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Did you succeed, <race>? The Kvaldir are cruel warriors. Do not expect any quarter from them.

==Completion==
You've done my people a great favor, <name>. I must ask one more thing of you, however.

==Notes==
*Originally, the description said Ariuk, instead of Ariut.
