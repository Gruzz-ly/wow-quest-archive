==Objectives==
Collect 7 Gnomish Emergency Toolkits from the bodies of crashed [[Fizzcrank Recon Pilot]]s and bring them to Fezzix Geartwist at [[Taunka'le Village]].
*Provided item: [[Gnomish Emergency Toolkit]] (7)

==Description==
Rifling through the dead [[gnome]]'s possessions, you come across a small packet filled with rations, tools, and a handy roll of gnomish duct tape. The contents of these kits might prove helpful to Fezzix Geartwist when it comes time for him to reassemble the wreckage of the gnomish [[flying machine]]s.

Bringing a few of these kits to Fezzix might just be worth a nice bonus.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|70|}}
*20,100 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|2|40|}} at level 80)

==Progress==
What is it you have there?

==Completion==
Gnomish tools? For me? These should make rebuilding that flying machine even easier than I expected.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
