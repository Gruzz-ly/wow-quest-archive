==Objectives==
Deliver the Ultrasonic Screwdriver to [[Crafty Wobblesprocket]] at [[Fizzcrank Airstrip]].
* [[The Ultrasonic Screwdriver]] (provided)

==Description==
The unit you just dismantled had this inside of its mechanical innards.

It looks pretty complicated... certainly someone back at the airstrip would want to take a look at it. Maybe Crafty Wobblesprocket? 

==Progress==
Hey!

==Completion==
My screwdriver... you've found my screwdriver! I've been wondering where that thing got lost.

Hmm, you found it inside one of their robots, you say? That gives me an idea....

==Notes and trivia==
*The screwdriver can be found in any mech in the pools. It is worth the trouble to fulfill this quest as soon as you find [[The Ultrasonic Screwdriver]]. The followup quest will give you [[The Ultrasonic Screwdriver (quest item)]], a tool which is very useful for questing in this area.
*The Ultrasonic Screwdriver could be reference to the sonic screwdriver, a fictional tool in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who.
