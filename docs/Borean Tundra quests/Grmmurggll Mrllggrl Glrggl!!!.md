==Objectives==
[[Mrmrglmr]] wants you to return to him at [[Winterfin Retreat]] with Glrggl's Head.
* [[Glrggl's Head]]

==Description==
If your pathetic little eyes were any good, you'd see that we're being slaughtered by the [[orca]]s to the north in the bay!

Assuming your precious [[night elf]] king wants his spare costume back, I think you'll do me a favor and bring back the head of the king of the orcas, [[Glrggl]]: he who swims against the tides of fate—eradicating the hope of life for all those who hear the siren song of death upon the waves!

Be quick about it, <race>, Winterfin [[murloc]]s are losing their lives even as we waste time talking! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|70}}
*20,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If you don't have Glrggl's head, don't waste my time!

==Completion==
Not bad for a <race>. This will make a nice feast!

With the king of the orcas dead the attacks upon us should diminish while the whales fight amongst themselves for dominance.
