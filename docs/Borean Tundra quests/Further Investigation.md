==Objectives==
Bring the Cultist Communique to [[Vindicator Yaala]] inside the inn in [[Valiance Keep]].
*[[Cultist Communique]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm afraid this is a matter I must delegate to one of my operatives... someone who can work in secret. Keep the evidence with you and take it to Vindicator Yaala inside the inn.

Tell her I sent you and speak of this matter to no one else. We do not know who might be working for the [[Cult of the Damned|cult]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*360 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with the [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
[[Harbinger Vurenn]] sent you?

==Completion==
Speak quickly, <class>.  What information do you have on the cult?

==Progression==
{{Hiding in Plain Sight}}
