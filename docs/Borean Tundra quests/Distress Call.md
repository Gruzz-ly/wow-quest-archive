==Objectives==
Speak with [[Fizzcrank Fullthrottle]] at [[Fizzcrank Airstrip]].

==Description==
Oh good, you're <name>, right?

We need your help up north at Fizzcrank Airstrip, like yesterday! The [[magnataur]], and the [[Scourge]]... and the pumping station!

It's madness I tell you, madness!

You've got to head up there and talk to old man Fullthrottle a.s.a.p.!

==Completion==
I see that [[Airman Skyhopper|Skyhopper]] finally got around to sending help. And none too soon I might add!

Welcome, <brother/sister>, we need your help badly!
