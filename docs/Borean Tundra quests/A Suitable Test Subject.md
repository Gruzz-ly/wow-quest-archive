==Objectives==
[[Bloodmage Laurith]] at the [[Bloodspore Plains]] in the [[Borean Tundra]] has asked that you use the Pollinated Bloodspore Flower and allow her to observe the results.
*Bloodspore Flower Used
*[[Pollinated Bloodspore Flower]] (provided)

==Description==
<Laurith looks you over as if to size you up.>

So we've got this pollinated bloodspore flower and nobody to test its effects on. Say, would you perhaps be interested in rubbing this on your skin and letting me observe? What's the worst that could happen anyway?

Don't you worry, <name>! Just take this sample and rub it all over your face.

==Rewards==
*2,000 [[XP]] or {{Cost||s=24|}} at level 80
*10 [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
Don't be afraid.

==Completion==
[[Primal Mighthorn]] will be delighted! This is better than even I expected!

Perhaps it's time that I told you the truth.
