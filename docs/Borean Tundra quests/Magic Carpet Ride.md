== Objectives ==
Talk to [[Yanni]] at [[Warsong Hold]] to arrange safe travel to the coast. Speak to [[Annihilator Grek'lor]] once you arrive at [[Garrosh's Landing]]. 

== Description ==
Tanks, mon. I be talkin' bout siege machines! We got heavy tanks stationed at Garrosh's Landing on da west coast. We gonna get you to da tank and you gonna use da tank to lay down some [[Horde]] justice on da [[Scourge]]!

Da only tricky part be getting' you der. No way we be sendin' you on our wind riders. Too risky.

You see dat pixie o'er der? Dat [[blood elf|blondie elf]]? Yanni be his name, mon. He can get you to da coast, safely. Once der, talk to Annihilator Grek'lor! 

== Completion ==
NO MERCY FOR THE DEAD!

None of 'em had the guts to stay behind to defend our glorious tanks after [[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]] deemed the coast 'condemned.' It's mostly quiet here, seein' as how the Scourge are formin' up ranks to assault Warsong Hold. Sometimes I get a stray zombie or ghoul, but they don't last very long.

'Course, there's the mist...
