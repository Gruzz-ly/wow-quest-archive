== Objectives ==
[[Gerald Green]] in [[Farshire]] wants you to go into the [[Farshire Mine|mine]] to the north and find out what happened to the military detachment that was sent there.

== Description ==
There's [[Scourge]] everywhere, <class>. We've organized the farmers and miners into a militia, but this just won't cut it.

The one detachment of troops that [[Valiance Keep]] sent is defending the mine. We haven't heard from them in days!

If you really wish to help us, why don't you go to the mine and see what's going on? Maybe we can get them to send us some reinforcements.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,050 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with the [[Valiance Expedition]]

== Completion ==
Your stomach feels uneasy as you approach the grain.  The smell is nearly unbearable.

==Progression==
{{To the Aid of Farshire}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
