==Objectives==
Escort the [[Taunka'le Evacuee]]s across [[Transborea]] to [[Wartook Iceborn]] on the border of the [[Dragonblight]].
*Secure Passage to Dragonblight

==Description==
The path across Transborea, to the east, is the only way to reach the Dragonblight. Many perils await you as you make your journey across the tundra. Beware the Scourge and its influence upon the beasts of the land. Rumors have started to spread about our very own taunka brothers and sisters rising from the dead and attacking caravans on their way to the Dragonblight! Defend your caravan and get the evacuees to safety!

Wartook Iceborn waits for you across the bridge leading into the Dragonblight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*20300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|4|86|}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Taunka]]
*+250 reputation with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
It's gone. It's all gone.

==Completion==
<Wartook looks upon you grimly.>

Icemist is no more...

==Notes==
:Taunka'le Evacuee points northeast.
:Taunka'le Evacuee says: The smoke in the distance... It is Wartook. He is trying to tell us something...
:Taunka'le Evacuee expertly identifies the messages hidden within the smoke signals.
:Taunka'le Evacuee says: No... It cannot be true...
:Taunka'le Evacuee says: [[Icemist Village|Icemist]]... Not Icemist... NO!!! Come quickly, hero! Follow me!
<!-- Mother Tauranook whispers: Don't let me down again, <name>. Make sure this evacuee reaches safety. (guessing this belongs here) -->
