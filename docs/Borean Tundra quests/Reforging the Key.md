==Objectives==
[[Librarian Donathan|Donathan]] wants you to speak to [[Surristrasz]] on [[Amber Ledge]].
* [[Salrand's Broken Key]] (provided)

==Description==
Delays, delays... the one thing we cannot afford right now!

As much as I hate to disturb Lord Surristrasz, he's our only hope of saving our beloved [[Lady Evanor|Evanor]].

Bring him the key fragments and hope that his mood is favorable.

Hurry, <class>, our assault team is waiting.

==Progress==
You dare approach me, mortal?

For the sake of your unborn children, pray that your cause is worthwhile.

==Completion==
The frivolous games you play here are of no consequence....

You and your [[Kirin Tor|Dalaran allies]] pick at loose threads while the fabric of this world's future is being shredded.

Still, this may provide my [[drake]]s some needed amusement.

Show me this key....
