==Objectives==
Return to the [[Azure Archives]].
*Speak with [[Kalecgos]] within the Azure Archives.

==Description==
I have crafted a [[Dragon Locator|magical globe]] to help you find the remaining [[blue dragon]]s. It should give you their rough locations.

Now go. On top of everything else I was working on, I must now investigate these "memories" that attacked the [[Nexus]].

I shall get to the bottom of it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 5,950 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=5|Drake's Shadowflame Crest Fragment
|q2=10|Flightstones
}}

==Completion==
Hopefully [[Azuregos]] will join us later.

In the meantime, we have the whole of [[Azeroth]] to search.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Thank you again, Azuregos. Keep me informed of anything you find regarding these memories. I must focus my efforts in finding the other blue dragons.}}
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|You will be the first to know of how much of a burden you have pushed onto me.}}
:''Kalecgos enters the [[Portal to the Azure Archives]].''
:{{Text|say|[[Sindragosa (simulacrum)|Sindragosa]]|Azuregos, a word of advice if you would hear me.}}
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|Lady Sindragosa... I would be honored to hear your words.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|I know why you seclude yourself in the Nexus. You look to break the barriers of our [[Plane|realms]] to find [[Anara|the one you once loved]].}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|To bring one that belongs in another world to the world of the living.}}
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|I had hoped when the gateway to the [[Shadowlands]] opened, I would find a way... but all I have are more questions than answers.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|What you wish is impossible, Azuregos, if you continue to search for answers alone.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|Your love will turn to bitter hatred, both for the one you care for, and for the world that refused to give you the answers you seek.}}
:{{Text|say|Sindragosa|Seek aid in your fellow blue dragons. You may never find your answer, but they will help mend your heart.}}
:{{Text|say|Azuregos|Thank you, Lady Sindragosa. I shall carry your words with me for the rest of my days.}}
:''Azuregos and Sindragosa depart.''

Take the Portal and turn in to Kalecgos back in the Azure Archives.
