*[[Kaw's War Halberd]]

==Description==
You cannot defeat the being responsible for the slaughter of my kind by yourself. The mammoths of the tundra will help you!

Venture forth to the plains and find a [[Wooly Mammoth Bull|mammoth bull]]. He will allow you to mount him and control his movements and actions. Ride upon his back and find Kaw, north of here at [[Kaw's Roost]]. Together, you will be the instrument of Kaw's demise.

Destroy Kaw's armies and take from Kaw his coveted war halberd. Return to Lathorius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment should you succeed.

==Rewards==

*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
What happened?

==Completion==
<Lathorius takes the halberd from you.>

Is this what I think it is?

<Lathorius grins.>

Smashing! Outstanding! Another of Nesingwary's lackeys brought to justice!

==Notes==
Mounting a [[Wooly Mammoth Bull]] to fight Kaw is optional. If you do, the mammoth's abilities are:
#{{Abilities|Mammoth Trample|Inflicts damage on Kaw or [[Minion of Kaw|Minions of Kaw]] within 10 yards.|icon=ability mount ridingelekk grey|id=46317|cd=4 sec}}
#{{Abilities|Mammoth Charge|Charges Kaw or a minion of Kaw, inflicting normal damage plus 2647 to 2953 and stuns the opponent for 3 sec.|icon=ability warrior charge|id=46315|cd=8 sec|range=5 - 30}}
#{{Abilities|Thundering Roar|The mammoth bull trumpets a monstrous bellow, causing those in its immediate vicinity to flee.|icon=spell shadow unholyfrenzy|id=46316|cd=15 sec|notes=Does not affect Kaw.}}

When approached at Kaw's Roost, Kaw will descend from the roost, mount up on his mammoth [[Moria]], and then become attackable.
