==Objectives==
Speak with [[Garrosh Hellscream]] in [[Warsong Hold]].

==Description==
Throm-Ka, <race>! Welcome to Warsong Hold. My heart swells with pride to see that such a distinguished hero of the [[Horde]] has answered the call of duty!

This impregnable fortress is a testament to the tenacity of the Horde. Through much we have battled to establish this foothold in [[Northrend]]. It is from here that our journey to [[Icecrown]] begins and it is through the leadership of the son of [[Grom Hellscream|Hellscream]] that we will succeed!

[[Garrosh]] awaits your arrival below.

Lok'tar ogar!

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest, you will gain:

*2000 [[XP]] (or {{cost||24||}} at level 80)
*10 reputation with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Completion==
There are two versions of this quest. If you have not completed the [[Hero of the Mag'har quest chain]] in [[Nagrand]], you will be greeted by [[Garrosh Hellscream]] as follows:
<blockquote>A hero of the [[Horde]], eh?
<br><Garrosh sniffs at the air around you.>
<br>
<br>Fear...
<br>
<br><Garrosh spits.>
<br>
<br>You won't last long.</blockquote>

If you have completed the [[Hero of the Mag'har quest chain]], Hellscream will greet you like this:

<blockquote>Do not think that I have forgotten what you did for my people in [[Nagrand]], <name>. [[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]] never forgets.
<br>For that I am indebted to you and it is why I give you this chance now: run. Leave this place and never look back.
<br>
<br>Return to your home and say a prayer for the dying.</blockquote>
