==Objectives==
[[Killinger the Den Watcher]] at the [[D.E.H.T.A. Encampment]] in the [[Borean Tundra]] wants you to kill Nedar, Lord of Rhinos and his companion, "Lunchbox."
*[[Nedar, Lord of Rhinos]] slain
*[["Lunchbox"]] slain

==Description==
West of here, on the high bluffs above [[Lake Kum'uya]], roams a despicable being known as Nedar. The self proclaimed "Lord of Rhinos" hunts the wastes for the injured or young - [[rhino]]s unable to defend themselves against his cowardly attacks. To add insult to injury, Nedar has raised a rhino of his own to become his mount and bodyguard.

It is a rare thing that [[Druids for the Ethical and Humane Treatment of Animals|D.E.H.T.A.]] would ever call for the death of an animal, but Nedar's tainted rhino must be disposed of... Kill them both and return to me.
