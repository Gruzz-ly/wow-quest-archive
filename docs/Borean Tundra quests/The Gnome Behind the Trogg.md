==Objectives==
Help [[Fizzi Tinkerbow|Tinkerbow]] get the machine working.
* [[RCV Control Switch]]

==Description==
If I just attach the core of this to the input module here... Amplify the matched frequency here...

<Tinkerbow mumbles a few more things while she attaches the [[Broken Communication Device|communication device]] to the console.>

Flip the switch, Commander! Just make sure it's the right one. The left one is the self-destruct switch. Or was that reversed...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Give me just a second to trace the origin of the signal...

==Notes==

Upon interacting with the [[RCV Control Switch]] on the side of the [[Remote Conversation Visualizer]], a hologram of the [[leper gnome]] [[Telzo Sparkspanner]] appears above the device. Meanwhile, [[Herk Winklespring|Cog Captain Winklespring]] walks over next to Tinkerbow to watch the conversation.
:{{Text|say|Fizzi Tinkerbow|And three. Two. One.}}
:{{Text|say|Telzo Sparkspanner|I don't hear any more noise. I do hope that means [[Krugg the Smart|you]] smashed the intruder, you foolish brute.}}
:{{Text|say|Cog Captain Winklespring|Telzo Sparkspanner! It can't be!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Emaedi Autoblast]]|You know that ugly mug, Cog Captain?}}
:{{Text|say|Cog Captain Winklespring|He was one of [[Sicco Thermaplugg|Thermaplugg]]'s assistants. But no one has heard from him since the [[Gnomeregan]] incident.}}
:{{Text|say|Cog Captain Winklespring|Where's that signal coming from, Tinkerbow? We need to hurry!}}

Talk to Tinkerbow again to turn in.
