==Objectives==
Bring 5 Elemental Hearts to [[Wind Tamer Barah]] at [[Taunka'le Village]].
* [[Elemental Heart]] (5)

==Description==
Now that we know the exact locations of the [[nerubian]] sinkholes, we can collapse them to halt the [[Scourge]] offensive and cripple their force. Wind Tamer Barah knows a way to harness elementals to destroy the tunnels the Nerubians are using, but she will require your help.

Southeast of the village, near the coast beyond the [[Frozen Reach]], you'll find an area dominated by frozen earth elementals. The hearts of these elements are exactly what Wind Tamer Barah will need. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
Greatfather Mahan tells me you have agreed to help collapse the tunnels.

==Completion==
These should be enough to form the core of a mighty elemental, but stone alone will not give my elemental life.

==Progression==
