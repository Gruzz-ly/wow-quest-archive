==Objectives==
Speak to [[Captain "Lefty" Lugsail]] above [[the Stormbreaker]] in [[Valiance Keep]].

==Description==
This altar bears all the markings of the [[Cult of the Damned]]. It appears fanatics from the mainland have made it into [[Northrend]]. It might be prudent to notify the captain of the ship.

Perhaps he is to be found above deck.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*710 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with the [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Completion==
Cultists?  Below deck?  I ought to have my whole crew flogged!

Listen... why don't we have [[Admiral Cantlebree]] take care of this... situation?

==Notes==
*This quest can be picked up while on [[A Soldier in Need]].
