==Objectives==
[[Medic Hawthorn]], outside of [[Valiance Keep]], wants you to go inside [[the Stormbreaker]]'s hold and retrieve Hawthorn's Anti-Venom from a crate of [[First Aid Supplies]].
*[[Hawthorn's Anti-Venom]]

==Description==
You there! Please, I need your help. This soldier will succumb to the [[Crypt fiend|cryptfiends]]' venom unless we act immediately.

I've managed to slow down the poison, but without a suitable supply of antidote I cannot counteract it.

I was promised a new shipment of anti-venom in the Stormbreaker's most recent trip from the south. Go inside its hold and search for a chest of first aid supplies.

Hurry, <class>! We can't afford to lose any more men unnecessarily.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2x [[Super Rejuvenation Potion]]
*1,050 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with the [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
The anti-venom... do you have it?

==Completion==
I thank you, <name>.  This man's recovery will be slow, but we won't lose him.

What do you say?  You found [[Cult of the Damned|cultists]] inside the Stormbreaker?  You'd best notify someone... and bring some evidence.

==Notes==
*[[Cultists Among Us]] becomes available after picking up this quest.
