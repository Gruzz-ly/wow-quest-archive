==Objectives==
Seek out [[Shadowstalker Ickoris]] at the [[Warsong Farms Outpost]] west of [[Warsong Hold]].

==Description==
<Hellscream shakes his head.>

You may not have noticed that we're trying to win a war here, <race>. I need all available soldiers at the primary points of conflict. This means that we don't have any real soldiers to spare for these minor incursions.

<Hellscream pauses to think.>

If [[Shadowstalker Barthus|Barthus]] wants reinforcements at the farm...

<Hellscream claps his hands together.>

...he shall have them! Report to Barthus's assassins at the farms, west of here. Let them know that reinforcements have arrived.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|2|43}}

==Completion==
This is it? Hellscream sent a single <race> boy?

If I still had a jaw it would be on the floor right now. 

==Notes==
Shadowstalker Ickoris can be found at {{coords|38.1|52.5|Borean Tundra}}.
