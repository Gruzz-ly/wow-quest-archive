==Objectives==
Seek out [[Hierophant Liandra]] at the [[Abandoned Reach]].

==Description==
We have just gotten word from Liandra that mercenaries hired by [[Hemet Nesingwary|Nesingwary]] are moving goods off the beach and onto the main Nesingwary shipping vessel. No doubt they plan on making a fortune from their murderous trade!

She has asked that we send assistance to the Abandoned Reach, directly south of here on the beachfront of the [[Borean Tundra]].

Make haste, Liandra awaits you there!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*180 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with the [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Completion==
Cenius sent you? Well you're not a moment too soon!
