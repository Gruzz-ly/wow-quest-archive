==Objectives==
[[Abner Fizzletorque]] at [[Fizzcrank Airstrip]] wants you to use the Map of the Geyser Fields to mark the locations of the South Sinkhole, the Northwest Sinkhole, and the Northeast Sinkhole.
* Mark Location of South Sinkhole
* Mark Location of Northeast Sinkhole
* Mark Location of Northwest Sinkhole
* [[Map of the Geyser Fields]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Fizzcrank Fullthrottle|Fizzcrank]] sent out an aerial surveillance team to map the [[Nerubian]] sinkholes in the southern part of the [[Geyser Fields]], but they haven't yet returned. I can't afford to wait any longer for their information, so I'm going to need someone to check out the sinkholes on foot.

I understand the dangers involved, and I'll compensate you accordingly. Take this map with you and record the vital information about each of the sinkholes you encounter out there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|40}}
*20100 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
Have you marked the locations of the sinkholes?

==Completion==
<Abner accepts the map from you, then examines it closely.>

Great! This is all the information we need to begin the operation.
