==Objectives==
[[Raelorasz]] at the [[Transitus Shield]] wants you to obtain the Prison Casing from [[General Cerulean]] and the Energy Core from [[Warbringer Goredrak]].
*[[Energy Core]]
*[[Prison Casing]]

==Description==
You've discovered a fragment of a special prison, <name>.

[[Malygos]]' minions use similar prisons to hold their captured [[mage]]s and other arcane entities, but this prison was constructed to hold something... stronger.

In hopes that the enemy of our enemy will prove to be a friend, you must search for the prison's remaining fragments.

They are likely to be in the possession of Malygos' most trusted underlings.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|4|70}}
* 20,100 [[XP]]
* +325 [[Wyrmrest Accord]] reputation
* [[Augmented Arcane Prison]]

==Progress==
Have you discovered any other pieces to the prison?

==Completion==
<The pieces you've collected begin to glow brightly in Raelorasz' hands.>

It is done.

I sense a strong presence within this prison. Let us hope it proves to be an ally.

==Notes==
To advance the quest chain, you can back up a bit to the center of the Shield to give yourself some space, or anywhere else convenient in Coldarra and use the item to spawn [[Keristrasza]].
