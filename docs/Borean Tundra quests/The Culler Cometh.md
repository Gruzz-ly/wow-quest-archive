==Objectives==
[[Zaza]] at the [[D.E.H.T.A. Encampment]] in the [[Borean Tundra]] wants you to kill Karen the Culler.
*[[Karen "I Don't Caribou" the Culler]] slain

==Description==
Near the southern end of this bluff is where you will find the treacherous leader of the [[caribou]] trappers. She is a savage like no other, making a mockery out of the carcasses of the slain animals: drinking from their blood and howling to the moons!

Find this murderer, Karen, and end her worthless existence.

Prepare yourself properly, <name>. Karen the Culler has indulged in the riches that [[Hemet Nesingwary|Nesingwary]] has lavished upon her!

==Rewards==

You will also receive:

*+250 [[reputation]] with the [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Nature demands justice!

==Completion==
Perhaps her death will serve as an example to others that dare slay animals for sport and riches.
