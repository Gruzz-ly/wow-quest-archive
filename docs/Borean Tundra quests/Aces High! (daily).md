==Objectives==
[[Corastrasza]] on the upper ring of the [[Nexus]] in [[Coldarra]] wants you to ride her drake and kill 5 [[Scalesworn Elite]]s.
* [[Scalesworn Elite]]s Slain (5)

==Description==
Again we meet, <race>. I confess, your presence is beginning to grow on me.

Am I correct in assuming that you've come to hone your aerial combat skills?

As always, my pets stand ready to bring fiery destruction to the enemy.

Speak, and they shall be at your disposal. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|40}}
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Wyrmrest Accord]]

==Progress==
Yes, <race>?

==Completion==
I noticed some improvements today, <class>. At moments, it was as if you were one with the drake.

You are welcome to practice with my precious pets at your leisure.

==Notes==
Talk to Corastrasza to fly the drake.

:My drakes have been eagerly awaiting your return, <class>.
:Are you ready to take wing?

It should be noted that these abilities are the same abilities you will have during Phase 3 of the Malygos fight. People who plan to face Malygos would do well to add this quest to their Daily Routine.

<!-- in most cases, notes should be added to the page "Aces High!" so they get included both there and here. -->
