==Objectives==
Speak with [[Herk Winklespring|Cog Captain Winklespring]] at [[Fizzcrank Airstrip]] in [[Borean Tundra]].

==Description==
While you were in [[Gnomeregan]], we received a distress signal from Fizzcrank Airstrip in Borean Tundra. This seems like the perfect opportunity to show off what [[Gnomish Elite Aerial Rangers|G.E.A.R.]] can do!

I've sent the rest of your squad ahead. Meet them out there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh, Commander! We arrived shortly before you. The [[Fizzcrank Airman|airmen]] here just finished explaining the situation.

==Notes==

The quest will not provide you with any free transportation, so you'll have to make your way to the Borean Tundra on your own. Winklespring, [[Fizzi Tinkerbow|Tinkerbow]], [[Emaedi Autoblast|Autoblast]] are waiting on the runway outside the Fizzcrank Airstrip along with [[G.H.O.S.T.]] and two [[First Squadron Prototype]]s.

The airstrip and the neighboring [[Geyser Fields]] are in a rough situation. The [[Fizzcrank Airman|Fizzcrank Airmen]] and [[Fizzcrank Anti-Scourge Cannon|Anti-Scourge Cannons]] are busy fighting off attacking [[Ironbound Trogg]]s, while further out on the fields, Airmen, [[Scavenge-bot 004-A8|Scavenge-bots 004-A8]], and [[Sentry-bot 57-K|Sentry-bots 57-K]] skirmish with both [[Ironbound Brute]]s and [[Ironbound Scrapthrower|Scrapthrowers]] and rogue robots in the form of [[Malfunctioning Scavenge-bot]]s and [[Malfunctioning Sentry-bot|Sentry-bots]]. While most of the airstrip's normal NPCs are still present, [[Fizzcrank Fullthrottle]] himself is missing for the entirety of the questline.
