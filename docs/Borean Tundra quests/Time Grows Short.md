== Objectives ==
Collect 1000 Seething Cinders from the [[Firelands (instance)|Firelands]].
* [[Seething Cinder]] (1000)

== Description ==
[[Tarecgosa]] is bound to you, <name>, but only temporarily. An aspect's power is required to permanently seal her essence.

[[Malygos]]'s successor will not be chosen until [[Azeroth]]'s moons next eclipse, and the bond you share will not last until then.

Fortunately, there is a way to buy us the time we need. Powerful elements exist that can extend the ritual's effects. Some of these can be found in the [[Plane of Fire]], with which you've become familiar.

Obtain them, <class>, and sustain Tarecgosa until the eclipse.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|25|94}}

== Progress ==
It is good to see you again, <name>. 

== Completion ==
I sense that Tarecgosa is still with you.

You have done well, my friend. 

==Notes==
[[Seething Cinder]] drops from bosses in the Firelands raid. The amount dropped various with either 10-man or 25-man and also varies with the difficulty of the raid. 
*10 Normal: 18-23 (7-8 weeks of full clears)
*10 Heroic: 23-26 (6-7 weeks of full clears)
*25 Normal: 48-55 (3 weeks of full clears)
*25 Heroic: 55-66 (3 weeks of full clears)

In retail, players can run Normal and Heroic in the same week, reducing the time it takes to gather 1000 down to about two weeks.
