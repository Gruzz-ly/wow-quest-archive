==Objectives==
Find [[Shadowstalker Luther]] in [[Mightstone Quarry]].

==Description==
We are here by order of [[Varimathras]]! The mission of the Shadowstalkers is a simple one: spy. Well, spy with a little assassination on the side.

One of my best field agents has gone missing. I haven't heard from him in days, which has left me fearing the worst. No, not death! Death would be ideal. I fear he may have gone rogue... turned traitor even.

His last known location was northern Mightstone Quarry. He was gathering intelligence on the [[Nerubian]]s. Find him.

He better be dead... 

==Completion==
It doesn't get much deader than this... Strangely, the Nerubians did not devour the corpse.

After careful examination you see that Luther's death was self inflicted - deadly poison. Smart. Nerubians won't come near this toxic corpse.

You notice that Luther is holding a journal.

==Notes==
Shadowstalker Luther is located at {{coords|40.0|52.1|Borean Tundra}}.
