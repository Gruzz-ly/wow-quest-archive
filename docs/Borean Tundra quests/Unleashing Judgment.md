==Objectives==
Use your built up Unstable Holy Energy to destroy the [[Surge needle|Surge Needles]] in [[Coldarra]].
*East Surge Needle destroyed
*West Surge Needle destroyed
*North Surge Needle destroyed

==Description==
You have the power you need to destroy the Surge Needles.

At the location of the breaches where the Surge Needles pierce the ground, there will be a large concentration of [[void]] energy. Focus the power of [[Light's Wrath]] into these points of focused void, and the reaction should cause an overload, destroying the Surge Needle above.

You must act quickly. The [[Ethereum]] likely won't sit idly by as you lay waste to their machinations.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,050 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Completion==
[[Azuregos]]!

He must have returned to the [[Nexus]] to secure the artifacts in [[Nexus Vault|the vault]]. [[Malygos]] always trusted him to watch over the magical items in the care of [[Blue dragonflight|the flight]].

I'm afraid I must ask another favor of you, <name>.

==Notes==
To destroy the surge needles, simply follow [[Kalecgos]]' instructions and channel your holy energy into the points of "Focused Void" below the three surge needles after killing the [[Voidtouched Channeler]]s standing around the void energy. This will cause the needle above to shatter, though the pieces continue to float in mid-air.

After destroying all three needles, the following occurs:

:{{text|say|Azuregos|What little mind is this I sense, that has freed my consciousness from the [[ethereal]]s' trap?}}
