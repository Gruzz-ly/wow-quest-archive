== Objectives ==
Find Leviroth in the waters below [[Riplash Ruins]]. Use the Trident of Naz'jan to slay him and return to [[Karuk]] to the north of [[Riplash Strand]].
*[[Leviroth]] slain
*[[Trident of Naz'jan]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Raj Naz'jan]] was the emperor of Riplash when [[Leviroth]] was imprisoned. [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] herself blessed his trident so it would slay the beast should it ever escape.

Now you wield it, <race>. As much as it disgusts me, I will have my revenge on these barbaric giant-men.

Take the trident to the depths beneath Riplash. You will find Leviroth slumbering at the bottom of the sea. Drive the trident deep into his flesh! Return to whomever sent you when you're done; I wish to see no more of you.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Iceflow Wristwraps|Whalehunter Gloves|Sharkproof Coif|Seabone Legplates}}

==Progress==
Have you solved the mystery, <name>? Will my people's spirits be laid to rest?

==Completion==
My people's spirits can rest in peace. You've helped me honor [[Ariut|my father]]... perhaps one day I will be as strong as you are.

==Notes==
Use the Trident of Naz'jan before you start the battle (i.e. [[aggro]]). Leviroth is a 72 elite, but the trident drops him down to ~6% health.
