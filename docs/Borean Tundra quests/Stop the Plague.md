==Objectives==
[[Sage Highmesa]], standing just south of [[The Dens of Dying]], has asked you to use Highmesa's Cleansing Seeds at a [[Den of Dying Plague Cauldron]] to neutralize it.
*Plague Cauldron Neutralized
*[[Highmesa's Cleansing Seeds]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm convinced that the plague is being caused by something in the caves up there.

<class>, I want you to take these seeds. I normally use them as a ward against the Scourge, though perhaps they can be used to disrupt whatever foulness is happening in the dens.

Find the source of the plague and throw them into it.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sweltering Handwraps
|Rhinohide Mask
|Plainhunter's Waistband
|Chilled Shoulderplates
}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|70|}}
*20,100 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|2|40|}} at level 80)
*250 reputation with [[The Taunka]]

==Progress==
Either cave should do, <class>. Quickly, use the seeds to end the plague!

==Completion==
<The sage hangs her head and sighs in relief.>

This is a good start. If only that were our only problem.

==Progression==
# [[Sage Highmesa is Missing]]
# [[A Proper Death]]
# Stop the Plague<br />[[Fallen Necropolis]] - (optional)
