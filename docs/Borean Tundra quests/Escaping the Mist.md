== Objectives ==
Follow [[Mootoo the Younger]] out of the mist. Speak to [[Elder Mootoo]] should you successfully save [[Mootoo the Younger]].

*Mootoo Saved

== Description ==
I can hear the mist creatures outside. Their yells are driving me mad, but I dare not try to escape. And where would I even go? How long would it be until they caught up with me and executed me like the others?

I wonder, how far has the mist crept, stranger? Has it overtaken this whole continent?

Would you be willing to help me try and escape the mist? I think I can lead us back toward my father. I still sense his life spirit. He is close. 

== Rewards ==

==Progress==
You found my daughter?

== Completion ==
