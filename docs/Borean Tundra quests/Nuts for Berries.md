==Objectives==
[[Librarian Serrah]] in the [[Transitus Shield]] wants you to gather 10 Frostberries from the [[Frostberry Bush]]es in [[Coldarra]].
* [[Frostberry]] (10)

==Description==
Oh! What a relief it is to see a fresh face. I was beginning to feel we had been forsaken.

Our supply lines were cut off days ago, and things have been looking - well, bleak. To be honest, this was a suicide mission to begin with if you ask me.

Maybe I'm simply not cut out for all of this violence - to say nothing of the bitter cold! I'd much rather be back in [[Dalaran]] studying ancient texts.

To the point, our food supply is nearly spent. Please, gather what you can and bring it to me. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
Have you been able to find any food?

==Completion==
Well, it's not much, but it should keep us alive for another day.

I believe you'll find this to be a fair price for your efforts.
