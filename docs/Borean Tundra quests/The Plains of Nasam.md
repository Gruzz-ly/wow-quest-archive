==Objectives==
Use the [[Horde Siege Tank]] to destroy 100 Scourge Soldiers and rescue 3 Injured Warsong Soldiers on the Plains of Nasam. You must also discover the identity of the leader of the Scourge assault.

Report to Garrosh Hellscream at Warsong Hold should you succeed.

*Scourge Unit Obliterated (100)
*Injured Warsong Soldier Rescued (3)
*[[Kel'Thuzad|Scourge Leader]] Identified

==Description==
Once you're ready, jump into one of the tanks and drive it out to the [[Plains of Nasam]], southeast of here.

Use the tank's weapon arsenal to take down the Scourge army. If you get in a jam, the "Meatpounder" will tear 'em up and the land mines will finish 'em off! If you find any of our soldiers, grab 'em! One last thing, fuel tanks can be found all over the field.

Try to get close enough to that structure in the center and see what's going on.

If you do all of this and live, go to Hellscream! 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Grek'lor's Loungewear
|Warsong Scout Spaulders
|Tank Commander's Treads
|Grek'lor's Breastplate of Bloodrage}}

==Progress==
Well? What happened?

==Completion==
[[Kel'Thuzad]]? So it's true - [[Naxxramas]] returns...

Perhaps I underestimated you, <name>. You've done the Horde a great service. The [[Thrall|Warchief]] would be proud!

<Garrosh pauses to think.>

If Kel'Thuzad is controlling these Scourge, there's no telling what else the Lich King has in store for us... I'll need time to think through this new information, <name>. You are dismissed.

== Notes ==
See the notes on [[Horde Siege Tank]].  Each wounded soldier improves the abilities of your tank.  Also, oil barrels around the field can be run over to replenish mana.
