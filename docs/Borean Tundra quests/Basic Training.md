==Objectives==
[[Raelorasz]] at the [[Transitus Shield]] wants you to slay 10 Coldarra Spellweavers.
* [[Coldarra Spellweaver]] slain (10)

==Description==
This is war, mortal, and we are the tip of the spear.

Your little spats over land or currency pale in comparison to this conflict. We face the [[Dragon Aspect|aspect]] [[Malygos]] and his entire [[blue dragonflight]]. All you need to know is that if he is victorious, this world shall be no more.

We are but few here, and we fly against many. Our deaths are all but a certainty, and our ultimate success lies in merely delaying our enemy.

Go now. Busy yourself while I decide what to do with you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|4|70}}
* +250 [[reputation]] with the [[Wyrmrest Accord]]
* 20,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you acquainted yourself with our enemy, <class>?

==Completion==
Alright, <class>, now that you've become familiar with the enemy it's time for you to get to work.
