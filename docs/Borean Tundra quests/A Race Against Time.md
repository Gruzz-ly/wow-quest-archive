==Objectives==
[[Librarian Donathan|Donathan]] on [[Amber Ledge]] has tasked you with using the Beryl Shield Detonator to bring down the shield at [[Beryl Point]]. You are then to defeat [[Inquisitor Salrand|Salrand]] and collect the key she holds.
*[[Salrand's Broken Key]]
*[[Beryl Shield Detonator]] (provided)

==Description==
So it's true. They have her.

It's clear what must be done, <race>. She WILL be saved.

I must remain here and aid in the rescue preparations. I call upon you again; this time to collect the prison key. All we know of this Salrand figure is that she cannot be harmed so long as her shield is intact.

We've customized a special explosive that should strip her of this protection, allowing you to perform your duty. Return to me when you've collected the key.

Hurry, <name>. [[Lady Evanor]] is suffering!

==Rewards==
You will gain:
* {{cost|4|70}}
* 20,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Have you collected Salrand's key?

==Completion==
Broken?

Let me have a look....
