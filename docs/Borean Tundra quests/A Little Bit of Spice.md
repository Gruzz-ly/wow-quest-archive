==Objectives==
[[Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle]] in the [[Scalding Pools]] wants you to gather 4 Gorloc Spice Pouches.
*[[Gorloc Spice Pouch]] (4)

==Description==
The [[Oil-stained Wolf|wolves]] have been pawing through the wreckage ever since the crash and I'm afraid they consumed the microfilm from our mission in the process.

I have a plan to recover that microfilm, but I need your help to make it work.

To the south and east, in the [[Flood Plains]], live creatures called [[gorloc]]s. They prepare their foods with noxious spices, which would sicken any other creature. If you can gather enough of the spice pouches from [[Gorloc Steam Belcher|gorloc steam belchers]] or [[Gorloc Waddler|gorloc waddlers]], I can make the wolf bait.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|70}}
*20100 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
Do you have those spice pouches?

==Completion==
<Iggy holds his nose as he empties the spice pouches and addresses you in a nasal voice.>

Now that we have what we need, I'll combine it with my emergency rations to create a bait for the wolves.
