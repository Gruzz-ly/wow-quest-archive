==Objectives==
Speak with [[Sage Earth and Sky]] at [[Taunka'le Village]].

==Description==
<Race>, the chieftain is making me wait... time that Taunka'le does not have!

There has been talk of your prowess. Rather than wait for [[Garrosh]] to send help, I ask you to go and help my people.

Taunka'le village lies far to the northeast. Follow the road east out of the hold, turning north at the intersection. Not long after, you will come to another intersection. Follow the path east, passing south and then east of the great pools along the flood plains.

Speak with Sage Earth and Sky when you arrive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2000 XP
*+10 reputation with [[The Taunka]]

==Completion==
It does not surprise me that the orc chieftain does not have time to hear of our troubles. The ambassador's efforts will likely be like so much mist blowing in the wind.

But you are here now. We shall see if he chose well in sending you.
