==Objectives==
Destroy 20 [[Scourge]] of any type at [[Talramas]] and the [[Festering Pools]]. Then, return to [[Bixie Wrenchshanker]] just to the south of [[The Dens of Dying]].
* Talramas Scourge Destroyed (20)

==Description==
If the [[Cult of the Damned|cultists]] up in those caves survived the crash, then that fallen [[necropolis]] to the west can only be assumed to still be filled with Scourge. There're probably lots of them out in front of it in the pools, too!

While you're at Talramas, <class>, do you think you could dispatch all of the [[Lich King]]'s flunkies that you find there?

==Rewards==
You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Layered Frost Sandals]]
*[[Vial of Renewal]]
*[[Reinforced Caribou-Hide Chestguard]]
*[[Amberplate Waistguard]]
You will also gain:
* {{cost|4|70}}
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]
* 20,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There's no way that you could have killed so many Scourge in such a short time!

==Completion==
Thanks, <name>.

The Lich King and his Scourge are really scary, but we can't stop until they are all lying in new graves!
