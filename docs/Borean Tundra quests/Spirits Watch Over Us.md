==Objectives==
[[Elder Muahit]] at [[Njord's Breath Bay]] wants you to find [[Iruk]]'s corpse in the water and retrieve Issliruk's Totem.
*[[Issliruk's Totem]]

==Description==
Powerful spirits watch over my tribe — [[Kaskala]] will not be lost.

[[Issliruk]] will give us courage. [[Tayutka]] will make sure our survivors will have food and shelter and [[Karkut]] will watch over the fallen so they do not lose their way.

Issliruk's guidance is the one we need the most right now. I asked my nephew, Iruk, to bring me Issliruk's totem, but the [[kvaldir]]'s spears struck him down and his body fell into the waters to the north. Bring me the totem, <name>. Don't let my nephew's death be in vain.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3|90}}

==Progress==
The totem, <race>. Do you have it?

==Completion==
Can you feel Issliruk's presence, <name>? He does not want his children to perish at the hand of the mist-walkers.

==Notes==
[[Iruk]] is located due north of [[Elder Muahit]]'s position, in the bay halfway between the island in the mainland, about 20 yards down, at coordinates {{coords|67.6|50.4|Borean Tundra}}.

On completion, the area briefly sees a light snowfall, and the [[Spirit of Issliruk]] appears and flies around the statue before flying off and disappearing.
