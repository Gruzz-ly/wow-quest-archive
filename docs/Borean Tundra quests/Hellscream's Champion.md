== Objectives ==
Seek out [[Chieftain Wintergale]] at [[Taunka'le Village]]. 

== Description ==
You have faced all challenges that have been set before you and squashed them beneath your boot heel. It is because of you, <name>, that the Horde is now firmly entrenched in [[Northrend]].

But our work has only just begun. We must march to [[Icecrown]] and we must tear down its walls!

Your next assignment begins to the east, at [[Taunka'le Village]]. Our [[taunka]] allies are in dire straits and require aid. Secure transport from the stable master, [[Durkot Wolfbrother]], and seek out Chieftain Wintergale at Taunka'le. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Borean Smasher 	
|Axe of Frozen Death
|Staff of the Purposeful Mendicant 	
|Fury of the Raging Dragon
|Fang of the Desolate Soul 	
|Tower of the Infinite Mind
}}
You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}}

== Completion ==
I fear that you may be too late, champion. Many of my brothers and sisters have already abandoned Taunka'le, seeking shelter in the Dragonblight, far to the east.

There is much work left to be done here and few willing to lend us their strength...
