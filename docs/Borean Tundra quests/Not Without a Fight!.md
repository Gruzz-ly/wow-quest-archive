==Objectives==
[[Ataika]] wants you to slay 12 Kvaldir Raiders in [[Kaskala]].
*[[Kvaldir Raider]] slain (12)

==Description==
Kaskala is a sacred place for us, <race>. Our ancestors were guided here by the spirit of [[Tayutka]] herself.

Now these foul creatures attack us from the mists without any provocation.

We will show them that our spears are not merely for whaling. Fight alongside us, friend. Perhaps my people might repay you some time in the future.

==Progress==
We are fighting tooth and nail, <name>. We'll not give these Kvaldir an inch without making them pay for it dearly.

==Completion==
I thank you, <name>. I will be deeply in your debt if we ever make it out of here alive.
