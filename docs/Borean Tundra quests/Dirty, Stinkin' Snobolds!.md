What's a snobold you ask? It's like a [[kobold]], 'cept they serve the [[magnataur]]; kinda take care of them. I know, weird!

Anywho, wanna help me out? I know the little creeps stole off with all of my stuff. Stupid me thinkin' that it'd be nice and safe, packed up on the north side of the airstrip.

Why don'tcha do me a favor and head north to their stupid [[Magmoth]]. There's a cash reward if you bring all my stuff back quick!
