==Objectives==
[[Librarian Normantis]] on [[Amber Ledge]] wants you to use the Neural Needler on the [[Imprisoned Beryl Sorcerer]] until he reveals the location of [[Lady Evanor]].
* Prisoner Interrogated
* [[Neural Needler]] (provided)

==Description==
It is fortunate you're here, <race>.

You see, the [[Kirin Tor]] code of conduct frowns upon our taking certain 'extreme' measures - even in desperate times such as these.

You, however, as an outsider, are not bound by such restrictions and could take any steps necessary in the retrieval of information.

Do what you must. We need to know where Lady Evanor is being held at once!

I'll just busy myself organizing these shelves here. Oh, and here, perhaps you'll find this old thing useful....

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|70}}
*15,100 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Well, do you know where Lady Evanor is being held?

==Completion==
Excellent! It was crucial that we collect that intelligence.

Well done, friend.

==Notes==
When using the needler each time, the sorcerer whispers the following:
: {{text|whisper|Pathetic fool! A servant of [[Malygos]] would sooner die than aid an enemy....}}

: {{text|whisper|Aargh! Do your worst, <class>! I'll tell you NOTHING!}}

: {{text|whisper|Aahhhh! Release me! I am of no use to you. I swear it!}}

: {{text|whisper|Stop! I beg you, please stop. Please....}}

: {{text|whisper|Alright! I am beaten. Your precious archmage is held in a prison, elevated and sealed. Even if you manage to reach her, [[Inquisitor Salrand|Salrand]] herself holds the key. Your mission is folly!}}

''At this point, you achieve the objective of Prisoner Interrogated. You still hold the Neural Needler, though, and are able to continue.''
* {{text|whisper|Enough! I've told you all that I know. Your continued abuse is senseless!}}
* {{text|whisper|I've given you the information, <race>!  You're wasting your time....}}
* {{text|whisper|You aren't even asking me questions!}}
* {{text|whisper|You have a darkness in you, <race>.}}
* {{text|whisper|You have shown me the face of true evil, <name>.}}
* {{text|whisper|Noooo!  This torture is inhumane!  You have what you want... why don't you just kill me?}}

This quest, wherein you torture someone for information, is noteworthy for its relevance to real-world events and morality.  A reaction to it - on game design merits, rather than morality issues - by [[wikipedia:Richard Bartle|Richard Bartle]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20081205122915/http://www.youhaventlived.com/qblog/2008/QBlog191108A.html here], with replies found [http://www.youhaventlived.com/qblog/2008/QBlog261108A.html here]) gained significant publication (on [https://web.archive.org/web/20081210004341/http://www.boingboing.net/2008/12/08/torture-in-videogame.html sites] [https://web.archive.org/web/20081216083726/https://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/commentary/games/2008/12/gamesfrontiers_1215 like] [https://web.archive.org/web/20081211012616/https://www.destructoid.com/torture-in-wow-lich-king-quest-causes-controversy-for-old-school-game-dev-114125.phtml these]). The game design points raised seem largely to have been overshadowed by the reaction to the torture elements of the quest - the very shock Mr Bartle was thinking of when he first commented.

The whole premise is that the librarian character won't torture someone because of the morals of his group, but you (the character... or the player) can. In fact, to complete the quest series, you have to.
