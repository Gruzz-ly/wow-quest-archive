==Objectives==
Empower the [[Runestaff of Nordrassil]] with 250 Soul Flame Essences / Smouldering Essences and obtain the Heart of Flame.
* Smouldering Essences Collected (250)
* [[Heart of Flame]]

==Description==
You are the first mortal to witness a dragon council, <name>, and among the only beings in [[Azeroth]] to take part in the choosing of an [[Dragon Aspect|Aspect]].

My ascension has endowed me with incredible power. I have taken the liberty to strengthen [[Tarecgosa]]'s bond with you, though she will require a more... permanent home.

I would have you venture one last time into the [[Plane of Fire]] and bring me the heart of [[Ragnaros]].

When next we meet, I will be able to suitably thank you for all that you have done.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|53||50}}

==Progress==
A fine day for a ceremony. Don't you think, <name>? 

==Completion==
You have done well, <name>.

Now prepare to receive a hero's reward. 

== Notes ==
Smouldering Essence can be obtained by using the [[Runestaff of Nordrassil]] targeting the corpse of a Firelands boss. This can be only obtained when the player is on this quest. All bosses except Ragnaros will provide the following number of essences:

*10 normal: 3-5 (full clear average: 24)
*10 heroic: 7-8 (full clear average: 45)
*25 normal: 7-8 (full clear average: 45)
*25 heroic: 9-11 (full clear average: 60)

A [[Heart of Flame]] object appears where Ragnaros spawns once he is defeated, but only after the player has fulfilled the essence requirement.

At some point during the quest, you will receive the following emote:
:{{text|emote|You feel a surge of power as Tarecgosa's essence manifests itself.}}

Interacting with [[Hallegosa]], she has the following gossip
{{dialogue|
Your deeds shall live on forever in the memories of every blue dragon, <name>.
}}

{{Your Time Has Come}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Hotfix|date=2011-09-08|bluenote=
**The number of Smouldering Essences that can be collected from a single boss in 25-person Firelands on Heroic difficulty has been reduced.
**The number of Smouldering Essences that can be collected from a single boss in 10-person Firelands on normal mode has been increased.}}
* {{Hotfix|date=2011-08-04|bluenote=
**Smoldering Essences are now properly applied to Firelands bosses and can be syphoned, even if the only raid member that is on step 13 of the legendary quest line dies during the encounter.
**Players should never get Rage of Ragnaros on Heroic difficulty. Rage of Ragnaros will only be given on normal difficulty if someone on the legendary quest line has 250 shards. [[Heart of Flame]] should always be given on Heroic difficulty, even if a player doesn't have Rage of Ragnaros, but does have 250 shards.}}
*{{Patch 4.2.0|note=Added.}}
