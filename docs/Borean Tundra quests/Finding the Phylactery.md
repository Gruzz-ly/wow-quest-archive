==Objectives==
Go to [[Death's Stand]] and ride [[Dusk]] to the location of [[Tanathal]]'s Phylactery. Obtain it and bring it back to [[Thassarian]] inside [[the Wailing Ziggurat]].
*[[Tanathal's Phylactery]]

==Description==
No time for small talk, <name>. I was on what was to be a suicide mission to take this [[ziggurat]]. I've accomplished my duty as a soldier, now is the time to get some answers.

This [[lich]] has knowledge I seek, yet I cannot inflict pain to his physical body to obtain that knowledge.

The lich stored his soul in a [[phylactery]], and while it remains hidden, I won't be able to pry the information from him.

Return to the camp and take my horse, Dusk, she will lead you to the phylactery. Bring it to me.

==Progress==
You're back, <name>. Did you get the phylactery?

==Completion==
Just in time, <name>. Pinning down a lich is not as easy as it looks.

==Notes==
[[Dusk]] will take you to the [[Frozen Phylactery]].
