==Objectives==
Reclaim the Lower Horn Half and Upper Horn Half from [[Chieftain Burblegobble|Chieftain Burblegoggle]]{{sic}} and [[Chieftain Gurgleboggle]] and bring them to [[Wind Tamer Barah]] in [[Taunka'le Village]].
*[[Upper Horn Half]]
*[[Lower Horn Half]]
*[[The Legend of the Horn]] (provided)

==Description==
I can fashion the likeness of an elemental from these pieces of inanimate stone, but breathing life into it is different. For that we'll need help and a bit of luck.

Legend tells of an ancient artifact called the Horn of Elemental Fury, sought after by a great hero. I'll lend you a [[The Legend of the Horn|scroll]] with a copy of the tale. I don't know if the legend is true, but it's our best bet. If the legend is right, the parts of the horn may be in the [[Flood Plains]] surrounding [[Taunka'le Village|the village]] to the north and southwest.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

==Progress==
Were you able to find the horn? Was the legend true?

==Completion==
<Barah Accepts the pieces of the horn from you and begin trying to fit them together.>

Stormhoof would be proud of you, <name>. Perhaps when we've dealt with the Scourge, I will take the horn with me on a pilgrimage to Stormhoof's tomb.
