== Objectives ==
[[Overlord Razgor]] at [[Warsong Hold]] wants you to kill 15 [[Nerub'ar (Northrend)|Nerub'ar Nerubian]]s.
* Nerub'ar slain (15)

== Description ==
While Warsong is protected by 10 feet of steel and stone on all sides, this [[Mightstone Quarry|quarry]] is soft and primed for attacks by the Nerubians.

<Razgor points west.>

Beyond this quarry stand thousands of [[Scourge]], awaiting orders to attack. Should the Nerubians take down our inner defenses, we will be overrun by the undead legions of [[Arthas]].

We can't let that happen - which is why you're going on the offensive and slaughtering the Nerubians in the quarry.

Blood and thunder, soldier! Take 'em both with you. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
We didn't build on the Nerubian tunnel system, those monsters tunneled to us!

== Completion ==
You've slowed them down, but more are sure to join the fight. Were you able to locate any of their egg sacs while in the quarry?
