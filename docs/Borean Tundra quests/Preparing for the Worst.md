==Objectives==
[[Utaik]] wants you to gather 8 Kaskala Supplies in [[Kaskala]].
*[[Kaskala Supplies]] (8)

==Description==
Dark times are upon us. Karkut's spirit walks the earth and gathers the spirits of dead [[tuskarr]].

The sons of the mist have taken many of our brethren. Soon dear Kaskala will be reduced to ashes.

There is hope yet. Not for us, perhaps, but we've sent our families to [[Unu'pe]]. Salvage any supplies before it's too late for our families.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

At level 80 you will receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
Have you succeeded, <name>? Our relatives in Unu'pe are depending on your efforts.

==Completion==
I thank you, <name>. These supplies will feed our cousins and children. Even if we get wiped out.

==Notes==
*The supplies are square wicker baskets that are found around or inside the buildings just south of [[Utaik]].
*There is also a small cache of supplies (4 nodes) a bit to the east of the village along the coast by some whalebones that are rarely picked up by players.

==Progression==
{{:Not Without a Fight!}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
