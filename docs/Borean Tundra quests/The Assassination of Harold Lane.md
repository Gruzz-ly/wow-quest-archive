'''The Assassination of Harold Lane''' is the final quest in the [[Druids for the Ethical and Humane Treatment of Animals|D.E.H.T.A.]] chain. It becomes available after the quests to kill [[Clam Master K]], [[Kaw the Mammoth Destroyer]], [[Karen "I Don't Caribou" the Culler]], and [[Nedar, Lord of Rhinos]] are all completed.

==Objectives==
[[Archdruid Lathorius|Arch Druid Lathorius]] at the [[D.E.H.T.A. Encampment]] in the [[Borean Tundra]] wants you to kill Harold Lane.
*[[Harold Lane]] slain
*[[Cenarion Horn]] (provided)

==Description==
You have done much for the animals of the Borean Tundra, <name>. [[Hemet Nesingwary|Nesingwary]]'s lackeys have been beaten back and taught a lesson that they will not soon forget.

Harold Lane, the primary agent responsible for the mass slaughters in [[Nagrand]], has been identified as the man in charge of Nesingwary operations in the tundra. He is stationed at [[Lake Kum'uya]], west of here.

<Lathorius hands you an intricately carved oak horn.>

Find Lane and kill him. Use this horn should you require our aid.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Band of Wholesome Preservation
|Ring of Indignant Rage
|Activist's Signet of Blasting
}}

You will also receive:
*2,150 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with the [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Is the Borean Butcher slain?

==Completion==
Alas, Nesingwary is gone. Perhaps he was never here to begin with...

<Lathorius sighs.>

The demon is a slippery one, but his days are numbered. We will find him and when we do...

==Notes==
*If [[Ears of Our Enemies]] has been completed, the blue question mark for [[Can't Get Ear-nough...]] will override the yellow exclamation mark for this quest. In that case, the only way to see if this quest is available is to talk to [[Archdruid Lathorius]].
*Completing this quest will reward [[D.E.H.T.A's Little P.I.T.A.]] and fulfill the "D.E.H.T.A." requirement of [[Nothing Boring About Borean]].

==Progression==
{{D.E.H.T.A.}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.3.0|note=No longer a group quest (previously recommended 3 players).}}
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
