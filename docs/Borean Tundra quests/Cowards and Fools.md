==Objectives==
Speak to [[Ataika]] in [[Kaskala]], northeast of [[Valiance Keep]].

==Description==
Listen, <name>. No offense, but the operation they put [[Thassarian]] in charge of was pure suicide.

A handful of our men were to launch an attack on the biggest [[Scourge]] presence in the area. Call me crazy, but storming a Scourge [[ziggurat]] outside a [[Plague of Undeath|plagued]] [[Nerubian]] city with a dozen men ain't my idea of fun.

If you're still interested in finding Thassarian, we were supposed to arrange for passage east with a [[tuskarr]] by the name of Ataika in Kaskala to the northeast. Good luck with your fool's errand.

==Completion==
I remember the man you speak of. He bore the marks of Karkut.

May Karkut protect our fallen.
