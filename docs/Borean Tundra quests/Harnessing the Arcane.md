==Objectives==
Empower yourself with Unstable Arcane Energy by defeating [[Arcane Aberrant]]s or siphoning from [[Breach of Arcane Energy|Breaches of Arcane Energy]] around the foundation of the [[Nexus]].
* Empowered with Unstable Arcane Energy

==Description==
The energy from [[:Aluneth]] lashes out from within the weakened [[Nexus Vault]]. We may be able to use this raw, chaotic energy to our advantage.

If we can harness this energy and feed it into the [[Surge needle|Surge Needles]], it should cause a rather... destructive reaction.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I see you are able to harness the energies of Aluneth. It has been a long time since there was a [[mage]] that could control it.

Now, are you prepared to unleash it?

==Notes==
Upon accepting the quest (which happens automatically after completing [[Eyes of the Dragon (mage)]]), an "Unstable Arcane Energy" bar appears in your UI. The tooltip description reads: "Gathered arcane energy unleashed by Aluneth from within the Nexus Vault."

To fill the bar, kill [[Arcane Aberrant]]s or channel energy from the [[Breach of Arcane Energy|Breaches of Arcane Energy]] around the foundation of the Nexus.

As you absorb energy, you gain the "Unstable Arcane Energy" buff, whose description reads: "Absorb energy from Arcane Aberants{{sic}} and Breaches of Arcane Energy". As the energy bar fills up, your character begins to grow more and more brightly with arcane energy.
