==Objectives==
Speak to [[Primal Mighthorn]] at the [[Bloodspore Plains]] in the [[Borean Tundra]].

==Description==
[[Hellscream]] assigned Mighthorn and I with the daunting task of [[magnataur]] extermination on the southern front of [[Warsong Hold]]. With us came an entire platoon of seasoned [[Horde]] soldiers. Our initial foray into the nearby [[magnataur]] dens proved quite unsuccessful as our entire squad was wiped out by the lair defenders. We're the only ones left...

We aren't scientists or researchers. We're soldiers of the [[Horde]], just like you. Soldiers on a mission that cannot fail...

Speak to [[Primal Mighthorn]] now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2,000 [[XP]] or {{Cost||s=24|}} at level 80
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Completion==
The bloodspore that you collected might just be enough to give us an edge against the magnataurs of [[Gammoth]] - with your help, of course.
