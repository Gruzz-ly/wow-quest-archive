== Objectives ==
[[Overlord Razgor]] at [[Warsong Hold]] wants you to destroy 10 [[Nerub'ar Egg Sac]]s.
* [[Nerub'ar Egg Sac]] Destroyed (10)

== Description ==
Aerial reconnaissance of the [[Mightstone Quarry|quarry]] reports that the [[Nerubian]]s are storing their eggs on the scaffolding surrounding the base. Smart beasts these are... They're keeping the eggs high and dry, away from the epicenter of conflict.

You're going to have to go back out there and track down their eggs. Find 'em, smash 'em, and trash 'em.

Each egg destroyed means twenty less Nerubians feeding on our corpses. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Combatant Greatsword
|Warsong Longbow
|Writhing Longstaff
|Medic's Morning Star
|Soldier's Spiked Mace
|Vicious Spellblade}}

==Progress==
You need to destroy those egg sacs!

== Completion ==
They just keep on coming, despite our best efforts. Something's gotta give, <name>.
