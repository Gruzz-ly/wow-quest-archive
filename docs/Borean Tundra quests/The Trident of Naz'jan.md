==Objectives==
[[Veehja]] in Riplash wants you to go to the far northeastern end of the [[Riplash Ruins]]. Once there slay [[Ragnar Drakkarlund]] and obtain the Trident of Naz'jan from him.
* [[Trident of Naz'jan]]

==Description==
Five hundred years ago [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] imprisoned a being named [[Leviroth]] in the waters below. Now these barbarians seek to undo our queen's work.

They took over our city and began to sacrifice my brethren to awaken him! When they ran out of [[naga]], they began to take [[tuskarr]]. Their spirits will know no peace!

I will help you, for it will go a long way towards quelling my vengeance. Their captain, Ragnar, dwells deep inside northeastern Riplash. He has in his possession a golden trident. Bring it to me!

==Progress==
Do you have the trident?

==Completion==
Yesssssss! We will slay the [[Kvaldir]]'s beast! I will show these brutes to never cross a priestess of the scale!

==Progression==
