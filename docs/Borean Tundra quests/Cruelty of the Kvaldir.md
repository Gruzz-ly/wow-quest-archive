==Objectives==
Speak to [[Karuk]] about the [[Captured Tuskarr Prisoner]].

==Description==
I thank you for saving me, <name>. The [[kvaldir]] are animals!

They made us fight other prisoners. It would've been more merciful to just kill us all.

The youngling Karuk is still alive—I noticed him arrive here. Tell him [[Ariut|his father]] fought until the end.

==Completion==
I thank you, <name>. You've shown a great deal of goodwill towards my clan.
