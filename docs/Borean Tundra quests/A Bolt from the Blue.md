'''A Bolt from the Blue''' is a quest available after reaching [[Heart of Azeroth]] level 70 and upgrading [[The Crucible of Flame]] to rank 3. [[Kalecgos]] offers this quest without prompting, but the breadcrumb [[Unlocking the Power]] also unlocks at Heart of Azeroth level 70 in the capital cities.

==Objectives==
Meet Kalecgos at the Nexus and claim the Charged Scale of the Blue Aspect.
* Meet [[Kalecgos]] at the top of the [[Nexus]] {{co|28.0|26.2|Borean Tundra}}
* Charged Scale of the Blue Aspect revealed
* [[Charged Scale of the Blue Aspect (quest item)]]

==Description==
You have done much to empower the [[:Heart of Azeroth]], and I am proud that the [[dragonflight]]s have lent their strength to your cause.

It is now time for the [[blue dragonflight]] to do the same.

When I first learned of the essences, I knew that some remnant of my dragonflight's power must be out there, coalescing where we were once strong.

That is exactly what I have found. The [[Kirin Tor]] have isolated its signature at the Nexus, but only the wielder of the Heart of Azeroth can claim it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* +150 reputation with [[Champions of Azeroth]]
*[[Charged Scale of the Blue Aspect]]

==Progress==
The power of the Heart of Azeroth never ceases to amaze me.

==Completion==
We entrust you with this power, champion, because we believe that you will be the one to save [[Azeroth]].

Wield it well.

==Notes==
This quest will only be available after completing [[At the Azerite Time]].

Get to the [[Nexus]] on the island of [[Coldarra]], off the coast of the [[Borean Tundra]] in [[Northrend]]. Don't enter any of the instances, but instead fly to the top of the Nexus rings.

On top, Kalecgos observes as five [[Kirin Tor Keeper]]s are channeling into a sphere hovering over the center of the ring. Around them, [[Azure Skywing]]s fly.

;On approach at Nexus
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|We have isolated the essence just there. The energies of the Nexus have been building in it for who knows how long.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Go ahead, claim it! I look forward to seeing it.}}

Use the [[Extra Action Button]] Claim Charged Scale to reveal the Charged Scale of the Blue Aspect.

;Claim the charged scale
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Remarkable!}}

Turn in to Kalecgos, then speak to him again for a quick teleport back to the Chamber of Heart:

;Kalecgos
:We stand at the edge of the unknown, <name>! This is very exciting!
:{{Gossip|May I get a quick lift back to the Chamber of Heart?}}

Magni offers the final quest, [[We Stand United]].

Before going live, this quest was datamined to reward [[Radiant Azerite Matrix]] (1,000 [[Azerite (resource)]]).
