==Objectives==
[[Keristrasza]] has asked you to collect 10 Crystalized Mana Shards from around [[Coldarra]].

If you lose your [[Augmented Arcane Prison]], speak to [[Raelorasz]] at the [[Transitus Shield]].
* [[Crystallized Mana Shard (quest item)]] (10)

==Description==
During my captivity I was able to learn much about [[Malygos]]. Fate now allows us to use this knowledge against him.

There is a great [[blue dragon]], [[Saragosa]], who circles high above the Nexus. She serves both as the aspect's guardian and as his consort. If any serious threats arise, she alerts her master of the danger.

I suffered greatly at the hand of Saragosa during my captivity, and now her time to die has come. First, however, we must fashion the perfect bait....

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|4|70}}
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Wyrmrest Accord]]
* 20,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered the mana shards I require?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

I am drained from the effects of my confinement and my strength is returning ever so slowly.

I shall use the power from these crystals wisely. They are a byproduct of Malygos' malevolent schemes. With luck, they will play a part in his undoing.
