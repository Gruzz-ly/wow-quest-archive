'''Plug the Sinkholes''' concludes the [[Alliance]] introduction to [[Borean Tundra]]. After completing this quest, four quest lines open up, [[Farshire]], [[Word on the Street]], [[Nick of Time]] and [[Distress Call]], all of which point elsewhere in the zone.

==Objectives==
[[Sergeant Hammerhill]] wants you to use the Incendiary Explosives to collapse the sinkholes southwest and northwest of [[Valiance Keep]].
* Explosives set at southern sinkhole
* Explosives set at northern sinkhole
* [[Incendiary Explosives]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Scourge]] are showing no sign of letting up, <name>. It's those blasted sinkholes; they connect to the tunnels all the way to [[Icecrown]] for all we know. Giant [[undead]] worms burrow under the ground to create them.

If there's something years of mining has taught me it's that without support beams, tunnels will cave in easily after an explosion.

Take these explosive and place them at the entrance to the sinkholes on the ridge beyond the beach to the west. Come back after you've collapsed them.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Did you succeed, <name>? We need to slow down the Scourge or Valiance Keep will be overrun.

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. Without you, Valiance Keep might not have held against the attackers. Thanks to your help we'll live to fight another day.
