'''Bury Those Cockroaches''' is part of the [[Patience is a Virtue that We Don't Need]] quest chain.  

==Objectives==
[[Quartermaster Holgoth]] at [[Warsong Hold]] wants you to use the Seaforium Depth Charge Bundle to destroy the Nerub'ar sinkholes to the south, east, west and north of [[Warsong Hold]].
* South Nerub'ar Sinkhole Destroyed
* East Nerub'ar Sinkhole Destroyed
* West Nerub'ar Sinkhole Destroyed
* North Nerub'ar Sinkhole Destroyed
* [[Seaforium Depth Charge Bundle]] (provided)

==Description==
North, south, east and west. Those are the locations that you should be concerned about. Surrounding this fortress, within [[Mightstone Quarry]], are four perfectly situated [[Nerub'ar (Northrend)|Nerub'ar]] sinkholes.

<Holgoth hands you a bundle.>

Be very careful with that package, <name>. Mishandle it and you'll be dog meat.

Inside the bundle are seaforium depth charges. Get to each of those Nerub'ar sinkholes and plant a depth charge at their center point. If all goes well, the tunnels will collapse.

Get a move on!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Marshwalker Legguards
|Tundrastrider Coif
|Mightstone Breastplate
|Warsong's Wrath
}}

You will also gain:
*20100 [[XP]]
*250 reputation with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
Well?

==Completion==
That'll stop 'em - at least I think it'll stop 'em. Either way, you've done your part. That's all a <race> can ask for, no?
