==Objectives==
Escort [[Lurgglbr]] to the safety and then report to [[King Mrgl-Mrgl]] at [[Winterfin Retreat]] with the good news.
* Escort Lurgglbr to safety

==Description==
The lock on my cage doesn't look too solid, but I'm not foolish enough to try to leave without assistance.

Will you help me safely get out of these caverns? There's no time to waste, <race>.

When you get back to the retreat, please let the king know that I'm okay. He's sure to give you a reward.

==Rewards==
You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Shell Smasher]]
* [[Amphibious Speargun]]
* [[Scepter of the Winterfin]]
* [[Fish-Eye Poker]]
* [[Mrgl Blade]]
* [[Glimmering Orca Tooth]]

You will also gain:
* {{cost|4|70}}
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]
* 20,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes, <name>, what can I do for you?

==Completion==
This is wonderful news! And you say that Lurgglbr discovered that the emanations from the caverns are what caused this insanity?

It must be that the magic from [[Coldarra]] is growing stronger. The [[Nexus War]]... the battle between the [[blue dragonflight]] and all of the other dragons, is spilling over!

Soon, we will all be embroiled in it!
