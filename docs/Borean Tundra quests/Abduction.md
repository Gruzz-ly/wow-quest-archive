==Objectives==
[[Librarian Donathan|Donathan]] wants you to use the Arcane Binder on a wounded [[Beryl Sorcerer]] at [[Beryl Point]] and return to Amber Ledge with him.
*[[Captured Beryl Sorcerer]]
*[[Arcane Binder]] (provided)

==Description==
<name>, we have a situation.

I've just learned that one of our archmages en route from [[Dalaran]] has gone missing. Naturally, we suspect the mage hunters are behind her disappearance.

Time is clearly of the essence. We must know what has become of [[Lady Evanor]] at once if we are to have any hope of rescuing her.

Take this device. Return to Beryl Point and use it on a Beryl sorcerer when he is near death. It should bind him long enough for you to bring him here for questioning.

==Rewards==
You will gain:
* {{cost|4|70}}
* 20,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with the [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Have you captured a Beryl sorcerer yet, <name>?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>.

We'll have him prepared for his interrogation at once.

==Notes==
*After you have take the quest go down to the hill
*Find a [[Beryl Sorcerer]], you have to hit him until he have low life (~10%) and use [[Arcane Binder]] to capture the [[Beryl Sorcerer]].
