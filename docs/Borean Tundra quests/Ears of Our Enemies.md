'''Ears of Our Enemies''' becomes available after completing [[A Mission Statement]]. It is followed by a repeatable version, [[Can't Get Ear-nough...]].

This quest isn't required to complete the full D.E.H.T.A. Encampment questline, but it's fairly easy to wind up with 15 or more ears while doing the other quests anyway.

==Objectives==
[[Archdruid Lathorius|Arch Druid Lathorius]] at the [[D.E.H.T.A. Encampment]] in the [[Borean Tundra]] has said that he will reward you should you bring him 15 Nesingwary Lackey Ears.
*[[Nesingwary Lackey Ear]] (15)

==Description==
Whether they be treasure seekers or bloodthirsty hunters of the wastes, any being that supports [[Hemet Nesingwary|Nesingwary]] and dares to strike at our beloved wildlife shall be considered an enemy of [[Druids for the Ethical and Humane Treatment of Animals|D.E.H.T.A]].

Should you slay these filthy Nesingwary sympathizers, bring me proof of their demise and you shall be rewarded with a blessing from the druids of D.E.H.T.A.

==Rewards==
The following spell will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Blessing of D.E.H.T.A.|Increases armor by 10, all attributes by 10 and all resistances by 10. This buff only works in Borean Tundra.|icon=spell_nature_natureblessing|id=46119}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with the [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Ears will do quite nicely...

==Completion==
These will hang around my neck. Let them hear our message and let these ears be the vessels that carry our truths!

==Progression==
{{D.E.H.T.A.}}
