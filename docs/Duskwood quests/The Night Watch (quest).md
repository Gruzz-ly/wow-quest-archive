==Objectives==
Kill 8 Rotting Horrors near [[Blind Mary's Haunt]], southeast of [[Darkshire]].
*[[Rotting Horror]] slain (8)

==Description==
I'm afraid you're all I've got to help here, <name>. [[Stormwind]]'s forces are so taxed by greater evils that they can't spare a single footman to protect Darkshire. It's up to me and the rest of the [[Night Watch]] to keep our homes safe.

There's more threats here than just wolves, unfortunately. Rotting horrors roam near Blind Mary's Haunt, on the southeast outskirts. If they're not kept in check, they'll be visiting our homes in the night.

Deal with the undead and report back to me for your bounty.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||90}}
*9,450 [[XP]]
*+250 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
I don't have authority to order you around, <name>. But at least think of the citizens who'll be suffering if those undead are allowed to lurk.

==Completion==
Splendid, <name>.&nbsp; For your service to the people of Darkshire you shall be rewarded. 

==Notes==
Before heading down to [[Tranquil Gardens Cemetery]], pick up [[The Hermit (quest)]], run up to [[Beggar's Haunt]] to speak with [[Abercrombie]] to complete it, pick up the follow-up [[Supplies from Darkshire]], then run back to Darkshire to turn in to [[Madame Eva]]. Either heading to or returning from Beggar's Haunt, pick up [[Look To The Stars]] from [[Viktori Prism'Antras]], as that quest also deals with Mary. From Eva, pick up [[Ghost Hair Thread (quest)]]. Finally, head to Blind Mary's Haunt and start killing Rotting Horrors.

==Progression==
{{Citizens of Darkshire}}
