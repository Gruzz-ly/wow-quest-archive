==Objectives==
Head to Duskwood and meet with a member of the Cult of Forgotten Shadows.

==Description==
The [[Light]] walks among us, as does one of our enemies. You have done well to bring the prophecy to life, but it is not yet complete.

The shadows must rise, and to do so, the [[Cult of Forgotten Shadow]]s must be restored.

You will find the few remaining followers at the [[Raven Hill Cemetery|cemetery]] in [[Duskwood]]. They linger there near the grave of their [[Natalie Seline|fallen leader]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Alonsus Faol|Alonsus]] sent you, did he? He's never shown much interest in us before.

Of course, we've never been ones to follow the Light, at least not in the way that most would want us to.

We embrace the [[Shadow]]s as well, finding our faith in the balance between both extremes. 

==Notes==
Use the portal in Netherlight Temple to return to Dalaran. Head to the [[Chamber of the Guardian]] and take the [[Karazhan]] portal, then fly to the cemetery in Duskwood.

==Progression==
{{Priest artifact and class hall}}
