== Objectives ==
Use the Mistmantle Family Ring at [[Manor Mistmantle]], east of town.  
*{{NPC|combat|Stalvan Mistmantle}} slain {{coords|77|36|Duskwood}}

== Description ==
I'm afraid I cannot give Tobias the answers he seeks. But I can help you find the only person who can...

Stalvan Mistmantle.

Take the ring into the woods to the east, to Manor Mistmantle, where Stalvan's body was buried. Enter, and hold the ring before you. Let the waning moon pour its light through the ring, and the spirits will answer your call.

Take heed, <name>. The questions of the living can offer more comfort than the answers of the dead.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Stalvan's Cloak
|Slippers of the Crescent Moon
|Bracers of Forlorn Spirits
|Burden of Shame
|Despondent Spirit Bindings
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||60|}}
* 2,150 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

== Completion ==
[[Oliver Harris|Master Harris]] may have been right. I would have been better to leave the past behind.

I've got a new life now. Whether it's that of a monster or a man is up to me.

As for you, I cannot thank you enough for your assistance, regardless of the outcome. Please, take this with my thanks.

== Notes ==
Stand inside [[Manor Mistmantle]], which is located at {{coords|77|36|Duskwood}} north-northeast of town, and use the ring.
