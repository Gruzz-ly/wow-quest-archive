== Objectives ==
Find the Lightforged Arch within the [[Dawning Woods Catacombs]]. 

== Description ==
<In front of you, the bare earth slopes down towards the dark entrance to the crypts.>

<You can feel the tug of the lightforged artifact urging you towards it. Perhaps the other piece is down there?> 

== Completion ==
<In the dirt of this alcove, your eye catches the shine of brilliant metal. You've found another piece of the artifact!>

== Notes ==
Enter the [[Dawning Wood Catacombs]], killing ghouls all the way, heading north, then west. The dirt pile containing the Lightforged Arch is at {{co|20.4|27.4|Duskwood}} at the northwestern end of the east-west room.
