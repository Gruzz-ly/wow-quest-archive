== Objectives ==
Gather 6 [[Dusky Lump]]s from [[Venom Web Spider]]s. 
*[[Dusky Lump]] x6

== Description ==
I'll let you in on a little secret - Dusky "Crab" Cakes are really made from spider legs! I know it's a bit disgusting, but the cakes have a nice, tangy flavor and make great snacks! Bring me Gooey Spider Legs and I'll whip you up a few of them.

I hear Venom Web Spiders are a good source - they nest to the north, between the foothills and the river.

== Rewards ==
* [[Recipe: Gooey Spider Cake]]
* 3x [[Gooey Spider Cake]]
* 80 [[XP|xp]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]].

== Progress ==
Hail, <name>.  Did you get that lump meat for me?

== Completion ==
Ah yes, a nice lump you have there!  Let me just get this seasoned with my secret spices (no looking!) and get them to skittering on a skillet for a while...

And, although Dusky Crab Cakes are my specialty and I won't give out the recipe, here's the recipe for a dish that's almost as good.
