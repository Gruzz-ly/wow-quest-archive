==Objectives==
Start your search for the Deadwind Harvester at [[Manor Mistmantle]] in [[Duskwood]].
* (Optional) Take the [[Dalaran]] portal to [[Karazhan]]
* Investigate Manor Mistmantle in Duskwood
* Convince [[Revil Kost|Revil]] to help
*[[Duskwood Scroll]] (provided)

==Description==
The book says the [[Dark Riders]] were last seen in a place called Manor Mistmantle. If friend can find these riders, then <he/she> can get Ulthalesh!

[[Calydus]] will wait here and await your return. Find Ulthalesh, friend!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
* 15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Progress==
And just why should I help you, warlock?

==Completion==
I am left with little choice. I cannot face another Dark Rider ambush alone, and you are obviously formidable.

I will help you find the weapon you see, but only if you will allow me to return the others in their possession to their rightful place.

Do we have a deal, warlock?

==Notes==
Take the portal from Dalaran to Karazhan, and fly to Manor Mistmantle.
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Stay back, warlock! I may be wounded, but the [[Light]] will protect me!}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|What? Have you not come to finish what the Dark Riders started?}}

Talk with Revil to continue.
:So you hunt the Dark Riders as well? Long have I searched for a way to rid Duskwood of their curse, but now it seems I have become the hunted.
:Though we share a common enemy, the sins you bear prevent me from aiding your cause. The Light is not well served by taking power from one evil only to bestow it upon another.
:{{gossip|The power would serve to defeat the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]. You consider that an evil goal?}}
::I admit that the Legion is a great threat, but my duty is to the Light.
::I must stand vigilant against its enemies at all times, no matter how dire the situation appears.
::{{gossip|If we do not act, [[Sargeras]] will take this world. There will be no remnant of your Holy Light to follow. Where will your duty be then?}}
:::The Light will not falter so long as the brave hold it in their hearts.
:::We have seen it bring about the Legion's defeat before, and it will do so again.
:::{{gossip|You are wrong. I was at the [[Broken Shore]]. I saw the demons cut through our men, holy and unholy alike. If we cannot turn the tide now, we are all lost.}}
:::{{text|say|Revil Kost|I hear the truth in your words, warlock. We may walk very different paths, but I see you fight for a noble cause.}}
:::{{text|say|Revil Kost|I will tell you what I know.}}
:::{{gossip|I saw your holy warriors broken on the rocks outside the [[Tomb of Sargeras]]! This is unlike any Legion force we've seen, and we'll need more than your Holy Light to drive it back this time!}}
:::{{text|say|Revil Kost|Your words are acid, but there is truth in them. Though I detest the methods you employ, it seems we may have no choice.}}
:::{{text|say|Revil Kost|Very well, I will tell you what I know.}}
:::{{gossip|Enough of this! You will answer me or die, priest! <Attack>}}
::{{Gossip|You are a fool! You'll cling to your Holy Light, even as the Legion purges this world. How will your Light serve you when you're left a slave?}}
:::It is you who are foolish, warlock!

:::The Light is a bulwark for the faithful! It has aided us in holding back the Legion before, and it will do so again!

::{{gossip|Forget this. I will take the answers I need! <Attack>}}
:{{gossip|I don't have time for your nonsense, priest! The Burning Legion is the greater threat!}}
::To me, there is no greater threat than those who despoil the light!
::I will not guide the hand of a sinner to power, no matter the ultimate cost!
::{{gossip|If we do not act, Sargeras will take this world. There will be no remnant of your Holy Light to follow. Where will your duty be then?}}
:::The Light will not falter so long as the brave hold it in their hearts.
:::We have seen it bring about the Legion's defeat before, and it will do so again.

:{{gossip|If you will not tell me, I will strip the answers from your soul! <Attack>}}
