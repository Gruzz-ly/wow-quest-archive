==Objectives==
Slay Stitches in [[Darkshire]]. 
*[[Stitches]] slain

==Description==
You're not the first fool to be manipulated by [[Abercrombie]]! That doddering old man is known as The Embalmer to us. He's a vile [[necromancer]] and a blight upon this town.

And now, sewn together and given life by the very materials you brought him, his horrible creation approaches!

That hideous creature will be upon us in mere moments! If you have any heart, <name>, you'll help the Night Watch drive off the abomination and save our town!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

You will also receive:
* [[Stitches' Femur]]
* {{cost||60|}}
* 2,150 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Don't just stand there! He's right outside! By the light, man, do something!

==Completion==
Thank the light, he's gone...

I'll say you've made amends by helping save the lives of those here, <name>. 

==Notes==
Head outside, where everything has caught fire! [[Stitches]] is attacking guards in the center of town. A level 23 elite abomination, stitches has just over 6,000 health. Help the guards take it out!
