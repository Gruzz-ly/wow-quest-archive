This quest is part of quest chain {{questchain|The Story of Morgan Ladimore}}.

==Objectives==
Kill [[Mor'Ladim]], then return his skull to [[Commander Althea Ebonlocke]] in [[Darkshire]].
*[[Mor'Ladim's Skull]]
*Suggested Players [3] 

==Description==
From what my scouts tell me, Mor'Ladim wanders throughout [[Duskwood]], following a strange and meandering path through [[Raven Hill Cemetery|the cemetery]]. We buried him out past the [[Forlorn Rowe|house on the hill]], you know where that is?

There isn't anything I can do to help you, but I wish you good luck.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||18}}
*1500 [[XP]] (165 XP at grey level)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
I don't blame you if you're having trouble with him, <name>. Some of our strongest [[Night Watch|Watcher]]s have been lost to Mor'Ladim.

==Completion==
You killed him? That's no small accomplishment, <name>! On behalf of the people of Darkshire and the Night Watch, I thank you.

Ah... there is one small matter, however...

==Notes==
Return to north of [[Forlorn Rowe]] (take the flight path back to [[Raven Hill]]!), where at {{co|17.7|29.1|Duskwood}} is [[A Weathered Grave]].

[[Mor'Ladim]] wanders around the cemetery, but does eventually stop at the grave marker. A level 25 elite [[skeletal warrior]], Mor'Ladim has 4,194 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Holy Shock|Blasts the target with Holy energy, causing Holy damage to an enemy|range=30|notes=Instant.}}
*{{abilities|Enraging Memories|Drives the caster into a maddened frenzy for 8 sec. Increases the caster's attack speed by 50%, but slows its movement speed by 25% and reduces the Physical damage it deals by 10.|cd=25 sec}}

The game suggests a group, which is strongly advised. Take him out, then fly back to Darkshire.

==Progression==
{{Morgan Ladimore Cataclysm}}
