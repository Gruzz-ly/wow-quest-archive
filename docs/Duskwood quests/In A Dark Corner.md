==Objectives==
Search the [[Rotting Orchard]] for the Torn Journal Page.
*[[A Torn Journal]] {{coords|66|76|Duskwood}}

==Description==
If you're that serious about this, I'll help you, <name>. I know where the other documents must be. I'm just too terrified to do anything about it.

There's only a few places that those horrible [[Nightbane pack|Nightbane]] beasts gather when they're not prowling the forest. One of them's the Rotting Orchard to the south. They use the buildings there as their dens, so if they haven't just eaten the other documents, you might find one there... but you'll have to search their lairs thoroughly, I wager.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||12}}
*1450 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with {{F|Stormwind}}

==Progress==
You're back in one piece, I see.

==Completion==
This was all you found?

That's bad news, I'm afraid...

==Notes==
Before heading out, turn in [[Worgen in the Woods]] and pick up [[The Rotting Orchard (quest)]].

[[A Torn Journal]] is in a Pile of Scraps at {{coords|66|76|Duskwood}} inside the barn.
