==Objectives==
Use the Holy Censer to soothe 5 Forlorn Spirits at the [[Addle's Stead|Addle Stead]].
*[[Forlorn Spirit]] soothed (5)
*[[Holy Censer]] (provided)

==Description==
This is a tragic land, with a history of violence and despair. While many of the dead roam in the flesh, some are simply lost souls, wandering in confusion.

They deserve to be put at ease.

Many of these souls gather at the Addle Stead to the south, appearing before travelers. Take this censer of holy incense. Sway it before the forlorn spirits, and let the offering of its gentle scent give them peace.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||17}}

==Progress==
The spirits deserve rest.

==Completion==
You have brought peace to those who knew only misery, <name>. Be proud. 

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Curse We Cannot Lift]] before heading south.

The censer only works on the neutral [[Forlorn Spirit]]s, not the hostile [[Anguished Spirit]]s. Once done, enter the farm, where at roughly {{co|21.5|73.2|Duskwood}} the [[Lurking Worgen]] will jump down from the rafters and attack. Get it to 20% health, where it will stop attacking:

Use [[Harris's Ampule]] to tranquilize it.
