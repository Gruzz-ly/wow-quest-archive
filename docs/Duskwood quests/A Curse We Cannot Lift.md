{{questportrait|Lurking Worgen.jpg|Lurking Worgen|Use Harris's Ampule to tranquilize him.}}
== Objectives ==
Search the [[Addle's Stead|Addle Stead]] for the [[Lurking Worgen]] and use [[:Harris's Ampule]] to tranquilize it.
* Lurking Worgen captured {{co|21.5|73.2|Duskwood}}

== Description ==
What we do here is not a cure. The transformation cannot be removed once inflicted. But the mind...

The mind can be restored, through alchemy, if enough is left intact. This worgen you've encountered sounds like he's fighting to stay aware, <name>. We've got to find him again.

If he's fled the [[Yorgen Farmstead|Yorgen Stead]], search the [[Addle's Stead|Addle Stead]] to the south; he may be lurking in one of the buildings.

Inject him with this ampule to tranquilize him. You'll need to be quite close.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,950 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Progress==
Have you searched the Addle Stead thoroughly?

I'd check the very back of the barn. Many things can lurk in such a building.

==Completion==
You've got him!

No time to lose, then. We'll prepare to administer the serum right away.

[[Jitters|JITTERS]]! Get ready! 

==Notes==
Pick up [[Soothing Spirits]] before heading out. Jitters has a side chain that starts with [[The Jitters-Bugs]].

The censer only works on the neutral [[Forlorn Spirit]]s, not the hostile [[Anguished Spirit]]s. Once done, enter the farm, where at roughly {{co|21.5|73.2|Duskwood}} the [[Lurking Worgen]] will jump down from the rafters and attack. Get it to 20% health, where it will stop attacking:

Use [[Harris's Ampule]] to tranquilize it.

==Progression==
{{Raven Hill Worgen}}
