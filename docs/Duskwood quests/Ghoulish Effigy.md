== Objectives ==
Gather 7 [[Ghoul Rib]]s from [[Fetid Corpse]]s at [[Manor Mistmantle]]. 
* [[Ghoul Rib]] (7)

== Description ==
Out here on the outskirts of town, it's a wonder the walking dead haven't eaten me! In fact, just yesterday a pack of ghouls was pounding on the walls of my tower!

I want to make an effigy - a kind of "scarecrow" for ghouls. To do that I need some ghoul ribs. You can find plenty of them on the fetid corpses wandering Manor Mistmantle's grounds, north of Darkshire...

Get the ribs for me, and I will repay you with some coin. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||14}}
*1750 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
I'm sure you could find plenty of ribs in [[Raven Hill]] as well, but you might not want to wander so far at night...

== Completion ==
Ah, thanks. These will do just the trick!

==Notes==
*[[Manor Mistmantle]] is immediately to the west of [[Beggar's Haunt]], and to the northeast of [[Darkshire]].
