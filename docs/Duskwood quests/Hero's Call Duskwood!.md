==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Commander Althea Ebonlocke}} at [[Darkshire]] in [[Duskwood]].

==Description==

'''Bailiff Conacher'''

: <Name>, the citizens of Duskwood are in dire need of your assistance. I have here a letter from Commander Althea Ebonlock, leader of the [[Night Watch]], pleading for help.

: To reach Darkshire you should travel across the bridge located in the [[Three Corners|southwest corner]] of [[Redridge Mountains|Redridge]]. Once you cross the bridge you will be in Duskwood. Then you just follow the road to Darkshire. Beware of the savage beasts that stalk the countryside!

'''Hero's Call Board'''

: By order of his royal highness, King Varian Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Commander Althea Ebonlocke in Darkshire.

: The commander's watchmen are stretched thin defending against marauding wolves and bands of wild worgen. They cannot hold out for long without your help. You can reach Darkshire in Duskwood by following the road south at the border between Elwynn Forest and the Redridge Mountains.

: For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|}}

==Completion==
You are the help that we requested?

<Althea sighs.>

I suppose you will have to do.
