'''Look To The Stars''' sends the adventurer to find a reflective mirror.

== Objectives ==
Locate [[Blind Mary|Mary]] and persuade her to give up a reflective surface for [[Viktori Prism'Antras|Viktori's]] project. 

== Description ==
My gnomish friend, Cog, has promised to help me build a device which will let me peer towards the stars. According to Cog's blueprint, what I need first is a way to reflect light.

I remember a woman by the name of Mary who became well known around these parts for always carrying a looking glass. Perhaps you can track Mary down and see if she might lend us a reflective surface for this project? I believe she once resided in southern Duskwood. . .

== Completion ==
Why yes, I used to own a looking glass. 

== Notes ==
Make sure to complete [[The Hermit (quest)]] and [[Supplies from Darkshire]], then pick up [[Ghost Hair Thread (quest)]] before heading south to see [[Blind Mary]], just outside the [[Tranquil Gardens Cemetery]]. Also, pick up [[The Night Watch (quest)]] and kill the [[Rotting Horror]]s in the general vicinity.
