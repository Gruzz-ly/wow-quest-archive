==Objectives==
Kill 15 [[Splinter Fist]] Ogres of any kind.
*Splinter Fist Ogre slain (15)

==Description==
Hail, <class>. Care to lend a hand for the people of [[Darkshire]]?

There's a huge [[Vul'Gol Ogre Mound|ogre mound]] just down the hill there. The [[Splinter Fist]] ogres usually keep to themselves, but they've got a bad habit of attacking travelers. Just the other day I saw one drag off a poor man's horse for food... he was lucky it left him behind!

The Night Watch wants to only risk its few members in the defense of more immediate threats, me included. But if you kill some of those ogres for me, I'll pay you for your deed.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||14}}

==Progress==
If you'd rather just sit around camp and have a drink or two, that's fine too, I guess.

==Completion==
I saw you drop a few of them from here. Nice work.

Here's your reward, on behalf of the Night Watch.

==Progression==
{{Viktori Prism'Antras}}

==Trivia==
* Several players have encountered a bug with the quest location tracking system directing them to [[Feralas]] to complete this quest rather than the correct Duskwood location and NPC.<ref>{{Ref web |url=https://www.wowhead.com/quest=25235/vulgar-vulgol#comments:id=3210063 |author=Aquril, shavasara, FixManTx (various dates 2013-2025) |publisher=[[Wowhead]] |title=Vulgar Vul'Gol (comments)}}</ref>
