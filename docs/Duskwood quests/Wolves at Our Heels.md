==Objectives==
Kill 12 Dire Wolves.
*[[Dire Wolf (Duskwood)|Dire Wolf]] slain (12)

==Description==
The dire wolves are the most common threat to the townsfolk here. They lurk in the forests on all sides of us, though most are along the north bank of the river.

These aren't the runt dogs you see in [[Elwynn Forest|Elwynn]], or wherever you come from. They're big as a man and twice as vicious.

If you wish to assist the people of [[Darkshire]], hunt the dire wolves so our streets can be safer. 

==Reward==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ebonlocke Band
|Night Watch Vest
|Night Watch Boots
|Night Watch Hauberk
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||90}}
*5x [[Flash Bundle]]
*1,650 [[XP]] (or {{cost||7|80}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
You still hunting wolves...?

==Completion==
Don't go thinking that was too easy. Far greater dangers lurk deeper in the woods.

==Notes==
*Pick up [[Seasoned Wolf Kabobs]] and [[Dusky Crab Cakes (quest)]] from the inn before heading out.
*Wolves are far to the north, close to the border with [[Elwynn Forest]]. Spiders are generally in the same area.
*Another quest chain, starting with [[Worgen in the Woods]], is also available at the same time. The worgen are just south of the wolf area.

==Progression==
{{Citizens of Darkshire}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added, replacing [[Wolves at Our Heels (Classic)]].}}
