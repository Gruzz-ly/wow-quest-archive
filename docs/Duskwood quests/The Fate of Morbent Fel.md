==Objectives==
Search [[Forlorn Rowe]] for signs of [[Morbent Fel]].
*Remains of Morbent Fel {{co|17.0|33.4|Duskwood}}

==Description==
Before I was lost to the woods, the last thing I remember is Morbent Fel. He was a vile [[necromancer]], and the reason this land swarms with so many vile undead.

I asked an [[adventurer]] to [[Morbent Fel (quest)|help me put an end to him]]. I thought they did! But [[Sister Elsington]] tells me the land still crawls with ghouls and spectres ripped from the grave.

Morbent Fel should have breathed his last in the house on Forlorn Rowe, north of [[Raven Hill Cemetery]]. Go there and see what's become of him... 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||17}}
*1,400 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Progress==
What did you find?

==Completion==
His clothes and bloodstains? If it's not tricks, it's something worse...

==Notes==
[[Forlorn Rowe]] is at the northwestern corner of the [[Raven Hill Cemetery]], at the northern end of the zone. Enter the house at {{co|17.6|33.4|Duskwood}} and head upstairs, where at {{co|17.0|33.4|Duskwood}} in the center of the bedroom is a [[Bloodsoaked Hat]].

Interact with the hat, then exit the house. Before returning to Raven Hill, turn north and run about 100 yards due north to find at {{co|17.7|29.1|Duskwood}} [[A Weathered Grave]], which starts the [[Morgan Ladimore]] chain via [[The Weathered Grave (quest)]]. Hold on to The Weathered Grave for the moment and return to Raven Hill to continue the Morbent Fel story.
