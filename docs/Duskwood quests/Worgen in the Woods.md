==Objectives==
Kill 7 Nightbane Worgen in [[Brightwood Grove]].
*[[Nightbane Worgen]] Slain (7)

==Description==
Darkness seems drawn inexorably to Duskwood. Master Carevin's quest is the expulsion of evil and [[Heretic|heresy]]. Through our efforts are the people of Darkshire kept safe.

You believe yourself worthy to join us?

I once thought as you. Disillusioned by the complacency of the Watch, I joined Master Carevin. If you wish to prove yourself, it will not be through words.

Test your skills against the Nightbane worgen in Brightwood Grove. We'll see if you have what it takes to hunt these monsters.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||15}}

==Progress==
<Name>, how fares the hunt?

==Completion==
Impressive, <name>. It would seem that you are capable enough to handle yourself. Perhaps a more suitable challenge could be found for one of your abilities.

==Notes==
Pick up and complete [[The Legend of Stalvan (quest)]], then pick up [[The Stolen Letters]] before heading out to [[Brightwood Grove]].

[[A Slashed Bundle of Letters]] is found near a campfire at {{coords|61|40|Duskwood}}, in front of worgen huts.

==Progression==
{{Worgen in the Woods Cataclysm}}
