== Objectives ==
{{npc||Commander Althea Ebonlocke}} of [[Darkshire]] wants you to kill 5 Skeletal Warriors and 5 Skeletal Mages.
*[[Skeletal Warrior (Duskwood)|Skeletal Warrior]] Slain (5)
*[[Skeletal Mage (mob)|Skeletal Mage]] Slain (5)

== Description ==
There's even fouler undead left to deal with, <name>.

Tranquil Gardens Cemetery, further south of town, is a place you don't want to be caught in at night. The bones that rise from the ground there are cunning enough to remember how to swing an axe or cast a spell.

I shouldn't need to explain how dangerous that makes them. Proceed with caution, but remember the people of Darkshire that will suffer if you falter.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Shoulderwraps of Honor
|Watch Master's Breastplate
|Signet of the Night Watch
|Night Watcher's Mail
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
I hope you're not going back on your word, <name>.

== Completion ==
The people of Darkshire thank you, <name>.  You have proven yourself to be a great ally of [[The Night Watch]]. 

==Notes==
After returning from Blind Mary's to turn in [[The Night Watch (quest)]], continue the Abercrombie story by completing [[Ghost Hair Thread (quest)]], [[Return the Comb]], [[Deliver the Thread]], and [[Zombie Juice (quest)]], then finally pick up [[Gather Rot Blossoms]]. Before heading down to the cemetery, pick up and complete [[Look To The Stars]], then accept the followup: [[The Insane Ghoul]]. Kill the skeletons outside the chapel, and the ghoul inside.

==Progression==
{{Citizens of Darkshire}}
