== Objectives ==
Kill 10 Nightbane Shadow Weavers at the [[Rotting Orchard]].
*[[Nightbane Shadow Weaver]] slain x10

== Description ==
The worgen infestation stretches further than Brightwood Grove. To the south, on the very edges of Darkshire itself, the Rotting Orchard is host to even more of the savage beasts.

The worgen there are more cunning, <name>, but just as savage and evil. They conjure foul shadows to tear their enemies apart from a distance. Go to the Rotting Orchard, and slay the Shadow Weavers to keep the town safe!

== Progress ==
Back so soon, <name>? I hope you haven't come to tell me you've given up.

== Completion ==
You performed well against the Shadow Weavers, <name>. But even now, years after their first arrival, there seem to be so many to replace the ones we kill.

I will put my faith in Master Carevin. No doubt he will get to the bottom of the problem. 

==Progression==
{{Worgen in the Woods Cataclysm}}

== Rewards ==

== Notes ==
Before heading out, turn in [[The Stolen Letters]] and pick up [[In A Dark Corner]].

[[A Torn Journal]] is in a Pile of Scraps at {{coords|66|76|Duskwood}} inside the barn.
