== Objectives ==
Search the tunnel under the [[Dawning Woods Catacombs]] for the Lightforged Crest. 

== Description ==
<You attach the arch to the rod, and the artifact is nearly complete. A large gap still sits at the center of the holy symbol's head.>

<Once again you feel it tug your arm, urging you towards the hole in the wall and the winding tunnel ahead. The last piece must be through there.>

== Completion ==
<In the darkest depths of this earthen tunnel, you spy the faintest gleam. The last piece is found!>

==Notes==
From the Arch's position, continue north through the hole in the wall into the winding tunnel, following the past westward until coming across the [[Lightforged Crest]] at {{co|18.0|25.4|Duskwood}} just as the tunnel turns south.
