==Objectives==
Return Abercrombie's Crate to [[Abercrombie]].
* [[Abercrombie's Crate]] {{co|33.5|75.3|Duskwood}}

==Description==
A few weeks ago I was picking herbs far from my house, and a band of [[ogre]]s attacked me! I ran, and I was forced to leave behind a crate of precious tools and herbs.

After they chased me off, the ogres swaggered back to the [[Vul'Gol Ogre Mound|ogre mound]] in southern [[Duskwood]]. I'm sure my crate is somewhere near the mound.

Please, <name>, retrieve this crate for me for I miss it sorely. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||14}}
*1750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have my crate?  If so, then please...give it to me quickly!

==Completion==
Thank the Nec-...well, thank YOU, <name>!  You have more than earned your reward.

Aha! Happy! Happy nights ahead!!

==Notes==
Continue the [[Viktori Prism'Antras]] with [[Classy Glass]], which also takes place at the ogre mound. Also, just before reaching the mound, pick up [[Vulgar Vul'Gol]] from [[Watcher Dodds]].

The chest is on the ground at {{co|33.5|75.3|Duskwood}} immediately outside the mouth of the cave in the ogre mound. [[Zzarc'Vul]] is at the southern end of the cave.

==Progression==
