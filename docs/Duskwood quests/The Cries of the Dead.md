==Objectives==
Kill 20 ghouls of any kind in Raven Hill Cemetery.  
*[[Ghoul]] slain (20)

==Description==
Can you hear them, <name>? There's so many of them. They wander their graves, shuffling across the cold ground on rotting limbs.

The dead cry out in the still air. They suffer in their own flesh, forced from sleep! Every night I venture to the graveyard to put more of them to rest, but it's never enough.

Help me, <name>. Put the ghouls that swarm Raven Hill Cemetery out of their misery. Strike down as many as you can. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sister Elsington's Belt
|Aegis of Faith
|Ghoul-Hunter Leggings
|Ghoul-Slayer Greaves
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Progress==
I can still hear them...

==Completion==
The cries grow softer for now. Light bless you, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Guided by the Light]] before heading north into the [[Raven Hill Cemetery]]. Don't focus on killing the ghouls at the expense of the main quest chain! There will be plenty of ghouls to be killed in the next handful of quests.

Back at Raven Hill, Sister Elsington probably offers to adventurers who have reached level 24 [[Rebels Without a Clue]], a breadcrumb to [[Northern Stranglethorn]]. If in a hurry, pick up rebels, otherwise finish off the [[Morgan Ladimore]] storyline with [[The Weathered Grave (quest)]].
