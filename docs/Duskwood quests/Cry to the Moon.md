==Objectives==
Gather a bloom of [[Elune]]'s Grace.
* [[Elune's Grace (item)]]
*Meet [[Vassandra Stormclaw]] at the [[Twilight Grove]].

==Description==
[[Duskwood]] has a direct connection to the [[Emerald Dream]]. Through this connection, I may be able to call forth the [[Ancient]] [[Goldrinn]]. He will be able to give the [[Tess Greymane|princess]] a taste of the [[Worgen curse|curse]] she so dangerously chases.

A rare bloom grows on the east side of the woods, gather its bloom and meet me in [[Twilight Grove]]. It will help me with this ritual.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Such flowers have been known to attract wolves, but I doubt you will have a problem with that.

==Completion==
Perfect. This should help lure the great wolf out of hiding.

==Notes==
Head to [[Manor Mistmantle]]. The plant is guarded by a [[Mistfang Alpha]].

==Progression==
{{Heritage of Gilneas}}
