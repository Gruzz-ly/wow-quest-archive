==Objectives==
Subdue Bloodeyes and return with her to [[Raven Hill]].
* [[Pungent Meat]] placed (Optional)
* [[Bloodeyes]] subdued
* Bloodeyes brought to Raven Hill

==Description==
[[Tess Greymane|Princess Greymane]] has informed me of the situation and I do have an idea of how to help.

But first, a favor for a favor. The residents of [[Duskwood]] have been plagued recently by a particularly ferocious member of the [[Nightbane pack]] that they call 'Bloodeyes'. Take [[Oliver Harris|Master Harris]]'s sedative and bring the [[worgen]] back to me alive. She will be a perfect subject to test cures on.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If we can cure even the most feral of worgen, then [[Worgen curse|the curse]] will mean nothing to us.

==Completion==
I thank you for your help. Tess has yet to return from her task.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Vassandra Stormclaw|Princess, I have something to ask of you, as well.}}

At {{co|52.00|61.42|Duskwood}} place the Pungent Meat on the ground, which causes Bloodeyes to appear. Use the extra action button and get her to 30%, after which she starts following the character. The Dragging Bloodeyes debuff is also present, preventing flying in the area.

;On return
:{{Text|say|Vassandra Stormclaw|The worgen curse affects some worse than others. [[Goldrinn]]'s rage is not easily subdued.}}

==Progression==
{{Heritage of Gilneas}}
