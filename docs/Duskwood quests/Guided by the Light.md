== Objectives ==
Find the [[Lightforged Rod]] in [[Raven Hill Cemetery]]. 

== Description ==
{{npc||Sven Yorgen||Sven}} is correct. I can feel the presence of a powerful evil deep beneath the Raven Hill Cemetery. Evil lurks in its catacombs, and [[Morbent Fel]] must be the source.

You will need the power of the [[Light]] to strike him down, <name>. Sven told me the heroes who first slew Morbent Fel wielded an artifact of [[Lightforge iron|lightforged iron]], imbued with holy power. That artifact is still here!

I can feel it as well, a glimmer of light amidst the darkness. Search Raven Hill for it, and let the light guide you through it.

== Completion ==
<Buried in the cold dirt, you find a brilliant metal shaft. But there are holes where pieces of the artifact are clearly missing.>

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Cries of the Dead]] before heading north into [[Raven Hill Cemetery]].

Kill a path through the cemetery to the northeastern corner, where at {{co|23.4|35.4|Duskwood}} lies the [[Lightforged Rod]] and the entrance to the [[Dawning Wood Catacombs]]. Interact with it to continue the quest chain.
