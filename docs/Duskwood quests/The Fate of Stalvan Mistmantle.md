== Objectives ==
Take The Legend of Stalvan back to [[Tobias Mistmantle]].  
*[[The Legend of Stalvan]]

== Description ==
You've recovered everything. Everything except the last page...

...which I've got right here. Don't look at me like that. You'll understand when you read it. Some even say it's cursed, you know. In fact, I was relieved when the worgen broke in and made off with these!

Take it. Take all of it, in fact. I thank you for recovering my archives, but I don't want anything to do with this ever again. Please, just leave me be.  

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||8}}
*920 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

== Progress ==
You're back! Did you find anything about my brother?

== Completion ==
I can't thank you enough... I had hoped for this to be a joyous reunion, but the more I learn, the less glad I am to have asked.

But I must know.
