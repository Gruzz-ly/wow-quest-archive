== Objectives ==
Kill 8 Nightbane Vile Fangs and 8 Nightbane Tainted Ones in [[Roland's Doom]]. 
*[[Nightbane Vile Fang]] slain x8
*[[Nightbane Tainted One]] slain x8

== Description ==
Your previous accomplishments have convinced me that you are ready to take on the toughest worgen infesting the woods.

Of the worgen that have made their new home here, the Vile Fangs and the Tainted Ones have proven the most dangerous. They've settled down near some of the caves and in the mine to the south.

From far away you can even see the light from their bonfires...

== Progress ==
Intimidating beasts, aren't they? But have no fear, <name>, those who stand for the Light will never fall!

== Completion ==
<Name>, to be honest with you, I did not believe that you would get this far, but you are clearly a <class> to be reckoned with. In fact, if you wish to formally join Master Carevin's struggle, I will gladly write for you a letter of recommendation.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||15}}

== Notes ==
Turn in [[In A Dark Corner]] and pick up [[Roland's Doom (quest)]] before heading out.

Vile fangs are outside the mine, tainted ones are inside the mine, and the [[Muddy Journal Pages]] is at {{coords|73|79|Duskwood}} at the end of the mine in [[Roland's Doom]].

==Progression==
{{Worgen in the Woods Cataclysm}}
