==Objectives==
Gather 5 [[Rot Blossom]]s from [[Tranquil Gardens Cemetery]].
* [[Rot Blossom]] x5

==Description==
If you bring me some rot blossoms then I can brew you up a batch of zombie juice.

Rot blossoms grow in strange places. They tend to flourish on dead things, and Duskwood has its fair share of those!

I've seen a few of them growing at Tranquil Gardens Cemetery lately. Check near the graves... but mind the dead that are walking about near there.

==Rewards==
You will gain:
*1750 [[XP]]
*{{cost||14}}

==Progress==
Hi, <name>.  Do you have those rot blossoms for me yet?

==Completion==
Good,  you got the rot blossoms.

I'll whip up the zombie juice... it's strong stuff, I warn you.

==Notes==
Before heading down to the cemetery, pick up and complete [[The Night Watch (quest)]], then pick up [[Bones That Walk]]. Also pick up and complete [[Look To The Stars]], then pick up [[The Insane Ghoul]]. The rot blossoms litter the ground of the cemetery.
