==Objectives==
Defeat Eric Davidson in a pet battle.
*Defeat [[Eric Davidson]]

==Description==
I heard all my friends talking about a scary [[worgen]] called Eric Davidson in [[Duskwood]] that nobody ever fights with their pets.

I bet if you found and beat him, people might talk about you instead!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*80 [[XP]]
*[[Sack of Pet Supplies]]

==Progress==
Are you afraid, <race>?

==Completion==
Not only do you not fear me or my home, you have defeated me honorably. I'm impressed.

==Progression==
{{Pet Tamer}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
