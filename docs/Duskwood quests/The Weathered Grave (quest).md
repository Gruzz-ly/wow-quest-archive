This quest starts the {{questchain|The Story of Morgan Ladimore}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Sirra Von'Indi]] in [[Darkshire]].

==Description==
The weathered grave marker reads simply:

MORGAN LADIMORE

<Upon further examination, you notice that dirt over the grave has been recently disturbed, and that a good amount of the dirt seems to have been displaced...>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*510 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with {{F|Stormwind}}

==Completion==
Morgan Ladimore?

Ahh, yes, of course. His was a long and sorrowful tale. I knew him, well, before he left for the war, but that was the last time I saw him. A noble and good man, he was, but he suffered a bad end.

Here, I should have something here that can tell the tale better than my own recollections...

==Notes==
The location of the [[A Weathered Grave|Weathered Grave]] is {{co|17|29|Duskwood}} just north of [[Forlorn Rowe]]. Hold on to this quest until the [[Morbent Fel]] storyline is done, then take a flight path from [[Raven Hill]] back to [[Darkshire]].

==Progression==
{{Morgan Ladimore Cataclysm}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Quest ID changed.}}
