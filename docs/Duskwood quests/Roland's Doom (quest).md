==Objectives==
Search [[Roland's Doom]] for the remaining pages of Stalvan's Journal.  
*[[Muddy Journal Pages]]

==Description==
This isn't all of it...

You should let it go, <name>. The only place left to look is Roland's Doom. That's the mine south of town, and the largest lair of worgen in Duskwood. Nobody in Darkshire has ever made it back from that place alive. In fact, some of the records I have here imply that's where the monsters first came from... who knows what evil's lurking in there?

Please, <name>, just give it up. Let's just forget about this whole thing, and never speak of it again. 

==Progress==
I told you, <name>, it's not worth pursuing.

==Completion==
You actually went and got it?!

I don't know whether to call you brave or insane. But once again, my archives thank you.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Exorcist's Wand
|Daltry's Belt
|Roland's Legguards
|The Clerk's Chain
|Exorcist's Dagger
|Exorcist's Crossbow
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Notes==
Turn in [[The Rotting Orchard (quest)]] and pick up [[In A Dark Corner]] before heading out.

Vile fangs are outside the mine, tainted ones are inside the mine, and the [[Muddy Journal Pages]] is at {{coords|73|79|Duskwood}} at the end of the mine in [[Roland's Doom]].
