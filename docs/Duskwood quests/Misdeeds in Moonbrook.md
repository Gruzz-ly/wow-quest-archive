Meet [[Vanessa VanCleef|Vanessa]] and [[Mathias Shaw|Shaw]] in [[Moonbrook]] in [[Westfall]].

==Description==
Moonbrook? What is this [[Count Clessington]] doing at my home?!

It can't be anything good. I'll signal Shaw.

<Vanessa glances at [[Cecilia Clessington]].>

She might make for a good hostage. Let's bring the rich girl, too.

Meet us there.

* {{cost|2|34}}
* 850 [[XP]]

Why is it... so empty?

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|Say|Cecilia Clessington|Did you just... call me a hostage? Wait, aren't you--}}
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|Vanessa VanCleef, leader of the [[Defias Brotherhood]], "at your service".}}
:''Vanessa bows''
:{{Text|Say|Cecilia Clessington|Oh dear.}}
:''They both mount up and ride away.''

Find them with Shaw on the eastern outskirts of Moonbrook. The two rogues each have a dead [[Clessington Attendant]] lying in front of them. The town is deserted, except for a few attendants.

:{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|Do you see them? There's more of these agents from [[Count Clessington|Clessington]] skulking about.}}
:{{Text|Say|Cecilia Clessington|I had no idea he brought on so many...}}
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|This isn't right. Where is everyone? Where is my Brotherhood?}}

Shaw has new dialogue:
:{{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
:{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|Vanessa, I've been wanting to tell you... I knew [[Edwin VanCleef|your father]]. Long, long ago, as children... we were friends, even.}}
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|I know. He spoke of you. You didn't join his cause, so he hated you.}}
:{{Text|emote|Shaw doesn't quite manage to hide his wince.}}
:{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|Edwin was always a fierce man, but he wasn't always such an angry man.}}
:{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|He could be kind and often remarkably generous. I hope, in the time that you had with him, that kindness still shone through.}}
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|Growing up, I always thought if I was just good enough, just strong enough, I could earn that kindness.}}
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|When he was killed, when YOU ordered him killed, I lost the chance to ever see that side of him. To prove myself to him.}}
:{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|It is never up to a child to earn their parent's kindness. You don't have anything to prove to anyone, Vanessa.}}
:{{Text|Emote|Vanessa looks distant.}}
:{{Text|Emote|Cecilia wipes tears from her cheeks.}}
