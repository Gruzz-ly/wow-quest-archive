==Objectives==
Speak with [[Madame Eva]] in [[Darkshire]]. 

==Description==
Oh, what is a poor old man to do? I need some supplies from [[Darkshire]], but the village is so far away and I am so old and feeble...I would never make the trip.

Can you go to Darkshire and bring me back some [[Ghost Hair Thread]]? You can get it from Madame Eva at her home on the Darkshire square. 

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*830 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, Ghost Hair Thread is what you need, is it?  I'm afraid I have none in stock, but I can make some for you...if you can supply the ghost hair.

==Progression==
