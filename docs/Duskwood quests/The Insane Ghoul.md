'''The Insane Ghoul''' sends the adventurer to defeat a ghoul which has another item needed by Viktori.

==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Insane Ghoul.jpg|Insane Ghoul|He carries the looking glass.  Also, he is insane.}}
Retrieve [[Blind Mary]]'s Looking Glass from the [[Insane Ghoul]].
*[[Mary's Looking Glass]] {{co|81|71|Duskwood}}

==Description==
The looking glass was one of my finest treasures until. . .the incident. After that happened, I discarded it behind the barn. There was an Insane Ghoul who used to roam back there. Perhaps he picked it up. Rumor has it the devilish beast resides in the Tranquil Gardens Cemetery.

==Progress==
I showed Cog the beginnings of our star-viewing machine.  He was impressed.  Did you happen to find a reflective device?

==Completion==
Most superb!  This will work perfectly.  Many thanks! 

==Notes==
Before heading down to the [[Tranquil Gardens Cemetery]], return to [[Darkshire]], turn in [[The Night Watch (quest)]], and pick up [[Bones That Walk]]. Also continue the Abercrombie storyline by completing [[Ghost Hair Thread (quest)]], [[Return the Comb]], [[Deliver the Thread]], and [[Zombie Juice (quest)]], then finally pick up [[Gather Rot Blossoms]]. The ghoul can be found at {{co|81|71|Duskwood}} in an old chapel in the Cemetery.

==Progression==
