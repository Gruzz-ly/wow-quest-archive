'''Classy Glass''' sends the adventurer to defeat an ogre which has another item needed by Viktori.

{{questportrait|Zzarc'Vul.jpg|Zzarc'Vul|Champion of the Stone Fist Clan.}}
== Objectives ==
Kill [[Zzarc'Vul]] in the southern ogre mound in [[Duskwood]] and collect the Ogre Monocle.
*[[Ogre's Monocle]] {{co|37.9|84.3|Duskwood}}

== Description ==
Now there is just one more item needed to complete this device. Cog's blueprint calls for a lens of some sort. The only lens I know of that would be large enough will be very difficult to acquire.

There is an ogre by the name of Zzarc'Vul who resides in the mound in southern Duskwood. If you can, bring to me his monocle and I will use that as our lens!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Stargazer's Pantaloons
|Astronomer's Handwraps
|Starry Band
|Cosmologist's Grips
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
Were you able to convince Zzarc'Vul to lend us his monocle for our experiment?

== Completion ==
At last! The stargazing device is complete! Thank you, <name>. Now I can continue my research. . .

==Notes==
Zzarc'Vul can be found in the [[Vul'Gol Ogre Mound]]. He can spawn in multiple places so you might have to do a little searching around to find him.

Before heading down to the ogre mound, continue the Abercrombie storyline by completing [[Zombie Juice (quest)]], [[Gather Rot Blossoms]], and [[Juice Delivery]], then picking up [[Ogre Thieves]]. On the way there, pick up [[Vulgar Vul'Gol]] from [[Watcher Dodds]], just between the ogre mound and the [[Yorgen Farmstead]].

[[Ambercrombie's Crate]] is on the ground at {{co|33.5|75.3|Duskwood}} just outside the mouth of the cave. [[Zzarc'Vul]] is at the southern end of the cave.
