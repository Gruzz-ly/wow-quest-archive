== Requirements ==
Requires a [[cooking]] skill of 50.

== Objectives ==
Gather 5 Wolf Skirt Steaks from [[Dire Wolf (Duskwood)|Dire Wolves]].
*[[Wolf Skirt Steak]] (5)

== Description ==
Seasoned Wolf Kabobs are a house favorite! Sure, I can make you some. But first I'll need the supplies.

Bring me five wolf skirt steaks. The dire wolves near the river north of town are good to hunt; I wouldn't stray too far into the woods if I were you.

==Rewards==

== Progress ==
Were you able to find five wolf skirt steaks yet?

== Completion ==
Mmm-mmm! The skirtsteak's the best part. It's not an efficient way to cook, though.

Here, have this recipe. It's a little different, but flank meat's easier to come by when you really need a meal.
