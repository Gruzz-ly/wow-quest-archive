The Legend of Stalvan reimagined!

== Objectives ==
Seek out [[Clerk Daltry]] in the [[Darkshire Town Hall]].

== Description ==
I'm here because I received a letter from my brother [[Stalvan Mistmantle|Stalvan]], who I haven't seen in years. On arriving here, I was told he was dead...

The entire town refuses to offer any further explanation. Any mention of his name is met with terror and suspicion. As if I didn't have enough of that myself!

I'm afraid of what will happen if my frustration and anger grows any further. I beg you, help me get to the bottom of this. Implore Clerk Daltry for any information he may have on my brother.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*920 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Completion ==
Can I help you?
