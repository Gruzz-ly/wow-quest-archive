== Objectives ==
Bring Calor's note to Jonathan Carevin. 
*[[Calor's Note]] (provided)

== Description ==
Here you go, <name>. Bring this message to Master Carevin.

<He quickly removes a piece of faded parchment and offers it to you.>

A few more like you, and [[Carevin family|we]] will outnumber the Night Watch! Perhaps then we could complete the work that we few carry on today.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Vigilante's Gloves
|Cold Boots
|Carevin's Breastplate
|Callous Greaves
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
Yes, what is it? Make it quick, I've pressing matters to attend to. 

== Completion ==
Excuse me for my cold reception, <name>, but as I'm sure you can tell, I am an extremely busy man. I see that you have impressed Calor--and I assure you, that is no small feat--and that he has given his recommendation.

There are unsavory types afoot, <name>, and we can use the help of all who have proven themselves. We battle against demons, the undead, and those who would provide them aid. Be vigilant, be wary, and trust none who would not give aid to our cause.

Glory under the Light.

== Notes ==
Carevin is inside the house Calor is standing outside of.

There is no immediate followup, so continue the Legend of Stalvan storyline.
