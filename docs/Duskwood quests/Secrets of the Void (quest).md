==Objectives==
Recover Natalie's Journal from [[Twilight Lord Urgrok]].

* [[Natalie's Journal]]

==Description==
Our leader was murdered for her beliefs, or so most would believe.

[[Natalie Seline]] knew her fate, and took steps to protect herself from an inevitable death.

The night her attackers came, Natalie sent her spirit to the [[Void]], its location known only to Natalie herself.

She penned a spell to retrieve it in one of her many journals, but the tome has since fallen into the hands of those who wished her dead in the first place.

Without her journal, we will never be able to recover her spirit.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We watch over Natalie's body, forever hopeful that her spirit will return.

==Completion==
This is it! This is the journal that contains the spell to locate Natalie's spirit!

==Notes==
Fly from [[Raven Hill Cemetery]] to [[Brightwood Grove]]. You will find the Twilight Lord there amidst a small group of [[Twilight Cultist (Duskwood)|Twilight Cultists]].

==Progression==
{{Priest artifact and class hall}}
