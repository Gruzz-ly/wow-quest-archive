== Objectives ==
Collect 5 pieces of Corpseweed.
*[[Corpseweed]] x5

== Description ==
I need large amounts of corpseweed for {{npc||Oliver Harris||Master Harris's}} concoctions. It's difficult to obtain, but we can't let our supply dwindle.

Corpseweed is tough stuff to tangle with... the plant will get you before you get it, if you're not careful! But if you'd like to help out, I'll eagerly pay you for any you gather yourself.

You'll find plenty of it all over the Yorgen Stead to the southeast. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Corpseweed Sickle
|Festering Bracers
|Potioner's Vest
|Cloak of Sanity
|Fess' Chain Apron
|Corpseweed Hewer
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

== Progress ==
Do you have the corpseweed? 

== Completion ==
I thank you, <class>... and I'm sure the worgen that may be returned to sanity with the potion this will make would thank you too.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Yorgen Worgen]] before entering the [[Yorgen Farmstead]].

[[Corpseweed]]s are ambulatory plants, so kill them to collect them. The [[Mound of Loose Dirt]] is at {{co|49.9|77.7|Duskwood}} between the farmhouse and the stables. Interact with it and a Lurking Worgen will jump out from the woods and knock the adventurer down, stunning it, before jumping away behind the stables.

==Progression==
{{Raven Hill Worgen}}
