==Objectives==
Examine the Mound of Loose Dirt at the [[Yorgen Farmstead]].
*[[Mound of Loose Dirt]] {{co|49.9|77.7|Duskwood}}

==Description==
My kinsmen at [[Raven Hill]] are concerned with curing the feral worgen in these forests. The condition itself cannot be lifted, but sanity can be restored to those not too far gone.

While most here have proven beyond help, we keep an eye out for those that retain vestiges of their minds... attachments to their old lives.

I've seen a lone worgen lurking the Yorgen Farmstead, digging in a pile of dirt between the buildings...could you check out that pile and see if he's left anything?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||17}}

==Progress==
Did you go look yet?

==Completion==
Sounds like a close call! But he ran off without harming you further...

He might be still fighting it. [[Oliver Harris|Master Harris]] must know!

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Deadly Vine]] before entering the [[Yorgen Farmstead]].

[[Corpseweed]]s are ambulatory plants, so kill them to collect them. The [[Mound of Loose Dirt]] is at {{co|49.9|77.7|Duskwood}} between the farmhouse and the stables. Interact with it and a Lurking Worgen will jump out from the woods and knock the adventurer down, stunning it, before jumping away behind the stables.
