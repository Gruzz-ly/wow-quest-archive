==Objectives==
Bring the Mistmantle Family Ring to [[Madame Eva]].
*[[Mistmantle Family Ring]] (provided)

==Description==
This can't be. My brother was strong-willed, but such vileness... such sickness and violent, bloody evil...

<Tobias brings a hand to his face, averting his gaze.>

I must have answers. I need to know how I got that letter. I need to know if Stalvan really did this.

I need to know why...

Take my ring, <name>. Bring it to Madame Eva. That woman is a follower of old arts and makes no secret of it... call it madness, but I'll try anything at this point.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||8}}
*920 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What dark whispers guide you to my door, <class>?

==Completion==
How interesting. It's been quite a while since I've seen such a ring...
