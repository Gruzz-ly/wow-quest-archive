==Objectives==
Escort [[Revil Kost]] from [[Manor Mistmantle]] in [[Duskwood]] to [[Ariden's Camp]] in [[Deadwind Pass]].
* Follow Revil to Ariden's Camp
* Reached Outside Ariden's Camp

==Description==
In my previous confrontation with your foe, I was able to see a glimpse into their past. Granted blessed vision by the [[Cloak of Purity]], I saw the [[Dark Riders]] for who they once were. Come, we must go to [[Ariden's Camp]] in [[Deadwind Pass]]. I can explain its significance along the way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|16|20|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It's strange that the Dark Riders haven't followed us here, but I will take whatever boon I can get.

I believe the key to finding the Dark Riders is here somewhere. Let us begin our search.

==Notes==
On accept, Revil runs out of [[Manor Mistmantle]] as two [[Dark Rider (mob)|Dark Riders]] appear.
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|It seems you've been followed, druid! Dark Riders!}}
:{{text|yell|Dark Rider|None will be spared!}}

After defeating the riders, Revil mounts up on his horse.
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|The battle is won, but there will be more. Quickly, to Ariden's camp!}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|The Dark Riders were not always like this. They were once a group of traveling merchants.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Unfortunately they crossed the sorcerer [[Medivh]], who cursed them to an eternity of hunting artifacts for him.}}

A Dark Rider emerges from the woods behind you and Revil.
:{{text|yell|Revil Kost|Look out behind you!}}
:{{text|yell|Dark Rider|We will take what is ours!}}

After defeating the rider:
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Your skill in combat is impressive. We may yet survive this.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|[[Ariden]] was the first of the Dark Riders, and I believe he leads them now.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|His camp is still in Deadwind Pass, strangely untouched after all these years.}}
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|If my convictions are correct, the key to finding the Dark Riders, as well as the artifacts they still covet, can be found there.}}

Two more riders appear from the north.
:{{text|yell|Revil Kost|Riders on our flank! Be ready!}}
:{{Text|yell|Dark Rider|The artifact calls to us!}}

;After defeating the riders
:{{Text|say|Revil Kost|Let us press on. We are nearly there.}}

Upon reaching the destination:
:{{text|say|Revil Kost|Here! The camp is in this clearing. Let us search it.}}

Lingering behind during the journey will cause Revil to yell one of several lines until you catch up.
*{{text|yell|Revil Kost|Do you wish to be left behind? Hurry!}}
*{{text|yell|Revil Kost|Quickly! We don't have time to linger!}}
*{{text|yell|Revil Kost|Try to keep up, druid!}}

In case Revil despawns, return to Manor Mistmantle:
{{Gossip|Let's head to Ariden's camp.}}
