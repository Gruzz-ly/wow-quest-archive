== Objectives ==
Watch [[Oliver Harris]] and [[Jitters]] attempt to cure the [[Lurking Worgen]]. 
* Worgen cured

== Description ==
I'm hopeful, but let's remain professional. It's business as usual for this one.

Into the guillotine he goes... and if the alchemy doesn't take, he won't be getting back out of it.

Jitters and I will attend to this. Please, just stand back and watch from a safe distance. 

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Consecrated Scepter]]
*[[Moon Shriek Bracers]]
*[[Shield of Darkshire]]
*[[Curse Breaker's Bindings]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost||10|}}
* 710 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]
* [[Waning Wood Fence]]

==Completion==
Success... Finally! I can't thank you enough for giving me the chance to work the cure myself.

Our new friend may be in need of some help as well. You might want to speak with him.

==Notes==
After accepting the quest, the following event is triggered, revealing that the Lurking Worgen is [[Sven Yorgen]]:
