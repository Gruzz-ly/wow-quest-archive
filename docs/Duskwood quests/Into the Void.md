==Objectives==
Read Natalie's Journal at the catacomb's shadow altar to enter the [[void]] and recover her spirit.
* Read [[:Natalie's Journal]] at the Altar of Shadow
* Follow the void trail
* Free [[Natalie Seline]]'s spirit

==Description==
This is without a doubt Natalie's writing. The entry was scrawled in haste, but the message is clear: The spell within this journal will lead us to Natalie's spirit, but it needs to be incanted at a shadow altar within the catacombs.

[[Odessa Belford|Odessa]] and I have a duty to watch over Natalie's body, but with your considerable power, you should be able to perform the spell with ease.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The lure of the Void is strong. There were times I thought I would be lost there forever.

Thank you for freeing me, <name>.

==Notes==
The [[Dawning Wood Catacombs]] are straight ahead from Natalie Seline's grave. Upon entering the catacombs, continue straight on to reach the altar. After performing the incantation, follow the trail of void energy until you reach Natalie. The are is full of [[Void Essence]]s. [[Silent Shade]]s, [[Clattering Coldwraith]]s, [[Flesh Eater]]s, [[Bone Chewer]]s, [[Plague Spreader (Duskwood)|Plague Spreader]]s, and [[Rotted One]]s are also present, but they don't attack. She is possessed by a Void Essence and you will have to fight her.

Follow her out of the catacombs and fly back to the eastern side of the cemetery.
