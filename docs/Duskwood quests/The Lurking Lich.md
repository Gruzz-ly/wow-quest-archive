== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Sister Elsington]].

== Description ==
The others here share my suspicion. [[Morbent Fel]] lives on in undeath...and may be even more powerful than before. A [[necromancer]] was struck down, but a [[lich]] may have risen in his place. And now he continues to ruin this land.

I remember [[Duskwood]] before all this, <name>. I remember bright skies and peaceful woods. This can't stand! Morbent Fel must be stopped for good.

Speak to Sister Elsington. Her vision might guide you to where Morbent Fel is, and how he can be defeated.

== Completion ==
It's heartening to see one so recently recovered be so concerned with the plight of others. Sven spares himself suffering by not dwelling on his own misfortune.
