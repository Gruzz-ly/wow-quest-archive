== Objectives ==
Find the denizen of the tower at [[Beggar's Haunt]]. 

== Description ==
I've been told there's signs of activity at Beggar's Haunt. People have reported seeing lights in the tower to the east of town.

Few would be bold enough to stay that close to [[Deadwind Pass]]. You're the first to report since I've learned about this; go check it out and make sure whatever's in there is human. 

==Rewards==
You will gain:
*830 [[XP]]

== Completion ==
Ah, welcome, stranger. I'd offer you something, but there's not much here...

Could I beg you to run some errands for a poor old hermit?

== Notes ==
*The Hermit's name is [[Abercrombie]] and he is located in a tower east of [[Darkshire]] off the path that leads to [[Deadwind Pass]].

==Progression==
{{Abercrombie Duskwood}}
