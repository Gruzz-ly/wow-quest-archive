This quest concludes the quest chain {{questchain|The Story of Morgan Ladimore}}.

==Objectives==
Take [[Sarah Ladimore]]'s ring to [[Morgan Ladimore]]'s grave.
*[[Sarah's Ring]] (provided)

==Description==
Here, take this and lay it on his grave. Maybe... somehow, he'll know that I'm okay, and that none of us hold him responsible for what happened.

<There are tears in her eyes now, as she slides a ring from her right hand, and presses it into your hands.>

And... thank you, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1980 [[XP]] (110 XP at grey level)
*[[Restored Archeus]] or [[Refurbished Archeus]] or [[Reconditioned Archeus]]

==Progress==
Leave me be...

==Completion==
<A ghostly voice sounds on the wind...>

This is...? Sarah? Could it be she's still alive? The weight is removed from my shoulders...

<Name>. Take my sword, Archeus. As my soul is put to rest, I have no more need for it. It was forged to do good, and though I have proved myself unworthy to hold it, perhaps you will carry on the [[Light]] through it.

[[Lys Ladimore|Lys]], my love...

==Notes==
*Fly back to [[Raven Hill]] for the last time, then run north past [[Forlorn Rowe]] to the grave.

On completion:
:''The spectral form of Morgan Ladimore appears above the grave.''
: {{text|say|Morgan Ladimore|My sword Archeus served me well in life, but as at last my spirit may pass from the unhappy existence, I need it no longer.}}
: {{text|say|Morgan Ladimore|I shall cling to the life of my daughter and hope that I will find forgiveness under the Light for my sins.}}

==Progression==
{{Morgan Ladimore Cataclysm}}

==Patch changes==
*{{patch 7.3.5|note=[[Refurbished Archeus]] and [[Reconditioned Archeus]] added as a reward.}}
*{{patch 4.0.3a|note=Quest ID changed, now awards [[Restored Archeus]] instead of [[Archeus]].}}
