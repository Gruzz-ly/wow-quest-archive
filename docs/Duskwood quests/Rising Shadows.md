==Objectives==
Return to [[Alonsus Faol]] at [[Netherlight Temple]].

==Description==
News of my return will spread fast among those who share my beliefs. Soon [[Azeroth]] will see the rise of Shadows, but I imagine this is not news to you.

Whatever your plan may be, I hope it continues to see the [[Cult of Forgotten Shadow]]s as allies.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|94|}}

==Completion==
The [[Forsaken]] will rejoice at [[Natalie Seline]]'s return, and we will as well, knowing that the prophecy is being fulfilled.

==Notes==
