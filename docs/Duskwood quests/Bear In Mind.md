== Objectives ==
Collect 8 Black Bear Brains from [[Coalpelt Bear]]s.
*[[Black Bear Brain]] (8)

== Description ==
I'm afraid that... well, I'm just plain afraid, but I'm also sorry to have to ask for another favor.

{{npc||Oliver Harris||Master Harris}} needs brains. Bear brains. They're part of the serum apparently, or at least a proper substitute.

There's plenty of black bears in the woods to the west, and along the riverbank, but... I can't do it! I'm too terrified to go out there and face those huge things, even with a rifle. Please, let me pay you to bring back some! 

==Rewards==

* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
Did you get them? Did you? 

== Completion ==
Thank you! Oh, thank you. I never thought I'd be happy to smell those brains, but I am now that I didn't have to get them!

Here's your reward as promised...
