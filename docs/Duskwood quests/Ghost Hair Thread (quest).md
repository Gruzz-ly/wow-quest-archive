== Objectives ==
Bring the Spectral Comb to [[Blind Mary]].
* [[Spectral Comb]] (provided)

== Description ==
There is a poor, sad spirit, Blind Mary, who haunts an old farm house in the hills south of [[Darkshire]].

Here, take this Spectral Comb and ask Blind Mary to comb her hair. Then bring back the comb and I will glean from it the Ghost Hair I'll need for [[Ghost Hair Thread|the thread]].

And take care, for dark things now lurk near that house... 

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*830 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
<Sob> Oh please, don't look at me!  I tore out these eyes with my own hands, but I can still feel your gaze!

I'm hideous!  Hideous!  Please, look away!!

== Completion ==
What is this?  A comb?  It's lovely!  And it glides through my hair as if it weren't the stiff, stringy horror that it is.

Oh, if only I had a mirror...

== Notes ==
Before heading south, pick up [[Look To The Stars]] from [[Viktori Prism'Antras]] and [[The Night Watch (quest)]] from [[Commander Althea Ebonlocke]]. Both quests take place in the same area.
