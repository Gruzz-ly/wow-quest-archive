==Completion==
You pulled my spirit from the [[Void]], which is no easy feat. I cannot deny the part of me that would stay there forever, embraced by the shadows.

The Void is filled with many whispers, <name>. The kind that should have us all worried.

We cannot afford to be separated by our beliefs. We must come together as priests of both [[Light]] and Shadow to face the [[Burning Legion]] together.

==Rewards==
You will gain these followers:
*[[Natalie Seline]]
