==Objectives==
Investigate the manor at [[Raven Hill]] in [[Duskwood]].
*Clessington Manor investigated
*[[Cecilia Clessington|Cecilia]] escorted from the building
*Circumstances explained to Cecilia

==Description==
Excellent, <name>. Finally, something we can work with.

[[Count Clessington]] is a member of the [[House of Nobles]] and a powerful [[mage]]. He has fallen on hard times since [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] cracked down on corruption in [[Stormwind]].

I would not put it past him to have something to do with this.

He recently purchased an old manor in Duskwood. I will contact my sources and see what other information I can find. You and [[Vanessa VanCleef|Vanessa]] should go to the manor and investigate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you feel that?

This place is creepy. I swear every now and then something brushes by me. The hairs on the back of my neck keep going straight up!

==Completion==
You have my deepest apologies, friend, for the behavior of my [[Clessington Attendant|"attendants"]]. 

Though, I suppose they were never mine. They're my father's. Likely sent with me to keep me out of his way while he does something terrible.

I had hoped it wouldn't come to this. I'm so sorry. Please, let me help you stop him.

==Notes==
;On accept
:''Vanessa turns to Shaw.''
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|Oh goodness! Could it be that there's a corrupt noble causing trouble in Stormwind? What a surprise!}}
:{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|The House of Nobles has seen great strides in rooting out corruption, since Anduin's reign. I've overseen much of it myself, Vanessa.}}
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|Well, clearly it wasn't enough.}}
:''Vanessa turns and leaves the cellar, using [[Vanish]] as she reaches the stairs.''

Find [[Cecilia Clessington]] in her manor at [[Raven Hill]] in [[Duskwood]]. Several [[Clessington Attendant]]s are found in the building.

:{{Text|Say|Cecilia Clessington|What was my father thinking? This place is a disaster. We'll never turn a profit...}}

Talk to her:
:<She does not appear to notice you.>

:{{Gossip|What do you know about the [[:Drakefire Amulet]]?}}

:''A hostile attendant rushes into the room and aggroes. The remaining attendants are how hostile as well.''
:{{Text|Say|Clessington Attendant|That's none of your business!}}
:{{Text|Say|Cecilia Clessington|Attendants, stop! What are you doing?}}
:{{Text|Say|Clessington Attendant|We answer to your father, not you!}}
:{{Text|Say|Cecilia Clessington|Curses! I knew something wasn't right. Let's get out of here, stranger!}}

Escort Cecilia out of the manor and around the corner to find Vanessa waiting.
:{{Text|Say|Cecilia Clessington|This way! Just--oh!}}
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|Thanks for doing all the work, <name>. I figured you wouldn't want me in your way. Now, who is this?}}
:{{Text|Say|Cecilia Clessington|I am Cecilia Primrose Clessington the Second, at your service. Now, what has happened with the Drakefire Amulet?}}

Speak with Cecilia again:
My family was once large and prominent in the House of Nobles. 

Now, with war after war, it's just me and my father left. And my father is a bit... old fashioned. He won't accept that our household just isn't what it used to be.

That led him to some... questionable decisions, trying to "restore us to power." Then King Anduin cracked down on the House and, well, things have never been worse for us. 

I try not to care about all that. I'm just trying to keep a roof over our heads. It doesn't matter to me if it isn't gilded.

:{{Gossip|<Tell Cecilia that the Drakefire Amulet has been stolen.>}}
:{{Text|Say|Cecilia Clessington|I should have known. My father just sent me here to get me out of his way.}}
:{{Text|Say|Cecilia Clessington|He's been raving about the Drakefire Amulet and "restoring our family's glory" for years! I try to reason with him, but he doesn't listen. Sometimes his obsession... scares me.}}
:{{Text|Say|Cecilia Clessington|If the amulet has been stolen, I'm certain it was his doing. And I'd wager he took it to [[Moonbrook]], where he's been off "doing business".}}
