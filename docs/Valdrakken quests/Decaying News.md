==Objectives==
Gather 10 Rotting Samples from the decay [[gnoll]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Dothenos]] of the [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Rotting Sample]] (10)

==Description==
The gnolls and their use of [[decay]] [[magic]] are concerning. We need to gather as much knowledge as we can, in case the threat escalates.

As [[alchemist]]s, we are used to gathering such foul substances safely--plus, we're used to the smell. Will you lend your aid?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Alchemy Notes]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered the Rotting Samples?

==Completion==
We will research these samples and see if we can come up with an alchemical solution to this looming problem.

==Patch changes==
