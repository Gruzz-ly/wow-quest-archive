==Objectives==
Play with the Ruby Hatchling.
*Tag started with [[Ruby Hatchling]]
*Hatchling chased to nest

==Description==
Our red hatchling seems to be having quite the trouble making friends. Any time she tries to get one to play, it tends to end quickly.

She can be a bit pushy, but [[whelp]]s are whelps. Why don't you get her in the right mindset to play with some tag?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Every whelp loves a game of tag!

==Completion==
<[[Agapanthus]] sighs.>

I can already tell that whelp is going to be quite the handful.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Ruby Hatchling|Listen!}}
:{{Text|say|Ruby Hatchling|No, not like that!}}
:{{Text|say|Ruby Hatchling|You're so boring!}}
:{{Text|say|Ruby Hatchling|Do you understand how to play yet?}}

:{{Text|say|Ruby Hatchling|Haven't you played this game before?}}
:{{Text|say|Ruby Hatchling|I didn't say you could move yet!}}

;At the nest
:{{Text|say|Ruby Hatchling|Hmph. Next time, I'm the tagger!}}

;Upon completion
