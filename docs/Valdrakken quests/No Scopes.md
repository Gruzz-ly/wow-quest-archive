==Objectives==
Craft 15 Bronze Fireflight for [[Clinkyclick Shatterboom]] in [[Valdrakken]].

==Description==
Great gadgets, sparky, do I have a big one for you today!

Apparently, some [[firework]] fad caught on with the hunters. They try setting them off to scare the [[duck]]s into the air. Bet the ducks are way to smart for that, but it won't stop us from profiting! Think you're up to the task?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Engineering Details]]

==Progress==
<Clinkyclick is muttering to herself as she looks for something.>

==Completion==
Thanks, sparky! That should take care of this until they come up with some new hare-brained scheme.

Here, take these schematics. I bet there's something in there you didn't know.
