'''A Key Story''' begins the eighth day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Objectives==
Seek out [[Weaponsmith Koref]] and interview him about the key.

==Description==
Here for the latest? Well, have I got news for you.

A weaponsmith was just here visiting [[Tithris]]. Koref, I think? Couldn't help but overhear their discussion about some sort of ancient key. Might be of interest to you, what with all your artifact hunting.

Weaponsmith Koref was headed back to the [[Obsidian Enclave]]. You should head there and get the scoop about this ancient key.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[The Blacksmith and the Apprentice]]

==Completion==
Have you ever heard of the Titan Key? Tall as a [[dwarf]], magically imbued. The [[titan]]s used a special mold to forge the key, but it's been lost for ages. 

However, as fortune would have it, Tithris found a book that he believes leads to that very mold! Problem is, the text isn't exactly straightforward. And I'm terrible at reading between the lines.

But hey, with all your experience finding artifacts, maybe you could give it a shot! I'd be happy to forge the key if you find the mold.

==Notes==
The note reads:

{{:The Blacksmith and the Apprentice}}

[[File:Ancient Key Mold.jpg|thumb|[[Titan Key Mold]]]]
The [[Cloverwood Hollow]] is in central [[Ohn'ahran Plains]], marked on the zone map, southeast of [[Maruukai]]. In a ruined building in the [[Sylvan Glade]], equip the [[Torch of Pyrreth]] and look for a [[Hastily Scrawled Stone]] at {{co|63.4|56.9|Ohn'ahran Plains}} on the ground by a broken table. It reads:

{{book|content=<Hastily scrawled numbers are visible on the enchanted plaque. (-3, -2). Did the apprentice know about coordinate system the titan's{{sic}} used?>
}}

Re-equip the [[Tricked-Out Thinking Cap]] to reset it to (0, 0), and the [[Idol of Ohn'ahra]], then navigate to (-3, -2) or {{co|63.0|57.4|Ohn'ahran Plains}} to find an [[Ancient Key Mold]] hidden in the leaves. The idol will point in the direction of the mold. Interact with it to pick up the [[Titan Key Mold]], which starts [[A Titanic Mold]].
