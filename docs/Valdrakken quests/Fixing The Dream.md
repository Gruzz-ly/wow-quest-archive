==Description==
[[Engineering]] is an exact science! When something explodes, [[engineer]]s plan it that way.

Dreams are not exact, especially emerald ones! Someday, someone will want engineers to fix the dream, and we won't know how to do it. We need a lot more information to understand what we're dealing with!

Go to the dream and place research beacons at my designated points. They will gather the information needed for any future repairs. Use this handy teleport device if you want to find the locations quickly.

==Completion==
So much useful data about the dream, it will keep the engineers busy for years.
