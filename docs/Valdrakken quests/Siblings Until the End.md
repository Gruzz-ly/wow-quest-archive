==Objectives==
Speak with [[Vyranoth]].
* Speak with Vyranoth

==Description==
<Name>, lest you rest too long on your laurels, I bear dire news.

Some time ago, I received an unexpected summons... from [[Iridikron]].

Though I informed [[Alexstrasza]], my erstwhile brother made it clear that I was to arrive alone. And so I did.

You will want to hear what he had to say.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Iridikron had much to say...

==Completion==
I know not what Iridikron intends to do next. But I can no longer call him "brother."

==Notes==
Speak with Vyranoth again:

{{dialogue|The view from here has given me more ample perspective than I originally imagined.

{{gossip|Aspect of Storms?}}

A title I chose myself, for many reasons.

Blessed by [[Azeroth (titan)|Azeroth]], our world's primal fury now courses through me--relentless as a hailstorm, howling with frozen winds. I stand as well for the [[Thorignir]] and the [[Netherwing]], and the storms they call home.

And finally, I sought to honor my fallen sister one final time. [[Raszageth|Razsageth]]{{sic}}, the Storm-Eater, who gave me the gift of freedom. One that I would share with all dragonkind.

{{gossip|quest=|Tell me of your meeting with Iridikron.}}

A [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|pre-rendered cinematic]] plays:

{{#ev:youtube|MpvvfD0Iz8U}}
:''[[Forbidden Reach]], exterior, day. Vyranoth flies in at great speed from west to east across the center of the island, circling around and landing to the south above the [[Frosted Spine]]. She speaks from offscreen:''
:{{text|bossemote|Vyranoth|[VO] I had received a missive from Iridikron. He wished to speak with me, and me alone.}}
:''She lands, and beneath the conveniently-placed cliff edge and pine tree, transforms into her [[Dragon#Shapeshifting|visage]] form with a whoosh. Thunder rumbles in the distance as she walks into the clearing.''
:{{text|bossemote|Vyranoth|I am here.}}
:''From offscreen, [[Iridikron]] answers. Vyranoth cannot place him as she looks around.''
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|[VO] It seems your courage has not faltered, despite abandoning our war.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Vyranoth|That war is over, Iridikron. It was you who abandoned our cause, who abandoned [[Fyrakk]] to his own destruction. All for some trinket [[Deathwing|Neltharion]] left behind.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|[VO] The [[Dark Heart|Darkheart]] is no mere trinket.}}
:''The top of the mount behind Vyranoth explodes as Iridikron spreads his wings.''
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|Its power now lies in the [[Xal'atath|Harbinger's]] hands.}}
:''Iridikron gets his footing, then leaps off what's left of the mountaintop and lands with a great deal of force a short distance from Vyranoth.''
:{{text|bossemote|Vyranoth|The [[Void]] cannot be trusted.}}
:''With a whoosh and a flash of light, Iridikron shifts to his visage form offscreen, then walks up to Vyranoth.''
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|I trust it's hunger. You know the [[Titan]]s infected our world, and I will see them extinguished.}}
:''He closes the gap with Vyranoth.''
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|The question is, sister, will you?}}
:''Vyranoth glares at him for a beat.''
:{{text|bossemote|Vyranoth|I will have no part of this.}}
:''Iridikron hums in acknowledgment.''
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|Then the bond of the [[Primal Incarnates|Incarnates]] is truly ended.}}
:''He turns and walks away from Vyranoth.''
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|You will not see me again until the Titans face their reckoning. But to you, Vyranoth, I offer one final warning.}}
:''He stops and looks at her as a cloud of dust gets kicked up, hiding his transformation back to [[proto-dragon]] form. From offscreen, he says ominously:''
:{{text|bossemote|Irdikron|[VO] Stay out of my way.}}
