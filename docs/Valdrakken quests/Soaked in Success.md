==Objectives==
Gather 18 Waterproof Hide from the [[riverbeast]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Temnaayu]] of the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]].
*[[Waterproof Hide]] (18)

==Description==
Fishermen of our tribe are constantly plagued with waterlogged packs and boots. Lately, the riverbeasts have been swarming fishing spots and causing even more mayhem.

The hide of the riverbeasts are quite slick and water-resistant. Perhaps we can handle two problems at once. If you could help handle the over abundance of riverbeasts and bring back their hides, our fishers would be quite pleased.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Leatherworking Designs

==Progress==
Have you found some hide with waterproof qualities?

==Completion==
I am confident that these hides will do well to protect our equipment from further water damage. Thank you for your help.
