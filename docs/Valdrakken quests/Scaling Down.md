==Objectives==
Gather 2 Lustrous Scaled Hides for [[Ralathor the Rugged]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Lustrous Scaled Hide]] (2)

==Description==
Scales have a multitude of purposes--they offer protection, but in some cases, they also offer a keen reflective surface. Many of our finest mirrors are in fact scales.

Those mirrors also happen to be in high demand. Gather some scaled hides for me, and I'll share some of my crafting secrets.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Skinning Field Notes]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Artisan's Consortium - Dragon Isles Branch]]

==Progress==
Have you found any hides?

==Completion==
Ah! These will work perfectly. Your skills continue to impress me.

As promised, take these notes. I'm sure you can learn more from them.

==Notes==
The Lustrous Scaled Hides have to be silver quality.

==Patch changes==
