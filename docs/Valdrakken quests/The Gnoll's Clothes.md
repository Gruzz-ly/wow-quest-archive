==Objectives==
Gather 20 Gnoll-Worn Cloth from the [[gnoll]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Dothenos]] of the [[Valdrakken Accord]].
*[[Gnoll-Worn Cloth]] (20)

==Description==
The gnolls are a constant threat, launching bloody raids and attacks against the expeditions and peoples of the Dragon Isles. So how are their clothes so clean?

After your battles with these raiders, could you collect a sample of their worn cloth for me to analyze?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Tailoring Examples]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the Gnoll-Worn Cloth?

==Completion==
Thank you for these samples. On casual inspection it seems to just be [[:wildercloth]] stolen from the [[tuskarr]], but I'll have our tailors really examine the stitching to be sure.
