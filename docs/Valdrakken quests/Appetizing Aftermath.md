Help put the [[Little Scales Daycare]] back into order.

==Description==
Today's activities were interrupted by a spontaneous food fight. This has attracted several undesirable visitors to the daycare!

Please help clean up.

* {{cost|12|87}}

==Progress==
It is interesting, being a janitor, educator, and minder, but I suppose that is what all caretakers become.

==Completion==
I wish it were possible for all this to just stay clean for a few minutes!

In any case, thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
[[Dreadsquall Hatchling]]s are terrorizing [[Scared Whelp]]s. Lost Sands are by the playground. [[Hungry Crawler]]s appear when approaching the food on the ground.

:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|One whelp feeds them and they all hurry back.}}
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|We need anti-bird measures. A magical field to repel them, a sentry to shoo them away every day, something...}}
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|Lasztak, focus. Are the birds a problem worth that effort?}}
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|...No, I suppose not. Besides spooking a whelp here or there, they are mostly harmless.}}
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|Right. We can take care of them. Or, our friend can chase them off when we are busy.}}
