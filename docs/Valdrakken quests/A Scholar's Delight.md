==Objectives==
Gather supplies for the [[Azure Hatchling (Valdrakken)|Azure Hatchling]]'s nest.

Awakened Frost can be collected from many [[elemental]]s across the [[Dragon Isles]], created by combining 10 [[:Rousing Frost]], or bought from the [[auction house]].
*[[Fine-Pointed Quill]]
*[[Awakened Frost]]
*[[Blue Dragon Bedtime Story]]
*Nest pieces placed (3)

==Description==
[[Blue dragon]]s are seekers of knowledge, even from an early age. They seem drawn to books and scrolls, finding the most comfort when surrounded by them.

For our azure hatchling, the best nest is truly amongst our many books. I request that you collect the following for his nest--a quill of his own to learn to write, something to keep him nice and cold, and a bedtime story from [[Azure Span]]. I have heard tale of one that many blue dragons remember fondly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I have raised dozens of [[blue whelp]]s at all stages of life. At this point, their needs are second nature to me.

==Completion==
A nest amongst the books--perfect for a young blue dragon.

==Notes==
Head to the [[Upper Frostlands]] and kill [[Snowspine Snuffler]]s to loot the [[Fine-Pointed Quill]].

The [[Blue Dragon Bedtime Story]] is obtained from [[Vel Tal IX]] in the [[Conjured Biscuit Inn]]:
:{{Gossip|quest=|Do you have any books appropriate for a blue dragonwhelp?}}
:{{Text|say|Vel Tal IX|The dragons used to love this book. They always said it reminded them of their childhood.}}

With all the items return to the daycare and place the items at the silhouettes.
