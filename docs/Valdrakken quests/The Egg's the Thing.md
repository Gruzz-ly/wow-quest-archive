==Objectives==
Speak with [[Ilana]] at [[Rusza'thar Reach]] in the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].

==Description==
"All the world's an egg." That is how the saying goes, right?

Eggs! They are the core of confections, and one of the great catalysts of culinary creation! They are the fat that puts acids, heats, and salts on their highest pedestals, to their highest potentials!

[[Dragon Isles|Our Isles]] are teeming with fowl of immense strength, but the Breezehunters of the Plains lay eggs primed with flavor!

They often nest on the Eastern side of the Plains, so ask around the outpost in Rusza'thar Reach.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|2|25}}
* 2,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh! Hello!

Sorry about the mess here! I mean, I didn't cause it or anything, I'm just apologizing that you have to deal with it.

Not to imply you wouldn't be able to handle it! Just saying that you might be uncomfortable with the state our furniture is currently in.

Not that this is how we want the furniture set up! We don't want it set up like this, we were planning to... uhm...

What did you say you needed?
