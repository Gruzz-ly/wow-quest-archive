==Objectives==
Collect 10 Nightlight Conkerbell Samples and deliver them to [[Garram]] in [[Loamm]].
*[[Nightlight Conkerbell Sample]] (10)

==Description==
Hey there, stranger! I had an idea to run by you.

The mushrooms that grow down in [[Zaralek Cavern]] have thick and powerful mycelium capable of gripping into even the hardest crystals.

Imagine the possibilities with such a material! I had a friend down in Loamm who was trying to work out how to make it into a leather!

Interested? Bring my friend Garram some mushrooms!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Leatherworking Designs

==Progress==
We call those crystal clinging mushrooms Nightlight Conkerbells. Not only do they give off light, they even have a strong enough scent to help guide our noses!

==Completion==
What? There's hardly any mycelium on these!

<Garram thinks.>

I wonder... do they leave it behind in the crystal? 

Hmm... I'll try to grow more here and experiment. Thanks for the help!
