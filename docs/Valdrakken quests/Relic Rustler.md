==Objectives==
Collect 8 Relic Shards.
*[[Relic Shards]] (8)

==Description==
A group of mean, scaly uplanders moved in near the old [[titan]] ruins south of [[Loamm]] and started tearing the place apart.

Rude, but they're sure to have uncovered all sorts of ancient titan scraps. And that stuff is almost always magic in some way.

Grab some and go see what [[Dustmonger Topuiz]] back in Loamm can make of it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Enchanter's Script

==Progress==
I can't wait to see what you uncover!

==Completion==
Amazing! These smell ancient... and just the right sort of tingly!
