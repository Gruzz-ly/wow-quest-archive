==Objectives==
Gather snack orders from [[vendor]]s in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Wheel of Whelpwhisper Brie]]
*[[Bag of Spicy Pet Snacks]]
*[[Box of Leapmaize Crackers]]
*[[Snacks]] placed

==Description==
[[Agapanthus]] says there are more snack orders ready to be retrieved, but we both have our hands full.

Would you run out and collect snacks while we tend the [[whelp]]s?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
*5x [[Flightstones]]

{{itembox|You will receive one from:|Battle Pet Bandage
|Beast Battle-Training Stone
|Polished Pet Charm
}}

==Progress==
Luckily we are not meant to eat the snacks ourselves, just understand what the whelps want so we can provide that. Cheese and crackers are clearly what they desire.

==Completion==
Thank you for bringing in more snacks. This will tide them over for now.

==Notes==
;Approaching [[Gorgonzormu]]
:{{Text|say|Gorgonzormu|Your cheese order is not-that-fresh and ready to go, <name>!}}

;Wheel of Whelpwhisper Brie bought
:{{Text|say|Gorgonzormu|I would suggest a cheese for you to take home as well, but in all your visits, I sense you have more pressing matters at hand.}}

;Approaching [[Kaestrasz]]
:{{Text|say|Kaestrasz|Your order is ready, <name>! I incorporated more chilies so they may be spicy enough for Sir Pringly.}}

:{{Buy|quest=|Show me your wares.}}

;Bag of Spicy Pet Snacks bought
:{{Text|say|Kaestrasz|If he gives you any indication that they are too mild, let me know immediately.}}

;Approaching [[Tithris]]
:{{Text|say|Tithris|Ah, welcome, <name>! Here for more crackers?}}

:{{Buy|quest=|Let me browse your goods.}}

;Box of Leapmaize Crackers bought
:{{Text|say|Tithris|More will be in stock soon, so return any time those little ones need more crackers.}}

Or [[Marinth]] has the same dialogue instead if the Secrets of Azeroth questline has been completed, as he will replaced Tithris.

Return to the daycare, and place the snacks for [[Hungry Whelp]]s.
