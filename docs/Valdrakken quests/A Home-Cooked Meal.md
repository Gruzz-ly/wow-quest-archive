==Objectives==
Gather Roast Duck Delight for the Obsidian Whelp. This can be crafted via the [[cooking]] [[profession]] or purchased from the [[auction house]].
*[[Roast Duck Delight]]
*[[Obsidian Hatchling (Valdrakken)|Obsidian Hatchling]] fed

==Description==
[[Black dragon]] [[whelp]]s need to grow up to be big and strong. Our hatchling here seems quite small, so I believe she will require something hearty and nutritious to help her along her way.

Roast [[duck]] is not only good for your stamina, but also your brain. I think it would be the perfect meal for our young hatchling.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Duck is a delicacy local to the [[Dragon Isles]]. Did you know we have not found them anywhere else in [[Azeroth]]?

==Completion==
Whelps need a good source of energy to grow. They are voracious!

==Notes==
After obtaining the Roast Duck Delight, speak with the Obsidian Hatchling:
:<The Obsidian Hatchling looks up at you with wide eyes.>
