Greetings, mortal. I tend the grounds and the creatures that call them home--even stray [[Proto-dragon|proto-whelps]].

Unfortunately, there are more proto-whelps about than I can reasonably care for.

Hmm, you seem responsible. Would you like to take care of one? Later, if you would like a companion for your, uh, companion, please seek me out again.
