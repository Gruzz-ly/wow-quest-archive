==Objectives==
Find the First Challenge of Tyr in the [[Azure Span]].

==Description==
[[Tyr|Keeper Tyr]] planned for all eventualities. He suspected there would be a need to empower the craftspeople of the realm some day, thus he created the [[Engine of Innovation]]. It possesses the ability to create a unique material that can help an item achieve expertise beyond that of mortal ability.

To ensure his engine would not be misused he created me to oversee any who sought it's power. Only those worthy will be able to unlock the engine's full potential. 

Are you equal to the challenge?
