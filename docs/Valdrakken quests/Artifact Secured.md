'''Artifact Secured''' continues the fourth day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Objectives==
Return the Torch of Pyrreth to [[Preservationist Kathos]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Torch of Pyrreth (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<Returning the torch to Preservationist Kathos might give insight into how it was used.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Torch of Pyrreth]]

==Progress==
Welcome back adventurer, have you found something?

==Completion==
You found the Torch of Pyrreth! There are stories about this in the archives. You say the [[Preservationists]] sent a dispatch on it? 

It's said that the torch can enable ancient devices and illuminates when near other artifacts. I have a way for us to test it out.

Here, you take the torch and keep it safe.

Use the item to learn the toy, then relog to get it to show up in the [[Toy Box]].
