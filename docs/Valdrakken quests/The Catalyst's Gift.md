==Objectives==
Speak to [[Antuka]] in [[Tyrhold]].

==Description==
I have an urgent message for you, [[adventurer]].

The [[Revival Catalyst]] seems to be responding to the land's rumblings--perhaps even your feats!

Miraculously, it now shares its power for nothing in return except one's mere presence.

Antuka will know more. Go with haste, <name>. This is wondrous news.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}

==Completion==
Every other week, the catalyst will grant you enough power to imbue one piece of equipment.

Keeper [[Tyr]] must be watching us. Wherever he is, this is no coincidence.

==Patch changes==
