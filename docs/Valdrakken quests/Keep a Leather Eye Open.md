==Objectives==
Deliver Feral Hide Drums to [[Garamm]] in [[Loamm]].
*[[Feral Hide Drums]] (10)

==Description==
The kith of Loamm request the skills of a [[leatherworker]]! We've heard of the wonders you uplanders make with hides and scales!

We have leatherworkers of our own down below! Miss has heard there's a set of magical drums that make you faster! Is such a thing possible?

Make a delivery to Loamm as soon as you can, won't you?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Barter Brick
|Barter Boulder
}}

==Progress==
Did [[Kayann]] send you? Do you have what I asked for?

==Completion==
Aha! So these are the hastening drums? I'm hoping these will help me move faster and get more work done each day.

We [[niffen]] have drums of our own, but nothing like these! Let's try them out!
