[[Khadgar]] and I will meet you at the Seat of the Aspects momentarily.

You will receive:
* {{cost|112|36}}

==Progress==
What has happened, <name>?

==Completion==
We stand united against the Incarnates, <name>.

Together, we will protect this world.

==Notes==
Kalecgos has special gossip here:
:Raszageth was once like a sibling to the Aspects. It pains me what happened here today.

:We must be vigilant - the Incarnates will seek vengeance for Raszageth once they have gathered their strength. I fear we have not heard the last of them.

As does Khadgar:
:Chasing Iridikron and the others will be a challenge...

:<Khadgar smirks slightly.>

:But so was fighting the Legion. I have no doubts the champions of Azeroth will rise to meet the challenge these Incarnates pose.

Atop the [[Seat of the Aspects]] in [[Valdrakken]], Nozdormu and Alexstrasza are in their visage forms. Speak with her:
:What happened in the Vault of the Incarnates, <name>?

All present have unique gossip:
;Alexstrasza
:With Raszageth's demise the Incarnates are free but in a weakened state. Even so, defeating them will not be an easy task.

:Yet, I cannot help but have hope. Kalecgos is correct. With all our forces united, we stand a chance.

;Nozdormu
:The only thing I can see with surety is darkness. I do not wish to doubt Kalecgos's fervor or Alexstrasza's hope...

:I think perhaps I will trust in them to help lead the way and see what I cannot.

;Kalecgos
:I know that with our flights whole and united and the strength of our allies, we can defeat the Incarnates.

:Your help was crucial in defeating Raszageth, <name>. I hope we can count on you standing with us against whatever we may face.
