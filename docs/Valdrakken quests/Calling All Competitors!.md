==Objectives==
Deliver the flier to [[Calderax]] in the [[Gladiator's Refuge (Valdrakken)|Gladiator's Refuge]] of [[Valdrakken]].

==Description==
The [[Artisan's Consortium]] has struck a deal with the quartermasters of the Gladiator's Refuge!

In addition to the usual selection of powerful combat equipment they offer, worthy combatants can now purchase tokens that can be used in Crafting Orders or one's own crafts to certify the equipment for use in battlegrounds and arenas!

Present this flier to Calderax to receive two complimentary Trophies of Conquest, on us!

- [[Rabul]]

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|Trophy of Conquest
|Greater Trophy of Conquest
}}

==Completion==
Hm, they sure know how to reach their audience.

Here are your trophies as promised. Use these when crafting your own equipment or submitting Crafting Orders and the gear will be comparable in power to what I offer. It is perfect if you are looking for something highly specific or imbued with a certain embellishment... and are willing to put in some extra work.

Questions? Take them to the [[Artisan's Market]].
