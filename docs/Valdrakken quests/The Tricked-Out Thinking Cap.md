'''The Tricked-Out Thinking Cap''' concludes the second day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]]. Players must be wearing the [[Tricked-Out Thinking Cap]] by using the toy from the [[Toy Box]] in order for Fangli to offer this quest.

==Objectives==
Use the [[:Tricked-Out Thinking Cap]] to find Fangli's clues, then return to [[Fangli Hoot]].
*Solve Riddle {{co|64.6|53.7|Valdrakken}}
*[[A Clue: The Thinking Cap]] (provided)

==Description==
The cap has an amazing function: Put it on, and you'll know where you're going! Let's practice!

The arrow above me has a clue on it, to another arrow somewhere in [[Valdrakken]]. And THAT arrow leads to another...

Follow the arrows until you find them all, and the prize at the end!

==Progress==
You must wear your cap at all times while contemplating secrets. You never know what frequencies you might tap into, or who might tapping into yours.

==Completion==
Good work! Now you're a master of thinking!

==Notes==

Fangli provides [[A Clue: The Thinking Cap]], which reads:

Above Fangli's head is a glowing arrow pointing out of the room toward the [[Little Scales Daycare]], that reads:
