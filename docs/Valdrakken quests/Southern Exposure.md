==Objectives==
Travel to [[South Hold Garrison]].
*Travel to South Hold Gate {{co|35.8|82.5|Thaldraszus}}
*[[Guardian Velomir]] aided

==Description==
Based on your discoveries I suspect the [[Primalists]] are attacking [[Commander Eranog]]'s Garrison at South Hold. But, my [[Scalesworn]] cannot leave the city as that would be exactly what the Primalists are hoping for.

I need your help again, <name>. 

Travel to South Hold, see what kind of forces we are facing, and if possible make contact with the garrison guardians there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|13|81}}
* 5,150 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
You have my thanks, and my apologies, stranger. In the heat of battle it is difficult to distinguish a friend from a foe, and there are plenty of foes around.

==Notes==
Head southwest to the [[South Hold Gate]], where [[Guardian Velomir]] has had better days:
:{{text|say|Guardian Velomir|Come to... finish me off? Primalist... scum!}}

Interact with him to bandage him:
:{{text|say|Guardian Velomir|What... Commander Eranog... who are... ahhh, thank you.}}

==Progression==
{{Valdrakken, City of Dragons}}

==Patch changes==
