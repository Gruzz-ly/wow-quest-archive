'''To Tyrhold''' begins the [[Vault of the Incarnates]] storyline.

==Objectives==
Meet [[Alexstrasza]] at the [[Seat of the Aspects]].
*Speak to Alexstrasza
*Travel to [[Tyrhold]]

==Description==
Centuries have passed since the flights last visited [[Tyrhold]].

Nevertheless, we must travel there and investigate if the [[Mother Oathstone]] still functions.

Come, speak with me at the Seat of the Aspects. We must learn about the dangers we may face at Tyr's former stronghold.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
This space seems clear enough.

==Notes==
While storywise this quest takes place after [[Moving On (Thaldraszus)]], it is not necessary to have completed the Thaldraszus storyline in order to accept the quest.

Speak with Alexstrasza:
:Thank you for coming, <name>.

:I am ready to seek out the Mother Oathstone, but first we must learn more about Tyrhold.

:{{gossip|quest=|I am ready.}}

:{{text|say|Watcher Koranos|Should you go there, I cannot guarantee the greeting you will receive.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I understand.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|However, I have faith that with the help of our champion, we can overcome any danger.}}
:''The Aspects shift back to their dragon forms. Alexstrasza flies off.''

Fly due east to [[Tyrhold]]. While in the area, activated titan defense systems target players in flight.
