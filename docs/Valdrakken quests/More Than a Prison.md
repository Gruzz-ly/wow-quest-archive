==Objectives==
Bring the Ancient Vault Artifact to [[Lillian Brightmoon]].
*[[Ancient Vault Artifact]] (provided)

==Description==
<The ancient artifact appears elemental in nature. Lillian Brightmoon in [[Valdrakken]] might be able to tell more.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]
*200x [[Dragon Isles Supplies]]

==Progress==
Have you brought me something to study?

==Completion==
The [[Primal Incarnates|Incarnates]] were locked away in the [[Vault of the Incarnates|Vault]], but aside from that we know very little either about it or its prisoners.

Artifacts like this can shed light on their culture, their history, and... their power. Studying them could improve our odds in defeating the [[primalists]]. Bring me more of these I will reward you with supplies.

Oh, and I will pen a note to [[Cataloger Jakes|Caretaker Jakes]] reminding her of your continued assistance of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]].
