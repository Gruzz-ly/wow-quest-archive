==Objectives==
Collect 10 Scaly Stone Hides from [[rock viper]]s in [[Zaralek Cavern]].
*[[Scaly Stone Hide]] (10)

==Description==
I'm sure you've run into some of the mean beasties we have down in Zaralek while you were on your adventures! Have you seen any rock vipers yet?

They're covered in both scales and stones! And have massive fangs!

Mister [[Garram]] has offered a reward for anyone brave enough to bring him some of their hides! I'm sure he will make it worth your while!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Leatherworking Designs

==Progress==
Have you collected those hides yet? Those snakes are a little scary, but I think a <class> like you can handle them!

==Completion==
Wonderful! These'll do nicely. Look how hard and sharp the scales are!

Thanks for your help, friend! I'll let Kayann know if I need anything else.
