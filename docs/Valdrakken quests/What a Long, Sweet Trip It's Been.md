==Objectives==
Speak with [[Rumiastrasza]].
*[[Ruby Recipe Journal VIII]]

==Description==
<Name>! Just who [[Chef Morsel|Morsel]] and I were looking for!

From the bottom of both of our winged-hearts, we thank you dearly.

We started The [[Ruby Feast]] to share [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]]' culinary culture with all of [[Azeroth]]'s [[race]]s, and to learn from them too. We had you running from one end of our beloved continent to another, but you helped bring our dream vision of these gatherings to each honored visitor and guest here.

As friends, we would like to give you a gift. Grab the top journal from our hoard behind the cauldron.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

{{itembox||Recipe: Hoard of Draconic Delicacies
}}

==Progress==
Our hoard is just behind the cauldron.

Not to worry though, we lowered the sealing enchantment and deathly magical traps for you!

==Completion==
Catch a fish for a mortal, they will eat for a day.

Teach a mortal to cook, they will eat for a lifetime.

Give a mortal your most prized recipe, they will think of you each time they make it. At least we hope you do.

<Morsel and Rumi smile at you like only good friends can.>

Come back any time, <name>! The meal is on us!

==Notes==
Open [[Chef's Hoard]].
