==Objectives==
Acquire 15 Whelpling's Awakened Crests by defeating unique creatures, conquering [[dungeon]]s and [[raid]]s, completing world activities, or by looting caches. Then return to [[Vaskarn]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Whelpling's Awakened Crest]]s (15)

==Description==
Your help is always appreciated, and now you know you can easily upgrade lower-level gear right here.

Of course, I'm sure you know that Flightstones can only go so far. You need Awakened Crests to upgrade powerful adventuring gear. Much like Flightstones, these Crests are rewarded through many different activities. Awakened Crests have four tiers, and more dangerous tasks reward you with higher-tier crests.

Bring me fifteen Whelpling's Awakened Crests, and we can help you upgrade some gear further.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]
*[[Awakened Flightstone]]
*[[Pouch of Whelpling's Awakened Crests]]

==Progress==
If you're having a hard time finding Whelpling's Awakened Crests, you can search for hidden treasures around the Dragon Isles. There's no shortage of those!

==Completion==
This is wonderful. I'm so excited for you to grow in power!
