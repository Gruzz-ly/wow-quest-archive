==Objectives==
Gather 25 Intact Dracthyr Weapons from the [[Sundered Flame]] of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Dhurrel]] of the [[Maruuk Centaurs]].
*[[Intact Dracthyr Weapon]] (25)

==Description==
These Sundered Flame pose a great threat to our borders. Their weapons are concerning. Gather what you can of their weapons--we can study them for any weaknesses, and even use them for our own defenses.

I have faith in you, outsider. If you perform this task for us, I will teach you some of our own [[blacksmithing]] arts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Blacksmith's Writ]]

==Progress==
What were you able to secure?

==Completion==
Thank you, outsider. This should help greatly.

As promised, here is a scroll I had our blacksmiths prepare for you. May the knowledge grant you swift learning.
