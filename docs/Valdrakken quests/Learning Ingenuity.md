'''Learning Ingenuity''' is an optional breadcrumb to the "The Spark of Ingenuity" questline, which is used to unlock the [[Engine of Innovation]], allowing players to turn [[Bottled Essence]] into a [[Spark of Ingenuity]], a high-value crafting reagent used for end-game crafting. 

This quest chain was originally on a one or two-week time-gate, but now can be completed without any forced waiting.

==Objectives==
Meet [[Greyzik Cobblefinger]] within [[Valdrakken]].

==Description==
There are some [[goblin]]s within Valdrakken that are investigating an abandoned [[titan]] device.

Honestly, they're causing quite a disturbance. Some are concerned their investigation could cause more harm than good.

The denizens of Valdrakken would appreciate you meeting these goblins to see if you can find a solution to their investigation.

Without destroying part of our city.

==Rewards==
You will learn:
*{{Abilities|Questline Reward: Bottled Essence|At the end of this questline, you will acquire a [[Bottled Essence]], which can be turned into a [[Spark of Ingenuity]].|icon=inv_eng_bottledelements}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|27|62|}}
* 250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Nice to meetcha. We could use another pair of hands figuring out how to kickstart this thing.
