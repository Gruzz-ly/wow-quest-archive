*{{Abilities|Drake Armor|id=400549|Unlocks the ability to apply armor to all Dragon Isle Drakes at the Rostrum of Transformation.|icon=inv_drake2mountgladiator}}

==Completion==
Ah, the noble <class> returns from the path of adventure.

A [[dragon]]'s scales may be thick and tough, but it would be irresponsible to send our young into battle unprotected. Allow me to supply your drake with its first set of armor.

See me later if you would like to purchase another set. Other armors may be found throughout [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]]. Fair skies and strong winds!
