==Objectives==
Collect 8 Everburning Fireshards.
*[[Everburning Fireshard]] (8)

==Description==
Some of our incense needs to be burned very slowly to release the right aromas. You can check the heat yourself, of course--but it gets to be a bother.

Fortunately, I've found a solution! If you grind up shards of [[fire elemental]]s and sprinkle the dust over the incense, you can keep the heat consistent using enchantments. Completely hands-free!

Those shards are a bit hard to come by, though. Could you find some and bring them to my friends back in [[Loamm]]?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Loamm Niffen]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Enchanter's Script

==Progress==
[[Elder Honeypelt]] usually brings us back a stock of shards when she returns from a hunt, but I'd hate to bother her again so soon.

==Completion==
Wonderful! With this haul, I'll be able to keep our incense burning for weeks and still have some to spare.
