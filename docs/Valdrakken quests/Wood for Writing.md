==Objectives==
Gather 15 Bark Parchment from the [[decay]] [[treant]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Dothenos]] of the [[Valdrakken Accord]].
*[[Bark Parchment]] (15)

==Description==
We've found some unusual information in our studies of the Dragon Isles. For instance, the bark of treants afflicted by decay [[magic]] acts similarly to hide parchment.

This odd parchment is strangely able to hold the magic for more powerful inscriptions. Very useful! Can you help us gather some?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Scribe's Glyphs]]

==Progress==
Were you able to retrieve any bark?

==Completion==
It's so strange. The bark feels like a fine vellum. Though... holding the untreated sheaf brings dark thoughts into my mind. This amount will suffice for now.
