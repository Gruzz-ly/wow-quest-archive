So you want to be an [[engineer]], eh? I'll bet you want to learn from our master engineers too.

Good luck then. Their time and skills are too in demand for them to make time for "aspiring" engineers.

I'll tell you what... I have some of their notes handy. Maybe if you practice on the schematics they've jotted down, you'll show your skill and get their attention!
