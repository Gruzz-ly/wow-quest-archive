You wish to learn from our master [[Alchemy|alchemists]]?

You must improve your skills before requesting their guidance. But don't worry. I have some notes they're willing to give aspiring alchemists.

The notes will give you something to cut your fangs on! Practice crafting what's in them, and one day they'll entrust you with greater knowledge.
