==Objectives==
Gather snacks from [[vendor]]s in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Wheel of Whelpwhisper Brie]]
*[[Bag of Spicy Pet Snacks]]
*[[Box of Leapmaize Crackers]]
*Snacks placed

==Description==
[[Dragon whelp|The whelps]] that visit the [[Little Scales Daycare|daycare]] eat snacks during their visit. A lot of snacks.

If there are going to be whelps that stay here with regularity, we will need even more rations to sate their endless hunger.

Here is a list of snacks the whelps have taken to lately. I also ordered something for [[Sir Pringly]], so be sure to get that as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
It was the same in [[Azsuna|Aszuna]]{{sic}}. Cheese and crackers are treasured by all whelps.

==Completion==
That was a remarkable first snack run, <name>. Hopefully these snacks continue to be to the whelps' liking.

==Notes==
Head to [[Artisan's Market]] and approach [[Gorgonzormu]].
:{{Text|say|Gorgonzormu|Ah, here for your regular cheese order, <name>? I have it ready for you here.}}

Buy the [[Wheel of Whelpwhisper Brie]] for {{cost|1}} from him.
:{{Text|say|Gorgonzormu|You do not smell like a cheese board yet! This must be your first visit. Best of luck in your daycare endeavors, friend.}}

Continue to [[Kaestrasz]].
:{{Text|say|Kaestrasz|Are you here for Agapanthus' order? I have everything ready.}}

:{{Gossip|quest=|Show me your wares.}} 

Buy the [[Bag of Spicy Pet Snacks]] for {{cost|1}} from him.
:{{Text|say|Kaestrasz|Tell Agapanthus it is my pleasure to craft treats for Sir Pringly's fine palate.}}

Head to the [[Roasted Ram]] and approach [[Tithris]].
:{{Text|say|Tithris|Welcome to the Ram! I can help you with anything you may need.}}

:{{Gossip|quest=|Let me browse your goods.}}

Buy the [[Box of Leapmaize Crackers]] for {{cost|1}} from him.
:{{Text|say|Tithris|If you need cheese for those crackers, I recommend Gorgonzormu's stock. Best in Valdrakken!}}

Return to the Daycare and place the Snacks on the table near Kalithumos. A group of [[Hungry Whelp]]s starts devouring them.
