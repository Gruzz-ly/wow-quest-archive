==Objectives==
Collect the Bronze Dragon Egg at the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]] then hatch it at the Bronze Oathstone.
*Bronze Egg collected
*Egg hatched at [[Bronze Oathstone]]

==Description==
An egg from the [[bronze dragonflight]] is ready to hatch.

Report to [[Xius]] in the Ruby Lifeshrine to pick up the egg. Then, I request that you bring the egg to the Bronze Oathstone to hatch in a location strong with their flight's power.

Once this is complete, return here with the hatchling, where we will further take care of it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Have you brought the newest hatchling?

==Completion==
Ah, a [[bronze whelp]].

Let us hope they stay in whelp form, hmm?

==Notes==
;Speaking with Xius
:Please do not distract me. I must focus.

:{{Gossip|quest=|I am here to bring the egg to [[Valdrakken]].}}
:{{Text|say|Xius|The dilation of [[time]] is innate in [[bronze dragon]]s, even as whelps. It will take time for him to learn to control it.}}

Head to the Bronze Oathstone at the [[Temporal Conflux]] and use the extra action button. A cutscene plays out showing the whelp hatching, entering a time portal, and changing its form. The adventurer laughs.
