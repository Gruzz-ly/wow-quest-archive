==Completion==
I can tell by the smudges on your armor that you've been hard at work. And you've caught the attention of our masters as well! For your work, not for the cleanliness of your armor, to be clear...

As a reward, they have left more notes to help you learn. Study them and keep practicing, and perhaps one day you'll even surpass them. Good luck!
