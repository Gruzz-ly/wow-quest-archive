'''A Titanic Mold''' concludes the eighth day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Objectives==
Return the Titan Key Mold to [[Weaponsmith Koref]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Titan Key Mold]] (provided)

==Description==
<The Titan Key Mold was at the location referenced in the story. Weaponsmith Koref will be so excited to see the mold!>

==Progress==
By the forge, did you actually do it? Did you find the Titan Key mold?

==Completion==
I cannot believe it, <name>! We simply must reforge the key now that we have the mold.

I'll need to make preparations. The tome that [[Tithris]] gave me described an involved process. Magical rituals, special components, that sort of thing. I may need you{{sic}} help once I have all my irons in a row.

I'll send word when I'm ready for the next step.

==Notes==
Completing this quest is the "What's in a Mold?" criterion of [[Whodunnit?]]

==Progression==
{{Secrets of Azeroth}}
