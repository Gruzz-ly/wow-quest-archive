'''Hidden Legacies''' begins the [[patch 10.0.7]] portion of the [[Dragonflight campaign]], starting the [[Forbidden Reach storyline]]. The quest will be pushed to players automatically upon zoning into [[Valdrakken]].

==Objectives==
Speak to the [[Healing Wings]] Envoy at the [[Seat of the Aspects]] to learn about events in the [[Forbidden Reach]].
* Hear [[Kurazidaia|the envoy's]] report.

==Description==
[[Raszageth]] and her storms are gone, but our troubles are far from over.

The way to the Reach is clear again, and some of our allies have returned to establish a base camp. However, [[Sarkareth]] and the [[Sundered Flame]] have begun making their way there as well.

We need to secure the island. We would appreciate your aid.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|21|6|75}}
*9,500 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Ah, an adventurer! Did Emberthal send you?

==Completion==
Thankfully, our enemies have not discovered our scouts. The [[Primal Incarnates|Incarnates]] and the Sundered Flame are both formidable foes. I'm uncertain whether we'll be able to safely monitor them again without retribution.

The situation is heating up. Some of the [[dracthyr]] have already returned to the island, but they're going to need a lot of help building up their base of operations.

You're about to be very busy, friend.

==Notes==
[[Kurazidaia]] offers a skip for alts who have already done the introduction to the [[Forbidden Reach storyline]]:
: {{gossip|You can count on me. {{text|red|<Skip the intro quests, forfeit any rewards, and travel instantly to the Forbidden Reach.>}}}}

This will allow players to jump to [[The Best We Have]], and will forfeit the following: 
* [[Primalist Cloak]]
* 1000 [[Elemental Overflow]]
* 1 [[Untapped Forbidden Knowledge]]
* 1200 [[Valdrakken Accord]] reputation
* 1050 [[Dark Talons]] (Horde) or [[Obsidian Warders]] (Alliance) reputation.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Raszageth's storm has abated. It is time to return to the Forbidden Reach and search for survivors... and seek answers about the dracthyr's past.}}

Speak with [[Kurazidaia]], the [[Healing Wings]] Envoy atop the [[Seat of the Aspects]] in [[Valdrakken]]:
:We can return to the Forbidden Reach!
:Emberthal has called upon the dracthyr to recover their lost legacy, and Viridia is helping us find any who were left behind.
:We're ready to restore our old home. Will you join us?
:{{gossip|Tell me what happened.}}
A [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|cinematic]] plays, "Secrets of the Reach":
{{#ev:youtube|YwEE85vd42c}}

:''Nighttime. A light rain at [[Stormsunder Crater]] in eastern [[Forbidden Reach]] as the storm fades. Three dracthyr walk up, looking east across the path to [[Talonlords' Perch]]. [[Scalecommander Sarkareth]], leader of the [[Sundered Flame]], holds out his right hand to feel the rain.''
:{{text|bossemote|Sarkareth|The storm is receding. The reach is ours once again.}}
:''He hears a distant roar and spots the three remaining [[Primal Incarnates]] flying in.''
:{{text|bossemote|Sarkareth|Take cover!}}
:''They escape under some trees as the Incarnates fly past. In a whisper, [[Dezran]] wonders aloud:''
:{{text|bossemote|Dezran|Who are they, Sarkareth? Is it the Aspects?}}
:''With a squint, the three incarnates flying past are reflected in Sarkareth's eye.''
:{{text|bossemote|Sarkareth|No. Raszageth's kin.}}
:''The incarnates land at the [[Old Weyrn Grounds]] at the entrance to the [[War Creche]]. Their shadows show them shifting to their humanoid visages.''
:{{text|bossemote|Vyranoth|The last echoes of her storm are fading. She is truly gone.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Fyrakk|We should be devouring her murderers' hearts.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|Do not underestimate them, Fyrakk. Our sister's overconfidence was her downfall.}}
:''They walk inside the building, stopping before a passageway blocked with rocks.''
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|While the Aspects' power has waned, their forces grow stronger. And we must even the scales.}}
:''Iridikron's right hand starts glowing with power, which he uses to blast the rocks out of the way.''
:{{text|bossemote|Vyranoth|They kept so many secrets... from us, and even from each other.}}
:''They enter the main chamber of the [[Earth-Warder's Cauldron]] as the camera pulls back. The visible eye of the dragon statue in the center lets off a red glint, detecting the intruders. Numerous circles light up the ground, and crystalline earth elementals pull themselves out of those circles.''
:''With heavy thuds, one starts to climb up the wall to [[Vyranoth]], but she instantly freezes it, and it falls to the ground and shatters. Another takes an overhead swing at [[Fyrakk]], who catches it in his left hand and pulses fire magic through the elemental's arm, melting it into lava. Fyrakk laughs menacingly.''
:''A large group attempts to surround [[Iridikron]], but with his still-glowing right hand, he magically floats them all off the ground and shatters them all into dust.''
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|It is here.}}
:''He walks up to the dragon statue.''
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|Neltharion's betrayal shattered their unity... left fissures in their hearts.}}
:''As the other Incarnates walk up behind him, Iridikron raises his right hand again. He magically lifts the statue, revealing [[Dark Heart|a magical artifact]] inscribed by a rune in the base of the statue.''
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|Yet the pain he inflicted was only the beginning.}}
:''Iridikron grabs the artifact and channels more of his power into it, revealing more runes from inside it.''
:{{text|bossemote|Vyranoth|[[Aberrus]]... his hidden laboratory.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|One last secret, deep within the earth.}}
:''Iridikron releases his magical power and, in a jump cut, they all exit the War Creche back to the surface.''
:{{text|bossemote|Vyranoth|The location of Aberrus must lie within this vessel. I will decipher its knowledge.}}
:''Fyrakk scoffs.''
:{{text|bossemote|Fyrakk|What use of Neltharion's twisted experiments to us?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|The laboratory itself is of no consequence.}}
:''The camera cuts to reveal the dracthyr eavesdropping.''
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|But the [[shadowflame|molten fire]] that powers it... that we can use.}}
:''In a whisper, Sarkareth gives his order:''
:{{text|bossemote|Sarkareth|Keep eyes on them, Dezran. Whatever remains of Neltharion's legacy... belongs to us.}}
:''Offscreen, the incarnates shift back into their proto-drake forms, then fly up through the camera's view off into the distance.''

After the cinematic, Kurazidaia can be asked to show the cinematic again:
:{{gossip|Um, can you repeat that report? <Watch cutscene again.>}}

==PTR version==
;Description

:We've got a Scouting Drake you can use, or you can find your own way there. 
:Either way, you're about to be very busy.
