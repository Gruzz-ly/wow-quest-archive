==Objectives==
Craft 15 Crumbled Stones for [[Tuluradormi]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Crumbled Stone]] (15)

==Description==
Jewelcrafter, how would you feel about a chance to practice your prospecting techniques?

The architects and plumbers of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]] have requested that we acquire some stones for the construction of a new bath house. I think you will find this a suitable task to occupy you and practice your masonry.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Jeweler's Cuts
}}

==Progress==
Do you have the stones?

==Completion==
Nice work, <name>.

Here, I made these cuts. You can study them to learn how to be a better jewelcrafter like me.

==Patch changes==
