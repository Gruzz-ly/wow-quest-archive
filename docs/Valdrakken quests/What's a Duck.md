==Objectives==
Kill 5 Bluebill Waddlers in [[Primordial Vale]] with Rusziona.
*[[Bluebill Waddler]] slain with [[Rusziona]] (5)
*[[Rusziona's Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
I will be honest with you, <name>.

It has been such a long time since we dealt with the [[black dragonflight]] that I could not quite tell you much about them. I do know that they are strong warriors, brave protectors of us all.

Rusziona is still quite young, but perhaps we should see how well she does with battle? Take her to practice on some [[duck]]s in the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]]. Let us see her baseline.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
How did Rusziona fare with the ducks?

==Completion==
She what?!

<Agapanthus holds his head in his hand and lets out a big sigh.>

You know? That was insensitive of me. I should know better.

I think we need to go back to the drawing board.
