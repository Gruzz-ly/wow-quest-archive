==Objectives==
Gather 15 Gorloc Mucus from the [[gorloc]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Dhurrel]] of the [[Maruuk Centaurs]].
*[[Gorloc Mucus]] (15)

==Description==
Our [[alchemist]]s have recently looked into a variety of new ingredients for experimentation. Their most recent interest is... interesting... to say the least.

It appears that gorloc mucus has some properties that can be beneficial for certain elixirs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Alchemy Notes]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered the mucus from the gorlocs?

==Completion==
Wonderful. Now we will see what exciting concoctions our alchemists will produce with this.
