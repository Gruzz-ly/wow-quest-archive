'''A Key To Reforg(ing)''' concludes the ninth day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Objectives==
Assist Weaponsmith Koref in reforging the Titan Key.
*Talk to [[Weaponsmith Koref]] to begin
*[[Rose Gold Dust|Dusty Red Pellets]] added
*[[Igneous Flux]] added
*Infuse the Key with the [[Torch of Pyrreth]]
*[[Reforged Titan Key]]

==Description==
You have the final materials! Perfect.

I prepared the forge and the mold. I just need you to add the ingredients when I say.

Oh, and be ready to use that Torch of Pyrreth. Seems the relic is crucial to the forging process. I'll tell you when!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Tyr's Titan Key]]

==Progress==
The Titan Key. By the forge... Let me have a look.

==Completion==
This is amazing! And it's already cool to the touch? What incredible magic.

Hmm. There's writing on the shaft. I don't recognize most of it, but this is Tyr's symbol. I'll create a quick sketch of the rest of the entire message and see what I can find out.

I'd say the key is safest with you. Besides, what's a key without a lock? And if anyone can find a titan lock in need of opening, it would be you.

==Notes==

Speak with Koref:

{{book|content=
Greetings adventurer, what do you seek?

{{gossip|I am ready to begin.}}

Make sure you have the Torch of Pyrreth ready. We're going to need it.
}}

In case the materials are not gathered, he says:
{{book|content=
{{Gossip|Are you ready to forge the Titan Key?}}

The forge is ready, but you must gather the materials we need first. Still have that list I gave you, don't you? That will tell you what we need and where to find it.
}}

Equip the [[Torch of Pyrreth]] and try again...
:{{text|say|Weaponsmith Koref|The forge is hot and ready. Lets begin!}}
:{{text|say|Weaponsmith Koref|Add the rose gold dust!}}

Stand near the Earth-Warder's Forge to get the Add Dusty Red Pallets extra action button to appear and hit it:
:{{text|say|Weaponsmith Koref|Steady, steady... Yes! Quickly now, add the flux!}}

Then use the Add Igneous Flux button.
:{{text|say|Weaponsmith Koref|Now, for the final touch! Use the Torch of Pyrreth!}}

Stand there and do nothing.
:{{text|say|Weaponsmith Koref|We did it! The Titan Key. Huh. It seems to have already cooled down?}}

Interact with the key to acquire the [[Reforged Titan Key]].

Completing this quest is the "Forging is Key" criterion of [[Whodunnit?]]
