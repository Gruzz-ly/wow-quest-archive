'''An Inside Job?''' kicks off the third day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Fangli Hoot]] near the [[Valdrakken]] Barber Shop.

==Description==
Fangli Hoot says they have a theory on who might be stealing the artifacts.

Seek her out again near the [[Victorious Visage|Barber Shop]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Fangli's Note]]
*[[Copied Artifact Storage Key]]

==Completion==
I have a theory. What if this so-called "[[Preservationist Kathos|Preservationist]]" is stealing the artifacts, then having you return fakes instead?

I'll give you the location of a box where the Preservationist is keeping artifacts. Grab one, then follow these coordinates to an [["Appraiser" Sazsel Stickyfingers|appraiser]] who can verify if what you find is legit.

==Notes==

[[Fangli's Note]] reads:

{{:Fangli's Note}}

Head upstairs in the [[Roasted Ram]] inn and stop at the top of the ramp at the second floor under the light, then re-equip the [[Tricked-Out Thinking Cap]] to reset the coordinates. (2, -3) is at {{co|48.8|47.8|Valdrakken}} to the southeast behind the bed, where players will spot the [[Preservationist's Locker]]. Interact with it:

{{book||content=
<Opened.>

{{gossip|<Take the item.>}}
}}

Players loot the [[Maruuk Burial Banner]]. Head to the mailbox outside the [[Valdrakken Treasury Hoard]] at {{co|54.5|59.4|Valdrakken}} and re-equip the thinking cap. (12, -13) in relative coordinates translates to {{co|62.8|72.9|Valdrakken}} and [["Appraiser" Sazsel Stickyfingers]] is waiting inside a room. Speak with her:

{{book|content=
You must be working with Fangli. Those hats aren't exactly inconspicuous.

What do ya need?

{{gossip|Fangli said you could appraise this item to see if it is genuine.}}

Yeah, lemme take a look.

A Maruuk burial banner... proper threading... the inks are natural... weathering matches the expectation of age. 

This is authentic. Looks like Fangli was wrong.

Saszel then offers [[Preservationist Cleared]].

If players are not wearing their cap, Sazsel will instead just say the following:

{{book|content=Hello there. Can I help ya with something?
}}
