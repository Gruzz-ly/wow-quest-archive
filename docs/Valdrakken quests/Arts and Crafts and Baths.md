{{questportrait|The Stickiness.jpg|The Stickiness|The whelps have conjured something with their paint. Something... sticky.}}
==Objectives==
Help clean up paint around the [[Little Scales Daycare]].
*[[Sir Pringly]] doused (3)
*[[Paint Splatter|Paint splatter]] cleaned (6)
*[[The Stickiness]] slain

==Description==
Our arts and crafts activities today have gotten well out of hand. One of the [[whelp]]s enchanted their brush and the rest followed suit. Now there is a coat of paint over everything.

Please clean up the daycare while we get the paint off the whelps.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
*5x [[Flightstones]]

You will receive one from:
*[[Battle Pet Bandage]]
*[[Polished Pet Charm]]
*Pet training stones

==Progress==
This paint was supposed to be washable, but it sticks to whelp scales like nothing else.

==Completion==
You came by just in time, <name>. Thank you. This was a three-person job.

Now to reprimand Sir Pringly for indulging the whelps' poor behavior...

==Notes==
All over the daycare are [[Painterly Whelp]]s. Approached the tub on the right side and use the Water Toss extra action button to throw it at Sir Pringly.
