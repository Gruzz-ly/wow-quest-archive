==Objectives==
Gather 20 Icy Excrement from the [[ice spider]]s and [[ice bear]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Dothenos]] of the [[Valdrakken Accord]].
*[[Icy Excrement]] (20)

==Description==
The icy [[beast]]s in the frozen biomes excrete a very rare and mysterious liquid. The liquid's properties make it the perfect binding agent for our [[ink]]s. I'm a southpaw so the prospect of not smudging my page is very exciting to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Scribe's Glyphs]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered the Icy Excrements?

==Completion==
Thank you for your hard work. We can make fine ink with these.

==Patch changes==
