'''Taming the Dragon...kin''' becomes available to [[hunter]]s at Renown level 23 with the [[Valdrakken Accord]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|How to Train a Dragonkin
}}

==Completion==
The blood of the [[dragon]] has touched many creatures in this land. Though not all of them can be reasoned with, that does not preclude them from becoming stalwart companions.

There is a deep bond that one must build when befriending [[dragonkin]]. Of course it comes naturally to my kind, but I can give you a book that will teach you our methods.

After that, it is up to you to achieve the bond needed to keep them by your side.
