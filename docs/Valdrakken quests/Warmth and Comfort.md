==Objectives==
Gather supplies for the [[Obsidian Hatchling (Valdrakken)|Obsidian Hatchling]]'s nest.
*[[Warmed Coal]] (5)
*[[Obsidian Gemstone]]
*[[Crystalline Shell]]
*Nest pieces placed (3)

==Description==
In order for the obsidian hatchling to be comfortable, we must build them a proper nest.

You will need to build their nest from [[Obsidian Citadel]] coal to make sure it is warm and suitable. Secondly, [[Archivist Edress]] will be able to assist you in finding something that ties them to their people.

We will want to gather something from [[Zaralek Cavern]] as well, as much of [[Black dragonflight|their flight]]'s history is rooted there. Surely somebody in [[Loamm]] can help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
We have the most to learn with this hatchling... I hope she has patience while we improve.

==Completion==
<Agapanthus looks over to the Obsidian Hatchling's nest, relieved.>

They will be quite comfortable in their new nest. Well done.

==Notes==
Warmed Coals can be looted from [[Pile of Coal|Piles of Coal]] in the [[Burning Ascent]] and have a small chance to drop from the Qalashi djaradin in the area.

Head to the [[Obsidian Throne]] and speak with [[Archivist Edress]].

:{{Text|say|Archivist Edress|May this gem remind her of her shining future. It feels good to have hope for our flight.}}
:The adventurer receives the Obsidian Gemstone.

Crystalline Shell is bought from Terryn in Loamm.
:{{Gossip|quest=|I am looking for an artifact for an obsidian hatchling's nest.}}
:{{Text|say|Terryn|Ever since all these black dragons arrived, they've been eyeing this shell! It's making me uncomfortable. Take it for the kid.}}

Return to the daycare and place the three items at the silhouettes, then turn in the quest.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|We have done all we can for today <name>. Come back tomorrow if you can. I am certain we will have need of you.}}
