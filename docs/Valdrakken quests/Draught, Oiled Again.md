Craft 6 Writhefire Oils for [[Conflago]] in [[Valdrakken]].

==Description==
Did you know that is an excellent reagent for finishing your draughts? I did. And now I am out of it. I cannot work without a plentiful stock of oils. Please <name>, help me restock my laboratory.

You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
A craft without Writhefire Oil is like a dish without salt.

==Completion==
Wonderful, thank you. Always use a finishing reagent like Writhefire Oil for excellent craftsmanship.

Here, study this. Even as a skilled alchemist, there is more for you to learn.

The Writhefire Oils have to be gold quality. They can be traded or bought off from Auction House.
