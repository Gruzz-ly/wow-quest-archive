==Objectives==
Deliver the leaflet to [[Calderax]] in the [[Gladiator's Refuge (Valdrakken)|Gladiator's Refuge]] of [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Artisan's Consortium Leaflet]]

==Description==
The [[Artisan's Consortium]] has struck another deal with the quartermasters of the Gladiator's Refuge!

In addition to the usual selection of powerful combat equipment they offer, worthy combatants can purchase tokens that can be used in Crafting Orders or one's own crafts to certify the equipment for use in battlegrounds and arenas!

Present this leaflet to Calderax to receive two complimentary Trophies of Conquest, on us!

- [[Rabul]]

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Verdant Trophy of Conquest
|Greater Verdant Trophy of Conquest
}}

==Completion==
Wait... is this what I think it is? Are we doing this promotion AGAIN? You have no idea how many of these fliers I got last time.

Well, here are your trophies, as promised. Use them when crafting your own equipment or submitting Crafting Orders and the gear will be comparable in power to what I offer. It is perfect if you are looking for something highly specific or imbued with a certain embellishment... and are willing to put in some extra work.

Questions? Take them to the [[Artisan's Market]].
