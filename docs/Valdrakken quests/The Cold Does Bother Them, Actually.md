==Objectives==
Craft 2 Explorer's Cloth Robes for [[Threadfinder Fulafong|Fulafong]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Surveyor's Cloth Robe]] (2)

==Description==
If there is one thing I have learned in my years as a seamstress, <name>, it is that [[adventurer]]s will always underestimate the cold.

I have explorers in the [[Azure Span]] begging me for warmer robes.

Would you take pity on them and craft a few?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Tailoring Examples

==Progress==
Do you have the robes?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

Please, learn from these examples. Study them to improve your tailoring.

And stay warm.
