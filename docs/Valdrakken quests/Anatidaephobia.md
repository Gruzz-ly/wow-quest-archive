==Description==
The time has come, <name>. Her new pet Iggy has been doing wonders for Rusziona's confidence, and now I think she's ready to face her biggest fear.

Ducks.

There is a [[tauren]] in the Waking Shores who is an expert at using pets to help heal trauma. I think she might be just what we need.

Lasztak and Rusziona will meet you there.

==Progress==
A large duck still may be too much for Rusziona, but a duckling will be perfect.

==Completion==
Thank you for what you've done for Rusziona, <name>. She has asked if she can go along with you on some of your adventures. She's confident she'll be safe as long as she's with you.

==Notes==
Head to Wuralie on top of a rise.

;Rusziona's gossip
:Duck... So scary.

;Speaking with Lasztak
:Thank you for coming, <name>!

:I hope this will help poor little Rusziona. She is so scared, it was all I could do to convince her to come along.

:{{Text|say|Lasztak|Thank you for seeing us today, Wurallie.}}
:{{Text|say|Rusziona|Thank you, Wurallie.}}
:{{Text|say|Wurallie|Of course, little one! But you seem frightened.}}

:{{Text|say|Wurallie|I see you brought Iggy, maybe he can help you.}}
:{{Text|say|Wurallie|Let's have a contest. See this lifelike mechanical duckling?}}
:{{Text|say|Wurallie|Iggy doesn't seem afraid, so he can try to face it. If you wish it.}}
:{{Text|say|Rusziona|I... I do!}}
:{{Text|say|Wurallie|Excellent! <Name>, please add Iggy to your battle pet team, come talk to me, and we'll begin.}}

;Speaking with Wurallie

:{{Text|say|Wurallie|He did, Rusziona! And how did he do it?}}
:{{Text|say|Rusziona|He... he stood his ground! He had courage and the duck couldn't scare him. Not one bit!}}
