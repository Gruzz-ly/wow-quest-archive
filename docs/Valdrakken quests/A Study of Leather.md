==Objectives==
Gather 40 Resilient Leather for [[Ralathor the Rugged]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Resilient Leather]] (40)

==Description==
You there! Perhaps you can help me with my studies of this leather. Some of it is soft and pliable, yet other pieces have a more firm temper--the better for crafting armor, I suspect.

Bring me more leathers to investigate. I wish to continue my studies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*+500 reputation with [[Artisan's Consortium - Dragon Isles Branch]]
*[[Skinning Field Notes]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find any leather to study?

==Completion==
Thank you <name>. This should help me hone my craft.

Here, have my field notes. They will teach you about the beasts of this land and to better procure their hides.

==Notes==
The Resilient Leathers have to be silver quality.
