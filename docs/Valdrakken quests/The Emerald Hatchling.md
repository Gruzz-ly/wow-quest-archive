==Objectives==
Collect the [[Green dragon|Green Dragon]] Egg at the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]] then hatch it at the Emerald Oathstone.
*Emerald Egg collected
*Egg hatched at [[Emerald Oathstone]]

==Description==
An egg from the [[green dragonflight]] is ready to hatch.

Report to [[Zahkrana]] in the Ruby Lifeshrine to pick up the egg. Then, I request that you bring the egg to the Emerald Oathstone to hatch in a location strong with their flight's power.

Once this is complete, return here with the hatchling, where we will further take care of it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Have you brought the newest hatchling?

==Completion==
Every so often I would bring the whelps in my care to meet with some [[green whelp]]s in [[Val'sharah]].

They were always... so much calmer...

<[[Agapanthus]] stares off into the distance.>

==Notes==
;Speaking with Zahkrana
:{{Gossip|quest=|I am here to bring the egg to Valdrakken.}}
:{{Text|say|Zahkrana|Sleep is important to all whelps, but none more than green. Make sure they get plenty of rest.}}

With the egg head to the [[Ancient Bough]] and use the Hatch Egg extra action button at the oathstone. It shows a cutscene where the sleeping whelp hatches and gets a headache.
