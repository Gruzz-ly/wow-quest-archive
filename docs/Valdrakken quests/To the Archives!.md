==Completion==
Finally! The delivery <class> is here with our meal orders!

Oh... you're here to join the Archives? Of course! My mistake.

But if you do see a delivery person around, please point them my way, would you?

==Notes==
On approach in the [[Azerothian Archives]]:
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|Will advertisements in Valdrakken really work? I've heard adventurers don't actually like reading anymore...}}

Eadweard has gossip:
{{book|content=
I can tell you're the kind of ingenious individual who has a proper appreciation for scholarship.

Here in the Azerothian Archives, we specialize in uncovering revelations from the past. In addition, I get to stand around a library of musty books drinking tea, but that, I assure you, is merely a fringe benefit.
}}

Also in the room are [[Provisioner Aristta]], the Azerothian Archives vendor, [[Nirobin]], the codicological archaeologist, [[Roska Rocktooth]], the geo-archaeologist, and [[Zenata]], the techno-archaeologist. They all have gossip:

{{book|Provisioner Aristta|content=Each of these tomes exudes its history through the vibrance of its remaining hue... don't you think?

Apologies, my peer. Shall we take a look at the wares?
}}
{{book|Nirobin|content=I can tell you're the kind of ingenious individual who has a proper appreciation for scholarship.

Here in the Azerothian Archives, we specialize in uncovering revelations from the past. In addition, I get to stand around a library of musty books drinking tea, but that, I assure you, is merely a fringe benefit.}}
{{book|Roska Rocktooth|content=Nothing better than standing in the dirt, knowing that just beneath your feet could be a little piece of history.}}
{{book|Zenata|content=If you are here to discuss methods of viewing the past, you have found a new home.

Our leader, Eadweard, is a little... eccentric. But do not let that concern you. He has many long years of traditional training behind him, all of which opened his mind towards newer, more progressive styles of investigation.
}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Eadweard Dalyngrigge|Zenata! Roska! Nirobin! Are you ready to show the ropes to our first new recruit?}}
:{{text|say|Zenata|Yes, professor!}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|You bet! Come on over here, recruit!}}
:{{text|say|Nirobin|Absolutely not!}}
:{{text|say|Nirobin|I still need more time! I'm unprepared!}}
:{{text|say|Nirobin|Gah! Just... find me in my office when the others are through with you!}}
:''Nirobin teleports away.''
