==Objectives==
Obtain [[:Honor]] in [[Rated battlegrounds|Random Battlegrounds]].

==Description==
You mortals do so love to squabble over whatever grounds you come across, so be it.

It will at least be amusing either way. For me, that is. Let us see what how well you can 'prove yourself'.

|Dragonscale Expedition Insignia

}}

==Progress==

==Completion==
