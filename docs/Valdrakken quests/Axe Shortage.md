A mix-up with orders resulted in a severe shortage of new axes for our explorers. We have an immediate need for more Draconium Axes and are looking for all blacksmiths to pitch in. In return, I will impart new Blacksmithing Knowledge to you to assist in making even more epic pieces.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Blacksmith's Writ]]

==Progress==
Are you finished already?

These will add to our dwindling stockpile nicely.

Your skill is progressing well. As promised, here is something you can study to improve your [[blacksmithing]].
