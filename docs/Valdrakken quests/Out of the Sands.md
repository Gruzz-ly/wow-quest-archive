'''Out of the Sands''' concludes the seventh day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Objectives==
Return the Incomplete Tablet to [[Preservationist Kathos]].
*[[Incomplete Tablet]] (provided)

==Description==
<The Time-Lost fragments are now joined to form a stone tablet, but many of its inscriptions are worn and incomplete.

Preservationist Kathos will want to see this.>

==Progress==
<NAME>! How was your luck in the Shifting Sands? Did you find the tablet fragments?

==Completion==
Ah yes, I can see a portion of the tablet's inscriptions. Many, but not quite all...

I'll pore over these symbols. With luck, I may complete the puzzle and tease out its meaning.

==Notes==
Completing this quest is the "Shifting Sands" criterion of [[Whodunnit?]]

==Progression==
