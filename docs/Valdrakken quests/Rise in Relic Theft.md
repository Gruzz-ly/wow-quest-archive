'''Rise in Relic Theft''' starts the second half of the first day's secret finding during the [[Secrets of Azeroth]] event.

==Completion==
The inns are abuzz with rumors of aspiring criminals pilfering sacred relics.

I'm overseeing the return of stolen goods to their rightful owners. I hear you can be trusted to help.

Please take this ceremonial [[tuskarr]] spear back to [[Iskaara]]. And watch out for looters!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Tuskarr Ceremonial Spear]]

Head to the [[Filled Bowl]] of [[Iskaara]] and speak with [[Elder Poa]]:
{{book|content=
Have you come to hear a tale, traveler?

{{gossip|Someone stole this ceremonial spear from the tuskarr. Do you know where it was taken from?}}

A stolen spear, eh? I assume you wish to return it to its rightful place, <name>.

I'm afraid it doesn't look familiar. Say, is that writing on the hilt?

Let me take a closer look.

{{gossip|Of course, Elder Poa.}}
}}

This shows a pop-up:
:<Give the ceremonial spear to Elder Poa.>

Accepting the pop-up turns the [[Tuskarr Ceremonial Spear]] into [[Shomko's Unyielding Spear]] and Poa's gossip continues:

{{book|content=
The writing says, 'The spear of [[Shomko]] of [[Pal'ea]], last sentinel in the west.'

<Poa's brow furrows.>

Can't say I recognize the person or the place.

These markings look old. Perhaps the weapon was crafted by the [[Kalu'ak]] in [[Northrend]].

Here, you can have the spear back. I wish you safe travels, <name>.
}}

===Elder Kon'ani===
Take Shomko's spear to any Northrend tuskarr, like an [[Unu'pe Spearman]] at {{Co|78|52|Borean Tundra}} in [[Unu'pe]] in the [[Borean Tundra]], or a [[Kamagua Turtle Rider]] at {{co|26|58|Howling Fjord}} in [[Kamagua]] in the [[Howling Fjord]].

{{book|content=
Greetings, traveler. If you come to trade in peace, you are welcome here.

{{Gossip|Have you heard of Shomko of Pal'ea?}}

The village of Pal'ea lies far to the west/east. I do not recognize the name Shomko, but perhaps [[Elder Ko'nani]] in [[Moa'ki Harbor]] will.

Head to [[Moa'ki Harbor]] on the southern shore of the [[Dragonblight]] and speak with [[Elder Ko'nani]] at {{Coords|48|74|Dragonblight}} in the main building:
{{book|content=
{{Gossip|Have you heard of Shomko of Pal'ea?}}

Oh, the great explorer Shomko! I know much of his exploits.

He lead{{sic}} an expedition to the furthest shores of these lands. There he established the village of Pal'ea.

It is said he defended his kinfolk in many battles and was renowned as a great fighter.

Legends tell us that his spirit inhabits the last monument in the west, just north of the village he founded.

Here, I have a a{{sic}} drawing of it I can send with you.
}}

The player receives [[The Elder's Drawing]], which shows a tuskarr statue in the vein of a {{wp|Moai}}.

===Pal'ea===
[[Pal'ea]] is west of [[Warsong Hold]] on the southwestern shore of [[Borean Tundra]]. Find the statue at {{co|33.62|58.38|Borean Tundra}} overlooking the beach on the [[Coast of Echoes]], but beware of [[Crazed Looter]]s nearby:
:{{Text|say|Crazed Looter|Hey! Hand over that fancy spear. It's too nice to leave out in this wretched weather!}}

[[File:Shomko's Remembrance.jpg|thumb|[[Shomko's Remembrance]]]]

At its base is [[Shomko's Remembrance]]. Interact with it:

{{book|content=
<A carved stone weapon rack stands empty. Weathered ancient writing is barely legible at the base.>

{{Gossip|<Place the spear on the weapon rack.>}}
}}

This awards [[The Inquisitive]] and the Ceremonial Spear step of [[Whodunnit?]]. Secret of the day revealed, return to the [[Roasted Ram]] tomorrow.
