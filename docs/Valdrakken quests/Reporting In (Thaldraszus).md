'''Reporting In''' concludes the first chapter of the [[Thaldraszus storyline]]. [[Nozdormu]] starts the next storyline quest, [[The Flow of Time]].

==Objectives==
Return to [[Valdrakken]] and report to [[Captain Drine]].

==Description==
The [[Primalists]] threat has been diminished, <name>. Forces from Valdrakken will be headed in soon, and can clean up any remnants.

You should head back to the city and inform Captain Drine of what has happened. She will be interested to know what occurred here with [[Commander Eranog]].

Thank you again, <name>, for everything.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
Eranog joined the Primalists? Flame and Scale, this is a terrible development!

However, you were able to prevent them from taking [[South Hold Gate]].

That is no small feat. I appreciate your service to Valdrakken, <name>. It will not be forgotten.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Guardian Velomir|Thank you, <race>, though Eranog's betrayal is painful we have at least reclaimed South Gate Hold.}}
:{{text|say|Guardian Velomir|Though my unit fell today, I will always keep the memory of their courage in my heart. May we never falter in our watch for further rebellion. Farewell, <name>.}}

Return to the top of the tower, the [[Seat of the Aspects]].

On complete:
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|I require a moment of your time, hero. I promise it shall not be wasted.}}

Nozdormu starts the direct follow-up, [[The Flow of Time]], but Drine has some side quest chains for [[Sojourner of Thaldraszus]]: [[Chaos and Commotion]], and [[Look to the Overlook]].

==Progression==
{{Valdrakken, City of Dragons}}
