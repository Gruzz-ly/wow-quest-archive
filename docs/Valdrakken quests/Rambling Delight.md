==Objectives==
Collect 10 Glimmering Ramblekelp Bulbs.
*[[Glimmering Ramblekelp Bulb]] (10)

==Description==
Oh, [[Rumiastrasza]]! Myself and the [[dryad]] sisters, [[Celina Crunchyleaves|Celina]] and [[Felina Starrunner|Felina]], had a lovely evening cooking for her.

The kelp we ate is a unique strain called [[Glimmering Ramblekelp]]. Swarms of [[frillfish]] devour them all along the coast. I wouldn't be surprised if they attack you while you're plucking their food from the sea floor.

Please give the chefs my best when you see them. They're always welcome here in [[Shady Sanctuary|our sanctuary]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I have been tantalized by the smell of fresh berries all day. It has been a most incredible afternoon, <name>.

==Completion==
Yes! Glimmering Ramblekelp! The delicious, vegetal taste from the Shady Sanctuary.

I must say, the aroma of it brings me back to my youth. I became friends with a most humble guard of an [[Emerald Dream]] portal, and was enchanted by the variety of strange ingredients growing near his post. This kelp gives off the same, sweet hints of that glorious realm I remember from back then!

Thank you, <name>. You have gifted this old chef a side of nostalgia with her meal today.

==Notes==
;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|[[Chef Guff]]|Oh, my! What incredible, salty flavor! Truly robust, as well. It's got a hardy and satisfying quality to it like no sea vegetation I've ever tasted before!}}
:{{Text|say|Rumiastrasza|Precisely! And filled with nutrients! I have a theory that this kelp originated long ago from the Dream itself.}}
