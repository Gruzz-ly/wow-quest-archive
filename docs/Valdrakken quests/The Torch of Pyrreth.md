'''The Torch of Pyrreth''' concludes the fourth day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Objectives==
Use the Torch of Opening to unlock [[Preservationist Kathos|Kathos']] artifact, hidden somewhere in [[Ruby Enclave|The Ruby Enclave]].
* [[Kathos' Field Glasses]] {{co|58.4|23.6|Valdrakken}}

==Description==
Let's begin with a simple test.

I have hidden an artifact somewhere in the Ruby Enclave.

If you have the torch out, it should illuminate when you get close to the target. And if my theory is correct, it should interact with a lock I put on the artifact.

Bring me back what's inside. Got it?

==Progress==
Return when you have retrieved what I ask.

==Completion==
Ah yes, my field glasses. I must have set them inside it by accident.

I couldn't figure out how to open it again. But you could!

Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
Use the [[Torch of Pyrreth]] from the [[Toy Box]] to gain the Torch Aura buff:
:{{Abilities|Torch Aura|Wielding the Torch of Pyrreth, can empower ancient devices.|icon=inv_misc_1h_torchbearersflame_b_01_blue}}

Head northeast to the [[Ruby Enclave]] and look around in the marked quest area to find an [[Enchanted Box]] at {{co|58.4|23.6|Valdrakken}} in [[Gardener Cereus]]'s room. Open it to loot [[Kathos' Field Glasses]], then return to Kathos in the inn.

Completing this quest awards the "Torch of Pyrreth" criterion of [[Whodunnit?]]
