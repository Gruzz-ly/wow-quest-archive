==Objectives==
Craft 2 Wildercloth Chef's Hats for [[Threadfinder Fulafong|Fulafong]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Wildercloth Chef's Hat]] (2)

==Description==
If there is one thing I have learned in my years as a seamstress, <name>, it is that too many cooks spoil everything.

In this case, I was going to go out for a drink and an order came in last minute for an entire wardrobe of chef's uniforms.

If you could sew the hats, I will take care of everything else.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Tailoring Examples
}}

==Progress==
Do you have the chef's hats?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. You are hungry as ever for a good challenge.

Please, learn from these examples. Study them to improve your tailoring.

And stay hungry.
