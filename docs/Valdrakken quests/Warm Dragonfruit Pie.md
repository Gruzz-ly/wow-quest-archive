==Objectives==
Gather Ripened Dragonfruit near the [[Ruby Life Pools]] and Pre-Made Pie Crust from [[Erugosa]] in [[Valdrakken]], then bring them to [[Lasztak]] to bake a pie for the Ruby Hatchling.
*[[Ripened Dragonfruit]] (5)
*[[Pre-Made Pie Crust]]
*Ingredients brought to Lasztak
*[[Ruby Hatchling]] fed
*[[Trusty Dragonkin Rake]] (provided)

==Description==
When I think of [[red dragon]] comfort food, I immediately think of the pies back at the Ruby Life Pools. You can always tell when our [[Smith|blacksmith]], [[Krendisc]], has downtime between orders--the entire mountain smells of delicious baked dragonfruit!

My pie may not be as good as his, but I am sure our ruby hatchling will love it. If you bring me the ingredients I will bake the best pie I can!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<[[Lasztak]] cracks his knuckles.>

It has been a while since I baked anything, but I am confident!

==Completion==
When it comes to taking care of red dragons, I know what I am doing!

==Notes==
Buy [[Pre-Made Pie Crust]] from Erugosa:
:{{Buy|quest=|I would like to see your cooking wares.}}

Ripened Dragonfruit is on the trees, use the Trusty Dragonkin Rake to knock them. Return to Lasztak with the ingredients and speak with him:
:{{Gossip|quest=|I have brought the ingredients for Warm Dragonfruit Pie.}}
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|Excellent! Just give me a second here...}}
:''Lasztak quickly prepares [[Dragonfruit Pie]] and gives it to the adventurer.''
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|There! Flame-baked with love.}}

Give the pie to the Ruby Hatchling.
:{{Gossip|quest=|Are you hungry?}}
