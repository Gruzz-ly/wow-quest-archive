'''Crafting Your Start''' is available at Renown level 14 with the [[Valdrakken Accord]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|Notebook of Crafting Knowledge
}}

==Completion==
A [[Blacksmithing|blacksmith]], eh? If you want to spend your days covered in soot, be my guest. 

But if you want to learn blacksmithing from our masters, you need to put some work in. They've left notes for people like you who want to improve. 

Take them. They're a little singed, but legible. Get some practice in and maybe they'll help you in person later on.
