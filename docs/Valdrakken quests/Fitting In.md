'''Fitting In''' becomes available after reaching Renown 20 with the [[Valdrakken Accord]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ensemble: Crimson Valdrakken Clothing
|Ensemble: Black Valdrakken Clothing
|Ensemble: Azure Valdrakken Clothing
|Ensemble: Green Valdrakken Clothing
|Ensemble: Bronze Valdrakken Clothing

==Completion==
If you are going to live or work in [[Valdrakken|this city]], you MUST blend in.

I will make a custom garment for you in the latest style--I'll even give you your choice of color! Which flight do you feel most accentuates your eyes?

If you can't pick just one, then of course we can talk about multiple outfits. For a fair trade, of course!
