==Objectives==
Obtain a pet for [[Rusziona]].
*[[Lysindra]] visited
*[[Solid Earth Elemental]] lifted
*Solid Earth Elemental given to [[Lasztak]]

==Description==
I worry about Ruszi. She is incredibly nervous and insecure, and she jumps at nearly anything! I have never heard of a [[black dragon]] so terrified of the world.

I believe the best way for us to build her confidence is to find her a companion. Something sturdy and strong that does not move quickly or suddenly.

The [[black dragonflight]]'s charge is the protection of earth. Perhaps a small [[elemental]] will suit her well.

Speak to Lysindra at the pet shop in [[Valdrakken]]. She should have something suitable.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Iggy|id=408961|Learn how to summon [[Iggy (pet)|Iggy]].|icon=inv_10_elementalspiritfoozles_earth}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
[[Earth elemental]]s are wonderful first pets. They eat gravel, they do not go very far very quickly, and they can stand against almost anything!

==Completion==
Look at this wonderful elemental! Hopefully it can help our little whelp build her confidence.
