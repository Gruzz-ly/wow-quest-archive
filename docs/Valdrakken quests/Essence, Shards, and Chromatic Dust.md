==Objectives==
Craft 10 Chromatic Dust for [[Soragosa]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Chromatic Dust]] (10)

==Description==
We seem to be in constant need of basic [[crafting reagent|component]]s. [[Essence (enchanting)|Essence]], [[shard]]s... and our stock of Chromatic Dust is almost always depleted.

If you wouldn't mind helping us stock up, perhaps we can make it more than a day into the week without needing to replenish our supply.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Enchanter's Script]]

==Progress==
We're already out of Chromatic Dust for the day! Have you finished any yet?

==Completion==
Thank you. I'm sure the supply will last a bit longer this time.

Here, study this in your free time.
