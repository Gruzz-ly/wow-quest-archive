'''The Search for Titan Relics''' becomes available when you reach Renown level 2 with the [[Valdrakken Accord]].

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Titan Relics|Unlock the ability to identify Titan Relics that you might find in Titan, [[Dragon]] and [[Djaradin]] treasures throughout the Dragon Isles.|id=388303|icon=inv_10_dungeonjewelry_titan_trinket_1facefragment_color5}}

==Completion==
I have spent all of my time since the waking studying the [[titan]]s. Their history is fascinating. What power they must have wielded to create the [[dragonflight]]s! There is so much knowledge to be gained about them! 

If you could bring me any [[Titan Relic (item)|titan relics]] you find around the [[Dragon Isles]], I will put in a good word for you with the [[Valdrakken Accord]].
