==Objectives==
Gather 25 'Mundane' Gems from the [[djaradin]] of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Gnoklin Quirkcoil]] of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]].
*[['Mundane' Gem]] (25)

==Description==
It's such a waste. The djaradin of this land use powerful gems as mundane decorations. Mere jewelry! Gems have so many uses: telescopes, mirrors, focusing pointers, not to mention the myriad [[magic]]al properties they possess.

We must rectify this situation, explorer. Relieve the djaradin of their gems, and bring them back to me. I'll make sure they're put to better use! Be careful though--the djaradin are fierce [[warrior]]s.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Jeweler's Cuts]]

==Progress==
Were you able to get the gems?

==Completion==
There's so much potential in these gems, even [[Lugrah]] wouldn't know what to do with them all!

Lugrah is the [[jewelcrafting]] representative to the [[Artisan's Consortium|Artisan Consortium]]. Let me share some of the notes she sent me before I left. They're sure to help you with your jewelcrafting studies here in the Dragon Isles.
