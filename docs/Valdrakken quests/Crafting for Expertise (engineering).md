==Completion==
Looks like you've been working hard, <name>. Wait, aren't engineers supposed to work smarter, not harder? Perhaps you're not cut out for engineering after all!

Merely a jest, <race>. Here. The master engineers left you further notes to help you increase your skill. They've promised me their documentation is more thorough this time, but you be the judge of that. Good luck!
