==Objectives==
Battle the villains of various stories for the whelps at the [[Little Scales Daycare]].
*Stories slain (3)

==Description==
<Name>, the whelps are begging us to tell them a story from their favorite anthology, but we are absolutely exhausted.

The book the whelps gravitate towards is enchanted and makes every retelling a workout.

Would you mind taking over for a spell and tackle story time for us?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
*5x [[Flightstones]]

{{itembox|You will also receive one from:|Battle Pet Bandage
|Beast Battle-Training Stone
|Humanoid Battle-Training Stone
|Mechanical Battle-Training Stone
|Fel-Touched Battle-Training Stone
}}

==Progress==
I have heard these stories many times now. Battling them every day is tiring, to say the least.

==Completion==
Once the whelps learned we could conjure story elements to display them, they demanded all stories be told in that manner.

Thank you for giving us the chance to rest!

==Notes==
Interact with the [[Enchanting Stories]] book next to [[Kalithumos]].
:<Scrawled in the book are several stories. All end in a great climactic battle.>
