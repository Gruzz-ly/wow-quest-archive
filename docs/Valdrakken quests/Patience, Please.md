==Objectives==
Help [[Belastrasza]] learn patience by defeating a [[turtle]] in a pet battle.
*Visit [[Wurallie]] in the [[Waking Shores]]
*Defeat Wurallie in a Pet Battle using both [[Princess Vorquistrasza (pet)|Princess]] and [[Iggy (pet)|Iggy]]

==Description==
Belastrasza has learned much through her [[vorquin]] foal, but I have thought of one more lesson that should be excellent for her.

Her lack of patience has been stumping me for quite some time. Recently I was reflecting by the water, watching the turtles go about their day. Then I was hit by a revelation!

Wurallie has the perfect battle to test Belastrasza's patience, but poor [[Princess Vorquistrasza]] doesn't have the endurance. Can you meet them in the Waking Shores to lend a hand?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Slow and steady, Bela. Slow and steady.

==Completion==
She has truly come a long way since arriving at [[Little Scales Daycare|the daycare]]. While she still has more to learn, I am extremely proud of her.

She has expressed a desire to accompany you on your adventures. I hope she will not order you around too much.

;Lasztak's gossip
I am glad you are here, <name>!

;Speaking with Wurallie
:Please add both Princess Vorquistrasza and Iggy to your pet battle team.

:As a Beast type pet, Princess is weak to the Mechanical attacks of [[Lifelike Mechanical Turtle|this turtle]].

:Iggy is an Elemental type pet. He's very strong against Mechanical pets.

:Together, I think they'll be a match for this old turtle.

:{{Gossip|How do I add Princess Vorquistrasa and Iggy to my pet team?}}
::Making a team is quite simple, <name>. Let me show you how.

::[To add pets to your pet battle team:
::Open the Collections menu.
::Choose the "Pet Journal" tab.
::In your list of pets, find the one you'd like to add.
::Drag it to any Battle Pet Slot.]

::{{Gossip|I understand.}}
