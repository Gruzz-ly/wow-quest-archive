==Objectives==
Try to help Posidriss fall asleep.
*Tell [[Posidriss]] a bedtime story
*[[Acorn Milk]]
*Acorn Milk given to Posidriss
*[[Wild Argali]] counted (10)
*[[Posidriss's Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
<Name>... we have a problem.

Posidriss has insomnia.

I did not even know it was possible for a [[green dragon]] to not be able to fall asleep! How are they to learn to protect [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]] if they cannot enter it?

Please, try anything you can think of to help Posidriss fall asleep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Every green dragon needs to be able to sleep!

==Completion==
We uh... we will keep working on it. We have to!

==Notes==
Use the whistle to summon him and speak with him:
:I'm not tired!

:{{Gossip|Maybe a bedtime story will help?}}
::I guess we can try...

::{{Gossip|Once upon a time...}}
::{{Gossip|A long, long time ago...}}
::{{Gossip|Legends tell that...}}
::{{Gossip|Okay so uh... yesterday...}}
:::<Posidriss listens intently.>

:::{{Gossip|There was a big [[dragon]] named [[Nozdormu]]!}}
:::{{Gossip|There was a green [[orc]] named [[Thrall]]!}}
:::{{Gossip|There was a powerful [[mage]] named [[Jaina]]!}}
:::{{Gossip|There was a big stone man named [[Koranos]]!}}
::::They sound cool!

::::{{Gossip|They could see all of time, but they could not control it.}}
::::{{Gossip|They traveled all around [[Azeroth]], trying to help their people and make sure they were safe.}}
::::{{Gossip|They traveled across the sea a very long way from home.}}
::::{{Gossip|They were dedicated to keeping watch over this beautiful island.}}
:::::<Posidriss's eyes grow wide.>

:::::{{Gossip|They saw a scary future in which they became a bad guy!}}
:::::{{Gossip|They were doubting their ability and did not know what to do.}}
:::::{{Gossip|They went through some hard times and lost their way.}}
:::::{{Gossip|They slept for a long time, waiting for their home to reawaken.}}
::::::Oh no! What happened next?

::::::{{Gossip|They wrestled with this knowledge, not knowing how to solve this problem.}}
::::::{{Gossip|They lost confidence in themself, but one day they got to meet their long lost mother.}}
::::::{{Gossip|They returned to their homeland, but they were not welcomed with open arms.}}
::::::{{Gossip|When they woke up, they found that they were the only one left to call their friends home!}}
:::::::Aww...

:::::::{{Gossip|They knew they could not live in fear, and decided to do as much good as they could with the time they had.}}
:::::::{{Gossip|They reminded them that while life may be scary and uncertain, they will always succeed if they stay true to their heart.}}
:::::::{{Gossip|They faced their fears and learned from their mistakes, becoming a better person and serving their people to earn back their respect.}}
:::::::{{Gossip|They climbed all the way to the tippy top of a tower and pulled it back together so it could shoot up a welcoming beacon.}}
::::::::Wow!!

::::::::{{Gossip|Surrounded by the support of their allies, they knew that they could face any challenge!}}
::::::::{{Gossip|With this lesson in their heart, they were able to look ahead and walk into a bright future!}}
::::::::{{Gossip|With hard work and dedication, they earned back their place among their people.}}
::::::::{{Gossip|Although they took a great risk, their friends returned and rescued them with open arms.}}
:::::::::That made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside!

:::::::::I don't think it made me any more tired though...

:::::::::{{Gossip|Let's try something else.}}

Buy Acorn Milk from [[Elucia]] or [[Sugarbough]] in the [[Shady Sanctuary]] and give it to Posidriss.
:{{Gossip|Here, drink this!}}
:{{Text|say|Posidriss|Yuck! I don't like that at all.}}

Head back to mainland Ohn'ahran Plains and start killing [[Wild Argali]].
:{{Text|say|Posidriss|One argali...}}
:{{Text|say|Posidriss|Two argali...}}
:{{Text|say|Posidriss|Three argali...}}
:{{Text|say|Posidriss|Uh...}}
:{{Text|say|Posidriss|What comes after three?}}
:{{Text|say|Posidriss|...Seven... I think?}}
:{{Text|say|Posidriss|I need to practice my numbers.}}
:{{Text|say|Posidriss|I don't think this will work either. My brain hurts!}}
:{{Text|say|Posidriss|It's no use, <name>. I'll never be able to sleep well! Let's just go back home.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|Thank you for your help today <name>. Please come back tomorrow. We will need all the help we can get.}}
