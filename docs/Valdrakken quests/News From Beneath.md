==Description==
Before I arrived, I was informed that the Life-Binder has need of our aid. There is news of the [[Incarnates]], and she requests our presence at the Seat of the Aspects.

As for [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]] -- there is very little we can do for now. It is best we allow her to reflect and gather thoughts alone.

* 400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The [[Dragon Aspects|Aspects]] have gathered. Let us not keep them waiting.
