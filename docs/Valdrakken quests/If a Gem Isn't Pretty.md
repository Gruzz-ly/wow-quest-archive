==Description==
The kith of Loamm request the skills of a [[jewelcrafter]]! I have seen the wondrous sparkling gems in [[Valdrakken|this glorious city]], and the [[niffen]] below wish to see them as well. We don't see very well, so we know the value of a good sparkle!

Our chief Gemfinder and Jewelshiner, Miss Fanilly, wishes to see some beautiful gems. I bet she'd love the ones named after [[Alexstrasza]] and [[Ysera]]!

Please deliver them to Loamm as soon as you can, won't you?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Barter Brick
|Barter Boulder

==Progress==
Hello, hello! Did [[Kayann]] send you?

I'm eager to get my hands on those gems!

==Completion==
Oh, are these the gems? Hmmm... I have to admit, I was expecting them to be prettier!

I suppose they just need a bit of elbow grease and a spit shine! Watch this!

==Notes==
;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Fanilly|These raw gems just need a little love to show their true beauty!}}
:{{Text|say|Fanilly|I consider myself something of an expert on the matter.}}
:{{Text|say|Fanilly|A little cut here and a little polishing there and...}}
:{{Text|say|Fanilly|Look at that! These'll be the envy of the shiniest of cavern crystals! ...if crystals envied anything, I suppose.}}
:{{Text|say|Fanilly|So colorful... I hear in the upland, there's dragons that come in all kinds of pretty colors like these!}}
:{{Text|say|Fanilly|Maybe I'll have to take a trip up there some day and see for myself!}}

Completing the quest gives the adventurer Fanilly's Beautiful Inspiration buff.
