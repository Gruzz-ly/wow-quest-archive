'''An Expert Opinion''' is a quest part of the [[Azure Span storyline]].

==Objectives==
Talk to [[Patchu]] in The [[Azure Span]].

==Description==
[[:Lubbins]]' wounds may have healed, but I am afraid his confidence may still be injured. I believe it is time to call on others for help.

Far to the southwest in a remote section of the Azure Span there is a pet trainer named Patchu. She is one of the world's foremost experts on these matters.

Please visit her, I am sure she can help Lubbins!

==Completion==
Jyhanna sent you to the right [[Tuskarr]], <name>. We'll get Lubbins back to his old self in no time!
