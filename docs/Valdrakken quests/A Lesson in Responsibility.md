==Objectives==
Gather materials for [[Sir Pringly]]'s habitat.
*[[Stuffed Doll]]
*[[Decorative Shrubbery]]
*[[Soothing Incense (quest item)]]
*Habitat pieces placed (3)

==Description==
The [[Little Scales Daycare|daycare]] is always looking for new activities to enrich the education of the [[Dragon whelp|whelps]].

[[Lasztak]] has suggested a class pet might help teach the whelps responsibility. Sir Pringly has been my personal companion for some time, and I believe his calm demeanor and sense of fun would serve the position well.

Sir Pringly will need his own habitat for the daycare, however. If you would gather materials, we can prepare a space just for him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
There is a particular way that Sir Pringly likes his habitat constructed. If you get the materials I listed, he should like it.

==Completion==
The habitat is looking wonderful, <name>. I hope Sir Pringly will be on his best behavior.

==Notes==
Head to the southern part of the city and find [[Lysindra]].
