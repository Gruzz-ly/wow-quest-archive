==Objectives==
Deliver Pioneer's Leather Boots to [[Haephesta]] at the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]].
*[[Pioneer's Leather Boots]]

==Description==
Are you looking for work, leatherworker? The [[Artisan's Consortium]] asked me to craft some boots for their customers.

Clearly they don't understand my popularity. Do you know how many explorers have come through today complaining of holes in their shoes?

If you have the time, take these measurements. Perhaps this Artisan's Consortium could be a promising business opportunity for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|30|50}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Artisan's Consortium - Dragon Isles Branch]]

{{itembox||q1=4|Lustrous Scaled Hide

==Progress==
How can the Artisan's Consortium help you today?

==Completion==
A delivery! Excellent. Good doing business with you, <name>.
