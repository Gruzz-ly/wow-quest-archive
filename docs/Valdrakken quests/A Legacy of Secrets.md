'''A Legacy of Secrets''' concludes the eleventh day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Objectives==
Return the book, Tyr's Legacy, to [[Bobby Carlisle]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Tyr's Legacy]] (provided)

==Description==
<Return the book to Bobby Carlisle in Valdrakken to assist with deciphering the tablet text!>

==Progress==
Was my source any good? Were you able to find the book?

==Completion==
Of course you found it! You know, you could have a real future as a field investigator.

Tyr's Legacy, huh? Interesting. I'll start working with [[Preservationist Kathos|Kathos]] to see if we can decipher any of the text on those tablets. I'm sure this book is the key.

We're getting so close! I can already see the headlines.

==Notes==
This is the "Kirin Tor Knowledge" criterion of [[Whodunnit?]]
