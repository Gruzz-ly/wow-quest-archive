==Objectives==
Deliver the brochure to [[Calderax]] in the [[Gladiator's Refuge (Valdrakken)|Gladiator's Refuge]] of [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Artisan's Consortium Brochure]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Artisan's Consortium]] has struck one final deal with the quartermasters of the Gladiator's Refuge!

In addition to the usual selection of powerful combat equipment they offer, worthy combatants can purchase tokens that can be used in Crafting Orders or one's own crafts to certify the equipment for use in battlegrounds and arenas!

Present this brochure to Calderax to receive two complimentary Trophies of Conquest, on us!

- Rabul

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Draconic Trophy of Conquest]]
*[[Greater Draconic Trophy of Conquest]]

==Completion==
<Calderax grumbles something under his breath before proceeding with a very well practiced speech.>

Here are your trophies, as promised. Use them when crafting your own equipment or submitting Crafting Orders and the gear will be comparable in power to what I offer. It is perfect if you are looking for something highly specific or imbued with a certain embellishment... and are willing to put in some extra work.

Questions? Take them to the Artisan's Market.
