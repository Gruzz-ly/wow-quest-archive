==Objectives==
Gather 25 Stolen Trinkets from the [[gnoll]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Temnaayu]] of the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]].
*[[Stolen Trinket]] (10)

==Description==
The gnolls have quite a collection of trinkets. [[Tuskarr]] trinkets. They have either stolen them from our [[village]]s, or worse, from the brave tuskarr that fell in battle against them. These trinkets are our heritage and should reside with us.

If you bring some back to me, I will teach you the techniques that are used to make them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Jeweler's Cuts]]

==Progress==
Have you retrieved the Stolen Trinkets from the gnolls?

==Completion==
I recognize these trinkets. I remember those they originally belonged to. Thank you for returning them to us.
