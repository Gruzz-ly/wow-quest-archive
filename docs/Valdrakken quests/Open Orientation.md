==Objectives==
Complete the Orientation quests in each major faction hub: [[Dragonscale Basecamp]], [[Maruukai]], [[Iskaara]], and [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Orientation: Dragonscale Basecamp]] {{co|47.8|82.4|Waking Shores}}
*[[Orientation: Maruukai]] {{co|61.4|39.5|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
You have done much for the [[Dragon Isles]], hero. 

There are many who are grateful for your contributions and want to welcome you more wholly into their communities. Go to them and orient yourselves with each group and their specialties. 

I think you will find that just as you have much to offer the Dragon Isles, many here have much they wish to offer you in return!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62|}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
So many come every day asking after you. It can't be easy, being such a hero!

==Completion==
You've met everyone? Excellent. Maybe they will stop sending me emissaries, then. 

I hope you will continue to strengthen the bonds you have made with these communities. You have only to benefit each other.

==Notes==
Players would have come across these quests while on the level-up campaign, but if they got skipped, or for players in [[Adventure Mode]], now's a reminder to complete them.

==Progression==
