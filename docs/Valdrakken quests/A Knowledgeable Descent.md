'''A Knowledgeable Descent''' concludes the fifth day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Objectives==
Take the Unveiled Tablet Rubbing to [[Bobby Carlisle]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Unveiled Tablet Rubbing]] (provided)

==Description==
<The rubbing is in an ancient [[language]]. Perhaps Bobby Carlisle can get the text translated.>

==Progress==
Did you find anything?

==Completion==
You found [[Amerinth|someone]] trapped up there? And others were dead? Good thing you had [[Torch of Pyrreth|that torch]]!

<Bobby peers at the etching.>

I don't recognize this text. I'll show it to [[Preservationist Kathos]]. Hopefully whatever it says can help us figure out what this group is after.

==Notes==
Completing this quest is the "A Chilling Ascent" criterion of [[Whodunnit?]]

==Progression==
