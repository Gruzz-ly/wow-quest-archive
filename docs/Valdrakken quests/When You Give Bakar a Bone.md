==Objectives==
Craft 2 Bonewrought Crossbows for [[Hideshaper Koruz]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Bonewrought Crossbow]] (2)

==Description==
I had some of the most beautiful bonewrought bows, but our [[bakar]] got to them before they could be put to use. Bakar love to chew bones, whether bow or not, and now they are ruined!

Can you aid me in crafting replacements?

You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
Thank you <name>.

Here, take these designs. You can study them to improve your [[leatherworking]].
