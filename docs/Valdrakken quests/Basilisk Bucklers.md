==Objectives==
Gather 20 Rigid Crocolisk Hides from the [[basilisk]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Dhurrel]] of the [[Maruuk Centaurs]].
*[[Rigid Basilisk Hide]] (20)

==Description==
Interlinked scales are the key to stopping an arrow. The bucklers we make are the best in the plains. However, I am short of basilisk hides for my next order.

I see you are interested in learning about our crafts. Gather basilisk hides from around the Dragon Isles, and I will give you instruction on our techniques.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Leatherworking Designs]]

==Progress==
Do you have the hides?

==Completion==
These are of excellent quality! You have my thanks.

For your help, please take some of the extra leather we have in our stores. I can also give you some insight about your trade, as I promised.
