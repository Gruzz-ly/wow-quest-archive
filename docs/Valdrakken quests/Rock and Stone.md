==Objectives==
Gather 15 Earthen Samples from the [[earth elemental]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Dhurrel]] of the [[Maruuk Centaur]]s.
*[[Earthen Sample]] (15)

==Description==
Earth elementals in the Dragon Isles are composed of various rocks and [[mineral]]s. Our [[Smith|blacksmiths]] are thoroughly fascinated with the unique tools they are able to manufacture from [[smelting]] such materials. In fact, they appear to have smelted the last of their samples.

I would hate to ruin their fun. Would you mind replenishing the supply?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Blacksmith's Writ]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered enough Earthen Samples from the Elementals?

==Completion==
Ah, the blacksmiths will be pleased with these samples.
