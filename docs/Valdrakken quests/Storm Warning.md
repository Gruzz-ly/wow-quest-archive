'''Storm Warning''' breadcrumbs players to the [[Storm's Fury]] event in the [[Primalist Future]] of [[Thaldraszus]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Soridormi]] in the [[Primalist Future]]. The portal to the Primalist Future can be found at the [[Temporal Conflux]] in Thaldraszus.
*[[Portal to the Primalist Future]] taken (Optional) {{co|59.8|82.2|Thaldraszus}}
*Soridormi found {{co|61.1|50.8|Primalist Future}}

==Description==
Ah, <class>! I knew I would find you at the right place at the right time. 

The elements do not just threaten the [[Dragon Isles]] in our current time, but also from beyond. Go to the Temporal Conflux and travel through the rift into the future the primalists have overrun.

There, speak to Soridormi. She will have more details for you when you arrive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We meet again, <name>. We have more need for your help, I'm afraid.
