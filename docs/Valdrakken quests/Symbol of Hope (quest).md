'''Symbol of Hope''' concludes the "A Flame, Extinguished" chapter of the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]], and thus, of the campaign itself.

==Objectives==
Speak with Alexstrasza.
* Speak to [[Alexstrasza]]

==Description==
Champion--[[Ebyssian]], [[Sabellian]], and [[Wrathion]] have come to an agreement of who should lead, and are presenting a unified front. All three were quite eager to speak of your contributions and aid in [[Zaralek Cavern]] as well. It seems that they are also in agreement that they could not have succeeded without you.

High praise indeed--and well deserved.

Please, stay for a little longer. The [[Dragon Aspects|other Aspects]] and I have matters to discuss, and I believe you should be here as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Please, stay for a little longer. The other Aspects and I have matters to discuss, and I believe you should be here as well.

==Completion==
We still have much to do--but the sight of five united Aspects fills my heart with hope... and with joy.

Thank you. Your part in this will never be forgotten.

==Notes==
Speak with Alexstrasza again:
:Would you like to see what your hard work has wrought, <name>?
:{{gossip|quest=|Show me.}}

An [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|pZHichJgxqY}}
:''The aspects are all in their visage form.''
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Through great heroism and resilience, the threat of [[Aberrus]] has been quelled.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|[[Primal Incarnates|The Incarnates]] sought to use our [[Deathwing|fallen brother]]'s memory as a weapon.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|To divide us, turn us against each other, and weaken our resolve.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|They failed.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Confronting these shadows has only made us stronger.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Look upon us now.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|For the first time in an age, FIVE Aspects will take up our ancient charge once more, and stand beside the mortal champions who have aided us at every turn.}}
:''Alexstrasza nods to Merithra, who starts channeling a spell that whites out the scene.''

This is followed immediately by a pre-rendered cinematic:
{{#ev:youtube|sCcvLcSQx5o}}
:''The flash of white fades to show the [[Ancient Bough]], western [[Ohn'ahran Plains]] at night. A tree with purple leaves is growing in the lower portion of the frame, backdropped by a starry sky. A constellation of sparkles rises up from the tree, appearing as a much larger tree. The camera cuts forward, zooming in on [[Amirdrassil]], the new [[World Tree]].''
:{{text|bossemote|Alexstrasza|For soon, [[Azeroth]] will welcome from the dream a symbol of hope, and together we shall protect it.}}

After completing the quest, the Aspects have new gossip:

;Alexstrasza 
:Long ago, Neltharion was a dear, dear friend. I regret that I was never able to reach him, to help him break free of the corruption that blighted [[Black dragonflight|his entire flight]].
:I should not linger on the past. It is far too late to make amends with him, I know.
:But... perhaps there are others I can reach.
;Merithra
:Such a small seed... but fueled by hope and by love, it thrives. The time will come when it will leave the Dream and come into Azeroth, grown and ready to fulfill its purpose.
:It was not until recently that I realized I, too, have a purpose to fulfill. My flight needed an Aspect. I have filled that role for years, afraid to acknowledge it.
:If I did, then mother would truly be gone.
:But she is not gone... and I am not a child. It is my place to lead [[Green dragonflight|my flight]], and I gladly do so.
;Kalecgos
:Our troubles may be far from over, but for the first time since the Primal Incarnates were released, my heart is warm with hope that we will succeed.
:[[Blue dragonflight|My flight]] is not my only family, friend. The Aspects and their [[Dragonflight|flights]] are part of it as well. It's been long since we've come together like this. I... missed it.
:Thank you, for all you have done. If it was not clear by now, I consider you a part of my family as well.
;Nozdormu
:As much as I would like to enjoy this victory, I cannot.
:[[Murozond|The moment I feared]] draws ever closer, and there is nothing I can do to stop it. One can turn the hourglass to change the flow of the sands, but that only delays the inevitable. It does not negate it.
:When that moment comes to pass, I know you will do what must be done.
:I thank you now, before I am no longer able to do so.
;Ebyssian
:I do not expect [[Sabellian]] and [[Wrathion]] to become the best of friends--but I am pleased to see them work together. My flight spent thousands of years consumed with corruption, paranoia, and chaos. We need unity, now more than ever.
:Your aid has not gone unnoticed. There is hope for the future of the black dragonflight, because of you.
:Thank you.

Completing this quest also awards [[Embers of Neltharion (achievement)]].
