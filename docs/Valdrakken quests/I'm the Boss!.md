==Progress==
<The bags under [[Agapanthus]]'s eyes are even deeper than usual.>

==Completion==
Not only does she need to learn patience, but she also needs to learn that she is not the center of the universe!

==Notes==
;Speaking with Belastrasza
:One day, I'm going to be just like Queen [[Alexstrasza]]!

:{{Gossip|quest=|I am here to help with your list.}}
:{{Text|say|Belastrasza|You're gonna help me? Fine. But Lasztak still has to, too!}}

[[Sweet Snapflower Bulb]]s are looted in the [[Wild Preserve]] in the [[Waking Shores]].

;Speaking with Lasztak
:{{Gossip|quest=|(Quest) Belastrasza has demanded your assistance.}}
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|Ah, whatever she needs I shall be there right away!}}
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|Lasztak, look at yourself. She is but a whelp who orders you as if a servant. Catering to her every word only does her a disservice.}}
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|Agapanthus, I... You are right. I must not spoil her so.}}

;Speaking to [[Studious Whelp]]s
*Sometimes people find a lot of gold and silver in rocks!
*Every time you go in a cave, you find a [[bear]] and [[bat]]s fly at you.
*If I met a gnoll, I would poke him with a stick.

:<The whelp nods matter-of-factly.>
*Volcanoes have pipes under them where lava goes!
*I can't read.

:{{Gossip|quest=|Will you play with Belastrasza?}}
*{{Text|say|Studious Whelp|No way! Belastrasza is no fun.}}
*{{Text|say|Studious Whelp|Last time I played with Bela, she said I was playing wrong and took the toys out of my claws and made me watch her play.}}
*{{Text|say|Studious Whelp|I won't play with her anymore. She's bossy!}}

;Speaking to [[Playful Whelp]]s
*Tag! You're it!
*<The whelp stares off into the distance, muttering under their breath.>

:Are they gonna be home for dinner?
*Are you gonna want your front teeth?
*<the whelp stares at you very seriously.>

:If you give me a milkshake, I will give you THREE potatoes.
*How many [[beaver]]s can you fit in your pocket?

:{{Gossip|quest=|Will you play with Belastrasza?}}
*{{Text|say|Playful Whelp|No way, she's a fun ruiner!}}
*{{Text|say|Playful Whelp|Once she told me I was using the wrong voice for my plushie ducky and decided to do the talking for me...}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|We have done all we can for today <name>. Come back tomorrow if you can. I am certain we will have need of you.}}
