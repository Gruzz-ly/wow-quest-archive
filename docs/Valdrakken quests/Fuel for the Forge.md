==Objectives==
Gather 10 Magma Cores from the lava creatures of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Dhurrel]] of the [[Maruuk Centaurs]].
*[[Magma Core]] (10)

==Description==
To make the best blades, you need the heat that only a Magma Core can provide. We try to keep a few on hand as a fuel source for our forges. Lately, we've been running low on cores and could use a resupply.

Magma Cores are obtainable from most lava creatures in the Dragon Isles.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Blacksmith's Writ]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered the Magma Cores?

==Completion==
The blacksmiths will be glad to have this resupply for their forges.

==Patch changes==
