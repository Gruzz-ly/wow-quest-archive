==Objectives==
Gather supplies for the [[Emerald Hatchling]]'s nest.
*[[Loamy Soil (item)]] (5)
*[[Ancient Water]]
*[[Comforting Ducky]]
*Nest pieces placed (3)

==Description==
[[Green dragon]]s prefer a home that is both natural and mystical, imbued with the power of the [[Emerald Dream]].

The [[Emerald Gardens]] will certainly have many materials with which to build an appropriate nest for this little one. Perhaps we should speak to a member of [[Green dragonflight|their flight]] to find something to bring them comfort as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
We will have to maximize this hatchling's comfort to allow them to rest well and grow.

==Completion==
May this whelp grow roots strong and firm.

Not literally, of course.

==Notes==
At the gardens kill [[Giant Lasher]]s and [[Vigorous Lasher]]s to loot Loamy Soils.

Find the [[Water Jug]] in the [[Ancient Bough]] at {{co|18.89|49.16|Ohn'ahran Plains}} to obtain the Ancient Water.

Comforting Ducky is obtained from [[Mysindre]].
