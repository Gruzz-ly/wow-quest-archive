==Objectives==
Speak with 8 residents of the Dragon Isles and listen to their stories.
*[[Dragon Isles]] residents interviewed (8)

==Description==
I worry about [[Emberthal]]. Her mood has grown increasingly dark.

By sticking to citizens of the city, she is looking for ways she is similar to them, instead of what makes her unique.

Perhaps a broader sample size is in order?

She needs stories to guide her. There are many such individuals with stories to tell in the Dragon Isles.

Go, and speak with them.

Would that I could go myself, but the duties of a [[Scalecommander]] never rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* [[Personal Tabard]]

==Progress==
Have you spoken with everyone?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. If these do not help Emberthal, I do not think anything can.

==Notes==
Characters can be spoken with in any order, but will require their side quests to be completed to continue. The locations in this table list the character locations ''before'' starting their quest chains. The sections below (and the Dragon Isles map) will list their post-quest locations, if different.

===Waking Shores===
In the [[Waking Shores]], head to the [[Restless Wetlands]] at {{co|74.5|42.2|Waking Shores}} and speak with [[Ecologist Iskha]]:
{{dialogue|We are watching an ecological collapse, and while I agree we must do something, we shouldn't allow ourselves to act rashly.

{{Gossip|quest=|What makes you who you are?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
That's quite the question!

<Iskha pauses to think for a moment.>

Well, before I met Tharu, I was even slower to act than I am now. I've always preferred to wait and see, and take a measured approach.

That hasn't changed, but Tharu has helped me come out of my hesitant shell, so to speak.

He respects who I am, but also complements it.

I'm half of both of our whole.}}}}

If players have not completed the "Save the Hippos!" storyline starting with [[A Scalpel of a Solution]], Ishka instead says:
{{dialogue|I do not have time to discuss this right now. Tharu and I have more important matters at hand regarding the ecosystem. Perhaps you can assist?}}

Also speak with [[Ecologist Tharu]]:
{{dialogue|{{Gossip|quest=|What makes you who you are?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I've always been sure of myself.

Ask Iskha, and he'd describe me as rash, bold, and impulsive. He's not wrong!

<Tharu laughs.>

But, I think being with Iskha has balanced me out. We're more opposite than two [[dragonspawn]] can be, and yet I feel more complete with him by my side.

Our differences highlight what makes us unique.}}}}

If players have not completed the "Save the Hippos!" storyline starting with [[Wildlife Rescue]], Tharu instead says:
{{dialogue|I do not have time to discuss this right now. Ishka and I have more important matters at hand regarding the ecosystem. Perhaps you can assist?}}

===Ohn'ahran Plains===
In the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]], travel to [[Maruukai]] at {{Co|62.8|35.4|Ohn'ahran Plains}} and speak with [[Windsage Dawa]]:
{{dialogue|Greetings, friend.

{{Gossip|quest=|What makes you who you are?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
A large part of who I am stems from love for Narman.

Oh yes, there was much grumbling and stamping of hooves on behalf of [[Elder Odgerel]].

It is true, we skipped many ceremonies and traditions. But, our love was true, and we knew it was time.

I am grateful that our clans agree.}}}}

If players have not completed the storyline starting with [[Shikaar Giver]], Dawa instead says:
{{dialogue|Please, I have more important things to do before I speak about this. Will you assist me in planning a proposal for my beloved?}}

Also speak with [[Hunter Narman]] at {{co|63.6|40.5|Ohn'ahran Plains}} further south:
{{dialogue|I have devoted my life to the hunt, but the time has come for me to devote myself to another. I only hope that I am as capable a partner as I am a [[hunter]].

{{Gossip|quest=|What makes you who you are?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
My clan's tradition dictates that I was to marry a master hunter, worthy of being at my side.

From the moment I met Dawa, I knew that could not be the case.

Tradition is important, yes. Being part of [[Clan Shikaar]] is a big part of who I am, but it is not all of it.

I instead chose to follow my heart, and I am fortunate that [[Saran Khan]] saw that I was true.}}}}

Same as with Dawa, players need to complete the [[Bloodlines, Sweets, and Teerai]] storyline:
{{dialogue|I have something I need to attend to, first. I am planning a proposal and could use your help.}}

If done with [[The Lonely Scout]], find the entrance to the [[Mane Squeeze]] at {{co|38.7|48.0|Ohn'ahran Plains}} and head inside to speak with [[Scout Santuun]]:
{{dialogue|<Scout Santuun grins happily.>

Thanks again for all your help!

{{Gossip|quest=|What makes you who you are?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Hello, <name>. 

[[Dryad]]s and [[centaur]]s might look like they're similar, but we're very different. But who says opposites don't attract!

Many of my clan consider any time spent with a dryad is wasted, better spent elsewhere. They say that there's no way a dryad can focus for long enough on anything that's not in the gardens.

Maybe that's the case, but I'm still drawn to them. It's just my nature, I suppose.

Many thanks for helping me out.}}}}

[[Erynna]] has gossip too:
{{dialogue|<Erynna smirks slyly. She seems rather pleased with the situation.>}}

If not, head to {{co|34.2|54.0|Ohn'ahran Plains}} in the [[Emerald Gardens]] and speak with Scout Santuun there:
{{dialogue|Any time I try to talk to one of the dryads, they just giggle and bounce away.

How can I get their attention? Hunt some fine prey? Rescue some... helpless ducklings?

{{gossip|quest=|What makes you who you are?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Actually, I need some help regarding some Dryads, if you wouldn't mind helping?}}}}

If done with the Drawing Conclusions storyline, continue to the [[Emerald Gardens]] and speak with [[Waywatcher Alvi]] at {{co|33.2|49.5|Ohn'ahran Plains}}:
{{dialogue|It is good to see you, friend! I've just started on my latest work.

I have a good feeling about this one. Nori says she will hang it up back at Gelikyr if it's up to snuff.

{{Gossip|quest=|What makes you who you are?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
At some level, I have always known my path was to be an artist.

I simply did not fit into the mold of [[Waywatchers|Waywatcher]].

I am much happier now that I have accepted it, instead of trying to force myself to be something I am not.

It is a strange sort of peace, to finally stop fighting it.

To accept that sometimes, you must defy others' expectations of you.}}}}

Otherwise, find Alvi at {{co|54.7|69.5|Thaldraszus}} at the [[Passage of Time]] in [[Thaldraszus]] where he starts [[Supplying in Weight]] and [[A Sketchy Request]]:
{{dialogue|Mind yourself if you intend to travel through this pass. The tarasek that live in the area have begun to attack anyone who looks like they have valuables to
steal.

{{Gossip|quest=|What makes you who you are?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I have to deal with the tarasek that have ransacked my camp first! Please, help?}}}}

===Azure Span===
Head to {{co|12.9|22.0|Azure Span}} in [[Creektooth Den]] in the [[Azure Span]] to speak with [[Gnoll Mon-Ark]]:
{{dialogue|You make okay gnoll, but better friend.

<They look over your shoulder.>

Other friends hungry though. Run!

{{Gossip|quest=|What makes you who you are?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Me not like other [[gnoll]]s. Me first gnoll Mon-Ark!

Other gnolls not make friends.

Me like having friend.

No want change.}}}}

If players have not completed the Creektooth Den storyline, starting with [[By Royal Decree]] and [[Rot Rancher]], Mon-Ark will instead be at the south end of Creektooth Den at {{co|16.2|20.9|Azure Span}} and will instead say:

{{dialogue|<The gnoll constantly adjusts a paper crown on their head.>

Me first gnoll Mon-Ark. Gnolls dumb. Not obey crown! Need teach them.

You help me, I no eat you. Fair, meat?

{{Gossip|quest=|What makes you who you are?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
No time. More important things. Help first.}}}}

===Thaldraszus===
In [[Thaldraszus]], go to the center of [[Tyrhold Reservoir]] at {{Co|49.5|58.9|Thaldraszus}} and speak with [[Zuttiki]]:
{{dialogue|Above all else, my sworn duty is to serve Lady Mara.

{{Gossip|quest=|What makes you who you are?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Serving [[Mara]] has always been my most honored duty.

Though I was built to serve this role, I have never found it to be uncomfortable or ill-fitting.

I take pride in my service. All of Lady Mara's [[refti]] do.

There is great comfort in knowing with certainty what one's purpose is, is there not?

That is who I am.}}}}

If players have not completed Zuttiki's storyline starting with [[Wotcher, Watcher?]]:
{{dialogue|I do not have time to discuss this. Mara cannot wait. Please, can you help us?}}

===Finale===
On complete:
:{{Text|say|[[Scalecommander Emberthal]]|Everyone! After hearing these stories, I've finally made my decision.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Chromie]]|How exciting!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Scalecommander Cindrethresh]]|Finally! I can't wait to see it!}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I have decided to not choose a [[visage]] at all.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Huh?}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I do not need one.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|<Name>, the stories you brought me weren't about finding yourself. They were about accepting yourself.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|This is who I am, and it is enough.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Scalecommander Viridia]]|Oh Emberthal, I am relieved to hear it.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Does this mean the celebration is off the table?}}
:{{Text|say|Chromie|Not if I have anything to do about it!}}
:''[[Kalec]], Viridia, Cindre, and Chromie all shoot fireworks.''

Emberthal has new gossip:
{{dialogue|I am glad to have arrived at my truth. I do not require a visage form. This is truly me.}}
