==Objectives==
Acquire 50 Flightstones by defeating unique creatures, conquering [[dungeon]]s and [[raid]]s, completing world activities, or by looting caches. Then speak to [[Cuzolth]] and upgrade a piece of [[Season 4]] equipment using Flightstones.
*Upgrade a piece of equipment with [[Flightstones]]

==Description==
It's so exciting to be in [[Valdrakken]]! [[Cuzolth]] and I have never been here before. And it's everything we hoped it would be. Some of the others have even introduced themselves. They actually thanked us for our work studying Flightstones and Crests. That's every researcher's dream!

So I need your help again. Could you find some Flightstones and a new piece of adventuring gear? Then come back to Cuzolth for an upgrade? It would really help us solidify our new position here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]
*100x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
There's no need to hurry. But if you wouldn't mind hurrying anyway...

==Completion==
My friend! You are truly a supportive breeze in flight. Please take these tokens of thanks.
