==Objectives==
Help put the [[Little Scales Daycare]] back into order.
*Birds scared (9)
*Sand cleared (3)
*[[Hungry Crawler]] slain (6)

==Description==
[[Dragon whelp|Young whelps]] can be careless in how they treat their space. The daycare is effectively under siege day in and day out!

Help clean up the daycare. The new whelps will need a proper place to stay.

I will not let one claw set down on unpolished stone or overgrown grass!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Is there anything better than squaring away a space?

==Completion==
This should do for your first sweep of the daycare. Good work, <name>.

I believe our curriculum is off to a good start. Now we must await the whelps.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|Let us prepare curriculum for the incoming whelps, Lasztak.}}
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|Yes, Sir!}}

Around the Daycare, [[Dreadsquall Hatchling]]s are making [[Scared Whelp]] Terrified! Just approach the dreadsqualls and they fly away. Also, find and interact with the [[Lost Sand]] and kill [[Hungry Crawler]]s.

;Two objectives completed
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|Have you developed curriculum for whelps before, Lasztak?}}
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|I have some lesson plans I developed as a student, but not a full course.}}
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|Lasztak, these are stellar. Where did you learn to prepare these?}}
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|I trained with other dragonspawn in a small cohort until I was ready to receive my Calling.}}

;All objectives completed
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|But that was only study in a controlled environment. Your experience facing the Legion is admirable, Sir.}}
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|Do not sell yourself short, Lasztak. We have much we can learn from one another.}}
