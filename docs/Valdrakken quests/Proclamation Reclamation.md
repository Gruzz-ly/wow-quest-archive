==Objectives==
Collect 10 Infused Proclamations.
*[[Infused Proclamation]] (10)

==Description==
You know who likes to hear themselves talk, loves bureaucracy, and enchants their own records? [[Dragon]]s!

Go poke around in the old [[black dragon]] fort north of [[Loamm]]. I'm sure they'll be all sort of [[magic]]-ish decrees, proclamations, and shopping lists just lying around!

Bring whatever you uncover to [[Scridorsa the Chiseler]] back in Loamm. I'm sure she'd love something new and heavily enchanted to read!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Scribe's Glyphs
}}

==Progress==
Can't do anything simply, can they?

==Completion==
<Scridorsa flips through the documents.>

"By my hand...", "The will of the [[Deathwing|Earth-Warder]]...", "At my command..." Sounds like a dragon, sure enough!

Still, these should make for an interesting study, if not read.
