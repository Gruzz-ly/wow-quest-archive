==Objectives==
Meet [[Captain Drine]] at the top floor of the [[Seat of the Aspects]].

I am impressed with what you have accomplished today. I hope you agree, <name>.

We have successfully shut down the nefarious activities of these [[Primalists|Primalist]]-allied [[Flightless|rebels]]. For now at least. We will need to keep a close watch on any dissent going forward.

Return to Captain Drine at your earliest convenience. She will want our full report.

* 1,050 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
Welcome back, <name>.

My eyes and ears have just told me the good news.
