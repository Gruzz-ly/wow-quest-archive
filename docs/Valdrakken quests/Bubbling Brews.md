==Objectives==
Collect brew bubbles in [[Valdrakken]].
*Bubbles Collected (0/100%)

==Description==
Drat! I might've made a mistake asking the [[dracthyr]] to help with these deliveries. They've been rolling barrels of brews through the city and crashing 'em all over the place! Well, we shouldn't let the brew go to waste if we can help it!

Take a barrel an' take to the skies! Try to collect and save as much of the brew as you can by collecting the bubbles.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||20}}
*1,400 [[XP]]
*x10 [[Brewfest Prize Token]]

==Progress==
Have ye filled up the barrel?

==Completion==
Thank ye kindly for the help. Now if I can just convince the dracthyr to simply fly the barrels here instead of rolling 'em...

==Notes==
Mount up and ride through the small (+5%) and big (+10%) bubbles above the market.

==Patch changes==
