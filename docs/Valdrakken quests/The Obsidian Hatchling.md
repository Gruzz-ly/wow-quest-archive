==Description==
An egg from the [[black dragonflight]] is ready to hatch.

Report to [[Mother Elion]] in the Ruby Lifeshrine to pick up the egg. Then, I request that you bring the egg to the Obsidian Oathstone to hatch in a location strong with their flight's power.

Once this is complete, return here with the hatchling, where we will further take care of it.

<A small smile creeps on [[Lasztak]]'s face.>

It has been quite a long time.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Mother Elion
:{{Gossip|quest=|I am here to bring the egg to Valdrakken.}}
:{{Text|say|Mother Elion|Do not forget that this egg symbolizes the future of our flight. She is not beholden to our past.}}

Head to the Obsidian Oathstone and use the Hatch Egg extra action button. A short cutscene starts with the whelp hatching and approaching the adventurer. Return to the daycare to turn in the quest.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|We have done all we can for today <name>. Come back tomorrow if you can. I am certain we will have need of you.}}

The [[Obsidian Hatchling (Valdrakken)|Obsidian Hatchling]] is now found in the daycare.
