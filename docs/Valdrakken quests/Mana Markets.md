==Objectives==
Craft 10 Aerated Mana Potions for [[Conflago]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Aerated Mana Potion]] (10)

==Description==
Demand for mana potions has increased dramatically this week, <name>. I will need your assistance filling customers' orders. Surely as a skilled [[alchemist]] you can spare a few, yes?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Alchemy Notes
}}

==Progress==
Our customers are waiting.

==Completion==
Thank you <name>. My alchemy is brilliant but my customer service leaves something to be desired. I am glad you were here to help me fill these orders.

Here, study this. Even as a skilled alchemist, there is more for you to learn.

==Notes==
The Aerated Mana Potions have to be gold quality. They can be traded or bought off from Auction House.
