==Description==
Hi, <name>.

<Ruszi looks around nervously.>

Do you want to play hide and seek with me? I think it would be very good training.

I need to watch out for danger, so it is good to know where to hide. Will you help me practice?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
*5x [[Flightstones]]

{{itembox|You will also receive one from:|Battle Pet Bandage
|Beast Battle-Training Stone
|Humanoid Battle-Training Stone
|Mechanical Battle-Training Stone
}}

==Completion==
You found all of us! I think I am getting better at hiding. I cannot wait to play again!

<Ruszi does a spin.>

This was super super fun!

The Azure Whelpling is at the engineering, the mining shop, or the blacksmithing building.
