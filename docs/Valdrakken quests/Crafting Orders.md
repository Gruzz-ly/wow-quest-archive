*Crafting Orders viewed from Mimzy Sprazzlerock {{co|34.5|63.0|Valdrakken}}

==Description==
That's a nifty thing you got there from the titan device. Now hand it over!

Just kiddin'! I wouldn't know the first thing about how to use that. Do you?

Go talk to Mimzy Sprazzlerock. She's got a whole gig setup findin' folks to do something called "crafting orders".

You put up the goods, someone takes 'em and crafts something for you. 

Simple, right? Go talk to Mimzy to check it out! And don't tell her I sent you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62|}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<You can return to any Crafting Order representative to put in more orders for new equipment as long as you have the components!>

==Notes==
Head over to the [[Artisan's Market]] and speak with [[Mimzy Sprazzlerock|Head Clerk Mimzy Spazzlerock]] to view the Crafting Order interface.

That's enough for this quest, which can be turned remotely in from the quest log.
