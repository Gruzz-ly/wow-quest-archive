==Description==
Recently there has been an overpopulation of a few different species on the Dragon Isles. In particular, the rockfang and the bruffalon.

We don't want to be wasteful, of course. Be sure to collect as much of the hides as you can from the creatures.

Have you dealt with the overpopulation and brought back some hides?

Thank you for handling the situation and for not wasting the hides.
