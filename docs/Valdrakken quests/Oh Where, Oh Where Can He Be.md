==Objectives==
Rescue [[:Lubbins]] and bring him back to [[Jyhanna]] at the [[Little Scales Daycare]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*Find Lubbins
*Help Lubbins

==Description==
<Name>, I am glad to see you! I am worried sick and could use your help.

Recently, I rescued an abandoned [[proto-drake]] whelp. I named him Lubbins because he is so lovely! I brought him here to care for him and hopefully find him a good home as someone's pet. 

But now he is missing, and I am concerned that he is lost or hurt. I need to keep watch over the rest of my little ones, otherwise I would go searching for him myself. Would you please look for him?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Lubbins]]
*10x [[Battle Pet Bandage]]

==Progress==
I hope Lubbins is safe. I am terribly worried.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I am so relieved to see little Lubbins safe and sound.
 
Oh! He seems to have taken a liking to you!

==Progression==
{{Lovin' Lubbins}}
