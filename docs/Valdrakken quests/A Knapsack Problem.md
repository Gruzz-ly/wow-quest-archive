==Objectives==
Craft 1 Simply Stitched Reagent Bag for [[Threadfinder Fulafong|Fulafong]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Simply Stitched Reagent Bag]]

==Description==
If there is one thing I have learned in my years as a seamstress, <name>, it is that you can never have enough space for your reagents. In fact, we could use a few more bags around here to hold everything. Would you mind stitching another?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Tailoring Examples
}}

==Progress==
Do you have the bag?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. This will do just fine.

Please, learn from these examples. Study them to improve your [[tailoring]].

And stay away from anyone offering you infinite storage space. You do not want to know what lies down that road.
