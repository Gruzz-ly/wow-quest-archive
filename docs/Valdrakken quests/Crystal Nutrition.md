==Objectives==
Gather 6 Bite-Sized Ley Crystals from [[Brackenhide Hollow]] for the Azure Hatchling.
*[[Bite-Sized Ley Crystal]] (6)
*[[Azure Hatchling (Valdrakken)|Azure Hatchling]] fed

==Description==
Yes, [[blue dragon]]s eat normal food, but the most important part of their diet is [[magic]]al in nature. Wherever the [[Blue dragonflight|blue flight]] can be found, you can be sure there is a source of nutritious ley crystals nearby.

Of course, the homelands of the blue dragons became home to many others during their absence. The brackenhide [[gnoll]]s have settled in our lands with the most ley crystals and taken them for themselves. You will need to enter their camps to reclaim the crystals for our [[whelp]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
From the moment they hatch, [[dragon]]s have incredibly sharp teeth.

==Completion==
The gnolls are not the first to steal our ley crystals, and they certainly will not be the last.

==Notes==
Find the crystals in [[Brackenhide Outskirts]] and [[Brackenhide Brambles]]. Then return to the hatchling and speak with him to feed him.
