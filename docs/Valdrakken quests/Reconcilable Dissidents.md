==Objectives==
Listen to Alexstrasza's conversation with [[Instigator Belaphon]].
*Speak to [[Alexstrasza]]

==Description==
My hope, <name>, is that our work to understand [[Flightless|the rebels]] will allow us to find a path to peace.

My concern is if we are not able to come to an understanding with Belaphon, other rebels may see her as a martyr for the cause.

Whatever happens, you have my gratitude for your assistance throughout this rebellion.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*[[the Reconciler]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 51,350 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
I hope Belaphon can see the way forward for [[Dragonkin]].

==Completion==
This crisis has driven us to a better understanding of each other, and driven me to be a better leader.

And we could not have found the way to peace without your help. <name>, thank you.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Alexstrasza
:I hope Belaphon can see the way forward for Dragonkin.

:{{Gossip|quest=|What happens now?}}
::Now Belaphon and I will talk about her rebellion, the future of the dragonkin, and the rights they shall have.

:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Belaphon, this rebellion has gone long enough. As has our poor treatment of the dragonkin.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I've asked <name> to bring you to the [[Seat of the Aspects]] so we can discuss the rights and respect that are fair to dragonkin.}}
:{{Text|say|Instigator Belaphon|I'm glad you've come to see reason! We've fought long and hard for...}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Belaphon! This decision comes in spite of your violence, not because of it.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Dragonkin - including many of your rebels - are now dead because of this rebellion. Many of them were innocent, and none needed to die.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|But, in talking with our rebel prisoners, I've come to see our treatment of dragonkin has been, at times, disrespectful, inconsiderate, and unfair.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|We [[dragon]]s must hold ourselves to a higher standard, and it shall begin with treating dragonkin fairly and as equals.}}
:{{Text|say|Instigator Belaphon|That is what I fought for.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|You, however, must still pay for your crimes.}}
:{{Text|say|Instigator Belaphon|My actions were to make the plight of dragonkin known!}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|And how many of your own kin were sacrificed so you could make that plight known?}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|However, it's my understanding that you have a way with words, and with quills.}}
:{{Text|say|Instigator Belaphon|Yes, that is indeed true.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|From this day forward, we will invite the dragonkin to join us in our work, not demand or require it. With respect as part of [[Dragonflight|the flights]], not mere servants of them.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|If you would willingly put your words and your quills to work explaining these new realities, and this grand invitation to defend [[Azeroth]] together...}}
:{{Text|say|Instigator Belaphon|Yes, I would do this for my people.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Then I will defer your sentence while you do this work.}}
:{{Text|say|Instigator Belaphon|As long as the dragons honor this pact, so will I.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Maldra, your assistance has been invaluable throughout this struggle.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Would you be willing to take up this invitation? To serve alongside the dragons to protect [[Dragon Isles|these isles]] and Azeroth?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Maldra Flametongue]]|My queen, I am honored by your request, considering my past aiding the rebellion.}}
:{{Text|say|Maldra Flametongue|I will consider your request, but for now I must decline. It will take time to see if the dragons will truly abide this equal relationship.}}
:{{Text|say|Maldra Flametongue|If I see dragonkin treated fairly throughout the isles over time, perhaps I will return to offer my aid.}}
:{{Text|say|Maldra Flametongue|It's much harder to change actions than to make proclamations.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I see. I'm sorry to hear that, but you are completely free to make that choice.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Your help will always be welcome, should you change your mind.}}
