'''Drums Here!''' becomes available after reaching 50 skillpoints in [[Dragon Isles Leatherworking]].

==Objectives==
Craft 2 Feral Hide Drums for [[Hideshaper Koruz]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Feral Hide Drums]] (2)

==Description==
We are known far and wide for our drums--the [[centaur]] have been honing these skills for generations. Unfortunately this means that our drums are in short supply these days.

You have skills of your own, I see. Perhaps you could help me craft a few drums for our stores?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Leatherworking Designs
}}

==Progress==
Your skills are quite impressive--where did you learn to craft?

==Completion==
[[Ohn'ahra]] bless you, <name>.

Here, have these designs. You can study them to improve your [[leatherworking]].

==Notes==
The Feral Hide Drums can be traded or bought from Auction House.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
