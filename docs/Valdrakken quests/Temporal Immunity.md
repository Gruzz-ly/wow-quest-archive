==Progress==
I believe in Zhusa. I hope you do too.

A sneeze without a teleport! A breakthrough to be proud of.

Now that he won't get lost, Zhusadormu will want to join you on some quests{{sic}}

==Notes==
Head to the usual spot of Wurallie who has [[Sporeflower]] out. [[Lasztak]], Zhusadormu, [[Annuna]] are near her. Near them is Zhusadormu from the past.
