'''A Secretive Contact''' kicks off the second day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]].

==Completion==
Hey there, I'm a reporter for the [[Eye of Azeroth]].

I'm investigating some strange activity in [[Valdrakken]]. Want to help?

I've got a source, but they'll only speak to someone wearing a 'Thinking Cap'. It's supposed to focus thoughts or some such. Anyway, I made a list of components and who you can get them from.

Track them down, then we'll talk more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Bobby Carlisle's Thinking Cap Notes]]

==Notes==

The notes read:
{{:Bobby Carlisle's Thinking Cap Notes}}

===Thought Calculating Apparatus===
[[File:Erugosa.png|thumb|upright|[[Erugosa]]]]
Speak with [[Erugosa]] a few yards away in the inn:

{{book|content=
Hello traveler, are you interested in the culinary arts?

{{gossip|I hear you make a delicious thunderspine nest dish? Could you make some for me?}}

Oh, I do make a great thunderspine nest. But if you want some, you'll need to bring me the ingredients.

I get my thunderspine from [[Agurahl the Butcher]] in the [[Timberstep Outpost]] in the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].

My apexis asiago is sourced right here in Valdrakken from [[Gorgonzormu]].

I recently began incorporating latticed stinkhorn which I discovered in [[Loamm]]. [[Sniktak]] usually has it in stock. 

I'll need at least five of each to make a batch of ten for you!

{{gossip|Could you write that down for me?}}
}}

Erugosa hands players the [[Thunderspine Nest Shopping List]], which reads:

{{:Thunderspine Nest Shopping List}}

[[Gorgonzormu]] is at {{co|29.0|65.1|Valdrakken}} in the [[Artisan's Market]]. Buy five [[Apexis Asiago]] for {{cost|3|75}}.

[[Agurahl the Butcher]] is at {{co|85.2|23.5|Ohn'ahran Plains}} in the [[Timberstep Outpost]] in northeastern [[Ohn'ahran Plains]]. Buy five [[Thunderspine Tenders]] for {{cost|3|75}}.

[[Sniktak]] is at {{co|54.1|56.7|Zaralek Cavern}} at the western end of [[Loamm]] in [[Zaralek Cavern]]. Buy five [[Latticed Stinkhorn]] for {{cost|3|75}}.

</gallery>

Once all of those are gathered, return to Erugosa:

{{book||content=
{{gossip|I have the ingredients for the thunderspine nest.}}

Oh, that's great!

Let me see what you've brought.

{{gossip|<Hand Erugosa the ingredients and watch as she uses hints of what looks like flame breath on them.>}}
}}

[[File:Clinkyclick Shatterboom.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Clinkyclick Shatterboom]]]]
She crafts ten [[Thunderspine Nest]]. Take them to [[Clinkyclick Shatterboom]], the engineering trainer located at {{co|42.2|48.7|Valdrakken}} between the inn and the PvP room in the [[Obsidian Enclave]]. If the player does not have the nest, she says:
{{book||content=
I can instruct you in engineering.  Interested?

{{gossip|What do you know about a Thinking Cap?}}

A what? Oh, can't talk now, so busy. If you need Engineering training let me know, otherwise, back to work for me.
}}

If the player does have five nests:

{{book|content=
{{gossip|What do you know about a Thinking Cap?}}

A what? Oh, can't ta... do I smell Thunderspine Nest. Uh-hmm, yes, you were looking for info on the Thinking Cap right? I'd be open to a trade...

{{gossip|<Offer some of the thunderspine nest to Clinkyclick Shatterboom for the Thought Calculating Apparatus.>}}
}}

She hands over the [[Thought Calculating Apparatus]].

===Downy Helmet Liner===
[[File:Gryffin.png|thumb|upright|[[Gryffin]]]]
[[Gryffin]] the gryphon, [[Clinkyclick Shatterboom]]'s assistant, is a few yards away at the engineering area:

{{book||content=
<Gryffin looks at you quizzically, holds out the spanner in his beak, and shrugs his wings.>
}}

Go loot a [[Fresh Tyranha]] that drops from the [[Hungering Tyranha]] at {{co|36|67|Thaldraszus}} in the [[Cascades]] of [[Thaldraszus]], just south of Valdrakken, then return to Gryffin:

{{book||content=
{{Gossip|<Hold up the fresh tyranha to Gryffin.>}}

<Gryffin eyes the tyranha and his ocular zooms in three clicks.

After a few seconds, Gryffin lifts his right wing, revealing a couple Downy Helmet Liners.>

{{Gossip|<Throw the tyranha to Gryffin and snatch a Downy Helmet Liner.>}}
}}

Gryffin tosses the [[Downy Helmet Liner]] to the player.

===Crystal Ocular Lenses===
[[File:Shakey Flatlap.png|thumb|upright|[[Shakey Flatlap]]]]
[[Shakey Flatlap]], the Jewelcrafting supplies vendor, is located at {{co|39.0|61.9|Valdrakken}} in the [[Artisan's Market]]:

{{book||content=
Hey there, traveler. Wanna see my latest wares?

{{gossip|Can you help me with some Crystal Ocular Lenses?}}

Those lenses ain't cheap, ya know. We're talkin' serious gold!

But if you'd help me with a certain... shall we say... delicate matter, I'd be willin' to cut 'em for you.

{{gossip|What "delicate matter" would that be?}}

So, I racked up a bit of a tab at the Dragon's Hoard. It's the secret waterin' hole of the Roasted Ram.

If I even tried to show my face to pay it off, [[Kritha]] would have my hide. I really wanna get back in for the next fight night!

Clear this mess up for me and I'll make you those Crystal Ocular Lenses.

I'm sure my tab ain't more than 200 gold or so... assumin' Kritha hasn't tacked on any interest!

{{gossip|I will consider settling your tab.}}<br>
{{gossip|I don't want to get involved. <Offer 1,000 gold instead.>}}
}}

Offering 1,000 gold pops a confirmation window:
:Are you sure you want to give Shakey 1000 gold to create Crystal Ocular Lenses?<br> {{cost|1000}}

[[File:Odd Statue.png|thumb|upright|[[Odd Statue]]]]
To save some money, get to the secret room by <code>/bow</code>ing before the [[Odd Statue]] in the [[Roasted Ram]] inn to get downstairs to the [[Dragon's Hoard]]. Speak with [[Kritha]] behind the bar:

{{book||content=
Welcome to my inn, weary traveler. What can I do for you?

{{gossip|I would like to talk to you about Shakey Flatlap.}}

Shakey?! You would do well to keep your distance from that goblin.

I warned him not to show his face around here with the tab he racked up!

{{gossip|I am here to settle the tab for him.}}

Really? Well, I am not sure how he put you up to this, but if you insist...

His tab is 346 gold, 43 silver, and 58 copper. Not a copper less!

{{gossip|Fine. I will pay the tab.}}
}}

This pops a confirmation window:
:<Confirm that you will pay for Shakey's tab.><br> {{cost|346|43|58}} <!--questcomplete 77230-->

[[File:Kritha.png|thumb|upright|[[Kritha]]]]
Kritha's gossip continues:
{{book|content=<Counts the money.> Good, it is all there. 

Tell Shakey he can come back, but has to pay up front from now on!}}

Return to Shakey:

{{book|content=
{{gossip|I settled your tab with Kritha. He says you have to pay up front from now on.}}

Well, a deal's a deal. Here's those lenses ya wanted. 

I can't wait to get back in for fight night!

{{gossip|<Take the lenses from Shakey.>}}
}}

This provides the [[Crystal Ocular Lenses]]. <!--quest unflagged 77230-->

===Unfinished Thinking Cap===
[[File:Fangli Hoot.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fangli Hoot]]]]
Combine the [[Thought Calculating Apparatus]], [[Downy Helmet Liner]], and [[Crystal Ocular Lenses]] to craft the [[Unfinished Thinking Cap]]. This starts the [[Unfinished Thinking Cap (quest)]] quest, so speak with [[Fangli Hoot]] at {{co|26.8|54.0|Valdrakken}} in the small room just west of the Barber Shop.

If the quest is not active, she says:
{{book|content=
Shh! We can't talk unless you're protected...

PUT ON YOUR THINKING CAP!
}}

Complete that quest to acquire the [[Tricked-Out Thinking Cap]], then learn and use the toy to pick up the [[The Tricked-Out Thinking Cap]] quest.
