==Notes==
;Speaking to Azley
:{{gossip|quest=|Tell me the rules of crafting for the [[Artisan's Consortium]].}}
::First, make sure you are a good representative of the Artisan's Consortium and be courteous to your customers!

::Second, in order to be fair to the other crafters of the consortium, you can only fill a number of public orders per day.

::But we want to be on top of customers' needs, so if an order is about to expire, we won't count that against your limit!

::{{gossip|I understand, I can fill some orders each day and any orders that are about to expire.}}
:::Well what are you standing around for? Go craft, craft, craft and be courteous, courteous, courteous!

:::Head to your crafting station and check for Crafting Orders!

:::{{gossip|I want to ask about something else.}}
::::{{gossip|Tell me the rules of crafting for the Artisan's Consortium again.}}
:::{{gossip|How does my crafting station have an updated list of everyone's crafting orders?}}
::::You let us worry about that, mm'kay?

::::The Artisan's Consortium has you covered!
