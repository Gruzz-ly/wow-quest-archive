==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Captain Drine|It could be nothing...}}
:{{Text|say|Captain Drine|But I doubt it.}}
:{{Text|say|Captain Drine|But we have had some trouble with [[Flightless|the rebels]] lately.}}

;Approaching Erima
:''A group of [[Curious Bystander]]s and [[Curious Onlooker]]s is gathered below, with a pair of [[Scalesworn Sergeant]]s guarding the scene and an [[Irritated Citizen]], [[Annoyed Citizen]] (gathering the [[Scattered Pages]] on the ground), and [[Tenith]] being in the central area. On the left side, a [[Panicked Physician]] is healing [[Sventian]], while [[Panicked Mender]]s are healing an [[Injured Bystander]] and [[Unconscious Worker]]. Others present include [[Aesthis]], [[Scalesworn Constable]]s, [[Shaken Witness]]es, [[Credible Witness]]es, [[Confused Witness]]es, [[Exasperated Witness]]es, and [[Startled Whelp]]s.''
:{{Text|say|Scalesworn Sergeant|Stand back, citizens!}}
:{{Text|say|Sventian|The coward cut me, then ran.}}
:{{Text|say|Investigator Erima|I cannot follow when you all speak at once!}}

;Speaking with Erima
:I cannot speak to everyone and search for clues. 

:The longer this takes, the more likely the culprit will get away.

:{{Gossip|Drine sent me. She said there was a commotion.}}
:{{Text|say|Investigator Erima|That is putting it mildly.}}
:{{Text|say|Investigator Erima|Someone brought a strange stone in here, then a fight broke out and they ran.}}
:{{Text|say|Investigator Erima|Find out what you can, starting with the stone.}}
:''Erima points to the [[Inert Runestone]].''

Interacting with the runestone prompts Aesthis to approach and pick it up:
:{{Text|say|Aesthis|Do not touch that!}}
:{{Text|say|Aesthis|You could kill us all!}}

Speak with Aesthis:
:Please, listen carefully to what I have to say.

:{{Gossip|What is that thing?}}
:{{Text|say|Aesthis|This is no mere rock.}}
:{{Text|say|Aesthis|This runestone reeks of [[Primalists|Primalist]] [[magic]].}}
:''Sventian approaches Aesthis.''
:{{Text|say|Sventian|I saw the rebel trying to activate it.}}
:{{Text|say|Aesthis|We stopped him, though it was difficult.}}
:{{Text|say|Sventian|He may have dropped something during the altercation.}}

Aesthis has a new gossip:
:I would not trust a Constable with this runestone.

:They are all thumbs.

Head to the Seat's entrance.
:{{Text|say|Tenith|What a waste of wine...}}
:{{Text|say|Annoyed Citizen|That oaf knocked the wind out of me.}}

Find and pick up the [[Dropped Page]].
:''Investigator Erima approaches.''
:{{Text|say|Investigator Erima|I'm convinced the rebels are behind this.}}
:{{Text|say|Investigator Erima|Which is no great surprise.}}
:{{Text|say|Investigator Erima|So... what do you have there?}}
