==Objectives==
Meet [[Nozdormu]] within [[Zaralek Cavern]].
* Speak to Nozdormu within Zaralek Cavern
* First memory recovered
* Second memory recovered
* Third memory recovered
* Last memory recovered

==Description==
[[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]] aided me in discovering the [[Oathbinder]]. This was the artifact used to control you all.

I have been scouring the timeline to discover how it was made to forge a counterpart to it to protect your kind.

This gem you've recovered is just the key I need to move my studies forward.

You and I shall next meet within Zaralek Cavern, where you once fought over the broken Oathbinder.

It is there we will find the secrets to forge your own weapon to fight against tyranny.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You hold the memories of how to forge the counter to the Oathbinder.

It is time for you to embark on this path.

==Notes==
Nozdormu has new gossip when meeting him at [[Nal ks'kol]]:
{{book|content= Thank you for meeting me here. With the gem you recovered, I can alter time to uncover the secrets of forging a new glove for you to aid your fellow dracthyr.

Are you ready?

{{gossip|I'm ready to see you alter time around us.}}

{{gossip|Why are you helping me forge a new glove? }}
}}

{{gossip|Why are you helping me forge a new glove? }}
{{book|content= Neltharion was like a brother to me. I am ashamed that there was so much he did that was hidden from my eyes.

Had I known about what he had done, how he had created and controlled you... I could have spared you all a great deal of pain.

As much as I wish, I cannot undo the sins of Neltharion and my own ignorance.

What I can do is aid you in forging a new path for you and your people, one where you have no fear of being controlled by anyone ever again.

{{gossip|I understand. I'm ready to see you rewind time.}}
}}

Once you are ready to continue Nozdormu creates a vision of the past:
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|I shall use the gem to pull fragments of the past forward. We shall see if we glean anything from this.}}
:{{text|say|Neltharion|You three shall be the examples all dracthyr will follow.}}
:{{text|say|Neltharion|Sarkareth, my devastator. You shall rend your foes with the powers of the red and blue dragonflights.}}
:{{text|say|Neltharion|Viridia, my preserver. You shall heal our allies with the grace of green and bronze dragonflights.}}
:{{text|say|Neltharion|And Emberthal, you will wield the essence of the black dragonflight to augment all those around you with my power.}}
:{{text|say|Neltharion|By my command... kneel and obey!}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Here! Neltharion is activating Oathbinder... this is our chance to pull the memories of this time to forge a new device.}}
The vision is frozen and you can recover the memories, starting with the first memory, Sarkareth:
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Sarkareth... it is a shame you could not see reason in the end.}}
:After recovering the second memory, Viridia:
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|I can see the inner workings of the Oathbinder. Neltharion should not have used it to blindly enslave the dracthyr.}}
:After recovering the third memory, Emberthal:
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Neltharion referred to Emberthal as using his very own essence... yet no dracthyr I have seen have been able to wield such power.}}
:After recovering the last memory, the Oathbinder:
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|And the Oathbinder itself... I believe we have everything we need to begin forging our own version of this artifact.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Come, let us return to Valdrakken. There is much that must be done.}}
After quest completion in Valdrakken:
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|I've studied the memories you recovered... it seems the original Oathbinder was meant to empower those who followed order.}}
