'''Reforging a Legend''' begins the ninth day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Objectives==
Seek out [[Weaponsmith Koref]] in the [[Obsidian Enclave]].

==Description==
There you are! Weaponsmith Koref was just looking for you. Left me with a note asking you to meet him in the Obsidian Conclave{{sic}}.

Sounds like you're helping him reforge an ancient titan key? Let me know how it goes! That's headline news if I ever heard it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Titan Key Materials List]]

==Completion==
We'll need rare materials for the key. Some special gold dust and flux. You'll find them both in the [[Waking Shores]].

After you find the materials, meet me at the [[Earth-Warder's Forge]] in the [[Obsidian Citadel]]. That's where I'll forge the Titan Key. And take my place amongst blacksmith legends, should my anvil strike true.

Here, this note that has all the details. We're so close, <class>!

[[Dusty Red Pellets]] of [[Rose Gold Dust]] are found around {{co|48.7|47.3|Waking Shores}} in the [[Overflowing Rapids]]. Equip the [[Idol of Ohn'ahra]] and walk around on foot. It will point in the direction of the dust piles, which are ''tiny''! Consider enabling the Interact Key option to help locate them!

Find [[Igneous Flux]] at various locations where lava meets seawater in the [[Waking Shores]], including {{co|37.9|43.6|Waking Shores}} at the [[Smoldering Perch]] and {{co|57.7|21.3|Waking Shores}} at the [[Life-Binder Conservatory]].

After acquiring at least 50 [[Rose Gold Dust]] and 8 [[Igneous Flux]], head to the lower level of the [[Obsidian Citadel]] and speak with [[Weaponsmith Koref]] at {{co|24.5|60.7|Waking Shores}} by the forge, where he starts [[A Key To Reforg(ing)]].
