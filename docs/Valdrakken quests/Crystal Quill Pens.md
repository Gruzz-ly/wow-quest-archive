==Objectives==
Gather 15 Crystal Quills from the [[crystalspine]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Gnoklin Quirkcoil]] of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]].
*[[Crystal Quill]] (15)

==Description==
There are unique creatures in these lands called crystalspines. They are cute little creatures protected by sharp crystal quills.

When I was treating one of our researchers for being stuck by one, I noticed that there was a lingering power resonating within. They might make for an excellent source of [[enchanting]] crystals.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Enchanter's Script]]

==Progress==
Have you found some crystal quills?

==Completion==
These are a perfect source of magically resonant crystal.
