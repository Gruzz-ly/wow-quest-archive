==Description==
Many of our inventions rely on using a sturdy and springy material. Fortunately, vorquin horns have served as the perfect product for many of our modern creations.

Even more fortunate for us, the Dragon Isles are swarmed with vorquin. It should be a simple task for you to gather some springy horns from the vorquin for us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Engineering Details]]

==Progress==
Did you collect the vorquin horns?

Our [[engineer]]s will be thrilled to have more materials. Thank you for your contributions.
