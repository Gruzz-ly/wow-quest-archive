==Objectives==
Buy Temporal Parmesan from [[Gorgonzormu]] in [[Valdrakken]] for the Bronze Hatchling.
*[[Temporal Parmesan]]
*[[Bronze Hatchling]] fed

==Description==
I have been learning much about [[bronze dragon]]s since arriving in Valdrakken. While they take their charge of [[time]] seriously, they have found many hobbies for their free time that their [[magic]] can aid them with.

My friend Gorgonzormu swears by his cheeses for all stages of [[dragon]] life. He mentioned that he has a type of parmesan that is excellent for [[bronze whelp]]s. It seems that our hatchling's first meal is figured out!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Cheese is best when aged over time, but bronze dragons have perfected rapid aging with their control of time!

==Completion==
Not only can bronze dragons age cheese quickly, but they can also digest it more rapidly!

==Notes==
;Cheese bought
:{{Text|say|Gorgonzormu|Now, this cheese is perfect for a growing bronze whelp. They will eat it precisely when they need it, and not a moment before or after!}}

;Speaking with the Bronze Hatchling
