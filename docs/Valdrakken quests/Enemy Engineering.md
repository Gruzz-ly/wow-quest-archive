==Objectives==
Gather 10 Primal Rituals from the [[Primalists]] of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Gnoklin Quirkcoil]] of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]].
*[[Primal Ritual]] (10)

==Description==
It may be a bit controversial, but I believe that we can study the rituals of the Primalists to learn new ways to channel [[elemental]] power. I'm confident that once we understand the pathways of their [[magic]], we can use it to create all sorts of innovative [[engineering]] products.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Engineering Details]]

==Progress==
Did you find some Primal Rituals?

==Completion==
I've been told that the Primalists reject civilization and seek to bring about its downfall. Ha! The joke is on them. Their rituals will inspire dozens of new gizmos that will bring about the next [[Technology|technological]] golden age.
