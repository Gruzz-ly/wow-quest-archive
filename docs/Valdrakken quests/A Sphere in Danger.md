'''A Sphere in Danger''' begins the penultimate day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Completion==
Here's the note they sent. Something to do with an orb? 

[[Preservationist Kathos|Kathos]] had to run out to check on something, so you can bring the orb back to me. I'll make sure to hand it over upon her return.

Stay safe out there. Oh, and don't forget all of your useful tools!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Preservationist's Dispatch Three]]

==Notes==
The notes read:
{{:Preservationist's Dispatch Three}}

Each cave on [[Stormshroud Peak]] west of the [[Temporal Conflux]] contains a [[Titan-Inscribed Tablet]]. Walk around with the [[Torch of Pyrreth]] out and it will channel at a tablet. It may take a few times walking back and forth for it to properly trigger.

The tablets ''must'' be found with the torch before the buried objects will appear. Don't skip ahead!

At {{co|50.2|81.0|Thaldraszus}} in the south cave, equip the [[Torch of Pyrreth]] and interact with the tablet in the back of the cave. It reads:
{{book|content=<The Torch of Pyrreth burned away a magical shroud unveiling a tablet with glowing titan coordinates. (-7, 9).>}}

Reset the cap and navigate to (-7, 9) or {{co|49.5|79.7|Thaldraszus}} to find a [[Buried Object]] nestled against a tree. It contains a [[Piece of the Orb of Rathmus]].<!--209795-->

At {{co|46.6|77.6|Thaldraszus}} in the back of the northeast cave is the second tablet. 
{{book|content=<The Torch of Pyrreth burned away a magical shroud unveiling a tablet with glowing titan coordinates. (-7, -14).>}}

Reset the cap and navigate to (-7, -14) or {{co|45.9|79.7|Thaldraszus}} near the edge of the cliff to spot another Buried Object hidden in the leaves with another [[Piece of the Orb of Rathmus]].<!--209797-->

At {{co|48.7|76.4|Thaldraszus}} in the middle of the big cave by the water is the third tablet.

{{book|content=<The Torch of Pyrreth burned away a magical shroud unveiling a tablet with glowing titan coordinates. (15, -11).>}}

Reset the cap and head to (15, -11) or {{co|50.2|78.0|Thaldraszus}} to find another Buried Object by a rock outcrop. It contains another [[Piece of the Orb of Rathmus]].<!--209799-->

Combine all three parts to create the [[Orb of Rathmus]], which starts [[A Curious Orb]].
