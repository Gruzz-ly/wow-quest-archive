*[[Soothing Incense (quest item)]]
*Habitat pieces placed (3)

==Description==
The [[whelp]]s like to spend time with Sir Pringly, but their treading over the space has worn down his habitat.

Would you retrieve another shrubbery for him? And while you are out, he could use an adorable new toy. And incense.

We cannot let his space fall into disrepair, of course.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
* 5x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Beyond the particular shade of green, Sir Pringly only cares that a natural material adorn his space.

==Completion==
The habitat is looking wonderful, <name>.

This should last Sir Pringly for a while until the whelps wear it out again.
