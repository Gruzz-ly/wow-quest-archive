==Objectives==
Find [[Waywatcher Alvi]].

==Description==
;Waywatcher Nori
The [[Waywatchers]] have kept the roads of [[Thaldraszus]] safe for travelers for as long as I can remember. It is a duty that my family has upheld with honor for generations.

Alas, my sister Alvi seems less than interested in that honor of late. She is supposed to report to me here each morning, but I have not heard from her in over a day.

If you find a [[bronze drakonid]] east of here, lazing about with her head in the clouds, I ask that you direct her to me. Otherwise, I will have to seek her out myself.

;Waywatcher Lorin
It seems some of our younger Waywatchers have grown lax in their duties of late.

[[Waywatcher Nori]] has asked me to check in on her younger sister Alvi, who is stationed at the mouth of the [[Passage of Time]]. Apparently her recent performance has been less than satisfactory.

If you head east and happen to encounter Waywatcher Alvi, please remind her of the importance of her position, and let her know that her sister is rather worried about her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,050 [[XP]]
*+4 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
Oh, gracious, a traveler. Please forgive me, I am a bit of a mess at the moment.
