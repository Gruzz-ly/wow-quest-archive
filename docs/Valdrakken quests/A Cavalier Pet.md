==Objectives==
Obtain a Baby Vorquin battle pet for [[Belastrasza]].
*[[Lysindra]] visited
*[[Princess Vorquistrasza|Baby Vorquin]] retrieved
*Baby Vorquin given to [[Lasztak]]

==Description==
I believe that the only way we can teach Belastrasza to be less self-obsessed is to show her firsthand how it makes others feel.

[[Vorquin]] are beautiful creatures, but they are incredibly high maintenance companions who need a lot of care.

Lysindra in [[Valdrakken]] has a baby vorquin for Bela. Perhaps she will learn through getting a taste of her own medicine.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Princess Vorquistrasza|id=416679|Learn how to summon [[Princess Vorquistrasza (pet)|Princess Vorquistrasza]].|icon=inv_kirinbaby_pale}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
A stubborn pet for a stubborn whelp.

==Completion==
This pet should teach Bela to be less stubborn... or just make twice the work for poor Lasztak. Well, one of them will learn from this.

==Notes==
;Entering Lysindra's shop
:{{Text|say|Lysindra|Good to see you again, <name>. We have just what you are looking for. She is right...}}
:{{Text|say|Lysindra|She wanders off if we don't give her constant attention. If you can catch her, she is yours. For free.}}

Head to the Ruby Enclave and find the vorquin at {{Co|59.1|22.6|Valdrakken}}. Head back to Lasztak.
:It ran off, you say? Thank you for chasing it down.
:{{Gossip|quest=|Here is the baby vorquin for Bela.}}
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|Thank you <name>. Belastrasza, this is...}}
:{{Text|say|Belastrasza|This one is more beautiful than anyone else's. I will name her Princess Vorquistrasza!}}
:{{Text|say|Belastrasza|Princess, come here and we can play. Come here. Come. Here. Over here. I said come.}}
:''[[Princess Vorquistrasza]] and Belastrasza run away.''
