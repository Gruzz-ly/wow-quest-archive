==Completion==
The study of [[Tyrhold]] and all [[titan]] artifacts in the [[Dragon Isles]] is critical to our efforts in fighting against the [[Primalists]].

The weapons they left behind are especially important. I have recently discovered a great cache of them, and would like to award one to you in recognition of your efforts.

After I catalog my findings, I would be willing to offer others in trade. But I ask that you bring me materials to further my research.
