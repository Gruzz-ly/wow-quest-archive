==Objectives==
Collect the Blue Dragon Egg at the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]] then hatch it at the [[Azure Oathstone]].
*Blue Egg collected
*Egg hatched at Azure Oathstone

==Description==
An egg from the [[blue dragonflight]] is ready to hatch.

Report to [[Akxall|Axkall]]{{sic}} in the Ruby Lifeshrine to pick up the egg. Then, I request that you bring the egg to the Azure Oathstone to hatch in a location strong with our flight's power.

Once this is complete, return here with the hatchling, where we will further take care of it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Have you brought the newest hatchling?

==Completion==
It is nice to care for a hatchling from my own flight. He reminds me of my days in [[Azsuna]].

==Notes==
;Speaking with Akxall
:{{Gossip|quest=|I am here to bring the egg to Valdrakken.}}
:{{Text|say|Akxall|[[Blue whelp]]s are full of [[magic]] and mischief. The best way to keep them still is to give them a good book.}}

Approach the Azure Oathstone at the [[Azure Archives]] and use the Hatch Egg extra action button, after which a short cutscene plays out, as the hatchling hatches and sees the adventurer for the first time, albeit somewhat blurry.
