==Objectives==
Collect 10 Essence of Endless Flame in the [[Emerald Dream (zone)|Emerald Dream]].
*Complete the events of "Enter the Dream"
*[[Essence of Endless Flame]] (10)

==Description==
Everyone knows heat plays a critical role in blacksmithing.

I hear the Emerald Dream is still heavily under attack by [[Druids of the Flame|allies of the flame]]. There must be a way to harvest fuel from those eternally fiery creatures.

If you do secure anything, I'm sure one of the local blacksmiths in the Dream will be very interested.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Blacksmith's Writ]]

==Progress==
Hmm. Yes?

==Completion==
You've faced dangerous enemies to acquire these materials. Thank you. This will prove mightily useful for crafting our own devices.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.2.0|note=Added.}}
