==Objectives==
Seek out [[Gryrmpech]] in the [[Gardens of Unity]].

==Description==
Greetings mortal, I have word from our Head Gardener Gryrmpech. The word is that the gardens are in a state of chaos, but I don't know if that is abnormal.

They assured me that they have it in hand, actually 'in shovel' is actually the phrase they used, I am not sure what they are meaning I am sure they will fill you in. Please, seek them out and they will outfit you appropriately for the situation.

==Rewards==

==Completion==
A garden keeper needs their own weapons. Let me outfit you for battle. 

I have more tools of war if you need. I appreciate your help taming these wilds!
