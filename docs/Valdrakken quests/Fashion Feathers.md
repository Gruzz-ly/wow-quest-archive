==Objectives==
Collect 10 Shed Great Feathers in the [[Emerald Dream (zone)|Emerald Dream]].
*Complete the events of "Enter the Dream"
*[[Shed Great Feathers]] (10)

==Description==
Much of the Dream's wildlife is feathered or furred. Their shed, whether it be down fur or feathers, is reputed to be extremely durable, soft, and fashionable.

The great somnowls' feathers are particularly desirable. They don't shed often, and feathers are quickly retrieved by local wildlife for nest building.

I've heard that your best chance is scouring the [[Meandering Rootlands]] in the Dream.

==Rewards==

Have you found any feathers? They're easy to identify. As large as two hands lengthwise, often snowy in color, and buttery soft.

==Completion==
