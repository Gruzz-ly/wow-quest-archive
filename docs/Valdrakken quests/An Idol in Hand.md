'''An Idol in Hand''' continues the sixth day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Objectives==
Return the Idol of Ohn'ahra to [[Preservationist Kathos]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Idol of Ohn'ahra (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<The idol appears to be a figure of [[Ohn'ahra]] carved from [[Serevite Ore|serevite]], an [[ore]] used in many [[titan]] temples.

Preservationist Kathos would surely be interested in this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Idol of Ohn'ahra]]

==Progress==
What have you found?

==Completion==
You found the Idol of Ohn'ahra! I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.

We need to get artifacts like this back to their rightful places. But if my superiors are right, we can't risk letting them fall into the wrong hands. 

Let me examine the idol.

==Notes==
Completing this quest is the "Idol of Ohn'ahra" criterion of [[Tools of the Trade (achievement)]].
