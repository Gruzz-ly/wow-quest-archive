*Collect Storm Spirits from creatures of the Dragon Isles (500)

==Description==
Aye, [[Stormrook (Valdrakken)|the stormrook]] is beginning to take a liking to us. But the bond between [[rider]] and [[gryphon]] is forged over many trials.

Ye may have the spirit of the storm, but let's show how ye mastered it. Time to really prove yer mettle in battle.

*2,300 XP

==Progress==
I think I'm starting tae get this one to trust me.

==Completion==
Well, would you look at that! Ye truly have learned to master the storm within ye. A splendid gryphon rider if I ever did see one.

And that's not all. I see the armor I gave ye is bristling with the heart of the storm now! Interesting...

==Notes==
Kill at least level {{level|df-max}} enemies on the [[Dragon Isles]] or [[Khaz Algar]]. They may drop from 0-3 [[Storm Spirit]].
