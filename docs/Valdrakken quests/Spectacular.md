==Objectives==
Craft 2 Sundered Onyx Loupes for [[Tuluradormi]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Sundered Onyx Loupe]] (2)

==Description==
Jewelcrafter, there is an exhibition coming up, and I am concerned that the clients will not be able to see the beauty of each cut without the proper lenses.

You do not need anything fancy. Just make a few loupes so our customers can see clearly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Jeweler's Cuts
}}

==Progress==
Do you have the loupes?

==Completion==
Your work is appreciated... By someone, I would imagine. Probably.

Here, I made these cuts. You can study them to learn how to be a better jewelcrafter like me.

==Patch changes==
