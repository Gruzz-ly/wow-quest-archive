==Description==
My scribe apprentice, you could not have chosen better timing.

There has been a terrible accident! All of the Illusion Parchment I ordered turned out to be real! Can you believe it! Do they think this is some game? Someone might get hurt!

Do you think you could rectify this situation and create some real illusions?

==Rewards==

==Completion==
Thank you a thousand times, my scribe apprentice.

Please take these glyphs as a token of my thanks. Perhaps you can study them to further your practices.
