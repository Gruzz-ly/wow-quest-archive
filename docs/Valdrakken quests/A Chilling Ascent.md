'''A Chilling Ascent''' begins the fifth day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Completion==
There's a [[Clerk Nemora|clerk]] at General Supplies who's been one of my sources for juicy rumors.

They told me about an expedition to [[Vakthros]] in the [[Azure Span]]. Sounds like someone was looking for [[Torch of Pyrreth|that torch]] you found.

The clerk saw their map and wrote down some coordinates. Hopefully they'll get you close.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[The Clerk's Notes]]

==Notes==

The notes read:

{{:The Clerk's Notes}}

Either take the [[Ancient Waygate]] to [[Vakthros]] in the [[Azure Span]] or fly to {{co|77.6|30.8|Azure Span}} atop the highest tower. Then head southeast down to ground level to the big door at {{co|77.9|32.2|Azure Span}} where the climax of the [[Azure Span storyline]] played out and re-equip the [[Tricked-Out Thinking Cap]] to reset to (0, 0).

[[File:Unveiled Tablet.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Unveiled Tablet]]]]
Fly southeast to (11, -2) or {{co|78.8|32.5|Azure Span}} and equip the [[Torch of Pyrreth]]. There, the player will channel into the pillar:
:{{text|emote|A tablet is unveiled at the base of the pillar.}}
The drakonid [[Amerinth]] is freed from the ice and walks over to the tablet. Nearby, two [[Expedition Laborer]]s, an [[Expedition Conjuror]] and an [[Expedition Mender]] are found dead.
:{{text|emote|<The dragonkin peers over your shoulder to look at the text.>}}
:{{text|say|Amerinth|Well, I think my days of field research are over. Time to return to town and find a warm bath.<br><br>Thank you again for freeing me. Best of luck with your quest!}}

Interact with the [[Unveiled Tablet]]:
{{book|Unveiled Tablet|content=
<Etched letters grace the tablet in a language you cannot understand.>

{{gossip|<Use paper and charcoal to make an etching.>}}
}}

Players create the [[Unveiled Tablet Rubbing]] which starts [[A Knowledgeable Descent]]. Take the rubbing back to [[Bobby Carlisle]] at the [[Roasted Ram]] inn in [[Valdrakken]].
