==Objectives==
Bring Zalethgos to the [[Victorious Visage]] in [[Valdrakken]] to find a suitable pair of glasses.
*Speak to [[Varastrasza]] with [[Zalethgos]]
*Glasses tried on (3)
*Perfect glasses found
*[[Zalethgos's Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
Zalethgos is a bright child, but as he has gotten older we have realized something very clear about him.

He has terrible eyesight!

He is constantly speaking of things being fuzzy and of not being able to tell where one thing ends and the next begins.

There is a salon just across the bridge in Valdrakken. Please, accompany Zalethgos to try to find him the perfect pair of glasses to aid his vision.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
I look forward to Zalethgos learning that sharp edges exist!

==Completion==
Zaleth seems absolutely thrilled with his new spectacles! He will surely flourish now.

==Notes==
Summon Zalethgos with the whistle and speak with Varastrasza:
:{{Gossip|quest=|My whelp here is looking for some glasses.}}
:{{Text|say|Varastrasza|Oh, the little darling! Yes, come with me. We have a small selection of spectacles for you to peruse.}}
:''Varastrasza approaches a table with [[:Dark Blue Shades]], [[:Rhinestone Sunglasses]], and [[:Dazzling Spectacles]].''
:{{Text|say|Zalethgos|Ooh, I get CHOICES? Neat!}}
:{{Text|say|Varastrasza|Please, try on whichever glasses you wish. I am certain we will find the perfect pair.}}

;Dark Blue Shades
:{{Text|say|Varastrasza|Ah, I believe those will look quite lovely on you.}}
:{{Text|say|Zalethgos|Let me try!}}
:{{Text|say|Zalethgos|Whoa... why is everything so faded? I can't see any colors!}}
:{{Text|say|Varastrasza|Hmm, clearly those will not suffice. Let us try another pair.}}

;Rhinestone Sunglasses
:{{Text|say|Varastrasza|Now these are some of my favorites. I have a pair at home!}}
:{{Text|say|Zalethgos|Gimme, gimme, gimme!}}
:{{Text|say|Zalethgos|Hey, pink is my favorite color! Things still don't look quite right, though.}}
:{{Text|say|Varastrasza|Ah, perhaps another pair then.}}

;Dazzling Spectacles
:{{Text|say|Varastrasza|This pair is understated, but quite stylish still.}}
:{{Text|say|Zalethgos|Will they make me only see half good?}}
:{{Text|say|Zalethgos|So... blurry...}}
:{{Text|say|Varastrasza|These simply will not do.}}
:{{Text|say|Varastrasza|Well, I am quite at a loss. These are the only glasses we have.}}
:''[[Theladre]] approaches.''
:{{Text|say|Theladre|Wait! I have one more to try!}}
:{{Text|say|Zalethgos|These... are...}}
:{{Text|say|Zalethgos|PERFECT! Is this what seeing is?}}
:{{Text|say|Varastrasza|Well done, Theladre! Another happy [[dragon]] in the city.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|We have done all we can for today <name>. Come back tomorrow if you can. I am certain we will have need of you.}}
