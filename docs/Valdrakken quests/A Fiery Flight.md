Gather 15 Rousing Fire for [[Sekita the Burrower]] in [[Valdrakken]].

* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Mining Field Notes]]

==Progress==
The forge is nearly out! Do you have them?

Take my field notes when you go. There must be something in there that will teach you about [[mining]].
