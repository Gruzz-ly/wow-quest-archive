==Objectives==
Craft 10 Refreshing Healing Potions for [[Conflago]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Refreshing Healing Potion]] (10)

==Description==
Oh <name>, I am glad to see you. Several [[Champion (rank)|champions]] have been injured in the latest assault against the [[Primalists]]. We are greatly in need of healing potions. As an [[adventurer]] yourself, I imagine you have several on hand already. We will need many.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Alchemy Notes
}}

==Progress==
Every moment you waste, the Primalists grow stronger.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. This will revitalize the health of our injured champions and keep the Primalists at bay for another week.

Here, study this. Even as a skilled alchemist, there is more for you to learn.

==Notes==
The potions have to be gold quality.
