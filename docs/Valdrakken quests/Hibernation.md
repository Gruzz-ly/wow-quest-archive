==Objectives==
Help [[Posidriss]] defeat the [[Treanthony|Nightmare critter]].
*Visit [[Wurallie]] in the [[Waking Shores]]
*Defeat Wurallie in a [[Pet Battle]] with [[Somnius (pet)|Somnius]] on your team

==Description==
Posidriss's companion has been helping them with their severe insomnia, but I worry that they are still falling behind other whelps in their connection to [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]].

Perhaps we can aid them through a pet battle! [[Green dragon]]s often protect the Dream from the [[Emerald Nightmare|Nightmare]], and Wurallie has found the perfect critter for them to practice this on.

It is mostly harmless.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

{{itembox||Posidriss (pet)
|q2=10|Flightstones
}}

==Completion==
Posidriss was certainly enthusiastic about facing the enemies of the Emerald Dream. I think they learned a lesson as well.

Posidriss will want to join you on some of your future adventures, though you may have to keep them from rushing after the big threats.

;Wurallie's new gossip
:I thought Posidriss was going to have a much harder time with the nightmare, but Somnius appears to have been just what they needed.

:<Wurallie smiles>
