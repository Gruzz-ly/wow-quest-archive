==Objectives==
Gather 20 Fuzzy Legs from the [[tarantula]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Gnoklin Quirkcoil]] of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]].
*[[Fuzzy Legs (item)]] (20)

==Description==
We have received a request for "Fuzzy Legs" for tailoring...

Don't look at me, I don't make the requests, I just pass them on. I imagine the legs of tarantulas would fulfill this request.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Tailoring Examples]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered the Fuzzy Legs?

==Completion==
I can't imagine what these will be used for, and I don't really want to think about it, but thank you regardless.
