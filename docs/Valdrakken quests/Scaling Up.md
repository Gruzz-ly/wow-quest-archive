==Objectives==
Gather 40 Adamant Scales for [[Ralathor the Rugged]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Adamant Scales]] (40)

==Description==
Many people ask me how I became so good at [[skinning]]. To them I say: it is all in the scales.

Are you curious to learn more? Bring me some scales, and I will show you what I mean.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Skinning Field Notes]]
*+500 reputation with [[Artisan's Consortium - Dragon Isles Branch]]

==Progress==
Have you found any worthy scales?

==Completion==
Excellent--with all that practice, now you have become better at skinning! You see? All in the scales.

Here, have my field notes. They will teach you about the beasts of this land and how to better procure their hides.

==Notes==
The Adamant Scales have to be silver quality.
