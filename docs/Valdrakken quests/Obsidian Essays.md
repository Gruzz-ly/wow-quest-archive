==Objectives==
Collect 10 Obsidian Tablets.
*[[Obsidian Tablet]] (10)

==Description==
It's not common these days, but we do have a few of our histories in writing--well, carvings really. We can trace the etchings with our fingers!

We used to use clay tablets for this, but they were brittle, and prone to breaking. Not good if you want to preserve history!

I hear the [[djaradin]] carve their important texts into volcanic glass. If they can manage that without shattering the tablets, we could probably learn a thing or two from their techniques!

Take some samples back to [[Loamm]] for study.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

==Progress==
New knowledge can come from the strangest sources!

==Completion==
Very interesting... they might look like brutes, but this carving requires a light and careful hand. Not to mention enormous amounts of patience.

With any luck, we'll both make something as fine as these one day, eh?
