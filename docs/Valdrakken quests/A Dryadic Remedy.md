==Objectives==
Acquire a Tasty Hatchling's Treat and administer it to the Despondent Duckling.
*Find or Cook a [[:Tasty Hatchling's Treat]]
*[[Despondent Duckling]] Treated

==Description==
While you were gone, I heard from a [[Shaggy Dreamhare|dreamhare]] that one of the local [[duck]]lings is feeling rather down in the dumps. Luckily, I know exactly how to fix that!

Whenever I'm feeling moody, I snack on something sweet and tasty! As an expert in cute, lovable creatures, I know that the same principle will surely apply here.

This particular duckling is fond of a local dessert known as a Tasty Hatchling's Treat. Won't you find one and bring it to the poor dear? It's the dryadic thing to do, after all!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62}}
* 8,200 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Well, friend? How fares our ailing avian ally?

==Completion==
Oh, thank you, <name>! We [[dryad]]s are stretched so thin that it can be hard to see to every little [[bird]] or [[beast]] that roams these streets.

With your help, though, everything turned out splendidly! You make quite the useful dryad in a pinch! In fact, I may ask for your aid again some other time. There are always more adorable little creatures to attend to, after all!

==Notes==
Head to the [[Little Scales Daycare]] and find the [[Barrel of Confiscated Treats]] behind the bookshelf at {{co|9.56|56.24|Valdrakken}} and loot [[Recipe: Tasty Hatchling's Treat]] and [[Tasty Hatchling's Treat]].
