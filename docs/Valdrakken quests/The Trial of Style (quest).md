==Objectives==
Speak to a Transmogrifier to enter and complete the [[Trial of Style]].
*Speak to a Transmogrifier
*Complete the Trial of Style

==Description==
;Don'a
Well, that's certainly an... interesting look, <class>.

Me? Judgmental? Certainly not. However, I'm curious what others would think of it.

You should speak to the Transmogrifier over there and enter the Trial of Style.

We'll see what public opinion says about your choice in garb.

;Perfecto & Primo
You certainly look... unique, <class>.

But I suppose my opinion doesn't matter when it comes to the Trial of Style.

Go, see what others think of your appearance. Speak to the Transmogrifier nearby and enter the Trial of Style.

See if you can convince the rabble to vote for you.

Although in the end, you all pale compared to my grace, beauty and sense of fashion.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||5}}
* 100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
;Don'a
Did you complete the Trial of Style yet, dear?

;Perfecto & Primo
Ugh, I'm so bored.

Did you complete the Trial of Style yet?

==Completion==
;Perfecto & Primo
That's mildly impressive.

Mildly.

Off with you now. I'm tired of looking at you.

;Don'a
How quaint. You finished the Trial of Style.

I'm impressed. It's inspiring to see someone do so much with so little.

Go on now. You're stealing my spotlight.
