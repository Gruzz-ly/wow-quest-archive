==Objectives==
Collect 10 Hololithic Gears.
*[[Hololithic Gear]] (10)

==Description==
The [[Titan watcher|watchers]] left all sorts of amazing technology just laying around when they went to sleep.

We could learn so much from their ancient castoffs. Even the least of contraptions are marvels to behold!

If only there was someone brave, intelligent, and dare I say handsome enough to go retrieve a few examples for our finest [[niffen]]eers back in [[Loamm]] to examine... sound familiar?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Engineering Details
}}

==Progress==
I wonder if we'll ever truly understand their technology?

==Completion==
What's a hololithic gear, you ask? I don't know, but I look forward to finding out!

==Patch changes==
