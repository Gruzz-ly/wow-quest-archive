==Description==
To use this game machine, you need a Rumble Coin.

There are a bunch of coins hidden all around the Dragon Isles. We'll chat about those later.

I stashed one coin here <in the Roasted Ram/at the docks/in the inn>. If you find it, it's all yours, pal.

Insert that Rumble Coin into the Rumble machine and watch the fun begin!

<As you insert your coin, the fun little machine rumbles and jingles.

You got a prize!>

==Notes==
Find a [[Rumble Coin Bag]] to loot a [[Rumble Coin]].

;Speaking to Mizzen
:You got this! Go find that coin!

;After obtaining a coin
:Nice, you got one! Now insert it in the machine!

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Mizzen|Wow, cool prize! Ask me about other places you can look for Rumble Coins... and let me tell you about foils!}}
