==Objectives==
Gather 15 Rousing Earth for [[Sekita the Burrower]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Rousing Earth]] (15)

==Description==
I have an order for several hundred tons of [[:Primal Molten Alloy]], but I have run out of Rousing Earth. I know it's a heavy ask, but I can make it worth your while!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Mining Field Notes]]

==Progress==
My clients are breathing down my neck. Do you have them?

==Completion==
Perfect. Just what I needed.

Take these old field notes. There must be something in there that will teach you about [[mining]].
