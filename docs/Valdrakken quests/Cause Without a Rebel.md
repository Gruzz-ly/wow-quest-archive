'''Cause Without a Rebel''' starts the Rebel Dragonkin questline. It requires having completed the Misty Vale side questline of the [[Thaldraszus storyline]].

==Objectives==
Listen to [[Alexstrasza]]'s conversation with [[Maldra Flametongue]].
*Teleport to Bottom Floor taken (Optional)
*Join Maldra and Alexstrasza
*Hear the Discussion

==Description==
Good to see you again, <name>! Alexstrasza doesn't think we can stop [[Flightless|the rebels]] effectively through force, despite the successes you've had.

To find other ways forward, Alexstrasza has called Maldra Flametongue here to talk about the rebellion and what drew her to it.

Perhaps it would be helpful to join the conversation, and see what Maldra has to say. To avoid prying rebel eyes and ears, they will be meeting below us, on the second level of the [[Seat of the Aspects]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*25,700 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
I've found the rebels are stockpiling a huge number of bombs beneath the Valdrakken aqueduct! We must stop them!

==Notes==
Take the teleporter and find Alexstrasza and Maldra on the second floor.
:{{Text|say|Maldra Flametongue|... so when I saw we were hurting other [[dragonkin]], I knew I was on the wrong side.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|But what drew you to their cause? You do not seem dishonorable.}}
:{{Text|say|Maldra Flametongue|No, it was honor that drew me to the cause. The treatment of dragonkin seemed... dishonorable.}}
:{{Text|say|Maldra Flametongue|We cared for this land for centuries without the [[dragon]]s, but were reduced to mere servants when you returned.}}
:{{Text|say|Maldra Flametongue|So I joined the rebels because we had been pushed aside, expected to serve as though the dragons had never left.}}
:''[[Investigator Erima]] suddenly runs up to the pair.''
:{{Text|say|Investigator Erima|Apologies, my queen! An urgent matter requires I interrupt.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Investigator Erima? What do you have to report?}}
:{{Text|say|Investigator Erima|The rebels are stockpiling [[explosive]]s beneath [[Valdrakken|the city]] to collapse the aqueduct!}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Explosives! In my home? You must stop them before they do something unforgivable.}}

Maldra also has gossip and dialogue option, but it does nothing:
:Thank you for joining us, <name>. We are discussing why I originally joined the rebellion.

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Tell Maldra that you're here to stop the rebels.>}}
