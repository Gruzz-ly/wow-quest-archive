==Objectives==
Gather 10 Fireproof Gear from the [[djaradin]] of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Temnaayu]] of the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]].
*[[Fireproof Gear (item)]] (10)

==Description==
The armor of the djaradin can withstand even the fiercest flames. Such qualities would be of great use in combating them!

See what you can gather from the djaradin. We can study it, and apply the same enchantments to our own armor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Were you able to gather any armor?

==Completion==
These are perfect samples for studying! We should be able to shore up our own armor quite nicely.

You have our thanks for your aid, friend.
