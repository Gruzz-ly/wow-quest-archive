==Objectives==
Meet [[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris]] at [[Lunedane]] in the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].

==Description==
No doubt you have seen the destruction that [[Fyrakk]] continues to leave in his wake.

While others fight him directly, my troops and I have been serving as the eyes and ears of the [[green dragonflight]]. Although Fyrakk's actions may seem erratic, there are trends to his strategies.

We learned that he is to have a secret meeting with [[Vyranoth]] soon in Lunedane. This is a deviation from his recent tactics, and we need to know why.

Given the danger, we would value your aid. Meet me in Lunedane.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
Keep to the shadows, <name>.

Lunedane is already crawling with Fyrakk's forces.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I will meet you in Lunedane. Come swiftly and silently.}}
:''Shandris walks a few yards away from the wall, summons her mount, and flies off.''

Head to the southwestern corner of the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]] to reach [[Lunedane]]. There, the [[Primalist]] allies of [[Fyrakk]] have taken over.

Shandris, on a small platform, has new gossip:

{{book|content=
They are gathering reinforcements quickly. We will need to complete our mission before our escape routes are blocked.

==Progression==
{{The Coalition of Flames}}
