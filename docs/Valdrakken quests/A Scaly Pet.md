==Objectives==
Obtain a Baby Hornswog [[battle pet]] for [[Zhusadormu]].
*[[Lysindra]] visited
*[[Bronze Skitterfly|Bronze Skitterflies]] captured (3)
*Return to Lysindra
*[[Baby Hornswog]] caught
*Baby Hornswog given to [[Lasztak]]

==Description==
We have been trying to decide on the perfect pet for Zhusadormu. His allergies limit our options by quite a bit, but I believe I have thought of a pet for him.

I know for a fact that Zhusa is not allergic to scales. A baby [[hornswog]] is hypoallergenic and I believe Lysindra could acquire one for us.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Annuna|id=414181|Learn how to summon [[Annuna (pet)|Annuna]].|icon=inv_babyhornswog_orange}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
The whelps love hornswogs. They will love having one in the daycare!

==Completion==
A bronze hornswog for a [[bronze whelp]]. A perfect fit!

==Notes==
;Arriving at Lysindra's shop
:{{Text|say|Lysindra|I see you have returned, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Lysindra|The hornswog is a bit ornery. If you catch three bronze skitterflies, we can coax it out for you.}}

Find and capture three [[Bronze Skitterfly|Bronze Skitterflies]] in central and southern Valdrakken, then return to Lysindra.
:{{Text|say|Lysindra|It worked! Quick, <name>. Grab it before it gets away!}}

Catch the [[Baby Hornswog]] and return to Lasztak.
:I must admit, skitterflies are not my favorite insects. Thank you for going to all that trouble.
:{{Gossip|quest=|Here is Zhusa's baby hornswog.}}
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|Zhusa, we have a surprise for you.}}
:{{Text|say|Zhusadormu|A bronze hornswog who doesn't make me sneeze. His name is [[Annuna]].}}
:{{Text|emote|<Agapanthus sighs.>}}
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|Surprising this one is a challenge.}}
:{{Text|emote|<Zhusadormu sniffs Annuna cautiously.>}}
:{{Text|say|Zhusadormu|And later he will win a fight against a mean plant that makes me sneeze, but I will not disappear because you teach me to hold onto our time.}}
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|We will put the hornswog by his nest.}}
