==Objectives==
Deliver barrels to the [[Artisan's Market]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*Ride a [[Brew Barrel (Valdrakken)|Brew Barrel]] (0/100%)
*Deliver Brew

==Description==
If it's ale ye be looking for, we've plenty to sample! Or at least we would if the [[Valdrakken]] folk would hurry up and bring the rest of the barrels down here.

We've shipped our [[Brewfest]] brews here so they can celebrate--and wouldn't ye know it, they've already started their own traditions! Rolling barrels through the city? That's no way to treat a good brew!

Mind lending a hand to bring those barrels down here? And try not to break 'em!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||20}}
*1,400 [[XP]]
*10x [[Brewfest Prize Token]]

==Progress==
Careful with the barrels! Ye shouldn't jostle a good ale.

==Completion==
Glad to see that delivery in one piece!

==Notes==
Head to the [[Ruby Enclave]] or the [[Bronze Enclave]] and hop on the Brew Barrel. Roll down back to Bragdur. On the way, collect green bubbles for Speed Boost that stacks and watch out for [[Damaged Barrel]]s and [[Rogue Barrel]]s, warned by:
:{{Text|say|[[Brewfest Celebrant]]|Look out!}}

Avoid water as it dismounts. Taking a hit on the barrels loses a percentage of the Brew Delivered bar. If the brew is delivered with 100% bar, the quest is also completed with 100% as well.
