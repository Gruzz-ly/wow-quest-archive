'''Fueling the Engine''' ends the first portion of the  "The Spark of Ingenuity" questline, used to unlock the [[Engine of Innovation]], allowing players to turn [[Bottled Essence]] into a [[Spark of Ingenuity]], a high-value crafting reagent used for end-game crafting.

The direct follow-up, [[In Tyr's Footsteps: The Ohn'ahran Plains]], was unlocked on 2022-12-13, but is no longer time-gated.
