==Objectives==
Gather 20 Stolen Tools from the [[gnoll]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Dothenos]] of the [[Valdrakken Accord]].
*[[Stolen Tools (item)]] (20)

==Description==
We have been plagued by gnolls raiding our supply [[caravan]]s. They appear to be obsessed with the various [[engineering]] tools within. We cannot risk these violent raiders figuring out our specialized art! Also, these [[Thief|thefts]] have set our production schedule back more than I'd like to admit.

If you can retrieve some of the stolen engineering parts, we can get back on schedule.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Engineering Details]]

==Progress==
Have you retrieved the stolen tools?

==Completion==
These parts will help us get back on track with our engineering projects.

==Patch changes==
