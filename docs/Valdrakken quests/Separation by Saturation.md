==Objectives==
Craft 2 Pendants of Impending Perils for [[Tuluradormi]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Pendant of Impending Perils]] (2)

==Description==
Oh jewelcrafter, do you like my necklace?

Of course you do. But I cannot show it off properly unless it stands out.

I know! Why don't you make a few simple pendants and we shall flood the market. Once everyone is wearing your designs, my necklace will be a sparkling cut above the rest!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Jeweler's Cuts
}}

==Progress==
Do you have the pendants?

==Completion==
All in the name of fashion, <name>.

Here, I made these cuts. You can study them to learn how to be a better jewelcrafter like me.
