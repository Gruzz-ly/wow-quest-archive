'''A Treacherous Race''' begins the final day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Completion==
[[Bobby Carlisle|Bobby]] and [[Preservationist Kathos|I]] finally deciphered the tablets. They tell of an artifact of immense power that was locked away in [[Tyrhold]]. And I fear [[Tithris]] is after whatever that artifact is.

You must secure whatever the tablets speak of before Tithris. Bobby and I will find a guard and join you as soon as we can.

Take our notes. There are many safeguards that you will need to get through to find the artifact's vault.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Ancient Tyrhold Artifact Notes]]

===Lock one - keepers===
[[File:Tyrhold statue with orb.jpg|thumb|A statue at Tyrhold holding an orb]]
Head to [[Tyrhold]] in central [[Thaldraszus]], equip the [[Torch of Pyrreth]], and stand by each big statue that's holding an orb:

===Lock two - forge===
[[File:Tyrhold forge face.jpg|thumb|The face at the forge in Tyrhold]]

Head to the central forge at {{co|61.2|58.7|Thaldraszus}}<!--77975--> and stand by the big titan face to get an hour-long buff:
:{{Abilities|Tyr's Favor|Allows one to navigate the lower tiers of Tyrhold unfettered by its keepers.|icon=inv_mace_2h_titankeepertyr_d_01|notes=60 min buff|id=423792}}

This turns most mobs in the area friendly.

===Lock three - parts===
[[File:Broken Urn.jpg|thumb|A Broken Urn in Tyrhold]]
All six of the item locations are in rooms on the lower rings of the central area. Find the items inside [[Broken Urn]]s that the [[Idol of Ohn'ahra]] point to.

===Lock three - consoles===
[[File:Tyrhold Console tower.jpg|thumb|A console tower in Tyrhold]]
[[File:Titan Power Relay.jpg|thumb|A Titan Power Relay]]

Combine both sets of uncommon items into their rare items, then head back to the surface. Head to the front of the [[Mother Oathstone]] at {{co|58.5|58.7|Thaldraszus}} and reset the [[Tricked-Out Thinking Cap]]. Then navigate to the coordinates in the note. Inside each of the towers with an orb on top of them and a water stream in the middle is a [[Titan Power Relay]]. Each relay requires a different item:

{|class="darktable zebra"

| (8, 13) || {{co|59.3|56.9|Thaldraszus}} || 77968

|-
| (25, -24) || {{co|61.0|62.4|Thaldraszus}} || 77973
|}

Once the forth device has been interacted with, players get the {{text|emote|A pulse of energy reverberates across Tyrhold signaling the release of a magical lock.}} emote again.

===Lock four===
[[File:Orb Location.jpg|thumb|Orb Location]]
Head to the top of Tyrhold to find an [[Orb Location]] at {{co|60.1|58.7|Thaldraszus}} on top of a large console. Interact with it to pick up [[An Ominous Artifact]].
