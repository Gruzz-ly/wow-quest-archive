==Objectives==
Meet Ebyssian at the Seat of the Aspects in [[Valdrakken]].
* Take the portal to the [[Seat of the Aspects]] (Optional)
* The Seat of the Aspects reached
* Speak to [[Ebyssian]]
* Witness the Exchange between Ebyssian and Alexstrasza

==Description==
Grief is a painful burden to bear. It warms my heart to see [[Emberthal]] emerge from her sorrow and focus on her people. The pain of her loss will ebb, in due time.

We need to inform [[Alexstrasza]] and the others of what has transpired here... and of the future of the [[black dragonflight]].

With all that you have done to ensure that we have a chance at a future, I would like you to be there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]
* [[Earth-Warder's Thanks]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
We shall see you there, <name>.

==Completion==
A new path. But one I accept gladly.

==Notes==
The portal channeled by the invokers will drop players off atop the [[Seat of the Aspects]] in [[Valdrakken]].
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Ah, there you are. We did not wish to begin without you, <name>.}}

Speak with Ebyssian:
:Are you ready to begin, <name>?
:{{gossip|quest=|Yes, thank you for waiting.}}

A script event plays out:
:''Alexstrasza takes a few steps forward.''
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Welcome home, my friends. What news from [[Aberrus]]?}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Neltharion's abominations have been eradicated. Sadly, not before [[Sarkareth]] succumbed to corruption and had to be struck down.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|A heavy price to pay, but a reminder of the cost of seeking power.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|That is a lesson each of us has had to learn.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Indeed, my brother. And by confronting the darkness of [[Black dragonflight|our flight]]'s past, we have found its future.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|As I had hoped you would. Tell me.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|We believe Ebyssian is the right choice to lead us.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|His wisdom and compassion will pave a new path forward for us all.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I agree. And do you accept this charge, Ebyssian?}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I am honored to do so. But I will require my general and my diplomat at my side.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Then let it be so. Come, take your place among our council... Earth-Warder.}}
:{{text|yell|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Citizens of Valdrakken, hear me! From this day forth, Ebyssian shall serve his people as Earth-Warder and Aspect of the black dragonflight!}}
:''Alexstrasza backsteps to her usual spot.''

On complete, the three black dragons run off to the side, and Ebyssian shifts to dragon form. Alexstrasza starts the next quest, [[Symbol of Hope (quest)]].
