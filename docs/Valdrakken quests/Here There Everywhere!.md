==Objectives==
Play with the Bronze Hatchling.
*Tag started with [[Bronze Hatchling]]
*Hatchling chased to nest

==Description==
Our bronze hatchling has been staying away from the other [[whelp]]s, mostly hanging out in the sand. Sometimes we find him in the sandbox with the others, but we never see him moving around!

He could use some friendship. Why don't you treat him to a game of tag?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
