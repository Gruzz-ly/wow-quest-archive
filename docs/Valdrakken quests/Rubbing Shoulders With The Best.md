==Completion==
Working day and night to outfit our forces is no small feat. It's arduous work, but I enjoy it. And I hear you have been a boon to our efforts. 

As a show of thanks, I want you to take one of my armor pieces. Just one. If you require another, I will want something in trade.

Make your choice quickly. I have work to do!
