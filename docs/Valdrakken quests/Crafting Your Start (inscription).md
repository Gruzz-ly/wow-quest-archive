'''Crafting Your Start''' is available at Renown level 14 with the [[Valdrakken Accord]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|Notebook of Crafting Knowledge
}}

==Completion==
[[Inscription]]? A noble pursuit. It requires a keen mind, a steady hand, and quiet.

If you're looking for training, I don't think you'll make any friends of our master scribes by disturbing them. But I do have some notes they left here for those who want to learn their art.

Perhaps if you practice from their notes, they will gift you with greater knowledge later!
