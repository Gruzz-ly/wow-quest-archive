'''Into the Sands''' begins the seventh day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Completion==
The Idol of Ohn'ahra has interesting properties. I believe it can help recover another object I've been seeking.

Take it south of Azim in the Shifting Sands and use it to search for fragments of the Time-Lost Tablet. 

If fortune favors us, you will find all its pieces and make it whole.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[A Clue: The Shifting Sands]]
