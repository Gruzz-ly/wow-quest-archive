==Description==
The students at [[Algeth'ar Academy]] ran out of solutions... again. Forgive me for asking, but could you gather more so they can continue their studies?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The students are getting impatient.

==Completion==
Excellent. We will not have to cancel the exams. After all, you can't take an exam without solutions!
