==Objectives==
Investigate the [[:Silver Scale]] with [[Koranos]] at [[Tyrhold]].
*Meet Koranos at Tyrhold 
*Place the Silver Scale {{co|58.2|58.7|Thaldraszus}}
*Activate Tyrhold device

==Description==
[[Tyr|Keeper Tyr]] did love his mysteries. Clearly, there is deeper meaning to the gift he gave us. As he most likely forged this scale at his former citadel, perhaps it will be the key to helping unlock its secrets.

Go with Koranos to Tyrhold, <name>. As a trusted advisor and watcher of this land, I am sure he will have insight into this matter.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you discovered something?

==Completion==
That magic... You have awakened something within Tyrhold.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|[[Alexstrasza the Life-Binder]]|Tyrhold may have the answers we seek. Watcher Koranos knows those halls well. He can guide you on your journey.}}
:{{text|say|Watcher Koranos|As the Dragon Queen wishes. I shall meet you there, <name>.}}
:''Koranos takes the Teleport to Bottom Floor and disappears.''

Catch up with Koranos at [[Tyrhold]]:
:{{text|say|Watcher Koranos|Let us see if the scale interacts with the consoles of the hold.}}
:{{text|say|Watcher Koranos|Place it here.}}

Interact with the ghost Silver Scale to place it, then interact with the Tyrhold Console:
:{{text|say|Fragmented Data Entry|For Order to be upheld--sent by the Pantheon to--push back--Void--}}
:{{text|say|Watcher Koranos|That magic!}}
