==Objectives==
Gather 8 Writhebark for [[Agrikus]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Writhebark]] (8)

==Description==
<Name>, you are a skilled herbalist, are you not? I have [[alchemist]]s nearly begging at my door... well, if I had a door... for more Writhebark. We have nearly sold out!

Will you help me gather more? I fear if the alchemists cannot create the phials they need, they will begin experimenting with my belongings.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Herbalism Field Notes]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Artisan's Consortium - Dragon Isles Branch]]

==Progress==
Have you found enough Writhebark?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

Please, take my field notes. Study them to improve your [[herbalism]].

==Notes==
The Writhebark must be silver quality.

==Patch changes==
