==Objectives==
Gather 7 Draconium Ore for Sekita the Burrower in Valdrakken.
*[[Draconium Ore]] (7)

==Description==
There is nothing as useful as Draconium ore. So much can be done with it! It is the perfect ore, pure in every way.

Bring me Draconium. I must have it. You are a miner, yes? Then go mine!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Mining Field Notes]]

==Progress==
Well? Have you brought me my ore?

==Completion==
Yes, yes, yes! This is exactly what I needed.

Take my field notes when you go--I've written down some useful information about the [[mining]] process here in [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]].

==Notes==
The Draconium Ore has to be silver quality.
