==Objectives==
Gather 10 Fresh Proto-Dragon Wings from the [[proto-drake]]s and [[proto-dragon]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Temnaayu]] of the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]].
*[[Fresh Proto-Dragon Wings]] (10)

==Description==
Let me tell you about an opportunity.

The proto-drakes and proto-dragons have an amazing range of motion on their wings. And the ribbing! It is so extendable. We mostly make our kites from stretched hides. With the proto-drakes causing havoc, I was wondering if you could return some of their wings to me? I can make kites that would be the envy of the tribe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Leatherworking Designs]]

==Progress==
Do you have the wings?

==Completion==
These will work masterfully. I will have a working kite fashioned in no time.

Oh, and for all your help, let me give you some insight to your trade. It is the least I can do.
