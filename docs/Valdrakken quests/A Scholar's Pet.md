==Objectives==
Obtain an Enchanted Book pet for [[Zalethgos]].
*[[Lysindra]] visited
*[[Azure Archives Annex|Azure Archives]] visited
*[[Magic Book]] retrieved
*Magic Book given to [[Lasztak]]

==Description==
Long ago in [[Azsuna|Aszuna]]{{sic}}, young [[blue whelp]]s from [[Azurewing Repose]] often studied [[magic]] alongside the [[Night elf|elves]] of [[Nar'thalas Academy]]. I have many fond memories of the place, but one stands out among the others.

The enchanted books, while excellent to study, were quite the rascals. I have heard Lysindra acquired a similar book. I think this would be the perfect pet for Zalethgos!

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Pallibrius|id=375600|Learn how to summon [[Pallibrius (pet)|Pallibrius]].|icon=inv_10_specialization_professionbook_inscription_color1}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Enchanted books are the perfect companions. They are full of magic, knowledge, and fun!

Additionally, you do not need to feed them.

==Completion==
I hope Zalethgos enjoys his new companion.

==Notes==
;Entering Lysindra's shop
:{{Text|say|Lysindra|I see you have returned, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Lysindra|We have just the book you are looking for, but my assistant returned it to the library. Check the Azure Archives.}}

Head to the Azure Archives Annex (not the Azure Archives in the Azure Span) and find the Magic Book. Then, return to Lasztak.
:It is fortunate for us that the Azure Archives are well-versed in dealing with sentient literature.

:{{Gossip|quest=|Here is the magic book for Zalethgos.}}

:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|Excellent <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|Zalethgos, we have something for you.}}
:{{Text|say|Zalethgos|A book!}}
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|Not just a book, a friend.}}
:{{Text|say|Zalethgos|Wow, this is the best book. I will call it [[Pallibrius]], my friend book.}}
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|OK, now stop reading your friend and show it around.}}
:''Zalethgos and Pallibrius leave.''
