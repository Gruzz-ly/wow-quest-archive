'''A Complete Inventory''' concludes the twelfth day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Objectives==
Report your findings to [[Fangli Hoot]] near the barber shop in [[Valdrakken]].

==Description==
<Compile your notes on the caches for Fangli Hoot in Valdrakken.>

==Completion==
Hmm, nothing unusual. Still, I'm convinced this is our [[drakonid]]. Why would a simple innkeeper be meeting up with so many shady characters?

I need to recheck my data and look through what you brought me. Maybe something will pop up.

Watch yourself, <name>. I may be paranoid, but I'm not blind. We're running out of time.

==Notes==
This is the "Under Suspicion" criterion of [[Whodunnit?]]

==Progression==
{{Secrets of Azeroth}}

==Patch changes==
*{{hotfix|date=2023-09-13|note=On the secret day starting with "[[They Are Always Listening]]", you should now get the quest "A Complete Inventory" from [[Fangli Hoot]] if you do not get it automatically by investigating all 6 notes.}}
*{{Patch 10.1.5|note=Added.}}
