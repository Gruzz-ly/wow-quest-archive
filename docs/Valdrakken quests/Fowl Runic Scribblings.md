==Objectives==
Help put the [[Little Scales Daycare]] back into order.
*[[Scrawled Rune]] dispelled (5)
*[[Ducks Devil]] slain
*[[Misplaced Toy]] collected (5)
*Toys put away

==Description==
Our [[Rune magic|magic rune]] lesson yesterday has apparently bled into today. The whelps are keen on practicing their runes anywhere they can, prudent or not.

This fascination has led to an interesting playtime period! Please, help us return the toys to their proper place and dispel any runes you come across.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
*5x [[Flightstones]]

{{itembox|You will also receive one from:|Battle Pet Bandage
|Beast Battle-Training Stone
|Humanoid Battle-Training Stone
|Mechanical Battle-Training Stone
|Critter Battle-Training Stone
|Elemental Battle-Training Stone
}}

==Progress==
We really ought to teach them runes for something helpful, like stone polishing...

That would have gone a long way here.

==Completion==
Thank you for the assistance, <name>. That sandbox has a mind of its own!

We will do our best to keep the whelps from stirring it up again via runes.

==Notes==
;Scrawled Rune dispelled
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|We need bigger paper.}}
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|That just might be the solution!}}

;Ducks Devil killed
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|I am pleased the whelps are practicing their runes, but this...}}
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|I know. I thought providing paper would satisfy their interest, but clearly it did not.}}

;Misplaced Toy collected
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|No, I will not draw an outline of you. That is silly.}}
:{{Text|say|Agapanthus|...Stop squirming! I need to capture your elbow!}}

Put the toys into the [[Duck Pile]].
