'''A Proper Burial''' is the tenth day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Completion==
Today you'll be returning a [[:Maruuk Burial Banner]]. Truth be told, I almost feared that [[An Inside Job?|someone had stolen it]]. Again! But after searching [[Roasted Ram|the entire tavern]], I went to double-check [[Preservationist's Locker|my locker]] and found it safe and sound!

The stress of these recent events seem to be getting to me...

Please, speak with [[Sansok Khan]] in [[Maruukai]] and return the banner to where it belongs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Maruuk Burial Banner#A Proper Burial]]

===Sansok Khan===
[[File:Sansok Khan.png|thumb|upright|[[Sansok Khan]]]]
Speak with [[Sansok Khan]] at her usual spot at {{co|63.4|41.4|Ohn'ahran Plains}} in [[Maruukai]] on the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]]:

{{book|content=
<As Sansok Khan signs, Okir vocalizes.>

Welcome to Maruukai.

{{gossip|I am here to return this burial banner to its rightful location.}}

<Sansok Khan reaches out a hand, gesturing for you to let her examine the banner.>

{{gossip|<Offer the banner to Sansok Khan.>}}

<Sansok Khan examines the banner, reading the text that flows along its edges. She hands the banner to Okir and begins to sign to you. Okir Vocalizes.>

I thank you for bringing this banner back to our people. It describes the final journey of [[Ishtaar Rethon]]. 

Ishtaar was a renowned hunter of the Shikaar clan. As he grew older, he looked back on his life and saw only conflict. He traveled to the Shikaar Highlands to speak with the great spirit Ohn'ahra. Legends say that she urged him to find balance with the land.

This banner honors his memory. It must be returned.

{{gossip|I will return it. Where was his final resting place?}}

<Sansok Khan nods and begins to sign. Okir Vocalizes.>

There are hunters who follow in Ishtaar's hoofsteps, but I do not know where this journey begins. You must seek out a member of the Shikaar clan to learn more.

{{gossip|Do you know someone I can speak with?}}

<Sansok Khan gives you a determined look and then begins to sign. Okir Vocalizes.>

The Shikaar were recently savaged by the Nokhud clan. Those who survived went to the Pinewood Post.

You must seek out Jhara. She will be able to give you directions from there.

<Sansok Khan takes the banner from Okir and offers it back to you.>

{{gossip|<Take the banner.>}}

<Sansok Khan places her hand over her heart and then begins to sign. Okir vocalizes.>

May the wings of Ohn'ahra light your path.

{{gossip|I will see the banner returned.}}

<Sansok Khan bows her head to you in acknowledgement.>

===Jhara===
[[File:Jhara.png|thumb|upright|[[Jhara]]]]
[[Sansok Khan]] hands over [[Ishtaar Rethon's Burial Banner]]. Take it to [[Jhara]] at {{co|81.3|59.3|Ohn'ahran Plains}} at the inn of [[Pinewood Post]]:

{{book|content=
Welcome to my inn, weary traveler. What can I do for you?

{{gossip|I am here to follow in the steps of Ishtaar Rethon.}}

The burial banner of Ishtaar Rethon! To think that it was stolen from us. So few take the path that it might have been years before we discovered it was missing.

In order to return the banner, you must first follow the Path of Ishtaar.

{{gossip|Where must I go?}}

First you must head northeast to the mountain's peak near the center of our village. But beware, for clan Nokhud soldiers are still patrolling the area.

Here is a picture of the great statue of Ohn'ahra. Your journey starts there. The first cairn you must find is located just to the statue's right.

{{gossip|<Take the drawing from Jhara.>}}

May Ohn'ahra bless your journey.
}}

Jhara hands over [[The Path of Ishtaar Drawing]]. Read it to show an image of the statue of [[Ohn'ahra]] above the [[Shikaar Highlands]] along with a note:

{{book|content=
[[File:The Path of Ishtaar Drawing.jpg|center]]

Jhara said the first cairn along the Path of Ishtaar is located near the prey of Ohn'ahra below the statue.

From,<br>
<name>}}

If players speak with Jhara again while in possession of the drawing, she repeats:

{{book|content=
{{gossip|Where must I go?}}

Do you need directions again?

First you must head northeast. The statue is at the mountain's peak near the center of our village. But beware, for clan Nokhud soldiers are still patrolling the area.

Remember, the first cairn is to the statue's right.
}}

===First cairn===
[[File:Aged Marker 1.jpg|thumb|The first Aged Marker at the [[Shikaar Highlands]]]]
At {{co|83.9|48.5|Ohn'ahran Plains}} on the [[Shikaar Highlands]] is an [[Aged Marker]] that reads:

{{book|content=
Enter the turbulent cavern of sulfur elementals in the Roaring Dragonsprings. 

Seek a vantage point to look down on the pool of nature's raging waters. See how they always find a path forward. 

Hone your eyes like Ohn'ahra to find the next cairn on Ishtaar's great journey.

{{gossip|<Write down the clue next to the drawing Jhara gave you.>}}
}}

That adds this page to the Path of Ishtaar drawing:

{{book|content=
The First Cairn of Ishtaar<br>
<nowiki>*</nowiki> Find a cavern in the Roaring Dragonsprings filled with sulfur elementals.<br>
<nowiki>*</nowiki> Seek the path to a spot where you can look down on the main pool.<br>
<nowiki>*</nowiki> The Idol of Ohn'ahra can find the cairns.

From,<br>
<name>
}}

===Second cairn===
[[File:Aged Marker 2.jpg|thumb|The second Aged Marker in the [[Roaring Dragonsprings]]]]
Head to the [[Roaring Dragonsprings]] and enter the cave. In the back at {{co|78.7|83.3|Ohn'ahran Plains}} is another Aged Marker that reads:

{{book|content=
As the tales of our deeds drift on the wind, so does the song of Ohn'ahra ring over the Windsong Rise. Follow this song and seek out a point five paces west and two paces north of the main altar. 

Look out over the plains we call our home and all that live and thrive within it.

{{gossip|<Write down the clue next to the drawing Jhara gave you.>}}
}}

That adds this to the drawing:
{{book|content=The Second Cairn of Ishtaar<br>
<nowiki>*</nowiki> Find Windsong Rise on the mesa in the south central part of the plains.<br>
<nowiki>*</nowiki> Locate the main altar.<br>
<nowiki>*</nowiki> The next marker should be located (-2, 5) from the main altar.

From,<br>
<name>
}}

===Third cairn===
[[File:Aged Marker 3.jpg|thumb|The third Aged Marker at [[Windsong Rise]]]]
Head to the main altar of [[Windsong Rise]] at {{co|61.0|64.5|Ohn'ahran Plains}} and reset the [[Tricked-Out Thinking Cap]] to reset to (0, 0). Navigate northwest to (-2, 5) to spot the third Aged Marker at {{co|60.7|63.5|Ohn'ahran Plains}} at the edge of the cliff. It reads:

{{book|content=
Those whose legacy we embody were also hunters of renown. All the way back to our founders who were laid to rest in the Eternal Kurgan's largest burial mound southwest of Teerakai. 

As you reach the back of the tomb, remember that we all will die someday. These ancient tombs remind us that in time even our most prized possessions will fall to dust. It is only our deeds that will live on. What deeds do you want to be remembered for?

{{gossip|<Write down the clue next to the drawing Jhara gave you.>}}
}}

As before, another page got added to the drawing, and it reads:

{{book|content=
The Third Cairn of Ishtaar<br>
<nowiki>*</nowiki> Travel to the Eternal Kurgan southwest of Teerakai.<br>
<nowiki>*</nowiki> Find the largest burial mound. The next cairn is within.

From,<br>
<name>
}}

===Fourth cairn===
[[File:Aged Marker 4.jpg|thumb|The fourth Aged Marker at [[Eternal Kurgans]]]]
Head west to the [[Eternal Kurgans]], enter the largest burial mound to the southwest, and take the left (southeast) fork once inside to find at {{co|31.6|71.6|Ohn'ahran Plains}} the fourth Aged Marker:

{{book|content=
The great hunter sought to balance himself and his legacy. Having found mastery over beasts already, he desired a new path. He sought out a place amongst the Primordial Vale. A forested lake area southeast of the Nokhud lands. 

There he sought to find shelter in the rocks and a home among beasts great and small. All in harmony.

{{gossip|<Write down the clue next to the drawing Jhara gave you.>}}
}}

The drawing's new page reads:

{{book|content=
The Fourth Cairn of Ishtaar<br>
<nowiki>*</nowiki> Navigate to the Primordial Vale. It is the forest and lake area southeast of Nokhudon Hold.<br>
<nowiki>*</nowiki> Find a cave Ishtaar might have called his home.

From,<br>
<name>
}}

===Fifth cairn===
[[File:Aged Marker 5.jpg|thumb|The fifth Aged Marker at [[Deadsnare Caverns]]]]
Just outside [[Deadsnare Caverns]] in the [[Primordial Vale]], find another Aged Marker at {{co|43.3|48.0|Ohn'ahran Plains}} covered in cobwebs. While webbed, it reads: <Cobwebs cover the cairn obscuring the writing. Perhaps they could be burned away?>

Break out the [[Torch of Pyrreth]] to burn away the webs, then read the Aged Marker again:

{{book|content=
Within lies the final resting place of Ishtaar Rethon. Once a hunter of renown, he died among the many beasts of the vale. 

May those who seek the balance of nature and its beasts find the same peace and understanding as the great hunter.

{{gossip|<Write down the clue next to the drawing Jhara gave you.>}}
}}

The note reads:
{{book|content=
The Final Cairn of Ishtaar<br>
<nowiki>*</nowiki> The burial spot lies within the Dreadsnare Caverns.

From,<br>
<name>
}}

===Final cairn===
[[File:Large Unmarked Stone Cairn.jpg|thumb|The Large Unmarked Stone Cairn and Banner Stand]]
Head to the back of the caverns and go upstairs to find at {{co|42.7|51.0|Ohn'ahran Plains}} a [[Large Unmarked Stone Cairn]] and the ghost of a [[Banner Stand]]. Interact with the stand:

{{book|content=
The banner standard looms empty over a much larger cairn which is most likely the final resting place of Ishtaar Rethon.

{{gossip|<Tie the burial banner back up to the stand.>}}
}}

One final page gets added to The Path of Ishtaar Drawing:

{{book|content=
The burial banner was returned successfully to Ishtaar Rethon's final resting spot.

From,<br>
<name>
}}

This is the "A Proper Burial" criterion of [[Whodunnit?]].
