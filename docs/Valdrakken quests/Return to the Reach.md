==Objectives==
Meet [[Scalecommander Viridia|Viridia]] in the [[Forbidden Reach]].
* Speak with [[Aluri|Flightmaster Aluri]] to fly to the Forbidden Reach (Optional) {{co|44.1|67.9|Valdrakken}}
* Find Viridia in the Forbidden Reach

==Description==
Long ago, the Reach was our training ground. Now it's time to return. The island may still hold secrets from our past.

Scalecommander Viridia has gone on ahead. She awaits the arrival of any who would lend us their aid. We'll need all the help we can get finding a foothold in the Reach. Safe travels.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Primalist Cloak]]
* {{cost|21|6|75}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +150 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +150 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Completion==
You came from the mainland? Our call for aid has been answered, then.

Our allies have come from every corner of the isles, but our base of operations is far from secure.

Come, <class>. There is much to do.

==Notes==
Should players not wish to [[dragonriding|dragonride]] there themselves, [[Aluri]], [[Valdrakken]]'s flight master, can send players there via a quest-only flight path:
:{{gossip|quest=|Take me to [[Morqut Village]].}}
The flight path will drop players off in front of [[Renpiaq]], the [[Morqut Village]] flight master.

Find [[Scalecommander Viridia]] at the north end of the village.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Viridia|I am Viridia, Scalecommander of the Healing Wings.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Viridia|We are here on a mission to help those dracthyr that were left behind and make the Reach safe for all.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Viridia|But we are finding ourselves stretched thin, and we need as much aid as we can muster... which is why your arrival is greatly appreciated.}}

==Progression==
