'''Idol Searching''' begins the sixth day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Completion==
Another note from [[Preservationist Kathos|Kathos]]' [[Preservationists|order]] just arrived.

It says that a [[Maruuk]] artifact hidden within one of the burial mounds of the [[Eternal Kurgans]] is at risk. The note mentions ancient incense concealing the artifact from outsiders.

The rest of the info is in this note. Best of luck, [[adventurer]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Preservationist's Dispatch Two]]

The dispatch reads:

{{:Preservationist's Dispatch Two}}

Head to the [[Eternal Kurgans]] in southwestern [[Ohn'ahran Plains]]. Enter the burial mound at {{co|35.2|65.8|Ohn'ahran Plains}} <!--77405--> and get close to the [[Ancient Incense Brazier]] with the [[Torch of Pyrreth]] equipped to interact with it:
:{{text|emote|Incense smoke rises and floats toward the entrance of the burial mound.}}

Head to another burial mound at {{co|32.4|68.0|Ohn'ahran Plains}} to find another:<!--77406-->
:{{text|emote|The incense smoke grows thicker. You follow it leaving the entrance, heading northeast.}}

Find the third inside the large burial ground at {{co|31.1|70.8|Ohn'ahran Plains}}:<!--77407-->
:{{text|emote|The smoke grows thicker. It is clearly heading in the direction of Teerakai.}}

Finally, enter the large burial mound in [[Teerakai]] from the southeast (not the northeast entrance) to find the final brazier at {{co|39.6|58.9|Ohn'ahran Plains}} <!--77404--> and the [[Idol of Ohn'ahra (item)]] right next to it. The idol starts [[An Idol in Hand]], which rewards the [[Idol of Ohn'ahra]] toy.

Note that the tracking quests are based on the amount of burners interacted with, not the specific burner at that location.

The final brazier reportedly does not always react in [[War Mode]].
