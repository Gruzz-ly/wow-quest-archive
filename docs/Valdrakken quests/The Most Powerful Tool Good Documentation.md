==Objectives==
Craft 2 Core Explorer's Compendiums for [[Talendara]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Core Explorer's Compendium]] (2)

==Description==
My scribe apprentice, do you feel ready for writing today? The [[Dragonscale Expedition]] has brought copious notes from their adventures, and they have asked that we compile their chicken-scratch penmanship into a suitable compendium for field-ready review. And oh, my hand is simply not up for the task today. Could I rely on you once more?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Scribe's Glyphs
}}

==Progress==
Have you inscribed the compendiums?

==Completion==
Thank you, my scribe apprentice, thank you.

Please take these glyphs as a token of my thanks. Perhaps you can study them to further your practices.
