'''An Ominous Artifact''' concludes the [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Objectives==
Secure the Orb of Rathmus as well as the artifact it is hiding.
*Investigate the Orb Slot on the Console (Optional)
*Defeat [[Amerinth]]
*Defeat [[Tithris]]
*Secure the [[:Orb of Rathmus]]
*Place the Orb of Rathmus atop the Console
*Secure the Mysterious Artifact
*Retrieve the Orb of Rathmus

==Description==
<An orb would fit perfectly atop the console.>

==Progress==
A chest! Locked away in [[Tyrhold]] all this time. Can I examine it?

==Completion==
The text on top of this chest is definitely [[Titan (language)|titan]]. But here, this is a language used by the [[Burning Legion]]! And this text is used by servants of the [[Old Gods]]. I've never seen these three languages being intermingled like this.

I'm not fluent, but the [[titan]] text speaks of a danger within the chest. An item? Or perhaps just... knowledge.

My order will see that the chest is secured and studied. Thank you again, <name>. In my eyes, you're an honorary [[Preservationists|Preservationist]] at this point.

==Notes==
[[File:An Ominous Artifact.jpg|thumb|Tithris and Amerinth]]

Accept the quest and interact with the [[Orb Location]]:
{{book|content=
This spot is clearly where the final clue suggests the orb would be placed.

{{Gossip|<Investigate to see if you can bypass the orb.>}}
}}

:''[[Tithris]] and [[Amerinth]] run in.''
:{{text|say|Tithris|I must thank you, [[adventurer]]. I would never have gotten this far on my own.}}
:{{text|say|Tithris|Unfortunately, I no longer require your assistance. Time to tie up this loose end!}}
:{{text|say|Preservationist Kathos|Tithris, why are you doing this? What do you hope to gain?}}
:{{text|say|Tithris|The artifact, of course. And many more besides. It seems you should have trusted that meddlesome goblin after all.}}

Fend them off.
:{{text|say|Tithris|Others... pull the strings.... You and I are but... puppets....}}
:{{text|say|Preservationist Kathos|Others? Wait, now is not the time. We must use the orb to secure that artifact. Before anyone else tries to steal it!}}

Loot the [[Orb of Rathmus]] from [[Tithris]]'s corpse, then interact with the Orb Location again:
{{book|content=

{{gossip|<Place the Orb of Rathmus.>}}
}}
:{{text|emote|A magical shroud lifts from an object sitting on the console.}}

[[File:Orb of Rathmus.jpg|thumb|[[:Orb of Rathmus]]]]
Interact with the Orb of Rathmus:

{{book|content=
<The symbols on the Orb of Rathmus light up. They look the same as the symbols on the console below.>

{{gossip|<Retrieve the Orb of Rathmus.>}}
}}

[[File:Mysterious Artifact.jpg|thumb|[[Cache of Cosmic Curiosities|Mysterious Artifact]]]]
Also interact with the chest on the console to loot the Mysterious Artifact for the [[Cache of Cosmic Curiosities]].

On complete:
:{{text|say|Preservationist Kathos|We will take the chest back to [[Valdrakken]] for further study. Order, fel, void... What could it mean?}}

This completes the [[Whodunnit?]] achievement, granting the title {{title|Honorary Preservationist}} and [[Pattie's Cap]].

===Preservationist Kathos===
Back at the [[Roasted Ram]] inn of [[Thaldraszus]], [[Preservationist Kathos]] has new gossip:

{{book|content=
Greetings, adventurer. Do you wish to aid my efforts?

{{gossip|What happened to that [[:Cache of Cosmic Curiosities]] we found?}}

[[Bobby Carlisle|Bobby]] and I brought it straight to the Valdrakken Vaults. 

It is like nothing I've ever seen. [[Preservationist Raithto]] is on his way to study it. He is one of our oldest members.

{{gossip|The [[Eredun|fel symbols]], what could they mean?}}

It is unsettling to see. After all, the [[Burning Legion]] has threatened [[Azeroth]] time and time again. 

That said, we believe this text predates the time when [[Sargeras]] ruled over the demons of the Burning Legion. Though the exact origin has yet to be discovered.

{{gossip|What could the [[Shath'Yar|Old God writing]] signify?}}

There hasn't been much whisperings about the [[Old Gods]] since [[N'zoth]] [[Ny'alotha, the Waking City|was defeated]]. I do remember hearing a rather odd rumor about a [[Xal'atath|void creature]] trapped in [[Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|a weapon of some sort]]. I shudder to think if there are other such artifacts...

This cache, though. Could it contain [[void]] energies? Such ancient, chaotic forces wouldn't mix well with demonic [[fel]]l{{sic}} or titanic [[order]]. And so the Old God text troubles me the most. Further research is needed, that is certain.

{{gossip|Was there any more you could discern from the [[Titan (language)|titan text]]?}}

We know by [[Tyrhold|its location]] that [[Tyr]] was entrusted with securing the cache. However, even with our knowledge of the [[titan]] language, the text is near impossible to translate. It appears to be a cypher of some sort.

I do wonder if there are other titan vaults out there with similar artifacts. If they were hidden as well as this one, they may still be undiscovered. However, if the group behind [[Tithris]] is actively searching for them...

It is the Preservationist's{{sic}} top priority to uncover and secure any other caches. And when that time comes, we may just need your help.

===Bobby Carlisle ===
As does [[Bobby Carlisle]]:

{{book|content=
Well hello! You appear to have a keen eye. Are you here to read an article on the Eye of Azeroth?

{{gossip|Who do you think [[Tithris]] was working with?}}

That's going to be a tough nut to crack. 

I interviewed all of the contacts [[Fangli Hoot|Fangli]] identified. All they knew is that he was planning an expedition to [[Tyrhold]]. Many think he was planning to leave the [[Dragon Isles]] afterwards.

{{gossip|Should we still investigate?}}

Well, I'm sure you're busy with other heroic deeds. The Dragon Isles has need of you yet, that I'm sure.

You leave the investigating to me. I'll let you know if I pick up any leads.

{{gossip|Where will you start your investigation?}}

Well, we know Tithris wasn't working alone. We found a couple of notes on him that suggest he was contacted after the Dragon Isles re-awoke. That means the group probably isn't local.

And if there are other caches like the one we found, that means that there will be others like Tithris looking for them. To what ends? I don't know. But given that they're working in secret, it can't be any good.

I've been asking around a few contacts who have knowledge of fel, void, and titan magic. Not that there's many of them, mind.

{{gossip|What did your contacts have to say?}}

Not much yet. We'll have to wait for a lead to surface. 

I think this nefarious group lucked out here in the Dragon Isles. With the island being so isolated for so long, that meant no one had discovered the cache before we did. But that may not be the case in the more explored parts of [[Azeroth]].

I wonder if there's someone out there trying to keep caches like this hidden...

The events here were pretty public, though. And the Preservationists haven't kept the cache we found a secret. I wonder if we may soon see more of these cosmic artifacts surfacing.

===Marinth===
As does [[Marinth]]:

{{book|content=
Welcome to the Roasted Ram, traveler. What can I get for you?

{{gossip|Where is Tithris?}}

You haven't heard? Seems the mad lad got caught up in some dark dealings. Had to be taken out, from what I heard. 

The details on what happened are still sketchy. I swear that Preservationist and reporter were involved, but both have been pretty tight lipped since the news hit Valdrakken.

You didn't hear this from me, but I heard Tithris was working for the [[Primal Incarnates|Incarnates]]. Quite the scandal.
