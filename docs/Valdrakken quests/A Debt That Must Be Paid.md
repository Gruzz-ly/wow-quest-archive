'''A Debt That Must Be Paid''' begins the [[Ohn'ahran Plains storyline#Old Hatreds|Old Hatreds storyline]] involving [[Baine Bloodhoof]] in the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]]. [[Mayla Highmountain]] will offer it to players who have completed the [[Ohn'ahran Plains storyline]] starting in [[patch 10.0.7]].

==Objectives==
Find [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]] in the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].

==Description==
<Name>, I have heard you cultivated good relations with the [[centaur]] of the Ohn'ahran Plains. I would like to ask a favor.

Baine left for the plains a few days ago in search of a group of missing [[tauren]]. I offered to accompany him, but he insisted on going alone.

The tauren of [[Thunder Bluff]] have a long and bloody history with the centaur of [[Kalimdor]], as does Baine. While the [[Maruuk Centaur|Maruuk centaur]] are unrelated, I still have my concerns.

Your presence could help smooth tensions. I hope.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|80|90}}
*1200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, <name>. [[Mayla Highmountain|Mayla]] sent you?

While I prefer to do this alone, I admit your relationship with the centaur might be useful.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Mayla Highmountain|One more thing--please, watch over Baine. He was so intense about this matter... I worry for him.}}

==Progression==
{{Baine 10.0.7}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.7|note=Added.}}
