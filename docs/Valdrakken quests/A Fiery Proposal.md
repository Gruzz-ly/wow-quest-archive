==Objectives==
Collect 10 Fiery Essence from [[fire elemental]]s in the [[Emerald Dream (zone)|Emerald Dream]].
*Complete the events of "Enter the Dream"
*[[Fiery Essence]] (10)

==Description==
Ah hello!

I have been working with some [[inscriber]]s recently. We've been making a new type of [[ink]]. It's like fire ink, but even fierier!

We need fiery essence from fire elementals, and fire elementals are currently attacking the dream. I believe this is what is called a "win win" scenario.

Please drop their essence off at my associate in [[Amirdrassil]].

==Rewards==

==Progress==

==Completion==
Ah, wonderful. I will pass these on.

Thank you, <name>.
