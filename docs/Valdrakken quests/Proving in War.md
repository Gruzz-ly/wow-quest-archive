==Objectives==
Obtain Honor in Epic Battlegrounds.
*[[:Honor]] Earned in [[Epic Battleground]] (1500)

==Description==
You wish for a 'real challenge' do you? So be it. I know of some large-scale conflicts that could possibly challenge even me.

I am quite curious to see how you fail... I mean do. Let us see if you can prove yourself to me.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Dragonscale Expedition Commendation
|Iskaara Tuskarr Commendation
|Maruuk Centaur Commendation
|Valdrakken Accord Commendation
}}

{{itembox|You will also receive:
|Malicia's Hoard
|q2=500|Honor
|q3=175|Conquest
}}

==Progress==
Why have you returned? You have proven nothing.

==Completion==
Well, then. I suppose I am forced to concede my assumptions about you and be impressed. But only a little. Here, you have earned this.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.1.0|note=Added [[Malicia's Hoard]] to the rewards.}}
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
