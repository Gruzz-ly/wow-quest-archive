==Objectives==
Gather 12 Tempest Armaments from the [[Clan Nokhud|Nokhud]] [[centaur]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Temnaayu]] of the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]].
*[[Tempest Armaments]] (12)

==Description==
Ah, you have arrived just in time! We've heard tales that the Nokhud centaur have powerful, dangerous weaponry infused with storm enchantments. We would like to bring some samples to our enchanters for study.

At the very least, we can decommission the weapons and put them to better use.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Enchanter's Script]]

==Progress==
Have you found any weapons for study?

==Completion==
With these weapons no longer in destructive hands, we can feel more at peace and begin to understand these enchantments.

==Patch changes==
