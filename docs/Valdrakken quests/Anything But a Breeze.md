==Objectives==
Collect a Breezehunter Egg.
*Locate the Breezehunter's nest
*Fight [[Protective Breezehunter]]
*[[Breezehunter Egg]]
*Return to [[Rumiastrasza]] at The [[Ruby Feast]] in [[Valdrakken]].

==Description==
Breezehunters?! Oh, those [[falcon]]s have been a problem. Just the other day, our [[stable master]], [[Marren]], almost fell to her death trying to tame one.

She's pretty proud, so she blamed it on the breezehunter itself. Told me that if it didn't think her eggs were being attacked, it wouldn't have been so aggressive as to bully her off the cliff's edge.

I guess that means that you might find the eggs you're looking for out there? It was to the east, just around the mountainside here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*9,500 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=5|Ravenberry Panacotta Delight
|Picante Pomfruit Cake
|q3=5|Moira's Choice Espresso
}}

==Progress==
Looks like you made it back with a few scrapes as well as the egg!

Worry not about your pride or anything of the like! Even a [[dragon]] of my size wouldn{{sic}} not want to take on a nest of them alone.

==Completion==
Glorious!

[[Chef Morsel|Morsel]] and I will whip up a cake so divine your palette will swear it was in the afterlife. Imagine an experience that is lighter than air, tangy like a sunfruit, but with a crisp texture.

Prepare to feel like a breezehunter yourself!

==Notes==
The nest is at {{Co|85.46|43.18|Ohn'ahran Plains}}.

Upon approaching the nest:
:{{Text|yell|Protective Breezehunter|Caw! Caaaaaw!}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Chef Hearthkiln|Being an artisan o' tha forge, I say we turn this beauty into a souffle!}}
:{{Text|say|Rumiastrasza|Marvelous idea, Chef! I would delight in trying it with a few shavings of dark iron limestone as well!}}

==Progression==
{{The Ruby Feast}}
