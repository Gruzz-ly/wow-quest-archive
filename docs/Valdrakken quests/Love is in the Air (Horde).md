Visit the Gala of Gifts in [[Durotar]], near [[Rocktusk Farm]].

==Description==
;Commoners
Smell these roses! My partner got them for me at the Gala of Gifts.

Interested in seeing things yourself? Head to Durotar. There are gifts, and food, and you should taste the chocolate, it's delicious!

;Aurora Vabsley
Do you appreciate gifts, flowers, and food? How about vacations to beautiful, distant lands?

Come to the Gala of Gifts! There are roses aplenty and chocolates galore!

My portal will take you there. Simply touch it and imagine your heart's desire!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||5}}
* 30 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Welcome to the Gala, friend!

Would you like to hear more about our specialty chocolates?

==Notes==
In [[Valdrakken]], an arcane projection of [[Aurora Vabsley]] offers this quest outside the bank. Interact with the [[Scenic Getaway Portal]] at {{co|54.3|63.2|Valdrakken}} and select the Gala of Gifts option to head directly to the event site.

{{book|content=
