==Objectives==
Gather 2 Dense Hides for [[Ralathor the Rugged]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Dense Hide]] (2)

==Description==
Our scales are tough, but we can always use more protection. Only the densest of hides will do for our armor--a challenge to gather, but perhaps one you are up to?

I've seen your skills. Go and gather some hides for our stores.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Skinning Field Notes]]
*+500 reputation with [[Artisan's Consortium - Dragon Isles Branch]]

==Progress==
Only the best will do for our crafts.

==Completion==
Ah! These are excellent quality. I was right about you.

==Notes==
The Dense Hides have to be silver quality.
