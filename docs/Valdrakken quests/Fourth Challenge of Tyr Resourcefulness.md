'''Fourth Challenge of Tyr: Resourcefulness''' is the fourth portion of the "The Spark of Ingenuity" quest line, awarding another [[Bottled Essence]]. This quest was originally unlocked the week of 2023-01-10. The fifth and final portion unlocked the week of 2023-01-24.

==Objectives==
Obtain a Power Core from [[Watcher Irideus]] and defeat the Primal Tsunami in the [[Halls of Infusion]].
* [[Irideus' Power Core]] collected
* [[Primal Tsunami]] slain

==Description==
The engine is close to reaching its full potential. All it requires now is a power core to process any essence put into it more efficiently.

[[Tyr]] left the knowledge of such devices with Watcher Irideus. Go into the Halls of Infusion and find him. I am sure he will help you with whatever you need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|55|24|}}
* 12,850 [[XP]]
* [[Bottled Essence]]

==Progress==
You found Watcher Irideus?

==Completion==
Perhaps it was these enemies of order that Keeper Tyr wished to defend against. At least the loss of Watcher Irideus can still be a victory for us. By his power core we may power the engine and part of him shall always live on as creation of Tyr. 

<You can swear you see sadness cross over the maiden's face.>

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|Do you wish to prove yourself worthy of Tyr's invention? Then join me once more for a new challenge.}}
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|This time you shall need to venture into the Halls of Infusion and use your resourcefulness to seek out what is needed.}}

Complete the [[Halls of Infusion]] dungeon on any non-[[Mythic+]] difficulty level.

Completing this quest is the "Fourth Challenge: Resourcefulness" criterion of [[In Tyr's Footsteps]].
