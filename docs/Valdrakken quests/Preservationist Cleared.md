'''Preservationist Cleared''' concludes the third day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Objectives==
Return the Burial Banner to the [[Preservationist's Locker]] in the [[Roasted Ram]].
* Return the Burial Banner {{co|48.8|47.8|Valdrakken}}
*[[Maruuk Burial Banner]] (provided)

==Description==
Ya better return the item before [[Preservationist Kathos|the Preservationist]] notices it's missing.

Then let [[Fangli Hoot|Fangli]] know that her theory didn't pan out.

==Progress==
What did you discover?

==Completion==
Really? I was pretty sure they were the perpetrator... 

Oh well, I've got other leads to follow. I'll let you know when I'm ready to move on 'em. 

I'll take [[Copied Artifact Storage Key|that key]] back, too.

==Notes==
Return to the [[Preservationist's Locker]] upstairs at {{co|48.8|47.8|Valdrakken}} in the [[Roasted Ram]] inn behind the bed and interact with it:

{{book|content=
<Opened.>

{{gossip|<Return the burial banner.>}}
}}

Turn in to Fangli to earn the "An Inside Job?" criterion of [[Whodunnit?]].
