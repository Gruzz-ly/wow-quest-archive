==Objectives==
Find [[Zhusadormu]] throughout [[Valdrakken]].
*Zhusadormu told to smell [[Sir Pringly]]
*Zhusadormu found in the [[Artisan's Market]]
*Zhusadormu found in the [[Roasted Ram]]
*Zhusadormu found in the [[Bronze Enclave]]

==Description==
Zhusa is throwing us for quite the loop, <name>.

Since he is so young, his control over [[time]] is not fully developed. Unfortunately, he has a strange reflex. Every time he sneezes he disappears, popping up elsewhere in any form! To top it off, he seems to have many allergies.

Please, help figure out what he is allergic to so we can keep him in one place!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones

==Progress==
<Agapanthus rubs his temples.>

Oh, [[bronze whelp]]s...

==Completion==
So Zhusadormu is allergic to... everything?

This may be more troublesome than we thought.
