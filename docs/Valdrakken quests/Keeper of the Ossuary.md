'''Keeper of the Ossuary''' starts "The Veiled Ossuary" questline, featuring the restoration of the [[blue dragonflight]]. It requires having completed [[Moving On (Thaldraszus)]] of the [[Thaldraszus storyline]].

==Objectives==
Meet Senegos in the Veiled Ossuary.
*Speak to [[Senegos]] within the [[Veiled Ossuary]]

==Description==
Greetings, <name>. While I continue to search for the remaining [[blue dragon]]s, I could use your aid in another matter.

[[Alexstrasza]] and I plan on laying to rest the remaining essences of [[Malygos]] and [[Sindragosa]]. She has held on to their lingering essences after both were slain years ago.

Senegos said there was a time where [[dragon]]s would be laid to rest in the Veiled Ossuary. Unfortunately, the place is a mess.

He's gone ahead to clean the area up with [[Stellagosa]]. Could you aid them?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Ah, here to help are we?

==Completion==
Shall we begin?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Senegos should be within the Veiled Ossuary now. Alexstrasza and I will be joining you shortly.}}
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Malygos and Sindragosa both suffered violent deaths in their lifetime. The least we can do is put their remaining essences to rest.}}

;Approaching Senegos at the Ossuary
:{{Text|say|Stellagosa|Grandfather, surely you could rest and leave the cleaning of this place to someone else...}}
:{{Text|say|Senegos|Allow an old dragon a bit of nostalgia. I used to be the keeper of this place when I was younger than you.}}

;Speaking with Senegos
:I appreciate your patience, <name>. I'm sure we'll get this place cleaned in no time.

:{{Gossip|quest=|I'm here to help you, Senegos. Can you tell me more of this place?}}
::The Veiled Ossuary is where we used to bury our dead. Us dragons live quite a long time, but old age does eventually take us all, though [[Dragon Aspects|the Aspects]] play by different rules.

::I imagine [[Kalecgos]] told you he plans to put to rest the last essences of Sindragosa and Malygos.

::Well, we can't do that if the Veiled Ossuary is a mess now can we?

::{{Gossip|quest=|I'm ready to begin helping you clean the Veiled Ossuary.}}
