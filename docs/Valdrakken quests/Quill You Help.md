==Objectives==
Craft 2 Scribe's Fastened Quill for [[Talendara]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Scribe's Fastened Quill]] (2)

==Description==
My scribe apprentice, I am delighted to see you.

Earlier today I had a few novices come in to try their hand at [[inscription]]. They all wrote with too much force and snapped their quill nibs right off!

I hate to ask, but could you craft a few more quills to keep in stock?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Scribe's Glyphs
}}

==Progress==
Have you fresh quills for my apprentices?

==Completion==
Thank you, my scribe apprentice. I do not know what I would do without you.

Please take these glyphs as a token of my thanks. Perhaps you can study them to further your practices.
