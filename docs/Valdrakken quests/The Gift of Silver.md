==Objectives==
Speak to Alexstrasza to reveal [[Tyr]]'s gift.
*Speak to [[Alexstrasza]]
*Reveal the Gift
*Collect the [[:Silver Scale]]

==Description==
Shortly before his passing, Keeper Tyr gifted us with a dragon scale forged of purest silver. We kept it in the vaults of [[Valdrakken]] during our absence, but I believe it is time to share it once more.

Though we have no idea the purpose for this memento, it has always been a symbol of unity and friendship to us. As a true ally to dragonkind, we would like to share it with you. Speak to me when you are ready, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What do you make of this, <name>?

==Completion==
I thank you, <name>, for being an ally we can trust with a matter this important.

==Notes==
Speak with Alexstrasza:
:Life's blessings be with you.

:{{gossip|What is this gift from Tyr?}}
:''[[Alexstrasza]], [[Kalecgos]], and [[Nozdormu]] take on their visage forms and walk toward the center of the room.''
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|This gift from Tyr is precious to us. A final remembrance of a treasured friend.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|His deeds, and his courage, will never be forgotten.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|You have told me stories of that time, but I've never seen the relic he gave you.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|We kept it in a place of honor here in Valdrakken.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|An ingot of pure silver, forged in the shape of a dragon scale.}}
:''Alexstrasza summons the [[Silver Scale]]. Sparks of golden magic arc from it.''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Beautiful! Tell me, has it always pulsed with such potent magic?}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|No... something about it is different. The scale seems to have changed in our absence.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Perhaps our return to the Dragon Isles has awakened it. Tyr was full of mysteries. This may be one last enigma for us to investigate.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|As an ally of dragonkind, <name>, we ask that you take the scale and investigate this matter on our behalf.}}
:''The Aspects return to their usual spots and transform back into dragons.''
