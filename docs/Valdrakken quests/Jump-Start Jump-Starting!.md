'''Jump-Start? Jump-Starting!''' begins the "The Spark of Ingenuity" questline, used to unlock the [[Engine of Innovation]], allowing players to turn [[Bottled Essence]] into a [[Spark of Ingenuity]], a high-value crafting reagent used for end-game crafting.

This quest chain was originally on a one or two-week time-gate, but now can be completed without any forced waiting.

==Objectives==
Help [[Greyzik Cobblefinger|Greyzik]] power-up the mysterious device.
*Pilot the [[Goblin Gyrocopter (Valdrakken)|Goblin Gyrocopter]] {{co|84.8|54.8|Valdrakken}}
*Super-charge the device (0/100%)
*Eject from the Gyrocopter
*Activate the [[Engine of Innovation]]

==Description==
Some folks in the city claim this here device was created by the legendary [[Titanic watcher|Titan Watcher]] [[Tyr]]. 

Problem is we can't get it to work! We tried all the usual tricks, dissemblin', gyroscopin', a little mild electrocution. None of it sides the electrocution worked. Actually... I just had a great idea.

See that gyrocopter over there? Hop in and let's see if we can give this [[titan]] thing a little more... juice.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62|}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What power do you seek?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Greyzik Cobblefinger|For this task I need highly energetic "researchers", willin' to skim over a pile of safety paperwork.}}
:{{text|say|Greyzik Cobblefinger|So... you in or what!?}}

Hop in the gyrocopter near the statue:
:{{text|yell|Greyzik Cobblefinger|Okay hotshot, take my copter into the air. Make sure to be gentle about it! You need to keep it runnin' to generate enough juice for the missiles.}}
:{{text|say|Goblin Engineer|Clearing the area!}}
:{{text|yell|Greyzik Cobblefinger|Yep, I said missiles. We're gonna give this pile of titan junk a proper wake up call.}}
:{{text|yell|Greyzik Cobblefinger|Primed and ready! HIT IT!}}

Players have access to one ability:
:{{Abilities|Electromagnetic Bolt 2000|Fire the makeshift weaponry on the gyrocopter and hope for the best.|range=200|cd=1 sec|id=388054|icon=ability_vehicle_electrocharge|notes=Instant. Ground-targeted.}}

Use it on the nearby engineers for some surprises:
*{{text|say|Goblin Engineer|Hey! I'm standin' here!}}
*{{text|say|Goblin Engineer|Ow! WHY?!}}
*{{text|say|Goblin Engineer|My eyes!}}
*{{text|say|Goblin Engineer|You wanna piece of me?! Come and get it!}}

Once that stops being amusing, focus the device marked with a big yellow arrow until the bar fills. It'll take 5 hits:
:{{text|yell|Greyzik Cobblefinger|Ey, it's workin'!}}
:{{text|yell|Greyzik Cobblefinger|Uhh, which can't be said about the gyrocopter. Eject, eject!}}

As is traditional with goblin engineering... the gyrocopter catches fire! Eject!
:{{Abilities|Eject!|Eject yourself from the vehicle. Screaming optional.|id=387989|icon=ability_vehicle_playerloaded|notes=Instant}}

Hop out and use the provided parachute to safely get back down to the ground:
:{{text|say|Greyzik Cobblefinger|That looks charged up to me. You wanna do the honors?}}

The [[Engine of Innovation]] is sparking with power, so... interact with it:
:''The engine stops sparking and a projection of the [[Maiden of Inspiration]] appears.''
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|Welcome, adventurer.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Greyzik Cobblefinger|By the way, you owe me a gyrocopter.}}

This also fulfills the "Lock and Shock" criterion of [[In Tyr's Footsteps]].
