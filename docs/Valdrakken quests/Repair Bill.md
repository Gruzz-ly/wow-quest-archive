==Objectives==
Craft 6 Serevite Repair Hammers for [[Metalshaper Kuroko]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Serevite Repair Hammer]] (6)

==Description==
The [[Dragon Isles]] have not experienced conflict like this in millennia. Our work is not in dispute, but any good armor suffers from all of this constant use. I have a big order for Serevite Repair Hammers and I need everyone I can get to fill it. If you help out, I will again give you more information to expand your Dragon Isles Blacksmithing skills.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*+125 reputation with [[Artisan's Consortium - Dragon Isles Branch]]
*[[Blacksmith's Writ]]

==Progress==
Are you finished already?

==Completion==
I haven't had this many repair hammers ready to go. Want to wager how long before our customers get through them?

As promised, here is this to study. You can always improve your blacksmithing.
