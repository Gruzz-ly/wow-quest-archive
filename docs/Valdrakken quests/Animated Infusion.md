==Objectives==
Gather 13 Spiked Leaves from the [[lasher]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Dhurrel]] of the [[Maruuk Centaurs]].
*[[Spiked Leaves]] (13)

==Description==
I have a simple request for you today.

The [[alchemist]]s are short on an ingredient used in a particularly tricky brew. The herb is easy enough to retrieve. You'll just need to find some aggressive plants to extract samples from. Think you can handle that?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Maruuk Centaur]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Alchemy Notes]]

==Progress==
Have you retrieved the herbs?

==Completion==
Well, not all hunts will be the most exhilarating. Nonetheless, the samples you retrieved will be put to good use.

==Patch changes==
