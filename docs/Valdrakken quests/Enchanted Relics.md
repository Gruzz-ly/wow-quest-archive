==Objectives==
Gather 10 Enchanted Relics from the [[gnoll]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Temnaayu]] of the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]].
*[[Enchanted Relics (item)]] (10)

==Description==
Ah, the tides have brought you at just the right time! Gnolls have stolen some of our relics. These are more precious than most--they have been enchanted. We cannot allow the gnolls to learn our magics!

Someone of your skill should have no issue identifying the stolen relics. Please, will you lend us your aid?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9,050 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
*+25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Enchanter's Script]]

==Progress==
Have you retrieved the relics?

==Completion==
I worry about what the gnolls may have learned about the relics while they had them in their possession.

Thank you for retrieving them.
