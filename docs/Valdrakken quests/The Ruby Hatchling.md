==Objectives==
Collect the Red Dragon Egg at the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]] then hatch it at the Ruby Oathstone.
*Ruby Egg collected
*Egg hatched at [[Ruby Oathstone]]

==Description==
An egg from the [[red dragonflight]] is ready to hatch.

Report to [[Amella]] in the Ruby Lifeshrine to pick up the egg. Then, I request that you bring the egg to the Ruby Oathstone to hatch in a location strong with our flight's power.

Once this is complete, return here with the hatchling, where we will further take care of it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you brought the newest hatchling?

==Completion==
I am absolutely thrilled! All of my training has more than prepared me for one of my own flight.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Amella
:{{Gossip|quest=|I am here to bring the egg to Valdrakken.}}
:{{Text|say|Amella|[[Red whelp]]s are sweet, but they can be extremely stubborn. Remember, you're in charge.}}

Move to the oathstone and use the Hatch Egg extra action button. A short cutscene starts, with the hatchling hatching from the egg, and landing on the adventurer's head.
