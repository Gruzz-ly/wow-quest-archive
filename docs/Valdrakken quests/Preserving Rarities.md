'''Preserving Rarites''' begins the [[Secrets of Azeroth]] event properly. To start, head to the [[Roasted Ram]] inn of [[Valdrakken]], marked by the Secrets of Azeroth event icon on the zone map:
:The Secrets of Azeroth are being uncovered by a select few in the Roasted Ram inn.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Preservationist Kathos]] to begin a secret, then let her know when it's solved.
*Solve the Mystery {{co|58.9|54.1|Valdrakken}}

==Description==
Let's unravel a secret! Prepare your mind for puzzles...

Speak to me again when you're ready to start down the path of the preservationists.

==Progress==
That mystery isn't going to solve itself!

==Completion==
You unraveled the "mystery" and preserved the artifact!

A good preservationist is always looking to get better at preserving artifacts. If you find anything new, we'll figure out how we can employ it in the field.

==Notes==
Speak with Preservationist Kathos:

{{book||content=
Greetings, adventurer. Do you wish to aid my efforts?

{{Gossip|I'm ready! Give me a secret to solve!}}

Here's a box of clues. See what's inside and let the mystery begin!

You'll have everything you need to unravel this secret. Speak with me once you've done so.

Good luck!

She hands the player [[A Mystery Box]]. Open the box to loot [[Golden Chalice]] and [[A Clue: The Golden Chalice]]. The clue reads:

{{book||content=
Find the Chalice's rightful place. 

Perhaps patrons at the bar of the Roasted Ram, or the bartender himself, will know more.
}}

Speak with [[Tithris]], the innkeeper behind the bar:
{{book||content=
{{Gossip|Recognize this chalice?}}

What a find! A chalice like this belongs in the Treasure Hoard.

You know--the bank!
}}

[[Bobby Carlisle]] also has gossip:

{{book||content=
Well hello! You appear to have a keen eye. Are you here to read an article on the Eye of Azeroth?

{{gossip|Do you recognize this chalice?}}

Nice! Did Kathos give you that?? She probably wants you to return it to where it belongs...

I'd know if the guards raised an alarmed{{sic}}, and they haven't yet. But you can BANK on them finding out soon!
}}

In the [[Valdrakken Treasury Hoard]], look for the ghost of the Golden Chalice at {{co|58.9|54.1|Valdrakken}} on the north wall between the [[Guild Vault]] and [[Vekkalis]]. Interact with it:

{{book||content=
There's a niche among the gold coins where you might fit the Chalice.

{{gossip|<Sneak the chalice into the hoard.>}}
}}

Objective completed, turn in to Kathos back at the inn, which awards the "A Preservationist" criterion of [[Whodunnit?]]. She then starts  [[Rise in Relic Theft]].
