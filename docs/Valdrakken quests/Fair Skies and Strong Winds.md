{{dialogue|
Long ago, [[Neltharion]] was a dear, dear friend. I regret that I was never able to reach him, to help him break free of the corruption that blighted [[Black dragonflight|his entire flight]].

I should not linger on the past. It is far too late to make amends with him, I know.

But... perhaps there are others I can reach.

An [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays:

{{#ev:youtube|AAUg3CwRKaA}}
:''The five Dragon Aspects and Vyranoth, all in their dragon forms, and [[Wrathion]] and [[Sabellian]] look at the adventurer.''
:{{text|bossemote|Alexstrsaza the Life-Binder|My friend, we have asked you here this day... to offer our thanks.}}
:''The camera pans left-to-right across [[Vyranoth]], [[Alexstrasza]], [[Merithra]], [[Kalecgos]], [[Nozdormu]], and [[Ebyssian]].''
:{{text|bossemote|Alexstrsaza the Life-Binder|When we [[dragon]]s returned to our homeland... we were a kingdom divided.}}
:''The dragons all share glances at this.''
:{{text|bossemote|Alexstrsaza the Life-Binder|Old wounds and bitter memories had fractured our unity.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Alexstrsaza the Life-Binder|But thanks to you and all those who stood with us... we have found our way... to a better future.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Alexstrsaza the Life-Binder|We realized that the mistakes of our past need not define us.}}
:''Alextrasza looks at Vyranoth at this, then turns to look at Nozdormu, who nods in return.''
:{{text|bossemote|Alexstrsaza the Life-Binder|That we should not fear the unknown.}}
:''She looks to Merithra and Kalecgos.''
:{{text|bossemote|Alexstrsaza the Life-Binder|That we could embrace our family...}}
:''Then looks to Ebyssian.''
:{{text|bossemote|Alexstrsaza the Life-Binder|While building a new legacy for [[Dragonflight|our flights]].}}
:''Ebyssian looks at Wrathion and Sabellian, and they look at each other. Alexstrasza then turns back to Vyranoth.''
:{{text|bossemote|Alexstrsaza the Life-Binder|A legacy that includes all dragonkind.}}
:''All present focus on the adventurer.''
:{{text|bossemote|Alexstrsaza the Life-Binder|In recognition of everything you have done...}}
:''A great many dragons, dracthyr, and [[Watcher Koranos]] all approach.''
:{{text|bossemote|Alexstrsaza the Life-Binder|...we proclaim you... Champion of the Dragonflights.}}
:''The adventurer holds their weapon aloft.''

After completing this quest, Alexstrasza offers the direct follow-up, [[A Place Beneath the Boughs]]. Vyranoth offers a side quest, [[Siblings Until the End]].

====Kalecgos and Khadgar====
[[File:Dragonflight epilogue - Kalecgos and Khadgar.jpg|thumb|[[Kalecgos]] and [[Khadgar]]]]

[[Kalecgos]] and [[Khadgar]] at {{co|61.6|36.0|Valdrakken}} atop the Seat of the Aspects:

{{dialogue|Our troubles may be far from over, but for the first time since the Primal Incarnates were released, my heart is warm with hope that we will succeed.

[[Blue dragonflight|My flight]] is not my only family, friend. The Aspects and their flights are part of it as well. It's been long since we've come together like this. I... missed it.

Thank you, for all you have done. If it was not clear by now, I consider you a part of my family as well.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
}}
:''Kalecgos shifts to his visage form and walks toward the center of the tower.''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Impeccable timing, <name>. Khadgar should be arriving shortly.}}
:''Khadgar, in raven form, flies in and lands, then shifts out of it.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|My ears are burning, Kalec! To what do I owe the honor?}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Bittersweet news, I'm afraid. Khadgar, I...}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|...I have chosen to step down from the [[Council of Six]].}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|My duties as Aspect must take precedence. I'm needed in Valdrakken far more than in [[Dalaran]].}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Is that all? Forgive me, but that hardly comes as a surprise. I suspected as much when you asked to speak with me.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|So you do not think ill of me for relinquishing my position?}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Perish the thought. Your family comes first, Kalec. I could never fault you for that.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Though... I do have a request to make of you.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|[[Dark Heart|The artifact]] [[Iridikron]] took from the [[Forbidden Reach]], the one he handed over to this mysterious "[[Xal'atath|Harbinger]]"...}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Dalaran's libraries hold precious little information on it. Given [[Malygos]]'s history with Neltharion...}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|You hope that I might have better luck scouring the [[Azure Archives]].}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Consider it done, old friend. I will share all the information I can find.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Thank you, Kalec. Strange, isn't it? The [[Kirin Tor]] and the Aspect of Magic working hand in hand.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|It's a new age. One we will face together. Us, the Council, and whoever replaces me.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Rest assured we will fill your vacant seat... but no one could ever replace you.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Farewell for now, Kalecgos. Be it here, Dalaran, or [[Karazhan]], I look forward to our next reunion.}}
:''Khadgar shifts back to raven form and flies away. Kalecgos walks back to his spot and shifts back to dragon form.''

====Wrathion and Sabellian====
[[File:Dragonflight epilogue - Wrathion and Sabellian.jpg|thumb|[[Wrathion]] and [[Sabellian]]]]

[[Wrathion]] and [[Sabellian]] at {{co|56.7|46.4|Valdrakken}} atop the Seat of the Aspects:
{{dialogue|Ah, <name>! It's good to see you.

I find myself slipping in and out of daydreams as of late. Reminiscing on all that has happened since our arrival on [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]].

Perhaps it is because we find ourselves in a rare moment of respite. Or maybe I'm enthralled by the stunning view from atop this landing.

<Wrathion whispers to conceal his words from Sabellian.>

Or even, dare I say it, thanks to the welcome sight of Ebyssian standing beside the other Aspects.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Wrathion. Ebyssian mentioned that you will soon depart from the Isles.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|I didn't take you as one who engaged in gossip, Sabellian.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Hmph. Does he speak true?}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|He does. Iridikron may be lying low, but he still poses a significant threat to [[Azeroth]].}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|I will coordinate the [[Blacktalon]]'s efforts to track him down. Even Iridikron can't evade them forever.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Indeed. I must admit, your agents have impressed me far more than I expected.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|With rare exception, I never placed much stock in mortals beforehand. You have quite the way with their kind.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|I suppose I do...}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|My time in the Dragon Isles was a grand adventure, but not the homecoming I'd hoped for.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|I've often felt that I share more in common with mortals than with dragons... and feared that I belong among neither.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|I thought that here, in the land of my ancestors, I'd find... something I was lacking.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|That by becoming an Aspect, I could prove who and what I truly am. If not to the world, then at least to myself.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|But I see now that I never had anything to prove. My place is among both mortals and dragons.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|That is my strength, not my failing. It's who I am. Who I've always been.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Well said. You walk a path I never could, Wrathion. Take pride in it.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|And should that path lead you back to the Dragon Isles... I hope it does feel like a homecoming.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Hah! We shall see. Thank you, Brother.}}

====Mathias Shaw and Genn Greymane====
[[File:Dragonflight epilogue - Shaw and Genn.jpg|thumb|[[Mathias Shaw]] and [[Genn Greymane]]]]

[[Mathias Shaw]] and [[Genn Greymane]] at {{co|59.4|43.2|Valdrakken}} on the bottom floor of the Seat of the Aspects next to [[Alregosa]] the portal trainer and the portal to [[Stormwind City]]. To Alliance he says:

{{dialogue|Ah, <name>. Have you kept well here in the Isles?

It just so happens I have some information you might be interested in hearing.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
}}

To Horde he says:
{{dialogue|<Name>.

Normally, I'd do everything in my power to keep sensitive information out of the Horde's hands.

But I suppose I can count you as an exception to the rule.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|You're certain it was [[Anduin Wrynn|him]]?}}
:{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|[[SI:7|My agents]] in [[Ratchet]] confirmed it. He was seen buying supplies.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|Why [[Kalimdor]]? Why wouldn't he return home to [[Stormwind]]?}}
:{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|I don't know. But he was traveling south.}}
:{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Must have noticed my people on his tail. He lost them in the [[Barrens]].}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|South... What could he be after?}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|Send word to [[Jaina]]. She'll want to know where he's headed.}}
:{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|You don't want to go after him yourself?}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|If he's staying away, he must have his reasons. We need to trust him.}}
:{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Should I inform Lord Commander [[Turalyon]]?}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|No. Not until we know more. Let's keep this quiet, Spymaster.}}
:{{text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|It will be done, King Greymane.}}

====Azurathel, Emberthal, and Cindrethresh====
[[File:Dragonflight epilogue - Scalecommanders.jpg|thumb|Scalecommanders [[Scalecommander Azurathel|Azurathel]], [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]], and [[Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Cindrethresh]]]]
Scalecommanders [[Scalecommander Azurathel|Azurathel]], [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]], and [[Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Cindrethresh]] at {{co|39.5|65.6|Valdrakken}} in the [[Artisan's Market]] near the [[Alchemy]] and [[Herbalism]] area:

{{dialogue|You're a welcome face to see today, <name>.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
}}

:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|My dear friends. So much has happened since we awoke in our creches.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|For you most of all, I think.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I am at peace.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|After everything you endured, Emberthal, are you...}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I will ever remember the names of those who were lost, but I have found new purpose in leading the [[Ebon Scales]].}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|And what about each of you?}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|At first, I was skeptical whether we dracthyr would be a good fit for the [[Horde]]. But I have grown fond of them... and they of us.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|My favorites are the [[vulpera]]. Feisty little [[squirrel]]s... or whatever they are.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|Likewise, the [[Alliance]] has formally offered us a place in its ranks. Its members are brave and noble, worthy of our allegiance.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|I believe Lord Commander Turalyon has come to admire our discipline. He appreciates skilled soldiers.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|When we emerged into this new age, we did not know who we could trust.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Now we have many allies. Both in the mortal kingdoms and among the dragons.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Including a new Earth-Warder who won't lock us away for millennia! Probably.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|Assuming you behave yourself, Cindre.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Now what fun would that be?}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Come, friends. There is so much that awaits us... in the Dragon Isles, and beyond.}}
