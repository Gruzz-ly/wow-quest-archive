==Objectives==
Collect 10 Living Chips.
*[[Living Chips]] (10)

==Description==
The crystalline creatures back home are as mysterious as they are stompy.

What allows them to move? Are they even really alive? What do they taste like?

Bring Fanilly a few samples to start studying. Just not any big enough to step on anyone in [[Loamm]], ok?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]
