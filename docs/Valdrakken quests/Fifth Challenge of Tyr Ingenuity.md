'''Fifth Challenge of Tyr: Ingenuity''' begins the fifth and final portion of the "The Spark of Ingenuity" quest line, awarding another [[Bottled Essence]] and the ability to acquire more from adventures out in the world. This quest was originally unlocked the week of 2023-01-24. 

==Objectives==
Attune [[Irideus]]' Power core with titanic energy from [[Tyrhold]].
*Irideus' Power Core Attuned (0/100%)
*[[Irideus' Power Core]] (provided)

==Description==
As this was not how the Power Core was supposed to be obtained it requires a re-attunement to the energies of the Engine. The resonance frequencies of the denizens of Tyrhold should bring the core to it's full potential once more.

Though I do not wish to sacrifice more of my brethren, I believe this is the only this challenge may be completed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|55|24}}
* 12,850 [[XP]]
* [[Bottled Essence]]

==Progress==
How goes your challenge?

==Completion==
You have completed the last challenge. Though it comes at a loss, I believe it is for the greater good. Keeper Tyr meant for you to succeed.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|Do you wish to prove yourself worthy of Tyr's invention? Then join me once more for a new challenge.}}
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|This trial is... unorthodox... but required if you are to have the full power of the Engine available. Head to Tyrhold and reattune the energies of the core.}}

At Tyrhold, use this version of [[Irideus' Power Core]] to weaken elites to help defeat them more quickly. Each elite is worth roughly 20% of the bar.

Fill the bar:
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|Maximum attunement reached. You have restored the Power Core to its original state.}}
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|Return to [[Valdrakken]], adventurer. It is time to insert this new core into the Engine of Innovation.}}

Completing this quest is the "Fifth Challenge: Ingenuity" criterion of [[In Tyr's Footsteps]].
