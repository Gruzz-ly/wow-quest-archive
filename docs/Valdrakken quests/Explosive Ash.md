==Objectives==
Gather 20 Explosive Ash from the phoenixes of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Gnoklin Quirkcoil]] of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]].
*[[Explosive Ash (item)]] (20)

==Description==
The [[molten phoenix]]es in the Dragon Isles create an unusual ash substance once they die. It could be used to create some material improvements for some complex, life-changing machinery. Though I would probably use it for explosives.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Engineering Details]]

==Progress==
Have you found enough ash?

==Completion==
This ash could provide the essential component in a variety of machines that would improve the lives of people across Azeroth. But who am I kidding? We're going to make explosives with it. BOOM!
