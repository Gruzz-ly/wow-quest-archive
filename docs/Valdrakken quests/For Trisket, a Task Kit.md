==Objectives==
Craft 2 Herbalist's Floral Baskets for [[Hideshaper Koruz]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Floral Basket]] (2)

==Description==
I have many valued customers, but [[Trisket]] is one of my favorites. Most recently he came to me because his herbalist's pouch has worn out.

I offered to make him a selection of baskets to replace his old pouch.

Would you help me with these tasks, <name>? Trisket would be appreciative.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Leatherworking Designs
}}

==Progress==
I think Trisket will be far happier with these sturdy baskets.

==Completion==
Thank you for the aid, <name>.

In return, take these designs. You can study them to improve your [[leatherworking]].
