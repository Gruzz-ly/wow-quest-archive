'''Using the Idol''' concludes the sixth day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Objectives==
Use the [[:Idol of Ohn'ahra]] to find 3 hidden gems, then speak with [[Preservationist Kathos]].
*[[Hidden Gem]] (3)

==Description==
Ah, the Idol of Ohn'ahra! Let's use it to find gems. I've hidden three gems nearby in [[Valdrakken]], all outside.

The idol will reveal the gems when you're near.

Come back when you've tracked them down.

==Progress==
Have you found the gems?

==Completion==
You have an eye for seeking lost objects, <name>. This skill will serve you well. 

Or should I say... serve US well.

==Notes==
Learn then use the [[Idol of Ohn'ahra]], then head outside to find a Hidden Gem at {{co|49.0|51.3|Valdrakken}} on the path a few yards from the bottom of the steps.

Don't mount up, but run around on foot to find another idol at {{co|55.2|64.7|Valdrakken}} behind a planter south of the bank.

The third gem is outside the Auction House at {{co|45.6|59.5|Valdrakken}} between the planter and the mail box.

Completing this quest is the "The Idol of Ohn'ahra" criterion of [[Whodunnit?]]
