==Objectives==
Gather 5 Giant Cores from the [[Mountain giant|mountain]], [[Ice giant|ice]], or [[molten giant]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]] for [[Temnaayu]] of the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]].
*[[Giant Core]] (5)

==Description==
There are various [[giant]]s within the Dragon Isles that are rumored to contain beautiful gems at their core. We normally don't hunt the creatures of the Isles for treasures, but these giants have caused quite a bit of havoc.

We may as well collect these gems in the process of clearing out the destructive giants.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Have you found any gems from within the giants?

==Completion==
These are indeed beautiful treasures.
