==Objectives==
Collect 8 Lava-Quenched Blades.
*[[Lava-Quenched Blade]] (8)

==Description==
I've heard [[Flavor lore|tales]] that the [[djaradin]] forge their blades with [[magic]] so hot that they can actually quench the metal with lava. Lava! It's like ice water compared to the heat their magic creates!

But I've never been able to verify it for myself. They aren't exactly peddling their wares at the market.

You smell like battle, though. Go and fetch some of their weapons for the [[Smith|blacksmiths]] back in [[Loamm]] and we'll see if the legends are true, eh?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Blacksmith's Writ
}}

==Progress==
I find the tales hard to believe, but then again... they do live in magma pits!

==Completion==
<Crubus tries to accept the blades from you, but quickly yanks his hands back and shakes them out.>

YEOW! How are you holding those so easily?!

Just--just set them down. I'll get some gloves.
