==Objectives==
Use the Watering Pot on 12 Enchanted Shrubs.
*Complete the events of "Enter the Dream"
*[[Enchanted Shrubs]] watered (12)
*[[Enchanted Watering Can]] (provided)

==Description==
Certain plants from the [[Emerald Dream]] could contain ingredients that would be helpful in our work here, but we need a lot of them, and I'm not hiring some herbalist to collect them.

I've enchanted a water pot to help solve the problem.

Travel to the Emerald Dream and use it on the plants I require. The plants should then deliver themselves.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Have you found the plants?

==Completion==
Excellent work, these plants certainly do spruce up the place!
