==Objectives==
Gather supplies for the [[Ruby Hatchling]]'s nest.
*[[Bolt of Ruby Cloth]] (2)
*[[Soft Peafowl Down]] (3)
*[[Lasztak's Thread Order]]
*[[Crimson Cushion]] placed

==Description==
I am looking forward to our [[red whelp]]. They are, after all, my specialty!

I have already spoken with [[Amella]], and I would like to handle the nest myself. Here is a list of materials. Bring them to me when you are done, and I can fashion the most comfortable cushion you have ever seen!

<Lasztak hands you a list of supplies.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
Red whelplings are my specialty.

==Completion==
How comfortable. A cushion worthy of Queen [[Alexstrasza]] herself!

==Notes==
Lasztak's Thread Order is at the Tailoring stall.
:{{Text|say|[[Threadfinder Pax]]|Make sure that thread gets to Lasztak safely. He was strangely specific with his request.}}

Bolts of Ruby Cloth are next to [[Mahra Treebender]] in the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]] in the [[Waking Shores]].

Soft Peafowl Downs drops from [[Academy Peafowl]]s and [[Iridescent Peafowl]]s in the [[Wild Cliffs]].

;Speaking with Lasztak
:{{Gossip|quest=|I have brought the materials.}}
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|Excellent! Now give me just a moment...}}
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|There! A cushion fit for Queen Alexstrasza herself!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Agapanthus]]|You are going to spoil the girl, Lasztak.}}
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|Nonsense! I'm... just treating her with the same care I give all of the whelps.}}

The adventurer receives the [[Crimson Cushion]]. Place it by the hatchling and turn in the quest.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|Thank you for your help today <name>. Please come back tomorrow. We will need all the help we can get.}}
