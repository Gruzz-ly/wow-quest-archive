==Objectives==
Play with the Emerald Hatchling.
*Tag started with [[Emerald Hatchling]]
*Hatchling chased to nest

==Description==
I have some worries about our new green friend. They are not sleeping as much as most [[green whelp]]s tend to do.

They seem to be having trouble sleeping. Why don't you get them up and moving around with a game of tag?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

That poor whelp. We must get them some rest soon.
