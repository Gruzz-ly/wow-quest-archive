'''A Curious Orb''' concludes the penultimate day of [[Secrets of Azeroth]] activities.

==Objectives==
Return the Orb of Rathmus to [[Tithris]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Orb of Rathmus]] (provided)

==Description==
<Tithris told you to return the orb to him in Valdrakken. He will pass it to [[Preservationist Kathos]].>

==Progress==
You got that orb for me? Kathos, I mean.

==Completion==
Perfect. I'm sure Kathos will be mighty glad to see this. She said the orb will help your investigations.

Why, there she is right now! Glad to see her back safe. I'll hand over the orb soon as I'm done with getting something from the back.

Thanks for the hard work, <name>!

==Notes==
This is the "A Curious Orb" criterion of [[Whodunnit?]]

On completion, [[Tithris]] walks to the [[Odd Statue]] and disappears. After a bit, [[Marinth]] replaces him. When asked about this, Marinth says:

{{book|content=
Welcome to the Roasted Ram, traveler. What can I get for you?

{{gossip|Where is Tithris?}}

Tithris had to step out for a moment. Not sure the reason. [[Kritha]] called me in to cover.
