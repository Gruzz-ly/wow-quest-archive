==Description==
It's no secret that the hornswogs in these lands have a fascination for gems, jewels, and all things shiny. Why, even the other day I found a very rare jewel in some hornswog droppings!

Well, it might not be the most appealing task, but it seems the hornswog have a habit of not only collecting, but also consuming valuables.

Were you able to find some gems?

Well these gems don't smell very delightful... We'll get to cleaning them up right away.
