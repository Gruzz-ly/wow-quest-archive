==Objectives==
Help [[Zalethgos]] overcome his insecurity about his eyesight.
*Visit [[Wurallie]] in the [[Waking Shores]]
*Defeat Wurallie in a [[Pet Battle]] with [[Pallibrius (pet)|Pallibrius]] on your team

==Description==
Since getting his glasses, Zalethgos has been relying heavily on his eyesight. Of course, this is normal, but he needs to remain flexible in case he loses them.

I believe it is time to turn out the lights. I think Wurallie has the perfect trick.

She believes she can teach Zalethgos to find victory even when he cannot use his eyes. Please join them in the Waking Shores.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

{{itembox||Zalethgos (pet)
|q2=10|Flightstones
}}

==Progress==
In order to grow into a well-rounded [[dragon]], Zalethgos must use everything at his disposal.

==Completion==
As proud as Zalethgos is of his glasses, knowing he can get along without them has given him new confidence.<br>
He may want to join you on your adventures in the future.

==Notes==
Head to Wurallie's camp. She is accompanied by a [[Midnight Terrorwing]].
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|Zalethgos, we are going to have [[Pallibrius]] fight Wurallie's [[bat]].}}
:{{Text|say|Zalethgos|But the bat is blind, how can it win if it can't see?}}
:{{Text|say|Wurallie|What would you do?}}
:{{Text|say|Zalethgos|I dunno.}}
:{{Text|say|Wurallie|Bats hunt in the dark when they can't see. How do they do it?}}
:{{Text|say|Zalethgos|I dunno?}}
:{{Text|say|Wurallie|Why don't you watch the match and see what they do?}}

;Speaking with Wurallie
:Please add Pallibrius to your pet team and we'll get started.

:This bat is weak to Magic attacks, which will be great for Pallibrius. This bat is really tough, though, and Pallibrius won't be able to win on his own.

:You'll want to have three pets on your team to win this fight, so choose them well.
