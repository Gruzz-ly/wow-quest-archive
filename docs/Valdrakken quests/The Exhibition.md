Craft a variety of gems for [[Tuluradormi]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Crafty Queen's Ruby]]
*[[Zen Mystic Sapphire]]
*[[Sensei's Sundered Onyx]]
*[[Energized Vibrant Emerald]]

==Description==
Oh jewelcrafter, how would you feel about a chance to practice your gemcutting?

I was going to put on a display of various cuts, and I suppose I could exhibit your gems as well, so long as you hurry. Submit nothing less than the highest quality for this demonstration.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Jeweler's Cuts

==Progress==
Are your gems worthy of display?

==Completion==
Very well, I suppose these will do.

Here, I made these cuts. You can study them to learn how to be a better jewelcrafter like me.

==Notes==
The gems must be gold quality. They can be traded or bought on Auction House.
