==Objectives==
Defeat Elementally Imbued creatures to collect Elemental Overflow while in an [[Elemental Storm]].
*[[Elemental Overflow]] collected (75)

==Description==
<Name>, the [[Primalists]] have managed to summon fierce Elemental Storms all across the [[Dragon Isles]].

When a storm is active go to it and slay the imbued creatures there.

Then collect the Elemental Overflow from the slain foes. Be aware that the stronger the foe, the more Elemental Overflow you will collect.

We must not let the Primalist [[elemental]] corruption grow unchecked.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

{{itembox||Storm Sigil
}}

==Progress==
Have the storms subsided? Have you brought me what I need?

==Completion==
This is but a drop in the bucket.

You would do well to continue to slay the imbued creatures and prevent them growing in strength.

Now I must return to my studies, <name>.
