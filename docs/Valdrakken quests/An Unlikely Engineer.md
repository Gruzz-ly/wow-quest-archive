==Objectives==
Collect 8 Whiteburr Morels for Nyla Bushtail in the Emerald Dream.
*[[Whiteburr Morel]] (8)

==Description==
I hear there is a legendary engineer in the Dream who crafts the most beautiful dream catchers.

This engineer, Nyla Bushtail, enjoys acorn-flavored morels and relies on them to fuel her work. Acorn-flavored mushrooms... certainly strange, but perhaps not unheard of.

There's a coastal area close to the Eye of Ysera where these morels grow abundantly. Do tread carefully around any wildlife in the area. If these morels are as tasty as I hear, they will be guarded greedily.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
<Nyla Bushtail, a fluffy, bright-eyed Fol'ya, accepts the morels with small paws. She tucks them away into a stash nearby, her movements fluid and tidy.

This must be the legendary engineer who loves acorn-flavored mushrooms. It all makes sense now.>

==Notes==
The quest item can be obtained without breaking [[Stealth (mechanic)|stealth effects]].
