==Objectives==
Find a way to collect the relic hidden inside the [[Sand-Lost Sanctum]], then return it to [[Nozdormu]] at the [[Seat of the Aspects]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*[[Ancient Timekeeper]] slain
*[[Anomalous Mote]] inspected
*[[Echo of Duty]]
*Return to Nozdormu in Valdrakken.

==Description==
My research team located a strange sanctum nearby. We were able to make out some writing on the outside of it--[[titan]] runes, to be exact--which we believe reference [[Aman'Thul]] the Highfather, leader of the [[titan]]s, in several places.

We tried to inspect more closely but must have triggered the sanctum's defenses. A massive [[Sand elemental|sand amalgam]] blocked us off and we narrowly made it out alive.

We aren't certain what it's protecting, but it must be important. Can you investigate?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Highfather's Cover
|Highfather's Guard
|Highfather's Legacy
|Highfather's Burden
}}

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|55|24}}
*10,250 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
This land is a sleeping giant. We ought to wake it with requisite caution.

==Completion==
<[[Nozdormu]] peers searchingly at the sphere as you hand it over. The sands inside brighten and swirl under his touch.>

I had thought this to be lost in this timeline. Nothing ever remains so, it seems.

==Notes==
Fly to the sanctum and kill the elemental:
:{{Text|bossemote|The Ancient Timekeeper disintegrates, leaving behind a strange orb...}}

Interact with the mote and enter the [[Temporal Overlook]]. Inside are [[Aerial Defense Core]]s. The character has the Perplexing Vision buff. Avoid the traps on the ground that give the Capricious Emanations debuff. Reaching 15 stacks teleports to the chamber's entrance. At the far end, open the [[Cache of the Timeless One]]. Head back to Valdrakken.

;Upon completion
:''Nozdormu reverts to his visage.''
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|When I was granted a portion of Aman'Thul's power, great secrets were revealed to me.}}
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|I captured that knowledge within this relic. An echo of what is, what has been, and what must always be.}}
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|I hid it in a corner of every timeline. So that I would always remember those words. Even after I...}}
:{{Text|emote|Nozdormu falls silent. After another moment, he clasps the sphere more tightly and turns away from you.}}

*Name: Anomaly of Aman'thul
;Description
There is a shrine to the titan Aman'thul north of here. According to my research, it was once utilized as a vault. Its remote location doubtless made it ideal for hiding away all manner of important relics. [[Nozdormu]] told my team to investigate, but there is a rather large and obstinate amalgam denying all entry. We are simple archivists and by no means equipped to deal with such a thing. Could you take care of it and have a look inside? Bring your findings back to Nozdormu.
