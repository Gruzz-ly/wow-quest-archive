==Objectives==
Speak with [[Soridormi]] in [[Tyrhold Reservoir]].

==Description==
Have you heard? [[Time Rifts|Time rifts]] are opening in Tyrhold Reservoir! It's a catastrophe! Folks have seen portals to other timeways randomly appearing. Now all kinds of fantastic creatures are swarming into [[Azeroth]].

Thank goodness for Soridormi. I heard she's getting everyone organized to make a stand. If you can offer any assistance, I'm sure she could use it.

They say she's still stationed in Tyrhold Reservoir. Do it for [[Valdrakken]]. Do it for Azeroth!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}

==Completion==
We're facing dangerous anomalies called "time rifts." We've been a little too reckless with our time travel. Now creatures from [[alternate timeways]] are entering our world, and we need to push them back.

The situation is quickly getting out of hand. We could use any help we can get. Do what I say when I say it, and we can all prevent the fabric of reality from unraveling.

You look like you can handle the challenge. Get out there and fight!
