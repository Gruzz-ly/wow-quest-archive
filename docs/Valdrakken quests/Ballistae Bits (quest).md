==Objectives==
Collect 10 Ballistae Bits.
*[[Ballistae Bits]] (10)

==Description==
Those [[djaradin]] might smell like brutes, but their [[engineering]] corps must be top notch to keep churning out [[ballista]]e strong enough to threaten a [[dragon]]!

Northeast of [[Loamm]] there's an ongoing scrap between them and some [[black dragon]]s. There ought to be lots of spare parts scattered around. Or slightly used, moderately on fire ones, anyway!

Haul them all back to Loamm! A little scorching won't stop our top minds from reverse niffeneering them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Engineering Details
}}

==Progress==
I wonder what they use for torsion?

==Completion==
Interesting, that's a lot more bone than I would have expected given the stress involved!

==Patch changes==
