==Objectives==
Collect 10 Zaqali Adornments.
*Complete the events of "Enter the Dream"
*[[Zaqali Adornments]] (10)

==Description==
Some of the local Jewelcrafters are looking to study examples of the [[Zaqali tribe]]s adornments.

Given they are currently attacking my home, we may take advantage of the situation.

I thought you might take them violently, yes?

Argonax waits once you have collected them.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
New knowledge can come from the strangest sources.

==Completion==
I was not expecting these so soon.

You do work fast, <name>.
