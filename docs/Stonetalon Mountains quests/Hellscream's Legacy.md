==Objectives==
Slay 10 Krom'gar Incinerators.
*[[Krom'gar Incinerator]] slain (10)

==Description==
Enter [[Stonetalon Mountains]] through [[Talondeep Pass]] and head towards the smoldering trees. Seek out the [[Krom'gar]] incinerators that are destroying the forest and slay as many as you can! Be warned, the incinerators are powerful [[orc]]s. Attacking them through conventional means will likely result in your death. Destroy the oil canisters on their backs and they will be devoured by flame!

Report to Sentinel Heliana at [[Windshear Mine]] should you succeed. She will have your new orders.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2,100 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]
* +250 reputation with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Completion==
With the Krom'gar incinerators dealt with, the forest may be allowed to regrow. Only time can heal the wounds left by the [[Horde]].
