==Objectives==
Report to [[Master Thal'darah]] at [[Thal'darah Overlook]] in [[Stonetalon Mountains]]. 

==Description==
There are dozens of students at [[Thal'darah Grove]]. Most of them have no means of defending themselves, ripe for the slaughter.

You must get word to Master Thal'darah of the Horde's plans. He will direct you in what you must do next.

[[Fiora Moonsoar]] has granted you the use of her fastest [[hippogryph]]. Take it now to Thal'darah Overlook! Don't look back, <name>! The Horde must be stopped!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 180 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
These are dire times, indeed, <name>. Our outpost in [[Stonetalon Peak]] has been overrun by fiendish creatures from the depths and the Horde seeks to destroy us. We need a hero, <name>; a soldier of the Alliance strong enough to guide us through these trying times.
