==Objectives==
Kill Queen Silith.
*[[Queen Silith]] Slain

== Description ==
<Captain Kosak coughs weakly.>

Was traveling up [[Webwinder Path]], coming from [[Northwatch Expedition Base Camp]] in the south. Ambushed. Not by [[Horde]]. Spiders. Big, ugly, hairy, nasty spiders.

Fought off dozens, maybe hundreds. Lost count. Overtaken by their queen. She took a chunk right out of me. Barely made it out alive. Might be dying.

More of my men coming. Must provide safe passage. Kill spider queen.

<Captain Kosak passes out.> 

== Progress ==
<Captain Kosak rambles incoherently.>

Ca... Call me Ko... Koko.

== Completion ==
<Captain Kosak forces a smile at you.>

Don't worry about me. Should be ok now that big hero killed the spider queen.

Can get reinforcements through safely now.
