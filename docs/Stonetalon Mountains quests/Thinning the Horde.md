==Objectives==
Slay any 20 soldiers of the [[Horde]] in [[Stonetalon Mountains]].
*Horde Soldier slain (20)

==Description==
The Horde's numbers swell as reinforcements from [[Ashenvale]] and [[Azshara]] arrive. There is no diplomacy to be had with the beasts. This is [[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream's]] [[Horde]] and Hellscream's Horde wants our blood! We will not sit idly by and allow them to take our land and kill our people. We must act!

We must thin the Horde! Consider it your daily responsibility.

Venture forth into Stonetalon Mountains and slay as many of the Horde as you are able. Let them know that the Alliance will not surrender!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||50}}

==Progress==
Show them that the Alliance is not to be trifled with, <name>!

==Completion==
Good. Their blood is on Hellscream's hands. Send enough of them back to [[Orgrimmar]] in a body bag and the populace of the Horde might react.

<Lord Fallowmere laughs.>

Who am I kidding? They're monsters!
