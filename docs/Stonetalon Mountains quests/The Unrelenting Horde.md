==Objectives==
Slay 12 Horde enemies at the [[Unearthed Grounds]].
*Horde at Unearthed Grounds Slain (12)

==Description==
While it is of utmost importance that you secure weapon crates immediately, we need the Unearthed Grounds to the east clear of Horde. If we are to open a supply line for our Grimtotem allies, we're going to need full access to the dig site.

Kill all Horde that you come across at the Unearthed Grounds, <name>. For the glory of the Alliance!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||25}}
*2300 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
I will call for the infantry to move in and clear up whatever might be left over. If only we had ten-thousand more like you, <name>!

==Progression==
{{NEBC, DR, Aparaje/Grimtotem Alliance}}
