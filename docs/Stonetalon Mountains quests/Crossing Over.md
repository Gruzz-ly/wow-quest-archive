==Objectives==
Enter the spirit realm and make contact with your spirit guide.
* Entered [[Veil|Spirit Realm]]
* Followed Spirit Guide
* First Spirit Seen
* Second Spirit Seen
* Third Spirit Seen
* Fourth Spirit Seen
* [[Spiritwalker's Hallowed Vessel]] (provided)

==Description==
We are ready to begin. 

You will be crossing into the spirit realm. Take caution, for it can be a place of both tranquility and danger.

Make contact with your spirit guide. There must be a reason it was in pain when it revealed itself to you.

When you are ready, raise this vessel to enter the spirit realm.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
On accept, you receive the [[Spiritwalker's Hallowed Vessel]].

Stand on a rug and use the [[Spiritwalker's Hallowed Vessel]] to start spirit walking.

Once you enter the spirit world, a message pops up:
:{{Text|emote|You hear animal cries in the distance}}

Head out of the tent and you spot an [[Ancient Swoop]] at the bridge. Follow it and you head to another Ancient Swoop. Keep following it until you reach an Ancient Swoop fighting [[Necrofiend]]s. 

Kill the Necrofiends and the hooded creature flees in the portal and the Ancient Swoop reveals itself to be [[Chieftain Hototo]].

:{{Text|Say|Chieftan Hototo|Oh, young one. How I wish we could have met under different circumstances.}}
:{{Text|Say|Chieftan Hototo|The spirit realm is out of balance. Dark spirits are crossing over into the mortal world.}}
:{{Text|Say|Chieftan Hototo|There will come a time for us to speak, but first you must warn our people of this threat.}}

Cheiftan Hototo sends you back into the Mortal world and you can go back to Spiritwalker Ussoh to turn in.

==Completion==
Your guide is a [[Tauren chieftain|chieftain]] ancestor? That is a great honor.

But if your guide was under attack, then I fear balance has been lost.
