==Objectives==
Report to [[Commander Walpole|Commander Thomas Walpole]] at [[Stonetalon Pass]] in [[Southern Barrens]]. 

==Description==
Pack up your gear, <name>, it's time to join up with the rest of the [[Northwatch Expeditionary Unit|Northwatch forces]] in Southern Barrens. Your first mission in Southern Barrens should be fairly straightforward.

Two days ago we received a distress signal from Commander Walpole. He and his battalion are pinned down in Stonetalon Pass, just outside of [[Honor's Stand]]. They've got [[Horde]] all over the place! Get there and help him out. I'll forward news of our alliance with the [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem]] to Northwatch command.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 180 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
You say the Grimtotem are no longer a threat? That's great, but we've got Horde all up our keesters!

==Progression==
{{NEBC, DR, Aparaje/Grimtotem Alliance}}
