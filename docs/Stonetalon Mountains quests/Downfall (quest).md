==Objectives==
Kill the Horde generals at Camp Aparaje and recover the Insignia of the Horde General.
*[[Insignia of the Horde General]]

==Description==
By the time that we received word that Hellscream had sent another [[mag'har orc]] to oversee the Horde troops in southern Stonetalon, it was too late. [[Camp Aparaje]] was burned to the ground and all [[Grimtotem]] in the area incinerated.

Now the [[Horde]] have four of their most fearsome generals commanding the battle for [[Greatwood Vale]], including the mag'har, [[General Glubgok]].

You must travel to the ruins of Camp Aparaje, south of here, and kill the generals. We stop the Horde NOW! Return to me with their mark!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||80}}
*2650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are the generals dead?

==Completion==
<Grundig crushes the insignia in his massive fist.>

Yes, ally, you have done it! It will take Hellscream weeks to recover from this blow. Southern Stonetalon belongs to the Grimtotem... and the Alliance, of course.

==Notes==
The generals will say the following if one of them is killed:
:{{text|yell|[[General Vaurajo]]|Brothers, [[General Vol'tar|Vol'tar]] has fallen!}}
:{{text|yell|[[General Salaman]]|I shall not suffer the same fate as Vaurajo! Die!}}
:{{text|yell|[[General Glubgok]]|Face the fury of the [[Mag'har (faction)|mag'har]]!}}

==Progression==
{{NEBC, DR, Aparaje/Grimtotem Alliance}}
