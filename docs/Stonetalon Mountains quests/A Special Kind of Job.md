==Objectives==
Report to {{npc||Force Commander Valen}} at [[Northwatch Expedition Base Camp]] in [[Stonetalon Mountains]]. 

== Description ==
You've done an admirable job down here, <name>. Force Commander Valen has taken notice and requested that you see him immediately. He's got a special mission lined up for you - one that'll hopefully put a cold stop on the Horde's incursion into Stonetalon.

== Completion ==
I knew that you'd be a special snowflake when I first set my eyes upon you, <name>. So special, in fact, that I'd trust no one else here with what I'm about to ask of you.

==Progression==
