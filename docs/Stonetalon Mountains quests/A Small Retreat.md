==Objectives==
Meet with [[Spiritwalker Ussoh]] at [[Sun Rock Retreat]] in [[Stonetalon Mountains]].

==Description==
I believe your guide was delivering a warning. The unrest within the [[Veil|spirit realm]] may be even more dire than first feared.

We must cross over at once, from a place with a strong bond to the spirit realm.

In ages past, tauren made pilgrimages to Sun Rock Retreat to engage in such a ritual. It is said that long ago, [[An'she]] himself kissed the mountain where the retreat now stands.

Meet me there and we will begin the crossing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Shall we begin?

==Notes==
Take a flying mount and fly to [[Stonetalon Mountains]] and then head to [[Sun Rock Retreat]] and meet up with [[Spiritwalker Ussoh]] and turn in the quest.

==Progression==
