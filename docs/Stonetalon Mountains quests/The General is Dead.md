==Objectives==
Speak to [[Overlord Krom'gar]] at [[Krom'gar Fortress]] in [[Stonetalon Mountains]]. 

== Description ==
Perhaps if you spoke to Overlord Krom'gar, <name>. Maybe he would listen to what you had to say? You are a Champion in his army, after all. You saw everything. Please help us, <name>. We simply wish to be left alone - in peace.

Talk to Overlord Krom'gar and try to help him see that we did not mean for any of this to happen. 

==Completion==
WHAT? My General has been killed by the tauren? This is treason! HIGH TREASON! They will pay for this grevious error.
