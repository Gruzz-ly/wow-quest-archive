==Objectives==
Kill 8 Warsong Wing Commanders.
*[[Warsong Wing Commander]] slain (8)

==Description==
The skies are swarming with heavily armored orcs on the backs of even more heavily armored wind riders. Our best efforts to bring them down have thus far proven fruitless. Our arrows usually just bounce off of those foul creatures. If we do happen to take one down the orcs deploy their goblin parachutes and safely land on the ground below.

I need you to use Gnombus's sniper cannons and blow up the Warsong wind riders and then blow up the parachuting orcs.

The only way down is in a body bag.

==Progress==
We can't get across the pass safely without the wind riders being taken out first.

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. The [[gnome technology]], while somewhat obnoxious, is highly effective. We should now have a clear path to Windshear Hold.

==Trivia==
What [[Kalen Trueshot]] asked the players to do is likely a war crime in real life, as it is against Article 42, Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions ({{ref web |url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/f6c8b9fee14a77fdc125641e0052b079 |title=Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), 8 June 1977. |accessdate=2017-10-15}}) to attack "person parachuting from an aircraft in distress". Though one can argue [[Warsong Wing Commander]]s are airborne troops and thus not protected under the conventions.
