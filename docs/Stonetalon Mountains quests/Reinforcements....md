==Objectives==
Use Subjugator Devo's Whip to Subdue 6 Boulderslide Kobolds.
*Boulderslide Kobold subdued (6)
*[[Subjugator Devo's Whip]] (provided)

==Description==
It would appear as if we are running out of big, stupid orcs to send at the enemy. This is a problem. Thankfully, I may have a solution.

Take this whip and head west to [[Boulderslide Cavern]]. Within the cave you will find a filthy nest of kobolds. Use my whip to subdue the beasts. Once subdued they will do whatever we ask them to do.

Return to me when you have amassed a sizable army of kobolds.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||25}}

==Progress==
Do not dilly-dally, <name>.

==Completion==
In times of crisis, a desperate act may be all that is needed to secure victory. Sending a swarm of kobolds at the enemy may be the edge that we need to win. 

==Notes==
This quest should be done alongside [[Da Voodoo: Resonite Crystal]].

Any of the kobolds in [[Boulderslide Cavern]] will count. To get to the cavern, go back to [[Webwinder Path]] and take a left at the crossroad into [[Boulderslide Ravine]]. The cavern is at the back and to the right.

If the kobold is subdued, they say one of the following:
*{{text|say|Subdued Kobold|Please no whip me! Me help Horde!}}
*{{text|say|Subdued Kobold|Hurts! Stop!}}<br />
If the whip fails, the kobold attacks and says one of the following:
*{{text|say|Boulderslide <Kobold>|Whip make me angry!}}
*{{text|say|Boulderslide <Kobold>|Me shove whip down face!}}
*{{text|say|Boulderslide <Kobold>|ME SO ANGRY!}}
*{{text|say|Boulderslide <Kobold>|Me make you eat whip!}}
*{{text|say|Boulderslide <Kobold>|NO! ME NO HELP HORDE!}}

==Trivia==
This quest and the name of the quest giver are a reference to the song "Whip It", by Devo.
