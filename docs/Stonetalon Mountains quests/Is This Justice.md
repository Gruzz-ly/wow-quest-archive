==Objectives==
Defend yourself.
*Defend yourself.

== Description ==
He was a good boy, <name>. Young, loving. He would have never killed any of the young druids. They were his friends! No... Not Orthus.

The General must be called to answer for this crime. I will have justice! 

==Completion==
You saw with your own eyes, <name>. General Grebo attacked us!

<Masha cries.>

Now what will we do? Surely the Warchief will have us all executed for treason.
