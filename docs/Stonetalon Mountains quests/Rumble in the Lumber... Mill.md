==Objectives==
Kill [[Warlord Roktrog]] and free Huntress Illiona by using [[Huntress Illiona's Cage Key]]. 
*[[Huntress Illiona]] Freed

==Description==
Prepare yourself, <name>! The Warlord comes! Kill him and take his key. Use the key to release me.

Should we make it out of here, report the following to [[Lord Fallowmere]] at [[Windshear Hold]]:

The [[Horde]] has aborted their plans to destroy [[Windshear Hold]] due to the efforts of one of our heroes. They now plan to move the bomb to [[Battlescar Valley]] and drop it on our armies battling the Horde at that location.

They must be stopped!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Thwarter's Boots
|Windshear Axe
|Strategy Guide
|Thwarter's Footguards
}}

You will also receive:
* 1,750 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
A hero thwarted their plans to destroy Windshear Hold, eh? That hero was you, <name>. You are the pride of the Alliance!

It seems that you have bought us a little bit of time. I must plan for the battle that lies ahead of us. Seek out the other inhabitants of Windshear Hold and lend them your assistance. I will call for you when I am ready to initiate our defensive strategy.
