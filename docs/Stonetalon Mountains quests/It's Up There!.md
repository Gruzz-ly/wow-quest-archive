==Objectives==
Steal the Krom'gar Log Book. 
*[[Krom'gar Log Book]]

==Description==
Listen, I've been tracking [[The Bomb|this bomb]] since you rescued me in [[Ashenvale]]. Whatever they're doing with it is going to happen real soon.

At the top of the large oil rig is a control room. Inside that control room you'll find a Krom'gar log book. That log book is the key to where this bomb is heading. Get up there and get the log book! Bring it back here and I'll decipher it for you. 

==Progress==
Did you recover the log book?

==Completion==
OH NO! They plan to "test" the bomb at [[Thal'darah Grove]]! That's the school for young [[druid]]s located in the heart of [[Battlescar Valley]]. You've got to return to [[Scout Commander Barus|Barus]] with this information! [[Master Thal'darah]] must be warned!
