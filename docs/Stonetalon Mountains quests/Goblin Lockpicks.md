==Objectives==
*[[Venture Co. Work Order]]

==Progress==
You said you're breaking into Shadowfang...alone? You've got some guts!

I can hook you up with explosives to get past the gate, but I'll need a work order to make it look legit on the books. An employee around here's likely carrying one. Probably someone who does a lot of tinkering or building.

==Completion==
Nice job, <name>. I figure that was a cakewalk for someone in your line of work.

As promised, here's the goods.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Breaching Charge]]

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 1.15.0|note=Added.}}
