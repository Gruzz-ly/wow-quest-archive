==Objectives==
Return to [[Huntress Jalin]] at [[Stardust Spire]] in [[Ashenvale]].

==Description==
Huntress Jalin will be pleased to know that the way to Windshear Hold is now clear. Please return to Stardust Spire and inform her of your success. She will most assuredly have more work for you now that our path is clear.

Thank you and good luck, friend.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Stardust Belt
|Hippogryph Down Belt
|Clear Path Boots
|Stardust Waistcord
}}

You will also receive:
* 180 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]
* +10 reputation with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Completion==
With the airways clear our hippogryphs will be able to move into Stonetalon freely. Well done, <name>!

Now on to more pressing matters.

What you witnessed at Trueshot Point was a small sampling of the decimation left in the wake of Hellscream's legacy. As Warchief of the Horde, Hellscream has declared Kalimdor as the Horde's sovereign territory. All that would oppose the Horde are destroyed.

We are Kalimdor's last line of defense. Should we fall, Kalimdor will also fall. The Horde must be stopped!

==Notes==
Although classified as a [[Stonetalon Mountains]] quest, its destination is in fact in [[Ashenvale]].
