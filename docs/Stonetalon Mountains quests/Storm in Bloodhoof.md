==Objectives==
Travel to Bloodhoof Village in [[Mulgore]] and stop the [[Ghost|spirit]] attack.
*Travel to [[Bloodhoof Village]]
*Save the people of Bloodhoof Village

==Description==
This is worse than I feared.

The people of Bloodhoof Village are in grave danger. Even the brave young tauren who train there are woefully unprepared for the danger that is coming.

Do what you can to stop this threat. I will go to [[Thunder Bluff]] to warn the [[Baine Bloodhoof|High Chieftain]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You heard the horn, <name>! We are in dire need of your help.

==Notes==
On accept, The Spiritwalkers stand up.

:{{Text|Say|Spiritwalker Ussoh|Isahi. Akule. We must make haste to Thunder Bluff. <Name> will aid Bloodhoof Village.}}

The trio heads out. You must head to Bloodhoof Village. Once you arrive, it was filled with Necrofiends and Malicious Spirits who have been popping out of Spirit Portals and trapping the Kodos.

To fill up the bar,
*kill [[Malicious Spirit (Mulgore)|Malicious Spirits]] and [[Necrofiend]]s
*interact with [[Spirit Portal]]s, [[Trapped Kodo]], and [[Bloodhoof Villager]]s.

Once you fill that bar to 100%, Baine Bloodhoof gives everyone a distress call.
:{{Text|Say|Baine Bloodhoof|Braves, prepare for battle! Thunder Bluff is under attack!}}

Head to Thunder Bluff and meet up with Baine Bloodhoof.
:{{Text|Yell|Baine Bloodhoof|To me! This spirit is the one who leads them!}}
