==Objectives==
Deliver the Alliance Attack Plans to [[Overlord Krom'gar]] at [[Krom'gar Fortress]] in [[Stonetalon Mountains]]. 
*[[Alliance Attack Plans]] ''(provided)''

== Description ==
Our main base of operations in Stonetalon Mountains is Krom'gar Fortress. It is from there that Overlord Krom'gar oversees all Horde military activity in the region. Krom'gar reports everything that happens directly to the [[Garrosh Hellscream|Warchief]].

The attack plans you brought back detail an assault that's supposed to take place against Krom'gar Fortress soon. Take the plans and head to the fortress. Give them to the Overlord.

So long, <name>. Truly, Hellscream's eyes are upon you. 

== Reward ==
The following spell will be cast on you:

[[File:achievement pvp h 03.png|32px]] [[Krom'gar Sergeant]]

You will also receive: {{cost||40}}

==Progress==
What is the meaning of this interruption? Why does this grunt stand before Overlord Krom'gar?

==Completion==
<Overlord Krom'gar takes the plans from you.>

Hmm. Perhaps this grunt is more then <he/she> would appear. Perhaps this grunt is in actuality a sergeant.

Look now upon Krom'gar Sergeant <name>, soldiers. <He/She> has come to serve warning of a cowardly Alliance attack. An attack that we will CRUSH!
