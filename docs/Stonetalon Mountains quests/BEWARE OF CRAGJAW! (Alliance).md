==Objectives==
Kill [[Cragjaw]] and take Cragjaw's Huge Tooth.
*[[Cragjaw's Huge Tooth]]

== Description ==
By order of people not wanting to get themselves devoured whole by a really huge fish, [[Cragpool Lake]] is OFF-LIMITS! Someone decided to up and put a huge, [[dwarf]]-eating fish in the lake.

It is strongly recommended that you stay out, however, if you are the heroic type and have a few friends around, do us all a favor and kill the damned thing! Maybe I can get some fishing done then, eh?

If you manage to actually do it, meet me back at [[Windshear Hold]] for a reward.
