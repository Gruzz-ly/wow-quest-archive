==Objectives==
Kill 12 Raging Earth Elementals. 
*(12) [[Raging Earth Elemental]] Slain

== Description ==
Dontrag can explain it better than me. Basically, we're stuck between a rock and a hard place. Can't do anything down here due to all of the things that can kill us and can't go back to the base due to all of the things that can kill us - you know?

Perhaps if we worked together we might be able to get this mess sorted out. How about you get started by clearing out some of these elementals that have apparently killed everything in the mine, ok?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||22}}

== Progress ==
Those elementals aren't going to kill themselves, buddy.

== Completion ==
Get the parts, kill the elementals and rescue the peons... We get all of that done and we're as good as promoted!

==Progression==
{{Krom'gar Fortress Horde}}
