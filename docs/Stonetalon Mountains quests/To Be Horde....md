<poem>
{{text|say|Overlord Krom'gar|Watch now, Cliffwalker, as this battle comes to its glorious conclusion.}}
{{text|say|High Chieftain Cliffwalker|You are about to cross a terrible threshold, Krom'gar. May the Earth Mother have mercy on your soul.}}
''Krom'gar releases the balloon holding the goblin bomb and sends it towards Thal'darah Grove. On arrival, the balloon drops the bomb directly on it, obliterating the entire area, leaving a large crater behind.''
{{text|say|Overlord Krom'gar|Look upon the world, Cliffwalker, and see the might of the Horde!}}
''A portal from Orgrimmar suddenly forms nearby. [[Garrosh Hellscream]] and his guards emerge from the portal.
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|What have you done, Krom'gar?}}
''Krom'gar bows before Garrosh.''
{{text|say|Overlord Krom'gar|Warchief! I... I was carrying out your command!}}
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|My command?}}
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Was my command to murder innocents, Krom'gar?}}
{{text|say|Overlord Krom'gar|Warchief... Sir... I...}}
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Am I a murderer, Krom'gar?}}
{{text|say|Overlord Krom'gar|No, Warchief!}}
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Then I ask you again: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!}}
''Krom'gar begins to cower before Garrosh.''
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|I sent you into Stonetalon Mountains with an army. Your orders were to secure this land for the Horde.}}
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Instead, you laid waste to the land. Murdered innocents. Children even...}}
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|I spent a very long time in Northrend, Krom'gar. I learned much about the Horde in that time.}}
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|While there, a [[Varok Saurfang|wise old war hero]] told me something that I would carry with me forever...}}
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|"Honor," Krom'gar, "No matter how dire the battle... never forsake it."}}
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Overlord Krom'gar, you have disgraced the Horde.}}
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|You have brought shame to us as a people.}}
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|By my right as Warchief, I hereby relieve you of your duty.}}
''Garrosh picks up Krom'gar by the throat and lifts him over the edge of the lift bridge.''
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|YOU ARE DISMISSED.}}
''Garrosh drops Krom'gar off the edge, sending him to his death. He then turns toward the hero.''
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|And you, <race>!}}
{{text|say|High Chieftain Cliffwalker|Wait, Warchief! Please! <Name> was the hero responsible for uncovering this corruption. <He/She> tried to stop Krom'gar!}}
{{text|say|High Chieftain Cliffwalker|Have mercy, Warchief.}}
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Mercy... Your wife and child were murdered. Your kin wiped out. Your home burned to the ground.}}
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Mercy... Chieftain, on this day I learn from you.}}
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|<Name>, Krom'gar's army is no more. Your rank no longer has meaning. If you wish to truly help the Horde, your considerable power could be used in Desolace or in the Southern Barrens.}}
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|The choice is yours to make.}}
{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Let honor guide you, <name>. Do not forget that Hellscream's eyes are always upon you.}}
