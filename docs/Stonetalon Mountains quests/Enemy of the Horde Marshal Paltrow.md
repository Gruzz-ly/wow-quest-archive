==Objectives==
Kill Marshal Paltrow.
*[[Marshal Paltrow]] Slain

== Description ==
My scouts have tracked the cause of this latest fiasco to one man: Marshal Paltrow. He commands the Northwatch forward camp that has established itself in [[Windshear Valley]], west of here. Take him out and you remove a powerful [[Alliance]] field commander from the equation.

Paltrow must die, <name>.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||22}}

== Progress ==
Is Paltrow dead?

== Completion ==
Did you find any [[Orders from Base Camp|suspicious documents]] at Paltrow's camp? Perhaps on his rotting corpse? Any insight into the Alliance's attack patterns would be extremely helpful in the battle for Stonetalon. 

== Notes ==
This quest is easily done alongside [[Ashes to Ashes (Stonetalon Mountains)]].

Loot Paltrow's corpse to find [[Orders from Base Camp]], which starts a followup quest.

==Progression==
{{Krom'gar Fortress Horde}}
