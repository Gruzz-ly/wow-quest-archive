Find Elder Sareth'na's Sketch Book.

== Description ==
The world is unraveling around us, <name>. Old enemies seek to destroy us from one end, while ancient forces close in on the other.

<Elder Sareth'na sighs.>

I have seen better days - brighter days, and I long for them...

Across Stonetalon Peak lies the ruins of our old outpost - now overrun with darkness. If you happen to go that way, could you search for my sketch book? It holds many happy memories. I would reward you well for its return.
