==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Huntress Jalin}} at [[Stardust Spire]] at the border between [[Ashenvale]] and the [[Stonetalon Mountains]].

==Description==
By order of his royal highness, {{NPC||King Varian Wrynn}}, all able-bodied citizens of the [[Alliance]] are to report to Huntress Jalin at Stardust Spire in Ashenvale.

The [[Horde|Horde's]] forces are poised to push into Stonetalon and they must be opposed! You can reach Stardust Spire by traveling to the southern part of Ashenvale Forest, near the border with Stonetalon.

For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 

==Completion==
The Horde has bored a giant pass into the mountains, and we have few enough sentinels to spare. We have to find a way to stop them!
