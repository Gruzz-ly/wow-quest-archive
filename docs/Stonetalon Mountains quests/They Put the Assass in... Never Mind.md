==Objectives==
Kill 12 Krom'gar Assassins.
*[[Krom'gar Assassin]] Slain (12)
*[[Infrared Heat Detection Device]] (provided)

==Description==
Ah, the Explorers' League - such a profound group of morons. Not only do we have tauren ghosts up our butts, the Explorers' League has also managed to open up a backdoor to the primary Horde base in Stonetalon, Krom'gar Fortress.

Now we've got Krom'gar assassins silently executing everyone in the [[Deep Reaches|mine]].

I need you to head in there and clean house.

I almost forgot to give you these goggles. Put them on immediately. They'll make all the stealthed assassins in the mine plainly visible.

==Completion==
<The Gnomecorder buzzes and whirs.>

Hey, this thing on?

<You hear a tapping sound.>

Anybody there?
