==Objectives==
Use the [[Goblin Pump Controller (item)]] to destroy 4 [[Goblin]] [[Oil Pump]]s.
*Oil Pump Destroyed (4)

==Description==
Goblins... What would [[Azeroth|this world]] be without goblins? I'll tell you what: CLEAN!

Those filthy little scum suckers have planted their [[Oil refinery|oil pumps]] all over the lake with the hope of extracting every last drop of oil that exists in [[Stonetalon Mountains|Stonetalon]]. At each oil pump they've stationed an oil pump controller whose sole job it is to watch the pump and make sure nothing goes wrong.

Something is about to go wrong.

Take out the goblin pump controllers and take their pump controls. Use 'em to overload the pumps!
