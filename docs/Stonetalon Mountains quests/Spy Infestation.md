==Objectives==
Kill 8 Alliance Spies. Use Jibbly's Gas Bomb to uncloak the spies!
*[[Alliance Spy]] slain (8)
*[[Jibbly's Gas Bomb]] (provided)

==Description==
We've got another problem, <name>. Alliance spies are all over the place! You haven't seen any? That's because they're invisible! Cloaked! I have a solution, but I need muscle like you to go out there and follow through with my plan.

Use this gas bomb on the cloaked spies and it will reveal them. Once revealed, send them back to their maker.

You'll know a cloaked spy by the effect they leave in the air. Look closely!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Crawling Amulet|Infested Breastplate|Bow of Invisible Aim}}

You will also receive: {{cost||55}}

==Progress==
Have you dealt with the spy infestation?

==Completion==
And they called me crazy. I knew this place was crawling with spies. Poop too.

==Notes==
Look around Sludgewerks for sparkles in the air. The cloaked spies also appear on the minimap when using [[Track Hidden]]. Throw the bomb to reveal the Alliance spies and make them attackable.

When uncloaked by the bomb, the spies will start attacking any nearby [[Goblin Pump Controller]]s or [[Lumbering Oaf (Stonetalon Mountains)|Lumbering Oafs]].
