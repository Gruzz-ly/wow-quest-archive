==Objectives==
Take the Krom'gar Wagon to the [[Fold]] in [[Stonetalon Mountains]].
*Krom'gar Wagon taken to the Fold

== Description ==
You're in [[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]]'s army now, <name>, and in Hellscream's army we kick butt and take names. Gone are the days of our people starving in the streets of [[Orgrimmar]] as we sign treaties with elves. We take what we need now. [[Kalimdor]] belongs to the [[Horde]]!

The [[Alliance]] attempts to stop our expansion every chance they get. Unsatisfied with owning most of the [[Eastern Kingdoms]], those pig-lickers want it all!

[[Overlord Krom'gar]] has called for more troops in Stonetalon. Get on the caravan west of here and go!

== Reward ==
The following spell will be cast on you:

[[File:achievement pvp h 02.png|32px]] [[Krom'gar Grunt]]

==Completion==
While you remain in Stonetalon and fight as a Krom'gar soldier you will remain suited up! Am I clear? DO you hear me, grunt? If I see you without Hellscream's beloved tabard I will put my foot so far up your backside that you'll be spitting up laces.

==Notes==
The wagon is located at {{co|48.5|66.4|Ashenvale}}. Jump on, and enjoy the ride alongside [[Scout Utvoch]], [[Sergeant Dontrag]], and a couple of [[Horde Infantry]]:
:{{text|say|Krom'gar Caravan Hauler|Hold on tight, it's gonna be a bumpy ride. Be on the lookout for night elves!}}
:{{text|say|Scout Utvoch|Few things I like more than killing Alliance.}}
:{{text|say|Sergeant Dontrag|What could an orc as depraved as you enjoy more than killing Alliance, Utvoch?}}
:{{text|say|Scout Utvoch|You know I can't resist tauren women, Donty. They're my one weakness...}}
:{{text|say|Sergeant Dontrag|You are a sick, sick orc, Ut.}}
:''The Horde Infantry members laugh. The wagon passes into Stonetalon through [[Talondeep Pass]]. It turns left and halts at The Fold.''
:{{text|say|Krom'gar Caravan Hauler|Got another shipment of fresh meat for you, Saurboz. Let's hope these ones don't end up as corpses on my wagon like the last battalion.}}
:{{text|say|Saurboz|More fodder for the Horde war machine.}}
:{{text|say|Saurboz|Looks like we've got some of Rockrain's soldiers here. Dontrag, Utvoch, we're gonna need your expertise over at Krom'gar Fortress.}}
:{{text|say|Sergeant Dontrag|Yes, sir! Let's go Ut.}}
:''Dontrag and Utvoch jump off the wagon and run off.''
:{{text|say|Saurboz|As for the rest of you grunts, suit up! We've got some killin' to do.}}

==Progression==
{{Ashenvale that leads to Stonetalon Horde}}
