==Objectives==
Take the Illegible Orc Letter to [[Boog the "Gear Whisperer"]] at [[Windshear Mine]] in [[Stonetalon Mountains]].
* [[Translated Orc Letter]] (provided)

==Description==
The letter is actually an order from [[High Command#Horde High Command|Horde high command]]. Someone named Overlord Krom'gar has issued a "strip job" on this mine in order to obtain something called azure iron flake. Presumably this flake is obtained from breaking down the ore.

It gets worse. They plan to mix the azure flake with the explosives sitting inside the huge bomb outside and blow up Windshear Hold.

We don't have a moment to lose, <name>! Take this translated copy of the letter and return to Boog! He'll know what to do next.

==Rewards==
*1600 [[XP]]
*+150 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]
*+150 reputation with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
Well? What's it say?

==Completion==
<Beads of sweat roll down Boog's overly large forehead as he reads the translated letter.>

This is bad. Really, really bad. You have to warn Lord Fallowmere at Windshear Hold.

What in the... It's MOVING! The goblin balloon is taking off! We're too late!
