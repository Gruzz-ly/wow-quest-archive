==Objectives==
Take the Illegible Orc Letter to [[Minx]] inside the Windshear Mine in [[Stonetalon Mountains]].
* [[Illegible Orc Letter]] (provided)

==Description==
The good news is that Minx is fluent in orcish and she's nearby. Head back into the mine and find her. She's probably deeper inside, standing around being useless.

Don't forget the parchment!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1600 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]
*+150 reputation with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
What have you got there?

==Completion==
<Minx takes the letter from you and begins to read it.>

Uh oh...

<Minx smells the parchment.>

Disgusting!

<Minx folds the paper in half and looks at you.>

The good news is that this isn't toilet paper. The bad news is that the ink on this paper is a mixture of kodo poop and blood. That's not the worst of it, though...
