==Objectives==
Find [[Orthus Cliffwalker|Orthus]] at [[Thal'darah Grove]] in [[Stonetalon Mountains]]. 

== Description ==
At the heart of [[Battlescar Valley]] stands an ancient tree - a tree that has withstood the force of ages and has served as a place of peace and learning for generations. My kin have studied druidism at the grove, alongside the [[Night elf|night elves]], for as long as I can recall. Now I am to believe that the tree holds within it an Alliance weapon of mass destruction?

[[Overlord Krom'gar|Krom'gar]] is wrong and I will prove it!

I have sent my son, Orthus, to Thal'darah Grove in search of this weapon. Go there now and meet him. 

==Completion==
Orthus is dead. He is clutching something in his hand.

==Notes==
Orthus is at the top of the building inside the tree. The helpless druids outside will not attack.
