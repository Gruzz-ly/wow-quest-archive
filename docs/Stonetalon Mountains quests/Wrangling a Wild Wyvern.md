==Objectives==
Follow [[Jixo Madrocket]], and watch him tame a [[Wyvern]].

==Description==
With the wand made, there's only one thing left to do. I'm gonna tame myself a wyvern!

You should come with, <name>. You'll have a front row seat to my newest act!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Wyvern Taming Wand]]
*[[Rune of Kill Command]]

==Completion==
Let me tell ya, <name>, that fall hurt even worse than it looked. I'll be fine, but I don't think Wyvern wrangling is in the cards for old Jixo.

Maybe I should just stick to the hits, y'know? Stunts like jumpin' over a row of twenty gnomes on a chopper. Folks eat that stuff up.

Take the wand. I've got no use for it anymore. And have this too; a little something extra for all the trouble.
