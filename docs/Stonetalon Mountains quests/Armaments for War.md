==Objectives==
Collect 10 Alliance Weapon Crates. 
*[[Alliance Weapon Crate]] (10)

== Description ==
I am going to need to put you in harm's way once more, <name>. To the east you will find a mineral rich excavation site that was recently overrun by the Horde. At that site are crates of our weaponry, scattered about all over the place. The Horde has only recently taken over, so it is unlikely that they've found all of our supplies.

Get in there and get our Grimtotem friends some weapons!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Northwatch Amulet

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
Have you gathered the armaments of war? 

== Completion ==
This should be enough to supply a hundred Grimtotem! Now to present the weaponry to their chieftain.
