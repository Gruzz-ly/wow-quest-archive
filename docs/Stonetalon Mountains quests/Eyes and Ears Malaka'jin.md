==Objectives==
Report to [[Witch Doctor Jin'Zil]] at [[Malaka'jin]] in [[Stonetalon Mountains]]. 

== Description ==
[[Honor's Stand]] has been lost. The Horde's grip on the Barrens shattered along with the land itself. I now receive reports that we are at risk of losing Malaka'jin to a concerted attack by the [[Alliance]] and the [[Grimtotem]]. If Malaka'jin falls, half of Stonetalon falls with it!

You have proven yourself a capable soldier of the Horde. Will you be my eyes and ears at Malaka'jin? Witch Doctor Jin'Zil awaits your arrival. 

Malaka'jin is located far to the south.

==Completion==
I see that [[Overlord Krom'gar|Krom'gar]] has sent his best!

Good, we have much work to do. The filth that is the Alliance has entered into a treaty with the Grimtotem. Now we fend off attacks from both forces.

We are spread thin across the [[Greatwood Vale]] and will soon fall between the concentrated efforts of our enemies. There is only one hope: VOODOO!

==Notes==
To complete this quest, you must go on foot to Malaka'jin: Head left after exiting [[Krom'gar Fortress]], and go through [[Windshear Valley]] where the Alliance camps are. Head south and you will end up on [[Webwinder Path]]. Keep following the road south. Eventually you will come to a Horde blockade on the road. Here you can speak to [[Darn Talongrip]] to pick up [[The Queen and Her Court]], which takes place nearby. Once ready to move on, continue east on the road and you will come to [[Greatwood Vale]]. At the first intersection, turn right and go into the settlement with the totem pole and Horde banner out front.
