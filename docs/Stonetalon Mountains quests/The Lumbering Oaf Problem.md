==Objectives==
Kill 10 Lumbering Oafs.
*[[Lumbering Oaf (Stonetalon Mountains)|Lumbering Oaf]] slain (10)

==Description==
Ever seen a [[hobgoblin]]? They're another vile goblin creation. Take a goblin, make it even uglier, fatter, bigger and stupider and you have a hobgoblin. Add to all of that a nasty mean streak and we've got a problem.

These lumbering oafs wander the [[Sludgewerks]] and [[Mirkfallon Lake]], acting as muscle to the goblins.

Get out there and thin 'em out. Permanently.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2300 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*+250 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
Slowly, but surely, we pick away at the Horde's numbers. They won't have a leg to stand on when this war really opens up. 

==Progression==
{{The Sludgewerks Alliance}}

==Patch Changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
