Obtain 5 [[Horde Cage Key]]s to free 5 Captured Huntresses.
*[[Captured Huntress]] Freed (5)

==Description==
Yesterday morning I dispatched a squadron of huntresses on a mission into [[Windshear Crag]] to obtain information about [[Horde]] operations in [[Stonetalon Mountains|Stonetalon]]. Field intelligence reports that they have all been captured, including their squad leader, [[Huntress Illiona]].

Head east into Windshear Crag and slay the [[Krom'gar Infantry|Krom'gar infantry]] that occupy the crag and take from them their keys to unlock the Horde cages holding our sisters.

Do your best to locate Illiona once you've freed the huntresses.

==Rewards==
You will receive:

*2100 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==

==Completion==
We don't have much time. To get me out of here you are going to have to take out [[Warlord Roktrog]]. He holds the key to this prison.
