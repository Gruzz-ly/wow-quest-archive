==Objectives==
Take the Krom'gar Hot Air Balloon to the [[Sludgewerks]] in [[Stonetalon Mountains]]. 
*Krom'gar Hot Air Balloon safely escorted to the Sludgewerks

== Description ==
Champion, we have acquired a new target. Our scouts in [[Battlescar Valley]] report that the [[Night elf|night elves]] are preparing their own weapon of mass destruction and hiding it within an ancient tree. They will never be given the chance to use their weapon against us.

You are to escort the bomb to the Sludgewerks for refueling and then to [[Cliffwalker Post]], from which we will detonate the bomb and kill all of our enemies.

Go now, <name>. Report to [[Jibbly Rakit]] when you arrive at the Sludgewerks.

==Completion==
Krom'gar has sent his champion! Well you haven't got a thing to worry about, Champion. We'll get the balloon all fueled up in no time. How about you lend a hand around here while you wait?

== Notes ==
The bomb is on a floating balloon next to the inn at [[Krom'gar Fortress]]. Right-click the balloon to get quest credit and a free ride to the [[Sludgewerks]].
