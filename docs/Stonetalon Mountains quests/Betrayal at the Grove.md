==Objectives==
Take the Krom'gar General's Insignia back to [[High Chieftain Cliffwalker]] at [[Cliffwalker Post]] in [[Stonetalon Mountains]].
*[[Krom'gar General's Insignia]] ''(provided)''

== Description ==
Druid corpses litter the room. Something seems amiss, as you see no signs of a struggle. Bloody drag marks lead in from the doorway.

You pry Orthus' death grip open to find something disturbing in his hand: a Krom'gar General's insignia.

Take the Krom'gar General's insignia back to High Chieftain Cliffwalker.

==Progress==
He... My child is dead?

==Completion==
<High Chieftain Cliffwalker takes the insignia from you.>

<High Chieftain Cliffwalker cries out in anger.>

== Notes ==
When you return, Cliffwalker Post will have changed. The [[Cliffwalker Brave]]s will be gone, replaced by [[Krom'gar Enforcer]]s. [[General Grebo]] has moved inside a nearby hut.

As you turn in the quest, [[Masha Cliffwalker]] cries.
