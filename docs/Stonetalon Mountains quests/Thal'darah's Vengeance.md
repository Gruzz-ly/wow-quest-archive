==Objectives==
Kill 20 Horde soldiers and destroy 3 Krom'gar Demolishers in Battlescar Valley.
*Horde Soldier Slain (20)
*[[Krom'gar Demolisher]] destroyed (3)

== Description ==
We must attempt to establish communication with [[Farwatcher's Glen|Farwatcher Glen]], to the south. Our Darnassian glaive throwers are at your disposal, <name>. Use them to cut a swath through the encroaching Horde forces and clear a path to Farwatcher Glen.

I only hope we're not too late to save the Glen. Should Farwatcher Glen be intact, find Hierophant Malyk and inform him of our status.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

== Completion ==
We witnessed the detonation of the bomb. Terrible, terrible destruction... Farwatcher Glen, for better or for worse, is still intact. Unfortunately we've nowhere to run.

==Notes==
*Eligible mobs are [[Krom'gar Berserker]]s, [[Krom'gar Logger]]s, [[Krom'gar Peon]]s, [[Krom'gar Witch Doctor]]s, and [[Krom'gar Warrior]]s.
