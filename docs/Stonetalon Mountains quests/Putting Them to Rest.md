==Objectives==
Recover 8 Sentinel's Glaives.
*[[Sentinel's Glaive]] (8)

==Description==
As the Horde were marching upon Stonetalon, I noticed that some of the sentinels had fallen ill. Not long after, they started acting strangely. When the first tentacle burst from the ground the ill sentinels began attacking us. We lost the outpost shortly after...

The sentinels in the peak are now nothing more than shells - husks for something far more sinister. I want you to put the sentinels to rest and retrieve their glaives. Each glaive returned can identify a fallen sister.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||50}}
*2350
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
Recover the sentinel's glaives, <name>. Each glaive is unique to a sentinel.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Each glaive has the name of the sentinel it belonged to imprinted upon its blade. We can now send word to their families and put their souls to rest.
