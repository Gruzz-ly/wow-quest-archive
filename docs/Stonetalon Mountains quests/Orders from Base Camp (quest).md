==Objectives==
Deliver the Orders from Base Camp to [[Overlord Krom'gar]] at [[Krom'gar Fortress]] in [[Stonetalon Mountains]].
*[[Orders from Base Camp]] (provided)

== Description ==
[[Marshal Paltrow|Paltrow]], establish a foothold in [[Windshear Valley]]. A strong ground assault is vital to our campaign! When we make our assault against Krom'gar, your men will provide the chaos and confusion that the gnome [[flying machine]]s will need to get close enough to bomb the orc fortress.

The flying machines will detonate the Krom'gar bomb while it's sitting in their base, taking out the entire fortress in the process.

Burn after reading.

-[[Force Commander Valen]]

[[Northwatch Expedition Base Camp]]

== Progress ==
More gnomes?

== Completion ==
Gnomish flying machines? Our anti-air cannons are still not functional! We will be sitting ducks.

I require time to plan... to think...

The [[hot air balloon]] and its payload cannot remain at Krom'gar Fortress. I must make arrangements to move the balloon to another location. Our plans to destroy [[Windshear Hold]] with it are foiled.

==Progression==
