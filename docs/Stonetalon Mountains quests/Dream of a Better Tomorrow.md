==Objectives==
Recover the BD-816 War Apparatus, Mechanized Fire, Mechanized Ice and Mechanized Air.
*[[BD-816 War Apparatus]]
*[[Mechanized Fire]]
*[[Mechanized Ice]]
*[[Mechanized Air]]

== Description ==
Mr. D is sick, <mister/miss>. Won't you help him? All you have to do is find his hat and batteries and he'll be all better. I'd go get them myself, but I can't leave Mr. D alone!

His hat was stolen by the meanies in the Venture Co. over at the water wheel and his batteries are hidden around Windshear Crag. You'll just have to look real hard for those!

Would you kindly bring Mr. D's stuff back so he can teach those baddies in the Alliance a lesson? 

== Progress ==
Mr. D is so sad. We need to make him happy! 

== Completion ==
<Clarissa claps excitedly.>

Mr. D you're gonna be ok! Hooray!

<Clarissa expertly places all of the parts you collected into Large Daddy.>

Oh, Mr. D! I knew it!

==Notes==
The quests [[Ashes to Ashes (Stonetalon Mountains)]] and [[Enemy of the Horde: Marshal Paltrow]] can be done alongside this.

*The Mechanized Air is inside [[Ziz Fizziks]]'s former hut {{co|59.9|64.2|Stonetalon Mountains}} in [[Windshear Valley]], through the Alliance camps.
*The Mechanized Fire is on top of a large shredder {{co|63|56.7|Stonetalon Mountains}} in [[Windshear Crag]].
*The Mechanized Ice is on top of a tower {{co|66.2|50|Stonetalon Mountains}} next to [[Cragpool Lake]].
*The "hat" is at the water mill {{co|63|45.6|Stonetalon Mountains}} above [[Cragpool Lake]]. There's a way up at the east side of the lake.

Be sure to pick up [[BEWARE OF CRAGJAW! (Horde)]] while at Cragpool Lake.
