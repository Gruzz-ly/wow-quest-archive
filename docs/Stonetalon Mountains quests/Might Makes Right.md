==Objectives==
Meet [[Overlord Krom'gar]] at [[Cliffwalker Post]] in [[Stonetalon Mountains]].

==Description==
You have done well to report this crime. The perpetrators of this heinous act will be punished. There will be blood. I will need a new General now that [[General Grebo|Grebo]] is dead. You shall take his place. Meet me at Cliffwalker Post, General. Together we will end this nonsense. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Krom'gar General]]

==Completion==
The traitorous tauren will now stand by as we destroy his precious grove and burn his village to the ground!

==Notes==
When you return to Cliffwalker Post, it will have changed. The buildings will be on fire, and the [[Krom'gar Enforcer]]s will be wandering around on wolfback. [[Masha Cliffwalker]]'s corpse will be lying near the center area. [[Overlord Krom'gar]] and [[High Chieftain Cliffwalker]] will be near the elevators, looking towards [[Thal'darah Grove]]; High Chieftain Cliffwalker will be kneeling.
