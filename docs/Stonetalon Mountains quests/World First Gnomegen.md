==Objectives==
Collect 1 Blazing Heart of Fire.
*[[Blazing Heart of Fire]]

==Description==
Good day, citizen, allow me to introduce myself. I am [[Salsbury the "Help"|Salsbury]], soon to be the world's first gnomegen. [[Hierophant Malyk|Malyk]] has assured me that as soon as my work here is complete he will grant me the gift of the [[worgen]].

So with the introduction out of the way, I've a request!

Within the [[Charred Vale]], south of here, roam newly created [[fire elemental]]s. I desperately need a rare blazing heart of fire from one of the fiends. Get it for me and you bring me one step closer to becoming a gnomegen!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||25}}

==Progress==
Have you recovered the blazing heart of fire?

==Completion==
Excellent. This will allow me to finish my last task and hopefully gain the form of the [[wolf]]!
