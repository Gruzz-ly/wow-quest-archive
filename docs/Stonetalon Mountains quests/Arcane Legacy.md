==Objectives==
Use the Highborne Prison to bind 5 [[Enraged Highborne Spirit|Highborne Spirits]].
*Highborne Spirit Bound (5)
*[[Highborne Prison]] (provided)

==Description==
The rage of the elements has unearthed a hidden [[Highborne]] city in the heart of [[Stonetalon Mountains]].

Directly southwest of here, through [[Sishir Canyon]], you will find the [[Ruins of Eldre'thar]]. Within the ruins lie treasures untouched by mortals for ten thousand years!

Take this device and use it on the Highborne ghosts that inhabit the ruins. It will... put their souls to rest and also collect valuable data which I may peruse at a later date. 

==Progress==
You are wasting time, <name>.

==Completion==
I assure you, simpleton, the spirits you captured are at rest. Do not let their protests move you.

==Notes==
Throw the [[Highborne Prison]] at any of the Highborne. The Highborne will die and become either a bound spirit or an enraged spirit. Only the bound spirits will count towards your quest total. The enraged spirits will be hostile and automatically aggro.

On getting a bound spirit:
*{{text|say|Bound Highborne Spirit|I... I have no control. Bound by your infernal contraption.}}
*{{text|say|Bound Highborne Spirit|You will regret your actions!}}
*{{text|say|Bound Highborne Spirit|I... What sorcery is this?}}

==Progression==
{{Ruins of Eldre'thar and Webwinder Hollow Alliance}}
