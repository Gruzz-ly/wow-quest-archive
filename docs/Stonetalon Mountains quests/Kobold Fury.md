==Objectives==
Use the Kobold War Horn near the Horde Banner at the Unearthed Grounds to unleash the Kobold Army!
*Kobold Army Unleashed!
*[[Kobold War Horn]] (provided)

==Description==
We now command the kobold armies of Stonetalon! It almost sounds impressive. Almost.

<Devo sighs.>

The [[Northwatch Expedition Base Camp|Alliance base camp]] north of here is tightly guarded. It is nigh impregnable, save for the entry point by the [[Unearthed Grounds]], northeast of here. Take this kobold war horn and head towards the Unearthed Grounds. Enter from the east, <name>! Once there, head west until you arrive at the location I have marked upon your map. Use the horn there to unleash kobold fury upon the Alliance! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Kobold-Wrangler Leggings|Unearthed Cloak|Devo's Handaxe}}

==Progress==
On my mark, unleash kobold hell!

==Completion==
<Devo laughs.>

Fascinating tale, friend. It would seem that our newfound kobold allies might be somewhat useful after all!

==Notes==
The quest [[Jin'Zil's Blessing]] can be completed on the way there and back.

To get to the banner, exit Malaka'jin and go into [[Greatwood Vale]]. Go northeast, past [[Camp Aparaje]] and [[Grimtotem Post]]. At {{co|79|81|Stonetalon Mountains}} there is a path up the hillside, leading to the [[Unearthed Grounds]]. Go through the Unearthed Grounds. At the western side will be the large sparkling Horde Banner {{co|74|78|Stonetalon Mountains}}.

On using the horn, many kobolds appear:
:{{text|yell|Subdued Kobold|KILL PINK SKINS! KILL! KILL!}}
:''The kobolds run forward and begin attacking the Northwatch Infantry.''
