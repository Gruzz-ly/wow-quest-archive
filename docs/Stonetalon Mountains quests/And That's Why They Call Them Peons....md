==Objectives==
Rescue 10 Frightened Peons.
*(10) [[Frightened Peon]]s rescued

== Description ==
These two are USELESS! When they first arrived I thought we were saved. Not so! Instead, [[Sergeant Dontrag|Dontrag]] and [[Scout Utvoch|Utvoch]] took one look at the mine and concocted some idiotic plan that involved standing here until... until we all died, I guess.

You don't look nearly as useless. How about you lend a hand, friend? I've got dozens of peons, scared out of their gourds, hiding in the [[Deep Reaches]]. Find them and get them out!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||22}}

== Progress ==
Did you find my peons?

== Completion ==
I knew it! You are a hero! If I have anything to do with it, you'll be promoted to legionnaire! 

==Progression==
{{Krom'gar Fortress Horde}}
