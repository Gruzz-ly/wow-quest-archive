==Objectives==
Kill 12 Darnassian Scouts.
*[[Darnassian Scout (Stonetalon)|Darnassian Scout]] slain (12)
*[[Infrared Heat Focals (Stonetalon)]] (provided)

==Description==
There are great dangers in the woods south of here. They are crawling with Darnassian scouts - assassins sent from [[Darnassus]] to kill us. Perhaps we can turn the tables on them, eh?

When I was marooned on the [[Lost Isles]] a goblin gave me these infrared heat focals. They allow the wearer to see heat signatures of certain creatures. Take the focals and use them while in the woods to the south. They will allow you to easily spot the scouts. Kill as many of them as you can! For the Horde!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||20}}

==Progress==
Are the woods clear of assassins?

==Completion==
Well done, <sister / brother>! Now they will know that they cannot sneak up on the Horde! 

==Notes==
This quest can be easily done alongside [[The Missing Blastgineer]].

The elves are visible without the goggles, but will not appear until very close. The goggles make them sparkle visibly from far away, and cause them to be tracked on your minimap.

==Progression==
{{Ashenvale that leads to Stonetalon Horde}}
