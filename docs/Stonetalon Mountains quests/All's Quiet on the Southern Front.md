== Trivia ==
The quest name is a reference to the 1928 novel '''''All Quiet on the Western Front''''' (German: ''Im Westen nichts Neues'') by '''Erich Maria Remarque'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Maria_Remarque], which chronicles the service of a German soldier based on Remarque at the French front in World War I.
