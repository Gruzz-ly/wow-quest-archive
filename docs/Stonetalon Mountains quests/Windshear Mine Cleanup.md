==Objectives==
Kill 6 Windshear Overseers.
*[[Windshear Overseer]] (6)

==Description==
The [[Horde]] has overrun [[Windshear Mine]]. I'm not sure what these [[orc]]s are hauling out of here or why they're here, but I know that it can't be good. Get in that mine and take out the management. Without [[goblin]] overseers, these peons will be even more worthless.

While you're inside, keep your eyes peeled for any [[Illegible Orc Letter|other information]] about the Horde operation in the mines.

Good luck!

{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]
* +250 reputation with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
I hate goblins.

==Completion==
Nice job, I could hear their shrill screams from out here. You've turned the whole place on its head!

Did you happen to find any other information about the mining operation?
