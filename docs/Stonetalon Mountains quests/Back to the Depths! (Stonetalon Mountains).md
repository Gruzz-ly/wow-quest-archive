==Objectives==
Kill Harbinger Aph'lass and 10 Invading Tentacles.
* [[Harbinger Aph'lass]] slain
* Invading Tentacle slain (10)

==Description==
Tendrils are bursting forth from the earth and terrorizing [[Stonetalon Peak]]. My sentinels are hardly making a dent in their numbers.

I suspect that there is a force at the heart of Stonetalon Peak that controls the tendrils. Perhaps if we can put a stop to that force, the tendrils will return to the depths from whence they came!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||25}}
* 2,350 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
I'm afraid that the death of Harbinger Aph'lass has not ceased the tendril attacks. You've done all that you can, <name>, and for that I thank you.

==Notes==
*Eligible mobs are [[Invading Tendril]]s and [[Invading Crusher]]s.

==Progression==
{{Thal'darah Grove Alliance}}

==Patch changes==
