==Objectives==
Report to Chief Blastgineer Bombgutz at Krom'gar Fortress in Stonetalon Mountains. 

== Description ==
We must prepare for the impending attack. I will have our soldiers prepare the bomb for transport. I want you to report to Chief Blastgineer Bombgutz. She has been working to fix our anti-air cannons, but has thus far failed. Make sure that she is properly motivated to repair our guns, <name>.

==Completion==
Properly motivated? Wha... what does that mean? Listen, Sergeant, I have a built in mechanism for survival called self-interest. That is, it's in my best interest to NOT DIE. With that said, there's no fixing these guns without the right materials.
