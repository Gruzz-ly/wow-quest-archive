*[[Mechanized Ice]]
*[[Mechanized Air]]

== Description ==
Mr. P is sick, <mister/miss>. Won't you help him? All you have to do is find his hat and batteries and he'll be all better. I'd go get them myself, but I can't leave Mr. P alone!

His hat was stolen by the meanies in the [[Venture Co.]] over at the water wheel and his batteries are hidden around [[Windshear Crag]]. You'll just have to look real hard for those!

Would you kindly bring Mr. P's stuff back so he can teach those baddies in the [[Horde]] a lesson?

== Progress ==
Mr. P is so sad. We need to make him happy!

== Completion ==
<Alice claps excitedly.>

Mr. P you're gonna be ok! Hooray!

<Alice expertly places all of the parts you collected into Big Papa.>

Oh, Mr. P! I knew it!
