==Objectives==
Use the Krom'gar Demolisher to destroy 5 Darnassian Glaive Throwers and any 20 Alliance soldiers in [[Battlescar Valley]]. 
*[[Darnassian Glaive Thrower]] destroyed (5)
*Alliance Soldier in Battlescar Valley slain (20)

== Description ==
I will allow this old fool time to plead his case. He has assured me that he will bring back proof that the night elves do not harbor a weapon of mass destruction. We shall see.

While we await this proof, you will assist our army in the valley. We have prepared a large number of siege tanks for this purpose. Our demolishers are poised for attack.

Take the elevator down to the base of the outpost and take control of a Krom'gar demolisher. Use it to lay waste to our enemies in Battlescar Valley.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Slay them all!

==Completion==
You possess quite a talent for destruction, <name>. Whatever Alliance remain after your rampage across Battlescar Valley will be dealt with by the bomb.

==Notes==
Kill: [[Darnassian Glaive Thrower]]s, [[Night Elf Mage]]s, [[Stonetalon Warder]]s, [[Battlescar Ancient]]s, and [[Draenei Paladin]]s.
