==Objectives==
Use the Krom'gar Flamethrower to destroy 8 Northwatch Tents.
*Northwatch Tent incinerated (8)
*[[Krom'gar Flame Thrower]] (provided)

== Description ==
The Alliance have grown bold. Just west of here, in [[Windshear Valley]], [[Northwatch]] troops have set up camp. No doubt they are preparing for the assault you warned us of, <name>. They will never get the chance!

Take this flame thrower. It is the same flame thrower my incinerators use to burn our enemies out of hiding in the forests. Use it to destroy the Northwatch tents. Leave only ashes in your wake!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Flamethrower's Gloves
|Vest of Ashes
|Overlord's Favor
|Tunic of Ashes
}}

You will also receive:
* 2,150 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Burn them to the ground!

==Completion==
Lok'tar! Alliance pigs!

<Overlord Krom'gar spits on the ground.>

Enjoy the victory for it shall be short lived. Your bravery has given us more time to prepare, nothing more.

==Notes==
The quest [[Enemy of the Horde: Marshal Paltrow]] can be easily done alongside this quest.

You must wait for the full cast time of the flamethrowers, or you will not get credit.
