==Objectives==
Speak to Kalen Trueshot at Trueshot Point in Stonetalon Mountains. 

== Description ==
So these night elves send out a desperate call for help to us, goes something like this:

<Gnombus changes the pitch of his voice to sound like a woman.>

"Please come help us! The big, mean Horde has goblins! Oh, we can't handle goblins! They pull our hair and make us cry!"

Right, anyway, so here we are.

The first thing I did was upgrade their aerial defenses with some of my new sniper guns. Problem is, they don't use guns. Do yourself a favor and lend 'em a hand, eh? Find 'em south of here. 

== Completion ==
<Kalen sighs.>

We use guns just fine, friend. CANNONS, on the other hand, I take issue with...

==Notes==
Do NOT head to Stonetalon Mountains via the wide [[Talondeep Pass]]! There is no way from down there to the cliff overlook where Trueshot Point is. Instead, use a separate, narrow path from Stardust Spire upwards. It starts just behind the night elf gate.

==Progression==
{{Windshear Crag/Windshear Mine Alliance}}
