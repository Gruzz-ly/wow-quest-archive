==Objectives==
Use Salsbury's Rocket Pack to ascend the Charred Vale's volcano.
*Ascend the [[Charred Vale]]
*[[Salsbury's Rocket Pack]] (provided)

==Description==
I am told that before the great upheaval the Charred Vale was a valley, closed off to the sea. One has merely to look to the south to see that the Charred Vale is no longer a valley and in fact has become an area of great volcanic activity.

{{npc||Salsbury the "Help"||Salsbury}} here has configured a device that will allow us to ascend the volcano. Use it to get to the top and assess the goings on.

I will keep in touch with this Gnomecorder device, which Salsbury has so kindly gifted upon me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Completion==
<The Gnomecorder crackles with energy.>

I say, are you there, <name>? It would appear that you are in the center of a dragon's lair. 

==Progression==
{{The Charred Vale Alliance}}
