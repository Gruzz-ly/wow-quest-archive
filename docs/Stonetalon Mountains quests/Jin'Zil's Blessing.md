==Objectives==
Use Jin'Zil's Voodoo Stick to infuse 12 Krom'gar Marauders with Voodoo.
*[[Krom'gar Marauder]] empowered (12)
*[[Jin'Zil's Voodoo Stick]] ''(provided)''

== Description ==
Ah, it is done! Now to test it out.

Travel to the main point of conflict within [[Greatwood Vale]] and use my voodoo stick on the Krom'gar marauders battling the Grimtotem. My voodoo magic should renew their vigor and allow them to crush our enemies!

Go now, <name>!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

==Progress==
Hurry, <name>!

==Completion==
Victory, at last! Though it stands to reason that without a stable supply line this victory will be short lived. Enjoy it while it lasts, <name>.

== Notes ==
The rod must be channeled for the entire cast time, and taking damage will break the cast. Stand far enough back that the Grimtotem will not catch you with their AoE attacks.

==Progression==
{{Webwinder Hollow Horde}}
