==Objectives==
Bring a Hypnotic Crystal and a Gnarled Wand of Wild Magic to [[Jixo Madrocket]] in the {{C|Stonetalon Mountains}}.
* [[Hypnotic Crystal]]
* [[Gnarled Wand of Wild Magic]]

==Description==
You seen those [[Pridewing Wyvern]]s flying around? I bet folks would pay good [[money]] to see me do a flip on one of those things!

They're an ornery bunch, though. Can't get one tame enough to ride; to say nothing of high-flying stunts.

I've heard you can make a special wand to soothe 'em. Could probably even do it myself. All I'd need is a Hypnotic Crystal, and a Gnarled Wand of Wild Magic.

Now, I'm not entirely sure about where to get these, but we can talk details later.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||18}}

==Progress==
Any luck with the supplies?

==Completion==
Nice work! Now it's time for a little field test.

==Notes==
*[[Hypnotic Crystal]] drops from [[Mutanus the Devourer]] in the [[Wailing Caverns]].
*[[Gnarled Wand of Wild Magic]] is created by using [[Wild Magic Essence]] on a [[Greater Magic Wand]].

On completion:
:{{text|say|Jixo Madrocket|Alright. Just gotta put it all together and...}}
:{{text|say|Jixo Madrocket|Voila! Let's go test this puppy out!}}
