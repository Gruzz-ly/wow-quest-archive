==Objectives==
Destroy 15 [[Gnomish Flying Machine (Stonetalon)|Gnomish Flying Machines]] or [[Gnomish Bomber (Stonetalon)|Bombers]] and 25 [[Gnome Wing Commander]]s. 
*Gnomish Flying Machine slain (15)
*Gnome Wing Commander slain (25)

== Description ==
There's no time left. Here they come! Take control of a heavy gun and shoot the gnomes out of the sky! If that bomb takes too many hits it will blow, taking us all with it!

Defend the base, <name>! You're our only hope!

If we somehow make it out of this in one piece, report to Overlord Krom'gar.

== Reward ==
The following spell will be cast on you:

[[File:achievement pvp h 08.png|32px]] [[Krom'gar Legionnaire]]

You will also receive: {{cost||65}}

== Progress ==
Our enemies surround us!

==Completion==
I have never seen such an act of bravery. You saved the base, sergeant - or should I say legionnaire! Lok'tar!

== Notes ==
While using a Goblin Heavy Gun, shoot the planes to destroy them. Every time a plane is slain Gnome Wing Commanders will appear and slowly parachute down.

==Progression==
