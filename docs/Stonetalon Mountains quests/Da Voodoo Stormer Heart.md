==Objectives==
Obtain a [[Cliff Stormer]] Heart.
*[[Stormer Heart]]

== Description ==
With voodoo, our troops might have a chance at beating back the Grimtotem assault. With that said, I need several ingredients if I am to invoke black magic.

The first ingredient on my list is a heart from a cliff stormer. The beasts have nearly been hunted to extinction, but a few still exist around these parts. Find one and recover its beating heart!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||25}}

==Progress==
I need the cliff stormer heart.

==Completion==
Excellent. Once I have everything I need I will mix it all together and unleash the voodoo! Woe unto our enemies!

==Progression==
