==Objectives==
Kill any 6 Pridewing Wyvern.
*[[Pridewing Wyvern]] slain (6)

==Description==
We have a little problem...

<Jibbly points to the large turds covering the base.>

We built the [[Sludgewerks]] near a [[wyvern]] habitat. Now our initial blueprints for the Sludgewerks were drawn up so as not to disturb the wyvern habitat as the beasts are apparently sacred to [[tauren]] and [[orc]]s. Do you know what's sacred to me? Not getting pooped on, that's what!

Between you, me and the wall, the wyvern must die!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||55}}
*3,050 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Please help. The guards are getting a little uppity.

==Completion==
I sure hope you didn't miss any. I don't think I can take much more of this!

==Notes== 
The wyvern are in [[Windshear Heights]], which can be reached by going southeast out of the Sludgewerks and to the left. Kill [[Pridewing Wyvern]]s, [[Pridewing Consort]]s, or [[Pridewing Patriarch]]s.

==Progression==
{{The Sludgewerks Horde}}
