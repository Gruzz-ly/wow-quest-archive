I am - perhaps for the first time in my life - at a loss for words.

I am really not sure where Clarissa even came from...

== Notes ==
During this quest, [[Large Daddy]] (Mr. D) is used as a vehicle. Speak to [[Clarissa]] to return to the vehicle if you leave.

Clarissa will join you on the quest as a companion: 
:{{text|whisper|Clarissa|Hooray, Mr. D! You're back! Do you remember how to shoot all your guns? Why don't you take a minute to learn how to fight again! Just in case.}}
While fighting:
:{{text|whisper|Clarissa|YAY!}}
:{{text|whisper|Clarissa|Get 'em, Mr. D!}}
:{{text|whisper|Clarissa|Make 'em sorry for hurting you, Mr. D!}}
:{{text|whisper|Clarissa|BAD, BAD ALLIANCE!}}
:{{text|whisper|Clarissa|Hurt 'em some more! MORE!}}
:{{text|whisper|Clarissa|Break their bones!}}
