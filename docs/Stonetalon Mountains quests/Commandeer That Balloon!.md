==Objectives==
Ride the Krom'gar Hot Air Balloon and attempt to stop it from destroying [[Windshear Hold]].
*[[Krom'gar Hot Air Balloon]] Diverted

==Description==
We don't have a moment to lose, <name>. You're going to have to commandeer that hot air balloon and stop it!

How? I have no idea! We don't have time to argue details! Grab onto that rope ladder and climb up! Just start banging on stuff once you're inside!

If you somehow manage to stop the balloon and survive, report to Lord Fallowmere at Windshear Hold in the west.

Good luck, we're all counting on you. Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to RUN FOR MY LIFE!

==Completion==
Amazing story, lad. I'd have never believed you had I not seen it with my own eyes. You did enough damage to that balloon to make those fiends pull back! Alas, the threat is far from over. We have only delayed the attack. There is much work to do if we are to stop the Horde from destroying Stonetalon!

==Rewards==
