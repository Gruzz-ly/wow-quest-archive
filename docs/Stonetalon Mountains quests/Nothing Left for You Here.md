==Objectives==
Speak to [[Furien]] at [[Tethris Aran]] in [[Desolace]].

== Description ==
There is nothing left for you here, <name>. As for me, I must lay [[Masha Cliffwalker|Masha]]'s body to rest. Once I have done that I will go to the bombing site and begin the process of regrowth. Perhaps one day a new grove will bloom - a grove infused with the spirit of my child and the fallen night elf youths.

If you wish to travel to Desolace, I hear word of a blood elf named Furien seeking adventuring partners. Perhaps you should seek him out.

Farewell, friend, I will never forget you. 

== Completion ==
<Furien groans.>
