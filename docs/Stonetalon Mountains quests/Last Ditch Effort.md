==Objectives==
Assist [[Master Thal'darah]] in search of any [[druid]]s left behind at [[Thal'darah Grove]]. 
*Last Ditch Effort Made

==Description==
The [[Horde]] have signaled a retreat. Look now, they fall back from the field of battle - portends of disaster.

We must make one final descent into Thal'darah Grove. I could not live with myself if any of our young druids were left behind.

Assist me, hero. I will take the reins. You search for any druids that might be left behind.

We will go when you are ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Completion==
Do you know why the Horde destroys? The Horde destroys because they cannot comprehend beauty. They fear it and that which they fear they must destroy. Why else would they destroy Thal'darah Grove?

Together, we will make them understand. They will know that what they do comes at a great cost.
