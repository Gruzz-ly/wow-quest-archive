==Objectives==
Collect 10 Deepmoss Venom Sacs. 
*[[Deepmoss Venom Sac]] (10)

== Description ==
Poisoned travelers are becoming a common occurrence around [[Windshear Hold]]. Why just the other day a [[Northwatch Captain Kosak|Northwatch Captain]] fell prey to the spiders of the [[Webwinder Hollow]]. He would have died to the poison had it not been for my anti-venom. Sadly my stock of anti-venom is almost completely depleted.

If you're heading south towards Webwinder Hollow, would you kindly recover Deepmoss venom sacs for me? You should be able to acquire them from Deepmoss spiders. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||22}}

== Progress ==
Have you recovered the venom sacs I requested? 

== Completion ==
This will keep us stocked on anti-venom for the foreseeable future. Thank you, <name>! 

==Progression==
