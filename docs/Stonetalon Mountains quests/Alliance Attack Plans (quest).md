==Objectives==
Recover the Alliance Attack Plans from [[Huntress Davinia]].
*[[Alliance Attack Plans]]

== Description ==
<You pry the note loose from Fuzzwhistle's hand.>

They're onto us! They know all about the bomb. Planning an attack on [[Krom'gar Fortress]]! I think they sent a search party after me. Won't go out like a chump. They'll get a fight.

I think I hear them coming now! Their leader is a high elf huntress named Davinia. She spoke of attack plans. Avenge me by killing her and getting those plans!

[[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]]'s eyes are upon you... 

==Progress==
Did you find Fuzzwhistle?

==Completion==
Damn shame... He was a good goblin.

<Saurboz shakes his fist.>

As for you, <name>, you've done well. These attack plans will help us prepare. I want you to deliver the plans to Overlord Krom'gar personally! There's sure to be a promotion in it for you.
