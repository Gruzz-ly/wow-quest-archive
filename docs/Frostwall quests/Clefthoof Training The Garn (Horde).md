==Objectives==
Defeat Maimclaw while riding your Clefthoof-In-Training.
*[[Maimclaw]] Killed
*[[Icehoof-In-Training Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
The last test for your mount will pit it against one of the great terrors of this land.

The garn. Wolves as black as night, and twice the size of a normal wolf, they can tear an orc apart in mere moments. The beasts here wisely fear them.

There is a lone garn that calls Nagrand its home. Take your clefthoof, mount up, and bring it down. If the two of you survive, your clefthoof will truly be ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (20)
*[[Trained Icehoof]]

==Completion==
The clefthoof is now fully-trained and prepared to be your mount. Take care of the beast, I hope to see the two of you again shortly.
