==Objectives==
Ask [[Sage Paluna]] about the [[:Black Claw of Sethe]].
*Talk to Sage Paluna

==Description==
Behind me, as ye can probably see, is a giant black claw. We found it while we were out hunting new beasts to tame. The animals seem to be quite afraid of it, perhaps the beast it belonged to used to hunt them.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|11|60}}

==Completion==
This claw has a strange effect on the mounts we have. If you have it with you when training a mount-in-training, your mount will be MUCH more vulnerable.

Should you find the training not rough enough, you might want to challenge yourself further by carrying it with you.

I think besting the beasts of Draenor with it would certainly be worthy of a reward.
