==Objectives==
Locate the Thunderlord sage [[Windreader Argoram|Argoram]] in [[Magnarok]].
* Find Argoram
* Search Argoram for Clues

==Description==
In [[Frostfire Ridge]], a [[Thunderlord clan (alternate universe)|Thunderlord]] sage by the name of Argoram seems to have uncovered the whereabouts of a storied weapon, known to the orcs as [[Gronnsbane]]. He was last spotted headed into Magnarok. Find him and see if he can lead you to this relic.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3|85}}

==Completion==
It looks like the local [[goren]] had made short work of Argoram.

Fortunately, his findings are still intact in his journal.

==Notes==
Windreader Argoram's corpse is found at {{coords|70.1|26.9|Frostfire Ridge}}. Search his corpse:

:The Thunderlord sage didn't make it very far through Magnarok. Hopefully he still possesses some useful information...
:{{gossip|''Search the orc for clues''}}

Searching him gives [[Argoram's Journal]].
