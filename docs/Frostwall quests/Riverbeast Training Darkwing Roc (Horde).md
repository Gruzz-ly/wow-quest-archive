==Objectives==
Defeat the Darkwing Roc while riding your Riverbeast-In-Training.
*[[Darkwing Roc]] Killed
*[[Riverwallow-In-Training Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
The windrocs of Nagrand are a smart predator, often swooping down on unwary prey in packs. If your beast doesn't keep an eye on the sky, it's likely to lose both.

Travel to Nagrand and take on the fiercest windroc of the bunch, the Darkwing Roc. It will be a good test for your mount.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (20)

==Completion==
From now on, your mount will always remember to keep one eye on the skies.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
