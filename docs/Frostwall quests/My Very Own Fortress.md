==Description==
Boss! Guess what?! I finally got that new larger draft paper in that I ordered when we first came here. And ya know what larger draft paper means? It means I can draw a bigger fortress! And if I can draw it, I can certainly make it! Making's the easy part, as long as you've got a few thousand stones and logs lying around. So whada'ya say, boss? Shall we get building?

==Progress==
On completion, a cutscene plays:
:'''Vol'jin''': {{text|bossemote|Hero, our trust in you was not misplaced. You and the armies you command are now our greatest weapon against the Iron Horde. Lead us to victory, General.}}

==Completion==
I think I could just fall over and die happy right now. It's a dream come true!

I already ordered some even larger draft paper, boss. Don't you worry...
