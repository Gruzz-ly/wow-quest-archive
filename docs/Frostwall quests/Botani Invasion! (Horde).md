==Objectives==
Repel the [[botani]] invasion of your [[garrison]].
* Speak with [[Sergeant Grimjaw]]
* Repel the Invasion  (1)

==Description==
There's a weight in the air. Reminds me of battles in [[Stranglethorn Vale|Stranglethorn Valley]]. Jungle warfare is good for axe-play.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|30|80|}}
* 3,770 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must hold the line!

==Completion==
Is this what a [[peon]] feels like? Chopping down trees and pruning unruly hedges all day? And I thought their job was a bore. Hah!
