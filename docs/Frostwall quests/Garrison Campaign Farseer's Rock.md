==Objectives==
Find {{Au|Draka}} and {{Au|Drek'Thar}} at [[Farseer's Rock]] in [[Frostfire Ridge]].
*Find Draka and Drek'Thar

==Description==
Draka and Drek'Thar are travelling to Farseer's Rock. It is a sacred place, not a safe one. But Draka insists that Drek'Thar must rebuild his connection to the elements.

I can feel the spirits of this land are becoming restless. Something is about to happen, and I suspect these two will need all the help they can get.

Please, <name>, go to them and lend what aid you can. I care for these two a great deal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|22}}
*1400 XP

==Completion==
You again? Not eaten by [[ogre]]s or killed by {{Au|Thunderlord clan|Thunderlords}} yet? Ha.

==Notes==
Exit [[Frostwall]] and run northeast across the [[Icewind Drifts]]. Near the center of the [[Cracking Plains]] lies [[Farseer's Rock]]. Get close to Draka:
:{{text|yell|Farseer Drek'Thar|Spirits of the wind! Heed my call! We have need of your wisdom.}}

==Progression==
