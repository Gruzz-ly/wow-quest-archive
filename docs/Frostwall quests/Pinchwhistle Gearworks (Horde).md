==Objectives==
Speak to <[[Bron Skyhorn]] / [[Hutou Featherwind]]> to secure a flight to the [[Pinchwhistle Gearworks]].
*Flight secured to Pinchwhistle Gearworks

==Description==
Commander, a courier arrived this morning.

He said he's from a goblin settlement <in Spires of Arak / the southeast> called the Pinchwhistle Gearworks. They've asked for our assistance with some sort of ecological disaster.

We're spread thin but if we can earn their trust then we might be able to gain a valuable ally.

Head down there and see what sort of assistance we can provide. I've already spoken to the flight master and he's set up a special flight to get you out there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|42}}
*1470 XP

==Completion==
Hey, you're from that Horde base, right?

Glad you made the trip because we could really use your help!

==Notes==
