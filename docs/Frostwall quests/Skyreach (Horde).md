==Objectives==
Defeat High Sage Viryx in Skyreach.
*[[High Sage Viryx (tactics)|High Sage Viryx]] slain

==Description==
High Sage Viryx has finished a devastating crystal superweapon atop the highest point in Skyreach in Spires of Arak. She intends to eradicate the 'lesser races' in the name of their god Rukhmar.

The arakkoa outcasts were nearly wiped out in mere seconds by the weapon. You must stop Viryx before she turns her sights to your garrison, commander.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Garrison Resources]] (175)
*{{cost|61|60}}
*30,140 experience

==Completion==
Perhaps now the Adherents of Rukhmar will respect we 'lesser races'.

==Patch changes==
