==Objectives==
Defeat Yalnu in the [[Everbloom]].
*[[Yalnu]] slain

==Description==
The [[Kirin Tor]] created an outpost in [[Gorgrond]] with a portal to [[Stormwind]] to facilitate quick reinforcements in the assault on the [[Blackrock Foundry]].  Unfortunately they built it in the heart o' the Everbloom, home to the [[botani]] and the mightiest o' the genesaur - Yalnu.

The outpost has already been overrun and it is only a matter o' time before the overgrowth spreads to Stormwind... and with it the whole of [[Azeroth]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|61|60}}
*30,140 [[XP]]
*[[Garrison Resources]] (175)

==Completion==
Dese wizards' deaths be punishment enough for their lack of foresight. We should be thankful dat we were able to stop da overgrowth before it reached our world.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.1.0|note=Added.}}
