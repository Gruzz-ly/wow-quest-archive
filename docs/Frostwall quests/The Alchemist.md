==Objectives==
Find [[Kadar]] at the [[Boneslag]].

==Description==
I know a little about alchemy from my cousin Kadar. She is the alchemist at [[Stonefang Outpost]]. If you wish to learn more, she is the one with whom to speak. I only hope she has survived the attack.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|14}}
*1370 [[XP]]

==Completion==
My daughter... Inside... (She dies in your arms.)

==Notes==
Fly (or run) to [[Stonefang Outpost]] and exit the west end of town, circle northeast past the [[Boneslag]] to find a house on the north side. Kadar lies dying just outside.

==Progression==
