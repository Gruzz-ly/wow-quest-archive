==Objectives==
Kill Enemy Players in Player versus Player combat to earn 10 Broken Bones then place an offering at the Altar of Bones to Earn a Conqueror's Tribute.
*[[Broken Bones]] (20)

==Description==
[[Durotan (alternate universe)|Durotan]]...

<Raza'kul spits.>

He cowers behind the white flag of peace, relying upon diplomacy to win over our sworn enemies.

Enemies that have taken our homes and driven us from our ancestral lands.

There is only one way to deal with the draenei and their newfound alliance of cowards - blood for blood.

Join me in crushing our enemies. Together we will flood this hallowed ground with the bones of the Alliance and earn tributes fit for a warchief!

Return here when your bloodthirst is sated.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80|}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (50)

==Completion==
We may kill from sky break to sky fall and still our work will never be done. Yet at the end of days when we are measured for our accomplishments, only the bloody wake that we have left behind us will show our true strength. For this reason you must never stop the slaughter of those that would seek to harm us and our loved ones.

Promise me, <name>.
