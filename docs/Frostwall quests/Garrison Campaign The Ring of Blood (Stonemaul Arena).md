==Description==
Hey Champ,

You were out when I stopped by. I've got a sweet gig set up at the Ring of Blood in Nagrand. Lots of ogres looking for the next big fight. Big money. You in?

If you think the Stonemaul arena was a thrill, this is way, way bigger than that. It's going to be HUGE, I'm calling it now.

I'll meet you at my stash so we can talk a bit in private before your big debut.

<A map is included with a dollar sign scrawled on an abandoned ogre tower.>

You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54|}}

==Completion==
I won't waste your time, champ. I've got a once in a lifetime opportunity for you.
