==Objectives==
Defeat Thundercall while riding your Talbuk-In-Training.
*[[Thundercall (elemental)|Thundercall]] Killed
*[[Silverpelt-In-Training Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
The elements can sometimes pose a problem for some beasts. Even the mightiest wolf will often cower at the sound of thunder in the distance.

In Nagrand, off on a windswept cliff high above the shore, is a creature made of pure thunderstorms. Hop atop your beast and face off against Thundercall, and we will see how your mount fares.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (20)

==Completion==
Your mount is bit wet, but seems to be in good spirits. I will dry it off and put it to rest.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
