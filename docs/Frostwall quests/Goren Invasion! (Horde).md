==Objectives==
Repel the [[goren]] invasion of your [[garrison]].
* Speak with [[Sergeant Grimjaw]]
* Repel the Invasion (1)

==Description==
The earth quakes beneath us, Commander. Our [[scout]]s are not returning. I can feel an attack creeping up on us, but from where?

==Completion==
The [[peon]]s will clean this mess, Commander. Rubble and holes everywhere. The rest of us will look for hiding goren so that we may apologize to them for butchering their warleader.
