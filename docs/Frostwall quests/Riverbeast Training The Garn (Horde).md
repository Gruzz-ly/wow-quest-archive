==Objectives==
Defeat Maimclaw while riding your Riverbeast-In-Training.
*[[Maimclaw]] Killed
*[[Riverwallow-In-Training Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
The last test for your mount will pit it against one of the great terrors of this land.

The garn. Wolves as black as night, and twice the size of a normal wolf, they can tear an orc apart in mere moments. The beasts here wisely fear them.

There is a lone garn that calls Nagrand its home. Take your riverbeast, mount up, and bring it down. If the two of you survive, your riverbeast will truly be ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Trained Riverwallow]]
*[[Garrison Resources]] (50)

==Completion==
I had never seen such a beast before coming here, but you have trained it. No small feat, to be certain. Take the reins, you have earned them.

==Patch changes==
