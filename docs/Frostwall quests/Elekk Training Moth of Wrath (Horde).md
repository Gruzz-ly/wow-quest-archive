==Objectives==
Defeat the Moth of Wrath while riding your Meadowstomper-In-Training.
*[[Moth of Wrath]] Killed
*[[Meadowstomper-In-Training Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
Deep in the forests of Nagrand are some beasts capable of evading almost any predator. The greatest of them all, the Moth of Wrath, is coated with a foul-smelling dust.

If the moth dust is enough to keep wolves at bay, it will probably be a pretty good test for your elekk. See if you can keep it focused and defeat the moth.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (20)

==Completion==
Glad to see you back. I will need some time to brush that dust off of your mount.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
