*[[Bass Blaster]] {{co|57.8|10.9|Nagrand (alternate universe)}}
*[[Laz-Tron Disc Reader]] {{co|55.5|90.6|Spires of Arak}}
*[[Phonic Amplifier]] {{co|52|11|Spires of Arak}}
*[[S.P.R.K. Capacitor]]

==Description==
You know what would boost morale around here? Bass. Beats. Music! Everyone loves a party! You go out and get me some hardware, and I'll make a system that will shatter Draenor itself. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Stash of Dusty Music Rolls]]
*[[Garrison Jukebox]]

==Progress==
Collect a Bass Blaster, Laz-Tron Disc Reader, Phonic Amplifer, S.P.R.K. Capacitor, and a Cord of Ancient Wood.

==Completion==
What great shape this stuff is in. Yeah, honest! I think I can work with this junk. Give me just a minute here... 

==Notes==
For a hint, speak with the quest giver again:
:Great day for some tunes, eh Commander?
:{{gossip|Where are the jukebox parts?}}
:Need some help with the shopping list?
:Bass Blaster's easy. The Ogres love loud music to go with their fights at the {{Au|Ring of Blood}}. The spectators aren't there to fight. Just take it from them!
:I seem to remember a working Laz-tron down at [[Pinchwhistle Point]], from a gig I played there once.
:We'll never find a real Phonic Amplifier, so just rip a big hunk of metal off of one of those [[Arakkoa]] sun constructs. That'll do fine.
:As for the capacitor, you'll probably need to break open an [[Iron Horde]] shredder. Seems like your kind of work.
:Oh, and the kind of wood I need has to be seriously [[Draenor ancient|ancient]], so [[Everbloom Wilds]] is probably your best bet in Draenor.

From Frostwall, fly to the [[Everbloom Wilds]] in [[Gorgrond]]. The [[Cord of Ancient Wood]] drops from any [[Draenor ancient]] in the quest area, like a [[Lumbering Ancient]].

Fly to [[Frostwolf Overlook]] and then run towards [[Orunai Coast]] in [[Talador]]. The [[S.P.R.K. Capacitor]] will drop from any [[Iron Shredder]] in the [[Iron Horde]] camps in the area.

Fly to [[Akeeta's Hovel]] on the border between [[Spires of Arak]] and {{Au|Shadowmoon Valley}}. Run north to {{Au|Skettis}}. A [[Phonic Amplifier]] will drop from any [[Stalwart Warden]] in the area.

Fly to [[Pinchwhistle Gearworks]] and run south to [[Pinchwhistle Point]]. The [[Laz-Tron Disc Reader]] is at {{co|55.5|90.6|Spires of Arak}} on the upper floor of the inn. Looting it will spawn a hostile Spore-addled Goblin.
:{{text|say|Spore-addled Goblin|Hey... that's mine! I think...}}

Finally, fly to [[Joz's Rylaks]] in {{Au|Nagrand}} and run north to the [[Ring of Blood]]. Northeast of the ring itself, find three Party Animals dancing behind the [[Bass Blaster]] at {{co|57.8|10.9|Nagrand (alternate universe)}} The ogres are upset, but won't attack:
:{{text|say|Party Animal|Please no hurts us. Just party ogres!}}
:{{text|say|Party Animal|Why you do this?}}
:{{text|say|Party Animal|Party pooper!}}

On complete, the [[Tune-O-Tron 5000]] spawns next to Fix. Open the [[Stash of Dusty Music Rolls]] to acquire the seven faction racial tunes:

*[[Music Roll: Orgrimmar]]
*[[Music Roll: Rescue the Warchief]]
*[[Music Roll: Silvermoon]]
*[[Music Roll: Thunder Bluff]]
*[[Music Roll: Undercity]]
*[[Music Roll: Way of the Monk]]
*[[Music Roll: Zul'Gurub Voodoo]]

There are many more to be found. Bassbolter lists a few hints, which are listed on the [[Garrison Jukebox]] article.
