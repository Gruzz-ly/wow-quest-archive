==Objectives==
Defeat Kura Thunderhoof in a pet battle.
*Defeat [[Kura Thunderhoof]]

==Description==
I love collecting pets, and I've picked up a few unusual pets here in Draenor. What would you say to a battle? If you can defeat my humble team, I think we'll both learn a few new tricks.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|15|40}}
*[[Traveler's Pet Supplies]]
*[[Flawless Battle-Training Stone]] (3)

==Progress==
Are we going to battle or what?

==Completion==
Not bad.  Not bad at all.  Stop by the next time I'm in the neighborhood, and I might have some new pets to check out.
