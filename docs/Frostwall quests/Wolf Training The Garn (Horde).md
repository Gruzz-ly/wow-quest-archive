==Objectives==
Defeat Maimclaw while riding your Snarler-In-Training.
*[[Maimclaw]] Killed
*[[Snarler-In-Training Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
The last test for your mount will pit it against one of the great terrors of this land.

The garn. Wolves as black as night, and twice the size of a normal wolf, they can tear an orc apart in mere moments. The beasts here wisely fear them.

There is a lone garn that calls Nagrand its home. Take your wolf, mount up, and bring it down. If the two of you survive, your wolf will truly be ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Trained Snarler]]
*[[Garrison Resources]] (50)

==Completion==
A savage beast, yet you have tamed it. I should learn to never underestimate you. It awaits your command patiently, almost like it knows you wait for it. Here are the reins, may your companion be ever at your side.
