==Objectives==
Harvest a Timber Sample from Timber and return it to [[Lumber Lord Oktron]].
*[[Timber Sample]]

==Description==
Incredible news, Commander <name>. Your ever-loyal servant (that's me) has managed to secure us timber lords. Now maybe you don't know what a timber lord is, so let explain: think of a blood-crazed, mass murderer who enjoys nothing more than killing. Now take that same enthusiasm for killing and apply it to killing trees! That's a timber lord.

What this means is that we can now cut medium sized timber - but first we need to give these timber lords a test run.

There's a suitable tree nearby. Good luck!

==Rewards==
*{{Abilities|Journeyman Logging|id=167946|Allows you to harvest medium sized timber across Draenor.|icon=garrison_building_lumbermill}}

You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (50)

==Progress==
Did you harvest that timber sample yet?

==Completion==
We haven't even scratched the surface when it comes to overkill.

It looks like this group will serve you well, sir. Medium sized trees across Draenor are now at your mercy. That means more timber per tree!
