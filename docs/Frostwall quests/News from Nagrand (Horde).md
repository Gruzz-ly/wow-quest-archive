==Description==
;Gornek
Welcome back, <sir/mam>.

One of our [[shadow hunter]]s delivered a message about a [[caravan]] being dispatched for {{Au|Nagrand}}. Rokhan's awaiting your approval on a new outpost.

I've been hearing whispers around camp about Nagrand. They say it's {{Au|Warsong clan|Warsong}} territory. They might need your help <sir/mam>.

;Iskar
One of your soldiers stopped by asking for you while you were out. Something about a caravan heading out to Nagrand.

Whatever it was, it can't have gone well for them. That's Warsong territory.

*1,480 [[XP]]
*{{cost|1|46}}

Boss-mon. Good to have ya back.
