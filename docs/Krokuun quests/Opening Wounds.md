[[File:Opening Wounds.jpg|thumb|[[Prophet Velen]], [[Arzal'kal]], [[Chieftain Hatuun]], and a projection of [[Kil'jaeden]] with two loyal man'ari.]]

==Objectives==
Speak to Arzal'kal and listen to what he has to say.
*Speak to [[Arzal'kal]]
*Listen to Arzal'kal

==Description==
My [[hunter]]s were the ones who found Arzal'kal. They said he helped them fight off several [[Burning Legion|Legion]] ambushes.

During our endless vigil on [[Argus]], we had seen nothing like it. He was not as powerful as some [[demon]]s, but he was persistent.

He said he wished to speak with [[Velen]] and knew that we had been in contact with him. So, I have fulfilled his request.

If Velen is all he claims to be, then he would not turn away even the least worthy of his people.

We will see. I expect little.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
If Hatuun called me here to listen, then I will.

I owe Hatuun that respect.

==Completion==
Whatever it is that Arzal'kal wishes to show you, please accompany him.

I must stay here and speak with Hatuun in private.

==Notes==
Speak with Arzal'kal:

{{dialogue|
I am not here to fight.

Only to be heard.

:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|I... am aware of how this appears, Prophet. I will try to be brief.}}
:''Arzal'kal steps forward and summons a projection of [[Kil'jaeden]] and a pair of [[Loyal Man'ari]].''
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|I believed Kil'jaeden and [[Archimonde]]. Their promises of prosperity for our people. How could I not?}}
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|And so when they demanded we pay the Legion's price, I trusted them. We all did.}}
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|But I never knew that price would be paid in millennia of bloodshed and ashes.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|And yet still you paid it.}}
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|I did. Kil'jaeden had a way of invading the mind. Any doubt would be known to him immediately.}}
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|Doubt was betrayal in his eyes. And betrayal, as you know, meant death.}}
:''The projection of Kil'jaeden blasts one of the loyal man'ari, killing it.''
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|And I feared death more than the price of my sin.}}
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|In the end, some of us fled the Legion. But the damage was already done.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|What will you do now, Arzal'kal?}}
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|I want to show that I am no longer a coward. I cannot undo my crimes, but I will give all I have to try.}}
:{{Text|emote|Hatuun crosses his arms, staring intently at Velen.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|Very well. Show me, if it will ease your pain.}}
