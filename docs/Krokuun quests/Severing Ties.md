[[File:Severing Ties.jpg|thumb|Two [[Manari Acolyte]]s and a [[Sargerei Conduit]]]]

==Objectives==
Slay 10 man'ari cultists and overload 5 Sargerei Conduits.
*[[Man'ari]] cultists slain (10)
*[[Sargerei Conduit]]s overloaded (5)

==Description==
[[Speaker Nalridun|Nalridun]] has recruited a small army of [[cultist]]s. They believe he speaks for [[Sargeras]] through the relic, clinging to every word he says. The same way we clung to our leaders when Sargeras came to [[Argus]]. It was a comfort. A hope.

And, in the end, empty deception.

But his followers do not believe they are deceived. They have constructed their own conduits in the area to try to tap into the relic's power. To hear the voice themselves.

They will try to stop us. We must cut a path through them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
May their delusions die with them.

We cannot risk any power they might be adding to Nalridun's rituals.

==Completion==
I know what it is to be scared. But they had a choice, and they chose to stay on the path that we built atop the smoldering remains of countless worlds.

Why, when our home was the first of the worlds we destroyed?

==Notes==
While in the area for [[Contrition (quest)]], [[Arzal'kal]] offers this quest. Accept it and continue. Kill [[Man'ari Acolyte]]s and [[Man'ari Sycophant]]s. In the area, there are also a [[Monstrous Blisterfiend]] and [[Slavering Felhound]]s, but they do not count. Some of them are near dead [[Krokul Scout]]s.
