==Description==
;Automatic
<Name>,

We have won many battles against the [[Burning Legion]], but it is time to end this war once and for all.

Final preparations have begun to depart for [[Argus]].

Make haste to Bladefist Bay. A ship awaits you there to grant you and your allies passage to [[Azuremyst Isle|Azuremyst]].


;Archmage Khadgar

Ever since the Legion invaded the Exodar, the [[draenei]] have been hard at work preparing to return to Argus. At long last they have a vessel that can take us there.

With the way to that dreadful world open, we simply could not ask for a better opportunity to strike. [[Prophet Velen]] called for you quite specifically to join the assault force.

You should make your way to Bladefist Bay right away. Arrangements have been made for a ship there to take you to Azuremyst.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|94|}}

==Completion==
I knew you would be among those called to fight. It will be an honor to fight by your side.
