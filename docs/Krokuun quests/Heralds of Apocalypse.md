==Objectives==
Slay Lady Heretica and Mistress Apostriss.
*[[Lady Heretica]] slain
*[[Mistress Apostriss]] slain

==Description==
We've been presented with a rare opportunity.

Our scouts have spotted two [[shivarra]] priestesses in the western fel pools enhancing the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s war effort.

The inner circle of [[Sargeras]]' chosen never leave the walls of [[Antorus, the Burning Throne|Antorus]]. If we take them out, we might be able to sow fear among those closest to the Dark Titan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]
*[[Phial of 'Sacred' Fel Liquid]]

==Progress==
This may be our only chance to kill one of those sick monsters before we assault Antorus itself.

==Completion==
Impressive. Without the shivarra bolstering their strength we just might stand a chance.

==Notes==
Mistress Apostriss is located in the tall structure towards the southwest area of the Hold. Mistress Apostriss is located at the end of a path in the northwest area of the Hold, next to several inactive fel elementals.
