==Objectives==
Collect an Immaculate Felcore.
*[[Immaculate Felcore]]

==Description==
Our warframe is almost operational! It just needs a good jolt to revitalize its systems.

[[Warlock]]s in the pools below infuse pieces of [[Argus]] with [[fel]] energy to create living siege weapons. If you can extract one, we can use it to jumpstart the warframe's [[:Judgment Core]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
Remember - immaculate!

==Completion==
Yes! This is it!

==Notes==
Kill any of the fel elementals in [[Nath'raxas Hold]] until the Immaculate Felcore drops.
