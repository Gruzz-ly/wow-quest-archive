==Objectives==
Use the Talisman of the Prophet to sanctify 9 fallen [[Army of the Light]] warriors.
* Warriors sanctified (9)
* [[Talisman of the Prophet]] (provided)

==Description==
There is no end to the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s depravity. Every battle won, every world conquered, yields more souls to fuel their war machine.

They have not yet defiled all of the fallen warriors in the hold, but I fear it is only a matter of time. Please, take this talisman with you into the hold and use it to sanctify any corpses you encounter.

They deserve a better fate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]
*[[Sanctified Warrior Memento]]

==Progress==
All who fall nobly deserve to rest in peace.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Your actions deny the Legion power and grant the dead the peace they deserve.

==Notes==
You do not need to target the corpse of the Lightforged soldier in order to use the provided quest item. Simply use it while near an eligible corpse (up to about 10 yds away) to gain credit.

You need to purify deceased [[Lightforged Sharpshooter]]s and [[Lightforged Bulwark]]s.
