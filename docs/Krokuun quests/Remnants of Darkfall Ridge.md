==Objectives==
Use the [[Scouting Map]] and complete the mission, "[[Darkfall Ridge Supplies]]".

* Complete the mission, "Darkfall Ridge Supplies."

==Description==
My riders have [[talbuk]], but my people need supplies. Food. Tools. Weapons.

For millennia, we have migrated from one hovel to the next, moving each time the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] discovered us. Never able to flee with our possessions, we left them behind.

You are powerful, your [[Class Hall#Champions|followers]] are capable, but you do not know [[Argus]]. The landscape will dispatch you as mercilessly as the Legion. Recover our supplies from [[Darkfall Ridge]], and I will order my people to guide your forces through the [[Argus Wastes]].

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[Krokuun Equipment]]

==Progress==
Have you found our supplies, <name>?

==Completion==
You have recovered our supplies. As promised, we will aid your forces on Argus.

==Gains==
