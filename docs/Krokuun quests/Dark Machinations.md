==Objectives==
Dismantle 3 Spires of Woe.
*[[Spire of woe|Spire of Woe]] dismantled (3)

==Description==
[[Eredar]] are adept at manipulating the [[fel]] that courses through [[Argus|this world]]. Those who do not shape it into living weapons build other armaments, like the Spires of Woe.

The spires will make it difficult for even a small force to penetrate the main stronghold. We must dismantle enough of them to clear the way before we advance upon it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
We do not have time for failure.

==Completion==
No war is won by a single act, but without the spires protecting them the rest of the hold will fall as well.

==Notes==
When you come across a [[Spire Stabilizer]], draw out any mobs within the spire's radius and deal with them first. When ready, run in and swiftly destroy the stabilizer.
