==Objectives==
Travel to [[Destiny Point]].
*[[Lightforged beacon|Lightforged Beacon]] called
*Join [[Turalyon]] at Destiny Point.

==Description==
We have already secured ground near [[Nath'raxas Hold]]. It is one of the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s chief military fortifications on [[Argus]].

Striking it now, and hard, may be our only opportunity to tip the scales in our favor.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[Lightforged Beacon: Destiny Point]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Completion==
If we do not act quickly, the [[demon]]s stationed here are more than enough to overwhelm us.

==Notes==
Interact with the [[Navigation Console]] and teleport to [[Krokul Hovel]] in [[Krokuun]]. Once there, take the path leading east until you reach a fork. Head left and continue forward in a mostly northern direction while being careful to avoid the [[Garothi Obliterator]] that patrols the path.

:{{text|say|[[Alleria Windrunner]]|Would become finite. Taking away the Legion's advantage would give us our best chance to save [[Azeroth]]!}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|I will meet you at our staging ground near Nath'raxas. The [[Vindicaar]] must be ready to help us secure the hold at a moment's notice.}}

:''Turalyon and Alleria arrives with the teleporter. He runs over to contact the [[Image of Grand Artificer Romuul]], while she runs down to help fortify the barricades.''
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|Taking this hold will buy us valuable time to prepare for a full assault on [[Antorus, the Burning Throne|Antorus]].}}

;Quest completion
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|I won't risk our forces on the spire without that [[warframe]] backing us.}}
