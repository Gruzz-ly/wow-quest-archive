;The surface
:''You are sent to a space in front of where the ship's bunker has smashed the area clear. Nearby, two [[Exodar Vindicator]]s look over the scared planet from the ridge.''
:{{text|say|Exodar Vindicator|Our home... what has it become?}}
:''Further on, a vindicator mournfully cradles the body of a dead comrade.''
:{{text|say|Exodar Vindicator|No, Light please.  Not after we have come this far!}}
:''On another ridge further on, Velen and Illidan overlook the battle going on below as the allies beat back the attackers. Velen has cast shields to use as barriers and is actively shielding everyone from the siege weapon as it fires on them. NPCs that were on the ''Vindicaar'' such as [[Silgryn]] and [[Vindicator Boros]] are seen fighting as well.
