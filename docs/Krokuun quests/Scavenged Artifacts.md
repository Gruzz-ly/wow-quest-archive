'''Scavenged Artifacts''' is the final quest in the Seeing Red storyline. Completing it unlocks access to several new NPCs across [[Argus]] who provide materials for [[Gaal]]'s new items: [[Eranthi]], [[Heraat]], [[Saatilu]], [[Tronaar]], [[Yazdan]], and [[Zyaana]].

==Completion==
If you have supplies, I have wares. Old things. Some sacred things.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Eredar Artifact Recovery|id=421107|Gaal will now sell a selection of recovered [[eredar]] artifacts from [[Argus]]'s golden age before the coming of [[Sargeras]] and the schism of the [[draenei]] people.|icon=inv_misc_tournaments_banner_draenei}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Notes==
Gaal barters {{expac|Legion}} trade goods and [[Veiled Argunite]] for new cosmetic items and a toy:

{{:Gaal}}

He also has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
There is always more work to be done.

{{gossip|Where can I find the supplies you want to trade?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
If you want to gather them yourself, these materials can be found throughout Argus.

Recently, Arzaal's allies have been stealing supplies for us from the Legion's encampments.

You could try to locate them and see if they have anything for you to bring back.}}}}

A handful of [[man'ari eredar]] characters appear upon completion of this quest and will each hand over an [[Argunite Cluster]].
