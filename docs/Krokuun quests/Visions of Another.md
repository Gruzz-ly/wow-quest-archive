: {{text|say|Eonar|I remember the awakening... how life sprang forth all around us.}}
: ''Down the path from the portal in the [[Halls of the Boundless Reach]], [[Elunaria]] is shown in all its glory as Eonar speaks, with what appear to be [[Avatar of Freya|avatars of Freya]] going about their duties. The view heads for the entrance of a (relatively) small Titan building.''
: {{text|say|Eonar|I remember unity... until it was shattered by betrayal.}}
: ''Through the indoor hall, the camera suddenly zooms into blinding light toward the holographic globe of [[Azeroth]] on the other side and the way to the [[Elarian Sanctuary]].''
: {{text|say|Eonar|I remember fleeing... to keep [[Sargeras|him]] from his prize.}}
: ''From another Azeroth hologram within the sanctuary, the camera pans downward to the northwest, where the [[Essence of Eonar]], her very soul, resides. The view changes to focus on her face.''
: {{text|say|Eonar|The time for hiding is over. Aid me... or everything ends.}}
: ''The view suddenly goes dark with her warning.''
: ''The vision ends.''
: {{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|The Life-Binder! Somehow, she's the key to Sargeras's plan.}}
