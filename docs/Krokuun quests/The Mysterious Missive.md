==Objectives==
Search near the [[Xenedar]] for someone with knowledge of the Sealed Missive.
*[[Sealed Missive]] (provided)

==Description==
<On the body, you find a missive emblazoned with the seal of the [[Army of the Light]].

If the messenger was killed to prevent the letter's delivery, its contents must be of great import.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
Our fight goes on, champion. [[Argus]] must fall.

What is that you've found?

==Completion==
You've found one of our scouting reports? It was overdue, and I feared it had been intercepted by the enemy.

<The captain looks over the letter.>

Yes, this is what I've been expecting. The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] is planning something and this is the breakthrough we've been looking for!
