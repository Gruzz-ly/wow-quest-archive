==Objectives==
Return to [[Chieftain Hatuun]] in [[Krokul Hovel]].

<Name>, you have my thanks. My Wranglers should be able to take it from here. If I can ask one more favor, would you pass a message to Chieftain Hatuun? Tell him the forest is secure once again. I'm sure he will reward you for all of your effort.

I'll loan you one of my fastest Cragscalers for the trip. Make sure to look both ways before crossing that path outside this forest, there's a giant [[Burning Legion|Legion]] [[Garothi Obliterator|Obliterator]] that patrols there. Good luck!
