==Objectives==
Destroy the three [[Soul Coffer]]s on the [[Shattered Fields]].
* Eastern Soul Coffer destroyed
* Southern Soul Coffer destroyed
* Western Soul Coffer destroyed

==Description==
They were waiting for us when we crashed. It was all we could do to establish our small outpost.

Even now they drain the souls of our fallen to fuel their attacks.

Destroy their soul coffers. Free our comrades and let them join the [[Light]].

When you have finished, find [[Archmage Y'mera|Y'mera]] in the field. She has been sorely missed, but she will not have fallen. Of this I am certain.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] is endless, but the Light shines eternal.

==Completion==
Good work. They will return in time, but we can use this advantage.

==Progression==
{{The Hand of Fate}}

==Patch changes==
