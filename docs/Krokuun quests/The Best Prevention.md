==Objectives==
Slay 20 attackers in the [[Shattered Fields]].
* Attackers slain  (20)

==Description==
If you've brought the [[Turalyon|High Exarch]] back to us, you are a welcome ally indeed.

More is needed of you. You see our soldiers out there, fighting against all odds? Defend them. Slay the enemy.

Strong words for a [[priest]], perhaps, but every dead [[man'ari]] is one less blade at our throats.

Show them that the [[Light]] protects its chosen even as it scorches the unfaithful.

When you are finished, seek out [[Archmage Y'mera|Y'mera]]. She will have fewer troops, and more need of your abilities.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
We have heard the clash of battle for ages.

Its din never truly goes away, but can diminish from time to time.

==Completion==
You fought well. The Light shines brighter, thanks to your efforts.

==Progression==
{{The Hand of Fate}}
