== Objectives ==
* Felspawn slain (20)
* [[Spire of Woe]] dismantled (5)

== Description ==
: {{text|say|[[Illidan Stormrage]]|[[Eredar]] sorcerers twist the [[fel]] blood of this world into weapons to use against us. They must be dismantled.}}

== Rewards ==
* +75 reputation with Army of the Light

== Completion ==
: {{text|say|Illidan Stormrage|We will see the [[Burning Legion|Legion's]] end, even if we must tear [[Argus]] itself asunder.}}

== Notes ==
Triggers at [[Nath'raxas Hold]]. The mobs are [[Igneous Crusher]]s, [[Blazing Felshard]]s, and [[Wrathful Ember]]s. You may want to focus on the groups of small Wrathful Embers. There're sometimes [[Nath'raxxan Pyroclast]]s channeling inside the fields or patrolling around that you may have to kill.

The Spires of Woe are kept active by a [[Spire Stablizer]], defensive fel crystals. As you will be harmed within their field, try using an ability to get to the crystal quickly, and it would be best to make sure you won't be interrupted while clicking on it.

== Patch changes ==
