==Objectives==
Speak with [[Turalyon]] to revive [[Xe'ra]].
* Speak with Turalyon

==Description==
It is time, <name>.

Xe'ra is returned to us. We have [[:Light's Heart]]. We have her [[Illidan Stormrage|Chosen One]].

Come, let us restore her. Let us forge a bright new path against our foes.

Speak to me when you are ready to begin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|58|20|}}
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
Xe'ra...

==Completion==
I did not expect this of Xe'ra. Nor could I have foreseen Illidan's reaction.

We must ensure these events do not crush the spirits of our allies.

==Notes==
;Turalyon
:With Light's Heart, we can restore Xe'ra to her full glory.

:The sooner we do this, the sooner we grow stronger against the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].

:{{gossip|Let us begin, Turalyon.}}

;Cinematic
:''Two vindicators place [[:Light's Heart]] in the center of Xe'ra. Turalyon kneels as Light's Heart comes to life and Xe'ra is reconstituted into her original shape. As Xe'ra is restored, Turalyon's brown eyes turn golden and he stands.''
:'''High Exarch Turalyon''': {{text|bossemote|We are blessed to be in your presence once more, Xe'ra.}}
:'''Xe'ra''': {{text|bossemote|Turalyon. You have found the Chosen One.}}
:''Turalyon turns and motions for [[Illidan Stormrage]] to come forward.''
:'''Xe'ra''': {{text|bossemote|Illidan. [[Awakenings|From birth]], the light in your eyes held such promise for the future.}}
:''Illidan's mind flashes back to the [[War of the Ancients]], during which [[Sargeras]] burned out his eyes and [[In My Father's House|replaced them with demonic ones.]]''
:'''Illidan Stormrage''': {{text|bossemote|I sacrificed that birthright long ago.}}
:'''Xe'ra''': {{text|bossemote|Do you not wish to reclaim what was lost? To be whole again?}}
:'''Illidan Stormrage''': {{text|bossemote|The [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s end... is all I seek.}}
:'''Xe'ra''': {{text|bossemote|My child. You have given so much, for so little.}}
:''Illidan glares, while Xe'ra continues.''
:'''Xe'ra''': {{text|bossemote|Your true potential, your redemption lies before you.}}
:''Energies of light flow from Xe'ra and encircle Illidan.''
:'''Xe'ra''': {{text|bossemote|Let go of your shattered form and embrace the light's power.}}

:'''Xe'ra''': {{text|bossemote|The Light is your destiny.}}
:'''Illidan Stormrage''': {{text|bossemote|My destiny is my own!}}
:''Enraged, Illidan breaks the binds and uses  his [[Eye Beam|eye beams]] on Xe'ra while Velen, [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]], and Turalyon shield their eyes from the resulting brightness caused by the conflicting energies. As the brightness clears, they open their eyes. Turalyon looks on for a moment in shock, his eyes returning to their normal color. Illidan lands and partially collapses from the strain. Turalyon's feet are seen walking towards Illidan, who is surrounded by the shattered remnants of Xe'ra. Turalyon's pace then quickly increases as he draws [[Great Royal Sword|his sword]], all but running.''
:'''High Exarch Turalyon''': {{text|bossemote|You've doomed us all! Betrayer!}}
:''Turalyon swings his sword down towards Illidan, but Illidan stops the blade with his left hand. Illidan then turns his face towards Turalyon's as he speaks.''
:'''Illidan Stormrage''': {{text|bossemote|Your faith has blinded you. There can be no chosen one.}}
:'''Illidan Stormrage''': {{text|bossemote|Only we... can save ourselves.}}

*[[Arator the Redeemer]]: I cannot believe my eyes...
*[[Vereesa Windrunner]]: What just happened? Did he... kill her?
