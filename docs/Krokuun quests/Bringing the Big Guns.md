==Objectives==
Locate and secure Light's Judgment.
* Secure [[Light's Judgment (item)|Light's Judgment]]

==Description==
Light's Judgment has a security feature to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. We can trigger its recall mechanism, which will teleport it back to a vessel.

With the [[Xenedar]] out of commission, the gun should recall to [[Vindicaar|your ship]] instead. You can make good use of its firepower.

The process takes time, though, and will likely attract the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s attention. Be on your guard.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Completion==
<The panel is now pulsing a soft golden glow. According to [[Grand Artificer Romuul|Romuul]], activating it should teleport the cannon to the Vindicaar.>

;Light's Judgment found
:{{text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|I have your coordinates, champion. It will take some time to calibrate the teleportation matrices. Keep it out of the Legion's hands until then!}}
:{{text|say|[[Felforge Salvager]]|Hey, that's ours! We saw it first!}}
:{{text|say|Felforge Salvager|Quickly, quickly! Someone tell the quartermaster!}}
:{{text|say|[[Quartermaster Aikras]]|This is quite a find. We'll be taking it from here!}}
:''The [[adventurer]] successfully defends the cannon.''
:{{text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|That should be it! Just activate the console one last time to complete the transfer. I will handle the rest!}}

;Quest completion
:''A short cutscene plays, showing the cannon attaching itself to the Vindicaar and priming for action.''
