==Objectives==
Kill 8 Eredar ritualists and Lady Shahrazad in the [[Petrified Forest]].
* Eredar ritualists slain  (8)
* [[Lady Shahrazad]] slain

==Description==
;Scroll
The scroll details a dark spell which steals the souls from the neighboring [[Krokul]] to create a new demon, the [[Ur'zul]]. The scroll is signed by Lady Shahrazad.

;Jerek
As you may have seen, the ritualists in this forest kidnap our people and perform heinous rituals on them. The souls of our fallen now roam as twisted creatures. This sin cannot go unpunished. Kill as many ritualists as you are able, but be sure to strike at the dark demon that leads them. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* +250 reputation with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Completion==
You've been a great asset to my wranglers here. Please take this as a token of our gratitude.

==Notes==
*The path to reach Lady Shahrazad begins somewhat southeast of the [[krokul]] encampment in the Petrified Forest, starting at the broken steps. {{co|70.7|66.8|Krokuun}} You have to kill [[Eredar Acolyte]]s and [[Eredar Soulshaper]]s.

==Progression==
{{The Wranglers}}
