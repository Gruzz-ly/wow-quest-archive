==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Captain Fareeya]]|Logistics and supplies are often forgotten in the heat of battle, but are critical to maintaining our presence here. Collect what you can from the field to strengthen our defenses.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Completion==
: {{text|say|Captain Fareeya|Thank you. These crystals can be adapted to power our defenses. They are a valuable resource.}}

==Notes==
Small groups of crystals can be found on the ground, as well as looted from most of the demons there. One thing you can do is stay at the base while making sure you're in the quest area, and wait for the demons that spawn to attack the NPCs. Help kill them and loot them after.
