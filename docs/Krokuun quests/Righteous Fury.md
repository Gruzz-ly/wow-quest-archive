==Objectives==
Destroy 3 Legion Devastators.
* Southern Devastator destroyed
* Western Devastator destroyed
* Eastern Devastator destroyed
* Meet [[Prophet Velen]] at the [[Crown of Destruction]]

==Description==
The [[devastator]]s bombarding our forces prevent us from advancing any further. I can only protect us from their blasts for so long.

Champion, you must pierce their lines and remove the barriers protecting the devastators.

If you can destroy the [[Devastator Anchor|anchors]] that maintain the shields, I can cleanse them from afar.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*+150 reputation with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
Unless the anchors are destroyed, the devastators cannot be touched.

==Completion==
We may yet stand a chance.

==Notes==
While fighting demons and destroying [[Devastator Anchor|devastator barriers]], pick up [[A Stranger's Plea]] from [[Chieftain Hatuun]]. You will need to complete the quest (alongside the two you're already on) to progress to the next part.

Once all three barriers around a [[devastator]] are destroyed, the ''Vindicaar'' will bombard and destroy it.
