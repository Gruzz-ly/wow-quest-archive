==Objectives==
Follow [[Prophet Velen]].

* Follow Velen
* Stand with Velen

==Description==
I can feel their presence just ahead. It is as faint as the lightest breeze that once rolled across these hills, but it is not of the [[Burning Legion|Legion]], of that I am certain.

We must see if these [[Broken]] are potential allies. It is a great risk, but our numbers are too few to ignore the chance.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|85|}}

==Completion==
[[Turalyon]] yet lives! Perhaps there is still hope after all.
