==Objectives==
Kill 10 panthara within the [[Petrified Forest]].
*[[Panthara]] slain (10)

==Description==
Here in this forest, species of [[talbuk]] and [[panthara]] still roam. However, the balance has been disrupted and now the panthara risk hunting the talbuk to extinction. To ensure their survival, we must decrease the number of panthara.

Do not let their suffering linger. A swift death is the most merciful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]
*[[Duskcloak Dorsal Plate]]

==Progress==
These creatures are beautiful, but some must die so others can live.

==Completion==
Keeping balance within the forest ensures its longevity.

*Kill [[Duskcloak Panthara]]
