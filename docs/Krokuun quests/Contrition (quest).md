==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Speaker Nalridun.jpg|Speaker Nalridun|Using an ancient draenic relic, Nalridun claims to have the power to commune with [[Sargeras]].}}
Meet Arzal'kal in the [[Grove of Naroua]], then slay Speaker Nalridun and retrieve the ancient draenic relic.
*Regroup with [[Arzal'kal]] {{co|63.5|42.5|Krokuun}}
*[[Speaker Nalridun]] slain {{co|73.1|33.6|Krokuun}}
*[[Brilliant Star|Relic]] retrieved

==Description==
The [[man'ari]] have grown desperate since the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] fell. Some grasp for power. Some isolate themselves. Others have formed cults awaiting the return of [[Sargeras]]. They have faith that he will lead them again one day.

Nalridun is the leader of one such [[cult]]. They are reclusive, but it is rumored that he has seized an ancient relic that [[Kil'jaeden]] kept until his death. Nalridun claims to use it to commune with Sargeras.

I believe I know what this relic is. If I am correct, it must be returned to [[Velen]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|56|18}}
*11,900 [[XP]]
*[[Flightstones]] x10

==Progress==
Even if I die here, at least it will not be at the Legion's whim.

==Completion==
It is done.

One evil rectified.

It is all I allowed myself to hope for.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Arzal'kal|I will meet you outside the cult's encampment. Tread carefully.}}
:{{text|say|[[Chieftain Hatuun]]|So you will listen, but send <name> in your place when it is time to act?}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|I cannot guide Arzal'kal to a path. He must choose it of his own will.}}

Before leaving, Velen and Hatuun have new gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Velen|
<Velen frowns to himself, clearly in deep contemplation.>

{{gossip|How do you feel about Arzal'kal?}}
{{dialogue-child|
I do not disregard the potential danger here.

This could be a ploy to earn my trust, and then finish the work Kil'jaeden could not. It would earn him great favor within the Legion, no doubt.

It is indeed the patience of the man'ari, not merely their cruelty, that makes them terrible enemies.

But the doubt in his eyes... I have seen it elsewhere before. It is not something easily feigned.

I am willing to see what he wishes to show me.
}}}}

{{dialogue|title=Hatuun|
Words cannot be believed. Only actions.

That is why Velen must be here in the flesh.

{{gossip|Do you trust Arzal'kal?}}
{{dialogue-child|
Trust?

<Hatuun scowls bitterly.>

I trust no one. Trust is even more foolish than hope.

I feel no sympathy for Arzal'kal. But he is useful to me and my people. In return, I am useful to him.

He needed me to bring Velen here, and I wanted to see Velen turn and leave.

{{gossip|You want Velen to reject Arzal'kal?}}
{{dialogue-child|
I expect Velen to do what he always does. Turn his back on those he leaves behind.

I once thought he had changed--but after Antorus fell, after he left us once again, I knew he had not.

His offer to have us join him on Azeroth was nothing but a gesture. I would not be deceived by his hollow promises again.

So when Arzal'kal made his plea to me, I welcomed the chance to see how empty Velen's words really were.

Consider taking the teleport from [[Krokul Hovel]] to [[Destiny Point]] to save some time. Catch up with [[Arzal'kal]] at the [[Grove of Naroua]], where he stops:
:{{text|say|Arzal'kal|We begin here, <name>.}}

Here, Arzal'kal offers [[Severing Ties]]. Pick it up, then speak with him again:

{{dialogue|
Nalridun's base of operations lies ahead.

Are you ready to proceed?

{{Gossip|Why should I trust you?}}
{{dialogue-child|
I do not expect your trust.

I only wish to prove that I can still help the [[draenei]]--not despite what I am, but because of what I am.

The Legion has made me into a monster. They will learn to fear it.

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}}}

{{Gossip|Your master's deception nearly doomed my people, demon.}} ({{Race|Orc}} only)
{{Dialogue-child|
I know. [[Kil'jaeden]] boasted of it often. He called his corruption of the orcs his "masterpiece."

But there was no beauty in what he did, only a repetition of what [[Sargeras]] had done to us.

[[Orc|Your people]] should never been pulled into the atrocities we committed.

I cannot amend the damage that was done, but I will fight to keep it from ever happening again.

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}}}
{{Gossip|Many of our people died because of you, demon.}} ({{Race|Draenei}} only)
{{Dialogue-child|
Yes. They did.

Kil'jaeden ordered your deaths and we obeyed. I obeyed. My hands are soaked in your blood.

I will not insult you with an empty apology, as if it could repair anything.

But know that I am ashamed of what I have done. Of what I allowed to happen.

I make no excuses, only a promise that I will give everything to rebuild what we shattered.

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}}}

{{Gossip|quest=|I am ready.}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|I tried once to reason with Nalridun, but he and his followers cannot be persuaded from their path.}}
:''Arzal'kal starts accompanying the adventurer.''

On the way, he has new gossip:

{{dialogue|
They have chosen their final path, and I have chosen mine.
}}

Find Nalridun at {{co|73.12|33.78|Krokuun}}. Aggro him:
:{{Text|say|Speaker Nalridun|So you would abandon Sargeras, Arzal'kal? The only one who ever fulfilled his promises to us?}}

Slay him:
:{{text|say|Speaker Nalridun|Sargeras... his voice... I cannot hear...}}
:{{text|say|Arzal'kal|You heard only what you wanted to, Nalridun. As did so many of us.}}

Interact with the [[Ancient Draenic Relic]] that Speaker Nalridun was channeling to pick up the [[Brilliant Star]].
