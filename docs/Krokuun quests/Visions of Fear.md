: ''In the [[Temple of Anguish]] portion of [[The Burning Throne]] of [[Antorus]], [[Aggramar]] walks up from the left hallway as [[Sargeras]] speaks. Down below in the temple chamber, the [[Coven of Shivarra]] stand before the corner pillars, each restraining a unique swirling orb of energy. They await his command.''
: {{text|say|Sargeras|The hour of rebirth draws near. Are the souls prepared?}}
: ''The closest shivarra look up toward Aggramar as he answers.''
: {{text|say|Aggramar|Our kin still resist the true path, master. But they will soon be broken.}}
: ''While he finishes speaking he gestures to the Coven, who begin torturing the [[Pantheon]] souls as he walks onward to the south side.''
: {{text|say|Sargeras|One still eludes us. Her essence is needed to ensure the victory of [[Burning Crusade|my crusade]].}}
: ''Having stopped at the top of the stairs, Aggramar continues down them to address Sargeras, here represented by a large ground portal-like swirl of red light.''
: {{text|say|Aggramar|The [[Eonar|Life-Binder]] will soon reveal herself. She will not escape me, master!}}
: ''Aggramar turns away from Sargeras to observe the [[Coven of Shivarra|torturing]] of [[Aman'Thul]], [[Norgannon]], [[Golganneth]], and [[Khaz'goroth]].''
: {{text|say|Sargeras|When my new Pantheon rises, no power in the universe will stand against the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]!}}
: ''The vision ends. Back in the cave, Magni is filled with dread.''
: {{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Sargeras is building some kind o' Dark Pantheon! We gotta find Eonar's spirit before Aggramar does!}}
