==Objectives==
Use the [[:Lightforged Warframe]] to take control of the [[Court of the Avenger]].
*Take control of the Lightforged Warframe
*Reinforcements slain  (60)
*[[Nath'raxxan Rift]] closed (3)

==Description==
Thanks to your efforts, our enemy is in disarray and their defenses inoperable.

We must take the ground at the [[Nath'raxas Spire|spire's]] base and tighten the noose around [[Lord Nath'raxas|their commander's]] neck.

You have more than earned the honor to take the warframe into battle. We will follow your lead once the way is clear.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|38|80|}}
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
The Legion's defeat here is inevitable now. We just need to see it through.

==Completion==
Well fought! Now for the commander.

==Notes==
Mobs will quickly respawn here, so deal with them and keep moving.
