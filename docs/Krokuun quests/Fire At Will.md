==Objectives==
Enter a [[Lightforged Battery]] and slay 30 Frenzied Plaguewings.
* [[Frenzied Plaguewing]] slain (30)

==Description==
Look out there, the wings of the bats fill the sky. We must offer what ranged support we can, but our hands are full here.

It looks like the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] has not yet destroyed all of the [[Lightforged_Battery|artillery batteries]]. If you can get to one, you should be able to show those flying fiends the [[Light]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|19|40|}}
|Lightforged Cannon Projectile
}}

* +250 reputation with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
Those bats are always a nuisance to deal with. This method will be more... efficient, I believe.

==Completion==
We may be grounded, but that does not mean they have to rule the skies!
