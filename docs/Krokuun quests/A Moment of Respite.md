==Notes==
;Quest accept
:{{text|say|[[Prophet Velen]]|The Vindicaar will be the instrument of our retribution. As with any weapon, you should know it well before we charge into battle once more.}}

;Artificer Shela'na
:{{gossip|What is that behind you?}}

::Behind me rests the [[Netherlight Crucible]]. It is an ancient remnant of [[Argus|this world]] that once served as a source of considerable magic.

::Though its potential power is thought by many to be a gift, empowering it would require great sacrifice... as well as a delicate balance of [[Light]] and [[Shadow]].

;Thelbus Wimblenod
:{{gossip|What is that portal doing here?}}

::That? Why that's just a portal I've conjured to allow safe passage to and from [[Dalaran]].

::Never know when we're gonna need reinforcements!

::{{gossip|Interesting... And why aren't you wearing any shoes?}}

:::The cold flooring beneath my feet helps me maintain my concentration.

:::{{gossip|But you're sitting down.}}

::::Yes, well you got me there. Still comfortable regardless.

::::Now if you'll excuse me, I've got quite a bit of reading to do.

;High Priest Ishanah
:{{gossip|It is good to see you, Ishanah. How are you?}}

::I am well, <name>. Thank you for asking.

::Before you venture out to the fields of battle I wanted to make sure you know that my services are always available should you need a place to rest.

::Be well.
