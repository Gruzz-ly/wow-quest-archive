==Objectives==
Find the blacksmith [[Gaal]].

* [[Glowing Key Fragment]] (provided)

==Description==
<Class>, I believe this may be a piece of the key to the Armory of the Triumvirate. We locked it behind us as we made our escape from [[Argus]]. The last time I saw it, my second in command, [[Commander Atalaa|Atalaa]], was leading a force to secure the armory. That was so long ago...

I cannot be certain, but there may be another who would know. The smith who forged the key was called Gaal. With the reports of [[broken]] surviving on [[Krokuun]], he may still live.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|70|}}

==Completion==
I am glad to hear [[Captain Fareeya|Fareeya]] is well.

She is right... this is a fragment of the armory key I forged her so long ago.

==Gains==
* +75 reputation with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Progression==
...
