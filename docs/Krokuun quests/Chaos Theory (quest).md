==Objectives==
Kill 12 [[Nath'raxxan Fleshcarver]]s, [[Nath'raxxan Doomshot]]s, or [[Ravenous Soulhunter]]s, and 1 Nathrezim Banelord.

* Nath'raxxan forces slain  (12)
* [[Nathrezim Banelord]] slain

==Description==
Despite their strength and their numbers, even the [[Burning Legion]] requires order to fight. Disrupt that order... and they fall like the rabble they are.

The plan is simple. Let chaos reign in their ranks, and the day will be ours.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
We must do whatever it takes to see this done.

==Completion==
Now that their forces are in disarray, let us proceed.
