==Objectives==
Find High Inquisitor Raalgar before the Legion frees him.
* Speak to [[Grand Artificer Romuul|Romuul]] to travel to the [[Arcatraz]]
* Search the Arcatraz
* Close Legion Portals (2)
* [[High Inquisitor Raalgar]] found
* [[Lah'zaruun]] slain
* Escape from the Arcatraz

==Description==
High Inquisitor Raalgar has some connection to the [[fel]] here on [[Argus]] that makes him unkillable. Long ago, the [[naaru]] imprisoned him on the Arcatraz.

When the forces of [[Kael'thas Sunstrider]] attacked the citadel, we were forced to flee on the [[Exodar]].

Some [[Burning Legion|Legion]] prisoners escaped the Arcatraz when last the Legion invaded [[Azeroth]], but Raalgar did not. Stop them from freeing him and I will study the source of his immortality so it can be broken.

I can get you close. The rest is up to you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]
*[[Voidcore Control Rod]]

==Progress==
We must stop High Inquisitor Raalgar!

==Completion==
You did your best, <name>, but the demons won this round.

It won't take Raalgar long to gather his power to attack us. But I have learned the source of his immortality while you were gone!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|Once you've reached the Arcatraz, I will remain in contact.}}

Speak to Romuul when you're ready.
:{{gossip|I am ready to go to the Arcatraz.}}

On arrival:
:{{text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|High Inquisitor Raalgar was imprisoned deep inside the Arcatraz. The Legion is already here, so be careful!}}

Head into the next room.
:{{text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|The Legion has opened portals to invade the Arcatraz. Shut them down... before you find yourself outflanked.}}
:{{text|say|[[Felshadow Seeker]]|Make quick work of this intruder. Lah'zaruun needs time to get the High Inquisitor to Argus!}}

Deal with the mobs and close the first portal, then continue further into the Arcatraz.
:{{text|say|Felshadow Seeker|Ah, the hero comes too late. Our mistress will have freed the High Inquisitor by now.}}

Head to the north area (on your minimap) of [[Stasis Block: Trion]] to close the second portal.
:{{text|say|Felshadow Seeker|[[Zereketh]]'s [[void]] magic still lingers here.}}
:{{text|say|Felshadow Seeker|It is ours for the taking, sister.}}

Second portal closed:
:{{text|bossemote|As the portal closes, a sealed door opens further into the Arcatraz.}}

Take the pathway leading to the upper floor.
:''Two Felshadow Seekers are channeling containment energies at an [[Arcatraz Sentinel]].''
* {{text|say|Felshadow Seeker|This is taking too long! We have more important things to do than play with this thing.}}
* {{text|say|Felshadow Seeker|It is not worth our death to fight these sentinels. Keep it subdued until the High Inquisitor is free!}}
* {{text|say|Felshadow Seeker|It's very dangerous, sisters. Maintain control!}}

Go west into yet another room, then go south.
: ''A Felshadow Seeker is channeling the energies from the crystals of the Arcatraz.''
:{{text|say|Felshadow Seeker|All of the power in this place now belongs to the Legion.}}

: ''Two more seekers are at the entrance to the next hallway, wary of a wandering sentinel.''
* {{text|say|Felshadow Seeker|We must destroy this sentinel without delay. The Legion needs the High Inquisitor!}}
* {{text|say|Felshadow Seeker|I admit it is impressive that the sentinels still patrol after all this time.}}
* {{text|say|Felshadow Seeker|Keep your distance. Those things sting!}}
* {{text|say|Felshadow Seeker|''You'' attack it first.}}

Upon entering [[Stasis Block: Maximus]]:
:{{text|yell|High Inquisitor Raalgar|I am free!}}
:{{text|yell|Lah'zaruun|High Inquisitor! The enemy is upon us!}}
:{{text|say|High Inquisitor Raalgar|Lah'zaruun, my loyal servant. Stay here and kill these fools. I have much to do.}}
:{{text|yell|Lah'zaruun|It will be done, High Inquisitor!}}
:''Raalgar departs through a Legion portal.''
:{{text|yell|Lah'zaruun|Seekers, cover the High Inquisitor's departure! I will deal with this interruption!}}

Kill Lah'razuun.
:{{text|yell|Lah'razuun|Your invasion of Argus will fail! High Inquisitor Raalgar will see to that!}}
:{{text|yell|Lah'zaruun|A futile effort, worm!}}

:{{text|yell|Lah'zaruun|Minions, to me!}}
:''The two Felshadow Seekers join the fight, but the [[adventurer]] proceeds to finish them all off.''

;Death
:{{text|say|Lah'zaruun|Your efforts have meant nothing, <name>!}}
:{{text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|The Legion is still only moments ahead of us. Take the portal back here and I will figure out where the Inquisitor has gone!}}
: ''A mage portal appears by [[Wrath-Scryer Soccothrates]]' usual spot.''
