==Objectives==
Enter an [[Invasion Point]] and defeat a Legion Commander.
*Invasion Point cleared

==Description==
The [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s fanatical [[Burning Crusade|crusade]] leaves them spread thin. As they focus their defenses on [[Argus]], we are free to tear into their forces on [[Great Dark Beyond|other worlds]].

Travel through an Invasion Point on Argus and show the Legion that there is no hiding from death.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|va=100}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
No [[demon]] is safe while I draw breath.

==Completion==
So many Legion worlds are ripe for the taking...
