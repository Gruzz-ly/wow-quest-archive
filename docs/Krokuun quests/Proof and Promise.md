'''Proof and Promise''' concludes the "Seeing Red" storyline of the [[Fury Incarnate campaign]], which unlocks the [[man'ari eredar]] appearance for [[Draenei (playable)|draenei]] characters.

==Objectives==
Deliver the Brilliant Star to Prophet Velen in [[Krokuun]].
*[[Brilliant Star]] (provided)
*[[Legion Teleporter]] located {{co|71.8|31.5|Krokuun}}
*Legion Teleporter used (Optional)
*Return to [[Velen]]

==Description==
Reinforcements are unlikely, but the relic is too important to risk. You should return to Prophet Velen with it immediately.

There is a teleporter just ahead that I can attune to a sigil of my own. It will provide you swift passage.

I will rejoin you later.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
*[[Mirror of Humility]]
*5x [[Drake's Dreaming Crest]]
*15x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
I sense something of great power in your possession.

It feels... familiar. But placing the memory feels like grasping at sunlight.

Did Arzal'kal lead you to something?

==Completion==
Is this...?

==Notes==
Head northeast to {{co|71.74|31.56|Krokuun}} and find the circle on the ground where Arzal'kal activates the teleporter:
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|[[Hatuun]] allowed me to prepare a way back for you. I must stay behind to close this path.}}

Before leaving, Arzal'kal has additional gossip:
{{dialogue|
It is imperative that the relic remains safe.

{{Gossip|What is this crystal we claimed from [[Speaker Nalridun|Nalridun]]?}}
{{dialogue-child|
It is a shard of the [[Ata'mal crystal]], a sacred relic from [[Argus]]. It was shattered when the [[draenei]] fled the planet. I am told it aided their escape.

Broken though it may be, a single shard of this crystal contains unimaginable power.

The pieces lost to Prophet Velen have moved through many hands. Nalridun is merely the most recent to possess this one.

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}}}
{{Gossip|Why are you giving the shard back to the draenei?}}
{{dialogue-child|
When I said I would give my life to reclaim the shard for the draenei, I meant it.

When we joined [[Sargeras]], whether willing or deceived, we broke our people. Scattered them across the cosmos. The hunters and the hunted.

We can never mend what was broken. There are no bones to set, no flesh to seal--just cinders. Who can put a body back together from the ashes?

Perhaps Velen can. He was always a healer, after all.

But the only thing I can do is return this shard. I can help mend the crystal, if nothing else.

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}}}}}

Take the teleporter, then follow the path back up and approach Velen:
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|<Name> returns unharmed.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|I expected they would, one way or another. Otherwise I would not have sent them alone.}}

On completion:
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|It cannot be... and yet I behold it. A shard of the Ata'mal crystal. Brilliant Star, it was called.}}
:''Velen places the crystal and Arzal'kal walks up the path.''
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|This shard was lost to me on [[Draenor]], taken by the [[orc]]s. I had thought it gone forever.}}
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|Nearly. When the orcs disposed of it after their corruption, [[Kil'jaeden]] reclaimed it for the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].}}
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|Many seized it since the Deceiver's death. But I could not let it remain in their bloodied hands.}}
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|I was willing to die for it. I sought out the [[Argussian Reach|krokul]]. And then I sought out you.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|There are no words to express my gratitude.}}
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|I do not deserve your gratitude. I should have done this sooner.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|I understand. I also have been forced to make difficult choices. At [[Eredath]] and [[Shattrath]].}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|But forgiveness is not easily given. Too many have suffered.}}
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|I do not expect forgiveness. I cannot be forgiven. Not in a thousand lifetimes.}}
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|But if this twisted soul can still do any good, I will see it done.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|Others have proven stronger than their darkness. The orcs, [[death knight]]s, and [[Illidari]]. Perhaps there is a path forward.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|There is much I would like to discuss with you, Arzal'kal, and others who believe as you do.}}
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|Please, just... Arzaal. If I may return, I would have it be with the name I had when I left.}}
:''Arzal'kal's name changes to Arzaal.''
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|Very well. Come, Arzaal.}}
:''Velen approaches the kneeling Arzaal, the man'ari stands up, and Velen then takes the crystal back.''
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|Hatuun, please think on my offer.}}
:{{Text|emote|Hatuun eyes Velen seriously, then looks away with a wordless nod.}}
:''Velen and Arzaal disappear into the tunnel.''
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|I... did not expect Velen to react this way. He did not have to.}}
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|Perhaps things are different now. Perhaps we both are. I will... allow myself to hope.}}
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|Before you leave, speak with [[Gaal]], our blacksmith. We have some things of value if you have resources to trade.}}

Completing this quest also awards [[Seeing Red (achievement)]]. Follow up with Gaal back in the main area of [[Krokul Hovel]] to pick up [[Scavenged Artifacts]], which adds additional items to his inventory.
