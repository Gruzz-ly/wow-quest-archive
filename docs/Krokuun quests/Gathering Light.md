==Objectives==
Meet [[Turalyon]] in the [[Krokul Hovel]].
* Use the [[Navigation Console]] to go to the Krokul Hovel (Optional)
* Meet Turalyon in Krokuun
* Reach the [[Shattered Fields]]
* Reach the [[Xenedar]]

==Description==
[[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] and I long for more time with [[Arator the Redeemer|our son]], but we cannot afford to wait any longer, <name>. We must strike now.

The [[Army of the Light]] is scattered, but not defeated. Any survivors should have stayed near the crash site of the Xenedar. If there is any hope of victory, we must rally them and rescue [[Xe'ra]].

With the [[pit lord]]s dealt with, we should have a safer route to the Xenedar. Meet me in the krokul hovel as soon as you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|85|}}

==Completion==
We've secured a foothold. Good.

Now we take the fight to them!

==Notes==
;Quest accept
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|Son, there is so much more we have to say, but our allies at the Xenedar will soon be overrun.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|You must go to their aid, Turalyon. I will scout behind enemy lines and provide a distraction. We will return soon, Arator.}}
:{{text|say|Arator the Redeemer|I... understand. [[Light]] be with you both.}}
:{{text|say|[[Vereesa Windrunner]]|Stay safe. We will gather the others and prepare for the battle to come.}}
:''Turalyon and Alleria depart from the [[Vindicaar]].''
:{{text|say|Arator the Redeemer|It pains me to see them go, Aunt Vereesa. I could not bear to lose them now, not after waiting all these years.}}
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|Have patience, Arator. It may take time, but your family will be made whole again. I know it.}}
:{{text|say|Arator the Redeemer|No doubt my mother will soon ask about [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]]. What are you going to tell her?}}
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|It is a conversation I know we must have, but the thought of it fills me with dread. How can I explain to Alleria what our sister has become? The truth will break her heart.}}

;Meet Turalyon
:{{text|say|[[Chieftain Hatuun]]|My scouts found the remains of [[Aggonar]]. We are in your debt, High Exarch. And yours, outlander.}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] will only fall if we stand together, chieftain. And right now, we have friends facing grave peril.}}
:{{text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|There is a way. We will use what power we have to help you.}}
:''Hatuun uses his powers to clear away rubble, revealing...''
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|A tunnel! So this is how you have survived...}}
:{{text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|We have hidden. We have adapted. In our hour of need, this land still listens to our pleas.}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|I will go on ahead and clear a path. The bridge leading to the [[Xenedar]] seems to be the least guarded. Light be with us.}}

;Reaching the Shattered Fields
:''As you ride, the bodies of deceased Army of the Light members are starting to be seen. When you reach the bridge, Turalyon is facing a [[demonic tyrant]].''
:{{text|say|[[Taraafash]]|You're not going anywhere, "champion." The master has plans for you!}}
:{{text|say|[[Captain Fareeya]]|Not today, monster! The Light prevails!}}
:''The Lightforged warrior appears, killing Taraafash.''
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|Fareeya! You survived!}}
:{{text|say|Captain Fareeya|You know that I refuse to die while the Legion still stands, High Exarch. Follow me. We've set up a perimeter.}}
