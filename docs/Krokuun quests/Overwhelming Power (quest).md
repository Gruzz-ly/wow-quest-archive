==Objectives==
Kill 12 demons.
* Demons slain  (12)
* Meet [[Illidan Stormrage]] at the [[Crown of Destruction]]

==Description==
We will find no sanctuary on this world. Even now the full might of the [[Burning Legion]] rises to defend [[Argus]].

The siege camp below overflows with demon filth that stand between us and the weapon trained on the [[Vindicaar]].

They must be dealt with before it can fully charge, or Argus will be our grave.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Darkfall Arcanum
|Doomcaller Heart
|Devastator Anchor Crystal
|Volatile Devastator Round
|Felbound Drudge's Sorrow
|Crest of the Grand Army
|Manacle of Dominance
|Mark of Defiant Survival
|Scarwing Talon
|Grinning Vilefiend Skull
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
Is the way to the weapon clear?

==Completion==
Now for the main weapon.

==Notes==
While fighting demons and destroying [[devastator]] barriers, pick up [[A Stranger's Plea]] from [[Chieftain Hatuun]]. You will need to complete the quest (alongside the two you're already on) to progress to the next part.
