==Objectives==
Watch as [[Gaal]] reforges the Armory Key.
*Wait as the Key is Reforged

==Description==
The armory key fragments are gathered, and the dendrite clusters should provide just enough power to reforge the key.

This should not take long... assuming it works. It has been a long time since I made one of these!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|85|}}
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Progress==
Bear with me as I finish my work.

==Completion==
Success! It is nice to know I haven't lost my touch.

Here you go <name>, it is as good as new.
