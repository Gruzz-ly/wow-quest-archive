Find [[Xe'ra]] within the [[Xenedar]].
* [[Teleportation Crystal(object)|Teleportation Crystals]] placed (3)
* Xe'ra rescued

==Description==
We must know for sure whether the Light Mother survived, <name>.

Xe'ra was weakened by sending [[Light's Heart|her heart]] to [[Azeroth]], but she is the [[Prime Naaru|prime naaru]]. She is the [[Light]], and she cannot fade.

Let's head into the Xenedar and look for her. Light willing, she will return to guide us once more.

*{{cost|14|60|}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
Light Mother... you must have survived...

==Completion==
Light be praised! This was a dark day, and many lives were lost.

But the [[Army of the Light|Army]] endures. The Light Mother's prophecy will be fulfilled.

All is as it was meant to be.

==Notes==
Once you have placed the teleportation crystals, right-click Xe'ra to finish things up.
