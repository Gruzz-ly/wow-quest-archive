==Objectives==
Meet your escort to the [[Exodar]] at [[Stormwind Harbor]].

* (Optional) Take the [[Dalaran]] portal to [[Stormwind]]
* Meet escort at Stormwind Harbor

==Description==
;Automatic
<Name>,

We have won many battles against the [[Burning Legion]], but it is time to end this war once and for all.

Final preparations have begun to depart for [[Argus]].

Make haste to Stormwind Harbor.  A ship awaits you there to grant you and your allies passage to [[Azuremyst]].

;Archmage Khadgar
Ever since the Legion invaded the Exodar, the [[draenei]] have been hard at work preparing to return to Argus.  At long last they have a vessel that can take us there.

With the way to that dreadful world open, we simply could not ask for a better opportunity to strike.  [[Prophet Velen]] called for you quite specifically to join the assault force.

You should make your way to Stormwind Harbor right away.  Arrangements have been made for a ship there to take you to Azuremyst. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|94|}}

==Completion==
I'm glad you were among those called for the expedition to Argus.  There will be plenty of fighting ahead.
