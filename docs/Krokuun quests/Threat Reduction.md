==Objectives==
Slay Kar'aaz, Xeth'tal, and Magraloth in the [[Annihilan Pits]].

* [[Kar'aaz]] slain
* [[Xeth'tal]] slain
* [[Magraloth]] slain

==Description==
In time, [[Chieftain Hatuun|Hatuun]] and his people will set aside their bitterness and become valuable allies. But their trust must be earned.

He says their village is beset by a demon called [[Aggonar]] and his cruel kin.

We need these fiends out of the way before we can seek out [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] and the others.

The chieftain lent us his horn. Use it to call down his people's vengeance upon the demon lieutenants while I carve a path to Aggonar's lair.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|14|60|}}
|Krokul Battle Horn
}}

==Progress==
Has the threat been dealt with?

==Completion==
Now that their lords have been reduced to ash, we may strike at the heart of their power.

==Gains==
* +150 reputation with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Notes==
Save Kar'aaz for last since the path past him leads to the [[Seat of Annihilation]], where Turalyon awaits. Blow the horn to summon [[Krokul Ridgestalker]]s to your help.
