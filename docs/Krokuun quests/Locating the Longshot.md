==Objectives==
Find [[Baraat the Longshot]].

==Description==
We're going to need a bigger gun if we hope to free [[Xe'ra]].

One of the other [[bunker]]s crashed closer to the [[Xenedar]]. If Baraat was on it, he will have already begun surveying the area. Perhaps he's found the main cannon of the ship.

If you head over that way, make sure he hasn't died, will you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|85|}}
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Completion==
We're under too much pressure here. And it's so close to us...

==Notes==
Travel north from [[Archmage Y'mera]] to find Baraat the Longshot.

==Progression==
{{The Hand of Fate}}

==Patch changes==
