Our fight against the [[Burning Legion]] continues.

:{{gossip|I am ready, High Exarch.}}

::{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|For millennia, the [[Army of the Light]] has waged war upon the Burning Legion. Battles. Skirmishes. Sabotage.}}
::{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|We were committed to our cause. Either we would end the Legion's [[Burning Crusade]]... or they would end ours.}}
::{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|When at last our final assault on [[Argus]] began, we knew we might not survive it. And when the [[Xenedar]] was hit, it seemed all hope was lost.}}
::{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|But the [[Light]] never abandoned us. It called ''you'' here and gave us another chance at victory. What we do with that chance... that is up to us.}}
