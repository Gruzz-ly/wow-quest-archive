==Objectives==
Return to the Vindicaar.

* (Optional) Lightforged Beacon used

==Description==
That [[pit lord]] won't trouble our new allies any longer.

<[[Turalyon]]'s brow furrows.>

Until another takes its place, at least. If there's one thing I've learned in our endless war against the [[Burning Legion|Legion]], it's to savor victories as you find them.

Come, let us take a moment to regroup back at your vessel. [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] and I have been waiting a long time for a reunion with [[Arator the Redeemer|our son]].

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|85|}}

==Completion==
Our absence has wounded Arator. We knew it would. But we had to know that he was safe while we fought the Legion.

Now that we are reunited, I will not let us be separated again.
