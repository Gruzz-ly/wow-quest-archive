==Objectives==
Search for signs of resistance.

* Search for signs of resistance
* Meet [[Prophet Velen]] outside the [[Krokul Hovel]]

==Description==
Our forces sustained heavy losses defending the [[Vindicaar]], <name>. We require allies.

The [[Army of the Light]] was known to take in survivors of the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s crusade to bolster their ranks. We must do the same.

I sense the presence of the Legion slaves you freed nearby. I suspect that they have carved out a resistance against their masters.

I would appreciate your company, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|85|}}

==Completion==
This must be it.

==Notes==

:{{text|say|[[Illidan Stormrage]]|We won't be able to sustain another attack from one of those creatures. We ''must'' bolster our forces.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|The [[krokul]] slaves fled somewhere further down the [[Darkfall Ridge|ridge]] as they were freed. They could not have gone far.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|They could be valuable allies in our fight.}}
:{{text|say|Illidan Stormrage|You assume much of their loyalties. Risk your life if you must. I will prepare our forces for the inevitable counterattack.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|As you wish. Come, <name>. I can feel their presence not far from here.}}
:''Velen mounts up as he speaks then heads out, making conversation along the way.''
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Not all my people left [[Argus]] when [[Archimonde]] and [[Kil'jaeden]] made their pact with the Dark Titan.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Many joined the Legion willingly, giving in to [[Sargeras]]' false promises of glory and power.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Those who realized the truth sought escape, but found themselves trapped in this nightmare. How they have survived this long I do not know.}}

If you explore [[Darkfall Ridge]] again before to take the quest, you will see many NPCs from the ''[[Vindicaar]]'', including [[Lady Liadrin]], [[Aethas Sunreaver]] and the [[Light's Chosen]]. Some of them are busy looking at the corpses of demons or exploring the ruins.
