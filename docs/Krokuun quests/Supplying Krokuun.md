Collect 150 Order Hall Resources.
*[[Order Resources]] (150)

==Description==
This desolate place offers little for my people. Every hour is spent scraping together enough to survive. If I had more supplies, I could offer you another ridgestalker.

What say you, offworlder?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Progress==
This desolate place offers little for my people. Every hour is spent scraping together enough to survive. If I had more resources, I could offer you a ridgestalker.
