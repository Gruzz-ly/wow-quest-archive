==Objectives==
Speak to Chieftain Hatuun in [[Krokuun]].
*Ask [[Grand Artificer Romuul|Romuul]] to teleport you to [[Krokuun]] (Optional)
*Speak to [[Chieftain Hatuun]] {{co|53.74|68.12|Krokuun}}

==Description==
Scattered visions came to me as I meditated. Yellow and red. Shattering glass. A rush of warmth. I see my own hand, but I am afraid to grasp it. The scent of [[fel]]--of [[Argus]].

When I awoke, a message had been delivered. Hatuun wishes to meet.

After the [[Argus Campaign|defeat]] of the [[Burning Legion|Legion]], I offered to help Hatuun and [[Argussian Reach|his people]] rejoin us. However, they chose to remain on Argus. 

Hatuun has seldom reached out to us since then. Perhaps he has reconsidered.

I will make the journey to Krokuun. Please, join me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I did not expect Velen to come. He has surprised me.

==Completion==
Let us see if Velen delivers the aid he once promised.

There is nothing preventing him this time.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|In the time that has passed, Hatuun and his people have continued to reclaim Argus from the Legion. Perhaps he has made progress.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|Let Romuul know when you are ready to depart.}}

Velen has new gossip:
{{dialogue|
The message Hatuun sent to us was not desperate.

Whatever he intends to discuss, it is clear he is not requesting help.

{{Gossip|Who is Hatuun?}} 
{{Dialogue-child|
Hatuun is the chieftain of the [[krokul]] on Argus, those who remained on the planet when the rest of fled abroad the [[Genedar]].

He was once of my council and one my dearest friends. I still hold fondness for him, though he holds little for me.

My heart breaks for what he has endured.}}

{{Gossip|Wasn't the Legion defeated?}} 
{{Dialogue-child|
Their leaders were slain and [[Sargeras]] imprisoned, but the Legion itself is vast.

Our mission to wipe them out is far from over.
}}}}

Speak with [[Romuul]]:

{{dialogue|
Are you ready for the mission ahead, <name>?

The surface of Argus is still overrun with [[demon]]s, but our transport beacons are online and operational.

I will take that as a good sign.

{{Gossip|quest=|Please teleport me to Krokuun.}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|Confirming beacon coordinates...}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|Beacon locked. Initiating transport to Argus. Good luck, <name>.}}

This drops players off at the [[Krokul Hovel]] in [[Krokuun]]. Ignore the Chieftain Hatuun in front that offers a daily quest, but instead take the tunnel at {{co|55.45|68.34|Krokuun}} to the west to find Prophet Velen and Chieftain Hakuun on the other side, overlooking the ''[[Xenedar]]''.
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|Hatuun, it is good to see you well. I had been concerned that--}}
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|Spare me your talk of concern. I did not call you here for pleasantries.}}

Speak with Hatuun:

{{dialogue|
Words cannot be believed. Only actions.

That is why Velen must be here in the flesh.

{{Gossip|quest=|What did you want to discuss?}}
}}
[[File:Velen binds Arzal'kal.jpg|thumb|[[Velen]] bind [[Arzal'kal]] with the [[Light]].]]
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|I have made an ally. One who wishes to meet with you.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|I would be honored to meet with any friend of yours. Who is this ally?}}
:{{Text|say|Unknown|It is I.}}
:''[[Arzal'kal]] emerges from the tunnel, and Velen binds him with Holy Shackles.''
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|You have allied with the Legion?}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|I would have given you any aid they could offer!}}
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|I expected these accusations.}}
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|Even after you fled Argus, never returning for those you left behind, you would accuse me of--}}
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|Please.}}
:{{Text|say|Arzal'kal|Please hear me. I-- I have risked everything to speak with you.}}
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|Speak with him, "Prophet."}}
:{{Text|emote|Velen peers at Hatuun for a long moment.}}
:''Velen cancels the bonds and Arzal'kal approaches.''

After the event, Velen and Arzal'kal have new gossip:

{{dialogue|title=Velen|<Velen frowns to himself, clearly in deep contemplation.>}}

{{dialogue|title=Arzal'kal|
I am not here to fight.

Only to be heard.
