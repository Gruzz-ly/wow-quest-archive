==Objectives==
Mark the Argussian Heartwells for the [[Vindicaar]]'s guns, kill the Legion garrison, and retrieve the Fel Heart of Argus from [[High Inquisitor Raalgar]].
* Demon Garrison slain (8)
* Heartwells Marked (3)
* [[Fel Heart of Argus (quest item)]]

==Description==
I have learned much. High Inquisitor Raalgar has moved to a base near the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] citadel across the mountains. This is where he keeps the Fel Heart of Argus, the source of his immortality, and it is powered by wells leading directly to the core of [[Argus]]. 

He is preparing to attack so you will strike first. Mark the location of the wells and I will rain holy fire upon them with the Vindicaar's guns. With that connection to the [[fel]] on Argus broken, Raalgar can be killed and the Fel Heart retrieved.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you: [[Fel Heart of Argus]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
Have you dealt with High Inquisitor Raalgar yet?

==Completion==
You are a true hero, <name>. Even though the demons freed Raalgar and thought him immortal, he was no match for you! Perhaps the Fel Heart will be of use to you. It is now available in the [[Vindicaar Matrix Core|Matrix Core]].

==Notes==
Use the [[Navigation Console]] to teleport to the [[Lightforged beacon]] at [[Destiny Point]] in [[Krokuun]], then travel north and take the northeast path when you reach the three-way fork. You should eventually reach the [[High Inquisitor's Lair]].
