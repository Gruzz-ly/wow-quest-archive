==Objectives==
Search the battlefield for [[Burning Legion|Legion]] troops and kill them to get their Enigmatic Legion Orders. Retrieve the Army of the Light Code Book to decipher the orders.
*[[Enigmatic Legion Orders]] (2)
*[[Army of the Light Code Book]]

==Description==
Our scout [[Skara]] writes in the missive that she learned of a major Legion initiative. She was after two encoded orders held by Legion troops near us to get the details and this must be when she was killed. The Legion splits their messages into encoded parts so that we cannot read them. 

Skara also writes that her partner [[Codebreaker Brae|Brae]], a codebreaker, was slain trying to reach our lines with a code book that we will need to translate the Legion's orders. It is vital you find the orders and that code book!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
Have you found the orders and the code book?

==Completion==
Skara and Brae gave their lives to get us this information and the codebook. Their sacrifice will not be forgotten.

Now, let us decipher the orders and see what the Legion is up to.
