==Objectives==
Activate the [[Sacred Stone]] to witness [[Argus]]' vision with [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]].

* Join Magni by the Sacred Stone
* Vision witnessed

==Description==
I've been hearin' whispers ever since we got to Argus. They're just like [[Azeroth (titan)|Azeroth]]'s, only... they ain't hers.

I'm convinced that Argus has a [[titan]] of its own that's reachin' out to us!

The [[broken]] have a relic stowed away that's darn near holy to 'em. [[Chieftain Hatuun|Hatuun]] says they hear whispers from it... I think it might have some sort o' link to Argus itself!

It's just in this chamber. Let's see what we can learn.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|94|}}

==Progress==
I know, I know, it's a lot to ask, but we need all the help we can get <lad/lass>!

==Completion==
I don't know how Sargeras managed to raise Aggramar, but it's bad news for us, believe you me.

== Trivia ==
* Aggramar kneeling before the fire of Sargeras and asking "What is your bidding, master?" may be a reference to Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, where Darth Vader kneels before a hologram of the Emperor and asks "What is thy bidding, my master?"
