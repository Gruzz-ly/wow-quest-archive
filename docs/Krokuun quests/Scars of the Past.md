==Objectives==
Recover an Invocation Array, Vindicator Plating, and a Judgment Core.
*[[Invocation Array]]
*[[Vindicator Plating]]
*[[Judgment Core]]

==Description==
The [[Army of the Light]]'s [[warframe]]s have won countless battles on [[Argus]]. Despite their power, not all who descend into the fray return.

My modifications to this frame should give us the edge we need, but several critical components are still missing.

There are remains of battles past in [[Nath'raxas Hold|Nath'raxas]] that we can still scavenge. If you can find the pieces I need, the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] will feel our fury yet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
Do you have the components?

==Completion==
Perfect! Thank you, <name>.

==Progression==
{{The Speaker Calls}}
