==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Vindicaar]] and ask [[Grand Artificer Romuul]] about [[High Inquisitor Raalgar]].
*Speak with Grand Artificer Romuul

==Description==
This report states that the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] seeks to free an imprisoned Legion [[inquisitor]] called Raalgar, a [[demon]] from here on [[Argus]] who cannot be killed because of a secret magic he alone possesses. 

Because of his immortality, he is held in the [[Arcatraz]] in [[Tempest Keep]].

The [[Xe'ra|Light Mother]] told us of that [[naaru]] stronghold, but I've never set eyes upon it myself, <name>. [[Turalyon]] mentioned the Vindicaar has some connection to Tempest Keep. Perhaps your ship's engineer knows more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Completion==
High Inquisitor Raalgar? A fearsome creature but he has been held securely in the Arcatraz at Tempest Keep for a very long time. 

If the Legion plans to free him then they must know that he is particularly dangerous to us.
