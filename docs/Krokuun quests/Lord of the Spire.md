==Objectives==
Defeat Lord Nath'raxas.
* [[Lord Nath'raxas]] slain
* Rejoin your forces
* Meet [[Turalyon]] on the [[Vindicaar]].

==Description==
Lord Nath'raxas rules over [[Nath'raxas Hold|this hold]] as thanks for his role in delivering [[Argus]] to the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] many years ago.

Make no mistake, he is powerful, but he has also grown overconfident in his seat.

Take advantage of his hubris and make use of the warframe's firepower while you can. We will storm the courtyard shortly!

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: {{Abilities|Nath'raxas Hold World Quests|id=252574|icon=spell_warlock_demonicempowerment}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|58|20|}}
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Completion==
By the [[Light]]...

;Enter [[Nath'raxas Spire]]
:{{text|yell|Lord Nath'raxas|Nothing you have done here matters, mortal. We are infinite. We are Legion.}}

;Lord Nath'raxas fight
:{{text|say|Lord Nath'raxas|You ally yourselves with the traitorous [[draenei]] and their [[Light]], yet it leaves you so weak.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Nath'raxas|This hold is but an echo of the grandeur of [[Antorus, the Burning Throne|Antorus]].}}
:{{text|say|Lord Nath'raxas|I eagerly await your agonized screams resonating through its halls.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Nath'raxas|Your hubris overcomes you.}}
:''Lord Nath'raxas destroys the [[:Lightforged Warframe]], but the [[adventurer]] fights on.''
:{{text|say|Lord Nath'raxas|It matters not. I will end this.}}

;Death

:''On returning to the courtyards, the adventurer is cheered at.''

;Cutscene
:''The forces of the [[Army of the Light]] are teleported out while the adventurer continues to walk further into the courtyard. Suddenly, [[Aggramar]] lands in front of them. The adventurer draws out their weapon while Aggramar draws [[Taeshalach]], which ignites with fiery energy. Aggramar brings his massive weapon up with both hands above his head and proceeds to swing it down towards the adventurer — who is fortunately teleported to the ''Vindicaar'' at the last moment.''

;Meet Turalyon
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|So what [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]] saw was true. Aggramar lives once more... in the service of Sargeras.}}
:{{text|say|[[Alleria Windrunner]]|The power at their command is immeasurable. The Vindicaar cannot withstand their assault.}}
:{{text|say|[[Illidan Stormrage]]|The [[titan]] [[Worldsoul|soul]] of Argus is the key to breaking the Legion. Our defenses must hold long enough to destroy it... or Sargeras wins.}}
