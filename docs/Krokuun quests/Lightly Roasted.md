==Objectives==
Use [[Light's Judgment (item)]] to destroy the rubble blocking the entrance to the [[Xenedar]].
* Rubble cleared

==Description==
Can you hear me, <name>? Good.

Light's Judgment has been installed on the [[Vindicaar]]. We should be able to harness its power immediately.

We can use it both to clear the rubble blocking the Xenedar as well as destroy our enemies.

As with any new piece of technology, we should test it out. Thoroughly. I trust you have plenty of targets down there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Completion==
Excellent! The path is clear.

==Notes==
Upon accepting the quest, you will be granted the following: {{Abilities|Light's Judgment|''Fire the main weapon of the Vindicaar, dealing 80000 to 120000 Holy damage to all affected enemies and stuns them for 5 sec.''|id=248150|icon=inv_lightforgedmatrixability_lightsjudgment}}

Head east from the image of Romuul to find and destroy the rubble. [[Blademaster Telaamon]] is holding the entrance against demons.
