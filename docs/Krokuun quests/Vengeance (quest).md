==Objectives==
Destroy the siege weapon at the [[Crown of Destruction]].
* [[Antaen Light-Breaker|Siege Weapon]] destroyed

The [[Army of the Light]] will not have fallen in vain.

Our forces will assault the main encampment while we destroy their siege weapon.

This will be but the beginning of our vengeance.

*{{cost|19|40|}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Progress==
Until their weapon is no longer a threat, we are cornered here like vermin.

==Completion==
It seems we underestimated the Legion's cunning.
