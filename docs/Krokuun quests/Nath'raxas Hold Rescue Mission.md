==Objectives==
Use the [[Scouting Map]] and complete the mission, "[[Nath'raxas Breakout]]".

==Description==
Your forces are adequately equipped for the mission to save my people from [[Nath'raxas Hold|Nath'raxas]]. Order your champions to bolster my assault, and together we will dismantle the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s stranglehold over the region.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[Krokuun Missions]]

You will also receive:
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Progress==
Why do you delay, <name>?

==Completion==
We were a great civilization, once. But, now?... Thank you, <name>. Our combined forces freed many from Nath'raxas. With fewer slaves, and the [[Army of the Light]] on their doorstep, the Legion's influence over this region will be greatly diminished.
