==Objectives==
Rescue 10 Darkfallen Slaves from the [[Annihilan Pits]].
* [[Darkfallen Slave]]s rescued (10)

==Description==
[[Chieftain Hatuun|Hatuun]]'s people have endured arduous times. Their numbers dwindle as those ripped from beyond the walls of their sanctuary become servants to the [[annihilan]] lords in the pits just beyond, sentenced to a life of labor, torture and ultimately, death.

Seek out these captives, release them from their bonds and show our allies we stand as one against the [[Burning Legion]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Progress==
Forging a bond of trust is no easy task.

==Completion==
Hatuun's people will greatly appreciate what you've done for them.

==Notes==
Free the slaves that are located inside cages on the ground, or are cowering in place.
