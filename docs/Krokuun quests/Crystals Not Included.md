==Objectives==
Collect 10 Argunite Crystals.
* [[Argunite Crystal]] (10)

==Description==
[[Turalyon]] is safe, and we can start to fight back.

First things first, we must secure what supplies we can from the crash.

Even though we are blessed by the [[Light]], our ships still rely on crystal technology. From powering our defenses to arming our weapons, we will need to collect as much as we can to fight back against the enemy.

Venture out into the crash and retrieve what crystals you can. While you are out there, keep an eye out for [[Archmage Y'mera|Y'mera]]. She was separated from us, and will need help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
I hope you brought backup with you.

==Completion==
You brought crystals with you? Thank the Light, that's just what we need!

==Progression==
