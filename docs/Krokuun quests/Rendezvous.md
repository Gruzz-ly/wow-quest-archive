==Objectives==
Use the [[Signal Crystal]] to call down a [[Lightforged beacon|Lightforged Beacon]] from the [[Vindicaar]].

==Description==
There is much to be done before this nightmare can end, but we need to regroup before we draw more attention from the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].

I managed to retain a signal crystal during the crash used to call transport beacons from the [[Xenedar]].

With luck, we should be able to use it to establish a link between here and your forces as well.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[Lightforged Beacon: Krokul Hovel]]

You will also receive: {{cost|4|85|}}

==Progress==
We must establish a link to your vessel before we can press on.

==Completion==
[[Lothraxion]] is an old friend, and a noble warrior. We are fortunate to have him among us.

==Notes==
;Beacon called down
:''Lothraxion teleports down from the Vindicaar and walks up the ramp.''
:{{text|say|Lothraxion|[[Turalyon]]! I am pleased you continue to thwart the Legion's best efforts to kill you.}}
:{{text|say|Lothraxion|What of [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]]? Is she...?}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|The last time I saw her was on the Xenedar. She was still... under guard.}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|Alleria's still out there somewhere, old friend. I know it. And other survivors as well.}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|But thousands of demons stand between us and our allies. We must thin the Legion's ranks to have any hope of reaching the Xenedar alive.}}
:{{text|say|Lothraxion|Then that is what we will do, High Exarch.}}
