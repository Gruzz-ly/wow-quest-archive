==Objectives==
[[Chronicler To'kini]] at [[Zim'Torga]] wants you to recover 10 Har'koan Relics.
*[[Har'koan Relic]] (10)

==Description==
I overheard that you are going to see to the well-being of [[Har'koa]]. Good luck to you.

I am wondering if while you are in the vicinity of the altar, you would be willing to recover their relics? I do not require many, and it is only a short trip to the southeast.

What do you say?

==Progress==
The [[Drakkari]] are so busy destroying themselves, it would be a shame if the historical significance of their empire were to be likewise lost.

==Completion==
Aw, prime specimens!

You can see there the divergence from the root symbology. Quite extraordinary.

What a pity that the [[ice troll]]s are determined to bring about their own demise.

Did you know, for instance, that the Drakkari were exiled from the rest of the troll nations for their extremely violent ways?

It's true! How did you think trolls ended up in such a harsh climate as this?

==Notes==
You must complete [[Breaking Through Jin'Alai]] before you can accept this quest.
