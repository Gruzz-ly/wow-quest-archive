== Objectives ==
[[Quetz'lun's Spirit]] at the [[Altar of Quetz'lun]] wants you to use [[Quetz'lun's Hexxing Stick]] upon [[High Priest Mu'funu]], [[High Priestess Tua-Tua]], and [[High Priest Hawinni]]. Once you have done this, slay them.
* [[High Priest Mu'funu]] hexed at death
* [[High Priestess Tua-Tua]] hexed at death
* [[High Priest Hawinni]] hexed at death

== Description ==
It is now time for you to punish my three high priests: Mu'funu, Tua-Tua, and Hawinni. You'll find them spread around the altar grounds.

Take this hexxing stick. I've empowered it with my rage and indignation. I'm sure that it will prove potent.

Just use it and proceed to destroy them. The hex will take care of the rest.

<Quetz'lun displays a toothy grin.>

Succeed and I may let you go. Fail and die. 
* [[Quetz'lun's Hexxing Stick]] (provided)

== Progress ==
DO YOU THINK THAT I'M A FOOL?

THEY'RE NOT DEAD!

== Completion ==
<The terrible spirit before you lets loose a blood-chilling cackle.>

They had it coming. And I'll give them more of the same again and again and again....

== Rewards ==
