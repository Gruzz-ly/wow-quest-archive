==Objectives==
[[Captain Rupert]] has asked you to collect 10 Chunks of Saronite and deliver them to [[Eitrigg]] at [[The Argent Stand]].
* [[Chunk of Saronite]]: (10)

==Description==
We know that [[Kolramas]], the crashed [[necropolis]] to the southeast, was carrying a large amount of an ore known as [[saronite]] when the trolls shot it down.

My scouts tell me that much of the saronite is strewn about within the innards of that thing.

Eitrigg and his friends back at The Argent Stand want a bunch of the stuff so that they can study it.

I want you to head in there and see if you can collect enough for them. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Soothsayer's Shoulderpads|Gloves of Swift Death|Boots of the Altar|Ritualistic Band of Light}}
You will also receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Progress==
Yes, <class>?

Please tell me that you have the saronite that we requested Captain Rupert to acquire?

==Completion==
Can you not feel the pure evil of the stuff?

We must use the expertise and magics at our disposal, combined with the power of the Holy Light, to pierce the veil of iniquity surrounding this tainted ore. We must determine its origins.

Quickly, hand the saronite to me!

==Notes==
On completion:
:{{text|emote|The avenger snorts, clearly unimpressed.}}
:''[[Eitrigg]] walks over to the brazier and puts down the ore sample.''
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Now we will see why this ore is so important to the [[Scourge]].}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|[[Crusade Commander Korfax|Korfax]], what can you tell from this [[saronite]]?}}
:{{text|say|Crusade Commander Korfax|Saronite you say?}}
:''Korfax walks over.''
:{{text|say|Crusade Commander Korfax|Never heard of it. Looks like pure evil.}}
:{{text|say|Crusade Commander Korfax|Let's see how it holds up to the might of my axe!}}
:''Korfax takes a few swings, but his reaper bounces right off.''
:{{text|say|Crusade Commander Korfax|What the? My reaper didn't even scratch it! That's the toughest ore I've ever seen!}}
:{{text|emote|[[Avenger Metz]] rolls his eyes.}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|[[Rayne]], [[Rimblat Earthshatter|Rimblat]], what about the power of nature and the elements?}}
:{{text|say|Rimblat Earthshatter|Let us see if it is truly impervious.}}
:''Rimblat and Rayne cast a [[shaman]] and [[druid]] spell on the saronite.''
:{{text|say|Rayne|By the [[Elune|Goddess]]. It's as if Nature can't touch it!}}
:{{text|say|Rimblat Earthshatter|Nothing.}}
:{{text|say|Avenger Metz|No surprise there.}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Metz?}}
:{{text|say|Avenger Metz|What?}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|You know what.}}
:{{text|say|Avenger Metz|Fine. Just remember, though. The power of the [[Light|Holy Light]] isn't something to be invoked casually, brother.}}
:''Metz casts [[Hammer of Wrath]] on the ore.''
:{{text|say|Avenger Metz|What's it doing?!}}
:''The assembled party and many npcs nearby get knocked flat by an explosion of some sort.''
:{{text|say|Avenger Metz|Woah!}}
:{{text|say|Crusade Commander Korfax|Oof!}}
:{{text|say|Rayne|Gah!}}
:{{text|emote|Eitrigg dusts himself off.}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Clearly this is getting us nowhere. We need to get this saronite to [[Tirion Fordring|Highlord Fordring]] for further study.}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Thank you for trying, my friends. We'll unlock its secrets. Hopefully before it's too late.}}
:{{text|emote|Avenger Metz grunts.}}
