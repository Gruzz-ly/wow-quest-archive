==Objectives==
[[Har'koa]] at [[Zim'Torga]] has asked you to free [[Akali]] and then to inform [[Witch Doctor Khufu]] at [[Zim'Torga]].
* Akali unfettered from his chains.
* [[Key of Warlord Zol'Maz (key)]] (provided)

==Description==
<Name>, there is no time left. You must take the key and use it to unlock Akali.

He is being held in the courtyard in front of [[Gundrak]], the capital of [[Zul'Drak]]. Akali's chains are secured by four anchor points. You must unlock each of them to set the [[Loa|rhino god]] free.

Gundrak is teeming with [[ice troll]]s. However, I believe that if you're careful, you should be able to slip in without too much danger.

Once you're done, please inform the witch doctor.

==Progress==
What happened?

==Completion==
No!

Another god destroyed, its power stolen. And now the [[prophet of Akali]] has threated us directly.

When he comes, he will come for Har'koa. We cannot allow him to take her power too.

We must consult the gods once more, <name>. They will tell us what must be done.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bloodbinder's Gloves
|Supple Vest of the Bloodletter
|Bloodletter's Headgear
|Ancestral War Boots}}

==Notes==
[[File:Prophet of Akali.jpg|thumb|The prophet draws Akali's powers.]]
Free Akali by using the key at the [[Akali Chain Anchor]], and he will punish his [[Akali Subduer|subduers]]. But it will draw the attention of his prophet as well, who will promptly slay him for his uprising.

''Akali kills dozens of Akali Subduers.''
:{{text|yell|[[Prophet of Akali]]|ENOUGH!}}
:{{text|yell|Prophet of Akali|And now, Akali, my master will have your blood and I will take some of your power as well!}}
''The Prophet kills Akali.''
:{{text|yell|Prophet of Akali|It is done. Run back to your masters. Run back to [[Har'koa]]. Tell her that I am coming!}}

After completing the quest, Khufu once again calls upon the animal gods.
:{{text|whisper|Har'koa|No, not Akali too!}}
:{{text|say|[[Halazzi]]|Once more we hear your call, Khufu. We have wisdom for you and <name>. You face great peril and must act swiftly or you all and Har'koa will die.}}
:{{text|say|[[Nalorakk]]|The unblemished heart of the guardian must be secured to show defiance and strength. Jealous [[Zim'Rhuk]] keeps those who harbor it.}}
:{{text|say|[[Jan'alai]]|The gusty essence of deceased [[Quetz'lun]]'s wardens must be gathered to draw him near. To Har'koa must both of these rarities be delivered.}}
:{{text|say|[[Akil'zon]]|And yet we see only doom in your future. It is your destiny that you do this, <name>, but we fear that the prophet is too powerful for you and your friends. Still, you must try.}}
