==Objectives==
[[Stefan Vadu|Stefan]] in [[Ebon Watch]] asked you to go to the [[Reliquary of Agony]] to collect 5 Putrid Abomination Guts from the [[Putrid Abomination]]s and 5 Gooey Ghoul Drools.
* [[Putrid Abomination Guts]]: (5)
* [[Gooey Ghoul Drool (item)]]: (5)

==Description==
Once the [[Scourge]] have a target in their sights, they'll stop at nothing to acquire it.

You're doomed to a mindless existence as a walking corpse....

<Stefan's face twists into a cruel grin.>

... unless we can use their desires against them.

I'll explain later. I have complex magic to prepare which requires certain material components.

Travel due east of here to the land beneath the Reliquary of Agony. Slay the ghouls and abominations you'll find there and return to me with their remnants. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Have you brought the components I asked for, <name>? 

==Completion==
<Stefan sifts through the foul components.>

Well, it's far from perfect, but it'll have to do.

Now brace yourself, <class>. This is where it gets good.... 

==Progression==
