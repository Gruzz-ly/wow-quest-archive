==Description==
Look at me, <race>. Do I look like I have time fer fillin' out reports?

It be all I can do to keep this post free o' the bloody [[Scourge]], and they want me to mess with paperwork!

<sigh> No sense in complainin'. I need to get the commander some kinda kill count from the last skirmish.

You wanna be helpful? Go and get me all the medals you can find from the dead trolls around here. That'll hafta be close enough. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|58}}

==Progress==
You get those medals for me, <race>?

==Completion==
Well, now!

Ya saved me a fair bit o' work there lad. I'm grateful. I'll be sure ta make mention of ya in me report.

Off with yeh now. [[Alchemist Finklestein|Finklestein'll]] likely be waitin fer ya a bit west o' here.
