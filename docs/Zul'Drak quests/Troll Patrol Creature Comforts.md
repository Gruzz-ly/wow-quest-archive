==Objectives==
[[Captain Grondel]] at [[Drak'Agal]] wants you to bring him 20 pieces of Dead Thornwood.
* [[Dead Thornwood]] (20)

==Description==
Well, it ain't glamorous, but it needs doin'.

My troops have been fightin' their hearts out while knee-deep in stagnant water for days on end. That just can't be good fer ya.

What they need is a nice fire to dry 'em out and lighten their spirits.

This part of the city's soaked, but the dead roots of these thornwood trees have a way of resistin' the moisture.

Round us up some fuel for burnin' and we'll be mighty grateful. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|58}}

==Progress==
Ya got the wood fer a fire, <race>?

==Completion==
Mighty kind of ya, <name>. Mighty kind indeed.

Now you'll be findin' Cap'n Arnath due west o' here, just over the rise.
