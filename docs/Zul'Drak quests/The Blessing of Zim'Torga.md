== Objectives ==
[[Witch Doctor Khufu]] wants you to present 10 [[Drakkari Offerings]] to the statue of [[Zim'Torga]].
* [[Drakkari Offerings]] (10)

== Description ==
[[Hexxer Ubungo]] probably told you about making offerings to the gods of Zul'Drak. [[Zim'Abwa]] is not the only god that stands forgotten by the [[Drakkari]].

We have taken refuge within the presence of Zim'Torga, the Mother of Prosperity. As with Zim'Abwa, if you were to give offerings of the Drakkari to her, she is sure to give you her blessing. 

== Rewards ==
The following spell will be cast on you:

== Completion ==
<Zim'Torga's thoughts pervade your own. She senses the offerings you are about to give to her and is pleased.>

<She conveys that you will be appropriately rewarded.>
