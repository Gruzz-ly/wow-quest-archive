== Objectives ==
[[Hexxer Ubungo]] at [[The Argent Stand]] wants you to acquire 3 [[Precious Elemental Fluids]].
* [[Precious Elemental Fluids]] (3)

== Description ==
<The hexxer examines the decanter of mojo.>

I have an idea for how to deal with the [[prophet of Sseratus]]. But first, we're going to need some things.

The [[Drak'Sotra Fields]] are directly to the south. Because of the stresses on the land from the [[Scourge]] and the deaths of gods, the wall between worlds has weakened and the elementals are flooding in.

We need the precious fluids of their lords. If you combine three links from the elementals a tether will be made, and one of their lords can be summoned. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bloodbinder's Raiment
|Bloodletter's Boots
|Gauntlets of the Great Sacrifice
|Chestplate of the Altar}}
You will also receive: {{cost|6|20}}

== Progress ==
Do you have the precious fluids?

== Completion ==
Excellent. When combined with the mojo, these fluids will dilute the effectiveness of the mojo without completely eliminating it.

Now, one more thing.

==Notes==
*Pick up [[The Drakkari Do Not Need Water Elementals!]] on the way out.
*The name of this quest may be a reference to [[Wikipedia:Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove]], where General Ripper is paranoid about a communist conspiracy to "sap and impurify" our "precious bodily fliuds."

==Progression==
