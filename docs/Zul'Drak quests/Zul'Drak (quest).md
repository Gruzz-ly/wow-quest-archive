==Objectives==
Report to [[Stefan Vadu]] at [[Ebon Watch]] in [[Zul'Drak]].

==Description==
Our [[death knight]] allies in Zul'Drak are in need of heroes to aid them in securing the [[Ice troll|troll]] lands from the [[Scourge]].

Those willing to aid should travel to the southwestern camp of Ebon Watch and speak with Stefan Vadu there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2,500 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Knights of the Ebon Blade]]

==Completion==
<Stefan reads the missive, then crumples it up and tosses it into the fire.>

Old news. The [[Argent Crusade]] is - once again - late to the party. We've been tracking [[Drakuru]] since [[Grizzly Hills]]. He is slated for eradication.
