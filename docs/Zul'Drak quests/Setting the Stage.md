==Objectives==
[[Quetz'lun's Spirit]] has demanded that you collect 10 Underworld Power Fragments. Return to her at the [[Altar of Quetz'lun]] only when you have done so.
*[[Underworld Power Fragment]] (10)

==Description==
I will give you a chance at continued existence.

There are fragments of the power that fueled my curse scattered about the altar grounds. It is my desire that you collect some of them for me. Not so many that the curse will be lifted, but enough that I will be able to eventually make use of them to exact revenge upon my prophet.

Go, insect. Run and do my bidding before I change my mind about letting you live. 

==Progress==
What a shame that [[Har'koa]] didn't send you along sooner. Then again, she and I never did get along.

She probably held back your help just long enough for this to happen.

==Completion==
They'll do. Likely I won't even need them.

But it was fun watching you run around at my command.

==Progression==
