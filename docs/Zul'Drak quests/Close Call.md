==Objectives==
[[Stefan Vadu|Stefan]] at [[Ebon Watch]] wants you to take the Writhing Choker to [[Bloodrose Datura]].
*Choker's purpose exposed
*[[Writhing Choker#Close Call]] (provided)

==Description==
It was either wisdom or luck that prevented you from wearing this choker, <race>.

Either way, your acquiring it was no random occurence. You've been targeted by someone, or something....

Take your choker to Bloodrose, here. Let her demonstrate the fate that nearly befell you.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3}}

==Progress==
Yes, <race>?

==Completion==
Now you've observed the fate that was meant to befall you.

As I mentioned before, this was no random act. The creation of such a device is very involved. You've somehow caught the attention of the Scourge leadership.

The question is not how, why, or even who... but what will we do about it? 

==Notes==
{{Cleanup-section}}
Tell Bloodrose Datura "Stefan told me you could demonstrate the purpose of this item."
:Bloodrose Datura says: Indeed. Watch this, <race>.
:Bloodrose Datura says: Here, troll... a gift!
:Captured Drakkari Scout says: For me? Really, mon?
:Captured Drakkari Scout says: It....it be beautiful!
:''The troll get sick and died. Datura sets it alight.''
:Bloodrose Datura says: Ugh... disgusting!
