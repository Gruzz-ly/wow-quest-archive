== Objectives ==
Collect 10 [[Muddlecap Fungus]] and deliver them to [[Hexxer Ubungo]] at [[The Argent Stand]].
* [[Muddlecap Fungus]] (10)

== Description ==
Now what we need is something to spike the mojo with. Something that'll make it so that when the prophet drinks it, he'll become less powerful.

[[Drak'Agal]] lies to the east. There's a mushroom there that the natives call muddlecap fungus. I think it's exactly what we need.

Bring back lots of them. When we mix them into the mojo, the mind of anyone who drinks it will become muddled. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

== Progress ==
Do you have all of the fungus?

Oh, and watch out for the basilisks lurking over there.

== Completion ==
<The hexxer nods his approval.>

Hand that fungus over and I'll mix it up with the mojo and elemental lord fluids.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Gluttonous Lurkers]] before heading out.
