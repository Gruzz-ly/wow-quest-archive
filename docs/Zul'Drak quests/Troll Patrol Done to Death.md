==Objectives==
[[Captain Rupert]] wants you to use the [[Incinerating Oil]] on 5 Defeated Argent Footmen in [[Drak'Sotra]].
* [[Defeated Argent Footman|Argent Footman]] Corpse Incinerated (5)

==Description==
Trust me, <race>. I know....

The smell of burnt flesh has become sickening to even me, a [[Forsaken]]. Nevertheless, it is our solemn duty to ensure that our brethren never walk with the [[Scourge]].

Pour this oil on the corpses of our fallen to ensure that we never face them on the battlefield as enemies. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|58}}

==Progress==


==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

It's not the most glorious job on the battlefield, but it must be done. I'll make note of your service in my report.

[[Captain Grondel]] is likely waiting for you to the northeast, just outside the [[Amphitheater of Anguish|amphitheater]].
