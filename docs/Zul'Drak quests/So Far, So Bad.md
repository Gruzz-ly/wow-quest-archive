==Objectives==
[[Stefan Vadu|Stefan]] at [[Ebon Watch]] wants you to return to [[Overlord Drakuru|Drakuru]] and complete any tasks he has for you.

While at the [[Reliquary of Pain]], you are to use the Diluting Additive on 5 Scourge Cauldrons.

If you lose your Ensorcelled Choker, return to Stefan at Ebon Hold to get another.
* Drakuru's task complete
* Blight Cauldrons diluted (5)
* [[Diluting Additive]] (provided)

==Description==
Everything you've reported is consistent with what we know. Learning of Drakuru and earning his trust will lay the groundwork for your future missions.

Return to him and do as he says. Do whatever you must to appear sincere, <name>. A great deal is riding upon your performance.

This time I'm adding an additional assignment: While you're in the field, pour this additive into their blight cauldrons. It should neutralize the scourging agent and render the batch useless. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Cords of Duplicity
|Subtle Boots of the Infiltrator
|Helm of Subtle Whispers
|Infiltrator's Shield}}
You will also receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Please, <name>, tell me you haven't blown your cover....

==Completion==
Nice work, <name>!

Diluting those cauldrons will not only save lives, it will slow the growth of the Scourge in this region.

Now come, tell me what you've learned of Drakuru's strategory in Zul'Drak.
