==Objectives==
Slay the Muddled [[Prophet of Sseratus]] and then return to [[Hexxer Ubungo]] at [[The Argent Stand]].
* [[Muddled Prophet of Sseratus]] slain
* [[Modified Mojo]] (provided)

==Description==
There. I've modified the mojo. Now when the prophet drinks it, not only will he lose some of his power, his mind will also be addled by the effects of the fungus.

At least that's the theory.

As for how to get him to drink it, might I suggest you simply throw it at him? No doubt he'll catch and drink it given the arrogance that he's displayed at the altar.

Unless you can kill him, <class>, your [[Argent Crusade]] is about to come to a terrible end. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Soothsayer's Garb
|Supple Wristguards
|Bloodbinder's Links
|Brazen Offender's Shoulderplates}}
You will also receive: {{cost|12|40}}

==Progress==
Is it over?

Did the modified mojo work?

Did you deliver vengeance for [[Sseratus]] by slaying his prophet?

==Completion==
Amazing! You've saved your people and the rest of [[Northrend]] from his madness.

Unfortunately there's more of this insanity occurring up in the higher tiers of Zul'Drak.

==Notes==
When you throw him the mojo:

{{text|yell|Prophet of Sseratus yells: Mmm, more mojo.}}

He will then buff himself with Vigor of Sseratus: Empowered by Sseratus. Attack and casting speed increased by 60%. Damage taken reduced by 30%. Lasts for 2 minutes.

{{text|yell|Prophet of Sseratus yells: NOOOOOOOOooooooo.........!}}

The Prophet will shrink down to regular size, becoming Muddled Prophet of Sseratus, and then attack you.
