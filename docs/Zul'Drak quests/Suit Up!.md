==Objectives==
[[Stefan Vadu|Stefan]] at [[Ebon Watch]] wants you to use the [[Ensorcelled Choker]] to apply the [[Scourge]] disguise.

While in Scourge form, you are to purchase Bitter Plasma from [[Gristlegut]].

If you lose your Ensorcelled Choker, return to Stefan at Ebon Watch to get another.
* [[Bitter Plasma]]

==Description==
There... I've created a disguise that should make you indistinguishable from the Scourge.

You'll be free to walk among them as long as the disguise holds. Only the blightguards will be able to see through my illusion. Watch out for them!

Another thing you must know is that the disguise is unstable and may drop unexpectedly, so stay alert.

Let's test it out. Use the choker and visit the Scourge vendor just east of here. Return to me with a bottle of bitter plasma. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|60}}

==Progress==
Well, <name>?

Did you purchase that flask? 

==Completion==
So? How are you enjoying Scourge life?

Believe me, it's not all it's cracked up to be....

==Progression==
{{Betrayal}}
