== Objectives ==
[[Har'koa]] at [[Zim'Torga]] has asked you to acquire the [[:Key of Warlord Zol'Maz]].
* [[Key of Warlord Zol'Maz]]

== Description ==
<Name>, we need a key to unlock the chains of the rhino god, [[Akali]]. Even now he is being prepared for the slaughter.

The [[Drakkari]] warlord, [[Warlord Zol'Maz|Zol'Maz]], carries the key. Hearing of your exploits, he has secluded himself and his family at their stronghold up the steps to the northeast.

The warlord is strong and you will need help. If you were to combine the tiki, sword and incantation of his family members, you would be able to summon such help as you challenge him before his home's gate.

== Progress ==
I cannot stress how important it is that you acquire the warlord's key no matter the cost.

== Completion ==
It might have been better if I hadn't asked you to bring it back here instead of heading directly to [[Gundrak]].

However, I think that it's best that you hear what else I have to say first.

== Notes ==
You will first need to find [[Tiri]]{{coords|63|37|Zul'Drak}}, [[Drek'Maz]]{{coords|68|35|Zul'Drak}} and [[Yara]]{{coords|67.9|32.7|Zul'Drak}} and loot their items to make [[Tiki Dervish Ceremony]]. All three of these Trolls are located in nearby buildings. Use it at the gates before [[Warlord Zol'Maz]] to engage him, as it will enrage him:
:{{text|yell|Warlord Zol'Maz|You have an [[Enchanted Tiki Dervish|enchanted tiki]]? YOU KILLED MY FAMILY!}}
:{{text|yell|Warlord Zol'Maz|I WILL KILL YOU, <name>!}}

The [[Enchanted Tiki Dervish|enchanted tiki]] is a consumable item and therefore if you don't kill [[Warlord Zol'Maz]] after using it, you will have to re-kill the family members to make another one.
