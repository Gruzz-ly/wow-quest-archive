== Objectives ==
The [[Spirit of Rhunok]] has asked you to use the [[Tormentor's Incense]] to awaken his body. You are then to slay [[Rhunok]] using the power that his spirit has imbued you with.

If for some reason you lose the [[Mojo of Rhunok]] aura, you can return to the Spirit of Rhunok to have it reapplied.
* [[Rhunok]] slain

== Description ==
My body is too far gone now, <name>. It is only a matter of time before a new prophet is elevated and finishes what the other began.

I am going to imbue you with the last of my power. Upon the person of the tormentor inside the altar building is an incense, which will awaken my body and make it vulnerable.

Use the incense and do me the kindness of putting an end to my suffering.

I apologize if I fight back. Even for me, the will to survive is strong. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bloodbinder's Shoulderpads
|Drape of the Bloodletter
|Belt of the Bloodbinder
|Ancestral Chestplates}}

== Progress ==
If you do not put an end to my suffering soon, <name>, all may be lost.

== Completion ==
You've done what had to be done and honored me in the process.

I give you my deepest thanks, <name>. I only hope that you and [[Har'koa]] will be able to help the others.

== Notes ==
[[Rhunok's Tormentor]] can be found on the steps leading up to Rhunok's body.

Rhunok's Tormentor will say "Filthy <race> intruder. DIE!"

Upon waking, Rhunok will yell "I will not simply lay here and allow you to slay me! You will have to earn your right to draw another breath if you want to kill me, mortal!"
