== Objectives ==
[[Stefan Vadu|Stefan]] in [[Ebon Watch]] asked you to go to the [[Reliquary of Agony]] to collect 7 Putrid Abomination Guts from the [[Putrid Abomination]]s and 7 Gooey Ghoul Drools from [[Decaying Ghoul]]s.
* [[Putrid Abomination Guts]] (7)
* [[Gooey Ghoul Drool (item)]] (7)

== Description ==
Once the [[scourge]] have a target in their sights, they'll stop at nothing to acquire it.

You're doomed to a mindless existence as a walking corpse....

<Stefan's face twists into a cruel grin.>

... unless we can use their desires against them.

I'll explain later. I have complex magic to prepare which requires certain material components.

Travel due east of here to the [[Reliquary of Agony]]. Slay the ghouls and abominations you'll find there and return to me with their remnants. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

== Progress ==
Have you brought me the components I asked for, <name>?

== Completion ==
<Stefan sifts through the foul components.>

Well, it's far from perfect, but it'll have to do now. Now brace yourself, <class>. This is where it gets good.
