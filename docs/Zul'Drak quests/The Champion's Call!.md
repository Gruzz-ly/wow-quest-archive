==Description==
Pfft, what happens down here ain't fightin. It's a couple of guys dancin' around a flag.

You lookin' for some real action, buddy? 'Cause if you are I got the hottest ticket in town.

Ever heard of Gurgthock and Wodin? Goblin and troll who ran the [[Ring of Blood]] back in [[Outland]]? Well they're here in [[Northrend]] and they've started up a whole new fight club over in Zul'Drak. If you're interested go to Zul'Drak, east of [[Crystalsong Forest|Crystalsong]]. They're at the big arena in the center. Tell 'em [[Shifty Vickers|Shifty]] sent ya!
