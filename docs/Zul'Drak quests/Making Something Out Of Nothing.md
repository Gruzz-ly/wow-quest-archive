==Objectives==
[[Engineer Reed]] at [[Crusader Forward Camp]] in [[Zul'Drak]] has asked that you recover 10 pieces of Scourge Scrap Metal.
* [[Scourge Scrap Metal]]: (10)

==Description==
[[Prince Navarius]] must be stopped. We can't let the [[Scourge]] continue to use this area as a [[zombie]] factory. If we can get the tank operational we might stand a chance. What I need right now are spare parts.

Northwest of here is an area called [[Thrym's End]]. The Scourge armies are using the area as a base of sorts. Spread out across the base is the wreckage from their arrival. Bits and pieces of Scourge scrap metal litter the landscape. Get that stuff to me and I'll try and put it to good use. 

==Progress==
I really don't know if this plan will work, <name>. Just bring me the scrap metal and I'll do what I can. 

==Completion==
What is this junk! Ah, damn it all! It's useless. Scourge metal isn't gonna do the trick. What are we going to do? 

==Gains==
*21150 [[XP]] (or {{cost|12|69}} at level 80)
*250 reputation with [[Argent Crusade]]
