== Objectives ==
[[Specialist Cogwheel]] at [[Drak'Sotra]] has asked you to collect [[Plague Sprayer Parts]].
* [[Plague Sprayer Parts]]

== Description ==
I know that one of those [[Plague spreader|plague sprayers]] crashed somewhere within Drak'Sotra to the west of us.

Why don't you see if you can find it. I can use the parts from the sprayer to create the device that's going to bring those things down! 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

== Progress ==
Do you have the parts? Huh? Do you?

== Completion ==
<The specialist steps back a bit when presented with the parts.>

Ew, those things are totally gross!

Okay, okay, hand them over and I'll see what I can do. I probably should have had you take them to a priest first for purification.

== Notes ==
The crashed sprayer can be found at {{coords|48.8|75.6|Zul'Drak}}.

On completion:
:{{text|say|Specialist Cogwheel says: Okay! Let me just see if I can fashion these disgusting parts into something useful.
:Specialist Cogwheel says: Eureka!}}
