== Objectives ==
[[Har'koa]] has asked you to collect 7 [[Blood of Mam'toth]]. Return them to her at the [[Altar of Har'koa]].
* [[Blood of Mam'toth]] (7)

== Description ==
[[Mam'toth]], the god of the [[mammoth]]s, destroyed himself, and took much of [[Altar of Mam'toth|his temple]] with him, rather than allowing his trolls to gain his power.

If I'm to sacrifice a portion of my spirit, I will need something with which to bolster myself.

Mam'toth left behind an enormous crater to the northeast, just north of the [[Altar of Quetz'lun]]. Within the crater his blood yet lives.

Bring it to me. 

== Progress ==
I wish that there were something that we could do to bring Mam'toth back to life, but there isn't.

We can honor him and his sacrifice by continuing the fight against the [[Drakkari]].

== Completion ==
Very well. Let us see if this works...

== Notes ==
The [[Blood of Mam'toth]] (mob) are a type of ooze and can be found all around [[Mam'toth Crater]].
