==Objectives==
[[Gymer]], King of Storm Giants, has asked you to find a way to release him from his cage. Speak with Engineer Reed at the Crusader Forward Camp.
 
==Description==
You are not like the others, little one. You do not reek of the ancient death. Perhaps you can be trusted.

I am Gymer, king of the storm giants. I was lured here by my brother, [[Thiassi the Lightning Bringer|Thiassi]], now an undead servant of the [[Lich King]]. By the time I realized that his cry for help was a trap, it was too late. I am now a prisoner of the [[Scourge]] and I fear that soon I will suffer the same fate as many of the other [[storm giant]]s.

Find a way to release me from this cage and I will aid you to the best of my ability. 

==Completion==
A... A storm giant? I don't know about this, <name>. That sounds risky. On the other hand, I don't think we have too many other options.

If I do this you have to promise me that you will get your giant friend to help us deal with Navarius and his cronies.
