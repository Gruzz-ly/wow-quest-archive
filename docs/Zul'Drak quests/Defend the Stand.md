==Objectives==
[[Commander Falstaav]] has tasked you with the destruction of any 10 [[Scourge]] in the courtyard at [[The Argent Stand]].
* Scourge at The Argent Stand destroyed (10)

==Description==
Despite our substantial successes in the lower third of [[Zul'Drak]], we must still face the onslaught of the Scourge. Such is the way in this frigid hell.

The attacks are unrelenting, yet my men need rest. If you are willing, we could use your aid in reinforcing them.

Below in the courtyard you'll find no end to the fighting. Dispatch the Scourge there with all the zeal you can muster, <class>. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Progress==
Perhaps you could destroy a few more?

==Completion==
Your assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated. Were it not for your efforts, we would have difficulty in holding the unliving back from our steps. 

==Progression==
Optional [[breadcrumb]] from [[Ebon Watch]]: [[Taking a Stand]]
