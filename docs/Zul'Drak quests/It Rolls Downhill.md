You keep up da good work, <name>. I got more tasks for ya real soon.

==Notes==
The geists and the crystals are scattered around the teleport pad on the ground; several crystals can be found in the orange goo pooled up around the pad, which is not immediately harmful. Using the Scepter on any geist brings it under control as a pet, dismissing any player pets - it may be best to dismiss those beforehand to avoid glitches. The geist will follow the player until instructed to collect a nearby crystal with its sole ability on the [[pet commands|pet action bar]]. At this point it will collect the crystal, walk up to the teleport pad, and despawn. The player need not follow the geist to the teleporter, but quest credit is only updated when it reaches the pad and despawns; controlling another geist or losing the [[Ensorcelled Choker]] disguise while it is on the way will interrupt the process. A new geist must be controlled each time.

A bug has been noted where each geist despawns as soon as the scepter is used on it. Various players have reported resetting this condition by actions such as logging out, cancelling and reapplying the disguise, or re-accepting the quest and re-teleporting down from Voltarus; some have suggested avoiding the use of mounts during the quest.<ref>{{Ref web|author=Various authors |url=https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/quest=12673/it-rolls-downhill#comments |publisher=[[Wowhead]] |title=It Rolls Downhill (comments)}}</ref>

Players who do not normally use pets may also need to ensure their UI editing settings have left the pet bar in a visible location.
