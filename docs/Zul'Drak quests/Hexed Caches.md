== Objectives ==
[[Chronicler To'kini]] at [[Zim'Torga]] has asked you to acquire 12 [[Zol'Maz Stronghold Cache]]s.
* [[Zol'Maz Stronghold Cache]] (12)

== Description ==
Pardon me, <name>. I'm given to understand that you might be heading northeast up to the [[Zol'Maz Stronghold]]. Such a trip presents a great opportunity for us to conclude our [[Drakkari]] goods gathering.

As I have come to know, the Drakkari warlord is extremely paranoid. He's had all of his caches at the stronghold hexed with dire magic. Rumor has it that his tiki warriors carry the cure, but who can say?

If you could find the time to acquire some of those goods, I would be most appreciative. 

== Progress ==
Perhaps you carry the caches within your pack even as we speak?

== Completion ==
Just look at all of that!

See here, <name>. This piece you recovered vividly illustrates that the Drakkari became aware of the weakening of the land that the Scourge caused by their presence.

The warlord felt compelled to take the opportunity he presented. He pushed the prophets to kill their gods in an effort to control the power and fight back against the [[Lich King]]'s forces.

Either way they were doomed. They inadvertently chose to be the instrument of their own destruction!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bloodbinder's Hood
|Supple Vest of the Bloodbinder
|Neckcharm of the Bloodletter
|Belt of Divine Ancestry}}

== Notes ==
You must complete the quest [[You Reap What You Sow]] in order to accept this quest.

Opening the caches gives a possible chance to receive a random debuff:
* '''Hex of Agony''': 6000 Shadow damage over 24 sec.
* '''Hex of Tongues''': Speaking Demonic increasing casting time by 25%.
* '''Hex of Weakness''': Physical damage done reduced by 55 and healing effectiveness reduced by 20%.

You can find {{loot|common|Tiki Hex Remover|Tiki Hex Removers}} from the nearby [[Enchanted Tiki Warrior]]s to dispel the debuff(s).
