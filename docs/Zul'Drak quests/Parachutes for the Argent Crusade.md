==Objectives==
[[Commander Falstaav]] at [[The Argent Stand]] has asked you to equip 10 [[Argent Crusader (NPC)|Argent Crusader]]s or [[Argent Shieldman|Argent Shieldmen]] out in the courtyard with parachutes.
* Argent forces equipped with a parachute (10)
* [[Crusader Parachute]] (provided)

==Description==
Those [[Sky Terror|sky terrors]] are destroying my men and women! Dying from falling is a horrible way to go.

<class>, you have to get these parachutes out to them! At least then they'll have a fighting chance to survive. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Crusader's Ripcord|Rescuer's Ripcord|Rescuer's Chestguard|Boots of the Rescuer|Blade of Valorous Service}}

==Progress==
If you're back here talking to me why do I still see my people falling to their deaths?

==Completion==
You're a good <man/woman>, <name>. We're fortunate that you happened to stop by.

Stick around a while. I'm sure that we have much that a capable <class> such as yourself can do. 

==Notes==
Crusaders and Shieldmen will be buffed if they have a parachute and are thus invalid targets.

==Progression==
