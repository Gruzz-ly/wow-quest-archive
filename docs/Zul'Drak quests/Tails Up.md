==Objectives==
[[Chronicler To'kini]] at [[Zim'Torga]] wants you to use To'kini's Blowgun on [[Frost Leopard]]s and [[Icepaw Bear]]s. Return to him with 3 females of each.
*Female Frost Leopards recovered (3)
*Female Icepaw Bears recovered (3)
*[[To'kini's Blowgun]] (provided)

==Description==
Along with the [[Drakkari]] artifacts, I'm interested in returning to [[Zandalar]] with some of the [[Zul'Drak]] wildlife. I have males of both the frost leopards and icepaw bears, but I need females!

Too bad that my trapper was killed in a most unfortunate accident. Perhaps you would be willing to fill in for him?

Put the leopards and bears to sleep with this blowgun then lift their tails and return with some females if you would be so kind. They can be found near the [[Altar of Rhunok|Altars of Rhunok]], [[Altar of Quetz'lun|Quetz'lun]], and [[Altar of Har'koa|Har'koa]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|50}}
*21400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
No, that just won't do. Please return when you have the female leopards and bears that I'll need for the arduous journey back home.

==Completion==
Very fine specimens indeed, <name>! These are sure to provide many hours of curious speculation amongst my colleagues back home.

==Notes==
The Altar of Rhunok, to the north, has a lot of the bears around it, but no leopards.  The area between the altars of Har'koa and Quetz'lun has both bears and leopards.

You shoot the blowgun while not in combat.  This immediately makes the animal {{reputation|Neutral}}, and after a short pause the animal will go to sleep.  As one might guess, you have about even odds, with any bear or leopard you use the blowgun on, of getting a female, or an ''angry male'' who you then have to fight.

After you identify a female, it will follow you around for a while.  When you complete the objectives and return to [[Zim'Torga]], all the female leopards and bears following you will disappear (before you actually turn in the quest).  If you have not actually filled the objectives when you return, the animals will continue to follow you.
