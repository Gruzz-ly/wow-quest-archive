==Objectives==
[[Element-Tamer Dagoda]] at [[Zim'Torga]] wants you to kill Heb'Jin.
* [[Heb'Jin]] slain
* [[Bat Net]] (provided)

==Description==
<Dagoda looks at [[Scalper Ahunae|Ahunae]] and sighs.>

You want to really deal with [[Heb'Drakkar]]? Collecting scalps isn't going to get the job done. You have to take out their leader, Heb'Jin.

The problem is, he's up on the bat rookery goading his forces on.

Bang his drum and I guarantee that he'll fly down. That's when you kill him.

You can take this net we got from one of his headhunters. Use it to trap his bat when he lands. That way you won't have to fight both of them. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Band of Misty Mojo|Supple Mantle of the Bloodletter|Leggings of the Ritual|Gauntlets of the Altar}}
You will also receive: {{cost|6|50}}

==Progress==
He's not dead. I can still hear him yelling from here!

==Completion==
You did it!

<Dagoda gives you a big kiss on the cheek.>

You have no idea how much of a relief that is to me! Defending against trolls on all sides is really putting a strain on us. Not to mention his incessant yelling.

Please, <name>, take your pick of what we have to offer.
