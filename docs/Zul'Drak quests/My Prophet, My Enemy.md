== Objectives ==
The [[Spirit of Rhunok]] at the [[Altar of Rhunok]] has asked you to acquire his [[Arctic Bear God Mojo]].
* [[Arctic Bear God Mojo]]

== Description ==
[[Prophet of Rhunok|My prophet]] absorbed too much of my power too quickly, and subsequently killed himself. You can see the results at the water-filled crater to the south in [[Drak'Mabwa]].

My former priests have already resurrected him so that he can finish the job. They're channeling my power back into him, and it will not be long now before he reawakens.

You must put an end to him and return with my mojo before it is too late. 

== Progress ==
Quickly, <race>, do you have my mojo?

== Completion ==
You did it.

But now there is one other thing that I need you to do.

==Progression==
