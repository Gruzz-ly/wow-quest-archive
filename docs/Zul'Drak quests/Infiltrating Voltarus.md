== Objectives ==
[[Stefan Vadu|Stefan]] wants you to use your [[Ensorcelled Choker]] to get into [[Voltarus]] and do whatever the [[Scourge]] leader there asks of you.

If you lose your Ensorcelled Choker, return to Stefan at [[Ebon Watch]] to get another.
* [[Overlord Drakuru]]'s task complete

== Description ==
By now you've probaby guessed the details of my plan.

We're using the Scourge's interest in you against them. You're going undercover. I know it's likely a death sentence, but if we do nothing your death is a certainty.

Travel northeast to [[Reliquary of Pain]] and stand on the platform while wearing your disguise. Once inside Voltarus, you must earn the trust of the Scourge commmander.

If things get ugly, do yourself a favor and jump. You wouldn't want to face me on the battlefield. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sandals of Spying
|Double-Agent's Wristwraps
|Gauntlets of the Secret Agent
|Drape of Duplicity
|Fist of Subtlety}}
You will also receive: {{cost|5|90}}

== Progress ==
Have you earned their commander's trust, <name>?

== Completion ==
Well, now... I must admit I'm more than a little surprised to see you, <name>.

Tell me what you've learned.

==Notes==
Voltarus is '''NOT''' the [[necropolis]] floating above the [[Reliquary of Agony]] between [[Ebon Watch]] and [[Light's Breach]]. That's [[Zeramas]]. Voltarus is far to the northeast above [[The Dead Fields]]. You need to go to the [[Reliquary of Pain]], not Agony.

Players must complete one of two quests offered by Drakuru depending on whether or not they have completed his chain in [[Drak'Tharon Keep]]. [[Dark Horizon]] if not, [[Reunited]] if they have. Either quest has the same objective of getting sent on a flight around the zone to introduce them to Zul'Drak proper, with commentary from Drakuru along the way.
