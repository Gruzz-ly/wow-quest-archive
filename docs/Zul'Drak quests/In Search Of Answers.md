==Objectives==
Search [[Rageclaw Den]] for a clue about who or what initiated the attacks against the Rageclaw [[Wolvar]]. 

==Description==
These poor creatures are the only survivors.

According to their chief, the [[Drakkari]] trolls and [[Rageclaw]] wolvar have been allies for thousands of years. They've been living here, alongside the trolls, for generations, completely unaware of the ever changing world around them. To the [[Rageclaw]], a troll is a troll, so the troll attack upon their den took them by surprise.

We need some answers, <name>. Scour their village - southeast of here - for clues as to who or what is in charge of these attacks. 

==Completion==
There is a scroll floating in the air above the strange altar. This must be what [[Crusader Lord Lantinga]] is looking for!
