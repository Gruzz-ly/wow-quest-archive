==Objectives==
[[Stefan Vadu|Stefan]] at [[Ebon Watch]] wants you to use the Ensorceled Choker to apply the Scourge disguise.

While in Scourge form, you are to purchase Bitter Plasma from Gristlegut.

If you lose your Ensorcelled Choker, return to Stefan at Ebon Hold to get another.
* [[Bitter Plasma]]
* [[Ensorcelled Choker]] (provided)

==Description==
There... I've created a disguise that should make you indistinguishable from the Scourge.

You'll be free to walk among them as long as the disguise holds. Only the [[Blightguard (Zul'Drak)|blightguards]] will be able to see through my illusion. Watch out for them!

Another thing you must know is that the disguise is unstable and may drop unexpectedly, so stay alert.

Let's test it out. Use the choker and visit the Scourge merchant just east of here. Return to me with a bottle of bitter plasma.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|60}}

==Progress==
Well, <name>?

Did you purchase that flask?

==Completion==
So? How are you enjoying scourge life?

Believe me, it's not all it's cracked up to be....

==Progression==
