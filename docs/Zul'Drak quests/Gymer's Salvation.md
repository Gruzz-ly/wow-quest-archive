==Objectives==
[[Engineer Reed]] at [[Crusader Forward Camp]] in [[Zul'Drak]] wants you to bring him 6 Banshee Essence and 6 Diatomaceous Earth.
* [[Banshee Essence]]: (6)
* [[Diatomaceous Earth]]: (6)
 
==Description==
Now you say that he's locked up in a 100 foot tall cage, eh?

If my calculations are correct, we should be able to at least weaken the hinges on the cage, giving the giant enough leeway to break out.

If this is going to work I'm going to need some plasticizers and stabilizers.

[[Banshee]] essence should do nicely for the plasticizer. You can get that from the banshees in the [[Dead Fields]], northeast of us. The stabilizer can be found on the earthragers to the southwest, near [[Ebon Watch]].

Get a move on! 

==Progress==
Without the plasticizers and stabilizers I'll never be able to make the explosives necessary to break your friend out of jail. 

==Completion==
Thankfully we weren't in short supply of explosives. Putting together the jumbo seaforium charge should be no problem with the materials you brought me.
