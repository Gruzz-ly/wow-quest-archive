== Objectives ==
Speak with the [[Spirit of Rhunok]] at the [[Altar of Rhunok]]. 

== Description ==
My feelings tell me that Rhunok doesn't have much time.

I can tell that the Arctic bear god's spirit has already separated from his weakened body. It is his spirit with which you must commune.

His altar lies to the northwest beyond [[Drak'Mabwa]]. 

== Completion ==
I am barely hanging on. You must work quickly or all will be lost.

== Notes ==
The Spirit of Rhunok is at {{coords|53.4|39.1|Zul'Drak}}.

==Progression==
