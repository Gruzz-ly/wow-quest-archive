==Objectives==
[[Captain Rupert]] at [[Drak'Sotra]] wants you to use High Impact Grenade near 5 Nerubian Craters.
* Nerubian Tunnels Sealed (5)
* [[High Impact Grenade]] (provided)

==Description==
Clever...

Just when it seemed we were getting things under control, they tunneled right underneath us and secured the shrine!

Now we're caught between two [[Nerubian]] armies and our predicament is worsening by the minute.

As our first course of action, we must stop them from reinforcing. Their tunnels must be sealed.

Take these grenades and throw them down their craters to the northwest.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|58}}

==Progress==
Have you sealed the nerubian tunnels, <name>?

==Completion==
We're not out of the woods by any means, but your efforts have helped to slow the enemy down.

[[Captain Grondel]] up in [[Drak'Agal]] will likely have need of you.

Farewell, <name>.
