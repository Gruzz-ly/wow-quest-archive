==Objectives==
[[Chronicler To'kini]] at [[Zim'Torga]] wants you to recover 7 Rhunokian Artifacts.
* [[Rhunokian Artifact]] (7)

==Description==
There is another altar nearby where there are artifacts to be saved.

It is said that the [[Drakkari]] at the [[Altar of Rhunok]] to the northwest, beyond the broken tundra of [[Drak'Mabwa]], have already plundered their own holy site.

<Class>, I would be appreciative if you could rescue those artifacts from their undeserving hands. 

==Progress==
There is no comprehending the Drakkari. They are brutal savages who have sunk to a new low.

==Completion==
Let me look at those.

<The chronicler examines the artifacts that you have recovered.>

Hmpf, I'd say that we're lucky you liberated these when you did, <class>.

How very interesting. This artifact here depicts the events of the [[Great Sundering|Sundering]]. There was a time when [[Northrend]] was the far northern portion of [[Kalimdor]].

But after the Sundering, the land broke off, eventually becoming Northrend.

This, of course, is why we see Drakkari in the southern continents as well as here.
