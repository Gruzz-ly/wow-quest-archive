[[Alchemist Finklestein]] is posted in [[Heb'Valok]], to the north.

* [[Creature Comforts|Captain Grondel's Task]]
* [[Lab Work|Alchemist Finklestein's Task]]

==Description==
Welcome to The Argent Stand, scrub. I am Commander Kunz, but you - you can call me... Commander.

Don't think you're going to just cruise through my region, picking which missions you're going to participate in, answering to no one.

Here, you report to me and you follow my orders to the letter. Understood?!

First, you're going to get familiar with my men and the region we're charged with clearing.

Report to each of them and do as they ask. Return to me when your patrol is done. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Pantaloons of the Dutybound|Belt of Service|Wristguards of Service|Ribbed Helm of Servitude|Vile Tome of Tenets}}
You will also receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Progress==
Have you met with each of my captains, <race>?

==Completion==
It's about time you got your carcass back here! Thought we'd lost ya to the Scourge - not that it would've been a great loss....

If you're going to continue to serve the Crusade, you'd best make a more impressive showing.

Take note, <race>! Your future patrols will be rewarded based on your timeliness.

Dismissed.
