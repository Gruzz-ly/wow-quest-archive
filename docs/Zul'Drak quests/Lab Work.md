==Description==
I assume by your interruption that you wish to be numbered among those I am considering for apprenticeship.

A worthy aspiration...

Should I someday choose to accept your petition, I must be confident that you can find your way around my laboratory. I have many ingredients here; some plentiful, and others in short supply.

Take your time, <class>. Find a muddy mire maggot, a withered batwing, an amberseed, and some chilled serpent mucus.

Succeed, and I'll know to take your request seriously. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Progress==
Have you become accustomed to my laboratory, <class>?

==Completion==
Yes, yes, that's a good start.

Should I call upon you to help me with an actual recipe, you'll need to locate ingredients in a timely manner.

Keep that in mind, <class>.

Farewell. 

==Notes==
* See [[Finklestein's Laboratory]] for a gallery of the items in the stockrooms.
