==Objectives==
[[Captain Arnath]] in [[Heb'Valok]] has asked you to collect 7 Unblemished Bat Wings from [[Zul'Drak Bat]]s.
* [[Unblemished Bat Wing]] (7)

==Description==
Ever since [[Alchemist Finklestein|Finklestein's]] arrival, I've been relegated to collecting various ingredients for his experiments and recipes.

I'll follow my orders as I've vowed to do, but I'm a seasoned veteran. I've taken part in dozens of conflicts. I'd much rather be on the front lines, having a more direct impact on the Crusade's outcome here.

Help me, <race>. Collect some bat wings for me so that I might get back to the real action sooner. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Braided Bat Sinew|Bat Fur Mitts|Huntsman's Jerkin|Gauntlets of the Gatherer}}
You will also receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Progress==
Have you finished collecting those bat wings for Finklestein?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>.

I thank you for your assistance.
