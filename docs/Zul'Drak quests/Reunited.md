===Whisper bug===
Multiple players have reported not receiving the expected whispers while on the quest. Generally, the flight itself proceeds normally and the player should still receive credit for the quest.<ref>{{Ref web|authors=Various authors |url=https://www.wowhead.com/quest=12663/reunited#comments |title=Reunited (comments) |publisher=[[Wowhead]]}}</ref>
