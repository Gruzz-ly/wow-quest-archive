==Objectives==
[[Sergeant Moonshard]] at [[Drak'Sotra]] has asked you to destroy 8 Hath'ar Necromagi.
* [[Hath'ar Necromagus]] slain (8)

==Description==
When the trolls brought down [[Kolramas]], it crashed next to us to the southeast. Unfortunately the crash did not destroy all of the [[Scourge]] within.

Now they're raising our men from the dead and using them against us!

This will not be allowed to continue. You will see to it that their necromagi are slaughtered! Do we understand each other? 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Progress==
No, <class>, you're not quite done. I know for a fact that there are still necromagi walking around at Kolramas.

==Completion==
It's not enough!

<The sergeant's voice cracks as he mourns the corruption of his fallen comrades.>

We must do more to show respect for the memories of those men!
