==Objectives==
[[Captain Grondel]] wants you to kill 7 Mossy Rampagers in [[Drak'Agal]].
* [[Mossy Rampager]]s Slain: (7)

==Description==
Of all the posts, they throw me in this one.

The place is flooded with putrid, stagnant water and now it's host to sewage [[elemental]]s!

I don't really know what they are or why they're here, and frankly I couldn't care less. What I do know is they're making a mess of my sector! How am I supposed to conduct any dignified military operations with those foul things roaming around?

Get out there, <class>, and don't come back 'til you've cleared your share of 'em off of my battlefield! 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|58}}

==Progress==


==Completion==
You sure about that, <race>?

Seems to me like there are more of them things out there now than when you started!
