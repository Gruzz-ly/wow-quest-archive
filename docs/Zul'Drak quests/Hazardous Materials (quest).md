If you lose your [[Ensorcelled Choker]], return to Stefan at Ebon Hold to get another.
* Drakuru's task complete
* [[Harvested Blight Crystal]] (5)

== Description ==
Concentrated blight crystals?! What could this Drakuru be up to?

Clearly, he's working on something important. Continue to do his bidding and perhaps once he's more familiar with you he'll reveal his plans.

In the meantime, we need to have a look at these crystals.

While you're in Voltarus, try to get some samples of the harvested crystals when no one's looking.

Be alert! Handling those crystals can trigger your disguise to fail. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

== Progress ==
Welcome back, <name>.

Were you able to steal any samples of Drakuru's crystals?

== Completion ==
Fascinating!

We'll look into the properties of these crystals right away.

Now tell me, <name>, what is the latest with this Drakuru fellow?
