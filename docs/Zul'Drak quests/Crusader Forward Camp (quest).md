'''Crusader Forward Camp''' is offered by Lantinga after completing [[Orders From Drakuru (quest)]], sending players off to the forward camp at the same time he sends players off to [[Ebon Watch]] in [[The Ebon Watch]].

==Objectives==
Seek out [[Crusader MacKellar]] at the [[Crusader Forward Camp]] in [[Zul'Drak]]. 

==Description==
[[Crusader Dargath]], Crusader MacKellar, [[Engineer Reed]] and the twins, [[Gerk]] and [[Burr]], were sent to [[the Dead Fields]] to establish a battle front days ago. As of my last correspondence with them, they had successfully established a camp on the border of the Dead Fields, northwest of here.

In light of this newfound information about [[Drakuru]] and [[Prince Navarius]] I think it would be prudent to send someone to the Crusader Forward Camp post-haste.

Pack up your belongings, <name>. You must leave at once! 

==Completion==
Everything was fine until the Scourge attacked. They took off with Dargath, Gerk and Burr and they also destroyed our ride. Guess who led that attack?

<MacKellar nods.>

Navarius...

Seems this whole area is some type of factory for [[Scourge]]. We're in the middle of a damned undead mine field! 

==Notes==
The Crusader Forward Camp is just north of the east-west road between [[Crystalsong Forest]] and the [[Argent Stand]], due north of [[Zeramas]] and just to the east of the little road split heading northwest to [[Thrym's End]].

Completing this quest opens up [[Gymer]]'s quests, starting with [[A Great Storm Approaches]].

Coordinates for the camp are {{coords|25.3|63.9|Zul'Drak}}
