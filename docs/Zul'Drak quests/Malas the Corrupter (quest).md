==Objectives==
[[Sergeant Moonshard]] at [[Drak'Sotra]] insists that you return with the Head of the Corrupter.
* [[Head of the Corrupter]]
Suggested Players [2]

==Description==
<Name>, gather at least one other person and head back down there!

You'll find the leader of [[Kolramas]], [[Malas the Corrupter]], gloating from atop the crashed [[necropolis]].

Kill him and bring me his head!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Leggings of Fastidious Decapitation|Legguards of Solemn Revenge|Ceremonial Pike Leggings|Legplates of the Vengeful Mendicant}}
You will also receive: {{cost|12|40}}

==Progress==
I look forward to mounting his head on a pike. Let's see him come back from that! 

==Completion==
You're the <hero/heroine> of the hour, <name>.

<Moonshard kicks the head away from him.>

You deserve our deepest respect, and something more I think. 

==Notes==
Malas The Corrupter is very slow, and can be easily kited in a loop around the top of the crashed ziggurat where he is pulled.  Any kiting class can theoretically solo him with little difficulty, HOWEVER, he does have an ability, "Wavering Will", that slows your movement speed by 50%.  This is a magic [[debuff]], so warlocks should use their [[Felhunter]] to dispel it; combined with a warlock's [[DoT]]'s makes the encounter trivial for this class.

==Progression==
