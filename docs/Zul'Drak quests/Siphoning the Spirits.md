==Objectives==
[[Captain Arnath]] at [[Heb'Valok]] wants you to collect 5 Ancient Ectoplasms from the [[Lost Drakkari Spirit]]s at the [[Pools of Zha'Jin]].
* [[Ancient Ectoplasm]]: (5)

==Description==
You should be happy he's coming, they said. You'll enjoy his company, they said....

Well it's not as if I had a choice in the matter. [[Alchemist Finklestein|Finklestein]] is the [[Argent Crusade|Crusade's]] best [[alchemist]]. I suppose I should be honored that he's chosen my post to set up shop. But ever since he's arrived, I've been relegated to collecting various alchemical ingredients.

Say, <race>, how about you give me a hand? Just south of here are some pools that are haunted by spirits of ancient trolls. Collect their [[ectoplasm]] for me.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Good day, <race>.

Have you collected the ectoplasm Finklestein asked for?

==Completion==
Thank you, <class>.

This should save my men some precious time.

==Notes==
Target the neutral ghost trolls, not the hostile [[wraith]]s.
