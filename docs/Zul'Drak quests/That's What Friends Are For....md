==Objectives==
[[Crusader MacKellar]] at [[Crusader Forward Camp]] has asked that you find Crusader Dargath, Gerk and Burr.
* [[Crusader Dargath]]{{coords|25|51|Zul'Drak}} found
* [[Gerk]]{{coords|17|57|Zul'Drak}} found
* [[Burr]]{{coords|15|59|Zul'Drak}} found

==Description==
We were attacked by [[Prince Navarius]] and at least a dozen [[Scourge]]. I told Dargath and the twins to stay inside the tank, but they wouldn't listen. Dargath looked me in the eyes and said, "If somebody doesn't get out of this tank, they'll kill us all." He then made Reed cut the engine and charged. Most heroic thing I've ever seen.

I heard the Prince barking orders to the monsters. Sounded like he was taking them to [[Thrym's End]], northwest of here. We have to rescue our friends. Will you go look for them? 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Greenhealer's Gauntlets|Medic's Hood|Purifier's Pantaloons|Horn of Argent Fury}}

==Completion==
It was a great sacrifice that those three made and it won't soon be forgotten. Their passing will not be in vain. We will be victorious! 

==Notes==
Gerk will offer [[Light Won't Grant Me Vengeance]], so don't go on a killing spree without it.
