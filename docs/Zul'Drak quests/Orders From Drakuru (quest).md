==Progress==
Drakuru, eh? I've heard the name before... 

==Completion==
If this is the same Drakuru from [[Drak'Tharon Keep]] we are going to need... outside assistance.

[[Death knights]] of [[Acherus: The Ebon Hold|Acherus]] are stationed nearby, undoubtedly following the same trail of Scourge destruction that lead the [[Argent Crusade]] here. As half of our army is tied up at the [[Argent Stand]], battling crazed Drakkari trolls, we will have to join forces with the [[Knights of the Ebon Blade]].

<Lantinga mutters under his breath.>

I was hoping I'd never have to see those scoundrels again after [[Battle for Light's Hope Chapel|Light's Hope]]...
