== Objectives ==
[[Witch Doctor Khufu]] at [[Zim'Torga]] has asked you to disturb the Blue Cauldron, Green Cauldron, Purple Cauldron, and Red Cauldron.
* [[Blue Cauldron]]{{coords|57.2|65.3|Zul'Drak}} disturbed
* [[Green Cauldron]]{{coords|55.7|64.3|Zul'Drak}} disturbed
* [[Purple Cauldron]]{{coords|57.6|61.7|Zul'Drak}} disturbed
* [[Red Cauldron]]{{coords|58.8|62.7|Zul'Drak}} disturbed

== Description ==
I have been trying to commune with the gods. However, the medicine men at the [[Pools of Jin'Alai]] are performing rituals that are interfering with my attempts.

It is imperative that we break through their obtrusion. If you were to head southwest into the pools area, I am certain that you would come across the cauldrons they are using for their magic.

Disturb each of the cauldrons to bring down their ritual that is blocking me. 

== Progress ==
I am still unable to make contact. The ritual of the medicine men is still intact.

Please go back there and disturb each of their cauldrons.

== Completion ==
Yes, I can already feel the difference. Thank you.

Let us see if we can make contact with the gods now.

== Notes ==
The quest area is just south-west of Zim’Torga ( The approximate center is 57,64 )
It is suggested that you also do the “The Leaders at Jin’Alai” quest at the same time, as they are in the same place and the requirement is to kill mobs in order to spawn the three “Leaders”. Both quests should be available to you.
Right click a cauldron to “Disturb” it.

After completing the quest:
