===Reported bugs===
Players have reported two major bugs with this quest:<ref>{{Ref web|author=Various authors |url=https://www.wowhead.com/quest=12710/disclosure#comments |title=Disclosure (comments) |publisher=[[Wowhead]]}}</ref>
* An invisible monster attacking and killing Malmortis. There are various reported workarounds involving maintaining distance from the skeleton guide and/or interacting with various monsters in the area. This was reported over several years, but may be fixed in more recent patches.
* Malmortis stopping his tour and simply not proceeding any further, particularly after thanking the player for their contribution to the blight crystal supply.

Aside from several attempts at direct fixes to these issues, at some point developers changed credit for the quest to be awarded as soon as the tour begins rather than after Malmortis's last line, allowing the scripted events to be skipped entirely if a player encounters a bug with them.

==Progression==
{{Betrayal}}

==Patch changes==
* '''''(Unknown patch)''''': Quest is now marked as complete as soon as the tour is begun; players do not need to actually complete the tour.
* {{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
