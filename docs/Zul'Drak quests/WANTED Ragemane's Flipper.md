This quest becomes available at level 74, and Warrior and Paladin tanks will want to complete it as soon as they reach that level.  It rewards some of the first tanking weapons available in WotLK; 3 out of the 4 quest rewards are suitable for a tank.  Whichever weapon is chosen, it will most likely be carried by the tank until level 78, when the [[Eternally Folded Blade]] from [[Halls of Lightning]] becomes usable.

Most tanks will choose the [[Hammer of Quiet Mourning]], as it provides the most overall damage avoidance.  However, the [[Crescent of Brooding Fury]] provides more pure [[Defense]] for players struggling to reach the cap of +140 skill; tanks struggling with threat generation will also prefer this weapon, for its expertise and higher DPS.  Tanks who are already at or over the cap will most likely choose the [[Sword of Heartwrenching Slaughter]].

During the Wrath of the Lich King beta, this quest had the following rewards:
