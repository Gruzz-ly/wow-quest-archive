==Objectives==
[[Hexxer Ubungo]] at [[The Argent Stand]] has asked you to investigate the main altar building at the [[Altar of Sseratus]].
* Main building at the Altar of Sseratus investigated.

==Description==
There's trouble at the altar of the snake god.

The presence of the [[Scourge]] has weakened the land, <race>. This in turn has weakened the wild gods.

We know that the [[Drakkari]] are taking advantage of this to do evil things to the gods.

I need you to be my eyes and ears. The Altar of Sseratus is at the end of the avenue to the north. Sneak around the back and get a look inside of the main altar building.

Whatever you do, avoid the prophet at all costs! 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Progress==
What did you see, <race>?

==Completion==
Dead?

<The hexxer's spirit is visibly lowered at the news you bring.>

They've killed [[Sseratus]] and drunk deeply of his mojo; the prophet especially!

We must figure out a way to put an end to him before he drinks too much more! 

==Notes==
Dodge the prophet, a 76 elite and head into the building behind him.
