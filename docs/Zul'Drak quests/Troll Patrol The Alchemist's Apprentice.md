==Objectives==
[[Alchemist Finklestein]] at [[Heb'Valok]] wants you to assist him in the creation of a truth serum.

When you are ready to begin, you are to speak to him and follow his instructions.
* Truth Serum Created

==Description==
Ahh, you must be the promised patrol. Your timing couldn't be better. I have urgent need of an extra pair of hands.

We have a Drakkari prisoner who's been sent here to undergo questioning. Before the interrogation begins, I require assistance in the creation of a truth serum.

Creating a truth serum is tricky business, demanding keen instincts, perfect timing, and improvisation at every step.

Let me know when you're ready, <race>. And remember, timing is everything! 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|58}}

==Progress==
You see, <name>, there is far more to true [[alchemy]] than mixing a few ingredients....

==Completion==
You've done it!

The intelligence gathered from that troll will undoubtedly be of great value. I'll be certain to make mention of your efforts in my report to the commander.

Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
* See [[Finklestein's Laboratory]] for a gallery of the items in the stockrooms.
* There are also two AddOns that assist you with this quest:
** [http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/easyserum.aspx EasySerum] is a text-based plugin.
** [http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/finklestein.aspx Finklestein] is a graphical plugin.
* Getting a plugin is highly recommended if you want to complete [[Congratulations!]] on time. Nothing is more painful than losing ten minutes out of twenty to Alchemist Finklestein and failing the quest – thus turning a reward of about 35 G into one of about 10 G.

Time is of the essence here, <name>.  Are you prepared to be tested?
