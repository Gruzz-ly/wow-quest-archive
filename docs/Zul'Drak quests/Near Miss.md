==Objectives==
[[Stefan Vadu|Stefan]] at [[Ebon Watch]] wants you to take the Unliving Choker to [[Bloodrose Datura]].
* Choker's purpose exposed
* [[Unliving Choker (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
It was either wisdom or luck that prevented you from wearing this choker, <race>.

Either way, your acquiring it was no random occurrence. You've been targeted by someone, or something....

Take your choker to Bloodrose, here. Let her demonstrate the fate that nearly befell you. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3}}

==Completion==
Now you've observed the fate that was meant to befall you.

As I mentioned before, this was no coincidence. The creation of such a device is very involved, and the required resource would not be squandered on a random target.

The simple truth of the matter is this; You're wanted by the scourge....

==Notes==
When approaching Bloodrose:

:<Bloodrose eyes you curiously.>

:I cannot help but wonder what makes you worthy of such attention.

:No offense....

:{{Gossip|Stefan told me you would demonstrate the purpose of this item.}}

:{{Text|emote|The captured troll takes the charm and turns into a ghoul.}}
