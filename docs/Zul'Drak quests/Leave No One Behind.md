==Description==
Ahh, good. They sent someone.

Listen, <race>. We need a hand here. Our forces were pushed back and we've lost Drak'Sotra to the [[Scourge]]. Where they came from is anyone's guess....

The point is, we need every man we can get here, and some of our best have yet to return from battle.

I need you to enter the ruins now that the fighting has died down and find our wounded, patch them up, and bring them here to me.

Scour Drak'Sotra!  They couldn't have gone far.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Rescuer's Cloak|Ravager's Skullcap|Rescuer's Binding|Vindicator's Bracers of Sacrifice}}
You will also receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Progress==
Have you rescued our veterans, <name>?

==Completion==
Saved them all, did you? Outstanding!

Maybe you'd consider sticking around the post here? We could sure use someone like you.... 

==Notes==
Each Crusader has a very limited time to return to Dr. Rogers.  Save each one individually, or you will need to return to them again as there is a 2 minute cooldown on the [[Crusader's Bandage]].
