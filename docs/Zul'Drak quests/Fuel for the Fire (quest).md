Dey breached our wall and put a whole army just north of us.

Hahaha!

==Progress==
Did ya smash da trolls, <name>?

==Completion==
We done it, mon!

I got da chieftains all caged up and you led my abominations to victory over their armies.

It be time ta celebrate, mon!

==Notes==
The break in the wall is just past the "waggons" and head up the snow hill (grab a Abomination on the way) to find the Trolls.

Have the Abomination tag a bunch of Trolls, then once they are all on him, knock them down to stun them all.  Once they are aggro focused on your Abomination, have him explode killing all the Trolls.

Rinse and repeat. (make sure you are close enough to the Abomination to get credit for the kills.)
