==Objectives==
[[Specialist Cogwheel]] at [[Drak'Sotra]] has asked you to collect 5 Intact Skimmer Spinnerets.
* [[Intact Skimmer Spinneret]] (5)

==Description==
Why do I always get the tough tasks to tackle?

The [[Scourge]] at [[Kolramas]] have plague sprayers that are getting dangerously close. You don't want to know what's going to happen if they start heading this way!

I've got an idea for how we might bring them down, but first we're going to need something... something from their own creatures.

The [[Hath'ar Skimmer|Hath'ar skimmers]] can spin a very strong web that we can put to good use. Bring back some of their spinnerets. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Progress==
Those spinnerets have to be intact if I'm going to be able to put them together into a device that you can use. 

==Completion==
Those'll do!

Now we're going to need some raw parts so that I can put the launching device together for you. 

==Notes==
On completion:
:{{text|say|Specialist Cogwheel says: Oh, these are sticky! I wonder how they shoot the webbing?}}
:(She triggers one, getting debuffed with Webs: Stuck in sticky webbing.)
:{{text|say|Specialist Cogwheel says: ACK! Oh no, I webbed myself! It's sticky. MY HAIR!}}
