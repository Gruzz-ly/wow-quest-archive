==Objectives==
[[Commander Kunz]] at [[Argent Stand]] wants you to report to [[Sergeant Riannah]] at [[Light's Breach]].

==Description==
Listen up, <race>!

This entire region is full of crises. Everywhere you look you'll find those who could use your assistance.

<Kunz looks you squarely in the eye.>

No one needs your help right now more than Riannah. The [[scourge]] have forced their way between us, leaving her and those she commands isolated.

Light's Breach, where her forces are holding out, lies just southwest of here. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||60}}
*2100 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|26}} at max level)

==Completion==
My report must have made it through to Kunz.

It is good to know that he is well.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
