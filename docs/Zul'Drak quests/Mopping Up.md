==Objectives==
[[Corporal Maga]] at the [[Altar of Sseratus]] wants you to kill any combination of 10 [[Champion of Sseratus|Champions of Sseratus]], [[Priest of Sseratus|Priests of Sseratus]], or [[Drakkari Snake Handler]]s.
* Followers of Sseratus slain (10)

==Description==
I couldn't help but overhear what you were talking to the [[Sergeant Stackhammer|sergeant]] about. That doesn't change the fact that we still have a job to do here.

While you're out there, do you think you could help us to put some of those followers of [[Sseratus]] out of their misery? 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Progress==
How about killing a few more?

==Completion==
Thanks, <class>. I'd have hated to leave without accomplishing what we came out here for in the first place. 

==Progression==
{{:New Orders for Sergeant Stackhammer}}
