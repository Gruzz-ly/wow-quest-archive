[[Stefan Vadu|Stefan]] in [[Ebon Watch]] wants you to defeat [[Overlord Drakuru|Drakuru]].

==Description==
[[File:Betrayal TCG.jpg|thumb|In [[World of Warcraft: Trading Card Game]].]]
The time has come to end this charade, <name>.

As valuable as your information has been, we must bring Drakuru down and bring his project to an end before his freaks are unleashed.

We've modified your scepter for the job. When the time is right, you will be able to use it on Drakuru's [[Blightblood Troll|Blightblood]]s and turn them against him. It's your only hope of defeating him.

Fight well. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Betrayer's Choker
|Choker of Betrayal
|Choker of the Betrayer}}
You will also receive: {{cost|18|60}}

==Progress==
Have you faced Drakuru in battle, <name>?

==Completion==
So, it's done.

We still have much to do, but our work here will be much more manageable thanks to your efforts.

Please accept this as a token of our gratitude.

==Notes==
To get to the fighting stage, players need to talk to Drakuru. He takes you to the top of the necropolis, where he will stand in the middle of the large circular platform. There are four smaller platforms surrounding the large platform. Drakuru, now in [[Overlord Drakuru|fighting form]], will show off his might by summoning four [[Blightblood Troll]]s on the smaller platforms. Your disguise then fails and Drakuru realises your treachery. The fight begins. 

You use the [[Scepter of Domination]] to control a Troll and use it to fight Drakuru. After defeating him, the [[Lich King]] arrives through a portal, finishes off Drakaru, and spares the player's life once again.

You can pick up [[Drakuru's Skull]]. Next to it is Drakuru's Last Wish. Use it to be returned to the [[Reliquary of Pain]]. There you can summon [[Stefan Vadu]] for the last time and hand in the quest.

:''Drakuru throws crystals to summon four [[Blightblood Troll]]s.''

Completing this quest is part of {{Achievement|Guru of Drakuru}}.

Note that you don't actually have to "do" this quest to complete it. You can just watch someone do it (even someone who's not from your faction) and loot the head after the fight.

==Strategy==
To defeat him you must take control one of the [[Blightblood Troll]]s by using the [[Scepter of Domination]] on it. The troll will work like a Hunter or Warlock combat pet, with a small action bar above your regular action bar. See the [[Blightblood Troll]] page for a description of his abilities. Spam '''Powerful Strike''' (pet action #4) to do a large amount of damage, '''Concussive Blow''' (pet action #5) to buy your troll some more time, and '''Blightblood Infusion''' (pet action #6) to heal yourself.

More than likely, players will lose their first troll. As soon as that happens, run over to another troll, take control of it and get it in the fight. After a Troll dies and while you are busy taking control of a new one, Drakuru will hit you with his '''Shadow Bolts'''. Try to get a '''Blightblood Infusion''' heal from a Troll just before he dies, and get a heal right away from the new Troll.

[[Overlord Drakuru|Drakuru]] will stay in the center of the platform, but while he is not engaged by a troll he will fire his '''Shadow Bolt''' at you for about 1250 DPS. He will occasionally throw a crystal at the player (announced by an emote) which does AoE damage. You will need to get away and stay out of the affected area. 

Classes with ranged damage should stay on the edge of the platform, moving around the circumference as needed. When Drakuru starts throwing crystals, step aside just far enough to avoid the AoE damage. In time, this will move you all the way around the platform, but by the time you have come full circle, the older AoE patches will have gone.

This is probably also a good strategy for melee classes. The troll will do most of the damage anyway (about 3600 DPS), and this will keep you out of the way of the crystals. If you want to stay close in, then run away when the emote comes. If you stay, the AoE spot will be close to Drakuru, making it hard to stay in melee range.

Either way it is probably the easiest to focus on the fighting abilities of the troll rather than putting in damage yourself.

Do not step on a small platform with an untamed Troll on it. It will attack you and probably quickly kill you. To gain control of one, use your [[Scepter of Domination]] while standing on the big platform.

Do not try to take control of a new Troll while your old Troll is still alive. You will lose control of the old one and it will attack you.
