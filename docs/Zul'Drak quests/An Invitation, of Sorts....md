==Objectives==
Take the Unliving Choker to [[Stefan Vadu|Stefan]] at [[Ebon Watch]].
* [[Unliving Choker]] (provided)

==Description==
Crafted of bone and dripping with blood, this choker is of intricate and deliberate design.

Gazing upon it overwhelms you with an ominous presence - one that compels you to wear it. You fight the urge, and resolve to bring it back to [[Ebon Watch]].

If anyone can explain this, a [[death knight]] can.... 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|60}}

==Completion==
I am indeed familiar with items such as this.

<Stefan looks you in the eye.>

It would seem, <name>, that you have been... chosen.

==Trivia==
This quest can only be obtained if the character have NOT previously completed [[Cleansing Drak'Tharon]]. If they did, [[Darkness Calling]] will be obtained instead.

==Progression==
{{Betrayal}}
