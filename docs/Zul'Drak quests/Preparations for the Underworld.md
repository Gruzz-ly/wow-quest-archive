== Objectives ==
[[Har'koa]] wants you to collect 8 [[Sacred Adornment]]s. Deliver them to her at the [[Altar of Har'koa]].
* [[Sacred Adornment]] (8)

== Description ==
[[Quetz'lun]] may be dead, but I can still feel her [[Quetz'lun's Spirit|spirit]] lingering in the underworld at the altar. We have to find a way to get you to her.

Luckily for us, I just happen to have a supply of former supplicants at hand who are no longer in need of their sacred adornments. Both my [[Har'koan Subduer|subduer]]s and [[Claw of Har'koa|claw]]s are likely to still be wearing them.

Bring the adornments to me and I'll draw upon their energy to enable you to cross over into Quetz'lun's underworld nightmare. 

== Rewards ==
The following spell will be cast on you:<br />
[[Image:Ability Vanish.png|36px]] [[The Breath of Har'koa]]

== Progress ==
I never imagined that it would come to this. The [[Drakkari]] are truly lost.

== Completion ==
<The leopard goddess looks saddened at the collection of holy symbols that you have brought before her.>

There was a time when these meant something. Let's see if we can put them to better use.
