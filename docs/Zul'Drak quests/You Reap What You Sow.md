==Objectives==
Slay the [[Drained Prophet of Quetz'lun]] and then inform [[Witch Doctor Khufu]] at [[Zim'Torga]].
* [[Drained Prophet of Quetz'lun]] slain
* [[Quetz'lun's Ritual]] (provided)

==Description==
This is what it has come down to... revenge.

<[[Har'koa]] sighs.>

Take this ritual kit and enact it near [[Quetz'lun]]'s corpse upon her altar. If everything works properly, her spirit should be drawn into the material world where she will be able to reclaim her power from the prophet.

The rest will be up to you, <name>. You must slay the prophet in his drained state. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Ritualistic Shield
|Supple Bloodbinder's Leggings
|Neckcharm of Mighty Mojo
|Ancestral Gauntlets
|Bloodletter's Blade
}}

==Progress==
What brings you back to me, <name>?

==Completion==
<The witch doctor shakes his head in disbelief.>

It sounds like you barely escaped Quetz'lun's underworld alive.

I'm glad that it's you out there. I don't know if I would have had the courage to deal with that situation!

==Notes==
''Accept:''
: {{text|say|Har'koa|<Name>, somehow I feel stronger from [[Mam'toth]]'s blood.}}
: ''Har'koa breaks the chains holding her captive.''
: {{text|say|Har'koa|I'm free!  Quickly, enact Quetz'lun's Revenge.  I'll meet you afterward at [[Zim'Torga]].}}

When using the Ritual, the Prophet will react to your actions:
:{{text|yell|[[Prophet of Quetz'lun]]|What is this you pathetic, little worm? Come to die?}}
:{{text|yell|Prophet of Quetz'lun|I recognize your stench. You're the one who stealthed by me on the back of that snow leopard runt!}}
:{{text|yell|[[Quetz'lun's Spirit|Spirit of Quetz'lun]]|TIME TO DIE, FOOL!}}
:{{text|yell|Prophet of Quetz'lun|What? How is this possible?}}
:{{text|yell|Spirit of Quetz'lun|I've returned to invite you to my housewarming in the underworld!}}
:{{text|yell|Spirit of Quetz'lun|I'd say come along quietly, but we both know that's not going to happen. My little friend here is going to ease your way into the afterlife.}}
:{{text|yell|Prophet of Quetz'lun|Wait... STOP! You can't take back the power!!!}}
:{{text|yell|Prophet of Quetz'lun|NOOOOooooooooooooooooo!}}

Victory:
:{{text|yell|Spirit of Quetz'lun|Well done. I'll see to it that my prophet enjoys his eternal stay with me.}}

After you complete the quest, [[Har'koa]] will move from her [[Altar of Har'koa|altar]] to Zim'Torga.
:{{text|whisper|Har'koa|<Name>, please come to me. I'm here in Zim'Torga now.}}
