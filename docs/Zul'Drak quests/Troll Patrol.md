==Objectives==
[[Commander Kunz]] at the [[Argent Stand]] wants you to visit the four [[Argent Crusade]] posts, follow their captain's orders, and then return and report to him.

[[Captain Brandon]] and [[Captain Rupert]] are posted at [[Drak'Sotra]], [[Captain Grondel]] is posted in [[Drak'Agal]], and [[Alchemist Finklestein]] is posted in [[Heb'Valok]].
* Captain Brandon's Task
* Captain Rupert's Task
* Captain Grondel's Task
* Alchemist Finklestein's Task

==Description==
Unsheathe that weapon, <race>. It's time to go on patrol!

I've got four posts under my command and it's crucial to our success that they remain in our control. I'm ordering you to visit each of them and offer your assistance.

You can begin with Captain Brandon southeast of here. He'll direct you to the next post when he's finished with you.

Report back to me once you've assisted each of my men. And remember, you'll be more richly rewarded for returning to me quickly - so double-time it!

Dismissed!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Progress==
What news from our posts, <race>?

==Completion==
Well, <name>, at least you've made it back in one piece. I suppose that's worth something....

==Notes==
When you accept the initial quest, you have a 20 minute buff applied to you.  If you can complete the subquests within the allotted time, you are eligible for [[Congratulations!]], which awards an extra 650 reputation with the [[Argent Crusade]] and {{cost|19|05}} (the reputation for Congratulations! was increased to 650 in patch 3.0.8).

After the hotfix, the subquests no longer reward reputation. You only receive 455 rep for turning in Troll Patrol and the bonus 650 for finishing it under 20 minutes.
