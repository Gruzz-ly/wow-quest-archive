==Objectives==
Speak to [[Gymer]] at [[Thrym's End]] in [[Zul'Drak]] once you have used the Jumbo Seaforium Charge to open the Scourge Enclosure that is holding him prisoner.  
* [[Scourge Enclosure]] Blown Up
* [[Jumbo Seaforium Charge]] (provided)

==Description==
What I'm about to give you is called [[seaforium]]. It is a highly volatile explosive with some unique properties. Due to its malleable nature, you will be able to fill in the hinges and cracks of the cage for maximum damage.

Return to your friend and use the jumbo seaforium charge to set him free.

Let's hope he honors the bargain. He's our only hope. 

==Completion==
FREEDOM!

Do not be afraid, little one. Gymer is an honorable giant. Like you and your people, I too wish to see the [[Scourge]] driven away from this land and the [[Lich King]] destroyed. I will help you, as promised, to the best of my ability. 

==Progression==

==Trivia==
The name of this quest is likely a reference to the 1977 film ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'' in which a hologram of Princess Leia tells Obi-Wan "Ben" Kenobi that he is "Our only hope" (referring to her home planet and it's citizens).
