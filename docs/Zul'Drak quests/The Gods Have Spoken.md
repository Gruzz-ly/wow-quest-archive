== Objectives ==
Deliver the Unblemished Heart of the Guardian and the Gusty Essence of the Warden to [[Har'koa]] at [[Zim'Torga]].
* [[Unblemished Heart of the Guardian]]
* [[Gusty Essence of the Warden]]
* Suggested Players [3]

== Description ==
The gods have spoken and we must heed their wisdom.

Gather friends to your side, <name>. Take them north to [[Zim'Rhuk]] to destroy [[Guardian of Zim'Rhuk|guardian]]s there until they yield the unblemished heart. Take them southeast to the [[Altar of Quetz'lun]] and disrupt the [[Altar Warden|altar warden]]s until you recover their gusty essence.

Deliver both to Har'koa and she will combine them into that which will compel late Akali's prophet to appear. 

== Progress ==
Do you have that which is required, <name>?

== Completion ==
Your bravery seems boundless, <name>.

Please hand me the heart and the essence, and I will fashion them into that which compel the prophet to appear before you.

== Notes ==
Since the mobs at the Altar of Quetz'lun are neutral from [[You Reap What You Sow|an earlier quest]], you don't have to worry about aggro ranges. Patrolling mobs ''will'' aggro the ones you fight once you come close, though.
