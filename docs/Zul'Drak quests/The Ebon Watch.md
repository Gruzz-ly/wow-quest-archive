==Objectives==
Deliver the Orders From Drakuru to [[Stefan Vadu]] at [[Ebon Watch]] in [[Zul'Drak]].
* [[Orders From Drakuru]] (Provided)

==Description==
West of here, across the ruined roads and structures, is the death knight encampment of Ebon Watch.

<[[Crusader Lord Lantinga]] rolls up Drakuru's orders.>

Take these orders and deliver them to Stefan Vadu. He is the death knight in command at Ebon Watch. Let him know that the [[Argent Crusade]] will deal with [[Prince Navarius]]. They'll have to handle [[Drakuru]].

Be careful, <name>. The way to Ebon Watch is teaming with Scourge. 

==Progress==
What have you got there, <race>? 

==Completion==
<Stefan reads the missive, then crumples it up and tosses it into the fire.>

Old news. The Argent Crusade is - once again - late to the party. We've been tracking Drakuru since [[Grizzly Hills]]. He is slated for eradication.
