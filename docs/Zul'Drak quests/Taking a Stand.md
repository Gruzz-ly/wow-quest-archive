This is the [[breadcrumb]] quest to further tasks at the [[Argent Stand]] after finishing with [[Ebon Watch]].

==Objectives==
[[Bloodrose Datura]] at [[Ebon Watch]] wants you to speak with [[Commander Falstaav]] at [[The Argent Stand]]. 

==Description==
A few moments ago I spotted a signal flare over the treeline to the east.

That can only mean that things are not going smoothly for the Crusaders at Argent Stand.

I cannot leave our post here, <race>, but you can. When time permits, make your way up to Commander Falstaav and see if there's anything you can do to lighten their burden. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||60}}

==Completion==
As it happens there is something you can do to be of assistance, <class>. 

==Progression==
<onlyinclude># [[Taking a Stand]]
# [[Defend the Stand]]</onlyinclude>

==Patch changes==
