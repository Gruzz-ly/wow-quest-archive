== Objectives ==
[[Element-Tamer Dagoda]] at [[Zim'Torga]] has asked you to destroy 12 [[Enchanted Tiki Warrior]]s.
* [[Enchanted Tiki Warrior]]s destroyed (12)

== Description ==
I know that you're headed up to the [[Zol'Maz Stronghold]] to the northeast, <class>. While you're there, I need you to deal with the warlord's special guardians.

The enchanted tiki warriors, as they're called, represent a very real threat. If the [[Drakkari]] were to mass produce them, we'd quickly be overrun.

Let's you and I demonstrate that they're not worth the effort to create, shall we? 

== Progress ==
Surely you couldn't have dealt with all of the enchanted tiki warriors so quickly?

== Completion ==
That should make them think twice about making more about those things. I shudder to think what it would be like to have to fight an army of those things.

<The element-tamer is thoughtful for a moment.>

I guess it would be just like fighting the endless waves of the [[Scourge]].

== Notes ==
You must complete the quest [[You Reap What You Sow]] in order to accept this quest.
