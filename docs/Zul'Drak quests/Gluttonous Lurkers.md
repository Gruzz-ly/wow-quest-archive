==Objectives==
Deliver 5 Basilisk Crystals to [[Alchemist Finklestein]] in the shrine at [[Heb'Valok]].
* [[Basilisk Crystals]] (5)

==Description==
My master, Finklestein, is in the shrine at Heb'Valok to the northwest preparing a truth serum, and he needs basilisk crystals. Heb'Valok is on the west side of the road leading north before the [[Altar of Sseratus]].

There are basilisks to the east at [[Drak'Agal]].

If you grab the [[Zul'Drak Rat|Zul'Drak rats]] and throw them at the [[Lurking Basilisk|basilisk]], they will become [[Gorged Lurking Basilisk|gorged]] and docile after eating five. Then you'll be able to take their crystals.

Killing the basilisk won't do you any good. That'd just break its crystals! 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Progress==
What's all this?

By any chance have you seen my no-good apprentice, [[Apprentice Pestlepot|Pestlepot]]?

I sent him on an errand quite some time ago and he has yet to return!

==Completion==
Oh, most excellent! Thank you. The crystals appear to be in fine condition!

I have no doubt that Pestlepot put you up to doing his chores for him. Nevertheless, your assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated!
