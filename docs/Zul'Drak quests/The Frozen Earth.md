==Objectives==
[[Element-Tamer Dagoda]] at [[Zim'Torga]] wants you to collect 7 Essence of the Frozen Earth.
* [[Essence of the Frozen Earth]]: (7)

==Description==
We captured these [[elementals]] from nearby, and I have plenty of defenders now. But, it takes a great deal of power to make them strong enough to stand up to our enemies.

The [[Frozen Earth|frozen earth]] at [[Drak'Mabwa]] to the northwest have what I need to maintain our defenses. I'll need more of their essence if I'm to keep this up. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Bloodbinder's Wrist Wraps|Supple Bloodbinder's Helm|Bloodbinder's Gauntlets|Band of the Bloodletter}}
You will also receive: {{cost|6|50}}

==Progress==
I hope that you've returned with enough. The attacks from the [[Pools of Jin'Alai]] have become more desperate after what you did to them.

==Completion==
Thank you, <class>. Those essences should be enough to fuel my casting for quite some time.
