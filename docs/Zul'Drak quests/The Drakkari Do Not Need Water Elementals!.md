==Objectives==
[[Sub-Lieutenant Jax]] at [[The Argent Stand]] has asked you to kill 10 Drakkari Water Binders.
* [[Drakkari Water Binder]] slain (10)

==Description==
Intelligence reports that ever since those [[water elemental]]s appeared in the [[Drak'Sotra Fields]], a number of [[Drakkari]] shaman have come down from the upper tiers of [[Zul'Drak]] to take control of them.

I cannot stress enough, <sir/ma'am>, how dangerous that could prove. We do not want them to have water elementals at their disposal.

The commander has ordered that these Drakkari water binders are to be put to the sword. Head south when you're ready. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

==Progress==
If I may suggest, you might want to take care of a few more of those Drakkari water binders.

==Completion==
Excellent work, <sir/ma'am>!

I'll see to it that the commander is apprised of your mission results.

==Progression==
{{Gods of Zul'Drak storyline}}
