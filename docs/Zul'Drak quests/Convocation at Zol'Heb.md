==Objectives==
[[Har'koa]] at [[Zim'Torga]] has asked you to slay the [[Prophet of Akali]].
* [[Prophet of Akali]] slain
* Suggested Players [3]
* [[Prophet of Akali Convocation]] (provided)

==Description==
You and your friends must take this instrument of convocation - of summoning - to [[Zol'Heb]] just south of [[Gundrak]].

Therein you will find a [[Circle of Power|circle of power]]. Use the convocation to force the prophet of [[Akali]] to appear.

My heart goes out to you, <name>. We have been through much together, and you have done all that you can to not only save my life, but those of the other gods the [[Drakkari]] have destroyed.

But I fear this time we may not see each other again until the afterlife.

==Progress==
I can only offer you the warmth of my words and the encouragement that comes with them.

Take what time you need to steel and prepare yourself, but I implore you not to take too long or the prophet will surely descend upon us.

==Completion==
You did it! <Name>, you are the champion of [[Zul'Drak]]!

We will never be able to repay the debt that we owe to you, but the [[Zandalari]] have given into my trust a number of objects they believe you might have an interest in.

Take your time, little <race>. There's no longer any rush. You've saved us.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Robe of the Conquered Prophet
|Intricate Zandalari Tunic
|Chestguard of Rampaging Fury
|Links of the Terrified Deity}}
You will also receive: {{cost|20|40}}

==Notes==
Use the convocation at the green summoning circle{{coords|77.6|36.6|Zul'Drak}} at [[Zol'Heb]] to summon the prophet.
:{{text|yell|Prophet of Akali|What is this? I recognize you from when I killed [[Akali]]. You must be this <name> that everyone is dreading.}}
:{{text|yell|Prophet of Akali|You don't worry me, <boy/girl>. Just the opposite - I look forward to killing you and your friends. Nothing will stand between me and [[Zim'Torga]] now!}}

When bringing the prophet the ~80% he will begin a new phase, where he stuns the party, becomes immune to damage and start casting [http://www.wowhead.com/spell=52993 Akali's Ritual of Annihilation]. But suddenly from the south-east, Har'koa comes to save the day!
:{{text|yell|Prophet of Akali|How sad that only now do you grasp the truth - I wield the power of a god. You are a mere mortal. You cannot hope to defeat me!}}
:{{text|yell|Prophet of Akali|You've meddled in affairs that were none of your business. You are nothing but foreign invaders. Prepare to die!}}
:{{text|emote|The prophet begins to cast a ritual of annihilation upon you all.}}
:{{text|yell|[[Har'koa]]|PROPHET!}}
:{{text|yell|Prophet of Akali|What? HAR'KOA?!}}
:{{text|yell|Har'koa|YOU KEEP YOUR FILTHY DRAKKARI HANDS OFF OF THEM!}}
:{{text|yell|Prophet of Akali|Very well, kitten. I see no need to delay your inevitable demise. I look forward to dealing with you just as soon as I finish off these simpletons!}}
:{{text|yell|Har'koa|I THINK NOT. YOU WILL DROP YOUR IMMUNITY, CEASE YOUR RITUAL NOW AND RELEASE THEM!}}
:{{text|yell|Prophet of Akali|NO! I will kill you all!}}
:''The Stun dissipates from the party and you all join the fray.''

After killing the prophet, Har'koa thanks you.
:{{text|yell|Har'koa|Thank you. Once again you have saved us all. I will see you back at Zim'Torga.}}

This quest is solo-able by some classes/specs as you can run back and resurrect yourself after you died, while Har'koa fights the Prophet.

The quest is NOT solo-able by classes/specs that rely on snares and roots (frost mages, moonkin, shadow priest, etc) as the prophet is unaffected by them and will kill you before you can do enough damage to initiate the 2nd phase
