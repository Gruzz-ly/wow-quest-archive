==Objectives==
[[Hexxer Ubungo]] at [[The Argent Stand]] wants you to present 10 Drakkari Offerings to the statue of [[Zim'Abwa]].
* [[Drakkari Offerings]] (10)

==Description==
I am heartened to see the zeal with which your [[Argent Crusade]] is dealing with the [[Scourge]], <race>. I would like to help with your efforts.

The [[Drakkari]] trolls of this once-great city used to make regular offerings to their gods, but now neglect them, or worse.

If you were to make offerings to the gods, they would show their appreciation in return.

Zim'Abwa's statue is just to the southwest. Zim'Abwa would gladly accept your offerings of Drakkari artifacts as a sign that you are protecting Zul'Drak. 

==Rewards==
The following spell will be cast on you: [[Image:Spell Holy FistOfJustice.png|16px]] [[Blessing of Zim'Abwa]]

<Zim'Abwa stares inscrutably to the north and the south.> 

==Completion==
<If Zim'Abwa could move his face, Zim'Abwa would make a vicious grin.>
