== Objectives ==
[[Quetz'lun's Spirit]] has tasked you with the destruction of 12 trolls, either [[Quetz'lun Worshipper]]s or [[Serpent-Touched Berserker]]s, near her [[Soul Font]]s.

Only after you have accomplished this should you return to her at the [[Altar of Quetz'lun]].
* Trolls killed near a [[Soul Font]] (12)

== Description ==
I have something special planned for my favorite high priests. But first you get to prove yourself in laying the foundation for my revenge.

You do still want to live, yes?

As you have seen, my devotees are enjoying their stay here, but now it's time for them to make final restitution.

Do me the smallest of favors if you would, <name>. Lure them near my soul fonts and then put an end to their existences.

They taste so delicious, and their sacrifice will not go in vain, I can assure you. 

== Progress ==
Why do you return when your task is not yet complete? Do you not realize that I can destroy you with but a thought?

Go now, little <race>. Complete that which I commanded of you!

== Completion ==
Exquisite. Perhaps you will be of some use after all.

== Notes ==
[[Image:Soul Fonted.jpg|thumb|A troll afflicted by a Soul Font.]]
* The trolls afflicted by the Soul Font have a purple glow around them, as shown in the image to the right.
* If you inflict more than half their health in damage while they are too far from the stone, you may not receive credit for the kill. This may be an issue for higher level characters completing Level 80 achievements.
