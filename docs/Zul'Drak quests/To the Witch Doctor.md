== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Witch Doctor Khufu]] at [[Zim'Torga]]. 

== Description ==
We [[Zandalari]] could use your help, <name>. We must put an end to what the [[Drakkari]] are doing to their gods!

To the northeast, up the great steps that lead to the next tier of Zul'Drak, lies [[Zim'Torga]]. It is the home to another of the god statues and a refuge that my people are desperately attempting to defend.

I would like for you to travel there and speak to Witch Doctor Khufu. Be warned though, the place is under constant attack from the Drakkari. 

== Completion ==
Greetings to you, <class>. I am glad to hear that Ubungo found someone that he could trust.

Welcome to Zim'Torga.
