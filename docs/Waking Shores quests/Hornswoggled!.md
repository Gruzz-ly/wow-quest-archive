==Objectives==
Use Keshki's Jar of Fireflies to lure 8 [[Bullied Frog]]s to safety.
*[[Pacified Frog]]s Collected (8)
*[[Jar of Fireflies]] (provided)

==Description==
Oh, those [[hornswog]]s make me so mad!

<Keshki stomps her foot angrily, knocking her glasses askew>

They're big, greedy bullies! Just because the place is named after them doesn't mean they get to jump all around and eat everything smaller than them!

Here, use my jar of fireflies--it's a frog-minder's best friend. It'll calm the [[frog]]s enough that you can collect them, and we can get them out of harm's way.

And if any hornswogs get in your way, don't be afraid to bully them back!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 7,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Frogs are gentle creatures! It's not fair to push them around like this!

==Completion==
Whew, all the frogs we helped are in the carrier!

==Progression==
