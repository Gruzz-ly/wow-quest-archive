==Description==
I wish I knew more about how to welcome you to the [[Dragon Isles]], but I'm only the sentry.

<Sendrax motions to the tower behind her.>

You could try talking with Ambassador Fastrasz in the visitor center. He might be able to answer more of your questions before the [[dragon]]s arrive.

Mind your step in there. He was clearing out rubble last I saw.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Ambassador Fastrasz will be eager to meet you.

==Completion==
The embassy is looking better already!

Is every <race> as helpful as you are? I can't wait to meet more.

May your journeys in the [[Dragon Isles]] bring you tranquility, confidence, and camaraderie.

While you travel these isles, reflect on the... <this portion of the tablet has broken off.>
