==Completion==
Your third challenge was meant to have you overcome unfavorable odds. It was to help show me your persistence in all matters.

I believe fighting [[djaradin]] and fixing my statue with the expectation that I would issue you a challenge is more than sufficient to fulfill your victory condition. 

<You think you catch a small smile play across her lips.>

* [[Bottled Essence]]
* {{cost|2|76|20}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]
