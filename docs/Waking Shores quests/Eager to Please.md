==Objectives==
Test the skills of 10 [[Blacktalon Assassin]]s and [[Blacktalon Avenger|Avengers]] at the [[Obsidian Bulwark]].
*[[Blacktalon]] tested (10)
*Meet with Fao the Relentless at the Obsidian Bulwark.

==Description==
We need more troops to defend the Obsidian Citadel. Now that we've got a foothold, it's important to make sure we've got fresh eyes and bodies for the effort.

We have additional reserve troops at the Obsidian Bulwark that could reinforce us.

They are well trained, but they'd benefit from a combat test with someone as skilled and experienced as you. So we know they're ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +2500 [[reputation]] with [[Wrathion (faction)|Wrathion]]
* +150 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

You will also receive:
*[[Equipment]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supplies]]

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. These troops are better prepared than ever, thanks to you. And this effort will take a lot of preparation and muscle.

==Notes==
