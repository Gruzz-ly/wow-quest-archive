==Objectives==
Rescue 3 [[Dragonscale Expedition]] members in the [[Wild Coast]].
*[[Professor Cogcatcher]] rescued
*[[Archivist Rellid]] rescued
*[[Spelunker Lockeye]] rescued
*Meet [[Toddy Whiskers]] in [[Wingrest Embassy]].

==Description==
Don't mistake the expedition's scholarly pursuits as timidness, <name>.

We are not recluses studying books in far-off towers.

We are [[adventurer]]s, hunting down knowledge first-hand in every corner of [[Azeroth]]!

That same passion for adventure often leads us into the path of perils and hazards, and a few expedition members have bitten off a little more than they could chew...

But, hey, the danger makes it more fun!

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
*{{Abilities|Dragonscale Expedition Renown|id=395181|icon=ui_majorfaction_expedition}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]
*[[Large Green Bag]]

==Progress==
Are the expedition members safe?

==Completion==
The dragons are nae here to meet us like [[Wrathion]] said they would...

==Notes==
;Upon accept of all three
:{{Text|say|Pathfinder Jeb|We'd best keep moving.}}
:{{Text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Wrathion said he would meet us at the embassy atop the hill.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|It may be under attack. If it is, then I will be ready to defend my allies.}}
:''The explorers run out of the camp, with the [[Curious Marmoni]] in tow.''

Lockeye is hanging from a chain over lava:
:{{text|say|Spelunker Lockeye|I owe you one, friend.}}
:{{text|say|Spelunker Lockeye|Tell you what, I'll name the next cave I discover after you. "<Name> Cavern!"}}

Rellid is being flown around the area by a few whelps:
:{{text|say|Archivist Rellid|I was almost [[proto-dragon]] food...}}
:{{text|say|Archivist Rellid|How exhilarating! Wait until Toddy hears about this!}}

Cogcatcher is hiding inside a [[Protodragon Rib Cage]]:
:{{text|say|Professor Cogcatcher|Sorry, dragon bones. There'll be other rib cages to study, but only one me!}}
:{{text|say|Professor Cogcatcher|I'll carry these bone fragments to our camp at the embassy. Thanks!}}

Finish up the objectives of all three quests, then head southwest to [[Wingrest Embassy]], where [[Naleidea Rivergleam]] and [[Toddy Whiskers]] are wrapping up a conversation:
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|I am honored to make your acquaintance, [[Sendrax]].}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Well met!}}
