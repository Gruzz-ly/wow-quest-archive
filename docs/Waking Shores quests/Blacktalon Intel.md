==Objectives==
Speak to [[Wrathion]]'s [[Spy|spies]] hidden around [[Scalecracker Keep]].
*[[Talonstalker Kavia]] consulted {{Co|63.06|33.36|Waking Shores}}
*[[Left]] consulted {{Co|63.4|28.8|Waking Shores}}
*[[Right]] consulted {{Co|65|29.4|Waking Shores}}
*Meet Wrathion inside Scalecracker Keep.

==Description==
While [[Majordomo Selistra|Selistra]] and I attracted their eyes above, shadows crept in through their defenses.

My agents, the [[Blacktalon]], are keeping an eye and an ear throughout the keep. Meet them and let them know you're on our side. They'll give you some valuable information on our enemies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|97|48}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
I've put my life in their hands. You can trust them.

==Completion==
That is troubling, to say the least. Yet another reason to fight them.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|We will draw their eyes above for you, <name>. That should give you some cover! We will meet you at a forward position when you've done some good work.}}

Speak with Talonstalker Kavia:
:These [[Qalashi]] are so proud of themselves. In time, the Blacktalon will deal with all of them!

:{{Gossip|quest=|What have you observed about the djaradin?}}
:{{Text|say|Talonstalker Kavia|The [[red dragonflight]] wasn't ready for the surprise attack.}}
:{{Text|say|Talonstalker Kavia|The [[djaradin]] seem to be hoping for a tougher fight next time.}}

Speak with Left before killing [[Meatgrinder Sotok]]:
:I've seen a lot from these giants, none of it good.

:{{Gossip|quest=|What have you observed about the djaradin?}}
:{{text|say|Left|This 'meatgrinder' is a good leader and she's riding high from that victory at the outpost. Her soldiers adore her.}}
:{{text|say|Left|She's going to cause a lot of trouble if she's left alone. Good luck.}}

After killing Meatgrinder Sotok:
:Hmph. Good kill.

:{{Gossip|quest=|What have you observed about the djaradin?}}
:{{Text|say|Left|The djaradin were ancient foes of the [[dragon]]s for a good reason. They're formidable fighters.}}
:{{Text|say|Left|The dragons left and the djaradin seized the moment... and they don't seem like they want to give it back.}}

Speak with Right:
:No fear in the enemy's den?

:<Right grins.>

:{{Gossip|quest=|What have you observed about the djaradin?}}
:{{Text|say|Right|The djaradin consider the outpost a well-earned victory against their ancient foes.}}
:{{Text|say|Right|They're already talking about another raid. And another. And another.}}
:{{Text|say|Right|It seems this is just the beginning.}}

;Upon completion of all three
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|The djaradin scheme to claim the Obsidian Citadel... the black dragonflight's seat of power! Enough of this.}}
:{{Text|say|Majordomo Selistra|Patience, Wrathion.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|I will have the luxury of patience when they are scoured from my home!}}
:''Wrathion flies away.''
:{{Text|emote|Majordomo Selistra sighs.}}
