==Objectives==
Retrieve 10 Juicy Beetle Bits from [[Juicy Beetle]]s in the [[Ruby Lifepools]] in [[Waking Shores]].
*[[Juicy Beetle Bits]] (10)

==Description==
Of course we will take care of the [[Nether whelp|netherwhelps]].

However, we might run low on snacks. The beetles close by are a delicious treat for the little ones.

Can you bring me back some juicy beetle bits? Only the best for the little darlings!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 7,150 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 5x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
The whelps just love to gobble up those beetle bits.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. The young ones will love these!

My goodness. First the [[Black whelp|obsidian whelps]], now this?

I cannot believe I am lucky enough to see this!

==Notes==
Head below to the [[Ruby Life Pools]] and kill the beetles to loot the bits, then return back.
