==Completion==
I was able to expand my studies to the other [[drake]]s of the [[Dragon Isles]]. The red scales most common to the renewed [[proto-drake]]s are not limited to their variety. Each of the other main drakes can show red scales as well! Please, choose a manuscript for the drake you prefer. If you wish to trade for the others, come see me again!
