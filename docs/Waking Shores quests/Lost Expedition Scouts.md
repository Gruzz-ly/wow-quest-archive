==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you: {{Abilities|Lost Expedition Scout Packs|id=388272|icon=inv_cape_special_climbingpack_b_01}}

==Completion==
We've sent out plenty of [[scout]]s since we landed, and a fair number of them haven't returned. Could you keep an eye out for them while you're exploring? They can often be spotted with our standard issue Expedition Scout Pack. Oh, and if you find [[Dragon Isles Artifact|any artifacts]], deliver them [[Cataloger Jakes]]. She'll appreciate it.
