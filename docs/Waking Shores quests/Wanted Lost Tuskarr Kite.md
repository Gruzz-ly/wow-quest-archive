==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Lost Tuskarr Kite.jpg|Lost Tuskarr Kite|The kite sails proudly behind [[Lost Arvillo]] while he is moving...}}
Find the Lost Tuskarr Kite.
*[[Lost Tuskarr Kite]]
*Return to [[Cataloger Jakes]] in the [[Dragonscale Basecamp]].

==Description==
<The posted sign is written in beautiful calligraphy.>

The archivists humbly request that all expedition members seek out the Lost Tuskarr Kite for our artifact archives.

If acquired, please deliver to Cataloger Jakes for processing and compensation.

Some expedition members have reported seeing such a kite attached to a [[tuskarr]] transport along the western coast, but none have been able to reach it as the transport keeps it aloft and out of reach when traveling.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +250 [[reputation]] with the [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

You may also receive:
*[[Equipment]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supplies]]

==Progress==
Do you have something for the archives?

==Completion==
I wonder what all the little scrolls on here say? The archivists'll have fun with this one.

I'll ensure this is properly documented, researched, and archived for the expedition.

==Notes==
The Lost Tuskarr Kite is attached to [[Lost Arvillo]], who travels between the [[Uktulut Outpost]] and [[Uktulut Pier]] on the Waking Shores' western coast. When Lost Arvillo stops at one of the two docks, the kite will temporarily fall down into the water and become interactable.
