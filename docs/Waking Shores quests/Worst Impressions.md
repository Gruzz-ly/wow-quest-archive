==Objectives==
Speak to Tutaqan.
*[[Guard Hakota]] followed
*Listen to [[Tutaqan]] (Optional)
*Speak to Tutaqan

==Description==
<Hakota turns the trophy over in his hand before clasping it. He grimaces.>

So this is what we've been reduced to. An outsider does more work for us in a day than our chieftain has in weeks.

Come. I will take you to him.

Maybe this will be the kick in the stern that he needs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What do you seek to take from us?

==Completion==
<Tutaqan tosses the trophy on the ground nearby, tired and disinterested.>

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Guard Hakota|Follow me. I would bet my left tusk he's in the ottuk holt. He's been there for weeks.}}
:''Guard Hakota rides into the village.''
:{{text|emote|[[Uktulut Villager]] hushes the other tuskarr and turns to watch you suspiciously. They whisper something to each other.}}
:''At the village's largest building, [[Crafter Kuliqa]] and [[Elder Unujaak]] are speaking to [[Tutaqan]].''
:{{text|say|Crafter Kuliqa|So, get out there with your hunters and do your job! I can't arm our people with nothing.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Unujaak|Food stores are running low. The river is dwindling, and our anglers cannot fish unprotected. We need you, Chieftain.}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|I'm sorry, but there is nothing I can do. I will not lose anyone else to... Who is this?}}
:{{text|emote|Guard Hakota tosses the djaradin trophy to Tutaqan.}}
:{{text|say|Guard Hakota|Look what has happened, Tutaqan! We rely on outsiders to fight our enemies for us while you drag your feet!}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|Let them fight. We've already paid too high a price for fighting.}}
:{{text|say|Guard Hakota|Your people are the ones paying that price now. Maybe the outsider can fix that for you too.}}
:''Guard Hakota leaves and returns to guarding the road.''

;Speaking to Tutaqan
When the conversation is ongoing:

:What do you want from us?
:{{gossip|I have slain your enemies. You have seen proof of my deeds. {{text|red|<Skip current conversation.>}}}}

When the conversation is done:
:<Tutaqan looks past you with a despondent frown, watching the guard ride away.>

:{{gossip|I have slain your enemies. You have seen proof of my deeds.}}

:{{text|say|Tutaqan|This means nothing to me. Not anymore.}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|Take care of whatever Kuliqa and Unujaak want. I wish to return to my thoughts.}}

;On completion
:''Tutaqan turns and walks into the building behind him, then sits, his back to you and the others.''
:{{text|say|Crafter Kuliqa|A fine chieftain and huntmaster you are, hiding away while the [[djaradin]] push us out!}}
:{{text|emote|Elder Unujaak sighs heavily, wringing his hands.}}

If you speak to Tutaqan again:
:<Tutaqan does not acknowledge you.>
