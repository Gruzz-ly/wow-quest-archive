[[Dragon]]s have long fascinated me. Being here is a dream come true! I have already learned much about the renewed [[Proto-dragon|proto-drakes]] of the [[Waking Shores]]. Would you like to see one of the manuscripts I have put together? I have made many observations, and would be willing to trade for others as well!
