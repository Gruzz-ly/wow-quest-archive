==Objectives==
Locate Ayasanth in [[Smoldering Perch]].
*[[Ayasanth]] located
*Speak with Ayasanth in Smoldering Perch.

==Description==
Another outsider arrived yesterday. She called herself an "emissary" for the [[red dragonflight]] and asked for an audience with our leader, the [[Cygenoth|Voice of Neltharion]].

But the Voice got terribly mad. He said that the [[Deathwing|Earth-Warder]] was testing us, and that we had to execute her!

I know we're not supposed to trust outsiders, but we don't have to kill them! Please, help me save her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
This hatchling asked for your help?

<Ayasanth exhales with relief.>

Perhaps we can save the [[Worldbreakers]] after all.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Ingot|The emissary needs us! We've got to help her!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Worldbreaker Escapee]]|We can't, Ingot. We barely made it out ourselves. If the Voice of Neltharion discovers we left...}}
:{{Text|say|Ingot|Well, if you don't help, I'll find somebody... Oh! There's a somebody now! Hello! A Worldbreaker needs your aid!}}

;Upon accept of both
:{{Text|say|Ingot|They locked the red dragonflight emissary in a cage down below. I'll meet you there!}}

Don't go in the cave just yet! Ayasanth is locked in a cage on the surface, and Ingot will pop up next to her.

;Finding Ingot and Ayasanth
:{{Text|say|Ingot|Over here!}}
:{{Text|say|Ayasanth|Reinforcements at last. Did [[Majordomo Selistra|the majordomo]] send you?}}
