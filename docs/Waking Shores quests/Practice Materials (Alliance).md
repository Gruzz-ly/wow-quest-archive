==Objectives==
Collect 15 Primal Proto-Whelp Scales.
*[[Primal Proto-Whelp Scale]] (15)
*Meet [[Thaelin Darkanvil]] in [[Wingrest Embassy]].

==Description==
The [[proto-drake]]s here are unlike any I've seen before.

Their scales appear to be naturally flame-resistant, stronger than steel, and don't lose flexibility in the process. Incredible.

The artisans are clamoring to get their hands on some to work with.

Start with the whelps. The smaller scales should be more pliable until we've mastered our techniques with 'em.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
You got those scales yet?

==Completion==
<Thaelin carefully studies the scales.>

Brilliant. Our artisans'll have no problem puttin' these to good use!

==Notes==

:''The explorers run out of the camp, with the [[Curious Marmoni]] in tow.''

[[Primal Proto-Whelp Scale]]s drop from [[Primal Proto-Whelp]]s on the [[Wild Coast]].

Finish up the objectives of all three quests, then head southwest to [[Wingrest Embassy]], where [[Naleidea Rivergleam]] and [[Toddy Whiskers]] are wrapping up a conversation:
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|I am honored to make your acquaintance, Sendrax.}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Well met!}}
