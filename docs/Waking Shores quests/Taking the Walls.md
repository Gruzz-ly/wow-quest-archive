==Notes==
;Speaking with Wrathion

:{{Gossip|I am ready to assist you.}}
:''The adventurer hops on Wrathion and they fly toward a rampart.''
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|I know not from where you hail, friend, but I cannot fault such a timely arrival.}}
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|[[Outland]]... were you expecting to defeat this entire army on your own, little brother? A bold move.}}

Destroy the first arbalest and hop on Wrathion again.
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|You underestimate me. Perhaps you have been too long away?}}
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|Perhaps you bear more of our father's stubbornness than even you realize.}}

Destroy the second arbalest and hop on Wrathion again. Sabellian and his brood can be seen blasting the djaradin with fire.

;Engaging Champion Choruk
:{{Text|say|Champion Choruk|Come face me, weak one!}}
:{{Text|say|Champion Choruk|Your efforts will be buried under our advance!}}

;Defeating Champion Choruk
:{{Text|say|Champion Choruk|More... will follow...}}
