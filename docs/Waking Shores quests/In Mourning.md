==Objectives==
Attempt to help Tutaqan.
*Help offered to [[Tutaqan]]

==Description==
This did not need to happen. Those cowardly [[djaradin]]... slaughtering our [[ottuk]]s and leaving them for their twisted beasts to pick clean...

I do not take Tutaqan's grief lightly, but I worry for the future of our people if he dwells in darkness and grief for too long. 

We need to act.

It looks like he was headed to the overlook above us. You have done him a great favor this day. He may be open to any good will you can show him. Please, see what can be done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|80|90}}
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Please leave me be.

==Completion==
<Tutaqan rubs his face with both hands, sighing deeply. He looks haggard.>

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Elder Unujaak|<Name>, you brought [[Ipko]] back to us. If he will listen to anyone right now, it's you.}}

;Tutaqan
As you approach:
:{{text|emote|Tutaqan does not react as you approach. He appears focused on the nearby ottuks, his eyes still wet.}}

Speak to him:
:I asked to be left alone. What do you want?

:{{gossip|Is there anything I can do to help?}}
:{{gossip|Your village needs you. Snap out of it.}}
:{{gossip|<Hold out your arms to offer a hug.>}}

All three options will complete the objective and receive the same response:
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|No. I need time to muster the strength to... do what must be done.}}

==Progression==
{{The Chieftain's Duty}}
