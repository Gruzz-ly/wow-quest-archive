Use the Smoke Diffuser to calm and gather 8 Bothersome Bees, then release them near the lake.
*[[Bothersome Bee]]s bagged (8)
*Bothersome Bees relocated
*[[Smoke Diffuser]] (provided)

==Description==
Oh, thank the [[Alexstrasza|Life-Binder]]! Someone with empty hands!

These gardens are normally a lovely playground for our whelps, but the bees have multiplied uncontrollably. The blooms returned with vigor--and so have the bees. The [[Dragon whelp|whelps]] are terrified, the [[dragon]]s are annoyed, and just yesterday one was stung and--

<[[Vaeros]] takes a deep breath to center himself then looks at you pleadingly.>

Will you please gather up the bees and relocate them to the lake? Take this smoke diffuser; it will calm them down.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Beetender's Hood
|Wasp Repelling Skullcap
|Stingerproof Helmet
|Reinforced Beekeeper's Helm
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 7,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Try not to be too rough with the bees. They are doing their best. We all are.

==Completion==
Please tell me the relocation went well.

<Vaeros lets out a deep sigh of relief.>

Hopefully the bees will be kept busy pollinating the plants that are far away from our whelps. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Vaeros|The bees may put up a fight when startled, but you do not need to harm them. The smoke will put them to sleep after a few moments.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Adazius]]|And do try to be quiet about it. The whelplings hardly need to be distracted by an [[adventurer]] causing a scene.}}
:{{Text|say|Vaeros|They are playing, Adazius, not studying. I am sure they would love to watch <name> cleaning up the garden for them.}}
:{{Text|say|Adazius|Which is precisely my point.}}

;First use of the diffuser
:{{Text|bossemote|The bee is angered but starts getting drowsy from the smoke!}}

After using the diffuser on them, wait for a few seconds, then grab them.

After collecting enough, use the Bee Free! extra action button at {{Co|56.97|70.81|Waking Shores}}, spawning [[Relocated Bee]]s.
