Help Mother Elion restore the area.
*Sweep [[Fallen Leaves ]](2)
*Pull [[Overgrown Weeds ]](3)
*Polish [[Ruby Shrineguard]]

==Description==
I can scarcely believe it! Eggs of the [[Black dragonflight|Black Dragonflight]]! After all this time!

But look at the state of this place! It will not do at all! Nothing is too good for these eggs.

Though with [[Wrathion|those two]] [[Sabellian|blowhards]] squabbling like children for the [[Alexstrasza|Life-Binder]]'s favor, you can bet they have not spared a thought for us! You, though, will not leave an old egg tender all alone, will you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
We are not done yet, young one.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I feel like we have a future once more.

==Notes==
Simply click and pull on the nearby objects as well as the drakonid by the stairs.
