==Objectives==
Travel to the Skytop Observatory in [[Waking Shores]].
*Speak with [[Celormu]] to start the race {{co|57.7|66.7|Waking Shores}}
*Race to the [[Skytop Observatory]]
*Meet [[Lord Andestrasz]] at the Skytop Observatory.

==Description==
Those are the basics of riding a [[drake]]! You are doing quite well.

Now, I would like to introduce you to some of the others involved in this adventure. We have made a home for ourselves over at the Skytop Observatory.

Celormu will be able to help guide you there. Speak to him when you feel ready to take to the skies!

See you there!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I suppose I was so eager to show you our foundation here, I may have flown a bit too fast. My apologies!

There is not much to look at for the moment as it has been a long time since someone inhabited these terraces. However, we will make them our home once again.

Now, let us introduce you to everyone!
