==Objectives==
Deliver 5 Lava Beetles to [[Haephesta]] at the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]].

==Description==
Are you looking for work, herbalist? The [[Artisan's Consortium]] asked me to gather some beetles for their customers.

The land is plentiful, but not so much that I can simply step away and be back with their request.

But if you venture out, perhaps you could collect a few beetles on your way?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|30|50}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Artisan's Consortium - Dragon Isles Branch]]
