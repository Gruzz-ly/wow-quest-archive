==Objectives==
Craft a Heart in a Bottle {{Profquality|3}} with any crafting profession.
*Craft Heart in a Bottle (Quality 3)
*Show [[Thomas Bright|Thomas]] the [[Miguel's Gift|Gift]]
*Deliver the gift to [[Miguel Bright]] at the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]].
*[[Thomas's Empty Bottle]] & [[Fiery Spirit]] (3) (provided)

==Description==
Now that we have the [[elemental]] essence gathered, do you think you could put them in this bottle?

It's a simple recipe that you can craft the same way as any other recipe.

If you lost, or use up the high-quality reagents, you can always get more from the elementals at [[Hornswog Hollow]].

|Crowded Crate of Mined Materials

|Stocked Sack of Hale Herbs
|Populous Pack of Castoff Cloth
|Topped Trunk of Disenchanted Detritus

You will also receive:
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Artisan's Consortium - Dragon Isles Branch]]

==Progress==
Hello, can I help you?

==Completion==
Wow, this is so sweet! Oh, Thomas is just a darling.

Look at this. So well-crafted. Did you help with this? If so, thank you, a thousand times thank you.

Give Thomas my sincerest thanks, would you?

==Notes==
After accepting the quest, Thomas provides [[Thomas's Empty Bottle]] and the three {{item|Fiery Spirit|s}} from before. Any ''Dragonflight''-level crafting profession has the ability to craft [[Miguel's Gift#Epic]]. Should the crafter use low-quality ingredients, the craft may fail, becoming [[Miguel's Gift]]. If that happens, return to the [[Hornswog Hollow]] and collect more Fiery Spirits to try again.

;Speaking with Thomas
:How goes the craft?

:{{Gossip|quest=|I have Miguel's gift.}}

::Wonderful! Oh, it looks amazing! Thank you!

::You know, making a high quality craft takes more than your skill as a crafter and the quality of the reagents you use. 

::It's also about the difficulty of the craft, the inspiration you find, and how you specialize in your craft.

::{{Gossip|Crafting difficulty?}}
:::Every craft comes with its own difficulty. The quality of your creation depends on your skill relative to the difficulty.

:::But your skill is not just how much you've practiced, it's also the reagents you put in and the specialized knowledge you've learned.

:::{{Gossip|Okay.}}

::{{Gossip|Inspiration?}}

:::Sometimes inspiration strikes you, and your craft is critically improved!

:::The best way to encourage inspiration is to be properly equipped. Inspect your gear to see if your tools spark inspiration.

:::{{Gossip|Okay.}}

::{{Gossip|Specialization?}}

:::If you haven't already, you will eventually hone your craft enough to start specializing.

:::Specializing in your craft is a way to improve your ability to craft certain items, gather certain materials, or otherwise gain unique skills that other professionals don't have.

:::My husband Miguel can tell you more about specialization.

:::{{Gossip|Okay.}}

::{{Gossip|Yes, I understand.}}

:::Excellent! Now then, I know I've asked a lot of you already, but would you be so kind as to deliver this gift to Miguel?

:::Seeing as how you helped create it, it's only fair that you get to see the smile on his face. Just remember to tell him it's from me.

;Upon completion
:''Thomas runs up to Miguel.''
