==Objectives==
Find Scout Ri'tal in [[Hornswog Hollow]].
*Speak to [[Scout Ri'tal]]
*Speak to [[Scout Francisco]]
*[[Orb of Primal Gales]]

==Description==
Air is a powerful element. It cuts through stone and fills sails to take us where we need to go.

My hypothesis is that air will be the most effective at removing this barrier. It's simple, really.

My [[scout]]s report they've found the Orb of Primal Gales. Scout Ri'tal can lead you to it. You can find them near Hornswog Hollow. Quickly!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 7,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Have you found the scout?

==Completion==
[[Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher|Tae'shara]] stays above many tasks, preferring to delegate. I can see why the Orb of Primal Gales interests her. I'll hold onto it for now.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Acadia Chistlestone]]|Don't be daft, Tae'shara. Fire is more powerful than air. It consumes it!}}
:{{Text|say|Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher|And yet without air, what would fire be? We are not working in a vacuum, Acadia.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Elementalist Taiyang]]|Your hypotheses have merit, but I think we will find the answer lies in combining our efforts.}}

;Approaching Ri'tal
:{{Text|say|Scout Ri'tal|Hey! Over here!}}

;Speaking with Ri'tal
:We found the Orb of Primal Gales, but it's made the wind go berserk!

:{{Gossip|Where is the orb now?}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Ri'tal|Francisco had it a second ago. He's just up ahead!}}

Heading toward Francisco, the area is full of Chaotic Updrafts, and the player character has the Wild Winds debuff.
:{{Text|say|Scout Francisco|My head just keeps spinning...}}

;Speaking with Francisco
:I had the orb in my hands--it spun me in circles and made all these whirlwinds!

:{{Gossip|Where is it now?}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Francisco|The orb is on the ledge over there. Please get the whirlwinds to stop. If I hit another, I'm gonna... urp...}}

Continue further to find a small vortex that propels you toward the ledge with the orb.

==Progression==
{{Beyond the Barrier}}
