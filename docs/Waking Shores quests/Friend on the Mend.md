==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|emote|Lillistrasza sniffles.}}
:{{Text|say|Lillistrasza|No... Happy Duck... no no no...}}

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Lillistrasza|Don't cry, Happy Duck. <Name> will help us!}}
:''Lillistrasza joins the player character.''

;Speaking with Lillistrasza
*I have lots of toys back home. I put them in a big pile to sit on.

:But Happy Duck is a friend and not a toy. That's why he gets to sit on top of me!
*How sad for Happy Duck to get hurt by a little old tree...

:If only he had scales! Like me! Maybe after we fix him we can find him some scales.
*If Happy Duck stays hurt long... will he become Sad Duck?

:<Lillistrasza shakes her head furiously.>

:No. Impossible.

:{{Gossip|Where can I find a bead?}}
::[[Dragonspawn]] make all kinds of things and sell them just over there!

::<Lillistrasza points to the south-west side of the Ruby Lifeshrine.>

::Sometimes things cost money. But for such an itty-bitty thing like an eye, maybe they will just let us take it? Pretty please go see?

::{{Gossip|I have something else to ask.}}

:{{Gossip|Where can I find scraps of fabric?}}
::There are lots of [[dragon]]s here with pretty new clothes.

::I bet if you ask the prettiest of them, they'll have some ugly old clothes you can take pieces of.

::{{Gossip|I have something else to ask.}}

:{{Gossip|Where can I find feathers?}}
::Feathers come from ducks!

::But it's rude to take them right off the ducks while they are still using them.

::Maybe you could look and see if there's any the ducks don't need anymore?

{{item|Soft Ruby Feather|s}} are at {{co|61.0|69.5|Waking Shores}} found by the small pools on the north side of the shrine.

;Approaching a [[Peaceful Duck]]
:{{Text|say|Lillistrasza|Look! Just like you, Happy Duck! Quack quack!}}

[[File:Friend on the Mend - Lyrastrasz and Rathestrasz.jpg|thumb|[[Lyrastrasz]] and [[Rathestrasz]]]]
A [[Scrap of Fabric]] can be obtained by speaking with the dragons in their visage forms. While many can be asked, only some will have it.
:{{Gossip|Do you have any spare scraps of fabric?}}

;No luck
*{{Text|say|Alas, I haven't any to spare.}}
*{{Text|say|No, I'm afraid I can't part with any.}}

;Luck
[[Rathestrasz]], [[Valdestrasz]], and [[Tirastrasza]] give the scrap:
*{{Text|say|Valdestrasz|Of course! Here, have a piece of this banner. It's from a great foe I vanquished!}}
*{{Text|say|Rathestrasz|I can spare a scrap of cloth, so long as you don't mind the stains of horn-polish.}}
*{{Text|say|Tirastrasza|Have this, little one. It's from an old cloak of mine, kept me warm for many years.}}

[[File:Glass Bead.jpg|thumb|Glass Bead]]
The [[Glass Bead]] is on a table next to [[Krendisc]]:
:{{Text|say|Lillistrasza|Oooh, how sparkly! How colorful!}}
:{{Text|say|Lillistrasza|Happy Duck would like a sparkly, colorful eye, I bet.}}
:{{Text|say|Krendisc|Hold on, what have you got there?}}
:{{Text|say|Lillistrasza|We need a new eye for Happy Duck! Pretty please, it's important!}}
:{{Text|say|Krendisc|I see. Well, it is just a small bead. And if it's for a good cause... go ahead, little one.}}

;All material collected
:{{Text|say|Lillistrasza|Yes! Happy Duck, now we can fix you!}}
:{{Text|say|Lillistrasza|We just gotta... find someone who knows how to do that.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|[[Mahra Treebender]]|Mend this hole... stitch on these feathers... and let's not forget the eye...}}
:{{Text|say|Mahra Treebender|And there you are! Good as new.}}
:{{Text|say|Lillistrasza|Happy Duck! You're beautiful!}}
:{{Text|say|Lillistrasza|Thank you, thank you, thank you!}}
:{{Text|say|Mahra Treebender|In fact, there is enough material here to sew another toy duck entirely.}}
:{{Text|emote|Lillistrasza gasps.}}
:{{Text|say|Lillistrasza|A little brother? For Happy Duck?}}
:{{Text|say|Mahra Treebender|Why don't we call him Lucky Duck? He can go on adventures, like <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Lillistrasza|Happy Duck for me! Lucky Duck for you!}}
