==Objectives==
Collect 8 Whalebone Pieces and 30 Waterlogged Wood.
*[[Whalebone Fragment]] (8)
*[[Waterlogged Wood]] (30)
*Materials delivered to Crafter Kuliqa

==Description==
Bah! I can't believe [[Tutaqan]]'s still moping around when we need him to command his guards and hunters!

We used to trade with the [[Iskaara]] at our pier, but that's gone belly up with the [[djaradin]] closing in and scaring off our traders. Half of last month's supplies and most of our boats are still lost out in the shallow river.

The guards and hunters want to help, but they've got no weapons. You look like you can protect yourself, so get out there and grab something I can make spears with!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Once our guards and hunters have new weapons, I can pull together a group to gather the rest of the wreckage.

==Completion==
It's about time! They're a little wet, but I'll be able to make many fine weapons with these.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Crafter Kuliqa|I'm not willing to let [[Uktulut tribe|Uktulut]] rot like [[Tutaqan]] is. Get me those supplies!}}
:''She walks off to the village's crafting area.''

;On return
:{{text|say|Crafter Kuliqa|Well now! The outsider is better at tracking things down than our huntmaster is!}}

;Speaking to Kuliqa
:{{gossip|<Hand over the materials.>}}
:{{text|say|Crafter Kuliqa|That's what I like to see, <name>! Finally, some good materials.}}
:''She begins making a spear on the anvil in front of her.''
:{{text|say|Crafter Kuliqa|Stand there and look pretty while I work these into some real tuskarr weaponry!}}
:{{text|say|Crafter Kuliqa|Hah! There! One of my finest spears yet, a small taste of what those giant fiery bastards have coming.}}
