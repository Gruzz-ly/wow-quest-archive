==Objectives==
Meet [[Emberthal]] at the [[Obsidian Observatory]].

==Description==
In delving into the archives here, I've found threads that point towards the Obsidian Observatory as a place of personal importance to the [[Deathwing|Earth-Warder]]. I can only guess what knowledge it may contain about the history of [[Black dragonflight|our flight]].

Given Emberthal's interest in the subject, I informed her of my discovery. I pray that wasn't a mistake.

She has gone ahead to scout. Please, keep an eye on her. She is a competent soldier, but this subject is... troubling. Who knows what truths you may uncover.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
I am confident I will be able to handle anything we encounter. Still, given the matter at hand... it was wise of Edress to send you to accompany me.
