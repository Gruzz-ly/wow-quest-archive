==Completion==
Greetings and welcome to the [[Dragon Isles]].

The blade at your side shows me you are a proficient skinner, though you seem new to these lands.

Would you like me to show you how to skin the beasts of the Dragon Isles?

==Notes==
This quest is only available if the character knows Skinning but not Dragon Isles Skinning.
