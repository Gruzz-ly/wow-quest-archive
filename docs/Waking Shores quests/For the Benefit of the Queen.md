Ride with Majordomo Selistra to the Ruby Lifeshrine.

*Show Queen [[Alexstrasza]] the [[Infused Dragon Egg|infused egg]]

We safeguard our precious eggs to protect the future of all [[dragonflight]]s. The [[Primalists]] do not simply threaten pain or anguish with their actions.

They threaten us with extinction.

I must inform our queen at once.

The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Valdrakken Accord Renown|id=395209|icon=ui_majorfaction_valdrakken|Unlock Renown levels for the Valdrakken Accord faction.}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
This is dire... but our flight has suffered many tragedies over the years. We shall endure.

==Notes==
Speak with Selistra:
:Danger rises from every corner as the land wakes from its slumber. We must make haste if we are to safely reach our home.

:{{Gossip|quest=|Take me with you to see the queen, please.}}
:''The adventurer hops on Selistra's back as they preview [[Dragonriding]] on the way south to the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]].''
:{{Text|say|Majordomo Selistra|Very well. Just this once.}}
:{{Text|say|Majordomo Selistra|Hold on tight... If you can.}}
:{{Text|say|Majordomo Selistra|The tenders alerted me as soon as a [[caravan]] of eggs went missing. But to hear what happened to them...}}
:{{Text|say|Majordomo Selistra|[[Red dragonflight|Our flight]] has endured many blows over the years. We had just started to recover... and now this.}}
:{{Text|say|Majordomo Selistra|The red dragonflight was charged with nurturing life.}}
:{{Text|say|Majordomo Selistra|We must stop the Primalists. We must stop the [[proto-dragon]]s!}}
:''Selistra drops the adventurer off at the foot of Alexstrasza before shifting back to their visage form.''
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Welcome to the Ruby Lifeshrine, <name>. I am glad my Majordomo has brought you to me safely... but what brings you here so urgently?}}

Speak with Alexstrasza:
:The Ruby Lifeshrine was once the center of our flight. We must restore its former glory.

:{{Gossip|<Offer the rescued egg to Queen Alexstrasza.>}}

A cutscene plays out:
{{#ev:youtube|gOHUREa9khk}}
:''Alexstrasza observes the egg and the [[Ruby Oathstone]].''
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|What has happened to this egg?}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|The energies that surround it are...}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|This is dire.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|If the egg can be saved, it will be here, within the sacred waters of the [[Life Pools]].}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Once the young of [[dragonkin]]d filled this vibrant place.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|And the Ruby Oathstone, the very symbol of our calling, cast its bright glow high into the air for all to see.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Now it lies dormant, as do all the [[oathstone]]s.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I suspect they fell quiet when we relinquished our Aspectral power.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|There are so many things we left behind.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|But now that we have come home, we can fulfill the callings of our flights and renew the five oathstones.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|And through their unity, our absent power shall be restored.}}
