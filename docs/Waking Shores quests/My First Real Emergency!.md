==Objectives==
Convince [[Sendrax]] to fire her emergency signal flare to alert the [[dragon]]s of your arrival.
*Signal flare sent
*Wait for the dragons' arrival
*Meet [[Wrathion]] in [[Wingrest Embassy]].

==Description==
<Sendrax looks puzzled.>

I have never known [[Majordomo Selistra|the majordomo]] to be late to anything, much less THIS late to something THIS important.

Most unusual...

<Sendrax perks up at a thought.>

I could use my emergency signal flare to alert them to your arrival. Then they would come rushing to greet you immediately!

I've never fired my emergency signal flare before, though...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Completion==
Well then, <name>. What do you say? Do you fancy a fight alongside your newfound dragon acquaintances?

I assure you, there is no quicker way to earn their trust.

:{{Text|say|Sendrax|Oh yes. In times of trouble, there is no one Queen [[Alexstrasza]] trusts more.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Toddy Whiskers]]|Here they come!}}
:{{Text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|Incredible!}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Ah, look who we have here!}}
:{{Text|say|Majordomo Selistra|We saw the flare and assumed the worst. What is wrong, Cadet Sendrax?}}
:{{Text|say|Sendrax|Majordomo. The new arrivals... were wondering where you were... and I thought--}}
:{{Text|say|Majordomo Selistra|I see.}}
:{{Text|say|Majordomo Selistra|There was a reason for our absence. An ancient rival, the [[djaradin]], have stirred to violence once again.}}
:{{Text|say|Majordomo Selistra|[[Dragonheart Outpost]] has already fallen.}}
