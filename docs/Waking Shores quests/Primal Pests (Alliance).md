==Objectives==
Kill 10 Primal Proto-drakes on the [[Wild Coast]].
*[[Primal Proto-Drake|Primal Proto-drakes]] slain (10)
*Meet [[Scalecommander Azurathel]]  in [[Wingrest Embassy]].

==Description==
<[[Scalecommander Azurathel|Azurathel]] glances suspiciously at the [[proto-dragon]]s lurking on the ridge behind him.>

I'd swear that those proto-dragons edge closer to camp every time I turn my back...

Those are not the [[dragon]]s [[Wrathion]] invited us here to meet.

Proto-dragons are ruthless predators who cannot be reasoned with. We must be ruthless in return.

Cull their numbers to keep their ambitions in check, or this expedition will be over before it begins.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Always keep an eye on the skies.

==Completion==
That may dissuade them from attacking the expedition camps for a time.

It's eat or be eaten in the [[Dragon Isles]], <name>. You'd do well to remember that.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of all three
:{{Text|say|Pathfinder Jeb|We'd best keep moving.}}
:{{Text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Wrathion said he would meet us at the embassy atop the hill.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|It may be under attack. If it is, then I will be ready to defend my allies.}}
:''The explorers run out of the camp, with the [[Curious Marmoni]] in tow.''

Kill [[Primal Proto-Drake]]s and [[Primal Proto-Dragon]]s.

Finish up the objectives of all three quests, then head southwest to [[Wingrest Embassy]], where [[Naleidea Rivergleam]] and [[Toddy Whiskers]] are wrapping up a conversation:
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|I am honored to make your acquaintance, Sendrax.}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|Well met!}}
