'''Wrathion Awaits''' begins the fourth chapter of five in the [[Waking Shores storyline]].

==Objectives==
Meet with [[Wrathion]] at the [[Obsidian Bulwark]].

==Description==
These eggs represent a new generation of [[dragonkin]]d. They must be protected and fostered. Yet... my heart aches, and I worry for Wrathion. I fear his stubborn determination will lead to folly.

You have been a trusted friend over the years, <name>. Perhaps you can go in my place, and help him.

Seek him out at the Obsidian Bulwark. And please, watch over him. There are so few of [[Black dragonflight|his flight]] left.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, champion--your arrival is most fortuitous. With you here now, my plan will certainly succeed.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Please, find Wrathion. He will need your aid if we are to renew the [[Obsidian Oathstone]].}}

Approach Wrathion and [[Scalecommander Emberthal]] at the [[Obsidian Bulwark]]:
:{{text|say|Wrathion|I have gathered the Blacktalon and we are preparing to take back the Obsidian Citadel.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Your presence on this mission is most welcome. The dracthyr are formidable soldiers!}}
:{{text|say|Talonstalker Gazi|It's <name>! The one everyone is talking about.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|The Obsidian Citadel may hold secrets of my people's past. I would not miss a chance to reclaim it.}}

Once a character has completed the quest chain, the [[bronze dragon]] [[Kalendormu]] will appear for alts and offer a skip taking players from this quest to [[The Last Eggtender]].
