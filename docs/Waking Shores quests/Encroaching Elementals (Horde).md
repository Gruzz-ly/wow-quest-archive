==Objectives==
Kill 15 primal elementals in [[Wingrest Embassy]].

Clear out the elementals encroaching from the north, so the expedition can focus on their noble pursuits.

You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

For the Dragonscale Expedition!
