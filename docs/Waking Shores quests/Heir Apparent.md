'''Heir Apparent''' alongside [[Claimant to the Throne]] begin the final chapter of the [[Waking Shores storyline]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Sabellian]]'s followers.
*Speak with [[Baskilian]]
*Speak with [[Forgemaster Bazentus|Bazentus]]
*Speak with [[Archivist Edress]]

==Description==
As [[Neltharion]]'s heir and leader of the only surviving flight of [[black dragon]]s, I was not expecting to find myself in competition for my birthright. Particularly not against a self-important whelp younger than you, mortal.

Nevertheless, if you need more than these self-evident facts, feel free to speak with members of my flight. There's no need to take my word on the subject.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
My flight awaits.

==Completion==
I trust that you understand, now.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Baskilian
:{{Gossip|What can you tell me about Sabellian?}}
:{{Text|say|Baskilan|Sabellian rallied us on [[Outland]], not only saving us from death, but from the corruption that befell our kin.}}
:{{Text|say|Baskilan|All the rest--the other flights, glory-starved mortals, even that pretentious "prince"--chose to murder the afflicted rather than aid us.}}

;Speaking with Bazentus
:{{Gossip|What can you tell me about Sabellian?}}
:{{Text|say|Forgemaster Bazentus|A leader is like a finely forged sword, they must be balanced, strong, and of pure metal.}}
:{{Text|say|Forgemaster Bazentus|Though I like [[Wrathion]], he is untempered. Sabellian has been forged in fire, I believe he is what we need in a leader.}}

;Speaking with Archivist Edress
:{{Gossip|What can you tell me about Sabellian?}}
:{{Text|say|Archivist Edress|Where an Aspect failed, Sabellian succeeded. Despite [[Deathwing]]'s madness, despite the rage of the [[gronn]], Sabellian and his kin survived, allowing us to achieve this moment.}}

==Progression==
{{A Purpose Restored}}
