==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|I will be denied no longer. Come, <name>, let us finish the repairs.}}

;Speaking with Wrathion
:So close to completing my destiny.

:{{gossip|You can now repair the Obsidian Oathstone.}}

An [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays out.
{{#ev:youtube|emCFPsdQwII}}
:''Wrathion places the reforged fragments onto the oathstone, repairing itself. In the distance, Sabellian and his dragons fly toward the throne on top of the citadel.''
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Sabellian? What is he doing?}}

On the other side,
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Be swift, <name>. I must claim the throne now!}}

Hop on Wrathion. At the [[Obsidian Throne]], another in-engine cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|cGhOabzlh5c}}
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|Ah, young Wrathion. I owe you my thanks--}}
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|Your help was invaluable in securing my rightful place on the Obsidian Throne.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Oh... I believe you are mistaken--this throne, this legacy--is my birthright.}}
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|No. The mistake is yours. I was anointed caretaker of [[Black dragonflight|this flight]] by [[Neltharion]] himself.}}
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|So let me be clear... when all is said and done, I will be [[Dragon Aspects|the Aspect]] of the black dragonflight.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Is that so? May the worthiest [[dragon]] win.}}

Completing the quest also awards the "Wrathion's Gambit" criterion of [[Waking Hope]].

As of [[patch 10.1.0]], Wrathion may drop the player midway to the journey. In that case, simply release and fly on your own to the Throne.
