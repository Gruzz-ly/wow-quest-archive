Find the Ruby Lifeband.
*[[Ruby Lifeband]]

==Description==
<The posted sign is written in hasty scratches.>

[[Dragonscale Expedition|Expedition members]] have reported a [[Primalist]] attack on the Ruby Life Pools, threatening the destruction of countless artifacts stored by our [[dragon]] allies there.

[[Toddy Whiskers|Toddy]] and [[Naleidea Rivergleam|Naleidea]] urge all combat-ready members to join the fight, and seek out the Ruby Lifeband if you are able.

It is a unique, priceless artifact that must be preserved.

If acquired, please deliver to [[Cataloger Jakes]] for safekeeping until the dragons may safely retrieve it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +250 [[reputation]] with the [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

You may also receive:
*[[Equipment]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]
*2x [[Primal Chaos]]

==Progress==
Do you have something for the archives?

==Completion==
They say this was handcrafted by [[Alexstrasza]] herself? Thank the tides you saved it.

I'll ensure this is properly documented and researched while we have it for safekeeping.

==Patch changes==
