==Objectives==
Heal 8 Injured Hornstriders in [[Overflowing Rapids]].
*[[Injured Hornstrider]]s healed (8)
*[[Pungent Salve]] (provided)

==Description==
I may not know anything about [[water elemental]]s, but I do know [[hornstrider]]s!

I've thrown together a salve that'll keep the 'striders healthy and ready to fight. I've never had a chance to apply it to a real hornstrider, but I've done all the studying I can do.

It's time to put on a brave face and lather them up!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 7,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Don't go eating that salve. It might be safe for a 'strider, but I'm sure it'd mess with a blood elf's stomach something awful.

==Completion==
It's downright uplifting to see the hornstriders take back their home. You brought that to them, <name>. Thank you for your help.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
:{{Text|say|Dazakros|Give those elementals something to think about!}}

Applying the salve on the Injured Hornstreaders turns them into Avenging Hornstriders.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Dazakros|Thank you for your help, <name>. I know a lot about the 'striders, but I have a lot to learn about the world they live in.}}
:{{Text|say|Dazakros|Seems books can't teach you everything! Guess it's time to dig in and get some hands-on experience.}}
:{{Text|say|Dazakros|Those elementals need to watch out. There's a new caretaker in town!}}

If completed as the last quest in the questline, it also awards the "Ruby Lifecalling" criterion of [[Sojourner of the Waking Shores]].
