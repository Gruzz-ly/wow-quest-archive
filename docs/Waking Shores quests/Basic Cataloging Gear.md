==Objectives==
Use the [[Expedition Supply Kit]] to research [[Cataloging Gear]].

==Description==
Every expedition cataloger deserves their very own camera!

You don't need to give yours a special name, but I highly encourage it. It's far more fun.

Anyway, [[Pathfinder Jeb]] should be able to get you everything you need.

I've yet to need a single thing that he hasn't brought along with him. He's incredible!

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
*{{Abilities|Questline: Cataloging|Completing this entire questline will unlock access to cataloging activities within the Dragon Isles.|id=392095|icon=inv_misc_selfiecamera_01}}

You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh, your new camera is beautiful. It matches you perfectly!

==Notes==
