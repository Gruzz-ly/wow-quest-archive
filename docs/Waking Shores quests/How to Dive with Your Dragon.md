==Objectives==
Dive then glide through the rings and land in the target area.
*Hop on a Dragonriding Mount
*Glide Through The Rings (5)
*Land in the Target Area
*[[Bronze Timepiece]] (provided)

==Description==
Gliding will get you to where you want to go. But what if you want to get there faster?

Diving after jumping from somewhere high will give you a speed boost.

Fly through the rings to the target location

If you find yourself stuck, use the Bronze Timepiece and [[Celormu]] will reset you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Well done, <name>.

==Completion==
See? That was much better.

If you start your flights with a dive you will get to where you want to go so much faster.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Lord Andestrasz|As you aim for the ground, you'll pick up speed. Use this to fly faster, then level out to reach your destination.}}

Mount up, and this time note the arrow pointing down to the rings. Dive through the rings to pick up speed, then level off and land at the same spot. As before, [[Celormu]] will teleport himself and the player back up to Andestrasz.

==Progression==
{{In Defense of Life}}
