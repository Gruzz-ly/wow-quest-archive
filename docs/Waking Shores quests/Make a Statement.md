==Objectives==
Plant a [[black dragon]] [[banner]] into the corpses of 12 djaradin.
*Banners planted in [[Djaradin]] Corpses (12)
*[[Flag of the Black Dragonflight]] (provided)

==Description==
These djaradin believe the [[black dragonflight]] is finished. They don't fear or respect [[Wrathion]]'s authority here.

We need a statement to remind them that the obsidian flight has returned, and that we are stronger than ever.

Slay the djaradin and mark each corpse so they don't forget who rules here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +2500 [[reputation]] with [[Wrathion (faction)|Wrathion]]
* +150 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

You will also receive
*[[Equipment]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supplies]]

==Progress==
Have you planted those banners into djaradin corpses?

==Completion==
Masterfully done, <name>. That's how you send a message.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
