==Objectives==
Give [[Veritistrasz]] the Diary.
*[[Partially Destroyed Diary]]

==Description==
You found a partially destroyed diary. It appears to be written from the view point of a young [[black dragon]] woman, before the corruption.

While the back part of it is illegible, skimming through the first part, a name stands out to you. Veritistrasz.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 7,600 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*The "Veritistrasz" criterion of [[All Sides of the Story]]

==Progress==
Hello young one, nice to see you again.

==Completion==
Oh? What's this? A Diary? I wonder what's in it.

==Notes==
To start the quest, loot [[Partially Destroyed Diary]] from the [[Odd Book]] at {{Co|23.54|60.01|Waking Shores}} on the bookshelf in the left chamber of the [[Obsidian Citadel]], which can be entered at {{Co|27|61|Waking Shores}} of the [[Waking Shores]]
