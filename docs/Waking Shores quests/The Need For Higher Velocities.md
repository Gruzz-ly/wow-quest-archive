Fly through the rings and land in the target area.
*Hop on a Dragonriding Mount (Optional)
*Pass Through The Rings (8)
*Land in the Target Area
*[[Bronze Timepiece]] (provided)

==Description==
Sometimes you'll need to travel longer distances.

If you don't need to travel up and over any obstacles using Surge Forward is the easiest way to maintain a good forward speed to prevent yourself from plummeting out of the sky.

Follow the rings again to your destination and use Surge Forward when prompted to maintain your speed.

If you find yourself stuck, use the Bronze Timepiece and [[Celormu]] will reset you.

You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

Well done, <name>.

==Completion==
Well done. The rest is now a matter of practice.
