==Objectives==
Follow Sendrax to the [[Dragonheart Outpost]].
*Ask [[Sendrax]] to lead you to the outpost
*Follow Sendrax to the outpost
*Speak with [[Commander Lethanak]] at Dragonheart Outpost.

==Description==
I've only read of the [[djaradin]] in books.

Ancient rivals to the [[dragon]]s, powerful [[giant]]s with mastery over earth and lava... dedicated wholly to hunting dragons to extinction.

<Sendrax furrows her brow at the distant volcano.>

My instructor said that they hadn't been seen since the dragons left as they slumbered deep in the earth.

If they've awoken, every whelpling on the [[Dragon Isles|isles]] is in danger!

Follow me, I'll take us to Commander Lethanak at the Dragonheart Outpost.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Our ancient enemies have risen from their slumber... and wasted no time.

==Completion==
I will take what reinforcements I can get.

We must act swiftly.

== Trivia ==
Dragonheart Outpost might be a nod to Lord Uthari Dragonheart, the Holy [[Paladin]] character of a player on the Hellscream EU server during [[World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King|Wrath of the Lich King]], who sadly passed away some time during the release of [[World of Warcraft: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]. He was known on the server as being very Roleplay focused, yet played on a Non-RP realm, and often roleplayed as being half human, half dragon.
