==Objectives==
[[File:Whimpering Whelpling.jpg|thumb|Whimpering Whelpling]]
Save 4 Whimpering Whelplings from [[Dragonheart Outpost]].
*[[Whimpering Whelpling]]s saved (4)

==Description==
They descended upon us before we could even respond. My guards held as long as they could as we evacuated the young and helpless, but I fear that there are more within the outpost.

Cross that bridge and search for survivors.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
We will take back the town as soon as we can muster the forces... but for now, the lives of our people must be our priority.

==Completion==
We cannot rest yet, but I breathe easier knowing we have rescued them. Thank you.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
