==Objectives==
Kill 15 Primalist invaders.
*[[Primalist]] forces slain (15)

==Description==
[[Commander Lethanak]] warned us recruits that he had received reports of the Storm-Eater, [[Raszageth]], escaping her prison. It seems her servants have followed in her wake, threatening all we hold dear.

They move quickly. These ruins were reported to be abandoned during the last patrol.

We must stop the Primalists here.

For the [[Alexstrasza|Life-Binder]], and for all of the [[dragonflight]]s!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Primalist Pendant]]
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
The dragonflights will prevail against the Primalists.

==Completion==
<[[Sendrax]] pats out a lingering flame on her armor.>

We've done what we could. What was needed.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
:{{Text|say|Sendrax|If even a single dragon egg is in danger, we cannot remain in the shadows.}}

Sendrax joins the player character as a guardian, with the Sendrax's Stand buff.

Before leaving, interact with [[On the Origin of Draconic Species]] to start [[Library of Alexstrasza]].
