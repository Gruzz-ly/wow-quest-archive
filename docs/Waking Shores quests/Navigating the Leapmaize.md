==Objectives==
Collect 15 stalks of Wild Leapmaize.
*[[Wild Leapmaize]] (15)
*Return to [[Rumiastrasza]] at The [[Ruby Feast]] in [[Valdrakken]].

==Description==
There's a dragon chef in Valdrakken? Truly? I'll have to ask her to try my arclight bisque! It's an old family recipe.

I know the plant you speak of. It grows around streams here, but it's caused some problems.

The stalks of leapmaize seem to be a natural feeding ground for [[beetle]]s and small [[Salamanther|salamanthars]]{{sic}}, which are, in turn, natural prey of the [[hornswog]]s. That's fine if you can spot them out in the open, but there's a few here that are incredibly stealthy.

I'd watch my back if I were you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I met [[Chef Morsel|Morsel]] while he was roasting an enormous hornswog over an open pit of coals. The mangy leaper had followed him from [[Hornswog Hollow|the Hollows]] all the way to the [[Ruby Life Pools|Life Pools]] before he and a few guards worked together to defeat it.

Of course, he shared the scrumptious meal with all of them in return!

==Completion==
I tell you, <name>, the flavors produced by this leapmaize are truly revolutionary! Morsel says it has something to do with the active lava throughout [[Waking Shores|the Shores]] and the unique soils it creates.

I have found it best to believe in him in most all matters, culinary and beyond.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Meliane Enorath|The secret to my family's bisque is gummy wyrms, but I won't tell you how many!}}

Interacting with a [[Wild Leapmaize]] summons a [[Leapmaize Ambusher]].

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|[[Chef Sungshin Ironpaw]]|Oh, my! What a wonderful texture! The consistency is just right. I would love to plate this with some [[Braised Turtle|braised turtle]] and [[Stuffed Lushrooms|stuffed lushrooms]]! Maybe a cup of my banana-infused rum too!}}
:{{Text|say|Rumiastrasza|Amazing what a little [[titan]] magic in the water supply and a few active volcanoes can do for local flora and fauna!}}

==Progression==
