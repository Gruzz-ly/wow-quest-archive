Collect Primal Flame Fragments from [[Primalist]] Forces in [[Hornswog Hollow]].
*[[Primal Flame Fragment]] (8) (Optional)
*[[Orb of Primal Flames]]

==Description==
[[Elemental]] orbs, eh? If there's earth, there's bound to be fire!

The primalists over near tae [[hornswog]] nests are reshapin' tae land with lava. If anyone has an interest in tae Orb o' Primal Flames, it'd be them!

Take them out and see if they have anythin' useful!

You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 7,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
[[Acadia Chistlestone|Acadia]] had a lead on the Orb of Primal Flames. Have you found it?

==Completion==
Ah, the Orb of Primal Flames. It is as vibrant and fiery as Acadia. I will hold onto it for now.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Acadia Chistlestone|Don't be daft, Tae'shara. Fire is more powerful than air. It consumes it!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher]]|And yet without air, what would fire be? We are not working in a vacuum, Acadia.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Elementalist Taiyang]]|Your hypotheses have merit, but I think we will find the answer lies in combining our efforts.}}

Loot [[Primal Flame Fragment]] from [[Primalist Magmashaper]]s, [[Destructive Flames]], and [[Ashen Spark]]s, and combine 8 to make the [[Orb of Primal Flames]].
