# Waking Shores storyline

[[File:VZ-Waking Shores.jpg|thumb|Waking Shores zone map]]
The '''[[Waking Shores]] storyline''' begins the [[Dragonflight campaign]] proper, taking place at the ancestral home of the [[Red dragonflight|red]] and [[Black dragonflight|black dragonflights]]. A wild, untamed land rife with elemental magic, the Waking Shores are the first zone that players see when they arrive to the Isles with a joint [[Explorers' League]]–[[Reliquary]] expedition. In the zone there are [[gorloc]]s and [[troll]]s.

The zone storyline sees [[Alexstrasza]] summoning the [[Alliance]] and [[Horde]] to aid the red flight against the native [[Djaradin]], while [[Wrathion]] seeks to reclaim the Obsidian Citadel of the black flight from enemy hands and come to terms with the state of his ruined flight.

==Intro experience==
The Dragonflight intro experience was activated with [[patch 10.0.2]] two weeks before the launch of the expansion proper. In addition, the pre-patch time-limited event [[Tempest Unleashed]] also took place.
