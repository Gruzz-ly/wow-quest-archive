==Description==
And what is the most fun about [[dragonriding]]? Races!

My bronze colleagues have mapped out race courses all over the [[Dragon Isles]]. It is such a varied and dynamic landscape that it just begs to be explored at top speed.

If you find yourself near one of our race courses in The Waking Shores, why not give it a go?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 11,350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well done! You are getting a handle on [[dragon]] racing just as quickly as I thought you would.

And that was just the beginning. Next up is the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]]!
