==Objectives==
Kill 5 Rampaging Water and 5 Rampaging Wind.
*[[Rampaging Water]] slain (5)
*[[Rampaging Wind]] slain (5)

==Description==
I believe we are gathering enough data safely from here but...

[[Ecologist Tharu|Tharu]] is an exceptional ecologist and prefers we take action. Still, the ecosystem is fragile, and we may damage it if we are not careful. I do however agree we don't have much time.

it might be worth indulging him. A little.

Culling the rampaging [[elemental]]s ought to buy us time without impeding our research. Be sure to cull them in equal numbers--we don't want to throw things further out of balance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|97|48}}
*7,250 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

|Field Scout's Breeches
}}

==Progress==
Is it done? Can I finally get Tharu off my back about this?

==Completion==
Did that seem to affect anything? No?

<[[Ecologist Iskha]] sighs.>

Well, at least we're nearly finished with our research.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Iskha|And try not to touch anything! All I need is a contaminated workspace... and compromised data!}}

;Upon return
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Tharu|I'm making an incision next to the left dorsal spine, and if you don't like it--}}
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Iskha|You're risking dorsal spine avulsion! Ugh, why won't you just listen to me?}}
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Tharu|Oh, <name>. Didn't see you'd returned.}}
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Iskha|Tharu and I can discuss this later.}}

;Description
The [[Restless Wetlands|wetlands]] are indeed in disarray, but this ecosystem is fragile, and we may damage it further in our haste. My dear [[Ecologist Tharu|Tharu]] is an exceptional ecologist, but he prefers taking action. I think there's more going on here that we need to understand, first. Still, it might be worth indulging him. A little. Culling the rampaging [[elemental]]s ought to buy us time without impeding our research. Be sure to cull them in equal numbers-- we don't want to throw things further out of balance.
