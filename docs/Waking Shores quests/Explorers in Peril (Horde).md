==Objectives==
Rescue 3 [[Dragonscale Expedition]] members in the [[Wild Coast]].
*[[Pathfinder Poppy]] rescued
*[[Archivist Spearblossom]] rescued
*[[Spelunker Lazee]] rescued
*Meet [[Naleidea Rivergleam|Naleidea]] in [[Wingrest Embassy]].

==Description==
Don't mistake the expedition's scholarly pursuits as timidness, <name>.

We are not recluses studying books in far-off towers.

We are [[adventurer]]s, hunting down knowledge first-hand in every corner of [[Azeroth]]!

That passion for adventure often leads us onto the path of perils and hazards, and a few expedition members have bitten off a little more than they could chew...

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
*{{Abilities|Dragonscale Expedition Renown|id=395181|icon=ui_majorfaction_expedition}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]
*[[Large Green Bag]]

==Progress==
Are the [[Dragonscale Expedition|expedition members]] safe?

==Completion==
The [[dragon]]s are not here to meet us as [[Ebyssian]] said they would be...
