==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Dragon Glyph.jpg|Dragon Glyph|Found around the Dragon Isles, these glyphs will help you learn more tricks and abilities for dragonriding.}}
Collect the [[Dragon Glyph]] at the [[Skytop Observatory]], then speak to Lithragosa to use your talent.
*Collect the Dragon Glyph by the [[Rostrum of Transformation]]
*Speak to [[Lithragosa]]
*View the [[Skyriding Skill Track|Dragonriding Skill Track]] with Lithragosa
*Learn the '[[Take to the Skies (dragonriding)]]' Skill with Lithragosa
*Speak to [[Celormu]]

==Description==
Obviously, it is not just [[Glensera]] and myself that are invested in these [[adventurer]]s. Lithragosa is also excited to help you hone your dragonriding skills, and you have already met Celormu which is excellent.

Also, there are Dragon Glyphs all around the Dragon Isles, which you should keep an eye out for and collect as you see them.

Your next stop is to speak to Lithragosa, who can show you what skills you can learn!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Have you found the dragon glyph?

==Completion==
As you can see, those of us from the different flights have all come together to aid our drakes and yourself. We are all ready for adventure!

Of course, we have not yet convinced... or found... a member of the [[black dragonflight]] to join us. But some day they may!

==Notes==
