Find [[Pathfinder Yips|Pathfinder Yip]]'s plane.

==Description==
<[[Pathfinder Jeb]] looks at the mountain ridge beyond the camp and sniffs.>

I don't like it. Pathfinder Yips should've been here days ago. Was gonna help me teach this new batch of explorers how to climb these pillars safely.

Now I see smoke in the distance.

I don't like it at all.
