==Objectives==
Kill 12 gorlocs in [[Cliffdrip Camp]].
*[[Gorloc]]s slain (12)

==Description==
The [[crab]]s are in danger!

This particular bunch has been through a rough season. Their previous habitat was ransacked by the [[Primalists]], and then I led them to this area only for [[gorloc]]s to invade!

I thought they would be safe here, but the gorlocs only nurture aggression in their crabs, leading them to an early demise!

Please, defeat some of the gorlocs so the crabs can escape!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
These crabs deserve better than to serve a gorloc!

==Completion==
Aspect's grace shine down on you, <name>! You saved my precious crabs! I will watch them more closely this time. No gorloc will overtake my charges again!

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|[[Ru'kroszk]]|Hold still, Kad'irsza! If you are going to be foolish enough to rush into a gorloc camp, at least allow me to mend your wounds!}}
:{{Text|say|Crabtender Kad'irsza|I had to rescue the crabs, Ru! It is my fault they are in danger!}}

Kill [[Cliffdrip Snapstrider]]s, [[Cliffdrip Wavemender]]s, and [[Cliffdrip Fallstriker]]s.
