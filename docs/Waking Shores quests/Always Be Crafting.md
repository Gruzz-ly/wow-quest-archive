Have ye ever seen such powerful [[elemental]]s?!

<[[Grun Ashbeard|Grun]] cheers.>

I hear the guards grumblin' 'bout havin' to fight 'em all the time, but they're missin' the big picture... Bigger elementals means bigger craftin' components!

While you're out there clearin' the elementals for our safety or whate'er it is ye be doin', be sure to pick up pieces of the biggest ones ye can find. I want tae try makin' somethin' out of 'em!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

Incredible! This is the best day of me life!
