==Objectives==
Speak with [[Mother Elion]].

==Description==
I understand your concern, <class>, but all will be rectified shortly as it seems that we are about to have company.

Feel free to stay and witness what transpires. It should be quite cathartic.

Do speak with our egg tender when you have a moment, though. She will no doubt need the support.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
Can you believe it?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Alexstrasza the Life-Binder]]|What is the meaning of this, Sabellian? Where are the eggs?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Wrathion]]|Yes, why don't you explain how your ridiculous plan destroyed the future of an entire flight?}}
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|I apologize for any misunderstandings, Life-Binder. But any report of our extinction is premature.}}
:''Sabellian's dragon followers, including [[Broodmother Dracasia]], appear all around them, with dragon eggs in their claws.''
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|The eggs were never in danger. The cart, and my presence, were merely to draw the attention of our foes and allow my clutch to move unobserved.}}
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|I have spent millennia rebuilding my flight. As [[Neltharion]]'s heir I pledge it, and myself, to you.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|What are you--}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|These eggs are most welcome here, Sabellian. But your part in your father's twisted legacy has earned you no such privilege.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I will ensure the eggs are cared for, but I will not be involved in your bickering. That is for the [[Black dragonflight|black]], not the [[Red dragonflight|red]], to decide.}}
