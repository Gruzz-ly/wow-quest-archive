'''New Dragonscale Equipment''' is available at Renown level 12 with the [[Dragonscale Expedition]]. This quest exists to direct you to [[Pathfinder Jeb]], who can sell you [[Relic Handler's Gloves]], [[Relic Handler's Gloves (leather)]], [[Relic Handler's Grips]], or [[Relic Handler's Gauntlets]].

==Completion==
The [[Dragonscale Expedition]] has access to some of the best artisans in [[Azeroth]]. They've created excellent equipment to help with exploration. Why, we just received a shipment of fine gloves. Take a look at my wares to see if they're something you want to trade for.
