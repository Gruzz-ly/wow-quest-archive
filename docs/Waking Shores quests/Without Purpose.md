*Talk to [[Aster Cloudgaze|Aster]]
*Conspicuous Note
*Find Talon Ethrethi

==Description==
Could I have a moment of your time?

I'm worried about another [[dracthyr]] that passed through here. He asked my associates and me all kinds of questions, but seemed... disappointed with our answers.

He called himself "Talon Ethrethi". I believe that makes him quite junior amongst your ranks?

I got the sense that he could use a hand. Mind helping me keep the peace?

I saw him talking with Kholmar over there.

You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}

==Progress==
Any news on this Ethrethi fellow?

==Completion==
You've raised the spirits of not just Talon Ethrethi, but the entire camp! It's not every day someone finds a new lease on life...

==Notes==
;Kholmar Sunrunner
{{gossip|<Ask about Talon Ethrethi.>}}
:Ah, ye mean that whirlwind of questions? Aye, he spent some time lookin' over me shoulder. Fretting the whole time, too!

:I let him give the ol' hammer a go... broke the shaft clean in two! That seemed to upset him. He asked if I had any spare nails, then disappeared. I didn't even get the chance to tell him how good of an arm he had!

:I think he chewed Toninaar's ear a bit as well.

:{{gossip|I'll go talk to Toninaar.}}
:{{Text|say|Kholmar Sunrunner|The build on that one... he'd make a fine smith!}}

;Toninaar
{{gossip|<Ask about Talon Ethrethi.>}}
:Ah, Talon Ethrethi! A keen eye, if ever I've seen one... but a heavy gaze. I asked him if he'd ever skinned a beast before, and he replied that he was only trained to kill, not to create.

:And what a shame it is! Fingers like quicksilver, that one had. I gave him the knife for a moment and he'd cleaned a foot of vellum before I could so much as blink! He tore a corner in his haste, and that seemed to dampen his mood.

:He asked to borrow a scrap of parchment, to which I obliged, then stalked off in the direction of Aster on the far side of camp...

:{{gossip|I'll go talk to Aster.}}
:{{Text|say|Toninaar|That dracthyr was apprentice material, if only he listened!}}

;Aster Cloudgaze
{{gossip|<Ask about Talon Ethrethi.>}}
:You must be referring to the absolutely miserable dracthyr who came through here earlier today. It has been a long time since I have seen such a dejected soul, and I'm from [[Goldenmist Village|Goldenmist]]!

:More's the pity. He took an interest in my scribing. I do him injustice... he took more than an interest. The mind on that one! Quick as a ranger's bowstring.

:In his melancholy he accidentally snapped a quill. That seemed to nearly end him! He asked for another, then ran off in the direction of the breached wall over yonder.

:{{gossip|I'll go search the ruins.}}
:{{Text|say|Aster Cloudgaze|He had aptitude and potential... he just wouldn't slow down!}}

;[[Conspicuous Note (Waking Shores)|Conspicuous Note]]
:My suspicions are confirmed.

:These claws were meant to spill my enemy's blood, not fashion tools or beautiful things.

:They trained us to fight hard and die well.

:And that is what I intend to do.

:For the creche,

:Ethrethi

;Talon Ethrethi
:My creche's honor dictates that I fall honorably in battle.

:So fall I shall.

:{{gossip|<Tell Ethrethi about the crafters' praise.>}}
:{{text|say|Talon Ethrethi|They... they said all those things? That I have... potential?}}
:{{text|say|Talon Ethrethi|Perhaps I can honor my creche another way.}}
:{{text|say|Talon Ethrethi|I'm not as injured as I feared, <name>. Only my pride. I can make it to the embassy from here.}}

;On quest completion
:{{text|say|Kholmar Sunrunner|Yer doin' a great job, lad!}}
:{{text|say|Talon Ethrethi|Like my scalecommander always said, "Time and dedication forge the sharpest steel!"}}
:{{text|say|Kholmar Sunrunner|And right they were!}}
