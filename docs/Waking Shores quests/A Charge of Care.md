'''A Charge of Care''' concludes the [[Waking Shores storyline]]. The greater [[Dragonflight campaign]] continues with the [[Ohn'ahran Plains storyline]] in [[Next Steppes]].

==Objectives==
Witness the [[Black dragon|Black Dragon]] Eggs rejoin the [[Life Pools]].
*[[Ruby Oathstone]] empowered

==Description==
You have my thanks, <class>, and my condolences for having to deal with [[Wrathion|those]] [[Sabellian|two]] for as long as you did.

The [[red dragonflight]] is charged with the preservation and nurturing of all [[dragon]]s, even those we may tire of at times.

With the return of the [[Black dragonflight|Black Dragonflight]]'s eggs, [[dragonkin]]d is united as it has not been in thousands of years. I believe this is what will restore our ruby oathstone.

Speak with me when you are ready to bring the eggs to the [[Obsidian Lifepool]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Expedition Researcher's Hood
|Expedition Mercenary's Helm
|Field Scout's Helmet
|Expedition Guard's Helm
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
The Life Pools are filled once more, in no small part thanks to you.

With our purpose fulfilled, our oathstone shines once more as a symbol of our calling.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Alexstrasza
:Shall we begin, <name>?

:{{Gossip|quest=|I am ready.}}

A cutscene plays out:
{{#ev:youtube|EVAbBKydXUc}}
:''A cart with eggs is present, and Alexstrasza's speech is observed by Wrathion and Sabellian.''
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|At long last, our absent young are once more among us so that they can be raised together with [[Dragonflight|all the flights]].}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Though these Life Pools were once bereft of eggs, they now contain our future.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Truly, the calling of my flight has been fulfilled.}}
:''Mother Elion approaches the cart.''
:{{Text|say|Mother Elion|I will see that these eggs are protected and loved.}}
:{{Text|say|Mother Elion|So that they may hatch into dragons, strong and wise.}}
:''Elion takes one of the eggs and places it into the pool. Energy surges from all the pools with eggs to the oathstone, revitalizing it.''

Turning in the quest also awards the "Purpose Restored" criterion of [[Waking Hope]] and completes the achievement.
