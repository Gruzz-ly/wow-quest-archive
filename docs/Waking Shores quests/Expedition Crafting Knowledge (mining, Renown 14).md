So you're here to [[Mining|mine]] the new frontier, eh? Well, you'll definitely have that opportunity here on the expedition. Got an old miner's almanac here for you if you want to study up on your skills. Swing your pickaxe a few times and get a feel for it then come back to me. I'm sure there are more books and notes around that'll help you out.
