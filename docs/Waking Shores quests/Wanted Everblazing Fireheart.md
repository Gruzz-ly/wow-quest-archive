Find the Everblazing Fireheart.
*[[Everblazing Fireheart]]
*Return to [[Cataloger Jakes]] in the [[Dragonscale Basecamp]].

==Description==
<The posted sign is written in beautiful calligraphy.>

The archivists humbly request that all [[Dragonscale Expedition|expedition members]] seek out the Everblazing Fireheart for our artifact archives.

If acquired, please deliver to Cataloger Jakes for processing and compensation.

Some expedition members have reported seeing a massive [[fire elemental]] under control of the [[Primalists]] in the north that may provide an opportunity to acquire one.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with the [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

You may also receive:
*{{Cost|300|63}}
*[[Equipment]]
*[[Primal Chaos]]

==Progress==
Do you have something for the archives?

==Completion==
The Primalists sure do love their elements, huh?

I'll ensure this is properly documented, researched, and archived for the expedition.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
