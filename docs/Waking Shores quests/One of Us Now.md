==Completion==
You're just the type of [[adventurer]] we want in our expedition, and we're so glad to have you! To show our appreciation, I'd like to reward you with our [[tabard]]. It'll show the world everything you've accomplished! We can't forget our roots, though--if you'd like a [[banner]] for the [[Reliquary]] or the [[Explorer's League]], I have those available as well. Thank you for everything you've done!
