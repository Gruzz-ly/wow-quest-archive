==Objectives==
Review the plans with the various members of [[Wrathion]]'s forces.
*[[Fao the Relentless]] consulted
*[[Archivist Edress]] consulted
*[[Talonstalker Kavia]] consulted
*[[Forgemaster Bazentus]] consulted
*Report your findings to Wrathion at the [[Obsidian Bulwark]].

==Description==
Attacking the [[djaradin]] controlling the [[Obsidian Citadel]] will be no easy task. Even with Wrathion and his [[Blacktalon]] forces, this will be a fierce battle. Wrathion may be confident, but... I am not so certain.

Perhaps we can speak to those helping to plan the strategy, and see if we can find any room for improvement.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Can you improve our odds of success?

==Completion==
I see. I shall consider your evaluation carefully, of course.

==Notes==
;Emberthal joining
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I believe I could be of some help to you. Let us review Wrathion's preparations for the assault.}}

;Speaking with Fao
:{{Gossip|Might we review the battle plans?}}
::My best strategists have created a plan that should have a high probability of success, with sufficient forces. 

::But please, review our plan. Your opinion is highly valued, champion.

Click on the [[Blacktalon Battle Plans]] to review them.
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Fao is right--the plan is sound. But I fear we lack the forces to execute it successfully.}}

;Approaching Edress
:{{Text|say|Archivist Edress|It is an honor to be in the presence of such an esteemed ally of the Black Prince.}}
:{{Gossip|What has your research found?}}
:{{Text|say|Archivist Edress|The walls of the Obsidian Citadel have stood strong for thousands of years.}}
:{{Text|say|Archivist Edress|With that kind of strength, there is no way the djaradin could have attacked it head on.}}
:{{Text|say|Archivist Edress|I suspect the djaradin have instead used their [[elemental]] [[magic]] to crack the earth beneath the Citadel, entering from within [[Neltharus]], the Obsidian fortress.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|If the walls of the citadel are built to withstand the djaradin, they'll surely prove a challenge for us as well. This will only aid the djaradin defending there.}}

;Approaching Kavia
:{{Text|say|Talonstalker Kavia|I heard rumors you were here.}}
:{{Gossip|What have you observed?}}
:{{Text|say|Talonstalker Kavia|It is best you see the size of their defensive force for yourself.}}

Click on the [[Scouting Scope]] triggers a cutscene.

:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|So many... we do not have the forces to break through those defenses!}}

;Speaking with Bazentus
:{{Gossip|Tell me about the weapons in the Citadel.}}
::The Earth-Warder's Forge created Obsidian Seared armor and weapons. A dragonkin equipped with such was a fair match for a hundred mortal soldiers.

::We must reignite the flames of the forge so we can use its power again.

::{{Gossip|Thank you for the information.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Some of those crafted weapons have surely fallen into djaradin hands. They can be used against us!}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|I value your judgment <name>. You are correct--our forces are few in number.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|But you forget... we also have myself. I am an incalculable advantage, and I will not be denied my legacy.}}
