==Objectives==
Slay the experimenting [[primalist]] in the [[Wild Preserve]].
*[[Trakhan]] slain

==Description==
Judging by what the [[child]]ren have said, we might have a primalist prowling the Wild Preserve.

This calls for immediate investigation.

According to what other researchers have observed, Primalists like to steal eggs and whelps to infuse them with power and corrupt them. Those that don't acclimate to the process suffer a slow death... not that the primalists seem to care...

We need them out of the Preserve. Attend to that, and I will try to distract the children. They must not know of this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +400 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Keep your voice down! Have you done what I asked?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>! I'm certain that was... unpleasant.

I'm sure you would prefer to limit your tasks to exploring and researching, but, unfortunately, we sometimes have to get our hands dirty protecting wildlife from those who endanger it.

==Notes==
