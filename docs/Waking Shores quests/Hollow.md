==Progress==
I know I owe you more than a drink, but I hope this will do for now.

==Completion==
It's time to go, I guess.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|<Name>. I still owe you that drink.}}

;Speaking with [[Vakaron]]
:{{Gossip|Kolgar wants to buy another round of drinks.}}
:The quiet one in the corner, right? I saw you talking to him. That's the first time I've heard him speak in days.

:I'll get him another ale. What are you having?

:No charge for either of you. I'm glad to see he has some company.

:{{Gossip|Ale.}}
:{{Gossip|A glass of wine.}}
:{{Gossip|A mug of tea.}}
:{{Gossip|Something fruity!}}

:{{Text|say|Vakaron|Here are your drinks.}}
:{{Text|say|Vakaron|There's much more to see here than just the inside of this inn. Make sure he knows that.}}

Click on [[Kol'gar's Tankard]].
:{{Text|emote|Kolgar nods to you when you set the tankard down in front of him.}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|You know, [[Duroz Scaletaker|Duroz]] didn't want me to come. He was afraid he'd be holding me here. Captive.--Sorry, can you grab my pack over there?}}

;Pack picked
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|Dying here wasn't peace for him. He knew what he was doing. Always knew how to hurt himself worse than anyone else could.}}

;Speaking with Kolgar
:The world moves on.

:{{Gossip|<Give Kolgar his pack.>}}
:{{Text|emote|Kolgar rummages in the pack, pulls out a cloak, and puts it on while speaking.}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|I started to wonder if I should have felt the same. The [[Blackrock clan]] added our share of bones to the [[Path of Glory]]. What was the difference?--My axe is over there, too, if you could.}}

;Axe picked
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|The day he died was the first day he touched [[Ruby Whelpling|this whelp]]. I've seen an [[orc]] stare down a hundred [[vindicator]]s with less fear than that. Like he was afraid the stain inside of him would spill out.}}

;Speaking with Kolgar
:{{Gossip|<Give Kolgar his axe.>}}
:{{Text|emote|Kolgar slowly holsters the axe on his back, looking down at the sleeping whelp.}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|They'd say he died a coward but I don't know cowards who could do that. Maybe he did hold me captive in the end. I don't think I can go back anymore. One last drink, shall we?}}

Use the extra action button One Last Drink.
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|Thank you, <name>. You didn't have to help, but you did. So did the [[dragon]]s. Now, I... just want to take my friend on a very long walk.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|emote|The red whelpling nudges Kolgar's arm and looks pleadingly up at him.}}
:{{Text|emote|Kolgar sighs.}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|Come on, then. I can't stop you.}}
:''Duroz and the whelping leave the inn.''
