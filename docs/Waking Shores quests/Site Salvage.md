==Objectives==
Rescue 5 [[Beleaguered Explorer]]s in [[Life Vault Ruins]].
*Explorers rescued (5)

==Description==
I've worked with many [[elemental]]s as a [[shaman]], but I've never seen any this aggressive!

The [[Dragonscale Expedition|Expedition]] discovered a titan vault here, but a barrier protects the inner chamber. When we tried to dispel the barrier, I think we triggered some kind of security system... There were suddenly angry elementals everywhere!

Many explorers were working in the dig site when the elementals attacked. Many of them are trapped, and NONE of them are fighters.

Please go down into the dig site and help them retreat!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 7,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
I am only a consultant for the Expedition, but I care for the explorers I've met here. We can't leave any of them behind!

==Completion==
Everyone's safely within our new perimeter. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Elementalist Taiyang|I'm going down to the vault to establish a new safe perimeter. Once you've dealt with the elementals, see me at the vault!}}
:''Taiyang runs downstairs and joins [[Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher]] and [[Acadia Chistlestone]] at the vault's entrance.''

;Speaking with [[Beleaguered Explorer]]
*Don't hit me, don't! Oh! You're not an elemental... Thank goodness!

:The elementals are on a rampage! Going after us, going after our tools... I lost months of my work in one smash!

:What do I do now?
*I was just minding my own business and WHAM! There were elementals everywhere!

:It started when they tried to dispel the barrier... something's in there!
*Is it over? No. Of course it's not. It won't be until we dispel the barrier!

:Even then, there might be something worse inside.

:Oh, I should not have left my position at the college...
*Did... did you see [[Disoriented Watcher|the watcher]] roaming around? There's creatures of living rocks and stones all over the dig site... 

:I write about rocks. Sometimes I lick them to see what they are! But I don't want to be pummeled by them!
*I thought the discoveries we made here would be worth the danger...

:Now, I'm not so sure!

:{{Gossip|Go to the vault. You'll be safe there.}}
