==Objectives==
Rescue the last [[Infused Dragon Egg]].
*Meet [[Sendrax]] by the ritual site {{co|56.2|22.1|Waking Shores}}
*Pick up the Infused Dragon Egg
*Carry the egg to safety {{co|55.1|30.8|Waking Shores}}

==Description==
A whole brood of whelplings, lost...

<Sendrax straightens her back and sticks her chin up.>

There is one more location we have not checked yet. The large ritual site where that [[proto-dragon]] dropped off the eggs.

Let us charge their cruel defenses together, <name>, and save what we can.

}}

You will also receive:

* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Open Tome of the Dragon's Dedication]]

==Completion==
Is that...?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Sendrax|Follow me! We'll charge the ritual site together.}}
:''Sendrax runs to the site with her shield up.''

Find Sendrax north of the lava:
:A single egg remains. We have not failed yet.

:If we can get that egg to [[Alexstrasza]], she will know what to do. There must be a way to save the whelpling inside.

:<Sendrax grits her teeth.>

:Follow me. Together, we will rescue that last egg.

:No matter the cost.

:{{Gossip|I am ready.}}

:{{Text|say|Sendrax|Stay behind me. I will endure the conduits' flame while you grab the egg.}}
:''Sendrax runs to the location of the final egg, taking damage from the wards.''
:{{Text|yell|Sendrax|For the Life-Binder!}}
:{{Text|yell|Sendrax|Now! Grab the egg! Get it to Alexstrasza!}}

Interact with the egg:
:{{Text|yell|Sendrax|For the Flight! For... the future...}}
:''Sendrax dies.''

Players are buffed with Carrying Infused Egg, increasing run speed by 80%, but taking other actions (like combat or mounting!) will drop the egg. Head back to [[Caretaker Azkra]]:
:{{Text|say|Caretaker Azkra|Aspects! Is that a dragon egg? I will summon the majordomo at once!}}
:''Azkra shots a flare, summoning [[Majordomo Selistra]].''
:{{Text|say|Majordomo Selistra|What is the emergency, Azkra? Has the enemy--by the Life-Binder! Is that an egg?}}

Completing the quest is the "Dragons in Distress" criterion of the [[Waking Hope]] achievement. An additional side quest is also available from [[Apprentice Caretaker Zefren]], just north of the tower: [[A Two for One Deal]].
