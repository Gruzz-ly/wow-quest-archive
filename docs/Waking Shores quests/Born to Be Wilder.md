==Description==
There's a lot of information you need to know. Let's have a talk and then we can decide what's best for Lubbins.

{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=10|Polished Pet Charm
}}

Good! Now to get to work, <name>.

Before you go, take these polished pet charms. Pet trainers like to trade these for useful supplies, so keep an eye out.

==Notes==
;Speaking to Haniko
:Lubbins only needs two things: a buddy and a battle.

:Hear me out. [[Battle pet|Pets]] work better in teams, so the more pets you have to support Lubbins, the better. One of the best ways to find more pets for your team is to go out in the wild and capture them.

:{{gossip|How do I do that?}}
::To capture a new pet, you need to battle against it until it's weak enough to be captured. Then you can use your pet trap to capture it.

::Everyone wins. Lubbins gets another chance to prove his strength and a new buddy to fight alongside him.

::{{gossip|I understand.}}

==Progression==
{{Lovin' Lubbins}}
