==Objectives==
Guide a whelp to eliminate 12 Agitated Weedlings, 6 Intrusive Pupstingers, and 1 Relentless Gust.
*[[Ruby Whelpling]] chosen
*[[Agitated Weedling]] slain (12)
*[[Intrusive Pupstinger]] slain (6)
*[[Relentless Gust]] slain

==Description==
The [[dragon]]s were gone from [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]] for quite some time, <name>. To tell the truth... some of our skills have atrophied as they were passed down from generation to generation.

These whelps should be easy to teach, yet we are having some trouble wrangling them.

Say.

I have seen that even [[Majordomo Selistra]] trusts you with the most crucial tasks. Would you lend us your aid and help one of our young?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Some whelps need more encouragement than the rest. Of course, we love them all.

==Completion==
It is good to see our young flying with such joy and liberty in their hearts. Thank you for helping them achieve that.

==Notes==
;On approach
:''Amella is talking with a [[Ruby Tender]].''
:{{Text|say|Amella|What do you mean, 'the whelplings do not want to fly'? This should be second nature to them!}}

;Approaching the Ruby Whelpling
:{{Text|say|Ruby Tender|Please, [[Allistra]], you love flying!}}

Click and control her. She has three abilities:
#Burning Bark
#Speed of Flight
#Call of Life
