==Description==
Unujaak told you to come, didn't he? He was the one who helped me find Ipko when I became a hunter--or, rather, helped Ipko find me. They choose and we are chosen.

He is hurting. Everyone is hurting because of me. I know that they need me to lead, but I have been half of a leader without her. If I couldn't protect her, how can I protect all of Uktulut?

<He takes a deep breath.>

I cannot forgive myself. But I cannot let that weight keep me from putting at least one foot on the path I must walk.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I knew this would happen one day, though it does not blunt the pain.

==Completion==
Nothing will replace Ipko. But water can only fill hands cupped to receive it.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|Around us is where our ottuks are kept during training. Each would make a fine companion for the hunter who suits them.}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|My heart is still too heavy to search myself--but if you are able to bring any ottuks to me, I would meet them.}}

Dismount first before interacting with the ottuks.

;Peaceful Ottuk
:<The ottuk perks up when you approach, lifting his head and whining for attention.

:It looks like he wants you to pet him!>

:{{gossip|<Pet the ottuk.>}}

The ottuk begins following the player. Bring him to Tutaqan:
:{{text|emote|Peaceful Ottuk trots leisurely up to Tutaqan and settles down, squeaking as he yawns.}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|Oh, what a very sweet friend you are! So calm... So serene!}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|Unfortunately, he's still too young and soft-hearted. The tides of the world are rough. Let him keep to his holt a while longer.}}
:''The ottuk leaves.''

;Territorial Ottuk
:<The ottuk growls at you menacingly when you come near her.

:She doesn't seem to want you to touch her.

:Maybe you could lure her with a toy?>

Grab the nearby [[Broken Fishing Pole]] and [[Stuffed Duckling Toy]], combine them with the [[Extra Action Button]] that pops up.
:{{Abilities|Create Lure|Combine a Broken Fishing Pole and a Stuffed Duckling Toy to create an Ottuk Lure.|id=389867|icon=inv_misc_2h_draenorfishingpole_a_01|notes=2.5 sec cast}}

Return to the Territorial Ottuk and speak with her again:
:{{gossip|<Wiggle the toy in front of the ottuk.>}}

The ottuk begins following the player. Bring her to Tutaqan:
:{{text|emote|Territorial Ottuk loses interest in the toy and growls at Tutaqan, thumping her tail against the ground.}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|Little one, I have no desire to fight you. I know the village is large and you feel as though you cannot control it. But control is not the armor you think it is.}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|Just like tuskarr, some ottuks can be glory-eager. But I do not fight for the sake of fighting.}}

;Dutiful Ottuk
:<The ottuk seems preoccupied with making sure the other ottuks are eating. Maybe if they had more food, the ottuk might be willing to follow you.>

Grab the nearby [[Meaty Crab]] and return to the Dutiful Ottuk.
:{{gossip|<Offer the crab to the ottuk.>}}

The ottuk begins following the player. Bring him to Tutaqan:
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|<Name>, I'm thankful for your efforts, but I fear that--}}
:{{text|emote|Dutiful Ottuk approaches Tutaqan and lays the crab at his feet.}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|I appreciate the gift, but you did not have to give it. You could use it more than I could.}}
:{{text|emote|The ottuk nudges the offered crab forward with his nose.}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|I see. We have a word for this--a type of duty that is known, not taught. As innate to a tuskarr as breathing. That word is "qipi." We have many stories that teach its importance.}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|A fitting name, I think, if you will accept it.}}
:{{text|emote|The ottuk chirps once and presses the side of his face into Tutaqan's hand.}}

;On completion
:''The next quest starts automatically.''
:{{text|bossemote|The sound of a tuskarr hunting horn bellows from the village's center!}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|That's my horn... Why is the hunting party being called now?}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|We must go--quickly. I fear we might have stepped too far out onto thin ice.}}
:''Tutaqan runs toward the center of the village.''
:{{text|emote|Qipi glances back at his holt and then scurries after Tutaqan.}}
