'''Demolitions Access''' becomes available after reaching Renown 20 with the [[Dragonscale Expedition]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Expedition Explosives
}}

==Completion==
Some excavations require a delicate touch, and others need something a little more explosive. I think we can trust you to know when to use which. You can have this first explosive for no trade. Use it wisely, and don't prove me wrong.
