==Objectives==
Enter the [[Ruby Life Pools]] and stop the [[Primalist]] attack.
*[[Kyrakka]] slain
*[[Erkhart Stormvein]] slain

==Description==
The Primalists have torn their way into our home. We were not prepared for such an intense attack... several got through.

One of our [[drakonid]] ventured in to follow them, but he has not reported his findings. I fear the worst.

I will stand guard. No more shall breach our walls while we draw breath, but you must stop those who made it inside.

Go!

==Rewards==

|Wind Soarer's Breeches

}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|102|96}}
* 18,150 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
They will destroy our future if we cannot stop them.

==Completion==
Our home will bear the wounds of this assault for years, but we are strong. We will endure... and the eggs we saved will bring about a bright future for us all.

Thank you.

==Progression==
{{In Defense of Life}}
