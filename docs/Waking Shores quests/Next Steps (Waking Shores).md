==Description==
These stones are an incredible discovery, even if their intended use is never realized.

But before we try them out, we have a process to adhere to. They must be examined and cataloged, and reports sent and received to both the [[Reliquary]] and [[Explorers' League|Explorer's League]] headquarters.

Let's meet back at basecamp. We can go over what's next.

==Completion==
Don't ye worry. Show a little patience, and we'll get to the bottom a' this yet.
