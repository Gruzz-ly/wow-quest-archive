==Objectives==
Speak with [[Griftah]] at the [[Obsidian Throne]].

==Description==
To many, meat is essential for any true meal. But what is the essential for any true meat dish?

Spice!!

A spice that surpasses all others in terms of flavor, texture, and rarity lies within [[Dragon Isles|these Isles]]. Unfortunately, it can only be found on [[elemental]]s that dwell in the depths of the [[Obsidian Citadel|Obsidian Stronghold]]. It's an area currently occupied by the [[Djaradin]].

Perhaps you can consult with a peculiar [[Jungle troll|troll]] I met while passing through there. I believe his name was... Griftah.
