==Notes and trivia==
;Upon accept
:{{text|say|Zenata|My calculations place the confluence point next to that telescope over there.}}

Upon activating [[Observation Mode]], a ghostly [[Ruby Observer]] appears looking through the Telescope nearby:
:{{text|say|Ruby Observer|Ah, another pleasant evening of gazing into the heavens, searching for clues to our future.}}
:{{text|say|Ruby Observer|Waaaaaait a minute, what's that? Is it getting... closer?}}

A [[Thieving Dreadsquall]] flies in and takes the Telescope's lens:
:{{text|say|Ruby Observer|Gaahh! Get away you filthy pest!}}
:{{text|say|Ruby Observer|No, not the lens! Come back here!}}
:{{text|say|Ruby Observer|Oh no... what are we going to do now?}}
This quest's name is likely a reference to ''{{wp|The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past}}''.
