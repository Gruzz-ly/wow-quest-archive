==Description==
The legend says she only sings it for those who prove their devotion to life.

I've been tending this garden for years... And I think my plants and I are finally ready.

I'll start setting up by the pool here. You can help me with the harvest!

Gather seed pods from beneath bushes, dragonflowers from sunny fields, and dragonfruit high in the trees. You can borrow my old rake to help with those. And watch out--sometimes the foliage can be feisty!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 250 [[XP]]
* +100 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
<[[Akora]] talks nervously to herself.>

Just remember the mantras...

Fruit that is sweet,<br>
is harbored from heat.

Tilling early the soil,<br>
saves future toil.

If a tree should bare fruit,<br>
don't forget its roots...

==Completion==
Well... at least the [[animal]]s seemed to enjoy my work.

<Akora tries to smile but is unable to hide her disappointment.>

Maybe the legend was never real at all.

==Notes==
Looting Fragrant Dragonflowers causes [[Overzealous Bloom]]s to appear and attack. Look for Ripened Dragonfruit up on the trees and use Trusty Dragonkin Rake on them to knock them on the ground. Once you have all of them, head back and approach the [[Seed Basket]], [[Fruit Basket (Waking Shores)|Fruit Basket]], and [[Flower Basket]].
