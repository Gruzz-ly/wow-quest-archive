==Objectives==
Defeat 3 proto-dragons in the [[Flashfrost Enclave]].
*Use the Ruby Harpoon on a proto-dragon (Optional)
*[[Proto-dragon]]s slain (3)
*Meet [[Majordomo Selistra]] at Flashfrost Enclave.
*[[Ruby Spear]] (provided)

==Description==
These proto-dragons detest us. They believe we are a twisted version of [[dragonkin]]d that is manipulated and chained by the [[Titan]]s. They do not understand.

Which is why they feel safe even as they throw their forces at our walls.

They are mistaken.

Take this spear, <name>. Kill our enemies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
They intend to harm our [[dragon]]s. They deserve no mercy.

==Completion==
They may have been our kin, and perhaps we could have approached them as our brethren... but their cruelty leaves no mercy in my heart.

==Notes==
Use the quest item on [[Galestrike Proto-Dragon]]s and [[Rumbling Proto-Dragon]]s.

==Progression==
{{In Defense of Life}}
