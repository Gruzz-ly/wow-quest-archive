==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Meatgrinder Sotok.jpg|Meatgrinder Sotok|The ringleader of the Dragonheart Outpost attack.}}
Kill Meatgrinder Sotok at [[Scalecracker Keep]].
*[[Meatgrinder Sotok]] slain {{co|63.0|29.4|Waking Shores}}
*Meet [[Wrathion]] inside Scalecracker Keep.

==Description==
Ah, yes.

I saw the leader of [[Djaradin|these giants]] headed back from the raid shortly after I arrived. She's celebrating their victory somewhere within the camp.

It would be a shame if someone interrupted her revelries, don't you think?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Field Explorer's Stave
|Explorer's League Rifle
|Explorer's Short Sword
|Expedition Dissection Knife
|Explorer's Belt Knife
|Brush-Clearing Axe
|Expedition Defender's Blade
|Staff of Discovery
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|12|98|74}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Sotok seems to be the sort to hold a grudge. Might be best for everyone involved if they're out of the picture.

==Completion==
The djaradin seem to have no shortage of bodies to throw in our way... but perhaps this blow shall give them pause.

Well done, friend.

==Notes==
;Upon completion of all three
