Jebb's gossip:
{{dialogue|
<Pathfinder Jeb is closely studying a half-drawn map.>

The scouts did a good job mapping out this area before our arrival.

Lots of detail, although I'm not certain how to interpret this sad monkey face yet...

That very ominous skull up in the mountainside, on the other hand? I can guess what that means.

Jeb's Supply Pack drops from the [[Primal Lava Elemental]]s just north of the embassy.
