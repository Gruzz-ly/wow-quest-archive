==Objectives==
Participate in the Lifecalling Ceremony at the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]].
*Callings chosen (4)

==Description==
<Name>! How fortunate you are here! We are about to begin a Lifecalling Ceremony and would be honored if you assisted us.

A [[dragonspawn]]'s Calling is very special. Some become masterful gardeners; others care for particular wildlife.

These young dragonspawn have finished their training and are ready to take on their first Callings. I know they would be thrilled to have you participate. When you're ready, please present each of the items on this table to them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 3,650 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Ah, I remember my first calling like it was yesterday...

==Completion==
A Calling can change throughout a dragonspawn's life, but we each cherish our first greatly. Thank you again for participating in our ceremony.

;[[Gardener's Trusty Rake]]

:{{Text|say|Lifecaller Tzadrak|Life calls to you, Akora.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Akora]]|I accept this Calling! I promise to care for the gardens of the Life Pools as best I can.}}
:{{Text|emote|Keshki applauds vigorously and gives Akora a thumbs-up.}}

;[[Whelptender's Watering Can]]

:{{Text|say|[[Lasztak]]|Whelptender. I accept this Calling. ...But what does a watering can have to do with it?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Vaeros]]|Just as saplings must be carefully nurtured by gardeners, so too must whelps be cared for if they are to blossom into their full potential. You will learn in time.}}

;[[Shimmery Jar of Fireflies]]
:{{Text|say|Lifecaller Tzadrak|Life calls to you, Keshki.}}
