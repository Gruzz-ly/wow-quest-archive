==Description==
<It seems those who have reawakened with the Isles have not been kind to [[Tyr|Keeper Tyr's]] creations. Perhaps finding the missing pieces of the statue would help.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|27|62|}}
* 10,250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<As you approach, you can feel the warmth of the Titan's energy flowing through the statue once more.>

==Completion==
Excellent work as always. I feel that Tyr's faith in the future was not unfounded.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|My structural integrity has been compromised.}}
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|I am unable to begin the trial.}}

Speak with the Maiden:
:Stand strong.

:{{gossip|What happened?}}
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|Displaying record log number 34-1352.}}
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|I shall project the images of what occurred before my breaking. Please stand by, adventurer.}}
:''A projection of five [[djaradin]] surround the statue. One with a sword strikes at it repeatedly.''
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|Projection complete.}}
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|I sustained critical damage.}}
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|And require repairs immediately.}}

Head north into [[Scalecracker Keep]] to find the three objects:
*[[Broken Head]] for [[Broken Part: Head]] inside a building at {{co|66.3|34.9|Waking Shores}}
*[[Broken Arm]] for [[Broken Part: Arm]] guarded by a [[Qalashi Scoundrel]] at {{co|64.5|34.3|Waking Shores}}
*[[Broken Part: Shattered Orb]] from the corpse of a [[Qalashi Marauder]] at {{co|65.8|32.6|Waking Shores}}

Return to the broken statue after re-looting all three parts and interact with it to repair it:
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|My structural integrity has been restored.}}
:{{text|say|Maiden of Inspiration|Thank you, adventurer.}}

==Progression==
{{The Spark of Ingenuity}}
