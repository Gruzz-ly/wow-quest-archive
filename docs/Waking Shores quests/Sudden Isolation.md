==Objectives==
Attempt to make contact with the [[Uktulut tribe|Uktulut tuskarr]].

==Description==
We used to trade frequently with the Uktulut tribe in the [[Waking Shores]], but they haven't been sending or accepting shipments for months now. Our letters have gone unanswered. Naturally, we suspect the worst.

Their chieftain, [[Tutaqan]], has always been the reasonable sort. Somewhat prone to strong emotions, but I can't imagine anything terrible could have happened under his leadership.

Could you please check on them? If they need help, we'll happily provide.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|09}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You're checking on us? A likely story.

==Notes==
;At Uktulut Backwater
[[Guard Hakota]] and two [[Uktulut Protector]]s guard the road into the village. On approaching them:
:{{text|say|Guard Hakota|Halt, outsider!}}
:''He tosses a net at you, and you become {{Abilities|Trapped!|id=378456|icon=inv_misc_net_01}} for a few seconds.''
:{{text|say|Guard Hakota|State your purpose before we skewer you for this intrusion.}}

==Progression==
