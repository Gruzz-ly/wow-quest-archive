==Objectives==
Walk with Duroz and Kolgar to find help.
*Walk with [[Duroz Scaletaker|Duroz]] and [[Kolgar Flameguard|Kolgar]]

==Description==
Duroz is old, sick, and stubborn as a [[kodo]]. There was no stopping him getting on the airship to come here. Best I could do was come be his walking stick.

I've seen him in pain enough times on the battlefield to know when he's hiding it. He's been getting worse every day out here. Can you help me get him to the potion makers? [[Ale]]'s not doing the trick anymore.

If you can carry our weapons, I can help him walk.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 3,650 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +125 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
I wish there was more I could do.

==Completion==
<Bathoras frowns in concern as he looks over the old [[orc]].> 

I will examine him and see what I can do.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Duroz Scaletaker|...And that's what was hard to forget. Captivity. Chains. You... remember, don't you?}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|You're sounding rough, old man. Save some strength for the walk back.}}

After accept, the player has the Carrying Axes debuff.

:''The pair starts walking out of the inn.''
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|Here, carry our axes for us. It'll lighten the load in case I have to sling him over my shoulder.}}
:{{Text|say|Duroz Scaletaker|I can still walk, boy.}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|That's what you said after that [[Kor'kron]] took out both your knees at [[Orgrimmar]].}}
:{{Text|say|Duroz Scaletaker|And I meant it. Cut down six of them afterward and would've kept going if--}}
:{{Text|emote|Duroz falls silent and averts his eyes when they pass [[Sweelin|the innkeeper]].}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|You're worried they know about [[Dragonmaw clan|your clan]].}}
:{{Text|say|Duroz Scaletaker|No. They were too young. Too far away. I pray that evil never reaches them.}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|What if they learn one day?}}
:{{Text|say|Duroz Scaletaker|Some will. The others will get to live without knowing those things can happen.}}
:{{Text|say|Duroz Scaletaker|Agh--}}
:''Duroz kneels.''
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|Do you need to slow down?}}
:{{Text|say|Duroz Scaletaker|No. There is... much to be done. To be said. Better to... get on with it.}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|Stubborn bastard.}}
:''The pair approaches [[Bathoras]].''
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|Good, they're still here. Throm-ka, [[alchemist]]. My friend is sick and could use your aid. We have gold to pay you.}}
:{{Text|say|Bathoras|What is wrong? Come closer. Let me have a look at you... Our aid will be yours without coin.}}

If you want to do the quest quickly, simply go ahead to Bathoras and speak with him:
:{{Gossip|This orc needs your help urgently. <Skip current conversation.>}}
