'''Exeunt, Triumphant''' concludes the third chapter of five in the [[Waking Shores storyline]].

==Objectives==
Escape the Frostflash{{sic}} Enclave with Majordomo Selistra.
*Speak to [[Majordomo Selistra]] at the [[Wild Hatchery]]

==Description==
From what I saw, [[Alexstrasza|the queen]] fell back to the Wild Hatchery. It is an outpost to keep watch over the [[proto-drake]]s in the area... I only hope that its defenses are enough.

We must head there at once!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Renewed Proto-Drake: Subtle Horns]]
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
My queen...

==Completion==
I could not rest until the eggs were safe... this is a relief.

Thank you, <name>.
