Inspect the Etched Ancient Monolith.
*[[Etched Ancient Monolith]] investigated

==Description==
This stone behind me is just one piece of, what do ye call it--ancient technology--we stumbled upon here in the [[Dragon Isles|Isles]].

But, we're not entirely sure what they are just yet. Baffling, really.

We've sent word to some friends to see if they can help. In the meantime, perhaps ye can figure out how tae use it?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
So. Is there more to it, or is it really just a heaping hunk o' stone?

==Completion==
A what symbol!? That can't be right...

<Thaelin scratches his beard.>

There's only one way to find out.
