==Objectives==
Acquire the Worldbreaker Cell Key and free Ayasanth.
*[[Worldbreaker Cell Key|Key]] Obtained from [[Worldbreaker Guard]]s (Optional)
*[[Ayasanth]]'s [[Worldbreaker Cell|cell]] unlocked

==Description==
When we heard rumors of a [[Deathwing]] [[cult]], [[Majordomo Selistra]] ordered me to bring these erstwhile scaleborn back into the fold. We'd hoped it was a simple misunderstanding.

Clearly, we were wrong.

Their leader must be dealt with--but first I need out of this cage. Find the key and bring it to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
I must admit: this cage has gotten rather tiresome.

==Completion==
I may have suffered imprisonment--but the [[Worldbreakers]] barely spit an ember next to the [[Twilight's Hammer]]. I should be grateful for that at least.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Ayasanth|One of the guards has a key to this cell. Find them! Be swift!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Ingot]]|I'll keep watch here!}}

Key-bearers are specifically [[Worldbreaker Guard]]s, not the other units in the area.

;Returning to Ayasanth with the key
:{{Text|say|Ayasanth|Good--you have the key. Now open this cage before my legs cramp.}}

;Cage unlocked
:''Ayasanth steps out of the cage.''
:{{Text|say|Ayasanth|Finally. We must move quickly.}}
:{{Text|say|Ingot|But... you're hurt! We need to get you somewhere safe.}}
:{{Text|say|Ayasanth|Not before we put an end to this farce.}}

==Progression==
{{The Shadow of His Wings}}
