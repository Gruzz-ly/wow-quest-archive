==Objectives==
Meet [[Agapanthus]] at the [[Little Scales Daycare]] in [[Valdrakken]].

==Description==
[[Amella]] has told me about the incoming [[Dragon whelp|whelps]] and about the daycare. Did you know Agapanthus is a renowned whelptender? I heard he fought back [[demon]]s while rearing whelps!

If he's as amazing as they say, I have much to learn from him. I only just received my Calling, but I will help in any way I can.

The Little Scales Daycare is in Valdrakken. I will gather my things and meet you and Agapanthus there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|57|40}}
*1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Lasztak has just informed me of his rigorous study as a whelptender of the red flight. Most of my experience is hands-on. And you...

<Agapanthus sighs and scratches his chin.>

We will have to develop curriculum.
