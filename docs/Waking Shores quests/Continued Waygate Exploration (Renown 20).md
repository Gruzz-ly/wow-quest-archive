'''Continued Waygate Exploration''' becomes available at Renown level 20 with the [[Dragonscale Expedition]]. This is a [[breadcrumb quest]] that leads back to [[Rubyscale Outpost]], where a seventh [[Ancient Waygate]] can be unlocked.

==Objectives==
Meet [[Thaelin Darkanvil]] at the [[Rubyscale Outpost]] in The [[Waking Shores]].

==Description==
<The parchment emits an unpleasant, mold-like smell. After struggling to regain focus, it becomes clear Thaelin needs your assistance in seeking answers to newly discovered findings.

The only question that remains is what to do with this parchment of intolerable odor.>

==Completion==
Ack, ye scared me! Wasn't expectin' ye so soon.

Up fer a bit more explorin' I see.
