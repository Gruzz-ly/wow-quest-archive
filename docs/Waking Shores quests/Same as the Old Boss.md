'''Same as the Old Boss''' is a weekly series of quests unlocked after completing the [[The Shadow of His Wings]] storyline. Take out a different boss each week!

==Objectives==
Eliminate <Doventhal the Chosen/Aizir the Inflamed/Vyzos the Prophet.>
*<[[Doventhal the Chosen]]/[[Aizir the Inflamed]]/[[Vyzos the Prophet]]> slain {{co|35.1|45.0|Waking Shores}}

==Description==
The [[Worldbreakers|Worldbreaker]] [[dragonkin]] are a trusting lot. We have followed many different leaders over the years, believing that each will lead us to the [[Hour of Twilight]] and the return of [[Deathwing]].

However, Deathwing has not returned, and still there is no Twilight.

It is time for a new leader. You can help bring about the change.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 25x [[Magmote]]
* 20x [[Dragon Isles Supplies]]
* 7,150 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Are we ready for a new leader?

==Completion==
You have done well. Now there is ample room for a new leader to rise and bring the Worldbreakers to a better future.

==Notes==
Head downhill to the northeast to find the mouth of the cave at the [[Smoldering Perch]] at {{co|35.7|47.9|Waking Shores}}, then head to the back of the cave and upstairs to find the boss of the week.

On completion, the questgiver runs downhill in the direction of the cave, presumably to take the place of the still-warm now-former boss...

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
