==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Sundered Enforcer.jpg|Sundered Flame Forces|The Sundered Flame has mobilized an army of drakonid and tarasek to find [[Fangfall]].}}
Find 100 Fragments of Fangfall
*[[Fragments of Fangfall]] (100)
*Return to [[Cataloger Jakes]] in the [[Dragonscale Basecamp]].

==Description==
<The posted sign is written in beautiful calligraphy.>

The archivists humbly request that all expedition members seek out the legendary blade Fangfall for our artifact archives.

If acquired, please deliver to Cataloger Jakes for processing and compensation.

The sword was reportedly fractured long ago, but expedition members have reported that the Sundered Flame is recovering fragments of it in ruins of the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +250 [[reputation]] with the [[Valdrakken Accord]]

You may also receive:
*[[Equipment]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supplies]]

==Progress==
Do you have something for the archives?

==Completion==
Ooo, I love puzzles! I should ask the archivists if I can help with putting these back together!

I'll ensure this is properly documented, researched, and archived for the expedition.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
