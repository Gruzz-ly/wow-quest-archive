==Objectives==
Search the [[Obsidian Observatory]] for clues about the [[dracthyr]]'s past.
*First Obsidian Fragment examined
*Second Obsidian Fragment examined
*Obsidian Teleporter examined
*Final Obsidian Fragment examined

==Description==
From the air, I scouted one of the artifacts [[Archivist Edress|Edress]] uncovered by the entrance of the ruins. Doubtless there are more inside.

They are warded somehow, though I will need to get closer before I can examine them. The magic here is very old.

The grounds appear deserted, but I wouldn't trust that to last long once we start meddling. Keep an eye out. We will uncover all we can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
This has given me... much to ponder. I would prefer some time alone, if it's all the same.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|The first artifact is up ahead.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Stay alert. I dislike how quiet it is, here.}}

Upon approaching the first [[Obsidian Fragment]], a [[Fragment of Jealousy]] and [[Fragment of Despair|Fragments of Despair]] will spawn.
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|It appears to be reacting to my presence...}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Disconcerting. <Name>, handle this while I break the ward.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|The ward is broken!}}

Upon examining the artifact, a [[Fragmented Memory]] of [[Neltharion]] will appear.
:{{text|say|Fragmented Memory|This festering schism threatens to swallow us all.}}
:{{text|say|Fragmented Memory|We have done nothing but good for the world, and yet there are those who refuse to see it.}}
:{{text|say|Fragmented Memory|These usurpers, these... Incarnates, they would tear all our work to shreds...}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|That was Neltharion... could this be a fragment of his personal record?}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|We must find the other pieces.}}

Upon approaching the second Obsidian Fragment, a [[Fragment of Disloyalty]] and more [[Fragment of Despair|Fragments of Despair]] will spawn.
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|At least this time we know what to expect.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|On your guard, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Another ward taken care of.}}

Upon examining the artifact, the memory of Neltharion appears again.
:{{text|say|Fragmented Memory|The others dismiss my concerns, the Life-Binder most of all. I thought she would understand.}}
:{{text|say|Fragmented Memory|How can she entrust our future to mere talk, when the threat we face is so dire?}}
:{{text|say|Fragmented Memory|I will not be loved for it, but I must find a way to safeguard our kind.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|No! That cannot be where the trail goes cold.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|There is more to this tower... that teleporter, I wonder...}}

Take the [[Obsidian Teleporter]]:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Look, <name>. From up here, the Obsidian Citadel looks beautiful.}}

Upon approaching the last Obsidian Fragment, a [[Fragment of Cruelty]] and a [[Fragment of Insanity]] will spawn.
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Once more, defend me!}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|That's the last of the wards.}}

Upon examining the artifact, the memory of Neltharion appears again, and walks over to the ledge overlooking the [[Obsidian Citadel]].
:{{text|say|Fragmented Memory|A war is coming. I fear it, but I will not flinch away.}}
:{{Text|say|Fragmented Memory|The drakonids are slow, the dragonspawn fragile. But the mortal races, so young and agile, show promise...}}
:{{text|say|Fragmented Memory|We will be prepared. We must be.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|That is... the last of the records.}}

;Upon turning in the quest
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Neltharion. Is this what we were made for? To fight your war?}}
:{{text|emote|Scalecommander Emberthal sighs, gazing pensively at the Obsidian Citadel.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|If that was to be our fate, I suppose we must make peace with it, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|We will have to find our own place in this world.}}
:''Emberthal then takes off from the ledge.''
