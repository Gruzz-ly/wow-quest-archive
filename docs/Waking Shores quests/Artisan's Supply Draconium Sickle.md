==Objectives==
Deliver a Draconium Sickle to [[Haephesta]] at the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]].
*[[Draconium Sickle]]

==Description==
You look like someone with nothing to do. How's about employment?

I have a crafting order to fill for the [[Artisan's Consortium]] for a draconium sickle. Now I could easily take care of this, but as an apprentice I think it makes more sense for you to take this one on.

Craft the sickle and bring it to the Ruby Lifeshrine, a [[draenei]] named Haephesta will pay you for it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|30|50}}
*6,800 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Artisan's Consortium - Dragon Isles Branch]]

How can the Artisan's Consortium help you today?

==Completion==
A delivery! Excellent. Good doing business with you, <name>.

==Notes==
;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Haephesta|Another crafting order complete! Excellent, thank you <name>.}}
