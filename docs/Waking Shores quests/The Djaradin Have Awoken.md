'''The Djaradin Have Awoken''' concludes the first chapter of the [[Waking Shores storyline]]. Chapter two begins with [[Reporting for Duty]].

==Objectives==
Receive your orders from Majordomo Selistra.
*Orders received from [[Majordomo Selistra]]
*Meet [[Sendrax]] in [[Wingrest Embassy]].

==Description==
I wish we'd time for more pleasant introductions, but we can't all be [[Chronormu]], can we?

I am Selistra, majordomo to [[Alexstrasza]] the Life-Binder, Queen of the [[Dragon]]s.

Queen Alexstrasza asked me to convey her kindest regards and escort you to her at the [[Life Pools]].

But I'm afraid I must ask for your assistance before we go meet her.

Our ancient rivals, the [[djaradin]], have awoken from their slumber under the earth and have already assaulted a [[Dragonheart Outpost|nearby outpost]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +400 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
We must do whatever the majordomo asks of us.

==Completion==
The djaradin have awoken? This is not good, <name>...
