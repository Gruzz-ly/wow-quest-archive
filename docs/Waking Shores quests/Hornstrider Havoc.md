==Objectives==
Meet [[Dazakros]] in the [[Overflowing Rapids]].

==Description==
[[Hornstrider]]s! They've got bone-breaking beaks, fast legs for getting away from danger, and they can eat anything in [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]].

This Calling's the easiest around! It's just me and my favorite big birds spending time together. And if anything comes up, I know how to wrangle all of the Isles' [[critter]]s.

Would you mind following me to the hornstrider plateaus up north? I wouldn't mind an extra pair of hands while getting set up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 910 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I've read so many books on hornstriders, and I've wrestled the biggest baby [[thunder lizard]] you ever did see... but I don't know one thing about [[water elemental]]s!

==Notes==

;Approaching Dazakros
