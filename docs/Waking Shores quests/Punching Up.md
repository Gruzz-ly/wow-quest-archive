==Objectives==
Slay 12 Worldbreaker Dragonkin.
*Worldbreaker Dragonkin slain (12)

==Description==
Some of the other disciples are... very mean.

<[[Ingot]] rubs a fresh wound on his snout.>

It used to not be like that, but when [[Cygenoth]] came, he said "We should value strength above all else". Now everybody fights all the time.

I try to fight back, but their hides are too thick... and I'm too small.

But not you! You must fight bullies all the time. Maybe you can help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Worldbreaker's Charm]]

==Progress==
The [[Worldbreakers]] aren't all bullies. Promise!

==Completion==
Those snagglescaled clods won't be hurting anyone else! The [[Deathwing|Earth-Warder]] thanks you!

Oh. And me. I thank you too.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Ingot|The emissary needs us! We've got to help her!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Worldbreaker Escapee]]|We can't, Ingot. We barely made it out ourselves. If the Voice of Neltharion discovers we left...}}
:{{Text|say|Ingot|Well, if you don't help, I'll find somebody... Oh! There's a somebody now! Hello! A Worldbreaker needs your aid!}}

;Upon accept of both
:{{Text|say|Ingot|They locked the red dragonflight emissary in a cage down below. I'll meet you there!}}

Don't start killing until picking up and finishing [[A Cultist's Misgivings]], then picking up [[Under Lock and Key]]. Kill [[Worldbreaker Brute]]s, [[Worldbreaker Loyalist]]s, [[Worldbreaker Smith]]s, [[Worldbreaker Cultist]]s, [[Worldbreaker Shapist]]s, [[Worldbreaker Bulwark]]s, [[Liftenoth]] and [[Vyzos the Prophet]].

;Finding Ingot and Ayasanth

*Name: A Show of Force

;Description
Below us are the remnants of a [[Black dragonflight|black dragonkin brood]], corrupted by the long-deceased aspect, [[Deathwing]]. Years after his defeat, they still believe he will return, bringing about the [[Hour of Twilight]]... the end of [[Azeroth|the world]]. There is corruption amongst there, they can not be reasoned with. They need a show of force to give up their misguided beliefs.
