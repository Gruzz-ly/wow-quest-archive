Ah, you're a [[Tailoring|tailor]] you say? Good. I can't even thread a needle, but I have some patterns left by the last expedition tailor that you can practice on. Once you're ready for more, come back and I may have something else that well help you.

What happened to the last tailor? Why, it's said that at night you can still hear him... Nah, just kidding. Went home to be with his family.
