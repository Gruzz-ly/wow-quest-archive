==Completion==
<Head Chef Stacks makes a series of cooking-related sounds and gestures. His whisks whirl! His burners bluster and spit! He bangs on his frying pan with the gravity of a great gong!

The entire inn applauds his wisdom.

In watching this elaborate pantomime, you find yourself miraculously better at cooking.>

==Notes==
Despite the quest text, this does not automatically teach [[Dragon Isles Cooking]]. Speak with the head chef again:
:<Head Chef stacks greets you with a hearty clang of an oven door and some enthusiastic spatula-waving.
:Or at least, you're pretty sure it's a greeting.>
