==Objectives==
Tell Cataloger Wulferd in the nearby basecamp that his supplies won't be arriving anytime soon.
*Give [[Cataloger Wulferd]] in [[Dragonscale Basecamp]] the bad news.

==Description==
I tried to tell [[Enchanter Vevesi|Vevesi]] that I could pull the [[wagon]] out of the mud.

But, no, he insisted on using [[magic]] to get it out... And now look what's he done.

<[[Hauler Bennet]] sighs.>

While I try to talk sense into Vevesi, can you run up the hill to the Basecamp and let Cataloger Wulferd know that he might need to ship another crate of camera supplies over from [[Boralus]]?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Cataloger Wulferd laughs.>

Not a problem. I packed plenty of spare film in my carry-on.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Hauler Bennet|I'll ask again... Are you SURE I can't do anything to help?}}
:{{Text|say|Enchanter Vevesi|No, sit, rest. I have everything under control! Always!}}

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Hauler Bennet|If you'd just set it down, I could carry the supplies up the hill myself...}}
:{{Text|say|Enchanter Vevesi|Nonsense! I'll have everything back in place any second now...}}
:{{Text|say|[[Flip Quickcharge]]|No rush, friend. This suspension magic tickles!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Pristy Quickcharge]]|You're quite correct, dear brother. It is most wondrous!}}
