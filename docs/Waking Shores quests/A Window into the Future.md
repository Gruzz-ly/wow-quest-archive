==Objectives==
Search Dreadsqualls nests to recover the lens.
* Search [[Dreadsquall Nest]]s for the Lens
* [[Telescope Lens]]

==Description==
Those lenses are a wondrous integration of [[technology]] and [[arcane]] artifice. I'm sure we could learn much, and maybe even upgrade my own invention.

But first we'll need to find it. You're a dragonrider, right? Can you fly up and recover the lens?

It's possible the dreadsqualls still have it in one of their nests.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Azerothian Archives]]

==Progress==
Did you recover the lens, <name>?

==Completion==
Success!

I knew you were the right person for the job!

==Notes==
Search the nearby Dreadquall Nests. It will aggro an [[Agitated Dreadsquall]] that drops [[Dreadsquall Eggshell Fragment]]. Eventually looting a nest will yield the [[Telescope Lens]].
