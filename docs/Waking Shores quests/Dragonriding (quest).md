==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lord Andestrasz]] in the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]].
*Speak to Lord Andestrasz about [[Dragonriding]] {{co|58.4|67.1|Waking Shores}}

==Description==
One thing you may have already discovered about this place: the [[Dragon Isles]] are vast. 

Some of the [[drake]]s have an intense interest in exploring every corner and secret hiding place in this renewed land, even those places that are not readily reached from the ground. They are eager for a second set of eyes to aid them in their journey, and in trade will gladly bear a rider across the lands.

Speak with Lord Andestrasz, here in the Ruby Lifeshrine. He will explain more of what they intend.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
*{{Abilities|Dragonriding|Unlocks the ability to ride skyriding mounts, using momentum and paired abilities to traverse the skies.|id=376027|icon=ability_dragonriding_dragonridinggliding01}}
*[[Renewed Proto-Drake]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
All things come with practice.

==Completion==
Let us get started.

Do not worry, the fancy maneuvers will come later.

==Notes==
Lord Andestrasz is to the northwest near the flight master. Speak with him:
:{{Gossip|Tell me about dragonriding.}}
:{{Text|say|Lord Andestrasz|Welcome! I am glad you are ready to explore our wondrous isles.}}
:{{Text|say|Lord Andestrasz|Our drakes are excited to take to the skies of the Dragon Isles once more, and for you to provide an extra set of eyes to help them. This is dragonriding.}}
:{{Text|say|Lord Andestrasz|First you will learn how to glide with a drake and move efficiently about the peaks. Come, let us get started with some quick lessons.}}
