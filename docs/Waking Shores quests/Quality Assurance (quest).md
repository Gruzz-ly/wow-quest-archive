*[[Volcanic Geode]]s excavated (6)

==Description==
Are you looking for work, <class>?

I represent a new trade company, the Artisan's Consortium, which matches artisans and clients through our crafting orders network.

The [[Dragonscale Expedition]] placed an order for some enchanted mining tools. The tools are crafted, but we would like to test them before completing the order.

We will pay you for your services, of course.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Artisan's Consortium - Dragon Isles Branch]]

==Progress==

Do the tools work as intended?

==Completion==
Thank you for your help, <name>.

If you ever need items crafted, the Artisan's Consortium is here to provide.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Haephesta|Excuse me, <class>! Can you test something for me? The Artisan's Consortium will pay for your time.}}

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Haephesta|The Artisan's Consortium strives for high-quality service! Ensure these tools work, <name>.}}

The geodes can be found in the ruined portion of the embassy and inside the [[Quaking Cavern]]. Interacting with them will aggro the nearby neutral [[Primal Earth Elemental (Waking Shores)|Primal Earth Elementals]].

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Haephesta|I will deliver these tools at once. The Dragonscale Expedition will be quite pleased with their crafting order.}}
