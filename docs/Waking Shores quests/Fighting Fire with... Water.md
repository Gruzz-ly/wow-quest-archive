==Objectives==
Kill [[lava elemental]]s in the [[Erupting Cavern]].
*Erupting Cavern contained (0/100%)
*[[Bottled Water Elemental]] (provided)

==Description==
In all my years of tending to the lava elementals, I have never seen them act like this! We can barely keep them contained to the cave.

Do you have a minute to spare? We'll hold the exit while you thin their numbers inside.

Here, take this bottled [[water elemental]] with you.

I always carry a few spare bottled water elementals when I'm looking after the lava elementals. Natural enemies make for good distractions!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|97|48}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
Thank you for a moment's respite. A caretaker's work is never done.

==Notes==
To fill up the bar, Kill [[Erupting Droplet]]s, [[Erupting Lasher]]s, and [[Erupting Magma]].
