==Objectives==
Collect 30 Cindershard Coal.
*[[Cindershard Coal]] (30)

==Description==
The creation of new weapons and armor in the Earth-Warder's Forge will insure our eventual victory over the [[Djaradin]].

The flames of the forge though must be constantly kept fueled. Cindershard Coal will provide the strongest heat, necessary to forge weapons.

You can find Cindershard Coal from deposits and [[Elemental]]s within the [[Cindershard Seam]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 7,150 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Sabellian (faction)|Sabellian]]
* +250 reputation with [[Wrathion (faction)|Wrathion]]
* +150 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*20x [[Dragon Isles Supplies]]

==Progress==
Have you collected fresh Cindershard Coal?

==Completion==
This coal will do nicely, <name>. That should keep the forge going for a while longer.

==Patch changes==
