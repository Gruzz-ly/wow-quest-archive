==Completion==
Who woulda known that caring for juvenile skitterbugs would have consequences? Their parents, [[Skitterfly|Skitterflies]], came looking for them. Rather than wanting a fight, they nested--just like a [[gryphon]] would! I started training them and wouldn't you know it, it's close to riding a gryphon... once you get used to the buzzing wings. With all the help you're providing around here, I'd like you to have your first Skitterfly mount on me. I will gladly train you another, in exchange for some very specific items.
