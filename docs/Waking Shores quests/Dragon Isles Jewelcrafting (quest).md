==Completion==
;Misty Catseye
Hey, you. You like smooth things? Shiny things?

Look at you. Of course you do.

I can teach you how to make the smoothest, shiniest things imaginable. Just say the word. I'll make it happen.

;Falron Greygold
Are ye the new jewelcrafter I asked for?

<Falron looks you over.>

Perhaps not, but ye are a jewelcrafter. You will do.

I will teach ye how to cut the gems of the [[Dragon Isles|Dragons Isles]]{{Sic}}, since you're here.
