==Objectives==
Meet Wrathion and [[Majordomo Selistra]] at Scalecracker Keep.
*[[Wrathion]] met at [[Scalecracker Keep]]

==Description==
Cadet [[Sendrax]] has informed me of our majordomo's plans. Thank the [[Alexstrasza|Life-Binder]] that we have their help. Their interference gives us the reprieve we need to get our wounded back to the [[Life Pools]] to be treated.

I wish I could reinforce Selistra but I must keep my guards near the wounded. Go to the enemy stronghold to meet them. 

If there were another way of handling the [[djaradin]], I would ask it. But, as it were...

You must do what you must.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
It does my heart well to hear such good news from [[Dragonheart Outpost]] during such a terrible time. The [[refugee]]s will be safe at the Life Pools.

Even the djaradin would not raise arms against the might of Queen Alexstrasza herself.
