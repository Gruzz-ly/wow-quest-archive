==Objectives==
Locate the [[Obsidian Oathstone]].
*Speak with [[Wrathion]] at the Oathstone
*Oathstone examined

==Description==
When [[Neltharion]] became the Earth-Warder, he swore an oath to protect [[Azeroth|this world]], <name>. To safeguard the deep places of the earth and, with [[Black dragonflight|his flight]], to serve as Azeroth's defenders. The Obsidian Oathstone represents that promise.

We must activate the stone and let the [[Dragon Isles]] know that the black dragonflight has returned!

Follow me, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you seen the Oathstone?

==Completion==
This is a setback, but with your help, I am sure we can repair the Oathstone. Work with [[Forgemaster Bazentus|Bazentus]]... make it so.

==Notes==
Upon approach, [[Sabellian]] and his followers fly in.

;Speaking with Wrathion
:So close to completing my destiny.

:{{Gossip|Is that the Oathstone?}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|The Oathstone must be activated to restore the power of my dragonflight.}}

Interact with the oathstone to examine it.
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Something is wrong here...}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|This can not be. The stone is cracked?}}
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|Father... broke his oath... and with that the stone broke as well.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|We must repair it!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Forgemaster Bazentus]]|The Forge of the Earth-Warder is close. It is possible.}}

Upon completion, Sabellian and his brood transform back into their dragon forms.
