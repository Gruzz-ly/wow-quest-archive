*{{item|Qalashi Trophy|Qalashi trophy}} {{co|65.5|31.8|Waking Shores}}

==Description==
The chieftain is not taking visitors.

Whether [[Iskaara]] sent you or not, we're dealing with our own share of trouble right now. We don't need outsiders bringing more of it.

If you want our time, make yourself useful and help our guards. The [[djaradin]] have been attacking us from across the river. Flameshaper Lorak is behind the assault. He may not look like much as far as djaradin go, but he's got more brains than the rest of them.

Deal with him and bring back proof. Then we'll talk.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}

==Progress==
If that weapon's just for show, tell us now so we don't waste time.

==Completion==
I'll admit I didn't expect you to come back alive.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Guard Hakota|The closer the djaradin push towards us, the more the river dries up. If my guards can't keep them away, we'll run out of food soon.}}

;On return
:{{text|say|Guard Hakota|So the outsider returns. Did you give up already?}}

==Progression==
{{The Chieftain's Duty}}
