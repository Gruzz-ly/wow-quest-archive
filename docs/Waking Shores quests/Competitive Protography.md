==Objectives==
Photograph an Infused Proto-Dragon Egg and an Infused Proto-Drake.
*Photograph an [[Infused Proto-Dragon Egg]]
*Photograph an [[Infused Proto-Drake]]
*[[Wulferd's Award-Winning Camera]] (provided)

==Description==
Well, now that you've cut your teeth on some starter shots, how about we move onto something a little spicier?

I spotted a gorgeous [[proto-drake]] flying around the area behind us. Beautiful horns, scales crackling with electricity... Probably the work of the [[Primalists]], no doubt, but art is art!

See if you can get a picture of the proto-drake and some of its eggs. You might have to climb up a bit to get a good shot!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
If you get in a fight with the Primalists, make sure you keep that camera pristine! It's my only prototype!

==Completion==
Oh, look at that! The colors came through beautifully. Looks like you're a pretty good cataloger already!

==Progression==
