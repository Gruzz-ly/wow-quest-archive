==Objectives==
Gather 10 Warmwater Riverfish and 6 Succulent Snapper Meat.
*[[Warmwater Riverfish]] caught (10)
*[[Succulent Snapper Meat]] (6)
*[[Tuskarr Fishing Net (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
It saddens me to see [[Tutaqan|our chieftain]] like this, but our needs cannot wait.

The river has provided for us for generations. But as the [[djaradin]] push forward, the waters recede, and the creatures fight with each other for space and resources. 

Without guards, our anglers cannot venture far to fish. Our food stores dwindle by the day.

You do not seem to need protection though. Take this net to help gather any fish you can from the river. Meat from the nearby crabs would also be welcome.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The river was once beautiful and its bounty plentiful. I pray that its gifts will return to us one day.

==Completion==
At least our children will not go hungry while our chieftain neglects his duties. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Elder Unujaak|Anything you can bring back will help. Our people's bellies cannot wait on [[Tutaqan]].}}
:''He walks off to the village's cooking area.''

;On return
:{{text|say|Elder Unujaak|By the seas, I have not seen a haul that size in weeks!}}

;On completion
:{{text|say|Elder Unujaak|I will have this meat preserved at once. It may have to last us a long while.}}
