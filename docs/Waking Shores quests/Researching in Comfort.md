==Completion==
Many hours of expedition work is spent--how do I say this? On your behind. I do not see why we can't make that time a bit more comfortable. Therefore, I have asked our new allies in the [[Reliquary]] to fashion us a set of pillows that will do nicely. I will let you have your pick, but you will have to trade if you want more!
