==Objectives==
Speak to Tutaqan.
*Speak to [[Tutaqan]]
*[[Tuskarr Incense|Incense]] burned
*[[Fish Offering|Offering]] placed
*[[Lantern of Karkut|Lantern]] taken
*Ritual completed

==Description==
I do not know what to say. I had no idea that the chieftain's pain ran so deep.

It makes sense. [[Ottuk]]s are not pets to our people--especially not to hunters like our chieftain. They are our friends, our companions... and members of our families.

Ipko was Tutaqan's first and only ottuk. Uktulut hunters hold this bond to be sacred.

I will see that her passage to the place of our ancestors is a peaceful one.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This is all I can do.

==Completion==
<Tutaqan's jaw is set tightly, tears brimming in the corners of his eyes. He does not look at you.>

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Elder Unujaak|Come. Meet me at the shrine to [[Karkut]], the god who watches over our fallen. The chieftain will need our strength to see this through.}}

;At the shrine
[[Ipko]]'s body lays on the ground before the shrine. Tutaqan is sitting with her. As you approach:
:{{text|emote|Tutaqan does not acknowledge your presence, lost in silent prayer.}}

;Speaking to Tutaqan
:Ancestors forgive me.

:{{gossip|<Begin the ritual.>}}

:{{text|say|Tutaqan|Please assist Unujaak with the ritual. I... would like to stay with Ipko.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Unujaak|This incense is made from plants that grow near the stone ancestors. Its smoke will draw their spirits to us. Light the incense when you are ready, <name>.}}

;Incense burned
:{{text|say|Elder Unujaak|Ancestors, just as this smoke rises to the skies, embrace our fallen friend as she rises to rejoin you.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Unujaak|We will now make an offering. <Name>, take one of the fish from that basket and place it on the altar.}}

;Offering placed
:{{text|say|Elder Unujaak|Ipko led many great hunts alongside our chieftain, protecting our people from enemies and from hunger. Accept this offering, the fruits of one of her many victories.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Unujaak|Karkut hears us! Lift up the lantern, <name>, to guide him here.}}

;Lantern taken
:{{text|say|Elder Unujaak|Ipko has been one of our greatest--a hunter, a warrior, and a friend. But we remember always that oil unshared...}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|...can light only one lantern.}}
:''Ipko turns into a spirit and rises into the sky.''
:{{text|say|Elder Unujaak|Karkut has accepted her. May she stand at the ancestors' side now.}}

;On completion
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|I... need time with my thoughts.}}
:''He walks away.''

==Progression==
