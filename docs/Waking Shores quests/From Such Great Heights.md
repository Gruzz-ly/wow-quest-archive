==Objectives==
Use the Surveyor's Disc to bounce into the sky and scout the area.
*Hop on the [[Surveyor's Disc]]
*Search for Power
*Search for Allies
*Search for Danger

==Description==
[[Toddy Whiskers|Toddy]] and [[Naleidea Rivergleam|Naleidea]] have requested a survey report of the surrounding area immediately.

Luckily, I have acquired an enchanted telescope and surveyor's disc that will help us scout out nearby areas from the safety of the clouds.

Unluckily, I am deathly afraid of heights and cannot bring myself to set foot on the contraption.

You are not afraid of heights, are you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Good luck up there. I much prefer the ground under my feet.

==Completion==
<Aster breathes a sigh of relief.>

I thought for certain you would plummet to your death from up there. Thanks again for taking the risk so that I was not required to.

==Notes==

Hop on the Surveyor's Disc. It has three abilities that trigger cutscenes:

#Search for Allies
#Search for Danger

;Search for Power

;Search for Allies
{{#ev:youtube|lpklxPELlbI|urlArgs=start=66&end=78}}
