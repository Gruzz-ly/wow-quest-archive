==Objectives==
Rescue the Ruby Dragon Eggs.
*[[Ruby Dragon Egg|Infused dragon eggs]] found
*[[Infused Ruby Whelpling]] slain (9)

==Description==
There is no higher charge given to a [[drakonid]] upon their graduation than to defend every single [[dragon]] egg with their lives.

It's why we train. Why we exist.

I can no longer hide and observe, <name>. By stealing and infusing these eggs, the [[Primalists]] threaten the entire future of the [[dragonflight]]s!

We are vastly outnumbered, but will you stand by my side? Will you fight to save the dragonflights?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Such cruelty and selfishness... I cannot even fathom.

==Completion==
<[[Sendrax]] is clearly shaken by what she had to do.>

Death was the only mercy left to those poor whelplings...

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
:{{Text|say|Sendrax|If even a single dragon egg is in danger, we cannot remain in the shadows.}}

Sendrax joins the player character as a guardian, with the Sendrax's Stand buff.

Before leaving, interact with [[On the Origin of Draconic Species]] to start [[Library of Alexstrasza]].
