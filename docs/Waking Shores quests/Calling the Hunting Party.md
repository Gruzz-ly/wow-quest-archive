==Description==
<The resounding call of a hunting horn rumbles from the center of the village, calling the [[Uktulut]] hunters to attention.

You should investigate.>

==Progress==
This could be our only chance to hit them where it hurts!

==Completion==
If the chieftain doesn't take care of the job, I'll smash that djaradin to pieces myself. Mark my words.

==Notes==
[[Guard Hakota]], [[Crafter Kuliqa]], [[Elder Unujaak]], and some [[Uktulut Hunter]]s and [[Hunting Ottuk]]s are gathered in the middle of the village. Speak to Guard Hakota:
:Uktulut will not fall. If the Chieftain won't see to that, I will.

:{{gossip|What's going on?}}
:{{text|say|Guard Hakota|Hunters! The blow that <name> dealt to the [[Qalashi]] only angered them. One of the massive brutes who leads them has taken the western mouth of the river.}}
:{{text|say|Guard Hakota|It falls to us to cut him down! We have all the spears you need. Even without our chieftain, we will--}}
:''[[Tutaqan]] and [[Qipi]] approach. Tutaqan is carrying a spear.''
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|You are not without your chieftain. We will put an end to this threat today.}}
:{{text|say|Guard Hakota|Ready to fight again, eh?}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|I stand by what I said. I won't lose anyone else to the djaradin.}}
:{{text|say|Guard Hakota|Nor will I. Say the word, Chieftain, and we will stand with you.}}
:{{text|yell|Guard Hakota|For Uktulut!}}

Tutaqan's gossip:
{{Dialogue|Uktulut will never suffer because of me again.
