==Objectives==
Ask [[Sendrax]] when the [[dragon]]s are expected to arrive.
*Inquire after the missing dragons

==Description==
How unusual.

[[Ebyssian]] told us that [[Wrathion]] would be awaiting our arrival along with an [[ambassador]] for [[Alexstrasza]] the Life-Binder, Queen of the Dragons.

It isn't like a dragon to break a promise.

At least this eager [[drakonid]] is here to greet us. Would you kindly inquire into when the others shall arrive?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Welcome to the [[Dragon Isles]], friend!

... I think I may have already said that. No matter! I am just excited you are here!

==Completion==
I do not know! As I said, this is my first assignment... Let me think on what to do.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Sendrax
:{{Gossip|quest=|Why aren't the dragons here to meet us?}}
:{{Text|say|Sendrax|Yes, I had expected [[Majordomo Selistra]] and Wrathion to be here by now...}}
:{{Text|say|Sendrax|But I am honored to be the one to welcome you to the Dragon Isles!}}
:{{Text|say|Sendrax|On my first real assignment, no less. What good fortune!}}

On alts, the followup quest is [[Adventuring in the Dragon Isles]].
