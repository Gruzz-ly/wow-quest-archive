==Objectives==
Speak with members of the [[red dragonflight]] around the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]].
*Speak with [[Commander Lethanak]]
*Speak with [[Amella]]
*Speak with [[Majordomo Selistra]]

==Description==
Hold a moment, <name>. I wish to personally thank you for your aid in restoring [[Ruby Oathstone|our oathstone]]. 

I was not aware of the [[dracthyr]] until your reawakening on the [[Forbidden Reach]]. It was unclear what your arrival among us meant. Whether your kind would prove to be a boon to the defense of life... or a bane. 

I would encourage you to learn more about our oathstone. Speak with a few of my flight here at the Ruby Lifeshrine. Perhaps you will find familiarity among our tales.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|12|87}}
* 3,650 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
There is much for the dracthyr to learn about the flights, <name>.

==Completion==
We all share stories of growth. I hope you have come to understand more of where we began and where we strive to reach.

==Notes==
Speak with [[Commander Lethanak]]:
:{{Gossip|quest=|What does a renewed oathstone mean to you?}}
::Our oathstone mirrors our strength in community, standing strong together.

::{{Gossip|Can you tell me more?}}
:::{{Text|say|Commander Lethanak|By now you've witnessed the strength of our flight, <class>.}}
:::{{Text|say|Commander Lethanak|It is not born of brute force as the djaradin cherish, nor is it derived from deceit and chaos as the Primalists employ.}}
:::{{Text|say|Commander Lethanak|I once considered physical strength the greatest of virtues. Chasing that ideal led me and my fellow soldiers to ruin from my carelessness and lack of consideration.}}
:::{{Text|say|Commander Lethanak|My queen showed me the true strength of our flight: community. That we are stronger together in our calling to protect life.}}
:::{{Text|say|Commander Lethanak|To me, the oathstone reflects our strength.}}

Speak with [[Amella]]:
:{{Gossip|quest=|What does a renewed oathstone mean to you?}}
::Our oathstone represents the grandest calling one can receive: a shared purpose to nurture life.

::{{Gossip|Can you tell me more?}}
:::{{Text|say|Amella|When I was first called to the [[Egg-Tenders]], I was unsure of myself. I did not believe that I was the kindest nor the brightest in my generation.}}
:::{{Text|say|Amella|In truth, I hoped that someone would discover I was not in the right place and direct me to another path.}}
:::{{Text|say|Amella|Someone did discover me, but certainly not in the way I had hoped!}}
:::{{Text|say|Amella|The queen herself singled me out to study under the previous head egg-tender. I thought she had made a mistake.}}
:::{{Text|say|Amella|Queen Alexstrasza encouraged me, saying that all I was expected to do was provide care for the eggs.}}
:::{{Text|say|Amella|To me, the oathstone represents that purpose to nurture all beings, no matter how reluctant.}}

Speak with [[Majordomo Selistra]]:
:{{Gossip|quest=|What does a renewed oathstone mean to you?}}
::Renewal of the oathstone means faith that we will stand in adversity.

::{{Gossip|Can you tell me more?}}
:::{{Text|say|Majordomo Selistra|My queen places great trust in me as her majordomo. Though there was a time when few considered me in high regard.}}
:::{{Text|say|Majordomo Selistra|I am one of the younger dragons, yet I have worked hard to achieve much in my life. Despite that, many considered me ill-prepared for responsibility.}}
:::{{Text|say|Majordomo Selistra|They were not quiet about their thoughts, either. At times, it became difficult to separate their feelings of inadequacy from my own.}}
:::{{Text|say|Majordomo Selistra|Others in my flight rose up to defend me and remind me what I was capable of.}}
:::{{Text|say|Majordomo Selistra|And then, when the queen herself placed her trust in me, I knew I had nothing to prove to those who doubted me, least of all myself.}}
:::{{Text|say|Majordomo Selistra|The oathstone reflects the power that is within each of us. Even if we doubt along the way.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Now that you have learned more about our personal connections to the oathstone, perhaps you will consider your own place among dragonkind.}}
