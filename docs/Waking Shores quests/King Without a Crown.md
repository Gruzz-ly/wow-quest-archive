==Objectives==
Investigate the Proto-Dragon Skeleton.
*Investigate the [[Proto-Dragon Severed Spine|Severed Spine]]
*Investigate the [[Proto-Dragon Charred Foreclaw|Charred Foreclaw]]
*Investigate the [[Proto-Dragon Cracked Rib|Cracked Rib]]

==Description==
This ancient [[proto-dragon]] must have been a glorious creature when it was alive--perhaps the largest the [[Wild Preserve]] has ever seen.

But it wasn't enough. Observe the skeleton more closely, so we may learn the story of its final moments.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
An incredible specimen--and a reminder of our origins.

==Completion==
So, a fight to the death with something just as strong? I wonder if it was protecting the preserve from invaders?

Thank you, <name>. It's good to remember the sacrifices of those that have come before us.

==Notes==
;Severed Spine
:{{Text|say|Dervishian|The dragon's severed spine looks like the deathblow. Beaten, broken... what a terrible battle this must've been.}}

;Charred Foreclaw
:{{Text|say|Dervishian|A flame hot enough to char dragon bone? This was either another proto-dragon of similar size, or something strong enough to threaten one.}}

;Cracked Rib
:{{Text|say|Dervishian|A cracked rib? Not enough to bring down a dragon, but few things can.}}

==Progression==
{{Professional Protographer}}
