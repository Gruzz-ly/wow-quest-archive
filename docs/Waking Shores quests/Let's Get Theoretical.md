==Objectives==
Help test the orbs against the [[Titan Barrier]] in [[Life Vault Ruins]].
*Fire and Air Orbs tested
*Barrier destroyed

==Description==
We now have four [[elemental]] orbs! Let us see which hypothesis proves fruitful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 7,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
My original hypothesis stands firm. The elements are more effective together.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Elementalist Taiyang
:Are you ready to test our elemental hypotheses?

:{{Gossip|I'm ready.}}

:{{Text|say|Elementalist Taiyang|Let's test each of our orbs on the barrier.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Acadia Chistlestone]]|Great. We all know tha [[:Orb of Primal Flames]] will burn past the barrier first!}}
:''Acadia starts channeling fire magic at the barrier.''
:{{Text|say|Acadia Chistlestone|It's--it's nae workin'!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher]]|Of course it isn't working. You need the unrelenting force of air!}}
:''Tae'shara starts channeling air magic into the barrier.''
:{{Text|say|Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher|This... isn't working either!}}
:{{Text|say|Elementalist Taiyang|Perhaps the orbs will overcome the barrier only when used together.}}
:{{Text|say|Elementalist Taiyang|<Name>, use the [[:Orb of Primal Stone]] while I use the [[:Orb of Primal Waves]]!}}

Stand in the circle and use the Test the Orb of Primal Stone extra action button.
:{{Text|say|Acadia Chistlestone|Hey, that's workin'! Hold just a second more!}}
:{{Text|say|Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher|This power...}}
:{{Text|say|Elementalist Taiyang|The barrier is down! We did it!}}

==Progression==
{{Beyond the Barrier}}
