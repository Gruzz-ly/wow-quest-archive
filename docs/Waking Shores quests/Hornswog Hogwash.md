'''Hornswog Hogwash''' is a [[world quest]] taking place in the [[Hornswog Hollow]] of the [[Waking Shores]].

==Objectives==
* [[Bullied Frog|Pacified Frogs]] Collected (12)
* [[Hornswog]]s Disciplined (8)
* [[Jar of Fireflies]] (provided)

==Description==
:{{text|say|[[Majordomo Selistra]]|These hornswog are completely out of control. Please, rescue any [[frog]]s you might find, and remind the hornswog of their place.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Notes==
Drive off [[Bossy Hornswog]]s and [[Rowdy Hornswog]]s by nearly killing them. Use the [[Jar of Fireflies]] on the small frogs to turn them into Pacified Frogs, then interact with them to collect them.

Selistra's "Pray return to the Waking Shores" line is a reference to Minfilia Warde in ''Final Fantasy XIV'', who frequently uses the line "Pray return to the Waking Sands" in early questing.
