==Objectives==
Buy the Archeologist Artifact Notes from Cataloger Jakes.
*Buy [[:Archeologist Artifact Notes]] from [[Cataloger Jakes]]
*Read the Archeology Artifact Notes

==Description==
<Cataloger Jakes quickly flips through her own supply bag and pulls out a freshly drawn map.>

One of our archeologists just reported some new findings in regards to a lost artifact, suspected to be in this area.

If you'll donate those supplies to fund the archeologist's next expedition, you can have this map that points to a nearby treasure.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Our archeologists love their work, but they still need funding to do it.

==Completion==
Rae'ana and I will be traveling with [[Toddy Whiskers|Toddy]] and [[Naleidea Rivergleam|Naleidea]] to our permanent basecamp, once they figure out where that's going to be.

Find us there later to see our full catalog.

==Notes==
;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Cataloger Jakes|That artifact should be marked on your map now. Happy treasure hunting!}}

Purchase some [[Archeologist Artifact Notes]] for 10 [[Dragon Isles Supplies]], then use the item to show the [[Golden Dragon Goblet]] on the zone map at {{co|66.0|41.5|Waking Shores}}.
