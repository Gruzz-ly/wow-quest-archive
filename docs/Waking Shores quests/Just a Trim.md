==Objectives==
Prune 5 Overgrown Shrubs.
*[[Overgrown Shrub]]s pruned (5)

==Description==
The [[bee]]s scaring the [[Dragon whelp|whelps]] is not the only problem. While pollination is usually a good thing, the recent swarm has caused the flora to grow out of control.

Would you mind taking my gardening shears and cutting back the shrubs? Some have already begun to sprout dangerous [[lasher]]s, but I hope we can stop more from doing so. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, after all.

And I could... very much use some prevention right now, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 7,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
If you use my gardening shears on anything other than plants, I will be very cross with you.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. With any luck, the bees will have fewer reasons to be close to the whelps now.

==Notes==
Interacting with the shrubs causes [[Over-Pollinated Lasher]]s to appear.

==Progression==
