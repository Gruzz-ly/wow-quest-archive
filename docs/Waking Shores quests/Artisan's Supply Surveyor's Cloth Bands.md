==Description==
Are you looking for work, tailor? The [[Artisan's Consortium]] asked me to craft some wristbands for their customers.

While I appreciate that these explorers are trying to involve themselves with our weaving, I do not have time for such requests.

Perhaps you would be interested in taking on this project?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|30|50}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Artisan's Consortium - Dragon Isles Branch]]
