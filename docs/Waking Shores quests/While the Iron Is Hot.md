'''While the Iron Is Hot''' concludes the Renown 11 chapter of the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]] campaign.

==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Zhurtan the Riverboiler.jpg|Zhurtan the Riverboiler|Kill Zhurtan the Riverboiler.}}
Slay Zhurtan the Riverboiler.
*[[Zhurtan the Riverboiler]] slain {{co|48.6|46.0|Waking Shores}}

==Description==
I spoke to our lookouts on the way down. They say this [[djaradin]]--Zhurtan the Riverboiler--has begun his heinous ritual southwest of here, close to the waterfalls where many of our [[ottuk]]s build their nests.

If they're boiling the river upstream from us now, I assume they've decided to be done with us more quickly. We would be forced to starve or retreat. We will do neither.

They've prodded us like cowards afraid of a true fight. So let's bring the fight to them this time, shall we?

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{abilities|[[Ottuk Taming]]|Allows hunters to tame ottuks within the Dragon Isles.}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* [[Tutaqan's Commendation]]
* Completion of "The Chieftain's Duty" for [[Friend of the Dragon Isles]]

==Progress==
We have your back, as you have ours.

==Completion==
Our river--and our people--could not have been saved without your help.

The [[Uktulut tribe]] owes you a great debt.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|Come, Qipi! I will armor you.}}
:''Tutaqan runs off, and Qipi follows.''
:{{text|say|Crafter Kuliqa|I don't know what you did to turn him around, <name>, but I'm happy something finally got through to him.}}
:{{text|say|Guard Hakota|Agreed. he might be a stubborn fool, but there's no tuskarr better with a spear than Tutaqan. In the end, I would trust no one else at the head of Uktulut.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Unujaak|A chieftain is not the head of a village, but the spine. Now that he is with us, we may once again stand tall--yet we must still all do our part.}}
:{{text|say|Guard Hakota|So we will. Hunters! Guards! Gather your weapons from Kuliqa and follow Tutaqan. If the djaradin send reinforcements, make sure none of them breaks through.}}

;Zhurtan the Riverboiler
Aggro:
:{{text|say|Zhurtan the Riverboiler|Our flames will devour these lands and reforge them in the name of the Qalashi! All will witness our strength!}}

During combat:
:''Tutaqan and Qipi join the fight.''
:{{Text|yell|Tutaqan|Come, Qipi! Together we will rid Uktulut of this monster!}}
:''Zhurtan casts {{Abilities|Lava Shield|id=373772|icon=inv_shield_1h_revenantfire_d_01}} on himself and encases Qipi in a {{Abilities|Rock Prison|id=373777|icon=ability_fomor_boss_rune_yellow}}. Tutaqan hacks at the prison.''
:{{text|yell|Zhurtan the Riverboiler|Let's see how you fight without your precious little pet!}}
:{{Text|yell|Tutaqan|Qipi! No! Not again... Not again!}}
:{{Text|yell|Tutaqan|So long as I draw breath, Qipi, they will never take you!}}

Rock Prison broken:
:''Zhurtan drops his lava shield and resumes attacking.''
:{{text|yell|Zhurtan the Riverboiler|Pathetic creatures! Now you will succumb to the fire!}}

Death:
:{{text|say|Zhurtan the Riverboiler|My body... feeds... the flames!}}
:{{Text|say|Tutaqan|Our enemies are many, Qipi. This was but the first to fall.}}
:{{Text|say|Tutaqan|We share the responsibilities of chieftain now. Our people will look to us to safeguard them.}}
:{{Text|say|Tutaqan|I cannot fail them again. I cannot fail you.}}

;On return
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|...and we will stand stronger than ever because of it. We may be tucked away here, far from Iskaara, but that distance need not truly separate us.}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|Trade will start again as soon as possible. I will personally gather our hunting party to protect our workers for as long as we are needed. Uktulut will flourish again.}}

;On completion
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|You have proven yourself a friend to me, <name>--and, more importantly, a friend to our people.}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|You are always welcome in the Uktulut Backwater.}}

Additionally, the NPCs of the town all turn friendly and offer their typical services, including a flight path.
