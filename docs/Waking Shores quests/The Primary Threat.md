==Objectives==
Find Commander Lethanak at the [[Flashfrost Assault]].
*Hop on a dragonriding mount (Optional)
*Report to [[Commander Lethanak]]

==Description==
There are far too many vulnerable eggs to secure. If the enemy breaks through, all is lost!

I am sure our guards are mustering on the field to push them back. Speak to Commmander Lethanak, and he will use your strength where it will be most helpful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
I will use every weapon in my arsenal to stop these foes.
