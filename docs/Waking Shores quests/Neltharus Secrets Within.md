==Description==
We have a problem, traveler. The [[djaradin]] first emerged from within [[Neltharus]], which means they must be ransacking the halls!

Neltharus contains many treasures. But more importantly, it contains knowledge: the history of [[Black dragonflight|our flight]] and its fall from grace. Both [[Sabellian]] and [[Wrathion]] have been looking for more information regarding [[Neltharion]]'s life and work.

Go! See what you can recover before the djaradin plunder it all!
