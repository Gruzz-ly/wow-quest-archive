==Objectives==
Collect 15 Water-Infused Shells and 15 Wind-Infused Shells from Soggymaw and Windyfin Gorlocs.
*[[Wind-Infused Shell]] (15)
*[[Water-Infused Shell]] (15)

==Description==
I was a fool to doubt [[Ecologist Iskha|Iskha]] when he insisted there was more to this. He wouldn't be my mate if he wasn't always two steps ahead of me.

We can make it up to him--by taking action, of course. If it's shells that are causing all this [[elemental]] chaos, why don't you go into their camp and take those shells right out of their slimy hands?

Bring back piles of the wind and water shells, enough for Iskha to research to his heart's content.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|97|48}}
* 250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
That ought to show them.

==Completion==
Iskha and I will take these back to the [[Ruby Life Pools|life pools]]--somewhere where they can't cause any more trouble.

You've done good work here today, <name>.
