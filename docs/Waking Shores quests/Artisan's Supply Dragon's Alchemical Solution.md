*[[Dragon's Alchemical Solution]] (2)

==Description==
Are you looking for work, alchemist?

The [[Artisan's Consortium]] has reached out to me with a "crafting order" for my alchemical solutions. I am as curious as the next [[dragonkin]] to find out more about these business practices, but I am simply too busy.

Perhaps this is an opportunity for you, my apprentice. Create some alchemical solution by reclaiming your earlier concoctions, and bring it to Haephesta, just down the path.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|30|50}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Artisan's Consortium - Dragon Isles Branch]]
