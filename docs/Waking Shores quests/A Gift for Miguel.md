Talk to Thomas about quality, then gather 3 Fiery Spirits near [[Hornswog Hollow]] for [[Miguel Bright|Miguel]]'s [[Miguel's Gift|gift]].
*Speak to [[Thomas Bright|Thomas]] About Quality
*{{Item|Fiery Spirit|s}} {{Profquality|3}} (3)

==Description==
<Name>, could you do me a favor?

I want to get a gift for my husband, Miguel.

He means so much to me, but I've been so busy lately that I haven't had time to make him anything.

Could you help me make him something high quality?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Gatherer's Reagent Pouch]]
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Artisan's Consortium - Dragon Isles Branch]]

==Progress==
Miguel will love this!

==Completion==
Fantastic! You're so swell!

Here, take this reagent bag as thanks. You can hook it into that extra spot on your belt. Oh, and if you need even more space, a skilled tailor can make you an even larger one.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Thomas
:Thanks for agreeing to help me make a gift for my husband, Miguel. If I could afford it, I would use only the highest quality reagents to make his gift.

:{{Gossip|quest=|What do you mean, "high quality"?}}
::Different reagents can have varying quality {{Profquality|tiers}}. Maybe you've seen this already: the same herb or ore can be normal quality {{Profquality|1}} or really excellent {{Profquality|3}} for crafting with.

::The reagent quality you gather is based on your skill as a gatherer. As you become skilled in gathering, you will tend to find higher quality reagents more often.

::Using higher quality reagents makes a better finished product, so please find me the highest quality materials you can for Miguel's gift!

::{{Gossip|What do you want to give Miguel?}}
:::Oh, I want to give him the world! But impossibilities aside, I want something that shows him my enduring love.

:::There are some [[elemental]]s not too far from here, over near Hornswog Hollow, whose spirited energy embodies my passion for him. Could you gather some of their spirited energy for me?

:::{{Gossip|I will find these for you.}}

::::Thank you! Best of luck, <name>.

:{{Gossip|quest=|I will use only the best reagents!}}

::Thank you! As you know, higher quality reagents {{Profquality|3}} make for higher quality products {{Profquality|5}}!

::Usually, the reagent quality you gather is based on your skill as a gatherer, but the reagents I need can vary in quality.

::Please gather only the best for my Miguel.

;Speaking to Thomas with the highest quality
:Have you found the reagents?

:{{Gossip|{{Profquality|3}} I found you the highest quality spirits.}}
::Oh wow, they're incredible! You are so amazing, thank you!

::Miguel will be thrilled to see such beautiful spirits.
::{{Text|emote|Thomas Bright squeals with delight.}}

;Upon completion with only gatherer professions
:{{Text|say|Thomas Bright|Thank you for gathering these! I'd ask you to help make the gift for Miguel too, but I need a crafter.}}
