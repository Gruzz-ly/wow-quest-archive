==Objectives==
Retrieve [[Veritistrasz]]'s time capsule.
*Activate the [[Mysterious Glyph]] {{Co|61.98|72.21|Waking Shores}}
*[[Time Capsule]]

==Description==
[[File:Mysterious Glyph.jpg|thumb|Mysterious Glyph]]
Thank you for listening to me, young one. I have a favor to ask.

Don't worry. No more stories.

When we left this place, I left a... time capsule of sorts. Would you... would you be able to retrieve it for me? We left it at the bottom of the [[Ruby Lifeshrine|Ruby Life Shrine]], hidden behind one of the pillars.

I hid it with a sigil. If you activate it, you should see my time capsule.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|30|50}}
* 5,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* [[Renewed Proto-Drake: Spiked Crest]]

==Progress==
I find myself oddly... excited?

Apparently I am looking forward to looking through the time capsule. How... unexpected.

==Completion==
Thank you, young one, you have given me a lot to think about.

It seems like I put this in the time capsule. I don't think I have much use for it anymore, maybe it's useful to you?

==Notes==
[[File:Time Capsule.jpg|thumb|Time Capsule]]
Find the [[Mysterious Glyph]] on the bottom of the Lifeshrine at {{Co|61.98|72.21|Waking Shores}}. Interact with it to reveal the [[Time Capsule]].
:{{Text|say|[[Mazastrasz]]|It's such a shame Veritistrasz won't help out. He grew up here, think of the things he could teach us!}}
:{{Text|say|Mazastrasz|I have tried to cheer him up, but nothing seems to work. I even brought the whelps over to him, but that just made him worse!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Crystastrasza]]|It's not something we can help with until he wants help. We can just be ready to provide support when he wants it.}}

;Upon completion
:''Veritistrasz sets the Time Capsule down next to him.''
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|It has been so long since I left this here. I barely remember what was in it.}}
:{{Text|emote|Veritistrasz starts looking through the time capsule.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|A pressed leaf. I'm sure I thought that was important at the time? Oh, this is an old focus for tending to the eggs. I remember this!}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|There is a lot to go through here and these old bones can only take so much. I will have to check through it later. Oh.. hmm... apparently I left a letter too.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|Oh [[Titan]]'s... I... I barely recognize the [[dragon]] who wrote this. I was so hopeful when I left. I was so sure we could make a difference.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|What I wouldn't give to feel just the smallest fraction of that again.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|Thank you, young one. You have given me some things to think about.}}
