==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Lookout Mordren.jpg|Lookout Mordren|A [[primalist]] lookout in Thaldraszus uses the Temporal Spyglass to plot his next attack.}}
Find the Temporal Spyglass.
*[[Temporal Spyglass]]
*Return to [[Cataloger Jakes]] in the [[Dragonscale Basecamp]].

==Description==
<The posted sign is written in beautiful calligraphy.>

The archivists humbly request that all expedition members seek out the Temporal Spyglass for our artifact archives.

If acquired, please deliver to Cataloger Jakes for processing and compensation.

Expedition members have reported overhearing a [[dwarf]] bragging about his magical spyglass in the [[inn]]s of Southern [[Thaldraszus]]. We recommend focusing your search in that region.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +250 [[reputation]] with the [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

You may also receive:
*[[Equipment]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supplies]]

==Progress==
Do you have something for the archives?

==Completion==
<Cataloger Jake shakes her head as she keeps the spyglass far from her eyes.>

No thanks. The present holds enough headaches for me. Don't need the past or present butting their unwanted faces in too.

I'll ensure this is properly documented, researched, and archived for the expedition.

==Patch changes==
