==Objectives==
Rescue the wildlife of the [[Restless Wetlands]].
*Wildlife rescued (20)

==Description==
It doesn't take an ecologist to see that the wetlands are in real trouble.

But [[Ecologist Iskha|Iskha]]'s got us stuck here examining dead creatures when we ought to be stopping them from dying in the first place! The [[red dragonflight]] is about preserving [[life]]--not dissecting it!

I love Iskha, and he's good at what he does, but if we wait until he's done puttering, there won't be any wetlands left to save. 

I'll manage his overthinking. You get out there, get your boots muddy, and rescue some wildlife.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|97|48}}
* 7,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
...but you still tried not to trample anything, right?

==Completion==
There! The wetlands are fixed! Meanwhile, Iskha is still doing his taxidermy... I mean research!

Wait, what do you mean the elementals keep coming?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Tharu|And remember... don't be afraid to get your hands dirty!}}

Clink on the [[Disgruntled Riverbeast Matriarch]], [[Distressed Riverbeast]]s, and [[Distressed Riverbeast Calf|Distressed Riverbeast Calves]] stuck in tornadoes (once they land on the ground, the player character is knocked back.), the [[Helpless Waterfowl]]s being drowned in water, [[Frazzled Basilisk]]s being blown away, [[Trapped Sea Turtle]]s and [[Trapped Turtle Hatchling]]s, and on the terrified [[Cowering Crab]]s.

;Upon return
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Tharu|I'm making an incision next to the left dorsal spine, and if you don't like it--}}
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Iskha|You're risking dorsal spine avulsion! Ugh, why won't you just listen to me?}}
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Tharu|Oh, <name>. Didn't see you'd returned.}}
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Iskha|Tharu and I can discuss this later.}}
