==Completion==
;Zayn Starmaker
<Zayn looks up and down your outfit with a judgmental eye.>

Allow me to give you a few pointers in tailoring.

;Krillonn
Draconic weaving is an ancient art. It takes decades, perhaps centuries, to master. No better reason to start today!

<Krillon{{sic}} eyes your hands.>

Don't worry, we have tools to assist those who lack natural claws.
