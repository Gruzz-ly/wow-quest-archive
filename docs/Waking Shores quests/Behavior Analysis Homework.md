==Objectives==
Pet 3 Sleeping Whelps and report back to [[Iyali]].
*[[Sleeping Whelp]]s pet (3)
*Report back to Iyali

==Description==
I need to talk to someone who knows proto-whelps. Like the ones that live in the [[Wild Preserve]]!

Are they as angry as the big ones? Do they bite or breathe fire at you?

What if I... er... you petted a proto-whelp? Would they know that you're nice and trying to help them?

I'm asking for science, of course. [[Tyrgon]] always tell us to test our hippa... no... hypo... hmph! Hyppotatotoast... ugh! THEORIES!

I think they would like petting and it would make them feel good. Could you test that for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|12|87}}
*4,550 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Do you think a whelp would feel better if I petted them? I always feel better when I get hurt and mom takes care of me.

<Iyali looks around, avoiding eye contact.>

I know I'm not supposed to touch the animals. It's for my homework on, uh, proto-whelp behavior. And it's due, uh, soon. So...

==Completion==
So, some proto-whelps like to be petted, but some don't?

That's not good. What if this one calls its friends? Or what if it's mean?

I mean, this lesson, uh, makes no sense! This, uh, homework is very difficult.

Thank you for helping me. I'm sorry if you got hurt...

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
:{{Text|say|[[Ji-eun]]|Do you think they will help us with the--}}
:{{Text|say|Iyali|Shhhh! They're going to hear you, Ji-eun.}}

Petting them yields a response from them, one likes it, second does a Startled Chomp, and the third one roars, calling a [[Protective-Proto Drake]].

;Reporting to Iyali
So... do they enjoy being petted?

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Report whelp behavior.>}}
::{{Gossip|One whelpling enjoyed being petted.}}
:::Aww! So they may enjoy being petted?
:::{{Gossip|<Report more whelp behavior.>}}
::{{Gossip|One whelping bit me and flew away.}}
:::One bit you? Oh no! It didn't hurt, did it? That's not good news...
:::{{Gossip|<Report more whelp behavior.>}}
::{{Gossip|One whelping called other proto-drakes to protect it.}}
:::B-big proto-drakes attacked you? That's s-scary.

:::<Iyali looks around, panicked.>

:::T-that's not good at all!
:::{{Gossip|quest=|<Finish report.>}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Ji-eun|Tell them, Iyali! Tell them!}}
:{{Text|say|Iyali|Ji-eun! I said I'd do it! Sheesh.}}

*Name: Field Research: Pet the Whelp

;Objective
Pet 3 Sleeping Whelps near the [[Wild Hatchery]].

;Alpha description
[[Ji-eun]] says a real Brave Researcher have{{sic}} experience with Proto-Whelps. Is that true?

<Iyali looks intrigued.>

What would happen if we... I mean... YOU pet a Proto-Whelp?

;Beta description
I've always loved all kinds of [[dragon]]s. Most kids do! Big ones, scary ones, TINY ones... Like baby [[Proto-dragon|proto-whelps]]! They're cute, and they are CUDDLY... I mean, they LOOK cuddly. Are they scaly? Hot? Kinda dry? Are they supposed to be that way? There's no way to test this hippa... no... hypa... hmph! Hyppotatotoast... ugh! THEORY. Except if someone... went up and petted one.

<Iyali looks at you with pleading eyes>

For science?
