==Objectives==
Teach a couple of Hornspikes to avoid Icicle Brew. You may unlock only one extra fishing net per day.
 
*Scared off Hornspikes (2)

==Description==
I found a perfect spot for a fishing net, one problem bothers me though... Those Hornspikes. I'm pretty sure they will ravage the nets as soon as it's left alone. What do we do?

...I've got an idea. We treat our lava fishing nets with Icicle Brew to make them heat-resistant. We just need to teach those hornspikes to keep away from that smell. 

Toss a flask of Icicle Brew at a hornspike, and then deal some damage to them. Just make sure not to kill them, they won't learn if they're dead, would they?

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Restock Fish|id=386887|icon=achievement_profession_fishing_findfish}}
*{{Abilities|Extra Net - Burning Ascent|id=399022|icon=achievement_profession_fishing_findfish}}

You will also receive:
*[[Ominous Conch]] (1)
*{{cost|2|80|90|}}
*1,150 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Did you teach them to keep away from the smell of Icicle Brew?

==Completion==
Well done! Feel free to use the fishing net spot now, there's enough room for us all.
