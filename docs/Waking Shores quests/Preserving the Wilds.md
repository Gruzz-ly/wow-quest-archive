==Objectives==
Free 5 [[Captured Proto-Whelp]]s or [[Captured Proto-Drake]]s.
*Proto-Whelps or Proto-Drakes freed (5)

==Description==
The [[Wild Preserve]] is one of the few areas where [[proto-dragon]]s thrive. But the [[Primalists]] are disrupting their nesting grounds by sending sorties to capture and experiment on proto-whelps and proto-drakes.

Show them no mercy. Locate these Primalist [[poacher]]s, wipe them out, and free their captives. The proto-dragon species depends on it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
If we want these creatures to survive, we must protect them.

==Completion==
Good. The Primalists remain a threat, but these dragons enjoy their freedom once again.

==Notes==
Kill [[Earthbound Primalist]]s and [[Windborne Primalist]]s.

==Progression==
