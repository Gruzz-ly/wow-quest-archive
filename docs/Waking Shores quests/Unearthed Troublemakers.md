==Objectives==
Kill 12 Earth Elementals in the [[Life Vault Ruins]].
*[[Earth elemental|Earth Elementals]] slain (12)

==Description==
The earth elementals are not just trying to repel us, they're destroying artifacts and equipment, too! It's as though they've been programmed to destroy anything [[titan]]...

We're holding them off, but we can't continue to study this site while they're here. Please help us push them back so we can have some exploring room!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ruby Guardian's Girdle
|Life Vault Cord
|Earth Binding Chain
|Cinch of the Ruby Defenders
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 7,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
The elementals caught us by surprise! Be careful!

==Completion==
That should be enough to solidify our position here. Good work, <name>.

==Notes==
