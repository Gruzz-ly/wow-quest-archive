==Objectives==
Kill 10 Primal Proto-drakes on the [[Wild Coast]].
*[[Primal Proto-Drake|Primal Proto-drakes]] slain (10)
*Meet [[Scalecommander Cindrethresh]] in [[Wingrest Embassy]].

==Description==
<[[Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Cindrethresh]] glances suspiciously at the [[proto-dragon]]s lurking on the ridge behind her.>

I'd swear that those proto-dragons edge closer to camp every time I turn my back...

Those are not the [[dragon]]s [[Ebyssian]] invited us here to meet.

Proto-dragons are ruthless predators who cannot be reasoned with. We must be ruthless in return.

Cull their numbers to keep their ambitions in check, or this expedition will be over before it begins.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Always keep an eye on the skies.

==Completion==
That may dissuade them from attacking the expedition camps for a time.

It's eat or be eaten in the [[Dragon Isles]], <name>. You'd do well to remember that.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of all three
:{{Text|say|[[Pathfinder Tacha]]|I suggest we keep moving.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Naleidea Rivergleam]]|[[Ebyssian]] said that [[Wrathion]] would be waiting for us at the embassy atop the hill.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Hopefully it's under attack. I could use a good fight!}}
:''The explorers run out of the camp, with the [[Curious Marmoni]] in tow.''
