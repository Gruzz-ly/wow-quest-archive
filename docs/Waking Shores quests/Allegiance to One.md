Who will you swear allegiance to for the week.

;[[Sabellian (faction)|Sabellian]]
:Sabellian's return from Outland marked the return of a new generation of black dragons. He is determined to see his flight return to its former splendor... minus the corruption that tainted it.

:From the moment of his birth, Wrathion was determined to clear the black dragonflight of its corruption. Once he succeeded, his attention turned to the world of Azeroth and its protection.
:To Wrathion, leading the black dragonflight isn't just his birthright... it is his destiny.
