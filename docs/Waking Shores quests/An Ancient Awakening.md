==Objectives==
Empower the Waygate.
*Prepare to charge the Waygate
*Waygate empowered
*Energy transferred to Waygate (0/100%)
*[[Ancient Waygate|Cobalt Assembly Waygate]] used
*[[Energized Arcana Vessel#An Ancient Awakening]] (provided)

==Description==
The waygate sits just behind me. There is no way to tell how long we have until the waning enchantment on this vessel fades, or even worse, breaks.

That amount of unstable energy being released could be catastrophic.

Shall we continue?

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
*{{Abilities|Ancient Waygates|Unlocks access to the Ancient Waygate travel network.|id=386485|icon=ability_socererking_arcanewrath}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]
* [[An Ancient Awakening (achievement)]]

==Progress==
We are almost there. Just a little longer.

==Completion==
Now that we, and by we I mean you, have figured out what these things are fer there's no tellin' how many more are out there!

Keep yer eyes open, <name>. No tellin' what we might find around the Isles.

==Notes==
A second copy of this quest was added in [[patch 10.2.6]]. This enables players to complete the quest a second time, though there is seemingly no benefit to doing so.

;On accept
:''Warpcaster Delandra makes her way toward the waygate stone.''
:{{text|say|Warpcaster Delandra|Use the vessel to begin the effusion. Though I must warn you, the fact that the energy has weakened the enchantment suggests it is highly volatile.}}
:''She stops in front of the waygate.''
:{{text|say|Warpcaster Delandra|On second thought...}}
:''Delandra takes a few steps back and shields herself inside a dome of arcane energy.''
:{{text|say|Warpcaster Delandra|All right. When you are ready.}}

At this point, there's small purple circle on the ground beside the waygate. Step on it and an [[Extra Action Button]] will appear:
*{{Abilities|Open Vessel|Unleashes the contents of the arcana vessel to empower a nearby waygate.|id=386193|icon=inv_inscription_inkpurple04}}

;Empowering the waygate
:{{text|say|Warpcaster Delandra|Something is wrong.}}
:{{text|say|Warpcaster Delandra|There is too much raw energy! Brace yourself!}}
:''The energy explodes and the screen goes black for a moment. When it fades back in, Delandra is standing at the waygate channeling her magic on it, and mana wyrms have swarmed the area.''
:{{text|say|Warpcaster Delandra|The gateway is overloaded! The explosion has spread arcana residue everywhere!}}
:{{text|say|Warpcaster Delandra|Find a way to redirect the energy back into the waygate!}}

Redirect the energy by interacting with [[Latent Arcana]] (7%) and slaying [[Mana Thirster (Azure Span)|Mana Thirsters]] (10%) and [[Mana-Crazed Wyrmling]]s (4%).

;Energy transferred to the waygate
:{{text|yell|Warpcaster Delandra|Come quickly! The way is open.}}
:{{text|emote|The waygate whirls with arcane energy as it activates.}}

Take the waygate to return to the [[Rubyscale Outpost]]. Delandra is already there.

Delandra has gossip here:
:We have shared quite the journey.

:I do hope you continue your work here on the [[Dragon Isles|Isles]], just as I shall continue mine.

;On completion
:{{text|say|Warpcaster Delandra|That was quite an adventure for us. I left a newly enchanted vessel with our friend here should you need it for your future endeavors.}}
:{{text|say|Warpcaster Delandra|Safe travels, friend.}}
:''She teleports away.''
