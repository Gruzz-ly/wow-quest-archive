;Speaking with Wrathion
:{{Gossip|I am ready to begin the assault.}}

Forces start streaming through the bridge. An [[Dragonflight cinematic|in-engine cutscene]] occurs:

{{#ev:youtube|ziftiYYVSs0}}
''As the Blacktalons are about to attack, a group of black dragons quickly appears to attack the enemies. Wrathion and their lead dragon transform and meet at the bridge.''
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Who are you?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Sabellian]]|Sabellian, heir of [[Neltharion]]. And you are?}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Wrathion, heir of Neltharion. And I've never heard of you.}}
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|Likewise.}}
:''The djaradin arrive for counterattack.''
:{{Text|say|Sabellian & Wrathion|We'll discuss this later.}}

Proceed further and pick up [[Taking the Walls]]. Travel with Wrathion to the ramparts and kill any combination from the following: [[Qalashi Necksnapper]]s, [[Qalashi Flamelobber]]s, [[Qalashi Pillager]]s, [[Qalashi Skullhauler]]s, [[Qalashi Gatecrasher]]s, [[Qalashi Stonebinder]]s, [[Qalashi Crustshaper]]s, [[Qalashi Boltthrower]]s, [[Djaradin Magmathrower]]s, [[Djaradin Flametamer]]s. Blacktalon operatives will sometimes spawn to help fight the enemies.
