==Description==
Welcome to basecamp, <name>.

It took [[Toddy Whiskers|Toddy]] and me awhile to settle on the perfect site to establish camp, but I couldn't be happier with our selection.

Easy access to ruins, [[proto-dragon]] breeding grounds, and of course the [[dragonflight]]s.

Why not take a few minutes to explore the camp and meet some of the suppliers helping to fuel the [[Dragonscale Expedition|expedition]]?

==Progress==
Welcome to camp, <name>!

Met me Granpap, did ye?

Well, don't believe all his stories... He loves to brag about the family!
