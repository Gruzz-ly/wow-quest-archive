'''It Belongs in a Museum... Eventually''' concludes the Renown 24 portion of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]] storyline, and thus wraps up the [[patch 10.0]] portion of the overarching [[Dragonflight campaign]] and likely the [[Friend of the Dragon Isles]] achievement. Up next in [[patch 10.0.7]], the [[Forbidden Reach storyline]]!

==Objectives==
Meet [[Toddy Whiskers|Toddy]] back at the [[Dragonscale Basecamp|Dragonscale Expedition camp]].
*Meet up with Toddy and Naleidea at the Dragonscale Basecamp
*Listen to Toddy and Naleidea

==Description==
Waves of [[titan]] security, escaped [[proto-dragon]]s, keys that turn you into [[Titanic watcher|constructs]]... I'll just say it.

I've never had so much fun in my LIFE!

Although [[Naleidea Rivergleam|Naleidea]] will probably say this is where the real fun begins. We're sitting on a trove of confidential titan data, thanks to the effort ye put in!
 
When ye can, come meet us at camp and we'll compare notes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18|}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Thanks again for a once-in-a-lifetime experience!

==Completion==
Our leads have dried up for now... at least until we can parse more information from these discs.

Until then, stay observant and follow the clues. You never know where the next adventure will come from!

==Notes==
Catch up with Toddy and Naleidea at their usual spot in the big tent at [[Dragonscale Basecamp]]:
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|If it isn't <name> the grand explorer! We were just chatting about those discs.}}
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|From what we can tell, these discs are rich in information--}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|--but not in answers.}}
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|[[Tyr]] was cataloging the lifecycle and overall potency of the various proto-dragon phenotypes in the Dragon Isles, although for what purpose we're uncertain.}}
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|In addition, he was keeping a considerable database on the role, disposition, and relative power of the [[Dragon Aspects|Aspects]].}}
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|Tyr's interest in the Aspects seems logical, but the proto-dragons, somewhat less so.}}
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|But the fact that he went to such lengths to keep this facility and its contents a secret--}}
:{{text|say|Toddy Whiskers|That's the real mystery.}}
:{{text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|Indeed.}}

Completing this quest is a criterion of [[Friend of the Dragon Isles]].

==Progression==
{{In the Halls of Titans}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
