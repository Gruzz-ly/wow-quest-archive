==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Acequian.jpg|Acequian|[[Scout]]s report this elemental is quickly growing in size.}}
Kill [[Acequian]] in the cave east of the [[Life Vault Ruins]].
*[[Orb of Primal Waves]]

==Description==
The [[:Orb of Primal Stone]] is a fortuitous find, but [[Acadia Chistlestone|Acadia]] and [[Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher|Tae'shara]] have conflicting hypotheses regarding the barrier.

I have my own hypothesis. Perhaps with more [[elemental]] orbs an answer will become clear.

One of the explorers saw an oversized [[water elemental]] in a nearby cave. Defeat the elemental, and perhaps you will find another orb.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|Band of Focused Elements
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|51|48|}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Did the elemental have another orb?

==Completion==
We must be like water: ready to adapt. Thank you for bringing the Orb of Primal Waves to me.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Acadia Chistlestone|Don't be daft, Tae'shara. Fire is more powerful than air. It consumes it!}}
:{{Text|say|Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher|And yet without air, what would fire be? We are not working in a vacuum, Acadia.}}
:{{Text|say|Elementalist Taiyang|Your hypotheses have merit, but I think we will find the answer lies in combining our efforts.}}

==Progression==
{{Beyond the Barrier}}
