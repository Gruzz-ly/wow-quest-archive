==Objectives==
Introduce yourself to the [[Alliance]] representatives.

==Description==
[[Orcish|Aka'Magosh]], <name>.

This expedition is under the protection of both the [[Horde]] and the Alliance. Our instructions are clear: give aid to any members of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]] regardless of their other allegiances.

The Alliance's representatives, [[Captain Garrick]] and her son [[Henry Garrick|Henry]], stand guard on the other side of camp.

I fought with Captain Garrick against the [[scourge]]. She is honorable and will serve the Expedition well.

Go offer her your assistance. Show her that the Horde honors its agreements.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
*1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Captain Garrick salutes your approach.>

[[Warlord Breka]] proves her honor once again by sending you to me.
