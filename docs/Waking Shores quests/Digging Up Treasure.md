'''Digging Up Treasure''' becomes available at [[Renown]] level 5 with the [[Dragonscale Expedition]].

==Completion==
Most of the treasure around here is in the ground--ancient artifacts, maybe even valuables. You're going to need a good shovel to get to it, though. Lucky you, I've got an official expedition shovel with your name on it. Look for disturbed dirt, and see what you can find.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Buried Treasure and the Clues to Look For|Gain the knowledge of what to look for to see the [[Disturbed Dirt]] of a buried treasure in the [[Dragon Isles]].|id=388265|icon=inv_misc_2h_farmshovel_a_01}}

You will also receive:
*[[Small Expedition Shovel]]

==Patch changes==
