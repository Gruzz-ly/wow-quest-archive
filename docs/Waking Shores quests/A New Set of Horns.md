*Meet [[Glensera]] in the [[Skytop Observatory]] {{co|74.1|57.9|Waking Shores}}

Just as mortals do, [[dragon]]s care very much about their appearance. Your drake is able to change as well, according to what you find and experience.

Speak to Glensera at the Rostrum of Transformation, and see for yourself!

==Progress==
Sometimes I wonder what I would look like with red hair. What do you think?

==Completion==
As you explore the [[Dragon Isles]], you will discover even more varied and unique appearances for your dragonriding companion. 

Both of you shall be able to travel in style! As one must, when exploring a new land. How else do you make the best first impression?
