==Objectives==
Gather 5 Milky Snapflowers, 3 Blooming Shallowlilies, and a Filled Life Pools Vial.
*[[Milky Snapflower]] (5)
*[[Blooming Shallowlily]] (3)
*[[Filled Life Pools Vial]]
*Components given to Bathoras
*[[Medicative Potion]]
*[[Empty Life Pools Vial]] (provided)

==Description==
It is a good thing you brought him here when you did. I can tell he is in a great deal of pain, though he bears it well. So must we all when it comes time.

I am afraid that it is age that ails him and not illness, but I may be able to relieve some portion of his suffering.

Would you mind gathering some snapflowers, shallowlilies, and pure water from the garden nearby? I can create a pain medicine with these components, if you find enough.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 7,250 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +75 reputation with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Was the [[dragonspawn]]... willing to make anything?

==Completion==
<Duroz takes the potion from you with a small, sad smile. He almost looks disappointed by something.>

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Bathoras|Please, have your friend sit down and rest while you wait.}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|Stay here, Duroz, I'll go get--}}
:{{Text|say|Duroz Scaletaker|The garden. I... want to sit in the garden.}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|Are you sure you want to see... Nevermind. Alright, come on, let's go to the garden.}}

Find the two plants in the pool, then mix them with the empty vial.

;Speaking with Bathoras
:Were you able to find the herbs? Snapflowers can sprout almost anywhere, but shallowlilies only grow on the surface of the water.

:{{Gossip|I have gathered the components for you.}}
:{{Text|say|Bathoras|One moment while I prepare the medicine...}}
:{{Text|say|Bathoras|Here it is. Please, take it to the old orc and remind him that I require no repayment. The [[red dragonflight]] values all life, even when it wanes.}}

;Speaking with Kolgar
:{{Gossip|It always comes down to this, doesn't it? Too little, too late.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|emote|Duroz takes a small sip of the medicine and frowns, looking out at the rest of the garden.}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|Don't tell me you're gonna complain about the taste.}}
:{{Text|say|Duroz Scaletaker|This is how it should have been.}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|What?}}
:{{Text|say|Duroz Scaletaker|They should have lived like this. The [[dragon]]s. The [[Dragon whelp|whelps]]. Free, unshackled, untainted.}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|You're not thinking about the rest of the [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]]. You're thinking about what you did.}}
:{{Text|say|Duroz Scaletaker|Every day of my life. And here they are making me medicine. Because they don't know.}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|You answered for it, Duroz. You were in [[Internment camp|that camp]] for years. You stood against [[Garrosh Hellscream|Garrosh]], against [[Warlord Zaela|Zaela]], against [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]]. You regained your honor and you defended it.}}
:{{Text|say|Duroz Scaletaker|I broke whelps younger than these, Kolgar. Some honor can't be regained.}}
:{{Text|emote|A [[Ruby Whelpling|ruby whelpling]] lands near Duroz's leg, curls up, and begins to drift off to sleep.}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|...Drink your medicine. It'll help.}}

Kolgar's gossip after completion:
:If the dragonspawn won't take my gold, I'll at least buy you a drink one day for helping.

:{{Gossip|Why are you traveling with a Dragonmaw?}}
::The same reason I'd travel with any orc.

::We all have blood on our hands. Duroz has the sense to know that washing it off won't make it go away. 

::There's something to learn from that.

;Duroz's gossip after completion:
: <Duroz frowns hard at the whelp sleeping near him. He does not touch it.>

:{{Gossip|I know of your clan. Why would you willingly come here?}}
::Arrogance.

:: I needed to see that we had not destroyed everything.

::I took that chance. It is the last thing I will take.

:{{Gossip|Kolgar said you were in the Dragonmaw. What is that?}}
::My clan.

::<He lowers his voice to a whisper, seeming very careful not to wake the whelp.>

::During the [[Second War]], we did... unspeakable things to the dragons. All in the name of twisting them into our service and turning them into weapons. All in the name of "glory."

::Nothing can ever undo what we did.
''Both responses lead to the following:''
::{{Gossip|You're doing your best.}}
:::Have you ever stood knee-deep in dragon blood?

:::I have.

:::My best is worthless.

::{{Gossip|You should pay for your crimes.}}
:::There is no price high enough that I could pay--not even execution.

:::Guilt is a long, empty road, and I will drag myself along it, hands and knees, until I grind myself into the gravel.

:::Execution would be a mercy. Save mercy for the ones who have earned it.
