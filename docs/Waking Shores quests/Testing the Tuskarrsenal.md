==Objectives==
Take the Uktulut Bone Spear and destroy 4 Tuskarr Training Dummies.
*[[Uktulut Bone Spear]] taken
*[[Tuskarr Training Dummy|Tuskarr Training Dummies]] destroyed (4)

==Description==
The first weapon is ready! Soaking the bones in river water warmed by the [[djaradin]]'s fire made them more pliable. I'll remember that trick!

Since you've been helpful so far, I'll do you the honor of letting you test out some authentic [[Uktulut]] weaponry. You'll find no sharper blade or sturdier haft this side of the [[Dragon Isles]].

Go test this out in our training area for me. Maybe it'll remind [[Tutaqan|the chieftain]] what real fighting looks like! Ha!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* [[Tuskarr Training Dummy (toy)]]

==Progress==
Our training area is just up the hill. Make sure those weapons are ready to crush some djaradin.

==Completion==
Haha! I heard that commotion all the way over here! 

If that talk doesn't get Tutaqan moving again, I don't know what will.

At least our hunters will have all the weapons they need to defend our village, with or without their huntmaster's help. Thanks, <name>.

==Notes==

Upon hitting a Training Dummy
:{{text|say|Uktulut Trainee|Look at that! I haven't seen a show of strength like that since the Chieftan's last hunt.}}
:{{text|say|Uktulut Trainee|A lucky shot! I softened that one up for you!}}
:{{text|yell|Uktulut Trainee|What I wouldn't give to be out on the field fighting like that again!}}
:{{text|say|Uktulut Trainee|Not bad, outsider! Save some of that for the djaradin!}}

;On return
:{{text|say|Crafter Kuliqa|Ha! Sounds like the new hunters are ready to go, even if the Chieftain isn't.}}

;On completion
:''[[Tutaqan]] walks out of the building he'd been sitting in.''
