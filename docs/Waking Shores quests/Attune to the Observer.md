==Objectives==
Technoscry for the three attunement relics.
* Recover the Attunement Relics (0/100%)
* [[Technoscryers]] (provided)

==Description==
Can you believe this used to be an observatory? Our records indicate that the [[dragonkin]] here were mapping heavenly bodies in an attempt to predict the future.

How do you think they did it?

I'm picking up a partial signature that matches the time window we're shooting for. Put on the Technoscryers and try to pinpoint the sources so we can dial it in.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Azerothian Archives]]

==Progress==
Without those attunement relics we won't be able to solve this mystery, <name>.

==Completion==
Ah ha! Give me your scryers, so I can calibrate them.

==Notes==

Follow the trail of the Scrying Mode to the nearby buildings to find a [[Weathered Staff]], [[Cracked Epaulet]], and [[Tattered Hood]].

If you put on the goggles and dance with Zenata, she responds with the following emote:

This is required for the [[Goggle Wobble]] achievement.
