==Objectives==
Speak with [[Chronomancer Phosildral]] and [[Sibrit Clacketpage]] in the [[Life Vault Ruins]].
*Share notes with Chronomancer Phosildral
*Share notes with Sibrit Clacketpage
*Feedback given
*Orb retrieved

==Description==
If you have a moment, <name>, I am close to a breakthrough!

After the creche collapsed, I lost more than my ability to fight. I lost my identity as a [[dracthyr]]. Perhaps you can understand.

I have always enjoyed putting things together and taking them apart, so [[Dragonscale Expedition|Expedition]] seemed like a good fit for me. But this artifact is giving me some trouble.

Would you ask Phosildral and Sibrit to review my notes? I want to prove I am a capable [[tinker]]... to them and to myself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|12|87}}
* 3,650 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
I almost have the orb where I want it, but I need just a little more time.

==Completion==
Our history is complicated, <name>, but I am eager all the same to unravel what we were meant to be... and what we will become. It is in our talons now!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|I will keep tinkering with this while you ask around for feedback.}}

Speak to Chronomancer Phosildral nearby:
:{{Gossip|Would you please review Eraleshk's notes?}}
:{{Text|say|Chronomancer Phosildral|This [[titan]] artifact has mystified much of the camp. Eraleshk's expertise is clear in their notes.}}
:{{Text|say|Chronomancer Phosildral|They have a hunger for knowledge, but truthfully, they know more about titan [[Technology|machinery]] than they think they do.}}
:{{Text|say|Chronomancer Phosildral|Here are my notes, but I suspect Eraleshk will discover they already have what they need.}}

Head to the other side of the camp and speak with Sibrit Clacketpage:
:{{Gossip|Would you please review Eraleshk's notes?}}
:{{Text|say|Sibrit Clacketpage|Eraleshk's technical drawings are very complex! I'm impressed!}}
:{{Text|say|Sibrit Clacketpage|You know, they've been awfully worried about deadlines and protocols. Which is funny because we don't have many of those at all!}}
:{{Text|say|Sibrit Clacketpage|I hope my scribbly little notes can put them at ease. They've got this!}}

Return to Eraleshk:
:{{Gossip|Here is the feedback on your notes, Eraleshk.}}
:{{Text|say|Eraleshk|Thank you, <name>. Their annotations are very thorough; it was kind of them to take the time. Now to make some modifications...}}
:{{Text|say|Eraleshk|Oh! The orb!}}
:{{Text|say|Eraleshk|It jumped right out of my hands. Would you bring it here, please?}}

Click on the [[Repaired Titan Orb]]. A projection of a [[titan watcher]] and a [[dragonspawn]] appears. Phosildral and Clacketpage run to observe:
:{{Text|say|Sibrit Clacketpage|Wow! You got that titan orb functioning! And it had a recording?!}}
:{{Text|say|Eraleshk|They were cataloging [[dragonkin]] cultural artifacts... Were the titans studying our history, too?}}
:{{Text|say|Sibrit Clacketpage|It's very likely! We haven't found a recording like that in some time. This will take our research in a whole new direction!}}
:{{Text|say|Chronomancer Phosildral|We have much to learn from you, Eraleshk. It is fortuitous that you are here to join our studies.}}
:{{Text|say|Eraleshk|I am pleased I have made a contribution to the Expedition! I promise to use my skills to aid our exploration of the [[Dragon Isles]]... and beyond!}}
