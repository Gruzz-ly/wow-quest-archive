==Objectives==
Escort the eggs to the [[Life Pools]].
*Hop on a [[dragonriding]] [[mount]] (Optional)
*Speak with [[Sabellian]] to begin moving the eggs
*Escort the [[wagon]]
*Speak to Sabellian atop the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]].

==Description==
With [[Obsidian Oathstone|the oathstone]] empowered once more, we must now transport the future of our kind to the Life Pools. It is the right of every true [[dragonflight]] to have their eggs nurtured by its waters.

Unfortunately, our enemies will be watching the skies, now that we have revealed ourselves. We will make the final leg of the journey on foot to avoid their scrutiny.

Meet me near the [[Obsidian Bulwark]], <class>. As the [[Alexstrasza|Life-Binder]]'s [[Champion (rank)|champion]], you are welcome to join me in this.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Expedition Researcher's Wraps
|Expedition Guard's Vambraces
|Expedition Mercenary's Bracers
|Field Scout's Bindings
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 11,350 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
You have served admirably, <race>.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''[[Wrathion]] and Sabellian fly toward the Obsidian Bulwark.''
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Wherever those eggs go, I go. You will not return them to Alexstrasza without me.}}

Follow suit and find the two dragons at the Bulwark sitting on an [[Inconspicuous Wagon]] pulled by two [[Expedition Shire]]s. Speak with Sabellian:
:Are you ready to depart, <class>?

:This will be our rally point if we become separated. Fall back and regroup here.

:{{Gossip|Let's get moving.}}
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|Stay close, champion. We cannot afford for anything to happen to the wagon or its contents.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Why are we taking this ridiculous contraption, again? It's agonizingly slow...}}
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|Our enemies will be on the lookout for us and we cannot risk an encounter while transporting the eggs. So we shall travel as mortals do to avoid their gaze.}}
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|If saving the future of your kind bores you, you are free to leave. I would welcome the silence.}}
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|Champion, to me!}}
:''Sabellian casts a spell as a group of a [[Tarasek Raider]] and two [[Tarasek Snatcher]]s attacks.''

During the attacks, Sabellian will alert:
*{{Text|say|Sabellian|I cannot maintain this forever, <class>!}}
*{{Text|say|Sabellian|Defend the wagon!}}
*{{Text|say|Sabellian|The horses will not move while the shield holds!}}

Fend them off:
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Is this your idea of subtlety?}}
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|Quiet, whelp. I will risk no harm coming to the eggs.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|I could assist our dear champion in defending the wagon, you know. There's no reason they have to do all the dirty work themselves.}}
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|And reveal ourselves to the enemy? Absolutely not. Stay in your seat.}}

A group of a [[Tarasek Watcher]] and two Tarasek Snatchers attacks! Fend them off too:
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|This is getting ridiculous. How many "random encounters" must we suffer before you realize your ruse has failed? Let us take wing and be done with it!}}
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|Cease your fidgeting! If anything is putting us at risk of discovery, it is your childish impatience.}}

A pair of Primalists attacks, and the enemies vary: It may be a [[Molten Primalist]] with a [[Primal Avalanche]] or a [[Lavacaller Primalist]] with a fire elemental. Fend them off as well.
:{{Text|say|Lavacaller Primalist|You're too late. The eggs are ours.}}

While crossing the bridge:
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Finally! I was worried the eggs would hatch before reaching the Life Pools!}}
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|[[Titan]]s, give me patience.}}
:{{Text|yell|[[Thaladrax]]|Your kind ends today, puppets!}}
:''Suddenly, a proto dragon appears and breathes fires at the wagon, destroying it and killing the two horses.''
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Is this the leadership you offer our people? Perhaps the others will see reason, now!}}
:''Wrathion transforms into his drake form and takes to the skies. Sabellian follows suit moments after.''
:{{Text|say|Sabellian|Whelps these days. Meet me at the Life Pools proper, champion. This is far from over.}}
