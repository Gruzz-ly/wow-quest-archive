Find the Ohuna Mass-Binding Totem.
*[[Ohuna Mass-Binding Totem]]
*Return to [[Cataloger Jakes]] in the [[Dragonscale Basecamp]].

==Description==
<The posted sign is written in beautiful calligraphy.>

The archivists humbly request that all expedition members seek out the Ohuna Mass-Binding Totem for our artifact archives.

If acquired, please deliver to Cataloger Jakes for processing and compensation.

Expedition members have reported a particularly powerful [[Primalist]] in the [[Windsong Rise]] of the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]], who appears to wield the rumored powers of this totem.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Equipment]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with the [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Do you have something for the archives?

==Completion==
Not sure I see what all the fuss is about with this one. Feels like every other dirty hunk of rock I've held before.

Oh well, I'll ensure this is properly documented, researched, and archived for the expedition.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
