==Objectives==
Find Sendrax in the Life-Binder Conservatory ruins.
*[[Sendrax]] found
*Meet Sendrax in the [[Life-Binder Conservatory]].

==Description==
Cadet Sendrax came through here not long ago.

She relayed [[Commander Lethanak]]'s orders for all [[drakonid]] to rally back at the [[Life Pools]]. Our whole defensive regiment set off in that direction not long after.

But our [[scout]]s were out on patrol in the old ruins, so she headed in there to rally them too.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|59|75}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Keep low, <name>.

==Completion==
I haven't read anything in the archives about the [[Primalists]] stealing [[dragon]] eggs before.

This is bad. Very bad.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Caretaker Azkra|Cadet Sendrax is showing some real promise with her eager attitude.}}
:{{Text|say|Caretaker Azkra|She will be leading her own regiment if she continues this way.}}

Head north into the [[Life-Binder Conservatory]] to find Sendrax hiding behind a dragon statue:
:{{text|say|Sendrax|Over here! And stay low!}}

Speak with her:
:<Name>! Thank the Aspects you're here!
:<Sendrax looks frantically around to ensure you weren't followed.>
:I couldn't find the scouts... the Primalists are here... I don't know what to do.

A cutscene plays out, showing gathered Primalists witnessing a [[proto-dragon]]'s speech:
