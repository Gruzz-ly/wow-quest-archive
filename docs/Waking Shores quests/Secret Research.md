==Objectives==
Help Iyali and their friends.
*Listen to [[Iyali]]
*Break the [[Explorer's Crate|crate]] open
*Supervise the kids
*Convince Iyali to accept help

==Description==
I know.. I am acting weird. I'm sorry!

You probably guessed I am not being truthful.

I can tell you my secret... if you like. But you will have to promise not to tell the adults!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 3,650 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
We found this Injured Proto-Whelp in the [[Wild Preserve]].

There was an evil [[Primalist]] attacking [[Proto-dragon|Proto-Dragons]] and... they hurt this poor little whelpling!

Please don't yell at us... We just wanted to help!

==Completion==
They did what? Oh, these younglings... When will they learn? They could have gotten hurt--or captured!

This is very serious indeed...

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''The nearby children gather round.''
:{{Text|say|Iyali|Okay, I'll reveal my secret...}}
:''Iyali jumps down from the crate.''
:{{Text|say|Iyali|But only because you promised you wouldn't tell anyone.}}

;Iyali's gossip
:Please, don't yell at us! I can explain...

;Crate broken
:''An [[Injured Proto-Whelpling]] with the Sick and Suffering buff appears.''
:{{Text|say|Iyali|Please, don't yell at us! I can explain...}}
:{{Text|say|[[Jolsai]]|It was not my idea!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Nime]]|See? Dis is why I would never invite Jolsai to my [[tribe]].}}
:{{Text|say|Iyali|I'll tell you everything! Swear on my [[alpaca]]! Just let us feed the whelpling, please.}}
:''Iyali approaches the whelpling.''
:{{Text|say|Iyali|Here, mister whelpling. We have a [[Extra-Delicious Riverbeast Meat|delicious piece of meat]] for you.}}
:{{Text|say|Iyali|Why is it not eating? Come on, you have to eat.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Ariel (human)|Ariel]]|Maybe it's not hungry...}}
:{{Text|say|[[Nusall]]|I read [[animal]]s refuse to eat when they are about to die.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Ji-eun]]|Nusall! Don't say that! Poor little whelp... I don't want it to die. We must do something!}}
:{{Text|say|Iyali|Poor little whelp... It's all my fault...}}

;Speaking with Iyali
:<Iyali holds back tears.>

:I'm sorry, I'm sorry. We won't do this again, I swear on my alpaca.

:We didn't want to cause trouble. But if we had told the adults, they would yell at us and we would be in trouble... like we always do!

:<Iyali looks disappointed.>

:What do we do now? Poor whelpling... It's all my fault!

:{{Gossip|First explain to me how this proto-dragon whelp got here.}}
::We were just very focused, uh, studying, when we heard a noise coming from down the river. 

::It was a bad guy primalist hurting proto-drakes! And he left this little proto-whelp alone and hurt!

::The adults were busy, and we didn't know what to do, so... 

::<Iyali straightens with pride, and she looks to you for approval.>

::We waited until the bad guy was gone and rescued the whelp ourselves!

::{{Gossip|You could have gotten hurt, Iyali.}}

:::<Iyali holds back tears.>

:::I'm sorry, I'm sorry. We won't do this again, I swear on my alpaca.

:::We didn't want to cause trouble. But if we had told the adults, they would yell at us and we would be in trouble... like we always do!

:::<Iyali looks disappointed.>

:::What do we do now? Poor whelpling... It's all my fault!

:{{Gossip|quest=|This creature is too injured. We need a researcher to help.}}

::Okay... you're right... the whelpling needs it...

::I guess I should tell Professor Tyrgon? He's smart, and I've never seen him yell at anyone.

::Also, uh, can we say it was my idea? The other kids did nothing wrong... They don't need to get in trouble. It was, uh, all my plan!

::{{Gossip|quest=|<Agree to Iyali's terms.>}}

:''Iyali makes a few steps and faces [[Tyrgon]].''
:{{Text|say|Iyali|Okay. I'll do it. For the whelpling...}}
:{{Text|yell|Iyali|Professor Tyrgon!}}
:''Tyrgon runs toward the gathered children and the proto-whelpling.''
:{{Text|say|Tyrgon|Why is... who? Iyali?}}
