==Objectives==
Assist [[Tyrgon]] to heal the creature.
*Treat the whelpling
*Name the whelpling

==Description==
<Name>, I require your assistance...

I hope no one was expecting me to craft, subdue the whelp, heal, and teach these [[child]]ren all at once! Multitasking like that is certainly overrated.

Now, you can start by using those flowers. I'll need a couple minutes to prepare myself to heal [[Injured Proto-Whelpling|the proto-whelp]].

Hopefully, the children will find this incident... instructional.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 650 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Where on earth did they get the idea we wouldn't help them? I need to investigate this further...

==Completion==
Great work, <name>! I hope the younglings learned a valuable lesson... or a memorable one at least.

We will keep the whelpling here for a while as I need to ascertain the best occasion for returning it to [[Wild Preserve|Preserve]].

I shall also make you an honorary Brave Researcher. Your commitment was essential for this creature's survival. I'll just advise you to tell me sooner if you see the children plotting something reckless again.

Now, if you excuse me, I must reevaluate my pedagogy. It's clearly not working.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Tyrgon|Alright! We can finally treat this poor whelpling. Enough suffering.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrgon|Make a balm with those flowers and apply to this creature's wounds.}}

;Treating the whelping
:{{Text|say|[[Tyrgon]]|Terrific. Now let's speed up these healing properties.}}
:''Tyrgon channels the [[Light]] into the whelpling.''
:{{Text|say|[[Twinkle (goblin)|Twinkle]]|Wow!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Ariel (human)|Ariel]]|Whoa! It's sooo pretty.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Jolsai]]|Are we gonna learn how to do that?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Ji-eun]]|It's flying! It's healthy! We saved the little whelp!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Iyali]]|Mister Tyrgon, are we, uh, keeping it?}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrgon|What do you say, brave adventurer? Do they deserve it?}}

The whelpling is now Healthy Proto-Whelpling with the Happy and Healthy buff.

;Speaking with Tyrgon
:You did good, <name>.

:I'm keeping the proto-whelp here for a while to make sure the healing effects are permanent before its reintroduction in the wild. That will also give these kids a "learning focus".

:What do you say of choosing a name for the whelping?

:{{Gossip|quest=|<Name proto-dragon whelp.>}}

::The children gave me these options, but I think it's better you decide. 

::I don't want to be accused of favoritism.

::{{Gossip|Toughscale}}

::{{Gossip|Bob}}

::{{Gossip|Mr. Nibbles}}

::{{Gossip|Lord Firegiggle}}

::{{Gossip|Baron von Swoopenbite}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Tyrgon|Children, what do we say when someone helps us?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Nusall]]|Thank you, friend.}}
:{{Text|say|Ji-eun|Thank you very very very much!}}
:{{Text|say|Iyali|Sorry for the trouble, brave <class>.}}

Completing the quest also awards the "Brave Researchers" criterion of [[Sojourner of the Waking Shores]].
