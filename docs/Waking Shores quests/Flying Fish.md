==Objectives==
Collect [[fish]] to restock the [[Fishing Hole|fishing hole]] and [[Dragonriding|mount your drake]] to drop them from above.
*Collect [[Stock Fish]] (3)
*Drop the fish from above (3)
*[[Throw Net]] (provided)

==Description==
The fish could be biting better, don't you think?

You know, that gives me an idea. Legend says these lakes and rivers did not always have fish. They say, these watering holes were stocked with fish when the [[dragon]]s soaring overhead dropped them! Can you believe it?

Maybe you and your drake could give it a try?

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Restock Fish|id=386887|icon=achievement_profession_fishing_findfish}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|12|87|}}
*4,550 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Have you dropped those fish yet?

==Completion==
Ha! The legends are true, how fantastic!

==Notes==
Use the quest item in the northern part of the river, then return back and use the Release Fish extra action button.

==Patch changes==
