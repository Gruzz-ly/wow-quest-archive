'''Rumors of the Jeweled Whelplings''' is offered by [[Boss Magor]] at [[Dragonscale Basecamp]] to players who have reached Renown 21 with the [[Dragonscale Expedition]].

==Completion==
Have you heard the tale of this ancient jewelcrafter from the [[Dragon Isles]]? Legend has it they had a technique to craft jeweled [[Dragon whelp|whelpling]] statues that would come to life. I took it for just a story as well, but then this map was found in the pack of one of our fallen [[scout]]s with a clue to a jeweled whelpling. Take the map, see if it leads to the secret of creating these fabled living statues.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Onyx Gem Cluster Map]]
