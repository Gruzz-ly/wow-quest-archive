==Objectives==
Collect 20 Primal Proto-Whelp Scales.
*[[Primal Proto-Whelp Scale]] (20)
*Meet [[Boss Magor]] in [[Wingrest Embassy]].

==Description==
These [[proto-drake]]s are unlike any I've seen before on [[Azeroth]].

Their scales appear to be naturally flame-resistant, stronger than steel, and don't lose flexibility in the process. Incredible.

My artisans--all of them--are clamoring to get their hands on some of those scales to work with.

Start with the [[Dragon whelp|whelps]]. The smaller scales should be more pliable until we've mastered our techniques with them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Have you got the scales yet? The [[alchemist]]s are getting antsy, and that always makes me nervous.

==Completion==
<[[Boss Magor]] carefully studies the scales.>

Our artisans will put these to good use. Thank you.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of all three

:{{Text|say|[[Scalecommander Cindrethresh]]|Hopefully it's under attack. I could use a good fight!}}

[[Primal Proto-Whelp Scale]]s drop from [[Primal Proto-Whelp]]s on the [[Wild Coast]].
