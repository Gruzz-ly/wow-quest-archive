==Objectives==
Sit for a while, and look at the landscape.
*Sit and look at the view
*Listen to [[Veritistrasz]]'s Stories

==Description==
<The old [[dwarf]] doesn't react to your presence as you approach. As he gazes over the landscape, a deep frown is set in his face. It's a pleasant view. It might be nice to take a break and watch the landscape.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|12|87}}
*3,650 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
<The dwarf continues to look off into the distance. You notice water welling up in his eyes.>

==Completion==

<The Dwarf continues to look off into the distance.>

;Story listened to
Thank you for listening to me, young one. I appreciated it more than you can know.

==Notes==
Upon accepting the quest, click on the Stay a While [[Extra Action Button]], then speak with Veritistrasz to continue.

It's possible to complete the objective at any time by selecting "<You are busy. Get up and leave.>" This will allow you to turn in the quest, and will result in different completion text. However, you won't be eligible for the next quest until you sit and listen to Veritistrasz fully.

:{{Text|emote|Veritistrasz glances at you.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|This view, it may look beautiful to you. To me, it reminds me of how long we have been gone. I barely recognize this landscape.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|I grew up here, when it was called the Broodlands. I used to tend the [[Ruby Lifeshrine|Lifeshrine]], so many years ago. Then we left to help safeguard the mortals...}}

:{{Gossip|Ask what it felt like to leave the [[Dragon Isles]].}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|The reason I am here, looking over this alien landscape, is that for such a long time... I dreamed about returning here.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|This was my home. I never expected we would be gone for so long. After a while, I never expected to return.}}

:{{Gossip|How does it feel to be back?}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|You can probably remember where you grew up. The smell of your parents cooking, or can remember playing with your friends who lived close by.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|Now imagine that you have forgotten how to get to your childhood home. You can never visit again, can never walk the paths of your childhood.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|Perhaps you think me overly sentimental. You try living for ten thousand years, never being able to visit your home, finally visit it only to find it completely different, and then come back to me.}}
*{{Race|BloodElf|notext}}{{Race|VoidElf|notext}} {{Text|say|Veritistrasz|Although... [[Arthas Menethil]] did cut a bloody swath through [[Silvermoon City|Silvermoon]], I imagine you can relate to what I speak of.}}
*{{Race|Draenei|notext}} {{Text|say|Veritistrasz|Although... I heard about [[Argus]]. Whether you were born on the planet or after your people fled, I imagine you can relate to what I speak of.}}
*{{Race|NightElf|notext}} {{Text|say|Veritistrasz|Although... I used to visit [[Teldrassil]] when I could, now it is yet another thing we shall both never see again. I imagine you can relate to what I speak of.}}
*{{Race|Worgen|notext}} {{Text|say|Veritistrasz|Although... The loss of [[Gilneas peninsula|Gilneas]] was a tragedy on two fronts. Your curse is one that must be hard one to bear, I imagine you can relate to what I speak of.}}
*{{Race|Gnome|notext}} {{Text|say|Veritistrasz|Although... I heard [[Gnomeregan]] was lost for a while and the damage will last for many years? I imagine you can relate to what I'm talking about.}}
*{{Race|Orc|notext}} {{Text|say|Veritistrasz|Although... What [[Ner'zhul]] did to [[Draenor]] was unthinkable. To have your homeland destroyed... I imagine you can relate to what I speak of.}}
*{{Race|Goblin|notext}}{{Race|Human|notext}}{{Race|Tauren|notext}}{{Race|Troll|notext}}{{Race|Pandaren|notext}} {{Text|say|Veritistrasz|Although... there is enough war in this existence that maybe you do know something about that after all.}}

:{{Gossip|Ten thousand years is a long time.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|Ten thousand years.... I can barely believe it's been that long since we left.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|You can't imagine how awful that time was, the fear that surrounded us. The [[Great Sundering|Sundering]], the Betrayal of the [[black dragonflight]], the [[Dragon Wars]].}}

:{{Gossip|Ask about the Dragon Wars.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|The Dragon Wars... you may call it something different, but I was there, and that's what I call it. All the [[dragonflight]]s versus the black dragonflight.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|You would think it would be an easy fight? Four versus one after all, even with the [[Demon Soul]].}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|The [[Blue dragonflight|blue flight]] was nearly destroyed in [[Deathwing|Neltharion]]'s initial strike, so three to one. Still great odds. Until you realize what it was like.}}

:{{Gossip|What do you mean?}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|You only know Neltharion as Deathwing, and his brood as mad, evil beings. We knew them before they fell.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|This wasn't some unknown menace. This wasn't some great evil looming like the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] was. These were our friends, our loved ones.}}

:{{Gossip|That sounds awful.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|It was awful, not knowing what's going on. Thinking there was something you could do to snap them out of it.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|They were my friends... and they were killing my brothers and sisters.}}

:{{Gossip|You had friends in the black dragonflight?}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|I had many friends in that dragonflight, some as close as clutchmates. Heh, growing up we used to play pranks on the elders.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|I remember one time we coated [[Alexstrasza]]'s tail in honey while she slept and... ah... what does it matter.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|My best friend was of the black dragonflight. We intermingled a lot, back in those days... not like now, where most flights keep to themselves.}}

:{{Gossip|Tell me more about your friend.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|Isn't it funny? I can't remember her name. I can remember her face, I can remember how the light bounced off her beautiful scales, but I can't remember her name.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|I can remember the horror when I came home to find her standing over the bodies of my family, practically her family.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|I can remember the gut-wrenching despair as I plunged my claw into her throat, and I remember the hate in her eyes as the light went out in them... but I can't remember her name.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|I always wondered, if I had been a better friend, could I have prevented it? Did she not feel like she could come to me as she felt the corruption starting?}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|[[Ebyssian]] was cleansed. There must have been something I could have done? But she didn't come to me, must have felt she couldn't talk to me about it.}}
:{{Text|say|Veritistrasz|If I was a better friend... if I had told her... oh [[Titan]]s, if I had told her how I felt... could it have gone differently?... I loved her... and I can't remember her name.}}
