==Objectives==
Glide through the rings and land in the target area.
*Hop on your [[:Renewed Proto-Drake]] mount (Optional)
*Glide Through The Rings (5)
*Land in the Target Area
*[[Bronze Timepiece]] (provided)

==Description==
Let us start with the basics.

If you fly straight you will wear yourself out right now. Use gravity as an aid and aim slightly down to fly a long distance. The rings will give you the general angle that you should use for basic gliding.

First, call upon your drake.

Then, fly through the rings and land at the target location.

If you find yourself stuck, use the Bronze Timepiece and [[Celormu]] will reset you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Well done, 0xcp{{sic}}.

==Completion==
Excellent work!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Lord Andestrasz|Call upon your drake companion, then drop off the edge while moving forward. You will glide to your destination!}}

Use the [[Renewed Proto-Drake]] to learn it, then mount up on it to spawn in some gold rings. Glide through all five rings and land near [[Celormu]]. On complete, Celormu teleports himself and the player back up to [[Lord Andestrasz]].
