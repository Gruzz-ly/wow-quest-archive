==Objectives==
Collect [[fish]] to restock the [[Fishing Hole|fishing hole]] and [[Dragonriding|mount your drake]] to drop them from above.
*Collect [[Stock Fish]] (3)
*Drop the fish from above (3)
*[[Throw Net]] (provided)

==Description==
The fish could be biting better, don't you think?

You know, that gives me an idea. Legend says these lava lakes are not always abundant with hot-loving fish. They say, pools were stocked with fish when the dragons soaring overhead dropped them!

Can you believe it? Maybe you and your drake could give it a try?

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Restock Fish|id=386887|icon=achievement_profession_fishing_findfish}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|4|50|}}
*4,550 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Have you collected those fish yet?

==Completion==
Ha! The legends are true, how fantastic!

==Notes==
Use the quest item in the southern part of the lava river, then return back and use the Release Fish extra action button.
