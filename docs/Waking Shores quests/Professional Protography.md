==Objectives==
Use the Vertical Enhancement Apparatus and photograph the Slumbering Proto-Dragon.
*Jump on the [[Vertical Enhancement Apparatus]] (Optional)
*Photograph the [[Slumbering Proto-Dragon]]
*[[Wulferd's Award-Winning Camera]] (provided)

==Description==
I haven't trained a photographer as good as you... that's still alive, that is. It's a dangerous profession.

Speaking of dangerous, our final target is a large proto-dragon we believe may be one of the next apex predators in this preserve. Let's get up close and personal and take a picture!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Don't worry, <name>. You're much more competent than the last person I sent up there.

==Completion==
So totally unrelated, but you didn't see another camera up there, did you?

You know what? Forget I said anything.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Cataloger Wulferd|Adventurer, over here! I have another assignment for you.}}

;At the first highlighted area
:{{Text|say|Cataloger Wulferd|Excellent work! Now let's--wait, no. You're a bit too far away. Get closer.}}

;At the second highlighted area
:{{Text|say|Cataloger Wulferd|Still a bit too far away! Step closer. Don't worry, he's fast asleep.}}

;At the third highlighted area
:{{Text|say|Cataloger Wulferd|Yes! Perfect! Take the shot!}}

Taking the shot awakens the dragon who knocks you down to the river below.
