==Objectives==
Speak with [[Wrathion]]'s followers.
*Speak with [[Talonstalker Kavia]]
*Speak with [[Left]] and [[Right]]
*Speak with [[Archivist Edress]]

==Description==
I have dedicated myself to saving [[Azeroth]] from destruction time and time again, and [[Sabellian|this fool]] thinks he can just swoop in and claim the title of [[Dragon Aspects|aspect]]? I think not.

Talk to my people, <name>. See what they have to say about me and what I have done for this world.

You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Their loyalty is unquestionable.

==Completion==
Surely you back my claim, do you not, <name>?
