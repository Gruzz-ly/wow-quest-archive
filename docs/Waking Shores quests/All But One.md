==Objectives==
Find Ipko.
*[[Ipko]] found
*Ipko returned

==Description==
I have seen what you've done for the village. In easier times, I would have handled it, but...

<Tutaqan glances towards the river, then back to you.>

Some of our [[ottuk]]s went missing recently. We believe they swam too close to the [[djaradin]]'s territory. Several were recovered. None of them alive. Few in one piece.

We could not find my ottuk, Ipko. She has been my hunting partner for many years. If she...

<He shakes his head.>

Please... aid me. If you search the river, I will search the shore.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I shouldn't have let her wander so far...

==Completion==
This is my fault.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|I will make my way to the shore, <name>. I just... need a moment to prepare.}}
:{{text|emote|[[Elder Unujaak|Unujaak]] frowns in silence as he glances over at Tutaqan.}}
:''Elder Unujaak makes his way over.''
:{{text|say|Elder Unujaak|May I help with the search, Chieftain?}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|You have your own concerns.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Unujaak|I am concerned for all members of the tribe. If Ipko cannot be returned safely, I would still see her returned to us. Perhaps then you can--}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|She will be returned safely.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Unujaak|...Yes, Chieftain.}}
:''They both head toward the river.''

;Approaching Ipko
Tutaqan and Unujaak appear at the other side of the river:
:{{text|yell|Tutaqan|Is--Is that Ipko? Yes! I think she's alive!}}

Elder Unujaak's gossip dialogue here is different from usual:
:If the chieftain needs my support, then he will have it.

;Carrying Ipko
When you pick her up:
:''[[Carrion Phoenix]]es descend on the two tuskarr; Unujaak puts up a water barrier to hold them off.''
:{{text|yell|Tutaqan|It's Ipko! Oh ancestors, I--<name>, please, bring her here! Unujaak can heal her!}}
:{{text|yell|Elder Unujaak|Tutaqan, stay back! It's too dangerous with the djaradin's beasts swarming! We cannot lose you too!}}

While you carry Ipko, you have the following buff:
:{{Abilities|Carrying Ipko|Carrying the body of Ipko. Slowed and occasionally attracting the attention of nearby scavengers. Attacking or taking any actions will cause you to drop Ipko.|id=372806|icon=inv_riverotterlargemount01_brown}}

Carrion Phoenixes will periodically attack. If you fight back or take any other action, you'll drop Ipko and gain the following debuff:
:{{Abilities|Dropped Ipko|You dropped Ipko! Pick her up and keep moving before the scavengers snatch her away.|id=372816|icon=spell_misc_emotionsad}}

;Ipko returned
:''Unujaak's shield bursts, and the phoenixes attacking it fade away.''
:{{text|yell|Tutaqan|Ipko! Give her to me, please!}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|Is she...? No, she's... gone.}}

;On completion
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|I'm... I'm so sorry, Ipko.}}
:{{text|say|Tutaqan|I failed you. You were my greatest friend, and I failed you. Ancestors forgive me...}}
:''He walks away.''
