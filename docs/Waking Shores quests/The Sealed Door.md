==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Sealed Titan Facility|Sealed Door]] in [[Thaldraszus]] and speak to [[Naleidea Rivergleam|Naleidea]].

==Description==
Our scouts have been combing the [[Dragon Isles]] for anything of interest. They've returned much of note, but one discovery stands out amongst the rest--a door.

A door forged by the [[titan]]s, and sealed against the world. No one has yet managed to find their way through to the artifacts that surely lie within.

But then, no mystery has endured under the discerning gaze of the [[Reliquary]].

With the help of the [[Explorers' League|Explorer's League]], this challenge will be simple, I am certain.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I trust the journey was trivial for one of your capabilities.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Naleidea
:{{Gossip|Port me to the Titan Facility.}}

The [[Sealed Titan Facility]] is, as expected, outside [[Tyrhold]]. [[Naleidea Rivergleam]], [[Toddy Whiskers]], and [[Oliver]], Naleidea's familiar, have all arrived &mdash; Toddy's staring at the feet of a broken watcher statue.

Toddy has gossip here:
:Have you seen this size of this DOOR?! And the craftmanship is just... I mean look at it!

:I wonder what's behind it?

==Progression==
