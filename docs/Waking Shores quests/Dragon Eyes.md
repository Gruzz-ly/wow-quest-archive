==Objectives==
Speak with [[Myridian]], [[Zepharion]] and [[Evorian]] in the nearby areas.
*[[Myridian Report]]
*[[Zepharion Report]]
*[[Evorian Report]]

==Description==
We know the [[Djaradin]] will attack us directly, but I'm worried about other dangers out there as well. Ones that aren't so obvious.

I have dispatched three [[dragon]]s to survey the surrounding area and pinpoint any potential threats.

Meet with each of them, and collect their report for me. Once you have gathered this information, return to me so we can best prepare for what the Djaradin are planning.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Sabellian (faction)|Sabellian]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*2x [[Primal Chaos]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]
*Gear piece

==Progress==
What have you discovered?

==Completion==
Thanks to you, we will be better prepared for anything the Djaradin plan to throw at us.

We will always keep our eyes open.

==Notes==
;[[Myridian]]
:{{Gossip|What have you found here?}}
:{{Text|say|Myridian|As long as the [[Worldbreakers]] hold onto the belief that [[Neltharion]] will return... there is little hope of them joining [[Black dragonflight|our flight]].}}
:{{Text|say|Myridian|I will continue my observations, perhaps there is a way to change their minds.}}

;[[Zepharion]]
:{{Gossip|What have you found here?}}
:{{Text|say|Zepharion|The forces here have powerful casters among their ranks. It will take a large show of strength to push them out of this position.}}
:{{Text|say|Zepharion|The djaradin are well-known to be hunters of all dragons.}}
:{{Text|say|Zepharion|Yet these specific [[proto-drake]]s seem to flock to this location and suffer no harm.}}
:{{Text|say|Zepharion|I will attempt to weaken their perimeter in preparation for an attack.}}
:{{Text|say|Zepharion|I have even observed a drake flying down into the djaradin encampment and greeted... well not warmly. But certainly not like an enemy.}}
:{{Text|say|Zepharion|These drakes have also flown off towards known [[Primalists|Primalist]] camps. There seems to be a sort of uneasy alliance going on between the two groups.}}
:{{Text|say|Zepharion|Whatever the deal between the two, it cannot mean good tidings for the rest of us.}}

;[[Evorian]]
:{{Gossip|What have you found here?}}
:{{Text|Say|Evorian|Read the report, the coastline is safe from the [[Burning Legion]], the [[Gronn]], the Djaradin... whatever the fight is today.}}
:{{Text|Say|Evorian|My problem is not the fight, it's the leader.}}
:{{Text|Say|Evorian|[[Sabellian]] is quite full of himself.}}
:{{Text|Say|Evorian|[[Wrathion]] though is a refreshing change.}}
