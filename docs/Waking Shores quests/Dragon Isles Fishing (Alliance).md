==Completion==
Come to join the hunt? Um, I mean... the fish? The fishing hunt?

<Danielle adjusts her grip on her fishing rod with an awkward cough.>

You look like you know a thing or two about fishing, anyway. Here, let me show you how fishing works on these isles.

==Notes==
Despite the quest text, this does not actually teach Dragon Isles Fishing. Speak with Danielle again, open the trainer interface, and spend {{cost|100}} to learn the profession proper, which requires level {{level|df-min}} and Fishing (1).
