==Objectives==
Collect 5 Impressive Dragon Skulls from powerful [[dragon]]s and [[proto-dragon]]s in the [[Dragon Isles]].
* [[Impressive Dragon Skull]] (5)

==Description==
<[[Tarjin the Blind|Tarjin]] continues facing the distant island while he speaks to you.>

You think yourself worthy of the incredible legends and histories of the [[djaradin]]?

You, who are hardly the size of one of our weapons? Pfft.

I doubt you have the stomach to carry the legacy of my people.

Prove me wrong, if you can. Seek out dragons, the only worthy rival on these isles.

Bring me trophies of your victory over their strongest.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Tarjin's Next Tale|Unlocks a new djaradin legend to listen to.|id=388161|icon=ui_chat}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If you haven't the stomach to fight your precious [[dragonflight]]s, you may seek out the proto-dragons. They still give quite a fight.

==Completion==
<Tarjin tosses the skulls over his shoulder into the lava pit behind him.>

Impressive, for a weakling.

==Notes==
Players run across [[Tarjin the Blind]] while on the quest [[Wanted: Fenistrasza's Skull]] from the [[Dragonscale Basecamp]].

On approach:
:{{text|say|Tarjin the Blind|What weakling dares intrude on a lair of a mighty djaradin? Speak up!}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Tarjin the Blind|Seek out the strongest dragons. Fighting their weak will only make you weaker.}}

Many dragons and proto-dragons will drop an [[Impressive Dragon Skull]]. Collect five then return to Tarjin. The tales he tells are listed on his article.

On return:
:{{text|say|Tarjin the Blind|So, the outsider returns to beg for stories of their betters?}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Tarjin the Blind|You have proven yourself worthy to hear one of my tales.}}
