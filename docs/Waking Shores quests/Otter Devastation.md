*Scare off [[Pesky Ottuk]]s (10)

==Description==
Hey there, friend. These here [[ottuk]]s keep stealin' my catch!

Personally, I'd blow 'em up, but our [[Tuskarr]] friends don't seem too keen on that action. I made this here Ottuk Deterent Device MK-SH4RK, but... I aint a great swimmer.

You seem like you got the goods, why don't ya do us all a favor, activate the device, swimmy-swim around over there, and scare 'em off?

*{{Abilities|Restock Fish|id=386887|icon=achievement_profession_fishing_findfish}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
*1,150 [[XP]]
*[[Ominous Conch]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
You get rid of them pesky ottuks yet?

==Completion==
'Ey! Great job, buddy. Now let's chum these waters good!
