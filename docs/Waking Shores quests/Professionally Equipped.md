::*{{gossip|Do I look like a [[dragon]] to you?}}
::*{{Gossip|...What?}}

::::How do you prefer to do your work?

:::*{{gossip|I taste frequently as I work.}}
:::*:I do hope you work with foods...
:::*{{gossip|I wait until it comes to me.}}
:::*:Truly you embody the virtue of patience!
:::*{{gossip|I do whatever makes the most gold.}}
:::*:<She laughs uproaringly.> Me too! There is so much money to be made in professions!
:::*{{gossip|I close my eyes and magic happens.}}
:::*:You can craft with your eyes closed?! Color me impressed!
:::*{{gossip|Every touch is gentle and sensual. My creations must feel my warm caress.}}
:::*:How... sensitive of you. I do appreciate a healthy dose of caution.
:::*{{gossip|Every creation is unique. It depends on who and why I am crafting.}}
:::*:Indeed! Every garment must be tailored to fit each unique body, fit to their form and function!
:::*{{gossip|I hit it until it works. If it breaks, I hit it even harder.}}
:::*:<She laughs uproaringly.> Remind me not to let you near my equipment!
:::*{{gossip|Lots of calculations.}}
:::*:Measure twice, cut once I always say!
:::*{{gossip|Lots of experimentation.}}
:::*:I too enjoy trying new things. It is refreshing to experiment with your craft!
:::*{{gossip|I painstakingly collect everything useful across the land.}}
:::*:That sounds like a lot of work! But if you enjoy it, then I wish you great success on your journey.
:::*{{gossip|I gallop carefree around the mountains and hit the first thing that looks shiny.}}
:::*:<She laughs with delight.> That does sound entertaining!
:::*{{gossip|I run gleefully into forests with my eyes open.}}
:::*:<She laughs with delight.> That does sound entertaining!
:::*{{Gossip|I pull out my knife whenever something dies.}}
:::*:<Mahra nervously takes a small step backwards.>
:::*{{Gossip|Candles, incenses, and [[magic]] incantations.}}
:::*:That sounds delightful. I have never been good at magic, but I am always impressed by those who are.

:::::{{gossip|<Wait for Mahra to craft your equipment.>}}

:{{text|say|Mahra Treebender|Alright, here we go. This will only take a minute...}}
:{{text|say|Mahra Treebender|Now, be sure to inspect it afterward. This is not the kind of battle armor you are used to. An artisan's equipment is suited for the needs of crafters and gatherers.}}
:{{text|say|Mahra Treebender|That should do it! Take a look at your new equipment!}}
