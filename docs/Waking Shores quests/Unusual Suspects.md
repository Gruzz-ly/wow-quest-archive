'''Unusual Suspects''' starts one weekly lockout after completing [[It Belongs in a Museum... Eventually]], the Renown 24 chapter of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]] storyline.

==Objectives==
Scan [[Suspicious Explorer]]s to reveal the [[spy]].
* Scan Suspcious Dragonscale members to reveal the Spy {{co|47.1|80.5|Waking Shores}}
* [[Suspicious Persons Scanner]] (provided)

==Description==
[[File:Unusual Suspects.jpg|thumb|Surprise, it's Sarkareth!]]

<Name>, you're here. Good. Don't react, but our findings on the [[titan]] discs have just been stolen! Other than us, only the [[Sundered Flame]] know what we were up to in that facility.

I need ye to take this device and scan some of the suspicious members that have joined us recently. Reveal the spy and recover the data if you can. We cannae allow it to fall into their hands!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Tyr's Blessing]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Be quick and be casual. Got it?

==Completion==
They escaped? That's not good. The Sundered Flame have been one step ahead of us this whole time, and our one advantage has been lost!

Fortunately, I created a copy of these findings. I'm a betting gal, but even I've learned to hedge my bets.

==Notes==
[[Suspicious Explorer|Suspicious explorers]], [[Suspicious Researcher|researchers]], and [[Suspicious Artisan|artisans]] are all over basecamp. Use the provided [[Suspicious Persons Scanner]] on them.

*{{Text|say|Suspicious Artisan|Suspicious? If you think I'm suspicious, you should check that researcher just across the river. He gives me the jim-jams all over.}}
*{{Text|say|Suspicious Researcher|Hey, that tickles!}}
*{{Text|say|Suspicious Explorer|I didn't consent to this research study.}}
*{{Text|say|Suspicious Artisan|Can I help you with something?}}
*{{Text|say|Suspicious Explorer|Don't you have anything better to do?}}

At the north edge of camp is an [[Unusual Researcher|unusual researcher]]. Scan him:
:{{text|say|Unusual Researcher|Did you think I wouldn't return? How naive.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Take care of this one, and don't be long. We have work to do.}}
:''Two [[Sundered Shadetalon]]s drop out of stealth and attack!''

Fend them off, then return to Toddy.
