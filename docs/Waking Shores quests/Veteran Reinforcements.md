==Objectives==
Help the injured guards and find Sendrax.
*[[Injured Ruby Culler|Injured drakonids]] healed (4)
*Meet [[Sendrax]] at the [[Conservatory Outpost]]
*[[Rejuvenating Draught]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Commander Lethanak]] was insightful, as always. We will need the help of our most veteran guards to stop their threat. Rallying them was the perfect task for a young [[cadet]] like Sendrax, but she may need support.

Sendrax's path will take her towards the west, which may have been overwhelmed by this rising threat. They will need aid as well. Take this concoction and give them your support.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|59|75}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We are all in this together, <name>. The safety of [[Dragon Isles|the isles]] is at stake.

==Completion==
Sendrax stopped by and rushed through. That one is a whirlwind.

I like her.
