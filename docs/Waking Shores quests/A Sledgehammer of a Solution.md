==Objectives==
Slay Sogglmoggl, King of the [[Soggymaw]] and Whirglgurgl, King of the [[Windyfin]].
*[[Sogglmoggl]] slain
*[[Whirglgurgl]] slain

==Description==
While I'm glad [[Ecologist Tharu|Tharu]] now sees my point of view, I'm also grateful he had you rescue wildlife while I was dawdling.

The situation is much more dire than anticipated; he was right to take action. With what we've learned, I fear this [[elemental]] bombardment won't stop until we've dealt with the [[gorloc]]s.

If I were Tharu and thinking actionably, I would go straight for their leaders. Without anyone to rally around, the fighting should dissipate and no longer threaten the [[Restless Wetlands|wetlands]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Expedition Researcher's Binders
|Expedition Guard's Wristguards
|Expedition Mercenary's Wristwraps
|Field Scout's Bindings
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|97|48}}
* 7,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
This should buy us some room to breathe while we clean up this mess.

==Completion==
That ought to leave them scrambling--at least for a while.

Thank you for all your help, <name>.
