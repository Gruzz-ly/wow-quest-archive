==Objectives==
Recover the following items from the djaradin.
*[[Fallen Defender's Ring]] (8)
*[[Earth-Warder's Flame Blade]] (3)
*[[Horn of Scorxia]]

==Description==
The [[djaradin]] have no regard for the sanctity of [[Obsidian Citadel|the Citadel]] or the bodies of our kin! They break the bones of the dead and take their personal keepsakes as souvenirs.

This disrespect cuts at the heart of every proud [[black dragon]]. They deserve honor.

Recover these items that the djaradin have stripped from the bodies of our fallen.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 500 [[XP]]
* +2500 [[reputation]] with [[Sabellian (faction)|Sabellian]]
* +150 reputation with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*[[Primal Chaos]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supplies]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered the items of the fallen?

==Completion==
The memory of those who fell will not be lost. No thanks to the djaradin.

These items will be kept safe and we will remember the dead.

==Patch changes==
