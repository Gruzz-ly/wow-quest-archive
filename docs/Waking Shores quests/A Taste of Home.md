==Objectives==
Ask around members of the [[Horde]] at [[Dragonscale Basecamp]] to see if they can loan you the ingredients you need.
*[[Bilgewater-Imported Imitation Crab|Serving of Protein]]
*[[Fine Suramar Vintage|Emulsifying Liquid]]
*[[Charred Zandali Chilis|Serving of Vegetable Matter]]

==Description==
Oh, finally! Another [[dracthyr]] to lend a hand.

[[Talon Rommen|My brother]] and [[Talon Scaralesh|I]] have been trying to cook up some rations to eat, but...

<Scaralesh gestures to his surroundings.>

Everything is so different around here. It's hard to find the same ingredients we used to cook with.

But we can adapt. Go ask the Horde if they have anything we can substitute for vegetable matter, protein, and emulsifying fluid. Then we'll really have a meal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Any luck, <name>?

==Completion==
They don't look much like they did back home, but we dracthyr are resourceful. We'll give it a try.

Who knows, maybe it'll end up being even better.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Talon Scaralesh|It smells like the [[goblin]] chef in the main tent has some protein cooking.}}
:{{Text|say|Talon Scaralesh|There was a [[Ka'ro the Chopper|troll]] chopping some kind of strange plant, up by the flight master.}}
:{{Text|say|Talon Scaralesh|And those [[Nightborne|purple elves]] are always carrying bottles of liquid.}}

Speak to [[Sous-Chef Butterfingers]]:
:{{Gossip|Can you spare me a serving of protein?}}
:{{Text|say|Sous-Chef Butterfingers|Protein, huh? Don't tell anyone, but I got the good stuff: Imitation Crab!}}
:{{Text|say|Sous-Chef Butterfingers|Pure goblin ingenuity, the best [[Bilgewater Cartel|Bilgewater]] has to offer. I stashed some in that barrel.}}
:{{Text|say|Sous-Chef Butterfingers|Trust me, you don't want any real [[crab]]. Creepy-crawly bottom-feeders! Yuck!}}

Then interact with the [[Barrel of Assorted Seafood]] to loot [[Bilgewater-Imported Imitation Crab]].
:{{Text|say|Sous-Chef Butterfingers|Yeesh! Get outta here, you little rats with claws!}}
:''Three [[Escaped Meat Crab]]s flee from the barrel and the tent.''

Speak to [[Vintner Thesnala]]:
:{{Gossip|Can you spare any emulsifying liquid?}}
::Emulsifying liquid? Hm. Awfully reductive way to phrase it.

::Nevertheless, I can be of service. What are your tasting preferences?

::{{Gossip|I don't really care what it tastes like.}}
:{{Text|say|Vintner Thesnala|Fine then! Here! Just have your 'emulsifying liquid', without a care for its complexity!}}
:{{Text|say|Vintner Thesnala mutters under his breath.}}
::{{Gossip|Tasting preferences?}}
:::Yes, your tasting preferences! Your preferred flavor profile! Your palate!

:::There are so many factors that go into selecting a vintage--sharpness, viscosity, complexity, the list goes on. I could not begin to choose one without first understanding your needs.

:::{{Gossip|I think I understand.}}

::{{Gossip|Give me something sweet.}}
:::Sweet, yes. Your profile is starting to come together.

:::What notes do you prefer? Fruity, floral? Dry, velvety?

:::{{Gossip|Notes?}}
:::{{Gossip|Dry and velvety.}}
:{{Text|say|Vintner Thesnala|Aha, this is an excellent vintage for you. Buttery and crisp, it pairs well with shellfish.}}
:{{Text|say|Vintner Thesnala|Do enjoy it.}}
:::{{Gossip|Fruity and floral.}}
:{{Text|say|Vintner Thesnala|Here, the perfect dessert vintage! Bright and zesty, with an undertone of citrus.}}
:{{Text|say|Vintner Thesnala|Do enjoy it.}}

::{{Gossip|Give me something bitter.}}
:::Bitter, yes. Your profile is starting to come together.

:::What notes do you prefer? Rich, full-bodied? Delicate, spiced?
::::{{Gossip|Notes?}}
::::{{Gossip|Delicate and spiced.}}
:{{Text|say|Vintner Thesnala|This is quite the unique vintage, soft and a touch dry, with fresh herbal harmonies.}}
:{{Text|say|Vintner Thesnala|Do enjoy it.}}
::::{{Gossip|Rich and full-bodied.}}
:{{Text|say|Vintner Thesnala|Here, a robust vintage for a robust patron! A deep flavor, with notes of currant.}}
:{{Text|say|Vintner Thesnala|Do enjoy it.}}

Speak to [[Ka'ro the Chopper]]:
:{{Gossip|Can you spare any vegetable matter?}}
::{{Text|say|Ka'ro the Chopper|What's that? Ya say ya looking for... vegetable matter?}}
::{{Text|emote|Ka'ro chuckles.}}
::{{Text|say|Ka'ro the Chopper|Sure thing, dragon mon. I got some Zandali Chilis ya can take.}}
::{{Text|say|Ka'ro the Chopper|Better to char them by the fire, first. Give it a try.}}

Raw Zandali Chilis extra action button becomes available. Use it on the nearby Campfire, which places the [[Raw Zandali Chilis]] on the ground. The object then changes to the [[Charred Zandali Chilis]] appear.
:{{Text|say|Ka'ro the Chopper|There ya go, dragon mon. You'll be cooking like a Zandalari in no time.}}

;Upon completion
:''Scaralesh sets a campfire and prepares his dish. Butterfingers, Thesnala, and Ka'ro approach him.''
:{{Text|say|Talon Scaralesh|Alright, <name>. Let's see how this goes.}}
:{{Text|say|Talon Scaralesh|That smells pretty good, actually!}}
:{{Text|say|Sous-Chef Butterfingers|I'll say! When's it ready? I'm starving!}}
:{{Text|say|Vintner Thesnala|It has quite the complex aroma. I'm intrigued.}}
:{{Text|say|Ka'ro the Chopper|You did good, dragon mon. What do ya call this new dish?}}
:{{Text|say|Talon Scaralesh|Oh, hm. Just rations... but...}}
:{{Text|say|Talon Scaralesh|How about Spicy Wine-Braised Crab Rations?}}
:{{Text|say|Sous-Chef Butterfingers|Kinda wordy, if you ask me.}}
:{{Text|say|Vintner Thesnala|I propose you call it "[[:Scaralesh's Special]]"!}}
:{{Text|say|Ka'ro the Chopper|It's gonna be de next big thing, mark my words!}}
:{{Text|say|Talon Scaralesh|Thanks for your help, <name>. There's enough left over for you to have some, too.}}
