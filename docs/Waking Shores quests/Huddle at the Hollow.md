==Objectives==
Meet [[Keshki]] at [[Hornswog Hollow]].

==Description==
I've never seen [[Akora]] this upset. Usually she's as sunny as her flowers, but that legend means a lot to her. She talks about it all the time. Hm...

<Keshki fidgets with their glasses.>

I don't know a lot about plants, and I don't think [[frog]]s would cheer up anyone but me...

But north of here there's a quiet spot where I do my thinking: Hornswog Hollow. Maybe we can find something to cheer her up there? Or, uh, try to formulate a plan to help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 3,650 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
As much as I want to cheer up Akora, <name>, taking care of these poor frogs is a bigger priority.

For the [[red dragonflight]], preserving life always comes first!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Keshki|We'll be right back, Akora. I, uh... forgot something.}}
:''Keshki starts running away.''
:{{Text|whisper|Keshki|I'll meet you at Hornswog Hollow, <name>. It's just up this path, to the northeast.}}

;Upon approach
:{{Text|say|Keshki|Oh no... my hollow! My frogs!}}
:{{Text|say|Keshki|Cheering up Akora will have to wait, <name>. We've got a bigger problem on our hands!}}
