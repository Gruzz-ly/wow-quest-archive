==Progress==
I could relax here forever.

==Completion==
Huh, this is really interesting! I guess you never know where you'll find knowledge.

Keep an eye out for any treasures like this. Maybe there will be more wisdom to find in the world.

And thanks for seeing this vista with me. It's really spectacular, isn't it?

;Speaking with Thomas
:{{Gossip|quest=|Where do you go to get insight for your craft?}}
::An excellent question! Lately, I have been taking in the wonderful sights of these plains.

::When I explore the unknown and hidden paths, I sometimes find treasures of wisdom that inspire me to craft in ways I never thought of before.

::There is a marvelous vista nearby. I encourage you to venture out and see its beauty for yourself. Perhaps you too will find insight there.
