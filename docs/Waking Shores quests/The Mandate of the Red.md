==Description==
Our calling is care and compassion. We aid the other [[Dragonflight|flights]] not only for their own sake, but for the sake of [[dragonkin]]d as a whole.

==Progress==
The [[red dragonflight]] preserves the future of us all.

==Completion==
I hope you have grown to appreciate what we do.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Through their eyes, you may come to understand our calling.}}

Head clockwise around the upper level to find all the characters in question. First off is [[Xius]], with some tenders overseeing bronze eggs:
:Please do not distract me. I must focus.

:{{Gossip|quest=|What do you do here?}}
:{{Text|say|Xius|Each egg requires careful supervision to reach their full potential. We provide that care.}}

Further clockwise at nine o'clock is [[Akxall]] and a sapphire tender overseeing a couple blue eggs:
:It fills my heart with joy to be able to serve the dragons again.

:{{Gossip|quest=|Why are there so few eggs here?}}
:{{Text|say|Akxall|The [[blue dragonflight]] has endured terrible losses as of late. We must help them recover.}}

To the north is [[Mother Elion]], overseeing a pool with no eggs:
:Our pool remains empty... the eggs we once had, lost forever to time.
:And without whelps to continue our line, we have no future.

:{{Gossip|quest=|Why do you stay here, if you have no eggs to rear?}}
:{{Text|say|Mother Elion|Hope.}}

Finally, southeast at two o'clock is [[Zahkrana]], overseeing a large clutch of green eggs:
:The green flight defends nature and the Emerald Dream, while we protect living things and the future of dragonkind.

:{{Gossip|quest=|How do you care for these eggs?}}
:{{Text|say|Zahkrana|The water that feeds into the Ruby Lifeshrine flows from the wellspring beneath [[Tyrhold]]. These sacred waters nurture the eggs in our care.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Amella|What do you mean, 'the whelplings do not want to fly'? This should be second nature to them!}}

[[Amella]] offers the next quest, [[Training Wings]].
