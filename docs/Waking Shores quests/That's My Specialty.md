Excellent. If you ever have questions about specializations, you can always talk to me again.

Now go out and hone your talents! Oh, and take this with you. I found it on my travels.

There is something mysterious about it. Perhaps the knowledge contained within can further your specialization training.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Miguel
:{{Gossip|quest=|I'm ready to talk about specializations.}}
::Excellent. Being a unique professional is a gift, <name>. To be the best at one thing...

::It is a wonderful power, but also a responsibility: to your guild, to your customers, and to all of Azeroth. You must be true to your calling, fair in your business, and respectful in your trade.

::Will you keep the integrity of a skilled professional?

::{{Gossip|I will honor the virtues of my profession.}}
:::Very good. I knew I could trust you, <name>.

:::There are many ways to hone your craft in specialization. Sometimes you will gain insight from questing to help others, or discovering the wonders of the world, or even by accomplishing great feats and achievements.

:::One reliable way to practice your craft is to make something for the first time; this will always grant specialized knowledge. Another is to study the Draconic Treatises of your profession. Reading these treatises written by skilled scribes will surely lend insights.

:::Have you any further questions?

:::{{Gossip|Yes, I have a question.}}
::::Ask away!

::::{{Gossip|Nevermind.}}
::::{{Gossip|Do you know any good books I could read about my profession?}}
:::::Actually, yes! I have heard of special Draconic Treatises which teach lessons in crafting and gathering to help you hone your specializations.

:::::Do you know a skilled scribe? Perhaps they could write such a treatise.

:::::{{Gossip|Okay.}}
::::{{Gossip|Will I be able to master everything?}}
:::::Eventually, yes. If you spent great effort honing your craft, you would be able to fully master your trade. But most crafters are satisfied with honing one or two areas of expertise.

:::::Start by focusing on just the skills that interest you, and coordinate with other crafters and gatherers to get what you need from other specializations.

:::::Have you a guild? A community you trust is an excellent resource for working with others. One person might not know everything, but everything can be known by the community together.

:::::{{Gossip|Okay.}}
::::{{Gossip|How quickly can I specialize my profession?}}
:::::They say that a profession is easy to learn but difficult to master.

:::::At first, you will specialize very quickly, discovering new ways to hone your craft every day.

:::::But eventually, you will have to work much harder to find something new to learn. Don't give up, because you will ultimately be able to learn all there is to know about a specialization should you choose to do so.

:::::Yet, most crafters do not specialize so far. They pick one or two areas to hone. Just focus on the aspects of the profession that you truly enjoy.

:::::{{Gossip|Okay.}}
::::{{Gossip|When can I specialize in a profession?}}
:::::Eager to hone your craft, eh? Don't worry, you'll get there in no time.

:::::Just keep practicing. Especially if you try making new items, you'll start specializing soon.

:::::When you do make decisions about your specialization, remember that specializing is permanent. A specialization is not something you can re-learn on a whim.

:::::But fret not, even if you grow to regret a decision, you will always be able to learn more later.

:::::{{Gossip|Okay.}}
:::{{Gossip|No, I understand, thank you.}}

::{{Gossip|I make no promises.}}
:::<Miguel lets out a long sigh.>

:::Alright, alright, I get it. Just don't be rude to people, okay?

:::There are many ways to hone your craft in specialization. Sometimes you will gain insight from questing to help others, or discovering the wonders of the world, or even by accomplishing great feats and achievements.

:::One reliable way to practice your craft is to make something for the first time; this will always grant specialized knowledge. Another is to study the Draconic Treatises of your profession. Reading these treatises written by skilled scribes will surely lend insights.

:::Have you any further questions?

:::{{Gossip|Yes, I have a question.}}
:::{{Gossip|No, I understand, thank you.}}

::{{Gossip|If you insist...}}
::''Yields the same response as the I make no promises response.''

::{{Gossip|I promise, yada yada, now get to the good part.}}
::''Yields the same response as the I make no promises response.''
