==Objectives==
Dive through the rings and land in the target area.
*Hop on a Dragonriding Mount (Optional)
*Pass Through The Rings (5)
*Land in the Target Area
*[[Bronze Timepiece]] (provided)

==Description==
Now what if there is an obstacle in your way?

As long as you fly well, you can conserve your momentum and gain some height after a dive.

When you dive this time you will find your flight path takes you below the landing area. By using your momentum you can regain lost height at the end of the course to still land in the target area.

If you find yourself stuck, use the Bronze Timepiece and [[Celormu]] will reset you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 4,550 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Well done, <name>.

==Completion==
Well done. The rest is now a matter of practice.

==Notes==
