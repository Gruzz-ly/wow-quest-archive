==Objectives==
Meet [[Elementalist Taiyang]] in the [[Life Vault Ruins]].

==Description==
I knew joining the [[Dragonscale Expedition]] meant venturing into dangerous territory. But I was not expecting to fight off [[elemental]]s!

Our dig site at the Life Vault Ruins is in complete disarray! Stone monstrosities are rising up out of the ground! We called in an [[elementalist]] to consult, but I believe she will need all the help she can get.

Perhaps you can help her? Our camp is just across the river.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|57|40}}
*1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you for coming! The Expedition is in desperate need of your help!

==Notes==
