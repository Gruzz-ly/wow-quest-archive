==Objectives==
Deliver the Artisan's Consortium Invoice to [[Thomas Bright]].
*[[Artisan's Consortium Invoice]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Adventurer]], are you headed into the [[Ruby Lifeshrine|Lifeshrine]]?

Would you mind taking this invoice to [[Thomas Bright]]? He ordered a few custom-made bottles and our glassblower has finally returned with the price of materials required.

He should be just down the path there, likely gushing to some poor soul about how great [[Miguel Bright|his husband]] is...

I am sure he will pay you for your time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|5|61|80}}
*1,250 [[XP]]
*[[I.O.U.]]

==Completion==
Oh, excellent! I've been meaning to fetch this from Haephesta. Thanks, <name>.

==Progression==
{{Catching Up!}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
