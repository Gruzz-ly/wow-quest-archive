==Objectives==
Reform the damaged parts of the [[Obsidian Oathstone|Oathstone]].
*Fragments placed on forge
*Fragments repaired
*[[Reformed Oathstone Fragments|Reformed Pieces]] collected

==Description==
The forge is ready. All it needs now is flame.

Place the damaged [[Oathstone Fragment|Oathstone fragments]] upon the forge, and [[Wrathion]] shall provide the spark to ignite the process.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}

==Progress==
Have the fragments been reformed?

==Completion==
The damaged pieces of the Oathstone are repaired! This is only the beginning of what can be accomplished here!

With the forge re-ignited I can begin the process of crafting new weapons and armor to aid our efforts.

==Notes==
After placing the fragments on the forge, [[Stoker Volrax]] and [[Scalesmith Viro]] start working on it, as Wrathion breathes fire.
