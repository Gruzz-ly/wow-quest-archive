'''Unlocking Our Past''' is one of four variations of the [[Restored Obsidian Key]] repeatable turn-in quest. See [[Unlocking Our Past]] for other variants.

This iteration of the quest advances the progress on spawning [[Morchok]] and will not give [[Sabellian (faction)|Sabellian]], [[Wrathion (faction)|Wrathion]], or [[Valdrakken Accord]] reputation.

==Progress==
We must have the lost Obsidian Keys. The power they unlock is necessary to drive back the unbelievers.

==Completion==
This contribution shall ensure your place among [[Deathwing]]'s chosen few. Together we shall sweep across [[Azeroth|the world]] and announce the [[Hour of Twilight]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Twilight Cache]]
* {{cost|56|18|}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]
* Progress toward [[I'm Playing All Sides]]

==Notes==
