After her death, a [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|pre-rendered cinematic]] plays out, The Storm-Eater's Fury:
{{#ev:youtube|hK-edQ3tgPU}}

:''Somewhere above the [[Ruby Life Pools]], [[Alexstrasza]] lands roughly on a rocky outcrop and turns around to look up at [[Raszageth]], who lands not far away.''
:{{text|bossemote|Alexstrasza|Raszageth, enough! We need not fight another war! There is still time to see reason.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Raszageth|Time is precisely what you stole from me. Thousands of years, rotting in that prison!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Alexstrasza|I failed then to restore peace between us. Too many paid for that.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Raszageth|Spare me your sanctimony! You forced the titans' edicts upon us all. You betrayed the world that gave us life and when we dared resist you cast us out!}}
:''Raszageth takes flight, hovering over Alexstrasza...''
:{{text|bossemote|Raszageth|Never again!}}
:''...and DIVES in to attack. Alexstrasza quickly takes flight in an attempt to defend herself, but Raszageth is moving too quickly and wraps herself around Alexstrasza before grabbing the red's forearms in her own. Raszageth bites Alexstrasza's neck as the two continue to fall out of the sky. Another bite, then Alexstrasza breaks free for a moment, before Raszageth again bites, but this time with lightning! Alexstrasza manages to punch Raszageth away and the two hover for a moment staring at each other before Alexstrasza unleashes her fire, forcing Raszageth to retreat before circling around for another attack.''
:''Raszageth again attempts to bite on Alexstrasza's neck, but the red dragon evades the attack, quickly gains altitude, then dives to attack Raszageth. This time Alexstrasza goes for the neck bite attack and connects as the two dragons tumble end over end. They fall for a few seconds more, but Raszageth manages to punch free with her hind legs. Alexstrasza takes a bit to regain control as Raszageth looks down from on high.''
:{{text|bossemote|Raszageth|Your false reign must end!}}
:''Raszageth arches her neck upward and calls down a bolt of lightning that BLASTS Alexstrasza out of the sky. Stunned from the shock, Alexstrasza falls upside down back-first towards the ground, but lands with a splash in a pond. Still dazed, Alexstrasza weakly opens her eyes as Raszageth dives once more to land the killing blow. However, she fails to notice a black dragon swooping in behind her.''
:{{text|bossemote|Alexstrasza|(thinking) Wrathion?}}
:''Swooping in from behind, [[Wrathion]] lands a body blow on Raszageth, interrupting her dive. She resumes her hover as Wrathion dives down toward Alexstrasza.''
:{{text|bossemote|Raszageth|Ah... You are bold, whelpling. But you are fighting on the wrong side! She never told you the suffering they inflicted upon us. The insult of being forgotten! I want her to watch helplessly as everything she built comes crumbling down.}}
:''Raszageth takes off.''
:{{text|bossemote|Raszageth|Only then will she meet a fitting end!}}
