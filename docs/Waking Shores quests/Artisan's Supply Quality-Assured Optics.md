Deliver a pair of Quality-Assured Optics to [[Haephesta]] at the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]].
*[[Quality-Assured Optics]]

==Description==
Ah, an engineer! Excellent timing.

I've got some schematics to fix, but some tall lady came by asking for a set of optics.

You know how to make those, right?

Take 'em to the Ruby Lifeshrine when you have 'em crafted. I think she said she was with the [[Artisan's Consortium]] or something.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|30|50}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Artisan's Consortium - Dragon Isles Branch]]
