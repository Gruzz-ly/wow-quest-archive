==Objectives==
Speak to whelptenders at the gardens of the [[Ruby Life Pools]].
*Speak to whelptenders (5)

==Description==
Our egg-tenders report a new clutch of eggs is soon to hatch. Ordinarily, a whelptender would take each [[Dragon whelp|newly hatched dragon]] and raise them with [[Dragonflight|their flight]]. However, not all [[dragonspawn]] are called to the life of a whelptender, and we are short of hands.

Gather wisdom from whelptenders of each flight in the gardens below [[Ruby Lifeshrine|the Lifeshrine]]. [[Agapanthus]], an experienced whelptender of the [[Blue dragonflight|blue flight]], has offered his services as head of the [[Little Scales Daycare]]. But he will need your assistance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Whelptenders of the [[Red dragonflight|red flight]] study the methods of each flight to provide the best all-around care. It makes sense that you are studying those methods, too.

==Completion==
[[Amella]] said to meet you. I have been assigned to help Agapanthus with the daycare.

==Notes==
;Speaking with the [[Azure Whelptender]]
:Please do not disturb [[Loszigosa]]. We just managed to calm down after an [[arcane]] anomaly.

:May I help you with something?

:{{Gossip|quest=|Do you have any wisdom for raising whelps?}}
:{{Text|say|Azure Whelptender|Wisdom from a whelptender? Hmm, let me think...}}
:{{Text|say|Azure Whelptender|Sometimes there are difficult lessons. That does not mean all lessons must be difficult ones. Have fun!}}

;Speaking with the [[Bronze Whelptender]]
:Do not worry. [[Bronze Whelpling|He]] has heard this story a thousand times. He is not missing anything by napping.

:As it is, he will ask for this story again before turning in...

:{{Gossip|quest=|Do you have any wisdom for raising whelps?}}
:{{Text|say|Bronze Whelptender|Bronze whelptenders often find ourselves pulled in many different directions at times.}}
:{{Text|say|Bronze Whelptender|Our greatest tool? Patience. Our journeys are not linear. How can we expect theirs to be?}}

;Speaking with the [[Emerald Whelptender]]
:[[Emerald Whelpling|He]] was just saying he was hungry, but now he's completely asleep!

:I suppose this gives me time to revise my poetry...

:{{Gossip|quest=|Do you have any wisdom for raising whelps?}}
:{{Text|say|Emerald Whelptender|Spending time in [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]] is important to their growth, but [[green whelp]]s ought not stay there too long.}}
:{{Text|say|Emerald Whelptender|Being part of the waking world is sometimes hard for whelps. We must be their encouraging guides.}}

;Speaking with the [[Obsidian Whelptender]]
:[[Khelti]] has taken a... shine... to these goblets. They insist we take one home, but I have reminded them that these belong here.

:Luckily the ones at home are identical.

:{{Gossip|quest=|Do you have any wisdom for raising whelps?}}
:{{Text|say|Obsidian Whelptender|Each whelp is incredibly precious to their flight. We must protect them from all dangers.}}
:{{Text|say|Obsidian Whelptender|But supporting them in all things, no matter what... that is the calling of a whelptender.}}

;Speaking with the [[Ruby Whelptender]]
:[[Ruby Whelpling|This one]] loves to watch the wildlife here. She asked if her visage could be a [[peafowl]]!

:{{Gossip|quest=|Do you have any wisdom for raising whelps?}}
:{{Text|say|Ruby Whelptender|Never underestimate the power of an appropriate snack.}}
:{{Text|say|Ruby Whelptender|Sweets are enjoyable, but you never know when a dramatic sugar crash is around the corner.}}

;Approaching Lasztak
:''Lasztak is speaking to a Bronze Whelpling.''
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|Are you ready to meet Agapanthus?}}
