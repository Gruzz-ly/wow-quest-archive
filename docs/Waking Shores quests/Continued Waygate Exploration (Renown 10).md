'''Continued Waygate Exploration''' becomes available at Renown level 10 with the [[Dragonscale Expedition]]. This is a [[breadcrumb quest]] that directs you back to [[Rubyscale Outpost]], where you can unlock a fourth [[Ancient Waygate]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Thaelin Darkanvil]] at the [[Rubyscale Outpost]] in the [[Waking Shores]].

==Description==
<The explorer-in-training hands you a taught, rolled note. Upon investigating, it appears to be from an old friend, Thaelin Darkanvil, seeking your aid.

Before scurrying off, the critter extends its hand as if it were seeking a treat. Moments later, a loud screech rings out as the curious creature storms off empty handed.>

Ah, my favorite friend returns fer a new adventure!

Oh, that's between us just so ye know. Wouldn't want the others tae think they aren't my favorite too!
