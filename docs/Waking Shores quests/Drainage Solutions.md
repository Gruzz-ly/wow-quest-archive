==Objectives==
Siphon 8 Glittery Streams in the cave east of the [[Life Vault Ruins]].
*[[Glittery Stream]]s siphoned (8)
*[[Zikkori's Water Siphoning Device]] (provided)

==Description==
Want the honor of assisting world-renowned Head Geologist of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]]? That's right. I'm exactly who you think I am. And I'm in a bind!

I was perusing this river for new sedimentary samples, but then the water started to walk away with the most interesting pieces of silt!

I have here my patented water entrapment device, but it's in desperate need of someone to march around and siphon those [[elemental]]s into it.

Think you're up to the task?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 7,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
What is it, Two-Legs? Have you siphoned off enough of that silt yet?

==Completion==
Yes, that's it! That's the composition I was looking for! Thank you! Finally, someone knows when to listen to me.

Do me a favor and don't mention this to anyone back at [[Expedition Basecamp|basecamp]], got it? My thesis is still in progress, and I'm supposed to be writing about volcanic sedimentary sources. I'm sure you can understand, yeah?
