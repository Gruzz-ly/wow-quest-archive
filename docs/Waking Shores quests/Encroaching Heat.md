==Objectives==
Take the [[Half-Boiled Fish]] to [[Elder Unujaak]].

==Description==
<This fish has clearly been dead for some time.

Upon closer inspection, you notice that it appears to have been boiled--probably while still alive in the river.

Unujaak back at the village might be interested in this.>

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Recipe: Timely Demise
|Recipe: Seamoth Surprise
|Recipe: Salt-Baked Fishcake
|Recipe: Filet of Fangs
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Oacha'noa]] preserve us! How my heart aches to see the river disturbed in this way. 

This must be yet another of the [[djaradin]]'s atrocities. Their fiery magic has been heating the river beyond anything these poor creatures can endure.

But it would be disrespectful to allow this one to go to waste. Go on, throw it in the pot. We will use it for tonight's meal.
