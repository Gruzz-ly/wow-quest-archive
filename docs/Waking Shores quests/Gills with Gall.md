==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Gurblbrblr the Invader.png|Gurblbrblr the Invader|Gorlocs of obnoxious size? This one definitely exists.}}
Kill Gurblbrblr the Invader in [[Cliffdrip Camp]].
*[[Gurblbrblr the Invader]] slain

==Description==
[[Crabtender Kad'irsza|Kad'irsza]] is reckless, but she knows her [[crab]]s. The [[gorloc]]s have gone too far!

I noticed the gorlocs going to Gurblbrblr for everything. Notably, he is instructing them to take crabs prisoner. We cannot allow this to continue, for the balance of life, and for the safety of those who tend it.

Defeat Gurblbrblr. Remove their means of expanding beyond this river!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Do not permit the gorlocs to encroach on the wildlife!

==Completion==
Good. Now the gorlocs will lack the wherewithal to shackle more of these crabs.

... And you have done more than just protect the crabs, <name>. You have protected Kad'irsza as well. I thank you.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Ru'kroszk|Hold still, Kad'irsza! If you are going to be foolish enough to rush into a gorloc camp, at least allow me to mend your wounds!}}
:{{Text|say|Crabtender Kad'irsza|I had to rescue the crabs, Ru! It is my fault they are in danger!}}
