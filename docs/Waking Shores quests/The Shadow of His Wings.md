'''The Shadow of His Wings''' concludes the self-named chapter of the [[Sojourner of the Waking Shores]] side-storyline.

==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Cygenoth.jpg|Cygenoth|Self-appointed Voice of Neltharion and leader of the Worldbreakers.}}
Confront Cygenoth, Voice of Neltharion.
*[[Cygenoth]] the Corrupted confronted {{co|35.0|45.5|Waking Shores}}
*Cygenoth the Corrupted slain

==Description==
The Voice of Neltharion resides below, spreading lies amongst his followers.

He appears to be [[dragonspawn]] like me.{{sic}} but his [[Draconic]] is clumsy--fit for the unscaled.

I suspect duplicity: an illusion, perhaps. If we can subdue him, I'm certain the truth will out.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Neltharian Channeler's Rod
|Obsidian Watcher's Crossbow
|Obsidian Guardian's Cleaver
|Obsidian Spellsplitter
|Doomsayer's Greatsword
|Blacktalon Claw
|Blacktalon Blade
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 11,350 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
We quenched the last embers of the [[Twilight's Hammer]] today. But the [[Worldbreakers]] are another matter--these scaleborn will find new explanations for their misfortune, new myths, and new leaders.

My kin and I will watch over them. Should another Voice rise, we will intervene.

You've done a good thing this day.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|[[Ingot]]|You mean the Voice of Neltharion is... lying?}}
:{{Text|say|Ayasanth|Most certainly. And if we can reveal his falsehoods to your kin, perhaps the Worldbreakers will change their ways.}}

Ingot and Ayasanth will follow along. Enter the cave to the west, which is in a special phase for this quest:
:{{Text|say|Ingot|What is a "death wing" anyways?}}
:{{Text|say|Ayasanth|A terrible tragedy and a distant memory. You will understand when you've shed.}}
:{{Text|emote|Ingot nods blankly.}}

Approach Cynegoth:
:{{Text|say|Ayasanth|Cygenoth is just up ahead. Take care, champion.}}
:{{Text|yell|Cygenoth|Worldbreakers, beware! The outsider returns with reinforcements! They seek to corrupt our young!}}
:''Ayasanth runs toward Cygenoth, confronting him.''
:{{Text|say|Cygenoth|The Earthwarder will not stand for this. Witness the powers he has gifted me!}}
:{{Text|say|Ayasanth|Enough of this charade, Cygenoth. [[Deathwing]] is dead, and no [[cult]] can--}}
:{{Text|yell|Cygenoth|Silence!}}
:''Cygenoth binds Ayasanth with Void Tendrils.''

Mid-fight, Cygenoth sheds his disguise and reveals himself to be an ogre!
:{{Text|yell|Cygenoth|Bah--this illusion stifles my power! Die, meddlers!}}

At 15%:
:{{Text|yell|Cygenoth|The Twilight's Hammer did not die with [[Cho'gall]], and it will not die with me!}}

Kill Cygenoth:
:{{Text|say|Cygenoth|More... will rise...}}
:{{Text|say|Ayasanth|So he was Twilight's Hammer all along. One of the last.}}
:''Several Worldbreaker Initiates approach.''
:{{Text|say|[[Worldbreaker Initiate]]|The Voice was unscaled!}}
:{{Text|say|Worldbreaker Initiate|We have been deceived!}}
:{{Text|say|Worldbreaker Initiate|Earth-Warder forgive us...}}
:{{Text|say|Ingot|All is well, friends! The outsiders are here to help us!}}
:{{Text|say|Ayasanth|Though we seem to have done as much harm as good.}}
:{{Text|say|Ayasanth|Champion, meet us on the ridge. Hopefully the survivors will let us pass without issue.}}

The previously hostile dragonkin outside turn neutral.

Completing the quest also awards the "Shadow of His Wing" criterion of [[Sojourner of the Waking Shores]]. Additionally, a new weekly quest, [[Same as the Old Boss]], is available on the surface near [[Igys the Believer]].
