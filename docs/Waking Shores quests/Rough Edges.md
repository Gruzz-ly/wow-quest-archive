==Objectives==
Find [[Alexstrasza]] and check on her.

==Description==
I apologize for not meeting you in person, <name>, but this method seemed most timely.

Our [[war against the Primalists]] has always troubled our queen, but recently she has grown increasingly upset. Something weighs on her. I know how heavy the burdens of the mind can become.

She left [[Valdrakken]] some time ago, saying she needed to find a quiet place to think, but... I am concerned.

Please--seek her out, and make sure she is all right. She does not need to know I sent you.

==Completion==
It grieves me to see [[Vyranoth]] in such a dark place, but I still have hope that we will stand together as we once did.

I have warned her about [[Iridikron]]. That is all I can do.

The rest is up to her.

==Notes==
Get to the [[Concord Observatory]] and speak with Alexstrasza:
:Ah, <name>. I assume Nozdormu sent you. Little can ever be hidden from him.

:I am all right, but... a bit shaken.

:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|How could you say that? After everything--}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|You were my dearest friend! And losing you to this conflict broke my heart.}}
:''Alextrasza reaches out to Vyranoth, but the Iceheart slaps her hand away.''
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|You promised me you would not force the Titans' will upon us.}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|But the eggs, Alexstrasza.}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|You did nothing while your masters warped our children still in the shell!}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|That abhorrent act should never have happened and I regret my part in it every day.}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|Your lies have grown sweeter. Honey to hear and poison to taste.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Vyranoth... you have always fought for the good of dragonkind. But [[Iridikron]] does not. Vengeance is all he craves.}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|Still so naive, Alexstrasza. Believing that the world we once shared still exists.}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|It is gone.}}
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|And so, yes. All that remains... is vengeance.}}
:''Vyranoth walks away.''
