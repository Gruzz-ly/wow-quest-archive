==Objectives==
Kill 15 primal elementals in [[Wingrest Embassy]].
*Primal [[elemental]]s slain (15)

==Description==
The crafters, artisans, and explorers of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]] are ill-suited to the vigors of battle.

But not you and I, <name>.

Here in the [[Dragon Isles]], let us use that strength to protect those who can't protect themselves.

Clear out the elementals encroaching from the north, so that the expedition can focus on their noble pursuits.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
These elementals are unlike any I've seen before...

==Completion==
For the Dragonscale Expedition!

<Warlord Grimaxe salutes you.>
