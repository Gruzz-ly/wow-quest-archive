==Objectives==
Dissect the [[gorloc]] corpses.
*[[Soggymaw Gorloc Corpse]] Dissected
*[[Windyfin Gorloc Corpse]] Dissected
*[[Viscera-Covered Shells|Glistening Shells]] Examined

==Description==
I'm at my wits end, <name>. [[Ecologist Tharu|Tharu]] and I have made our way through nearly all the corpses only to stumble at the end because we cannot agree on a methodology. If only he would just listen to me!

<Ecologist Iskha sighs.>

The stress of the situation is getting to us both. I don't even have a firm hypothesis yet.

You look like you have a strong stomach. Will you take over on these last two [[gorloc]]s? You can borrow my scalpel.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|97|48}}
* 7,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Don't worry, you'll get used to the smell after a while.

==Completion==
It's the gorlocs fighting that's been harming the [[Restless Wetlands|wetlands]] so?

<[[Ecologist Iskha]] looks ashamed.>

I think I understand now...

==Notes==
;Dissecting the Windyfin corpse
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Iskha|Curious... its bones are hollow. Wind-infused?}}
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Tharu|Hmph, maybe? But that bloating... It surely drowned.}}

;Dissecting the Soggymaw corpse
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Tharu|Enlarged swim bladders, hm? Water [[magic]]?}}
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Iskha|Yeah, but look at the lungs... It clearly suffocated.}}
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Iskha|Wind and water gorlocs, fighting one another...}}
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Tharu|Pah! What nonsense are they bickering over?}}

;Examining the shells
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Tharu|Are those shells? [[Elemental]] magic shells?}}
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Tharu|You were right. There's a lot more to this!}}
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Iskha|Their elemental bickering must be spilling out over the wetlands!}}

==Progression==
{{Save the Hippos!}}
