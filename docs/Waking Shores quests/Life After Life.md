==Objectives==
Collect an Inert Vessel from [[Trellain]] in the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]].
*[[Inert Vessel]]

==Description==
I could sense that his friend bore a deep scar. Something in this place reopened it--perhaps so that it could heal cleanly this time.

Now it is [[Kolgar Flameguard|Kolgar]]'s time to heal.

In the terrace above us, you will find my friend Trellain working with the [[enchanter]]s. Tell him that I require one of the vessels he uses in his work. He will give it to you freely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 7,250 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +125 reputation with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find Trellain?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. This will be suitable.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|They say it's... dishonorable to die in your sleep. That it's cowardice for an [[orc]] to not face down death.}}
:{{Text|say|Bathoras|And do you believe the same thing?}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|I don't know. Maybe he did. Maybe he thought that any death other than rotting away like this would have been too good for him.}}
:{{Text|say|Bathoras|We must all let go eventually. But letting go is not the same as ceasing.}}

;Speaking with Trellain
:{{Gossip|Bathoras asked me to get a vessel from you.}}
:{{Text|say|Trellain|Here you are, <name>. Be careful, they're fragile when hollow. Make sure Bathoras uses it well, will you?}}

;On return to Bathoras and Kolgar
:{{Text|say|Bathoras|Is this something you would like me to do for you?}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|...Yes. He wanted to be forgotten. But if I can keep him just with me, that... will be close enough.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Bathoras|Little one, please come over here.}}
:''The [[Ruby Whelpling]] sleeping on [[Duroz Scaletaker|Duroz]]'s body moves to Bathoras. He starts casting a spell on Duroz's body.''
:{{Text|say|Bathoras|It is done. The vessel is now filled and is yours to take with you.}}
:''Kolgar takes the vessel to his hand.''
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|Is it... him?}}
:{{Text|say|Bathoras|I'm sorry, but no. This was once his portion of the power that infuses all living things. We borrow it for a time, and then it is no longer ours. Yet it does remain.}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|I... see. He would not have believed he deserved this kindness from the [[dragon]]s.}}
:{{Text|say|Bathoras|One cannot deserve dignity. It is the right of all life.}}
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|I will not forget this, Bathoras. Or you, <name>.}}
:''Bathoras returns to his regular spot.''
:{{Text|say|Kolgar Flameguard|For now, I... need time to think.}}
:''Kolgar picks up Duroz's axe and goes back to the inn. He is followed by the whelpling.''
