==Objectives==
Collect 1 piece of Extra-Delicious Riverbeast Meat.
*[[Extra-Delicious Riverbeast Meat]]

==Description==
So, I have, uh, more homework... Professor [[Tyrgon]]'s lessons are super tough! He wants us to find out what proto-whelps, uh, eat! Yeah...

I already know the answer! It's [[riverbeast]] meat!

Can you bring me a piece of riverbeast meat? Some riverbeast meat would be a great "visual aid" for my project.

But it has to be a REALLY good piece, ok? Like... the ones from [[Pudgy Riverbeast]]s. One like a momma [[proto-drake]] would give their whelp to make them strong because, uh, it will make Mister Tyrgon happy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*9,800 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Mom says food makes everyone happy.

Maybe it will be friends with me then...

I mean, we'll all be friends! And Professor Tyrgon won't give me a bad grade if I make Riverbeast meat part of my project!

==Completion==
Oh, wow! That's the most delicious-looking meat I've EVER seen! My project will get the BEST grade. The proto-whelp will definitely want this!

<Iyali's expression is suddenly filled with concern.>

Oh no!

I mean, uh, everyone will lwant{{sic}} to copy me... for the project!

<Iyali smiles unconvincingly.>
