==Objectives==
Return to [[Jyhanna]] at the [[Little Scales Daycare|Whelp Daycare]] in [[Valdrakken]].

==Description==
You've done well, <name>. [[:Lubbins]] is doing much better and is in excellent spirits. 

Jyhanna will want to know, so go back and give her the good news!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Ultimate Battle-Training Stone]]
*[[Mister Toots]]
*[[Lovin' Lubbins]]

==Completion==
I am so glad you were able to help Lubbins. 

Perhaps you can help another animal I rescued. His name is Mister Toots. He is extremely sweet, and I think you two would get along.

What do you say? Do you think you can handle another pet?
