==Objectives==
Locate [[Warpcaster Delandra]] at [[Camp Antonidas]] in The [[Azure Span]].

==Description==
Ancient symbols aren't really me thing. However...

<Thaelin searches through his belongings, eventually pulling out a map. At the top of the parchment appears the name Antonidas, scribbled in large, sloppy letters.>

Ah hah! Here it is!

Bit of a trek, but a few of those old magic users can be found... here. 

<Pointing to a spot on the map.>

Maybe they have somethin' tae offer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well traveled, I see. These symbols you speak of are quite mysterious, as well as old.

Since you seem interested enough to travel all the way out here to find me, the least I can do is offer some guidance.

==Progression==
{{Dormant Discovery}}
