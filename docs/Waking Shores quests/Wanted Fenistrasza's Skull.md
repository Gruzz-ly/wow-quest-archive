==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Tarjin the Blind.png|[[Tarjin the Blind]]|A reclusive djaradin keeps the enchanted skull on display in his alcove.}}
Find Fenistrasza's Skull.
*[[Fenistrasza's Skull]] {{co|16.3|62.9|Waking Shores}}
*Return to [[Cataloger Jakes]] in the [[Dragonscale Basecamp]].

==Description==
<The posted sign is written in beautiful calligraphy.>

The archivists humbly request that all expedition members seek out Fenistrasza's Skull for our artifact archives.

If acquired, please deliver to Cataloger Jakes for processing and compensation.

Some [[Dragonscale Expedition|expedition members]] have reported seeing it in the possession of an outcast [[djaradin]] in the western mountains, but no one has been unable to convince him to part with it yet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Equipment]]
*[[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with the [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Do you have something for the archives?

==Completion==
<Cataloger Jakes frantically tries to prevent the magma pouring out of the skull's eye sockets from burning her other documents.>

Okay, now I KNOW the archivists are putting out these requests just to annoy me!

Nevertheless, I'll ensure this is properly documented, researched, and archived for the expedition.

==Notes==
At the [[Outcast's Alcove]], west of the [[Obsidian Citadel]], [[Tarjin the Blind]] is staring at a distant island. Additionally, [[Fenistrasza's Skull]] is on the ground near him. Approach it:
:{{text|say|Tarjin the Blind|Hands off Fenistrasza's skull, outsider. I don't even know you.}}

You must have completed his weekly quest, [[Tarjin's Tales]], at least once to be able to interact with the skull.
:{{text|say|Tarjin the Blind|Go, take the skull to your easily impressed commanders. Tell them of the mighty djaradin who slew the dragon it once belonged to!}}
