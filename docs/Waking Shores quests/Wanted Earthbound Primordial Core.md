Find the Earthbound Primordial Core in Neltharus.
*[[Earthbound Primordial Core]]

==Description==
<The posted sign is written in beautiful calligraphy.>

The archivists humbly request that all expedition members seek out the Earthbound Primordial Core for our artifact archives.

If acquired, please deliver to Cataloger Jakes for processing and compensation.

Recent learnings from records recovered from the Obsidian Citadel indicate it may have once been stored in the Dragon's Hoard of Neltharus, although it's current location is unclear.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 [[reputation]] with the [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Do you have something for the archives?

==Completion==
I can tell this one's going to be a troublemaker... I'll get the magically sealed containers Naleidea enchanted for problem cases.

Don't worry, I'll ensure this is properly documented, researched, and archived for the expedition.

==Patch changes==
