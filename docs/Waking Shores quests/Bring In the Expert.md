==Objectives==
Collect 5 Sunflight Flowers.
*[[Sunlight Flower]]s collected (5)

==Description==
Did [[Iyali]] say how long this creature has been suffering? If it's too injured to eat, we need to treat it quickly.

Normally a [[Dragonscale Expedition]] camp would have everything I need to help this whelp, but getting supplies to the "frontier" here on the [[Dragon Isles]] has proven tricky. There have been significant delays in our supply routes.

But, fear not. The land itself will provide! If you bring me Sunflight Flowers, I can craft a soothing balm that will calm the drake so I can heal it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 7,250 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Sunlight Flowers are very useful resource.

Their petals and stalks have sedative properties which will ease the whelp's suffering while we heal it.

==Completion==
Terrific, <name>.

I hope these kids were able to learn something from you.

Where did they get the idea we wouldn't help them? Helping wildlife is part of our mission. Maybe our pedagogy needs a review...
