==Objectives==
Obtain Building Materials from the local [[Earth elemental|Earth Elementals]].
*[[Building Materials]] (10)

==Description==
Greetings [[Adventurer]]! Say, you look like a capable person, could you give me a hand?

[[Caretaker Azkra|Azkra]] and I are charged with watching over this tower, which is in what I like to call "an exciting state of pre-renovation." My problem is as we started repairs, the local Earth Elementals attacked us!

So I thought "Zefren, why not take care of the Earth Elementals, and get some at the same time?" Which is where you come in! Could you help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|97|48}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
I have to say, I'm quite looking forward to being able to work on this tower once again, I might even put in a little plaque commemorating your help! You are still planning to help, right?

==Completion==
Oh bother, these are quite a bit more crumbly than I was expecting. They look quite a lot more solid when they are launched at your head!

Well. I'm sure I can use these for building regardless, thank you for your help!

Maybe there are some mud elementals around here somewhere I can use to glue it together....
