==Objectives==
Test the skills of 8 [[Blacktalon Assassin]]s and [[Blacktalon Avenger|Avengers]].
*[[Blacktalon]] tested (8)

==Description==
For years I have fostered the Blacktalon, teaching and encouraging them to pursue the same heights you have reached.

They may not have achieved the same lofty goals as yourself, but they are accomplished in their own right. They've made me proud.

Each would be honored if you test their skills. I think you will see some of yourself in them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Have you tested them and found them worthy?

==Completion==
I believe the Blacktalon are prepared for anything.
