==Objectives==
Activate the Earthen Ward.
*[[Earthen Ward]] activated

==Description==
I have empowered a ward using the rings you collected. It has gathered the very stones of the earth around it and created a [[Living Earth Ward|Living Earthen defender]] to protect this territory.

Test the Earthen Ward to ensure it's functional.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

{{itembox||q1=10|Earthen Charm

==Progress==
Was the test successful?

==Completion==
Thank you for your aid, <name>. I will place more of these wards throughout the area to combat the [[djaradin]] and the [[elemental]]s. Use these charms to activate them when you need assistance.
