==Objectives==
Speak with [[Meliane Enorath]] at the [[Life Vault Ruins]] in the [[Waking Shores]].

==Description==
What could be better than a meal you can carry while you explore?

Street foods are the essence of busy cities this great world over. But not every meal is set for mobility. The core of great on-the-go cuisines is a starch that will hold strong while moving. Breads, potatoes, rices, and beyond are the heart of hand-sized dining.

I would like to treat my [[Pandaren]] peer here to a flavorful specimen known as [[Leapmaize]]. [[Chef Morsel|Morsel]] introduced it to me when we first met near a [[titan]] ruins in the Waking Shores.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|2|25}}
* 2,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Great, you're finally here. I need a dozen more cushions, three tapestries, a scrollshelf, a few more of those enchanted brooms, and...

Wait. You're not with [[Dragonscale Expedition|the Expedition]]. What do you want?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Chef Sungshin Ironpaw|Have you ever discussed setting up a row of carts to sell food and entertain your patrons?}}
:{{Text|say|Rumiastrasza|What a wondrous idea! Where do you imagine we can find carts big enough for those of my kin who wish to cook in their [[dragon]] forms?}}
:{{Text|say|Chef Sungshin Ironpaw|Hmm... We've never built a cart to fit a dragon before, but I'm sure [[Master Brownstone]] and his crew would enjoy being the first to do so!}}

==Progression==
