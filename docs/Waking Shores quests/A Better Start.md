==Objectives==
Plant seeds in 6 Fertile Soil patches and allow them to mature.
*Seeds matured (6)

==Description==
[[Vaeros]] is diligent, but [[Dragon whelp|whelps]] have a way of finding trouble. Not mine, of course--but I suppose not every [[dragon]] rears their clutch to understand the gravity of their station.

While I am loathe{{sic}} to encourage outdoor play over study, I will help you safeguard the garden more effectively. Take these seeds and plant them nearby. When mature, the blooms produce a fragrance that insects find disagreeable.

The gardeners can help you--and maybe my bronze brethren, if you mind your manners.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Life Pools Watering Can
|Life Pool Herb Pouch
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 7,250 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Do remember to be courteous to our bronze companions, lest they toss you into a [[timeline]] without luxurious stationery and herbal tea.

<[[Adazius]] sighs wistfully.>

What a terrible existence that would be.

==Completion==
I am rather surprised you did not earn more than a scathing reproach from [[Veladormi]]. She must be feeling generous today.

I suspect the insect problem is now solved. You are welcome.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Lasztak]]|Please come down. Most of the [[bee]]s are gone now! Look, I have your favorite--candied skitterflies!}}
:{{Text|say|Adazius|You do realize the whelplings will hide in the trees on purpose once you begin bribing them with sweets, yes?}}
:{{Text|say|Vaeros|Come now, Adazius. The little ones deserve a treat after the stress they have been through. Maybe yours would enjoy a snack as well?}}
:{{Text|say|Adazius|Certainly not. They are busy enjoying their books on advanced draconic poetics like proper young dragons.}}
:{{Text|emote|Vaeros sighs quietly.}}

Click on [[Fertile Soil (Waking Shores)|Fertile Soils]]. The nearby [[Lifetending Gardener]]s ask for help:
*{{Text|say|Lifetending Gardener|Excuse us, friend, but could you donate a bit of your power to a good cause?}}
*{{Text|say|Lifewarding Gardener|Most esteemed dragon, might we borrow you briefly?}}
*{{Text|say|Lifetending Gardener|If you have time to spare, dear dragon, we could use your aid.}}
*{{Text|say|Lifewarding Gardener|Our bronze friend, could you lend us a hand with this sapling's growth?}}
*{{Text|say|Lifewarding Gardener|Your timelessness, would you mind helping speed things along?}}

And the nearby [[bronze dragon]]s response and act accordingly:
*{{Text|say|[[Erzadormu]]|You're fortunate I always keep some sands of time in my pocket. It has many uses, you know.}}
*{{Text|say|[[Taeredormu]]|What a novel idea! I've been tempted to do this to the whelps once or twice.}}
*{{Text|say|[[Veladormi]]|You have asked me to do this in seventeen timelines so far. This one is by far the worst.}}
*{{Text|say|[[Yvendormi]]|Not that I expect you to appreciate it, but the expertise in temporal calculus required to shift dimensional matrices forward this accurately took several thousand years to acquire.}}
*{{Text|say|[[Peledormu]]|I just returned from a timeline where an orc did this... Promise you aren't starting an army, okay?}}
*{{Text|say|[[Midormi]]|Just this one time, dear. Well, probably more than that.}}
:''The dragon channels magic into the soul, and the plant grows rapidly.''

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Vaeros|That was kind of you, Adazius. Thank you for helping us keep the gardens safe.}}
:{{Text|say|Adazius|It was in my own best interest. My daughters beg to return here every time we leave, promising to do their reading if I allow it, and thus it behooves me to ensure they will not be in danger.}}
:{{Text|say|Vaeros|Ah, so they are the ones bribing you?}}
:{{Text|say|Adazius|Quiet yourself before I send the [[adventurer]] to bring the bees back.}}
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|No more skitterflies! You are going to ruin your dinner.}}
:''The [[Bronze Whelpling (Waking Shores)|Bronze Whelpling]] that was above is now sitting on a stool in front of Lasztak.''

If completed as the last quest in the questline, it also awards the "Ruby Lifecalling" criterion of [[Sojourner of the Waking Shores]].
