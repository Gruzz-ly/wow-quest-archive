==Objectives==
Gather 12 Molten Binding Rings.
*[[Molten Binding Rings]] (12)

==Description==
The [[djaradin]] here have become bold, binding [[Fire elemental|flame elementals]] and letting them rampage through the area. The wildlife has fled, and the elementals are dangerously close to our camps.

Luckily, I have been able to construct a small bastion of stone to stand against this fiery tide the djaradin have unleashed... and we will not fall!

Gather the [[magic]]al rings that bind these flame elementals. We shall use them to bolster our defenses against the flame elementals.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|Elemental Binding Ring
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 9,050 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered all the rings I asked for?

==Completion==
Perfect! The residual energies of these rings can be turned against their creators to summon a construct under our control!

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Earthcaller Yevaa|The signs of manipulation are everywhere. We must act quickly to end this!}}
