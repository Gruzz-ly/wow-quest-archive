Recover volumes of the Obsidian Genealogy, and deliver them to [[Wrathion]] and [[Sabellian]]'s quartermasters.
*[[Obsidian Genealogy]] (2)
*Deliver tome to [[Samia Inkling]]
*Deliver tome to [[Lorena Belle]]

==Description==
Despite securing the upper ramparts of the [[Obsidian Citadel]], the djaradin forces continue to pillage the courtyard. The area is full of priceless historical records! We must act quickly to secure anything that documents the lineage of the black dragonflight.

Both Wrathion and Sabellian desire this information, so you can curry favor by procuring a tome for each of them.

Travel to the collapsed tower of the citadel. You should find something worth recovering.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Wrathion (faction)|Wrathion]]
* +200 reputation with [[Sabellian (faction)|Sabellian]]

==Progress==
Have you found the tomes?

==Completion==
Excellent! I am certain both Wrathion and Sabellian will be pleased with your efforts.
