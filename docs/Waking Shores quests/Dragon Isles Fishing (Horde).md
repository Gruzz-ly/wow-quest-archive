==Completion==
[[Fishing]] is all about feeling the water beneath you. Eventually the water becomes the sky, and the sky becomes the water, and you are floating amongst the clouds, like a kite! And your fishing rod is your kite string!

...or perhaps that is the volcanic fumes. But either way, fishing is very relaxing. I would delight in sharing the art with you.

==Notes==
Despite the quest text, this does not actually teach Dragon Isles Fishing. Speak with Danielle again, open the trainer interface, and spend {{cost|100}} to learn the profession proper, which requires level {{level|df-min}} and Fishing (1).
