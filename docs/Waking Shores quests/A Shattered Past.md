;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Scalecommander Emberthal]]|These [[djaradin]] have been looting the citadel... perhaps they have taken the fragments. I shall assist you in the search.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Archivist Edress]]|Please--I would like to accompany you as well. My knowledge of this citadel could be of much use.}}

;Entering the vault
:{{Text|say|Archivist Edress|These vaults stretch for miles beneath the Citadel. Many powerful weapons and artifacts were locked away here for safekeeping.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|And now it seems the djaradin are pillaging the vaults in hopes of expanding their power.}}

;In front of [[Shas'ith]]'s chamber
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|What is that?}}
:{{text|say|Archivist Edress|Left unattended for so long, it seems these vaults have fallen into disarray.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|If I were a djaradin, I would not be in such a hurry to open that chamber.}}

;Inside the hallway with elementals
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Those [[elemental]]s... the very foundations of the Citadel are being animated against us!}}
