==Objectives==
Capture a Shyfly at the [[Wild Preserve]] in The [[Waking Shores]].
*Capture a [[Shyfly]] in a [[Pet Battle]]

==Description==
Like we talked about, [[:Lubbins]] needs two things: A buddy and a battle.

I think we can get him both at the same time.

This area is a prime mating ground for [[Shyfly]]s. If you look around a bit, you're sure to find a bunch.

Remember, you need to weaken it before you can capture it with your trap.

Come back when you have one. It might be a bit bruised after your battle, but I've got some battle-training stones that will fix 'em right up!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=2|Flying Battle-Training Stone
|q2=10|Polished Pet Charm
}}

==Progress==
The Shyflys shouldn't be too hard to find, especially now that you know where to look.

==Completion==
Nicely done. I believe these battle-stones are just what your new pet needs. 

You know what? Take a few polished pet charms too. 

Did I mention you can trade them for good stuff? Because you can!
