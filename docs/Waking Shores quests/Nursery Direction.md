==Objectives==
Meet [[Vaeros]] in the gardens of the [[Ruby Life Pools]].

==Description==
I'm so grateful that [[Lasztak]] has accepted the Calling of a Whelptender! Especially given how many of the precious little things are teething right now.

Beyond that, the nursery gardens are admittedly facing challenges. The whelps are stressed and the tenders are--well, more stressed than usual.

Please, whenever you have a spare moment, find me in the gardens below. We could use your help as well!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 910 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank goodness you're here! You may have noticed the [[bee]]s on your way in. We must do something about them!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Vaeros|The gardens are where we care for our most precious charges. Which usually means keeping them from putting things in their mouths. Come, I will show you the way down.}}
:{{Text|say|Lasztak|I'll run ahead. Race you there, Vaeros!}}
:''Vaeros starts walking slowly, while Lasztak starts running.''

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Vaeros|Lasztak, please get her down from the tree. She is almost an hour overdue for naptime!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Lasztak]]|I'm trying! The bees keep frightening her.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Adazius]]|Allowing your charges to roost in trees like common birds. How unbecoming.}}
