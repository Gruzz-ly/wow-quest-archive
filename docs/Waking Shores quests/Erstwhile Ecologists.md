==Objectives==
Check in on the wayward ecologists.

==Description==
The wounded are stabilized, but something still troubles me, <name>.

A pair of [[dragonspawn]] ecologists had come to the outpost to study the [[Restless Wetlands|wetlands]]. I haven't seen scale nor claw of them since the attack, and it's become worrisome.

If you're venturing out, would you mind keeping an eye out, and making sure they're safe?

And do take care. Rumor has it those wetlands are [[gorloc]]-infested.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 910 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
An attack? On [[Dragonheart Outpost]]?

Well, that does sound serious. But as you can see, we're dealing with our own crisis here.

==Notes==
;Approaching [[Ecologist Iskha]] and [[Ecologist Tharu]]
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Iskha|These creatures died traumatically, Tharu. We must treat their remains respectfully.}}
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Tharu|What's more respectful than finding out what's killing them as quickly as we can?}}
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Tharu|We're supposed to preserve life, Iskha... not just carefully observe it!}}
:{{Text|say|Ecologist Iskha|All I meant is that you could stand to be more gentle during dissections.}}

==Progression==
{{Save the Hippos!}}
