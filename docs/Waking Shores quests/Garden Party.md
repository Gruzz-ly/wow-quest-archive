==Objectives==
Speak to [[Akora]] in the [[Ruby Life Pools]].

==Description==
I've been tending to this garden for years, preparing for the day I'd finally accept my Lifecalling. Now that day is here!

I love flowers and all trees and plants--even the bugs that live amongst them. I can feel nature's spirit--the [[Great Dragon Spirit]]--when I tend the garden.

There's only one thing left to do. I'm going to invoke Great Dragon Spirit, just like the legends.

<Akora smiles brightly>

Meet me down in the garden by the pool where her bones rest. I'll explain more there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 910 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Excellent! Now we can really get to work, <name>.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Akora|Meet you down by the pool! C'mon, Keshki!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Keshki]]|Huh? Wait for me, Akora!}}
:''Akora and Keshki leave the shrine.''

;On approach
:{{Text|say|Akora|...and the legend says that as she died, she sang a song so beautiful it made flowers grow over her bones forevermore.}}
:{{Text|emote|Keshki nods along, listening to their friend tell her tale.}}
:{{Text|say|Akora|And if a [[red dragonkin]] proves their devotion to life, her spirit will rise to sing the song once again.}}
:{{Text|say|Akora|Do you believe in the legend? Do you think I'll ever hear her song?}}
