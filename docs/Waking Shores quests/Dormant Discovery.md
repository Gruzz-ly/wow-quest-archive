'''Dormant Discovery''' is the first quest in a chain to unlock a pair of Ancient Waygates at the [[Rubyscale Outpost]]. The [[Magically Bound Message]] will appear in your inventory when you reach Renown level 7 with the [[Dragonscale Expedition]].

==Objectives==
Deliver the message to [[Thaelin Darkanvil]] at the [[Rubyscale Outpost]] in The [[Waking Shores]].

==Description==
<Nevermind how this curious parchment ended up in your bags. What's important are the contents of the message.>

Members of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]]:

Your assistance is required! Report to the Rubyscale Outpost at once!

<Before the signature can be read, the magical lettering inscribed on the note dissipates into a cloud of white and blue-tinted dust, leaving behind an empty page and a deliciously flowery scent in the air.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Message? What message?

What do ye mean it vanished mysteriously?

Well, no matter. We've got much to discuss.
