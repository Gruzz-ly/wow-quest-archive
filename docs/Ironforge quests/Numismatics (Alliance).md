==Objectives==
Bring Misprinted Draenic Coins to Krom Stoutarm in Ironforge. Misprinted Draenic Coins can be found when completing your first Heroic Draenor dungeon each day.
*[[Misprinted Draenic Coin]](5) 
*Bring Misprinted Draenic Coins to Krom Stoutarm in Ironforge.

==Description==
I hate to be too cynical, but I don't think we're gonna find Nolan in one piece.  Or in a lot of pieces.

Nolan was a nut for finding rare coins.  He's been from one end of the world to the other finding them, and now he's gone and gotten himself killed looking for more mint condition Draenei coins.  Tell you what - let me show you what these coins look like, you bring me a few more of them and I'll set up an exhibit in his honor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Ancient Heirloom Armor Casing]]

==Progress==
How's the coin hunt going?

==Completion==
These are in great condition. Nolan would be green with envy.

==Notes==
*You only get [[Misprinted Draenic Coin]] from the first random Heroic Dungeon each day.
*Only the amount of coins needed for the quest will be removed from your inventory.
*You will continue to get coins until you turn in the quest.
*You will continue to get coins even after the final quest.
