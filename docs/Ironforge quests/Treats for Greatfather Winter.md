'''Treats for Greatfather Winter''' is a one-time quest each [[Feast of Winter Veil]]. Find five [[Small Egg]]s on any level 20-or-below bird, [[Ice Cold Milk]] at any innkeeper or drink vendor, and [[Holiday Spices]] at the [[Smokywood Pastures]] general goods vendors. The recipe to make a [[Gingerbread Cookie]] is sold by the same general goods vendors.

==Objectives==
Bring 5 Gingerbread Cookies and an Ice Cold Milk to [[Greatfather Winter (Ironforge)|Greatfather Winter]] in [[Ironforge]].
*[[Gingerbread Cookie]] (5)
*[[Ice Cold Milk]]

==Description==
Hey, can you do Greatfather Winter a favor, um, little <boy/girl>?

Not to needlessly talk about myself in the third person, but Greatfather Winter has been at this all day and he could use a treat himself.  Some gingerbread cookies and ice cold milk to wash them down with would really hit the spot.  Think you could be a friend to the Greatfather and fetch some for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|9}} at max level)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]
*+25 reputation with [[Everlook]]
*+25 reputation with [[Gadgetzan]]
*+25 reputation with [[Ratchet]]
*[[Smokywood Pastures Gift Pack]]

==Progress==
All this talk of treats has given me a hankering for some myself. &nbsp;Mmmm... gingerbread cookies and milk...

==Completion==
You're quite the helper to ol' Greatfather Winter there, <name>. &nbsp;Have a great Feast of Winter Veil.

Here's a little something... you know, for the effort.

==Notes==
Some time after completing this quest, you will get mail from Greatfather Winter:
{{book|Greatfather Winter|content=Ho Ho Hello, <name>!  I hope you have a fantastic Feast of Winter Veil!

You were so nice in helping me out with my sweet tooth, that I wanted to send you a little something extra.  It's a sampler of delicious Smokywood Pastures treats.  If you haven't gotten any yet, be sure to do so before the season ends!

Seasons Greetings...<br/>
Greatfather Winter}}

This mail is accompanied by a [[Smokywood Pastures Sampler]].
