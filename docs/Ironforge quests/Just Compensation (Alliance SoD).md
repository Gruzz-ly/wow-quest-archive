==Objectives==
Bring a [[Dungeon Set 1]] Belt and a set of [[Dungeon Set 1]] Gloves to [[Deliana]] in [[Ironforge]]. 

==Description==
You kept your word and brought the device built by Mux. I believe a reward is in order if I'm to keep you interested in saving my skin. Bring me the belt and set of gauntlets that you wish to upgrade. I promise the ones I give you in return will be far superior.

== Rewards ==
You will receive (depending on class):
* Druid: [[Feline Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Astral Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Guardian's Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Mender's Gloves and Belt Set]]
* Hunter: [[Pursuer's Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Prowler's Gloves and Belt Set]]
* Mage: [[Sorcerer's Belt (Season of Discovery)]] and [[Sorcerer's Gauntlets]]
* Paladin: [[Merciful Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Radiant Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Divine Will Gloves and Belt Set]]
* Priest: [[Dawn Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Twilight Gloves and Belt Set]]
* Rogue: [[Thrill's Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Battle's Gloves and Belt Set]]
* Warlock: [[Corrupted Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Wicked Gloves and Belt Set]]
* Warrior: [[Immoveable Gloves and Belt Set]] or [[Unstoppable Gloves and Belt Set]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|5|97}}
*9,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You're ready to perform the trade?

==Completion==
You've kept your end of the bargain, I shall keep mine.

Just remember that I'm holding on to the best pieces until your work is finished.

== Notes ==
* You must hand in your [[Dungeon Set 1]] belt and gloves to complete this quest. You will lose any enchantment that is on those items.
* If you have multiple sets of belts or gloves (1 equipped, 1 in a bag) and turn in this quest, you will lose both sets of items. If you want to keep one for later, put one set in the bank.
