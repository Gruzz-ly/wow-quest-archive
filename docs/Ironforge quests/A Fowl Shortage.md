==Objectives==
Collect 6 Dun Morogh Chickens near the entrance to Ironforge.
*[[Dun Morogh Chicken (item)]] (6)

==Description==
Oh, no, <name>, this is going to be a disaster if we don't find some chicken soon...  Ye just cannae make cock-a-leekie soup without the chicken!  It's not possible!

There's still time to make the soup and broth if ye can find some fresh chicken.  Will ye help me?  There are usually a few chickens running around outside the front entrance ot the city.  If ye can get yer hands on, say, six o' them, that should save me soup.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|16|54|}} (at level 85)
*+1 [[Cooking]] Skill
*[[Epicurean's Award]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
The chickens, <name>, do ye have them or not?

==Completion==
Aye, that's exactly what I needed.  Ye have me thanks, <name>, and me apologies fer bein' so brusque earlier.  I just cannae stand the thought of not gettin' a meal finished on time.

==Notes==
You only need to pick up the chickens.  You will be dismounted when interacting with them.
