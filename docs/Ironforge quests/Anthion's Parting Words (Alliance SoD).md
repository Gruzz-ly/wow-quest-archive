==Objectives==
Return to [[Deliana]] in [[Ironforge]] with a set of [[Dungeon Set 1]] Boots, [[Dungeon Set 1]] Pants and [[Dungeon Set 1]] Shoulders.
* [[Top Piece of Lord Valthalak's Amulet]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Lord Valthalak|Valthalak]]'s soul was stored in this amulet. In our greed we foolishly split it into three parts, not knowing the curse that would await us.

The only way to stop Valthalak's spell is to put the amulet back together. Return to [[Deliana]] and tell her that [[Bodley]] is his only hope for finding the remaining pieces. Speak to her about any rewards you've arranged for.

I, for once, shall rest in peace. I wish you the best of luck; you shall need every bit of it!

==Rewards==
You will receive (depending on class):
* Druid: [[Feline Boots, Legs, and Shoulders Set]] or [[Astral Boots, Legs, and Shoulders Set]] or [[Guardian's Boots, Legs, and Shoulders Set]] or [[Mender's Boots, Legs, and Shoulders Set]]
* Hunter: [[Pursuer's Boots, Legs, and Shoulders Set]] or [[Prowler's Boots, Legs, and Shoulders Set]]

==Progress==
You're back, <name>.  You must tell me all about what you've found out.  But first let us arrange for your reward.

==Completion==
I can't believe our lives are all but forfeit all because of a stupid medallion!  And you're sure Anthion mentioned [[Bodley]]?

Well, you've done your job so let's get your reward out of the way.
