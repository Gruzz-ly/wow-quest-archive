==Objectives==
Bring Thermaplugg's Engineering Notes to [[High Tinker Mekkatorque]] at [[Tinker Town]] in [[Ironforge]].
*[[Thermaplugg's Engineering Notes]] (provided)

==Description==
You find a dirty, tattered notebook full of scribbled schematics and notes. It's quite clear even after just a cursory glance that any of these creations could be used to wreak terrible havoc should anyone ever be foolish enough to build them.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Pendant of Homecoming
|Piston Pendant
|Gnomeregan Peace Officer's Torque
|Justice Badge}}

You will receive:
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan Exiles]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
<name>, what is it you have there?

==Completion==
I can't thank you enough for recovering these schematics. I shudder to think what would have become of Ironforge  had Thermaplugg been able to bring these creations to bear against us.

This calls for a celebration!
