==Objectives==
Bring 12 Essential Artificials to [[Klockmort Spannerspan]] in [[Ironforge]].
*[[Essential Artificial]] (12)

==Description==
A nigh-universal mechanical component—the essential artificial—was of great use to the tinkers and smiths of [[Gnomeregan]]. But during the frantic exodus from our city, no one remembered to take any of these devices with them! And I need a large supply of them for work I will soon undertake.

Please, go into Gnomeregan and get me some essential artificials. You'll find them in the deeper areas of our city, held in containers called artificial extrapolators.

Thank you, <name>, and please hurry!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1}}
* 3900 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan Exiles]]

==Progress==
Do you have the essential artificials?

==Completion==
You got them! Now I can begin my new experiments!

I can't thank you enough, <name>! Your bravery has advanced gnomish research by a leap and a bound!

==Notes==
*The extrapolators look like 6' tall steam-powered closets. Each one yields up a single [[Artificial Extrapolator]]. A full run of Gnomeregan should allow the full party to get the extrapolators they need to complete this quest.

==Patch changes==
