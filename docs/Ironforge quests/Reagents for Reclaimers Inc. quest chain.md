}}A simple set of item-gathering quests based in [[Nijel's Point]] in [[Desolace]].

== Reagents for Reclaimer Inc ==
* '''[[Reclaimers' Business in Desolace]]'''
[[Roetten Stonehammer]], at the [[Hall of Explorers]] in [[Ironforge]] has word that Reclaimers, Inc has work for someone, out in Desolace.  He tells you to seek out [[Kreldig Ungor]] in [[Nijel's Point]].

Learning that Roetten sent you, Kreldig welcomes you and compliments
you on your choice of employment.

*''This quest is also a prerequisite for [[The Karnitol Shipwreck]], also given by Kreldig.''

* '''[[Reagents for Reclaimers Inc. (quest)]]'''
Kreldig has a shopping list for [[Leftwitch]], a gnome mage in [[Kharanos]].
First on the list are horns and claws from the nearby Hatefury [[satyr]]s.

A worthy cause, killing demons.  And hey, you get paid for it, too.
Not every demon has horns or claws in good shape, and you have no idea
what kind of quality Leftwitch needs, but you eventually stop killing
demons long enough to collect the parts he asked for.

* '''[[Reagents for Reclaimers Inc. (2)]]'''
Second and third on Leftwitch's list are Aged Kodo Hides, and Scorpashi venom.

The first is simply a matter of finding the right kind of Kodo.  Old but not TOO old.  The second is dangerous, but tedious work: killing scorpions until you have collected enough venom from them.  But not especially challenging, as long as you watch your back.

Again, you bring the items back to Kreldig.

* '''[[Reagents for Reclaimers Inc. (3)]]'''
Kreldig sends you out one more time.  This time, you're to bring back yet
more demon parts.  And nothing neat and clean like claws and horns, either.  Leftwitch wants brains, wings, and blood.  You sure hope Leftwitch is not trying to build a better demon out of all this...

You set out again, this time to the southern reaches of Desolace.  You do
a great service for the Alliance in thinning the ranks of demons, and collect
a great many gruesome parts that some mage off in Karanos is willing to pay
for.

Kreldig is amazed and grateful to you for fetching these.  35 silver grateful, when it comes to that.

* '''[[Reagents for Reclaimers Inc. (4)]]'''
Having done everything else to collect items for Leftwitch's order, Kreldig
has you take the package back to [[Roetten Stonehammer]] in [[Ironforge]].

Nice of him to give you the credit and the good word with Roetten, wasn't it?
When you get back to Ironforge, Roetten does pay you handsomely for the
collection.

== Rewards ==
During this quest chain, you earn some 1000 reputation for the parts, and an additional 75 for the introduction quest from Roetten.

The final quest in the chain gives you 
{{itembox|one of|Auric Bracers|Stormfire Gauntlets}}
