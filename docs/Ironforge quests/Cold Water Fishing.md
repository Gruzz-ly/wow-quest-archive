==Objectives==
Catch 5 Arctic Char by fishing in [[Helm's Bed Lake]] in [[Dun Morogh]].
*[[Arctic Char]] (5)

==Description==
The best tastin' fish live in the cold waters o' Dun Morogh, <name>, an' don't let anyone else tell ye otherwise!  Me favorite, an' the most popular one in [[Ironforge]] is the arctic char, which only comes from our ancestral lands.

I like tae think o' it as Ironforge's gift t' the world!

Why don't ye try yer hand at catchin' a few yerself?  The best place tae find 'em is down in Helm's Bed Lake, in the southeastern end o' Dun Morogh.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|94000}} (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Ironforge}}
*+1 [[Fishing]]
*[[Bag of Shiny Things]]

==Progress==
Have ye tried to catch those char?

==Completion==
These are beautiful, <name>!  I think ye've got the hang of it.

==Notes==
Take the [[flight path]] to [[Gol'Bolar Quarry]] then head straight east to the lake, or fly straight there.  Lower level characters should be careful of the hostile mobs near the lake, that are around level 10.
