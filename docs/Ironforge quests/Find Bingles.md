==Objectives==
Find [[Bingles Blastenheimer]] in [[Loch Modan]].

==Description==
We've lost contact with Bingles! He was sent on a reconnaissance mission over [[Gnomeregan]] and hasn't reported back in over a week. I just know he's gone and blown himself up.

He was last seen flying over the Loch. Perhaps you can investigate, <name>.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*270 [[XP]] 
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Completion==
So [[Gnoarn]] doesn't trust my reconnaissance abilities? I wonder why...

Nevermind that, I need your assistance! Nay! The movement needs your assistance!

==Notes==
*In ''Cataclysm'', Bingles has wandered to the [[Farstrider Lodge]].

==Progression==
*[[Find Bingles]] (optional breadcrumb)
*[[Wing Nut]]
