==Objectives==
Bring Misprinted Draenic Coins to [[Krom Stoutarm]] in [[Ironforge]].  Misprinted Draenic Coins can be found when completing your first [[Heroic]] Draenor dungeon each day.
* [[Misprinted Draenic Coin]] (10)

==Description==
Interesting - the coins you've brought back from your [[Garrison]] are slightly different than the ones Nolan collected in [[Outland]].  Y'see here, the markings along the edge?  Very interesting stuff!  This requires some more study an' that means more coins!  Bring them to me and I'll see if I can scrounge up something for your trouble.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Timeworn Heirloom Armor Casing]]

==Progress==
Aye?  Y'got them coins yet?

==Completion==
Y'know, I think we might be on to somethin' big here.

==Notes==
*You only get [[Misprinted Draenic Coin]] from the first random Heroic Dungeon each day.
*Only the amount of coins needed for the quest will be removed from your inventory.
*You will continue to get coins until you turn in the quest.
*You will continue to get coins even after the final quest.
