==Objectives==
Bring the Lorgalis Manuscript to [[Gerrig Bonegrip]] in the [[Forlorn Cavern]] in [[Ironforge]].
* [[Lorgalis Manuscript]]

==Description==
As you might know, I collect lore. Old lore. Powerful lore. Lore that opens doorways, and lore that can awaken Those Who Sleep.

There are rumors of an old piece of lore, the Lorgalis Manuscript, at the bottom of [[Blackfathom Deeps]] in [[Ashenvale]]. That place is the old dwelling of long-dead [[Night elf|elves]]. Elves who held great knowledge before their city fell to ruin.

Search Blackfathom Deeps for the manuscript. Do this, and I will not forget it. Not even after ... the end days.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Ever-Sustaining Ring]]
* +50 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
The journey to Ashenvale is long, and your task is not easy.  But if you get me the manuscript, <name>...then your reward will be great.

==Completion==
You found the manuscript!  What a joyous day this is!  Copies will be made and distributed, and the ancient knowledge of Lorgalis will finally be known to my brothers and sisters!

Your service to us is more than you know, <name>.  But I hope that this gift shows you the gratitude we extend to our allies.
