* Catch [[Cold Water Crayfish (mob)|Cold Water Crayfish]]
* Take Crayfish to Cook Ghilm
* [[Grimnur's Bait]] (provided)

==Description==
If ye've ever fished fer crayfish, ye know they respond best to live bait, an' the more bait, the better.  Would ye like to test my new bait?  Simply smear this on yerself an' hop into Helm's Bed Lake in eastern Dun Morogh.

After ye've got the catch, take it to me friend, [[Cook Ghilm]] at [[Gol'Bolar Quarry]], west of the lake.  He's an expert at cookin' those oversized bugs!

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{coppercost|94000}} (or {{coppercost|165400}} on lvl 85)
*+1 [[Fishing]]
* +250 reputation with [[Ironforge]]
{{itembox|You will also receive:
|Bag of Shiny Things}}

==Progress==
Oh... this might hurt a wee bit.

==Completion==
{{text|say|Cook Ghilm|By th' [[Light]], it worked!  Grimnur's brilliant... oh, I hope all the pinchin' didn't hurt ye too much...  But when ye taste the meat, ye'll know it's worth it!}}

These are beautiful, <name>!  Grimnur's goin' tae be so proud when he hears about this!

Oh, he did say tae pass this along tae ye, if the scheme worked.

==Notes==
Take the [[flight path]] to Gol'Bolar Quarry then head straight east to the lake, or fly straight there.  Lower level characters should be careful of the hostile mobs near the lake, that are around level 10.

Using the bait debuffs you for five minutes with "Grimnur's Bait: To say you smell funky would be putting it mildly.", and tints you red.  This will not use up the bait.  You must then jump into the water, or if you're already swimming, jump at the surface.  This will trigger a Crayfish Attack, which buffs you with "Crayfish Catch: You've discovered the best way to catch cold water crayfish." for 10 minutes, represented by small [[Makrura]]-model crayfish clinging to your body and limbs.  This is accompanied by the appropriate sound effect.  The buff will not cause any loss of [[health]] in any way.

You must then run back to Cook Ghilm at the quarry as mounting will dispell the buff, but using abilities like shapeshifting, [[Heroic Leap]] and [[Blink]] are fine.
