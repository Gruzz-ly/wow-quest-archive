==Objectives==
Speak to [[Kreldig Ungor]] in [[Desolace]].

==Description==
There's work to be done in [[Desolace]], <name>.  It's an atrocious place, befouled by centaur and other nasties.  But if you're looking for a good week's honest work, then head there, meet with [[Kreldig Ungor]], and tell him I sentcha.

You can find him holed up at [[Nijel's Point]]--it's a little cozy camp hidden in the mountains of norther Desolace.  Just head east if you enter from the [[Stonetalon Mountains]].  It's easy to miss, so be on the lookout.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1450 [[XP]]
*75 [[reputation]] with {{F|Ironforge}}

==Completion==
Glad to see the Reclaimers aren't in short supply of work, or adventurers willing to help out.

I'm [[Kreldig Ungor|Kreldig]], <name>. You've made a smart move helpin' out the Reclaimers. Everyone needs something these days: they've lost a
family heirloom, a magic item, a loved one. You never can tell. But with the [[Reclaimers]] around, there's no reason, for the right price, everyone can't find what they've lost.

==Notes==
[[Nijel's Point]] is a bit further east on the map of [[Desolace]] than what looks like a path up if you have not discovered the area yet.  Keep heading east and you will come to the correct path with torches bordering it.

[[Kreldig Ungor]] is along the left side as you enter Nijel's Point.
