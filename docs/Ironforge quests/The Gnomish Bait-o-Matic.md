==Description==
One o' the [[Springspindle Fizzlegear|gnomish engineerin' trainers]] gave me a blueprint fer a fancy [[lure]] he says'll help me catch fish faster and keep 'em from gettin' away.  The whole thing sounds a mite silly if ye ask me, but I'll try anythin' once.

Here are the blueprints.  Ye're going to need shiny baubles, which ye can buy from [[Tansy Puddlefizz|my assistant]] inside the buildin', a hair trigger ye can buy from an [[Gearcutter Cogspinner|engineerin' supplier]] in [[Tinker Town]], and a few rat traps from the [[Deeprun Tram]]. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|94000}} (or {{coppercost|165400}} on lvl 85)
*+1 [[Fishing]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
{{itembox|You will also receive:
|Bag of Shiny Things}}

==Progress==
How's that fancy new lure comin' along? 

==Completion==
It doesn't look like anything I think a fish'd be interested in, but ye never know.  Fish 'er strange creatures.  Thanks fer givin' this a try, <name>.
