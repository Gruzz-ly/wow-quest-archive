==Objectives==
Bring Misprinted Draenic Coins to [[Krom Stoutarm]] in [[Ironforge]].  Misprinted Draenic Coins can be found when completing your first Heroic Draenor dungeon each day.
* [[Misprinted Draenic Coin]] (50) 

==Description==
I'm beginning to suspect these here coins are [[demon]]ic. See? This one's got three eyes! This one always comes up tails. And over here - the ones you brought me earlier? They dissolved in holy water.

I need to make absolutely sure this isn't a fluke - bring me a huge pile of coins to sort through so nobody can refute m'theory.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Timeworn Heirloom Scabbard]]

==Progress==
Incredible work.  Yer gonna be a hero in the [[Explorer's League]] for sure.

==Completion==
Aye, I've been talkin' to the [[priests]] in the [[Mystic Ward]] and they confirmed my sucpicions.  These 'misprinted' coins are all demonic in origin.

Yeh done a good deed takin' these out of circulation.  Well done, <name>!

==Notes==
*You only get [[Misprinted Draenic Coin]] from the first random Heroic Dungeon each day.
*Only the amount of coins needed for the quest will be removed from your inventory.
*You will continue to get coins until you turn in the quest.
*You will continue to get coins even after the final quest.
*Though the quest specifies Heroic Draenor dungeons, any Random Heroic Dungeon queue will award coins.
