==Objectives==
Bring a Prismatic Punch Card to [[Master Mechanic Castpipe]] in [[Ironforge]].
*[[Prismatic Punch Card]]

==Description==
When we fled [[Gnomeregan]], we left so much data behind! Vitally important data!

I need the data on a prismatic punch card, from a [[Matrix Punchograph 3005]]-D high security terminal, deep in Gnomeregan.  You must access the terminal, but to do that you first need clearance... and to get that you must access lower security terminals—models -A, -B and -C.  And to do THAT you need security punch cards, starting with [[White Punch Card|white]]... and we left all the punch cards in the city.

It's a catastrophe! Can you help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||50|}}
*4700 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan Exiles]]
*[[Repairman's Cape (Season of Discovery)]]
*[[Mechanic's Pipehammer (Season of Discovery)]]

==Progress==
Do you have the prismatic punch card??

==Completion==
You did it!  You found the prismatic punch card and recovered the lost data!  Vitally, critically, immeasurably important data that we could not live another moment without!

Your service to the gnomes will be long remembered, <name>.

==Notes==
===Outside the Instance===
The first part of this quest takes place in Gnomeregan, but ''outside'' the instance.  You must first get [[White Punch Card]], which is a random drop from the mobs near the instance.  Then you must use the card in a [[Matrix Punchograph 3005-A]], which are located in the Train Depot area (on the raised platform in the center, and by the Workshop (back door) entrance).  This will give you a [[Yellow Punch Card]].

===Inside the Instance===
*[[Matrix Punchograph 3005-B]]s are located in the [[Dormitory]] (just past the [[Clean Zone]]). They will upgrade your Yellow Punch Card to a [[Blue Punch Card]].
*[[Matrix Punchograph 3005-C]]s are located on the platform with {{npc||Electrocutioner 6000}}. They will upgrade your Blue Punch Card to a [[Red Punch Card]].
*[[Matrix Punchograph 3005-D]]s are located on the lower level of the [[Engineering Labs]]. They will upgrade your Red Punch Card to a [[Prismatic Punch Card]].

===Binary punch card translations===
*The blocks of 1s and 0s in the description page when you interact with different machines actually have meaning. They are binary representations of ASCII text. A few examples listed here (some from [http://www.thottbot.com/q2930 Thottbot]):
