==Objectives==
Return the notebook to [[Krom Stoutarm]] in [[Ironforge]].

==Description==
This book has seen better days.  Not much can be made out between the waterlogging and the apparent animal bites, but you can make out some sort of Ironforge-based drinking game scoring system involving a [[dwarf]] named Krom Stoutarm.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|15|40|}}

==Completion==
Oh now, this brings back some memories.  Y'didn't look at the scores did you?

This belonged to ol' Nolan, may he rest in peace.  Not a very good explorer, but a helluva drinker.
