==Objectives==
Bring the Brilliant Gold Ring, a Silver Bar, a Moss Agate, and 30 silver coins to [[Talvash del Kissel]] in [[Ironforge]].
* [[Moss Agate]]
* [[Silver Bar]]
*Required Money: {{cost||30}}
* [[Brilliant Gold Ring]] (provided) 

==Description==
Listen <name>, that ring is yours, sure... but I can make you a better one! That design, like I said, is really simple. I am a lot more skilled now, and for the mere fee of thirty silver coins I'll spruce it up for you! Well, a little more than thirty, actually...

I'm in a tight spot right now; all my material stock is all dried up. If you bring me a bar of silver and a moss agate, I'll add a silver and agate lattice to the ring that will give it a little more pizzazz!

Trust me!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You receive|Talvash's Brilliant Gold Ring}}

You will also receive:
*3150 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Do you have the materials I need? I wouldn't ask you for them if I wasn't down on my luck... 

==Completion==
Ah, exactly what I needed! Someday, when I find myself out of this hole that I am unjustly in, I will make for you, for EVERYONE the finest trinkets in all of Azeroth! Until then, thanks for being a sport about the reagents. I'd normally charge ten times what I have charged you for a ring of this quality...

Speaking of rings, here's your new one!
