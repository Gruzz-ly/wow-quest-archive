That's an amazing story, <name>! You have my thanks, and the heartfelt gratitude of all who were involved. Now maybe I'll be able to sleep at night with both eyes shut.

As to your reward, I believe I have a few things that you'll really enjoy.

* Druid: [[Feline Helm and Chestpiece Set]] or [[Astral Helm and Chestpiece Set]] or [[Guardian's Helm and Chestpiece Set]] or [[Mender's Helm and Chestpiece Set]]

==Progress==
As per our deal, are you ready to hand over your [[Dungeon Set 1]] pieces in exchange for your new [[Dungeon Set 2]] Helm and [[Dungeon Set 2]] Chestpiece?

==Completion==
I'm going to miss you, <name>. I owe you such a debt of gratitude; I think I'll never be able to repay it.

I hope that you enjoy your new head and chest armor, and that it protects you for a long time to come.
