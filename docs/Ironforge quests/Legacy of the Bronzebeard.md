==Objectives==
Present the [[Bulwark of the Mountain King]] to [[Muradin Bronzebeard]] in the [[High Seat]].

==Description==
You must present this armor to Muradin at once! This is an historic day for the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] people.

This isn't just a suit of armor, it's a symbol of our heritage.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Heritage of the Bronzebeard|id=286946|Collect the appearances of the Heritage of the Bronzebeard clan.|icon=inv_shoulders_armor_dwarf_d_01}}

*26,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>, you have long been a champion for the dwarven people. Your acts of valor and bravery will be sung in these halls for ages.

I can see no other dwarf more deserving to wear this armor than you.

==Notes==
Go to the [[High Seat]] and approach [[Muradin Bronzebeard]].

The room is filled with [[Ironforge Citizen]]s and [[Dwarven Stout Keg]]s.
