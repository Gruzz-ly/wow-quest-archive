[[Aegrim]], you say? [[Bulwark of the Mountain King]]? Well, if we are going to start anywhere, it has to be [[Aegrim's Study|Aegrim's study]]. The entrance lies below us in the depths of Old Ironforge.

The only trouble is the troggs in our way. How about you take the lead?

* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The guards will tend to sealing the tunnels. We have important work to do.

==Notes==
On accept, Advisor Belgrum will start following you. Run up the stairs and head to the secret halls while killing trogg invaders.
:{{Text|Say|Advisor Belgrum|The Bronzebeards were a small clan back then. It was thanks to Aegrim that the Bronzebeard name began to flourish and command respect.}}
:{{Text|Say|Advisor Belgrum|He earned renown for his abilities in combat, but he was also known as a great scholar. His study is just below us.}}
:{{Text|Say|Advisor Belgrum|I believe that the Bronzebeard brothers bear a striking resemblance to him: his leadership, his command of battle, and his inquisitiveness.}}

Slay [[Roc'maw the Burrower]] and turn in the quest.
