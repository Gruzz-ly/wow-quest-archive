==Objectives==
Find the Remnant of the Earthen Ritual in [[Old Ironforge]].
*[[Remnant of the Earthen Ritual]]
*Return the shard to Bouldercrag the Rockshaper in the [[Great Forge]].

==Description==
[[Ignis]] will help with smelting the metal, but the heat from the forge will cook you in yer boots!

Our ancestors, the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] who forged [[Aegrim]]'s armor, could sustain their [[:stoneform]] for far longer than we can today. That's how they could forge the bulwark in the first place.

Luckily, my friend [[Bouldercrag]] can help us with that. He'll need some materials for the ritual.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have it?

==Completion==
This will suffice.

==Notes==

:{{text|say|Advisor Belgrum|<Name>, back so soon? Looking for a remnant of Magni's ritual, you say? Please, feel free to take any of the crystals that splintered when Magni [[Magni: Fault Lines|broke free]].}}

Interact with the [[Remnant of the Earthen Ritual]] and collect it. The head to the Great Forge and return the shard to Bouldercrag and complete this quest.
