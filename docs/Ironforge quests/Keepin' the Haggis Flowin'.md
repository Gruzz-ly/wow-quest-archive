*[[Bag o' Sheep Innards]]
*[[Sack of Oatmeal]] (4)
*[[Mild Spices]] (5)

==Description==
The haggis must flow.  Aye, it's a figure o' speech, for haggis'll ne'er flow!  Ye dinnae want to know what'll happen if the people o' Ironforge don't get their haggis.

I'm working on the next batch, but I'm still missing a couple of ingredients.

[[Sognar Cliffbeard]] is the [[meat vendor]] in the [[Military Ward]], an' he'll sell you the big bag o' sheep innards I need.  Ye can buy mild spices from any cooking supplier and we can find sacks o' oatmeal in any [[inn]] or among the supplies in the city.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|16|54|}} (at level 85)
*+1 [[Cooking]] Skill
*+2 [[Epicurean's Award]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Do ye have those ingredients?

==Completion==
Ye got them all?  Wonderful!  I'll get started right away.

==Notes==
There will be oatmeal sacks that spawn beside or on top of the many supply crates and other common objects along the walls, all over the city.
