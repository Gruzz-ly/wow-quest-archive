==Objectives==
Distribute the [[Ironforge Rations]] to 6 Ironforge Guards.
* [[Ironforge Guard (NPC)|Ironforge Guard]]s Fed (6)

==Description==
The guards who defend [[Ironforge]] put their lives on the line against our many enemies, and it's up to us to take care of them.

Today, their rations consist of two dwarven favorites, haggis and Ironforge pale ale.  Would ye be so kind as to help me distribute them?  That way, everyone gets his food in a timely manner and we can move on to other tasks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|16|54|}} (at level 85)
* +1 [[Cooking]] Skill
* [[Epicurean's Award]]

==Progress==
Did you distribute all the rations?

==Completion==
A full guard is a happy guard, as I always say.  Thanks fer yer help, <name>.

==Gains==
* +250 reputation with [[Ironforge]]

==Notes==
After taking a ration, the Ironforge Guard gains a Well Fed buff (2 minutes) and says one of the following:
*{{text|say|Ironforge Guard|How did ye know me favorite meal?}}
*{{text|say|Ironforge Guard|Beer an' haggis, now that'll put hair on yer chest!}}
*{{text|say|Ironforge Guard|Keep bringing me food like this an' ye'll be me new best friend!}}
*{{text|say|Ironforge Guard|Haggis fer breakfast, haggis fer lunch, and a sensible haggis dinner!}}
*{{text|say|Ironforge Guard|Thank ye!}}
*{{text|say|Ironforge Guard|Give me thanks to Daryl, will ye?}}
