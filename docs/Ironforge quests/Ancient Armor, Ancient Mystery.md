==Objectives==
Speak to [[Advisor Belgrum]] in [[Old Ironforge]].

==Description==
By my beard! Do you know what this is?! It's an ancient tablet that describes how to forge the [[Bulwark of the Mountain King]]!

The last one to wear that armor was [[Aegrim Bronzebeard]], my ancestor and [[thane]] of the [[Bronzebeard clan]].

Talk to Advisor Belgrum. He'll know more about Aegrim's past, and might be able to shine some light on the legends of his armor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You were wise to come to me. I think I can help!

==Progression==
{{Legacy of the Bronzebeard}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.1.0|note=Added.}}
