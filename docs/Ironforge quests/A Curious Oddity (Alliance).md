==Objectives==
Bring Misprinted Draenic Coins to [[Krom Stoutarm]] in [[Ironforge]].  Misprinted Draenic Coins can be found when completing your first Heroic Draenor dungeon each day.
*[[Misprinted Draenic Coin]] (25) 

==Description==
I've been looking at some of the other coins in circulation plus the ones you've brought back.  Some o' these are misprints... others are just plain wrong.  Look 'ere.  This one's got two heads.  And the second one is smiling at me, where it wasn't before.

There's a bigger mystery in play here and these misprints are the key to figuring it out.  I'm gonna need even more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Ancient Heirloom Scabbard]]

==Progress==
We're on the verge of a breakthrough here.

==Completion==
Good, good!  I've got some awful suspicious suspicions about these here suspicious coins.

==Notes==
*You only get [[Misprinted Draenic Coin]] from the first random Heroic Dungeon each day.
*Only the amount of coins needed for the quest will be removed from your inventory.
*You will continue to get coins until you turn in the quest.
*You will continue to get coins even after the final quest.
