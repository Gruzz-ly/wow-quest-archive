==Objectives==
Acquire 15 [[Winterspring Blood Sample]]s and 20 gold and bring them along with a set of [[Dungeon Set 1]] Bracers to [[Deliana]] in [[Ironforge]].
* [[Winterspring Blood Sample]] (15)
* [[Dungeon Set 1]] Bracers
* Required money: {{cost|20}}

==Description==
Well met, <class>. I've something that might interest you.

I have in my possession a set of armor much like the one worn by those of your profession, but of much higher quality. I'd be willing to trade the bracers for ordinary ones in exchange for a small favor.

The blood of the [[frostsaber]]s and [[bear]]s that inhabit [[Winterspring]] has properties I'm in need of at the moment. Bring me a sizeable sample of it along with the bracers and a small amount of gold. You shall find the effort worth your while.

==Rewards==
You will receive (depending on class):
* Druid: [[Feralheart Wristguards]] or [[Feralheart Bands]] or [[Feralheart Bindings]] or [[Feralheart Wraps]]
* Hunter: [[Beastmaster's Bracers]] or [[Beastmaster's Bindings (Season of Discovery)]]
* Mage: [[Sorcerer's Bindings (Season of Discovery)]]
* Paladin: [[Soulforge Wristguards]] or [[Soulforge Bindings]] or [[Soulforge Bracers (Season of Discovery)]]
* Priest: [[Virtuous Bracers (Season of Discovery)]] or [[Virtuous Wraps]]
* Rogue: [[Darkmantle Wristguards]] or [[Darkmantle Bracers (Season of Discovery)]]
* Warlock: [[Deathmist Bracers (Season of Discovery)]] or [[Deathmist Bindings]]
* Warrior: [[Bracers of Heroism (Season of Discovery)]] or [[Wristguards of Heroism]]

You will also receive:
*6,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you brought me what I requested of you, <name>?

==Completion==
Excellent! Let's perform the trade then. It's hard to part with this excellent armor, but I'm afraid I won't be needing it any time soon.

If you're interested in performing more work for me, I might be willing to give up the rest of the pieces.

==Notes==
*You must hand in your [[Dungeon Set 1]] bracers to complete this quest. You will lose any enchantment that is on those bracers.
*If you have multiple sets of bracers (1 equipped, 1 in a bag) and turn in this quest, you will lose both sets of bracers. If you want to keep one for later, put one set in the bank.
