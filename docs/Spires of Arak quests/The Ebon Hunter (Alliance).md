==Objectives==
Collect an Organic Laser Apparatus from [[the Ebon Hunter]].
*[[Organic Laser Apparatus]] {{co|65.2|61.3|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
We're ready to set up the laser, but we're going to need more firepower to cut through this stuff.

The Ebon Hunter stalks the delta just southeast from here. It has an apparatus on its face that can fire a laser way stronger than what we have hooked up.

We need that.

You should go get that while we set up the laser.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Outpost Building Assembly Notes]]
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
By the way, that laser is very dangerous. Be careful!

==Completion==
Alright, let's put this thing to use!

==Notes==
Head southeast, but before reaching the delta, note a ghostly dread raven, [[Oskiira the Vengeful]], uphill to the east. Kill it for ... and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]], then take the convenient path directly south to the [[Forlorn Delta]] to find [[The Ebon Hunter]].
