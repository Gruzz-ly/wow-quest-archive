==Objectives==
Rescue "Tillik" from the beast [[Stonescale]] in [[Gnarlwood Pass]].
*Rescue "Tillik" {{co|48.8|51.4|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
The Parchment of Dust reads: "Put the featherless against one another so that our claws remain unsullied!" How wise the high Ravenspeaker is to foresee this day.

There is a great beast on the hillside to the west by the name of [[Stonescale]]. It has abducted one of the flock and despite our many attempts we have been unable to defeat it.

Go, prove yourself by slaying the beast and rescuing Tillik! Fulfill your destiny in the name of the Raven Mother!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
Tillik's disappearance caused great sadness to the Flock.

==Completion==
Tillik! Dear friend I'm so glad you have returned! All of the acolytes missed your witty banter after the evening chants.

<Iktis looks back towards you>

Yes, now your great test is done. You have fulfilled the requirements of The Parchment of Dust!

==Notes==
Just uphill to the south is [[Stonescale]], a basilisk. Kill it and loot [["Tillik" of the Flock]] from its corpse.
