==Objectives==
Speak with [[Shadow-Sage Iskar|Shadow Sage Iskar]] in [[Veil Terokk]].

==Description==
We must begin preparations for the Talon King's return.

From within this realm, I can travel quickly to Veil Terokk.

You, however, should be returned to the other side. You are powerful, and will attract unwanted attention.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|38}}
*1450 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Completion==
Excellent work. Ishaal and Zellek have already begun the rites.

==Notes==
On the other side, pick up [[Power Unearthed]] before heading out. Do that chain before heading back to Veil Terokk.
