==Objectives==
Speak to [[Shadow-Sage Iskar]] and convince him to let [[Jasper Fel]] free.
*Shadow-Sage Iskar convinced {{co|46.5|45.6|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
These wretched creatures captured me while I was scouting the area. Now that you're here, commander, we could really use your help back at base.

Oh, and any way you could convince your... friends... to let me go?

They, uh... won't let me leave.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|38}}
*1450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I had really hoped to have given you a better impression when you came out here.

==Completion==
Now, uh... could we maybe forget this little incident happened, commander?

Bodrick and the other agents would never let me live this down.

==Notes==
''Speak with Shadow-Sage Iskar:''
:Good to see you again, <name>.
:I knew you couldn't let the Adherents run free - not after witnessing what they did in [[Aruuna]] and [[Veil Shadar]].
''{{gossip|Your prisoner is with me. He means your people no harm.}}''
:{{text|yell|Shadow-Sage Iskar|Let the prisoner go. It's master has earned a favor from us.}}
