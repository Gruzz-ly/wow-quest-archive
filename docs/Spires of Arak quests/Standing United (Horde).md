== Rewards ==
You will gain the follower: [[Dark Ranger Velonara]]

== Completion ==
The Shattered Hand and their allies are dangerous, commander. No offense, but I don't trust your standing forces to keep a future assassin from slipping in unnoticed.

I would like to volunteer myself to join your forces so I can keep a close watch on enemy movements. We cannot risk your untimely death - too much rests on your shoulders.
