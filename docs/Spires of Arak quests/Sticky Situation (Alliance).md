==Objectives==
Retrieve 5 Submerged Batteries.
*[[Goblin Battery]] (5)

==Description==
A squadron of arakkoa spotted us while we were en route to the excavation site and took out our caravan. My brother made it to safety in the chaos.

Lucky son of a tinker.

I can't leave without the batteries for our drill, but they all fell into the bog and I can't even get them to budge.

Any chance you could retrieve them for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 XP

==Progress==
Any luck?

==Completion==
You're a lifesaver! Let's get these to the excavation site.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Safety Measures (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Kill anything that moves: [[Agitated Piglet]]s, [[Surly Bogwallow]]s, [[Putrid Mandragora]], [[Putrid Axebeak]]s, and [[Electrified Stingtail]]s. Submerged batteries are, well, submerged in pools of water. Off to the east of the quest area, the [[Stingtail Nest]] vignette plays out. Kill off a few wasps (they'll come in a swarm!) to summon [[Sunderthorn]], who can be looted for [[Stingtail's Toxic Stinger]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]]. Also, just west of the Stingtail Nest vignette, the Spires of Arak [[Mysterious Flower (Spires of Arak)|Mysterious Flower]] is found next to a loggable tree.

At the very north end of the quest area is rare mandragora [[Festerbloom]].
