==Objectives==
Administer the Spiresalve to [[Lunzul]] in [[Axefall]].

==Description==
Commander, we're in luck. The antidote recipe is fairly simple.

I was able to make a small amount with what I had on me. You should take it to Lunzul before it's too late. It should keep her alive long enough for me to make more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Outpost Building Assembly Notes]] and {{cost|1|38}}
* 1450 XP

==Completion==
By da spirits... me head be hurtin'...
