==Objectives==
Stomp out the three Sethekk Ritual Circles in [[Sethekk Hollow]].
*Southern Ritual stomped out {{co|69.0|41.8|Spires of Arak}}
*Central Ritual stomped out {{co|67.5|40.6|Spires of Arak}}
*Northern Ritual stomped out {{co|67.0|38.3|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
My return to this world is unwilling. I could not defeat this curse, and long ago resigned myself to rest in darkness.

The Sethekk are performing blood rituals to draw me back and bind me to Sethe's will. Should they succeed, [[Sethe]] would have me draw a dark cloak across the horizon, and bathe the world in his blood.

Disrupt their rituals and set me free. Then, together, we shall make sure that Sethe remains dead.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 572 belts|Cragplate Girdle|Shadowveil Cord|Ravenchain Belt|Skysinger Belt}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Completion==
Ah... I feel their grip slipping.

Thank you, mortal.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Servants of a Dead God]] and [[The False Talon King]] before heading out.

Back to the northeast. Start killing arakkoa and look for big ~10-yard diameter ritual circles on the ground. Run over them repeatedly until they're stomped out. Just uphill from the southern ritual circle is [[Talon King Ikiss]]. He has the same area of effect move now that his Outland version in Auchindoun did, though this version won't one-shot at-level players. Still, kite him around the central pillar and do break line-of-sight when he's about to finish the cast. Once Ikiss is dead, interact with the Heavy Bangle on the altar to pick up [[Lithic's Gift]]. Hold on to that quest for now and finish up these first.

Head north to stomp out the central and northern ritual circles as well.

Turn in northeast of Talon Watch, due east of where [[Kalos the Bloodbathed]] is in [[Sethekk Hollow]].
