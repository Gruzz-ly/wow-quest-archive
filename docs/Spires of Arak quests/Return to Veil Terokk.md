==Objectives==
Speak with [[Reshad]] in [[Veil Terokk]].

==Description==
<A small note is tied to the kaliri's foot.>

"Percy should have brought with him a basket of goods, assuming he didn't dump it off somewhere along the way. The contents are a token of my gratitude and an apology for the altercation with your scout.

I must urge you to return to Veil Terokk so we may press forward with our plans.

- Reshad"
