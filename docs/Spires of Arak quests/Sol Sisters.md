==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Sol-Shaper Veoryx.jpg|Veroyx and Krashyx|The twin Sol-Shapers}}
Slay Sol-Shaper Veoryx and Sol-Shaper Krashyx.
*[[Sol-Shaper Veoryx]] slain {{co|32.8|28.8|Spires of Arak}}
*[[Sol-Shaper Krashyx]] slain {{co|32.1|25.6|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
When I was still a guard in [[Skyreach]], I was tasked with protecting the sisters Veoryx and Krashyx.

They were prodigies. At an age when most sun acolytes could barely read, the sisters conjured familiars of pure sunlight to illuminate their textbooks in the small hours.

Now they unravel the secrets of Apexis technology, and their excavation has just breached two ancient chambers.

Enter those chambers and cut down the sisters before they reap the terrible rewards of their discovery.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
<The Sol-Shapers are using their power to awaken these ancient Apexis constructs.>

==Completion==
<The core of this slumbering construct begins to hum softly.>

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Kura the Blind|The sol-shapers will be severely weakened in those caves, but do not underestimate them!}}

Pick up [[Hardly Working]] and [[Legacy of the Apexis]] before heading out.

Kill constructs and free slaves, then head uphill. Don't bother entering the burrow at ground level, unless looking for more slaves to free or constructs to kill.

On the top level of the area, head north to find [[Sol-Shaper Krashyx]] in the room.
:{{text|say|Sol-Shaper Krashyx|How dare you challenge the will of Rukhmar!}}
Finish her off:
:{{text|say|Sol-Shaper Krashyx|You will... burn...}}
Before heading south to find Veoryx, exit Krashyx's room, and follow the ledge to the northeast. On the other side of the ridge is rare [[basilisk]] [[Stonespite]], which drops the [[Stonespite Scale Leggings]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]].

After killing the basilisk, run back down to the middle level and follow the trail south and enter the cave on that level. All the way in the back, find [[Sol-Shaper Veoryx]] channeling something at an [[Inactive Apexis Destroyer]].
:{{text|say|Sol-Shaper Veoryx|The secrets of the Apexis will be revealed to us!}}
Finish her off.
:{{text|say|Sol-Shaper Veoryx|Sister...}}
Turn in to the [[Inactive Apexis Destroyer]] in the middle of the room.
