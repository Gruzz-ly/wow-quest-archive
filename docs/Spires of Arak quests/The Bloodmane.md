==Objectives==
Slay Huntmaster Sorrowfang and 10 Bloodmane Razorclaws.
*[[Bloodmane Razorclaw]] slain (10)
*[[Huntmaster Sorrowfang]] slain {{co|57.4|57.5|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
We had just arrived and begun the service of the headless fowl when the Bloodmane attacked out of nowhere.

Clearly, this means that the Raven Mother wishes to test the worthiness of her children. Fear not, we are steadfast and will fervently continue our prayers regardless of what may come!

<[[Ravenspeaker Sekara|Sekara]] leans in and whispers to you>

Although, if you can get rid of the Bloodmane and their leader that would be a blessing as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 575 bracers|Shadowveil Wristwraps|Cragplate Wristwraps|Ravenchain Wristwraps|Skysinger Wristwraps}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
The Bloodmane will not shake our faith.

However, if you could kill a few more it would make it easier for the Raven Mother to hear our prayers.

==Completion==
''On approach to turn in:''
:{{text|say|Vakora of the Flock|Kawww! By the Raven Mother's shadow! How can such a slaughter have happened to us?}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Krikka|Hold to your faith, scribe! Remember the lesson in the Scroll of the Dark Dawn, "Ravens of the flock should stay together." Once the Raven Mother has returned and her children are in the nest then we will truly be safe!}}
:{{text|say|Vakora of the Flock|Kwaaa, Of course sir.}}
Your strength has given us time to rest and continue our rituals.

May the Raven Mother ever keep you in her shadow.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Words of the Raven Mother]] before heading out.

Razorclaw saberon are on all sides. Dead Ravenspeaker Initiates have Ravenspeaker Scrolls on the ground a yard or two away from them. Huntmaster Sorrowfang spawns to the southeast and patrols about 100 yards away.
