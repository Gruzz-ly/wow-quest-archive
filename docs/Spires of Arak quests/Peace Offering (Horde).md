==Objectives==
Deliver the Crate of Cactus Apple Surprise to [[Dusk-Seer Irizzar]] in the [[Spires of Arak]].
*Peace offering delivered
*[[Crate of Cactus Apple Surprise]] (provided)

==Description==
We need allies amongst these spires, and quickly. Commander, I believe it would be wise if you sought out aid.

There is a lone arakkoa outcast southeast of here living near a ravager nest. The ravagers do not attack him - I suspect he has information on the beasts we may be able to use.

I have our last crate of cactus apple surprise ready for you. It is our best shot, <sir/madame>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|90}}
* 7260 XP

==Completion==
I believe we can come to an arrangement, savior of Skettis. But first...
