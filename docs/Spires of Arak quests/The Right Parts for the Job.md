==Objectives==
Use the G-14 Buster Rocket near Broken Shredders to retrieve Serviceable Gears.
*[[Serviceable Gear]] (16)
*[[G-14 Buster Rocket]] (provided)

==Description==
Uncle Krixel's a tough one but he won't be going anywhere on foot with his leg broken.

He has a [[flying machine]] he brought in from [[Azeroth]] that can fly us out of here. Problem is, the engine's busted.

I'll need some parts to fix the thing and those broken [[shredder]]s just outside of town should have what we need. We don't have time to break them down by hand so just use this rocket launcher and blow 'em apart. Anything that survives the blast should be strong enough to use on the engine.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 575 boots|Fungal Resistant Slippers|Fungal Resistant Workboots|Fungal Reisistant Chainmail Boots|Fungal Resistant Plate Boots}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|20}}
*14650 XP

==Progress==
Got any parts for me?

==Completion==
Great work, <name>!

Give me some time and I'll have this thing ready to roll out!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Skimming Off the Top]] and [[Field Trial]] before heading out.

Head north to the woods and use the quest item on an [[Infected Lumberjack]], who immediately grows larger and groans before dying. Head back south to find [[Broken Shredder]]s in the oil fields, so get within about 10 yards of one and use the quest item to fire a rocket at it, popping out plenty of servicable gears. Also in the area are the [[Volatile Sludge]]s, which drop the oil for Skimming Off the Top.
