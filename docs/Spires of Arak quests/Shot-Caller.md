==Objectives==
Retrieve the Apexis Interface from [[Overseer Akrath]].
*[[Apexis Interface]] {{co|33.4|30.3|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
<Solar energy courses through the slumbering constructs, their ancient servos whirring to life all around you. It is too late to shut them down now.

Outside, an arakkoa overseer bellows commands, each answered by the buzz of an Apexis beam carving away at the mountain.

That turret would make short work of the constructs - if you can command it.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
<A comfortable-looking chair with a socket in the arm rest.>

==Completion==
<The apexis interface slides into place with a satisfying click. Seems this is the seat for taking full command of the turret.

Rifling through the cushions, you find a few spare coins, which you pocket.>

==Notes==
Exit the cave and follow the trail southwest. It is possible to run up to the upper level without having to backtrack to where Krashyx was, and the switchback comes out right next to [[Overseer Akrath]]. Aggro him, and a beam of light comes from Skyreach, incinerating the Enslaved Outcast that Akrath was staring down:
:{{text|yell|Overseer Akrath|You ground-dwellers need to learn your place!}}
Finish him off:
:{{text|say|Overseer Akrath|Lowborn... wretches.}}
Loot the [[Apexis Interface]] and run across the bridge to the southeast. Just on the other side is the Overseer's Chair.

==Progression==
{{Control is King}}
