==Objectives==
Kill Venombarb.
* [[Venombarb]] slain
* Suggested players: 3

==Description==
Posted by: [[Hutou Featherwind]]

Venombarb is feared in the skies above [[Spires of Arak|Arak]], even by the [[Arakkoa|high arakkoa]].

She has made air travel difficult for our riders, preventing vital supplies from reaching [[Axefall]].

I require no proof of her demise, simply ensure her screech never again echoes among the spires.

She nests above the howling crag to the northeast.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|28|40|}}
* 18,330 [[XP]]
