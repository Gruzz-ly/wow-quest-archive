==Objectives==
Help [[High Ravenspeaker Krikka]] with the ritual of calling.
*Speak to Krikka {{co|52.1|49.9|Spires of Arak}}
*Ritual complete {{co|51.7|50.4|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
All is now in its place to begin the ritual of calling that will bring the Raven Mother back to the nest.

You have fulfilled all of the tests we have put before you so it is only fitting that you join with us and participate in the ritual.

Soon the Raven Mother herself will appear before us! Oh my feathers are tingling in excitement!

Speak to me again when you are ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 14500 XP
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Completion==
You have done much to help my little nest of forgotten ones. The poor creatures are not quite sane but with their own kin hunting them, I pity their plight.

Their flying kin, the Adherents you call them, would see my forgotten ones destroyed and my children made into slaves.

This I must not allow!

==Notes==
Reshad offers the next quest, [[On Ebon Wings]].

''On accept''
:{{text|say|High Ravenspeaker Krikka|Praise the Raven Mother, we have everything ready! Speak with me again when you are prepared to begin.}}

Speak with Krikka again:
:May the Raven Mother's shadow be upon you.
:{{gossip|I'm ready, High Ravenspeaker.}}
:{{text|say|High Ravenspeaker Krikka|It was written in the "Tome of the Falling Sands", "Time waits for no one". The Raven Mother knew we would have one who is not of the flock here for the ritual! Oh, you are truly blessed!}}
:{{text|say|High Ravenspeaker Krikki|Is everyone in their places? Good, let us begin!}}
It's another "click on the right object" quest. Stand at {{co|51.7|50.4|Spires of Arak}} in the spot where the three purple carpets leave space to show the bare ground. The choices this time, in order from north to south:
*{{text|say|High Ravenspeaker Krikka|Now, splash the flames with some of the blessed water!}} - [[Blessed Waters]]
*{{text|say|High Ravenspeaker Krikka|Quickly now, throw the sacred feathers to the winds!}} - [[Sacred Feathers]]
*{{text|say|High Ravenspeaker Krikka|We need to fill the air with a sweet smell. Put something fragrant into the fire}} - [[Aromatic Incense]]
*{{text|say|High Ravenspeaker Krikka|Now, inspire us withh a reading from the Scroll of the Ravens.}} - [[Scroll of the Ravens]]
Correct:
*{{text|say|High Ravenspeaker Krikka|Correct, you are doing fine.}}
*{{text|say|High Ravenspeaker Krikka|Perfect! Oh, we are so close to success!}}
*{{text|say|High Ravenspeaker Krikka|Very good! Did you rehearse the ritual when I wasn't looking?}}
*{{text|say|High Ravenspeaker Krikka|Well done!}}
*{{text|say|High Ravenspeaker Krikka|Yes, very good.}}

''On complete''
:{{text|say|Ka'alu|I sense one who is not of the flock. Come closer, child.}}
:''Reshad walks in from the north.''
:{{text|say|Ka'alu|You there, scrollkeeper. You are not of the ravenspeakers. Why do you stand before me?}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|Great Ka'alu, the tales of your majesty are woefully inadequate.}}
:{{text|say|Ka'alu|You flatter me, but darkness weights upon your thoughts - speak, child.}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|The Adherents of Rukhmar wield a great power. They would use it to burn us all, including your ravens.}}
:{{text|say|Ka'alu|They also subjugate my children, forcing them to fight and die. And what you might have us do?}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|Great mother, in the name of Anzu we as humbly that you lend us your wings.}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|With your help, we can extinguish the light which sets the sky ablaze.}}
:{{text|say|Ka'alu|Anzu was always meddling in the affairs of mortals. One would think I might learn from his mistakes.}}
:{{text|say|Ka'alu|Very well, scrollkeeper. My flock is yours.}}
