==Objectives==
Speak with [[Darkscryer Raastok]] near the [[Apexis Excavation]].

==Description==
What power could reduce a village to ashes in the blink of an eye? The Adherents claim it is the will of [[Rukhmar]].

A lie, obviously.

They did nothing to earn such power - in truth, they stumbled upon it rather unwittingly, in a hole in the ground.

Come and visit me near the excavation site just west of here. We must understand their technology if we are to defeat it.n

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|38}}
*1450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah yes, you've arrived just in time.

==Notes==
:''On accept''
:{{text|say|Darkscryer Raastok|See you soon! Hehehe...}}
:''Raastok vanishes in a puff of smoke, leaving a scarecrow behind.''

After picking up [[Back from Beyond]], players are ejected from the shadow world. On this side of the veil, [[Darkscryer Raastok]] offers this quest as a detour before heading back to [[Veil Terokk]].

Head west toward the [[Apexis Excavation]] and find a purple dome shield just off the road before crossing the bridge.

==Progression==
