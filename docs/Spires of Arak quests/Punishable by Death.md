== Objectives ==
Kill 8 garrison traitors.
*Traitors slain x8

== Description ==
Traitors, the lot!

You're looking at the last bastion of forces still loyal to Admiral Taylor and the Alliance.

I'll be damned if the defectors get away clean.

You look like you're ready. Show them how we deal with their kind during times of war.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 14500 XP

== Progress ==
What's your report, soldier?

== Completion ==
Well fought. For the Alliance!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Prime the Cannons]] before heading out.

Southwest of the [[Dwarven Bunker]] on the gallows is rare human [[Nas Dunberlin]], the executioner. Loot from him the [[Spoocky Scythe]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]].

Behind the [[barracks]] is a stack of cannonballs, worth five. The cannon is outside the town hall.
