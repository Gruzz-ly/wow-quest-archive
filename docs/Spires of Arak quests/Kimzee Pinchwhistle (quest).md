== Completion ==
Ya know, I've been thinking.

With uncle Krixel back that now frees me up to take some time off from running [[Pinchwhistle Gearworks|the Gearworks]] for a bit.

If you have the room in your garrison I'd be glad to come join you, I could even teach you some tricks I've learned to keep your accounts in order and the books cooked!

== Rewards ==
You will learn: Follower: [[Kimzee Pinchwhistle]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 14500 [[XP]]
