==Objectives==
Kill Ralshiara.
*[[Ralshiara]] slain {{co|50.2|59.7|Spires of Arak}}
*[[Strange Crystal Shard]] (provided)

==Description==
It was said in the Journal of the Rising Sun that eating in the mornings cannot be done without harming a few eggs.

The Bloodmane matron, Ralshiara, feasts upon sacred raven eggs for her snacks, How dare she! She must die for her sins!

Take the path south over the mountains to reach the accursed home of the Bloodmane.

Take this trinket, it fell to us from the heavens as a sign of the Raven Mother's favor and with it you might have a chance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|27|60}}
*18150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Let it be known that on this day the stranger has returned victorious from slaying the feared foe of the Flock!

Praise the Raven Mother!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Declawing The Bloodmane]] and [[The Egg Thieves]] before heading out.

Loop around [[Swarmleaf]]'s position to the southwest to enter [[Bloodmane Valley]]. Immediately after entering the valley, loop northwest uphill to find at {{co|48.9|54.7|Spires of Arak}} an [[Offering to the Raven Mother]].

Cut southwest to find [[Ralshiara]] standing in front of a den. Use the quest item to spawn a laser pointer, that Ralshiara dutifully tries to nab. It lasts for 30 sec, so use it again once the laser pointer wears off. Eggs are at the base of Tied Stakes, which Dread Raven Hatchlings are bound to, or inside dens.

At the southwestern extent of the Too Many Eggs quest area, inside a den at {{co|49.1|62.6|Spires of Arak}} is an [[Elixir of Shadow Sight]]. Find another Offering to the Raven Mother at {{co|51.9|64.7|Spires of Arak}} at the top of ahill nestled against a tree. Access this one by getting to the southeastern end of the quest area and running uphill to the east toward the den. Just before entering the den, take a left heading north up the hill. Get to the opposite side of the tree blocking the path to find the offering.

Turn back in at the [[Nest of the Ravenspeakers]].
