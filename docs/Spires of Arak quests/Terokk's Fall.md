==Description==
<Once again, Reshad's voice envelops you.> Terokk was a powerful and respected king, beloved by his people. His sages, however, were not so loyal. Hungry for control of Skyreach, they conspired against him.

*{{cost|28|40}}
*18350 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Completion==
Since that day, the sages have remained in power in Skyreach, now calling themselves the Adherents of Rukhmar and claiming to be the heralds of Her will.

==Notes==
Interact with the Effigy of Terokk:
:<A crude arakkoa effigy adorned with the relics of the old king Terokk.>
:{{gossip|Touch the bangle to witness Terokk's fall.}}
:{{text|bossemote|The Talon King's own sages betrayed him. Terokk and his allies were cast into the pools.}}
:{{text|bossemote|The accursed blood seared his flesh and tore at his mind.}}
:{{text|bossemote|As he withered, Terokk had but one concern: his daughter Lithic.}}
Head south. Lithic is found dead on the ground.
:{{text|bossemote|Seeing her broken body, Terokk despaired. He surrendered to the creeping darkness.}}
:''Terokk collapses to the ground as the screen fades to black.''
:{{text|bossemote|But in that darkness, something found him.}}
:{{text|bossemote|A strange power filled the Talon King. A presence urged him on.}}
:''On the other side of the fade, Terokk has shifted from a winged arakkoa to a cursed arakkoa model.''
The player now has access to two abilities:
#{{abilities|Darktalon Strike|Projects a wave of shadow, dealing damage to enemies in a line.|notes=0.5 sec cast|cd=0.5 sec}}
#{{abilities|Talon King's Command|Rally an Outcast Talon Guard within 10yds to fight alongside Terokk.|notes=Instant|cd=0.5 sec}}
Start killing Crazed Outcasts and rallying Talon Guards.

After killing 20 crazed outcasts:
:{{text|bossemote|Wretches driven mad by the curse thrashed about the pools in agony. But Terokk set them free.}}
After gathering five guards:
:{{text|bossemote|The strongest of his guards clung to sanity. And when the Talon King called, they answered.}}
Head south to find the Eye of Anzu on a stand at the edge of a pool near a tree. Interact with it and the screen fades to black again.
:{{text|bossemote|A strange orb peeked out from the wastes. Gazing into it, Terokk met the being that had saved him.}}
:{{text|bossemote|The Raven God Anzu gifted Terokk and his guards with dark powers. In time, they would be known as Talonpriests.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Together they would build Skettis, and protect the unwanted children of Rukhmar.}}

;On complete
:{{text|say|Reshad|As the years passed, the Talon King's health declined. Grief hung in his heart, while the cursed chewed relentlessly at his mind.}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|He began to hate this world, abandoning Skettis - even sacrificing his own people in search of a cure.}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|Hoping to rejuvenate their fading king, the Talonpriests sealed Terokk away in the shadows.}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|And that brings us to today! With the relics and the Talonpriests in place, we are aready to call upon the Talon King.}}
