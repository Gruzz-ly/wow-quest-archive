==Objectives==
Speak the password to [[Reshad]] in [[Skettis]].
*Password spoken to Reshad {{co|43.7|12.9|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
My people flee our homeland in droves. I sell trinkets to ease the journey.

But I see that you are not interested in trinkets... No, what you seek are answers.

Skettis lies just ahead. Once a great city built by [[Terokk]] as a refuge for the unwanted. Now a ruined slum.

An old storyteller lives there - a scrollkeeper named Reshad. Find him and speak these words: "Shadows gather." He will know you are a friend.

Now go. Your presence is bad for business.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 14500 XP
* +250 reputation with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
If you're here for some kind of legendary tome of unthinkable power, I'm sorry to disappoint you. I am merely a keeper of history.

I am also very busy at the moment.

==Completion==
Azik must have seen something in you. I will trust his judgment, for n-

<Reshad is interrupted as a warm gust of wind surges through the hut.>

Oh dear... they've arrived.

==Notes==
Keep heading south. On the way, you can hear something powering up and then a beam weapon is fired out from a tower in [[Skyreach]] at [[Veil Akraz]], slowly raking across it:
:{{text|say|Arakkoa Outcast|They fired on Veil Akraz!}}
:{{text|say|Arakkoa Outcast|It's just... gone...}}
:{{text|say|Arakkoa Outcast|Come, we must go!}}
Keep following the path northeast into Skettis and find [[Reshad]] and [[Percy]] on the north end of town.

''On approach''
:{{text|say|Reshad|Percy, would you hold still?! How do you expect me to read it with you fluttering about like that?}}
Speak with him:
:Eh? A traveler? It's a dangerous time to be in Skettis, you know.
''{{gossip|"Shadows gather..."}}''
:{{text|say|Reshad|"...when the raven swallows the day." Who sent you?}}

On completion:
:{{text|say|Reshad|You want to know why my people flee Arak? Look outside. Our own kin fear and revile us for this curse!}}
