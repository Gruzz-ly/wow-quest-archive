==Objectives==
Deliver the Crate of Northshire Port to [[Dusk-Seer Irizzar]].
*Peace offering delivered {{co|43.9|48.9|Spires of Arak}}
*[[Crate of Northshire Port]] (provided)

==Description==
We could really use an ally to trade with, commander.

There's an arakkoa outcast living in the middle of a ravager nest northeast of here... do you think he might ally with us? He must have some sort of secret to keeping those ravagers at bay.

I have one last crate of my Northshire Port. Maybe that will help convince him that we're friendly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|90}}
* 7250 XP

==Progress==
Welcome back!  How did things go with the arakkoa?

==Completion==
I believe we can come to an arrangement, savior of Skettis.  But first...

==Notes==
Back up the road to [[Veil Terokk]], but stop short to find [[Dusk-Seer Irizzar]] before reaching town.
