==Objectives==
Bring the Heavy Bangle to [[Lithic's Rest]].
*[[Heavy Bangle]] (provided)

==Description==
The exterior of this thick, golden bangle is marred by knicks and deep cuts. The inside bears an inscription:

"To my father, [[Terokk]]. Talon King. Hero of his people and chosen of [[Rukhmar]]."

[[Ikiss]] left insane notes about the relic scattered across his desk. Among them, one name jumps out at you: [[Lithic]]. Terokk's daughter, who was cast into the pools just before him.

Terokk built a memorial to his daughter outside the [[Broken Spire]]. Perhaps the bangle should be returned.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
Who... are you? Why have you stirred me?

==Completion==
That bracelet... I made it for father long ago... before the... fall...

THE FALL! NO! TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF ME! FATHER, WHAT ARE THEY DOING?! HELP ME FATHER, I'M FALLING!

<Lithic flails wildly at the air, seemingly caught in a memory.>

==Notes==
In [[Sethekk Hollow]] for [[Servants of a Dead God]], [[Ritual Severance]], and [[The False Talon King]], kill [[Talon King Ikiss (alternate universe)|Talon King Ikiss]] and loot the Heavy Bangle on the altar behind him, which starts this quest. Hold on to this quest until ready to turn in [[Sethe, the Dead God]].

==Progression==
