==Objectives==
Slay Malrok Thornscar in [[Veil Akraz]].
*[[Malrok Thornscar]] slain

==Description==
Those orcs got hold of [[Talonpriest Ishaal|Ishaal's]] orb, did they? That would explain the dangerous-looking fellow who crossed into this realm shortly before you.

Not everyone handles the transition as... gracefully as you did. The oaf is still grappling with his own mind, stumbling about and muttering nonsense.

Soon he will be drawn to the orb again, which would presumably lead him to [[Veil Terokk]].

Better to take him out now while he's still befuddled.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|13|80}}
* 14500 XP
* +250 reputation with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
Put the poor fool down before he hurts somebody.

==Completion==
He was a big boy, wasn't he? The fiends will make quite a feast of him.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Feast of Shadows]] before heading out.

Head southwest, killing [[fleshbeast]]s and shape-shifting [[shade]]s along the way, to reach where [[Malrok Thornscar]] is wandering about, dazed and confused. Make sure to drag the non-named mobs out of the purple circles, as they will heal when standing inside the circle.

==Progression==
