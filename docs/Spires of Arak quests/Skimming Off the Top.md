==Objectives==
Collect 4 Volatile Oil.
*[[Volatile Oil]] (4)

==Description==
That [[flying machine]] is our ticket out of here but its fuel tank is bone dry!

We're right next to the oil fields but with the infected out there we don't have time to run a line up here so we need to improvise.

The oil creatures moving next to the pumps out there are full of a highly potent mixture that I can drop right into the tank. Grab some of that oil for me and we'll be one step closer to getting out of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|20}}
*14650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do ya have that oil for me yet?

==Completion==
Yea that's the stuff!

Now I just need to connect the spark plugs and patch up a few holes and it'll be nearly in working order!

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Right Parts for the Job]] and [[Field Trial]] before heading out.

Head north to the woods and use the quest item on an [[Infected Lumberjack]], who immediately grows larger and groans before dying. Head back south to find [[Broken Shredder]]s in the oil fields, so get within about 10 yards of one and use the quest item to fire a rocket at it, popping out plenty of servicable gears. Also in the area are the [[Volatile Sludge]]s, which drop the oil for Skimming Off the Top.

==Progression==

*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
