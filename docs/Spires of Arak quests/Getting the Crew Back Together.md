==Objectives==
Revive 6 Injured Crewmen. You can also use healing spells or bandages to revive them.
*[[Injured Crewman|Injured Crew]] revived (6)

==Description==
Oh wow, the debris is all over the mountainside! The survivors won't make it if we don't do something quick. They need healing NOW!

Here, take my bandages and go patch them up or just use whatever you have on hand to get them healed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|20}}
*14650 XP

==Progress==
Did you rescue everyone you could?

==Completion==
Good work, <name>. Once Gazwitz gets his team up here we can get the crewmen back to [[Pinchwhistle Gearworks|the Gearworks]].

==Notes==
Pick up [[Clearing Out Before Cleaning Up]] before heading out.

Head downhill and start patching up injured crewmen and killing wasps. At {{co|59.6|81.3|Spires of Arak}} below deck in the forward part of the hull on the west side of the road, find the [[Spray-O-Matic 5000 XT]].

;Saving an Injured Crewman
*{{text|say|Injured Crewman|Thanks! I'm so glad to see a face that's not been covered in fungus!}}
*{{text|say|Injured Crewman|Thanks for the patch-up! Since you saved me, here's some advice: stay away from [[Pinchwhistle Point]].}}
*{{text|say|Injured Crewman|Pinchwhistle Point is crawling with the infected, I... I think the town's a lost cause.}}
*{{text|say|Injured Crewman|Thanks for the rescue, pal. That crash was rough.}}
*{{text|say|Injured Crewman|Pinchwhistle Point is completely lost. We only saw one guy who didn't look infected but we lost control of the [[zeppelin]] before we could make contact.}}
*{{Text|say|Injured Crewman|I think I broke every bone in my body. I think I even broke some bones that we don't have names for!}}
*{{Text|say|Injured Crewman|Thanks for the rescue pal. That crash was rough.}}
*{{Text|say|Injured Crewman|That was a REAAAAAALY nice explosion! Wish I wasn't in the middle of it.}}

Saved goblins will appear as [[Mother Lode Crewman|Mother Lode Crewmen]] who have new gossip
*I owe you a drink!
*Oh man, that crash was so rough that my insides are still churning.
*I thought I was never going to get back up from that crash. I really can't thank you enough!
*I owe you my life! Thanks for the help!

;On completion
:{{text|say|Mother Lode Crewman|Miss Kimzee, before we crashed we saw one survivor.  I think it might be your uncle.}}
:{{text|say|Kimzee Pinchwhistle|Uncle Krixel!?  Get outta the way, I gotta rescue him!}}
:''Kimzee hops in her hotrod and peels out, leaning on the horn the whole way.''
