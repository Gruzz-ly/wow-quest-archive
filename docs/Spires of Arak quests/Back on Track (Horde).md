==Objectives==
Speak to [[Trixxy Weldblast]] in [[Veil Zekk]].

==Description==
You're a lifesaver, I'll tell you what.

Say, how about you go on ahead to the excavation site and let my sister know I'm on my way. I'll get everything neat and tidy and go get a new cart to lug these over.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|38}}
*1450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh, Mixxy sent you? What a relief. I'm not even armed!

==Notes==
Follow the trail southeast to [[Veil Zekk]], which has fared poorly in the latest bombardment.
