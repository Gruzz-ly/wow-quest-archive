*Adherents slain (8)
*[[Windkeeper Koreyx]] slain {{co|45.3|52.8|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
Now is our time to take our fight to the Adherents!

Their terraces are impervious to everything we can use upon them except for the beam of light they control. If we can capture both of the terraces we can have each terrace fire upon the other to destroy them both!

First we need to secure the [[Windswept Terrace]] by defeating their commander, Windkeeper Koreyx.

Ka'alu has offered to take us to the terrace, speak with her when you are ready.

==Progress==
Quickly, we must not let this opportunity pass.

==Completion==
Good work The Adherents here have been weakend and now our forces can finish off those that remain.

Now, it is time for the next phase of our plan.

==Notes==
Speak to Ka'alu:
:<The Raven Mother's voice coos within your mind.>
:Do you know why I allow these accursed, forgotten children of Rukhmar to live among my flock? It is because I weep for them.
:They are trapped between two gods: one who fears and rejects them, and one who would enslave them to his dark will.
:Their only champion abandoned them long ago, and nobody has stood beside them since.
:Until you came along.
:{{gossip|I am ready to fly, Ka'alu.}}
The player and a few arakkoa hop on:
:{{text|say|Reshad|Percy, you stay here and guard the nest.}}
:''Ka'alu flys up top to the Windswept Terrace and everybody hops off.''
:{{text|yell|Windkeeper Koreyx|How dare you outcasts land on my terrace! I'll see your bodies broken on the stones below!}}
Kill everything that moves. On return to Reshad:
:{{text|yell|Reshad|You fight like a legend. Come, let us return to the sky.}}
