==Objectives==
Recover the Old Gavel from [[Skizzik]].
*[[Worn Gavel]] {{co|45.4|36.3|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
An important contact lives in the nearby [[Shadowglade]]. He is meek, but trains [[kaliri]] of monstrous size which are quite dangerous.

He once claimed they could knock a [[rylak]] out of the sky, but I'll believe that when I see it.

Skizzik is holding a valuable treasure for me. Seek him out and get him back to [[Veil Terokk]] if you can. At the very least, recover the gavel I entrusted to him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|40}}
*14500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
Any word on Skizzik?

==Completion==
I see. Well, at least the gavel is safe.

As you may have guessed, it is another of the Talon King's relics.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Talon Watch (quest)]] and [[Last of the Talonpriests]] before heading out, but hold on to Talon Watch while working on the quests at Shadowglade.

Take the north road out of [[Veil Terokk]] to reach [[Shadowglade]]. [[Skizzik]]'s hut is off the road to the left, but he didn't make it:
:<Hooks have been run through his limbs, and a Shattered Hand insignia carved into his beak.
:It seems the orcs found him first.>
:{{gossip|Search him for the gavel.}}
After acquiring the gavel, Skizzik's corpse offers [[Mother of Thorns]], and run south a few yards and interact with the [[Kaliri Egg]] to pick up [[Ikky's Egg]]. Interact with the egg to hatch [[Ikky]], turn in, and pick up [[Baby Bird]]. Do those quests, then head northeast into Shadowglade proper to reach [[Ishaal's Hut]]. Quaff the Elixir of Shadows just outside the hut to make [[Talonpriest Ishaal]] appear. See the Last of the Talonpriests article for more info. Don't bother turning in until getting sent back after completing the next two quest hubs.
