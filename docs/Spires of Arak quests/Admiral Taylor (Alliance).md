From one commander to another... thank you.

We've been through a lot together, haven't we, <name>? [[Vashj'ir]]... the [[Jade Forest]]. [[Lion's Landing]]...

I am truly honored that I could end my journey by your side.

== Notes ==
Head south out of the wall to [[Admiral Taylor's Farm]]. There, Admiral Taylor and a whole bunch of dead workers/villagers are in the field. Taylor's spirit is strung up on some kind of necromantic structure in the middle of the field.
:{{text|yell|Admiral Taylor|Hero, help me down from here. We don't have much time!}}
:{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|Ephial betrayed me. He slaughtered my men and turned them against -}}
:{{text|say|Ephial|You have heart, Taylor. I'll give you that.}}
:{{text|say|Ephial|I suppose there's not much point in disguises any more.}}
:''Ephial transforms from a standard male human to a [[necromancer]] model!''
:{{text|say|Ephial|Now, Admiral, it is time to finish what I started.}}
:''Ephial casts a spell, and all of the dead corpses in the field start flying about, circling closer to Taylor's spirit. They combine to form [[Soulscythe]]!''
:{{text|yell|Ephial|Rise, and carry out my will!}}
Aggro it:
:{{text|say|Soulscythe|I will tear you and your garrison apart.}}
At 20%:
:{{text|say|Soulscythe|A soldier's duty... is never done.}}
Finish it off:
:{{text|say|Soulscythe|Your time... will come.}}
:{{text|say|Ephial|Very well. I'll finish you myself.}}
At 50%:
:{{text|say|Ephial|I turned the Admiral's "followers" against him. Perhaps I shall pay your garrison a visit next?}}
Finish him off:
:{{text|say|Ephial|The dark one promised me so much... if I succeeded...}}
:{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|You've done it. We are free!}}
Taylor's spirit survived, somehow. Turn in to it.

''On complete''
: ''[[Jasper Fel]] runs up.''
:{{text|say|Jasper Fel|Commander, are you alright?}}
