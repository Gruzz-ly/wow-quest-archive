==Objectives==
Speak to [[Ravenspeaker Sekara]] in the [[Ravenskar]].

==Description==
Our dear brother Sekara went to the Ravenskar with some of the flock to enact the great ritual of purification.

Noone has been sent back to the nest for supplies in the past day; caught up in prayers I suppose.

I would go check on him but I need to make sure the scribe didn't mess up her transcription of my latest sermon. Could you do it? I'll be there in... well, who knows...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|38}}
*1450 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Completion==
At last, our prayers to the Raven Mother have been answered!

==Notes==
Before leaving town, a chest containing [[Relics of the Outcasts]] is found on the north wall. Get up on the hill north of the wall with a tree in range. Jump on a branch of the tree, get towards the center, then jump between the two upright branches closest to the wall. Players will likely get stuck, but can jump up and forward a few times to get free and land on the wall.

Head southeast. Along the way, [[Swarmleaf]], Keeper of the Hive, is found just off the path to the right. The ancient drops the [[Stave of Buzzing Bark]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]]. Behind where the ancient spawns, 

Keep following the trail to the southeast to reach [[Ravenskar]].
