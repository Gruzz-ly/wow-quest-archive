Slay 5 Shadeback Ravagers and the Shadeback Thornmother.
*[[Shadeback Ravager]] slain (5)
*[[Shadeback Thornmother]] slain {{co|44.4|37.6|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
<Beneath Skizzik's outstretched hand, letters are scrawled into the dirt:

t h o r n

m o t h e r

[[Ravager]]s brought in by the Shattered Hand have taken over the aviary and are breeding fast. If left alone, they could be swarming the entire area - including Veil Terokk - in a matter of days.>

("Shadeback Thornmother: Slay her and her ravagers.")

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 578 trinkets|Prickly Shadeback Thorn|Thornmother Eye|Oversized Shadeback Talon}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Completion==
Shame about Skizzik's aviary. That's where Percy came from. Skizzik wasn't interested in the "runts" after he started breeding the big ones full-time.

To be honest, I never liked those monstrous things.

==Notes==
At [[Shadowglade]] for [[The Kaliri Whisperer]], after looting [[Skizzik]] of the [[Worn Gavel]], his corpse offers this quest. Pick up and complete [[Ikky's Egg]] and pick up [[Baby Bird]] before heading out.

Head just south to start killing ravagers and looting ravager grubs. Turn in Baby Bird, then head northeast into Shadowglade proper to reach [[Ishaal's Hut]]. Quaff the Elixir of Shadows just outside the hut to make [[Talonpriest Ishaal]] appear. See the Last of the Talonpriests article for more info. Don't bother turning in until getting sent back after completing the next two quest hubs.
