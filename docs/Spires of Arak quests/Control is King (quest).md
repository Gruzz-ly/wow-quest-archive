==Objectives==
Bring the Apexis Interface to [[Darkscryer Raastok]] in [[Veil Terokk]].
*[[Apexis Interface (1)]] (provided)

==Description==
Apexis technology is fascinating, isn't it? Machines powered by [[solar energy]]. Energy which itself has been imbued with magic!

Simply brilliant!

Ah, but there's always a catch. And I think you may have found it.

Bring the interface device back to Veil Terokk, will you? I'll be along shortly with the Apexis cores.

If my theory is right, we may be able to turn the Adherents' own weapon against them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|38}}
*1400 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the device?

==Completion==
It will take some time, but this may be the key to our victory.

==Notes==
Fly back to [[Veil Terokk]]. At this point, players should have four quests to turn in: [[The Kaliri Whisperer]], [[Mother of Thorns]], [[Back from Beyond]], and this quest.

==Progression==
