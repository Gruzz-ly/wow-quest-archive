==Objectives==
Interrogate Shattered Hand orcs in the [[Harvesting Pits]] to find out the name and location of "G.V.".
*Orcs interrogated (10)
*Name and location of G.V. learned
*[[Vial of Wracking Poison]] (provided)

==Description==
G.V.? We need a name and a location. Not damned initials.

<Velonara pulls out a small vial.>

This is my last vial of wracking poison. We use it to extract information from prisoners. It is... potent.

Coat your weapon with it and head into the Shattered Hand camp just ahead. Engage them as normal and demand answers - the poison will take care of the rest. I've had enough of these orcs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 14520 XP

==Completion==
This Gardul Venomshiv is as good as dead.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Extrinsic Motivation (Horde)]] before heading out.
