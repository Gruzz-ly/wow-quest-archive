==Objectives==
Speak to [[Dilbert Tinkertoss]] in [[Veil Zekk]].

==Description==
Now that the batteries are out of the bog I can radio in some more copters to take them to camp.

I'll stay here until they arrive, but you should go ahead to my brother Dilbert and let him know what happened. He must be worried sick!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|38}}
*1450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh, thank goodness. I don't even have any weapons!

==Notes==
Follow the trail southeast to [[Veil Zekk]], which has fared poorly in the latest bombardment.
