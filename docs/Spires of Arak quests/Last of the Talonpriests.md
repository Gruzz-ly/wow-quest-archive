== Objectives ==
Drink the Elixir of Shadow at [[Ishaal's Hut]] in the [[Shadowglade]].
*Elixir of Shadows imbibed {{co|48.0|34.7|Spires of Arak}}
*[[Elixir of Shadows (Draenor)]] (provided)

== Description ==
Talonpriests live among us in secret, guarding the rites of the Talon King's return.

The Adherent proclamation you acquired in [[Skettis]] revealed two of them living in the Shadowglade to the north. Orcs have moved into the region, and the Adherent's beam weapon left [[Veil Akraz]] a smoking crater.

As you can see, my people are beset by enemies on all sides.

[[Talonpriest Ishaal]] survived and is in hiding. Drink this elixir near his hut to peer into the shadows and make contact with him.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 14500 XP
* +250 reputation with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

== Completion ==
Hm, not what I was expecting when I heard that [[Shadow-Sage Iskar|Iskar]] was sending help.

No matter. You'll have to do.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Talon Watch (quest)]] and [[The Kaliri Whisperer]] before heading out, but hold on to Talon Watch while working on the quests at Shadowglade.

Take the north road out of [[Veil Terokk]] to reach [[Shadowglade]]. [[Skizzik]]'s hut is off the road to the left, but he didn't make it:
:<Hooks have been run through his limbs, and a Shattered Hand insignia carved into his beak.
:It seems the orcs found him first.>
:{{gossip|Search him for the gavel.}}
After acquiring the gavel, Skizzik's corpse offers [[Mother of Thorns]], and run south a few yards and interact with the [[Kaliri Egg]] to pick up [[Ikky's Egg]]. Interact with the egg to hatch [[Ikky]], turn in, and pick up [[Baby Bird]]. Do those quests, then head northeast into Shadowglade proper to reach [[Ishaal's Hut]]. Quaff the Elixir of Shadows just outside the hut to make [[Talonpriest Ishaal]] appear.
