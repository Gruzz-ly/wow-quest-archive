== Objectives ==
Use the Firebomb Plunger then ride on Kimzee's Flying Machine.
*Plunger Activated {{co|58.5|92.2|Spires of Arak}}
*Ride on Kimzee's Flying Machine {{co|58.9|92.8|Spires of Arak}}

== Description ==
Alright <name>, we've saved as many as we could but now we need to make sure this disaster doesn't spread any further.

The firebombs are wired up and ready to go.

[[Kimzee Pinchwhistle|Kimzee]] just finished work on the [[flying machine]] so we're ready to ride back to the [[Pinchwhistle Gearworks|Gearworks]] as soon we're finished.

You've done all the hard work so I think you should get the honors of triggering it.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
* [[Salvage Yard, Level 1]]
* {{cost|14|20}}
* 14650 XP

== Progress ==
Use the plunger next to Rivett, watch the fireworks, then interact with the flying machine next to Kimzee.
: ''Kimzee takes the pilot's seat while Krixel and the adventurer take the passenger seats.  The other goblins run over and leap onto the plane, grabbing hold where they can.''
:{{text|say|Kimzee Pinchwhistle|This thing wasn't built with this many passengers in mind, so just find a place and grab on. Hope you have a strong grip!}}
: ''The flying machine successfully takes off!''
:{{text|say|Kimzee Pinchwhistle|Wahoo! We're Airborne!}}
''Kimzee brings the plane in for a landing at the dock, and everyone jumps out and heads in, despawning.''

== Completion ==
<Name>, you did fantastic work.

Everyone here at the Gearworks owes you big time for what you've done for us.

Here, I want to give you a little something. Think of it as a personal token of my gratitude.
