== Description ==
Your bartender Lunzul is dying, commander. She's been poisoned and needs an antidote immediately.

One of your scouts reported seeing a Shattered Hand orc nearby recently - that's our best bet.

There is a small arakkoa camp to the east that sits near a known Shattered Hand encampment. I suggest we start our search there.

I've already spoken to your flight master about securing us a flight; every second counts.
