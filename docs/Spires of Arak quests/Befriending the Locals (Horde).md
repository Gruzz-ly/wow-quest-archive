==Objectives==
Speak to [[Dusk-Seer Irizzar]] near [[Veil Terokk]].

==Description==
We need allies desperately if we want a chance at surviving until tomorrow. We've made contact with one of the outcast arakkoa, but he refused to discuss alliances without speaking to you first.

He called himself Dusk-Seer Irrizar. You should speak with him, commander.

You can find him just southwest of Veil Terokk.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,450 [[XP]]
*{{cost|1|38}}

==Completion==
Ah, so you are the one your people spoke of so highly. We may discuss an alliance, but first...
