Place the Raven Feather in the Offering Bowl within [[Gnarlwood Pass]].
*Offering Placed {{co|48.9|48.9|Spires of Arak}}
*[[Dread Raven Feather]] (provided)

== Description ==
It is only a matter of time until the Adherents use their beams of light to destroy us all. We are badly outnumbered and can't be choosy as to who we obtain aid from. I need you to obtain help from the Ravenspeakers. Prepare yourself friend, their version of reality is... different from ours.

You will need a token of goodwill to speak with them. Take this feather and head south. You will find their banner and an offering bowl. Place the feather within and wait.

They will be watching.

You will receive:
*{{cost|1|38}}
* 1450 XP
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

== Completion ==
Ah, you come to learn the truth of things.

We will need to test your dedication first, yes!

== Notes ==
Just southeast. Place the feather in the offering bowl and [[Iktis of the Flock]] appears:
:{{text|say|Iktis of the Flock|You are not one of the flock but you leave the correct gift for the Raven Mother.}}
:{{text|say|Iktis of the Flock|You have for the moment earned my curiosity, yes. Tell me, what is it that brings you to us?}}
