==Objectives==
Venture into [[Pinchwhistle Point]] and use the Vial of Untested Serum on an [[Infected Bruiser]] or [[Infected Lumberjack]]. Return to [[Krixel Pinchwhistle]] to report the results.
* Serum Tested
* [[Vial of Untested Serum]] (provided)

==Description==
Look, I didn't tell [[Kimzee Pinchwhistle|Kimzee]] about this because I don't want to hurt her feelings, I chose not to leave Pinchwhistle Point.

See, I've been working on a serum that I think should be able to cure the infected, but when I tried to test it I got surrounded and I injured my leg during the escape.

I know I'm on the right track but I need to test it.  Do me a favor and take this vial and go try it out on one of the infected outside.

''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Krixel Pinchwhistle|Be careful with that serum, I'm not exactly sure what the effects will be.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
* 11000 XP

==Progress==
Have you completed the field test, <name>?

==Completion==
The serum did what!??!

I must have used too much growth hormone.  Possibly... the mixture just needs to be shaken prior to dosage?

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Right Parts for the Job]] and [[Skimming Off the Top]] before heading out.

Head north to the woods and use the quest item on an [[Infected Lumberjack]], who immediately grows larger and groans before dying. Head back south to find [[Broken Shredder]]s in the oil fields, so get within about 10 yards of one and use the quest item to fire a rocket at it, popping out plenty of servicable gears. Also in the area are the [[Volatile Sludge]]s, which drop the oil for Skimming Off the Top.
