==Objectives==
Recover 10 Ironcoat Cannonballs and 1 Armory Cannon.
*[[Armory Cannonball]] (10)
*[[Armory Cannon]] {{co|36.4|53.6|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
The armory is lost to the traitors. All we have left are these few cannons with no ammunition.

Soldier, I need you to recover cannonballs so we can get these things running.

Actually, one more cannon wouldn't hurt, either.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 14500 XP

==Progress==
I hope you're toting a cannon and some balls, soldier.

==Completion==
Good job, soldier.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Punishable by Death]] before heading out.

Southwest of the [[Dwarven Bunker]] on the gallows is rare human [[Nas Dunberlin]], the executioner. Loot from him the [[Spoocky Scythe]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]].

Behind the [[barracks]] is a stack of cannonballs, worth five. The cannon is outside the town hall.
