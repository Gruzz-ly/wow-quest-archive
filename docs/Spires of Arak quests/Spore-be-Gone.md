==Objectives==
Activate 6 [[Spore-be-Gone Turret]]s.
*Turret Activated (6)

==Description==
We got an emergency!

A bunch of spore drifters have infested the shore and tore up our Spore-B-Gone turrets.

We're caught with our armor off here! If we don't get those turrets back online then those spores are going to float right in to town and then we'll have another [[Pinchwhistle Point]] on our hands!

We need to get out there and manually activate them.

Well? Are you in?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|20}}
*14650 XP

==Progress==
We're working our butts off here! Whadya want?

==Completion==
Hey you got the dispenseers going again.

Nice job, pal!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Defungination]] and [[Unwanted Pests]] before heading out.

Use the quest item flamethrower on red Spore Pustules while killing [[Spore Drifter]]s and [[Fungal Hulk]]s. Spore-B-Gone turrets are small mechanical constructs on the islands with a few Costal Spores hovering around them.

Northeast of the gearworks is rare sporebat [[Blightglow]]. Immediately west of Blightglow's patrol path, on the small mountain, is a batch of [[Mysterious Mushrooms]]. From the northwest side of the mountain, at {{co|62.8|65.8|Spires of Arak}} find a path leading up to the mushrooms at {{co|63.6|67.4|Spires of Arak}} near the end of the path.
