==Objectives==
Collect 30 Fresh Charcoal from [[Draenor ancient|ancients]].
*[[Fresh Charcoal]] (30)

==Description==
So you have a trading post, huh?

I'd love to trade, toots, I really would, but my laser cannon isn't even functional right now.

I'll tell you what. See all the ancients around here? They got toasted good by the arakkoa's weapon, and they're practically walking piles of charcoal.

Bring me some charcoal to power this thing and you've got a deal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14520 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If you've got the stuff, let's talk.

==Completion==
That ought to do it! Nice work.

==Notes==
Pick up [[I See Dead Arakkoa (Horde)]] before heading out.

Kill [[Smoldering Ancient|smoldering]] and [[Ignited Ancient|ignited ancients]] for [[Fresh Charcoal]], and at the southeastern corner of the quest area, use the [[Ghostogrifier 12000]] to find [[Talonpriest Zekk]]

Defeat the ghost:
