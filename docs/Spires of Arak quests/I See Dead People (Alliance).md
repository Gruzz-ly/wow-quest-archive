==Objectives==
Retrieve Bryan Finn's Schematic from Spectral Laborers.
*[[Bryan Finn's Schematic]]
*Schematic shown to [[Bryan Finn]]

==Description==
Th... they're ghosts! All of them!

Bryan was one of my best friends. Something is clouding his mind; we need to snap him out of it and get to the bottom of this!

He was always obsessed with his work. Maybe showing him one of his schematics would help. One of the spectral laborers might have one.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'd recognize one of my schematics anywhere.

==Completion==
Thank you, friend.

==Notes==
North of Bryan Finn's position, hidden behind a hill, is a [[Lazy Spectral Laborer]] sleeping in the back of a wagon at {{co|37.1|47.5|Spires of Arak}} with a crate of [[Garrison Resources (object)|Garrison Resources]].

Kill laborers and overseers until the plans drop.

On returning with the plans:
:{{text|say|Jasper Fel|Come on, Bryan. Snap out of it!}}
Interact with Bryan:
:Where did all my workers go? They'll be working overtime to finish this.
:{{gossip|Show the schematic to Bryan.}}
:{{text|say|Bryan Finn|Wh- what happened? Where am I? Jasper... is that you?}}

==Progression==
{{Taylor's Garrison}}
