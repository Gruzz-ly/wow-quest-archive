==Objectives==
Cure 6 Infected Goblins.
*Infected Goblins Cured (6)
*[[Vial of Refined Serum]] (provided)

==Description==
The infection is getting stronger so I made some adjustments and I'm pretty sure I have the right formula now.

It should now work but it needs to have less competition with the infected blood for it to have any effect.

This means you will need to weaken them before you apply the serum for it to function properly.

The infection is getting more advanced and will soon be untreatable so we have this one shot to save as many as we can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|20}}
* 14650 XP

==Progress==
Any progress to report with that cure?

==Completion==
Yea! Great work, <name>!

I've already heard from the survivors and they're glad for this second chance at life.

You made a real difference today.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Sporicide]] and [[Preventing the Worst]] before heading out.

From the Pinchwhistle's position, head southwest to reach the fungal area, with rare infected hydra [[Jiasska the Sporegorger]]. Kill a few fungal creatures (there's another area with more of them!), then head just northwest to the bar area. Weaken the infected goblins to < 25% health, then use the quest item on them. Inside each building a spot where a ghostly Firebomb can be placed. The inn's firebomb is in the window upstairs. Also, on the shelf above the door in the bedroom of the inn is a chest of [[Campaign Contributions]]. Get on the bed, then jump from shelf to shelf to get within range of the chest.

North of the storage shed in the northern fungal area is rare fungal giant [[Mutafen]].
