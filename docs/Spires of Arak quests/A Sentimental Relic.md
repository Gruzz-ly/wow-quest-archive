==Objectives==
Bring Lithic's Gift to [[Reshad]] in [[Veil Terokk]].
*[[Lithic's Gift (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
My father's bangle rested here for ages before that imposter Ikiss stole it away.

I thank you for returning it, but I have no need for keepsakes. Take it, with my blessing.

If there are still Talonpriests loyal to the true Talon King, bring it to them. They will... know... what to do... with...

<Lithic trails off, staring blankly into the distance. Perhaps it is time to leave her to her rest.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|45}}
*3630 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
Hm? What's that you have there?

Terokk's bangle?!

This is it. This is what we've been missing! Oh, I can't believe we were so blind!

==Notes==
Save some time by running south to [[Talon Watch]] and taking the flight path back.
