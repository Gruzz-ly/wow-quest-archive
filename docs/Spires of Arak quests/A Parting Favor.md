==Objectives==
Gather 6 Spectral Essences from restless spirits inside the garrison and use them to convince Alice Finn of her fate.
*[[Spectral Essence (quest item)]] x6
*Alice Finn's mind freed {{co|37.7|51.1|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
I don't know what happened. My crew and I must have been the first to fall.

My wife, the innkeeper, is in the same stupor you found me in. I can feel it... and there are others with her.

Please, give the townsfolk peace and show their essences to my wife. That should bring her back from that cold abyss.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 14,520 XP

==Progress==
Everything is so hazy... what happened? Who are you?

==Completion==
We're... dead?

==Notes==
''On accept''
:{{text|say|Bryan Finn|Please... when you see her... tell her I love her.}}

Enter the garrison's walls and head behind the inn along the north wall to find at {{co|37.4|50.6|Spires of Arak}} a pile of [[Rooby's Roo]], which can be sifted through for [[Rooby Roo's Ruby Rollar]].

Gather six [[Spectral Essence (quest item)]], then head upstairs in the inn to find [[Alice Finn]] in a bed upstairs.
