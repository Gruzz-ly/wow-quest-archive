== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Lieutenant Willem]] at [[Southport]].

== Description ==
By the Light...

I can't believe this happened to [[Taylor]] and his men when they had a full garrison.

It's going to take everything we have to keep your outpost safe, commander.

We should get out of here. We can honor the fallen when we're safe.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|38}}
* 1450 XP

== Completion ==
We will never forget Admiral Taylor's sacrifices for the greater good.

== Notes ==
''On accept''
:{{text|say|Jasper Fel|I'll guide Admiral Taylor back to camp. See you there.}}

At Southport, Admiral Taylor's ghost has made it back, and there's a statue commemorating Taylor's life right behind him. The plaque states:

{{book|Admiral Taylor|content=In honor of Admiral Taylor

Admiral Taylor was a true hero of the Alliance. His numerous accomplishments on the battlefield serving his people will not be forgotten.

He bravely set out to establish a garrison stronghold among [[Spires of Arak|these spires]] to further the Draenor campaign, but he was cut down by his own men before his time.

May he rest in peace.
