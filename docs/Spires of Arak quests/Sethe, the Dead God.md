==Objectives==
Help Anzu defeat Sethe in the [[Broken Spire]].
*{{Au|Sethe}} slain

==Description==
Sethe is being resurrected as we speak. The ritual is still underway, leaving him in a weakened state. We must strike now.

Come, we face Sethe together.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 578 chests|Cragplate Chestplate|Ravenchain Vest|Skysinger Vest|Shadowveil Robe}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Completion==
Sethe has died twice, but his curse lives on. It seems we will never be rid of it.

==Notes==
From Anzu's postion, run northeast to reach the [[Broken Spire]]. There, amidst the backdrop of Sethe's original bones, the Sethekk are trying to raise him again. A boss-level skeletal wind serpent, players do not attack Sethe directly. Instead, defeat all of the arakkoa and other creatures in the area, as Anzu will do the heavy hitting.

Turn in southwest at [[Lithic's Rest]], where the [[Memory of Lithic]] is waiting to turn in to for [[Lithic's Gift]]. Turn in and pick up [[A Sentimental Relic]], then fly back to [[Veil Terokk]]. There, Anzu offers the next quest, [[Cult of the Ravenspeakers]].
