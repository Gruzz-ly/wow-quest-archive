==Objectives==
Speak with [[Azik]] in [[Spires of Arak]].

==Description==
I assume you're familiar with the [[arakkoa]], commander? Great, flying birdfolk. Extremely territorial.

Some, however, have withered wings - a disease, maybe. They seem to be outcast from arakkoa society. You find them now and then, squatting in forgotten ruins or peddling trinkets on the roadside.

It seems the [[Iron Horde]] has incited the arakkoa by moving into their lands, and the outcasts are fleeing in droves.

We should make contact with these outcasts - they could have valuable information.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|38}}
*1450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The arakkoa merchant looks you up and down.>

Well-equipped, aren't we? Azik is betting you are someone of importance to your people.

Come closer, friend. Speak with me for just a moment.

==Notes==
The nearest flight path is at [[Sunsworn Camp]] or [[Light's Rest]] in southeastern [[Talador]]. Run south out of Talador into the [[Spires of Arak]] via the [[Terokkar Pass]] and find Azik just off the road.

''Passing through Terokkar Pass'':
:{{text|say|Arakkoa Outcast 1|I heard [[Talonpriest Zorkra|Zorkra]] and her followers barely made it into Talador before orcs got them.}}
:{{text|say|Arakkoa Outcast 2|Perhaps we should have thrown out lot in with [[Talon King Ikiss (alternate universe)|Ikiss]]...}}
''On approach'':
:{{text|say|Azik|Ah, an exotic traveler from the north. Come, have a look at my wares!}}

==Progression==
