==Objectives==
Place 5 Firebombs within [[Pinchwhistle Point]].
*Firebombs Placed (5) {{co|56.7|91.6|Spires of Arak}}, {{co|56.3|91.6|Spires of Arak}}, {{co| 55.7|91.0|Spires of Arak}} (upstairs), {{co|56.6|90.0|Spires of Arak}}, {{co|56.4|89.5|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
Have you seen all the fungus on the buildings in Pinchwhistle Point?  It's only a matter of time 'til it releases enough spores to infest the whole coastline!

The remaining infected that are in Pinchwhistle Point will be too far gone for us to save later on, so let's do the right thing and put them out of their misery and prevent an even worse outbreak.

I made some firebombs that will burn the fungus down, but I'll need you to place them while I set up the detonator.

Are you up for it?

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 578 legs|"Super Sterlized" Blastguard Legwraps|"Super Sterilized" Blastguard Britches|"Super Sterilized" Blastguard Leggings|"Super Sterilized" Blastguard Legplates}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|20}}
*14650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm almost done here.  Have you placed all those firebombs yet?

==Completion==
Good work!

Ok I need to just finish setting up the ignition mechanism and we'll be all set.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Sporicide]] and [[Curing With Force]] before heading out.

From the Pinchwhistle's position, head southwest to reach the fungal area, with rare infected hydra [[Jiasska the Sporegorger]]. Kill a few fungal creatures (there's another area with more of them!), then head just northwest to the bar area. Weaken the infected goblins to < 25% health, then use the quest item on them. Inside each building a spot where a ghostly Firebomb can be placed. The inn's firebomb is in the window upstairs. Also, on the shelf above the door in the bedroom of the inn is a chest of [[Campaign Contributions]]. Get on the bed, then jump from shelf to shelf to get within range of the chest.

North of the storage shed in the northern fungal area is rare fungal giant [[Mutafen]].
