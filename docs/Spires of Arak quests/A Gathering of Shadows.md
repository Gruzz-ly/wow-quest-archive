''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Reshad|Almost there. Come along, Percy!}}
''Reshad takes off at a jog to the south towards Veil Terokk. As the scrollkeeper gets in range:
:{{text|say|Shadow-Sage Iskar|Raastok, I need a shroud at that dig site. Kura, back him up.}}
: ''[[Darkscryer Raastok]] leads [[Kura the Blind]] away up the north road.  Reshad greets Iskar as he covers the last few feet.''
:{{text|say|Reshad|Shadows gather...}}
:{{text|say|Shadow-Sage Iskar|Reshad! Your survived Skettis!}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|Yes, just barely. Are we late?}}
:{{text|say|Shadow-Sage Iskar|The Adherents grow bolder each day. It's all we can do to keep Veil Terokk shrouded from them.}}
:{{text|say|Shadow-Sage Iskar|Do you have the relics?}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|Yes, yes. And something unexpected, too! We have much to discuss.}}
