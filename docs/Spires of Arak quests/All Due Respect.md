==Objectives==
Retrieve the Feather of Syth and the Saga of Terokk.
*[[Feather of Syth]] {{co|50.3|36.4|Spires of Arak}}
*[[The Saga of Terokk (alternate universe)]] {{co|50.0|36.7|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
A group of Adherents came 'round just before the attack on Skettis. Disguised myself as a mushroom, I did. The fools walked right past me.

My neighbor up the road was not so lucky.

He had a fondness for texts, if I recall. Might be valuable information in his hut, if you give [[Reshad]] a moment to rummage around.

Oh, and bring one of his feathers to the shrine near [[Veil Terokk]], would you? He was such a dear, and I know it's what he'd want.

''On accept of all three:''
:{{text|say|Reshad|Ornekka, it is not safe here - the Adherents are out in full force. Come with us to [[Veil Terokk]].}}
:{{text|say|Ornekka|Oh, how sweet of you, Reshad! I never knew you cared.}}
:{{text|say|ornekka|But my old bones would only slow you down. I'll be fine here.}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|Very well. Let us proceed, <name>.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 XP
*+250 reputation with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
Here, I'll take them both for safekeeping.

==Completion==
<Reshad presses the feather into the tome before sliding it into his robes.>

We have one more stop before the wayshrine...

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Charming Deception]] [[Echo Hunters]] before heading out.

Start heading south along the path, interacting with Illusion Charms on trees and killing the resulting [[Adherent Harrier]]s. Use the bonus action button to stun the summoned Adherent and do a little free damage to it. [[Echo Hunters]] are a bit further off the path.

East of the pond is rare Draenor ancient [[Shadowbark]]. Just off the path southwest of the pond where Shadowbark was found is Syth's abode. Pluck a feather from Syth, and loot The Saga of Terokk from [[Syth's Bookcase]].
:{{text|say|Reshad|Step aside, <name>. Let us see if this fellow had anything worthwhile...}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|Mind the door, will you?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Hold off the Adherents.}}
Four waves of 2-4 adherents attack. Heal up between waves! While the attack goes on:
:{{text|say|Reshad|My, my... What a curious collection...}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|Percy, what's that you've got there? Come, now, let's see it...}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|Fifty Layers of Shadow?! PERCIVAL, YOU PUT THAT BACK THIS INSTANT.}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|Nasty bird...}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|Ah, here's something! The Saga of Terokk.}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|And he's written notes inside. Here, have a look.}}
Turn in All Due Respect and pick up [[Syth's Secret]]. before moving on. Also, behind Syth's house to the west is rare tiger [[Nightmaw]].

Keep heading south along the path. Just before it starts going uphill, three winged arakkoa are guarding the entrance to a ravager den. Inside, [[Sun-Talon Oberyx]] has found the Eye of Anzu:
:{{text|say|Sun-Talon Oberyx|So this is what the little sneak was hiding... the High Sage will be pleased.}}
Aggro Oberyx:
:{{text|say|Sun-Talon Oberyx|That wretched outcast begged for death in the end - and so will you!}}
Loot [[The Eye of Anzu]] from Oberyx's corpse, then finish up the other quests outside. Head south to the [[Terokkar Wayshrine]] to turn in.

==Progression==
{{Spires of Arak 1}}

==Trivia==
"Fifty Layers of Shadow" is a reference to the controversial erotic romance novel ''{{wp|Fifty Shades of Grey}}''. This notion is supported by Reshad's mention of "old scrolls and erotic sorcery-fiction" in the following quest, [[Syth's Secret]].
