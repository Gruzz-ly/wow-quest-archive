==Objectives==
Collect 6 Wind Serpent Wings from [[Son of Sethe|Sons of Sethe]] in [[Sethekk Hollow]].
*[[Wind Serpent Wing]] (6)

==Description==
As [[Anzu (alternate universe)|Anzu]] grappled with the curse, hatred festered within him. In time, he sought vengeance on [[Sethe]], and commanded his brood of [[dread raven]]s to slay every last [[wind serpent]].

In one bloody night, the children of Sethe were eradicated.

Sethekk cultists have discovered some way to hatch the vile serpents from their own eggs. I don't even want to know how they do it.

Bring the wings of these beasts to the Talon Shrine and present them to Anzu. This will help you to secure his favor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 XP
*+250 reputation with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
<A large bowl awaits an offering for the raven god.>

==Completion==
<As you heap the remaining wings into the bowl, you hear a voice from somewhere beyond the shadows.>

Seeeethe...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Gaze of the Raven God]] before heading out.

Southeast past the ooze area to the wind serpent area in [[Sethekk Hollow]]. Kill wind serpents and their arakkoa handlers. Nests are marked with purple columns of light coming out of them.

Just southeast of the quest area, the [[Spawn of Sethe]] vignette plays out. Kill the four [[Sethekk Serpent Tender]]s to free [[Sangrikass]], and kill the rare windserpent for a [[Moultingskin Tunic]] and some [[Garrison Resources]].

Turn in due south of the quest area at the [[Talon Altar]].
