==Objectives==
Retrieve the Weathered Wingblades and Ragged Mask.
*[[Weathered Wingblades]] {{co|41.2|16.3|Spires of Arak}}
*[[Ragged Mask]]

==Description==
<[[Reshad]] begins hastily stuffing scrolls into his robes.>

I thought I would have more time to prepare! There are powerful relics hidden out there in [[Skettis]] - if I leave without them, I may as well have died.

The first is a pair of wingblades being held by an effigy near the front gate. You likely walked right past them on your way in.

Another effigy on the east side of the ruins bears a white mask over its face.

Bring those relics to me, and their secrets shall be yours.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 560 shoulders|Skysinger Spaulders|Cragplate Shoulders|Shadowveil Mantle|Ravenchain Spaulders}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
Wingblades forged in the name of a sun god to bring freedom and glory to her children.

A mask worn by a great king who would walk among his people in disguise to know their true nature.

==Completion==
Who would expect to find these treasures draped over straw dolls, left to bake in the sun? Sometimes, the best place to hide precious things is in plain sight.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Adherents of the Sun God]] before heading out.

Head back west to the entrance of town. In the first courtyard, find the Weathered Spear on a scarecrow along the northwest wall. Gather it, then head east to the other marked point on the minimap. Along a southern wall in the easternmost courtyard, find the Ragged Mask on another scarecrow.

North of the Ragged Mask Scarecrow, head north uphill, then go west to find a small roost hidden in the hill. Inside is an effigy: [[Rukhmar's Image]], worth some [[Garrison Resources]].

Finish killing winged arakkoa and return to Reshad.
