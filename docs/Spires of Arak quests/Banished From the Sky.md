==Objectives==
Use the Eye of Anzu on 8 [[Cursed Arakkoa]].
*Cursed Arakkoa rescued (8)
*[[The Eye of Anzu#Banished From the Sky]] (provided)

==Description==
The Adherents have been casting their enemies into [[Sethekk Hollow|the hollow]] for generations.

The pools carry [[Sethe|Sethe's]] dying curse, crippling arakkoa with visions of darkness and intense pain. The mind reels, the body writhes, and the wings wither.

Most arakkoa die or go insane. Only the strongest can resist - seek them out and use the Eye of Anzu to help them to their senses.

Beware, for the worshippers of Sethe also prey on these survivors to fill their ranks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 14500 XP
* +250 reputation with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Completion==
They have suffered a fate worse than death, but at least they are free.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Hatred Undying]] before heading out.

First things first, head north into [[Sethekk Hollow]] to find rare arakkoa [[Kalos the Bloodbathed]]. Take out groups of small [[Spiteful Animate]] oozes, or run over pools of Bubbling Blood to spawn a large [[Hateful Animate]] ooze. Both kinds of oozes drop the [[Congealed Blood of Sethe]]. While doing that, look for arakkoa falling out of the sky. They will either turn into friendly Cursed Arakkoa, which can be freed, or hostile Crazed Outcasts, which must be killed.

==Progression==
