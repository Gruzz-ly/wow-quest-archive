== Objectives ==
Kill 18 Bloodmane Saberon.
*Bloodmane Saberon slain × 18

== Description ==
The Bloodmane took several of our initiates when they ambushed our ritual in Ravenskar. They must be taught that the flock will never allow such a deed to go unpunished!

We will kill one of their tribe for each of the flock that has fallen!

Head into their accursed home of Bloodmane Valley and slaughter as many of them as you can find.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 14500 XP
* +250 reputation with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

== Completion ==
The fallen would be glad to know that their murderers have been brought to justice.

Thank you, <name>. You have done the flock a great honor.

== Notes ==
Immediately after entering the valley, loop northwest uphill to find at {{co|48.9|54.7|Spires of Arak}} an [[Offering to the Raven Mother]].

Kill anything that moves, including [[Bloodmane Raider|Bloodmane raiders]], [[Bloodmane Earthbinder|earthbinders]], [[Bloodmane Gutripper|gutripper]]s, [[Bloodmane Terrorclaw|terrorclaw]]s, and even [[Ralshiara]].

Cut southwest to find [[Ralshiara]] standing in front of a den. Use the quest item to spawn a laser pointer, that Ralshiara dutifully tries to nab. It lasts for 30 sec, so use it again once the laser pointer wears off. Eggs are at the base of Tied Stakes, which Dread Raven Hatchlings are bound to, or inside dens.

At the southwestern extent of the Too Many Eggs quest area, inside a den at {{co|49.1|62.6|Spires of Arak}} is an [[Elixir of Shadow Sight]]. Find another Offering to the Raven Mother at {{co|51.9|64.7|Spires of Arak}} at the top of a hill nestled against a tree. Access this one by getting to the southeastern end of the quest area and running uphill to the east toward the den. Just before entering the den, take a left heading north up the hill. Get to the opposite side of the tree blocking the path to find the offering.

Turn back in at the [[Nest of the Ravenspeakers]].
