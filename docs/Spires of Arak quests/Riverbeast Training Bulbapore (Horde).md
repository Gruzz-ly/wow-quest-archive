Defeat Bulbapore while riding your Riverbeast-In-Training.
*[[Bulbapore]] Killed

==Description==
In the far south, in the Spires of Arak, the land is being swallowed by the mushrooms that grow underwater, and strange fungal creatures grow uninhibited.

Taking on a strange creature, like the fungal giant Bulbapore, will grant you a chance to expose your mount to unfamiliar predators.

You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (20)

==Completion==
You have returned victorious. I will bed your mount down for the night.
