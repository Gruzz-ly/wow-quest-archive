== Objectives ==
Inspect the Drafting Table and choose which outpost structure to construct.
*Use the Drafting Table
*Building selected

== Description ==
Commander <name>, it's an honor.

We're barely holding on, <sir/madame>. We have a week's supplies at best, assuming we have any troops left to supply in that time.

We have just enough material left to put up an inn or a trading post.

The inn would allow us to station reinforcements here, while the trading post would allow supply routes with the outcasts nearby.

We need your authorization for the project, commander. It's your decision.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|38}}
* 1450 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
Glory to your forces, commander.

== Completion ==
Praise the Light you're here. I thought we were going tohave to wait until a courier could reach you for a decision on this.

== Notes ==
Decision time!

Several quest forks open up after this quest. Jasper Fel sends the adventurer in [[Admiral Taylor]]'s direction in [[Old Friends (Spires of Arak)]], [[Percy]] at the gate sends players back to [[Veil Terokk]] in [[Return to Veil Terokk]], and depending on which building was chosen, [[Peace Offering (Alliance)]] is available at the Trading Post and [[Attempted Murder (Alliance)]] is available in the inn. Beyond that, some a wanted poster also provides some quests.
