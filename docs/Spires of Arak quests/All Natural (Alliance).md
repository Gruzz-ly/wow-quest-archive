Collect 30 Fresh Charcoal from [[Draenor ancient|ancients]].
*[[Fresh Charcoal]] (30)

==Description==
Oh, you have a trading post?

Fantastic!

Let's make a deal. You help me power up my laser cannon, and I'll trade some of this... thermo... ultra... obsidiglass with you for some weapons.

The ancients all around here are practically made of charcoal after the arakkoa weapon hit, you should go get some of that!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Blasted refurbished goblin tech is always malfunctioning.

==Completion==
That's quite a bit of charcoal. Nicely done!

==Notes==
Pick up [[I See Dead Arakkoa (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Kill [[Smoldering Ancient|smoldering]] and [[Ignited Ancient|ignited ancients]] for [[Fresh Charcoal]], and at the southeastern corner of the quest area, use the [[Ghostogrifier 12000]] to find [[Talonpriest Zekk]]
