==Objectives==
Gather 20 Congealed Blood of Sethe from [[Sethekk Hollow|Sethekk Holllow]].{{sic}}
*[[Congealed Blood of Sethe]] (20)

==Description==
The blood of the dead god [[Sethe]] lingers in the pools here. And with it, his hatred of [[Rukhmar]] and [[Anzu (alternate universe)|Anzu]].

So strong was this hate that it animates the blood even now, eons after he was slain by his fellow gods.

I need the congealed blood that holds those spiteful creatures together.

There is nothing the Adherents fear more than the power of this curse - what if we could brandish it against them?

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 572 boots|Cragplate Warboots|Shadowveil Treads|Ravenchain Sabatons|Skysinger Boots}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
My attempts to bottle the booled blood have failed. It breaks down and dissipates when it is taken away from Sethe's bones.

But I have high hopes for this congealed form!

==Completion==
Excellent, ecellent. Go ahead and drop those directly into the cauldron.

''On complete''
:{{text|say|Kazu|Thank you, kindly. I shall notify you of my results later.}}

==Notes==
Pick up [[Banished From the Sky]] before heading out.

First things first, head north into [[Sethekk Hollow to find rare arakkoa [[Kalos the Bloodbathed]]. Take out groups of small [[Spiteful Animate]] oozes, or run over pools of Bubbling Blood to spawn a large [[Hateful Animate]] ooze. Both kinds of oozes drop the [[Congealed Blood of Sethe]]. While doing that, look for arakkoa falling out of the sky. They will either turn into friendly Cursed Arakkoa, which can be freed, or hostile Crazed Outcasts, which must be killed.
