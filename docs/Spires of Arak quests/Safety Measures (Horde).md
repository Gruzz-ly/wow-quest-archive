==Objectives==
Kill 15 bog denizens.
*Bog denizens slain (15)

==Description==
The batteries I lost in the bog have really ticked off the wild creatures. It's going to be impossible to remove them without fighting through who knows what.

If you're up for it, why don't you 'take care' of any critters you come across? I don't want some giant beast stalking me back to the excavation site.

I'll make it worth your while.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14520 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Now that's what I'm talking about. You're tough as nails.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Sticky Situation (Horde)]] before heading out.

Kill anything that moves: [[Agitated Piglet]]s, [[Surly Bogwallow]]s, [[Putrid Mandragora]], [[Putrid Axebeak]]s, and [[Electrified Stingtail]]s. Submerged batteries are, well, submerged in pools of water. Off to the east of the quest area, the [[Stingtail Nest]] vignette plays out. Kill off a few wasps (they'll come in a swarm!) to summon [[Sunderthorn]], who can be looted for [[Stingtail's Toxic Stinger]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]]. Also, just west of the Stingtail Nest vignette, the Spires of Arak [[Mysterious Flower (Spires of Arak)|Mysterious Flower]] is found next to a loggable tree.

At the very north end of the quest area is rare mandragora [[Festerbloom]].
