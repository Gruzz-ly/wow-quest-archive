== Objectives ==
Kill the Horrific Aberration in the basement of the inn.
*[[Watch Commander Branson|Horrific Aberration]] slain {{co|37.5|51.0|Spires of Arak}}

== Description ==
I... I remember now. [[Watch Commander Branson]] told us to stay in the inn... he said we would be safe here.

Then...

Then that THING broke through and slaughtered everyone!

The last thing I remember seeing was it descending into the larder.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: 
*[[Watch Commander Branson's Lapel]]
*{{cost|10|40}}
* 10890 XP

== Progress ==
Is the creature dead?

== Completion ==
I will convince the others of our fate. There's no denying it anymore.

==Notes==
Downstairs to the first floor, run to the back of the greatroom and take a right next to [[Tickle Bubblefizz]] to head downstairs to the larder, past [[Miril Dumonde]]'s objections:
:{{text|say|Miril Dumonde|Get out of here! Only staff is allowed in the larder.}}
In the basement is [[Watch Commander Branson]], who is a skeleton!
:{{text|say|Watch Commander Branson|The villagers were easy. You're next.}}
At 20%:
:{{text|say|Watch Commander branson|You will not interrupt the master's plans!}}
Finish him off:
:{{text|say|Watch Commander Branson|I was promised... eternal life...}}
Head back upstairs to the kitchen, where Alice Finn has relocated:
:{{text|say|Alice Finn|Is... is it dead?}}

==Progression==
