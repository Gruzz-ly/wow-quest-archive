==Objectives==
Use the Overseer's Chair to take control of the Apexis Turret and slay 20 Apexis Destroyers and 30 Adherent Sol-Shapers.
*[[Apexis Destroyer]] slain (20)
*[[Adherent Sol-Shaper]] slain (30)

==Description==
<Apexis constructs are about to emerge from their ancient chambers on a warpath. The arakkoa are sure to send more sol-shapers to support them.

The interface and the turret hum in soft resonance.>

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 568 legs|Cragplate Legguards|Shadowveil Leggings|Ravenchain Leggings|Skysinger Breeches}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Completion==
Ahh, well done. Even with my condition, I could sense the carnage from here.

It must have been quite a show, kah-ha-haww.

==Notes==
Hop in the chair. It has two abilities:
#{{abilities|Solar Beam|Fire a beam at the ground for 4 sec, searing enemies near the impact area.|notes=Instant|cd=4 sec}}
#{{abilities|Solar Flare|Fires a ball of solar energy that collies and explodes, dealing damage in an area.|notes=Instant.|cd=1 sec}}
Use Solar Beam for the Apexis Destroyer constructs, and Solar Flare for the groups of Sol-Shapers flying about. If left alone, both sets of enemies will do enough damage to destroy the Apexis Turret!
Once done, head back to where Raastok and Kura the Blind were to turn in.

==Progression==
{{Control is King}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2014-12-03|bluenote=The Apexis Turret should no longer be able to accidentally damage players.}}
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
