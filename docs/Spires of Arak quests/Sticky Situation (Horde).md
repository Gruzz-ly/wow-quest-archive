==Objectives==
Retrieve 5 Submerged Batteries.
*[[Goblin Battery]] (5)

==Description==
We were hauling batteries to the excavation site and I crashed my freakin' car!

My sister didn't even look back. I took the turn a little fast, so what? It happens!

Point is, the batteries went flying everywhere and I'm in no condition to lift them out.

So what do you say? Wanna help me out?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14520 XP

==Progress==
Do you have the batteries?

==Completion==
You're a real doll. Let's get out of here.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Safety Measures (Horde)]] before heading out.

Kill anything that moves: [[Agitated Piglet]]s, [[Surly Bogwallow]]s, [[Putrid Mandragora]], [[Putrid Axebeak]]s, and [[Electrified Stingtail]]s. Submerged batteries are, well, submerged in pools of water. Off to the east of the quest area, the [[Stingtail Nest]] vignette plays out. Kill off a few wasps (they'll come in a swarm!) to summon [[Sunderthorn]], who can be looted for [[Stingtail's Toxic Stinger]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]]. Also, just west of the Stingtail Nest vignette, the Spires of Arak [[Mysterious Flower (Spires of Arak)|Mysterious Flower]] is found next to a loggable tree.

At the very north end of the quest area is rare mandragora [[Festerbloom]].
