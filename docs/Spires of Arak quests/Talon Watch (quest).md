==Objectives==
Bring the Eye of Anzu to [[Talon Guard Kurekk]] in [[Talon Watch]]. Speak with [[Skytalon Meshaal]] for a flight.
*[[The Eye of Anzu#Talon Watch]] (provided)

==Description==
By now you must be wondering about all of this curse business. What could distort a majestic arakkoa into... well, into this?

<Reshad drags a crooked hand through the mottled feathers about his face.>

A raven is prepped and waiting to fly you to Talon Watch. There shall your eyes be opened to the origin of this curse.

Present the Eye of Anzu to Talon Guard Kurekk. He will guide you from there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|38}}
*1450 XP
*+10 reputation with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
Reshad sent an outsider here? You must be very important... or very dangerous.

==Completion==
<Kurekk gazes at the orb.>

Is that... what I think it is?

We must get this to the Talon Altar.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Kaliri Whisperer]] and [[Last of the Talonpriests]] before heading out, but hold on to this quest for a bit, and work on the closer quests at [[Shadowglade]] first.

Once ready to head to Talon Watch, speak with [[Skytalon Meshaal]], the flight master at [[Veil Terokk]]:
:The skies are not out of reach. No, not out of reach.
:{{gossip|Fly me to Talon Watch.}}

''On complete''
:{{text|say|Talon Guard Kurekk|We shall use the orb to contact Anzu. But first, I believe its power can help us save lives here...}}
