==Objectives==
Recover Ravenspeaker Scroll Fragments.
*[[Ravenspeaker Scroll Fragment]] (8)

==Description==
We came here to perform the ritual of calling bring the return of the Raven Mother. We had distributed parts of the scroll to everyone and had just begun when we were attacked by the Bloodmane. Now most of the flock has been killed and fragments lay scattered across our homeland.

The ritual was a failure but we will not allow these mongrels to break our faith, we must continue our prayers here but we would be grateful if you can recover the scroll fragments for us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 14500 XP
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
We must have all the sacred texts! We cannot afford to leave even a signle one unaccounted for!

==Completion==
''On approach to turn in:''
:{{text|say|Vakora of the Flock|Kawww! By the Raven Mother's shadow! How can such a slaughter have happened to us?}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Krikka|Hold to your faith, scribe! Remember the lesson in the Scroll of the Dark Dawn, "Ravens of the flock should stay together." Once the Raven Mother has returned and her children are in the nest then we will truly be safe!}}
:{{text|say|Vakora of the Flock|Kwaaa, Of course sir.}}Ah! The copies of the ritual!

Praise the Raven Mother!

Hand them to me but only one at a time. We must not risk summoning the light.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Bloodmane]] before heading out.

Razorclaw saberon are on all sides. Dead Ravenspeaker Initiates have Ravenspeaker Scrolls on the ground a yard or two away from them. Huntmaster Sorrowfang spawns to the southeast and patrols about 100 yards away.
