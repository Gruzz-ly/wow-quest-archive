==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Spore Drifter]]s or [[Fungal Hulk]]s in [[Sporemist Shallows]].
*Spore Creatures slain (10)

==Description==
Those creatures out in the shallows keep busting the turrets as fast as we can get them operational.

I'm supposed to go clear them out but my blaster is completely busted; the damn thing barely can light a candle like this!

Could you do me a favor and go kill a few of those pests while I get my blaster fixed at the shop?

Just let [[Engineer Gazwitz|Gazwitz]] know you covered for me so I can get reimbursed for the repair.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|20}}
*14650 XP

==Progress==
Did you kill those pests?

==Completion==
Lemmy's gone broke down again, I take it?

Good job covering for 'em out there. I could use more workers like you!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Spore-be-Gone]] and [[Defungination]] before heading out.

Use the quest item flamethrower on red Spore Pustules while killing [[Spore Drifter]]s and [[Fungal Hulk]]s. Spore-B-Gone turrets are small mechanical constructs on the islands with a few Costal Spores hovering around them.

Northeast of the gearworks is rare sporebat [[Blightglow]]. Immediately west of Blightglow's patrol path, on the small mountain, is a batch of [[Mysterious Mushrooms]]. From the northwest side of the mountain, at {{co|62.8|65.8|Spires of Arak}} find a path leading up to the mushrooms at {{co|63.6|67.4|Spires of Arak}} near the end of the path.
