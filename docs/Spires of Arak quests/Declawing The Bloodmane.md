==Objectives==
Collect 6 Bloodclaw Shaman Paws.
*[[Bloodmane Earthbinder Paw]] (6)

==Description==
It is written in the [[Scroll of Sermons]] to "Bite the claw that strikes you."

Take the path south from here that leads over the mountain to the [[Bloodmane Valley|Bloodmane valley]] in the west. There you will find [[Bloodmane tribe|those of their tribe]] who can use a primitive form of [[magic]]. Slay them and remove their paws.

Once you have obtained a few bring them back to me in the nest so that they may be offered to the [[Ka'alu|Raven Mother]]!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Skysinger Gloves
|Cragplate Gauntlets
|Shadowveil Gloves
|Ravenchain Gauntlets
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|13|80}}
* 14,660 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
It is written in the Scroll of Sermons that the Raven Mother is not patient, and neither am I.

Do you have the paws of the Bloodmane for me?

==Completion==
Yes, these will do nicely as an offering to the Raven Mother! May she feast upon our enemies!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Ralshiara's Demise]] and [[The Egg Thieves]] before heading out.

Loop around [[Swarmleaf]]'s position to the southwest to enter [[Bloodmane Valley]]. Immediately after entering the valley, loop northwest uphill to find at {{co|48.9|54.7|Spires of Arak}} an [[Offering to the Raven Mother]].

Cut southwest to find [[Ralshiara]] standing in front of a den. Use the quest item to spawn a laser pointer, that Ralshiara dutifully tries to nab. It lasts for 30 sec, so use it again once the laser pointer wears off. Eggs are at the base of Tied Stakes, which Dread Raven Hatchlings are bound to, or inside dens.

At the southwestern extent of the Too Many Eggs quest area, inside a den at {{co|49.1|62.6|Spires of Arak}} is an [[Elixir of Shadow Sight]]. Find another Offering to the Raven Mother at {{co|51.9|64.7|Spires of Arak}} at the top of ahill nestled against a tree. Access this one by getting to the southeastern end of the quest area and running uphill to the east toward the den. Just before entering the den, take a left heading north up the hill. Get to the opposite side of the tree blocking the path to find the offering.

Turn back in at the [[Nest of the Ravenspeakers]].
