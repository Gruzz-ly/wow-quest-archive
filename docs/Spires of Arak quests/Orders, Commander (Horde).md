== Objectives ==
Inspect the Drafting Table and choose which outpost structure to construct.
*Use the Drafting Table
*Building selected

== Description ==
Commander, our status report is... regrettable.

We'll be out of supplies in a few days' time, and that's assuming we have any troops left by then.

There's just enough material left to put up an inn or a trading post.

The inn would allow us to station fresh troops here, but the trading post would open up potential supply routes with the outcasts nearby.

I've left out [[Gazlowe]]'s blueprints on the drafting table. We await your will.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|38}}
* 1450 XP

== Completion ==
Your will be done.

For the Horde!

== Notes ==
Decision time!

;Inn
:The inn will provide additional troops and boosts the morale of your forces.
:Once fully operational, the inn grants the use of [Home Away from Home] within Spires of Arak.
:{{abilities|Home Away from Home|Teleport to your Inn in Spires of Arak. Passive: You continue to gain rested XP anywhere in Spires of Arak.|notes=3 sec cast|cd=5 min}}

;Trading Post
:The Trading Post will open up trade routes with other forces, granting access to rare supplies and materials.
:Once fully operational, the Trading Post grants the use of [Smuggler's Run!] within Spires of Arak.
:{{abilities|Smuggling Run!|Summon a rare goods vendor.|cd=10 min}}

Several quest forks open up after this quest. Shadow Hunter Ukambe sends the adventurer in [[Admiral Taylor]]'s direction in [[What's Theirs is Ours]], [[Percy]] at the gate sends players back to [[Veil Terokk]] in [[Return to Veil Terokk]], and depending on which building was chosen, [[Peace Offering]] leads to  [[Attempted Murder]] when the inn has been chosen and to [[The Tinkertoss Twins]]/[[Best Deals Anywhere (quest)]] if the Trading Post had been chosen. Beyond that, a wanted poster also provides [[WANTED: Spineslicer's Husk]], [[WANTED: Keeho's Severed Paw]] and [[WANTED: Venombarb]].
