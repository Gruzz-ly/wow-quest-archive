==Objectives==
Speak to [[Filbert Tinkertoss]] in [[Murkbog]].

==Description==
Commander, two gnomish smugglers passed by while you were out - Filbert and [[Dilbert Tinkertoss]]. They were headed towards the bog to the east.

They had all sorts of drilling equipment but didn't seem to have any weapons.

What do you think of offering them protection in exchange for some of their materials?

I'll jot down where they were headed in case you decide to go.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|38}}
*1450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You're armed to the teeth! Say, would be interested in helping a wary gnome out?

==Notes==
Cut through [[Veil Terokk]] and take the [[Gnarlwood Pass]] east through the [[Nest of the Ravenspeakers]], then cut northeast, past rare boar [[Gochar]]. Head north when reaching the water to find [[Filbert Tinkertoss]] next to a crashed Transport Copter in the [[Murkbog]].
