==Objectives==
Use the Effigy of Terokk to re-live Terokk's battle with the Bloodmane. Slay 30 Bloodmane Shortfangs, 20 Mature Bloodmane saberon, and Pridelord Karash.
*[[Bloodmane Shortfang]] slain x30
*Mature Bloodmane saberon slain x20
*[[Pridelord Karash]] slain {{co|45.8|66.4|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
<As Reshad begins reciting a tale of Terokk's glory days, your eyes fall to the twin swords at the effigy's belt. They had seemed so plain in Skettis, but now they thrum with power, as if reacting to the scrollkeeper's words.> 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|28|40}}
* 18350 XP
* +250 reputation with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Completion==
That was but one of many such tales.

No arakkoa living or dead has ever compared to the Talon King. 

==Notes==
Interact with the effigy again:
:<A crude arakkoa effigy adorned with relics of old King Terokk.>
:{{gossip|Touch the wingblades to witness one of Terokk's legends.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Long ago, a Bloodmane pridelord commanded his hunters to bring him ten thousand arakkoa feathers.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Eager for the glory of battle, the young chieftain had hoped to incite a war with the arakkoa.}}
:{{text|bossemote|But the Talon King came alone, and what ensued was not a war. It was a slaughter.}}
On the other side of the loading screen, the player is in control of {{Au|Terokk}}, and players have access to one ability:
:{{abilities|Talon Strike|Pierces enemies in a line in front of Terokk, dealing high damage.|notes=0.5 sec cast|cd=0.5 sec|id=176255}}
Head west to the beach, then run northwest along the beach, killing everything that moves.

After klling enough shortfangs:
:{{text|bossemote|He moved with a grace and power matched only by the wind.}}
On hitting the Mature Bloodmane saberon quota:
:{{text|bossemote|With the sweep of his wings, he cut down even the strongest of the Bloodmane like so many blades of grass.}}
After killing Pridelord Karash:
:{{text|bossemote|Their pridelord was fierce, but he was no match for Terokk.}}
After completing all the objectives:
:{{text|bossemote|Satisifed that his message was clear, the Talon King left the Bloodmane to pick up the pieces of their broken tribe.}}
Turn in to Reshad back at Veil Terokk. No direct followups are offered at Veil Terokk, so head to [[Talon Watch]] now.
