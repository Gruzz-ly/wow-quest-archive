==Objectives==
Find [[Kimzee Pinchwhistle]] in [[Pinchwhistle Point]].

==Description==
Miss Kimzee is one tough nugget but [[Pinchwhistle Point]] is too dangerous for her to handle alone. It'll be a catastrophe for morale if our boss gets infected.

I need to get these crewmen back to [[Pinchwhistle Gearworks|the Gearworks]] so I need you to go and make sure she is alright.

Her uncle's place is the tower just on the other side of the oil fields; I think you should look for her around there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|10}}
*7330 XP

==Completion==
I have good news and bad news.

The good news is my uncle's alive! The bad news is his leg is injured and we're surrounded by infected! With my [[Kimzee's Hotrod|hotrod]] wrecked, we can't get him out of here.

==Notes==
Head south past the crash site, but cut to the southwest to find at {{co|58.3|84.5|Spires of Arak}} [[Betsi Boombasket]] in the woods. Kill her to loot [[Betsi's Boomstick]] and 20-30 [[Garrison Resources]] from her corpse. Cross east to the shore to find an [[Escape Pod]]. Interact with it to save [[Nizzix Missfire]]. He leaves [[Nizzix's Chest]] on the ground, which contains 20 [[Garrison Resources]].
Further south, at {{co|59.2|90.6|Spires of Arak}} between the two oil containers in the tin shack is [[Sailor Zazzuk's 180-Proof Rum]]. Interact with the object to pick up ten bottles of the extremely potent beverage.

Towards the end of the road in town, Kimzee has [[Kimzee's Wrecked Hotrod|wrecked her hotrod]], but she did make it to Krixel's position.

''On approach''
:{{text|say|[[Krixel Pinchwhistle]]|Hey, you don't look infected.  You must be the <guy/gal> my niece was telling me about.  Come on over!}}

Krixel has the following to say:
:You're from the <[[Alliance]]/[[Horde]]> aren't you?

:I didn't know Kimzee would be out working with your kind, but considering the situation, I'll take any help I can get.

Kimzee also has new dialogue
:We'll find a way out of this, that's what Pinchwhistles do best!
