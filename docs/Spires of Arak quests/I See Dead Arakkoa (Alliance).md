Say, while you're here would you mind helping me out with a major problem?

The workers keep saying that they're seeing the ghost of the head arakkoa that used to be here.

I don't believe it for a second but could you take my Ghostogrifier 12000 to her body and check?

If they're not crazy, it'll prove it.
