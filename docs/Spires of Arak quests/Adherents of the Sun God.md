==Objectives==
Slay 8 Adherent Bladewings.
*[[Adherent Bladewing]] slain x8

==Description==
The [[arakkoa]] from [[Skyreach]] are all ruled by the Adherents of Rukhmar. They revile those of us who bear the [[Curse of Sethe]], and decree that we must be purged in the name of their sun god.

Soon their gaze will turn to lands beyond [[Spires of Arak|Arak]].

Challenge their warriors. Buy me time to prepare my escape, and help me set into motion their downfall.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 14,500 XP
* +250 reputation with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
{{Au|Skettis}} will fall today. Neither of us can change that.

We need only to send them a message: we will not die quietly.

==Completion==
[[Azik]] was right to guide you to me. If you were coming to help Skettis, we needed to meet.

And if you were coming to attack us, well, I'd be dead either way, wouldn't I?

<Reshad lets out a cawing laugh and stuffs another scroll into his robes.>

There, that's nearly everything.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Hidden in Plain Sight]] before heading out.

Head back west to the entrance of town. In the first courtyard, find the Weathered Spear on a scarecrow along the northwest wall. Gather it, then head east to the other marked point on the minimap. Along a southern wall in the easternmost courtyard, find the Ragged Mask on another scarecrow.

North of the Ragged Mask Scarecrow, head north uphill, then go west to find a small roost hidden in the hill. Inside is an effigy: [[Rukhmar's Image]], worth some [[Garrison Resources]].

Finish killing winged arakkoa and return to Reshad.
