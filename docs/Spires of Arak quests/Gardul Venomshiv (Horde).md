==Objectives==
Defeat Gardul Venomshiv in [[Shattered Rise]].
*[[Gardul Venomshiv]] defeated

==Description==
We need to take out Gardul and take his poison recipe while we still have the element of surprise on our side. We need it to craft the antidote. This may be our only opportunity.

If what you learned is true, his camp is just south of here. You take him down, and I'll make sure none of his guards interfere.

Let's get moving.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14520 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We won't let him get away.

==Progression==
