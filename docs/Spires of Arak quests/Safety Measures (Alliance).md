==Objectives==
Kill 15 bog denizens.
*Bog denizens slain (15)

==Description==
As it turns out, the resonance frequency of the batteries has really upset the local wildlife. I... I think one of the [[boar]]s looked and me and licked its lips just a moment ago.

I'll make it worth your time if you just... get rid of anything you come across down there. Doesn't matter what it is, just kill it, okay?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Fantastic! This is some good old-fashioned adventuring if I've ever seen it.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Sticky Situation (Alliance)]] before heading out.

Kill [[Putrid Mandragora]]s, [[Agitated Piglet]]s, [[Electrified Stingtail]]s, [[Surly Bogwallow]]s, and [[Putrid Axebeak]]s.

==Progression==
{{Spires of Arak 2}}
