==Objectives==
Administer the Spiresalve to [[Kolrigg Stoktron]] in [[Southport]].

==Description==
We're in luck, commander. The antidote is relatively easy tae make.

I've made a small amount with what I had on me. You should take it tae Kolrigg before it's too late. It'll keep him alive long enough for me tae make more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Outpost Building Assembly Notes]] and {{cost|1|38}}
* 1450 XP

==Completion==
By Muradin's beard... what a headache...
