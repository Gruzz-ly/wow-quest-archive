==Objectives==
Search the ruins of upper {{Au|Skettis}} for the [[Arakkoa]] research involving the Amulet of Rukhmar.
*[[Research Notes (Spires of Arak)]] (5)

==Description==
It seems the [[Adherents of Rukhmar]] have stumbled upon some information leading to an ancient amulet, said to possess the power of their god and bestow it upon the wearer. We should make sure they don't find it.

Head to Skettis and find what they have learned. Hopefully we can find it before they get to it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|85|}}
*3,770 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This should be enough to start your search.

==Completion==
After sorting through the Arakkoa research, it is clear that you are seeking multiple "keys" to activate the device leading to the relic.

The first of these keys is nearby, so you should start your search there.

==Notes==
What you're looking for are brown, closed scroll cases; fighting through some of the mobs will be likely. You'll receive [[Compiled Research]].
