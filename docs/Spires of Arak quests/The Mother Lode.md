==Objectives==
Meet up with [[Kimzee Pinchwhistle]] at the [[Wreck of the Mother Lode]].
*Meet up with Kimzee Pinchwhistle

==Description==
Hey we got ourselves a crisis here! Our zeppelin [[Wreck of the Mother Lode|"The Mother Lode"]] crashed onto the south mountain range.

It was supposed to only be on an observation mission, what could have happened?

We got to get down there quick and I'm going to need your help on this.

Are you with me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|42}}
*1450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh my gosh, this is way worse than I thought it was gonna be. I'm really going to need a hand with getting these survivors out of here.

Good thing I have you on the payroll.

==Notes==
;On accept
:''[[Vizzik Sparkknuckle]] drives up in a hot rod.''
:{{text|say|Vizzik Sparkknuckle|Here you are, miss Pinchwhistle!}}
:''Kimzee hops in the driver's seat.''
:{{text|say|Kimzee Pinchwhistle|About time! Come on, [[Engineer Gazwitz|Gazwitz]].}}
:''Gazwitz makes a show of deciding whether or not to hop in, before getting in the passenger seat.''
:{{text|say|Engineer Gazwitz|Of course, ma'am.}}
:''Kimzee peels out, but not before driving circles around Vizzik a few times.''

Exit town to the west and follow the trail south. At the pass, Kimzee and Gazwitz have hopped out of the hotrod:
:{{text|say|Kimzee Pinchwhistle|Hey, you're here just in time!}}

Gazwitz has new gossip:
:My contract was for burning fungus, repairing engines, and salvage work. It said nothing about dealing with bugs!

So does Kimzee:
:My uncle's in Pinchwhistle Point, I hope everyone's ok.
