==Objectives==
Use the QR58 Flame Blaster to destroy 20 Spore Pustules.
*[[Spore Pustule]]s Burned (20)
*[[QR58 Flame Blaster]] (provided)

==Description==
Have you seen the fungus out there in the water? It's growing faster then a baby [[ravasaur]] from [[Un'goro]] and if we don't get it under control [[Pinchwhistle Gearworks|the Gearworks]] is gonna be ruined like our [[Pinchwhistle Point|last village]].

[[Krixel Pinchwhistle|Uncle Krixel]] used to tell me to burn away the red fungus because that's what makes it grow so fast.

You could help us out by taking a flame blaster and clearing out some of those spores down in the shallows.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 570 chestpieces|"Fireproof" Venture Co. Robes|"Fireproof" Venture Co. Tunic|"Fireproof" Venture Co. Chainmail|"Fireproof" Venture Co. Blastplate}}
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|20}}
* 14650 XP

==Progress==
I'd love to be out there burning them spores down but I got paperwork to do here.

Speaking of work, you done yet?

==Completion==
Hey good job out there. I couldn't have done it any better myself.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Spore-be-Gone]] and [[Unwanted Pests]] before heading out.

Use the quest item flamethrower on red Spore Pustules while killing [[Spore Drifter]]s and [[Fungal Hulk]]s. Spore-B-Gone turrets are small mechanical constructs on the islands with a few Costal Spores hovering around them.

Northeast of the gearworks is rare sporebat [[Blightglow]]. Immediately west of Blightglow's patrol path, on the small mountain, is a batch of [[Mysterious Mushrooms]]. From the northwest side of the mountain, at {{co|62.8|65.8|Spires of Arak}} find a path leading up to the mushrooms at {{co|63.6|67.4|Spires of Arak}} near the end of the path.
