==Objectives==
Use the Ghostogrifier 12000 and kill the spirit of Talonpriest Zekk.
*[[Talonpriest Zekk]] slain
*[[Ghostogrifier 12000]] (provided)

==Description==
I've got a strange problem and I'm hoping you might be able to help. I don't know who else could help, to be honest.

My workers keep saying they're seeing the ghost of the arakkoa that used to head up this place.

I know, I know, it's crazy but could you take my Ghostogrifier 12000 to her body and check?

If there's a ghost around here, it'll find it. If there's not, then my workers are trying to slack off on the clock.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 14520 XP

==Completion==
Well, I'll be. Ghosts. Who knew?

==Notes==
Pick up [[All Natural (Horde)]] before heading out.

Kill [[Smoldering Ancient|smoldering]] and [[Ignited Ancient|ignited ancients]] for [[Fresh Charcoal]], and at the southeastern corner of the quest area, use the [[Ghostogrifier 12000]] to find [[Talonpriest Zekk]]
