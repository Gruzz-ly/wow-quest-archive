==Objectives==
Use the Eye of Anzu at 4 Wind Serpent Nests.
*[[Sethekk Wind Serpent Nest|Wind Serpent Nest]] destroyed (4)
*[[The Eye of Anzu#Gaze of the Raven God]] (provided)

==Description==
The {{Au|Sethekk}} are breeding vile [[wind serpent]]s from {{Au|Sethe}} blood and bones. With these creatures, they will tear apart the sky.

The nests are protected by powerful [[magic]], but {{Au|Anzu}}'s gaze should penetrate them with ease.

Let us visit the nests and destroy them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 14500 XP
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Completion==
<As the orb meets the altar, the nearby candles flare up.>

==Notes==
Pick up [[Sons of Sethe]] before heading out.

Southeast past the ooze area to the wind serpent area in [[Sethekk Hollow]]. Kill wind serpents and their arakkoa handlers. Nests are marked with purple columns of light coming out of them.

Just southeast of the quest area, the [[Spawn of Sethe]] vignette plays out. Kill the four [[Sethekk Serpent Tender]]s to free [[Sangrikass]], and kill the rare windserpent for ... and some [[Garrison Resources]].

Turn in due south of the quest area at the [[Talon Altar]].
