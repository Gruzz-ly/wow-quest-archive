==Completion==
I can honestly say I never thought I'd see the premier Horde commander walking through an Alliance garrison.

Then again, I never thought I'd be caught while performing reconnaissance for the Dark Lady and stuffed in a hole in the ground left for dead.

I'm clearly not going anywhere without your help. If you help me out of this hellhole, I'll serve under your banner. My solo run has been decidedly less than pleasant.
