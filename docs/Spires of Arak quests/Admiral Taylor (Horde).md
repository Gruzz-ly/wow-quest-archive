== Objectives ==
Find Admiral Taylor at [[Admiral Taylor's Farm]].
*[[Admiral Taylor]] found
*[[Soulscythe]] slain
*[[Ephial]] slain

== Description ==
Admiral Taylor had figured out who was behind all this. He told us to save who we could... he wanted to handle matters himself.

We never heard from him again, but we have our orders.

Please... please find him. He went towards the farm.

== Rewards ==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 560 weapons|Admiral Taylor's Shield|Admiral Taylor's Ceremonial Sword|Admiral Taylor's Cutlass|Admiral Taylor's Keg Tapper|Admiral Taylor's Greatsword|Admiral Taylor's Hunting Bow|Admiral Taylor's Boot Knife|Admiral Taylor's Glaive|Admiral Taylor's Staff of Wisdom}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|27|60}}
* 18150 XP

== Completion ==
From one commander to another... thank you.

We've faced off on the field of battle so many times. Vashj'ir... the Jade Forest... Lion's Landing...

I am glad I could end my journey with such a worthy adversary.

== Notes ==
Head south out of the wall to [[Admiral Taylor's Farm]]. There, Admiral Taylor and a whole bunch of dead workers/villagers are in the field. Taylor's spirit is strung up on some kind of necromantic structure in the middle of the field.
:{{text|yell|Admiral Taylor|Hero, help me down from here. We don't have much time!}}
:{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|Ephial betrayed me. He slaughtered my men and turned them against -}}
:{{text|say|Ephial|You have heart, Taylor. I'll give you that.}}
:{{text|say|Ephial|I suppose there's not much point in disguises any more.}}
:''Ephial transforms from a standard male human to a [[necromancer]] model!''
:{{text|say|Ephial|Now, Admiral, it is time to finish what I started.}}
:''Ephial casts a spell, and all of the dead corpses in the field start flying about, circling closer to Taylor's spirit. They combine to form [[Soulscythe]]!''
:{{text|yell|Ephial|Rise, and carry out my will!}}
Aggro it:
:{{text|say|Soulscythe|I will tear you and your garrison apart.}}
At 20%:
:{{text|say|Soulscythe|A soldier's duty... is never done.}}
Finish it off:
:{{text|say|Soulscythe|Your time... will come.}}
:{{text|say|Ephial|Very well. I'll finish you myself.}}
At 50%:
:{{text|say|Ephial|I turned the Admiral's "followers" against him. Perhaps I shall pay your garrison a visit next?}}
Finish him off:
:{{text|say|Ephial|The dark one promised me so much... if I succeeded...}}
:{{text|say|Admiral Taylor|You've done it. We are free!}}
Taylor's spirit survived, somehow. Turn in to it.
