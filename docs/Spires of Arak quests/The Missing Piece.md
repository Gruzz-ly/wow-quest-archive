== Objectives ==
Place Lithic's Gift on the [[Effigy of Terokk]].

== Description ==
Terokk's daughter Lithic was a skilled huntress, but found her true passion in goldsmithing. She forged this bangle as a gift for her father, and he wore it for many years. Only after Lithic passed away did he remove the bangle, for her memory was too much for the old king to bear. Place the bangle upon the effigy, and I shall tell you of Terokk's fall. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 1450 XP
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]
