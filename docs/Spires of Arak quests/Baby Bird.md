==Objectives==
Gather 8 Ravager Grubs in the [[Shadowglade]].
*[[Ravager Grub]] (8)

==Description==
<Ikky cheeps again, then begins gnawing on his foot.

Looking out across the nearby hillside, you spy tiny ravager grubs inching along the grass.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
<Ikky looks up at you, foot clamped in his beak, and lets out a muffled cheep.>

==Completion==
<You hold the handful of grubs out, steel yourself, and prepare to chew them up as a mama bird would.

Thankfully, Ikky snatches them from your hand before you can proceed.

Apparently, kaliri don't do that.>

==Notes==
Pick up [[Mother of Thorns]] before heading out.

Head just south to start killing ravagers and looting ravager grubs.
