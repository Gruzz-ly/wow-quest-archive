==Objectives==
Drink the Major Elixir of Shadows at [[Zellek's Hut]] in [[Veil Akraz]].
*Major Elixir of Shadows imbibed {{co|44.5|24.0|Spires of Arak}}
*[[Major Elixir of Shadows]] (provided)

==Description==
Soon after the orcs swept in, [[Veil Akraz]] was laid to waste by a beam of light from [[Skyreach]].

<[[Talonpriest Ishaal|Ishaal's]] eyes glass over as he peers into his orb.>

It seems they missed their true target. Zellek is still there, hiding in the realm of shadow.

And... someone else as well. The orc assassin who used my orb.

Take this. Drink it in Veil Akraz and find Zellek.

Oh, and be careful. It's a little more potent than the last one. You'll see...

''On complete''
:{{text|say|Talonpriest Ishaal|I will make for Veil Terokk. Time is short and we have many preparations to make.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 14500 XP
* +250 reputation with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Completion==
Well, you are not stabbing me yet.

That is a good sign.

==Notes==
Follow the path north past [[Camp Thornscar]] to reach [[Veil Akraz]], which has been all but obliterated by [[Skyreach]]'s beam weapon. However, [[Zellek's Hut]] at the northeast end of town survived the blast, so use the Major Elixir of Shadows there.
