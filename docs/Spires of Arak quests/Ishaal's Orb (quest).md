==Objectives==
Retrieve Ishaal's Orb from [[Camp Thornscar]].
*[[Ishaal's Orb]] {{co|48.1|28.5|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
The Adherents came for me, but I was already hiding. I watched from the shadows as they ransacked my hut.

Then I watched the Shattered Hand orcs arrive and butcher them like dinner fowl. Seems everyone is after us these days.

One of those orc thugs made off with my scrying orb. I will be needing it back if I am to be of any use to Iskar.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
Have you found the orb?

==Completion==
Hmmm... something's not right. She's been tampered with.

Someone else has used my orb to enter the realm of shadows.

==Notes==
Pick up [[New Neighbors]] before heading out.

Head north into [[Camp Thornscar]], killing orcs along the way. At the south end of camp, note the [[Ravager Egg]], which starts [[Egg Punt]]. Pick it up, and go ahead and punt that very egg, then find several more purple eggs to punt. On the north side of camp, near the center of the marked triangle, find rare orc [[Durkath Steelmaw]] inside a tent. To the northeast, in the last tent, find [[Ishaal's Orb]].
