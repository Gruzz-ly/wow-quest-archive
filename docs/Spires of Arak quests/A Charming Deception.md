==Objectives==
Use 5 Illusion Charms to draw out [[Adherent Blackwing]]s.
*[[Illusion Charm]] (5)

==Description==
[[Reshad]] is more than he appears; a mottled old crow with his beak in a book, certainly, but we need him.

Shadows gather beneath the lonely spire, in [[Veil Terokk]]. Reshad must make it there safely.

Along the path you'll find charms primed with illusion spells. You need only touch them to take on Reshad's image.

Adherent assassins are on the prowl for an old outcast with scrolls on his back. They will fall upon you.

Oh, but won't they be surprised when the illusion fades?! Kee-hee-hee!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Skettis Deceiver's Band
|Skettis Deceiver's Ring
|Skettis Deceiver's Signet
|Skettis Deceiver's Loop
|Skettis Deceiver's Gemband
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|15|40|}}
* 14,500 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Completion==
How very noble of you to act as bait on my behalf. I will not forget this.

==Notes==
Pick up [[All Due Respect]] and [[Echo Hunters]] before heading out.

''On accept of all three:''
:{{text|say|Reshad|Ornekka, it is not safe here - the Adherents are out in full force. Come with us to [[Veil Terokk]].}}
:{{text|say|Ornekka|Oh, how sweet of you, Reshad! I never knew you cared.}}
:{{text|say|Ornekka|But my old bones would only slow you down. I'll be fine here.}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|Very well. Let us proceed, <name>.}}

Start heading south along the path, interacting with Illusion Charms on trees and killing the resulting [[Adherent Harrier]]s. Use the bonus action button to stun the summoned Adherent and do a little free damage to it. [[Echo Hunters]] are a bit further off the path.

East of the pond is rare Draenor ancient [[Shadowbark]]. Just off the path southwest of the pond where Shadowbark was found is Syth's abode. Pluck a feather from Syth, and loot The Saga of Terokk from Syth's Bookcase.
:{{text|say|Reshad|Step aside, <name>. Let us see if this fellow had anything worthwhile...}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|Mind the door, will you?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Hold off the Adherents.}}
Four waves of 2-4 adherents attack. Heal up between waves! While the attack goes on:
:{{text|say|Reshad|My, my... What a curious collection...}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|Percy, what's that you've got there? Come, now, let's see it...}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|Fifty Layers of Shadow?! PERCIVAL, YOU PUT THAT BACK THIS INSTANT.}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|Nasty bird...}}
:{{text|say|Reshad|Ah, here's something! The Saga of Terokk.}}
:{{text|say\Reshad|And he's written notes inside. Here, have a look.}}
Turn in All Due Respect and pick up [[Syth's Secret]]. before moving on. Also, behind Syth's house to the west is rare tiger [[Nightmaw]].

Keep heading south along the path. Just before it starts going uphill, three winged arakkoa are guarding the entrance to a ravager den. Inside, [[Sun-Talon Oberyx]] has found the Eye of Anzu:
:{{text|say|Sun-Talon Oberyx|So this is what the little sneak was hiding... the High Sage will be pleased.}}
Aggro Oberyx:
:{{text|say|Sun-Talon OberyxThat wretched outcast begged for death in the end - and so will you!}}
Loot [[The Eye of Anzu]] from Oberyx's corpse, then finish up the other quests outside. Head south to the [[Terokkar Wayshrine]] to turn in.
