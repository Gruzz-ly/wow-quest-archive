==Objectives==
Help Ikky hatch from the Kaliri Egg in [[Shadowglade]].

<Miraculously, this single egg has eluded the ravagers.

A small tag has been lovingly tied around the base of the egg. It reads "Ikky.">

You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}

The hatchling springs immediately to flight, then looks at you expectantly and cheeps.

In [[Shadowglade]] for [[The Kaliri Whisperer]], after looting the [[Worn Gavel]], the egg a few yards south of [[Skizzik]] offers this quest. Interact with the egg to hatch Ikky, turn in and pick up [[Baby Bird]].
