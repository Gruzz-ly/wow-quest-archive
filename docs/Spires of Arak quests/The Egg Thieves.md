==Objectives==
Collect 8 Dread Raven Eggs.
*[[Dread Raven Egg]] (8)

==Description==
Kwaak! The [[Bloodmane tribe|Bloodclaw]] are sadistic creatures. They have attacked the [[Ravenskar]] before and have stolen the eggs of the sacred ravens.

Kawww! Even worse, they wait for the eggs to hatch and they use the poor fledglings as playthings!

Skwaak! While you are within the Bloodclaw lands keep an eye out for the eggs.

I'll be waiting for you at the nest with as many baskets for them as I can gather.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 14500 XP
* +250 reputation with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find the stolen raven eggs?

==Completion==
Awwk! These poor egs have avoided a horrible future in the Bloodclaw lands.

We will take far better care of them.

Thank you!

==Notes and trivia==
Pick up [[Ralshiara's Demise]] and [[Declawing The Bloodmane]] before heading out.

Loop around [[Swarmleaf]]'s position to the southwest to enter [[Bloodmane Valley]]. Immediately after entering the valley, loop northwest uphill to find at {{co|48.9|54.7|Spires of Arak}} an [[Offering to the Raven Mother]].

Cut southwest to find [[Ralshiara]] standing in front of a den. Use the quest item to spawn a laser pointer, that Ralshiara dutifully tries to nab. It lasts for 30 sec, so use it again once the laser pointer wears off. Eggs are at the base of Tied Stakes, which Dread Raven Hatchlings are bound to, or inside dens.

At the southwestern extent of the Too Many Eggs quest area, inside a den at {{co|49.1|62.6|Spires of Arak}} is an [[Elixir of Shadow Sight]]. Find another Offering to the Raven Mother at {{co|51.9|64.7|Spires of Arak}} at the top of ahill nestled against a tree. Access this one by getting to the southeastern end of the quest area and running uphill to the east toward the den. Just before entering the den, take a left heading north up the hill. Get to the opposite side of the tree blocking the path to find the offering.

Turn back in at the [[Nest of the Ravenspeakers]].

During the beta, the quest was renamed from '''Too Many Eggs, Not Enough Baskets'''.
