Speak with the [[Shade of Terokk]] to accept his power. Slay 25 [[Shattered Hand]] combatants, 4 Shattered Pit-Masters, and confront Kargath Bladfist.
*Shattered Hand combatant slain (25)
*[[Shattered Hand Pit-Master]] slain (4)
*[[Kargath Bladefist]] confronted

==Description==
My long sleep was disturbed by dreams of the past. I cut down my old enemies again. I watched my daughter die again. You were there. I felt your presence in these dreams. And your past was revealed to me as well. Someone has woven our fates together. My people are yours to protect, and your enemies are mine to destroy. The Shattered Hand are rallied in Bladefist Hold. Left to their own, they would claim this land for the Iron Horde. Take my power, and together we shall break them. 

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 592 rings
|Talon Guard Bloodsworn Signet	
|Talon Guard Bloodsworn Loop
|Talon Guard Bloodsworn Ring
|Talon Guard Bloodsworn Seal
|Talon Guard Bloodsworn Band}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|28|40}}
*18350 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
Take what you have earned, <name>.

==Completion==
The Shattered Hand is in shambles and the Avatar of Terokk now walks among us.

When I promised you power back in Skettis, did you expect that it would come without any strings attached? Ha!

''On turn-in''
:{{text|say|Shade of Terokk|That orc... Kargath. Even at my full strength, he would prove a challenge.}}
:{{text|say|Shade of Terokk|My children, it will take more than a fading memory from the past to overcome the challenges you face today.}}
:{{text|say|Shade of Terokk|You must strike your own path. Lay the past to rest and raise new champions.}}
:{{text|say|Shade of Terokk|You have one already.}}
:{{text|say|Shade of Terokk|Hero, I can never again grant you my full power. Kargath severed that bond.}}
:{{text|say|Shade of Terokk|But so long as you tread in Arak, some piece of me will remain with you.}}
:{{text|say|Shade of Terokk|I will lend my power as often as I can.}}

==Notes==
Interact with the Effigy of Terokk yet again:
:{{gossip|Accept Terokk's power.}}
Controlling Terokk, the player winds up in [[Bladefist Hold]] at the northwest corner of [[Spires of Arak]]:
:{{text|yell|Kargath Bladefist|What's this? An arakkoa challenger in my arena?!}}
:{{text|yell|Kargath Bladefist|Tired of being hunted? Or just here for revenge?}}
:{{text|yell|Kargath Bladefist|Go ahead, little bird. Do your worst!}}
Terokk has one ability:
:{{abilities|Talon Strike|Pierces enemies in a line in front of Terokk, dealing high damage.|notes=0.5 sec cast|cd=0.5 sec}}
Defeat all of the peons and Kargath will jump down:
:{{text|yell|Kargath Bladefist|What?! Who are you?!}}
:{{text|yell|Terokk|I am the Talon King! I have come from beyond death to stem the iron tide!}}
:{{text|yell|Kargath Bladefist|Enough! This ends NOW!}}
Get Kargath to 70% or so:
:{{text|say|Kargath Bladefist|Well I'm Kargath Bladefist, and when I kill something, IT STAYS DEAD.}}
:{{text|say|Terokk|Hngh! Im...possible...}}
:{{text|say|Terokk|My power... has... failed you... <name>.}}
:''Terokk's power fades and the player is exposed in the arena.''
:{{text|say|Kargath Bladefist|Hmph. So it's you in there.}}
:{{text|say|Kargath Bladefist|[[Khadgar]] isn't here to protect you this time.}}
:''The player turns into the Effigy of Terokk.''
:{{text|say|Kargath Bladefist|What?! GGRAAAHHH!!!!}}
:{{text|say|Shadow-Sage Iskar|Are you alright? That was a close call.}}
:{{text|say|Shadow-Sage Iskar|We barely got you out in time.}}

Turn in to Reshad.
