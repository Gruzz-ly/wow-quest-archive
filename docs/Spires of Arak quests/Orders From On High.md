==Objectives==
Loot the Adherent Proclamation from [[Sun-Sage Rathyx]].
*[[Adherent Proclamation]] {{co|45.9|15.4|Spires of Arak}}

==Description==
The [[Adherents of Rukhmar]] are the ruling body atop [[Spires of Arak|the spires]]. Their influence is absolute. Their proclamations taken as the will of Rukhmar Herself.

The herald leading this purge is surely carrying out such orders - likely no more than a list of names and places they plan to erase.

That list would prove invaluable in the days to come. Acquire it for me, and shut that herald up!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Reshad fastens another scroll to Percy, who squawks meekly in protest.>

Oh, stop whining.

==Completion==
Ah yes, there's my name at the top of the list. And a few Talonpriests from the Shadowglade as well.

They fear the return of [[Terokk]], as they should.

==Notes==
Head southeast fo find [[Sun-Sage Rathyx]] hovering over the eastern exit to [[Skettis]]. Loot the [[Adherent Proclamation]] from the herald's corpse, then take the exit and head downhill to the south to find Percy and Reshad not far from the bridge.

;On accept
:{{text|say|Reshad|We'll slip away while you keep the herald busy. Meet us near the bridge just outside of town!}}
