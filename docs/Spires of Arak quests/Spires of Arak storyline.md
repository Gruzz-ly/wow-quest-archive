[[File:VZ-Spires of Arak.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

The '''Spires of Arak storyline''' is the level-up experience in the [[Spires of Arak]]. Players are led here from their faction outposts in [[Talador]]. The [[Adherents of Rukhmar]] are waging a war of extermination of the cursed [[arakkoa]], and one of the first things that players see is the [[Skyreach]] [[Breath of Rukhmar|superweapon]] obliterating [[Veil Akraz]]!

The storyline tracking achievement is called [[Between Arak and a Hard Place]] and has nine chapters. The chapters are somewhat interleaved, as the zone storyline does not play out linearly.

Eventually, the player will receive the quest [[News from Nagrand]], which leads them to {{Au|Nagrand}}.
