==Objectives==
Collect an Organic Laser Apparatus from [[the Ebon Hunter]].
*[[Organic Laser Apparatus]]

==Description==
The laser should be good to go once we get it set up, there's just one more thing I need.

There's a [[spore walker]] that hunts on the delta just southeast from here. It has an apparatus on its face that can fire a powerful laser - way more powerful than what we have hooked up.

I want it.

We'll be mining faster than you can imagine once we get that bad boy hooked up!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Outpost Building Assembly Notes]]
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14520 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I should probably have mentioned that the laser is pretty... potent.

==Completion==
Perfection. Let's get it hooked up!

==Notes==
Head southeast, but before reaching the delta, note a ghostly dread raven, [[Oskiira the Vengeful]], uphill to the east. Kill it for ... and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]], then take the convenient path directly south to the [[Forlorn Delta]] to find [[The Ebon Hunter]].
