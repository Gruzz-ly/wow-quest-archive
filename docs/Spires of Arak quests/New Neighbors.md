==Objectives==
Slay 15 Shattered Hand orcs in [[Camp Thornscar]].
*Shattered Hand orcs slain (15)

==Description==
The Shattered Hand clan is made up of orcs who can call no other clan home. They are sadistic warriors who maim their bodies, perhaps in a show of solidarity or perhaps because they simply enjoy the pain.

It does not matter. What matters is that they are expanding their territory, butchering anyone in their path.

They must be dealt with.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 572 belts|Cragplate Girdle|Shadowveil Cord|Ravenchain Belt|Skysinger Belt}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
Replacing their hands with weapons...

Who does that?!

==Completion==
Blood for blood, as it should be.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Ishaal's Orb (quest)]] before heading out.

Head north into [[Camp Thornscar]], killing orcs along the way. At the south end of camp, note the [[Ravager Egg]], which starts [[Egg Punt]]. Pick it up, and go ahead and punt that very egg, then find several more purple eggs to punt. On the north side of camp, near the center of the marked triangle, find rare orc [[Durkath Steelmaw]] inside a tent. To the northeast, in the last tent, find [[Ishaal's Orb]].
