== Completion ==
<Name>, we've been through hell and back together more times than I can count. You're the Alliance's best chance at defeating the [[Iron Horde]], and you know it.

How do you feel about me joining your garrison? We can bring the fight to orcish scum together, just like old times.

== Rewards ==
* Follower: [[Admiral Taylor]]
