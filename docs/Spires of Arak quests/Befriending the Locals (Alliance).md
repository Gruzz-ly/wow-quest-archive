==Objectives==
Speak to [[Dusk-Seer Irizzar]] near [[Veil Terokk]].

==Description==
Commander, I believe it best for the safety of this outpost if we secure an ally. We've made contact with one of the outcast arakkoa, but he refused to make any promises of alliance without speaking to you first.

He called himself Dusk-Seer Irrizar. Could you go speak with him, commander?

You can find him just southwest of Veil Terokk.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,450 [[XP]]
*{{cost|1|38}}

==Completion==
Ah, so you are the one your people spoke of so highly. We may discuss an alliance, but first...
