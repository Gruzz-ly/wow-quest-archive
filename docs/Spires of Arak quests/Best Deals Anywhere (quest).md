==Objectives==
Speak to [[Mixxy Weldblast]] in [[Murkbog]].

==Description==
Commander, two goblin smugglers - Mixxy and Trixxy Weldblast - came through here recently and went off towards the bog to the east.

They had drilling equipment but weren't carrying any weapons, <sir/madame>.

I'd bet anything that they'll have materials we'd want, and that they could use some protection in return.

Commander, I think seeking them out would be a good idea.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|38}}
*1450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I don't know what you're doin' all the way out here, but mind helpin' a gal out since you're stopping by?

==Progression==

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
