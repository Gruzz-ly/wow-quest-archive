==Objectives==
Kill 6 Spore Shamblers in [[Pinchwhistle Point]].
*[[Spore Shambler]] slain (6)

==Description==
It's revolting, absolutely disgusting, infuriating even!

I'm talking about seeing those spore creatures walking around Pinchwhistle Point.

While I'm working on the machine here how about you go out and kill off some of those spore creatures?  I'll feel a bit better knowing there are less of those things moving around.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|20}}
*14650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you put down those spore creatures yet?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

The less of those spore beasts around the safer we all are.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Preventing the Worst]] and [[Curing With Force]] before heading out.

From the Pinchwhistle's position, head southwest to reach the fungal area, with rare infected hydra [[Jiasska the Sporegorger]]. Kill a few fungal creatures (there's another area with more of them!), then head just northwest to the bar area. Weaken the infected goblins to < 25% health, then use the quest item on them. Inside each building a spot where a ghostly Firebomb can be placed. The inn's firebomb is in the window upstairs. Also, on the shelf above the door in the bedroom of the inn is a chest of [[Campaign Contributions]]. Get on the bed, then jump from shelf to shelf to get within range of the chest.

North of the storage shed in the northern fungal area is rare fungal giant [[Mutafen]].
