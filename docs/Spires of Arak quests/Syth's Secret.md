== Objectives ==
Retrieve the Eye of [[Anzu (alternate universe)|Anzu]].
*[[The Eye of Anzu]] {{co|48.3|42.9|Spires of Arak}}

== Description ==
[[Syth|Our deceased friend]] here was hiding more than a love of old scrolls and erotic sorcery-fiction. He had something truly valuable.

If I'm reading his notes correctly, he claims to have found the Eye of Anzu - [[Terokk|Terokk's]] scrying orb from the days after his fall.

We need that orb! The notes say he stashed it in a ravager den just up the road.

''On accept''
:{{text|say|Reshad|Back to the shadows for us, Percy.}}

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 14500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

== Progress ==
To hold such a treasure. I wonder if that Sun-Talon had any idea of the significance?

== Completion ==
<Reshad gazes into the inky orb.>

Amazing. To think Terokk used this very orb to communicate with Anzu. One could become quite the darkweaver with an implement such as this.

Come, let's get it safely to the Veil.

== Notes ==
[[File:Syth's Secret.jpg|thumb|Entrance.]]
Don't forget to check behind Syth's house to the west for rare tiger [[Nightmaw]].

Keep heading south along the path. Just before it starts going uphill, three winged arakkoa are guarding the entrance to a ravager den. Inside, [[Sun-Talon Oberyx]] has found the Eye of Anzu:
:{{text|say|Sun-Talon Oberyx|So this is what the little sneak was hiding... the High Sage will be pleased.}}
Aggro Oberyx:
:{{text|say|Sun-Talon Oberyx|That wretched outcast begged for death in the end - and so will you!}}
Loot [[The Eye of Anzu]] from Oberyx's corpse, then finish up the other quests outside. Head south to the [[Terokkar Wayshrine]] to turn in.
