==Objectives==
Speak with [[Azik]] in the [[Spires of Arak]].

==Description==
All able-bodied members of the [[Horde]] are hereby ordered to report to Azik in Spires of Arak.

There have been wingless [[arakkoa]] seen fleeing from Spires of Arak. Rumors suggest that they are running from an [[Iron Horde]] superweapon.

We need to find out what is causing them to leave their homeland, and why their wings have withered.

For the Horde!
