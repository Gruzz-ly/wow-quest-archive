== Objectives ==
Fly upon Ka'alu and slay 70 Adherents and direct your troops to capture 3 Rukhmar's Light Alignment Controls.
*Adherents slain × 70
*Alignment Controls Captured × 3

== Description ==
Our assault upon the [[Terrace of Dawn]] is not going to be easy, <name>. The defenders are great in number and they zealously guard their control of the beam of light.

Thankfully, we have a goddess on our side.

With her help we can break through the defenders and send our landing teams to capture the alignment controls.

Victory is almost in our grasp! I can't wait to pen the story of your actions into my scrolls!

== Rewards ==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 582 weapons|Talon Guard Shortblade|Talon Guard Wingclipper|Talon Guard Cudgel|Talon Guard Wingsmasher|Talon Guard Bow|Talon Guard Dagger|Talon Guard Glaive|Talon Guard Staff}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
* 14500 XP
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

== Completion ==
You've done so much more for us than I could have ever dreamed possible, <name>.

The Adherents' threat to our home is broken. Our battle is not yet over but we can rest a little easier now.

Percy and I want to give you something as a token of our thanks. It's not much but please, take your reward.

== Notes ==
''On accept:
:{{text|say|Reshad|Speak with Ka'alu when you are ready to fly.}}

Speak with Ka'alu:
:<A voice fills your thoughts.>
:We must hurry before the children of Rukhmar can regroup their forces.
:{{gossip|I am ready to fly, Ka'alu.}}
On Ka'alu, the player has access to two abilities:
#{{abilities|Screech|range=100|Screech to send a powerful blast of sonic waves at a target.|notes=Instant}}
#{{abilities|Designate Target|range=200|Designate a location for an ally to attack.|cd=2 sec}}
Control the screech target by holding down the right mouse button and moving the camera about, while spamming {{keypress|1}}. To designate a target, hit {{keypress|2}}, then left-click on the ground next to one of the devices on a flat platform.
''Intro''
:{{text|say|Reshad|We need to capture those alignment controls.}}
:{{text|say|Ka'alu|My cries will rattle your enemies like thunder. Guide my aim and strike them down!}}

''During the quest''
*{{text|say|Reshad|It's no good, they're dying out there! Clear a path for them!}}
*{{text|say|Reshad|Reinforcements! Clear them out!}}

After hitting both quotas:
:{{text|say|Reshad|It looks like everyone is in position. Ka'alu, give the signal and get us out of here!}}

This completes the "When the Raven Swallows the Day" chapter of [[Between Arak and a Hard Place]], and the main portion of the [[Spires of Arak storyline]]. At level 98, the [[Nagrand (alternate universe) storyline|Nagrand storyline]] begins with [[News from Nagrand]]. Also, Reshad offers one last quest, sending players into the [[Skyreach]] dungeon, in [[Victory is Within Reach]].
