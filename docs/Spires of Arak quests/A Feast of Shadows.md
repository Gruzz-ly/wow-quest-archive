==Objectives==
Gather 10 Shadow Dust.
*[[Shadow Dust (Draenor)]] (10)

==Description==
Many arakkoa died in [[Veil Akraz]]. From the outside, all seems still. Empty.

But in this place between worlds, death never goes unnoticed.

Stray life essence seeps through from the other side; a feast for the beings who prowl here.

Slay the shadow creatures here, and gather from their corpses the fine dust they produce. I will need much of it to perform the rites of the Talon King.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 568 helms|Cragplate Helm|Shadowveil Hood|Ravenchain Helm|Skysinger Helm}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|80}}
*14500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Arakkoa Outcasts]]

==Progress==
You know those elixirs you have been so eagerly quaffing?

They are made of this stuff.

==Completion==
Good. With this much dust we can delve deep enough to reach the Talon King's refuge.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Blades in the Dark]] before heading out.

Head southwest, killing [[fleshbeast]]s and shape-shifting [[shade]]s along the way, to reach where [[Malrok Thornscar]] is wandering about, dazed and confused. Make sure to drag the non-named mobs out of the purple circles, as they will heal when standing inside the circle.
