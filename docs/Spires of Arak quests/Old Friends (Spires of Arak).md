== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Jasper Fel]] at [[Admiral Taylor's Garrison]].

== Description ==
[[Taylor|Admiral Taylor]] was ordered to establish a garrison inland while we erected [[Lunarfall|yours]] in {{Au|Shadowmoon Valley}}. He settled just a short ways north of here.

The two of us could go there and borrow some supplies to tide us over before our next shipment.

What do you say, commander? I'm sure the Admiral will be thrilled to see you again.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|38}}
* 1450 XP

== Completion ==
What in the king's name happened here?

== Notes ==
Exit camp and take the north fork. On the way, look for a crashed wagon, with it's load tossed out on the road. In the bed of the wagon is the [[Garrison Workman's Hammer]]. Head west into the garrison, where something has gone wrong, as everyone is a ghost!

''On accept''

''On approach''
:{{text|say|Bryan Finn|No, no, no. The whole thing's all wrong!}}
:{{text|say|Jasper Fel|Bryan! It's me, Jasper. What happened to you?}}

==Progression==
