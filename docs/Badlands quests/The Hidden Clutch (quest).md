== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Rhea]] at [[The Hidden Clutch]] in the [[Badlands]].

== Description ==
With the major [[black dragon]]s out of the Badlands, it is now safe to move the egg again. You will find me on a small plateau north of [[New Kargath]].

Come and find me.

== Completion ==
The egg must always be moving. We are not safe anywhere.

{{NPC||Deathwing}}, even in his madness, knows all the hidden places in this world. The egg must not rest.

== Notes ==
If players killed a path to the southeast, and not to the northeast, circle all the way around New Kargath to head back into the valley. Either way, find a path up the hill to the north to find Rhea.

Completing the quest will have players saying goodbye to the vikings.
