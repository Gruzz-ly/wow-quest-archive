==Objectives==
Use Jurrix's Fiery Blast and Jurrix's Time Warp.
*Use Jurrix's Fiery Blast
*Use Jurrix's Time Warp

==Description==
Oh, you want to talk? Fine.

I'm Jurrix, the only [[Mercenary|merc]] here with half a brain. The only one with any bite to my attacks, too. The only reason I keep these meat shields around is to keep myself from getting killed.

Listen, you're the boss of this operation. You give the word, and I'll send a fireball right through your target's heart. If things start getting hectic, I can even warp time a bit so you can fit in a few extra attacks.

Why don't we go try fighting together?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|0}} (+{{coppercost|1800}} at max level)

==Progress==
We're not quite ready yet. A little more practice, then we'll get with the dragon-slaying.

==Completion==
I think you're ready, <name>. You're getting the hang of this.

==Notes==
[[File:The Bad Dogs mounted.jpg|thumb|The Bad Dogs on their motorcycles.]]
Pick up [[Amakkar, Jack of All Trades]] and [[Gargal, the Behemoth]] before heading out. Accepting the first of these quests put all three of the [[Bad Dogs]] into the player's party. Now as minions of the player, all three mercenaries have their two abilities listed:
#{{Abilities|Amakkar's Kidney Shot|id=87608|range=25|Amakkar charges an enemy, inflicting X Physical damage, and stunning it for 3 sec.|cd=15 sec|notes=Instant.|icon=inv_gauntlets_05}}
#{{Abilities|Amakkar's Pocket Potion|id=87609|Heals all mercenaries by X over 10 sec.|cd=2 min|notes=Instant.|icon=inv_potion_77}}
#{{Abilities|Jurrix's Fiery Blast|id=87612|range=100|Jurrix shoots a fireball at an enemy, inflicting Fire damage and causing high threat.|cd=15 sec|notes=instant|icon=spell_fire_fireball02}}
#{{Abilities|Jurrix's Time Warp|id=87611|Increases all mercenaries' attack speed by 200% for 15 sec.|cd=1 min|notes=Instant|icon=ability_mage_timewarp}}
#{{Abilities|Gargal's Shield Wall|id=87613|Reduces the Physical and magical damage taken by Gargal by 75% for 10 sec.|cd=30 sec|notes=Instant|icon=ability_warrior_shieldwall}}
#{{Abilities|Gargal's Mighty Shout|id=87614|Taunts the target to attack Gargal, but has no effect if the target is already attacking Gargal.|cd=15 sec|notes=Instant|icon=spell_nature_reincarnation}}
If the player mounts up, the Bad Dogs will mount up on [[Mechano-Hog]]s. Merely getting within range of a target is all that necessary for the mercenaries to attack. Head out and use all of the mercenaries' abilities to complete the quests.
