== Objectives ==
Use the Teleporter in the back of [[Fuselight-by-the-Sea]] to port up the mountain, then report to {{NPC||Dolph Blastus}} at [[Fuselight]] in the [[Badlands]].

== Description ==
This, <race>, is paradise. I've always wanted to live in a nice quiet town by the sea so I can focus on my explosions without any distractions.

Quiet's not for everybody, though... 'specially the [[adventurer|adventuring]] hero-type, like yourself.

We've installed a teleporter in the backside of town that'll take you to the top of the cliffs. From there, you can take the quick ride west into Fuselight proper, within the badlands.

There should be more for you to do up there. Tell 'em that {{NPC||Eddie Flofizzle||Flo}} sent you.

== Completion ==
Welcome to Fuselight!

== Notes ==
Run northwest along the path up the hill and into the teleporter. It will drop players off at the eastern end of the [[Lethlor Ravine]]. Follow the lighted racepath across the ravine up to Fuselight, where the giant checkered flag is. Dolph Blastus is in the center of town on the south side. Don't forget to pick up the flight path on the north end of town...
