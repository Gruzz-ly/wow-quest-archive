== Objectives ==
Listen to {{NPC||Theldurin the Lost||Theldurin}}'s tale.
* [[Dang-Blasted Rock Elemental]] slain x5
* Punch {{NPC||Deathwing}} in the Face

== Description ==
Deathwing made quite a mess when he passed through these parts. If it weren't for me, he'd probably still be here, layin' waste to all the good people of the [[Badlands]].

What, you don't believe me? Fine, let me tell you the whole story.

== Completion ==
Some story, huh? Now you know why Deathwing hasn't come back here since.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|bossemote|I remember it well. It was a bright, shiny day...}}
:''The camera pans and looks up to the sky.''
:{{text|bossemote|I was just mindin' my own business, when all of a sudden, Deathwing appeared!}}
:''Deathwing flies into frame and heads down the scar to the northeast.''
:{{text|bossemote|I said to myself, "I'm gonna punch that dragon in the face!"}}
:{{text|yell|Theldurin the Lost|I'm gonna punch that dragon in the face!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Unfortunately, the cataclysm had knocked loose a bunch of angry elementals.}}
:''The camera tilts down to show the "Dang-Blasted Rock Elemental"s.''
:{{text|yell|Theldurin the Lost|You dang-blasted rock elementals!}}
:{{text|yell|Theldurin the Lost|I'll punch you too!}}

Players are now in Theldrin's boots. He has precisely one ability:
*{{abilities|Theldurin's Fist|Plant an angry fist in any obstacle that gets in your way.|cd=1 sec}}

Clear a path through the Dang-Blasted Rock Elementals and the Gol' Durned Rock Heaps. Theldurin has some commentary during the process:
*{{text|say|Theldruin the Lost|P-p-punch!}}
*{{text|say|Theldruin the Lost|Face punch!}}
*{{text|say|Theldruin the Lost|Take that, dangerous enemy!}}
*{{text|say|Theldruin the Lost|Theldurin the Lost!}}
*{{text|say|Theldruin the Lost|Get punched!}}
*{{text|say|Theldruin the Lost|I'm going to punch that dragon right in the face!}}
*{{text|say|Theldruin the Lost|I'm coming for you, Deathwing!}}

After clearing the last rock heap, Deathwing, in humanoid form, is standing inside a flame ring. At 858 million health, he has the highest health yet encountered in WoW.

Charge in and punch him in the face! Theldurin's story ends at that point. Talk to him again to complete the quest.

After completing the quest, {{NPC||Lucien Tosselwrench}} speaks up and offers the followup.
:{{text|say|Lucien Tosselwrench|No, no, no, Theldurin. You're telling the story wrong!}}
