== Objectives ==
Obtain 6 Wild Black Dragon Eggs.
*[[Wild Black Dragon Egg]] x6

== Description ==
I am experimenting with [[black dragon]]s. Specifically, I am interested in how they procreate.

My current experiments require plenty of black dragon eggs, which is why I am here in [[Lethlor Ravine]]. I'd gather the eggs myself, but I think you'll benefit from helping me out.

You will find them along the edges of the ravine. Beware the {{NPC||Scorched Guardian||guardians}} that circle above - they do not appreciate stolen eggs.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||65}}

== Progress ==
Have you brought the eggs?

== Completion ==
Thank you for gathering these so quickly, <name>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Second Sample: Whelps]] before heading out. The eggs are along the edges of the ravine. Kill whelps along the way. Looting eggs will aggro Scorched Guardians that are too close, so watch out!

==Progression==
{{Badlands storyline}}

== Patch changes ==
