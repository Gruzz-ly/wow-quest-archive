*Warden's Game Completed

==Description==
You see the statue split into two, then four, then eight identical statues in a square formation.

You hear a voice, not through your ears, but in the back of your mind:

:"A true warden does not face OUTWARD, searching for signs of danger.<br/>A true warden keeps his gaze INWARD, always focused on protecting his quarry."

Perhaps this is a riddle of some sort?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*7,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The jade statue becomes one again, and you place it in your pocket. You hear a shifting noise in the tomb's central chamber.

==Notes==
The game starts with all eight of the pieces facing outward and the objective is to have all the pieces facing inward. Pick an edge piece (e.g. the one on the north end) and click on it to teleport it to the center. Then click on the edge piece opposite the empty side (the southern piece in this example) and click it to move it across so it's facing inward (now on the north side), then click the middle piece to move it to the newly empty side so it too is facing inward (now on the south side). Then repeat the process for the other six pieces. Done properly, it only takes 12 clicks.  Complete both games to be offered [[Ancient Protectors]].
