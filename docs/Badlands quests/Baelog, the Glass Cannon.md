== Objectives ==
Use Baelog's Valhalla Shot and Baelog's Warcry.
*Use Baelog's Valhalla Shot
*Use Baelog's Warcry

== Description ==
Before I start droppin' arrows on those dragons, I'd better introduce myself.

I'm Baelog, the muscle of this group. My sword bites like a crocolisk, and my arrows sing like banshees. I tend to wear down quickly, however, and can't take as much punishment as either of my two brothers.

You give the word, and I'll send an aimed shot right through your target's heart. I can also cheer my brothers on, sending 'em into a battle-fueled frenzy.

Why don't we go try fighting together?

== Progress ==
We're not quite ready yet. A little more practice, then we'll get with the dragon-slaying.

== Completion ==
I think you're ready, <name>. You're getting the hang of this.

== Notes ==
[[File:The Swift, the Fierce, and the Stout helmet.jpg|thumb|The viking helmet on the player's head.]]
Pick up [[Eric, the Utility Dwarf]] and [[Olaf, the Big Fella']] before heading out. Accepting the first of these quests put all three of the [[Lost Dwarves]] into the player party (and also puts a viking helmet on the player character's head). Now as minions of the player, all three dwarves have their two abilities listed:
#{{Abilities|Eric's Charge|id=87278|range=25|Eric charges an enemy, inflicting X Physical damage, and stunning it for 3 sec.|cd=15 sec|notes=Instant.|icon=inv_gauntlets_05}}
#{{Abilities|Eric's Pocket Potion|id=87279|Heals all vikings by X over 10 sec.|cd=2 min|notes=Instant.|icon=inv_potion_77}}
#{{abilities|Baelog's Valhalla Shot|id=87281|range=100|Baelog shoots at an enemy, inflicting Physical damage and dealing high threat.|cd=15 sec|notes=Instant.|icon=ability_marksmanship}}
#{{abilities|Baelog's Warcry|id=87280|Increases all vikings' attack speed by 200% for 15 sec.|cd=1 min|notes=Instant.|icon=spell_nature_bloodlust}}
#{{abilities|Olaf's Shield Wall|id=87282|Reduces the Physical and magical damage taken by Olaf by 75% for 10 sec.|cd=30 sec|notes=Instant.|icon=ability_warrior_shieldwall}}
#{{abilities|Olaf's Mighty Shout|id=87283|Taunts the target to attack Olaf, but has no effect if the target is already attacking Olaf.|cd=15 sec|notes=Instant|icon=spell_nature_reincarnation}}
Merely getting within range of a target is all that necessary for the vikings to attack. Head out and use all of the vikings' abilities to complete the quests.
