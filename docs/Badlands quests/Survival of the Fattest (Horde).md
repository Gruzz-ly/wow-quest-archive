We're hard-up for supplies, stranger. With the black dragons raining destruction on our hunting grounds, we have no way to get food.

The ogres to our south, however, have exactly what we need. Within their grotto you should find plenty of meat and crafting supplies.

They may put up a fight. Be on your guard.

I imagine those ogres weren't too much trouble for you. Here - some coin for your troubles.
