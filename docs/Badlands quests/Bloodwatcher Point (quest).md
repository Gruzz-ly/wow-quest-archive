==Objectives==
Speak with [[High Examiner Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher]] at [[Bloodwatcher Point]] in the [[Badlands]].

==Description==
I've got an idea, but it's a bit of a long shot.  Thankfully, long shots happen to be a specialty of mine.

North of here, the [[Reliquary]] has uncovered a new set of [[titan]] ruins beneath the sands.  If there's anything older and wiser than [[dragon]]s, it's titans.  Heck, I've heard rumors that the titans CREATED the dragons.

Talk to High Examiner Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher at their camp to the northeast.  He'll have more information than I do about these titans.

What did I tell you?  It's a long shot.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|700}} (+{{coppercost|330}} at max level)

==Completion==
Titans?  You come to me, asking about titans?

You've come to the right place, as we're on the brink of discovering something big.  You will, however, need to earn your keep first. 

==Progression==
