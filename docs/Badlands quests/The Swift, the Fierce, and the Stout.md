== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Eric "The Swift"]] at [[Dragon's Mouth]] in the [[Badlands]].

== Description ==
In my haste to escape from [[Lethlor Ravine]], I forgot to tie up one loose end: [[Nyxondra]]. She's free, and she's sounded the alarm among the [[black dragonflight]]. Half the flight is here in the western Badlands, combing for this egg.

I'll take care of hiding the egg. You're going to take care of some of the more troublesome dragons. And you'll have help.

Talk to Eric, over on the other side of camp. He and [[Lost Dwarves|his brothers]] will be joining you.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||7}}

== Completion ==
You're the <race> we've been waiting for? It's about time you got here. My legs could use a stretch.

Come on boys! Let's go kill us some black dragons!
