== Objectives ==
Find a use for the Sentinel's Pawn within the [[Tomb of the Watchers]] in the [[Badlands]].
*[[Sentinel's Pawn]] (provided)

== Description ==
We vary nearly had this statue stolen from us by one of {{NPC||High Examiner Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher||Bloodwatcher}}'s [[Reliquary]] stooges. We managed to catch him in the act, and we've retrieved the statue, but it hasn't really paid off.

It appears to be a key of some sort, but I can't find the lock anywhere inside those ruins. You feel like giving it a try?

== Completion ==
<The statue slides into place on the cold marble slab.>

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Warden's Pawn (Alliance)|The Warden's Pawn]] before heading out. Back to the south, then down into the Tomb of the Watchers. Both {{NPC||The Sentinel}} and {{NPC||The Warden}} are just inside, standing idle. Take the first right once inside to find a [[Marble Slab]]. It starts [[The Sentinel's Game]].

==Progression==
{{Badlands storyline}}
