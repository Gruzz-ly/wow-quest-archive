==Objectives==

Slay Velarok the Annihilator and 4 Darkflight Soldiers.
*[[Velarok the Annihilator]] slain
*[[Darkflight Soldier]] slain x4

==Description==
Hello, <name>. It looks like you four have had time to become well-acquainted.

I have my first assignment for you. [[Velarok]], an ancient [[black dragon]] of considerable power, has joined in the hunt for the egg we are protecting. We need to stop him before he gets too close.

You will find him and his minions at the Dustbowl, east of New Kargath. Hunt him down and defeat him. You will likely need the help of your new mercenary allies.

==Completion==
One less dragon to worry about, one step closer to redemption. Onward, my soldiers!

==Notes==
Upon completing the three previous quests, Rhea speaks telepathically, offering this new quest. Remember that the vikings merely need to get within 40 yards of a hostile unit to attack, so don't go crazy. Darkflight Soldiers are level 46 [[drakonid]] with 2388 health. Velarok is an elite [[black drake]] with 9950 health. Use the vikings' abilities—they can take care of Velarok if Olaf stays on top of the aggro list. The quest completes automatically once all five hostiles are killed.
