==Objectives==
Obtain a Broken Chalice, a Dusty Vase, an Earthen Hieroglyph, and a Trogg Tool.
*[[Broken Chalice#Horde]]
*[[Dusty Vase#Horde]]
*[[Earthen Hieroglyph#Horde]]
*[[Trogg Tool#Horde]]

==Description==
The [[Explorers' League]] may have a yeoman's knowledge of the actual act of digging. What they lack, however, is the good sense to USE the artifacts that they dig up. They stow their treasures in stagnant museums instead of using these items of power for their true purpose.

The [[dwarf|dwarves]] are fools. Fortunately, they die easily.

You'll find them digging into canyon walls north of here. Take whatever you can out of their stubby-fingered hands, then return it to me.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Upstart's Breastplate|Counterfeit Chainmail|Excavation Bracers|Hooligan's Pantaloons}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||65}}
*5790 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Progress==
You've returned with liberated artifacts, I presume?

==Completion==
Chalice... worthless.

Vase... counterfeit.

Hieroglyph... interesting, but rather common.

What's this? I've never seen [[trogg]] craftsmanship of this caliber! You've stumbled upon something rare indeed, <name>.

We must not be so hasty as to overlook the troggs. They may be simple, but they know things about the deep, hidden places of this world.

You've performed well enough. Let's talk [[titan]]s, shall we?
