==Objectives==
Enter a [[Blam Turret]], then survive four waves of [[trogg]] attacks.
*Survive first wave
*Survive second wave
*Survive third wave
*Survive final wave

==Description==
I'll need some time to analyze these samples, as well as a brake from this trogg-shooting duty. Go man one of my turrets and take out as many troggs as you can. I'll be here studying.

The turrets have two abilities: a regular shot, as well as an electrical overload, for when too many enemies get close! Heh, heh. Good luck.

Oh, and look out for the big, slow troggs. You probably don't want to let them anywhere near you.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Anti-Trogg Shield|Shrug of Disappointment|Blam Blam Gun}}

You will also receive: {{cost|2}}

==Progress==
Not quite done yet. Need some more time.

==Completion==
The results are in. I've identified traces of corruption in all three samples you brought me. [[Rhea]] will be quite disappointed.

==Notes==
Pick a turret not currently in use and hop in it. Stonevault Ruffians and Goons spawn from all directions. Ruffians are fast movers, but hit for ~60 damage against the turret's 5757 health, but they die in a single hit. Ruffians take two kills, but move slowly to compensate. Keep moving. Top priority is the largest group that is closest to the turret. Each wave spawns progressively more troggs, but they despawn when the wave is cleared.
