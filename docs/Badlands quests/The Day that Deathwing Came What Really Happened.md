== Objectives ==
Listen to {{NPC||Martek the Exiled}}'s version of the story.
*Choose an admirer to save
*Ride to the end of the canyon
*Find Deathwing
*Beat Deathwing in a knife fight

== Description ==
These two have no idea how to tell a story. {{NPC||Theldurin the Lost||Theldurin}}'s story was too short, and {{NPC||Lucien Tosselwrench||Lucien}}'s tale was a little too tall, if you catch my drift.

Also, neither of their stories had hot babes in them.

Sit back, <name>. I'll tell you what really happened that day.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Theldurin's Fist
|Tosselwrench's Shrinker
|Martek's Knife
|Martek's Stick of Truthiness
|Genuine Deathwing Fang
}}

You will also receive:
* 3,150 [[XP]]

== Completion ==
I can't believe those guys would interrupt me like that. My story was going so well, too...

Anyhow, thanks for sticking around so long. It's nice to have someone new to share tall tales with. I'm sure Lucien and Theldurin feel the same way.

You have any you'd like to share with us?

:{{text|bossemote|When I reached the end of the canyon, I remembered that my motorcycle could fly.}}
:{{text|bossemote|That would have been helpful to know earlier.}}
:''Hit space and start flying.''
:{{text|bossemote|I flew up to the pillar located just north of the canyon.}}
:{{text|bossemote|During the flight, I shared a tender moment with the <strapping/grateful young/attractive> <race>.}}
:''Deathwing is again in human form, still with 858 million health.''
:{{text|bossemote|Atop the pillar, I saw him: Deathwing. The time for the ultimate confrontation had arrived.}}
:{{text|yell|Theldurin the Lost|I'm gonna punch that dragon in the face!}}
:''Suddenly, Theldurin appears and punches Deathwing in the face!''
:{{text|bossemote|Hey, stop it Theldurin! This is my story!}}
:''A gigantic Lucien can be seen walking around the side of the pillar to the west.''
:{{text|bossemote|Cut it out guys! Quit interrupting!}}

On completion:
:{{text|say|Theldurin the Lost|Sorry about the interruption, Martek. You've gotta admit though... I made your story about fifty times better. Next drink's on me.}}
