== Objectives ==
Slay Nyxondra and 12 of Nyxondra's Broodlings.
*[[Nyxondra]] slain
*[[Nyxondra's Broodling]] slain x12

== Description ==
My greatest regret is the treatment that we - no, I - gave to Nyxondra. I forced her to lay eggs, then I performed experiments on them. Over, and over, and over again.

Even as a mother myself, I can only imagine her sorrow.

No... I mustn't be weak. Our work is, after all, for the benefit of future generations of [[black dragonflight|black dragons]]. Her sacrifice was necessary.

She circles the [[Ruins of Kargath]], northwest of [[New Kargath]], insane with fury. Please, heroes... put her out of her misery.

== Completion ==
Just think... Nyxondra may end up being the mother of the new black dragonflight. In death, she has given a gift to the future generations of [[Azeroth]].

== Notes ==
Quickly head down the tower, but before turning southeast down the hill down to ground level, turn to the northwest instead and jump down the hill to the ruins of Kargath. The valley is filled with broodlings. The Vikings can take care of them without babysitting. Keep an eye up for Nyxondra and head in her general direction. She is a level 47 elite with nearly 20,000 health. Repeat the elite-killing tactics to kill her. Then kill a path out of the valley to the northeast, circling back toward the [[Scar of the Worldbreaker]]. Note that the next quest is north of New Kargath. The quest will complete automatically.

Nyxondra casts an AoE fear that will have you and your mercs running wildly in all direction on one, two or three occasions during the fight if you have no means of resisting/dispelling: that being the case you should ensure that you have cleared a large area of whelplings before the fight or you may end up with more adds than you can cope with.
