==Objectives==
Complete the Sentinel's Game by connecting the two red statues.
*Sentinel's Game Completed

==Description==
As you place the statue in its place, several other stone statues appear in the room. One more ruby-colored statue also appears, in a small enclosure on the far end of the room. You hear a voice:

:"The Sentinel watches.<br/>The Sentinel protects. The Sentinel's vision never falters."

That red statue on the other side of the room looks important. Perhaps you should try to connect the two red statues?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*7,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The red statue falls over, and you place it back in your bags. You hear a rumbling noise in the tomb's central chamber.>

==Notes==
A large number of sentinel's pawns spawn, visible only to the player. Each one can rotate to three different positions. The objective is to link the pawns from one end of the room to the other by connecting them via the red beam. There is only one solution. Winning the game completes the quest automatically. Exit the room to the south, cross the central chamber, then turn back to the southwest to reach the southern room with the [[Stone Slab]] that ends [[The Warden's Pawn]] and starts [[The Warden's Game]]. Complete both games to be offered [[Ancient Protectors (quest)]].
