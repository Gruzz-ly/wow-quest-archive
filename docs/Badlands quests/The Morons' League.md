== Objectives ==
Obtain 15 Dark Iron Heads.
*[[Dark Iron Head]]

== Description ==
I need your help in a little project I'm working on, <name>. It falls into a realm I like to call "defensive archaeology".

I like to bury non-magical items in conspicuous places to fool those Alliance idiots into thinking they've found something valuable.

Hmm... [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron dwarves]] wander [[Hammertoe's Digsite]] and [[Angor Fortress]], to the north. Bring their heads back to me. Yes, that's right, their heads.

Once the flesh is stripped, we can use those skulls to interfere with the dwarves' work.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||65}}

== Progress ==
<Lidia waits expectantly.>

== Completion ==
Excellent!  We'll bury these immediately.  Those [[Explorers' League]] dimwits will never suspect us!

==Progression==
{{Badlands storyline}}

== Patch changes ==
