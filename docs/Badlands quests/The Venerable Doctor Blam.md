== Objectives ==
Bring the Black Dragon Samples to {{NPC||Dr. Hieronymus Blam}} at [[Agmond's End]] in the [[Badlands]].
*[[Black Dragon Samples]] (provided)

== Description ==
I made a calculated decision in revealing my identity to you, <name>. I needed you to trust me, but I can no longer stay here in [[Lethlor Ravine]], as my cover has quite clearly been blown.

You may be able to slip away unnoticed, however. Here, take the results of our research, and bring them west. At Agmond's End, you will find a [[gnome]] who knows what to do with these samples.

Hurry, <name>! You mustn't loiter here any longer than necessary!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||30}}

== Progress ==
Dr. H. Blam, at your service. How can I be of assistance to you today?

== Completion ==
Ooh! Science stuff! Let's see what you've got here...

Wild eggs? Blech. Useless. These are never any good.

Ooooh, what's this? Some sort of... pre-engineered egg? This looks promising, but I don't want to know what {{NPC||Rhea}} had to do to get it.

Hmm... yes, some very nice corpses. Very nice indeed.

Alright, I'll see what I can do.

== Notes ==
Exit Lethlor Ravine to the north and circle southwest to reach Agmond's End. The good doctor can be found in the middle of the ruined camp, which is littered with [[trogg]] corpses.

==Progression==
{{Badlands storyline}}
