==Objectives==
Listen to [[Lucien Tosselwrench]]'s version of the story.
*Grow large enough to reach the clouds
*Clouds searched (5)
*Find Deathwing

==Description==
Not only was [[Theldurin the Lost|Theldurin]]'s story wrong, it was boring, unimaginative, and slow.

I'll tell you how things really happened on that day.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm not done with my story yet.  Sit back down.

==Completion==
The end! No moral.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|bossemote|First of all, it wasn't sunny out. It was cloudy when Deathwing appeared.}}
:''The camera tilts up to look at the sky, and Deathwing.''
:{{text|bossemote|The cowardly dragon must have seen me, because he turned away and flew into the clouds.}}
:{{text|bossemote|"I'll find you in those clouds, you worm!" I yelled. "And then I'll throw you to Kalimdor!"}}
:{{text|yell|Lucien Tosselwrench|I'll find you in those clouds, you worm!}}
:{{text|yell|Lucien Tosselwrench|And then I'll throw you to Kalimdor!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Luckily, I had been tinkering with my world-shrinking device.}}
:{{text|bossemote|I decided to keep shrinking the world until I could reach the clouds.}}
''Keep "shrinking the world" until...''
:{{text|bossemote|Once the world was small enough, I started to hunt for Deathwing in the clouds.}}
''Walk around the Badlands and look for clouds to search them. He has some random commentary during the process''
*{{text|say|Lucien Tosselwrench|When I find that dragon, I'm gonna throw him to Kalimdor.}}
*{{text|say|Lucien Tosselwrench|Surprise, dragon! Aw, shucks.}}
*{{text|say|Lucien Tosselwrench|Where you at?}}
*{{text|say|Lucien Tosselwrench|Where are you, dragon?}}
*{{text|say|Lucien Tosselwrench|He can't have gotten far...}}
:{{text|bossemote|I had searched every cloud, but I couldn't find Deathwing.}}
:{{text|bossemote|It was then that I realized: he was hiding in the sun. I looked up.}}
''Look up. Right-click the "sun" to reveal Deathwing.''
:{{text|bossemote|The sun burned me bad, but I got my hands around his slimy neck.}}
:''Lucien gets knocked down to 10% health, but he is holding the "Cowardly Deathwing".''
:{{text|bossemote|I summoned all my strength, faced west, and threw him to Kalimdor.}}
On completion, [[Martek the Exiled]] offers the followup:
:{{text|say|Theldurin the Lost|Wow, Lucien. You need to stop drinking RIGHT NOW.}}

===Bugs===
;Sun despawns
The sun may despawn when clicked, without giving credit for the quest. This may be fixed by: Exiting the "vehicle", talking to Lucien again without abandoning the quest, growing back to full size, and clicking on one or two clouds to get the sun to reappear.

;Sun is not clickable
Attempting to click on the sun may give a "too far away" error, accompanied by the gray "cannot interact" icon. This may be fixed by: Exiting the "vehicle", talking to Lucien again without abandoning the quest, growing '''''only once''''' rather than the "required" five times, interacting with a cloud (which triggers the sun again), and then clicking on it while remaining at the "single grow" size.<ref>{{ref web|title=The Day that Deathwing Came: The Real Story (comments) |url=https://www.wowhead.com/quest=27714/the-day-that-deathwing-came-the-real-story#comments |author=cmstringers, mcapone888, Kaynos |date=2025-05-04 |publisher=[[Wowhead]]}}</ref> Some terrain spots may work better than others (the sun spawns directly above the cloud that triggered it), since the relative height of player and sun seems to be the primary factor.

==Trivia==
The line "The end! No moral." is a shout-out to [http://achewood.com/index.php?date=04032006 Achewood], about the only thing more surreal than this quest chain.
