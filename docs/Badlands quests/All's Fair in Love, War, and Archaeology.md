==Objectives==
Obtain a Broken Chalice, a Dusty Vase, an Earthen Hieroglyph, and a Trogg Tool.
*[[Broken Chalice]]
*[[Dusty Vase]]
*[[Earthen Hieroglyph]]
*[[Trogg Tool]]

==Description==
First things first, though. I'm not just going to sit here and tell you everything we've discovered down in those ruins. We've got problems to take care of!

Most pressing is those upstart [[The Reliquary]] hooligans, just on the other side of the tomb. They're making off with all of our loot! Don't they know that diggin's dwarf work?

Hunt down a few of their "excavators" - more like bandits, if you ask me - and bring some of these precious artifacts back to me.

THEN we'll talk [[titan]]s.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Upstart's Breastplate|Counterfeit Chainmail|Excavation Bracers|Hooligan's Pantaloons}}

You will also receive: {{cost||65}}

==Progress==
Your bags look heavy. Heavy with liberated artifacts, I presume?

==Completion==
Chalice... worthless.

Vase... counterfit.

Hieroglyph... interesting, but rather common.

What's this? I've never seen [[trogg]] craftsmanship of this caliber! You've stumbled upon something rare indeed, <name>.

Alright, fine. Let's talk titans, shall we?

==Notes==
[[A Dwarf's Got Needs]] is a separate quest line, not directly attached to this one. South of Dustwind Dig is the [[Tomb of the Watchers]], the new titan structure revealed during the [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]]. [[Bloodwatcher Point]], the horde camp on this side of the Badlands, is on its southern edge. Southeast of there, along the edges of the valley, Reliquary Excavators are busy digging. Go killing.
