==Objectives==
Ride ''The Uncrashable'' to the [[Badlands]], then report to {{NPC||Eddie Flofizzle}}.

==Description==
Hey, <race>, listen up. I got a job opportunity that you aren't gonna want to miss out on.

We been sent up here from [[Fuselight]], a new [[goblin]] town way down in the Badlands. Lots of money to be had down there, yes <sir/ma'am>. And not nearly so many [[zombie]]s... or uptight [[Argent Crusade|Argent]] paladin-types.

Nope, it's an untamed wilderness down there, and we're looking for someone like you to help us tame it. Whenever you're ready... we'll be waiting. 

==Completion==

Nice landing!

==Notes==

Accepting this quest takes you on a rocket called ''[[The Uncrashable]]'' that flies directly towards the Badlands. Between each zone, the rocket fires an extra burst of thrust. Mousing over the rocket's UI indicator reveals that the rocket's pilot is named [[Gobby Nozzlerocket]].
