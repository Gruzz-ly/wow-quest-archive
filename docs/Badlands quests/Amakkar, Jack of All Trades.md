*Use Amakkar's Kidney Shot
*Use Amakkar's Pocket Potion

==Description==
Before we get too crazy with the dragon-killing, let me tell you a little bit about how I fight.

I'm not terribly strong or stalwart like these other two, but I've got a few tricks. At your command I'll stun your enemies to keep 'em held still. I also make sure to keep a few potions around for tight spots.

Why don't we practice fighting together? Head out into the field, and you can see what it's like to fight with a real orc.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|0}} (+{{coppercost|1800}} at max level)

==Progress==
We're not through yet, <name>.

==Completion==
I'm looking forward to fighting with you.

==Notes==
[[File:The Bad Dogs mounted.jpg|thumb|The Bad Dogs on their motorcycles.]]
Pick up [[Gargal, the Behemoth]] and [[Jurrix the Striker]] before heading out. Accepting the first of these quests put all three of the [[Bad Dogs]] into the player's party. Now as minions of the player, all three mercenaries have their two abilities listed:
#{{Abilities|Amakkar's Kidney Shot|id=87608|range=25|Amakkar charges an enemy, inflicting X Physical damage, and stunning it for 3 sec.|cd=15 sec|notes=Instant.|icon=inv_gauntlets_05}}
#{{Abilities|Amakkar's Pocket Potion|id=87609|Heals all mercenaries by X over 10 sec.|cd=2 min|notes=Instant.|icon=inv_potion_77}}
#{{Abilities|Jurrix's Fiery Blast|id=87612|range=100|Jurrix shoots a fireball at an enemy, inflicting Fire damage and causing high threat.|cd=15 sec|notes=instant|icon=spell_fire_fireball02}}
#{{Abilities|Jurrix's Time Warp|id=87611|Increases all mercenaries' attack speed by 200% for 15 sec.|cd=1 min|notes=Instant|icon=ability_mage_timewarp}}
#{{Abilities|Gargal's Shield Wall|id=87613|Reduces the Physical and magical damage taken by Gargal by 75% for 10 sec.|cd=30 sec|notes=Instant|icon=ability_warrior_shieldwall}}
#{{Abilities|Gargal's Mighty Shout|id=87614|Taunts the target to attack Gargal, but has no effect if the target is already attacking Gargal.|cd=15 sec|notes=Instant|icon=spell_nature_reincarnation}}
If the player mounts up, the Bad Dogs will mount up on [[Mechano-Hog]]s. Merely getting within range of a target is all that necessary for the mercenaries to attack. Head out and use all of the mercenaries' abilities to complete the quests.
