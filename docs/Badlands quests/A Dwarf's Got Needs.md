==Objectives==
Obtain 15 mugs of Shadowstout.
*[[Shadowstout]] (15)

==Description==
I can appreciate a good diggin' as much as any other [[dwarf]], don't get me wrong. It's just that... well, we do so much diggin', and so little drinkin', that sometimes I wonder if I should just hang up me shovel and head back to [[Ironforge]].

But not today. I've got some diggin' in me yet.

Those [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron dwarves]] at [[Hammertoe's Digsite]] - just north of here - make some powerful fine beer, right here in [[Badlands|the desert]]. You think you could pick up a few for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||65}}

==Progress==
<Sigrun licks his lips in anticipation.>

==Completion==
<Sigrun instantly downs a dusty mug of shadowstout.>

Wow, this stuff is strong! I knew they had beer, but I never expected them to have shadowstout! That's my favorite [[shadowbeer]]!

==Notes==
[[All's Fair in Love, War, and Archaeology]] is a different quest line, not directly attached to this one. Circle around to the northeast and go Dark Iron killing. They may carry up to two each.
