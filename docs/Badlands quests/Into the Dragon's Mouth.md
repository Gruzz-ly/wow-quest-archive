== Objectives ==
Bring the Purified Black Dragon Egg to {{NPC||Rhea}} at [[Dragon's Mouth]] in the [[Badlands]].
*[[Purified Black Dragon Egg]] (provided)

== Description ==
<Dr. Blam stares at the egg in awed silence, blinks a few times, then looks up at you.>

D... did you see that? Incredible! My [[titan]] thing idea worked! With your help, of course.

We'll want to get these back to Rhea. She's not at [[Lethlor Ravine]] any more; it sounds like she blew her cover pretty well when she transformed into her {{NPC||Rheastrasza||true form}} in front of all those whelps. She's now in the west, staying at an [[Alliance]] camp called Dragon's Mouth.

She'll be waiting for you. And that egg.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||35}}

== Progress ==
That's some precious cargo you carry there, <name>.

== Completion ==
I'll take that egg out of your hands now. We need to get this egg incubated... and hidden, quickly. There are lots of angry dragons looking for this.

It's good to see you again, by the way.

== Notes ==
Run south around the pillar, then cross through the [[Scar of the Worldbreaker]]. There's an obvious pass. On the north side, keep running west through the [[Dustbowl]] to reach both [[New Kargath]] on the northwest end and Dragon's Mouth on the southwest end. Make sure to pick up the flight path while getting to Rhea's position.

All of the quests outside of [[The Swift, the Fierce, and the Stout]] are optional and will not directly advance the storyline. Talk to the lost vikings to continue the chain.

==Progression==
