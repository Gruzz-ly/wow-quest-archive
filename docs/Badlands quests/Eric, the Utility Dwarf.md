== Objectives ==
Use Eric's Charge and Eric's Pocket Potion.
*Use Eric's Charge
*Use Eric's Pocket Potion

== Description ==
Before we get too crazy with the dragon-killin', let me tell you a little bit about how I fight.

"The Swift" is what they call me, and there's why: I'll dash straight into your enemies - helmet first, mind you - and stun 'em for a few seconds. I also keep a few potions with me for tight spots.

Why don't we practice fightin' together? Head out into the field, and try my abilities.

== Progress ==
We're not through yet, <name>.

== Completion ==
I'm not what you'd call "very strong" or "battle-hardened", but I get the job done my own way.

Lookin' forward to fightin' with you. I never fought with a fancy-lookin' <class> before.

== Notes ==
[[File:The Swift, the Fierce, and the Stout helmet.jpg|thumb|The viking helmet on the player's head.]]
Pick up [[Baelog, the Glass Cannon]] and [[Olaf, the Big Fella']] before heading out. Accepting the first of these quests put all three of the [[Lost Dwarves]] into the player party (and also puts a viking helmet on the player character's head). Now as minions of the player, all three dwarves have their two abilities listed:
#{{Abilities|Eric's Charge|id=87278|range=25|Eric charges an enemy, inflicting X Physical damage, and stunning it for 3 sec.|cd=15 sec|notes=Instant.|icon=inv_gauntlets_05}}
#{{Abilities|Eric's Pocket Potion|id=87279|Heals all vikings by X over 10 sec.|cd=2 min|notes=Instant.|icon=inv_potion_77}}
#{{abilities|Baelog's Valhalla Shot|id=87281|range=100|Baelog shoots at an enemy, inflicting Physical damage and dealing high threat.|cd=15 sec|notes=Instant.|icon=ability_marksmanship}}
#{{abilities|Baelog's Warcry|id=87280|Increases all vikings' attack speed by 200% for 15 sec.|cd=1 min|notes=Instant.|icon=spell_nature_bloodlust}}
#{{abilities|Olaf's Shield Wall|id=87282|Reduces the Physical and magical damage taken by Olaf by 75% for 10 sec.|cd=30 sec|notes=Instant.|icon=ability_warrior_shieldwall}}
#{{abilities|Olaf's Mighty Shout|id=87283|Taunts the target to attack Olaf, but has no effect if the target is already attacking Olaf.|cd=15 sec|notes=Instant|icon=spell_nature_reincarnation}}
Merely getting within range of a target is all that necessary for the vikings to attack. Head out and use all of the vikings' abilities to complete the quests.
