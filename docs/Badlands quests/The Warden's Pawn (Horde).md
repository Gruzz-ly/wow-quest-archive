==Objectives==
Find a use for the Warden's Pawn within the Tomb of the Watchers in the Badlands.

==Description==
One of the few items of worth that we managed to loot from these ruins is this small jade statue.

We believe it to be a key of some sort, but we're unable to determine what it opens.  As such, it is useless to me.

Perhaps you'll have some better luck with it.

== Completion ==
<The statue clicks into place on the large stone slab.>

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Sentinel's Pawn (Horde)|The Sentinel's Pawn]] before heading out. Back to the south, then down into the Tomb of the Watchers. Both {{NPC||The Sentinel}} and {{NPC||The Warden}} are just inside, standing idle. Do The Sentinel's Pawn first by taking the first right and completing [[The Sentinel's Game]]. See that quest for more information. Once done, exit the western room through its southern end, cross the central room to the east, then circle down to the southern room to find the [[Stone Slab]].

==Progression==
