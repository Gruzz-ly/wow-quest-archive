== Objectives ==
Witness the final piece of {{NPC||Rhea}}'s studies.

== Description ==
The [[black dragonflight]] was once noble. They were the earth warders, protecting the very land itself. How ironic that they would become the worst menace the land has known.

I believe that there remains a sliver of hope, however, and so does my mistress. The black dragonflight will live beyond {{NPC||Deathwing}}'s treachery, and will soar as the noble earth warders once again.

I wish to show you something. Close your eyes, and I will reveal to you the final part of my studies.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}

== Progress ==
You are certainly impatient, <name>.

== Completion ==
We will find a shred of good within these dragons, <name>. Whether it is in the wild eggs you found, the bodies of the [[whelp]]lings you slew, or the eggs we have encouraged {{NPC||Nyxondra}} to lay... we will find an untainted black dragon.

== Notes ==
On accept:
