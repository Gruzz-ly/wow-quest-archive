== Objectives ==
Search for treasure in the bottom floor of [[Angor Fortress]].
*[[Engraved Tablets of Golganneth]]

== Description ==
I've got a little proposition for you, if you're interested.

Those [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Irons]] were here before {{NPC||Lead Prospector Durdin||Durdin}} and [[Explorers' League|his crew]] arrived. That means that, once these [[Tomb of the Watchers|titan ruins]] opened up, the dark irons were the first ones in there, lootin' all the good stuff. I'll bet they've still got those treasures locked up inside Angor Fortress, northwest of here.

You've more than proven your ability to wallop a dwarf. Head on into that fortress and wallop your way to [[titan]] treasure.

I'd go with, but [[A Dwarf's Got Needs|I'm drunk]].

== Progress ==
Back so soon?

== Completion ==
Now here's some treasure! I was beginning to worry that these weren't titan ruins at all!

I'll show these to Durdin. Thanks again, <name>.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Ironhew Cloak|Angor Pauldrons|Walloper's Chestpiece|Dust Bowl Shield|Dustwind Cowl}}

You will also receive: {{cost||65}}

== Notes ==
Enter the fortress, take a right, go straight, then down the stairs. {{NPC||Ambassador Infernus}}, a level 46 fire elemental with 3,000 health, is at the bottom, blocking [[Angor's Coffer]]! Kill it, loot the coffer, then retrace steps back to the surface.

==Progression==
{{Badlands storyline}}
