==Objectives==
Use Garyanne's Goat Puncher on 12 Billy Goats in [[Fuselight]].
*[[Billy Goat]]s nudged x12
*[[Billy Goat Blaster]] (provided)

==Description==
We have a little bit of a [[goat]] problem here in Fuselight, in case you haven't noticed. They'll eat anything, and seem to have taken a liking to the piles of cogs and gears that we tend to leave sitting around.

It's getting really annoying!

You'll find most of the billy goats wandering around the edge of town, near the cliff's edge. Use this device on them to give 'em a little "nudge."

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||65}}

==Progress==
It's their own fault for standing so close to the edge.

==Completion==
Well done! I have no doubt that those goats will be back, but they'll think twice before they nibble my cogs again!

==Notes==
Mount up, find a billy goat, and nudge it. Then go nudge some more. They're not going to go splat! They will safely land ...down... of wherever they were.

==Progression==
