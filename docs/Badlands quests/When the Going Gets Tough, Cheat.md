== Objectives ==
Obtain an Instructor's Rod from an {{NPC||Ogre-Mage Instructor}} at [[Camp Kosh]].
*[[Instructor's Rod]]

== Description ==
I can't get my invention to work! Gah!

That's it. I've decided. I'm going to cheat and use magic.

What my invention really needs is a solid piston that's thin enough to fit through a narrow copper tube, but strong enough to withstand repeated impact without breaking. The magical rods carried by those [[ogre mage|ogre magi]] to the north should work perfectly.

From what I can tell, only the instructors carry the strong staves.

== Progress ==
I don't like to stoop to using magic on my inventions, but this is somewhat of an emergency.

== Completion ==
A perfect fit! My {{NPC||Billy Goat||goat}} puncher is finally finished!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Goat Horn Band|Fuselight Chainmail|Goat Hide Boots|Goat Skin Mask|Wooly Goat Punchers}}

You will also receive: {{cost||65}}

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Easily Swayed]] before heading out. Follow the path down to the northwest into [[Dustwind Gulch]]. Camp Kosh is in the northeast corner.

==Progression==
{{Badlands storyline}}

== Patch changes ==
