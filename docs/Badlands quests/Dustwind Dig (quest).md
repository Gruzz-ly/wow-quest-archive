== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Lead Prospector Durdin}} at [[Dustwind Dig]] in the [[Badlands]].

== Description ==
I've got an idea, but it's a bit of a longshot. Thankfully, long shots happen to be a specialty of mine.

North of here, the [[Explorers' League]] has uncovered a new set of [[titan]] ruins beneath the sands. If there's anything older and wiser than [[dragon]]s, it's titans. Heck, I've heard rumors that the titans CREATED the dragons.

Talk to Lead Prospector Durdin at the camp to the north. He'll have more information than I do about these titans.

What did I tell you? It's a long shot.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||7}}

== Completion ==
Titans? You want to know about titans?

You came to the right place, <lad/lass>. We're on the brink of somethin' big.

== Notes ==
Head north past the [[Scar of the Worldbreaker]] to Dustwind Dig. Durdin is in the middle of camp. Don't forget the flight path!

==Progression==
