== Objectives ==
Wait as {{NPC||Rhea}} retrieves the egg from the [[Hidden Clutch]].
*Wait for Rhea to retrieve the egg

== Description ==
Wait here. I will retrieve the egg.

== Completion ==
Thankfully, you have avoided {{NPC||Deathwing}}'s notice. Rhea and the [[black dragon]] egg, however, may not have been so lucky...

== Notes ==
Accept the quest and a cutscene happens. The camera pans up to the cave and Rhea walks in...
:{{text|say|Rhea|I'll just leave this right here.}}
:''Rhea drops off a scroll, then keeps walking to the back of the cave.''
:{{text|say|Rhea|How's my little baby doing?}}
:''Rhea picks up the egg, holding it carefully as she walks towards the exit. Just as she walks towards the exit, she spots someone sitting at the cave's entrance: Deathwing.''
:{{text|say|Rhea|No... it's... it's you! NO!}}
:''Rhea cowers, putting the egg behind her. The camera pans around and Deathwing, in dragon form, peers into the cave!''
:{{text|say|Deathwing|You impetuous little whelp... I know exactly what you and the mortal are up to.}}
:{{text|say|Deathwing|Are you ready to die, dragon?}}
:{{text|say|Rhea|Yes. Just... just show mercy to the egg.}}
:{{text|yell|Deathwing|Mercy?!}}
:{{text|yell|Deathwing|THERE IS NO MERCY! YOU WILL BURN FOR THIS, DRAGON!}}
:''Deathwing channels Flame Breath, incinerating the cave. Damage done, Deathwing turns and flies away. The camera follows him, then cuts down to the location where the player is hiding.''
The quest completes automatically upon the conclusion of the cutscene.
