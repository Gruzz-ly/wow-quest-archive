== Objectives ==
Search for {{NPC||Rheastrasza}}.

== Description ==
The coast is clear. If Rheastrasza or the egg were able to miraculously evade {{NPC||Deathwing}}'s flames, they would probably need your assistance as soon as possible.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||7}}

== Completion ==
Heroes:

If you are reading this, then my suspicions were correct. Deathwing has found us. The egg is destroyed, as am I.

This was, actually, the plan from the beginning. You see... the egg that Deathwing destroyed was not the egg he sought.

It was mine.

== Notes ==
Run up the hill into the cave. It is filled with fire. However, [[Rhea's Final Note]] is where she left it, just inside. Completing the quest, {{NPC||Dr. Hieronymus Blam}} appears at the mouth of the cave. He continues the storyline.
