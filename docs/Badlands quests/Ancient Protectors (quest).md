== Objectives ==
Investigate The Warden and The Sentinel.
*Thoroughly investigated {{NPC||The Warden}}
*Thoroughly Investigated {{NPC||The Sentinel}}

== Description ==
You heard a good amount of rumbling happen in [[Tomb of the Watchers|the tomb's]] central chamber. Those two large statues did look awfully suspicious.

== Completion ==
With your inspection complete, the statues return to their original position. Something seems different in the room, however...

== Notes ==
The warden is jade, standing facing south.
:Judging by its color, this must be The Warden.
:You see a small indentation where your pawn might fit.
{{gossip|''<Place the pawn in the indentation.>''}}

The Warden stretches its arms, then turns hostile! It is a level 46 stone golem with 3838 health. Kill it to "thoroughly investigate" it.

The sentinel is red, standing facing north toward the entrance of the tomb proper.
:This red statue looks a lot like the Sentinel's pawn that you hold.
:The statue has a small indentation that matches the size of your pawn.
{{gossip|''<Place the pawn in the indentation.>''}}

Just like the warden, the sentinel also stretches, then turns hostile. Kill it as well. Once both stone golems have been "investigated", the quest completes automatically.

On complete, a large chest appears at the southern end of the room!
