== Objectives ==
Obtain 6 pieces of Dustbelcher Meat and 10 sheets of Dustbelcher Silk.
*[[Dustbelcher Meat]] x6
*[[Dustbelcher Silk]] x10

== Description ==
We're hard-up for supplies, stranger. With the black dragons raining destruction on what would be our hunting grounds, we have no way to get food.

The ogres to our southwest, however, have exactly we need. Within [[Dustbelch Grotto|their grotto]] you should find plenty of meat and crafting supplies.

They may put up a fight. Be on your guard.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|35}}

== Progress ==
Welcome back.

== Completion ==
I imagine those ogres weren't too much trouble for you. Here - some coin for your troubles.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Half-Ton Holdouts (Alliance)|Half-Ton Holdouts]] before heading out. Circle around to the southwest around the pillar and not down toward the [[Scar of the Worldbreaker]] to the southeast. Inside the hovel are Dustbelcher Merchants, who don't drop anything. Instead, look for [[Dustbelcher Chest]]s, which have 2 or 4 Dustbelcher Silk each. Meat is hanging from meathooks all over the cave.
