== Objectives ==
Learn {{NPC||Rhea}}'s true identity.

== Description ==
As I hinted earlier, I am no ordinary [[goblin]]. You may have already guessed my true identity.

Allow me to show you my true form. As you have proven yourself trustworthy, I will also share with you the details of my plan.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||65}}

== Progress ==
You are certainly impatient, <name>.

== Completion ==
My true name is {{NPC||Rheastrasza}}, and I am an envoy of {{NPC||Alexstrasza}} herself, the [[Dragon Aspect|Aspect]] of the [[red dragonflight]].

With {{NPC||Deathwing}} currently occupied with other matters, we are going to find a way to redeem the [[black dragonflight]].

And you are going to help us.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Rhea|Deathwing's madness overcomes him, and we, the red dragonflight, must take this opportunity to steal his black dragons from beneath him. We will remake the black dragons as they are intended to be: the warders of the earth.}}
:''Rhea enters her true form, that of a fully grown [[red dragon]], Rheastrasza!''
