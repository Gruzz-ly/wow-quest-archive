==Objectives==
Wait as Rhea retrieves the egg from the Hidden Clutch. 

== Completion ==
You were not the only mortal that {{NPC||Rheastrasza}} confided in. I too earned the [[red dragon|dragon's]] trust.

I have already moved the real purified egg on to a safer location, away from the [[Badlands]]. It will continue to grow, out of {{NPC||Deathwing}}'s sight.

The [[red dragonflight]] is as benevolent as it is powerful. It was Rheastraza's final wish that I share this with you.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Rhea's Last Egg}}

You will also receive: {{cost|2|5}}

This concludes the main storyline. Check back at camp for remaining quest lines to complete.
