== Objectives ==
Obtain 3 of Nyxondra's Eggs.
*[[Nyxondra's Egg]] x3

== Description ==
{{NPC||Nyxondra}} is being held against her will. She is hidden from her brood, right in the middle of their breeding grounds. She lays eggs, but they will be taken away before she can see them hatch.

Cruel? Perhaps... but not nearly as cruel as the treatment that [[Black Dragonflight|their dragonflight]] showed my mistress.

Show me that I can trust you, <name>. Take Nyxondra's eggs, and bring them here. You will need to beat Nyxondra into submission before you can take them.

== Progress ==
Remember, <name>... this is for the good of the black dragonflight. We are here to redeem them, not to hurt them. This is but a step in their recovery.

== Completion ==
You have done everything that I have asked you, without question. Our job here in [[Lethlor Ravine]] is done.

It is now time that I revealed everything to you.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Strong Arm Mace|Coercive Pauldrons|Vest of Restraint|Boots of Duress}}

You will also receive: {{cost|1|30}}

== Notes ==
Nyxondra is a level 45 [[black dragon]] with 2772 health. She will aggro, but take her down to 1000 health and shell will slump down in exhaustion, long enough to loot an egg. She will wake up and heal back to full, so beat her back down and loot another egg, then a third.
:Her aggro status will change to {{Aggro|-2|-2}}, lay down, and emote the following:
:{{text|emote|Nyxondra slumps down in exhaustion.}}
:After a while, she'll get up and lay down in her original position, change her aggro status back to {{Aggro|-1|-1}}, and emote the following:
:{{text|emote|Nyxondra appears to be waking up!}}
