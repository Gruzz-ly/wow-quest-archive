== Objectives ==
Slay 9 Dustbelcher ogres at [[Camp Kosh]].
*Dustbelcher slain x9

== Description ==
The most immediate threat to [[Fuselight]] is, without argument, the colony of [[ogre]]s to the northwest.

Most of our ogre neighbors used to be warrior-types, but it seems that more and more of them are practicing magic. I won't have an army of [[ogre mage|ogre-magi]] at my doorstep.

Go take out some of those Dustbelcher ogres. Hopefully they'll get the picture and avoide messing with the might of Fuselight.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||65}}

== Progress ==
I'll feel much better when those ogres are gone.

== Completion ==
I wonder where all of these ogre-magi are coming from? Curious times, indeed.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[When the Going Gets Tough, Cheat]] before heading out. Follow the path down to the northwest into [[Dustwind Gulch]]. Camp Kosh is in the northeast corner. Instructors, Initiates and Trainees all count.
