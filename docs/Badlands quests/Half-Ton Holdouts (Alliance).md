==Objectives==
Slay 12 Dustbelcher Combatants. You may kill [[Dustbelcher Mauler]]s or [[Dustbelcher Shaman]].
*Dustbelcher combatant slain (12)

==Description==
I'd say we have a dragon problem, but it seems like they're a little more interested in [[New Kargath]] than they are in our small encampment. Nevertheless, I've got top men focused on keeping the dragons at bay.

One problem that has gone unchecked, however, is the [[Camp Cagg|ogre camp]] to our southwest. A small army of combatants seems to have appeared outside [[Dustbelch Grotto|their hovel]].

We can't sit and wait for them to flank us, soldier. Thin their ranks beore they thin ours.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Well? What are you waiting for?

==Completion==
Thank you, <race>. However, I'm afraid I don't have much to give you other than this passionate round of applause.

<Terrance looks down into his bags.>

Oh, I do have these. Take your pick.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Survival of the Fattest (Alliance)|Survival of the Fattest]] before heading out. Circle around to the southwest around the pillar and not down toward the [[Scar of the Worldbreaker]] to the southeast. Go crazy-go-nuts on the ogres outside on the surface of Camp Cagg. The ogres inside Dustbelch Grotto aren't part of either quest. They're just in the way.
