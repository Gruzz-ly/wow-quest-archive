==Objectives==
Search for treasure in the bottom floor of [[Angor Fortress]].
*[[Engraved Tablets of Golganneth]]

==Description==
I've got a little proposition for you, if you're interested.

The [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron dwarves]] were here long before we arrived. That means that, once these [[titan]] ruins opened up, the Dark Irons were the first ones in there, looting all the choice items. I'll bet they've still got those treasures locked up inside Angor Fortress, northwest of here.

I want you to find such a treasure... then steal it.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Ironhew Cloak|Angor Pauldrons|Dustwind Vest|Dust Bowl Shield|Sunglow Cowl}}

You will also receive: {{cost||65}}

==Progress==
Back so soon?

==Completion==
I knew it!  The [[Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher|High Examiner]] will be pleased to see this.

Nice work, <race>.

==Notes==
Enter the fortress, take a right, go straight, then down the stairs. [[Ambassador Infernus]], a level 46 fire elemental with 3,000 health, is at the bottom, blocking [[Angor's Coffer]]! Kill it, loot the coffer, then retrace steps back to the surface.
