== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Theldurin the Lost}} at the [[Scar of the Worldbreaker]] in the [[Badlands]].

== Description ==
The Badlands are home to some unusual people, many of whom have been here for quite a long time.

For example, there were three gentlemen who were staying here in town. I forget their names... the [[dwarf]] was Theldurin, I think? Anyhow, they headed south with a pack of full of ale a couple of days ago, and haven't been heard from since. I think they were headed to that big scar.

Would you mind checking in on them? I'd like to make sure they're alright.

== Completion ==
They sent you to check up on us? Pshh... I've been around this desert longer than any of those chumps. We're just soaking in some of the scenery and telling stories about old times.
