==Objectives==
Find a use for the Sentinel's Pawn within the Tomb of the Watchers in the Badlands.
*[[Sentinel's Pawn]] (provided)

==Description==
We found this small red statue on the corpse of one of those [[Explorers' League]] archaeologists. Sadly, it wasn't us who killed him. The local wildlife had already taken care of that.

The statue is well-crafted, but apparently bereft of magical power. You may use it for whatever means you deem necessary.

== Completion ==
<The statue slides into place on the cold marble slab.>

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Warden's Pawn (Horde)|The Warden's Pawn]] before heading out. Back to the south, then down into the Tomb of the Watchers. Both {{NPC||The Sentinel}} and {{NPC||The Warden}} are just inside, standing idle. Take the first right once inside to find a [[Marble Slab]]. It starts [[The Sentinel's Game]].

==Progression==
{{Badlands storyline}}
