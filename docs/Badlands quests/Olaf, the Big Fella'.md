== Objectives ==
Use Olaf's Shield Wall and Olaf's Mighty Shout.
*Use Olaf's Shield Wall
*Use Olaf's Mighty Shout

== Description ==
You may have noticed, but I'm pretty big, as far as dwarves go.

I make sure that my two brothers here don't get into too much trouble. They're small, and they don't have a big shield like me. I'm big, and I can handle a few monsters hitting me! Plus, if I'm careful, I can usually get them to hit my shield instead!

I can protect you, too. Come on, let's go practice for a bit. I'll make sure the enemies attack me, and not you.

== Progress ==
Don't worry, little <race>. I'll protect you.

== Completion ==
See? No need to worry when Olaf is around. Just let me know, and I'll protect you from the monsters.

== Notes ==
[[File:The Swift, the Fierce, and the Stout helmet.jpg|thumb|The viking helmet on the player's head.]]
Pick up [[Eric, the Utility Dwarf]] and [[Baelog, the Glass Cannon]] before heading out. Accepting the first of these quests put all three of the [[Lost Dwarves]] into the player party (and also puts a viking helmet on the player character's head). Now as minions of the player, all three dwarves have their two abilities listed:
#{{Abilities|Eric's Charge|id=87278|range=25|Eric charges an enemy, inflicting X Physical damage, and stunning it for 3 sec.|cd=15 sec|notes=Instant.|icon=inv_gauntlets_05}}
#{{Abilities|Eric's Pocket Potion|id=87279|Heals all vikings by X over 10 sec.|cd=2 min|notes=Instant.|icon=inv_potion_77}}
#{{abilities|Baelog's Valhalla Shot|id=87281|range=100|Baelog shoots at an enemy, inflicting Physical damage and dealing high threat.|cd=15 sec|notes=Instant.|icon=ability_marksmanship}}
#{{abilities|Baelog's Warcry|id=87280|Increases all vikings' attack speed by 200% for 15 sec.|cd=1 min|notes=Instant.|icon=spell_nature_bloodlust}}
#{{abilities|Olaf's Shield Wall|id=87282|Reduces the Physical and magical damage taken by Olaf by 75% for 10 sec.|cd=30 sec|notes=Instant.|icon=ability_warrior_shieldwall}}
#{{abilities|Olaf's Mighty Shout|id=87283|Taunts the target to attack Olaf, but has no effect if the target is already attacking Olaf.|cd=15 sec|notes=Instant|icon=spell_nature_reincarnation}}
Merely getting within range of a target is all that necessary for the vikings to attack. Head out and use all of the vikings' abilities to complete the quests.
