==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Gek Nozzlerocket}} at [[Light's Hope Chapel]] in the [[Eastern Plaguelands]].

==Description==
By order of his royal highness, [[Anduin Wrynn|King Anduin Wrynn]], all able-bodied citizens of the [[Alliance]] are to report to Gek Nozzlerocket at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.

Your help is needed to survey the damage done by [[Deathwing]], and the disposition of [[Horde]] forces in the [[Badlands]].

Gek has agreed to provide transportation to the Badlands via rocket, in exchange for your help. Look for him at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands. 

For the glory and honor of the Alliance!

==Completion==
You must be here to help Fuselight! Let's get you to the Badlands right away. 

==Notes==
Note that, even though the quest has "Badlands" in the title, head to Light's Hope in Eastern Plaguelands. There is no easy way to access Badlands on foot for at-level players without any flight paths. However, there is easy access thanks to the next quest in the plaguelands.
