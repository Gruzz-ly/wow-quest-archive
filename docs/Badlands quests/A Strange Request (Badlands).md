== Objectives ==
Bring Dolph's Package to {{NPC||Rhea}} at [[Lethlor Ravine]] in the [[Badlands]].
*[[Dolph's Package]] (provided)

== Description ==
On to other matters. I have a package that I need delivered.

A young lady came by [[Fuselight|our town]] not long ago, looking for compressed blasting powder, a tempered mithril bomb casing, and some safety goggles. Naturally, we had plenty of blasting powder and bomb casings to sell her, but the safety goggles were a little harder to find.

Long story short, I've got the goggles, but she's already returned to her studies down in Lethlor Ravine. Will you bring these down to her?

== Progress ==
Ahh... you've found me. Good.

== Completion ==
Thank you, <race>. You may keep the goggles, as they have already served the purpose: they brought you to me.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Parcel Bearer's Breastplate|Boots of Delivery|Lethlor Armbands|Alluring Leggings}}

{{itembox|You will also receive: {{cost||30}}|Safety Goggles}}

== Notes ==
Rhea, at [[Rhea's Camp]], can be found at the southern end of Lethlor Ravine. Mind the black drakes, they bite!
