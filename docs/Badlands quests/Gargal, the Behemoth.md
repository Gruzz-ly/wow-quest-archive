Use Gargal's Shield Wall and Gargal's Mighty Shout.
*Use Gargal's Shield Wall
*Use Gargal's Mighty Shout

==Description==
You may not have noticed, but I'm pretty big, as far as orcs go.

I make sure that my two pals here don't get into too much trouble. They're small, and they don't have a big shield like me. I'm big, and I can handle a few monsters hitting me! Plus, if I'm careful, I can usually get them to hit my shield instead!

I can protect you, too. Come on, let's go practice for a bit. I'll make sure the enemies attack me, and not you.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|0}} (+{{coppercost|1800}} at max level)

==Progress==
Don't worry, little <race>. I'll protect you.

==Completion==
See? No need to worry when Gargal is around. Just let me know, and I'll protect you from the monsters.

==Notes==

Pick up [[Amakkar, Jack of All Trades]] and [[Jurrix the Striker]] before heading out. Accepting the first of these quests put all three of the [[Bad Dogs]] into the player's party. Now as minions of the player, all three mercenaries have their two abilities listed:
#{{Abilities|Amakkar's Kidney Shot|id=87608|range=25|Amakkar charges an enemy, inflicting X Physical damage, and stunning it for 3 sec.|cd=15 sec|notes=Instant.|icon=inv_gauntlets_05}}
#{{Abilities|Amakkar's Pocket Potion|id=87609|Heals all mercenaries by X over 10 sec.|cd=2 min|notes=Instant.|icon=inv_potion_77}}
#{{Abilities|Jurrix's Fiery Blast|id=87612|range=100|Jurrix shoots a fireball at an enemy, inflicting Fire damage and causing high threat.|cd=15 sec|notes=instant|icon=spell_fire_fireball02}}
#{{Abilities|Jurrix's Time Warp|id=87611|Increases all mercenaries' attack speed by 200% for 15 sec.|cd=1 min|notes=Instant|icon=ability_mage_timewarp}}
#{{Abilities|Gargal's Shield Wall|id=87613|Reduces the Physical and magical damage taken by Gargal by 75% for 10 sec.|cd=30 sec|notes=Instant|icon=ability_warrior_shieldwall}}
#{{Abilities|Gargal's Mighty Shout|id=87614|Taunts the target to attack Gargal, but has no effect if the target is already attacking Gargal.|cd=15 sec|notes=Instant|icon=spell_nature_reincarnation}}
If the player mounts up, the Bad Dogs will mount up on [[Mechano-Hog]]s. Merely getting within range of a target is all that necessary for the mercenaries to attack. Head out and use all of the mercenaries' abilities to complete the quests.
