==Objectives==
Slay 12 Dustbelcher Combatants. You may kill [[Dustbelcher Mauler]]s or [[Dustbelcher Shaman]].
*Dustbelcher combatant slain (12)

==Description==
My grunts have got this dragon problem under control. Besides, I can't have an upstart <class> like you barging in and ruining our battle plans.

You want work? Fine, I'll give you work. Investigate the ogre camp to our southwest. From what I've heard, a small army of combatants seems to have appeared outside of their hovel.

We can't sit and wait for them to flank us, soldier... especially while we're already embroiled with black dragons. Thin their ranks before they thin ours.

==Progress==
Well? What are you waiting for?

==Completion==
You've got the hint of a hero in you, <race>.

Now get out of my battlefield.
