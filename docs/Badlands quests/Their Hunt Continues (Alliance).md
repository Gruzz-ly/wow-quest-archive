==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Rhea.jpg|Rheastrasza|Moldarr and Jirakka lead the core of the black flight's forces.}}
Defeat General Jirakka , Moldarr, and 6 Blackflight dragonspawn.
*[[General Jirakka]] slain
*[[Moldarr]] slain
*Darkflight [[Darkflight Shadowspeaker|dragonspawn]] slain x6

==Description==
The [[black dragonflight]] means business. It appears they've taken over a large portion of [[New Kargath]], the large [[Horde]] settlement north of [[Dragon's Mouth]]. Their troops are under the command of General Jirakka and his champion, Moldarr. They must be stopped.

We [[dragon]]s do not take part in the squabbles between Horde and [[Alliance]], but I do understand the risk you take in entering New Kargath. Please, heroes... be careful.
==Completion==
Two more dangerous black dragons have been removed from this egg hunt. Your greatest task, however, still awaits.

==Notes==
Valid dragonspawn units include [[Darkflight Shadowspeaker]]s and [[Darkflight Flameblade]]s. [[New Kargath Grunt]]s are fending off the dragonspawn, but they are hostile too. They won't flag PvP, though... Head up the hill. Moldarr is inside the orcish forge building halfway up. A level 47 elite with 15,920 health... use the same tactics used for Kalaran. Keep heading up the hill and enter the tower on top. Jirakka is also a 47 elite dragonspawn with 15,920 health. The quest completes automatically on the general's death.
