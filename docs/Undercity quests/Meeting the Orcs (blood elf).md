This quest is part of the '''Hero of the Sin'dorei''' quest chain. This quest chain starts with [[Hero of the Sin'dorei]].

== Objectives ==
Lady Sylvanas Windrunner wants you to take the [[Letter Sealed by Sylvanas]] to [[High Overlord Saurfang]] in [[Orgrimmar]], capital of [[Durotar]].
*[[Letter Sealed by Sylvanas]] (Provided)

== Description ==
I haven't lost any love for my homeland or its people, as you know. I've fought tooth and nail for Silvermoon to be allowed a place beside Undercity and Orgrimmar at the negotiating table.

This should silence any opposition. Take this letter to Saurfang in Orgrimmar. As leader of the orcs he must have a say in accepting the sin'dorei's pledge.

I've added my own seal to the letter as a personal endorsement. Go northwest of the city and board the zeppelin bound for Durotar at the tower.

== Rewards ==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*1,650 [[XP]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Progress ==
You have traveled far to meet with me, blood elf. What brings you to Orgrimmar?

== Completion ==
<Saurfang begins to read the letter.>

Sylvanas, she is persistent.  Even going so far as to send a champion of Silvermoon... how will this be changing anything?
