==Objectives==
Bring Misprinted Draenic Coins to [[Estelle Gendry]] in [[Undercity]]. Misprinted Draenic Coins can be found when completing your first Random Heroic Draenor dungeon each day.
* [[Misprinted Draenic Coin]] (50)

==Description==
A most intriguing theory has been put forth by an associate of mine that may explain what's wrong with these coins. We believe they might be demonic in origin. See? This one's got three eyes. And this one always comes up tails. And THIS one whispers to me at night - on now, don't be jealous sweetheart. You're still my favorite.

...Provided you bring me more coins so I can confirm our theory. Run along!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:|Timeworn Heirloom Scabbard}}

==Progress==
You've done a most wonderful service for me. I won't forget you, sweetheart. At least not this week.

==Completion==
I am most gracious for your services. So many coins! Such a foul energy within them - do you feel it? Somebody was trying to corrupt the draenei from within.

Well, don't you worry your pretty head any. My colleagues and I will take VERY good care of these. Thank you, lovely!
