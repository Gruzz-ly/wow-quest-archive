==Completion==
It might have been a silly thing to do, but [[Thule Ravenclaw|Thule]], [[Gunther Arcanus|Gunthar]]{{sic}} and I were like family... brothers. We never expected our world to be torn apart, nor for Thule to side with the [[Lich King]] leaving Gunthar and myself to fight for our humanity...

I can sense the taint of the [[scourge]] seeping into Thule's portion of the wand. It will forever be marred, corrupted by his betrayal, but alas I am not ready to let go... maybe with time.

Please accept this token of knowledge as my final thanks.

==Rewards==
You will learn:
*Enchant Gloves - [[Living Bomb (mage rune)]]
