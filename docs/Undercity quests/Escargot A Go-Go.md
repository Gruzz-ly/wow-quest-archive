'''Escargot A Go-Go''' is a [[daily cooking quests|daily cooking quest]] available from [[Eunice Burch]] in the [[Trade Quarter]] in [[Undercity]].

==Objectives==
Collect 8 Brightwater Snails. Deliver them to [[Eunice Burch]] in [[Undercity]].

* [[Brightwater Snail (item)]] (5)

==Description==
The [[Kor'kron Overseer (Undercity)|orc guards]] are always grumbling about bland and moldering Undercity fare - as if it's OUR fault they can't get by on a diet of mushrooms and old corpses - so I think it's time they learn just the sort of exotic delights we can cook up when we've a mind to.

Gather some of the freshwater snails ambling about beneath [[Brightwater Lake]] and I'll show them what a true culinary master can create.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|16|54|}} (at level 85)
* +2 [[Cooking]] Skill
* [[Epicurean's Award]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Gather those freshwater snails, yet?

==Completion==
You must be quite the swimmer... all I can manage is the dead man's float.

In any case, excellent batch of snails you've gathered. Thank you.

==Patch changes==
