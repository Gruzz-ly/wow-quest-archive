'''Would You Like Some Flies With That?''' is a [[Daily cooking quests|daily cooking quest]] available from [[Eunice Burch]] in the [[Trade Quarter]] in [[Undercity]].

==Objectives==
Obtain 25 Bloated Flies from the "meat" near the Meat Wagons. Then return to [[Eunice Burch]] in [[Undercity]].
* [[Bloated Fly]] (25)

==Description==
It's not always about making food for the orcs, <class>. This time, it's about making food for what will hopefully be their replacements.

We need to start small, we need to catch flies. Flies love rotting meat, and we love rotting meat... as projectile weapons!

Check out the Meat Wagons for any extra bits of meat. Where you find the meat, you'll find the flies.

Bring me 25 bloated flies, and then I can start on the next stage of our cooking plan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|16|54|}} (at level 85)
* +1 [[Cooking]] Skill
* [[Epicurean's Award]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
I bet some of that "meat" is still good.

==Completion==
Ah!  Perfect!  Fat, slow and ready to be eaten!  Next up, we will feed them to our spiders.  Fatten them up, and then, we feed the spiders to the frogs...

Listen to me go on.  You don't need to know all the details.  This is just a small step in a grand cuisine in a grand scheme.
