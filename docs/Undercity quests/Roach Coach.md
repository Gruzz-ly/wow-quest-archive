'''Roach Coach''' is a [[Daily cooking quests|daily cooking quest]] available from [[Eunice Burch]] in the [[Trade Quarter]] in [[Undercity]].

==Objectives==
Obtain 20 Plump Cockroaches. Deliver the insects to [[Chef Audrey]] in [[Undercity]].
* [[Plump Cockroaches]] (20)

==Description==
For all the grousing those [[Kor'kron Overseer (Undercity)|Kor'kron Overseer]]s do about Undercity food, there's ONE thing they'll eat in spades: My sister Audrey's Thrice-Spiced Crunchy Stew.

Its popularity means she's always running low on ingredients. Could you gather some for her at the coach she sells them from?

You'll find traps all over the city; just take their contents to Audrey and she'll handle the rest! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|16|54|}} (at level 85)
* +1 [[Cooking]] Skill
* 2x [[Epicurean's Award]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
I call my little traps "Cockroach Cabins."

Cockroaches check in, but they don't check out! 

==Completion==
Oh, and just as I was nearly out. Thank you!

==Notes==
