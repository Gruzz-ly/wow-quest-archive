==Objectives==
Dig up a Corpse Worm in the [[Ruins of Lordaeron]] courtyard and use it as bait to catch a Corpse-Fed Pike. Corpse-Fed Pike can be fished up in [[Brightwater Lake]], northeast of [[Undercity]].
*[[Corpse-Fed Pike]]

==Description==
You've fished in Brightwater Lake, yes?

The prize catch there is one of the lake's massive corpse-fed pikes. However, they only bite on a very specific type of bait... corpse worms.

Search the graves in the courtyard up top and you should find some.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Bag of Shiny Things]] and gold which varies by level (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]
*2 skill points in [[Fishing]]

==Progress==
Catch that pike, yet?

==Completion==
That's a fine, fat pike, <name>.  Well done.
