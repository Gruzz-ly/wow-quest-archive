==Progress==
Your progress in the arcane arts has been exemplary, <name>. I think you are ready to author a spellbook of your own.

Let's see... a quill from the [[Owlbeast]]s of the {{C|Hinterlands}}, and ink derived from silithid resin... yes, that will do. And for the pages, the finest Farraki Papyrus!
*[[Pristine Owlbeast Quill]]
*[[Zukk'ash Resin]] (5)
*[[Farraki Papyrus]] (8)

==Rewards==
You will learn:
* Enchant Helm - [[Temporal Anomaly (mage rune)]]

You will also receive:
*3,900 XP
*[[Personal Spellbook]]

==Completion==
Your spellbook is ready, <name>. May you fill its pages with arcane secrets to rival the ancient libraries of [[Elun'dris]] and [[Zuldazar]].

==Patch changes==
