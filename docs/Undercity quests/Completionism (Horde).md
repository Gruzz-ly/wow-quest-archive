==Objectives==
Bring Misprinted Draenic Coins to [[Estelle Gendry]] in [[Undercity]]. Misprinted Draenic Coins can be found when completing your first Random Heroic Draenor dungeon each day.
* [[Misprinted Draenic Coin]] (10)

==Description==
This is intolerable! The coins you brought me do not match the rest of the coins I already have! You aren't counterfeiting these are you? No? Hrumph. In that case I'm sorry we fought, dearie.

There's only one thing to do, buttercup: we need to complete the new set you've discovered. Bring me more misprinted coins!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:|Timeworn Heirloom Armor Casing}}

==Progress==
I certainly hope these coins can complete this set so I can se-- er, so I can treasure them forever.

==Completion==
That wasn't so hard now was it, peaches?

<Estelle holds the coins you brought up the the light and practically purrs.>

Yes yes, these are so very strange...
