==Objectives==
Speak with [[Valxx Cracklequil]] in [[Everlook]] to learn about the rumors.

==Description==
Your discovery of the Essence of Fire has greatly expanded our knowledge of the arcane. I have heard rumors of a similar power in {{C|Winterspring}}, though it is of a Frost nature. My associate in Everlook will have more information regarding the specifics.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*6600 [[XP]]
*{{cost||70}}

==Completion==
So you've been sent by those old bats at the library, huh? They don't like me a whole lot, saying that 'gunpowder and [[magic]] don't mix.' Pah.

Yeah, I know a thing or two about what you're asking about. Lucky for you I'm too busy to look into it myself.
