==Objectives==
Armand Cromwell in [[Undercity]] wants you to bring him 8 Giant Flesh-Eating Tadpoles.
*[[Giant Flesh-Eating Tadpole]] (8)

==Description==
Some of our apothecaries took to dumping their more volatile waste chemicals into [[Stillwater Pond]] and... well, let's just say that no one wants to know how big mutant flesh-eating toads can grow.

Would you consider fishing up some giant flesh-eating tadpoles before it gets to that? Just don't try to handle them with your bare hands.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Bag of Shiny Things]] and gold which varies by level (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]
*1 skill point in [[Fishing]]

==Progress==
Catch any mutant tadpoles? Don't try to handle them with your bare hands.

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. I'll see that these are, ah, disposed of immediately.

After all, what would our fine apothecaries want with an army of monstrous, poison-spitting, flesh-eating super-toads?
