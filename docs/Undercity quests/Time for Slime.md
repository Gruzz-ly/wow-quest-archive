==Objectives==
Collect 10 Squirming Slime Molds. Deliver them to [[Armand Cromwell]] in [[Undercity]].
*[[Squirming Slime Mold]] (10)

==Description==
It takes a special sort of fisherman to reap the bounty of Undercity's burbling slime troughs. Think you can handle gathering some of the squirming, sentient slime mold slithering about down there?

You can try to fish them up, but they're wily; you might be better off just diving into the ooze and grabbing them.

Remember, they're only useful alive and intact... who'd want to eat a dead slime mold?! Disgusting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Bag of Shiny Things]] and gold which varies by level (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]
*1 skill point in [[Fishing]]

==Progress==
Difficult to catch, aren't they?

==Completion==
These slimes look perfect.  I will send these along to Eunice for preparation, thank you.

==Notes==
The Squirming Slime Molds can be seen and collected with more ease by turning on the friendly unit nameplates in the interface options.

==Patch changes==
