* [[Misprinted Draenic Coin]] (5)

==Description==
I told him this was a fool's errand. Of course he would get himself killed over a handful of coins! Oh well, there are always new lovers to find.

You'll have to do in the mean time. And you are quite easy on the eyes, aren't you? Be a dear and find me more coins that look like this one? I need them for... research.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:|Ancient Heirloom Armor Casing}}

==Progress==
Well? Do you have the coins I asked you to find?

==Completion==
Excellent work. I knew you'd be useful, sugarplum.

There's something very unusual about these coins...

==Progression==
