==Objectives==
Travel to the Echo Isles and use the offering at Bwonsamdi's shrine.
*[[Voodoo Offering]]

==Description==
Take the offering south, to the Echo Isles. Along the island beaches you will find a shrine to Bwonsamdi, the loa of death. An offering from a Forsaken will no doubt attract his attention.

I warn you though, <name>. There's always a price to pay when bargaining with the loa. You may not be aware of what you give up now, but Bwonsamdi always collects his debts in the end.

==Progress==
The air around you seems to thicken as you place your offering on the pile.

==Completion==
Your offering bursts into purple flame as a shadow falls across the ground. You see no one, but feel the presence of the loa of death leering behind you.

Images fill your mind. A wall of masks, stretching beyond sight and laughing down at you. A temple in a great swamp, filled with souls of the dead.

As the vision clears, a laugh echoes in the air...

==Notes==
Completing this quest allows undead priests to [[Meditation (Season of Discovery)|meditate]] at Loa Altars.
