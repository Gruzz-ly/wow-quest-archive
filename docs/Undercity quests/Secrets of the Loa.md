==Objectives==
Collect 14 Hillsbrad Human Bones from humans in Hillsbrad Foothills, then return to Baj'ura in Undercity.
*[[Hillsbrad Human Bones]] (12)

==Description==
The mighty troll empires of our ancestors were built on the strength of the loa - spirits of great power who rule across Azeroth. We worship many loa in the Darkspear tribe, but if you are interested in sharing our faith, there is one in particular who may be willing to bargain with you.

First, you will need to prepare an offering. Travel to Tarren Mill and strike back at the humans who challenge the Horde's claim to the area. Collect the bones of your victims and return to me.

==Progress==
How fares the battle against the humans?

==Completion==
Excellent... these remains will make a fine offering.
