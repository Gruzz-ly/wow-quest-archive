==Objectives==
Armand Cromwell wants you to fish up a Severed Abomination Head in [[Undercity]] for [[Master Apothecary Faranell]].
*[[Severed Abomination Head]]

==Description==
There was an... incident... with an [[orc]] guard and one of Master Apothecary Faranell's [[abomination]]s.

Apparently, the Kor'kron Overseer chopped its head clean off and kicked it into the slime.

Faranell's apprentices searched for hours but they can't find the thing. Care to try fishing it up? I'm sure the old fellow'd be grateful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Bag of Shiny Things]] and gold which varies by level (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]
*1 skill point in [[Fishing]]

==Progress==
You haven't by any chance come across a severed abomination head, have you...?

==Completion==
Ah! THERE it is! How ever did you find it?

Well, no matter. My apprentices weren't able to recover the head despite hours splashing about in the slime, though they DID recover this bag of shiny things... perhaps you've a use for what's inside?

My thanks.
