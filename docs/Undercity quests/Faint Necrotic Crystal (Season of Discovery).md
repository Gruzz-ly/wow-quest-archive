==Objectives==
Bring the Faint Necrotic Crystal to [[Lieutenant Rukag]] in the courtyard of the [[Undercity]].
*[[Faint Necrotic Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
On the corpse of the fallen [[wight]], you find a crystal that is faintly radiating necrotic energy.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Blessed Wizard Oil]]
*[[Consecrated Sharpening Stone]]
*[[Weighted Consecrated Sharpening Stone]]

==Progress==
Can I help you with something?

==Completion==
You say this was taken from a wight attacking the city?

We have received word about the [[necropolis]] base camps that are being summoned by the [[Scourge]]. I suspect they were trying to create one in the Undercity. We will have to be vigilant in the future.
