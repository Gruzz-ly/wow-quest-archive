==Objectives==
Bring Misprinted Draenic Coins to [[Estelle Gendry]] in [[Undercity]]. Misprinted Draenic Coins can be found when completing your first Random Heroic Draenor dungeon each day.
* [[Misprinted Draenic Coin]] (25)

==Description==
Well sweet pea, I have good news and bad news for you. The good news is that you brought me enough coins to complete this new misprint set! The bad news is that not a single one of them has matched the original partial set.

See here - this coin has two heads. And the face on the reverse is grinning at me, where he was looking so dour only an hour ago. This one squints when I shine a light on it. Such a mystery! I must have more!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:|Ancient Heirloom Scabbard}}

==Progress==
Has anyone told you today that you're beautiful? You are.

==Completion==
Honeybiscuit, when this is all over, you and I may be remembered as stumbling on a great paranormal discovery. Or I will at least.

==Progression==
