==Objectives==
Meditate on undeath, then pray with the kneeling troll to share your meditations.
*Pray over the [[Supplicant]]

==Description==
This Troll is reflecting on death, but lacks a certain... familiarity with the topic. Please help to clarify his understanding.

==Progress==
Yes, <name>?

==Completion==
In my experience, our people are at best a curiosity to the rest of the Horde. Still, sharing our knowledge is a simple way to gain their trust. Keep that in mind along your travels.
