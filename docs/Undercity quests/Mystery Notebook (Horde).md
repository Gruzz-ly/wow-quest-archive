==Objectives==
Return the notebook to Estelle Gendry in the Undercity.

==Description==
This book has seen better days. Not much can be made out between the waterlogging and the apparent animal bites, but a few poor attempts at poetry center around the "radiant glow" of the Undercity and someone named Estelle Gendry.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|15|40|}}

==Completion==
<Estelle pages through the damaged tome and sighs wistfully.>

Oh dear, another paramour dead! Draenor has a terrible habit of eating my lovers alive.
