This quest is part of the '''Hero of the Sin'dorei''' quest chain.  This quest chain starts with [[Hero of the Sin'dorei]].

==Objectives==
Bring the Letter from [[Lor'themar Theron]] to [[Lady Sylvanas Windrunner]] in [[Undercity]], the [[Forsaken]] capital in [[Tirisfal Glades]].
*[[Letter from Lor'themar Theron]] (provided)

==Description==
There were doubts about our capabilities among our potential new allies. Of what use could we be to them when perceived as unable to deal with our problems at home?

This changes everything. No longer will our power be questioned. We'll be able to join the [[Horde]] as equals.

Take this letter to Sylvanas, ruler of the Forsaken. She's already on our side but the news of Dar'Khan's death will be music to her ears. Prepare for a long trip, <name>. If all goes well she will send you to [[Orgrimmar]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*825 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|10}} at level 70)
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Ah, a visitor from Quel'Thalas! What news do you bring?

==Completion==
It is done then. The foul traitor got what he deserved.

You did this yourself? An impressive feat that proves that your race remains worthy, <name>.

I see that Lor'themar has additional news that will greatly improve his relations with the trolls and their Warchief.
