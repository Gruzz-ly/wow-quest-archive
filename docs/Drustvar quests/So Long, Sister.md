We have given the defenders some breathing room, but these creatures continue to lay siege to the barricade!

The witch behind the attack fled from the field when we defeated her forces. I saw her go into the mansion on the hill. I will help keep the defenses going here.

You must go into the mansion and slay the witch!

We wouldn't have been able to hold out much longer. You saved us all.

Head to the lighthouse up the hill.
