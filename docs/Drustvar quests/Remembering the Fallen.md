==Objectives==
Collect 8 Personal Keepsakes from fallen [[Corlain Villager]]s in [[Corlain]].
* [[Personal Keepsake]] (provided) (8)

==Description==
<This villager died clutching a brooch with what looks like a family crest. It looks like several villagers didn't survive the coven's occupation of Corlain.

It might be possible to identify the fallen by the keepsakes they carried. The survivors would likely be grateful to learn the fate of their loved ones.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
What's this?

==Completion==
I don't know what to say. That you would risk your life to bring these items to me speaks greatly of your character, mainlander.

I will make sure these keepsakes make it to the friends and families of the fallen, as well as news of their fate. On their behalf, I thank you for your compassion.
