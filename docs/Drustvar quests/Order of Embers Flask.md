==Description==
{{Book|Order of Embers Flask
|content=
<It took some work to get the cap off, but the corrosive scent of flammable liquids are still present when the lid of this flask is opened. The flask was reinforced to withstand the test of time and thus far it has won. Flasks such as these were used by [the sic] [[Order of Embers]] members to securely carry a supply of potent, flammable liquid which could be put into more easily breakable containers or poured liberally over objects. This particular flask has been etched with the likeness of a diving falcon, torches carried in its talons.>
