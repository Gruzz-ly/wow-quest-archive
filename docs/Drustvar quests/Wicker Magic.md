==Objectives==
Speak with [[Toska Eaglehorn]].

==Description==
It seems that the [[druid]]s at [[Swiftwind Post]] have learned much from the ancient [[Drust]] rituals you recovered.

The druids are now able to offer improved services at the outpost.

Make your way to Swiftwind Post in [[Drustvar]] and see what they have to offer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We've learned much from the Drust's unique form of [[nature]] [[magic]]. We now have some special boons to offer you, <name>.

These blessings of nature are yours whenever you visit.

==Progression==
