* [[Watchful Raven]] slain (4)
* [[Darkmaw Prowler]] slain (6)

==Description==
The sooner I can return the [[Lucille Waycrest|lady Waycrest]] to [[Highroad Gate]] the better, but I will honor her wishes if we can assure her safety.

There are dark things happening in these lands that you don't fully understand. If we must dally, then there are measures that need be taken.

First, the wildlife here can serve as eyes to dark powers. Kill them.

The foes of this land must not find us here in the open.

Pick up [[In Case of Ambush]] before heading out.
