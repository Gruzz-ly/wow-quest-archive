==Objectives==
Kill 8 Enraged Spirits.
* [[Enraged Spirit]] slain (8)

==Description==
There is one thing you should know about [[ghost]]s, <name>.

They are a mockery of the dead. Spirits, holding on although they have no hope. In that form, they shall never truly live again. Not as long as they keep haunting [[Azeroth|our world]].

But if they return to their bodies, perhaps they will become of specific use to us someday down the line.

Put those spirits down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
I live in undeath, <name>. And my life is more fulfilling because of it.

==Completion==
Perhaps we shall have use for these people one day.

Surely they will be thankful.

==Progression==
{{The Marshal's Grave}}
