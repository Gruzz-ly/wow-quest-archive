==Objectives==
Find the secret passageway in the [[Forgotten Lodge]].
* Secret Passage found

==Description==
I'm sure you're wondering why I've brought you here. 

Located somewhere inside this cottage is a hidden door. If we can find a way to access it, the answer to your questions, and possibly our survival against the coven, should lie beyond.

Help me search for it, <class>.

==Rewards==

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The opening must be here somewhere...

==Completion==
You found it! I knew that they were more than stories!

Come, let us see what's inside.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|I can't believe we're here! My father used to tell me stories about this place.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|It contains an ancient secret of our house, from back when the Waycrests first settled this land.}}
: ''Lucille walks over to the small bookshelf and starts searching through it.''
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|We just need to find the entrance!}}

A number of objects in the room light up:
*[[Wall Sconce]]
*:<Upon closer inspection, the torch appears connected to some sort of mechanism built into the wall.>
*:{{gossip|<Pull on the torch>}}
*[[Suspiciously Protruding Book]]
*:<Surprisingly enough, the protruding book is not a secret lever for the hidden entrance.>
*[[Weathered Rug]]
*:<You find no hidden entrances beneath the rug{{sic}}
*:It really does tie the room together, though.>
*[[Anchor]]
*:<The anchor is securely fastened to the wall.>
*[[Pair of Boots]]
*:<It's a pair of old boots.
*:What did you expect?>

Pull on the torch:
: ''Two muffled clicks signal the hidden mechanism unlocking.''
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|That's it! The way is opening!}}
: ''The bookshelf slides over to the right, revealing an open doorway as Lucille walks over to it.''
