==Objectives==
Examine 4 Grave Plaques in [[Barrowknoll Cemetery]].
*[[Grave Plaque]]s read (4)

==Description==
Without [[Captain Amalia Stone|Stone]]'s knowledge, this mission shall require some extra legwork.

Read the plaques in the cemetery. Find the corpse of the most import.

The rest should be quite simple.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
Do not come back until you return with a body... or at the very least a name.

==Completion==
[[Marshal M. Valentine]]... yes, that name rings a bell. In a locked crypt, you say?

There are ways around that.

==Progression==
{{The Marshal's Grave}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
