==Objectives==
Assist in the ceremony by the statue in [[Arom's Stand]].
* Speak to [[Lucille Waycrest|Lucille]] to begin ceremony {{co|36.1|51.2|Drustvar}}
* Present Regalia
* [[Marshal's Regalia]] (provided)

==Description==
My people have suffered loss and pain, struggling in the darkness that covered [[Drustvar]]. But now we have some light back. We have the means and the will to reclaim our lands from the lingering evils. Your help has brought much of that about.

I will miss my parents. Though their end was dark, they were family. But my duty as the head of [[House Waycrest]] is clear. The dead can handle themselves. I must attend to the living and lead.

There is a short ceremony I need to conduct. Would you assist me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Thank you.

==Completion==
I must continue to set my House in order, but our relations with the rest of Kul Tiras have suffered neglect for too long. I have some additional things to handle here first, but I will go to [[Boralus]] soon to set the rest right.

My deepest thanks for all you have done, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|I will meet you by the statue on the hill.}}
: ''She heads out of the building. Out in front of Arom's statue, the rest of the Order stands before her.''

Speak with Lucille:
:Though these days have been marked by loss, we continue onward.

:{{gossip|I am ready to assist you.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|We have all felt the sting of loss, but the fires of hope burn bright.}}
: ''[[Joan Cleardawn]] walks forward and kneels before Lucille.''
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Inquisitor Cleardawn, you exceeded our expectations, displaying compassion, bravery, leadership, and cunning.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|But Drustvar has greater need of your services in a larger capacity.}}

;Present Marshal's Regalia
: ''Standing, Cleardawn changes into the Marshal's armor and salutes you before turning back to Lucille.''
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|I name you Marshal Cleardawn and appoint you the head of the [[Waycrest Guard|Waycrest guard]].}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Everit trained you well. I know he would be proud of you.}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Joan Cleardawn|Thank you, my lady. I won't let you down.}}
