==Objectives==
Find Master Ashton.
* [[Master Ashton]] found {{co|25.6|67.8|Drustvar}}
* Speak to Master Ashton {{co|25.3|67.9|Drustvar}}

==Description==
Master Ashton had me grab some healing supplies and run to [[Leandro Royston|Mayor Royston]] when those things attacked town. He didn't make it behind the barricade.

But if he's alive, and he's just crazy enough he might be, he's probably holed up in his cottage. With caustic compounds. And explosives.

Look, why don't you go check out his basement and I'll stay out of the blast radi- I mean I'll go see if the garden can be salvaged.

Try not to look flammable.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|8|22|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Oh! You're not one of those monsters at all. Did you trounce those brutes?

==Completion==
I appreciate your help in liberating the town! I was becoming quite concerned by these strange monsters.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|The attack on Falconhurst was fierce. I hope Master Ashton is still alive.}}
:{{text|say|Marten Webb|If anyone could survive, it's him. I'm going to check the lab's gardens, Inquisitor.}}

Head to the basement of one of the buildings:
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|Stand Back! I have alchemy and I know how to use it!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|At ease, Master Ashton! We're friendly!}}
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|Well don't you both look dangerous. Is the attack over, then?}}

Speak with him:
:Dark times have come to Drustvar, but we shall win our land back!
{{gossip|Master Ashton, we need your help.}}
:Of course! I'm not certain why you would need my help but for the saviors of my home you shall have it!
:You might have to wait a little bit, however. I am sure the town is in shambles.
