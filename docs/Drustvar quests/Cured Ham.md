==Objectives==
Toss the Pig Fetish into the campfire.
* Pig Effigy burned
*[[Pig Fetish]] (provided)

==Description==
That foul thing has to be what's keeping my men transformed into pigs.

Hmm. Well there isn't too much that can withstand a good cleansing fire! I say we burn it!

Toss it into the campfire!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Into the flames with that foul thing!

==Completion==
You did it! The spell is broken and my men are back to normal!

Well... mostly. They're alive at least.

Now we can get back to normal around here. If you see [[Elijah Eggleton|Elijah]] in [[Fallhaven]], tell him he'll get his sausages soon.
