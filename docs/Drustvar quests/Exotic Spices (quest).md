==Progress==
Oh, hello! Did you have something for me?

==Completion==
Oh wow! I've never seen a mix of spices like that before.

The [[Merchant|traders]] of the [[Great Sea]] make their own exotic spice mixes, each one is unique. I'll happily take them off of your hands if you find any more!

This one smells great! I can't wait to try it on... fish? No, carrots maybe? Hmm...
