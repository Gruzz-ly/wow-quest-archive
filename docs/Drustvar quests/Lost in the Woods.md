Find [[Amalie Oakseeker]].
*[[Lichenlord Ripp|Amalie Oakseeker]] saved

==Description==
My student, Amalie, and I have taken it upon ourselves to act as the keepers of these woods. We were away from [[Drustvar]] briefly, and upon our return, found the grove infested and the surrounding land corrupted.

Amalie decided that she could deal with the grove infestation alone.

It's been some time since she ran off, could you look for her while you're in the [[Ashenwood]]?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,550 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

;Objective
Find Apprentice Knollden.
*Fungalmancer Ripp

;Description
My apprentice rushed off immediately upon seeing the infestation in the grove. No doubt that she believes she's strong enough to handle those fungi on her own. Which leaves me alone to clean up this mess. It's been some time since she ran off, could you look for her while you're in the Ashenwood?
