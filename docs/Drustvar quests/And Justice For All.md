==Objectives==
Leave [[Hangman's Point]] with [[Lucille Waycrest]].
* Lucille untied
* Defeat the Heartsbane ambush

==Description==
Thank you for helping to redeem me in the eyes of my people, <class>. I am in your debt, and I will be sure to let my father know.

In the mean time, I think we should find out what this [[Heartsbane Coven]] is, and what they are doing in our lands. I hope the marshal will be able to enlighten us.

First thing's first, though. Care to undo these ropes? They're starting to chafe.

* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Shall we?

==Completion==
This situation is much worse than I had thought. The coven has taken [[House Waycrest]]?! This will not stand!

Wait... you mentioned that they were drawing their power from an ancient ruin?

I think I might have an idea.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|That's better. Now, let's--}}
:{{text|yell|Marshal Everit Reade|Look out! Enemies from the woods!}}
:{{text|yell|Lucille Waycrest|It's an ambush! Defend the villagers!}}

Second wave:
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|The traps aren't slowing them down anymore. More incoming!}}

Third wave:
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|What in creation is that?}}
:{{text|yell|Sister Widdowson|The Mother will have you, Lucille Waycrest!}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|We'll protect the lady, mainlander. Take out their leader!}}

Ignore the trash and focus on Widdowson. At 50%:
:{{text|yell|Sister Widdowson|You are fools to resist. The Heartsbane will claim Kul Tiras!}}

Death:
:{{text|say|Sister Widdowson|The Mother... will take you...}}
:{{text|yell|Lucille Waycrest|Marshal! What do you know of this coven? Tell me what is happening to our land!}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|It's worse than you know, my lady. This coven has spread like wildfire throughout Drustvar.}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|They've overrun much of the land past the mountains. We've only a handful left holding [[Arom's Stand]].}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|And my father? What is he doing to combat this incursion?}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|They... they have him, my lady. We were working on a way to extract him when we heard word of this... trial.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Well then, it looks like we're going to have to take the fight to the coven. I think I know how to do just that.}}
