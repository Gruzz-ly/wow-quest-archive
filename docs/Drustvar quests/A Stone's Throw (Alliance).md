==Objectives==
Use the Bag of Transmutation Stones on witches and kill them. Collect 8 Vials of Altered Blood from them.
* [[Vial of Altered Blood]] (8)
* [[Hexwood Binder]] slain (100)
* [[Hexwood Seer]] slain (100)
* [[Bag of Transmutation Stones]] (provided)

==Description==
You may enjoy getting this next reagent for me. I have some special stones that have transmutative qualities, especially on living things. It's not too unlike the one you're trying to make.

The [[witch]]es that plague [[Drustvar|these lands]] are imbued with [[magic]]. As is their blood.

I need their blood to finish my latest project, but in an altered form. These stones should turn them into weaker creatures. Although, sometimes the opposite occurs...

I'd recommend handling them with care.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You never truly know what a transmutation will yield until you try it. Wouldn't you agree, apprentice?

==Completion==
How did you find the stones? Fun, aren't they?

Oh, and this is plenty of blood. Well done.

==Progression==
