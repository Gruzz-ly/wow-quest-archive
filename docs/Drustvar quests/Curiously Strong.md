==Objectives==
Use the Frost Breath Potion to put out the fires.
* Fires extinguished (20)
*[[Frost Potion]] (provided)

==Description==
I imagine the fires spread while I was down here, yes? First order of business then; making sure the town doesn't burn down! Help solve that problem and I shall be free to assist you in... whatever it is?

Let's see... Yes! Here! Take these. They proved to be bit too... intense for most people, but you seem like a stout sort.

Just be sure you're facing the fires when you use them, and I'm certain those fires will be out in no time!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
If we don't stop the fires, they could spread!

==Completion==
Ah wonderful! The fires are out and your breath smells minty fresh!

==Notes==

:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|The town is in good hands, so would you kindly explain what is going on?}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|Master Ashton, we have been sent by Lady Lucille Waycrest to find you.}}
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|So I gathered... but why me?}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|Lady Lucille has reforged the Order of Embers. Using ancient texts as our guide, we will fight these witches as we once battled the Drust.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|She found an alchemical recipe that was effective in the past. She requests that you attempt to recreate the formula.}}
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|Lady Lucille thinks it might be useful, I assume? Well, let's see it!}}
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|Fascinating! A remarkable formulation! Very flammable!}}
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|Inquisitor, it will be my distinct pleasure to assist you and the Lady Lucille in this task.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|I am very glad to hear that, Master Ashton.}}
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|You put out those fires and I'll set up what we need in the lab. Oh, what fun this shall be!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|<Name> will assist you in whatever you might need, Master. I will go see if I can't help Mayor Royston.}}

Mayor [[Leandro Royston]] offers another quest in town, [[Building Defenses]].

;Description
Good heavens! They set that building on fire! It seems the bucket brigade could use a hand. Let's see... Yes! Here! It was an experiment in breath mints. They proved to be bit too chilly for most people here in town but you seem like a stout sort. Just be sure you're facing the fires when you bite down on them, and I'm certain those fires will be out in no time!
