==Objectives==
Investigate what is disabling the coven's minions in [[Hocking's Plot]].
* Farm investigated {{co|27.1|25.2|Drustvar}}

==Description==
Oh good, maybe you can make sense of this.

I was just carving through a swath of the coven's lackeys when I stumbled across this field. Something here has knocked these guys completely out of commission!

I can't seem to find the source, but maybe you'll have better luck. I'm more used to hitting things than investigating them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Completion==
You don't look like you're in league with the coven, so what are you doin' in Corlain?

==Notes==
;Approach
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Mace|Hellooo? Anyone home?}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Mace|I'll leave you to the mystery, then... while I see about cracking more coven skulls!}}

Just next to mace is the rare [[Gorged Boar]].

Inside the farmhouse:
:{{text|say|Harris Hocking|Wait, how'd you get... hey, you're not one of them, are you?}}

==Progression==
