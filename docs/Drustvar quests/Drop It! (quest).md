==Objectives==
Retrieve [[Chelsea Wright]]'s keys.
* [[Storehouse Key]]

==Description==
You must be the person [[Dorian Atwater|Dorian]] sent to collect the ore.

I got a message a short while ago requesting a rather large shipment, which in itself is a feat given the state of this place. I was on my way to our storehouse when that... beast!... cornered me.

It took my keys. I can't get you that shipment without them. Find out where that mongrel took them and bring them back.

Let it be known I wouldn't do this for anyone else.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<The Wicker Beast stares blankly at you.>

==Completion==
<The Wicker Beast sniffs the key.>

==Notes==
The Wicker Beast stands waiting near the [[Bleak Hills Mine]]. Each time the [[adventurer]] approaches, it runs, leading the way up the path. Mount up with a regular mount, not a druid form, and follow it as it runs away.

Stopping may cause it the respond with one of the following lines:
:{{text|emote|Wicker Beast jangles the keys at you.}}
:{{text|emote|Wicker Beast shakes itself and prances anxiously in place.}}
:{{text|emote|Wicker Beast stares expectantly at you.}}
:{{text|emote|Wicker Beast whines softly.}}
:{{text|emote|Wicker Beast barks at you.}}

Upon reaching the [[Wicker Hovel]]:
:''The Wicker Beast walks into the cave and steps over a ritual circle containing three stuffed animals and the corpse of a dog named Princess. The beast stops at the corpse, turns to the adventurer, and sets down the keys.''
