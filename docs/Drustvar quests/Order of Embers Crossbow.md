{{Book|Order of Embers Crossbow
|content=
<The strings of this crossbow are long gone, the metal bow irons have become brittle and the bowstaves cracked, but there is now denying this was once a powerful tool. Delicate scrollwork in the pattern of crashing waves were etched onto the stock. A kill count of over seventy has been marked onto the foregrip.>
