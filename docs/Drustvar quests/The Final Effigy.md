Destroy the Cursed Effigy in [[Fallhaven]].
* [[Cursed Effigy]] broken

==Description==
<The effigy's protection has been broken.

|Banisher Breeches
|Crone-Seeker's Legguards
|Waycrest Militia Greaves
|Wickerwoven Cuffs
|Banisher Bracers

}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|38|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What's... going on? How long have I been standing here?

A curse!? You're saying the whole village was just... stuck? I knew there was something terribly wrong with that old crone...

It seems that Fallhaven owes you a great debt, stranger.

==Notes==
Interact with the curse and players will get drawn into another phase, and the [[Deathcursed Terror]] attacks:
:{{text|yell|Deathcursed Terror|Fool! You will die screaming!}}

50% health:
:{{text|yell|Deathcursed Terror|All of Kul Tiras will suffer. You are only the first!}}

Death:
:{{text|say|Deathcursed Terror|[[Gorak Tul]]... comes...}}

Defeat the terror and a cutscene plays, showing the villagers all being freed from their curse, starting to move again. The phase changes and the town has standard services, like an inn, mailbox, and flight path now.

Cyril also wakes up:
:{{text|say|Cyril White|What... what is going on?}}

Check in with him.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Cyril White|I must have you to thank... I never thought I would awaken from that accursed state...}}
:{{text|say|Cyril White|Fallhaven is in your debt, stranger. Please tell us how we can repay you.}}
