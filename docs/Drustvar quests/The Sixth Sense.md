==Objectives==
Escort [[Sef Iwen]] to her grave.
* Speak with Sef Iwen
* Follow Sef Iwen to her grave
* Disenchant Grisly Ward to free Sef Iwen
* Continue to Sef Iwen's Grave

==Description==
For my plan to work, we need to break the spell on my body that is anchoring my [[Ghost|spirit]] to this place.

However, my mortal remains are buried deep within this forest. There are wards within it that are designed to trap spirits who are still attached to the material world. Once my remains are cleansed, I will be able to move freely through the woods.

Until then, I'll need you to disenchant the wards we come across.

Speak to me when you are ready, and I will lead you to my grave.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good work!

<Sef looks introspective for a moment.>

I just realized I never told you my plan.

==Notes==
Speak with Sef to start the escort.
:This is no way to exist.
:{{Gossip|<Lead the way.>}}

As you follow Sef, she will converse with you about her past history.
:{{Text|say|Sef Iwen|Come along, friend!}}
:{{Text|say|Sef Iwen|I was buried near one of these trees, the ones with red leaves and white bark. Follow me.}}
:{{Text|say|Sef Iwen|*Sigh* These woods used to be filled with joyous spirits. But now... let me show you what I see...}}
:''Sef casts Ghostly Sight on the adventurer. Trapped souls are seen throughout the woods.''
:{{Text|say|Sef Iwen|Those poor souls, trapped by that ward. You should disenchant it to free them.}}
:{{Text|say|Sef Iwen|I was alive when the mainlanders first landed on our shores. [[Gorak Tul]] was threatened by their presence and ordered raids against their villages. I wanted nothing to do with it. As a [[Thornspeakers|Thornspeaker]], a guardian of the wilds, I knew that we could live in harmony if we tried.}}
:{{Text|say|Sef Iwen |AHH! Please! Disenchant the ward that binds me!}}

Disenchant a nearby [[Grisly Ward]] to free Sef. Note that destroying a ward will summon a hostile [[Trapped Soul (Drustvar)|Trapped Soul]].
:{{Text|say|Sef Iwen|C'mon, let's go!}}
:{{Text|say|Sef Iwen|GAH! Can't! Move! There's a ward nearby! Disenchant it!}}

A Grisy Ward can be found behind the trees next to your location.
:{{Text|say|Sef Iwen|Ready?}}
:{{Text|say|Sef Iwen|It's not this tree. Let's keep moving.}}
:{{Text|say|Sef Iwen|Tul was furious. He decided to make an example of me. "You can fight these invaders or you can hide in the woods forever. Which is it?"}}
:{{Text|say|Sef Iwen|Thinking that he would just banish me, I chose to hide in the woods. Instead... he tore my soul from my body, leaving just enough of a connection that I couldn't stray too far from it.}}
:''Sef pauses for a moment.''
:{{Text|say|Sef Iwen|It's not this one, either.}}
:{{Text|say|Sef Iwen|ERR! Find the ward! Disenchant it!}}

Look behind the nearby fallen tree to find a ward.
:{{Text|say|Sef Iwen|The next century is foggy, as I wandered these woods, alone and afraid. All I remember is him saying that as long as my spirit is bound to my body, I can never know rest.}}
:{{Text|say|Sef Iwen|AHH! Please! Disenchant the ward that binds me!}}

A ward will be behind the tree to the left of Sef.
:{{Text|say|Sef Iwen|Oh! That looks familiar!}}
:''Sef quickens her pace.''
:{{Text|say|Sef Iwen|Sef Iwen|This is it!}}
