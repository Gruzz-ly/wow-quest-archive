==Objectives==
Collect 15 Deathshrooms.
* [[Deathshroom]] (15)

==Description==
The first thing I'd like you to do for me is to gather some deathshroom.

Don't worry if you're not skilled at [[herbalism]], they're very easy to pick. They typically grow where death lingers in the air.

I'd try to the [[Crimson Forest]] to the south. The creatures that have overrun it seem to be covered in deathly [[magic]]s.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you finally acquired my mushrooms?

It's a simple task, even for someone like you.

==Completion==
Oh yes, that's plenty for what I need. Well done, apprentice.

==Progression==
{{A Recipe for Success}}
