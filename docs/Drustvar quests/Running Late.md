==Objectives==
Speak with Lord Arthur Waycrest in [[Whitegrove Chapel]].
* Speak to [[Lord Arthur Waycrest|Lord Waycrest]]
* [[Lord Waycrest's Notes]]

==Description==
I beg your pardon, but I am a little concerned at Lord Waycrest's tardiness.

I'd hate to be a bother, but would you mind checking on him? The ceremony awaits his presence.

You can find him in the bride's room, at the top of the tower.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
It must be around here somewhere...

==Completion==
Splendid! I'll just need to take a few moments to go over this and I'll be right down.

Please let [[Lucille Waycrest|Lucy]] and [[Alexander Treadward|Alexander]] know I will be ready shortly.

==Notes==
;Entering the Manor
:{{Text|say|Lady Meredith Waycrest|I'm telling you, Arthur, you should not allow this. Our daughter, marrying a common merchant?!}}
:{{Text|say|Lord Arthur Waycrest|Lucy is merely following her heart, Meredith. Just as I did when I wed you.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Meredith Waycrest|Her heart isn't doing our house any favors...}}

Speaking with Arthur Waycrest
:Oh, hello there. I'm afraid we haven't met, but I thank you for being here for my dear Lucy.

:How can I help you?

:{{Gossip|The ceremony is ready to begin.}}

:Wel, this is a little embarrassing.

:You see, I had my speech written out in my notebook, but I seem to have... misplaced it.

:It must be somewhere in this room. If you could help me find it, I would be eternally grateful!

There are several objects - [[Rug]], [[Backpack (Drustvar)|Backpack]], [[Dresser]], [[Bookcase]], and [[Papers (Drustvar)|Papers]].

;Backpack
:{{Text|say|Lady Meredith Waycrest|Why would my husband put his notebook in Lucille's pack? Are you daft?}}

;Dresser
:{{Text|say|Lord Arthur Waycrest|While I am thankful for your help, I must ask that you not rummage through my daughter's undergarments...}}

;Bookcase
:{{Text|say|Lady Meredith Waycrest|We are looking for a book. Don't you think we would have already checked the bookcase?}}

;Papers
:{{Text|say|Lord Arthur Waycrest|I don't believe I left them with Lucy's letters, but I suppose it's prudent to be sure.}}

;Rug
:{{Text|say|Lady Meredith Waycrest|Are you trying to waste our time?}}

;Notes found in the Rug
:{{Text|say|Lord Arthur Waycrest|Oh, you've found it! Thank the tides!}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Lord Arthur Waycrest|Please inform the happy couple I will be down shortly.}}
:{{Text|say|Lord Arthur Waycrest|Oh, and do convey my apologies for the delay.}}
