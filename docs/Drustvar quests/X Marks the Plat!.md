==Objectives==
Find the Tattered Map's maker in [[Drustvar]].
* [[Tattered Map]]

==Description==
You find a folded piece of aged paper next to the deposit{{sic}}

Opening it up, you find a map of Drustvar with an X along the western coast.

Several crude poems adorn the paper, with one in particular drawing your attention.

"Once I were a [[pirate]],
livin' for rum and pleasure.
Since the mutiny, I've retired,
an' now I mine for treasure."

Whoever left this appears to have spent a significant time mining in these lands. They may have some insights you could benefit from.

==Completion==
<Seeing the map, [[First Mate Cinderfuse|Cinderfuse]] puts down her weapon.>

I see ye found me map. Guess that means ye be a [[miner]], too?

Well then, if yer lookin' fer booty, best bet would be ta check yer breeches. However, if ye lookin' fer work, then I got just the task fer ya.
