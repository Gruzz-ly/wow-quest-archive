==Objectives==
Find an Empty Jar and use it to catch 6 Hovering Bloodflies near [[Hangman's Point]].
* [[Bug-Catching Jar]] {{co|69.5|43.9|Drustvar}}
*[[Hovering Bloodflies|Bloodflies caught]] (6)

==Description==
I am all too familiar with the [[bloodfly]]'s bite. We had them all over the fields surrounding [[Waycrest Manor]].

Though I'm loathe to subject myself to them on purpose, if it will help convince these people, I am willing to deal with that nuisance. 

Find a jar and collect as many bloodflies as you can. They are common in these parts, and shouldn't be hard to find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|80|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to catch enough bloodflies?

==Completion==
Well done. 

With this many bloodflies at least one is bound to bite.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Pungent Solution]] and [[Harmful If Swallowed]] before heading out.

First head to the tent and pick up the Bug-Catching Jar next to [[Auntie Amanda Hale]], then start killing saurolisk, picking up Hovering Bloodflies, and digging Onions out of the ground at [[Hawthorne's Plot]] until a sufficiently pungent one is found.

At Hawthorne's Plot, [[Adela Hawthorne]] offers the optional side quest [[Quill or Be Quilled]]. Also, if players haven't killed her already, the rare [[Quillrat Matriarch]] is inside the tent.

In the beta, you would obtain [[Captive Bloodfly]].

==Progression==
