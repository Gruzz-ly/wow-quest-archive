==Objectives==
Test the Wicker Charm on Dormant Ravagers in [[Fletcher's Hollow]] until you successfully control one.
* [[Dormant Ravager]] controlled
* [[Wicker Charm]] (provided)

==Description==
<You've seen a charm like this in [[Fallhaven]] being used to control a wicker construct.

If you can figure out how to use it, you may be able to take control of one of the coven's wicker constructs.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|80|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What's this?

==Completion==
You were able to control one of their creations?! That's amazing!

This could really turn the tide for us!

==Notes==
While in [[Fletcher's Hollow]] for [[The Three Sisters]] and [[Break Them to Splinters]], look out for the [[Bladed Charm]] near the center of town, which starts this quest.

It can take up to five attempts to successfully charm the ravager.
