==Objectives==
Assist [[Lucille Waycrest]] as she studies the [[Tome of Silver and Ash|Tome of Ash and Silver]]{{sic}}.
* [[Candle]] lit (6)
* [[Lucille's Notes|Notes taken]]
* [[Lucille's Sewing Kit]]

==Description==
While I appreciate the dedication that went into compiling this tome, this thing reads like [[Engineering schematics|engineering instructions]] for a [[siege engine]]!

I'll need some time to comb through this information for anything that might be useful to us. I wouldn't mind some assistance, if you have a moment.

For starters, I could use some more light in here...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Did you find it?

==Completion==
Ah, you found it! Excellent.

<Lucille produces a long sewing needle from the kit>

...You look confused. Let me explain.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Now, it says here that the Order used special weapons against the [[Drust]] to counter their dark magic.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|If my theory is correct, then whatever they used could also disrupt the coven's magic.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Let me see if there is something here we can try...}}

Light the six candles in the room:
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Much better! Could you do me a favor and jot this down? My notebook is here somewhere...}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Okay... rowan wood? No... that doesn't grow around here...}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Alchemical fire? Oh, if only [[Warren Ashton|Master Ashton]] were here. He would have a field day!}}

Interact with the notebook on the table:
: ''With the notebook supported in one hand and a quill in the other, you make some notations.''
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|<Class>, I need you to find my sewing kit. It should be somewhere in my bag over there!}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|The tome mentions that the Inquisitors of old would use weapons of [[silver]] to disrupt the magic of the Drust.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|If the coven wields similar magic, they may be vulnerable to silver as well!}}

Dig through [[Lucille's Pack]], then turn in to her.

==Progression==
{{A New Order}}

==Notes==
* During development, Lucille Waycrest said, "I'm not sure what 'worgsbane' is, but... Wait what's this?", after mentioning rowan wood.

==Patch changes==
