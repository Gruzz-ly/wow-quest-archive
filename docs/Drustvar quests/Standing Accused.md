==Objectives==
Speak with Lucy Waycrest in [[Hangman's Point]].
* Speak with [[Lucille Waycrest]]

==Description==
So you wish to speak with the accused? I see no reason why not.

Be quick about it, though. I will not have our trial delayed. This woman will answer for the fate of our village!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|98|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What is your business here, mainlander?

==Completion==
So Lady Waycrest has asked that you convince me to let her stand trial?

I think she underestimates the danger of this situation...

==Notes==
On accept:
:''[[Marshal Everit Reade]] arrives along [[Waycrest Guard (NPC)|Waycrest Guards]] and [[Bella (horse)|Bella]], Lucille Waycrest's steed.''
:{{text|say|[[Fletcher's Hollow Villager]]|Look! Riders approaching from the woods!}}
:{{text|say|Constable Henry Framer|More interruptions!? What is it this time?!.}}
:{{text|yell|Marshal Everit Reade|Constable Framer - I order you to release the lady Waycrest into my custody!}}
:{{text|yell|Constable Henry Framer|Miss Waycrest stands accused of witchcraft! We will not turn her over unless she is absolved of this crime!}}
:{{text|yell|Marshal Everit Reade|There is no time to argue, if you do not stand aside we will take her by force!}}
:{{text|yell|Lucille Waycrest|You will do no such thing, Marshal! I order you to stand down!}}

Interact with Lucille Waycrest:
:You've arrived at a strange time, mainlander.
:What is your business here?
{{gossip|I'm here to rescue you.}}
:Rescue? And do you plan on cutting down these villagers to free me, as well?
:No, if you wish to help, you'll need to help me with the Marshal.
:While their accusations are misplaced, these are still my people, and I will not have them harmed to save me some discomfort. I will let them have their trial, and prove to them my innocence.
:However, I fear that the Marshal may take matters into his own hands, and I'm a bit tied up here. See if you can convince him to let this trial run its course.
