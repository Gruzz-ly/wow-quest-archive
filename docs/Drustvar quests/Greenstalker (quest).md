==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Greenstalker.jpg|Greenstalker|Slay Greenstalker}}
Slay Greenstalker.
*[[Greenstalker]] slain
*[[Tranquil Charm]] (provided)

==Description==
The mighty [[wolf]] Greenstalker was once a protector of these forests. He has fallen under the sway of dark forces. [[Theodor Forestwatcher|My brother]] and I attempted to calm his spirit, but he is too far gone.

Use the charm I have constructed to weaken him. I ask you <class>, please, end his suffering.

My brother is still weak and I must stay to protect him. Go now before the wolf consumes us all!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|80}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Did you free Greenstalker's [[ghost|spirit]]?

==Completion==
A grim but necessary task. I hope Greenstalker's spirit will find peace now.

Be careful, <name>. These woods are being twisted by ancient power.

: {{text|say|Adalyn Forestwatcher|Greenstalker was weakened but it is only a matter of time before he returns to the hunt.}}
: {{text|say|Adalyn Forestwatcher|You may find him in one of the caves nearby. Good luck, <name>.}}

On death, Greenstalker's spirit is freed and runs out of the cave.

;Description
Be wary mainlander. The mighty wolf Greenstalker, once a protector of these forests, has fallen under the sway of dark forces. My brother and I attempted to calm his spirit,but he is too far gone. He nearly killed my brother and I. He was still consumed by mindless rage even after we used a powerful charm. Using the charm weakened him but not enough. I ask you <class>, please, use the charm again. End his suffering. I must tend to my brother's wounds. Go now before the wolf consumes us all!
