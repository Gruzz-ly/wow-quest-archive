==Objectives==
Empower Korvash's Skull in the depths of [[Waycrest Manor]].
* [[Korvash's Skull]] empowered
* [[Gorak Tul (tactics)|Gorak Tul]] defeated
* Suggested players: 5

==Description==
The skull you have taken from [[Korvash]] needs to be steeped in [[Gorak Tul|Gorak Tul's]] magic to grant the power needed to bridge the gap to [[Thros]]. You must take it to a font of his power, and let it absorb his magic.

You will find one such font in Waycrest Manor - the epicenter of the coven's power. Here, their leader has tapped so freely into Tul's power that it emanates from the very walls.

Bring Korvash's skull to the heart of the manor and let it feast. Then, the effigy will be complete.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|93|60|}}
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (600x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Have you discovered a way into the Blighted Lands?

==Completion==
So, this thing is the key to opening the gateway?

You truly mean to go through with this, then?

==Notes==
On accept:

In the [[Catacombs (Waycrest Manor)|Catacombs]], use the extra action button.
