* Big red button pushed

==Description==
Okay, <name>, we're good to go. The G.M.O.D has plenty of [[:Azerite]] to cause some trouble!

We gotta head to my, er, OUR base in Drustvar. [[Gelbin Mekkatorque|Mekkatorque]], that freakin' [[king]] of the [[gnome]]s, is attacking our Azerite supply!

After we take care of the base, we're gonna take care of him! You get what I'm sayin'?

*[[Glowing Azerite]] (300x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Finally, some support!

==Completion==
You and [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] saved us! Never thought I'd say something nice about that chin waggler.

==Notes==
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Okay, hold on. I just gotta figure out which button makes this thing fly...}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Hah! Here we go. Ya better hang on, 'cause this thing is gonna ZOOM. It's fueled by Azerite, baby!}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Uhhhh, hold on... I think it's goin' too faaaaaaaaaast!}}

;In Krazzlefrazz
At Krazzlefrazz Outpost, kill [[Remote-Controlled Mechanogorilla]]s and [[Remote-Controlled Mechanotiger]]s who are fighting the [[Krazzlefrazz Guard]]s and [[Bilgewater Incinerator]]s. At Arom's Crossing kill [[Remote-Controlled Tank]]s, [[Remote-Controlled Mechanostrider]]s, [[Remote-Controlled Mechawolf|Remote-Controlled Mechawolves]] who are fighting the [[Krazzlefrazz Officer]]s, [[Bilgewater Worker]]s, and [[Bilgewater Mining Machine]]s.

Going far away displays: {{Text|Emote|Turn back and continue fighting the Alliance.}}

:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Whew! This baby can really move. Imagine what it'll do to the Alliance!}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|They ain't expectin' us to team up in a G.M.O.D and create some chaos!}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|And if anything goes wrong, roadside assistance will come fix it. I got my guys to throw in a warranty at no extra charge!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Professor Krazzlefrazz]]|Boss, <name>! You two gotta help, we got mechs from here to Arom's Crossing!}}
:{{Text|say|Remote-Controlled Mechanogorilla|*BZZT* Seriously, did your people iterate on this mech at all? It's barely first pass!}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|They got Krazzlefrazz handled now, let's go deal with the rest of this army up ahead!}}
:{{Text|say|Remote-Controlled Mechanogorilla|*BZZT* Goblin slapdashery can never match [[gnomish technology]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Remote-Controlled Mechanotiger|*BZZT* I just ran a scan... can your tech really be THAT outdated?!}}
:{{Text|say|Remote-Controlled Mechawolf|*BZZT* Hah! This is just pitiful, Gallywix. You're no match for my creations!}}

;Arom's Stand cleared
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|We're cookin' with gas now, AZERITE gas! Hit the big red button and let's see what this thing can really do.}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|HAHAHA! Take a good look at what gold and goblins can getcha, Mekkatorque. This baby is brimmin' with Azerite!}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Now that's what I'm talkin' about, look at all that Azerite! All that destruction... all that POWER!}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Now THIS is what I paid for! Mekkatorque's got nothin' on this.}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Let's get back to the base, see if we can find where Mekkatorque is controlling these things.}}
