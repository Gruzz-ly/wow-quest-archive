==Objectives==
Lay the Crimson Bouquet next to the Simple Gravestone in [[Whitegrove Chapel]].
* Flowers [[Simple Gravestone|placed]]

==Description==
I have a favor to ask you of a... personal nature.

Whitegrove Chapel lies to the north, just past the town of [[Corlain]]. Someone... important to me rests in the graveyard on its grounds.

I've been unable to visit his grave for some time, and I would like to pay my respects. If you come upon Whitegrove Chapel, could you lay these flowers next to his headstone?

Just look for the most recent grave there...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Completion==
Lucy sent you? I am relieved to hear she yet lives. 

My name is Alexander Treadward. I am... well, I was Lucy's fiance.

==Notes==
Upon completion of [[An Improvised Arsenal]] at [[Watchman's Rise]], [[Lucille Waycrest]] offers this breadcrumb to [[Whitegrove Chapel]].
