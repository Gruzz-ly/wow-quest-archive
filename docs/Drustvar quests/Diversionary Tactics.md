==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Frostmange.jpg|Frostmange| An especially mean, especially mangy yeti.}}
Defeat Frostmange in [[Alpine Rise]].
* [[Frostmange]] slain

==Description==
Our destination is that cottage up ahead. I know it doesn't look like much, but a great deal of history is hidden inside.

First, though, we'll need to deal with that massive yeti camped just outside. I'd hate to ask it of you, but I'll need you to draw his attention so I can slip inside.

Once you've taken care of him, I'll meet you within.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'll meet you inside, <class>.

==Completion==
That was close! 

I'm glad to have such a capable <class> as my guardian. I would hate to be your enemy.

==Progression==
{{The Order of Embers}}
