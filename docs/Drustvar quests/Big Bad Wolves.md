==Objectives==
Slay 10 [[Hexed Howler]]s in [[Carver's Harbor]].

==Description==
[[Wolf|Wolves]] with strange, glowing eyes have taken over the area! I don't know what they are or why they're glowing but it cannot mean anything good. They have to be removed!

Please, <class>, slay them before more of my friends are killed.

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you get rid of those beasts?

==Completion==
With those monsters gone, no more of my people are going to get killed.
