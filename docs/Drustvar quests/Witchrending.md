==Objectives==
Use Witchrend to defeat Matrons Ceridwen, Adeline and Letitia in [[Corlain]].
* [[Matron Ceridwen]] slain {{co|29.1|27.7|Drustvar}}
* [[Matron Adeline]] slain {{co|30.4|28.8|Drustvar}}
* [[Matron Letitia]] slain {{co|27.1|29.3|Drustvar}}

==Description==
A blunderbuss? I'd have to say, I wasn't quite expecting that.

Nonetheless, now that we have a weapon, we have an advantage. I think it's time we take the fight directly to the coven.

[[Marshal Everit Reade|Marshal Reade]] informed me that several of their Matrons have been spotted throughout Corlain. Let's show them what happens to an enemy of [[House Waycrest]].

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Wickerwoven Shoes
|Banisher Walkers
|Crone-Seeker's Walkers
|Waycrest Militia Stompers
|Wickerwoven Bands
|Banisher Wristwraps
|Crone-Seeker's Shackles
|Waycrest Militia Armplates
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Have you taken care of the Matrons?

==Completion==
Let us hope this sends a message to the coven.  As long as we have weapons to fight them, we will persevere.

Speaking of weapons, I believe our blacksmith has an idea on how to take down that barrier. You should have a word with him.

==Notes==
Lucille also offers [[To Have Loved and Lost]], which is an optional breadcrumb to [[Whitegrove Chapel]]. Additionally, the Wanted Poster now offers [[WANTED: Sister Lilias (Alliance)]].

On the way into Corlain, a dead [[Corlain Townsperson]] starts [[Remembering the Fallen]]. On the north side of town, near the rare [[Gorged Boar]], [[Inquisitor Mace]] starts [[Reeking Refuge]].
