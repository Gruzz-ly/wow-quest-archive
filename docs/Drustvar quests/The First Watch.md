==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Sister Adela.jpg|Sister Adela|The Heartsbane witch leading the garrison at Watchman's Rise}}
Defeat Sister Adela at [[Watchman's Rise]].
* [[Sister Adela]] slain

==Description==
As you can see, the coven has conscripted my own guardsmen into their service. Though I am loath to battle my own, these men are too corrupted by the coven's magic to be saved.

For them, death is the only mercy we can give.

The Inquisitors and I can handle the regiment stationed outside. We will need you to find and take out their leader.

Your Inquisitors await your command, <class>. Are you ready to take the tower?

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Rise-Breacher's Band
|First-Watcher's Lantern
|Waycrest Inquisitor's Shield
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
We assault the tower at your command.

==Completion==
Well fought, <class>.  The tower is ours.

Now, we should set our sights on Corlain proper!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|yell|Marshal Everit Reade|Alright men, let us take this tower and drive the coven from Corlain!}}
:{{text|yell|Marshal Everit Reade|Glory to House Waycrest!}}
:''The troops run forward and start attacking.''

Pass by Reade to enter the tower:
:{{text|yell|Marshal Everit Reade|We can handle these soldiers, Inquisitor. Find their leader!}}

Find [[Sister Adela]] upstairs:
:{{text|say|Sister Adela|Corlain belongs to the coven!}}

Defeat her:
:{{text|say|Sister Adela|You cannot... prevail...}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade| Excellent work, Inquisitor! This tower will provide us a vantage over Corlain and all of its holdings.}}
