==Objectives==
Collect 10 Silver Nuggets from the [[Bleak Hills Mine]].
* [[Silver Nugget]] (10)

==Description==
<Class>, I have another objective we should consider. 

The Bleak Hills Mine is not too far from our location. Though the miners there principally extract [[iron]], they do on occasion find [[silver]] among the veins.

We do not know the current state of the mine, but it's unlikely that the coven has passed it over. However, it would be worth braving whatever dangers lie there to recover some silver to use against them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* [[Small Azerite Fragment]] (75x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* [[Silvered Weapons]]
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Did you have any luck with the mine?

==Completion==
You found some silver? Excellent!

Though it isn't much, any quantity of silver should help our efforts against the coven!

==Notes==
Up in [[Bleak Hills Mine]], [[Elsie Wright]] offers two side quests: [[An Eight-Legged Curse (Alliance)]] and [[All Wrapped Up (Alliance)]]. Pick them up before getting too far into the silver gathering.
