==Objectives==
Find Lady [[Meredith Waycrest]] in [[Whitegrove Chapel]].
* Lady Waycrest found
* [[Roland the Knife]] slain
* [[Assassin's Orders]]

==Description==
Meredith never joined the ceremony. She might be in trouble!

Lucy is in shock, and I cannot leave her here. You must go in my stead to the tower, and ensure the safety of your Lady.

Do this for me, and you will be rewarded.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
*[[Small Azerite Fragment]] (75x [[Azerite (resource)]])
*+75 [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
What have you found?

==Completion==
Her mother ordered the assassination!?

I had known that she didn't agree with Lucy marrying a merchant, but I would never suspect she would go so far to prevent it!

Thank you, <class>.
