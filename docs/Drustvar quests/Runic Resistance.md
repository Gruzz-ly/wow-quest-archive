==Objectives==
Solve the runic puzzle to activate the Drust Effigy in [[Gol Inath]].
* Runic Wards unlocked {{co|27.6|58.8|Drustvar}}

==Description==
Whatever is going on with this effigy, I don't think it's going to open the gateway without our help.

These runes must be the key. There must be some way we can use them to activate the effigy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
*[[Glowing Azerite Crystal]] (200x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There must be some trick to these runes...

==Completion==
Remarkable! Yesterday, I believed this place to only exist in tales and legends, and now I stand a footstep away from it...

I just hope that at least some of those tales were exaggerations...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Now... there must be some clue in here as to how this works.}}

Just like the rune-locked treasure chests in Drustvar, there are four runes on the wall that reveal the solution.

To complete the puzzle, click the runes in this pattern: right, up, down, left.

Incorrect order:
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|That seemed unpleasant...}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Perhaps the runes need to be activated in a particular pattern...}}

First correct rune:
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|It vanished! Could these runes be serving as wards?}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Try to activate another.}}

Final rune:
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|You've done it! The effigy worked!}}

==Progression==
{{The Pride of Kul Tiras}}
