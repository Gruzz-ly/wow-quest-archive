==Objectives==
Kill 10 enthralled animals in the [[Shrouded Foothills]].
* Enthralled Wildlife slain  (10)

==Description==
<The wildlife in the foothills appear to be under [[Helena Gentle|Helena's]] spell, and this villager appears to be one of their victims. 

They must be the cause of the recent disappearances from [[Fallhaven]].

Perhaps if their numbers were cut down, they would pose less of a threat to the townspeople.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<With the cursed wildlife culled, the villagers of Fallhaven should no longer have to fear the foothills.>

==Notes==
While chasing after Helena Gentle for [[Witch Hunt]], pick up [[Cracking the Curse]] from her spellbook and this quest from the dead Fallhaven Villager just outside.

Kill ten [[Bewitched Darkmaw]]s or [[Ensorcelled Bonepicker]]s to complete the quest automatically.

==Progression==
