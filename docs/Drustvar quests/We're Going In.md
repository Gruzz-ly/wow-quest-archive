==Objectives==
Activate the teleportation runes to enter [[Iwen's Sanctum|Sef's Retreat]].
*Activate the [[Runic Ward|sigils]]
* Use [[Portal to Sef Iwen's Sanctum]]

==Description==
This used to be a [[Drust]] shrine. There is a series of sigils that, once invoked, will allow us to teleport to my old sanctum.

<Sef looks around somewhat confused and clears her throat.>

It has been centuries since I've been here, I'm having a bit of trouble remembering the order in which the sigils need to be activated to open the portal.

I hope you're feeling adventurous. Oh, and be cautious. I enchanted the runes to keep would be intruders out by force.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Home sweet home!

==Notes==
The order for the activation runes are: top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right.

==Progression==
