==Objectives==
Collect Gravebloom, create and use salve, then find Aaron Cresterly.
* [[Gravebloom]] (10)
* Salve created and applied
* [[Aaron Cresterly]] freed

==Description==
The spirits in the cemetery are riled up! I'd ask 'em direct but I don't have any of the necessary salve I use to commune with the dead. My family's been making it for ages!

The herbs and tools I use to make it are inside, but I can't get over there! Some of those spirits are beyond reason and attack me on sight!

Why don't you go collect those herbs, make the salve with my tools, and ask one of the calmer spirits what's going on. Aaron Cresterly is a good spirit to look for.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Stranger, lend me your aid! I am ensnared in a witch's foul magic and I do not know how much longer I can resist! Destroy the circle binding me!

==Completion==
A witch has infested this goodly place with her foul power. Stranger, you have proven yourself a friend. Perhaps you will be our salvation!

==Notes==
Click on the [[Ritual Urn]] to obtain the Grave Vision buff in order to see [[Disturbed Spirit (Drustvar)|Disturbed Spirits]], [[Ghost Child]]ren, and Aaron. Click on the [[Major Corrupting Circle]] to free him.

During the beta, you would create the [[Gravebloom Salve]].
