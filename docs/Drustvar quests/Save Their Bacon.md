==Description==
This is going to sound strange, <class>, but some of my workers were turned into pigs! Lucky I was out on an errand, or I'd have been caught too! Now my people are tied up awaiting... processing.

<Thomas suppresses the urge to retch.>

I can't get past those monsters, but you look like the sort who could. Not sure if this helps, buy I coulda sworn I heard some wild cackling coming from the warehouse.

Please... save my people!

==Rewards==
You will receive:

==Progress==
Up here they're safe from those monsters. Hopefully we can sort this mess out and return them to normal.

Thank you for sending my workers to a safe spot.

Hopefully my men won't have to remain pigs for long.
