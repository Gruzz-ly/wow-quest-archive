==Objectives==
Rescue [[Edwin Maldus]] from the [[Wickerites|Wickerite cultists]] in [[Autumnvale]].
*Save Edwin, again

==Description==
You must hurry! [[Lord Autumnvale]] brought Edwin off to that cave right when he returned, saying something about "an offering of blood!"

I think they mean to sacrifice him to appease the [[Wicker Man]]!

Just what kind of crazy [[cult]] is this?!

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Help me!

==Completion==
Those cultists tried to kill me!

I don't know about you, but I've had about enough of this Wicker Man business!

==Notes==
