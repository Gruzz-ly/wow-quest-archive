==Objectives==
Recover the "relics".
*[["Relic of the Makers" (quest item)]]
*[["Genuine Titan Disc"]]
*[["Ancient Potsherds"]]

==Description==
<The discarded paper contains a list of the items the [[Adventurer's Society]] has found during the course of their 'excavation' here at the [[North Pass Caverns|Northern Caverns]].

It is unlikely they actually found relics, but there's no harm in recovering the items the kids found. At the least they're souvenirs of the adventure.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Woah! You found our relics! Aren't they neat?

==Completion==
Isn't our stuff neat? We found real relics!

I bet [[Brann Bronzebeard]] will be impressed. We're gonna write to him once we get back home.

==Progression==
{{The North Pass Caverns}}

==Patch changes==
