==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|image=Ancient Sentinel.jpg|name=Ancient Sentinel|text=Slay the Ancient Sentinel}}
Defeat the Ancient Sentinel.
*[[Ancient Sentinel]] slain

==Description==
Hey! Mainlander!

I know I'm supposed to be trying to knock over cairns and hauling out lost rangers, but d'you see that massive stone monster? I'm thinking that's gonna be a problem.

You look like you know how to handle yourself. Think between the two of us we can take it down?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|80|}}
* 20,550 [[XP]]

==Progress==
That's a huge stone golem. We should wreck it before it wrecks us.

==Completion==
I suppose I'm not really surprised Arthur didn't exactly follow orders. But I don't think I can complain with the results.

Thanks for making sure he wasn't entirely in over his head.

;Description
The little monsters were bad, but the big one is what worries me. I saw it kill one of my friends. It could do some damage if it decided to head into town. Please kill it, <name>. Stop it before it can rampage into Fallhaven or Glenbrook.
