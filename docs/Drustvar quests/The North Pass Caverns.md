==Objectives==
Find [[Thaddeus Rifthold]] near the [[North Pass Caverns]].

==Description==
Please, you must help!

My grandson got lost around the caves to the north, and I'm so afraid that the [[trogg]]s might have got him! 

My husband went after him, but he's getting on in years, and I fear he imagines himself tougher than he really is.

Could you help them? You should be able to catch up with Thaddeus along the northern road.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm not lost! My grandson and his friends ran off and I've been looking for them. I wanted to find them before the troggs did!
