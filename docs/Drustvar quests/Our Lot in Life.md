==Objectives==
Collect 10 Gravebloom.
* [[Gravebloom]] (10)

==Description==
It seems that [[Captain Amalia Stone|Amalia]] isn't taking to [[Undead|undeath]] well.

I know an [[herb]] that may help.

This cemetery is crawling with gravebloom. For the living, it grants the ability to see [[Ghost|spirits]].

As for the undead...

This may tie her back to reality just enough to be... sane.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
What Amalia is going through... is familiar to me. She will learn how to embrace her new status as [[Forsaken]].

I will help.

==Completion==
Ah yes... in perfect condition.

This should do the trick.
