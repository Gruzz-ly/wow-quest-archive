==Objectives==
Slay Sister Westwood.
* [[Sister Westwood]] slain

==Description==
Our loathsome foe, 'Sister' Westwood, yet continues her work. After subjugating myself, she set her malicious sights on my companion, fair [[Mercy Fairwater|Mercy]]. 

Of us three, Mercy was most kind and possessing of uncommon inner strength, yet I fear for her. Corrupting such a soul would make for a fearsome creature, indeed.

Stop the vile ritual before Mercy is taken. Allow the dead their rest. Slay Sister Westwood and free us from her grasp!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
*[[Small Azerite Fragment]] (75x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Completion==
Our thanks to you, brave champion. You have freed us from the witch's vile influence and stopped her corruption from spreading. Our very souls have been saved by thy actions.

Now we may rest.
