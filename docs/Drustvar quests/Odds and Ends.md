==Objectives==
Collect 4 Organic Matter Samples and 3 Bags of Reagents.
* [[Organic Matter Sample]] (4)
* [[Bag of Reagents]] (3)

==Description==
[[Warren Ashton|Master Ashton's]] going to probably need something bracing once we get him free. I know of a quick potion guaranteed to get anyone to snap out of it, but I'm going to need a few things first.

Those wicker dogs down there have some organic parts I can use and the witches are carrying bags of reagents. They'll almost certainly have what I need.

Bring those to me and I'll handle the rest once we get Master Ashton back.

==Progress==
Did you have any luck?

==Completion==
Hmm... Very interesting. And pungent. Perhaps my first order of business will be something to remove the smell.
