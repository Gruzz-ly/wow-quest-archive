==Objectives==
Destroy [[Writhing Cocoon]]s to rescue 8 [[Bleak Hills Miner]]s in the [[Bleak Hills Mine]].
* Miners rescued (8)

==Description==
While I was able to get out of the mine, some of my friends weren't so lucky. I saw those spiders wrap them up in their webs... probably to save them for a snack.

It was terrible, but all I could do was run.

Will you help them?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
I can't imagine how scared those miners are...

==Completion==
You saved them!

You're certainly a hero in my book!

==Notes==
In the [[Bleak Hills Mine]] for [[Precious Metals (Alliance)]], [[Elsie Wright]] offers this quest and [[An Eight-Legged Curse (Alliance)]]. Pick them both up before heading out.

On complete of both:
:{{text|say|Elsie Wright|Oh, thanks again for taking care of those spiders. Not sure how much longer I would've lasted.}}
:{{text|say|Elsie Wright|If it's all the same to you, I'm getting out of here before more of those things come from the mine!}}

==Progression==
