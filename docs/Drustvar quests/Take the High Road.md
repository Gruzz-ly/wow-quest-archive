==Objectives==
Meet with [[Lucille Waycrest]] at [[Arom's Stand]] in [[Drustvar]].

==Description==
Let us continue to Arom's Stand. It will take some time to parse the knowledge of the tome and train more inquisitors for our cause.

If the order's weapons are as effective against the coven as they were against the [[Drust]], we may stand a chance of rescuing my family and restoring this land to its former glory.

I will make my way there on foot. Until we meet again, <class>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}

==Completion==
I'm glad you made it, <name>. 

We'll need to get started right away if we want to use the knowledge in this tome to fight the coven.

Follow the road south across the [[Highroad Pass]]. Not far along is [[Arthur Tradewind]] to meet up with for [[The High Thornspeaker]]. Further up, look for a [[Wanted Poster]] on the ground at {{co|41.2|41.0|Drustvar}} in the hand of [[Huntsman Turney]]. It starts [[WANTED: The Rime Huntress (Alliance)]].

:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|You don't understand, Marshal. The knowledge we've unearthed could be the key to saving my father from the coven!}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|I wish I had your faith, Lucy, but I think it will take more than ancient legends to eliminate this threat.}}
