==Objectives==
Return to [[Dorian Atwater]] at [[Port Fogtide]].
* [[Hastily Scrawled Note (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<The [[elemental]] has a piece of parchment whipping around madly inside its tornado.>

HHsssssss.

<The elemental ejects the page into your face.>

HHHHSSSSSSsssshh.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I see my [[Bound Sky|little helper]] found you just fine.

==Completion==
I'm not fond of [[Jaina Proudmoore|nobles]] sticking their nose in my work before it's finished. Deal with this.

==Notes==
After both [[Balance in All Things]] and [[Make it Wright]] have been completed, a [[Bound Sky]] will appear in order to deliver this quest.

;Accept
: ''The Bound Sky disappears in a bolt of lightning.''

Back at the slip, Dorian has quite the operation going. [[Algerson Lumberjack]]s are stacking logs from the delivery cart by the slip, where [[Thornspeaker Adept]]s are purifying them. [[Bound Sky]]s are working on the ship and flying smaller logs onto it. [[Bound Rain]] are maintaining the Fog Wards. Both of the port's [[forge]]s are going full tilt, being worked by a Bound Sky at the bellows and a [[Bound Hearth]] maintaining the heat, with [[Bound Earth]]s inserting the [[ore]] from [[Bleak Hills Mine]] and extracting the smelted ingots, which are stacked to be delivered to another Bound Earth apparently crafting metal parts. Another Bound Earth delivers the parts to the ship.

At the side of the dock, Dorian is focusing on her building plans with Jaina visiting her.

On turning in this quest:
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|Should be done by day's end. Sooner, if you stay out of my way.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|That quickly? How is that possible?}}
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|I make it a point not to share my methods, [[Lord Admiral]].}}
: ''Sal walks over to his wife's side and affably speaks to Jaina.''
:{{text|say|Sal Atwater|She's just a tad shy, ma'am. Pay her no mind. Would you like some warm milk while you wait?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Ah... yes. Thank you.}}
