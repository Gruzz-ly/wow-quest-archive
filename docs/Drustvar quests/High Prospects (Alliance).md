==Objectives==
Investigate [[Gol Osigr]] for clues about the jewels that were used to construct the shrine.
* [[Runic Warrior]] Investigated
* [[Pristine Kubiline Shards]] (6)

==Description==
<Checking your notes, you find that the [[earthen]] had extracted the gems from some [[earth elemental]]s to the south.

Looking at your map, you wonder if he was referring to the now ruins of a once ancient settlement that has become littered with [[Drust construct|constructs]] and [[undead]].

Perhaps investigating there will yield some clues as to where to find these jewels.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<All of the cracked jewels will definitely need to be replaced.>

==Completion==
<You begin to remove all the cracked gems from the shrine and carefully start placing the new ones in.

Placing the final one, a pulse radiates from the shrine, as the light in the area seems to draw into it.

That strange, similar glow now emanating from the shrine leads you to believe it is once again active.>

==Progression==
{{A Rocky Start (Alliance)}}
