==Objectives==
Collect 5 Smuggled Goods from the sea near the shipwreck close to [[Anyport]].
* [[Smuggled Goods]] (5)

==Description==
Hey! Wanna make some quick gold?

See, I had a mishap a few weeks ago with a shipment. Too much grog, dark seas, sudden rocks. You know, that old story.

Anyway, my cargo's been floating out there and no one will get it back for me. Can you believe it? You bring my cargo back and I'll pay you a generous recovery fee.

We got a deal? Great!

Oh, uh, watch out for the sharks. Did I forget to mention the sharks?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You get the goods?

==Completion==
Hey thanks! Bit damp but still good.

==Progression==
{{Anyport}}
