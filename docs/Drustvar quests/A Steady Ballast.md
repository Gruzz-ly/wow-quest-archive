==Objectives==
Find Angus Ballaster at the [[Corlain Armory]].
* [[Angus Ballaster]] found {{co|24.5|37.2|Drustvar}}
* Defeat the coven ambush

==Description==
The Armory presents us a ripe opportunity, <class>... one I suggest we take.

If this battle were to draw out, we have little means to repair our arms and armor. A blacksmith is invaluable to any war effort, and Ballaster is one of our best.

The Armory is but a short ride from here. I suggest you get to Ballaster before it's too late!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* [[Small Azerite Fragment]] (50x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
The blacksmith won't survive long with the coven hunting him down.

I'd recommend leaving posthaste.

==Completion==
Our fortunes are turning up. 

Having a blacksmith at the tower will ensure our Inquisitors stay equipped for battle.

==Notes==
Just outside the [[Corlain Armory]], [[Inquisitor Yorrick]] starts [[Digging for Scraps]].

Ballaster is in the cellar beneath the house:
:{{text|say|Angus Ballaster|Get back, or ye'll be meetin' my hammer!}}
:{{text|say|Angus Ballaster|Wait... yer not one o' them!}}

Speak with him:
:It's a blessin' te see someone that dun have that dark glow in their eyes. I was beginnin te think there was no one left these blasted witches didn't put a curse on.
:Angus Ballaster at yer service. What ye be doin in a blighted hellhole like this?
{{gossip|We could use a blacksmith to help fight the coven.}}
:Well, I don't know ye from a hole in the hull, but an enemy of the coven is a friend of mine. Plus, it'll be easier to get outta here with an extra blade at me side.
:Ye say the word and we'll be outta here.
{{gossip|Let's go.}}
:{{text|say|Angus Ballaster|Alright, ye jus' lead the way...}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Yorrick|You found him! We should leave quickly. The coven has this place surrounded!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Yorrick|Wait... what was that?}}
:{{text|yell|Heartsbane Sister|They're in here! Flush them out!}}
: ''Angus steps forward, hefting his hammer.''
:{{text|say|Angus Ballaster|Just ye try! Ye'll taste my hammer, witch!}}

Defeat the ambushers:
:{{text|say|Heartsbane Sister|You cannot escape... the Mother...}}
:{{text|say|Angus Ballaster|Ah, cram it, ye foul-tongued nag. Yer "Mother" can rot in the bowels of a sea snake!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Yorrick|If you're finished, I think we should be leaving here.}}
:{{text|say|Angus Ballaster|Aye, ye be correct there. Lead the way!}}
: ''They head up the stairs.''
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Yorrick|I will escort Ballaster back to Watchman's Rise. I will meet you there presently.}}
