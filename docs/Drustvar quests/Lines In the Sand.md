==Objectives==
Seek out [[Veriss]] at the [[Terrace of the Devoted]] in [[Vol'dun]] to begin your blood trials there.

==Description==
This was all I had to offer you, young [[Inscription|scribe]]. But your journey is not yet at an end.

If you're up for some traveling, and interested in some of the deadlier blood contracts, you're going to have to travel to [[Zandalar]].

Once there, seek out a [[sethrak]] by the name of Veriss in an area known as Vol'dun.

<[[Kronah]] grabs an odd-looking jar and opens it. The foulest odor you've ever smelled emanates from it and you reel in disgust.>

Pickled [[crocolisk]] eggs are my favorite. Would you like some?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah! A new initiate! Were you wondering how I knew? Because of the blood on your hands, of course.

<A sly grin crosses over the sethrak's face.>

I am Veriss, the resident keeper of the Zandalar blood contracts.

If you wish to inscribe your name into them, there is something I must ask of you first.

==Notes==
Veriss is located inside the [[Sanctuary of the Devoted]] within the Terrace.

==Progression==
