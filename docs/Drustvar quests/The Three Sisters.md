==Objectives==
Confront Sister Ashwell, Sister Early, and Sister Mooring in [[Fletcher's Hollow]].
* [[Sister Ashwell]] slain {{co|68.5|63.3|Drustvar}}
* [[Sister Early]] slain {{co|70.5|63.1|Drustvar}}
* [[Sister Mooring]] slain {{co|70.1|62.1|Drustvar}}

==Description==
If you're looking to absolve [[Lucille Waycrest|Miss Waycrest]] of this mess, you'll need to head into the town. Recently, I've seen some oddly dressed women among the creatures, who seem to be calling the shots.

It's likely that they're the key to this whole nightmare, but we can't get in to question them. Their minions don't seem to slow you down, though. 

If you can get to them, you might be able to find some answers for the both of us. Be careful, though. They likely aren't very friendly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|39|60|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you confronted the strange women?

==Completion==
They weren't willing to talk?  That's unfortunate.

At least with them gone, we may stand a chance to take back the town.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Evelyn Pare|A word of warning, <class>. Avoid the mine at all costs.}}
:{{text|say|Evelyn Pare|I don't know what they're up to, but the magic coming out of that place seems to sap your very life away.}}
:{{text|say|Evelyn Pare|I've already lost two good men in there. Don't make yourself the third.}}

A bonus objective, [[Break Them to Splinters]] also opened up. Feel free to work on it while scouting the town.

Also, a [[Bladed Charm]] in the center of town starts [[Charming the Lifeless]].

At the south end of the quest area is a [[Seething Cache]]. Interact with it to spawn roughly 10 [[Manifested Hate]]. Clear them and loot the chest again for some Azerite and the [[Band of Seething Manifest]].

Mooring:
:{{text|say|Sister Mooring|You should not have interfered!}}
:{{text|say|Sister Mooring|My sisters will avenge me...}}

Early:
:{{text|say|Sister Early|This town belongs to the coven, interloper!}}
:{{text|say|Sister Early|You will fall before the matron...}}

Ashwell:
:{{text|say|Sister Ashwell|The coven will swallow all!}}
:{{text|say|Sister Ashwell|The coven will claim you...}}

On defeat of the third, loot [[Levae's Missive]] from her corpse, which starts [[A Revealing Missive]].

==Progression==
