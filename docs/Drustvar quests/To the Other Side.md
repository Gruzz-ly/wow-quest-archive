* South Gate Opened {{co|32.5|20.5|Drustvar}}
* West Gate Opened {{co|33.7|20.9|Drustvar}}

==Description==
It looks like the coven is using [[Corlain]] as a base of operations. There's no way we'll be able to cut through this many of them without the rest of the Inquisitors.

They must still be stuck behind the wall. 

<Class>, there are three smaller footmen gates along the walls into Corlain. See if you can get them open so our allies can make their way through.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
What news of the other inquisitors?

==Completion==
All here and accounted for?

Very well, we've no time to waste. We must ride to Waycrest Manor!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Hexecutioner]] and [[Ruinous Rituals]] before heading out.

Just inside, the [[Corlain Citizen's Journal]] starts [[The Fall of Corlain (quest)]].
