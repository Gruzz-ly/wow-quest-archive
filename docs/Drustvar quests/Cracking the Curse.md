==Objectives==
Destroy the 4 Lesser Effigies in the [[Shrouded Foothills]].
* [[Lesser Effigy]] destroyed (4)

==Description==
<In her haste, it looks like [[Helena Gentle|Helena]] left her spellbook behind. The pages of this book detail the ritual that she used to entrap the villagers of [[Fallhaven]].

It seems the effigy holding the spell in the village is protected by smaller ones surrounding the town. If these are destroyed, you may be able to affect the one holding the spell on the townsfolk.>

==Rewards==

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The magical energies surrounding the effigy have dissipated.>

==Notes==
While chasing after Helena Gentle for [[Witch Hunt]], pick up this from her spellbook and [[Furious Familiars]] from the dead Fallhaven Villager just outside.

Four effigies:
*{{co|59.5|28.3|Drustvar}}
*{{co|57.7|27.8|Drustvar}}
*{{co|57.5|30.1|Drustvar}}
*{{co|56.2|29.1|Drustvar}}

Destroy all four, then return to the main Cursed Effigy in town.
