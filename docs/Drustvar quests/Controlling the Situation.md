==Objectives==
Collect 5 Control Charms from the [[Haunted Servitor (Drustvar)|Haunted Servitors]].
* [[Control Charm]] (5)

==Description==
I have been observing this macabre army of, wood, flesh and bone and how the witches and servitors control the lesser creations with charms. I believe I can craft an even more powerful charm - one we can use.

In the hearts of the servitors are the very strongest charms. They are used to anchor the Ancient [[Drust]] into their physical forms. They are precisely what we need.

Good luck. It is doubtful that they will part with them easily.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
* [[Heartsbane Charm]]
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Were you able to collect enough charms?

==Completion==
Excellent. I should be able to do some... Interesting things with these.

==Progression==
{{Stick It To 'Em!}}
