==Objectives==
Take the [[:Runic Power Core]]s to [[Ulfar]].
* Meet [[Arthur Tradewind]]
* Ride up to [[Ulfar's Den]]

==Description==
My teacher, Ulfar, the High Thornspeaker, must be informed of what's been going on here.

I can't leave just yet. There are too many wounded and we'll need to handle the last few remaining constructs.

You have proven trustworthy, friend. Take a few of these runic cores to Ulfar for me. 

Arthur will meet you at the head of the path to Ulfar's den.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
*[[Small Azerite Fragment]] (75x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Completion==
What do you have here, mainlander? Ah, I see. My students met with much stronger threats than we'd expected.

Thank you for helping them.
