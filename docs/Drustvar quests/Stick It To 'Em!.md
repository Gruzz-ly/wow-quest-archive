==Objectives==
Use the [[Crimsonwood Demolisher]] to destroy witch forces in the [[Crimson Forest]].
* Use [[Greater Control Charm]]
* Destroy Witch Forces (0/100%)
* Signal Point reached {{co|19.6|50.5|Drustvar}}
* Tell Cleardawn to send signal {{co|19.3|50.7|Drustvar}}
*[[Greater Control Charm]] (provided)

==Description==
We have been able to stop the Grand Rite but the witches will try again unless we act.

We have to destroy them. Utterly.

<Cleardawn smiles.>

How kind of them to give us the means.

You've helped us get this far, <name>. You control the Demolisher. Destroy everything you see! 

Once we've finished we can signal for help out of here!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* [[Small Azerite Fragment]] (75x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Completion==
The plans for the Grand Rite are ruined and their rutial sites are in shambles. [[Warren Ashton|Master Ashton]] will be safe here in Arom's stand and we can finally send reinforcements to [[Falconhurst]] by [[gryphon]].

In all, a job well done! Thank you for your vital help.

==Notes==
;Accept
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|I have fashioned a greater control charm out of the others we acquired. Use it on the demolisher!}}
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|We'll ride that monster out of here!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|More than that, we'll use it to destroy them! Come on! Everyone climb aboard!}}

Use the [[Greater Control Charm]] and hop on the golem. It has these abilities:
#{{abilities|Slam|range=20|cd=1 sec|Slams the opponent, causing physical damage in a 20 yd cone.|notes=0.5 sec cast|id=256942}}
#{{abilities|Stomp|range=20|cd=5 sec|Unleash an earthshaking stomp, knocking down enemies with 20 for 5 sec.|notes=0.5 sec cast|id=256947}}
#{{abilities|Speed Up|range=30|cd=10 sec|Increase speed for 5 sec.|id=281258}}

Get to killing.

* Kill Golems ([[Gnarled Hulk]]s) (1%)
* Kill Heavies ([[Gnarled Brute]]s) (1%)
* Kill Small Wicker and witch ([[Hexwood Seer]]s, [[Hexwood Binder]]s, [[Crimson Evoker]]s, [[Timber Mongrel]]s, and [[Heartwood Soldier]]s) (0.5%)

After entering the vehicle:
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|We can signal for an extraction at the high ground northwest of here.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|But before we go, we should take advantage of the situation and lay waste to their army!}}

Random messages:
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|Ha! Boldly done!}}
:{{text|say|Marten Webb|This is insane! Don't go so fast!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|There is a certain satisfaction in using the coven's own weapon against them.}}
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|I do quite enjoy its earth-shaking stomp!}}

At 100%:
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|We should start heading for the ridge in the northwest. Arom's Stand will have a clear line of sight for our signal.}}
:{{text|say|Marten Webb|Is it almost over? Please tell me it's almost over!}}

Head to the marked point on the map after reaching 100%, then speak with Cleardawn:
:Let's get to work.
{{gossip|Send the signal. Let's get out of here!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|There are gryphon riders waiting for this signal.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|It is safe to fly over the forest now. I just hope they get here quickly.}}

Four [[Waycrest Guard's Mount]]s fly in. Hop on any of them to fly back to [[Arom's Stand]].
:''Since [[patch 8.2.5]], the gryphons are bugged and cannot be mounted. However, the quest can still be turned in at this point if you get to Arom's Stand by other means or if you wait 5 minutes at which point the gryphons respawn and one becomes mountable.''

;Turn in
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|Thank you for the assisting me, <name>. I will report our mission's success to Lady Lucille.}}
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|I shudder to think what might have become of me had you and the Inquisitor here not intervened.}}
:{{text|say|Marten Webb|I appreciate not being dead.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|The Order of Embers has stood against Gorak Tul once again. With allies, we shall continue to stand strong.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|Fair winds, <name>.}}

This concludes the "Stick It To 'Em!" chapter of [[Drust Do It.]]. Don't forget the other fork of the [[Drustvar storyline]] that started with [[The Road to Corlain]].
