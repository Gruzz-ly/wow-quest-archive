==Objectives==
Destroy [[Writhing Cocoon]]s to rescue 8 [[Bleak Hills Miner]]s in the [[Bleak Hills Mine]].
* Miners rescued (8)

==Description==
I'm not the only one trapped here in this mine. [[Reez Grimelock|Grimelock]] left all of the other miners to the [[spider]]s, too.

There might be some of them still alive out there. Could you help? I'd appreciate it if not all of my friends died.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find anyone else?

==Completion==
Whew! I'm glad some of us were able to make it out of here.

I'm pretty sure I'm ending up with arachnophobia after this..
