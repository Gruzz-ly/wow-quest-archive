==Objectives==
Investigate the ice cavern.
* Cave [[Ritual Stone (Drustvar)|investigated]] {{co|40.6|62.7|Drustvar}}
* [[Runekeeper Construct]] slain

==Description==
I believe I see more carvings at the entrance to that cave over there. Come, we should see what else was left behind.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Shimmering Quicksilver Drape
|Rowanwood Loop
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Completion==
The carvings could have been Drust propaganda stating he lived, but that voice!{{sic}}<br/>
<Cleardawn's face becomes grim>{{sic}}<br/>
It seems we may have all been mistaken about the ultimate fate of Gorak Tul. I shudder to think what he might be planning now.

==Notes==
Head inside the cave and interact with the obelisk:
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|Another Stele! This one also shows Gorak Tul.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|It is after the battle, but... Tul isn't shown dead. Wounded and broken but not dead!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|Gorak Tul did not survive! Witnesses wrote of his defeat!}}
: ''Gorak Tul's voice is heard.''
:{{text|say|Gorak Tul|Your ancestors were fools... As are you!}}
:{{text|say|Gorak Tul|The Kul Tiran plague will be cleansed and we will retake our lands!}}
: ''To the left, a Runekeeper Construct assembles itself from the ground and attacks.''
:{{text|say|Gorak Tul|But you will not live to see that day. Arise, guardian, and slay these trespassers!}}

Defeat it.

This concludes the "Clear Victory" chapter of [[Drust Do It.]] The [[Drustvar storyline]] continues with [[To Falconhurst!]]
