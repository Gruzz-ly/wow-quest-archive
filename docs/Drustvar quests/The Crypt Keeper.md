==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Brutus Thornton.jpg|The Crypt Keeper|Even in death, he guards the crypts of those with status.}}
Collect Valentine's Key from [[Brutus Thornton]].
* [[Valentine's Key]]

==Description==
I've been keeping my sights on the [[Barrowknoll Cemetery|cemetery]].

There is one [[ghost]] that walks with a purpose, unlike the others.

He is the crypt keeper, the keeper of the keys.

If we want to get to [[Marshal M. Valentine|Valentine's]] body, we will need to go through the ghost first.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
Nothing can stand in our way. Not today.

==Completion==
Only one thing left to do.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Nathanos Blightcaller|A slight inconvenience. Prove that it makes no difference in our plan.}}

==Progression==
{{The Marshal's Grave}}

==Patch changes==
