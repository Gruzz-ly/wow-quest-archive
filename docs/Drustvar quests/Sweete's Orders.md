==Objectives==
Bring Sweete's Orders to [[Lucille Waycrest]] in [[Drustvar]].
* [[Sweete's Orders (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<Tucked into the pages of the captain's logbook is a letter bearing the seal of [[Harlan Sweete|Harlon Sweete]]{{sic}}. 

It looks like these pirates have been ordered by Sweete to cause further disruption to [[House Waycrest]].

Lucille should be notified of this immediately!>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}} (at lvl 120)
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
What have you brought, mainlander?

==Completion==
<Lucille reads the orders.>

So This{{sic}} pirate seeks to destabilize House Waycrest? As if we don't have enough problems already!

Thank you for bringing this to my attention, <class>. It seems that the [[Heartsbane Coven|coven]] might just be the beginning of [[Kul Tiras]]' troubles...

== Notes ==
The Ship's Log is found by the ship's wheel of what is presumably [[Captain Leadfist]]'s ship at [[Chandlery Wharf]] in Drustvar. You'll likely happen to be here for the bonus quest [[Plundering Pirates]], or be after Leadfist himself for [[Adventurer of Drustvar]].

Lucille can be located at different spots depending on how far you are with [[Drust Do It.]] Ideally you'll want her to be at a flight point like [[Arom's Stand]] or [[Watchman's Rise]].

: {{text|say|Harlan Sweete|Captain Leadfist, our benefactor has informed me that House Waycrest is falling into a state of disrepair.}}
: {{text|say|Harlan Sweete|It would be to our advantage to keep it that way.}}
: {{text|say|Harlan Sweete|Gather your best crew and sail for Chandlery Wharf. From there you will pillage, loot, and plunder your way through their lands, depleting their supplies while filling our coffers.}}
: {{text|say|Harlan Sweete|Keep those Waycrest loyalists on their heels, and you will be rewarded.}}
