==Objectives==
Collect 6 [[Mountain Sapling]]s.
* [[Mountain Sapling (item)]] (6)

==Description==
Be wary mainlander, dangers lurk nearby. 

One such creature, [[Greenstalker]], used to be an ally. In his corrupted, mindless rage he nearly killed my brother and I while we were trying to help someone in the wilds. There is something which might help but I must tend to my brother's wounds and cannot obtain the remaining item on my own.

Please go onto the mountainside and pull some saplings out of the earth for me. The plants here are healthy and their roots run deep so they won't come easily.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Did you find the mountain saplings I need?

==Completion==
Thank you for returning quickly. These are new growth, full of potent life-giving energy and a necessary sacrifice to cleanse corruption.

Give me a moment as I create the charm.

==Notes==
Click and uproot [[Mountain Sapling]]s to obtain the item.
