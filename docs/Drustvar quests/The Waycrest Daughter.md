==Objectives==
Meet with [[Constable Henry Framer]] at [[Hangman's Point]] in [[Drustvar]].

==Description==
You seek [[House Waycrest]]? Oh, your timing could not be worse!

I had just received a raven regarding [[Arthur Waycrest|Lord Waycrest's]] daughter, [[Lucille Waycrest|Lucille]], shortly before this... curse came upon us. They apprehended her in [[Fletcher's Hollow]] and are taking her to trial.

They say she is a witch, herself! 

If she's found guilty, she will surely hang! You must make haste to Hangman's Point. With what you've seen here, maybe you can convince them of her innocence.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Can't you see that we're busy here, <class>?

I assume you have a reason for interrupting this trial...

==Notes==
Before leaving Fallhaven, there are a number of side quests and other breadcrumbs available: [[WANTED: Rindlewoe (Alliance)]], [[To Market, To Market]], [[The North Pass Caverns]].

On the way east, keep an eye out for the rare [[Emily Mayville]] at {{co|63.4|40.2|Drustvar}}, and [[Caretaker Allen]] at the [[Barrowknoll Cemetery]] offers [[Seeing Spirits]]. Further east, the rare [[Quillrat Matriarch]] is at {{co|66.6|42.7|Drustvar}} in [[Hawthorne's Plot]].

On approach:
:{{text|say|Constable Henry Framer|Lucille Waycrest! You stand accused of practicing witchcraft and of inflicting a curse upon the village of Fletcher's Hollow.}}
:{{text|say|Constable Henry Framer|You will be hereby tried-}}
:{{text|say|[[Fletcher's Hollow Villager]]|Constable! A stranger approaches!}}
:{{text|say|Constable Henry Framer|Oh, how I loathe interruptions! What is your business here, mainlander?}}
