==Objectives==
Kill 8 Curseformed Familiars in the [[Timbered Strand]].
* [[Curseformed Familiar]] slain (8)

==Description==
We've managed to hold this hill, but the [[wicker]] creatures have moved in to surround us. 

We're not going to be able to move into the town if we don't get them off our flanks. This is where you come in, <class>.

See if you can clear out some of their numbers in the lumber fields. That way, when we move in, we only need to worry about one front.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|80|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How's our flank looking?

==Completion==
Excellent. 

It was starting to feel a bit claustrophobic on this hill.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Save Who We Can]] before heading out.

==Progression==
{{An Airtight Alibi}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
