==Objectives==
Use the [[goblin]] devices in [[Krazzlefrazz Outpost]] to build your foothold in [[Drustvar]].
* [[Supply Hut]] constructed
* [[Boom Button|Engineering Works]] constructed
* [[Plunger|Fishing Hut]] constructed
* [[Wormhole|Inn]] constructed

==Description==
I already did a bunch of the leg-work for settin' up our foothold. All we gotta do is finish deploying all the instant-base [[technology]], and we'll be good to go here in Drustvar.

Why don't you go finish the base building. I'm gonna see if I can salvage any [[wolfercycle]] parts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What?

==Completion==
There we go. That's real nice.

And hey, look! Here come some fresh rocket troops!

==Notes==
* Pick up a [[Kyanite-Laser Embiggener]]
* Find the shrunken Supply Hut, surrounded by [[Foraging Rat]]s. Using the Embiggener on the hut will also enlarge a rat hidden in the tiny shack. Kill the [[Angry Rat]] and [[Giant Rat]].
*The Plunger causes an explosion of a pile with a fish.
*The Boom Button is on an Engineering-Works-In-A-Bomb.

;Wormhole
:<A wormhole stretches out before you. Apparently you should be able to use this to create a building, somehow.>

:{{Gossip|<Reach inside and pull something out.>}}
:''An [[Interdimensional Abomination]] appears.''

Kill it.

Upon completion, a scene starts. A rocket crashes at the outpost.

==Progression==
{{Drustvar Foothold}}

==Patch changes==
