==Objectives==
Return to [[Evelyn Pare]].

==Description==
<The strange woman possessed a letter from someone calling herself "[[Matron Levae]]" which appears to have orders to take the town of [[Fletcher's Hollow]].

This could be the evidence needed to absolve [[Lucille Waycrest]]. Mayor Pare should be interested in seeing this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|98|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It would seem we were mistaken. Miss Waycrest was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

However, this also means that Fletcher's Hollow may be in even more danger.

==Notes==
While in [[Fletcher's Hollow]] for [[The Three Sisters]], the third sister killed will drop [[Levae's Missive]], starting this quest.

On accept:

:{{text|say|Matron Levae|The miners at Fletcher's Hollow have stumbled upon a previously undisturbed ruin hidden deep within the [[Elderstone Mine]].}}
:{{text|say|Matron Levae|The tomb inside may hold powerful relics that could prove useful for our coven's rituals.}}
:{{text|say|Matron Levae|Do what you must to secure the town. I will arrive shortly to investigate the ruins personally.}}

==Progression==
