==Objectives==
Kill 20 Bilefang [[spider]]s in the [[Bleak Hills Mine]].
* Bilefang spiders slain (20)

==Description==
Some terrible old hag unleashed a swarm of these horrible spiders in the mine! I was barely able to make it out alive, but they've got me surrounded!

You can't leave me here! Please kill those things!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Are they all dead?

==Completion==
You... killed them!?

Oh thank you so much! It's been like a living nightmare in here!

==Notes==
In the [[Bleak Hills Mine]] for [[Precious Metals (Alliance)]], [[Elsie Wright]] offers this quest and [[All Wrapped Up (Alliance)]]. Pick them both up before heading out. Kill [[Bilefang Hunter]]s and [[Bilefang Skitterer]]s.

On complete of both:
:{{text|say|Elsie Wright|Oh, thanks again for taking care of those spiders. Not sure how much longer I would've lasted.}}
:{{text|say|Elsie Wright|If it's all the same to you, I'm getting out of here before more of those things come from the mine!}}
