==Objectives==
Follow [[Lucille Waycrest]] toward [[Waycrest Manor]] in [[Upper Corlain]].
*Lucille followed
*[[Marshal Everit Reade]] slain

==Description==
Now is our chance. Waycrest Manor is just up that hill, and hopefully inside we'll find my mother and father. 

If we also manage to find the "Mother" that's leading this horrible coven, then we will make her regret the day she ever set foot in [[Drustvar]].

Are you with me, <class>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]
{{Stub-section}}
*You will be able to choose one from:
**[[Banisher Tunic]]
**[[Banisher Shoulderpads]]

==Completion==
I'm sorry... this is all a bit too much...

Thank you, <class>, for protecting me.  I think I'm going to need a moment...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|Inquisitors! This is our chance to rescue Lord and Lady Waycrest... and put an end to this insufferable coven!}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|Stick close, and do not stop your advance until we've breached the manor gates!}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|For House Waycrest!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Notley|Keep moving, we've got this! Go for the eyes, Winston!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Mace|You've screeched at the wrong woman, witch!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Yorrick|We'll cover the flanks. <name>, stay with Lucille and the Marshal!}}

A cutscene plays:
:{{text|say|Lady Waycrest|That's far enough.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Mother? Is that... you?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Waycrest|I'm so glad you could join us my dear. Your father has missed you so.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|What... What have you done to him?!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Waycrest|Be appreciative, girl! Not only is your father alive and well, but he will soon be lord of all Kul Tiras! Come join us, child...}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|Keep away from her, you heartless witch!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Waycrest|Why Marshal, that's no way to talk to a Lady. I should teach you some manners.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Waycrest|Now, Marshal, be a dear and bring Lucille to my quarters, after you dispose of these pests...}}
:{{text|say|Lady Waycrest|Come, Arthur.}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|As you wish, Mother...}}

Aggro:
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|I... obey...}}

Death:
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|No... this is not... right!}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Fight it, Marshal!}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|Dearest Lucy... I... have failed you...}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|I'm... sorry...}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Marshal, no...}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Mother... what have you done?}}

This completes the "Storming the Manor" chapter of [[Drust Do It.]]. Lucille offers an optional breadcrumb to the dungeon in [[Waycrest Manor: The Fallen Mother]]. Don't forget the other fork of the [[Drustvar storyline]] started with [[Through the Old Roads]].
