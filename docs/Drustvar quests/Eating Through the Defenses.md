==Objectives==
Kill 8 Scavenging Boars in [[Hocking's Plot]].
* [[Scavenging Boar]] slain (8)

==Description==
Not sure why and don't rightly care, but for some reason the coven can't come near my onion field. So long as my crop doesn't give out, I can hole up in here as long as it takes.

Unfortunately, those [[boar]]s got the same idea and now they're eatin' up my harvest! If they keep that up, soon there'll be nothin' keepin' the coven at bay!

If you can do me a favor and thin them out, I'd be happy to let you take some of these onions with you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How's the boar situation?

==Completion==
That oughtta do it for a spell.

Thanks for the help, stranger.

==Progression==
