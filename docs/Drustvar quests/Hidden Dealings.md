==Objectives==
Explore the location marked on the Crude Map.
* Explore the cellar {{co|38.4|53.7|Drustvar}}
* [[Sister Littlefield]] slain

==Description==
<Among her possessions, the witch carried a crudely drawn map of [[Arom's Stand]]. 

A symbol marks a what looks like the entrance to a cellar beneath one of the buildings.

If this location is important to the coven, it might be worth scouting out.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
What's this? A map?

==Completion==
You found their leader? Excellent work, <class>!

The people of Arom's Stand will be safe, now that you've so thoroughly dismantled the coven's machinations here.

==Notes==
In [[Arom's Stand]] for [[Sharp Thinking]], the first [[Unmasked Witch]] discovered by poking Corlain Refugees with the needle will drop a [[Hastily Drawn Map]], which starts this quest.

Head to the cellar and interact with the [[Suspicious Refugee]]:
:Oh... what are you doing here, mainlander?
:Is there something I can help you with?

:{{text|say|Suspicious Refugee|So, you found us out. You must think yourself so clever.}}
:{{text|say|Suspicious Refugee|No matter. Soon your discovery will die with you. Attack, my pets!}}

50%:
:{{text|say|Sister Littlefield|You're strong, but you will fall to the coven like everyone else!}}

Death:
:{{text|say|Sister Littlefield|But... I was promised... greatness...}}
