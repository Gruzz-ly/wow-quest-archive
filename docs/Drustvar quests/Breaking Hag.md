==Objectives==
Kill 15 Briarwood Creatures and Witches.
* [[Briarwood]] Monsters slain  (15)

==Description==
The [[Falconhurst|town]] is overrun! 

The guards have fallen back and what is worse, some of the villagers have been twisted by the [[witch]]es' [[magic]]. They are little more than wretched beasts blindly following orders.

We must release these poor souls and slay the monsters that twisted them!

See what you can do to cut down the numbers of monsters in town!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|20|20|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
We have a little breathing room.

==Completion==
Well done. You've thinned their numbers.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|I'll help reinforce the village's defenses. I will meet you there!}}
: ''She stealths and makes her way down the path.''

Just on the other side of the road, the [[Captive Villager]] starts [[Spell Bound]].

Kill [[Briarwood Hound]]s, [[Briarwood Invader]]s, [[Briarwood Subjugator]]s, [[Briarwood Sentry|Briarwood Sentries]], and [[Briarwood Evoker]]s.

==Progression==
{{Fighting With Fire}}

==Beta version==
{{rfb-section}}
*Named '''A Little Fine Pruning''' during the beta.

;Description
The town is overrun! The guard holding the barricade seem to barely be holding out against these monsters. If the number of invaders was thinned then the defenders would be able to get their footing. See what you can do to cut down the numbers of monsters in town!
