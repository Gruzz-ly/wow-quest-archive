==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Cragg the Stoneshaker.png|Cragg the Stoneshaker|Slay Cragg the Stoneshaker.}}
Slay Cragg the Stoneshaker and free [[Nigel Rifthold]].
* [[Cragg the Stoneshaker]] slain
* Nigel Rifthold freed

==Description==
That's everyone but Nigel.

He's in the big cave! I bet he went in there to look for relics, but now he's tied up!

Would you save him too?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|80}}
* 20,550 [[XP]]
*[["Relic of the Makers"]]

==Progress==
Thanks! Negotiation is a lot harder than [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]]'s book makes it out to be.

==Completion==
Thank you for saving my grandson and his friends.

I'm sure they will make fine explorers when they're adults.

Which will be about the time they are no longer grounded!

==Notes==
As luck would have it, the cave is right by where you're standing. Inside past Cragg the Stoneshaker, Nigel is tied to a spit over a fire.
