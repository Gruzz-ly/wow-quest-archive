==Objectives==
Kill 25 of [[Matron Levae|Matron Levae's]] minions in the [[Elderstone Mine]].
* Heartsbane minions slain (25)

==Description==
If the mine really was their objective, I can only imagine they'd have even more forces in there. 

My men and I may be able to take care of the remnants out here, but if an even bigger force comes out of that mine, we're not going to stand a chance.

While you're hunting down the matron with this wicker contraption, do you think you could... you know... soften them up a bit?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|80|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you go into the mines? What was it like in there?

==Completion==
Wait... you're telling me it was even worse in the mines?

You know what? Just don't tell me about it. So long as you killed... whatever was in there... I think we'll be okay.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Murderous Matron]], then interact with the [[Dormant Ravager]] before heading out.

The ravager has three abilities:
#{{Abilities|Rusty Claws|Swipe twice with your claws, dealing Physical damage to enemies in front|cd=1 sec|notes=Instant|id=250937|icon=ability_druid_ravage}}
#{{Abilities|Reaping Blades|Slash madly with your claws, dealing Physical damage to nearby enemies every 0.5 seconds|cd=10 sec|notes=Channeled|id=250951|icon=ability_whirlwind}}
#{{Abilities|Bloody Leap|range=30-40|Leap to the target location. Deals Physical damage to enemies in front upon landing.|cd=10 sec|notes=Instant|id=250904|icon=ability_heroicleap}}

Valid targets include:
*[[Heartsbane Acolyte]]
*[[Jagged Hound]]
*[[Blighted Essence]]
*[[Thornhound]]
*[[Curseformed Servitor]]
*[[Blighted Fiend]]
*[[Curseformed Thrasher]]

Don't bother counting - there are way more than 25 mobs between the mouth and the end of the cave.
