==Objectives==
Meet Quintin at the cave he mentioned. And be ready for anything to happen.
*Meet [[Quintin Whalgrene|Quintin]] at the Cave
*Witness Quintin's Transformation
*Quintin Slain

==Description==
That appears to be everything. This latest transmutation will be my finest yet. And your prize waits at its completion, apprentice.

But I don't believe this is an appropriate place to test it out. It may draw too much attention.

There's a cave not terribly far from here which would prove to be a more suitable setting for such a test.

Meet me there when you're ready to witness why transmutation is the only branch of alchemy worth learning.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This seems to contain some of Quintin's things.

==Completion==
This bag must have belonged to Quintin. As you rummage through it, you see a slip of paper that appears to be torn.

You grab the parchment and begin reading.
