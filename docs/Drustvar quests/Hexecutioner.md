==Objectives==
Kill 13 witches of the [[Heartsbane Coven]] in Upper Corlain.
* Heartsbane witches slain  (13)

==Description==
It would appear that this is where the coven is training their new acolytes. Our efforts may be for naught if they continue to expand their numbers.

I cannot leave Lucille's side in this place, but you have already shown yourself a formidable combatant. 

Cut them down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Yes, <class>?

==Completion==
The people of Drustvar will sleep more soundly with less witches in the world.

==Notes==
Pick up [[To the Other Side]] and [[Ruinous Rituals]] before heading out.

Just inside, the [[Corlain Citizen's Journal]] starts [[The Fall of Corlain (quest)]].

==Progression==
{{Storming the Manor}}
