==Objectives==
Give the mug to [[Warren Ashton|Master Ashton]].
* Give Master Ashton the potion
* Listen to Master Ashton

==Description==
Now to mix this up. 

<Marten begins to combine the components in a mug>

I'm using some rather strong grog as a base, a drop of chilli extract and a handful of hearthbloom... There!

<Marten hands you a mug>

It will taste worse than it smells, but it will bring Master Ashton to his senses. Please give this mug to him.

==Rewards==

You will receive:
* {{cost|12|44|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
<Ashton stares into the distance, eyes wide, muttering under his breath.>

==Completion==
Oh! I say!

<Ashton shudders and coughs>

A bit less hearthbloom next time, Marten, but that did just the trick. Well done both of you.

==Notes==
Speak with Ashton:
:The things I've seen... The horror... The horror...
