==Objectives==
Meet with [[Marshal Everit Reade|Marshal Reade]] at [[Watchman's Rise]] in [[Drustvar]].

==Description==
Lord and Lady Waycrest lay trapped in [[Waycrest Manor]]. Before we can reach them, however, we must brave through the city of [[Corlain]]... which is firmly in the grasp of the [[Heartsbane]].

Our first course of action should be to set up a forward outpost. Our scouts have found that the tower at Watchman's Rise is only lightly guarded. I recommend we take the tower from them.

This is now your command, Inquisitor. Say the word, and we ride.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Completion==
Good, you've arrived. 

This tower watches over Corlain and the surrounding lands. Apparently it is of little value to the coven, but to us it would serve as a valuable foothold.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|The word is given. Let us ride to Corlain!}}
: ''Reade puts on his helm, then he and Lucille run outside as the inquisitors follow, mount up and ride out the east gate.''
: ''Just outside, Cleardawn is waiting at the foot of the steps.''
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|<Name>, if I may have a word with you? I would like your assistance.}}

She starts [[Through the Old Roads]].

On approach:
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Marshal Reade... are those... your men?}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|Yes. The coven took them. Now they are no more than mindless pawns.}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|We will have no choice but to cut through them.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|I'm... sorry...}}

==Progression==
{{Break on Through}}
