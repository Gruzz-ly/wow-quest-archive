==Objectives==
Defend the villagers as they board the boat in the [[Timbered Strand]].
* Villagers defended

==Description==
We've got a small boat docked right across the way there. If we can get these villagers safely on board, they should be able to make it to [[Fallhaven]] by river.

You're a capable fighter, no doubt. Can I count on you to fend off any attackers while we get them to safety?

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Wickerwoven Sash
|Banisher Belt
|Crone-Seeker's Belt
|Waycrest Militia Girdle

}}

You will also receive:

* 20,560 [[XP]]

{{Rfb-section}}
*[[Wickerwoven Mantle]]
*[[Wickerwoven Vestments]]

==Progress==
We can begin evacuating on your mark.

==Completion==
Thank you, <class>. Those villagers owe you their lives.

Now that they're safe, we can focus on taking back the town.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Evelyn Pare|Alright boys, let's secure this road so we can get these bystanders out of harm's way.}}
:{{text|say|Evelyn Pare|<Class>, take a position with them and hold off any attacks from the town!}}

First wave, three [[Curseformed Familiar]]s:
:{{text|say|Evelyn Pare|Looks like they're on to us. Protect the civilians!}}

Second wave, three [[Grotesque Thrall]]s:
:{{Text|say|Evelyn Pare|More attackers from the town! Hold your position!}}

Final wave, a [[Grotesque Butcher]]:
:{{text|say|Evelyn Pare|Looks like they're sending in the big guns! Brace yourselves, boys!}}

Finally:
:{{text|say|Evelyn Pare|That's the last of the villagers. With any luck, they'll make it to Fallhaven unscathed.}}
