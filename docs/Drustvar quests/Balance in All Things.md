==Objectives==
Speak to Ulfar and cleanse the Filled [[Drust]] Vessel.
* Ride with [[Arthur Tradewind]] (optional)
* Speak to [[Ulfar]]
* [[Ancient Seedling|Begin the ritual]]
* Balance restored

==Description==
The confluence of energies around that vessel is truly disturbing. My skin crawls with the wrongness of it.

We have reached the limit of my ability to help you, <name>.

Go to Ulfar, the High [[Thornspeakers|Thornspeaker]]. Arthur will carry you, if you wish it.

Only he knows enough about these ancient [[magic]]s to undo the corruption that taints your materials.

Go quickly. You do not want to hold that vessel longer than you must.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
*[[Purified Lumber Sample]]

==Progress==
I sense a terrible power emanating from that vessel, <name>.

==Completion==
We will take what we have learned here and see what can be done about the rest of [[Drustvar]].

For now, the Drust Vessel will be of use to you and [[Dorian Atwater|Dorian]].

Give her my regards. She is an ally to the Thornspeakers, always.

==Notes==
After accepting this quest, the [[adventurer]] has the option to speak to [[Arthur Tradewind]]:
:[[Thornspeaker Birchgrove|Birchgrove]] said you might need some help getting up to [[Ulfar]]. [[Ulfar's Den|His lair]] doesn't exactly have signs.
::{{gossip|Can you take me to the High Thornspeaker?}}
:''Arthur changes into [[Travel Form|travel form]].''
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|Sure thing! Hop on!}}
:''The adventurer hops on.''
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|That's a spooky looking bit of magic you've got going on there.}}
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|Makes my back itch.}}
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|Ulfar will know what to do with it. Probably.}}
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|Hold on tight, this ride is about to get a little bumpy.}}
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|You're on an errand from [[Dorian Atwater|Dorian]], right?}}
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|I always wanted to meet her. The [[Thornspeakers]] tell some interesting stories!}}
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|Like how she and Ulfar met. Hah, that's a good one. Yeah.}}
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|... I'm not supposed to talk about that, though.}}
:''The terrain grows steeper as Arthur navigates into the mountains.''
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|Anyway. I keep trying to convince Ulfar that a goat form would be amazing.}}
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|But he always starts talking about "dignity" and I stop listening.}}
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|Luckily for you, I'm as sure-footed as they come.}}
:''Arthur leaps into the air, lands on a rock precariously perched atop a waterfall, then leaps again to the other side.''
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|Just... don't look down.}}
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|Nearly there!}}
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|Tell Ulfar I said hello!}}
:''Having dropped off the adventurer, Arthur turns around and runs back the way he came.''

Speak to [[Ulfar]] in [[Ulfar's Den]]:
:I recognize the power you have brought to me. I felt it in my bark and in my bones before you crested the rise.
:This is old magic. It has been twisted, warped.
:We must act quickly if we are to remain untouched by it.
::{{gossip|Tell me how I can help.}}
:{{text|say|Ulfar|The power you bring here is weighted heavily against life.}}
:''Ulfar places the haunted lumber sample on the ground, with an [[Ancient Seedling]] sitting on top.''
:{{text|say|Ulfar|We must tip the scales.}}

On speaking to Ulfar again:
:Speak to me when you are ready to begin, <name>.

Begin the ritual by interacting with the Ancient Seedling:
:''The adventurer places the Drust Vessel on the lumber with the seedling. Ulfar begins to channel nature magic into the items.''
:{{text|say|Ulfar|This land is generous, and strong, and its heart thrums beneath us!}}
:''A few small [[Drust Manifestation]]s appear, briefly stunning Ulfar.''
:{{text|say|Ulfar|The balance... does not move... easily...}}
:{{text|say|Ulfar|But where there is death, there is also life!}}
:''More manifestations appear.''
:{{text|say|Ulfar|An inescapable cycle, as sure as the sea is vast!}}
:{{text|say|Ulfar|No creature can thwart it for long. Back, foul magic!}}
:''Ulfar finishes channeling; the seed has grown into a young tree, verdant and sparkling with energy.''
:{{text|say|Ulfar|Ahh... the cycle... continues.}}

After completing this quest:
:{{text|say|Ulfar|I have culled the corruption within the vessel, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Ulfar|The Thornspeakers will journey to [[Stormsong Valley|Stormsong]] and begin the work of cleansing your lumber.}}
