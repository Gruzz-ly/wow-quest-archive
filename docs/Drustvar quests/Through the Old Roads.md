==Objectives==
Meet with [[Inquisitor Cleardawn]] at [[Gol Osigr]].

==Description==
[[Lucille Waycrest|Lady Waycrest]] has entrusted me with securing the town of [[Falconhurst]] and the services of [[Warren Ashton|Master Alchemist Ashton]] who lives there. However, I have found out no one has heard from Falconhurst in some time.

The skies above the forest are impassable, so we must travel the old roads through [[Drust]] ruins in the mountains. A small capable party has a better chance to bypass the growing forces of the witches and to help secure Master Alchemist Ashton.

To that end, I ask you to assist me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Completion==
Something has disturbed the spirits here.

The spirits of the departed still fight with constructs and the shambling dead. 

Our goal is Falconhurst, but a quick investigation of this area might help us fight our foes better.
