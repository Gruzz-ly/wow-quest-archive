==Objectives==
Slay 15 Drust Skeletons.
* [[Drust]] [[Skeleton]]s slain (15)

==Description==
<The [[ghost]]ly captain continues to fight as she speaks, once more locked into the heat of battle, unaware the war has been over for centuries.>

What are you doing standing around? We've ground them down to their final warriors and those damnable runic constructs, but the war isn't over yet!

[[Arom Waycrest|Colonel Waycrest]] needs us to hold this line! Kill as many of those Drust as you can and we might see the end of this war, today. Get back out there!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Did you destroy those Drust?

==Completion==
Not bad, marine! We might make a proper soldier out of you yet!

They'll make Colonel Waycrest a Lord for this, I'm sure. Your bravery will be remembered.

==Notes==
On accept:

:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|Well, if we follow orders none of those monsters will ever make it down to Arom's Stand. Let's help.}}

Kill [[Fallen Defender]]s and [[Drust Evoker]]s.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|She's right, they did make Arom Waycrest a Lord for his victory here.}}
