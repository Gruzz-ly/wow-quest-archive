==Objectives==
Slay [[Bramblethorn]] and retrieve Lord Sharptooth.
* [[Lord Sharptooth]] rescued {{co|24.8|68.7|Drustvar}}

==Description==
I was playing with Lord and Lady Sharptooth when Papa made me come with him. I dropped poor Lord Sharptooth and one of those big mean monsters grabbed him! 

Papa said he'd try to get him back but he's been gone a long time. I think he got busy. Mama and all the adults are busy doing stuff for Mayor Royston.

Lady Sharptooth and I are really sad. Can you beat up that mean monster and save my dino?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Did you find Lord Sharptooth? I think one of the really big monsters has him.

==Completion==
Yay! Oh. Y-you saw someone? My papa?

<Lynn hugs her toy and sniffs>

I haven't seen my Mama in awhile. I hope she's okay.
