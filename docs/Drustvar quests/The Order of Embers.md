==Objectives==
Take the Tome of Silver and Ash in [[Gol Var]].
* [[Tome of Silver and Ash]]

==Description==
The [[Order of Embers]] was the name given to those who took up these arms against the [[Drust]]. Using the tools and methods uncovered by the scholars, they were able to counter the Drust's [[magic]], and ensure our victory in the war.

If the [[Heartsbane Coven|coven]] wants to use the Drust's magic against us, then we'll use the order's weapons against them.

The knowledge of the order rests here, but without a hand to wield it, it will do us no good. 

Will you be that hand, <class>? Will you revive the Order of Embers?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* [[Small Azerite Shard]] (100x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* [[Tome of Silver and Ash (spell)]]
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +3500 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
What say you?

==Completion==
You do great honor to my family, <class>.  The most noble of Waycrests were once inquisitors of the order.

It is only fitting that it is you who takes up its mantle now.

==Notes==

Interact with the [[Tome of Silver and Ash]] on the table beside her and turn it in.

This completes "The Order of Embers" chapter of [[Drust Do It.]] The [[Drustvar storyline]] continues with [[Take the High Road]].
