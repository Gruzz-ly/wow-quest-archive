==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Bloodshed Compendium]] further to being your trial.

* Turn the pages
* Look through the entire book
* Ask [[Kronah]] about the book
* Begin writing in the book
* [[Sanguine Ink]] (12)
* Complete the ritual

==Description==
As you open the book, you stare at a blank page, waiting for something to happen.

Instinctively you flip to the next page only to find it blank as well. Perhaps your trial awaits you further into the book?

==Rewards==
You will learn how to create: [[Blood Contract: Bloodshed]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I trust you to be careful inside the Bloodshed Compendium. I don't want to find any ripped pages from that weapon you wield.

==Completion==
You've done well, young one. I recall a [[gnome]] not too long ago completing that trial as well.

Her story was quite the read. But between you and me, gnomes smell like porridge.

<Kronah looks off into the distance, lost in thought for a moment.>

But you are now a bearer of the Bloodshed Contract and one step closer to your final prize.

<Kronah quirks a grin at you and goes back about her business.>

==Notes==
Kill the [[Sanguine Sludge]] to obtain [[Sanguine Ink]].

;Bloodshed Compendium
:The pages on the book appear to be blank.

:{{Gossip|Turn a few more pages.}}

::The next several pages also appear to be blank.

::{{Gossip|Thumb through the entire book.}}

:::Looking through the entire book, every page appears to be empty. Frustrated, you glance over at Kronah and wonder if she knows the trick to this trial.

;Ask Kronah
:{{Gossip|Why is the Bloodshed Compendium blank?}}

::{{Text|say|Kronah|Well that's simple, dear. Your own story has to be written into the book.}}
::{{Text|say|Kronah|Just pull out one of your pens and begin writing. Don't worry, the book will do the rest.}}
::{{Text|say|Kronah|I look forward to reading of the events you encounter.}}

;Write in book
:{{Gossip|Begin writing in the book.}}
::''A cutscene plays.''
::As my hand got close to the book, it began to write all on its own...
::"At the moment the hero's pen touched the empty parchment, something began to stir within the pages.
::<He/She> could feel <his/her> very essence being pulled into the book.
::The hero's vision began to fade...
::''Cutscene ends here.''
::{{Text|bossemote|...and as it refocused <he/she> found <himself/herself> in [[The Prison of Ink|a strange chamber]].}}
::{{Text|bossemote|Suddenly a voice filled the hero's mind, and in a lyrical tone it recited a poem,}}
::{{Text|bossemote|"What spills from pen, and spills from vein}}

::{{Text|bossemote|Intermingled here within.}}

::{{Text|bossemote|Beware the jet, collect the crimson,}}

::{{Text|bossemote|And your blood-bound slayer shall be arisen."}}

;Attempt locked door
:{{Text|bossemote|The hero tried to open one of the doors, but it wouldn't budge. <He/She>'d have to press on through the creatures before <him/her>.}}

;After attacking several [[Viscous Sludge]]s
:{{Text|bossemote|The viscous ones were beginning to be quite the nuisance for the hero.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|The red sludges seem to have what the hero was looking for, and it wouldn't be too long till she had enough.}}

;Enter small chamber
:{{Text|bossemote|As the hero entered the chamber, [[Sanguine Mass|a larger version]] of the creatures <he/she>'d been fighting stood before <him/her>. Perhaps this was the trial <he/she> was here to complete?}}

;Skeletal Remains
:{{Text|bossemote|A skeleton on the floor reminded the hero of their own mortality. <He/She> wondered if others had failed this trial before.}}

;All sanguine ink collected
:{{Text|bossemote|Once enough ink had been collected, the hero felt a strange pull towards the back of the prison.}}

;Enter larger chamber
:{{Text|bossemote|As the hero stepped into the room, <he/she> saw four runes spread out on the floor. This must be what the ink was for.}}

;All Cryptic Runes activated
:''Another cutscene plays.''
:The ritual complete, a creature coalesced before the hero.
:It finished forming and cried out with its newfound life.
:It caught the hero's eye and peered inside <his/her> mind, filling it with knowledge <he/she> needed to summon it.
:<His/Her> trial complete, the hero finished the last stroke of <his/her> story and returned to the material realm.
:''Cutscene ends.''
