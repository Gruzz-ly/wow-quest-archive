==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Gorak Tul.jpg|Gorak Tul|Confront Gorak Tul}}
Confront Gorak Tul.
* [[Gorak Tul]] slain
* Escape the Chamber

==Description==
I've been watching a lot of activity going on at the ruins at the base of the massive tree by the lake. What [[Warren Ashton|Master Ashton]] reported is accurate - something important is going on down there. 

We've disrupted their rituals but I worry we might have been too late.

We need to go over there. If there is anything remaining, we must destroy it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
We must confront Gorak Tul.

==Completion==
We've wounded him or he wouldn't have retreated as he did. Our victory won't last long unless we do something about his army.

==Notes==
On accept, the NPCs join the party. Run south to the tree with the door in it to find [[Gol Inath]]:
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|There! A door in the tree!}}
:{{text|say|Marten Webb|Is no one going to mention that massive wicker golem? Because I feel it should be mentioned.}}
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|One crisis at a time, my boy!}}

Enter the tree and a cutscene plays: As the adventurer and party run down further into the tree, Gorak Tul steps out of the darkness.

On the other side of the cutscene, start attack him. Get him to 35%, he stuns everybody with Drust King's Might and escapes:
:{{text|say|Gorak Tul|Enough!}}
:{{text|say|Gorak Tul|Interlopers! You meddle in affairs beyond your ken.}}
:{{text|say|Gorak Tul|You cannot stop me from reclaiming what is mine!}}

The tree starts caving in, so it's time to get out of the tree!

On exiting the tree, another cutscene, as all of the wicker statues awaken! Except the [[Crimsonwood Demolisher]].

==Progression==
{{Stick It To 'Em!}}
