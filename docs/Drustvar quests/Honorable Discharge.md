==Objectives==
Dismiss 10 Weary Spirits from the battlefield.
* [[Weary Spirit]] released (10)

==Description==
Some of the spirits on the battlefield are too weary to go on. These were brave [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tirans]]. They have more than earned their rest but their sense of duty holds them here.

Order the most weary spirits off the field of battle. Hopefully they will be convinced to rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Have you convinced the spirits they are dismissed?

==Completion==
It is good their spirits returned to their final rest once more. May they never be disturbed again.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Pieces of History]] before heading out.

Just south along the road, [[Captain Lilian Nottley]] starts [[Clear Victory]].

==Progression==
{{Clear Victory}}
