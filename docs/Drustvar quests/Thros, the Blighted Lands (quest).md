Find [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]] in [[Thros, the Blighted Lands]].
* Jaina freed

==Description==
The Blighted Lands... 

If the legends are true then inside we will witness suffering and torment the likes of which we have never known...

...but if that is what I must endure to right what I have wronged, then I will cross that threshold gladly.

Will you join me, <class>?

==Rewards==

You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
*[[Radiant Azerite Core]] (750x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 22,310 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm with you, champion.

==Completion==
Words cannot express the debt I owe you for helping return my daughter to me, but unfortunately the traitor [[Priscilla Ashvane|Ashvane]] has left us no time for celebration.

We must act.

==Notes==
[[File:VZ-Thros, the Blighted Lands.jpg|thumb|Map of the "Thros, the Blighted Lands" scenario.]]
Take the [[Portal to the Blighted Lands]] to enter the "Thros, the Blighted Lands" scenario:

===Stage 1: The Blighted Lands===
*''Follow Katherine into Thros, the Blighted Lands.''
*Follow Katherine

A vision of Jaina as a child appears:
:{{text|say|Jaina|It's... all my fault...}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Jaina?!}}
:{{text|say|Jaina|No! Stay away!}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Jaina, wait!}}

===Stage 2: Chasing Shadows===
*''Jaina has fled deeper into the Blighted Lands. Follow her.''
*Follow Jaina {{co|23.7|55.7|Thros, the Blighted Lands}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|<Name>, we must follow her!}}

On the way:
: ''You come across several [[Kul Tiran Captive]]s, victims of the [[Heartsbane Coven]], hanging from their wrists against large runestones.''
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Poor souls... no one should endure this. After we save Jaina, we must find a way to come back for them.}}

: ''Passing the stones, a [[Servant of Thros]] appears on the path and attacks.''
:{{text|yell|Servant of Thros|Proudmoore's daughter is ours, interloper!}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Not if I have anything to say about it!}}

The Servant of Thros defeated:
:{{text|yell|Servant of Thros|Thros... will consume you...}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Jaina is just ahead. We must hurry!}}

Approach Jaina again:
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|It's alright, dear...}}
:{{text|say|Jaina|No! You can't help me! No one can help me!}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Wait!}}
:''Jaina splits into three mirror images, which run in different directions before disappearing. Katherine sighs at the setback.''
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|When Jaina was a child, she used to hide whenever she was frightened or upset.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|I always found her then... and I will not fail her now.}}

===Stage 3: Hide and Seek===
*''Find Jaina's mirror images, which have hidden throughout the Blighted Lands.''
*Images of Jaina found
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Lead the way, <name>.}}

Off to the west, at {{co|21.4|56.5|Thros, the Blighted Lands}} Jaina is surrounded by [[Theramore Citizen (Thros)|Theramore Citizens]]:
:{{text|say|Theramore Citizen|You left us to die!}}
:{{text|say|Theramore Citizen|You could have stopped [[Garrosh Hellscream|him]]! You could have saved us!}}
:{{text|say|Jaina|I failed them... all of them...}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|No! Don't listen to them, Jaina!}}
:{{text|yell|Theramore Citizen|You will never take our prize!}}

They turn hostile. Defeat them, then interact with Jaina:
: ''Katherine walks up and kneels by the image to speak to it then returns to your side.''
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Jaina... you were... are... the pride of Kul Tiras. Her power, and her fury...}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|...but even the strongest of us can't save everyone.}}
: ''Interacted with, the image vanishes. Katherine turns to you.''
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|She's gone. The child was only a reflection... an echo of Jaina's suffering.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|We must continue our search.}}

If you cross {{co|24.21|54.16|Thros, the Blighted Lands}} on the way north, you will find the corpses of five Kul Tiran Captives on the road.
: {{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Clearly the Drust have no interest in keeping their prisoners alive. We cannot let this fate befall Jaina.}}

To the north, at {{co|25.2|50.1|Thros, the Blighted Lands}} [[Rhonin]] and two [[Kirin Tor Invoker (Thros)|Kirin Tor Invokers]] are dressing Jaina down:
:{{text|say|Rhonin|You let your personal biases taint the Kirin Tor!}}
:{{text|say|Rhonin|I was a fool to think you could be our leader!}}
:{{text|say|Jaina|But... they lied to me...}}

Defeat them:
:{{text|yell|Rhonin|Your screams will be unending!}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|He's not real, Jaina! None of this is!}}
:{{text|say|[[Blighted Deciever]]{{sic}}|You will... wish for death...}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|My dearest Jaina... reason alone cannot dictate all of your choices.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|If you abandon your feelings, only an empty darkness will remain.}}

Interact with the echo:
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Another illusion? Jaina must still be trapped nearby.}}
:{{text|say|Daelin Proudmoore|You sided with mongrels over your own flesh and blood!}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|That voice... Daelin?!}}
: ''She turns to you.''
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|No. It must be another of those creatures tormenting Jaina. Hurry!}}

To the east, at {{co|26.2|52.5|Thros, the Blighted Lands}}in a hollow, [[Varian Wrynn|King Varian Wrynn]] is staring Jaina down:
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|[[The Battle For The Undercity|You were at my side]] in the [[Undercity]]. We had them cornered! Justice was within my grasp!}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|I could have ended them all! [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]]... [[Thrall]]... Think what our world could have been without them and their twisted [[Horde]]!}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|But you... You stayed my blade. How many Alliance soldiers died that day? And in all the battles that followed?}}
:{{text|say|Jaina|All because of me...}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Get away from her!}}
:{{text|yell|King Varian Wrynn|She belongs to [[Gorak Tul]]!}}

Defeat the deceiver:
:{{text|say|Blighted Deciever|We will not be denied... our vengeance...}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Seeking an end to bloodshed is a noble pursuit, Jaina.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|I wish your father could have learned that lesson.}}

Interact with Jaina to continue.

===Stage 4: Into the Mirror===
*''Follow Daelin's voice to locate Jaina's true location.''
*Find the real Jaina {{co|19.4|53.7|Thros, the Blighted Lands}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|My daughter is here somewhere. Hiding. Suffering.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|We will find her... and free her from this forsaken place.}}

Head west to find Jaina staring at Daelin Proudmoore:
:{{text|say|Daelin Proudmoore|You stood and watched as those animals cut me down. What has your betrayal earned you?}}
:{{text|say|Jaina|Father... please...}}
:{{text|say|Daelin Proudmoore|They took your father... betrayed your king... and you did nothing! Will you abandon all your allies to the Horde?}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Enough! Show us your true form, monster!}}
:{{text|yell|Daelin Proudmoore|Insolent fools! She is broken beyond your reach!}}

Defeat it:
:{{text|yell|Daelin Proudmoore|You will be next!}}
:{{text|say|Blighted Deciever|You are... too late...}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Jaina? Is it really you?}}

Interact with her and a [[Battle for Azeroth in-game cinematics|cinematic]] plays, the Realm of Torment:
{{#ev:youtube|NDj2aaxixxo}}

:{{text|bossemote|Katherine Proudmoore|There you are...}}
:''Jaina as a child is turned away, sitting on a ruined part of a building, head in her hands and crying.''
:{{text|bossemote|Young Jaina|I did everything wrong.}}
:''Katherine gently reaches out to touch Jaina, but just before her hand does so, the girl's body disperses like smoke. Shocked, Katherine looks around as the scenery surrounding her disappears into black and her body is rocked by the entry into Jaina's Realm of Torment. She hears a man's voice.''
:{{text|bossemote|Arthas Menethil|We're too late.}}
:''A brief portion of "[[O Thanagor]]" plays as Katherine turns to her left and sees Arthas standing on a small rise, staring off into the distance before looking back.''
:{{text|bossemote|Arthas Menethil|This entire city [[Culling of Stratholme|must be purged]].}}
:{{text|bossemote|Arthas Menethil|Jaina?}}
:''Katherine follows Arthas's gaze to her right and sees Jaina, looking as she does today, but re-enacting her actions from her memories.''
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|I'm sorry Arthas. I can't watch you do this.}}
:''Jaina turns and leaves, her thoughts echoing.''
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|(thinking) We should have stopped him. He never would have turned. He'd still be alive.}}
:''As Katherine tries reaching out towards Jaina and falls short, a familiar voice is heard.''
:{{text|bossemote|Daelin Proudmoore|You have always been naive, my daughter.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Katherine Proudmoore|Daelin?}}
:''Katherine turns in the direction of her husband's voice and sees the distressed Jaina and the hardened Daelin having an argument by a fountain, from Daelin's [[Old Hatreds (WC3 Orc)|first arrival on Theramore Isle]].''
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|I won't let you do it, father!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|(thinking) I should have tried harder.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|You don't understand!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Daelin Proudmoore|I understand more than you suspect, my dear.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|(thinking) I wasn't strong enough.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Daelin Proudmoore|Perhaps in time, you will too.}}
:''Daelin turns away to his left, barking an order.''
:{{text|bossemote|Daelin Proudmoore|[[Rexxar|Seize]] [[Rokhan|them]] [[Chen Stormstout|all]]!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|(thinking) I should have made him listen.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|Father, no!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|(thinking) Forgive me.}}
: ''The truth sadly dawns on Katherine's face as she realizes the circumstances of Daelin's death.''
:{{text|bossemote|Katherine Proudmoore|You couldn't save him... from himself.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Daelin Proudmoore|Do you really think you can cast aside your guilt so easily?}}
:''Daelin's voice roaring around her, Katherine grimaces and clutches her head, gritting her teeth at Jaina's scream. As the scream fades and is replaced with a heart beating slowly, Katherine sees Jaina from behind on her knees, cradling Daelin's dying body in her lap as she cries. His heartbeat slows to a stop.''
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|No. Father... why wouldn't you listen.}}
: ''Placing her hand over Daelin's chest, Jaina's thumb and forefinger brush the Proudmoore pendant still hanging around his neck.''
:{{text|bossemote|Priscilla Ashvane|Katherine...}}
:''Katherine turns her attention left to Jaina's arrival in Kul Tiras.''
:{{text|bossemote|Priscilla Ashvane|Enforce our laws. The punishment for treason... is death.}}
: ''Memory Katherine walks forward revealing Katherine in the background, watching the scene with regret.''
:{{text|bossemote|Katherine Proudmoore|Do you accept the judgment of your homeland?}}
:''Behind Jaina stands many of those she has lost, including [[Rhonin]], [[Kinndy Sparkshine]], [[Varian Wrynn]], [[Daelin Proudmoore]], and [[Arthas Menethil]].''
:{{text|bossemote|Jaina Proudmoore|I accept your judgment... mother.}}
:''Determined, Katherine steps forward and swipes away her memory self to smoke, then reaches out and lifts Jaina's chin. She jerks a little at the contact, her eyes fluttering as if half-awake.''
:{{text|bossemote|Katherine Proudmoore|My daughter. Forgive me.}}
:''Blinking, Jaina opens her eyes at Katherine's voice full of love and looks up, surprised to see her mother in front of her.''
:{{text|bossemote|Katherine Proudmoore|Forgive your father.}}
:''Jaina turns to look as the men and women behind her fade away, with the exception of Daelin, but for a moment.''
:{{text|bossemote|Katherine Proudmoore|And... forgive yourself.}}
:''Katherine reaches back out and caressing her face, turns Jaina back to face her. The color returning to her, Jaina leans her cheek into Katherine's hand as the scene fades to white. A younger Katherine can be heard calling Jaina back in her youth.''
:{{text|bossemote|Katherine Proudmoore|Come topside, sweetheart.}}
:''Awakened from her memories, the real Jaina sits where her child self was, back in Thros, Katherine's hand on her pauldron. Raising her head and opening her eyes, she turns to the weight on her shoulder to see her mother, who caresses her face once more before they lean into each other and tightly embrace.''

===Final Stage: Facing Fate===
:''Defeat Gorak Tul and escape from the Blighted Lands.''
*Escape the Blighted Lands
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Come, daughter. We'll find our way out of here.}}
: ''Behind Katherine just outside the circle of stones, Gorak Tul appears!''
:{{text|yell|Gorak Tul|None of you will escape!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Mother, look out!}}
: ''Tul blasts Katherine, knocking her to the ground.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Mother!}}
: ''Jaina teleports in between Katherine and Tul and AOE blasts him back. She snarls her response.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|You challenged the wrong family, fiend!}}
: ''Tul attacks''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|To arms, <name>!}}
:{{text|yell|Gorak Tul|Thros will consume you all! At last I will claim vengeance!}}

Defeat Gorak Tul:
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|My people defeated your kind once, monster. We will do so again!}}
: ''Tul collapses.''
:{{text|say|Gorak Tul|Your hollow victory... means nothing...}}
:{{text|say|Gorak Tul|The Drust... will never... relent...}}
: ''Dying with his last breath, Tul's corpse fades away. Jaina responds firmly.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|And Kul Tiras will never yield.}}
: ''Jaina teleports back to Katherine, who is kneeling.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Mother! Are you alright?}}
: ''They stand up together. Katherine just sounds a bit winded.''
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Yes... I will be fine.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|We'd better go before more of those... things... arrive.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|It will be a relief to put this place behind me.}}
: ''She turns to you.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|<Name>, shall we?}}

Speak with Jaina:
:I can teleport us out of here when you are ready, <class>. 
:Please hurry, I wish to be rid of this place.
{{gossip|I'm ready to leave.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Very well. Come, mother. Time to go home.}}
:''Jaina teleports herself, her mother, and the adventurer out of Thros.''

===Finale===
:''In front of Proudmoore Keep where they last saw each other, the two Proudmoores stop for a moment to gather themselves.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|It is good to feel the sea air. Thank you, <name>. Without your intervention, I may never have felt it again...}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Now, let me see if I can do this properly this time... Welcome home, daughter.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Mother... I--}}
:''[[Taelia]] flies in on [[Galeheart]] and hurriedly dismounts.''
:{{text|say|Taelia|Lord Admiral! Ships on the horizon! They're flying [[House Ashvane|Ashvane colors]]!}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Priscilla has come back for my city...}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|<Name>! It seems I am in need of your aid once more.}}
