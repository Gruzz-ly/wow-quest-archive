==Objectives==
Burn the Wicker Man in [[Autumnvale]].
*Follow [[Edwin Maldus]]
*[[Wicker Man]] burned

==Description==
I appreciate you saving me again, but we should do something to prevent this from happening to anyone else.

So long as that Wicker Man stands, it will attract more like [[Lord Autumnvale|Autumnvale]] to it.

We should destroy it! Are you with me?

*{{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
The Wicker Man must be destroyed!

==Completion==
Well I've certainly learned my lesson.

Thank you, friend. I will return to Boralus with my parents now.  

Here, take this for your troubles.
