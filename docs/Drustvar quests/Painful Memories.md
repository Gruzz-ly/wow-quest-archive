==Objectives==
Search the [[Forgotten Bones]] for Treadward's Ring in [[Whitegrove Chapel]].
*[[Treadward's Ring]] found

==Description==
A terrible thing happened in this place, and it has doomed me to an eternity of walking these grounds.

All I remember is that [[Lucille Waycrest|Lucille]] and I were to be wed, but instead I met my end.

If you have an ounce of sympathy in your heart, then I beg you to help me. Find out what happened that night, so I might leave here.

I know my strongest memories are tied to the ring I bore for Lucy that day. Find it among my bones, and maybe it will lead you to the answer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Completion==
Welcome, kind sir!

The ceremony should begin as soon as the good Lord Waycrest arrives.

==Progression==
