==Objectives==
Search the ruins for information about the [[Drust]].
* [[First Carved Stone|First Stone]] examined {{co|38.5|58.4|Drustvar}}
* [[Second Carved Stone|Second Stone]] examined {{co|36.6|58.0|Drustvar}}
* [[Third Carved Stone|Third Stone]] examined {{co|39.3|61.1|Drustvar}}
* [[Fourth Carved Stone|Fourth Stone]] examined {{co|37.8|64.6|Drustvar}}
* [[Fifth Carved Stone|Fifth Stone]] examined {{co|36.5|61.3|Drustvar}}

==Description==
There is an opportunity here.

Learning more about the [[Drust]] can not only help us understand the texts that [[Lucille Waycrest|Lady Lucille]] found, we might be able to discover greater details about how they and their constructs were finally defeated. Filling in the gaps of history could be key to victory now.

This was one of their settlements before it became the place of their final defeat. Let's look for clues in the ruins.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Interesting.... Very interesting.

==Completion==
[[Gorak Tul]]'s death shattered his army! The carvings here all show that, but now I wonder... Did Gorak Tul actually die?

==Notes==
Pick up [[Honorable Discharge]] before heading out.

Just south along the road, [[Captain Lilian Nottley]] starts [[Clear Victory]].

First:
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|It seems as if the Kul Tirans in this stele are... Civillians? Sailors and some farmers?}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|Wait, this depicts one of the early Kul Tiran settlements. One of the lost settlements.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|When we landed here we tried peace, but the Drust went to war immediately. Only a few tolerated new neighbors.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|But this... They've glorified the slaughter! The Kul Tirans don't even have weapons!}}

Second:
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|It's a victory over another Kul Tiran settlement. The large figure in the center is their legendary leader, I think.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|Interesting that we don't see any of their constructs taking the field.}}

Third:
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|HA! And here we are fighting back!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|Even their leader is withdrawing from the field.}}

Fourth:
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|This is clearly Gorak Tul, their greatest leader. Ah! He's leading a ritual to create the stone constructs!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|The constructs began to take the field.  He'd run out of living warriors so he created a new army. But what empowered the stones?}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|Interesting. I hadn't realized the constructs came later as part of his desperation to win.}}

Fifth:
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|This isn't Drust. It's a Kul Tiran carving over a Drust Monolith.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|That's Lord Arom Waycrest when he was just a Colonel leading the final assault. And there... That is Gorak Tul being stabbed by Waycrest.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|Histories of this event always say Lord Arom killed Gorak Tul and his army fell thereafter. But here you can see all his constructs shattering as he's stabbed and his power broken. There was some connection.}}

==Progression==
{{Clear Victory}}
