==Objectives==
Collect a Juicy Onion from [[Hawthorne's Plot]] near [[Hangman's Point]].
* [[Juicy Onion]]

==Description==
The first test should be simple enough. While I may not do so often, I am certainly capable of crying.

Though to be honest, I've never had to cry on cue.

Maybe you could help with that, though. Nearby there is an onion field that belonged to one of the local farmers. It's abandoned, and most of it is dried up by now, but you might be able to find one onion ripe enough in there to cause some tears.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|80|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you had any luck at the onion field?

==Completion==
Great, you found one! I was worried that there wouldn't be much left growing on that farm. 

The people of [[Drustvar]] could learn a thing or two from that hardy onion.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Once Bitten, Twice Shy (quest)]] and [[Harmful If Swallowed]] before heading out.

First head to the tent and pick up the Bug-Catching Jar next to [[Auntie Amanda Hale]], then start killing saurolisk, picking up Hovering Bloodflies, and digging [[Onion]]s out of the ground at [[Hawthorne's Plot]] until a sufficiently pungent one is found.

At Hawthorne's Plot, [[Adela Hawthorne]] offers the optional side quest [[Quill or Be Quilled]]. Also, if players haven't killed her already, the rare [[Quillrat Matriarch]] is inside the tent.

==Progression==
{{The Burden of Proof}}
