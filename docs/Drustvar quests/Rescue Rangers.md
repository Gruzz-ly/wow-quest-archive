==Objectives==
Save 10 injured Thornspeakers, rangers and pets.
* Injured healed (10)

==Description==
We're barely holding off those monsters here. If it hadn't been for the [[Thornspeakers]], we'd surely be dead. I was worried Rebecca hadn't made it!

You've brought [[Rebecca Hale|Rebecca's]] supplies just in time. We have many injured out in the field, Thornspeaker, [[ranger]] and companion alike. I need help hold the line here. Go into the ruins and heal as many of the wounded as you can!
