==Objectives==
Collect 5 Intact Venom Glands from the [[Shallows Saurolisk]]s near [[Hangman's Point]].
* [[Intact Venom Gland]] (5)

==Description==
This last test I am not looking forward to, but it is certainly better than being set on fire. 

They say that a witch can't get sick. We will prove to them that I can.

A venom comes from the [[saurolisk]]s nearby that is used by our healers when a child swallows something they shouldn't. When ingested, it will make you immediately ill, emptying the contents of the stomach.

You'll need several of their venom glands to get enough venom for an appropriate dose. Removing them intact may prove difficult.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|80|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is the deed done?

==Completion==
Good. This toxin should have the... desired effect.

Gah, I can't believe I'm going to go through with this.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Pungent Solution]] and [[Once Bitten, Twice Shy (quest)]] before heading out.

First head to the tent and pick up the Bug-Catching Jar next to [[Auntie Amanda Hale]], then start killing saurolisk, picking up Hovering Bloodflies, and digging Onions out of the ground at [[Hawthorne's Plot]] until a sufficiently pungent one is found.

At Hawthorne's Plot, [[Adela Hawthorne]] offers the optional side quest [[Quill or Be Quilled]]. Also, if players haven't killed her already, the rare [[Quillrat Matriarch]] is inside the tent.

==Progression==
{{The Burden of Proof}}
