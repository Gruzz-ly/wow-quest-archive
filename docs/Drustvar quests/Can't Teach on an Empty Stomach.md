==Objectives==
Collect 7 Lane Snapper for [[Xun Xun Sweetflower]]. Lane Snapper can be fished from the ocean or purchased from the [[Auction House]].
* [[Lane Snapper]] (7)

==Description==
I would love to teach you, but it's so hard for me to concentrate right now. I haven't eaten anything all day, so it's all I can think about.

However, if a helpful adventurer were to fish up some lane snapper from the ocean just behind me, I would owe them a{{sic}} something in return. Perhaps something valuable, such as advice in regards to effectively picking the notorious [[Winter's Kiss|winter's kiss]].

If you don't feel like [[fishing]], you could just buy some on the auction house, I don't mind.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Battle for Azeroth|Herbalism Technique: Winter's Kiss (Rank 2)]]

==Progress==
Oh, do you have something for me?

==Completion==
You brought me fresh fish? What a wonderful surprise! Now I can focus on teaching an eager pupil.

The important thing to know when trying to pick winter's kiss is that any exposure to heat before it is harvested can cause the flower to wilt.

To prevent that from happening, bury your hands in the snow right before you harvest it. By reducing the temperature of your hands before touching the plant, you can usually get a couple extra petals without issue.

Good luck!
