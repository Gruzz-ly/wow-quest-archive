==Objectives==
Escort [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] and [[Eitrigg]] on [[Gallywix's War Trike]].

If you become separated from Gallywix and Eitrigg, you can find them at [[Anyport]].
* Board Gallywix's trike and search for a [[Bilgewater Azerite Drudge|goblin scout]]
* [[Wildwood Slaverer|Search deeper into the woods]]
* Find another goblin scout
* Find the final goblin scout

==Description==
This was supposed to be a covert operation. Unfortunately, our Trade Prince insisted on coming along... with the loudest, most conspicuous vehicle the [[Horde]] has ever conceived.

At least you're here with me, <name>.

Let's get going, then. We know next to nothing about the [[Drustvar]] territory. It's time to do some recon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let's get this over with.

==Completion==
I'm getting a bad feeling about these woods.

Wait a minute... what is THAT!?

:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Eitrigg... are you afraid of witches?}}
:{{Text|say|Eitrigg|NO! I mean, no. I just... don't like them, that's all.}}
