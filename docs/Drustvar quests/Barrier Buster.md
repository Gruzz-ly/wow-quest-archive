==Objectives==
Collect 5 Blasting Powder from [[Pikeman's Ridge]] and bring them to [[Inquisitor Sterntide]] outside the gate into [[Upper Corlain]].
* [[Blasting Powder]] (5)

==Description==
Oy, <name>! I think I might have a solution te that pesky barrier keepin ye out of [[Corlain]] proper! 

I took the silver we had left 'ere an' doctored up one o' these cannonballs. The walls surroundin' Corlain are festooned with defensive cannons. Get one pointed at the gate, ye can send this beauty right into the barrier!

Ye'll need a hefty pinch of powder te get this thing movin', though - it's a bit on the heavy side. Ye can likely find some in the camp outside the walls.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
I don't think these guys will be needin' this cannon anymore.

==Completion==
Quite a bit of powder ya got there.

Careful ya don't take the whole wall down.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Angus Ballaster|Oh, an' mainlander... the Marshal asked that ye see him before ye head to the camp.}}
:{{text|say|Angus Ballaster|Somethin' about one o' his former guardsmen.}}

Reade starts [[A Traitor's Death]]. Pick it up before heading out.

On approach of Sterntide:
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Sterntide|The Marshal sent me to find a cannon for ya.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Sterntide|Looks like this one's free.}}

==Progression==
{{Break on Through}}
