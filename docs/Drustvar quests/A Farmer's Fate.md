==Objectives==
Empower the Everliving Branch.
* [[Mark of Ash]]
* [[Mark of Yew]]
* [[Mark of Alder]]

==Description==
[[Jakob Teller|Old Jakob]] here was one of the few folks who were never wary of us. I have, on occasion, even helped him around his [[farm]] in return for supplies. It is an injustice just to ignore his plight even amidst our own problems.

The corruption which holds him seems to be early in form. I believe I can cleanse it.

Take this branch, and bring it to the three shrines around the [[Ashenwood]]. That should allow it to gather enough energy for the ritual.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Completion==
The wood remembers, and guides us. This should be enough power to help this [[farmer]].

==Progression==
#[[Those Who Remain]]
#[[A Farmer's Fate]]
#[[Lost in the Woods]]

==Patch changes==
