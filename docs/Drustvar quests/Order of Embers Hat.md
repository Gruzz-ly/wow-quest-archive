{{Book|Order of Embers Hat
|content=
<The leather of this hat is cracked and petrified with age, but it still remains the customary shape of the [[Order of Embers]]. Vines have been embossed onto the band of this cap and a number of small metal markers, humble awards for brave and meritorious service, can be found amid the scrolling artwork. The name of the original owner is lost to time, but whoever they were, they served [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiras]] well.

Original [[Order of Embers]] Hat, recovered by [[adventurer]].
