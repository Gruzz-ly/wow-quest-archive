==Objectives==
Destroy 12 Heartsbane objects in [[Arom's Stand]].
* [[Heartsbane Coven|Heartsbane]] objects destroyed (12)

==Description==
<It looks like some careless witch made a poor attempt to hide this grimoire from sight. No good could come of leaving the possessions of the coven for a hapless villager to find.

It would probably be a good idea to destroy any trappings of the coven that you find in Arom's Stand.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
What did you find?

==Completion==
That was good thinking to dispose of the witches' trappings. 

I don't want to know what would happen if an innocent villager toyed around with such things!

==Notes==
Eligible objects are [[Heartsbane Grimoire (object)|Heartsbane Grimoires]], [[Heartsbane Fetish]]es, [[Heartsbane Scrolls]], and [[Heartsbane Focus|Heartsbane Foci]].

==Progression==
{{A New Order}}
