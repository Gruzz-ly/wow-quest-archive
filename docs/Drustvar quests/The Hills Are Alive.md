==Objectives==
Collect 6 Runic Power Cores from [[Awoken Guardian]]s.
* [[Runic Power Core]] (6)

==Description==
The [[Drust construct]]s are drawn from the land, but the heart of these constructs is a runic power core.

We have been trying to collect and destroy as many of these cores as we can. We know of a way to disrupt the [[magic]] in the core. Doing so will prevent more of these monstrosities from being created around the dark hearts and protect the land and all living in this region.

Bring me as many Runic Power Cores as you can find and the [[Thornspeakers]] will see they are put to good use.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We would appreciate any runic power cores from the Awoken Guardians you might find.

==Completion==
Excellent, <name>. We can use these to protect the land and the people and creatures living here.

==Progression==
