==Objectives==
Take a key from a [[Hexwood Binder]] and free Master Ashton.
* [[Warren Ashton|Master Ashton]] freed {{co|21.1|55.3|Drustvar}}
* [[Cage Key]]

==Description==
I believe I see Master Ashton in a cage. He must be freed!

Those witches with the long masks appear to be in charge. I bet they would have the means to open his cage.

I will remain here to protect [[Marten Webb|Apprentice Webb]] and keep the area secure.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Master Ashton has suffered greatly at the hands of these monsters.

==Completion==
We had a few visitors while you were gone but I took care of them.

Ashton's back and safe, though it appears he's seen some of the horrors here.

==Notes==
In the area, [[Samantha Sweet]] is trapped in a cage and starts [[Bittersweet]].

Loot the key from a [[Hexwood Binder]] then release Ashton:
