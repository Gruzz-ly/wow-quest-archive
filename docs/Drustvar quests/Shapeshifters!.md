==Objectives==
Take [[Liam (child)|Liam]] to meet a [[druid]] at Ulfar's Den in [[Drustvar]]. Make sure to call for him if he is not present when you get there.
* Visit [[Ulfar's Den]]
* [[Kul Tiran Orphan Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
Being a [[human]] is alright and all, but what if I could be a [[Bear|BEAR]]?

Druids can be bears. And [[cat]]s! And who knows what else!

I've heard rumors of druids in the mountains of Drustvar. It would be so cool to meet one. I wanna see them turn into [[animal]]s! Maybe they can teach me, too!

==Progress==
Roar! Growl! Bear sounds!

==Completion==
Can you take me back here sometime? That game sounds pretty fun!

==Notes==
Arriving at Ulfar's Den:
:{{text|say|Liam|Hey, this place is pretty neat! Where are all the bears?}}
:''[[Arthur Tradewind]] walks from the pond.''
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|Whoa, look! A kid! Hey, kid!}}
:{{Text|say|Liam|By the [[Light]]! A talking cat!}}
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|I'm not a talking cat, I'm a talking druid!}}
:{{text|say|Liam|Whoa... really? Can you turn into a bear, too?}}

:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|And a [[seal]]! Oops, I fell over!}} ''... and a seal but falls on his back.''
:{{text|say|Liam|That's so cool! I wanna be able to do that too!}} ''Arthur shapeshifts back to a cat.''
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|I heard the call when I was around your age! Maybe you'll hear it soon, too!}}
:{{text|say|Liam|Hmm... I'm gonna keep my ears wide open, then! Thanks, cat man!}}
:{{text|say|Arthur Tradewind|Hey, come back anytime! We can play "Don't Wake Ulfar!"}}
:''Arthur walks back to the pond and sits.''
