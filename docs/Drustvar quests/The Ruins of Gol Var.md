==Objectives==
Escort [[Lucille Waycrest]] into [[Gol Var]].
* Escort Lucille into Gol Var

==Description==
What lie beyond are more ruins, much like those the coven sought. 

However, these ruins served a different purpose, one that established the legacy of [[House Waycrest]] thousands of years ago.

Let us head inside, and I will explain.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 24,680 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Just a little further...

;Backup gossip
: I never thought I would set foot in these ruins. Isn't it amazing?
''{{gossip|I'm ready to go in.}}''

==Completion==
Who would've thought that from this stuffy little chamber would rise some of the greatest warriors of House Waycrest's history?

Are you prepared to follow in their footsteps?

==Notes==
On accept:
: ''Lucille walks out of the cottage and down into the cave at a brisk pace.''
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Long ago, when [[Kul Tiras]] was first settled, our people encountered a savage group of [[Vrykul|warmongering barbarians]]. They called themselves the [[Drust]].}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Drustvar was their ancestral home. It was from here that they launched endless raids into our fledgeling hamlets.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|This carried on for countless years, until the ancestors of House Waycrest decided that something had to be done.}}
: ''Walking by some inactive [[revenant]]s made of old stone, a rumble of shifting stone can be heard.''
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Wait... what was that?}}
:{{text|yell|Lucille Waycrest|Look out!}}

Two [[Awakened Revenant]]s appear. Defeat them:
: ''Lucille sighs in relief.''
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|I'm sorry, <class>. The coven's magic must be disturbing the spirits of the ancient Drust. We'll have to be careful.}}
: ''Lucille continues on, this time at a regular walking pace.''
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|My ancestors fought against stone constructs much like these in their war against the Drust.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|The Waycrests have always been hearty folk, but the Drust's magic was strong. We were losing the war...}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|In the end, it was our scholars that turned the tide...}}
:{{text|yell|Lucille Waycrest|Wait... look out!}}

Two [[Awakened Revenant]]s appear. Defeat them:
: ''Lucille sighs in relief.''
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Thank you, <class>. I thought that one had me for a moment.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|As I was saying, the tide of the war shifted when our scholars began to uncover weaknesses in the Drust's magic.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|They compiled what they learned into a treatise on weapons and tactics that could be used to defeat the barbarians.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Armed with this knowledge, our men started driving the Drust back into their mountain holds.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|They kept that knowledge hidden here, safe from unwanted hands.}}
: ''Lucille goes up to the torch by the boulders blocking the way.''
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Hmm... It looks like some rubble blocks our path ahead. Can you clear the way?}}

Interact with the [[Debris]]:
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Wait... something's not right.}}
:{{text|yell|Lucille Waycrest|<Class>, behind you!}}

Defeat the [[Stonebound Guardian]]:
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|I've never seen a construct that big before! Are you alright?}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|What am I saying... of course you're alright. I can see it'll take more than a few stones to bring you down!}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Come along, the book should be in here!}}
: ''Lucille runs into the chamber.''
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Here it is... the last resting place of the [[Order of Embers]]. Are you ready to revive ancient history?}}
