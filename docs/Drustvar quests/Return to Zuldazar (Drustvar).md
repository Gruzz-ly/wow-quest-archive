==Objectives==
Return to [[Nathanos Blightcaller]] on the [[Banshee's Wail]]. [[Swellthrasher]] in [[Anyport]] can give you a ride.
*Speak to Swellthrasher in Anyport

==Description==
You know kid, I think I've got it all covered here. My guys will find all the [[:Azerite]] they can here and make me rich!

I mean, you know, make the [[Horde]] rich. With power!

Anyway, you can go tell Nathanos we're done here. This base is the best place to launch any attacks against the [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tirans]] here in [[Drustvar]] -- that's a [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] guarantee!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
*[[Glowing Azerite Geode]] (250 [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Completion==
You've established a foothold in Drustvar with the goblins? Good.

I will have my men keep an eye on Gallywix's activities there. Just in case.

==Progression==
{{Drustvar Foothold}}
