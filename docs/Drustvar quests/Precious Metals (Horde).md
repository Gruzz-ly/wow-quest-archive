==Objectives==
Collect 10 Silver Nuggets from the [[Bleak Hills Mine]].
* [[Silver Nugget]] (10)

==Description==
Hey you! I got a business proposition for ya.The{{sic}} locals here seem to have a thing for silver, and we hit the jackpot with a mine just west of here. 

Unfortunately, it's got a bit of a spider problem...

Now, the miners we sent down there are probably goners by now, but there's still some silver left down there. If you can go and fetch it for me, we'll mark it up and make a fortune!

What do you say?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find the silver? 

==Completion==
Way to come through, pal!

Oh, some of the miners were still alive? Now that's just crazy talk.

==Notes==
At the [[Bleak Hills Mine]], [[Foreman Cogbutton]] offers two side quests: [[An Eight-Legged Curse (Horde)]] and [[All Wrapped Up (Horde)]]. Pick them up before getting too far into the silver gathering.

Upon completion of all three:
:{{text|say|Foreman Cogbutton|You coward! You left us there to die!}}
:{{text|say|Reez Grimelock|Whoa, cool it there! How was I supposed to know there were survivors?}}
:{{text|say|Foreman Cogbutton|Because we were screaming at you as you left with our only guards!}}
:{{text|say|Reez Grimelock|Really? I think I would remember that...}}
:{{text|say|Reez Grimelock|Tell ya what, how bout I cut you in on the silver profits and you put down that pick. How's twenty percent sound?}}
:{{text|say|Foreman Cogbutton|Make it fifty. Unless you'd rather I take fifty percent of your teeth.}}
:{{text|say|Reez Grimelock|Okay, fifty! Sounds fair to me! No hard feelins, right?}}
:{{text|say|Foreman Cogbutton|Not so long as you hold up your end, slimeball.}}
