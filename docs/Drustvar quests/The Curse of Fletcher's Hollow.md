==Objectives==
Speak with [[Evelyn Pare]] at the [[Timbered Strand]] in [[Drustvar]].

==Description==
It's obvious the constable won't be swayed until we discover what happened at [[Fletcher's Hollow]]. I know very little myself--only that the village has been overrun by monstrous creatures.

I must ask that you travel there in my stead and try to uncover what befell the village. I'm sure [[Marshal Everit Reade|Marshal Reade]] will prevent the constable from harming me while you're away.

Do this for me, and I will help you as I can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|98|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You're looking to help solve this curse? Well, that's good to hear. We can surely use all the help we can get.

I'm happy to help you get to the bottom of this. First things first, though, we need to save some of our villagers.

Care to lend a hand?

==Notes==
Head south.

On the way, at [[Mudfish Lodge]], [[Art Hughie]] offers some side quests: [[Mean Gulls]] and [[Take the Bait]].
