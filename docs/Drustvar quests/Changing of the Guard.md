==Objectives==
Deliver recruitment orders to Captain Cleardawn, Ensign Yorrick, Ensign Mace, Lieutenant Sterntide, and Falconer Notley in [[Arom's Stand]].
* [[Captain Joan Cleardawn|Captain Cleardawn]] recruited {{co|37.5|48.8|Drustvar}}
* [[Ensign Yorrick]] recruited {{co|35.3|53.1|Drustvar}}
* [[Lieutenant Sterntide]] recruited {{co|39.8|50.0|Drustvar}}
* [[Ensign Mace]] recruited {{co|39.0|51.5|Drustvar}}
* [[Falconer Notley]] recruited {{co|38.7|52.5|Drustvar}}

==Description==
I have no doubt that you're a quite capable <class>, mainlander, but we will need some help if we want to make it to [[Waycrest Manor]] in one piece. A small group would be ideal; strong enough to face the coven's threats, but small enough to remain largely unnoticed.

<[[Marshal Everit Reade|Reade]] produces a bundle of letters.>

I have written new orders to some of my finest soldiers to join your Order of Embers. They will report to you and the [[Lucille Waycrest|lady Waycrest]]. Please deliver these to them, so they can be prepared to move out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
You will need to gather your recruits before we venture forth.

==Completion==
It is with reluctance that I hand command of these men over to you, but it must be done.

I hope you lead them well.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Sharp Thinking]] before heading out.

Just outside, spot the [[Heartsbane Grimoire (object)|Heartsbane Grimoire]], which starts [[Implements of Ill Intent]].

The first [[Unmasked Witch]] discovered by poking Corlain Refugees with the needle will drop a [[Hastily Drawn Map]], which starts [[Hidden Dealings]].

;Cleardawn
:What can I do for you, <class>?
{{gossip|<Hand over Marshal Reade's orders.>}}
:{{text|say|Captain Joan Cleardawn|So Marshal Reade believes that you are the key to driving back the coven?}}
:{{text|say|Captain Joan Cleardawn|I have my doubts... but I will carry out my orders.}}
: ''She salutes.''
:{{text|say|Captain Joan Cleardawn|I will join the others and await your command, <class>.}}
: ''Cleardawn walks off to despawn in the doorway of the building Reade and Lucille are in, respawning inside.''

;Notley
:A fine specimen, isn't he? The House Waycrest has long been known as experts in the arts of falconry.
:Unfortunately, most of our best birds have fallen under the curse of the coven. Winston here is one of only a handful of Waycrest falcons not under their spell.
:It is truly a sad state of affairs.
{{gossip|<Hand over Marshal Reade's orders.>}}
:{{text|say|Falconer Notley|New orders, then?}}
: ''He walks to the building.''
:{{text|say|Falconer Notley|Come, Winston. Looks like we have witches to fight.}}

Note: Two versions of Notley spawn and walk in perfect sync, one of them holding out his arm for Winston to perch... so it looks like he has two left arms.

;Mace
:What is it, mainlander?
:In case you can't tell, I'm a little busy here.
{{gossip|<Hand over Marshal Reade's orders.>}}
:{{text|say|Ensign Mace|So you're the one behind this "Order of Embers" I've been hearing about.}}
:{{text|say|Ensign Mace|While I don't buy into all this hocus-pocus, anything is better than sitting here waiting for the coven to kill us all.}}
: ''She salutes.''
:{{text|say|Ensign Mace|You have my blade, <class>.}}
: ''Mace runs to the building.''

;Yorrick
:Something wicked stirs in the woods, mainlander. At night, the ancient Drust monument at its heart glows with unholy power.
:If I were you, I would give that place a wide berth in your travels.
{{gossip|<Hand over Marshal Reade's orders.>}}
:{{text|say|Ensign Yorrick|So the rumors are true? The Order of Embers is reformed?}}
:{{text|say|Ensign Yorrick|And here I thought their tales were merely some historian's overactive imagination.}}
: ''He salutes and runs for the building.''
:{{text|say|Ensign Yorrick|Thank you for delivering these orders, <class>. I shall report to Miss Waycrest at once.}}

Note: Another Yorrick with a different ID will spawn and speak off-sync with the other.

;Sterntide
:<Lieutenant Sterntide nods his head slightly in acknowledgement of your approach.>
{{gossip|<Hand over Marshal Reade's orders.>}}
: ''He gets up.''
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Sterntide|Heh, It's about time.}}
: ''Sterntide walks to the building.''

==Progression==
{{A New Order}}
