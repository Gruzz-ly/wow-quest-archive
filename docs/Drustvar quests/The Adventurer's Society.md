==Description==
Thank the [[Light]]!

I was taking care of my grandson and his friends. I told them to play quietly while I took a nap. When I woke up they'd left a note saying they were 'Going on [[island expedition|an Expedition]]'. They think they'll find [[Titan]] relics in the trogg caverns!

They're too young to fight [[trogg]]s and I'm too old! My bad knee almost gave out getting here.

You look strapping. Find my grandson and the rest of the '[[Adventurer's Society]]'. Send them home!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hey! You found our stuff!

==Completion==
[[Nigel Rifthold|Nigel]]'s grandpa is nice and all, but he'd have slowed us down! Adventure, fortune and fame awaited!

Maybe we should have brought a weapon or something though.
