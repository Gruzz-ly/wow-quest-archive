==Objectives==
Bring supplies to [[Ranger Encampment]] in [[Gol Koval]].
* [[Emergency Supplies (quest item)]]

==Description==
Mainlander! Stop a moment, I could really use a hand!

My team and I were hunting in the ruins of Gol Koval when the stones began to attack us! I've never seen anything like that before. [[Ranger Wons]] sent Duke and I to get some medical supplies for our injured.

Duke didn't get hit by those possessed stone monsters but he wasn't as fortunate with the spiders nearby. He'll be okay if he rests here for awhile, but my team needs these medical supplies!

Please take these to Ranger Wons!
