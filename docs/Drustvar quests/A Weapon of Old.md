==Objectives==
Help [[Warren Ashton|Master Ashton]] create the Liquid Fire potion.
* Speak with Warren Ashton
* Help create a [[Liquid Fire Flask|Liquid Fire potion]]

==Description==
I've been studying the parchment [[Lucille Waycrest|Lady Lucielle]] sent with you and have translated some of the older [[language]]. 

They called it "Liquid Fire" and it was used to "burn away the [[Drust]]". Using this as a basis I believe we can adapt it to our needs. This is a complex recipe but it just so happens I have everything we need to make this potent alchemical weapon!

I will need your assistance in creating this. Would you be so kind as to help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
We'd better get cooking!

==Completion==
Wonderful! Smells a bit strong but I think it will burn those wooden constructs well! Now it's time to test it out.

==Notes==
Speak with Ashton:
:Dark times have come to Drustvar, but we shall win our land back!
{{gossip|I am ready to begin!}}
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|Excellent! I'll tell you what to add to the cauldron. Be sure to follow my instructions or the results could be.... explosive.}}

There are four options: [[Heartbloom]], [[Volatile Sap]], [[Saltpeter]], and [[Sulfur]]. From left to right, they are:
*{{text|say|Warren Ashton|Now carefully add in some hearthbloom.}}
*{{text|say|Warren Ashton|Next, we need a few drops of volatile sap. Be careful not to jostle the jar too much!}}
*{{text|say|Warren Ashton|We need to add some saltpeter to give it some kick!}}
*{{text|say|Warren Ashton|Add in some sulfur. Watch the fumes!}}

Correct:
*{{text|say|Warren Ashton|Well done! Now we need...}}
*{{text|say|Warren Ashton|Precisely! Now let's see what else...}}
*{{text|say|Warren Ashton|You've done some alchemy before! I can tell!}}

Failure:
:{{text|bossemote|The mixture has ignited! We must start again!}}
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|Well, that wasn't correct. We'll have to start over from scratch!}}

Finally:
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|Excellently done! We should be able to use this against those monstrous wooden creatures. Ah... but do watch it doesn't spill.}}

==Progression==
{{Fighting With Fire}}
