Collect 4 Intact Drust Bones and 9 Ancient Sinew from [[Drust]] [[skeleton]]s in [[Gol Osigr]].
* [[Intact Drust Bone]] (4)
* [[Ancient Sinew]] (9)

==Description==
The effigies crafted by the followers of [[Gorak Tul]] were made not of wood, but of the bones and sinew of their enemies. This will be your first task.

Travel to Gol Osigr where the ancient Drust have awoken from their slumber. The bones here belong to Gorak Tul's greatest soldiers who stood with him at the final battle against the first [[Arom Waycrest|Lord Waycrest]].

Their bones seethe with hatred and anger. This will serve your needs well.

* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the materials?

==Completion==
I can practically feel the hatred emanating off these bones. They will do nicely.

==Notes==
Get back to [[Arom's Stand]] then head south to [[Gol Osigr]].

Kill any Drust in the area for Drust Bones and Ancient Sinews.
