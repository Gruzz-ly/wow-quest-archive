==Objectives==
Meet [[Cesi Loosecannon]] inside [[Anyport]].

==Description==
You look savvy enough to jump on an opportunity when one comes by and, pal, do I have one for you.

See that cove down there? It's run by entrepreneurs with an eye towards meeting the logistical shortfalls that might come up in your typical city or town situation. Well, it's normally run by them.

We have a bit of an [[Irontide Raiders|infestation]] by folks who are more mercenary minded if you catch my meaning.

You help me win back control of the cove and I'll see you're treated well. Sound good?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Right! So. Cards on the table. We're smugglers. We're not pirates. Everyone wants those red-coated jerks gone.

You help me become boss of Anyport and I'll help you.

Talk to some of the key folks around here. Do some favors for 'em then come back to me, got it?

==Notes==

: ''She runs through the broken section of fence and down the path towards the cove.''

There is an [[Irontide Enforcer]] at the bend you'll have to kill, a general taste of how you'll be dealing with the Irontide.
