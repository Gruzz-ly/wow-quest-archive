==Objectives==
Collect 9 Bundles of Hard Wood

* [[Bundle of Hard Wood]] (9)

==Description==
In order for my enchantment to work, we'll need wood from these forests.

When I was alive, I would wander these woods and tend to the trees. While those trees are long gone, perhaps their grandseeds have heard their stories and would be willing to help me.

But don't cut down any of the trees! Please! There are loggers that cut and hew without care for the wilds. Take their hard work so that they will think twice before felling another tree.

Bring me as much wood as you can muster.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I miss the voices of the old forest.

==Completion==
Excellent! The wood appears devoid of pests and rot. Not too long or short. They look thick enough to bend, but only under stress. This will work perfectly!

==Notes==
The bundles can be found at the base of trees near [[Fallhaven]], as well as dropped by the [[Hexthralled Lumberjack]]s that sometimes spawn.
