==Objectives==
Seek out [[Thornspeaker Birchgrove]] in [[Gol Koval]].
* [[Algerson Lumber Sample]] (provided)

==Description==
I don't much believe in [[ghost]]s, or hauntings for that matter.

That said, there is something wrong with this [[lumber]]. I can feel it in my bones. They're achier than normal.

I only know of one group that would know what to do. They're reclusive, but we share a love of [[nature]].

Seek out Thornspeaker Birchgrove in [[Drustvar]]. I trust no one else with this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There's a deep rend in the balance, and it is centered on you. Curious.

==Completion==
Ah, I see... this is the source of that wrongness I felt.

This is troubling indeed, <name>.
