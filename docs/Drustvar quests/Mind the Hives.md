==Objectives==
Find [[Edwin Maldus]] in [[Barbthorn Ridge]].
* Find Edwin
* Save Edwin

==Description==
The one called Edwin came to us not long ago, seeking to earn the blessings of the [[Wicker Man]]. He wandered off into the hills looking for his own offering.

Unfortunately, he managed to disturb one of the nearby beehives, causing the insects to become rather frenzied.

That was the last I saw of him, I'm afraid.

You were the one looking for Edwin, weren't you!?

You must help him!
