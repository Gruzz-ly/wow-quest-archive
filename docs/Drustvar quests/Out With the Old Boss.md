Slay Richard Tornsail.

==Description==
Right so I talked to some people. You talked to some people. No one likes the [[Irontide Raiders|Irontide]]. They're cutting in to profits and scaring off good, honest scoundrel- er customers! 

We take out the guy in charge and we'll be able to run the rest outta town! So a little change of management is in order.

I'm not usually one for stabbin' people, I'm a lover not a fighter, but I can pay. You do this for me and I'll make sure you're welcome here whenever ya want? Sound good?
