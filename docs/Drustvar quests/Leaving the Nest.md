==Objectives==
Collect [[Falconer's Key]]s from [[Hexthralled Falconer]]s and open 5 Falcon Cages in the [[Corlain Aviary]].
* [[Falcon Cage]] opened (5)

==Description==
It looks like the [[Heartsbane Coven|coven]] hasn't managed to enthrall all of our [[falcon]]s. I can see some untainted ones still in [[cage]]s in the training yard.

Our falcons are well trained, and should know to fly to one of our other yards if something happens to their handlers. 

If you can just release them from their cages, they should be able to make it to safety. The [[falconer]]s will have the keys.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are they safe?

==Completion==
Nice work!  With any luck, the falcons should head back to roost at [[Arom's Stand]].

Though really, I'd prefer they be anywhere other than in the coven's clutches.

You have my thanks.
