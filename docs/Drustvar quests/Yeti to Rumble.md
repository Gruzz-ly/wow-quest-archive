==Objectives==
Kill 8 Chillfur Yetis in [[Alpine Rise]].
* [[Chillfur Yeti]] slain (8)

==Description==
It would seem that the guard have been lax in patrolling the [[Highroad Pass]]. The mountain [[yeti]]s have taken advantage of their absence, and now lie directly in our path.

I am no soldier, <class>, so I will need to ask that you take care of them while I try to sneak past. If we can drive them off the road, at least it will make the pass safe again for travelers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We should drive the yetis back from the road. Having a major trade route cut off by monsters isn't going to help our fight against the coven.

==Completion==
Thank you, <class>. Keeping the pass clear will ensure a steady stream of supplies to Highroad Gate.

We will need them in the battles to come.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Yeti to Rumble]] & [[Salvage Rights]] before heading out.

Defeat any [[Awakened Dead]] to have a [[Rune-Etched Bone]] drop, which starts [[If Bones Could Talk]].

==Progression==
{{The Order of Embers}}
