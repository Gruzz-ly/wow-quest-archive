==Objectives==
Deliver [[Evelyn Pare|Evelyn Pare's]] letter to [[Constable Henry Framer]] at [[Hangman's Point]].

==Description==
It'll take us a while to clean up the beasts that are left over, but I'm confident we'll be able to take back [[Fletcher's Hollow]]--thanks to you, of course.

Here, take this letter to the constable. It should be enough to clear [[Lucille Waycrest|Miss Waycrest's]] name. 

I'm sorry you had to witness all of this, mainlander. We are good people, but these are terrible times.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|98|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What's this? A letter from Mayor Pare?

<Constable Framer reads Evelyn's letter.>

Well... it appears we were... mistaken.

==Notes==
On complete:
:{{text|say|Constable Henry Fletcher|Attention! It has been determined that another witch was in fact responsible for the curse in Fletcher's Hollow.}}
:{{text|say|Constable Henry Fletcher|Miss Waycrest, you are free to go... with my apologies...}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Thank you, constable. Shall we, <class>?}}

This concludes the "An Airtight Alibi" chapter of [[Drust Do It.]] The [[Drustvar storyline]] continues with [[And Justice For All]].
