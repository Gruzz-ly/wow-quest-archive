==Objectives==
Fill the Drust Vessel in [[Gol Koval]] by killing enemies and destroying cairns.
* Drust Vessel filled

==Description==
Long have the [[Thornspeakers]] struggled against such [[magic]]s. It is a conflict as old as the [[Drust]] themselves.

[[Gorak Tul]]'s influence, however, has vastly shifted the balance toward that of decay and death. It corrupts what would be an ordinary curse.

I believe [[Ulfar]] can correct this.

Go into Gol Koval. Slay our enemies, destroy their cairns, and collect their magics into this vessel.

With it, Ulfar may be able to find a way to cleanse your materials.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Be careful, <name>. Drust magic is older than most things that are, and older than some that were.

==Completion==
The concentration chills me to my bones, but it will be needed. We must hurry before the corruption can touch you.

==Notes==
To fill up the bar, interact with cairnes or kill enemies in the area:
*[[Vengeful Bones]] grant 5%
*[[Awoken Guardian]]s grant 8%
*The [[Ancient Sentinel]] grants 15%
*[[Empowered Minor Cairne]]s grant 5%
* The [[Empowered Major Cairne]] grant 15%

While the vessel is partially filled, it will vent energy, causing pools of Dark Excess on the ground:
