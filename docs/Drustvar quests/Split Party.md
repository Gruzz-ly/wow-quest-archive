==Objectives==
Free Bridget Fairwater's [[soul]].
* [[Bridget Fairwater]] Freed

==Description==
In life my compatriots and I were valiant champions as you are. In death we are potent souls to make the witch's accursed minions even more powerful. 

With your help I have resisted thus far, but this foul [[witch]] pulled brave Bridget from her justly won rest. She is now trapped in one of these macabre constructs. This witch intends to use Bridget to bring death upon the lands she was oathsworn to protect!

Free Bridget Fairwater's soul from the construct which entraps her!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Why that pustulent boil on a toad's rump! Use me as a pawn? Fie! I will see her sent screaming to the foul pit she crawled from!

My thanks. The witch will pay for her heinous actions!
