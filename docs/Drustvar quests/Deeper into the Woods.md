==Objectives==
Travel with [[Inquisitor Cleardawn|Cleardawn]], [[Warren Ashton|Ashton]] and [[Marten Webb|Webb]] deeper into [[Crimson Forest|the forest]].
* Go deeper into the woods {{co|24.6|56.7|Drustvar}}

==Description==
We need to go deeper into the forest. The witches are clearly up to something even worse than I'd imagined.

As much as I have a duty to return to [[Lucille Waycrest|Lady Lucille]] with Master Ashton, I also have a duty to find out more about this threat to our people, and stop it if I can.

Going further into the forest is not without risk, but I believe it is one worth taking.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|6|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Completion==
By my ancestors' anchors that is a large army! At least it doesn't appear to be mobile yet. And the tree... Clearly it is the focus of their efforts.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|Master Ashton, will you see this to the end?}}
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|I will indeed. Marten and I shall stay.}}
:{{text|say|Marten Webb|Fantastic.}}
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|There seemed to be a great deal of activity at the ruins near the giant tree.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|Then we shall meet our friend there. Good luck, champion.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|Stay close, gentlemen, and we'll sneak through the witches' lines.}}
: ''Cleardawn stealths and the others follow suit. She leads them down across the clearing as they talk.''
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|The witches spoke of a "Grand Rite" to call forth their master.}}
:{{text|say|Marten Webb|Their master?}}
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|A malevolent being who grants them power. I have heard his rage echoing in the darkness.}}
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|Their master hates the Kul Tirans with every fiber of his being. Even the witches are mere pawns in his bid to return to our realm.}}
:{{text|say|Warren Ashton|Based on what I overheard while held captive, I suspect this entity is connected to the [[Drust]].}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|Not just any Drust... their leader, I would wager. The being [[Arom Waycrest]] fought against in ages past.}}
:{{text|say|Marten Webb|A millennia-old spirit bent on vengeance who wants to kill us all? Lovely.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|We must stop this "Grand Rite" at all costs.}}
