==Objectives==
Kill 20 Bilefang spiders in the [[Bleak Hills Mine]].
* Bilefang [[spider]]s slain  (20)

==Description==
That jerk [[Reez Grimelock|Grimelock]] sent us down here to the mines, only to pack up and leave us behind when these spiders showed up! Now I'm stuck here with about a million legs and eyes in all directions.

You look like the tough sort. Can you clear a path for me? I'll make it worth your while.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are they all dead?

==Completion==
That's a relief!

Now I can head back to [[Krazzlefrazz Outpost|Krazzlefrazz]] and give Grimelock a piece of my mind!

==Notes==
*Kill [[Bilefang Hunter]]s and [[Bilefang Skitterer]]s.
