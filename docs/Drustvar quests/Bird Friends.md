==Objectives==
Take [[Liam (child)|Liam]] to see the statue of [[Arom Waycrest]] at Arom's Stand in [[Drustvar]]. Make sure to call for him if he is not present when you get there.
* Visit [[Arom's Stand]]
* [[Kul Tiran Orphan Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
My best friend at the orphanage is named [[Billy (Boralus)|Billy]]. He's just a kid like me, though. I heard that some people in Drustvar have [[Falcon|FALCONS]] as their best friend.

How cool is that?!

Can we go meet a [[falconer]]? Pretty please? I want to have a [[bird]] friend too.

I hear there's a big statue in Arom's Stand of some dead guy who was friends with birds. Maybe we can find a falconer there!

==Progress==
I wish I had feathers like a bird!

==Completion==
Hmm...

I think the first step to being a friend to birds is to stop chasing [[seagull]]s and start feeding them instead!

==Notes==
Arriving at the location of [[Arom's Stand]]:
:{{text|say|Liam|Look at that big guy and his falcon, <name>!}}
:''[[Notley|Inquisitor Notley]] walks up.''
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Notley|Admiring our monument to Arom Waycrest? Did you know he led the charge against the [[Drust]]?}}
:{{text|say|Liam|His falcon is so cool! I want a bird friend!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Notley|Ah, then allow me to introduce you to mine!}}
:''Notley holds out his left arm.''
:{{text|yell|Inquisitor Notley|Winston!}}
:''[[Winston (falcon)|Winston]] flies in and lands on Notley's left arm.''
:{{text|say|Liam|Whoa! You're a falconer?!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Notley|I am. It takes hard work and perseverance, but to be a falconer there is one trait you must embrace above all others.}}
:{{text|say|Liam|What's that, mister?}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Notley|An open heart. Falcons know the intentions of those around them. If you stay true and good, you'll be a friend to animals of all kinds.}}
:{{text|say|Liam|I think I can do that! Thanks, mister!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Notley|Anytime, friend. Perhaps I'll see you one day amongst the flock!}}
:''Notley walks off.''
