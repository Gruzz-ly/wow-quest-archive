==Objectives==
Gather [[:Azerite]] from 6 [[Crate of Azerite|crates]].
*[[Azerite Powder]] (6)

==Description==
The [[Horde]] filth up on that hill seem to be mining some kind of ore I've not seen before.

If they've come all the way out here to find it, it must be valuable. Take what you can find!

==Progress==
Did you figure out what they were doing up there?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Small Azerite Fragment]] (75x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Did you figure out what they were doing up there? 

==Completion==
This just looks like a pile of junk!

==Notes==
There is no breadcrumb. While in the area, you can loot [[Bilgewater Patented Flamethrower (starter)]] to start [[Turn the Heat Around]].

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Scout McKellis|Hmph! The Horde got what was coming to them. I'll take this contraption up to Arom's Stand and see if anyone has any use for it. Good work.}}
