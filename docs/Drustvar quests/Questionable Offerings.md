==Objectives==
Bring the correct offerings to the [[Wicker Man]] in [[Autumnvale]].
*Offering given
*Withness Autumnvale's Ritual

==Description==
So the [[Merchant|traders]] sent you? As I told them, I only discuss the happenings of our family with those who understand our cause.

If you wish to know his whereabouts, you must prove that you do.

Behind us are several items gathered for offering to the Wicker Man. Bring us the items you feel will most appease it, so that it might give us its blessing.

Choose the correct offerings, and we will know your intent.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}

==Progress==
You must bring the correct offerings if you wish to show us your understanding.

==Completion==
Your offerings pleased the Wicker Man.

Very well, ask your questions, <class>.

==Progression==
You must bring the correct offerings if you wish to show us your understanding.

==Notes==
There are 7 items at the camp but only 3 will fulfill the objective. The correct items are Bones, Entrails, and the Bundle of Wicker.

Collect the items and return them ''one by one'' to the altar between Lord Autumnvale and the Wicker Man, prompting the gathered to react to each. Items are automatically dropped on the altar, no need to click anywhere. Gathering the correct items first blocks the rest of the objects.
