==Objectives==
Place 6 traps in the [[Watcher's Wood]].
* Traps placed (6)

==Description==
There is more to worry about in these woods than simple beasts. Our enemy employs constructs of [[wicker]] and bone that can rip a man apart.

Fortunately for us, these constructs are not very perceptive.

Take these traps and set them up throughout the woods behind us. If our enemies do seek to ambush us here, at least these will slow their minions down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|80|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must be prepared. Anywhere can harbor an ambush here.

==Completion==
Good, those traps should alert us in case anything tries to sneak up on us through the woods.

You have bought us a modicum of safety, <class>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Woods Have Eyes]] before heading out.

On completion of both:
