==Objectives==
Create a runic power core and charge it from the corpses of [[Awoken Guardian]]s and [[Vengeful Bones]].
* Collect [[Smooth River Stone]]
* Enchant [[Runic Power Core (1)]]
* Consume Souls (12)

==Description==
We have most of the materials we need, but we require one final item. A heart.

Don't worry. I don't mean one of flesh, but of stone; to bind the materials of the body into a single form.

Find a smooth stone, and enchant it to hold a life force. It will require some reagents, but I would expect a powerful enchanter such as yourself to have some on hand or know where to find them.

Once that's done, it will need to be powered. The [[soul]]s animating the [[elemental]]s and [[undead]] here should do the trick.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
That was the last item we needed.

Now we just need to go to my sanctum so we can assemble it undisturbed.

==Notes==
Travel further southwest to find the smooth stone in shallow water. You then learn [[Enchant Runic Power Core]], which requires the stone and three [[Veiled Crystal]]s to make.
