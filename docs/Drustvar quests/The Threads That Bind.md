==Objectives==
Collect 55 Durable Spider Silk.
* [[Durable Spider Silk]] (55)

==Description==
Our destination is near [[Gol Koval]], but there is something else you could pick up along the way.

I don't want to ask because I hate them, but you cannot dispute the resilience of that horrible webbing that they manage to get everywhere.

<[[Sef Iwen|Sef]] grimaces at the thought.>

There are [[spider]]s to the southeast. As a guardian of nature, I don't want to say kill them, but if you could... 'obtain' some fresh silk from their bodies, we could use it to bind the limbs of the golem together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you get the silk?

==Completion==
<She shivers in disgust.>

Blech! The thought of that being part of my body makes me regret asking.

As a [[druid]], I was told that there is beauty in all of nature, but I still see none in those spindly legged monstrosities.

Let's keep going. I don't like being near them.

==Notes==
Travel southeast to [[Wayward Thicket]] and kill the [[Venomous Weaver]]s for their silk.
