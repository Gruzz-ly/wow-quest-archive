==Objectives==
Kill 10 Bonegnasher troggs.
* [[Bonegnasher|Bonegnasher trogg]] slain (10)

==Description==
These [[trogg]]s are a menace to the whole area! They raid camps and caravans and eat the livestock when they come down from their caves. The kids being up there might set them off! 

Slay some of those troggs before they decide to cause trouble.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There are a lot of troggs around. More than I expected to see.

==Completion==
You look like you've been in a fight. Did you introduce those troggs to the business end of your weapon?

That's what I would have done! Give 'em a good right hook! And then a left! Pow! Bam!

I bet they're sorry for messing with you!

==Notes==
Kill: [[Bonegnasher Skullcrusher]]s, and [[Bonegnasher Earthcaller]]s.

==Progression==
{{The North Pass Caverns}}

==Patch changes==
