==Objectives==
Give the Inquisitors Regalia to the recruits in Arom's Stand.
* Recruits inducted (5)
* Lucille's orders issued
*[[Inquisitor's Regalia]] (provided)

==Description==
Before we leave, I have one more task to ask of you.

While you were busy recruiting our inquisitors and driving the coven away from [[Arom's Stand]], I took the liberty of placing an order with the local tailor. 

Using some of the sketches within the tome, I had him put together some uniforms reminiscent of those worn by the ancient order.

Since you will be leading our inquisitors, I think it's only fitting that you present them with their new regalia.

==Rewards==
{{Stub-section}}
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
*Choice of Azerite armor
**[[Banisher Jerkin]]
**[[Banisher Cowl]]
**[[Waycrest Militia Helmet]]<!-- Needs doublechecking if it made it out of beta. -->
**[[Waycrest Militia Battleplate]]<!-- Needs doublechecking if it made it out of beta. -->
*[[Small Azerite Cluster]] (150x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +3000 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
You should be inducting them, not me!

==Completion==
There, that was nice and official. 

Now, I think it's time we took the fight back to the Heartsbane. I believe the marshal has a plan.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|There were words of induction somewhere in the tome. Let me see...}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Ah, here we are.}}
: ''Lucille walks up in front of the line of recruits.''
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Brothers and Sisters, today you become the searing fire that burns away the darkness.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Today you become the shining blade that cuts through the wicked.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Today you become the beacon of hope against the endless foe.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|By the authority of House Waycrest, I name you inquisitors of the Order of Embers!}}

Target each recruit and use the quest item on them in turn. After giving out the fifth set:
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Now, before we depart, I'll need someone to undertake a special task for the order.}}
: ''Lucille turns to Reade.''
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Any recommendations, Marshal?}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|Captain Cleardawn--Excuse me, Inquisitor Cleardawn is as reliable as they come. I'm sure she can handle anything you need her for.}}
: ''Cleardawn salutes.''
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|Thank you, sir! What do you require of me, milady?}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|If we wish to defeat the coven for good, we will need more than silver. We will need fire.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Take this recipe for alchemical fire to [[Warren Ashton|Master Ashton]] in [[Falconhurst]]. He will know what to make of it.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Cleardawn|Yes, ma'am!}}
: ''Saluting, Cleardawn runs out.''
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|The rest of us will need to prepare for the ride to [[Corlain]]. Marshal, I understand you have a plan of attack?}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|Yes. We ride out on the mainlander's command.}}

This concludes the "A New Order" chapter of [[Drust Do It.]] The [[Drustvar storyline]] continues with [[The Road to Corlain]] and [[Through the Old Roads]].
