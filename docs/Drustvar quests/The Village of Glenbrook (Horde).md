All but a few of the names are crossed out.>

*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

<The body is twisted and mangled nearly beyond recognition.

You can only assume this is the "Annie" mentioned in the register.>

==Notes==
;[[Hawthorne's Hoe]]
:{{text|say|Abby Lewis|Sam kept his farm well-tended. To livestock he was kind. Into the woods Sam vanished-- now who will tend his swine?}}

Carved into the wood reads "S. Hawthorne".

;[[Jonathan Hayes]]
:{{text|say|Abby Lewis|Mister Hayes was said to have a soul so sweet and nice. How sad the kind man's heart became a witch's sacrifice!}}
: ''Abby giggles.''

<There is a large, open wound in the center of the man's chest. Peering in, you notice that his heart has been ripped out.>

{{gossip|<Investigate the body for identification.>}}

<Searching his pockets, you find a letter.>

My dearest Mary,

Please, come back home. [[Russell Hayes|Russell]] continues to ask where you are. What shall I say? That mother ran into the woods to do who knows what? We miss you, my dear. Our home is not the same. Please, come back to us.

Love,<br>
Jonathan

{{gossip|<Take the letter.>}}

;[[Mary's Book]]
:{{text|say|Abby Lewis|Miss Mary turned her back on us while seeking wicked power. She brought death upon our village, turned the forest dark and dour.}}

It seems to be the journal of Mary Hayes. Most pages are faded, stained, and unintelligible, but one phrase reads clear.

"We are done with Glenbrook. My sisters and I aim our sights higher."

:{{text|say|Abby Lewis|The dark ones called to [[Annie Warren|Annie]], but from evil she refrained. No surprise to anyone she ended up in chains!}}
