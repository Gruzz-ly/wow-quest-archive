==Objectives==
Defeat 8 Vengeful Bones.
* [[Vengeful Bones]] slain (8)

==Description==
If the living rocks weren't bad enough, it seems the undead are hauling themselves out of the ground, too!

This used to be a [[Drust]] [[settlement]], so those are probably Drust bones. They hated us and the feeling is definitely mutual right now.

I don't know what has them stirred up, but they're a danger to us and everyone else. Take them out and I'll reward you for the work.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to kill any of those monsters?

==Completion==
Hopefully those monsters will stay down. You have my thanks.

==Progression==
