==Objectives==
Destroy the Ancient Cairns.
* [[Minor Ancient Cairn]]s destroyed (4)
* [[Major Ancient Cairn]] destroyed

==Description==
My mentor sensed the activation of ancient powers here. We came to stop them but were too late. We banded together with the [[ranger]]s for mutual protection, but our task remains unfinished.

There is a set of ancient cairns here. These help empower the [[Drust construct]]s. Destroying them will also help to settle the [[undead]] stirring from the land.

Destroy the cairns and we'll be able to bring sanity to this place.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Power within those cairns does not bode well for anyone in Drustvar.

==Completion==
Thank you for destroying those cairns. We should be able to dismantle the Drust constructs and risen dead more easily now.

==Progression==
