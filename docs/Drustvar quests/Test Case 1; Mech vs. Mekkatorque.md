==Notes==
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Huh, feels weird actually doin' somethin' for someone else. Is this what you do all the time?}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Gotta say, I'm not a fan. Think I'll leave this sorta thing to you in the future.}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|There's Mekkatorque's ship. King of the gnomes, or whatever those little freaks like to call him.}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|You know what I'm gonna do when I find this guy? First, I'm gonna blow up that little mech suit of his.}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Then, I'm gonna find MORE of his little machines and blow them up too!}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Seriously, this guy is really obsessed with machines. Makes me think he wants to be part robot or somethin'!}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, blowing up all his stuff. Yeah, I bet he'd be cryin' and sobbin' the entire time, what a wimp!}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|And then, I'm gonna sell all those junk parts of his at BELOW MARKET RATE. The ultimate goblin insult!}}
:{{Text|say|High Tinker Mekkatorque|Wow, Gallywix, that would really show me! Any more clever ideas?}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|GAH! <name>, hit the big red button, BLOW THIS MOOK TO SMITHEREENS!}}
