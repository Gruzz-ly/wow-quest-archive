==Objectives==
Protect [[Zallestrasza]] while she conducts the ritual.
* Travel to [[Vadekius's Rest]]
* Tell Zallestrasza to begin
* Protect Zallestrasza

==Description==
The [[Thornspeakers]] were assisting me but they have troubles of their own.

I came in search of a powerful [[dragon]] who fell in battle many centuries ago. Melting snows have revealed [[Vadekius]]'s final resting place.

My [[Alexstrasza|Queen]] has tasked me with ensuring his body cannot be reanimated and [[Slavery|enslaved]]. The ritual will require my full attention and my [[druid]] friends aren't fit for combat.

Watch my back while I ensure my cousin's [[soul]] flies amid the branches of [[G'Hanir]], safe from [[Undead|undeath]].

=== Death Knights ===
: We know of your misdeeds, Death Knight. Your actions helped to save [[Azeroth]] from the Burning Legion, but our trust is damaged.

: Tread Carefully.

''{{gossip|You know me?}}

: We do, Deathlord, <name>.

: We know it was you who assaulted our sanctum. We know you have corrupted and enslaved Kyranastrasz.

: Those are offenses against Life that will be answered for, one day.

* ''{{gossip|I spared what lives I could.}}''
<Zallestrasza's expression eases slightly>

That also did not go unnoticed <name>. My people are few and each life is precious.

It does not excuse the offense against my flight, but we acknowledge and appreciate your... restraint. For being such as you it could not have been easy.

''{{gossip|I want to ask something else.}}''

* ''{{gossip|Your people are weak and were nearly dead anyway. I just ended your suffering more swiftly.}}''

:: You are a monster in [[Arthas]]'s own image, <name>. When final death comes for you, I hope you will go slowly, tortured by the pain and suffering you have inflicted on others.

:: When all the world was engaged in greater matters, you rode across the planet dragging the dead into cursed unlife. I am sure you told yourself it was for the greater good, but mark my words, Deathlord, there will be consequences.

:: <Zallestrasza gives herself a little shake>

:: But for now, maybe you can be useful.
