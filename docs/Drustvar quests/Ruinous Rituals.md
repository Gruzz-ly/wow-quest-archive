==Objectives==
Kill 4 Blighted Horrors in Upper Corlain.
* [[Blighted Horror]] slain (4)

==Description==
Take a look in the city square, <class>.

<Marshal Reade gestures toward a ritual being performed by some disciples in the distance.>

It appears the coven has gone beyond dark constructs, and are now conjuring creatures of nightmare with their rituals. Let us not wait to see what these monsters are capable of. We should put an end to them right here.

Fortunately, the disciples seem to focused on their spell to notice us. Maybe you can use that to your advantage.

==Rewards==

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Have the monsters been abolished?

==Completion==
I am glad we were able to stop those things here, before the coven could unleash them on Drustvar's unsuspecting citizens.

==Notes==
Pick up [[To the Other Side]] and [[Hexecutioner]]  before heading out.

Just inside, the [[Corlain Citizen's Journal]] starts [[The Fall of Corlain (quest)]].

==Progression==
{{Storming the Manor}}
