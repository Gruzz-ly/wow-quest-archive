==Objectives==
Question 5 [[Fletcher's Hollow Villager]]s in [[Hangman's Point]].
* Villager questioned (5)

==Description==
Witchcraft has long lived in the superstitions of the people here. It is only recently that some of these superstitions have become reality.

According to tradition, one who is tried for witchcraft is allowed to choose the means by which they are tested from among the requests of her peers.

The villagers here no doubt have some strange beliefs of what witches can and cannot do. Speak with them, and see what we can do to prove my innocence.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|90|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you learned from the villagers?

==Completion==
Well, those are certainly some interesting beliefs. I think it's safe to rule out the fire and drowning, don't you think?

Looks like that leaves us with three tests...

==Notes==
Speak with five:

First:<!--144335-->
:This trial is an awful thing, but justice must be done for Fletcher's Hollow!
{{gossip|How can you prove someone is not a witch?}}
:Well, my ma always told me that a witch could never cry, no matter how hurt or sad they got.
:Miss Waycrest didn't cry one bit even after being told she would be put on trial. She must be a witch!

Second:<!--144336-->
:That woman brought evil into our town. She must be made to pay?
{{gossip|How can you prove someone is not a witch?}}
:I've heard that a witch's flesh is impervious to flame. That's why we hang them when they're found guilty!
:If you want to convince me, put a torch to her!

Third:<!--144337-->
:Something must be done to stop the curse on our village.
:Surely, killing the witch who cast the spell should break it?
{{gossip|How can you prove someone is not a witch?}}
:I... I'm not sure...
:There is a rumor that a witch could never sick up, since their belly is constantly emptied by the dark spirits living within her.
:I'm not sure how you could prove that, though...

Fourth:<!--144338-->
:The witch's evil curse took my son! There will be justice done today!
{{gossip|How can you prove someone is not a witch?}}
:Back in the old days we would weigh them down and throw them into the river! If they resurfaced, we'd know that they made an unholy pact, and they'd get the noose!
:That's the only way to absolve a witch in my eyes!

Fifth:<!--144339-->
:I've never seen a real witch before. isn't this exciting?!
{{gossip|How can you prove someone is not a witch?}}
:I heard a story a while back that there was a witch who lived in the swamp, and the way the villagers found her out was because the [[Bloodfly|bloodflies]] there wouldn't go near her.
:They bit everyone else, but wouldn't bite her!
:They say it was because a witch's blood is so foul that not even a bloodfly will touch it!
