==Objectives==
Rally 6 Frightened Woodsmen in the [[Timbered Strand]].
* [[Frightened Woodsman]] rallied (6)

==Description==
These things seem intent on capturing our people... but we're not quite sure what for.

The ones in the town might be too tough to reach right now, but we might be able to save some of the woodsmen who work along the strand.

Head to the lumber fields just east of here, and see if there's anyone still alive out there. We can shelter them here until we can arrange safe passage out of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|80|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Where there any survivors?

==Completion==
Good work, <class>! Even if we don't manage to take the town back, it's good to know we were able to save some of our people.

Now we just have to get them out of here...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Evelyn Pare|You hear that, boys? The mainlander's gonna help us take our town back!}}
:{{text|say|Evelyn Pare|Let's hope you brought an army in that pack of yours.}}

Pick up [[Clear-Cutting]] before heading out.

Frightened Woodsmen:
*{{text|say|Frightened Woodsman|They nearly had me there. Thank you, <class>.}}
*{{text|say|Frightened Woodsman|What are these things!? I'm getting out of here!}}
*{{text|say|Frightened Woodsman|I'm saved! I was a moment away from being monster food!}}
