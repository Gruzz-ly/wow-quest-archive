==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Captain Goodspeed.jpg|Captain Goodspeed|A former captain of the Waycrest Guard who turned traitor and willingly joined the coven.}}
Kill Captain Goodspeed and 6 of his guardsmen at [[Pikeman's Ridge]].
* [[Captain Goodspeed]] slain {{co|28.9|19.1|Drustvar}}
* Goodpeed's guardsmen slain 6

==Description==
It has come to my attention that you intend to assault the camp outside of the walls. If this is so, I have a request.

Though most of the guardsmen who fight against us were turned to the coven against their will, Captain Goodspeed and his brigade of halberdiers gave their souls willingly to the Heartsbane. They are traitors and an affront to the Waycrest Guard.

You will find Goodspeed and his men stationed at the camp. I would consider it a personal favor if you would cut them down to the last.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Wickerwoven Grips

}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
Captain Goodspeed was a stain on the reputation of the Waycrest Guard.

I hope his end was painful.
