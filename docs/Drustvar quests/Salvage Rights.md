==Objectives==
Recover the Wrapped Supplies, Cask of Salted Fish, Hardened Lockbox, and Bucket of Grain from [[Alpine Rise]].
* [[Wrapped Supplies]] {{co|45.6|34.4|Drustvar}}
* [[Cask of Salted Fish]] {{co|45.0|32.5|Drustvar}}
* [[Hardened Lockbox]] {{co|43.5|30.8|Drustvar}}
* [[Bucket of Grain]] {{co|45.5|30.1|Drustvar}}

==Description==
This poor trader was set upon by the [[yeti]]s. There's nothing we can do for him now, but we would be remiss to let his supplies be laid to waste by these brutes.

See if you can find any supplies worth salvaging. You can use [[Bella (horse)|Bella]] as a pack horse.

Don't worry, she's a brave mare. She won't spook easily.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 50x [[War Resources]]
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found anything salvageable?

==Completion==
I'm impressed. I didn't think there would be this much left from his shipment. This will be very helpful to our men at the gate.

Bella knows the way, so she should be able to get these to them.  This place is too dangerous to keep her hitched up, anyway.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Bella, I'll need you to follow this one and carry the supplies they find, okay?}}

Pick up [[Yeti to Rumble]] & [[Salvage Rights]] before heading out.

Defeat any [[Awakened Dead]] to have a [[Rune-Etched Bone]] drop, which starts [[If Bones Could Talk]].

On complete:
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Yah! Ride to [[Arom's Stand]], Bella!}}
