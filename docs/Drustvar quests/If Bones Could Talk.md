==Objectives==
Collect a Pristine Rune-Etched Bone from [[Awakened Dead]] in [[Alpine Rise]].
* [[Pristine Rune-Etched Bone]]

==Description==
<These [[skeleton]]s appear to be rising out of the ancient ruins that dot the land here. Their bones are covered with what looks like runes, but time has worn away all but fragments of the markings.

If you could find some of these runes intact, Lucille might be able to decipher them to find out where these skeletons come from...

...and why they are no longer at rest.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What's this?

==Completion==
These markings... this is the language of the Drust!

The magic of the coven must be disturbing their spirits, drawing them back into our world to fight us once more!

This is unsettling... but it is another reason we must bring an end to the Heartsbane!

==Notes==
While on [[Alpine Rise]] for [[Yeti to Rumble]] and [[Salvage Rights]], defeat any [[Awakened Dead]] to have a [[Rune-Etched Bone]] drop, which starts this quest.
