==Objectives==
Bring Treadward's Ring to [[Lucille Waycrest]] at [[Watchman's Rise]].
*[[Treadward's Ring]] (provided)

==Description==
I can feel my bonds to this place slipping, and I have you to thank.

I would like to ask one more favor of you though. Please bring the ring you found to [[Lucille Waycrest|Lucille]]. It was meant for her to hold, not my dusty bones.

And <class>, do not tell her what has transpired here. She has enough tragedy weighing down her heart. I do not wish to add to it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34|}}
* +10 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
What... what's this?

==Completion==
This... this is the ring Alexander was to give me at our wedding.  I had thought it long lost...

I do not know how you found this, <class>, but words cannot say how grateful I am. Alexander was very dear to me, and this ring was a symbol of the strength of our love.

It is good to feel that again...
