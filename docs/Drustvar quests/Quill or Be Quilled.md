==Objectives==
Kill 6 Territorial Quillrats in [[Hawthorne's Plot]].
* [[Invasive Quillrat]] slain (6)

==Description==
Oh, hello there. Sorry, we don't get many mainlanders in these parts.

This plot was my husband [[Samuel Hawthorne|Sam's]] farm. He used to tend to the onion fields every day before the curse befell [[Glenbrook Homestead|Glenbrook]] and took him with it.

With my husband gone, this farm is all I have left, and these [[quillrat]]s are making sure I don't get even that.

I'd hate to bother a perfect stranger, but could you help quell this infestation?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|80|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
These quillrats are truly a menace!

==Completion==
Thank you, <class>.

Maybe in reviving these fields I can bring a bit of Sam's goodness back to this accursed land.

==Notes==
On [[Hawthorne's Plot]] for [[A Pungent Solution]], [[Adela Hawthorne]] offers this quest.  Also, if players haven't killed her already, the rare [[Quillrat Matriarch]] is inside the tent.

==Progression==
