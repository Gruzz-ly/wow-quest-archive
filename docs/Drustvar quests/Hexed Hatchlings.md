==Objectives==
Use the Falconer's Whistle to destroy 7 bewitching charms in the [[Corlain Aviary]].
*[[Wicker Charm (object)|Wicker Charms]] destroyed (7)
*[[Falconer's Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
I've found where those evil witches have been tainting our falcons! You see those charms? 

<[[Notley]] motions toward the high perches and roofs nearby.>

They're using those to infect our flock with their evil [[magic]] as they hatch. I think [[Winston (falcon)|Winston]] can get up there to take out the charms, but someone will need to direct him.

I'm not quite healed up enough to take on a whole camp of [[falconer]]s. Can you help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Have you taken care of the charms?

==Completion==
The charms are broken? That's a relief!

We may just be able to save our flock after all.

==Progression==
{{Break on Through}}
