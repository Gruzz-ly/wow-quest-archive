==Objectives==
Use the Dowsing Stone to find and Collect 6 Drust Runestones in [[Gol Osigr]].
* [[Drust Runestone]] (6)

==Description==
Since time immemorial, the [[Drust]] have used runes to shape their magics. This remains true of the spells woven by [[Gorak Tul]] and his ilk. You will need some of these runes for your effigy to be effective.

It is likely that some still exist at the site of his final battle, buried under years of soot and snow. 

Take this stone. It is empowered with the magic of the [[Thornspeakers]] and will react to Tul's spells. With it, you should be able to locate the runes, no matter how deep the ages have buried them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you uncovered beneath the snows of Gol Osigr?

==Completion==
These runestones still throb with the twisted energy of Gorak Tul's magic. They will serve you well.

==Notes==
Get back to [[Arom's Stand]] then head south to [[Gol Osigr]].

Runestones are found inside [[Snow Mound (Drustvar)|Snow Mounds]].

==Progression==
{{The Pride of Kul Tiras}}
