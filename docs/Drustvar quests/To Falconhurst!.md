==Objectives==
Meet [[Inquisitor Cleardawn]] outside of [[Falconhurst]].

==Description==
Our time here was well spent. The guards in [[Arom's Stand]] can handle what few [[Drust]] forces remain and I suspect the Drust leader and his magic might have some greater part to play here. 

However we must continue on the mission to Falconhurst. The path on the far side of these ruins will take us there.

I will ride ahead and meet you outside of town!

==Rewards==

You will receive:
* {{cost|21|94|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Completion==
The town is under siege! No wonder we have not heard from them. We must help them.

==Notes==

: ''She mounts up and rides off.''

Make your way down the slope to the nearest road. On the way, you can find [[Adalyn Forestwatcher]], who offers [[Saplings in the Snow]] and the start of a short quest chain.
