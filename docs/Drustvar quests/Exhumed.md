==Objectives==
Cleanse [[Sef Iwen]]'s remains.
* Dig up Sef's [[Ancient Grave|remains]]
* [[Sef Iwen's Remains|Remains cleansed]]

==Description==
As I've said, I'm unable to interact with the material world.

I am able to dominate a creature to control its body, but I find it deplorable. In essence, it is enslaving the poor creature.

What I want is a body of my own. If you build and animate a [[golem]], it would be devoid of intelligence. A shell. One that I could inhabit without issue.

Doing so will require that my [[soul]] is not anchored to anything else in [[Azeroth|this world]], so I need you to remove the spell binding my [[Ghost|spirit]] to my physical remains.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Seeing my old self brings back memories.

==Completion==
I feel... different.

It's like I'm in the middle of an enormous pitch black room. Not literally, but there is a sensation that there is something lurking just outside of my sight that is... unsettling.

At least I don't have to worry about the spirit traps any longer, which is nice.

Regardless, with the spell tying me to my remains broken, there is nothing more for us here. Let us continue our journey south.
