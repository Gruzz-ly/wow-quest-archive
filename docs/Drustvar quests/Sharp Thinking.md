==Objectives==
Use Lucille's Sewing Needle on 10 Corlain Refugees to reveal the hidden witches in [[Arom's Stand]].
*[[Corlain Refugee]] tested (10)
*[[Lucille's Sewing Needle (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
I have reason to believe that the coven has already infiltrated Arom's Stand. There are many unfamiliar faces here, with the refugees from [[Corlain]], and we know they can use their magic to appear like one of us.

This needle is fashioned of solid silver. If the witches are indeed vulnerable to silver, then a prick from this may be enough to break their spell. 

The refugees may not be keen on being prodded, but they must understand that this is for the good of the town... and perhaps all of [[Drustvar]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Lucille's Sewing Needle]]
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
I really hope this works...

==Completion==
It worked?! I knew we were on the right track!

It's too bad we don't have a stockpile of silver weapons lying around, but I think I know how we can deal with that.

==Notes==
On accept:
: ''Lucille turns to Reade.''
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Marshal, we may have found weapons to use against the coven. We will need able-bodied soldiers to wield them.}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|We have many capable troops stationed here, milady. They will make fine recruits for your Order of Embers.}}

Pick up [[Changing of the Guard]] before heading out.

Just outside, spot the [[Heartsbane Grimoire (object)|Heartsbane Grimoire]], which starts [[Implements of Ill Intent]].

The first [[Unmasked Witch]] discovered by poking Corlain Refugees with the needle will drop a [[Hastily Drawn Map]], which starts [[Hidden Dealings]].

Poke citizens:
* {{text|say|Corlain Refugee|Ouch! What in blazes was that for?!}}
: {{text|say|Corlain Refugee|Ugh, bloody mainlanders...}}

* {{text|say|Corlain Refugee|Ow!}}
: {{text|say|Corlain Refugee|The [[Bloodfly|bloodflies]] are really biting these days, aren't they?}}

* {{text|say|Corlain Refugee|Hey! Watch where you're pointing that thing!}}
: {{text|say|Corlain Refugee|Clumsy oaf.}}

Witches:
* {{text|yell|Unmasked Witch|It is useless to resist!}}
* {{text|yell|Unmasked Witch|Drustvar is ours, outsider!}}
* {{text|yell|Unmasked Witch|You will fall before the Mother!}}

==Progression==
{{A New Order}}
