==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Horde]] forces.
* Horde slain  (10)

==Description==
Me an' a few friends were trying to help some of the folks from [[Corlain]] flee safely to [[Arom's Stand]] after things started gettin' weird. I noticed some movement up the hill so I decided to come back and check it out. If the town goin' mad wasn't bad enough, now we have another problem to deal with.

The Horde.

<McKellis spits.>

Those fools have no place on our lands. Wash the snow with their blood.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Kill 'em good for me.

==Completion==
The only good orc is a dead orc.

==Notes==
There is no breadcrumb. Kill [[Bilgewater Incinerator]]s, [[Bilgewater Worker]]s, [[Krazzlefrazz Officer]]s, and [[Krazzlefrazz Guard]]s. You can also loot [[Turn the Heat Around]] to start [[Turn the Heat Around]].

==Beta version==
{{rfb-section}}
The quest was initially named '''Dirty Deeds...''' and had [[Extraction Point Officer]]s and Extraction Point Deathguard as the objectives instead of Krazzlefrazz Officers, and Krazzlefrazz Guards.
