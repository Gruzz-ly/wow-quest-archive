==Objectives==
Meet with [[Lucille Waycrest]] at [[Highroad Pass]] in [[Drustvar]].

==Description==
If this coven is drawing its power from these ancient ruins, then I may just know of something that could help us fight back.

Meet me at the first fork along the Highroad Pass. There is something there I want you to see.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|98|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good, you are here.

Unfortunately it looks like we're not going to have an easy path to our destination.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Marshal, you and your men will travel to Arom's Stand. I will meet you there after a brief detour.}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|But my lady, it would be safer if--}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|I will not hear it, Marshal. This <class> will accompany me and ensure I come to no harm.}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Everit Reade|I hope you're right, my lady. Form up, men. We ride!}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Come, <name>. We ride to Highroad Pass!}}

Before leaving [[Hangman's Point]], [[Auntie Amanda Hale]] starts a breadcrumb to [[Gol Koval (quest)]].

On the way, players might pass through the [[Glenbrook Homestead]], where [[Abby Lewis]] will start [[Teddies and Tea]].

In Highroad Pass, Lucille is found kneeling beside a [[Mangled Trader]].
