==Objectives==
Listen to Helena Gentle's story in the [[Shrouded Foothills]].
* Take a seat
* [[Helena Gentle]] slain {{co|57.8|28.2|Drustvar}}

==Description==
A curse on the villagers? Oh my, how dreadful!

Although, to be honest, there have been some strange happenings around [[Fallhaven]] of late. I wonder if these could be culprit?

Take a seat and have a spot of tea. I'll tell you all that I know.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The crone is defeated, and will no longer pose a threat to the people of Fallhaven.

However, her curse on the village still lingers...>

==Notes==
Take a seat on the Stool next to her:
:{{text|say|Helena Gentie|Insipid <class>, this village is mine. The Mother has willed it!}}
:{{text|say|Helena Gentie|You should turn away now, lest you share their fate.}}
:''Helena Gentle runs away to the [[Shrouded Foothills]].''

Before running off after her, pick up [[Cracking the Curse]]. Also, just outside, a dead [[Fallhaven Villager]] starts [[Furious Familiars]].

On approach:
:{{text|yell|Helena Gentie|Foolish <class>! You dare challenge me here, in my domain!?}}

Aggro:
:{{text|say|Helena Gentie|I will show you the coven's power!}}

50% health:
:{{text|say|Helena Gentie|Our power is ancient. You will fall!}}

Death:
:{{text|say|Helena Gentie|You cannot stop... my curse...}}

The quest completes automatically upon her death.
