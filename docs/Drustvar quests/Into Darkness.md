==Objectives==
Speak with [[Ensign Josey]] to send a message to [[Katherine Proudmoore|Katherine]], then meet her at [[Gol Inath]] in the [[Crimson Forest]].
* Message to Katherine sent {{co|38.7|52.7|Drustvar}}
* Meet with Katherine {{co|26.9|58.4|Drustvar}}
* Place the Effigy {{co|27.6|58.8|Drustvar}}

==Description==
I didn't think you would find a way. Though at this point, I guess I shouldn't be surprised when you accomplish what seems impossible.

I guess all that is left is to brave the Crimson Forest and see if this thing works.

First, however, Katherine has ordered me to send word when you have found a way to [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]]. You can use one of our falcons to take a message to her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,790 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We've made it this far. There's no turning back.

==Completion==
It looks like the effigy's magic is working, but I think there's something we're missing here.

==Notes and trivia==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Inquisitor, I know that Katherine plans to join you on this mad pursuit.}}
:{{text|say|Lucille Waycrest|Protect her with your life. Kul Tiras has lost too many Proudmoores as it is.}}

Find [[Ensign Josey]] by the flight master:
:Greetings, Inquisitor!
:Lady Waycrest has instructed me to ready my fastest falcon to carry a message for you.
:{{gossip|Send word to Katherine Proudmoore to meet me at Gol Inath.}}
:{{text|say|Ensign Josey|Aye, sir! [[Hannibal]] 'ere will get yer message to [[Proudmoore Keep]] straight away!}}
: ''Josey turns to Hannibal and ties the message to the falcon's leg, who then takes off for [[Boralus]].''

Approach Katherine:
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|<Name>! You're a welcome sight!}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Those... monsters in the woods ambushed [[Proudmoore Honor Guard|my honor guard]]. I only survived thanks to their sacrifice.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Looks like we're on our own from here. Lead the way.}}

Inside:
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|This place chills my soul. It feels as if I am walking over my own grave...}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|I must steel my nerves. Jaina has braved far worse because of me.}}
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|This looks like some kind of doorway. Perhaps we should place the effigy here.}}

Place the [[Drust Effigy]]:
:{{text|say|Katherine Proudmoore|Well, that did... something...}}

During the beta, the quest was named '''Return to Katherine'''.
