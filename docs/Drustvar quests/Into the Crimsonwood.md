Meet [[Inquisitor Cleardawn]] in the [[Crimson Forest]].

==Description==
[[Master Ashton]] has been taken into the forest. He isn't the only one. [[Leandro Royston‎|Mayor Royston's]] headcount came up short.

The woods are crawling with witches. We'll have a fight on our hands if we're to save Master Ashton.
