==Objectives==
Collect 10 Quality Salvage from the [[Corlain Armory]].
* [[Quality Salvage]] (10)

==Description==
Well met, <class>.

I hope you don't mind that I took the liberty to scout ahead and assess the situation at the armory.

The good news is that there still seems to be some salvageable arms left in the armory. The bad news, of course, is that the coven is after them as well.

Additional weapons could be a great boon to our cause. I recommend we take all we can carry.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 50x [[War Resources]]
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
What did you find at the armory?

==Completion==
So the coven didn't completely clean out the armory? This is good news for us.

Even the most common villager in Drustvar can hold their own in a fight. With these arms we can turn each person we rescue to another soldier on the line.

==Notes==
On the way to the [[Corlain Armory]] for [[A Steady Ballast]], [[Inquisitor Yorrick]] offers this quest.
