==Description==
The witches of the [[Crimsonwood]] are planning a Grand Rite, a powerful ritual. They intend to rip open reality and bring their dark master through!

I suspect they may be in communion with [[Gorak Tul]]. We cannot allow their ritual to succeed.

I need you to be the tip of the spear while I protect [[Warren Ashton|Master Ashton]] and Marten. Cause havoc and disrupt their rituals!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Order of Embers]]

==Progress==
Destroy the Ritual Foci.

==Completion==
Damn!. We've slowed them down, but they are still working. To fully stop them we'll need to do more.

==Progression==
{{Stick It To 'Em!}}
