==Objectives==
Travel to [[Drustvar]] and seek out [[Quintin Whalgrene]].

==Description==
Nothing appears to be working. I can't believe I'm proposing this but I actually think we need to contact Quintin.

Well, you should, as I doubt he'll speak to me. Perhaps you could convince him to part with the other half of the recipe?

Last time I heard, he was staying in Drustvar near [[Arom's Stand]]. There's a lot of [[alchemist]]s in those parts, but he shouldn't be too hard to find.

Best not to tell him I sent you. He may not be as forthcoming with the recipe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Who do we have here? I don't suppose you're an old apprentice of my little brother, [[Elric Whalgrene|Elric]], come to learn true alchemy, are you?

<You explain to Quintin that you're researching a special transmutation stone and that he might be able to help you.>

Oh, interested in making one of those, are you? Well, just like transmutation there must be some equivalent exchange.

You're going to have to do some things for me first. You can have the pleasure of being MY apprentice.
