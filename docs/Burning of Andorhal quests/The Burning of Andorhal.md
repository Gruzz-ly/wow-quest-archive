==Objectives==
Complete your objective and escape the [[Burning of Andorhal]].
*[[Scrap of Torn Cloth]]

==Description==
I can't be sure what is waiting for us in there, but it won't be good.

We need to get in, locate the place where [[Uther]] fell and see if we can gather a few drops of his blood. From there, we need to make our way back to the inn on the west side of town and make good our escape. We should hurry, but we also need to make sure we approach this with care and respect, as my lord Uther deserves. The thought of disturbing him where he fell makes me deeply uncomfortable.

Let's get this over with.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100 [[reputation]] with the [[Argent Dawn]]
*100 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
As unsavory as this was, we've done what we came to do.

==Completion==
I assume we shouldn't be expecting the disguises to come back, so I think we have no choice but to fight our way out. Ready yourself, <name>.

==Notes==
The corpse of [[Gavinrad the Dire]] can be found by the fountain.
:{{text|whisper|Aeonas|Gavinrad the Dire. He stood shoulder to shoulder with our lord Uther the day he took his oath to become the first Paladin in the Order of the Knights of the Silver Hand. He was a legendary figure and inspiration to us all.}}

[[Uther]] and [[Arthas]] face each other near the eastern bridge.
:{{text|say|Aeonas|Uther... still lives. We weren't supposed to be here for this.}}
:{{text|say|Aeonas|What could have gone differently had Uther lived? Had that he defeated Arthas here and now? We could step, we could help... we...}}
:{{text|say|Aeonas|No. This is not why we are here. I'll honor The Lightbringer by being here for him. By bearing witness. Even if he'll never know it.}}
:{{text|say|Uther|I dearly hope that there's a special place in hell waiting for you, Arthas.}}
:{{text|say|Arthas Menethil|We may never know, Uther. I intend to live forever.}}
:''Arthas kills Uther.''
:{{text|say|Aeonas|May the light guide your path... Uther the Lightbringer.}}
:''Arthas walks away. The ghoul disguises disappear a few moments later.''
:{{text|say|Aeonas|I think our disguises are failing. Go collect the blood, but I beg you, be respectful. That man is a hero. Even in death we must take care to preserve his dignity.}}

==Progression==
{{Blood of the Lightbringer}}
