==Objectives==
Bring 1 Qiraji Magisterial Ring, 2 Azure Idols, 5 Gold Scarabs and 5 Clay Scarabs to [[Windcaller Yessendra]] in [[Silithus]]. You must also attain Honored reputation with Cenarion Circle to complete this quest.
*[[Qiraji Magisterial Ring]]
*[[Azure Idol]] (2)
*[[Gold Scarab]] (5)
*[[Clay Scarab]] (5)
*[[Cenarion Circle]] (Honored)

==Description==
The rings worn by the Qiraji lieutenants are rumored to grant them formidable abilities. The corrupted gems that adorn them could, in theory, be swapped out with more pure materials to create uncorrupted versions of the rings.

The gems that adorn Qiraji idols would work quite well, as their quality is superior.

Bring me the ring and idols and I'll create a powerful ring for you, <class>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Band of Vaulted Secrets]]

==Progress==
Did you bring me the ring and materials, <name>?

==Completion==
I will swap the gems on the ring for you.  You'll find the finished piece is much more... agreeable.
