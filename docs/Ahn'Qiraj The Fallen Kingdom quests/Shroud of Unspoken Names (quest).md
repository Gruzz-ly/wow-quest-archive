==Description==
I'm glad to hear you're aiding us in our attack on Ahn'Qiraj, <name>. I can make you a protective item that'll be of assistance in the fight against our enemy, <class>.

I shall need a [[Qiraji]] drape, which I'll resize for you of course. I'll also need idols and scarabs which I'll use to create a suitable clasp.

I promise you won't be disappointed.

You will receive:
*[[Shroud of Unspoken Names]]

==Progress==
Did you bring the materials for the cape, <name>?

==Completion==
Ah yes... this drape is immaculate.

Take this cloak, <name>.  May it protect you from the foul magic of the Qiraji.
