==Description==
The cave beyond was swarming with [[Cult of the Damned|Cult]] atrocities. There is only one way to deal with such creatures... you know what to do.

==Progress==
I cannot help but wonder whether they are naive enough to think that I will abide this or if they are simply suicidal.

==Completion==
Hearing their screams... watching the last life fade from their wretched bodies... it's invigorating, is it not?

I relish it.
