==Objectives==
Deliver Goramosh's Strange Device to the [[Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver]] at [[Agmar's Hammer]].
* [[Goramosh's Strange Device (Alliance)]] (provided)

==Description==
Picking up this strange device, you are certain that it is magical in nature. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to connote any other kind of use.

Perhaps the archmage back at Agmar's Hammer to the northeast of the Moonrest Gardens would be able to tell what it's used for?

==Progress==
What do you have there?

==Completion==
<name>, if I'm not mistaken, you've uncovered the key to allow us to discern exactly what the [[Dragonblight Mage Hunter|mage hunter]] forces are up to!

== Notes ==
Drops from [[Goramosh]].
