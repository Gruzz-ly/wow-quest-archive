==Objectives==
[[Deathguard Molder]] at [[Venomspite]] has asked you to retrieve 6 Siegesmith Bombs.
*[[Siegesmith Bomb]] (6)

==Description==
I'm tasked with the destruction of the [[Scarlet Onslaught]]'s [[ballista]]e. Unfortunately, the apothecaries and I are at odds on the use of our resources, so I've nothing to destroy them with!

To the northeast are the Carrion Fields. The [[Scourge]] siegesmiths there at their forge and [[meat wagon]]s are demolition masters.

Luckily for us, they also leave their bombs lying about.

I want you to retrieve them for me, off of the ground or the siegesmiths, I don't care which.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5||}}
*20300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|4|86|}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
You'd think that they'd let me make use of the blight spreaders... maybe load them up with something nasty to destroy the ballistae.

But no, they tell me that they're only for special missions.

Whatever!

==Completion==
<The [[deathguard]] rubs his hands together in anticipation.>

Excellent. Their loss is my... our gain!

You didn't have trouble with any of these along the way? Some of them look rather unstable. I may be undead, but I value my existence!
