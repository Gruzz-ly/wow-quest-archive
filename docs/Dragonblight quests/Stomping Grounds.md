Delve into [[Ice Heart Cavern|the cavern]] at the north end of [[the Crystal Vice]] and kill 8 Ice Heart Jormungar Feeders for [[Ko'char the Unbreakable]].
*[[Ice Heart Jormungar Feeder]] slain (8)

==Description==
Greetings little one. I know not what madness has brought you to the Crystal Vice, but you are welcome in my presence.

These ice worms... these [[jormungar]] have taken a taste to eating [[Crystalline Ice Giant|my brothers]]. I doubt you will find my kind friendly by any terms during this time of battle, but if you are hear to help with the worms, then you have my ear.

If we are first to take [[Ice Heart Cavern|the cavern]] back, we must first clear the canyon of these jormungar feeders. Join us in battle, <race>!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|18|5}}

==Progress==
The battle persists, come with good news or leave me, little one.

==Completion==
A satisfying display of slaughter.

==Notes==
Do this quest alongside [[Messy Business]] for the free debuff-cleansing item!
