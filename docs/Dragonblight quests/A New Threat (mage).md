==Objectives==
Search the [[Azure Dragonshrine]] for clues regarding the current state of the [[Nexus]].
* Take the [[Dalaran]] portal to [[Wyrmrest Temple]] (Optional)
* Travel to the Azure Dragonshrine
* Clues Found (3)
* [[Kalec's Image Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
If you seek the [[Nexus]], be wary. There are strange happenings in [[Coldarra]], and it would be best to understand them before proceeding.

During my last visit to [[Dragonblight]], I sensed unusual energies from the Azure Dragonshrine. Since this place was integral to [[Malygos]]' plans during the [[Nexus War]], whatever is there may explain the current state of the Nexus.

Here, take this image crystal. I must remain in Dalaran on [[Kirin Tor]] business, so we will speak through it. Good luck.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,050 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Progress==
The communication device is inactive.

==Completion==
This appears to be a communication device commonly utilized by the [[ethereal]]s.

Perhaps it could be the key to finding out who is behind the happenings at the Dragonshrine.

==Notes==
The quickest way to the Azure Dragonshrine is, as the quest objectives point out, the portal in the [[Portrait Room]], which is reached by standing in the central teleporter in the [[Chamber of the Guardian]].

At the Azure Dragonshrine, the forces of the [[blue dragonflight]] have been slaughtered, and [[Seething Void]]s move about the area.

Upon interacting with clues in the area, the [[Image of Kalec]] briefly appears and explains their significance.

[[Strange Portal]]:
:{{text|say|Image of Kalec|This portal is very similar to ones used by the ethereals in [[Outland]].}}
:{{text|say|Image of Kalec|Could they be the threat? What did Malygos promise them?}}

[[Void Siphon]]:
:{{text|say|Image of Kalec|This device appears to draw upon the [[void]] energy released when Malygos forced [[Azeroth]]'s [[ley line]]s into the [[Twisting Nether]].}}
:{{text|say|Image of Kalec|The design looks very familiar...}}

[[Void-Tainted Blade]]:
:{{text|say|Image of Kalec|This weapon has been infused with dark energies from the Twisting Nether.}}
:{{text|say|Image of Kalec|Whoever wielded it must be seeking to harness void energy. But for what purpose?}}

After interacting with all three types of clues, head to the southeastern corner of the Dragonshrine to find the [[Ethereal Communication Device]].
:{{text|say|Image of Kalec|Yet more evidence of ethereal technology. This may be an unfortunate turn.}}
:{{text|say|Image of Kalec|There's only one way to find out who's really behind this.}}

==Progression==
{{Mage artifact and class hall}}
