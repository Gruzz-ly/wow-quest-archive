==Objectives==
[[Kilix the Unraveler]] at the [[Pit of Narjun]] in the [[Dragonblight]] has asked that you slay 6 Anub'ar Underlords.
*[[Anub'ar Underlord]] slain (6)

==Description==
We are in the midst of a civil war. At the heart of this world the last living members of [[Nerubian|my species]] defend themselves against total annihilation. The [[Lich King]] seeks to rule the kingdom of [[Azjol-Nerub]] at any cost. Those that do not acquiesce are branded enemies of the [[Scourge]] and marked for death.

In [[Arthas Menethil|Arthas]] we both have an enemy...

Join our cause and rid this place of the taint of [[Anub'ar]]! Let [[Anub'arak]] himself hear the anguish of their death cries!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*20300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|4|86|}} compensation at level 80)

==Progress==
The [[Azjol-Nerub (kingdom)|Azjol Empire]] will rise again!

==Completion==
There are thousands more and they spill out from every dark crevice in Northrend. Alone you stand no chance, but together... Maybe...
