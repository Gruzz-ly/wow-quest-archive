==Objectives==
[[File:Ley Focus.jpg|thumb|The Ley Line Focus]]
Obtain the [[Ley Line Focus Control Ring]] and use it to gain information from the Ley Line Focus on the [[Glittering Strand]].

Then, return to the [[Image of Archmage Modera]] at [[Stars' Rest]].
* Ley line focus information retrieved

==Description==
The mage hunter forces are active on the Glittering Strand south of [[Moonrest Gardens]]. My guess is that you'll find a heaving guarded focus on the beach and a captain who is in charge of it.

No doubt the captain will have some sort of controlling device on their person. Get the controller and use it on the focus.

With any luck, we'll be able to get some more information about what they're really up to out there.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
What news do you bring from the beach, <class?>

==Completion==
How very odd that it imprinted this information upon you magically.

So, not only do we know that they've redirected the flow of the power coming out of the Moonrest Gardens, but we now know that the power is being purposefully changed in some way. Just what are they up to with all of that magic?

I don't like where this is leading, <name>, not one bit!

== Notes ==
*[[Captain Emmy Malin]] is located near the big Ley Line Focus ring on the beach. She also drops [[Captain Malin's Letter]] to start another quest.
*Use the Focus Control Ring to channel information from the Ley Line Focus. You will gain the buff:
{{Effecttip
|name=Ley Line Information
|description=The magical energies are being redirected and repurposed by the mage hunter forces.
|icon=spell_arcane_focusedpower
|etype=buff
|float=none

}}
Then you can return to Archmage Modera.
