*[[Head of High Cultist Zangus]]

==Description==
I witnessed his treachery with my own eyes! The traitor led an Anub'ar assault on this stronghold, taking out some of my best soldiers.

<Gort shakes his head.>

He'd been working with the Scourge the whole time and we didn't have a clue! How many more like Zangus are there? We'll find 'em all and when we do...

<Gort makes a cutting motion across his neck.>

First on the list is Zangus. Our scouts report that he is hiding in The Pit of Narjun, west of here. Find him, kill him, bring me his head.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*20300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|4|86|}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
Is that a severed orc head in your pack or are you just happy to see me?

==Completion==
<Gort holds the head up and stares into its dead eyes.>

I told you we'd get you...

Here's your reward, <class>. That's one less headache for us to worry about.
