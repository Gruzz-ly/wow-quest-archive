==Objectives==
Recover Thel'zan's Phylactery from [[Icestorm]] and return it to [[High Commander Halford Wyrmbane]] at [[Wintergarde Keep]].
*[[Thel'zan's Phylactery]]

==Description==
Your [[frost wyrm|frostwyrm]] is out there.

<Tyralion points west.>

And it's a big one!

When you're ready to fight, go speak to [["Wyrmbait"]]. He'll "fetch" her. Once Icestorm is close enough we'll chain her to the ground and finish her off! Hopefully, with your help, we'll be able to take her down and get you that [[phylactery]].

Once you've got the phylactery, return to Wintergarde Keep and report to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane. He's been making preparations for the final showdown with [[Thel'zan the Duskbringer|Thel'zan]].

==Rewards==

You will also receive: {{cost|15|39}}

==Progress==
Have you recovered Thel'zan's phylactery?

==Completion==
We've lost so many good soldiers to that bastard, Thel'zan. I wish I could be there to see you crush his phylactery in front him and end his existence.

Talk to "Wyrmbait":
{{Dialogue|Awaiting orders!

{{Gossip|Wyrmbait, eh? Welp, go fetch us Icestorm!}}}}

:{{Text|say|"Wyrmbait"|I'll flush her out, <name>! You just be ready for her when she comes in!}}

Wyrmbait flies to the west on his gryphon, causing Icestorm to appear in the distance and fly toward the 7th Legion Front.
:{{Text|yell|Legion Commander Tyralion|FIRE! FIRE! BRING HER DOWN!}}

Stay back near the harpoon launchers and wait for them to automatically chain Icestorm down, then nuke her from range. The friendly NPCs should help kill her. If that's not feasible, she can be attacked from melee range as well, but be warned that she will hit back. Consider using a cooldown or two to speed up the fight. Don't worry about tagging her, as she'll drop the phylactery on the ground when killed:
:{{Text|bossemote|Thel'zan's phylactery drops to the ground beneath Icestorm.}}

Loot it and head back to Wintergarde.
