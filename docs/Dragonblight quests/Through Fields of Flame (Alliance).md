== Objectives ==
Enter the [[Ruby Dragonshrine]] from one of the northern or southern passes, then kill 6 Frigid Necromancers and eliminate the source of the corruption under the shrine. Return to [[Ceristrasz]] once the task is complete.
* [[Frigid Necromancer]] slain: (6)
* [[Dahlia Suntouch|Ruby Corruption]] Cleansed

== Description ==
I have one final task for you, <race>... one that should turn the tide of this fight.

Return to the shrine and kill the [[necromancer]]s that are fueling this onslaught. With them dead, we should be able to beat these forces back and eventually retake the shrine.

I also need you to find the source of the corruption and put an end to it.

I know I have asked a lot of you, but if you do this for me, we will win this battle.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Treads of the Charred Canyon|Scourgeslayer Belt|Wyrmfire Gloves|Conscript's Ruby Waistguard}}
You will also receive: {{cost|11|80}}

== Progress ==
You've returned! Have you don as I've asked of you?

== Completion ==
[[Dahlia Suntouch|Dahlia]]... they turned her?

Dahlia has been loyal to us for a very long time... if they can corrupt a being of her devotion, it does not bode well for the rest of the young races. Thank you for freeing her. I hope she has found some peace.

You have honored us with your selfless assistance today, <race>. I will send word to the council of what your kind have accomplished here. Go with our blessing.

== Notes ==
Slay Dahlia Suntouch. She drops the [[Ruby Brooch]]. A script event also takes place:
:{{text|say|Remnant of Dahlia Suntouch|I've lived here and kept this shrine with the blessing of [[Alexstrasza]] for longer than I can remember. In it's darkest hour, I've failed... I fell at the feet of that damned [[death knight|deathknight]]... [[Orbaz Bloodbane|Bloodbane]].}}
:{{text|emote|Dahlia spits on the ground at the thought of the name.}}
:{{text|say|Remnant of Dahlia Suntouch|The [[Lich King]] is stretching his hand far now... fearlessly treading on the most sacred lands of all the flights. He intends to force us to action.}}
:{{text|say|Remnant of Dahlia Suntouch|My time is done... I offered myself to Alexstrasza in life, but I have nothing left to offer in death. She will need a new keeper for her shrine.}}
:{{text|say|Remnant of Dahlia Suntouch|And thank you... thank you for freeing me from the [[Undead|shackles of the damned]]. You are a hero... I know you will go on to great deeds.}}
