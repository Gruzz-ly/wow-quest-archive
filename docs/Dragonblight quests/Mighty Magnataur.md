==Description==
Magnataur are hideously violent creatures... this is the main reason we rarely see them come together in any real numbers without killing each other. A powerful leader has stepped up somewhere among them and we need to hunt him down if we are to stop this threat.

I will start asking around. I need you to disrupt them as much as possible in the meantime.

East of here are 3 torches erected. Near them are 3 dominant Magnataur - put them down to buy us some time to hunt down this leader.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|30}}

==Progress==
Have you defeated the magnataur?

==Completion==
Excellent work. No one could tell me who this leader might be, but I was able to uncover the name of someone who will have our answer.

==Progression==
{{Magnataur of Dragonblight}}
