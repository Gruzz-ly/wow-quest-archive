== Objectives ==
Collect 12 Snowfall Glade Pups. Deliver them to [[Trapper Mau'i]] at [[Moa'ki Harbor]].
* [[Snowfall Glade Pup (item)]] (12)

== Description ==
We must move decisively against the [[wolvar]] if we're to have a chance of survival. However, I worry that in our zeal, too many of them will be slain.

The [[Snowfall Glade]] wolvar have as much right to exist as do we. You and I will see to it that they get that chance.

If [[Elder Ko'nani]] hasn't asked you already, he will ask you to deal with them. While you're upon the glade to the north, I'd like you to bag up their pups and bring them to me.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

== Progress ==
How many pups could you have possibly saved in so short a time?

== Completion ==
Well, I guess you saved plenty of them. Thank you, <race>.

Now the wolvar have a chance of surviving along with us. If we survive at all, that is.

==Notes==
*You must have bag space to pick up the pups.
*Turn off all AOE abilities as they can hit the pups and kill them.
*[[Hunter]]s and [[druid]]s can use [[Track Humanoids]] to more easily spot the huts containing pups. They'll appear as yellow dots on the [[minimap]].
*If you are mounted, you will get a warning that you cannot do that while mounted, but it will not dismount you.

==Progression==
{{:Let Nothing Go To Waste}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
