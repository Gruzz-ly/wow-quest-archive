==Objectives==
Travel to the ring of torches south of the [[Azure Dragonshrine]] and blow the [[Emblazoned Battle Horn]]. Defeat [[Grom'thar the Thunderbringer]] and bring his head back to [[Aurastrasza]] at [[Wyrmrest Temple|Wyrmrest]].
*[[Grom'thar's Head]]
Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
There's no reason to suspect [[Dregmar Runebrand|Dregmar]]'s words are anything but true. Whether Grom'thar defeats you or is defeated by you, he can wash her hands of this.

Follow his instructions... take the horn that you brought me earlier, travel to the ring of torches south of the Azure Dragonshrine, and blow it to announce your challenge.

When Grom'thar the Thunderbringer arrives, kill him and bring me his head.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Battered Magnataur Dualblade|Longbow of the Ruby Rider|Shortblade of the Ruby Ally|Taigasha|Emme's Lost Spellblade|Life Binder Talisman}}
You will also receive: {{cost|16|80}}

==Progress==
Did you end this threat for good?

==Completion==
You are formidable indeed.

With Grom'thar the Thunderbringer gone, we can leave the remaining Magnataur to fight among themselves and turn our attentions back to more prominent threats.

Impressive work, <class>.

==Progression==
{{Magnataur of Dragonblight}}
