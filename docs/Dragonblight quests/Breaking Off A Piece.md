==Objectives==
[[Yord "Calamity" Icebeard]] at the [[Wintergarde Mausoleum]] in [[Dragonblight]] wants you to kill Necrolord X'avius, Necrolord Horus, and 15 [[Naxxramas]] Scourge.
* [[Necrolord X'avius]] slain
* [[Necrolord Horus]] slain
* Naxxramas Scourge slain (15)

==Description==
Just down the steps lies the gateway to damnation: [[Scourge]] as far as the eye can see and getting thicker with each passing moment. What little intelligence we've been able to gather indicates that two Scourge necrolords are furiously working at emptying the two crypts down below. Before we can breach the inner chamber to [[Thel'zan the Duskbringer|Thel'zan]], we'll need to take care of those two clowns and their Naxxramas cronies.

Go down into the mausoleum and take out the necrolords and the [[Naxxramas Dreadguard|Naxxramas dreadguards]] and [[Naxxramas Shade|shades]].
