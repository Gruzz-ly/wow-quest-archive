==Objectives==
[[Emissary Brighthoof]] at the [[Westwind Refugee Camp]] in the [[Dragonblight]] wants you to recover 10 Horde Armaments.
* [[Horde Armaments]] (10)

==Description==
Before we can officially bring these [[taunka]] into the [[Horde]] we must recover our armaments from the [[Anub'ar]] [[Nerubian]]s that infest the nearby woods. The armaments were lost when a caravan from [[Agmar's Hammer]] was ambushed by the [[Scourge]] late last night.

Venture out into the woods to the east of Westwind Refugee Camp and recover those armaments, <race>.

==Progress==
Without armor and weapons our newest members will be defenseless in their trek to Agmar's Hammer.

==Completion==
This is exactly what we need, <name>! Brandishing Horde arms will lift their spirits and give them the protection they need against the Scourge.

Are you prepared for the ceremony of initiation?

<Brighthoof nods.>

You will be the one to admit our new allies into the Horde.
