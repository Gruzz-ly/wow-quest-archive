==Description==
Whatever was written on the remaining pages of [[Plunderbeard]]'s journal must be recovered. Search the chambers located on the other side of this tunnel for Plunderbeard's assailants. They must be the ones who tore the journal apart!

Should you recover the missing pages, return them to Ambo Cash at the entrance of the Wintergarde Mausoleum.

==Progress==
I certainly don't feel like a winner...

==Completion==
<Ambo reads through the recovered journal pages.>

There's some good news and some bad news. Which do you want first?

Ah hell, why give you a choice? The good news is that if we can get [[Thel'zan the Duskbringer|Thel'zan]]'s [[phylactery]], we can destroy him. The bad news is that the phylactery is on a rather large [[frost wyrm|frostwyrm]].

==Notes==
Pick mobs at random. If lucky, one mob will have all four pages. If not, it could take some time.

==Progression==
