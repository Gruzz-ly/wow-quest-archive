==Objectives==
Gather 8 bundles of Composite Ore from the digs surrounding [[Galakrond's Rest]] and bring them to [[Xink]] at [[Nozzlerust Post]].
*[[Composite Ore]]: (8)

==Description==
Hello hello! The [[Scourge]] to the south are digging up some ancient [[dragon]] thing. I could care less why they're doing it, but they're pulling cartloads of composite ore in the process.

Go lift me a bunch of that ore. That stuff should yield a pretty penny for all the weapons the [[Horde]] are crafting.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Progress==
Did you get the ore? My carrier will be back shortly - we need to get this shipment out while the fight's still going!

==Completion==
Hah! That's quite a load. Your back feeling alright?
