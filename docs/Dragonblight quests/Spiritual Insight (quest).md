== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Toalu'u the Mystic]] at [[Moa'ki Harbor]] after you have attained your spiritual insight.
* Spiritual insight concering Indu'le Village attained.
* [[Toalu'u's Spiritual Incense]] (provided)

== Description ==
<Race>, we have not heard from our people at [[Indu'le Village]] since the ground shook and the land was torn apart!

Have you ever been upon a vision quest? You've bested [[Loguhn]], so you must be capable.

I will give you a special incense to sprinkle into my brazier. Breathe deep from its vapors and your spirit will be sent aloft to view what has happened at Indu'le.

As your spirit soars, I will be able to look through your eyes.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

== Progress ==
What do you think?

== Completion ==
[[Ghost]]s and gibbering madness? This cannot be!

We must seek further guidance.

==Notes==
Using the Spiritual Incense starts a [[Cut Scene#Tour|Tour]].
:''Your spirit appears as a wisp that flies up and out of Toalu'u's hut.

:{{Text|whisper|Toalu'u the Mystic|You've successfully freed your spirit!  You can serve as my eyes.  Together we'll get to the bottom of this.}}
:''Your spirit flies to Indu'le Village, largely following the path into the village from the east.
:{{Text|whisper|Toalu'u the Mystic|You're coming up on the village now.  Keep your eyes peeled.}}
:''You turn south and go to the south shore of the lake.
:{{Text|whisper|Toalu'u the Mystic|What's happened to the lake bed?  Strange power is pouring out of it.}}
:''You continue clockwise along the lake.
:{{Text|whisper|Toalu'u the Mystic|No... no!  My people are all dead spirits or deranged!}}
:{{Text|whisper|Toalu'u the Mystic|Elder Mana'loa, the statue there, sees you.  This is a good sign!}}
:''You complete your circuit of the village and head back south and east.
:{{Text|whisper|Toalu'u the Mystic|Come back, <name>.  If you're out of your body for too long, you run the risk of not being able to return.  We have much to discuss.}}
