==Objectives==
Deliver [[Captain Emmy Malin|Captain Malin's]] Letter to [[Commander Saia Azuresteel]] at [[Stars' Rest]].
* [[Captain Malin's Letter]] (provided)

==Description==
You find a letter secreted in the lining of her robes. It reads:

"Father,

I'm sorry for disappearing on you. If you're reading this letter, then I'm dead.

I've been forced to work for [[Malygos|Malygos's]] armies under threat that our family would be killed if I didn't. I feel so ashamed.

If there's anything that you can do to fight them, don't worry about me. I have them fooled and I'm sabotaging them from the inside.

I love you, Daddy!

Em"

Commander Saia Azuresteel will want to see this!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
A letter for me?

<The commander studies your face a moment.>

I suppose not... must be bad news.

==Completion==
Oh no... and we sent you down there to kill her, didn't we?

<The commander shakes her head and sighs.>

I'm sorry. I'll see to it that the letter is delivered to her father, [[Archmage Malin]] in [[Stormwind]], right away. Don't worry, you won't be implicated... it wasn't your fault.

Try to put it out of your mind. There was no way that you could have known, <name>.

==Notes==
A few days later, players will receive a letter from Archmage Malin.

{{book|A letter from Archmage Malin|content=
Dear <name>,

Commander Azuresteel's personal courier saw to it that I received my daughter's letter. The courier also told me that it was you who found it. 

I just want to thank you for seeing to it that the letter got to me. I know that times must be tough for all of you brave souls who are daring to fight in [[Northrend]]. 

Rest assured that I will avenge Emmy. The blue dragonflight will suffer for what they did to my little girl! 

With the utmost respect and gratitude, 

Archmage Malin}}
