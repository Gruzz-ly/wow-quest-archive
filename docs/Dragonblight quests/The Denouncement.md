==Objectives==
[[High Executor Wroth]] at [[Venomspite]] has tasked you with using the [[Rod of Compulsion]] on [[Commander Jordan]], [[Lead Cannoneer Zierhut]], [[Blacksmith Goodman]], and [[Stable Master Mercer]].

Once the rod has been used on them, kill each to exact a denouncement of the [[Scarlet Onslaught]] as their final words.
*Commander Jordan's denouncement & death
*Lead Cannoneer Zierhut's denouncement & death
*Blacksmith Goodman's denouncement & death
*Stable Master Mercer's denouncement & death
*[[Rod of Compulsion]] (provided)

==Description==
It's time for us to utterly demoralize the Onslaught forces!

I want you to take the rod and use it on four of their leaders: Commander Jordan upstairs at the [[barracks]], Lead Cannoneer Zierhut down the southeast ramp overlooking the beach, Blacksmith Goodman at the [[Blacksmith|smithy]], and Stable Master Mercer at the [[stables]].

Place them under the rod's compulsion, concentrate on making them denounce the Onslaught, and then kill them!  

==Completion==
<You think you see just the hint of a smile cross Wroth's face before quickly disappearing.>

You're now my favorite <class>, <name>. If you have a mind to, I'd like you to think about joining up as an officer in the Hand of Vengeance.

We can start you out as a deathguard, and in a few decades I think you have what it takes to make junior executor!

No? Well don't be too hasty... take your time and mull it over.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Robe of Calcified Tears|Torturer's Fleshwoven Leggings|Paingiver Wristguards|Sabatons of the Enforcer}}

*{{cost|10|60|}}
*25,690 [[XP]] (or {{cost|9|24|}} compensation at level 80)

==Notes==
The denouncements:
*{{text|yell|[[Blacksmith Goodman]]|You are being misled! The Onslaught is all lies! The Scourge and the Forsaken are not our enemies! Wake up!}}
*{{text|yell|[[Commander Jordan]]|[[Brigitte Abbendis|High General Abbendis]] personally told me that it was a mistake to come north and that we're doomed! I urge you all to lay down your weapons and leave before it's too late!}}
*{{text|yell|[[Stable Master Mercer]]|Abbendis is nothing but a harlot and [[Grand Admiral Westwind]] is selling her cheap like he sold us out!}}
*{{text|yell|[[Lead Cannoneer Zierhut]]|Renounce the Scarlet Onslaught! Don't listen to the lies of the high general and the grand admiral any longer!}}
