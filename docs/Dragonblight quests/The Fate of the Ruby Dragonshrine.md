Bring [[Dahlia Suntouch]]'s Ruby Brooch to [[Krasus]] in the Ruling Council Chamber at [[Wyrmrest Temple]] and inform him of Dahlia's fate.
* [[Ruby Brooch]]

== Description ==
As you pick up the brooch, its faint glow brightens slightly.

Krasus will want to know of Dahlia's fate. Take the brooch to him at Wyrmrest.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|50}}

== Progress ==
Hello, <race>. I sense the presence of my Ruby Brooch.

What has become of Dahlia?

== Completion ==
Dahlia was taken by the [[Scourge]]? This is a sad day for all of us.

I will look to finding a new keeper once the shrine is retaken. Thank you for your efforts... the [[Ruby Dragonshrine]] is a sacred place to us, and the sacrifices your kind have made will not be easily forgotten.

It is good to know there are still heroes such as you - I will call upon you one day.  Until that day comes, may your adventures be fruitful.
