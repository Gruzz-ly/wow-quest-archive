==Objectives==
Collect 2 Vials of Corrosive Spit from the [[Jormungar]] by using [[Zort's Scraper|the scraper]] on yourself. Bring the vials back to [[Zort]] in [[the Crystal Vice]] when your task is complete.
*[[Vial of Corrosive Spit]] (2)

==Description==
Even at first glance, the [[Sample of Rockflesh|sample]] you brought me shows obvious signs of some kind of corrosive spit. It would be the natural assumption that the same substance these worms use to burrow through the ground as allowed them a formidable weapon against the [[Crystalline Ice Giant|Ice Giants]].

Take this scraper and pick a fight with some of the worms. When they spit on you, use the scraper to remove it and bring it back to me.

Get me a couple samples - I'm going to have to use it as the base for an elixir.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|18|5}}

==Progress==
You seem to still have some spit on your shoulder there, <race>. Be careful or it will burn right through your armor.

==Completion==
Still fresh. Just a moment and I will mix this with the rest of the elixir that I have prepared.

==Notes==
Do this quest alongside Stomping Grounds, which is unlocked on acceptance:

:{{text|whisper|[[Ko'char the Unbreakable]]|Let us speak a momment, <race>.}}

Go pick a fight, do damage to the mob, wait for it to cast Corrosive Spit, then use the item while debuffed and finish off the mob.

==Progression==
