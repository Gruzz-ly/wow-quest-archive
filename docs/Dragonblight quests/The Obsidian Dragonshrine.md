== Objectives ==
Travel to the [[Obsidian Dragonshrine]] northwest of [[Wyrmrest Temple]] and just west of the [[Angrathar the Wrathgate|Wrath Gate]]. Locate [[Serinar]] there and offer him your aid.

== Description ==
The [[Scourge]] come. [[Korialstrasz]] calls upon his allies in a futile attempt to save their [[Ruby Dragonshrine]], but it seems the good graces of the [[red dragonflight|red flight]] don't extend to saving the shrines of the other flights.

Surprised? I'm not.

There is another of my brood who has left to clear our Obsidian Dragonshrine and the [[undead]] vermin that now infest it. All it would take to prove yourself more noble and righteous than [[Alexstrasza]] herself is a quick jaunt over there and a few swings of a blade.

I'm amused.

== Completion ==
I'm trying to decide at which I'm more surprised... that you actually came to the aid of a [[black dragonflight|Black Dragon]] or that you're still in one piece after speaking with [[Nalice]].

Her words drop venom, but I suppose Wyrmrest can keep even our kind in check sometimes.

Or perhaps it's just the armies of the red dragonflight that are massed around her.

== Notes ==
Serinar is inside the [[Maw of Neltharion]].
