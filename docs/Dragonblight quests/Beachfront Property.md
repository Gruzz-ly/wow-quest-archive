==Objectives==
[[Surveyor Hansen]], just north of the [[Forgotten Shore (Dragonblight)|Forgotten Shore]], has asked you to slay 20 Forgotten ghosts.
*Forgotten ghosts slain (20)

==Description==
It's time for [[Venomspite]] to expand!

We'll take care of the [[Scarlet Onslaught|Onslaught]] in due time, but I want you to spearhead our efforts on the Forgotten Shore. The property value has outstanding potential and just look at that view!

Unfortunately, there's an infestation of human ghosts, shipwrecked crews and the like who haven't quite realized that they're dead.

Clear the beach and the waters off the shore, and maybe you and I will talk about building a cozy, new mausoleum down there soon.  

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*20300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|4|86|}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
Why is it that I doubt your sincerity when you suggest that you've done all that you can to clear the shore of those ghosts?

==Completion==
Can't you just see it now, <class>? It'll be the vacation spot of Northrend!

What do you think of the name, "Hansen's Cove", or maybe "<name> Bay"? Kind of catchy, don't you think?

==Notes==
*[[Forgotten Captain]]s, [[Forgotten Knight]]s, [[Forgotten Footman|Forgotten Footmen]], [[Forgotten Rifleman|Forgotten Riflemen]] and [[Forgotten Peasant]]s count.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
