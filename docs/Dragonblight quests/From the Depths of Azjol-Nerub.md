== Objectives ==
Explore the [[Pit of Narjun]] and return with your findings to [[Senior Sergeant Juktok]] at [[Agmar's Hammer]].
* Pit of Narjun Explored

== Description ==
The undead Nerubians that attacked Icemist Village came from a gigantic sinkhole known as the Pit of Narjun. If left alone, those fiends will no doubt flank our forces at the Wrathgate and end our march to victory.

I need eyes on the ground, <name>. You are to head west and investigate the Pit of Narjun. We need to locate their primary exit point and seal it off! Find me that location. 

== Completion ==
That damned sinkhole must be directly connected to Azjol-Nerub. This is worse than I thought.

<Juktok pauses to think for a moment.>

Seek and destroy... That'll be the next course of action.
