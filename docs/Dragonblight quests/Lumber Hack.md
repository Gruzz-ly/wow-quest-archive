==Objectives==
Use [[Xink's Shredder Control Device]] to call a [[Shredder]] once you reach the [[Coldwind Heights|Harpy Nesting Grounds]] in the North. Gather 50 Bundles of Lumber from the trees in the area, and then return to [[Xink]] at [[Nozzlerust Post]].
*[[Coldwind Lumber (quest item)]] (50)

==Description==
Next up, we need to haul in some lumber for all the towers the [[Alliance]] are building. There are some trees to the south, but the trees the [[Harpy|Harpies]] are nesting in to the north look much more fit for structures.

Take this. When you get to the Harpy nesting area, use the control and one of my Shredders should come to you. Gather as much lumber as it can carry. The Harpies are sure to disagree with you chopping down their homes - just deal with them as necessary.

Hop to it!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Mounted Boneshredder|Coldwind Scratching Pole|Composite Harpyspine Staff|Compact Explosive Delivery Device|Reactive Waraxe|Infused Dragonbone Splinter}}
You will also receive: {{cost|18|5}}

==Progress==
Where's that carrier? Hope the [[Jormungar]] didn't get him. He was carrying a good sized load that time.

==Completion==
If a tree falls in the forest, and you can't hear it through the saw blade, does it really make a sound?

==Notes==
This quest is intended to be completed alongside [[Harp on This!]] so players aren't killing the same mobs twice for no good reason.

As soon as you get in to Coldwind Heights, use Xink's device to call down [[Xink's Shredder]] and hop in.
