'''Rifle the Bodies''' starts the main [[blue dragonflight]] questline in [[Dragonblight]].

There are three breadcrumbs pointing to Stars' Rest: from [[Wintergarde Keep]] ([[A Disturbance In The West]]) and [[Moa'ki Harbor]] ([[Your Presence is Required at Stars' Rest]]) in [[Dragonblight]], and from [[Death's Stand]] ([[The Lost Courier]]) in [[Borean Tundra]], all of which are optional.

==Objectives==
Find the Moonrest Gardens Plans and return them to the [[Image of Archmage Modera]] at Stars' Rest.
* [[Moonrest Gardens Plans]]

==Description==
The [[Moonrest Gardens]] to the southwest were the final resting place of a noble group of [[Highborne]] elves. It was also a powerful [[ley line]] nexus.

The [[blue dragonflight]] used a magical device they call a [[Surge Needle|surge needle]] to destroy that nexus, freeing the power to redirect at their will.

I need more information and I hope that you will get it for me.

After the upheaval at the ruins, the ghosts of the Highborne rose up and decimated half of the [[Dragonblight Mage Hunter|mage hunters]] present. Go rifle [[Dead Mage Hunter|their corpses]] for clues.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
You have returned. What did you uncover?

==Completion==
Curious. They seek an accord with the [[ethereum]]. The [[ethereal]]s could prove a powerful ally for [[Malygos]] and his madness.

This will not do!
