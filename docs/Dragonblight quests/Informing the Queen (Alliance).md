== Objectives ==
Deliver your Letter of Introduction to Wyrmrest Temple to [[Alexstrasza the Life-Binder]] at [[Wyrmrest Temple]].
* [[Letter of Introduction to Wyrmrest Temple (Alliance)]] (provided)

== Description ==
<The [[Tariolstrasz|dragon steward]] pulls your letter of introduction out of his sleeve>

Yes... yes, I think that you are ready to see the queen now.

When you are ready, speak to me again and I will see to it that one of these [[drake]]s delivers you safely to the top of the temple. You will need to present your letter in person to Queen Alexstrasza.

== Progress ==
It is good to finally meet you in person, <name>. I have known you since before you were born.

== Completion ==
You are very courageous to bring us this information. I was beginning to wonder why the [[blue dragonflight]] had so boldly initiated an attack on the temple itself. Now we know that they are using enormous amounts of the very magic they view as a threat to [[Azeroth]].

<The queen shakes her head in seeming resignation.>

Hypocritical, but so be it. If [[Malygos]] does not come to his senses, we have no choice but to take action in response to their assault.
