==Objectives==
[[Spy Mistress Repine]] has asked you to slay [[Deathguard Schneider]], [[Senior Scrivener Kinnedius]], [[Engineer Burke]], and [[Chancellor Amai]].

When you've accomplished this task, report your success to [[High Executor Wroth]] at [[Venomspite]].

*Deathguard Schneider slain
*Senior Scrivener Kinnedius slain
*Engineer Burke slain
*Chancellor Amai slain

==Description==
We have more fools for you to kill.

My agents tell me that several of our good citizens have seen fit to fall into the hands of the Scarlet Onslaught.

This will not do.

Go back to New Hearthglen and eliminate Deathguard Schneider, Senior Scrivener Kinnedius, Engineer Burke and Chancellor Amai.

From what I hear, they're spread out throughout the area. No doubt they are being kept in cages awaiting torture.

Speak with them and then kill them!  

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5}}
*20300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|4|86|}} compensation at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
It's simple really. You're sent out to kill four incompetent fools that are likely to blab all of our secrets anytime now, and you go out and do it.

<The high executor puts on an unholy grin.>

==Completion==
What? You were expecting us to have you rescue them?

Now why would we do that when they have a proven track record of getting themselves captured in the first place?

Northrend is a cold place, young <name>. I suggest that you adjust to it.

==Notes==
:{{Text|say|Deathguard Schneider|Hey, over here!}}
:Think you could get me out of here, <class>?

::{{Text|say|Deathguard Schneider|What do you mean my time has come?! I'll kill you where you stand!}}
:{{Gossip|Can you tell me where they have Chancellor Amai caged?}}

::I think they put him in a cage over near the lumbermill.
:{{Gossip|Did you see where they took Sanitation Engineer Burke?}}
::I think he's on the south side of the abbey.

:{{Text|say|Chancellor Amai|I just arrived in Venomspite. How could I have possibly wronged you?}}
:I don't know what happened. I had just arrived at Venomspite and then all of a sudden I woke up in this cage!

:Are you there to rescue me?
:{{Gossip|No, chancellor, I wouldn't say that I'm here to 'rescue' you, per se.}}
::{{Text|say|Chancellor Amai|What is the meaning of this?! Stop! I'll double whatever they're paying you!}}

:{{Gossip|Any idea where they're keeping Deathguard Schneider?}}
::I think they have her down near the gallows.

:{{Text|say|Senior Scrivener Kinnedius|If you'd be so kind, please let me out of here!}}
