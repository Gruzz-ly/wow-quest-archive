==Objectives==
[[Zelig the Visionary]] at [[Wintergarde Keep]] in [[Dragonblight]] wants you to recover his Scrying Orb.
* [[Scrying Orb (Dragonblight)]]

==Description==
The memories of the past haunt this land, <name>. I hear the cries of the fallen echo across [[Northrend]] - calling to me.

[[Arthas]] left a terrible imprint on everything he touched. Only wither and decay remains in his wake. It is important, then, for us to study the past so that we may better know our enemy. Perhaps untold truths shall surface that could help in our campaign.

First, you must recover my scrying orb from the [[town hall]], <name>. Exit this tower and turn left down the path to reach the town square.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Have you recovered my scrying orb?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. As fate foretold, you will be the one to carry us through these hard times. Now the long journey begins.

==Notes==
The orb is on the upper floor of the building with the belltower, whose entrance is at {{coords|79.6|50.5|Dragonblight}}.
