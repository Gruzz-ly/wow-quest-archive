==Objectives==
Aid [[Captain Drayzen]] in holding the canyons by participating in the death of 12 [[Frigid Ghoul Attacker]]s, 8 [[Frigid Geist Attacker]]s, and 1 [[Frigid Abomination Attacker]].

Return to [[Vargastrasz]] once you have finished this task.
* [[Frigid Ghoul Attacker]] slain (12)
* [[Frigid Geist Attacker]] slain (8)
* [[Frigid Abomination Attacker]] slain

==Description==
The [[Scourge]] have overrun the shrine. The shrine's keeper, [[Dahlia Suntouch]], is nowhere to be found. The red wyrms that fell in the shrine's defense now beset us in the form of twisted skeletal [[emberwyrm]]s. The situation is dire, <race>.

Captain Drayzen leads a group of your kind in stemming the flow of the Scourge out of the shrine.

Go to his aid... but please stay behind his men. The flow of Scourge is endless and I don't want to lose you in one of those scarred canyons. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Progress==
I'm glad you're still with us, <race>.

==Completion==
It is a disgusting task, but I thank you for doing it.

The Scourge cannot be permitted to push any further out of the shrine lest all of these lands be overrun.

==Progression==
