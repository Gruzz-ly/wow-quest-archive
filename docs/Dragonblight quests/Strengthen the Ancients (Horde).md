==Objectives==
Use the [[:Bark of the Walkers]] to strengthen 3 Lothalor Ancients and then return to [[Earthwarden Grife]] at [[Agmar's Hammer]].
* [[Lothalor Ancient]] strengthened (3)

==Description==
The ancients of the [[Lothalor Woodlands|Lothalor Woods]] to the south are being corrupted by [[Arcane Wyrm (Dragonblight)|arcane wyrm]]s... wyrms which have risen out of the ground!

Those that are already corrupted are deadly and of no use to us, but most can still be saved. Luckily, the [[Woodlands Walker|treant]]s of the woods seem to be immune to everything happening up there.

Ask the treants for their bark and when you get some, feed it to the [[Lothalor Ancient|ancient]]s. This should strengthen them.

Now leave me to my business! I have to keep an eye on these apothecaries.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Bracers of Nature's Fury
|Lothalar Woodwalker Belt
|Star's Rest Treads
|Bark Covered Pauldrons
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|5||}}
*20300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|4|86}} at level 80)

==Progress==
If we can save the ancients before the dryads and night elves of Stars' Rest, perhaps they will consider allying with the Horde.

Or at least, perhaps they'll think twice about attacking us.

Now, how many have you managed to save so far?

==Completion==
You have my thanks, <class>.

As soon as I am done observing what these disgusting apothecaries are up to, I'll head to the woods and see if I can convince these ancients to side with us.

Or, if nothing else, I'll convince them not to attack those that saved them!
