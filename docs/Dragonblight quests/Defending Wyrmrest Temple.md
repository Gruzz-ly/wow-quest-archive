The [[Rifle the Bodies]] quest chains must be complete before Devrestrasz will offer this quest.

==Objectives==
[[Lord Devrestrasz|Devrestrasz]] at [[Wyrmrest Temple]] has asked you to slay 3 Azure Dragons, slay 5 Azure Drakes, and to destabilize the Azure Dragonshrine while riding a [[Wyrmrest Defender]] into battle.
* [[Azure Dragon]] slain (3)
* [[Azure Drake]] slain (5)
* Destabilize the [[Azure Dragonshrine]]

==Description==
Emboldened by the overabundance of magic now flowing through the Azure Dragonshrine, the [[blue dragonflight]] has dared to attack Wyrmrest Temple itself!

I ask that you ride one of our defenders into battle to slay their dragons and drakes, and to attack the eruption of [[ley line]] energies at the dragonshrine itself in order to destabilize it.

Outside on the east and west terraces are wyrmrest defenders. Speak with one to ride it into battle.

Without your help, <name>, we will surely lose.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Progress==
How fares the fight? Are we pushing them back?

==Completion==
Incredible! Let me just say that I continue to be amazed by what you younger races are capable of.

We are indebted to you. Will you come back and help tomorrow?
