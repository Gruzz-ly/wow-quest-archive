==Objectives==
Battle a [[Hulking Jormungar]] east of [[Nozzlerust Post]] until it opens its mouth, then throw a Potent Explosive Charges into its throat. Collect 6 slabs of Seared Jormungar Meat off the ground after it explodes and bring them back to [[Xink]].
*[[Seared Jormungar Meat]] (6)
*[[Potent Explosive Charges]] (provided)

==Description==
Those troops are sure to be needin' a hefty supply of food in their bellies.

I'll let you in on a little secret that a squeamish <race> like you would never know... those [[Jormungar]] worms taste just like chicken.

Go provoke one of those Hulking Jormungar to the east. You're not likely to be able to kill one straight out, so just toss this down its throat when it opens its mouth wide. Bring me back as may of the slabs of meat as you can tote.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Progress==
Did ya get it all? You certainly stink of it.

==Completion==
Ha ha! One of those meat slabs landed clear over here! Nice work there!

==Notes==
The hulking jormungar hit cloth-wearers for upwards of 1300 a swing. Unload as much damage as you possibly can in as short of a period of time as possible as they show weakness and open their mouth around the 80% mark (which is roughly 10,000 HP). You've got a few seconds to throw the item into their mouth when "The Hulking Jormungar falters for a moment, opening its mouth wide." A good dozen Jormungar Meat will spawn on the ground around the hulking jormungar. Move fast, as they despawn fairly quickly!
