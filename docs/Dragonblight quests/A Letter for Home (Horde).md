==Objectives==
Deliver [[Lieutenant Ta'zinni]]'s Letter to [[Overlord Agmar]] at [[Agmar's Hammer]].
* [[Lieutenant Ta'zinni's Letter]] (provided)

==Description==
You find a letter secreted in the lining of his robes. It reads:

"[[Deino]],

Ta'zinni sorry for disappearing on ya. If you're reading this letter, then I be dead.

I been forced to work for [[Malygos]]'s armies under threat that the family would be killed if I didn't. Ta'zinni wasn't gonna let that happen!

Don't worry about me, just keep your kids safe. I have them fooled and I'm sabotaging them from the inside.

I love you, sistah!

Ta'zinni"

Overlord Agmar is sure to want to see this!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
What's this? You think you're going to mail a letter?

All mail goes through me first. There are spies and traitors amongst us!

<The overlord gives you the once over and you wonder if he's going to have you killed on the spot.>

Very well, be quick about it. But if I don't like what I read, I'm going to feed you to my worgs.

<Agmar grins as both [[Gar'mak]] and [[Lak'tuk]] turn and look at you like you're their next meal.>

==Completion==
Ahahahaha... boo hoo, how touching.

<The condescension in the overlord's deep-throated laughter is palpable.>

What did I say? Traitors! Still, I knew Deino once upon a time. She at least is a troll with honor!

I'll see to it that she finds out what happened to her brother. I'll even forget to tell her that you're the one that killed him.

<Agmar fixes you with a calculated stare.>

But I own you now, <class>!

==Notes==
A few days later, players will receive a letter from Deino.
{{book|A letter from Deino|content=
Dearest, <name>.

Overlord Agmar's personal courier saw to it that I received my brother's letter. The courier also told me that it was you who found it.

I just want to thank you for seeing to it that the letter got to me. I know that times must be tough for all of you brave souls who are daring to fight in [[Northrend]].

Rest assured that I will avenge Ta'zinni. The [[blue dragonflight]] will suffer for what they did to my little brother!

With the utmost respect and gratitude,

Deino

After this quest, you will be able to talk to [[Deino]] in the Valley of Spirits. She will cry and say this:
{{Dialogue|
Thank you, <class>, for seeing that I received that letter from my brother.

Rest assured, his death will not have been in vain.  The [[blue dragonflight]] will pay for this.

I'll see to it personally.
