==Objectives==
Use the Ley Line Focus Control Talisman to gain information from the Ley Line Focus under [[Lake Indu'le]]. Then, head east to the [[Azure Dragonshrine]] near south central [[Dragonblight]] and observe what is occurring there from the western edge.

Afterward, return to the [[Image of Archmage Modera]] at [[Stars' Rest]].
* Ley line focus information retrieved
* Azure Dragonshrine observed
* [[Ley Line Focus Control Talisman]] (provided)

==Description==
Within his robes you find two things of interest.

One is a talisman, which is clearly a focus controlling device. The other is a set of orders from someone named [[Sidragos]] which were ultimately intended for the leader back at the [[Moonrest Gardens]].

The water-soaked parchment informs [[Goramosh]] that he is to move all [[Dragonblight Mage Hunter|mage hunter]] forces east to the Azure Dragonshrine.

Perhaps you should get what information you can from the focus and head east to observe the dragonshrine from its western ledge.

==Progress==
What is it, <name>? You look flushed.

Take a moment to catch your breath.

==Completion==
WHAT?!

<The image before you distorts for a moment as the [[Archmage Modera|archmage]] attempts to regain her composure.>

Of course, we should have guessed that this was what they were up to all along. Quickly, there's no time to waste.

[[Wyrmrest Temple|Wyrmrest]] must be warned!

== Notes ==
*Fly to [[Moa'ki Harbor]]. Much quicker than running.
*Use the Focus Control Talisman to channel information from the Ley Line Focus. You will gain the buff:
{{Effecttip
