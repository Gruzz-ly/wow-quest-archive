== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Gryphon Commander Urik]] at the gryphon station in [[Wintergarde Keep]].

== Description ==
[[Bolvar Fordragon|Lord Fordragon]] has led a crushing assault against [[Arthas]] at the [[Angrathar the Wrathgate|Wrathgate]]. In response to this affront, Arthas has sent [[Naxxramas]] down upon us. While [[Kel'Thuzad]] hides in the floating citadel, his ground commander, [[Thel'zan the Duskbringer|Thel'zan]], lays siege to [[Wintergarde Keep]]. The lower village is already lost and any chance of extracting survivors from the ruins diminishes by the minute.

We must act quickly! Report to Gryphon Commander Urik at the gryphon station at once! He'll get you up to speed.

Leave me!

== Completion ==
<Urk points to a gryphon.>

Have you ever ridden one of those? It's simple, friend. Just hop on and tell it where to go.
