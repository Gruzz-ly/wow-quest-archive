== Objectives ==
Destroy Arcanimus and then return to [[Ethenial Moonshadow]] at [[Moonrest Gardens]].
* [[Arcanimus]] slain

== Description ==
There is one last thing I would have you do, <name> the <race>. I would have you destroy Arcanimus!

The sorcerers to the west used that giant device to bore a massive pit into our resting place. When they did that, they unleashed a monstrosity!

I would not care if it were only a concern for mortals, but Arcanimus feeds upon the spirits of the dead.

You will put an end to it now!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Fading Handwraps|Ring of the Afterlife|Deathtouched Boots|Crystalplate Pauldrons}}
You will also receive: {{cost|10|60}}

== Progress ==
Do you think me a fool? Arcanimus is still eating the souls of my brothers and sisters, <class>!

== Completion ==
You have my deepest gratitude, <name>.

If you haven't already, you should alert your betters to the danger the [[blue dragonflight]] has unleashed. By blowing apart the [[ley line]] anchor underneath the gardens, they threaten to destroy us all!
