Which variation of this quest you get depends on which variation of [[Of Traitors and Treason]] you accepted.

Upon accepting this quest, the player will be offered a chat to fly to [[Wintergarde Keep]], the location of the quest turn-in. 

If you take this chat, and you are [[Shapeshift|shapeshifted]], you will get the error "You can't take a taxi while shapeshifted!". 
If you take this chat, and you are mounted, you will give the error "You are already mounted! Dismount first." 
Just undo the shapeshift/dismount, and retry the chat.

==Objectives==
Deliver the Alliance Missive to [[High Commander Halford Wyrmbane]] at [[Wintergarde Keep]] in eastern [[Dragonblight]].
* [[Alliance Missive]] (provided)

==Description==
<<[[Greer Orehammer|Greer]]/[[Palena Silvercloud|Palena]]> hands the missive back to you.>

<[[Skysong]]/[[Snowstorm (hippogryph)|Snowstorm]]> will take you to [[Wintergarde Keep|Wintergarde]], <name>. I guarantee you that it will be the fastest flight you've ever taken. Go now!

==Progress==
What have you got there, soldier?

==Completion==
<The High Commander reads the missive and then crumples it up.>

Do you know where the people on this list are now? Take a look outside, near the front gate. They're the ones hanging from the arches.

[[Ghoul]] bait...

==Notes==
Upon accepting this quest, you will be mounted on a gryphon or hippogryph, and flown to Wintergarde Keep.
