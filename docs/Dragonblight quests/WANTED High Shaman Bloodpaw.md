Suggest Players [3]

== Description ==
Posted by: [[Drolfy]]

While out in the [[Eldritch Heights]] with my cousins, Scrote and Brote, a vicious band of [[wolvar]] from the [[Bloodpaw tribe]] attacked us. We attempted to flee, but I fear they got [[Skrotee]] and [[Brote]].

I demand retribution! Is there someone brave enough to venture to the southeastern reaches of Dragonblight, to the Eldritch Heights, and kill High Shaman Bloodpaw and his cronies?

I have given a very hefty sum of gold to Highlord Leoric Von Zeldig to disperse to anyone that claims this bounty!

== Progress ==
Have you faced Bloodpaw?

== Completion ==
Outstanding work, <name>! I will notify Drolfy that a hero did rise to meet his challenge and that the cruel Bloodpaw is no more!
