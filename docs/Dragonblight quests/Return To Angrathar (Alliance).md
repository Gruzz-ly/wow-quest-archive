'''Return to Angrathar''' concludes the main [[Scourge]] questline for the [[Alliance]] in Dragonblight, culminating in [[Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate|an impressive cutscene]] at [[Angrathar the Wrathgate]]. After the cutscene is complete, the Alliance, Horde and Scourge forces at the gate are all gone. In their place is Alexstrasza and Korialstrasz.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Bolvar Fordragon|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon]] at [[Fordragon Hold]] and tell him of your victory over the [[Scourge]]. 

==Description==
With [[Grand Necrolord Antiok|Antiok]] slain and the [[Scythe of Antiok|scythe]] in our possession, the [[frost wyrm]] assaults upon your forces at [[Angrathar the Wrathgate|Angrathar]] will halt. The wyrms that remain in the [[Dragonblight]] will be hunted and destroyed, their bones returning to the earth.

The time to make your final stand is now, <name>. Return to Fordragon Hold and notify Highlord Fordragon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*31150 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Completion==
Know this: all that you have done has led to this moment. Without your efforts, we would have been finished! Now, stand guard as I take to the field and end this!

==Notes==
Completing this quest will display a [[Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate|rather impressive cutscene]], and awards [[Veteran of the Wrathgate]].

On completion:
:{{text|say|Korialstrasz|My Queen, do they know?}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|No, my beloved.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|<nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Draconic]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> Ashj zila gul kirasath lok ante il lok buras danashj Gul gul}}
:{{text|emote|Korialstrasz nods.}}
:{{text|say|Korialstrasz|They will not.}}
:{{text|whisper|Alexstrasza|Come to me, <name>.}}

The line in Draconic means "They must not discover the fate of the [[Bolvar Fordragon|young paladin]]. Not yet." when run through the in-game translator. This was the first clue that Bolvar had survived... one way or [[Immolated Champion|another]].

Originally, this quest was simply one more step in the quest chain.  However, with changes to [[Kalimdor]] for the [[Cataclysm]] expansion, those further quests were removed. The reputation gain for this quest was increased as well.
