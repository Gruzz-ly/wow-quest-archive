== Objectives ==
Put to rest any combination of 15 [[Indu'le Fisherman|Indu'le Fishermen]], [[Indu'le Mystic|Mystics]] and [[Indu'le Warrior|Warriors]], then return to [[Elder Mana'loa]] at [[Indu'le Village]].
* Indu'le spirits put to rest: (15)

== Description ==
The [[Moonrest Gardens|sacred ground]] of the [[Highborne|elves]] to the west has been torn asunder. Now their magic is flowing through the land causing ruin where it flows.

The souls at Kalu'ak are in danger as the [[blue dragonflight|blue dragons]] forces attempt to control the magic.

The power came up through the lake, instantly slaying most in the village. Those that survived were driven insane.

<Name>, you must release these spirits so that they may move on. Leave the [[Deranged Indu'le Villager|deranged living]] alone; they may yet regain their sanity in time.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

== Progress ==
<Elder Mana'loa looks through you, sensing that you have not yet completed his task.>

== Completion ==
Not the most pleasant task, but necessary and merciful.

And now there is something else that you are destined to do for [[the Kalu'ak]].
