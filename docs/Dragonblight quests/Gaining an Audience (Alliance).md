==Objectives==
Deliver your Letter of Introduction to Wyrmrest Temple to [[Tariolstrasz]] at [[Wyrmrest Temple]].
* [[Letter of Introduction to Wyrmrest Temple (Alliance)]] (provided)

==Description==
<Name>, you must travel as swiftly as you can to Wyrmrest Temple and present this letter to the steward, Tariolstrasz.

The temple sits in the center of the [[Dragonblight]]. Follow the road east until it ends, and then cross [[The Dragon Wastes]] to get to it.

I'm sure that when the steward reads your introduction he'll see to it that you gain an audience with [[Alexstrasza|Queen Alexstrasza]]. We can only hope that we're not too late.

Thank you for all that you've done on our behalf. Safe journeys!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
Yes, what can I do for you, <race>?

==Completion==
A letter of introduction to meet with the queen? Let me see that.

Whatever your business is, I hope it's important. The skies are full of attacking [[blue dragonflight|blues]] today!
