==Objectives==
Seek out [[Roanauk Icemist]] at [[Agmar's Hammer]] and initiate him as a member and leader of the Horde forces.

Return to Overlord Agmar with the Blood Oath of the Horde when you complete this task.
* Roanauk Icemist initiated
* [[Blood Oath of the Horde]] (provided)

==Description==
Like the [[tauren]], [[Forsaken]], [[troll]]s and [[blood elf|blood elves]], so too do the [[taunka]] need a leader born of their own blood. The one you saved from Icemist, Roanauk, will be this leader.

<Overlord Agmar hands you a parchment.>

I give to you something familiar - the blood oath of the Horde.

Take the oath to Roanauk Icemist and initiate him into the Horde as leader of the taunka.

Let us not keep him waiting.

<Agmar nods.>
