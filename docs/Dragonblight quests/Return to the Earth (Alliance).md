== Objectives ==
Enter the [[Ruby Dragonshrine]] through one of the northern or southern passes and search for [[:Ruby Acorn]]. Use the Ruby Acorns on the fallen [[red dragon]]s to return their bodies to the earth. Return to [[Ceristrasz]] once the task is complete.
* [[Ruby Keeper (Dragonblight)|Ruby Keeper]] Returned to the Earth: (6)

== Description ==
I have another task that needs attention. I have brothers that are falling in the battle overhead and if we do not act quickly, they will only bolster the [[emberwyrm]] ranks.

Get into the shrine through one of the other passes to the south or north... the [[Scourge]] presence should be lighter there.

Search the shrine for ruby acorns that have fallen from the tree and plant them near the bodies of my fallen brood. Through this, they can give a new life... a proud fate for any of my kind.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5|60}}

== Progress ==
I started to worry that the Scourge in the shrine had claimed you. It is good that you yet live.

== Completion ==
In the earth, my brothers can grant life anew. You have saved them from a fate far worse than death.

I don't know a word in your tongue that could express how much this means to my kind. Thank you, <race>.

== Notes ==
On accepting the quest:
:{{text|say|Ceristrasz|Be sure to go through the southern canyon when entering and exiting the shrine, <name>. Your will know the canyons where the battle is waged by the [[Frigid Abomination Attacker|Abominations]] that guard them... keep your distance.}}
