==Objectives==
Use the [[:Bark of the Walkers]] to strengthen 3 Lothalor Ancients and then return to [[Sarendryana]] at [[Stars' Rest]].
*[[Lothalor Ancient]] strengthened (3)

==Description==
It's not only the <race> race that has been impacted by what the [[blue dragonflight]] forces have done. The [[ancient]]s of [[Lothalor Woodlands|Lothalor Woods]] to the southeast have been affected as well.

Some have been [[Corrupted Lothalor Ancient|corrupted]]-- avoid them at all costs--but most can still be saved. However, the [[treant]]s of the woods seem to be immune to the magic seeping through the land and the [[Arcane Wyrm (Dragonblight)|arcane wyrms]] that have come with it.

Ask the treants for their bark and feed it to the ancients. Hopefully that will be enough to save them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Bracers of Nature's Fury|Lothalar Woodwalker Belt|Star's Rest Treads|Bark Covered Pauldrons}}
You will also receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
An added benefit of saving the ancients may turn out that they will consider assisting the [[Alliance]] with its hardships. Regardless, it is the right thing to do.

Now, how many were you able to strengthen, <class>?

==Completion==
Thank you, <race>! We've lost so much already. You've ensured that we won't lose the most majestic of [[Northrend]]'s children.

I'll soon leave to speak with the ancients you saved and see if they will help us in our time of need.

==Notes==
Talk to a [[Woodlands Walker]]. They may just give you the bark, or they may turn hostile. Kill them and loot them if they attack. Use the Bark of the Walkers on friendly Lothalor Ancients. Watch out for Arcane Wyrms and the elite Corrupted Lothalor Ancients.
