==Objectives==
Collect 4 Ice Shard Clusters from [[Crystalline Ice Elemental|Ice Elementals]] to [[Coldwind Heights|the north]] and bring them to [[Zivlix]] at [[Nozzlerust Post]].
*[[Ice Shard Cluster]] (4)

==Description==
I've never seen you before... are you new to [[The Crystal Vice|the Vice]]? Glad to have you. I could always use some more hands.

You get the materials, I'll finish my machine, then we can sell it to those commander types and all go home rich.

I actually have most of the primary components, so I just need some of the materials for the weapon itself. [[Narf]] said that jagged ice shards from those [[ice elemental|elementals]] to the north would make perfect shrapnel for my bombs - go nab some, will ya?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Progress==
Do you have the shards? I'm almost finished with the main refrigeration unit.

==Completion==
Excellent. They're even sharper than I expected them to be. I'll pack them in the snow until the bomb is ready.

Let's see... what next...
