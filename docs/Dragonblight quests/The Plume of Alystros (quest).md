==Objectives==
[[Nishera the Garden Keeper]] at the [[Emerald Dragonshrine]] has asked you to acquire The Plume of Alystros.
*[[The Plume of Alystros]]
*[[Skytalon Molts]] (provided)

==Description==
I can feel that the shrine is not completely back in balance. The verdant keeper has been angered by our actions and I sense that he will not listen to reason.

[[Alystros the Verdant Keeper|Alystros]] is an immense skytalon who perches at the south end of the Emerald Dragonshrine. It is he who is in charge of the dragonshrine's aerial defenses. I fear that we will have to deal with him.

Take these skytalon molts and place them on the ground where he can see them. He will come. Bring me his plume.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Alystros' Plume Cinch|Ancient Dreamer's Leggings|Verdant Linked Boots|Belt of the Emerald Guardian}}
You will also receive: {{cost|11|20}}

==Progress==
Have you managed to deal with Alystros? The verdant keeper is very powerful.

==Completion==
Do not weep for Alystros. He has dedicated his eternal life to the defense of the Emerald Dragonshrine and will be reborn.

Hopefully when he returns to us, he will not be gripped with the confusion of the Emerald Nightmare that seems to have taken hold of The Dreamer.
