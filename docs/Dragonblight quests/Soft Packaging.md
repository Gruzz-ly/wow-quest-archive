==Objectives==
Collect 12 Thin Animal Hides from the [[Jormungar Tunneler]]s or the [[Dragonbone Condor]]s near [[Nozzlerust Post]]. Once you've located the hides, return them to [[Zivlix]].
*[[Thin Animal Hide]]: (12)

==Description==
I need some new packaging for the shrapnel bombs. All the stuff I have is too hard and the shrapnel doesn't spread when it bursts.

What we need is some really thin animal hide. Those [[jormungar]] tunnelers to the west might work... or perhaps the [[Carrion bird|condors]] sifting through the [[dragon]] bones. Go get me whatever you can find.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Progress==
How goes the hunt? Do you have my hides?

==Completion==
Good... good... these should do fine. The shrapnel bombs are almost finished.

Wait... what happened to my ice shards? [[Narf]] told me shards from those [[ice elemental|elementals]] should be enchanted, but they're melting like the ones hanging from Narf's grumpy chin!

==Notes==
If you're a skinner, go after the jormungar tunnelers; not only do they drop [[Worm Meat]], but the quest item will also always drop with whatever leather you receive, giving you two Thin Animal Hides for every one mob.
