== Objectives ==
Enter the [[Ruby Dragonshrine]] through the southern pass, then kill 6 [[Frigid Necromancer]]s and eliminate the source of the corruption under the shrine. Return to [[Vargastrasz]] once the task is complete.
* [[Frigid Necromancer]] slain (6)
* Ruby Corruption Cleansed

== Description ==
I have one final task for you, <race>... one that should turn the tide of this fight.

Return to the shrine and kill the necromancers that are fueling this onslaught. With them dead, we should be able to beat these forces back and eventually retake the shrine.

I also need you to find the source of the corruption under the shrine and put an end to it.

I know I have asked a lot of you, but if you do this for me, we will win this battle. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Treads of the Charred Canyon
|Scourgeslayer Belt
|Wyrmfire Gloves
|Conscript's Ruby Waistguard}}
You will also receive: {{cost|11|80}}

== Completion ==
[[Dahlia Suntouch|Dahlia]]... they turned her?

Dahlia has been loyal to us for a very long time... if they can corrupt a being of her devotion, it does not bode well for the rest of the young races. Thank you for freeing her. I hope she has found some peace.

You have honored us with your selfless assistance today, <race>. Perhaps not all of the [[Horde]] bear the black hearts of their ancestors.  I will send word to the council of what your kind have accomplished here.

== Notes ==
Slay Dahlia Suntouch. She drops the [[Ruby Brooch]]. A script event also takes place:
:{{text|say|Remnant of Dahlia Suntouch|I've lived here and kept this shrine with the blessing of [[Alexstrasza]] for longer than I can remember. In it's darkest hour, I've failed... I fell at the feet of that damned [[death knight|deathknight]]... [[Orbaz Bloodbane|Bloodbane]].}}
:{{text|emote|Dahlia spits on the ground at the thought of the name.}}
:{{text|say|Remnant of Dahlia Suntouch|The [[Lich King]] is stretching his hand far now... fearlessly treading on the most sacred lands of all the flights. He intends to force us to action.}}
:{{text|say|Remnant of Dahlia Suntouch|My time is done... I offered myself to Alexstrasza in life, but I have nothing left to offer in death. She will need a new keeper for her shrine.}}
:{{text|say|Remnant of Dahlia Suntouch|And thank you... thank you for freeing me from the [[Undead|shackles of the damned]]. You are a hero... I know you will go on to great deeds.}}
:{{text|emote|The Remnant of Dahlia Suntouch fades away...}}
