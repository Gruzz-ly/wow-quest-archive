== Objectives ==
Speak with the statue, [[Elder Mana'loa]], at [[Indu'le Village]].

== Description ==
My people...

<The mystic is on the verge of breaking down.>

While your spirit was flying through the village, I sensed that Elder Mana'loa took notice of you, <name>, he wishes to speak with you. The stone elders are revered by us as fonts of ancient wisdom.

The elder must want to help. Seek him in the northwest corner of the village.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

== Completion ==
I've been expecting you, <race>. I saw your spirit fly by and sensed the mystic watching behind your eyes.

Your fate and that of [[the Kalu'ak]] are now tied together.
