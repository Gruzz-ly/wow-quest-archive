Enter the [[Ice Heart Cavern]] and slay Rattlebore. Return to [[Ko'char the Unbreakable]] in [[the Crystal Vice]] when the task is complete.
* [[Rattlebore]] slain

Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
The [[Jormungar]] have a brood mother in the caverns below. We call her Rattlebore - a name that was gifted to her by an adventurer from the [[Plaguelands]]. I saw her only briefly as I was fighting off her initial onslaught - she is large enough to make even my icy bones shiver. This cavern will not be ours until she is removed from it.

Gather your friends and end this.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Thin Jormungar Legwraps|Rattlebore Slayer Leggings|Ice Heart Chestguard|Crystalplate Legguards}}
You will also receive: {{cost|16|80}}

==Progress==
It is my hope that you bring good tidings, little one.

==Completion==
So she is dead. As it should be. Your intentions do indeed prove nobler than those of the runt.

Through the north canyon you will find [[Crystalsong Forest|Crystal Song Woods]]. It is a cursed and dangerous place, <race>. Should that be your next destination, proceed with caution.

Take this for your efforts, little one, and leave this conflicted land with my blessing.

==Notes==
The name bears a resemblance to [[Rattlegore]], so said adventurer had likely run [[Scholomance]] in the [[Western Plaguelands]]. Alternatively, the name may come from [[Borelgore]], a Plaguelands worm.
