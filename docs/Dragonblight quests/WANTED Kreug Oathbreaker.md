== Description ==
Posted by: [[Illusia Lune]]

The [[Scourge]] [[flesh giant]] known as Kreug Oathbreaker was responsible for the deaths of my husband, children and my dear friends, the Whisperveils. Those brave enough to take on this bounty will find Kreug in the southeastern reaches of [[the Carrion Fields]].

I demand justice! Kill Kreug Oathbreaker!

In the event that Kreug is slain, I have pooled money and items together and given them to Highlord Leoric Von Zeldig to give out as a reward.

Please vindicate us!
