==Objectives==
[[Soar Hawkfury]] at [[Agmar's Hammer]] in [[Dragonblight]] wants you to use the [[Pack of Vaccine]] to vaccinate 5 Snowfall Elk and 5 Arctic Grizzlies.
*[[Snowfall Elk]] Inoculated (5)
*[[Arctic Grizzly]] Inoculated (5)

==Description==
Inside this pack are several vials containing the vaccine that Sintar created. I now want you to search the nearby woods for Snowfall elk and arctic grizzlies. When you locate the animals, find a safe distance and throw a vial in their general direction. The vial will shatter and release a fine gas that will act as the inoculating agent. The beasts merely have to step inside the gas and they will be vaccinated - ultimately saved.

Inoculate as many of the beasts as you can and return to me.
