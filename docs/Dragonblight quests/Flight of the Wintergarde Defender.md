==Objectives==
Rescue 5 [[Helpless Wintergarde Villager]]s and return to [[Gryphon Commander Urik]] at [[Wintergarde Keep]].
* [[Helpless Wintergarde Villager|Helpless Villager]] Rescued (5)
* [[Wintergarde Gryphon Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
With this whistle you can call down a Wintergarde [[gryphon]]. Mount the creature and head towards the ruins of Wintergarde Village, now known as the [[Carrion Fields]], southeast of here. Once at the fields, keep your eyes peeled for helpless Wintergarde villagers. When you spot one, fly low and use the gryphon to pick them up. Return the rescued villager here, to the gryphon station.

There are [[Scourge]] all over the place so you'll need to keep your wits about you, hero. Good luck!

==Progress==
Hurry, <name>! You need to save the helpless villagers!

==Completion==
Outstanding work, <name>! We can get this keep back into working order now with the return of our citizens.

==Notes==
Use the whistle to summon a [[Wintergarde Gryphon]] and interact with it to mount. It has the following abilities:
#{{Abilities|Rescue Villager|id=48363|Grabs a helpless Wintergarde villager from the clutches of the hungering dead!|icon=inv_misc_grouplooking}}
#{{Abilities|Drop Off Villager|id=48397|Drops off a rescued Wintergarde villager at the gryphon station in Wintergarde Keep.|icon=inv_misc_groupneedmore}}
#{{Abilities|Soar|id=54170|Flight speed increased by 350%.|icon=ability_hunter_eagleeye|notes=8 sec cooldown. Lasts 10 sec.}}

While mounted, the player has the following buff:
:{{Abilities|Wintergarde Gryphon Commander|id=48365|Controlling a Wintergarde Gryphon! You may only fly in Wintergarde Keep, Wintergarde Mine, and The Carrion Fields.|icon=spell_misc_hellifrepvphonorholdfavor}}

Fly to the [[Carrion Fields]]. Get close to the ground in front of a perpetually fleeing villager (many of whom are being chased by [[Hungering Dead]]), stop moving, and pick them up with Rescue Villager. Once they are on the mount, fly back to the gryphon stand and drop them off with Drop Off Villager. Repeat.

Upon using Rescue Villager:
*{{Text|say|<name>|Come with me if you want to live.}}
*{{Text|say|<name>|Get on!}}
*{{Text|say|<name>|Get on the back of my gryphon, citizen!}}
*{{Text|say|<name>|Hurry! Climb aboard!}}
*{{Text|say|<name>|I am here to save you, friend!}}
*{{Text|say|<name>|Take my hand, villager!}}

While carrying:
*{{Text|say|Helpless Wintergarde Villager|Are you sure you know how to fly this thing? Feels a little wobbly.}}
*{{Text|say|Helpless Wintergarde Villager|For the love of the Light, get me out of here!}}
*{{Text|say|Helpless Wintergarde Villager|How can I ever repay you for this, friend?}}
*{{Text|say|Helpless Wintergarde Villager|I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but could you fly a little closer to the ground? I hate heights!}}
*{{Text|say|Helpless Wintergarde Villager|I'm gettin' a little woozy... Oooooof...}}
*{{Text|say|Helpless Wintergarde Villager|Thanks for your help, hero!}}
*{{Text|say|Helpless Wintergarde Villager|You are my guardian angel! Like a white knight you flew in from the heavens and lifted me from the pit of damnation!}}
*{{Text|say|Helpless Wintergarde Villager|You save my life! Thanks!}}

Upon using Drop Off Villager:
*{{Text|say|Helpless Wintergarde Villager|HURRAY!}}
*{{Text|say|Helpless Wintergarde Villager|Kindness is not lost with this one, Urik. Thank you, hero!}}
*{{Text|say|Helpless Wintergarde Villager|My shop's doors will always be open to you, friend.}}
*{{Text|say|Helpless Wintergarde Villager|Safe at last! Thank you, stranger!}}
*{{Text|say|Helpless Wintergarde Villager|We made it! We actually made it!}}

After being dropped off, the villagers run off in the direction of the inn.

Additional notes:
*You can only pick up and drop off villagers when you are not moving. You can hover, but not have forward speed.
*The Helpless Wintergarde Villagers are only found in the Carrion Fields. [[Wintergarde Keep]] only contains [[Trapped Wintergarde Villager]]s, which cannot be rescued during this quest.
*Trying to fly outside Wintergarde Keep or the Carrion Fields will trigger the warning: "{{Text|bossemote|Return to Wintergarde or the Carrion Fields or your gryphon will drop you!}}" Fortunately, the player is provided a parachute when ejected. The buff tooltip mentions [[Wintergarde Mine]], but this is an error. The [[Wintergarde Mausoleum]] is not considered part of the acceptable area, despite it being wholly contained by the Carrion Fields, and will dismount the player.
*The villagers run around quite fast. Using Soar will help one catch up. As it has a 10 second duration and 8 second cooldown, the speed buff can be maintained continuously.
*If the player dismounts from their gryphon while carrying a villager, the villager will disappear.

Upon completing this quest, the Helpless Wintergarde Villagers running around the Carrion Fields will be phased out, having been airlifted to safety. Instead a [[Wanted! (Wintergarde Keep)|Wanted!]] poster and the following NPCs will phase in in and around the Wintergarde Keep inn, they being the people the player rescued:
{{Columns|2|
*{{NPC||Drolfy|Alchemy & Poison Supplies}}
*{{NPC||Fanny McLumpkins|General Goods}}
*{{NPC||Illusia Lune|Innkeeper}}
*{{NPC||Lexey Brevig|Reagents & Enchanting Supplies}}
*{{NPC||Master Smith Devin Brevig|Blacksmithing Supplies}}
*{{NPC||Ordal McLumpkins|Food & Drink}}
*{{NPC||Trixy Trixerton|Trade Supplies}}
*{{NPC||Wintergarde Blacksmith}}s
*{{NPC||Zybarus of Darnassus|Stable Master}}
}}

==Trivia==
The line "Come with me if you want to live" is a reference to a catchphrase from the ''{{Wp|Terminator (franchise)|Terminator}}'' franchise.
