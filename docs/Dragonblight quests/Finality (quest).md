==Objectives==
Take Thel'zan's Phylactery to [[Legion Commander Yorik]]{{coords|81.2|50.7|Dragonblight}} inside the [[Wintergarde Mausoleum]] in [[Dragonblight]]
* [[Thel'zan's Phylactery]] (provided)

==Description==
Thanks to your heroics, [[Bolvar Fordragon|Lord Fordragon]] has given the command to launch a full assault against [[Thel'zan the Duskbringer]]. 7th Legion have made their way into the summoning chamber of the mausoleum and located what appears to be a gateway to hell. The only piece that's missing now is you.

Take the [[phylactery]] and report to Legion Commander Yorik inside the Wintergarde Mausoleum.

There is a tunnel that the [[Scourge]] dug out just outside the keep that you can take to get to Yorik quickly. Go now, <name>! Lead us to victory!

==Progress==
<Yorik lets out a sigh of relief.>

We thought you might not show up, <name>.

==Completion==
When you're ready I'll place the phylactery out in front of the gateway and call forth Thel'zan.

==Notes==
To find the entrance to the tunnel go down (south-east) into the village-part of the Keep (where the [[Vengeful Geist]]s roam), turn left (north-east) and exit the keep through the damaged gates. Then turn right (south) immediately. The entrance is the greenish hole in the ground marked by torches.
