While [[Tua'kea's Crab Traps]] is not a prerequisite for this quest, it does put you in the area to find the [[Wrecked Crab Trap]] that starts this one.

==Objectives==
Inform [[Tua'kea]] at [[Moa'ki Harbor]] about the wrecked crab trap.

==Description==
This crab trap appears to have been destroyed by something much larger than the nearby circling sharks.

Perhaps Tua'kea, the fisherman at Moa'ki Harbor should be told about this?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||50}}
*2050 [[XP]] (or {{cost||49|50}} at level 80)
*+20 [[reputation]] with [[The Kalu'ak]]

==Completion==
That's not news I wanted to hear, <race>.

No, no... it's good that you told me, but I fear my old nemesis has returned to these waters.

==Progression==
