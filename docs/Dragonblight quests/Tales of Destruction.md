== Objectives ==
Travel back to [[Wyrmrest Temple|Wyrmrest]] and let [[Nalice]] know that [[Serinar]]'s task is complete.

== Description ==
You can leave now, <race>.

Go tell Nalice she missed out on a good slaughter.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||56}}

== Completion ==
Oh, it's you.

I had hoped Serinar would simply return himself once the task was done... I suppose he's distracted by something or another to kill. He's missing out on a gloriously messy battle!

Are you still here? I'm done with you.
