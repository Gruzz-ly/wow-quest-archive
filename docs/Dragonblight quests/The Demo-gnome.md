== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Siege Engineer Quarterflash]] at [[Wintergarde Keep]] in [[Dragonblight]].

== Description ==
Quarterflash recently requisitioned my group for a specialist that he could send on a reconnaissance mission to the [[Wintergarde Mine]]. To that end, I sent him [[Slinkin the Demo-gnome|Slinkin]], my demolitionist. I foolishly thought that he could close off that pit of damnation after his mission for Quarterflash was complete, securing another victory for us against the Scourge.

An entire day has passed and Slinkin has not returned. I want answers! Speak with Siege Engineer Quarterflash and track down my missing agent!

== Completion ==
I feel terrible about this, friend. I fear that in my haste to recover the strange ore from Wintergarde Mine I may have doomed agent Slinkin.

== Notes ==
The quests [[Not In Our Mine]] and [[The Bleeding Ore]] have you delve into the same mine as this chain.
