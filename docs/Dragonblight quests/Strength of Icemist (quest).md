[[Greatmother Icemist]] wants you to find her son [[Banthok Icemist]].  He was last seen headed for [[Icemist Village]].

==Objectives==
Find [[Banthok Icemist]] at [[Icemist Village]].

==Description==
<Greatmother Icemist bows.>

It is an honor to meet you, hero. It is because of your actions that many of us are here now, alive and ready for battle against the [[Scourge]].

You have done so much for us that it shames me to ask you for your assistance once more. Despite my pleas, my only son, [[Banthok Icemist|Banthok]], left here to go in search of his father, [[Roanauk Icemist|High Chief Icemist]]. He was last seen heading west, towards [[Icemist Village]]. Please find Banthok. I do not know what I would do if I lost my son.

==Rewards==
...

==Completion==
My father still lives! We must save him! I cannot do it alone, <race>. You must help me!

==Progression==
<!--I have removed the thought of merging the fall of taunka'le village and this one. They are completely different quest chains that can be done without the other, it has been tested and proven. They only use the same item but for an obvious reason. There will be no merge. -->
