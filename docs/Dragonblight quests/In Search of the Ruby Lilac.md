==Objectives==
[[Doctor Sintar Malefious]] at [[Agmar's Hammer]] in the [[Dragonblight]] wants you to collect 1 Ruby Lilac.
*[[Ruby Lilac]]

==Description==
How fortuitous it is that the Ruby Dragonshrine lays just to the east. It is there that you will find a flower called the ruby lilac. This lifegiving plant is all that I need to concoct a vaccine for the untainted beasts of this region.

Travel east and search the Ruby Dragonshrine for the lilac.

Just one thing: The dragonshrine, like all the dragonshrines in this blasted wasteland, is beset by the Scourge. Watch your step. We wouldn't want you to be devoured by an emberwyrm.

<Sintar laughs.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*20500 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} compensation at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
Do you have the ruby lilac?

==Completion==
That wasn't so difficult, now was it?

Now give me a moment to prepare the vaccine.
