== Objectives ==
[[High Executor Wroth]] at [[Venomspite]] has ordered you to return with The Head of the High General.
* [[The Head of the High General]]

== Description ==
Their attack is imminent, <class>. I need you to get in there and sever the head of the [[Scarlet Onslaught]], literally!

It's not going to be easy... [[Brigitte Abbendis|Abbendis]] is sure to be surrounded by a great many of her men. I suggest that you take at least a couple of friends along.

Bring back her head and I'll see to it that you're properly rewarded for saving Venomspite.

Fail and don't even bother to return! 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bindings of the Forceful Vanquisher
|Cuffs of the Decapitator
|Wristguards of the Remorseful
|Purity-Anointed Warbands}}
You will also receive: {{cost|10|60}}

== Progress ==
Should I tell my forces to begin making our way toward Agmar's Hammer?

Or did you manage to kill the high general?

== Completion ==
Let's see them bring her back to life without her head!

<The high executor's laugh draws a number of furtive glances.>

I'm a little concerned that you let this grand admiral get away, but you're still the hero of the day, <name>!

Take your pick... you've earned it!
