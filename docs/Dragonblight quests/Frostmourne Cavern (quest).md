==Objectives==
Use Zelig's Scrying Orb at the bottom of [[Frostmourne Cavern]]. Unlock the secrets of the past!
* Secrets of the Past Revealed
* [[Zelig's Scrying Orb]] (provided)

==Description==
They have labeled the cave as Frostmourne Cavern. Why the [[Scarlet Onslaught]] is interested by such things is unknown, but by the look of things, the area surrounding the cave is heavily guarded. Nonetheless, we must proceed!

Take this scrying orb and travel north out of town and then northwest towards [[Scarlet Point]]. Make your way into the cave and battle your way to the bottom. Once there, use the orb. Return here with what you discover.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Wrap of Vigorous Destruction|Belt of Vengeful Purification|Links of Righteous Persecution|Girdle of Forceful Annihilation}}

==Progress==
Have you searched Frostmourne Cavern?

==Completion==
[[Muradin]] lives? Could it be? I must notify [[Magni Bronzebeard|King Bronzebeard]] at once!

I need to consult the orb. There must be more information - somewhere!

==Notes==
As players step inside Frostmourne Cavern, they are buffed with "Haunting Memories: Surrounded by dark memories". Deep in the cavern, as [[Deathbringer Revenant]]s patrol about, is the [[Altar of Frost (Dragonblight)|Altar of Frost]]. Lying before it are three abandoned weapons: [[Light's Vengeance]], [[Arthas Menethil]]'s former weapon, to the left, and a one-handed axe and one-handed battlehammer to the right. The two one-handers appear to be of [[dwarf|dwarven]] make, presumably [[Muradin Bronzebeard]]'s. Use the orb to activate Zelig's Vision.

:{{text|bossemote|The walls of Frostmourne Cavern shudder and shake.}}
:''An image of Arthas and Muradin appear standing before the altar, along with one of [[Frostmourne]] hovering above the altar, but with no visible ice.''
:{{text|say|Prince Arthas|Behold, Muradin, our salvation, Frostmourne.}}
:''Murdadin steps close to the altar and kneels to read...''
:{{text|say|Muradin|Hold, lad. There's an inscription on the dais. It's a warning. It says, "Whomsoever takes up this blade shall wield power eternal. Just as the blade rends flesh, so must power scar the spirit." Oh, I should've known. The blade is cursed! Let's get the hell out of here!}}
:''Muradin gets up and returns to where he was standing.''
:{{text|say|Prince Arthas|I would gladly bear any curse to save my [[Lordaeron|homeland]].}}
:{{text|say|Muradin|Leave it be, Arthas. Forget this business and lead your men home.}}
:''Arthas takes a few steps toward the altar and turns to Muradin.''
:{{text|say|Prince Arthas|Damn the men! Nothing shall prevent me from having my revenge, old friend. Not even you.}}
:''Arthas begins casting...''
:{{text|say|Prince Arthas|Now, I call out to the spirits of this place. I will give anything or pay any price, if only you will help me save my people.}}
:''The ice shatters, striking down Muradin, who falls forward with weapons falling to the ground. Arthas, casting aside his hammer, steps forward and claims Frostmourne.''
:''Arthas runs a few strides from the altar toward the exit, stops to <code>/roar</code>, then continues running. On his way out, he does not see Muradin get to his feet. Muradin appears to be dazed.''
:{{text|say|Muradin|O' my head... Wh... Where am I?}}
:{{text|say|Muradin|Who... Who am I?}}
:''Leaving behind the weapons he does not remember owning, Muradin runs out of the cavern.''
