==Objectives==
Travel to [[Agmar's Hammer]] in the [[Dragonblight]] and speak to [[Overlord Agmar]].

==Description==
Directly east of this refugee camp stands Agmar's Hammer - testament to the Hordes' power in the Dragonblight.

While I have no doubt that our Horde brothers and sisters are already seeing the result of your efforts to bring the [[taunka]] into the [[Horde]], I want you to deliver news of your success to Overlord Agmar in person.

Go now, <name>! Race the winds! East to Agmar's Hammer!

==Completion==
While you have undoubtedly championed the cause of the Horde elsewhere, many more have been working towards expanding our grasp deeper into [[Northrend]]. Even now we have forces establishing bases in the frozen reaches of this desolate wasteland.

We surround the [[Scourge]] on all sides. Victory nears as our armies amass at the foot of the Wrathgate, [[Angrathar the Wrathgate|Angrathar]]. Soon we will tear down the gate and breach [[Icecrown]].

But there is much work left to be done...

First we must stop the [[Nerubian]]s!
