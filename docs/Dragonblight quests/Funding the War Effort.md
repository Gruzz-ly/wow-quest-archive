==Objectives==
[[Quartermaster Bartlett]] at [[Venomspite]] has asked you to recover 6 Forgotten Treasure.
* [[Forgotten Treasure]] (6)

==Description==
<The quartermaster lowers his voice and whispers to you.>

<class>, I need your help; our coffers are empty. The Kor'kron Vanguard at the Wrath Gate has taken all of our coin for the fight there.

But, I've heard whispers that there's treasure to be had amongst the wrecks on the Forgotten Shore to the southeast.

We have to do something soon, or we won't be able to continue the fight against the Scarlet Onslaught. War isn't cheap, you know!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Warblade of the Forgotten Footman|Valonforth's Remembrance|Hood of the Forgotten Rifleman|Chestpiece of the Forgotten Captain|Circlet of the Forgotten Mercenary}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|5||}}
*20300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|4|86|}} compensation at level 80)
*250 reputation with [[The Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
How much of that Alliance treasure did you manage to get your hands on?

==Completion==
<The quartermaster gasps, but then his eyes narrow as he studies you for a moment.>

I trust that you didn't stash any of this on the side for yourself? You wouldn't be that selfish when the fate of Venomspite is at stake?

Besides, I'm going to reward you with a percentage of the take. It's not much, but in times like this, we all have to make sacrifices.
