== Objectives ==
Seek out [[Cavalier Durkon]] at the [[Wintergarde Crypt]] in [[Dragonblight]].

== Description ==
After the [[Scourge]] breached the south wall, I ordered Cavalier Durkon to investigate the town crypt. Moments ago I was handed his report.

The [[undead]] that plague us are coming from two sources: the ruins of Wintergarde, now a breeding ground for Scourge, and our very own town crypt! Amidst the chaos and confusion the Scourge managed to get a necrolord inside the crypt.

In his message, Durkon requested assistance. You will find him and help him, <name>. The crypt is on the western border of the town square.

== Completion ==
Oh brother, it's a mess down there! I barely made it out last time - which is what prompted my request to the [[High Commander Halford Wyrmbane|High Commander]].

<Durkon looks you up and down.>

You've got that crazy look in your eyes, <race>. Thankfully, you're gonna need to be crazy to do what I'm about to ask of you.

== Notes ==
The easiest path to Durkon on foot is to run behind the inn and then take a left down to the town square after reaching the end of the wall.
