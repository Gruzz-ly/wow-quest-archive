==Objectives==
Destroy 30 Wastes Scavengers and recover the Scythe of Antiok. Return to [[Alexstrasza the Life-Binder]] at [[Wyrmrest Temple]] should you complete this task.
* [[Wastes Scavenger]] slain (30)
* [[Scythe of Antiok]]
* [[Ruby Beacon of the Dragon Queen]] (provided)

==Description==
Use this beacon to signal a [[Wyrmrest Vanquisher|Wyrmrest vanquisher]]. Climb upon its back and fly north to [[Galakrond's Rest]]. Once there, command the dragon to destroy the [[Scourge]] scavengers that work to unearth [[Galakrond]]. Once the area has been cleansed, fly to [[the Wicked Coil]], overlooking Galakrond's Rest, to destroy [[Grand Necrolord Antiok]] and recover the scythe that he uses to control the wyrms.

Do this and return to Queen Alexstrasza for a hero's reward!

<Name>, beware the [[Rotting Storm Giant|rotting storm giants]] that wander the area!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Scourgeslayer Cover|Wyrmfire Links|Chestplate of the Ruby Champion|Will of the Red Dragonflight}}

==Progress==
Destroy the Scourge at Galakrond's Rest before it is too late!

==Completion==
I knew that you would return, <name>. You have served the [[Wyrmrest Accord]] and saved your people from certain death. Let it be known to all and let it be recorded for all posterity!

==Notes==
;[[Wyrmrest Vanquisher]] Abilities
# Standard dragon fire cone (requires a target)
# Ground-targeted AoE. 
# Munch ghouls to regen the dragon's health and mana.

If the drake's abilities aren't working, log out, disable all addons, log back in and try again. Stick close (but not too close) to the ghouls to make sure they die.

To fight Thiassi, get to full health and mana, fly up to the spire at {{co|54.5|31.5|Dragonblight}}, which is on the north edge of [[Galakrond's Rest]]. Get close to the ground, target the giant, hit 1, spam 2 until 1's cooldown comes back up, then hit 1 again. By that point, Thiassi should die. Antiok will hop off and desummon your dragon, so just kill him normally now that he's no longer immune. The scythe is an object that appears after Antiok dies, so you do not have to be the one who kills him to loot it.

The drake can be used anywhere in the Dragon Wastes, so if you wait to turn in the quest you get a flying mount for a good portion of the area.
