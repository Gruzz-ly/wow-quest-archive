== Objectives ==
[[Commander Lynore Windstryke]] at [[Wintergarde Keep]] in [[Dragonblight]] wants you to kill 15 Vengeful Geists.
* [[Vengeful Geist]] slain: (15)

== Description ==
The town square, down this path, is overrun with the [[undead]] citizens of [[Wintergarde]]! Our own [[Wintergarde Crypt|crypt]] provides a seemingly endless supply of soldiers for the [[Scourge]] to throw at us. Take no pity on them, <name>. While they were once mortal, capable of compassion and thought, they are now ravaging undead with only one purpose: our destruction.

Venture forth to the town square and deliver the vengeful geists to their maker. Give them peace.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Wastewind Cinch|Snowfall Reaver Gloves|Iceshear Bindings|Stonepath Sabatons}}

== Progress ==
Put them out of their misery, <name>.

== Completion ==
Perhaps now they will rest easy, their spirits free to ascend to the [[Light]].

My thoughts and prayers now turn to [[Bolvar Fordragon|Lord Fordragon]] and our forces at the [[Angrathar the Wrathgate|Wrathgate]]. We must persevere here, if only to buy them enough time to defeat the [[Lich King]]. Wintergarde cannot fall.
