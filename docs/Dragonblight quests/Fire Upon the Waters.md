==Objectives==
[[Apothecary Vicky Levine]] at [[Venomspite]] has asked you to use her Apothecary's Burning Water to set the sails of the Sinner's Folly afire.

While the deckhands are busy attempting to put the fires out, head belowdecks and retrieve Captain Shely's Rutters from the captain.
* Sails of the Sinner's Folly set afire
* [[Captain Shely's Rutters]]
* [[Apothecary's Burning Water]] (provided)

==Description==
I have another mission for you.

I was able to repurpose some of the blight to concoct my world-famous burning water. I want you to take it and set the sails of the Sinner's Folly ablaze!

Use it from the dock. Once the sails are on fire, the deckhands will be busy putting them out, and you'll slip belowdecks to 'retrieve' the captain's rutters.

You'll find the ship on Crusader's Landing, below and south of New Hearthglen. Look for the captain's quarters on the first lower deck, behind the stairs. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Highseas Wristwraps
|Glade Wanderer Boots
|Westwind Shoulderguards
|Sinner's Repentance}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|5}}
*+250 [[Hand of Vengeance]] Reputation

==Progress==
Please do NOT tell me that their sails were somehow protected from my burning water!

I'd hate to have to test it out here again.

==Completion==
Ahhahahahahahahahaha!

Without their rutters, they've got nowhere to run to now.

Looks to me like the end of the Scarlet Onslaught, and just when they were getting started. How sad.

Heh.
