==Objectives==
Venture to [[Fordragon Hold]] in [[Dragonblight]] and speak with {{npc||Bolvar Fordragon||Highlord Bolvar Fordragon}}.{{co|37.8|23.5|Dragonblight}}

==Description==
With the [[Naxxramas]] war machine stopped dead in its tracks the time has come for you to help our forces at [[Angrathar the Wrathgate|Angrathar, the Wrathgate]]. Nestled against the mountain in northern Dragonblight is our base of operations, Fordragon Hold. It is there that Lord Fordragon awaits your arrival! Go now, <name>!

Take the north gate out of town and travel north by northwest until you arrive at your destination.

[[Light]] protect you!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Implacable Zombie Crushers|Reinforced Traveler's Boots|Sandals of Chaos Resolution|Treads of the Valiant Struggle}}

==Completion==
This commendation is only given to those that have gone above and beyond the call of duty in the name of the Alliance. I could count the number of times I've handed this one out on one hand, <name>, and never has anyone been more deserving than you! Congratulations!

Now, let us look upon the Wrathgate. Does it look familiar? It should. That strange ore you found at the [[Wintergarde Mine]] is exactly what the Wrathgate is made from. We will find its weakness and expose it for all to see! First, though...

==Notes==
Fordragon Hold is in the north-northwest of Dragonblight, northwest of the [[7th Legion Front]]. Along the way is what's left of a {{NPC||Nozzlerust Supply Runner}} at {{co|48.4|24.2|Dragonblight}}, who has a breadcrumb pointing to the neutral goblin camp, [[Nozzlerust Post]]...
