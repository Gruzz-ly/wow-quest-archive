==Objectives==
Seek out [[Alexstrasza the Life-Binder]] at [[Wyrmrest Temple]] in [[Dragonblight]]. 

==Description==
Though I know you hunger to destroy the Scourge that stand before us at the Wrath Gate, we must first deal with the threat that looms overhead. Until the strafing assaults of the frost wyrms are halted, we cannot me forward.

But before we assault the dying grounds of dragons, we must first be granted permission. Venture now to the hallowed halls of dragonkind: Wyrmrest Temple. Once there, seek out Queen Alexstrasza.

Ride now, <name>! Southeast, to Wyrmrest!

==Completion==
You have come seeking my council, mortal. This I know, but do you know what it is that you face?

<[[Alexstrasza]] points northward.>

North of here are the dying grounds of [[Galakrond]] - progenitor of dragonkind. It is from Galakrond that the [[Titan]]s created the [[Dragon Aspect|Aspects]]. Imagine, then, the power of Galakrond. His size alone was greater than all of the Aspects combined! Now attempt to understand what the [[Scourge]] do in the Great [[Dragonblight]]

Frost wyrms, mortal, should be the least of your concerns.
