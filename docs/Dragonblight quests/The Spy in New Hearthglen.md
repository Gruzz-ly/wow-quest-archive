==Objectives==
Deliver the Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders to [[Agent Skully]] at [[New Hearthglen]].
*[[Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders]] (provided)

==Description==
I have a spy within the ranks of the Scarlet Onslaught. I need you to deliver these daily orders to her so that she can plan the next phase of our assault.

She goes by the name of Agent Skully and she's under a magical guise to appear as the Onslaught's cemetery caretaker.

Here, take these orders to her, and then do as she asks. You'll find the graveyard on the side of the [[New Hearthglen abbey|abbey]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
<The agent eyes you up and down, and then silently motions you over.>

Don't blow my cover, <class>!

==Completion==
You have word from the spy mistress?

<The agent looks around to make sure that no one is watching as she puts down her shovel.>

Let me see those plans.

==Progression==
