==Objectives==
Deliver Wind Trader Mu'fah's Remains and the Scales of Goramosh to the [[Image of Archmage Modera]] at [[Stars' Rest]].
* [[Wind Trader Mu'fah's Remains]]
* [[The Scales of Goramosh]]

==Description==
We need to kill two birds with one stone here, <class>. You're the stone.

Our two birds are [[Wind Trader Mu'fah]] and [[Goramosh]]. They should be somewhere in the western half of the [[Moonrest Gardens]]. Most likely they're in the larger two-story building overlooking the pit.

I require proof of their demise, if you would be so kind.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Kirin Tor Initiate's Cowl|Violet Stalker Bracers|Azurehunter Legguards|Dalaran Sentry Headguard}}
You will also receive: {{cost|10|60}}

==Progress==
Have you prevented the accord between the [[blue dragonflight|Blue Dragonflight]] and the [[Ethereum]]?

==Completion==
Unfortunate that Goramosh indicated the accord had already been reached.

Nonetheless, that's two less worms we'll have to worry about. Let us get to more important business.
