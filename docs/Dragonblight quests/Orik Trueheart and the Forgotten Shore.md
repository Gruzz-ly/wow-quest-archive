== Objectives ==
Seek out the assistance of [[Orik Trueheart]] at [[Dawn's Reach]] in [[Dragonblight]].

== Description ==
I have gazed upon the orb and seen the path that you must walk, <name>.

Many years ago an atrocity was committed upon the shores of Dragonblight. The act itself remains shrouded in darkness, but I am certain that your destiny lies south, amidst the ruins of the [[Forgotten Shore (Dragonblight)|Forgotten Shore]].

Take the road southeast through the ravaged town square. Follow the trail until you arrive at Dawn's Reach. You'll meet an old friend of mine there known as Orik Trueheart. He'll be expecting you.

== Completion ==
Zelig sent word, friend. We have been expecting you.

I am Orik Trueheart, [[paladin]] of the [[Argent Crusade]].

The priestess standing across the campfire from me is [[Tilda Darathan]]. We are here on behalf of the Argent Crusade - sent to quell the unfortunate damned souls attempting to escape [[Wintergarde]].

== Notes ==
Dawn's Reach is just south of [[the Carrion Fields]], south-southwest of [[Naxxramas]].  Orik himself is located at {{coords|87.2|57.5|Dragonblight}}.
