==Objectives==
[[Apothecary Vicky Levine]] at [[Venomspite]] has asked you to test the Flask of Blight upon the [[Scarlet Onslaught Prisoner]].
*Flask of Blight tested
*[[Flask of Blight]] (provided)

==Description==
Have you read the wanted poster? What is the high executor thinking?!

<Vicky looks around and continues in hushed tones.>

We can't very well have those Scarlet Onslaught idiots being raised by their priests, or worse, rising as the Scourge, now can we?

No, I'm in total agreement with you, we have to do something about the corpses.

I have just the thing. Take this blight that we just created and test it on the prisoner in the cage right here.

No muss, no fuss, no returning enemies.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost||50}}
*2050 [[XP]] (or {{cost||49|50}} at max level)
*+10 [[reputation]] with The [[Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
Did you do it?

Hey, I forgot to tell you that you probably shouldn't let any of that stuff get on you! It's nasty, and you'll never get the stains out, let alone have a hell of a time healing the bubbled-away fleshy bits.

==Completion==
WHAT?! That's impossible! We've perfected the blight. It has a one-hundred percent lethality.

<The apothecary wrings her hands, concern crossing her unliving visage. Clearly frustrated, she continues in an angry tone.>

This is just really odd. Hand me that flask, <class>. I'm not going to be known as the apothecary that ruined everything!

==Notes==
Upon completion of this quest, the following exchange takes place:
:{{Text|Say|Apothecary Vicky Levine|Schlemiel!}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Junior Apothecary Schlemiel]]|Huh?}}
:{{Text|Say|Apothecary Vicky Levine|Apparently you flubbed this batch of blight. What do you have to say for yourself?}}
:{{Text|Say|Junior Apothecary Schlemiel|But... I followed your instructions precisely! Sorry?}}
:{{Text|Say|Apothecary Vicky Levine|Sorry? SORRY? Here's sorry for you!}}

At this point, Vicky throws a vial at Schlemiel. Schlemiel promptly turns into green slime that immediately evaporates.

:{{Text|Say|Junior Apothecary Schlemiel|Eep!}}
:{{Text|Say|Apothecary Vicky Levine|Oops. I guess it IS working! That's odd.}}
:{{Text|Say|Apothecary Vicky Levine|I'm gonna need a cleanup and a new assistant over here!}}
