==Objectives==
Enter the [[Ice Heart Cavern|caverns]] in [[The Crystal Vice|Crystal Vice]] and trap 3 Jormungar Spawn inside [[Sturdy Crates|sturdy crates]]. Be sure to pick the crates up after the Jormungar Spawn are trapped inside!

Bring the captured Jormungar Spawn back to [[Zort]] in the Crystal Vice.
*[[Captured Jormungar Spawn]] (3)

==Description==
So be it. If the [[Crystalline Ice Giant|giants]] will not come to our aid, perhaps we can make use of these worms. There are sure to be some [[Ice Heart Jormungar Spawn|spawn]] with their [[Rattlebore|brood mother]] in the cavern below. Take this box and capture 3 of their spawn and bring them to me.

Where diplomacy fails, enslaving is a perfectly viable alternative.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Progress==
You've returned! Do you have the beasts? I need to get out of here... I'm pretty sure [[Ko'char the Unbreakable|Ko'char]] tried to step on me a few minutes ago.

==Completion==
These will do nicely. Perhaps after I grow the beasts to full size, I will bring them back and introduce them to the giants personally.

Bunch of useless rocks if you ask me.

==Notes==
Do this quest alongside Worm Wrangler, which is unlocked on acceptance:

:{{text|whisper|[[Ko'char the Unbreakable]]|I have another task for you, should you be willing, little one.}}

Close to melee range with an [[Ice Heart Jormungar Spawn]], then toss one of the [[Sturdy Crates]] at it. Once the spawn's in the crate, pick up the crate. Repeat.
