==Objectives==
Bring the Emblazoned Battle Horn to [[Wyrmrest Temple]] and seek out someone who might be interested in assessing the potential threat. 
*[[Emblazoned Battle Horn (starter)]] (provided)

==Description==
The underside of the horn boasts an emblazoned seal with a hammer and lightning bolt. Something about the horn seems extremely out of place on a [[Magnataur]].

Take the horn east across the [[Dragon Wastes]] to [[Wyrmrest Temple]] and seek out someone who might be interested in these threatening implications. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|30}}
*+ 250 [[reputation]] with [[Wyrmrest Accord]]

==Progress==
Yes, <race>?

==Completion==
It is indeed strange for any [[magnataur]] to carry an item such as this... and very concerning. I am glad that you have shown this to me.

==Notes==
Drops from [[Icefist]] in the canyon north of the [[Ruby Dragonshrine]].

==Progression==
{{Magnataur of Dragonblight}}

==Patch changes==
