==Objectives==
Take the Flesh-Bound Tome to [[Koltira Deathweaver]].
*[[Flesh-bound Tome (Horde quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
There is one who recently joined our cause that might be able to decipher this tome. An unbound death knight known as Koltira Deathweaver has temporarily taken residence here at Agmar's Hammer. As he was once a death knight of Arthas and member of the Scourge, he might be able to translate the language of the dead.

Take the flesh-bound tome to Koltira and ask him to translate the pages.

==Progress==
What is it, <race>?

==Completion==
<Koltira's eyes widen.>

There are only two things in life that interest me, peon, and neither of them involve translating a Scourge tome for you.

However... perhaps we could work something out that would benefit the both of us.

<Koltira unsheathes his weapon.>

This is my runeblade, [[Byfrost]]. Byfrost thirsts for the blood of the Lich King and his minions, but first I must etch upon it runes of power: symbols of frost, blood, and shadow. Bring me suitable sources of power and I will translate your tome.
