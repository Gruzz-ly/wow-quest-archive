==Objectives==
Obtain the Flesh of "Two Huge Pincers" and deliver it to [[Tua'kea]] at [[Moa'ki Harbor]].
* [[The Flesh of "Two Huge Pincers"]]

==Description==
I'm sure of it... our ancient aquan nemesis, [[Tu'u'gwar]], "He Who Plays With Food", has returned. We must lay a trap for him, you and I.

If Tu'u'gwar has one weakness it's his stomach. There's one meat for certain that he'd never be able to pass up.

"Two Huge Pincers", the mother of all crabs, [[Kili'ua]], paces upon her island out in the waters to the southwest. You must pay her a visit and return with her meat.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
You return with the succulent flesh of Kili'ua?

==Completion==
You were able to slay Kili'ua... perhaps you will be able to do the same to Tu'u'gwar.

Perhaps not.

==Progression==
{{:Tua'kea's Crab Traps}}
