==Objectives==
Speak to [[Senior Sergeant Juktok]] at [[Agmar's Hammer]].

==Description==
There remain only two primary threats that stand in our way. One is the dread citadel of [[Naxxramas]], far to the east, above the Alliance fortress of [[Wintergarde]] and the other is the [[Pit of Narjun]], exit point for the undead armies of [[Azjol'Nerub]]. It is from the Pit of Narjun that the Anub'ar Nerubians assaulted and ultimately razed the [[taunka]] village of [[Icemist Village|Icemist]].

We will destroy the [[Anub'ar]] and close off the [[Pit of Narjun]].

Report to [[Senior Sergeant Juktok]] for your mission orders.

==Completion==
By land and air, that's how we will end the Anub'ar threat.
