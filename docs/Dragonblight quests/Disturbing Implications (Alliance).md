==Objectives==
Bring the horn south down the [[Path of the Titans]] to [[Wyrmrest Temple|Wyrmrest]] and seek out someone interested in assessing the potential threat.
*[[Emblazoned Battle Horn (starter)]] (provided)

==Description==
The underside of the horn boasts an emblazoned seal with a hammer and lightning bolt. Something about the horn seems extremely out of place on a [[Magnataur]].

Take the horn south down the Path of the Titans to Wyrmrest and seek out someone who might be interested in these threatening implications.

==Rewards==
You will also receive: {{cost|5|30}}

==Progress==
Yes, <race>?

==Completion==
It is indeed strange for any magnataur to carry an item such as this... and very concerning. I am glad that you have shown this to me.

==Notes==
Drops from [[Chilltusk]] in northern [[Dragonblight]].

==Progression==
{{Magnataur of Dragonblight}}
