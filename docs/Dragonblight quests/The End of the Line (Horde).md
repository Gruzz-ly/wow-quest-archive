==Objectives==
Use the Ley Line Focus Control Talisman to gain information from the Ley Line Focus under [[Lake Indu'le]]. Then, head east to the [[Azure Dragonshrine]] near south central [[Dragonblight]] and observe what is occurring there from the western ledge.

Afterward, return to the [[Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver]] at [[Agmar's Hammer]].
* Ley Line Focus information retrieved
* Azure Dragonshrine observed
* [[Ley Line Focus Control Talisman]] (provided)

==Description==
Within his robes you find two things of interest.

One is a talisman, which is clearly a focus controlling device. The other is a set of orders from someone named [[Sidragos]], which were ultimately intended for the leader back at the [[Moonrest Gardens]].

The fragile water-soaked parchment informs [[Goramosh]] that he is to move all mage hunter forces east to the Azure Dragonshrine.

Perhaps you should get what information you can from the focus and head east to observe the dragonshrine from its western ledge. 

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Daschal's Discarded Shiv
|Mace of the Violet Guardian
|Staff of the Ley Mender
|Mana Infused Claw
|Tome of the Violet Tower}}
You will also receive: {{cost|10}}

==Completion==
WHAT?!

<The image before you distorts for a moment as the archmage attempts to regain his composure.>

Of course, we should have guessed that this was what they were up to all along. Quickly, there's no time to waste.

Wyrmrest must be warned!

==Notes==
*Fly to [[Moa'ki Harbor]]. Much quicker than running.
*Use the Focus Control Talisman to channel information from the Ley Line Focus. You will gain the buff:
{{Effecttip

Then proceed to the Azure Dragonshrine.
