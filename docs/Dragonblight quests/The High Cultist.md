== Objectives ==
[[Warden Jodi Moonsong]] at [[Stars' Rest]] has asked you to slay High Cultist Zangus.
* [[High Cultist Zangus]]{{coords|28.8|49.8|Dragonblight}} slain

== Description ==
I have dreamed of Zangus before but without the context you have discovered, I knew not what it meant. You have brought clarity to the vision that the goddess has bestowed upon me, and now I know that he can be found within [[the Pit of Narjun]] to the north.

You know your target, <name>. If there's to be an end to the suffering of the land, the high [[Cult of the Damned|cultist]] must die!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Wastewind Leggings|Snowfall Reaver Leggings|Anub'ar-Husk Helm|Stonepath Chestguard}}
You will also receive: {{cost|10}}

== Progress ==
I sense that High Cultist Zangus yet lives.

Is there something wrong, <name>? Perhaps you need to rest first?

== Completion ==
With the high cultist destroyed, the rest of his forces can be mopped up and the land and its creatures will recover.

Thank you, <name>.  May the goddess illuminate your path.
