==Objectives==
[[Deathguard Molder]] at [[Venomspite]] has asked you to use the Siegesmith Bombs to bombard 5 [[New Hearthglen]] Ballistae.
*New Hearthglen Ballista bombarded (5)
*[[Siegesmith Bombs]] (provided)

==Description==
At last, our chance to strike at their siege engines! Don't flub it. 

I kid.

A little.

<class>, bombard New Hearthglen's [[ballista]]e with these bombs.

We'll show the Royal Apothecary Society how it's done old style. No concoctions required!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Ritual Neckguard|Saboteur's Wrap|Siegemaster's Torch Ring}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|5||}}
*20300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|4|86|}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
Someday I'll be lead deathguard!

Someday....

==Completion==
Oh happy day!

By not using the time and resources of the apothecaries to get the job done, I'm sure to attract the attention of the high executor!

Thinking outside the box, that's what I'm all about. Yes, yes, you had a hand in helping too.

Here, if I give you something will you promise to not mention your part in all of this?
