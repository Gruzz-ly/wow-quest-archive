==Objectives==
Search the [[dragon]] bones east of [[Nozzlerust Post]] for 12 Splintered Bone Chunks.
*[[Splintered Bone Chunk]] (12)

==Description==
No no no! Those [[Ice Shard Cluster|ice shards]] didn't work at all! They'll melt before they even do any damage. That's the last time I'll trust [[Narf]]'s word on materials. This means we need something else entirely for the shrapnel.

I know! I'm brilliant. Bone splinters.

There are some bones all around here that the [[jormungar]] have been gnawing on pretty thoroughly. Go check them out and see if you can find me some splintered bone that I can use.

==Progress==
Were there any splinters to be found?

==Completion==
Excellent! That should be the last thing I need to test out the new bombs. Just a moment and I'll try this out!

==Notes==
On completion:
:''[[Zivlix's Destruction Machine]] takes off and starts flying around, eventually heading towards [[Coldwind Heights]].''
:{{text|say|Zivlix says: The control components are working perfectly this time!
:Zivlix says: Who to test the bomb on? The [[Harpy|Harpies]]? Ha ha... wait... what's that?}}
:''The [[Mistress of the Coldwind]] shoots the machine out of the sky.''
:{{text|yell|Mistress of the Coldwind yells: You are not welcome in our home. Leave and go find some other land to pillage!}}
:{{text|say|Zivlix says: NO! My machine... my bombs! THAT'S IT! Those Harpies are going DOWN!
:Zivlix says: Talk to [[Narf]]. Lets take care of those bird-brains once and for all.}}
