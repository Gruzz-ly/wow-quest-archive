Upon accepting this quest, the player will immediately be sent to [[Stars' Rest]], the location of the quest turn-in. However, if the player is [[shapeshift]]ed, they will simply get the error "You can't take a taxi while shapeshifted!". Likewise, being mounted will give the error "You are already mounted! Dismount first." Should you accept the quest under one of these conditions, you'll have to abandon the quest and reacquire it to be sent to Stars' Rest.

== Objectives ==
Speak with the [[Image of Archmage Modera]] at [[Stars' Rest]] in western [[Dragonblight]]. 

== Description ==
When you are ready I will place you on my fastest gryphon to Stars' Rest. Once you get there, find and speak with Archmage Modera.

Good luck, ally! 

== Completion ==
[[Vas the Unstable|Vas]] heard my distress call then, eh? Not a moment too soon, friend.
