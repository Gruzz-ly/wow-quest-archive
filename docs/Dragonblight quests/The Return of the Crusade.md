== Objectives ==
[[Commander Lynore Windstryke]] at [[Wintergarde Keep]] in [[Dragonblight]] wants you to kill 20 [[Scarlet Onslaught]] at the [[Onslaught Base Camp]].
* Scarlet Onslaught slain: (20)

== Description ==
To the northeast of Wintergarde Keep newly built encampment, set up by the [[Scarlet Crusade]] - or rather - the Scarlet Onslaught as they now call themselves. While we are unsure as to why they are in [[Northrend]], they are certainly no less dangerous than before. As of last night, the Scarlet Onslaught has killed twelve of our soldiers. They must be taught a lesson, <name>.

Go to Onslaught Base Camp and thin them out.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5|30}} and [[Runic Healing Potion]] (5)

== Progress ==
Clear out the Onslaught Base Camp, <name>.

== Completion ==
Hopefully the message is now clear to the Onslaught. I hope it was enough of a beating to make them doubt their affiliations.
