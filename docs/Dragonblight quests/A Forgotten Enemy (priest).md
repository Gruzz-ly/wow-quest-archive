==Completion==

So the [[Ethereum]] has taken the [[Nexus]]... and yet, that seems the least of our worries.

Their plan to widen the breach into the [[Twisting Nether]] poses a threat to all of [[Azeroth]]. It seems fate has set you on this path for a reason, <name>. Not only must you recover the weapon you seek, but you must put a stop to the Ethereum as well!

I regret that I cannot assist you more directly, but I will guide you as I can.

==Notes==
Upon activating the [[Communication Device Switch]], a large hologram of [[Nexus-Prince Bilaal]] appears above the device.
:{{text|say|Nexus-Prince Bilaal|Who dares to...? Ah, what have we here?}}
:{{text|say|Nexus-Prince Bilaal|Another intruder come to claim the treasures of the [[Nexus Vault]]!}}
:{{text|say|Nexus-Prince Bilaal|You are too late, priest! Even now the powers within the vault serve to widen the breach into the Twisting Nether.}}
:{{text|say|Nexus-Prince Bilaal|With this power, the Ethereum will become unstoppable. We will become [[void]]!}}
:''Nexus-Prince Bilaal disappears.''
