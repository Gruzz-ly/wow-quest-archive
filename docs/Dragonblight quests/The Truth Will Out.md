==Objectives==
[[Agent Skully]] has asked you to acquire The Diary of High General Abbendis and to deliver it to [[High Executor Wroth]] at [[Venomspite]].
*[[The Diary of High General Abbendis]]

==Description==
We have to figure out what's going on here. We need the general's diary!

I'm pretty sure that you'll find it on her nightstand upstairs at her house. It's the one next to church, across from the stables and the lumbermill.

Once you acquire the diary, take it to the high executor back at Venomspite.

You'll have to do this the old-fashioned way; the power of the mirror is low and there's only enough left for me.

<The agent smirks.> 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
It's about time, <name>! What's been keeping you? 

==Completion==
Damn it all! Why couldn't you have come to me with good news?! 

==Progression==
{{Need to Know}}

==Patch changes==
