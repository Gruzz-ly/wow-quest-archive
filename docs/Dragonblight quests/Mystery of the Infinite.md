==Objectives==
Chromie, at the top of [[Wyrmrest Temple]], has asked you to travel to the [[Bronze Dragonshrine]]. Once inside, place the [[Hourglass of Eternity]] on the ground.

Protect the hourglass for as long as it lasts and then return to her with whatever information you gain.
* Hourglass of Eternity protected
* [[Hourglass of Eternity]] (provided)

==Description==
A time storm at the Bronze Dragonshrine to the northeast is keeping [[immortal]]s from entering.

The [[infinite dragonflight|Infinite Dragonflight]] are in a fight inside with the defenders to wrest control of the dragonshrine. We must take this opportunity to gain information.

You are not immortal. You can cross into the dragonshrine and use the Hourglass of Eternity. Protect the hourglass for long enough and the leader of the Infinite Dragonflight should be revealed.

Be warned, the Infinite Dragonflight will try to stop you!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of the following:
|Dagger of the Returning Past
|Time-Bending Smasher
|Timeshattered Spire
|Twig of Happy Reminders
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
*26200 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Wyrmrest Accord]]

==Progress==
What news do you bring? What happened at the Bronze Dragonshrine?

Did you find out who the leader of the Infinite Dragonflight is?

==Completion==
You saw [[Nozdormu]]? That doesn't make any sense.

<Chromie thinks a moment about what you've said.>

Actually, that's great news! We had no idea of where or when the Lord of Time had gone to. We just knew that he had disappeared to deal with very important matters.

So, even though the leader of the Infinite Dragonflight wasn't revealed, you've discovered that Nozdormu is alive and well, and fighting back against them!

Thank you, <name>!

==Notes==
The Bronze Dragonshrine is located at {{coords|71.9|39.1|Dragonblight}}. When using the Hourglass, your "Future You" will assist you in the quest.

Two waves of 2, One wave of 3, One wave of a 75 elite.

Future You begins with these two lines:
:{{text|whisper|Future You|Hey there, <name>, don't be alarmed. It's me... you... from the future. I'm here to help.}}
:{{text|whisper|Future You|Heads up... here they come. I'll help as much as I can. Let's just keep them off the hourglass!}}
...whispers at least one of these lines:
:{{text|whisper|Future You|What? Am I here alone. We both have a stake at this, you know!}}
:{{text|whisper|Future You|No matter what, you can't die, because would mean that I would cease to exist, right? But, I was here before when I was you. I'm so confused!}}
:{{text|whisper|Future You|Sorry, but Chromie said that I couldn't reveal anything about your future to you. She said that if I did, I would cease to exist.}}
:{{text|whisper|Future You|Look at you fight; no wonder I turned to drinking.}}
:{{text|whisper|Future You|Wow, I'd forgotten how inexperienced I used to be.}}
:{{text|whisper|Future You|I can't believe that I used to wear that.}}
:{{text|whisper|Future You|Listen. I'm not supposed to tell you this, but there's going to be this party that you're invited to. Whatever you do, DO NOT DRINK THE PUNCH!}}
:{{text|whisper|Future You|Wish I could remember how many of the Infinite Dragonflight were going to try to stop you. This fight was so long ago.}}
...and ends with these two lines:
:{{text|whisper|Future You|Look, <name>, the hourglass has revealed [[Nozdormu]]!}}
:{{text|whisper|Future You|Farewell, <name>. Keep us alive and get some better equipment!}}

Just as is referred to in the quest, completion results with Nozdormu being permanently spawned for the player.
