==Objectives==
Deliver The High General's Head to [[Commander Eligor Dawnbringer]] at [[Wintergarde Keep]].
*[[The Head of the High General]]

==Description==
My old enemy, [[Brigitte Abbendis|High General Abbendis]], has come to [[Northrend]].

Somehow she survived the attacks on [[Tyr's Hand]] and brought a small force north. They've established [[New Hearthglen]] to the south.

While they could prove useful in fighting the [[Scourge]], Abbendis herself is far too shrewd an opponent to let live. Trust me, if we let them stand, she will be at our throats before the dust settles.

So, we'll deprive them of their leadership and go about our business. Bring me her head as proof.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Battlement Enforcer's Axe|Siege Captain's Gun|Mace of the Fallen Raven Priest|Stronghold Battlemace|Bloodtinged Spellblade}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|10|60}}
*25,650 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
It is done then?

==Completion==
An unfortunate, but necessary action that we had to take in dealing with Abbendis. In another lifetime, I think I could have imagined fighting side-by-side with her.

<The commander's voice trails off as he reflects a moment before proceeding.>

I'm a little concerned about this grand admiral you describe. [[Barean Westwind]] you say? I can't believe that he's still alive. He must be ancient. We'll have to deal with him later, however.<ref>In Patch 4.3.0, Barean Westwind did not appear, but this was likely a bug because his scripted text was being reworked. He was added back in later.</ref>

In the meantime, I think you've earned a reward and a little R & R.

==Notes==
;Battling the mobs in the cathedral:
*{{text|yell|High General Abbendis|You've come to test the might of the Onslaught?}}
*{{text|yell|High General Abbendis|Deal with this intrusion quickly.  I don't have time for this!}}
*{{text|yell|High General Abbendis|You may want to rethink your actions, fool.}}
*{{text|yell|High General Abbendis|Am I going to have to deal with this intrusion myself?}}

;Pre-Patch 4.3.0
*{{text|yell|High General Abbendis|Deal with them quickly.  I don't have time for this!}}
*{{text|yell|High General Abbendis|You may want to rethink your actions, fools!}}

;Aggro
:{{text|yell|Admiral Barean Westwind|Kill them Abbendis! Do not fail me!}}

;Reckless Onslaught
:{{text|say|High General Abbendis|Now I'll show you the REAL power of the Onslaught!}}

;On victory
:{{text|emote|The grand admiral studies you a moment through narrowed eyes.}}
:''Westwind walks over to Abbendis's corpse and kneels.''
:{{text|say|Admiral Barean Westwind|You served your purpose.}}
:''Standing, he laughs, then turns to leave.''
:{{text|say|Admiral Barean Westwind|I will see you in Icecrown, weakling... if you live that long!}}
:: Spoken as {{text|say|I will see you weaklings in Icecrown... if you live that long!}}, as the old group quest text was not re-recorded.
:''The grand admiral walks to the outer hallway and teleports out.''

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.3.0|note=No longer a group quest. NPC scripted text updated accordingly.}}
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added. Recommended group of 3 to complete.}}
