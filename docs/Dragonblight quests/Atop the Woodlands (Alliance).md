==Objectives==
Obtain the [[Ley Line Focus Control Amulet]] and use it to gain information from the Ley Line Focus in the [[Lothalor Woodlands]].

Then, return to the [[Image of Archmage Modera]] at Stars' Rest.
*Ley line focus information retrieved

==Description==
I'm convinced that there must be more of these foci, each of them in-turn redirecting the ley line energies. We still don't know precisely what they're doing with all of that power, though.

My guess is that you'll find another one atop the Lothalor Woodlands to the southeast. Once again you'll need to find the [[Lieutenant Ta'zinni|person in charge]] and take whatever controlling device they have in their possession as I'm sure that each focus has its own.

Be careful, <name> Those woods are very dangerous.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Kirin Tor Initiate's Sandals
|Violet Stalker Shoulderpads
|Azurehunter Handguards
|Dalaran Sentry Wristbraces
}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|5}}
*20300 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
What did you find up in the woods?

==Completion==
They're empowering their forces with it? That doesn't make any sense; the [[Dragonblight Mage Hunter|mage hunters]] aren't that powerful.

This must mean that they're only using the magic at the terminus of wherever they've directed the ley line to.

We're going to need more information if we're to have a chance at finding and stopping them!

==Notes==
*Pick up [[Strengthen the Ancients]] on the way!
*[[Lieutenant Ta'zinni]] circles the Ley Line Focus. Kill him to loot the Focus Control Amulet. 
*Use the Focus Control Amulet to channel information from the Ley Line Focus. You will gain the buff:
{{Effecttip

Then you can return to Archmage Modera.
