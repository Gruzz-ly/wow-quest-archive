==Objectives==
Defeat Thel'zan the Duskbringer and report to {{npc||High Commander Halford Wyrmbane}} at [[Wintergarde Keep]] in [[Dragonblight]]
* {{npc||Thel'zan the Duskbringer}} Defeated

==Description==
Every good story has a beginning and an ending, <name>. While your story is far from over, I'll be damned if it's not already turning into the stuff of legend! No matter what happens to us when this is all over, what you've done at Wintergarde will be a tale told for years to come.

Now, ally, when you are ready I will use the [[phylactery]] to coax Thel'zan out of hiding.

Should we somehow succeed, report the victory to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*20500 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Completion==
Wintergarde is saved because of you, <name>. To think that one <man/woman> could so swiftly turn the tides of battle is hard for most to comprehend; yet here we are - victorious! You have managed to restore the faith of these people and earned the respect of your commanding officers.

<Halford salutes.>

{{npc||Bolvar Fordragon||Lord Fordragon}} has returned to [[Angrathar the Wrathgate|Angrathar]] to prepare our forces for the destruction of the Wrathgate and has requested that you join him! I couldn't recommend a better soldier for the job, <name>.

==Notes==

Upon accepting the quest:
:{{text|say|{{NPC||Legion Commander Yorik}}|Steel yourselves, soldiers. <Name> has provided us us with the final piece of this puzzle. The dread [[lich]], Thel'zan, will soon come out of hiding, only to be rendered powerless against us!}}
:''Yorik walks forward and drops [[:Thel'zan's Phylactery]] on the ground in front of him.''
:{{text|say|Legion Commander Yorik|It is this [[phylactery]], Thel'zan's phylactery - that is the key to this victory!}}
:{{text|yell|{{NPC||Thel'zan the Duskbringer}}|I was... once like you. Mortal. Soft. Only flesh and bone. WEAK AND TIMID!}}
:''As Thel'zan activates his gateway, the ground shakes, with smoke and red lightning arcing between the two pillars.''
:{{text|say|Legion Commander Yorik|LEGION, STEADY YOURSELVES!}}

:''Thel'zan spawns and casts {{Abilities|Terrifying Countenance|id=49735|icon=spell_shadow_coneofsilence}} freezing all in terror!''
:{{text|yell|Thel'zan the Duskbringer|Our lord, {{NPC||Arthas Menethil||Arthas}} saw in me the frailty of man.}}
:{{text|yell|Thel'zan the Duskbringer|"Serve me in life and I will promise to rend the weakness from your soul. To erase it from existence!" To be chosen... blessed by the {{NPC||Lich King}} in such a way.}}
:{{text|yell|Thel'zan the Duskbringer|So serve him I did... Were it not for me the glorious dread citadel of [[Naxxramas]] may never have returned to [[Northrend]].}}
:{{text|yell|Thel'zan the Duskbringer|But enough talk... You have fought hard and come from the distant reaches of [[Azeroth|this world]] to face the Duskbringer. I shall not disappoint...}}
:{{text|yell|Thel'zan the Duskbringer|Just as our lord saved me, so too shall I save you!}}
: ''{{NPC||Bolvar Fordragon||Highlord Bolvar Fordragon}} spawns and runs down the ramp to stand behind the group.''
:{{text|yell|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Honor, courage, compassion and justice! Those were once the virtues you fought for as a cleric of the [[Argent Dawn]], Thel'zan.}}
* {{text|say|7th Legion Elite|It's the Highlord!}}
* {{text|say|7th Legion Elite|Lord Fordragon!}}
:{{text|yell|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|You dedicated your whole life to fighting the Scourge. You saw what they did to our beloved [[Lordaeron]]. The Lich King took everything from you!}}
[[File:An End And A Beginning - Bolvar and Thel'zan.jpg|thumb|The Duskbringer starts raising Minions of Thel'zan.]]
: ''Bolvar runs up right in front of Thel'zan.''
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|So how, then, did {{NPC||Inigo Montoy||Father Inigo Montoy}}, bastion of virtue for the Argent Dawn, become the embodiment of that which he hated most?}}
:{{text|yell|Thel'zan the Duskbringer|THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME YOU UTTER THAT NAME, [[Paladin|PALADIN]]! Breathe your dying breath!}}
:{{text|yell|Thel'zan the Duskbringer|Rise, my minions! Your master commands it!}}
:''Thel'zan summons several {{NPC||Minion of Thel'zan||Minions of Thel'zan}}. If the player completed [[The Great Masquerade quest chain]], Bolvar says...''
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Good to see you still alive and kicking, <name>. Don't think that I'd forgotten what you did for me in [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]], oh so long ago.}}
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Now, be free and join the battle! Let us end this together!}}
:''Bolvar casts {{Abilities|Fordragon's Resolve|id=49765|icon=spell_holy_summonchampion}} on all players and NPCs in the area, freeing them from Thel'zan's spell, giving them all additional health, and increasing their melee, ranged and casting speed by 35%.''

[[File:An End And A Beginning - Outro.jpg|thumb|Bolvar and the 7th Legion victorious.]]
On victory:
:{{text|yell|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|Victory for the [[Alliance]]!}}
: ''Bolvar turns to you.''
:{{text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|You have saved Wintergarde! With Thel'zan's filth washed away, the 7th Legion will easily clean up the remaining [[Scourge]]. When you are done here, report to [[Angrathar the Wrathgate|Angrathar]]!}}
: ''Bolvar salutes and runs back up to the tunnel and despawns.''
