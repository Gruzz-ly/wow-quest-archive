==Objectives==
Place a Destructive Ward at the end of the path leading out of [[Obsidian Dragonshrine]]. Protect the ward until it is fully charged, then return to [[Serinar]].
*Destructive Ward Fully Charged
* [[Destructive Wards]] (provided)

==Description==
They're drawing power from the bones of my dead brothers...

I have no love for the [[Cult of the Damned|cult]], but I'm baffled by their audacity. There will be no mercy shown for them... not that I ever would have anyway.

Ensure that they have no place to flee when the slaughter starts. Place a destructive ward at the end of the path leading out of the shrine. Defend it until it is fully charged.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|60}}
*20750 [[XP]]
*325 reputation with [[Wyrmrest Accord]]

==Progress==
Have you placed the ward?

==Completion==
Excellent. When they begin to flee in fear, the ward shall be there to wish them a fond farewell.

==Notes==
*Standard "defend someone/something" quest. There are four waves of mobs: two waves of one mob, one of two mobs, and one of three mobs. The ward will progressively gain in power. When it is fully charged, it can burn down the final wave.

==Progression==
{{The Obsidian Dragonshrine}}
