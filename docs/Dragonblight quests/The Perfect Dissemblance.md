==Objectives==
[[Agent Skully]] at [[New Hearthglen]] has asked you steal the image of a [[Onslaught Raven Priest]]. Return the Banshee's Magic Mirror to her when you have done so.
*Onslaught Raven Priest's image stolen
*[[Banshee's Magic Mirror]] (provided)

==Description==
You may wonder how I can maintain this guise; I use a magic mirror that was loaned to me by the [[Spy Mistress Repine|spy mistress]].

It only has so much power in it, but I think there's enough for the both of us. Here, take it. I want you to use it to impersonate one of the Onslaught [[raven priest]]s.

Be quick about it... I have no idea how long my glamour will last while you have the mirror.

Realize that you won't immediately be perfectly disguised, so don't count on it being foolproof until I've had a chance to help you. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5}}
*20300 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
Please tell me that you didn't break the mirror?! 

==Completion==
Not bad, <class>. Now that the priest's image is trapped within the mirror, I have something else that needs doing. 

==Notes==
Use the Magic Mirror on an [[Onslaught Raven Priest]] to copy their appearance:
:{{Abilities|Banshee's Magic Mirror|id=48648|Actually, it's not quite perfect. It won't fool them for long.|icon=spell_shadow_nethercloak}}

Doing this will cause two [[Onslaught Footman|Onslaught Footmen]] to spawn and attack both the Raven Priest and the player:
:{{Text|say|Onslaught Raven Priest|HELP! HELP! THIS <MAN/WOMAN> HAS STOLEN MY IMAGE!}}
:{{Text|say|Onslaught Footman (1)|What's going on here, sarge?}}
:{{Text|say|Onslaught Footman (2)|I don't know. Better kill them both to be on the safe side!}}

You mustn't be in shapeshift form or shapeshift after using the mirror and stealing the image, otherwise you lose the disguise.
