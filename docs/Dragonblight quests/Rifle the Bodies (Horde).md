==Objectives==
Find the Moonrest Gardens Plans and return them to the [[Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver]] at [[Agmar's Hammer]].
*[[Moonrest Gardens Plans]]

==Description==
The Moonrest Gardens to the southwest were the final resting place of a group of [[Highborne]] elves. It was also a ley line nexus.

The [[blue dragonflight]] used a magical device they call a [[surge needle]] to destroy that nexus, freeing the power to redirect at their will.

I want more information and you are going to get it for me!

After the land was destroyed at the ruins, the ghosts of the Highborne rose up and decimated half of the mage hunters there. Go rifle their corpses for clues.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
You have returned.  What did you uncover?

==Completion==
Curious, they seek an accord with the Ethereum. The [[ethereal]]s could prove a powerful ally for [[Malygos]] and his madness.

This will not do!
