==Objectives==
Wait for [[Inquisitor Hallard]] to finish his Righteous Sermon and return to [[High Commander Halford Wyrmbane]] at [[Wintergarde Keep]] in [[Dragonblight]] with the information you recover.
* Righteous Sermon Heard

==Description==
[[Godfrey Goodard]], once a righteous man and mayor of Wintergarde, is now an agent of the [[Scourge]]. His transformation from man to undying [[ghoul]] has taken place slowly, over time. He hears the call of the [[Lich King]] now and lives only to serve his master.

But as with all Scourge, Godfrey knows the language of death and with proper motivation, will tell us what we need to know about the tome.

Once you hear what you need to hear, return to the High Commander at the front lines. I'll clean up here as needed.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of the following rewards|Highseas Wristwraps|Glade Wanderer Boots|Westwind Shoulderguards|Sinner's Repentance}}

==Progress==
What news do you bring from Hallard and Godfrey?

==Completion==
We should have known about the damned [[Wintergarde Mausoleum|mausoleum]]. This is preposterous. [[Duke August Foehammer]] and [[Ambo Cash]] will be dispatched to the front lines in preparation for our next assault.

Once you have [[The Demo-gnome|cleared]] the [[Wintergarde Mine|mines]] I will send you to Foehammer so that we may begin our attack against the Scourge of [[Naxxramas]]!

The information you have gathered thus far will be sent to [[Bolvar Fordragon|Lord Fordragon]] at the [[Angrathar the Wrathgate|Wrathgate]] upon the wings of our most able [[gryphon]]!

:{{text|say|Inquisitor Hallard|GODFREY! Hear me, fiend! Hear me, for I am the [[Light]], here to deliver you from evil!}}
:{{text|emote|Mayor Godfrey growls.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Hallard|Good, I have your attention, then, Godfrey?}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Hallard|We can do this in one of two ways, Godfrey. First, I will simply ask you to tell me what the unholy markings etched upon the pages of this tome mean. What say you?}}
:{{text|emote|Mayor Godfrey hisses!}}
:{{text|say|Mayor Godfrey|Tell you nothing, preacher.}}
:{{text|say|Mayor Godfrey|What can you do to me that [[Kel'Thuzad]] has not? That the [[Lich King]] will not?}}
:{{text|say|Mayor Godfrey|The book is your salvation, yes... but nothing will you know. NOTHING I SAY! NOTHING!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Hallard|Then it is option two.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Hallard|I say a prayer for you now, lost soul. May the Light take you gracefully.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Hallard|Let the sermon begin.}}

;Prayers
*{{text|say|Inquisitor Hallard|LET THE LIGHT IN, GODFREY GODDARD!}}
*{{text|say|Inquisitor Hallard|May the power of Light compel you!}}
*{{text|say|Inquisitor Hallard|The power of the Lich King pales in comparison to the glory of the Light!}}
*{{text|say|Inquisitor Hallard|Do not fight me, fiend!  The time of your atonement is now!}}

*{{text|say|Mayor Godfrey|The pain is unbearable!}}
*{{text|say|Mayor Godfrey|Never felt hurt like this!}}

;Outro
:{{text|say|Mayor Godfrey|I tell you anything you want!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Hallard|I thought you would see the Light, Godfrey... Now speak quickly, fiend. What does it say?}}
:{{text|say|Mayor Godfrey|It tells of the coming apocalypse. How this world will burn and be reborn from death.}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Hallard|RUBBISH! Godfrey do you take me for a fool? Do not spew your [[Scourge]] propaganda at a man of the Light, heathen! Speak now or I will have the peasants craft a [[holy water]] bath and dip you into it like a dog with fleas!}}
:{{text|say|Mayor Godfrey|NOOOO!!! I tell you! I tell you everything!}}
:{{text|say|Mayor Godfrey|[[Human]]s... Beneath the earth of [[Carrion Fields|Wintergarde Village]] you built a [[Wintergarde Mausoleum|mausoleum]]! Why do you think Naxxramas attacked that spot? [[Thel'zan the Duskbringer|Thel'zan]] hides deep in your own crypt and sends a thousand-thousand corpses at you! Perish you will...}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Hallard|What? There is a mausoleum beneath the old village? What fools we are to not have noticed. We will find and strike down your master now, Godfrey. We will end this nightmare.}}
:{{text|say|Mayor Godfrey|How? Humans truly are stupid, yes? Thel'zan the Duskbringer! Thel'zan the [[Lich]]! He who is born of human flesh and bone, sacrificed all power, protected by the Lich King!}}
:{{text|say|Mayor Godfrey|You cannot stop Thel'zan! He bears the dark gift, bestowed upon him by the Lich King himself!}}
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Hallard|You let us worry about how we kill the bastard, Godfrey.}}
: ''Hallard turns to you.''
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Hallard|Return to Halford with the information the good mayor was kind enough to submit, <name>. I will finish here and squeeze whatever else this wretch might know about Thel'zan. Now, I will show Godfrey the rarely shown "option three."}}
: ''Hallard turns back to Godfrey.''
:{{text|say|Inquisitor Hallard|Let's you and I have a chat about some things, Godfrey.}}

The completion text mentions clearing the mines. That quest chain started with [[The Demo-gnome]].
