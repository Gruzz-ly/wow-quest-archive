== Objectives ==
Enter the [[Ruby Dragonshrine]] through the southern pass and search for [[Ruby Acorn]]s. Use the Ruby Acorns on the fallen red dragons to return their bodies to the earth. Return to [[Vargastrasz]] once the task is complete.
* [[Ruby Keeper (Dragonblight)|Ruby Keeper]] Returned to the Earth (6)

== Description ==
I have another task that needs attention. I have brothers that are falling in the battle overhead and if we do not act quickly, they will only bolster the [[emberwyrm]] ranks.

Get into the shrine through the pass in the south... the [[Scourge]] presence should be lighter there.

Search the shrine for ruby acorns that have fallen from the tree and plant them near the bodies of my fallen brood. Through this, they can give new life... a proud fate for any of my kind. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5|60}}

== Completion ==
In the earth, my brothers can grant life anew. You have saved them from a fate far worse than death.

I don't know a word in your tongue that could express how much this means to my kind. Thank you, <race>
