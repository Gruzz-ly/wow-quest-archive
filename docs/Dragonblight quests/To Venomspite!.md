==Objectives==
Deliver the Blight Specimen to [[Chief Plaguebringer Middleton]] at [[Venomspite]] in eastern [[Dragonblight]].
*[[Blight Specimen]] (provided)

==Description==
I got a special bat all lined up for you, buddy. Fastest and smoothest ride I've got. He'll take you right to Venomspite - in style.

Just hand that vial over to Chief Plaguebringer Middleton once you land.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2050 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with The [[Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
You are the delivery boy?

==Completion==
Oh joyous day! And look, just beyond the mountain to the northeast creeps a whole field of Scourge for us to obliterate!

==Notes==
You will be automatically flown to Venomspite when you accept the quest, unless you are mounted, in which case you will have to abandon the quest and reacquire it. Alternatively, you can walk there or purchase the flight if you already have the flight path.
