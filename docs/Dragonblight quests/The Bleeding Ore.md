==Objectives==
[[Siege Engineer Quarterflash]] at [[Wintergarde Keep]] in [[Dragonblight]] wants you to recover 10 samples of Strange Ore from [[Wintergarde Mine]].
*[[Strange Ore]] (10)
*[[Quarterflash's Mining Pick]] (provided)

==Description==
Hours before the [[Naxxramas]] invasion, one of the miners stumbled upon a dark ore that was oozing a viscous fluid. In the chaos that occurred during the evacuation of the mine, we lost the samples taken from the alien node. Now the [[Scourge]] prospects the ore for use in their machines of death.

You must get back to Wintergarde Mine, due northeast of here in the [[Carrion Fields]], and recover the strange ore. It is imperative to our mission's success!

==Progress==
Have you recovered samples of the strange ore?

==Completion==
This might be the moment, the very second, that the tide turns against the Scourge. You have proven yourself as a hero of the Alliance, at least in my eyes, <name>.

Now if you would be so kind as to give me some space. I will require additional time to study this ore in order to isolate impurities and weakness.

Carry on, ally. I will contact you once I have an update.

==Notes==
This quest combines well with [[The Search for Slinkin]] and [[Not In Our Mine]], as both send you to Wintergarde Mine.
