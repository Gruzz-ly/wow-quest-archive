==Objectives==
Report to [[Dranosh Saurfang|Saurfang the Younger]] at the Kor'kron Vanguard.

==Description==
You have done well, <brother or sister>. All that you have faced, you have done as a champion of the Horde. The Scourged Anub'ar of Azjol-Nerub, crushed under your foot! The taunka, brave and powerful new members of the Horde, because of you! Our super-weapon against the Scourge, tested and perfected by you!

The time has come, the moment is now - our elite soldiers at the Wrathgate need you. The son of Saurfang awaits your arrival at the Kor'kron Vanguard. Go now, northeast to the Wrathgate.

==Rewards==

==Completion==
Lok'tar ogar! I have heard much about you, <name>. Your battle scars run deep - a testament to your dedication and power!

With the flanking attacks of the Lich King crushed in both the west and east, only the forces at the gate remain. We gain ground each day, soon to break through this wall and into Icecrown!

Once we stop the skeletal dragons, Highlord Fordragon and I will take the field.
