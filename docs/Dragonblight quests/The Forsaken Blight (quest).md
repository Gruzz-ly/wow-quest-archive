==Objectives==
Deliver The Forsaken Blight to [[Doctor Sintar Malefious]] at [[Agmar's Hammer]].
*[[The Forsaken Blight]] (provided)

==Description==
I have prepared a package that must be delivered to Doctor Sintar Malefious at Agmar's Hammer. The contents of the package include the final blight specimen along with instructions on preparation and samples of the reactive agent.

You will find Agmar's Hammer in western Dragonblight. Just look for the black, jagged metal orc buildings - that will be Agmar's Hammer.

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
*15250 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with The [[Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
About bloody time!

==Completion==
<Doctor Malefious looks through the contents of the package.>

Glorious! Exactly to specifications!

Here is your payment, <name>. Keep what you've seen and done to yourself. This work is all classified - information is given out on a need to know basis.
