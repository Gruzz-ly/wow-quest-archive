== Objectives ==
Smear the [[Blood of Loguhn]] upon yourself and then return to [[Elder Ko'nani]] at [[Moa'ki Harbor]].
* [[Loguhn]]'s Blood Smeared

== Description ==
Already it goes from bad to worse. There is only one course to take... regrettably, [[Loguhn]] must die!

He's the alpha male of the [[Snowfall Glade]] tribe and one mean [[wolvar]]. But it's the only way to get a short break from their attacks and stealing forays.

You will find the "Render of Flesh" in front of his hovel upon the northern rise of the glade. It's larger than the others and hard to miss. Kill him and smear his blood upon yourself, both to show your dominance and respect.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Sharkdiver's Bracers|Gleaming Tuskring|Sea Rusted Gauntlets|Baleen Braided Collar}}
You will also receive: {{cost|10|60}}

== Progress ==
Is that Loguhn's blood or your own, <race>?

== Completion ==
Loguhn's honorable sacrifice at your hands is exactly what my people need. Now we will make the most of the wolvar in-fighting for his place.

It will have to be enough.

== Notes ==
Loghun can be found at coordinates {{coords|46.4|59.1|Dragonblight}}. Smear the blood while you're standing over his corpse, and not in front of Ko'nani.
