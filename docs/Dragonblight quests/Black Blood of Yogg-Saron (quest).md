==Objectives==
[[Borus Ironbender]] at [[Agmar's Hammer]] in the [[Dragonblight]] wants you to recover 10 [[Black Blood of Yogg-Saron Sample]]s.
* [[Black Blood of Yogg-Saron Sample]] (10)
* [[Ironbender's Mining Pick]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Angrathar]], the Wrathgate... I watched as the metal holding the gate together pulsed and undulated as if it were alive! In 50 years I've never seen metal "breathe."

Only ones who knew anything about it were the [[tuskarr]]. They called it the "Black Blood of Yogg-Saron" and told me to keep my distance.

There's a sinkhole outside [[Icemist Village]] to the west called the [[Pit of Narjun]]. I've heard of these sinkholes being rich with this strange ore. If you head that way, could you try and get me some samples?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*20300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|4|86|}} compensation at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
What's life without risks?

==Completion==
It's so light... As if it weighs nothing at all! I'll need time to analyze the metal and see if I can do anything with it! Tests! I need to run tests!

I'll keep in contact, <name>. If anything comes of this, you'll be the first to know.
