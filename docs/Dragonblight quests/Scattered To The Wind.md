==Objectives==
[[Ambo Cash]] at the [[Wintergarde Mausoleum]] in [[Dragonblight]] wants you to recover 8 Wintergarde Munitions.
* [[Wintergarde Munitions]] (8)

==Description==
The munitions drop went badly, friend. The shipment of ammo from [[Westguard Keep]] was intercepted by the [[frost wyrm|frostwyrms]] circling overhead. The [[flying machine]]s were torn apart in a matter of seconds and their cargo was scattered to the wind. Most of it is still topside - on [[the Carrion Fields]].

I'm gonna need you to go back up and recover the munitions crates that are scattered all over this damned place.

Hurry it up! We can't start this offensive without guns and ammo, <buddy/missy>!

==Progress==
Where are my munitions, <fella/lady>?

==Completion==
Just in time! Some of my soldiers got a little overzealous and decided to wade into the crypts directly to the east and west of us. Needless to say, they were quickly overwhelmed by those mindless [[ghoul]]s. We need to rescue the survivors!
