==Objectives==
Seek out {{NPC||Alexstrasza the Life-Binder}} at [[Wyrmrest Temple]] in [[Dragonblight]]. 

==Description==
Our assault against [[Angrathar the Wrathgate|Angrathar]] has staggered the [[Scourge]], but they remain unrelenting. From overhead they send their [[frost wyrm]]s to strafe the field of battle, making an advance upon the gate itself impossible. The frost wyrm attacks must be stopped, but before we defile the bones of ancient dragons, we must gain permission from their queen.

Travel southeast to Wyrmrest Temple and seek out Queen Alexstrasza. Tell her what we must do and ask her for guidance.

Go now, <name>! 

==Completion==
You have come seeking my council, [[mortal]]. This I know, but do you know what it is that you face?

<{{npc||Alexstrasza}} points northward.>

North of here are the dying grounds of {{NPC||Galakrond}} - progenitor of [[dragon]]kind. It is from Galakrond that the [[Titan]]s created the [[Dragon Aspect|Aspects]]. Imagine, then, the power of Galakrond. His size alone was greater than all of the Aspects combined! Now attempt to understand what the Scourge do in the Great Dragonblight.

Frost wyrms, mortal, should be the least of your concerns.

==Notes==
Hopefully, players already have Wyrmrest's flight path. If so, take a gryphon from [[Fordragon Hold]]. If not, head back to the [[7th Legion Front]] and then run south down the [[Path Path of the Titans]] to Wyrmrest Temple.
