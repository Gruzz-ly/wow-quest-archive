== Objectives ==
Deliver the Favor of Zangus to [[Warden Jodi Moonsong]] at [[Stars' Rest]].
* [[The Favor of Zangus]] (provided)

== Description ==
An inscription on the back of the favor reads,

"To my favorite pupil,

If you continue to show promise, I will teach you wonders beyond your imaginings.

If you do not, I will have you destroyed!

As ever,

[[High Cultist Zangus]]"

No doubt the [[warden]] at Stars' Rest will want to see this.

== Progress ==
I sense something foul is near.

It is upon your person! What is it, <name?>

== Completion ==
So, the leader of the [[Cult of the Damned|cultists]] has revealed himself. We have a name.

Vanity and pride will be his downfall!

== Notes ==
Dropped from [[Anub'ar Cultist]]s (which the character is sent to retrieve items from during the quest [[Kill the Cultists]]).
