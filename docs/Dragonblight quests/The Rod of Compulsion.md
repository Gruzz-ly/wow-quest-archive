==Objectives==
Deliver the Torturer's Rod to [[High Executor Wroth]] at [[Venomspite]].
* [[Torturer's Rod]] (provided)

==Description==
A rod drops from [[Torturer Alphonse|Alphonse]]'s dead hand. There are pulsing magical runes along its length.

Could this be how he was getting his confessions?

Better let the high executor have a look at it. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|50}}
*10,150 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
Did you get that rod from their torturer?

==Completion==
Alphonse had it you say? That makes sense.

I recognize it from my youthful days as a torturer in the court of [[King Terenas]] of fallen [[Lordaeron]]. It's known as a [[Rod of Compulsion|rod of compulsion]].

<The high executor wrings his hands together in evil anticipation of what's to come.>

I have an idea for how we can make good use of it!
