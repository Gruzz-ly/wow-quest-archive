== Objectives ==
Find [[Slinkin the Demo-gnome]] in [[Wintergarde Mine]]. Use [[:Quarterflash's Homing Bot]] if you need help finding the mine.
*[[Quarterflash's Homing Bot]] (provided)

== Description ==
While I have not heard from Slinkin or know what fate has befallen him, perhaps I can assist in finding him.

<Quarterflash holds up a tiny mechanical toy.>

This is not a toy, newfound compatriot. It is, in fact, my latest mechanical creation. The machine was created with the sole purpose of finding that which has been lost. These are unfortunate circumstances, but the machine is your best chance at finding Slinkin.

When you are ready to begin, place the bot on the ground next to me.

== Completion ==
<There is a note in Slinkin's death grip.>

Chased into a dead end. Hidden for now, but they know I'm here. It won't be long until they find me.

The miners work tirelessly to unearth the strange ore that fuels the [[Scourge]] war machines. There is much banter. The [[language of death]] confounds me, but I have been able to identify commonly uttered sounds and phrases. The word "[[Yogg-Saron]]" is said with great contempt and is usually followed by loud outbursts. They refer to the ore as "[[saronite]]." Meaning?

== Notes ==
[[File:Quarterflash's Homing Bot.jpg|thumb|Quarterflash's Homing Bot.]]
The quests [[Not In Our Mine]] and [[The Bleeding Ore]] have you delve into the same mine as this quest.

Using [[Quarterflash's Homing Bot]] next to Quarterflash spawns a small bot to guide the player to the mine:
:{{Text|whisper|Siege Engineer Quarterflash|The bot will adjust its speed to match your own. I would suggest you mount up to speed things along. By the way, the bot was put together with [[Doomwalker|salvaged components]] from a pile of scrap metal delivered to me from Outland. There were some side effects.}}
:{{Text|say|Quarterflash's Homing Bot|Trajectory locked.}}
:{{Text|say|Quarterflash's Homing Bot|Engage maximum speed.}}

The bot runs north through the keep, along the mountain path down to the entrance of Wintergarde Mine,{{Co|80.37|45.96|Dragonblight}} where it stops and dies:
:{{Text|say|Quarterflash's Homing Bot|Directive accomplished.}}
:{{Text|say|Quarterflash's Homing Bot|System failure in five, f-o-u-r...}}

Using the bot is completely optional. The quest can be completed without using it.
