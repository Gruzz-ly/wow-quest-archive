==Objectives==
[[Highlord Leoric Von Zeldig]] at [[Wintergarde Keep]] in [[Dragonblight]] wants you to recover 10 Wintergard Miner's Cards.
* [[Wintergarde Miner's Card]] (10)

==Description==
That blasted necropolis blindsided us! In the wake of the destruction [[Wintergarde Mine]] was lost. Worse yet, [[Kel'Thuzad]]'s acolytes have raised the slain miners as [[Scourge]] and are using them to supply their [[Scourge Siegesmith|siegesmiths]] with materials from our mine!

The supply line must be halted and our lost brothers must be put to rest.

Travel to Wintergarde Mine, northeast of here in [[the Carrion Fields]], and destroy the [[Risen Wintergarde Miner|risen miners]]. Return to me with their miner cards so that I may put their passing in our registry.

==Progress==
Did you recover their cards?

==Completion==
<Leoric takes the cards from you.>

I will get these to our recorder and deliver the grim news to the families of the miners.

There is still much to be done if we are to succeed here and ultimately at the [[Angrathar the Wrathgate|Wrathgate]]. [[Bolvar Fordragon|Lord Fordragon]] is depending on us.

==Notes==
This quest combines well with [[The Search for Slinkin]], as both send you to Wintergarde Mine.
