== Objectives ==
[[Ambo Cash]] at the [[Wintergarde Mausoleum]] in [[Dragonblight]] wants you to save 8 Injured 7th Legion Soldiers.
* [[Injured 7th Legion Soldier]] Saved (8)

== Description ==
We've set up [[7th Legion Chain Gun|chain guns]] and barricades directly to the east and west. Our injured soldiers are hiding in both rooms - trying their best to not alert the {{npc||Mindless Ghoul||mindless ghouls}} to their presence.

Now that we have ammo, I need you to man one of the chain guns and use it to blast a path clear for our soldiers! Once you're on board, call a soldier out from hiding and then lay down a heavy fire to keep the [[Scourge]] off him!

== Progress ==
Have you rescued our injured soldiers?

== Completion ==
<Name>, I haven't seen heroics like that since [[Silithus]]!

I'll be sure that each and every one of those soldiers puts in a recommendation to [[Bolvar Fordragon|Lord Fordragon]] that you be promoted!

Now, on to more pressing matters. We've gotten reports back from our scouts that [[Thel'zan the Duskbringer|Thel'zan]] is close.

== Notes ==
Mount one of the [[7th Legion Chain Gun]]s, which have two abilities:
#{{Abilities|7th Legion Chain Gun|id=49190|range=100 yd|cd=0.5 sec|A low fuel cost makes this mid to long range gun an absolute necessity in the field. Aim low and let it rip!|icon=spell_shadow_rainoffire}}
#{{Abilities|Call Out Injured Soldier|id=49550|range=Unlimited|cd=10 sec|Calls out an [[Injured 7th Legion Soldier|injured 7th Legion soldier]] from their hiding place. Defend them!|icon=ability_warrior_rallyingcry}}

Practice laying down cover fire (#1 by default, spam it!). Once you've got enough practice, use Call Out Injured Soldier (#2 by default) to spawn one and keep the [[Mindless Ghoul]]s off them as they run toward you. They can take some hits, but not a lot. Upon using Call Out:
*{{Text|say|<name>|Come out, soldier! I'll cover you!}}
*{{Text|say|<name>|Soldier, run to me! I'll clear a path with the chain gun!}}

Upon reaching the player:
*{{Text|say|Injured 7th Legion Soldier|I was almost ghoul bait! Thanks for the rescue!}}
*{{Text|say|Injured 7th Legion Soldier|It's a good thing you came along, ally! We were done for!}}
*{{Text|say|Injured 7th Legion Soldier|Thanks for the cover fire! It's a MADHOUSE down there!}}
*{{Text|say|Injured 7th Legion Soldier|Wow, I thought I was a goner! Thanks, friend!}}

There are two pits with two chain guns each. The western one (right side facing in) has fewer Mindless Ghouls for some reason.
