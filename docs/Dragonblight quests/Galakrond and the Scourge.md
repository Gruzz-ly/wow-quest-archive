==Objectives==
Speak with [[Torastrasza]] at [[Wyrmrest Temple]] in [[Dragonblight]]. 

==Description==
Atop [[the Wicked Coil]], the Grand Necrolord of the Scourge, [[Grand Necrolord Antiok|Antiok]], sits upon the shoulders of the reconstructed [[storm giant]] lord, [[Thiassi the Lightning Bringer|Thiassi]]. From there he commands the armies of undead to work day and night to unearth [[Galakrond]]'s massive bones. Should they succeed in raising Galakrond, all of your efforts will have been for naught.

While I cannot call down the full fury of the [[red dragonflight]] to assist you in your journey, I will grant you my blessing. Go now and speak with my majordomo, Torastrasza.

==Completion==
The bravery of [[mortal]]s never fails to astound me. Death affixes its cold stare upon you and in return you rise to challenge its assertion! It is why your kind is so loved... and so hated.

Even though the Red Dragonflight is entrenched in [[Nexus War|a war]] with [[Malygos]], there is something that we can do to help.
