==Objectives==
Deliver your Letter of Introduction to Wyrmrest Temple to [[Tariolstrasz]] at [[Wyrmrest Temple]].
* [[Letter of Introduction to Wyrmrest Temple (Horde)]] (provided)

==Description==
<name>, you must travel as swiftly as you can to Wyrmrest Temple and present this letter to the steward, Tariolstrasz.

The temple sits in the center of the [[Dragonblight]]. Follow the road east until it ends, and then cross The [[Dragon Wastes]] to get to it.

I'm sure that when the steward reads your introduction, he'll see to it that you gain an audience with Queen [[Alexstrasza]]. We can only hope that we're not too late.

Thank you for all that you have done on our behalf. Safe journeys!

==Progress==
Yes, what can I do for you, <race>?

==Completion==
A letter of introduction to meet with the queen? Let me see that.

Whatever your business is, I hope that it's important.  The skies are full of attacking blues today!
