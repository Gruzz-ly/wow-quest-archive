==Objectives==
Collect a sample of Rockflesh from the [[Ravaged Crystalline Ice Giant|Ice Giant corpse]]{{coords|56.2|11.9|Dragonblight}} at [[Ice Heart Cavern|the cavern]] entrance in [[the Crystal Vice]], north of [[Zort|Zort's]] location. After this task is complete, return to Zort near the center of the canyon.
*[[Sample of Rockflesh]]

==Description==
Cold out here, isn't it, <race>? [[Ko'char the Unbreakable|Ko'char]] has refused to meet with me. It seems he has more pressing things on his mind - namely, the [[jormungar]] that have been attacking them from the cavern below. Maybe you can help me convince Ko'char that I'm one of the good guys.

I saw a giant being eaten by some of the worms at the entrance to the cavern north of here... I'm still puzzled as to how the worms are killing them so easily. Bring me a sample from one of his wounds.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|18|5}}

==Progress==
You've returned with my sample then? I'm glad the cold didn't claim you.

==Completion==
This is perfect. Thank you, <class>.
