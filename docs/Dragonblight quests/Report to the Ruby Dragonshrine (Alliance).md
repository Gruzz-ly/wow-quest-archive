== Objectives ==
Report to [[Ceristrasz]] on the ridge east of the [[Ruby Dragonshrine]], west of [[Wyrmrest Temple|Wyrmrest]].

== Description ==
We need you at the Ruby Dragonshrine

The [[dragon]]s are beset on all sides by the [[blue dragonflight|blue flight]] and the [[scourge]]... they're in no better a state than we are. The situation seems dire, but this affords us a rare opportunity to establish a valuable alliance.

I secured a regiment to aid the [[red dragonflight]] against the Scourge at the Ruby Dragonshrine. If you have a fight in you, please go find Ceristrasz on the ridge east of the shrine and help him in any way that you can.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||56}}

== Completion ==
[[Lauriel Trueblade|Ambassador Lauriel]] sent you?

If you talk to her again, please let her know that we are very appreciative of her aid. We are fighting battles on far too many fronts.

==Progression==
