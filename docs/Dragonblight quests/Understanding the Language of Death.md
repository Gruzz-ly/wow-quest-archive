== Objectives ==
Take the Flesh-bound Tome to [[Inquisitor Hallard]] at the [[Wintergarde Keep]] prison.
* [[Flesh-bound Tome (Alliance quest item) (2)]] (provided)

== Description ==
Take the book and follow the path leading up to the [[barracks]]. Once inside the barracks take the staircase down to the prison. At the prison you will find Inquisitor Hallard and our mayor, [[Mayor Godfrey|Godfrey]]. I believe Godfrey might be the missing piece of this puzzle and Hallard the man to put it all together.

Go now!

== Progress ==
You come from [[High Command#Alliance High Command|high command]], my <son/girl>?

== Completion ==
Perhaps, with proper motivation, Godfrey will tell us what he knows about the tome.

<Hallard turns to Mayor Godfrey.>

Isn't that right, mayor?
