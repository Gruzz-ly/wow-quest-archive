==Description==
<The fur on this cloak is worn and tattered, but it is still warm. It has seen many years in the harsh, unforgiving blizzards of the north.

The [[icetusk tribe]] has not been seen on [[Azeroth]] until now, someone in [[Northrend]] might know more about them.>

You will receive:
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] 700x [[Azerite (resource)]]
*{{cost|11|70|}}
*8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Hello friend, my you smell like strange fish, where have you been? Is that too personal of a question?  No matter, how can this one help you?

Ah yes, the Icetusk, a most curious tale of a small tribe.

They resisted the [[Lich King]]'s promises and set out on huge canoes to find salvation.

And yet, all they found was hardship and despair. In dark times, they turned to [[necromancy]], and thus the tribe has lived on, but only barely. A sad tale.

Oh! I fished this up this morning, it is yours if you like.
