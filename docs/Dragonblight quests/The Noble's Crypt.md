== Objectives ==
[[Cavalier Durkon]] at [[Wintergarde Keep]] wants you to slay Necrolord Amarion.
* [[Necrolord Amarion]] slain

== Description ==
Held within the cold stone walls of this crypt are the remains of the nobles and dignitaries that died in [[Northrend]]. At its very core now sits a necrolord who raises the corpses as servants of the Scourge.

You must make your way to the bottom of the [[Wintergarde Crypt]] and kill Necrolord Amarion. Only then will the assault from within cease!

And <name>, be on the lookout for any information that might be laying about inside the room where Amarion resides.

== Rewards ==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox| |Wastewind Garments|Snowfall Reaver Hood|Iceshear Pauldrons|Crystalplate Gauntlets}}

== Progress ==
Is Amarion dead?

== Completion ==
Now if we could stop the [[Scourge]] attacks coming from outside the keep we might be able to send help to [[Bolvar Fordragon|Lord Fordragon]] at the [[Angrathar the Wrathgate|Wrathgate]].

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Secrets of the Scourge]] from the [[Flesh-bound Tome (Alliance)|Flesh-bound Tome]] after killing Amarion.
