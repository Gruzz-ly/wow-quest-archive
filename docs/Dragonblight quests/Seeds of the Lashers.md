==Objectives==
[[Lord Itharius]] at the top of [[Wyrmrest Temple]] has asked you to return with 3 Lasher Seeds.
* [[Lasher Seed]] (3)

==Description==
We need more weapons in the fight against the [[Scourge]]. The natural properties of the [[Emerald Dragonshrine]] to the southeast may be the answer.

Any [[undead|unliving]] creature, save those that [[Sylvanas]] has [[Forsaken|redeemed]], that steps foot into the dragonshrine falls to dust.

I want to test a theory, and I want you to be my instrument in doing so, young <race>. Go to the Emerald Dragonshrine and take the seeds from the [[Emerald Lasher|emerald lashers]] therein.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|60}}
*20750 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Wyrmrest Accord]]

==Progress==
And just how many seeds have you managed to acquire thus far?

==Completion==
Even now I can feel the pulse of nature from within these seeds.

We must put them to good use!
