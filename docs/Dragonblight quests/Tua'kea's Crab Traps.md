==Objectives==
Collect 8 of [[Tua'kea]]'s Crab Traps and return them to him at [[Moa'ki Harbor]].
*[[Tua'kea Crab Trap]] (8)
*[[Tua'kea's Breathing Bladder]] (provided)

==Description==
With all the troubles, I've lost my assistants. I was wondering if maybe you could help me?

I have many crab traps under the waves of the harbor. Will you retrieve them for me? I'm too old for that sort of thing and the waters can be very dangerous.

Please, take this bladder. It will help you to breathe while you're down there.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
How many crab traps did you manage to retrieve?

==Completion==
I'm a simple trapper. The world has turned upside-down all of a sudden. It doesn't make sense.

I hope that you'll be able to set it right again.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Signs of Big Watery Trouble]] while collecting the 8 traps.
