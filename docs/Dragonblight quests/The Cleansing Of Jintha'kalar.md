==Objectives==
[[Crusader Valus]] at [[Light's Trust]] in [[Dragonblight]] has asked you to slay 15 [[Jintha'kalar]] [[Scourge]].
*Jintha'kalar Scourge Slain (15)

==Description==
We wrested this ancient Drakkari temple from a swarm of invading Scourge. Not more than one-hundred paces from where we stand is the ruined city of Jintha'kalar. Scourge necromancers run amok, turning the living [[Drakkari tribe|Drakkari trolls]] that remain into servants of the [[Lich King]].

All are now lost to the [[Light]]. All must be purged.

<Valus looks upon you sternly.>

All.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Scourgeslayer's Shank|Claw of the Undead Ravager|Joint-Severing Quickblade|Wand of Purifying Fire|Wand of Blinding Light}}		

You will also receive:
*{{cost|5|60}}
* 20750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|9|96|}} compensation at level 80)
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Progress==
Leave nothing for the Lich King to resurrect!

==Completion==
As you can see, the [[Scourge]] war machine presses onward, yet the armies of the [[Horde]] and the [[Alliance]] remain divided, making for easy prey. It is for this reason that we must remain united.

<Valus is lost in contemplation for a moment.>

The [[Argent Crusade]] has use for a <man/woman> like you. Perhaps you would be interested in joining our cause? To battle and die at the side of the Ashbringer?

==Notes==
[[Battered Drakkari Berserker]]s and [[Tormented Drakkari]] count alongside [[Decrepit Necromancer]]s, [[Hulking Atrocity|Hulking Atrocities]], and [[Reanimated Drakkari Tribesman|Reanimated Drakkari Tribesmen]].

==Progression==
# [[The Call Of The Crusade]] (optional)
# [[The Cleansing Of Jintha'kalar]]
# [[Into the Breach!]] (classified as [[Zul'Drak]]) (exclusive with [[Reallocating Resources]] from [[Grizzly Hills]])
