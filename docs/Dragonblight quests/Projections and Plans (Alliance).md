==Objectives==
Get close to and observe the projection atop the [[Surge Needle]] floating above [[Moonrest Gardens]].

Afterward, return to the [[Image of Archmage Modera]] at [[Stars' Rest]] with the information.
* Object on the Surge Needle observed
* [[Surge Needle Teleporter]] (provided)

==Description==
This is a teleportation device. If I had to guess, I'd say that it leads to the surge needle platform floating above Moonrest Gardens to the west.

I need you to investigate what's up there. It appears that the device works both ways so you shouldn't have to jump off.

I expect that once you teleport to the top of the surge needle, there will be some sort of apparatus on it to observe.

You should be able to use the teleporter from anywhere within the gardens.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
Back so soon?

==Completion==
What you're describing... that's a projection of the [[Arcanomicon]]!

<The archmage's show of concern is quickly masked behind an impassive countenance.>

The Arcanomicon is a map of all of the magical [[ley line]] intersections in the world. The [[blue dragonflight]] has been using it to find and destroy ley line 'anchors' to send the magical power back to the [[Nexus]].

The question is, why is the path of destruction heading east when it should be heading west instead?

==Notes==
As soon as the minimap says "Moonrest Gardens", stop and teleport up. Wait 3 seconds for the quest to complete, then teleport back down.
