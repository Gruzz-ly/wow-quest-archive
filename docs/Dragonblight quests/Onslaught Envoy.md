==Objectives==
Find a new ally among old enemies in [[New Hearthglen]].

==Description==
A few defectors have been discovered among the [[Scarlet Onslaught]] in [[Northrend]].

I know it's difficult to think that any within their ranks could be useful to our cause, but we must make an attempt.

The prophecy says an old enemy will become an ally, so it's worth it to investigate and see if these defectors can be brought to the [[Light]]. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|or=250}}
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Why are you here? Why bother saving me? I was prepared to die. I should pay for the terrible things I've done...
