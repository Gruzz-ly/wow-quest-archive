==Objectives==
Seek out [[Emissary Brighthoof]] at the [[Westwind Refugee Camp]]. 

==Description==
The Scourge have seized control of the capital city of the taunka, Icemist Village! All living taunka that escaped the massacre are being held in protective custody at the Westwind Refugee Camp on the western border of Dragonblight.

Lord Hellscream believes that the taunka must join the Horde if they are to survive and has sent a tauren emissary to Westwind to bolster our relationship with the winter tauren. Travel to Westwind Refugee Camp and seek out Emissary Brighthoof. You will assist her.

==Rewards==
* 2050 [[XP]] (or a {{cost||49|50}} compensation at level 80)
* 10 reputation with [[The Taunka]]
* 10 reputation with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Completion==
What you see here is all that remains of the taunka from the Borean Tundra and the Dragonblight. They are a broken people... battered and brought to the brink of extinction.

<Brighthoof shakes her head.>

Only the Horde can save them now. Only the Horde can mend their broken spirits. We will nurse them back to full health and they will in turn strengthen the Horde in Northrend.
