==Objectives==
[[Lord Itharius]] at the top of [[Wyrmrest Temple]] has asked you to destroy a Weakened Reanimated Frost Wyrm, Weakened Turgid the Vile, and Weakened Overseer Deathgaze.
*[[Weakened Reanimated Frost Wyrm]]{{co|55|34|Dragonblight}} slain
*[[Weakened Turgid the Vile]]{{co|86|47|Dragonblight}} slain
*[[Weakened Overseer Deathgaze]]{{co|89|19|Dragonblight}} slain
*[[Seeds of Nature's Wrath]] (provided)

==Description==
Since we only have three seeds, we must put them to the best possible use.

Your targets are one of the [[Reanimated Frost Wyrm|reanimated frost wyrm]]s circling to the north near [[Galakrond's Rest]], [[Turgid the Vile]]{{coords|86.1|47.1|Dragonblight}} in the ruined [[barracks]] at the [[Carrion Fields]] to the east, and [[Overseer Deathgaze]]{{coords|89.5|19.1|Dragonblight}} at [[Jintha'kalar]] to the northeast.

While the seeds would outright destroy one of the lesser [[Scourge]], they will greatly weaken these three.  Enough so, in fact, that you should be able to handle them on your own.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Mantle of Itharius|Gloves of the Emerald Stalker|Verdant Hunter's Guise|Breastplate of Nature's Ire}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|16|80}}
*31150 [[XP]]
*+650 [[reputation]] with [[Wyrmrest Accord]]

==Progress==
What were the results? Are they destroyed?

I need answers!

==Completion==
Excellent.  Just as I suspected all along.  I shall have to contact [[Ysera]] and see if she approves.

If she can be coaxed from her [[Emerald Nightmare|nightmare]], of course.

Thank you, <name>.  You have been indispensable.

==Notes==
Frost wyrms are circling north of [[Wyrmrest Temple|Wyrmrest]].  Turgid's in the biggest building northwest of [[Naxxramas]], Deathgaze is in the northern camp at Jintha'kalar, just northwest of the stairs.
