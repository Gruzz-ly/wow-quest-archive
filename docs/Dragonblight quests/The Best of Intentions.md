==Objectives==
Wait for [[Serinar]] to administer the disguise of a [[Burning Depths Necrolyte]], then proceed to the back of the [[Maw of Neltharion]] to uncover what the [[Cult of the Damned]] is doing there. Return to Serinar with details regarding their purpose.

==Description==
The Cult of the Damned has not come just to extract power from dead dragons. I suspect I know what they are up to, but I need you to prove me correct.

I will grant you the guise of this dead necrolyte. Proceed to the back of the cave and confirm their intentions for being in this sacred place. I will watch through your eyes.

Be cautious, <name>, any damage done to you is likely to break the fragile illusion.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|60}}
*20750 [[XP]]
*+325 [[reputation]] with [[Wyrmrest Accord]]

==Progress==
I tire of this pestilence.

==Completion==
We are the [[Black dragonflight|Black Dragonflight]]. We have rained destruction on the lands of [[Azeroth]] for thousands of years. The decrepit Cult of the Damned worships death and we shall be glad to oblige.

==Notes==
Serinar will first cast Absorb Image on a nearby cultist's corpse. He will then cast the following buff on the player:
:{{Abilities|Burning Depths Necrolyte Image|Appears identical to a Burning Depths Necrolyte.  This spell will be removed by combat.|icon=spell_shadow_nethercloak}}
Players are also debuffed with:
:{{Abilities|Serinar's Vision|Serinar sees through your eyes...|icon=spell_holy_mindsooth}}

:{{text|say|Serinar|As long as you don't go hacking and slashing your way through, they'll never know the difference.}}
Proceed to the back of the cave:
:{{text|whisper|Serinar's Presence|Geist... disgusting. The Cult has infested this place.}}
:{{text|whisper|Serinar's Presence|It appears they are using those runes to deposit some of the power they've drained.}}
:{{text|whisper|Serinar's Presence|I had hoped my suspicions were incorrect... they're resurrecting [[magmawyrm]]s. Come back to me immediately, it is time to purge this place of the Cult.}}
:{{text|yell|[[Rothin the Decaying]]|You are a [[Black dragon|black wyrm]] no longer. Go... go and serve the [[Scourge]].}}

If you need a new costume:
:{{gossip|One of the cultists seems to have stumbled onto my blade and died... can I have a new disguise? I promise that I will be more careful this time.}}
