==Objectives==
Slay [[Tu'u'gwar]] and then return to [[Tua'kea]] at [[Moa'ki Harbor]].
* Tu'u'gwar slain
* [[Tu'u'gwar's Bait]] (provided)

==Description==
The time has come my friend: Tu'u'gwar must be dealt with!

I've prepped the meat so that the beast is sure to come once you bait the hook I have out in the water. Just follow the fishing line here down to it.

Whatever you do, don't let Tu'u'gwar swallow you hole, <name>!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Fisherman's Earwarmer|Moa'ki Thresherhide Tunic|Sharkdiver's Leggings|Crustacean Stompers}}
You will also receive: {{cost|10|60}}

==Progress==
I thought I might have spotted some thrashing... is Tu'u'gwar dead?

==Completion==
We shall rejoice at your success, my young friend! There's blood in the water and it is our enemy's!

You have the eternal gratitude of this old fisherman, <name>, and most certainly all of the [[Kalu'ak]] once I spread the word!

Here now, I insist, take something as a reward, please.
