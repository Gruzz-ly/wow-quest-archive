== Objectives ==
Return "The Path of Redemption" to [[High Commander Halford Wyrmbane]] at [[Wintergarde Keep]] in [[Dragonblight]].
* [[The Path of Redemption_(Updated version)]]

== Description ==
"The Path of Redemption," ever heard of it? It is allegedly a journal that holds the prophetic ramblings of [[Brigitte Abbendis|High General Abbendis]] of the [[Scarlet Onslaught]]. Within that book can be found the motivations and goals of the Scarlet zealots - not to mention a whole lot of insanity.

Venture to the [[Onslaught Base Camp]], northeast of Wintergarde Keep, and recover a copy of "The Path of Redemption" from one of the Onslaught soldiers.

== Progress ==
Did you find a copy?

== Completion ==
<Halford reads the journal.>

Abbendis has gone off the deep end. The Light speaks to her now?

Despite her ramblings, this journal gives us a never before seen look into the mind of the Scarlet zealots. This was a great find, <name>. [[Bolvar Fordragon|Lord Fordragon]] will be pleased.
