==Objectives==
Ask Timeweaver Delormi to return you to your time.
* Ask [[Timeweaver Delormi]] to return you to your time

==Description==
My [[Infinite dragonflight|Infinite]] self was right. I can no longer mend [[time]].

Too many of my threads have been purged. I can feel no others.

I'm alone now. And my thread is gone. But not you.

Take this recipe. You've proven yourself a talented [[Tailoring|tailor]] in your own time, and a savior in so many more.

The fabric of time needs your hands to mend it. I trust you with that responsibility.

Talk to me when you're ready. I'll take you back to when this all began.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: {{Abilities|Recipe: Synchronous Thread|id=292948|icon=inv_tailoring_815_synchronousthread}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Back in your time, you look down at the recipe you were given and ponder on the responsibility you've been given.

Surely this couldn't be any harder than the challenges you've faced up to this point...>

==Notes==
;Delormi
:It's been a journey, <name>. But your time is needed elsewhere.

:Are you ready to go?

:{{Gossip|I'm ready to leave.}}

::''Timeweaver Delormi begins channeling a spell.''
::{{Text|say|Timeweaver Delormi|It's been a pleasure, <name>. Perhaps we'll meet again in another time.}}

You can now craft [[Synchronous Thread]].
