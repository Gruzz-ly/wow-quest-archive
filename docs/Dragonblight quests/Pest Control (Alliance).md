==Objectives==
Kill 10 Snowplain Snobolds and 3 Dragonblight Magnataur at the [[magnataur]] camps surround [[Wyrmrest Temple|Wyrmrest]] down the road to the south. Return to [[Duane]] at [[7th Legion Front]] in the northern [[The Dragon Wastes|Dragon Wastes]] once the task is complete.
* Snowplain Snobolds: (10)
* Dragonblight Magnataur: (3)

==Description==
Ugh! One of those little [[snobold]] runts trashed our camp while we were busy with that last dragon. They've been plaguing us whenever we turn our backs... I've had enough!

To the south you'll find the snobolds hiding under the skirts of some of the local magnataur. Go slaughter them.

If the magnataur interfere on behalf of their slaves, kill them as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|30}}

==Progress==
Did you finish off those pests?

==Completion==
Good riddance.

==Progression==
{{Magnataur of Dragonblight}}
