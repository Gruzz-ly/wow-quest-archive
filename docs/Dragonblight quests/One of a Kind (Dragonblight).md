==Objectives==
Find and kill [[Bonesunder]] in or near the canyon northwest of [[Azure Dragonshrine]]. Bring any evidence you find back to [[Aurastrasza]] at [[Wyrmrest Temple]].
*[[Emblazoned Battle Horn (Bonesunder)]]

==Description==
Such a strange seal to see among [[magnataur]]... it suggests an unusual amount of organization.

Magnataur rarely put aside their  aggressive natures to cooperate with each other. I suspect they have their eyes set on raiding a large settlement.

I very much doubt that this horn is unique. I need you to prove me wrong. In the canyon northwest of the Azure Dragonshrine you will find Bonesunder. Go challenge him and bring me back any evidence you find that might confirm my concerns.

==Rewards==
You will also receive: {{cost|17|60}}

==Progress==
Did you find anything?

==Completion==
So it is true. They could not have chosen better timing for such an attack. Between the [[Scourge]] and the [[blue dragonflight|blue flight]], it is unlikely that anyone else has noticed yet.

==Progression==
{{Magnataur of Dragonblight}}
