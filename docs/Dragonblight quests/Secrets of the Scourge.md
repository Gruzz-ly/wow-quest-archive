==Objectives==
Deliver the Flesh-bound Tome to [[Cavalier Durkon]] at [[Wintergarde Keep]] in [[Dragonblight]].
* [[Flesh-bound Tome (Alliance quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
Scrawled across the flesh-bound chapters of this tome are strange symbols that seem to have been scraped into the pages with a blade. You have no idea what is written, but you are certain that whatever it is, it must be important.

Deliver the tome to Cavalier Durkon standing guard topside at [[Wintergarde Crypt]].

==Progress==
A Scourge tome?

==Completion==
Whatever information is held in this book must be of great importance! I could hear the howls and wails echoing through the crypt as you made your escape!

The [[High Commander Halford Wyrmbane|High Commander]] must be notified!

==Notes==
Upon picking up the book:
:{{text|say|Shadow of Thel'zan the Duskbringer|Where do you think you're going with that, mortal?  Put the tome down and I might spare you an eternity of anguish.}}

Thel'zan afflicts the player with the following buff:
:{{Abilities|Call of the Duskbringer|id=140453|You have been marked for death by Thel'zan the Duskbringer. Deliver the tome to Cavalier Durkon before you are killed!|icon=spell_shadow_coneofsilence}}

As soon as you pick up the quest, ''run''! The buff will cause [[Mindless Ghoul]]s to periodically spawn next to the player and attack, though they automatically die after a short time. The buff is automatically cleared as soon as the player gets outside the crypt. Upon reaching topside:
:{{text|say|<name>|Thel'zan's enchantment is broken! I am safe!}}
or
:{{text|say|<name>|The curse is lifted!}}

==Progression==
