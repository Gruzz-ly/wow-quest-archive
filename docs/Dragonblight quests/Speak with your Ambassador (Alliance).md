==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lauriel Trueblade]] at [[Wyrmrest Temple]]. 

==Description==
<The [[Tariolstrasz|dragon in elf form]] takes your letter of introduction, perusing it for a moment and then stashing it away within his sleeve.>

Everything seems to be in order. However, if you don't mind, I would ask that you speak with your ambassador here at the temple.

She has something of great import for you that needs taking care of before we send you up to the [[Alexstrasza|queen]].

<He pats at the letter under his sleeve.>

I'll keep this safe for you until your return. 

==Completion==
You must be <name>. I was told you'd be coming.

I have something that I think you're uniquely qualified to take care of and by doing it, you'll be ingratiating yourself with the dragons here.


== Notes ==
Dragons have their protocols.  Perhaps the news you carry simply isn't of immediate tactical importance?
