==Objectives==
[[Blood Guard Roh'kill]] at the [[Westwind Refugee Camp]] in the [[Dragonblight]] wants you to slay 15 Anub'ar Ambushers.
*[[Anub'ar Ambusher]] slain (15)

==Description==
I was one of the guards chosen to escort the caravan carrying the armament shipment to this camp. The attack came fast and without warning. We fought and killed dozens of the beasts, but in the end there were simply too many. [[Blood Guard Tor'zin|Tor'zin]] and I barely made it out alive...

If not for our injuries we would be out in the woods hunting down those fiends ourselves. Will you help us regain our lost pride? Search the woods east of here for Anub'ar Nerubians and kill them! For the Horde!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Spiderwarder Braces|Glade Wanderer Belt|Breastplate of Sizzling Chitin|Scarab of Isanoth|Legplates of the Agmar Preserver}}

*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
Show no mercy, <race>. Slay the Anub'ar!

==Completion==
<Roh'kill salutes you.>

You have preserved our honor, <name>. Tor'zin and I both thank you for this selfless act!
