==Objectives==
[[High Executor Wroth]] at [[Venomspite]] wants you to use the branding iron 5 times on [[Torturer Alphonse]] to get the information out of him. After that, kill him.

*Torturer Alphonse fully questioned
*Torturer Alphonse slain
*[[High Executor's Branding Iron]] (provided)

==Description==
Enough! I want you to put an end to the torture of my people!

The Onslaught's torturer, Alphonse, has been bleeding information out of everyone that gets caught by those fiends! I need to know what they know.

My sources tell me that he's setup shop in the basement of their [[barracks]], which is right next to the [[Blacksmith|smithy]].

I'll loan you my personal branding iron to see to it that the job is done right.

Find him and get that information.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Wastewind Garments|Snowfall Reaver Hood|Iceshear Pauldrons|Crystalplate Gauntlets}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|5||}}
*20300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|4|86|}} compensation at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
What news do you bring? Success, no doubt?

==Completion==
They knew all of that? And who the hell is this Grand Admiral Westwind that he spoke of?!

<The high executor grumbles to himself about hating surprises.>

Better that we know than have to guess. I hope that you left your... er, my mark.

==Notes==
While Alphonse is being tortured:
*{{text|whisper|Ow! I'll tell you NOTHING, filthy <race>!}}
*{{text|whisper|Wait... WAIT! What is it that you want to know?! I know you're the <class> named <name>.}}
*{{text|whisper|OW... NO! We know that you've been stealing our armor and weapons and horses!}}
*{{text|whisper|We know... that you don't... know why we're immune... to your so-called blight. Grand Admiral Westwind somehow gave the high abbot that prayer. I beg you... no more... please?!}}
*{{text|whisper|AHHHHHHHH! Please... we know... that you have a spy... disguised as... one of us! There... that's all I know. Please... mercy... STOP!}}

At this point, you have gained your information, but can continue the torture:
*{{text|whisper|I TOLD YOU... I don't know... anything... else!}}
*{{text|whisper|Just... end it.}}
*{{text|whisper|THIS IS TORTURE!}}
*{{text|whisper|They all... begged... for their... lives!}}
*{{text|whisper|Please... stop. I'll do... anything....}}
