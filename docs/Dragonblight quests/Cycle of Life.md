== Objectives ==
[[Nishera the Garden Keeper]] at the [[Emerald Dragonshrine]] has asked you to slay 5 Emerald Skytalons.
* [[Emerald Skytalon]] slain: (5)

== Description ==
[[Ysera]] sleeps in the [[Emerald Dream]], watching over both the Dream and [[Azeroth]]. But a horrible [[Emerald Nightmare|nightmare]] has taken hold in the Dream, and now I fear that Ysera is being affected by it.

Recently, I asked her to aid in the fight against the [[Scourge]] that are raising [[frost wyrm|frostwyrms]] at the other dragonshrines. She misunderstood.

Instead, she told our dragonshrine's defenders to treat those not of the [[green dragonflight]] as enemies.

I need you to slay some of the skytalons. The shrine must regain its balance.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|60}}
*20750 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Wyrmrest Accord]]

== Progress ==
The sooner that the emerald skytalons can be dealt with, the sooner the Emerald Dragonshrine can be returned to its natural balance.

== Completion ==
Do not regret the part that you played in the cycle of life. Birth, death, and rebirth are all part of the natural order.

==Notes==
*Shortly after a skytalon is killed, it will be reborn as a {{rep|friendly}} [[Reincarnated Skytalon]].
