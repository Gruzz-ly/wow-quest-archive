==Objectives==
Follow the ridge east and deliver the pack of explosives to [[Xink]] at [[Nozzlerust Post]] in northern [[Dragonblight]].
* [[Pack of Nozzlerust Explosives]] (provided)

==Description==
Upon closer examination, the [[goblin]] appears to have been running a pack full of explosives across [[The Dragon Wastes|the wastes]] for delivery. The [[harpy]] feathers half-buried in the snow suggest how he met his ill fate.

It appears that the goblin was bringing the explosives towards [[Angrathar the Wrathgate|the Wrathgate]] from somewhere to the east. It seems most prudent to follow the ridge back to the east and inform the sender of [[Nozzlerust Supply Runner|their runner's]] fate.

==Progress==
Hello there!

==Completion==
Hah! We lost another one, eh? Those harpies are becoming a real nuisance.

No matter! There's work to be done. Lend a hand around here, will ya?

==Notes==
The Supply Runner is at {{coords|48.4|24.2|Dragonblight}} just south of [[Coldwind Heights]] and [[Kor'kron Vanguard]] in the northern reaches of [[The Dragon Wastes]] in [[Dragonblight]].
