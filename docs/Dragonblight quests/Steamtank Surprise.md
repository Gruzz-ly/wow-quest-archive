==Objectives==
Use an [[Alliance Steam Tank]] to destroy 6 Plague Wagons and deliver the 7th Legion Elites to [[Wintergarde Mausoleum]]. Speak with [[Ambo Cash]] inside the Wintergarde Mausoleum in [[Dragonblight]] should you succeed.
* [[Plague Wagon]] Sabotaged (6)
* [[7th Legion Elite]] Safely Dropped Off

==Description==
This is a seek and destroy mission. You'll be driving a tank into the [[Carrion Fields]] to dismantle [[Scourge]] plague wagons. With the tank comes a crew of three 7th Legion soldiers. All must survive if this mission is to succeed!

You'll need to get in close to a plague wagon to unleash your engineer. Let them do their deed and move on to the next one. When the field is clear of plague wagons, head to the mausoleum in front of the ruined keep and drop off the rest of your crew. Meet with Ambo Cash inside.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Ritual Neckguard|Saboteur's Wrap|Siegemaster's Torch Ring}}

==Progress==
Name's Cash.  Ambo Cash.  And the pleasure is all yours.

==Completion==
Why I'm not wearing any pants isn't important. Let's just say I took some Scourge shrapnel in the wrong place and leave it at that, ok?

So, you wiped out those plague wagons up in the fields and got my soldiers here in one piece. Impressive. You're one of the first to make it this far, friend. Too bad you gotta go right back out into the Carrion Fields. Yep, we've had a bit of a setback.

==Notes==
[[File:Scourge Discombobulater.jpg|thumb|A [[7th Legion Siege Engineer]] placing a [[Scourge Discombobulater]] at a [[Plague Wagon]].]]
Interact with one of the nearby [[Alliance Steam Tank]]s to hop inside. The tank carries two [[7th Legion Elite]]s on its roof and a [[7th Legion Siege Engineer]] inside, and has the following abilities:
#{{Abilities|Ice Cannon|id=49315|A low cost attack that does a moderate amount of damage and slows down the movement of Scourge enemies. Does DOUBLE damage against Scourge that are imprisoned in ice.|icon=spell_frost_chillingblast|range=40 yd}}
#{{Abilities|Ice Prison|id=49333|The tank unloads a torrent of freezing air, imprisoning all Scourge in the Carrion Fields that are within the blast radius.|icon=spell_frost_chainsofice|cd=10 sec}}
#{{Abilities|Drop Off Gnome|id=49109|Gives the command to your 7th Legion Siege Engineer to dismount and sabotage a Scourge Plague Wagon.|icon=inv_misc_head_gnome_02|range=10 yd|cd=10 sec}}
#{{Abilities|Drop Off Soldier|id=49081|Drops off a 7th Legion Elite at the Wintergarde Mausoleum.|icon=spell_holy_prayerofhealing|range=20 yd|cd=10 sec}}

When close to a [[Plague Wagon]], use Drop Off Gnome to release the Siege Engineer.
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Siege Engineer|Cover me!}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Siege Engineer|Keep 'em off me for about 15 seconds and this thing is as good as dead.}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Siege Engineer|Keep the bad guys off me!}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Siege Engineer|When I'm done with this plague wagon it'll look like a [[goblin]] built it! Keep me safe!}}

The engineer runs up to the wagon and creates a [[Scourge Discombobulater]] to destroy it, before jumping back inside the tank:
:{{Text|emote|The 7th Legion Siege Engineer deftly assembles a strange machine.}}
:{{Text|say|7th Legion Siege Engineer|That oughta do it! Just a few more seconds now.}}

Idle dialogue while roaming:
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Elite|Driver, I hear you single handedly [[Flight of the Wintergarde Defender|airlifted our villagers]] out of this hell-hole. Is that true?}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Elite|I hope I'm alive to see [[Arthas Menethil|Arthas]] get what's coming to him.}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Elite|I've never seen destruction like this...}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Elite|Keep the chatter down, people. We need to stay alert!}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Elite|Look at this mess... The Scourge will pay for this!}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Elite|So does anyone know anything about [[Thel'zan the Duskbringer|Thel'zan]]? Who is he? How did he come to leading the Scourge armies on the ground?}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Elite|The smell of death covers every inch of this place.}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Elite|Where are all the corpses? What have they done to our people?}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Siege Engineer|Did I ever tell you soldiers about the time I destroyed the [[Thandol Span]]? Yep, weren't no [[Dark Iron dwarf|dark irons]] destroyed that bridge! Was me!}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Siege Engineer|Hey, do any of you know [[McGoyver]] over at [[Valgarde]]? He's my uncle. You know what his title is? Pro. Yea, just "Pro." I want to be a pro too.}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Siege Engineer|I think I see one of their plague wagons!}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Siege Engineer|I used to know a [[dwarf]] that claimed gnomes evolved from beneath the earth. That we all started out as [[sand gnome]]s. What a load of nonsense! Sand gnomes? PUH-LEASE!}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Siege Engineer|I wonder if we'll ever solve [[The Bleeding Ore|the mystery]] of the [[Saronite|strange ore]]. There's gotta be some use for it!}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Siege Engineer|It doesn't make any sense. Why don't they just fly Naxxramas over Wintergarde Keep and blow it up? I mean, that's what I would do if I were [[Kel'Thuzad]].}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Siege Engineer|Something straight up stinks in here! It's definitely not me. Gnomes smell like butter and sunshine. Not like those dwarves that smell like they were born from a [[trogg]]'s armpit! None of you are dwarves, are you?}}

For the second objective, drive to the [[Wintergarde Mausoleum]] entrance{{Co|85.8|50|Dragonblight}} that looks like a crypt in the center of the Carrion Fields below Naxxramas (''not'' the entrance that looks like a hole in the ground just next to Wintergarde Keep) and use Drop Off Soldier to release the Elites, who run inside to Ambo Cash and despawn:
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Elite|For the Alliance and [[Bolvar Fordragon|Lord Fordragon]]!}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Elite|Great driving, soldier! Not a scratch on us!}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Elite|HOO-WAH! The cavalry has arrived!}}
*{{Text|say|7th Legion Elite|Without you we'd be lost. Thanks for the ride!}}

When done with both objectives, head into the Mausoleum as well and turn in to Ambo.
