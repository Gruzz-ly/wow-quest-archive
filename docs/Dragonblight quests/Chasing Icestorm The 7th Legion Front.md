==Objectives==
Report to [[Legion Commander Tyralion]] at the [[7th Legion Front]] in central [[Dragonblight]].{{co|64.7|27.9|Dragonblight}}

==Description==
You need to get to the 7th Legion Front in northern Dragonblight. Return to [[Wintergarde Keep]] and take the north gate out of town. Keep north until you hit a road. Take a left on that road and follow it until you reach the snowline. Once at the snowline keep heading west until you hit the [[Path of the Titans]]. Follow that north and it'll lead you right into the 7th Legion Front.

Once there, speak with Legion Commander Tyralion. He'll be expecting you.

And <name> - it has been a pleasure. Farewell.

==Completion==
Now you know why they call this [[the Dragon Wastes]]. Bones of the beasts are strewn about as far as the eye can see.

We've probably taken down a dozen or more [[frost wyrm|frostwyrms]] and there's still no end in sight. The [[Scourge]]'s got fuel for ten-thousand more with all the bones laying about.

<Tyralion clears his throat.>

I don't mean to bore you with the details, hero. We've got the wyrm you're looking for locked in our sights.
