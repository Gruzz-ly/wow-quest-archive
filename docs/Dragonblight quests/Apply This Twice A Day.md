==Objectives==
Offer the elixir that [[Zort]] has prepared to [[Ko'char the Unbreakable]].
*[[Zort's Protective Elixir (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
This elixir should protect against their spit. Offer it to Ko'char for me, will you? Tell him there's plenty more where that came from if he'll return the favor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|5}}
*[[Zort's Protective Elixir]]

==Progress==
The [[goblin|runt]] wants us to fight for him I assume. This is my surprise face.

==Completion==
I will be blunt little one - I do not trust this mixture and I will not use it. Keep it... if you find more trust in the green runt than I do, perhaps it will be of use to you.

==Notes==
"This is my surprise face"? A [[frost giant]] said that!?

On completion:
:{{text|say|Ko'char the Unbreakable says: Greenskin... I know why you've come. You will not find allies in my kind for we do not trust you.
:Ko'char the Unbreakable says: I will suffer your presence no longer. Begone. Find someone else to extort.
:Zort says: Bah! You're as dumb as a rock! I hope the worms eat all of you.}}
:{{text|emote|Ko'char the Unbreakable waves dismissively.}}
