==Objectives==
[[Koltira Deathweaver]] at [[Agmar's Hammer]] in the [[Dragonblight]] wants you to enter the world of shadows and defeat 6 [[Shadowy Tormentor]]s.

Speak to Koltira Deathweaver should you need to re-enter the world of shadows.
* [[Shadowy Tormentor]] slain (6)

==Description==
While you have done much for me, one task remains.

Beside the world you know exists another world. It is from that world, the world of shadows, that my tormentors assault me. While I am powerless to face my own demons, you could end their reign of terror. You have the strength, I have seen it with my own eyes.

Enter the world of shadows and face the demons that torment me!

Do this and I will translate the tome, as promised. 

==Completion==
The power I hold comes at a great cost, <name>. Many knights, light and dark alike, lost their lives in the final battle at [[Light's Hope Chapel|Light's Hope]]. The prospect of the future looks grim, but at least now I know what I face. The Lich King will never release his grasp and for that alone he must die!

==Notes==
During the quest, the Lich King descends into the middle of the town on the back of a frostwyrm.  He recites several threats to the player (including the accompanying audio speech) before flying away.

:{{text|say|The Lich King|Ah, the Horde... meddling, as always. I suppose a welcome is in order. So welcome, insects. Welcome to my world.}}
:{{text|say|The Lich King|You have crossed into the world of the dead in search of answers. You wish to save your ally and have risked life and limb to be here. Allow me to help.}}
:{{text|say|The Lich King|The boy believed that he was free, but free will has a price. The demons I kept at bay are now loose upon him and all death knights that attempt to flee...}}
:{{text|say|The Lich King|Mograine's sacrifice was for nothing. You will let Koltira know, won't you?}}
:{{text|say|The Lich King|And remember this, mortal: for now I give you the choice. I allow you to pick your allegiance, but in the end, you will be mine - one way or another.}}
