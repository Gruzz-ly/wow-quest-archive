==Objectives==
Report to [[Crusader Valus]] at [[Light's Trust]] in [[Dragonblight]].

==Description==
<Class>! The [[Argent Crusade]] is looking for able bodied soldiers that are willing to set aside their differences and join forces to battle the forces of the [[Lich King]]. Will you take up our cause?

Should you be interested, venture north to Light's Trust and speak with Crusader Valus.

You will find Light's Trust amidst the ruins of the sacked troll city of [[Jintha'kalar]] - bordering [[Zul'Drak]].

Farewell.

==Rewards==
* 5,200 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|49|}} compensation at level 80)
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Crusade]]

==Completion==
Mere footsteps from here lies the [[Drakkari]] empire.

<Valus points east.>

For thousands of years the Drakkari remained isolated, preferring to keep within the boundaries of their sprawling temple cities and ziggurats. It was surprising then, to come upon this wreckage. Further up, beyond the foreboding stairs leading into Zul'Drak, [[Drak'Tharon Keep]] lies in ruin. The entire first tier of Zul'Drak, destroyed...

Why has the [[Scourge]] waited until now to attack?

==Progression==
# [[The Call Of The Crusade]] (optional)
# [[The Cleansing Of Jintha'kalar]]
# [[Into the Breach!]] (classified as [[Zul'Drak]]) (exclusive with [[Reallocating Resources]] from [[Grizzly Hills]])
