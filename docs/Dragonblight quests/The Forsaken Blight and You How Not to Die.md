==Objectives==
[[Chief Plaguebringer Middleton]] at [[Venomspite]] in [[Dragonblight]] wants you to bring him 10 Ectoplasmic Residue.
*[[Ectoplasmic Residue]] (10)

==Description==
The details behind the functionality of the blight are hardly important. All you need to know is that it does the job it was designed to do. I have managed to synthesize a strain of the blight that is inert.

<Middleton uncorks a vial and inhales.>

See, my body is still, mostly, intact. Now mix this with a reactive agent and we'd all be turned to shapeless piles of goo.

On the beach south of here you will find pathetic specters of Alliance soldiers past. Slay them and bring me ectoplasmic residue.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Wastewind Handwraps|Spiritfury Bands|Belt of Ghostly Essence|Wraithshimmer Legplates}}

You will also receive:
* 20300 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with The [[Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
The residue will be used as the reactive agent to activate the blight!

==Completion==
This will do nicely, <name>. Did those pathetic whelps put up a fight or did they just shower you with ghostly tears of sorrow?

Ah, they get so emotional...
