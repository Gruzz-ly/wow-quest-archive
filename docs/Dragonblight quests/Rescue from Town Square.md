==Objectives==
[[High Commander Halford Wyrmbane]] at [[Wintergarde Keep]] in [[Dragonblight]] wants you to rescue 6 Trapped Wintergarde Villagers.
* [[Trapped Wintergarde Villager]] saved (6)

==Description==
Just down this path here is Wintergarde's town square. Once a hive of activity for the citizens of Wintergarde, now a warzone, filled with murderous [[geist]]s hell-bent on vengeance towards the living.

In the buildings surrounding the town square are trapped villagers that must be rescued! I ask much of you, now, <name>, but you are the only soldier I can spare. Free our people. Take this path down into town square and enter those houses. Kill anything that gets in your way! Return to me should you survive.

==Progress==
Have you rescued our trapped villagers?

==Completion==
<Halford says a prayer for the deceased.>

You do the [[Light]]'s work, <name>.

I fear that our work has only just begun.

<Halford holds up a document.>

==Notes==
Rescue the villagers by killing the [[Vengeful Geist]]s that have them cornered around the square. Pick up [[The Fate of the Dead]] before heading out, as the geists give credit for both quests. Upon being saved, the villagers say one of the following:
*{{Text|say|Trapped Wintergarde Villager|Finally! A hero has come!}}
*{{Text|say|Trapped Wintergarde Villager|Good of you to come, champion! The beast almost had me!}}
*{{Text|say|Trapped Wintergarde Villager|I'll never forget you, friend.}}
*{{Text|say|Trapped Wintergarde Villager|Thank you, kind soul.}}
