==Objectives==
[[Koltira Deathweaver]] at [[Agmar's Hammer]] in the [[Dragonblight]] wants you to use the Unholy Gem on [[Duke Vallenhal]] and return to him with a Filled Unholy Gem.
*[[Unholy Gem]] (provided)

==Description==
The power of the unholy is coveted among my kind. It makes up the very fiber of our existence, granting death to those that dare make a mockery of it! Thankfully there is a fount from where I may draw from in my time of need.

Take this unholy gem and make your way to the Ruby Dragonshrine, east of here. It is there that you will find [[Duke Vallenhal]], [[death knight]] of [[Arthas]]. Weaken his resolve in battle and unleash the power of the gem upon him. It will finish him off and steal his unholy energy!

==Progress==
Fill the gem with the power of the unholy!

==Completion==
<Koltira's eyes widen.>

Impressive. You bested a [[death knight]] of [[Arthas]]... Clearly you were not alone... but still...

==Progression==
