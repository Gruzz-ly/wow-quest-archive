== Objectives ==
Retrieve a [[Wintergarde Mine Bomb]] and use it to blow up the Upper Wintergarde Mine Shaft and the Lower Wintergarde Mine Shaft. Report back to [[Siege Engineer Quarterflash]] at [[Wintergarde Keep]] in [[Dragonblight]] when you have completed this task.
*Upper Wintergarde Mine Shaft destroyed
*Lower Wintergarde Mine Shaft destroyed

== Description ==
If there is good in your heart and your conscience is clear, read on.

In this mine, near the foreman's scaffold rests a heavy cargo of dynamite. Go there and pick up several bundles of the explosive and make your way towards the entrance of the mine. Once there, set the dynamite and blow up the entrance. Remember to do this for both the upper and lower entry points of [[Wintergarde Mine]].

You must leave nothing to chance. The evil that exists here must never be allowed out. [[Light]] guide you.

== Progress ==
<Quarterflash nods.>

He was a good gnome, one of our best.  [[Slinkin the Demo-gnome|Slinkin]] will be missed.

== Completion ==
His death will not have been in vain, friend. The information that Slinkin died for will be instrumental in defeating the [[Lich King]]. I promise you that we will make this right.
