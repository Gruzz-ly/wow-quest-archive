==Objectives==
Uncover the [[void]] presence at [[Galakrond's Rest]] in [[Dragonblight]].
* Inspect the void presence
* Clear the shadows (4)
*Meet Alleria at the gates of Ulduar in the Storm Peaks.

==Description==
I don't often work with the [[Riftwalkers]]. I prefer to handle missions alone. Still, I will not abandon one of them.

I cannot yet sense [[Riftwalker Nilara|the Riftwalker]]'s presence. Our best path forward is to retrace her steps.

Which means following the shadows.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
We now know why the Riftwalker didn't report back. She's turned against us and serves only the Void now.

Though I wouldn't be surprised if the Harbinger had a hand in this.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|This is where [[Iridikron]] empowered the [[Dark Heart]]. But that was millennia ago.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Why would there be void activity here? Why now?}}

Follow Alleria downhill and use the extra action button when close to her:
:{{abilities|Voidflare|Request Alleria fire a flair into the shadows, revealing the Riftwalker's tracks.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|[[Riftwalker Tracks|Tracks]]. They might belong to our Riftwalker. Let's follow them.}}

Head into the excavation and use the extra action button at any marked spot. A pair of [[Cosmic Ooze]]s spawn at the next first three: 
#{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Galakrond was consumed by a never-ending hunger. And that same hunger was used to empower the Dark Heart.}}
#{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|The Riftwalkers reported fluctuations in void energy, followed by a period of calm.}}
#{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Could the Dark Heart be absorbing magical power? And converting it to shadow.}}
#{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|These tracks lead north. Wait... I sense something. Is it Ulduar?}}
:''Alleria mounts a gryphon and begins flying northward.''
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I'll scout ahead. Meet me there.}}

Near the [[Ulduar (instance)|Ulduar]] instance line, [[Shadowguard Ethereal (Storm Peaks)|Shadowguard Ethereals]], [[Grasping Void]] tendrils, and [[Riftwalker Nilara]] have taken over the space. A pair of [[Darklost Brute]]s and numerous [[Cosmic Ooze]]s are also found in the courtyard. A few ethereals and some oozes are trying to breach a barrier into Ulduar itself. Approach Alleria:
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Well. We're on the right track.}}
