==Objectives==
Locate [[Zort]] in the center of [[the Crystal Vice]], northeast of [[Nozzlerust Post]].

==Description==
Well it seems you were a bit of use after all. It's not been my experience to meet many a <race> that are.

We don't have any more use for you here. Head into the Vice and see if my brother Zort could use a hand. He went to see if he could con the [[Crystalline Ice Giant|giants]] into laying down their lives so that we don't have to. He certainly wasn't known for having the brains in the family.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|13|73}}

==Completion==
I can think of some uses for you, go ahead and stay for a bit.

==Notes==
This quest requires completion of all previous quests at [[Nozzlerust Post]], starting from [[Shaved Ice]].
