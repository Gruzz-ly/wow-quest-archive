==Objectives==
[[Chief Plaguebringer Middleton]] at [[Venomspite]] in [[Dragonblight]] wants you to collect 8 Emerald Dragon Tears.
*[[Emerald Dragon Tear]] (8)

==Description==
With an inert specimen of the blight compound complete and the activating agent in hand there only remains a need for a suitable shell to house the components.

Southwest of here, on the shores of central Dragonblight, is where you will find the Emerald Dragonshrine. Within the shrine you will find the hardened remnants of a green dragon's tear drop. I don't know the whole story, but apparently they cry a lot right before they die. Go figure.

Go to the Emerald Dragonshrine and gather tears. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*20300 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with The [[Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
Fortunate it is that we have a location nearby holding a surplus of emerald dragon tears. I would have had to send you to Feralas otherwise.

==Completion==
I do believe that the blight is now ready for a field test. Fortuitously, the dread citadel, Naxxramas, is laying siege to Wintergarde Keep. From beneath the very earth that Wintergarde was built upon rise the living dead, eager to do the bidding of Kel'Thuzad.

The Alliance are, of course, outmanned and outgunned. The people laid to rest in the Wintergarde Mausoleum awaken, hungering for flesh!

Perhaps we shall give them a taste of the blight, yes?
