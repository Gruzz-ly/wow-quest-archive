==Objectives==
Locate [[Dregmar Runebrand]] near his cave on the path to the cliffs overlooking [[the Mirror of Dawn]]. Challenge him and uncover the name of the [[magnataur]] leader by any means necessary. Return to [[Aurastrasza]] at [[Wyrmrest Temple|Wyrmrest]] once the information is obtained.
* Name of the Magnataur Warlord
Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
Dregmar Runebrand is a magnataur runemaster... a rare breed. He's generally solitary, but has been known to associate with the more powerful and influential magnataur in [[Dragonblight]] for quite some time. He will know who this new leader is.

It is unlikely we will gain any aid with the increasing concerns with the [[Scourge]] and the [[blue dragonflight|blue flight]], so I need you to procure the information from Dregmar by any means necessary.

I was told he can be found amongst the cliffs overlooking [[the Mirror of Dawn]].

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|11|20}}

==Progress==
Did you get the name? Do you know who the magnataur warlord is?

==Completion==
[[Grom'thar the Thunderbringer]]. Good. Let's end any threat these magnataur might pose here and now.

==Notes==
On aggro:
:{{text|yell|Dregmar Runebrand|I know why you've come - one of those foolish Magnataur on the plains meddled and managed to get the dragons involved. Do you enjoy serving them like dogs?}}
:{{text|yell|Dregmar Runebrand|You seek their leader... little things, you wage war against the clans of [[Grom'thar the Thunderbringer]] himself. Don't be so eager to rush to your deaths.}}

At 20%:
:{{text|yell|Dregmar Runebrand|Hah! So be it. Blow the horn of a magnataur leader at the ring of torches south of the Blue Dragonshrine. Make peace with your gods... Grom'thar will come.}}
:''Dregmar despawns.''

==Progression==
{{Magnataur of Dragonblight}}
