== Objectives ==
[[Warden Jodi Moonsong]] at [[Stars' Rest]] has asked you to use the [[Liquid Fire of Elune]] to cleanse the corpses of 6 Blighted Elk and 6 Rabid Grizzlies.
* [[Blighted Elk]]'s corpse cleansed: (6)
* [[Rabid Grizzly]]'s corpse cleansed: (6)

== Description ==
<Race> will you assist me?

The [[Scourge]] have moved into [[Icemist Village|Icemist]] to the north. Wherever they go, they spread their taint, and the creatures of the land suffer.

Take this vial, which is filled with the liquid fire of [[Elune]] from the [[moonwell]]. Please, use the liquid to cleanse the corpses of the blighted wildlife you find.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

== Progress ==
It is a shame that we cannot heal the bears and elk that have fallen victim to the Scourge presence.

At least we can prevent the taint from spreading further.

== Completion ==
We have done what we can for the creatures of the land. Now we must take direct action against those that have caused this!
