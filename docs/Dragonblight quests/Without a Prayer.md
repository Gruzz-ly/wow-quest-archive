==Objectives==
[[Agent Skully]] at [[New Hearthglen]] has asked you to acquire [[Bishop Street]]'s Prayer Book.
*[[Bishop Street's Prayer Book]]

==Description==
These plans indicate something imminent is being planned.

But first, there's the matter of this strange protection that the Onslaught forces have. If [[Venomspite]] is to deal with them once and for all, we must find out who's behind it and eliminate them.

I've noticed that the bishop in the chapel on the far side of New Hearthglen, across from the lumbermill, has stepped up his blessing of the troops. Kill him and steal his prayer book.

Maybe it will give us a clue. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

+250 [[Hand of Vengeance]] Reputation

==Progress==
You have the bishop's prayer book? Did you find anything unusual in it?

==Completion==
A newly scribed blessing at the back of the book you say?

<The agent glances over your shoulder as you flip to the page at the end.>

Damn it all! That's the high abbot's handwriting! I'd stake your life on it.
