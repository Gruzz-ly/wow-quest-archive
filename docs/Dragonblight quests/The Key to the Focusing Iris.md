== Objectives ==
Deliver the [[Key to the Focusing Iris (starter)|Key to the Focusing Iris]] to [[Alexstrasza|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder]] atop [[Wyrmrest Temple]] in the [[Dragonblight]].
* [[Key to the Focusing Iris (starter)]] (Provided)

== Description ==
A potent thrumming of magical nature can be heard and felt emanating from the eye-shaped jewel dropped from [[Sapphiron (tactics)|Sapphiron]]'s clutches. To mortal ears it is nearly painful to be in the presence of the stone.

Surely such a powerful item of import can only be taken to the queen of the dragons, Alexstrasza the Life-Binder. Seek her counsel atop Wyrmrest Temple in the Dragonblight.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|22|20}}
|Key to the Focusing Iris (reward)}}

== Progress ==
<Name>, you have come into contact with a key to the focusing iris! Do you have it upon your person?

<The queen glances at her consort, [[Krasus]], with eyes full of concern.>

How did you ever come into its possession? Oh, Sapphiron still had his?

== Completion ==
These keys are held by the most ancient members of the [[blue dragonflight]]. Only they are entrusted with them by their master, [[Malygos]].

This is the break that we've been waiting for to strike at the Aspect of Magic!

<The queen of dragons studies you for a brief moment.>

You are not be able to use the key as-is to access the Focusing Iris, but I can imbue you with a portion of my power; enough to enable you to use it to open the iris a fraction.

It will be enough to draw Malygos's ire!

== Notes ==
The Key to the Focusing Iris drops from [[Sapphiron (tactics)|Sapphiron]] in [[Naxxramas]] on [[normal mode]].

After completion:
:{{text|whisper|Krasus|<Name>, we must speak when the queen is done with you.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|It is done. You may now open the focusing iris.}}

====Warning====
It is commonly thought that people lose the key after the quest is completed, this is not true. Since the [[Key to the Focusing Iris (reward)]] is a key, it is found in your Key chain.
