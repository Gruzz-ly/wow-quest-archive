This quest can be picked up from two separate NPCs...
# After completing [[All Hail the Conqueror of Skorn!]], when it is given by Captain Adams.
# By simply going to Stars' Rest and picking it up from Courier Lanson directly.

The quest [[The Lost Courier]] is optional; it leads you to talk to Courier Lanson.

== Objectives ==
Show the Alliance Missive to [[Greer Orehammer]]/[[Palena Silvercloud]] at [[Westguard Keep]]/[[Stars' Rest]].
* [[Alliance Missive]] (provided)

== Description ==
The list I hold must be delivered to [[High Commander Halford Wyrmbane]]. He commands the 7th Legion, stationed at [[Wintergarde Keep]] on the eastern borders of the [[Dragonblight|Great Dragonblight]].

If any of the traitors on this list are stationed at Wintergarde... it could be catastrophic.

Hurry, <name>. Show the document to Greer Orehammer/Palena Silvercloud here at Westguard Keep/Stars' Rest and explain the nature of your mission. <He'll/She will> put you on his fastest gryphon to Wintergarde!

== Progress ==
Greer Orehammer: Hello, <class>.

Palena Silvercloud: Hello, <race>.

== Completion ==
<Greer lifts his glasses onto the top of his head and reads the note, looking back up at you curiously when he's done.>/<Palena reads the note.>

You will have my fastest gryphon/hippogryph! This information must be delivered to High Commander Wyrmbane at once!

== Notes ==
Thus starts the lead-in to Wintergarde Keep from Westguard and/or Stars' Rest and a pretty creepy quest chain as a result of some downright ''evil'' actions from the Lich King.

Note that if you have completed Flight of the Windergarde Defender (Which is later along the same quest line) in Wintergarde Keep, you will not be able to take this quest, but you can still continue from that point on the quest line.
