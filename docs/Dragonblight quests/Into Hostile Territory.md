Players must complete the quest chains starting with [[Rescue from Town Square]] and [[The Demo-gnome]] before Wyrmbane will offer this quest. See the "Previous" links in the infobox to the right for the conclusion of those quest chains.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Gryphon Commander Urik]] to secure a ride to [[Thorson's Post]]. Report to [[Duke August Foehammer]] when you arrive at Thorson's Post in [[Dragonblight]].

==Description==
You have done much to advance our efforts against the [[Scourge]], <name>. In fact, the morale of all those who come into contact with you soars! Such is your influence over the soldiers and citizenry of [[Wintergarde]], ally.

And because of you we are now prepared to go on the offensive. You are to report to Duke August Foehammer, across the [[Carrion Fields]] at Thorson's Post, east of here. Gryphon Commander Urik at the [[gryphon]] station has prepared a special gryphon to drop you behind enemy lines. Go now!

==Completion==
Ah, the distinguished hero arrives. Welcome to ground zero, <name>. Allow me to bring you up to speed!

[[Thel'zan the Duskbringer|Thel'zan]]'s most powerful forces have made their way into the [[Wintergarde Mausoleum]]. They plumb its depths in search of corpses and souls to send against Wintergarde while [[Naxxramas]] rains down terrible plague machines, set to hold us at bay!

We must strike now and hope that [[Bolvar Fordragon|Lord Fordragon]] is able to hold out at the [[Angrathar the Wrathgate|Wrathgate]] for just a little longer.

{{Dialogue|title=Gryphon Commander Urik|The gryphon riders are standing 10 paces from us, friend. They'll be giving you a ride to Thorson's Post. Get going!}}

Interact with one of the nearby [[Wintergarde Gryphon]]s to hop on behind its [[Wintergarde Gryphon Rider]] and get flown to Thorson's Post:
*{{Text|say|Wintergarde Gryphon Rider|Hang on to your hat, pal! We're in for a bumpy ride{{Sic}}}}
*{{Text|say|Wintergarde Gryphon Rider|Keep your head low and be on the lookout for [[frostwyrm]]s! YAAAW!}}
*{{Text|say|Wintergarde Gryphon Rider|Thorson's Post - coming right up!}}

Once above the post, the player is ejected with a parachute to land near [[Duke August Foehammer]].
:{{Text|say|Wintergarde Gryphon Rider|This is your stop, pal. Safe landing!}}
