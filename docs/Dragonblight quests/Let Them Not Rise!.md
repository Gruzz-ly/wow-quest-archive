==Objectives==
[[Apothecary Vicky Levine]] at [[Venomspite]] has asked you to use her Container of Rats to pick clean the corpses of 15 [[Scarlet Onslaught]] members at [[New Hearthglen]].
*Scarlet Onslaught corpses picked clean (15)
*[[Container of Rats]] (provided)

==Description==
I don't understand it. The blight should have worked!

No sense worrying about it now.

<The apothecary seems relieved for some reason.>

Though it doesn't work on the Onslaught for some strange reason, we still need to keep their priests from raising them.

I have another idea, one that their corpses shouldn't have any protection from.

<name>, take a container of my rats and unleash them upon any Onslaught corpses you come across at New Hearthglen. I starve the vermin, so they should be voracious! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Sash of the Nibbling Plague|Vermin-Handler's Gauntlets|Rodent-Proof Headguard|Bite-Proof Grips}}

You will also receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
Well? Success I assume?

Don't tell me that they have some kind of protection against being eaten by rats?!

==Completion==
Oh good! For a moment I thought I was going to have to test the rats out on someone to make sure that they weren't defective.

Progress, finally!
