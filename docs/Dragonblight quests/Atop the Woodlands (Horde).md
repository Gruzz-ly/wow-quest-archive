==Objectives==
Obtain the [[Ley Line Focus Control Amulet]] and use it to gain information from the Ley Line Focus in the [[Lothalor Woodlands]].

Then, return to the [[Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver]] at [[Agmar's Hammer]].
* Ley line focus information retrieved

==Description==
I'm convinced that there must be more of those foci, each of them in-turn redirecting the ley line energies. We still don't know precisely what they're doing with all of that power, though.

My guess is that you'll find another one atop the Lothalor Woodlands to the south. Once again you'll need to find [[Lieutenant Ta'zinni|the person in charge]] and take whatever controlling device they have in their possession as I'm sure that each focus has its own.

Be quick about your business, <class>. I feel that time may be running out. 

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Kirin Tor Initiate's Sandals
|Violet Stalker Shoulderpads
|Azurehunter Handguards
|Dalaran Sentry Wristbraces}}
You will also receive: {{cost|5}}

==Completion==
They're empowering their forces with it? That doesn't make any sense at all; the mage hunters aren't that powerful!

This must mean that they're only using the magic at the terminus of wherever they've redirected the ley line to.

We're going to need more information if I'm to devise a plan to stop them!
