== Objectives ==
Collect 5 Functional Cultist Suits for [[Warden Jodi Moonsong]] at [[Stars' Rest]].
* [[Functional Cultist Suit]] (5)

== Description ==
The Anub'ar [[Cult of the Damned|cultists]] are indirectly responsible for plaguing the beasts, and we must put an end to it!

The fumes that emit from the cultists' suits seep into everything they come near, poisoning and corrupting their surroundings.

You must go north to [[Icemist Village]] and slay them. Bring back any of their suits that survive your assault and I will see to it that they are properly disposed of.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

== Progress ==
The cultists are a blight upon creation!

== Completion ==
Well done.

I will dispose of these filthy garments by cleansing them in the [[moonwell]] and destroying them through the power of the [[Elune|goddess]]!

== Notes ==
The cultists stand a chance of dropping [[The Favor of Zangus]], which starts the next quest.

==Progression==
{{:The Liquid Fire of Elune}}
