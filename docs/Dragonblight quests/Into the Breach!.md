==Objectives==
[[Crusader Valus]] at [[Light's Trust]] wants you to report to [[Sergeant Riannah]] at [[Light's Breach]] in [[Zul'Drak]]. 

==Description==
Ready yourself, <class>. I'm dispatching you to Light's Breach, northeast of here.

I've received word that the [[Scourge]] are making a push to take over Zul'Drak.

<Valus stares you dead in the eyes.>

This will not come to pass.

See to it that you assist in the destruction of the Scourge there. The [[light]] demands it.

Dismissed.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||60}}

==Completion==
Excellent. Valus must have received my report.

Let's get to work, <race>. 

==Notes==
This is one of the three breadcrumb quests to Light's Breach. The other two come from [[Grizzly Hills]]. Only one of the three may be completed.

==Progression==
# [[The Call Of The Crusade]] (optional)
# [[The Cleansing Of Jintha'kalar]]
# Into the Breach! (classified as [[Zul'Drak]]) (exclusive with [[Reallocating Resources]] from [[Grizzly Hills]])
