==Objectives==
[[Apothecary Vicky Levine]] at [[Venomspite]] has asked you to use the Levine Family Termites to lure [[Foreman Kaleiki]] out and kill him.
* [[Foreman Kaleiki]] slain
* [[Levine Family Termites]] (provided)

==Description==
I received a few barrels of [[Plagueland Termites|termites]] from [[Mickey Levine|my sister]] at [[the Bulwark]] back home in the last shipment. I think they're going to come in handy for something I have in mind for you.

The lumbermill operations at [[New Hearthglen]] are problematic for us, but so far we haven't been able to get anyone in there to take out their foreman.

I think that if you were to unleash these termites on his precious woodworks, he'd be sure to come running.

Ready to take him out, <class>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
I miss my sister, Mickey. I hope she's well.

==Completion==
I knew my sister wouldn't let us down.

Well done, <name>. The [[Scarlet Onslaught|Onslaught]]'s lumbermill will be out of commission for a while, which means no new construction or [[ballista]]e.

Thanks for helping me to live up to the family name.
