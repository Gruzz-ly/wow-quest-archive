==Objectives==
Deliver the Translated Flesh-bound Tome to [[Captain Gort]] at [[Agmar's Hammer]].
*[[Translated Flesh-bound Tome]] (provided)

==Description==
Here it is, <name>. I have translated everything printed upon the pages of the tome. Inside it you will find a list of the names of [[Cult of the Damned]] members spanning the entire continent.

Their network of spies and operatives is impressive, to say the least.

Farewell, friend. May the book serve you and your people well.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Wastewind Headcover
|Snowfall Reaver Breastplate
|Anub'ar-Husk Leggings
|Stonepath Helm
}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|90}}
*30750 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
It's about time! Where have you been?

==Completion==
<Gort takes the tome from you and begins reading.>

WHAT! This can't be right. I've known some of these orcs for years!

Leave me, <name>. I have much work to do and many traitors to execute.

Take one of these items for your trouble. You've done a great service for the Horde this day.
