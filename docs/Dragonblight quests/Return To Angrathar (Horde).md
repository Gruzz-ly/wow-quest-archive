'''Return to Angrathar''' concludes the main [[Scourge]] questline for the [[Horde]] in [[Dragonblight]], culminating in an impressive cutscene at [[Angrathar the Wrathgate]]. After the cutscene is complete, the [[Alliance]], [[Horde]] and [[Scourge]] forces at the gate are all gone. In their place is [[Alexstrasza]] and [[Korialstrasz]].

== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Dranosh Saurfang|Saurfang the Younger]] at the [[Kor'kron Vanguard]] and tell him of your victory over the [[Scourge]].

== Description ==
With [[Grand Necrolord Antiok|Antiok]] slain and the scythe in our possession, the [[frost wyrm]] assaults upon your forces at [[Angrathar]] will halt. The wyrms that remain in the [[Dragonblight]] will be hunted and destroyed, their bones returning to the earth.

The time to make your final stand is now, <name>. Return to the [[Kor'kron Vanguard]] and notify [[Dranosh Saurfang|Saurfang the Younger]].

== Completion ==
[[Varok Saurfang|My father]] was right about you, <name>. Everything that he said has come to pass - only one final duty remains unfulfilled. I will now lead the [[Kor'kron]] to the front line. The time to end this war is at hand. The [[Lich King]]'s tyranny ends today!

Take my post now, <name>, and stand guard over our forces.

==Notes==
Completing this quest will display a [[Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate|rather impressive cutscene]], and awards {{achievement|Veteran of the Wrathgate}}.

On completion:
:{{text|say|Korialstrasz|My Queen, do they know?}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|No, my beloved.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|<nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Draconic]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> Ashj zila gul kirasath lok ante il lok buras danashj Gul gul}}
:{{text|emote|Korialstrasz nods.}}
:{{text|say|Korialstrasz|They will not.}}
:{{text|whisper|Alexstrasza|Come to me, <name>.}}

The line in Draconic means "They must not discover the fate of the {{npc||Bolvar Fordragon||young paladin}}. Not yet." when run through the in-game translator. This was the first clue that Bolvar had survived... one way or {{npc||Immolated Champion||another}}.

Originally, this quest was simply one more step in the quest chain.  However, with changes to [[Kalimdor]] for the [[Cataclysm]] expansion, those further quests were removed. The reputation gain for this quest was increased as well.
