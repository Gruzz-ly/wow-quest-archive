==Objectives==
[[Borus Ironbender]] at [[Agmar's Hammer]] in the [[Dragonblight]] wants you to bring him 8 [[Scourge Armament]]s.
* [[Scourge Armament]] (8)

==Description==
I can't make a damned thing out of this ore. It simply will not hold together! Despite my best efforts the Scourge metal will not bend!

Perhaps if I had some samples of some forged Scourge armaments I might be able to reverse engineer the process by which the items are created.

Icemist Village is crawling with armored Scourge Nerubians. Go there and get me some Scourge armaments! With your help I might actually succeed in creating something from this ore.

You'll find Icemist to the west. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Wastewind Leggings|Snowfall Reaver Leggings|Anub'ar-Husk Helm|Stonepath Chestguard}}

You will also receive:
*20300 (or {{cost|4|86|}} compensation at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
<Borus throws his tools down.>

These are useless!

==Completion==
These are in excellent condition, <name>. I'll get to work right away. If anything comes of this, you will be the first to know!
