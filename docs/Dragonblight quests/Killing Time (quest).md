==Objectives==
Kill the Infinite Shade of Delormi.
* [[Shade of Delormi]] slain

==Description==
Now, <name>, stand with me.

I am weak. So many threads have been severed.

I'll use what power I have left to mend the rift.

Please...make sure the fabric of time is safe from her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Please... I need your help!

==Completion==
So it's done, then. The final thread is severed.
