== Objectives ==
Report to [[Vargastrasz]] on a ridge outside of the [[Ruby Dragonshrine]], just east of [[Agmar's Hammer]]. 

== Description ==
You are leaving to the Ruby Dragonshrine. This is not a request.

The dragons are beset on all sides by the blue flight and the scourge... they're in no better a state than we are. It is not often we are afforded the opportunity to redeem ourselves for the transgressions of our ancestors.

I have secured a regiment to aid the [[red dragonflight]] against the [[Scourge]] at the Ruby Dragonshrine. Join them and crush the Scourge beneath your boots!

For the Horde! 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: 56

== Completion ==
Ambassador Golluck sent you?

If you talk to him again, please let him know that we are very appreciative of his aid. We are fighting battles on far too many fronts.
