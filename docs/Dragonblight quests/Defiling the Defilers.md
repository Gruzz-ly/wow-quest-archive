== Objectives ==
Locate and stamp out 8 Necromantic Runes that have been drawn on the floor inside the [[Maw of Neltharion]]. Return to [[Serinar]] once the task is complete.
* 8 [[Necromantic Rune]]s destroyed

== Description ==
I sensed a large accumulation of magic in the runes we witnessed when you were scouting the cave. I will not have you toy with extracting the magic... often the most straight forward solution is the most effective one.

Destroy the runes... stamp them out and ensure that the [[Cult of the Damned|Cult]] will not have access to whatever power that they've accumulated there.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|60}}
*20750 [[XP]]
*+325 [[reputation]] with [[Wyrmrest Accord]]

== Progress ==
Power wasted on the weak and useless.

Show me a being worth of the life and magic they have been gifted, and then perhaps we can talk of waste before extinguishing their presence.

Don't worry, I'll wait.

== Completion ==
Good, there is more to be done.

==Progression==
{{The Obsidian Dragonshrine}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
