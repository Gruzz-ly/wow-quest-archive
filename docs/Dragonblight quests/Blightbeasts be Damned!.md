==Description==
You've no doubt seen the army of Anub'ar blightbeasts that are being constructed at Icemist Village. The [[Anub'ar]] have plans to send those monsters against our soldiers at [[Angrathar the Wrathgate|the Wrathgate]]. This cannot happen!

Venture west to Icemist Village with this flare gun and use it to call down one of my war riders. Climb on its back and command it to destroy the blightbeasts that are out of reach from the ground!

Once you have decimated their aerial forces, return to me for your reward!
