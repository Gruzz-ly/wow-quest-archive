== Objectives ==
Take the Flesh-bound Tome to [[High Commander Halford Wyrmbane]] at [[Wintergarde Keep]] in [[Dragonblight]].
* [[Flesh-bound Tome (Alliance quest item) (2)]] (provided)

== Description ==
What can it be, <name>? That was certainly no ordinary curse the blasted [[lich]] put on you!

<[[Cavalier Durkon|Durkon]] flips through the grisly pages of the tome.>

I don't even know if I'm looking at it the right way. We must find out what information is held within this tome!

<Durkon hands the book back to you.>

The High Commander will know what to do. Take the flesh-bound tome to him and tell him exactly what happened here.

== Progress ==
The necrolord is no more?

== Completion ==
<Halford's eyes widen.>

The fates smile down upon us this day, <name>.  I know just the person to see about this tome.
