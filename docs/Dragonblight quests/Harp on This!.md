Kill the [[Mistress of the Coldwind]] and 15 [[Coldwind|Coldwind harpies]] in the mountains northwest of [[Nozzlerust Post]]. Return to [[Narf]] once the task is complete.

*Mistress of the Coldwind slain
*Coldwind Harpies (15)

==Description==
<class>, did you see that? That's the harpy that's been leading the attack on our shipments to the gate! I've seen her in the back of Coldwind Heights before.

Those harpies have slowed our profits long enough! Kill them all.

I remember you. You're not dead, so those harpy wretches better be.

==Completion==
That should make those uglies think twice.  Here... take your reward and get away with ya.
