== Objectives ==
Speak with [[High Commander Halford Wyrmbane]] at [[Wintergarde Keep]] in [[Dragonblight]].

== Description ==
Return to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at once, <name>. Let him know that your mission was a success and that the few remaining villagers that were rescued are back to work.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Frontrunner's Blessed Handwraps|Snowfall Reaver Boots|Westwind Waistband|Stonepath Gauntlets}}

== Completion ==
<Halford salutes.>

The townsfolk are back to work? Already? Outstanding, soldier! We'll get this town built back up and fortified in now time. Before long, reinforcements will be ready to joining the fight with [[Bolvar Fordragon|Lord Fordragon]] at the [[Angrathar the Wrathgate|Wrathgate]].

I'm getting ahead of myself, of course, as there is much left to do here before we can even think about sending you to the aid of Bolvar.

==Notes==
Wintergarde changes phase at the conclusion of this quest. Many more NPCs and quest givers will spawn in the keep and the inn.

The over-arching storyline also forks at this point. In addition to the direct followup to this quest chain ([[Rescue from Town Square]]), a few other quest chains are available. The "[[The Demo-gnome]]" chain is required to be completed before players can start the {{NPC||Thel'zan the Duskbringer}} chain, which leads directly into the [[Angrathar the Wrathgate]] storyline.

Another chain, starting with [[Imprints on the Past]], touches on the [[Arthas]]' history in the Dragonblight and reveals some of the backstory to players not well-versed in the [[Warcraft III]] expansion pack.

Finally, there are a few one-offs and Wanted quests made available at this point.
