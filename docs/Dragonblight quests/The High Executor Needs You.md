==Objectives==
Speak with [[High Executor Wroth]] at [[Venomspite]].

==Description==
It's a good thing that I intercepted this request from [[High Executor Wroth]] before it got to [[Overlord Agmar]]. What is Wroth thinking?

<The sergeant rips up the letter that he's holding.>

<class>, go see what it is that the high executor wants.

Follow the road east and pass through [[The Dragon Wastes]]. You'll find a path leading up out of the wastes on the southeast side, and the [[Forsaken]] town, Venomspite, will stand before you on the south side of the mountain. 

==Completion==
You were sent from Agmar's Hammer? It's about time!

No, the help is not for me. I simply have no one else to spare, but you'll do.
