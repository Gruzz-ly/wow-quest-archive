==Objectives==
[[Spy Mistress Repine]] at [[Venomspite]] has asked you to steal the Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders: Abbey, Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders: Barracks, and Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders: Beach.
* [[Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders: Abbey]]
* [[Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders: Barracks]]
* [[Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders: Beach]]

==Description==
I need to know what [[New Hearthglen]] is up to.

I want you to steal their orders of the day so that I can find that out.

Head south and in their abbey, in their [[barracks]], and on their beach, find those daily plans!

Just in case you're confused, the barracks is the large building right next to the [[Blacksmith|smithy]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Hand of Vengeance]]

==Progress==
If you take too long, their daily plans will change, and we may have to start over again.

Don't take too long!

==Completion==
Well, what are you waiting for, <race>? Hand them over!

==Notes==
*The Abbey: Go through the library. The orders are on a table in the back on the first floor.
*The Barracks: The orders are on the first floor near the stairs.
*The Beach: There's a path down to the beach near the abbey. The orders are to the right near some tents at the bottom of the path.
