==Objectives==
Close 3 Void Portals by killing [[Shadowmoon Portalmaster]]s.
*Void Portals closed (3)

==Description==
The Shadowmoon orcs are using portals to bring in reinforcements and smuggle away draenei captives.

If we are to have any hope of retaking [[Arbor Glen|the village]], we must destroy the portals at once.

The only way to do this is to kill the portalmasters who keep the rifts open.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
*13850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Breaking the fabric of space is extremely costly magic.  It must rend their very souls.

==Completion==
Wonderful. That should slow down the attack.

Our forces should be able to retake the forest quickly.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Dark Enemies]] and [[Think of the Children!]] before heading out. Kill both orcs channeling a fel portal to close the portal.

==Progression==
{{Shadows Awaken}}
