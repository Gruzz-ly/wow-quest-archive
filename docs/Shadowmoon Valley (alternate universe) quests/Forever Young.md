==Objectives==
Pick Youngroot for [[Beezil Linkspanner|Beezil]].
*[[Youngroot]] (5)

==Description==
All this sitting around is horrible for business.

I have to find a way to recoup some of my lost profits.

Those Draenei females are obsessed with the way their horns look.

I overheard one of them talking about a root that grows in [[Blademoon Bloom]] that supposedly reduces horn shedding or something.

I bet I could sell that root to them for a pretty nice profit.

I'll give you a cut if you help me get a supply going.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*13700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find any Youngroot?

==Completion==
Hmm... How am I going to package this?

I have an idea!

<Beezil writes Youngroot on a label and slaps it on a bottle of [[wikipedia:snake oil|adder oil]].>

<He throws the Youngroot in the bushes behind him.>

Perfect!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Poison Paralysis]], [[Botani Beatdown]], and [[Blademoon Bloom (quest)]] before heading out.

On the way to Blademoon Bloom, find a [[Sleepy Rangari]] on the east bank. She offers [[Slumberbloom (quest)]]. The red slumberblooms all over the area to the south. It may be easier to create a <code>/tar Slumber</code> macro and turn on target tracking on the minimap.

Further south, in the [[Blademoon Bloom]], find rare mandragora [[Venomshade]], which drops the [[Venomshade Skin Boots]] and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]].

All of the named NPCs and Youngroot nodes are marked on the minimap in [[Blademoon Bloom]]. The botani spawn in trees, and Arepheon is at the south end of the area. Find Arepheon and pick up his next quest, [[Gestating Genesaur]], before heading back to the caravan.
