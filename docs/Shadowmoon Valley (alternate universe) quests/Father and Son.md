==Objectives==
Find [[Haephest]]'s son.
* [[Duna]] Found

==Description==
Please find my boy!

Before the looters came we were on the hill just northeast of here.

There weren't many of them, but I'm a [[Smith|blacksmith]], not a fighter!

Have I let my only son down?

* 13,690 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Haephest's son has been located.

==Completion==
My boy!

<A tear falls down his cheek, clearing a path down to the skin where soot once rested.>

You... no words can explain how grateful I am.

I can only repay what I have to offer, which isn't much in terms of valued goods.  Most of my work goes straight to our soldiers.  I do, however, carry the wisdom of my people and my craft.

It would be an honor if you allowed me to share some of this wisdom with you.

May the light guide you, <name>.

==Notes==
Duna can be found in a tent {{coords|51.1|36.9|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}} next to the water in the [[Arbor Glen]] to the east of the [[Teluuna Observatory]] in {{Au|Shadowmoon Valley}}.

;Speaking with Duna
: Did my father send you?
''{{gossip|Yes, come with me.}}''
: {{text|say|Duna|Let's get outta here!}}
Duna will join the party and follow you back.
: {{text|say|Duna|Dad!  Dad!  We brought your tools!}}
: {{text|say|Haephest|Duna!  My boy... I thought you were lost.}}
