== Objectives ==
[[File:Shrakun.jpg|thumb|Shrakun]]

Meet [[Exarch Maladaar (alternate universe)|Exarch Maladaar]] at the cliffs east of the [[Altar of Sha'tar]]. Complete the ritual to cleanse and interrogate [[Exarch Hataaru (alternate universe)|Hataaru's]] corpse.
*Begin the Ritual {{co|66.4|26.2|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*Defend Hataaru's Spirit {{co|66.4|26.2|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

== Description ==
This was a betrayal from within. There's no other explanation for it. None of the Exarchs trust each other now - especially me. But [[Exarch Othaar|Othaar]] and [[Exarch Akama|Akama]] can damn their laws. We've got to rout out the traitor and the only way to do it is to speak to the corpse!

Join me just outside the Altar of Sha'tar atop the eastern cliffs. [[Soulbinder Nyami]] and I will perform an [[exorcism]] to save Hataaru's immortal [[soul]]... and maybe learn who did this to him.

Do you trust me, <name>?

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|80}}
* 13830 XP
* +250 [[reputation]] with the {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Progress ==
Exarch Hataaru didn't deserve to die that way.  Not like this.

== Completion ==
One of the five Exarchs is dead. Another is a traitor. Dark times.

We will end this here and now. Can I count on you for one final task?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|There is a rat among us. I will find out who.}}

Head east up the stairs and get behind the building. Speak with Maladaar:
:Fel energies are even now devouring Exarch Hataaru's soul. We must act quickly.

:Soulbinder Nyami will anchor Hataaru's spirit to this realm while I exorcise the demons assaulting him. With luck, we will find out who murdered him.

:It will be up to you to destroy the evil as I unleash it. Are you ready, <name>?

{{gossip|''I am ready. Begin the ritual, Exarch.''}}

:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|I will be unable to help once the ritual begins. Stay focused.}}
:{{text|say|Soulbinder Nyami|The body is ready, Exarch. I will anchor his spirit.}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|Golad, maloch, valsheva. Follow the sound of my voice, spirit. Lend your sight to the living. Golad, maloch, valsheva!}}
:''[[Shrakun]], an [[observer]], appears.''
:{{text|say|Shrakun|Begone, exarch. This one, and all he knows, belongs to us now.}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|You may have claimed his body, but his immortal soul is mine to protect.}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|Golad, maloch, valsheva! Goldad, maloch, valsheva - Light give me strength...}}
Kill the observer.
:{{text|say|Soulbinder Nyami|Exarch, they're tearing his soul apart. We must stop this!}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|Not until we know. We must know who did this to him!}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|Exoch, maloch, talomai! Hataaru, come to the light...}}
:''[[Tormentor Imp]]s appear.''
:{{text|say|[[Spirit of Hataaru]]|Auchindoun... they wanted...}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|...wanted what, Hataaru? The codes to Auchindoun? Your security wards?}}
:{{text|say|Soulbinder Nyami|Maladaar. We're losing him.}}
:''More imps...''
:{{text|say|Exarch Hataaru|...the Exarch's orders...}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|Who, Hataaru? Who had you killed?}}
:{{text|emote|Spirit of Hataaru points at Soulbinder Nyami.}}
:{{text|say|Spirit of Hataaru|...Soulbinder...}}
:''Nyami stops the ritual.''
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladar|What happened? Why did you stop it?}}
:{{text|say|Soulbinder Nyami|We were about to lose him. You saw him - he called out for me to help. His spirit is safe now.}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|He mentioned an Exarch. A betrayal from within the council itself?}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|Nyami, take the body to Auchindoun and lay it to rest.}}

Failure:
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|Stop - stop the ritual at once! Focus. We must protect his spirit.}}
