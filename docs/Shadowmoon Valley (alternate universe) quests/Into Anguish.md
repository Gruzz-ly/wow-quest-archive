==Objectives==
[[File:Mark of Darkness.jpg|thumb|Mark of Darkness.]]
[[File:Mark of Shadow.jpg|thumb|Mark of Shadows.]]
[[File:Mark of Anguish.jpg|thumb|Mark of Anguish.]]

Use the Fragment of Anguish at the main doorway. Then destroy the Mark of Darkness, Mark of Shadows, and Mark of Anguish.
*Doorway opened {{co|35.0|37.9|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*Mark of Darkness de-activated {{co|29.5|39.7|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*Mark of Shadows de-activated {{co|34.5|41.4|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*Mark of Anguish de-activated {{co|32.6|38.8|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*[[Fragment of Anguish]] (provided)

==Description==
{{Au|Rulkan}}'s gift to you, the Fragment of Anguish, will allow you to pass into the fortress unhindered. Go up these stairs to the doorway, then use the fragment to enter the compound.

Once you are inside, you will find three altars powering the magical barrier around their stronghold.

Destroy these runes, and [[Yrel]] and I will be able to join you in finding [[Ner'zhul]].

''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|With the keystone, you will be able to pass through, alone. Once inside, deactivate their shields and we will join you.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13850 XP
* +250 {{Au|Council of Exarchs}} reputation

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
<You hear Prophet Velen's voice in your mind.>

Good work, <name>! The barriers are down. We are on our way.

("Prophet Velen: Good work.")

==Notes==
Pick up [[On the Offensive]], [[Harbingers of the Void]], [[The Great Salvation]], and [[Across the Stars]] before heading in.

Run up the stairs and interact with the main doorway. Go through the entry building. Take a left to find the Mark of Shadows. Go a bit further to find the [[Essence of Shadow]]. Kill one of the [[Shadowmoon Prophet]]s to attack it. Turn around and find the Mark of Anguish on the opposite side of the door. Past it is the [[Essence of Darkness]] over a hole to the lower level. Further west up the hill is the Mark of Darkness. That will complete this quest automatically.
