== Completion ==
I have heard of you, traveler. Your people have come to defeat the [[Iron Horde]].

From what I have just seen, your combat skills are as impressive as they say.

I, too, wish to see the Iron Horde gone from this land. I will lend you the strength of my hammer, and you may also find my knowledge of crystalworking to be useful. What do you say?
