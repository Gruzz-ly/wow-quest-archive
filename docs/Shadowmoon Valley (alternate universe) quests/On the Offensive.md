==Objectives==
Kill 15 Shadowmoon Darkcasters or Shadowmoon Voidclaws.
*Shadowmoon forces slain (15)

==Description==
We cannot enter these gates, but you can, <class>.

Your mission is critical, and the Shadowmoon will kill you on sight. Do not hesitate to return the favor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
*13850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
We will win this conflict.

==Completion==
The Shadowmoon are not simple opponents. Your fighting skill is truly comparable to none.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Into Anguish]], [[Harbingers of the Void]], [[The Great Salvation]], and [[Across the Stars]] before heading in.

Don't focus on killing for this quest - those kills will come naturally.
