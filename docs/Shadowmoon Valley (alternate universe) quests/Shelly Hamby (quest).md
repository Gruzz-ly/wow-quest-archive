==Completion==
{{Au|Draenor}}... even the sound of this place makes me sick.

My husband is gone. I cannot go home while his memory lingers.

Please, let me join you and fight for you. Send me to the frontlines, wherever killing is needed.

With every enemy that I face, perhaps the pain will lessen.
