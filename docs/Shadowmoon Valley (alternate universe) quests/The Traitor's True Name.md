==Objectives==
Plant the Focusing Lens atop the [[Exarch's Rise]] in {{Au|Shadowmoon Valley}}.
*Plant the Focusing Lens {{co|60.5|20.6|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*Reveal the Traitor {{co|60.5|20.6|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*Deal with the Traitor {{co|60.5|20.6|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
We must give the traitor no place to hide. I have a focusing lens that will illuminate cloaked fel energy. If it were placed on a high point, it could act like a beacon, lighting up anyone in town who reeks of the fel taint.

There is a prayer circle atop the Exarch's Rise to the north that will serve our purpose. Plant the focusing lens, <name>. If you reveal anything, deal with it. Then meet me below.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 518 bracers|Rangari Initiate Wristwraps|Karabor Sage Wristwraps|Karabor Honor Guard Wristwraps|Karabor Skirmisher Wristwraps}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|23|60}}
*17290 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}
*[[Draenic Fence]]
*[[Draenic Fencepost]]

==Progress==
What happened up there?


Head northwest from Maladaar's position, up the highest hill of the area. Up top in the center of the area, find [[Exarch Othaar]]:
: ''Othaar is kneeling in front of the shrine.  At your approach, he greets you as he stands and walks near the center.''
:{{text|say|Exarch Othaar|Ahh, it's you. Trust me, friend, I will handle this. You may go.}}

Interact with the ghostly Maladaar's Focusing Lens object:
: ''Othaar becomes concerned, grows insistent, then angry.''
:{{text|say|Exarch Othaar|What is that? Is that Maladaar's work? No no, you don't need to do that. He is not to be trusted.}}

Finish the cast:
: ''Othaar is knocked on his rear; he's covered with fel energy!''
:{{text|say|Exarch Othaar|Damn him. I thought I'd gotten rid of Maladaar when I gave him up to the [[Iron Horde]].}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Othaar|Yes, I had [[Exarch Hataaru (alternate universe)|Hataaru]] killed. And you are next.}}
:''Othaar turns hostile.''

Attack him. At 75%:
:{{text|say|Exarch Othaar|I am not the traitor here. It was the false prophet {{Au|Velen}} who betrayed our people.}}

At 60%, Othaar goes immune for a few seconds:
:{{text|say|Exarch Othaar|I serve our true master now. The [[Burning Legion|legion]] whose call I once denied.}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Othaar|My Lord [[Sargeras]] will scorch [[Draenor (alternate universe)|this pathetic world]], as he has countless others.}}

Keep attacking. At 40%:
:{{text|say|Exarch Othaar|I have sworn the sacrament. I have taken my new name... '''Socrethar'''.}}

;Successfully kills player
:{{text|say|Exarch Othaar|The Legion's power is unsurpassed.}}

===As Socrethar===
:''He turns, revealing his true form as Socrethar, an elite with full health!''
:{{text|say|Socrethar|There are others at my command.  In [[Shattrath City (alternate universe)|Shattrath]] and {{Au|Auchindoun}}.}}

:''Get him to 60%.''
:{{text|say|Socrethar|Enough! When next we meet, it will be on MY terms.}}
: ''Socrethar channels Demonic Rift to escape.''
:{{text|say|Socrethar|Tell the remaining [[exarch]]s to number their days.}}

;Successfully kills player
: ''He laughs.''
:{{text|say|Socrethar|The Legion will prevail.}}

==Completion==
<The Exarch listens to your tale, his face contorting into concern, grief, and finally anger.>

So Othaar has lost his way. "Socrethar" he calls himself now. At last we have our answer. I fear my capture at the hands of the Iron Horde was his doing. There may be other traitors amongst us - I must hurry back to Auchindoun and make sure we are safe.

In the meantime, I believe the Exarchs owe you a decision...

==Notes==
This concludes the "The Pursuit of Justice" portion of [[As I Walk Through the Valley of the Shadow of Moon]]. However, {{Au|Exarch Naielle}} offers one last quest, [[Friend of the Exarchs]] to gain a Garrison Follower.

The [[Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe) storyline|Shadowmoon Valley storyline]] continues with [[Into Twilight]] and [[The Southern Wilds]], both picked up on conclusion of [[Shadows Awaken]] back at the [[Teluuna Observatory]]. The Southern Wilds is closer, but is a side chain.
