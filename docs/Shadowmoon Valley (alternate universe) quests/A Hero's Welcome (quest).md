==Objectives==
Speak to [[Samaara]] at [[Embaari Village]] in {{Au|Shadowmoon Valley}}.
*Find Samaara at Embaari Village {{co|46.0|38.9|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
{{Au|Velen|Prophet Velen}} has asked me to show you around Shadowmoon Valley.

We will go first to Embaari Village, where my sister Samaara is waiting for us. I have not seen her since the [[Iron Horde]] took me to [[Tanaan Jungle|Tanaan]].

The village is just one of many trading villages between the [[Karabor|Temple of Karabor]] and [[Shattrath]].

Follow the road east and make your way to Embaari Village. I will accompany you, my friend.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
*13850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
On accept (and any phase respawn):
:{{text|say|Yrel|I will go with you, hero. A warm welcome awaits us at Embaari Village.}}

On approach in Embaari:
:{{text|say|Yrel|I can't wait to surprise my sister, Samaara. I never thought I would see her again.}}

On approach of Samaara in Embaari:
: ''Yrel is bursting with joy to see her big sister.''
:{{text|say|Yrel|Samaara! I'm back!}}
:{{text|say|Samaara|Yrel? After the Iron Horde took you, I feared the worst!}}
:{{text|say|Yrel|The light granted me strength when I needed it most. It is good to be home.}}

==Completion==
Thank you, stranger! The Prophet spoke of new allies arriving on our shores.

I hear it is thanks to you that my sister is safe.

I owe you a great debt, friend.

==Notes==
Before heading out, pick up [[Migrant Workers]] and speak with Zipfizzle to start the caravan. Before doing that quest chain, work on this one.

If you have completed [[Draenor Pathfinder]], go ahead and fly: Yrel will use a faerie dragon.

Follow the path south out of the garrison.
:{{text|say|Yrel|Your garrison is impressive, hero. Even draenei builders could not work so quickly.}}

Take the left fork, continuing southeast. Just past the fork is [[Taarvos]], a merchant:
: ''Yrel greets the man warmly as she rides up to him.''
:{{text|say|Yrel|Hello Mister Taarvos!}}
:{{text|say|Taarvos|Yrel!?! Have you come back from the dead?}}
: ''Yrel chuckes.''
:{{text|say|Yrel|It will take more than some orcs to defeat me!}}

Next to Taarvos, a wanted poster calls for the death of [[Kuu'rat]] in [[WANTED: Kuu'rat's Tusks]].

If you go near [[Anguish Fortress]]:
: {{text|say|Yrel|We will not be able to pass through their gates.  If you wish to try, I will wait for you here.}}

Just outside the village on the [[Plains of Serenity]] is a small camp with [[Maami]], [[Trapper Turannos]], and [[Trapper Zera]]:
:{{text|say|Maami|Yrel! Is that you? You still owe me six copper!}}
: ''Maami sounds somewhat annoyed.''
:{{text|say|Yrel|What was that? I couldn't hear you! Quickly hero, let's go before she comes after me!}}

At the first fork of the village's ranches, children crowd around you and Yrel (this may bug out if you're not at a walking pace):
:{{text|say|Draenei Child|Yrel! She's come to save us!}}
:{{text|say|Draenei Child|She's back!}}
:{{text|say|Draenei Child|Yay! You're here!}}
: ''Yrel greets the children warmly.''
:{{text|say|Yrel|Good day, children! I've brought a hero from a far away land to meet you.}}
:{{text|say|Draenei Child|A hero! A hero!}}
:{{text|say|Draenei Child|Hello stranger!}}
:{{text|say|Draenei Child|The stranger will help us!}}
