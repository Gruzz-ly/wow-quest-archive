==Objectives==
Kill Everburn.
*Speak to [[Yrel]]
*[[Everburn]] slain

==Description==
An [[Exarch]] must be a pillar of strength, and no greater strength is there than the courage to face danger.

Far to the northwest, among the snowy crags of [[Frostfire Ridge]], lives a primal [[Furies|fury]] named Everburn.

Only when you face one of these creatures eye to eye, will you know the extent of your courage.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|30|80|}}
*18,840 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Completion==
I see that you and [[Yrel]] have stared into the eyes of the most primal of the [[elemental]]s, and not waivered from your path.

It pleases me to say that your courage is not lacking.
