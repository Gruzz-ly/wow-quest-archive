: ''Jarrod stands unsteadly; he's bleeding heavily. He walks forward and stops to speak.''

==Notes==
Pick up [[Prune the Podlings]] before exiting the cave. All podlings are hostile now, so watch out! Also, keep an eye out for a [[Captured Critter]], which starts the quest [[Captured Critters]]. Kill a path to the west-southwest, noting the rare [[Leaf-Reader Kurri]] on a northwestern island, which drops the [[Mushroom of Destiny]] and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]].

On the west end of the grove, up out of the marsh in the shadow of the garrison, find [[King Deathbloom]]. Kill him and turn in to [[Shelly Hamby]] just up the hill to the northwest.

This completes the "Gloomshade Grove" chapter of [[As I Walk Through the Valley of the Shadow of Moon]], the last side chapter of the [[Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe) storyline|Shadowmoon Valley storyline]]. Shelly offers one last quest to pick her up as a follower, though.

==Trivia==
The name of this quest is a reference to the television series ''[[wikipedia:Game of Thrones|Game of Thrones]]'' based on George R. R. Martin's ''[[wikipedia:A Song of Ice and Fire|A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series of fantasy novels. The latter also has a reference in Draenor in the form of [[A Song of Frost and Fire]].
