==Objectives==
Collect 6 Vials of Toad Juice.
*[[Vial of Toad Juice]] (6)

==Description==
Oh my, such a vigorous young <lad/lass>! Such a spring in your step, and such a sparkle in your eye!

When you get to my age, it's all aches and pains.

Luckily, I have a recipe for an unguent that would soothe my joints. I just need the ooze from the skin of belly toads in the swamp.

Would you be a dear and help an old woman out?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
*13850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
It's all downhill from here, dearie.

==Completion==
Oh thank you child, thank you, thank you.

The nights in the swamp are cold. It means a lot to this old woman to have some comfort from her aching bones.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Clarity Elixir]] and [[Loola's Lost Love]] before heading out.

Interact with Muddy Toads and [[Belly Toad]]s, kill [[Echidnian Hydra]]s for their [[Engorged Heart]], [[Frenzied Swamplighter]]s for their [[Swamplighter Dust]], and the [[Pristine Star Lily]] is in the center of one of the big eastern trees of the marsh.
