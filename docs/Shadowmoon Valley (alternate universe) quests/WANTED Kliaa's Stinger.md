==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Kliaa.jpg|Kliaa|Retrieve its stinger.}}
Kill [[Kliaa]] and bring its stinger to [[Dyuna]] at [[Embaari Village]].
*[[Massive Stinger]]
Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
Posted by: Dyuna

A vicious queen swamplighter has made the northern forests of Shadowmoon its home.

Unfortunately, this poisonous pest now terrorizes the forest between Embaari Village and [[Shattrath City (alternate universe)|Shattrath]].  As local traders put their lives at risk, prices of goods will continue to rise.

Anyone who can put an end to the beast should detach its stinger as proof and bring it to Dyuna in Embaari Village. The merchant traders will reward generously.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 515 trinkets|Kliaa's Venomclaws|Throbbing Swampfly Venom Sac|Probiscus of the Swampfly Queen}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|23|60}}
* 17,290 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Word around town is you've been hunting Kliaa.  Any luck?

==Completion==
By the elders of [[Karabor]]... that thing is huge!

Our trade routes will be safe once again.  Well... as safe as you can be running through the northern forests.

Well done, <class>!

==Notes==
Head west past [[Anguish Fortress]] to the bonus objective area: [[Bloodthorn Hill]].  The wanted poster was dropped when [[Jorril]] was killed.  Just east of the [[Bloodthorn Cave]] on top of the hill is Kliaa.
