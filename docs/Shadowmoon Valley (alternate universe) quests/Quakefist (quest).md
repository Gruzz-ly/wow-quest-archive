== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Quakefist.jpg|Quakefist}}
Kill Quakefist.
*[[Quakefist]] slain {{co|30.2|21.8|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

== Description ==
I'm getting reports of a giant in the forest.

A few of the Karabor peacekeepers have followed it to a cave. In all honesty I don't think any of our troops are willing to engage the beast.

Maybe you could investigate? I'm sure the peacekeepers would appreciate the help.

== Rewards ==
Remaining abilities will be unlocked.

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP
*+250 {{Au|Council of Exarchs}} reputation

== Progress ==
Did you kill the giant in the cave?

== Completion ==
The base is significantly more secure with that giant dead.

You have made quite an impression on the peacekeepers.

== Notes ==
Quakefist is in a cave south-southeast of Yrel's position a few hundred yards away.

In the [[Lunarfall Matriarch]]'s nest at {{co|30.2|19.9|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}, look for the [[Lunarfall Egg]], which contains 5-10x [[Garrison Resources]]. The egg can only be found while [[Lunarfall]] is not in the garrison phase, so find it before completing [[Establish Your Garrison (Alliance)]] or it will be lost forever.

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Yrel|With the giant defeated we shouldn't have any more trouble clearing out the area.}}

{{rfb-section}}
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Yrel|Killing the beast will surely gain the respect of Karabor peacekeepers.}}

==Progression==
{{Establishing a Foothold}}

== Patch changes ==
