==Description==
Posted by: [[Orrin]]

A wild [[talbuk]] called "Maa'run" wanders the hills southeast of [[Embaari Village]] and west of [[Draakorium|The Draakorium]].

My brother was injured by this foul beast, and now lays in recovery.

For the safety of all the nearby villages, we must put an end to this vicious, rampaging creature!

A handsome reward will be given to anyone who can bring me his hoof as proof of his demise.

("Maa'run: Collect his hoof, collect the reward.")

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Maa'run's Prescient Eye
|Maa'run's Treacherous Eye
|Maa'run's Baleful Eye
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|30|80|}}
* 17,110 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
My brother, [[Anduur]], gathers wild berries from the hills above our village.

It was during one of his excursions that he met up with [[Maa'run]].

I demand retribution for his injuries.

==Completion==
Thank you, adventurer! We can rest more easily knowing this beast has been put to its end.
