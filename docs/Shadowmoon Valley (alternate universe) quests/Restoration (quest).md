==Objectives==
Retrieve the sample for [[Artificer Baleera]].
*[[Empowered Crystal (Draenor)]]

==Description==
As mentioned, our larger defense crystals have been drained of power, creating gaps in our defenses. The crystal you brought me is only a reminder of the severity of this situation. It's Shadowmoon magic to blame, I'm sure of it.

One of our rangari scouts spotted an orc fleeing north, past [[Exile's Rise|Palemoon Village]], and into the valley beyond. Go, find this orc, and see if you can't retrieve whatever vessel he's storing the power inside of. If we get it back, I'm sure I can restore the crystals.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|11|40}}
|item1=Gem Boutique, Level 1
|item2=Draenor Jewelcrafting (item)
}}

*13,690 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
The crystal's power pulses as it is carried.

==Completion==
You've found it! This crystal is overflowing with energy. This is definitely what we were looking for.

I fear even thinking about what kind of ritual this orc was planning to undergo with the power from this crystal.

You've done a great thing for us, <class>. As promised, I would like to show you my appreciation by teaching you how to work with some of our native gems and crystals. I trust you will put the knowledge to good use.

== Notes ==
Your target is [[Morakh Chillwhisper]], located at the base of [[Mount Kra'gor]] on the eastern side, a ways north of the village and at the other end of [[Umbrafen]] from [[Elodor]].

Be aware that he is surrounded by [[Shadow Skeleton]]s.
