==Objectives==
Speak with {{Au|Exarch Hataaru}} outside of the [[Elodor Dig]].

==Description==
I will also need you to call upon Exarch Hataaru. I understand you were helping him with our defenses at the gate.

Hataaru is our Chief Artificer - he understands our technology better than any other and has been working tirelessly to recreate the glory of the civilization we left behind.

He has moved to his workstation outside of the Elodor Dig, our crystal mines located just to the Southeast. Look for him at the mine entrance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|18}}
*1400 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Completion==
Ah, <name>! I suspected I would see you again soon.

I am willing to speak on your behalf at the Exarch Council, but an emergency situaion has come up...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Naielle, The Rangari]] before heading out. Hataaru is southeast of the quest giver at the entrance to the mine.

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|I will seek out Exarchs Akama and Maladaar. Good luck, Commander.}}

==Progression==
{{The Pursuit of Justice}}

==Patch changes==
