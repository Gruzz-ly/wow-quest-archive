== Objectives ==
[[File:Keeping it Together - Jarrod and Shelly.jpg|thumb|Shelly and Jarrod]]
Speak with [[Shelly Hamby|Shelly]], find [[Assistant Brightstone]], and check the Garrison Cache.
*Speak with Assistant Brightstone about her work ethic {{co|44.8|53.5|Lunarfall||1}}
*Gather [[Shelly's Report]] {{co|32.5|34.5|Lunarfall||1}}
*Check the Garrison Cache {{co|49.3|43.3|Lunarfall||1}}

== Description ==
So much work to do... I don't even know where to start.

Making sure this garrison is operational is not an easy task.

Shelly still hasn't reported back to me, my assistant Brightstone and her crew are who knows where, ugh... I'm so caught up I haven't even had time to check our cache for resources.

If I were a mage, do you think I could use [[Mirror Image|mirror images]] to do all of this at once?

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP
*55x[[Garrison Resources]]

== Progress ==
Can we speak a little later, <Sir/Madam>? I don't really have time to talk at the moment.

== Completion ==
You did what? You are a life saver, commander.

With those tasks out of the way my job will be much easier.

== Notes ==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Baros Alexston|How am I supposed to do this all myself!? Keep it together, Baros... keep it together.}}

Pick up [[Ship Salvage]] and [[Pale Moonlight]] before heading out.

To the southeast, at {{co|44.8|53.5|Lunarfall||1}} next to [[Vindicator Maraad]], find [[Assistant Brightstone]]:
:Baros is looking for me?
:I've been right here with my crew the whole time... Poor guy is so busy he's losing it.
:Alright, break time is over.
''{{gossip|Time to get back to work.}}''
:{{text|say|Assistant Brightstone|Alright, break time's over, fellas.}}
* {{text|say|Lunarfall Woodcutter|But, I was about to win...}}
* {{text|say|Lunarfall Woodcutter|Do we have to?}}
* {{text|say|Lunarfall Woodcutter|Ok, fine.}}
* {{text|say|Lunarfall Woodcutter|Alright, back to work.}}

North of [[Rachelle Black]]'s lean to, find at {{co|49.4|44.1|Lunarfall||1}} a Garrison Cache on the ground. It contains some [[Garrison Resources]] gathered by the troops!

Outside the garrison wall to the west up the hill, find [[Jarrod Hamby|Jarrod]] and [[Shelly Hamby]] chatting next to a lumber pile. Speak with Shelly:
:Where did [[Pippers]] go? Little guy keeps stealing my supplies.
:Oops! I meant to check in with Baros, we have just been really busy.
:This forest is almost out of wood... I need to get a logging operation together. I'll send a full report to Baros as soon as possible.
{{gossip|Gather Shelly's report.}}
:{{text|say|Shelly Hamby|Start gathering everybody together, we need to expand our operation. And let me know if you find Pippers... he stole my favorite slippers.}}

[[File:Pippers' Buried Supplies.jpg|thumb|Pippers Buried Supplies]]
Pippers has four caches of around 10 [[Garrison Resources]] each, buried in dirt piles called [[Pippers' Buried Supplies]]:
*Just northwest of Shelly and Jarrod past the tent near the draenei monument {{co|31.1|27.6|Lunarfall||1}}
*Immediately outside the town hall's front left corner {{co|42.4|54.4|Lunarfall||1}}
*Behind [[Rachelle Black]]'s blacksmith hut {{co|50.6|48.4|Lunarfall||1}}
*Outside the south entrance, west of the road, by a tree {{co|49.1|76.9|Lunarfall||1}}

[[File:Spark's Stolen Supplies.jpg|thumb|Spark's Stolen Supplies]]
For some more hidden supplies, exit the south gate and turn around back to the northeast. In what will eventually be the fishing pond, find [[Scrap Sparkfuse]] swimming about on a patrol from the southern end of the pond to the underwater cave to the north, and if spoken with, has this to say:
:Supplies? What supplies? I have no idea what you are talking about.
:<Scrap's eyes dart back and forth and he nervously clears his throat.>
:What? I'm not trying to steal them or anything... I mean, if I knew what you were even talking about, which I don't.

Taking a hint, swim into the northern underwater cave to find [[Spark's Stolen Supplies]] at {{co|50.7|0.8|Lunarfall||1}} near the back, which contains 20 [[Garrison Resources]].

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Baros Alexston|I feel so relieved. Maybe I can actually do some stargazing tonight. That would be a nice change of pace.}}
