==Objectives==
Find and release Deema from her time prison.
*Free [[Deema]]

==Description==
Oru'kai was the first ogre mage to master the art of enchanting on Draenor. Upon his death, his items were scattered across Draenor. I have tracked his staff to the shore you see before us. As you can see, the staff's enchantment is making it difficult to retrieve. A would-be apprentice, Deema, took one of Oru'kai's rings in to break the enchantment, but she failed and became trapped as well. Find and free Deema, take the ring, complete her task, and I will consider a reward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|8|60}}
* 10,270 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you. I thought I was going to be stuck here forever.

==Patch changes==
