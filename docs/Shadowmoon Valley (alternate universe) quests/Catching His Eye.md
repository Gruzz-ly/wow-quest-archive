==Objectives==
Capture the All-Seeing Eye.
*[[All-Seeing Eye]] captured {{co|21.8|15.9|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
For what must be done, I need someone I can trust. You're one of those few.

The woods and the orc village, [[Gul'var]], are protected from my scrying magic. We need to pierce that veil. I think I know a way.

There's a fel presence within the woods. A [[Observer|demonic watcher]] is there, hidden in a cave from which it casts its all-seeing gaze.

I would like for you and [[Cordana Felsong|the warden]] to capture it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|26}}
* 17800 XP

==Progress==
We're going to capture the All-Seeing Eye and break its will.

This is the way that we'll be able to scry upon the Shadow Council at Gul'var without them knowing it's us.

==Completion==
As soon as we have enough blessed water from the priestess's moonwell, we'll break the demon's will and use it as a proxy to see into Gul'var.

That way, they won't know it's us scrying upon them.

But first, we need to weaken their shrouding magic.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Cordana Felsong|I'm going ahead to the demon's lair. We'll capture it together.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|The priestess of the moon also has something to ask of you.}}

Pick up [[Shadowmoonwell]] before heading out. Head northwest into the [[Cursed Woods]]. Pick up the [[Chunk of Lunar Rock]] in the lower pool, and feel free to kill rare sporebat [[Veloss]] in the upper pool. Get back to the road and head north. Cordana will call out:
:{{text|say|Cordana Felsong|Come on. This way.}} Follow her northwest to reach the [[Watcher's Den]], where the [[All-Seeing Eye]] awaits.
:{{text|say|Cordana Felsong|In here.}}

Aggro it:
:{{text|say|All-Seeing Eye|I SEE YOU!}}
:{{text|yell|All-Seeing Eye|Not today, little <race>!}}

Get it to 10%:
:{{text|yell|All-Seeing Eye|NOOOOO!}}
:{{text|say|Cordana Felsong|Well done. I'll take it back to the outpost and see that it's secured.}}
:{{text|say|Cordana Felsong|Come, foul creature.}}

Head back to Starfall:
:{{text|say|Cordana Felsong|It'd be easier to guard you if you stayed out of sight, Khadgar.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I am not a child to cower beneath your cape, Cordana.}}

;On complete
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Together, we will defeat the Shadow Council.}}
