==Objectives==
Use Ameeka's Flytrap Ichor to create a Swatch of Hexweave.
*[[Hexweave Swatch]] Created

==Description==
I shall now impart to you the finer points of creating [[Hexweave Cloth|hexcloth]].

The process is quite simple. It involves immersing carefully woven fur into the ichor drawn from {{item|Gorgrond Flytrap|Gorgrond Flytraps}}.

Normally, you would need to harvest it yourself, but I actually managed to liberate some from the Shadowmoon during their last raid.

You are welcome to use it.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|11|40}}
|item1=Tailoring Emporium, Level 1
|item2=Draenor Tailoring (item)
}}

* 13,690 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Progress ==
Were you successful, friend?

==Completion==
This is perfect! The cloth and magic are perfectly balanced and stable.

I am happy to say that you have learned the basics of my tailoring methods. I respect your skill and your eagerness to learn new techniques.

Let me give you some other patterns and materials that I hope you find useful during your journey.
