==Objectives==
Search the beach for salvageable parts.
*[[Pilfered Parts]]

==Description==
We were able to map all of the data from the transponder you recovered!  Now our location analyzer is complete!

We're just missing a few final pieces, then the real testing begins.

One of my pilots mentioned seeing a beached [[Iron Horde]] ship over by the shore.  If you can salvage some parts we may just be able to get this thing up and running!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|item1=Engineering Works, Level 1
|item2=Draenor Engineering (item)
}}

You will also gain:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*13,690 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Don't worry.  We're just borrowing these from the Iron Horde!

==Completion==
Those supplies were just what I needed!  I think I'm finally figuring out how to work with all these Draenor parts.  I'd be happy to show you, commander.  I should be able to fix it in a jiffy.

Oh... and remember, deep breaths!
