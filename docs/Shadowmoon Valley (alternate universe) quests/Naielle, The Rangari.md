==Objectives==
Speak to {{Au|Exarch Naielle}} in the [[Rangari Enclave]].

==Description==
I am calling the Exarch Council to order to hear your petition. None of us doubt that this "[[Iron Horde]]" is a threat; but few can agree on what we should do about it. It is up to you and [[Vindicator Maraad]] to gather the Exarchs together.

Exarch Naielle is the leader of the rangari, the "Eyes of the Prophet." They are our scouts who silently stalk the farthest corners of Draenor. Seek her out in the Rangari Enclave northwest of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|18}}
*1400 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Completion==
<Name>! You have only just arrived but already your name is the talk of [[Elodor]].

I will gladly support your cause for the Exarch Council - it has always been my opinion that the draenei need to get out and be proactive in our world instead of hiding behind our walls.

But first, I need your help with something...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Hataaru, the Artificer]] before heading out. On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|I will seek out Exarchs Akama and Maladaar. Good luck, Commander.}}
Get to the [[Rangari Enclave]] by following the path north from Othaar's position, then down the hill to the northwest.

==Progression==
{{The Pursuit of Justice}}
