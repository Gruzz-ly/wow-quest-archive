== Objectives ==
Acquire a Pristine Sporebat Stinger from a [[Moonglow Sporebat]].
*[[Pristine Sporebat Stinger]]

== Description ==
The exarchs seem to trust you, <class>. Are you venturing into the [[Umbrafen]]?

The sporebats in this area are usually docile, but something's got them all riled up. When they attack, their stingers wrap around exposed limbs. I've seen them tear through reinforced leather like it was paper. How do they work, I wonder?

Could you bring me a pristine sporebat stinger? I'd love to study it.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13850 XP
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Progress ==
Most draenei avoid the Umbrafen, but we rangari seem drawn to the most dangerous places - that's where you really learn how the world works.

== Completion ==
Would you look at that - the entire tentacle is barbed. Uggh. No wonder the wounds they inflict tend to get infected. We could learn something from this. I wonder if rangari explorers should start equipping themselves with whips?

Thank you, <name>. This Alliance that you come from must be quite the collection of heroes!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Fun with Fungus]] from [[Exarch Naielle (alternate universe)|Exarch Naielle]] before heading out.

It helps to interact with an orange Shimmershroom to turn the spores friendly for 30 seconds to make killing the sporebats easier.

At the northern end of the Umbrafen, keep an eye out for [[Ba'ruun]], rare elite [[fungal giant]]. It drops [[Ba'ruun's Bountiful Bloom]] and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]].
