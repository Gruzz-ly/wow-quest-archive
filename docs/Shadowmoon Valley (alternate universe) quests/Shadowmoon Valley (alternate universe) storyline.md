[[File:VZ-Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe).jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

The '''Shadowmoon Valley storyline''' takes place after completing the Alliance portion of the [[Warlords of Draenor intro experience]] in [[Tanaan Jungle]]. The main storyline is tracked in the quest achievement [[As I Walk Through the Valley of the Shadow of Moon]].

There are also a large number of [[:Category:Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe) vignettes|vignettes in Shadowmoon Valley]], as in all zones of Draenor.

==Main storyline==
===Establishing a Foothold===

After landing, a base of operations is in order. But make sure to clear out the hostiles first!

{{Establishing a Foothold}}

After completing "Delegating on Draenor", two quests open up: [[A Hero's Welcome (quest)]], which starts the "Shadows Awaken" chapter, and [[Migrant Workers]], which starts the "The Pursuit of Justice" chapter. Additionally, a breadcrumb to [[Ashran]] opens up in [[Ashran Appearance]].

===Shadows Awaken===
[[File:Shadows Awaken.jpg|thumb|Ner'zhul at the observatory]]

Yrel wants to go on a welcome back tour, but things quickly go south after the Shadowmoon clan start invading.

{{Shadows Awaken}}

After "Shadows Awaken", two quests open up: [[Into Twilight]], which starts the "A Sister's Sacrifice" chapter, and [[The Southern Wilds]], which starts the "Purifying the Gene Pool" chapter.

===A Sister's Sacrifice===
[[File:The Dark Side of the Moon - setup.jpg|thumb|Yrel and Velen listening to Ner'zhul]]

Ner'zhul has taken Samaara, so it's time to go get her back and figure out what Ner'zhul's grand plan is.

{{A Sister's Sacrifice}}

After all of the step six quests, Velen starts the "The Light Prevails" chapter with [[Darkness Falls]]. In addition, the Shadowmoon Clan will launch an [[Garrison#Invasion|invasion]] ([[Shadowmoon Invasion! (intro)]]) on the Garrison. Unlike the Horde version, repelling the invasion is not necessary to finish the storyline.

===The Light Prevails===
[[File:The Righteous March.jpg|thumb|Clearing a path to Karabor]]

The Iron Horde has launched their attack on Karabor! It's time to stop Ner'zhul once and for all.

{{The Light Prevails}}

This concludes the primary Shadowmoon Valley storyline. After completing "The Defense of Karabor", Yrel sends players on to the [[Gorgrond storyline]] in [[The Secrets of Gorgrond (Alliance)]]. That breadcrumb is also available the instant players reach level 92 by speaking with [[Bodrick Grey]] at the garrison.

Don't forget the side-storyline quests in the next sections. In addition, check your mailbox for a mail from Yrel containing the [[The Prophet's Arcanum]], for [[The Prophet's Final Message]].

===Gloomshade Grove===
[[File:King Deathbloom.jpg|thumb|King Deathbloom]]

The podlings just outside Lunarfall in Gloomshade Grove have started attacking workers, so it's up to the commander to defend against the threat. A breadcrumb to [[Gloomshade Grove]] opens up after completing the "Shadows Awaken" chapter back at the garrison, but the chain can be started by finding the [[Lost Packmule]] in the [[Plains of Serenity]], just south of the grove.

{{Gloomshade Grove}}

===The Pursuit of Justice===
[[File:Warning the Exarchs.jpg|thumb|There's a traitor here. Guess who?]]

The garrison needs food, so some workers are sent out to [[Elodor]], the breadbasket of Shadowmoon Valley, but things quickly spiral out of control. This side story opens up upon completion of [[Delegating on Draenor]].

{{The Pursuit of Justice}}

===Purifying the Gene Pool===
[[File:Crippled Caravan.jpg|thumb|How'd they fit the caravan through the portal?]]

A breadcrumb to the Drakkorium opens up after completing the "Shadows Awaken" chapter, but the chain can be started by heading there at any point. A traveler (and her caravan) from [[Eastern Plaguelands]] makes an appearance!
