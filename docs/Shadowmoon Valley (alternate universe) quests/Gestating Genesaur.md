==Objectives==
[[File:Blooming Genesaur.jpg|thumb|Blooming Genesaur]]
Kill the genesaur.
*[[Blooming Genesaur]] slain {{co|56.1|73.2|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
This is bad. A [[genesaur]] is starting to sprout right here in [[Blademoon Bloom|the bloom]].

This is the first reported case of a genesaur being born in draenor{{sic}} in over three hundred years.

No wonder the [[botani]] have been acting so crazy. They are bringing back bodies to fertilize that monstrosity.

We have to kill it before it gets any larger. Once fully grown there is no stopping that beast.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 520 hands|Rangari Initiate Gauntlets|Karabor Skirmisher Gloves|Karabor Honor Guard Gauntlets|Karabor Sage Gloves}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*13700 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
I never thought I would see a genesaur in my lifetime.

==Completion==
That was close.

If that genesaur would have grown any larger we would have needed an army to destroy it.

Thank you for all your help.

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Rangari Arepheon|Lead the charge against the genesaur, <name>. The rangari will be right behind you.}}

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Rangari Arepheon|I'm not sure we could have defeated that genesaur without you. Until we meet again, <name>.}}

The genesaur is just to the southeast. Aggro it and a number of rangari will fly in to help kill it.

This completes the "Purifying the Gene Pool" portion of [[As I Walk Through the Valley of the Shadow of Moon]]. Back at the caravan, Fiona offers [[Fiona (quest)]] to gain her as a follower upon completion of this quest.
