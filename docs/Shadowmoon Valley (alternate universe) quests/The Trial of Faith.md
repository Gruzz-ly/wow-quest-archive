==Objectives==
Speak to Soulbinder Tuulani outside the entrance to {{Au|Auchindoun}}, then pass the Trial of Faith.
*Speak to [[Soulbinder Tuulani]]
*{{Au|Exarch Hataaru}} challenged
*[[Maraad]] challenged

==Description==
No [[Exarch]] trial is complete without a holy pilgrimage to the sacred resting place of our fallen champions.

On the way, I ask that you take Vindicator Maraad's ashes and lay them to rest within the hallowed halls of Auchindoun.

There, the spirits of our fallen ancestors will test [[Yrel]]'s greatest weakness.

Good luck.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|30|80|}}
*18,840 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Completion==
It seems you have been successful in your journey.

How do I know this? If you had not passed the challenge of the ancestors, you would not have returned at all.
