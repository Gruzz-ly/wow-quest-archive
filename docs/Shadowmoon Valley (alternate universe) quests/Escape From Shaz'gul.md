==Description==
I've failed, <name>...

My squadron was caught by a wandering patrol. We fought fiercely, but the alarm had been raised. The rangari forced me into hiding before surrendering themselves to the enemy.

They were under MY command, and they gave their lives... for what? I... I'm not sure what to do, <name>.

We need to get out of here, but how?

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 513 boots|Rangari Initiate Sabatons|Karabor Skirmisher Boots|Karabor Honor Guard Warboots|Karabor Sage Treads}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|35|40}}
*20750 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Speak with Yrel:
:It's hopeless. How are we going to get out of here?

** ''{{gossip|You must choose, Yrel. Will you rise and fight, or fall here to doubt?}}''

==Completion==
I could never have done it without you, <name>. Your words unlocked something within me which I have not felt before.

Call it what you wish - resolve, conviction, faith. I will not soon forget this, <class>.

==Notes==
If not done with Velen's quests, [[The Clarity Elixir]] and [[The Fate of Karabor]], do those now.

On completion of both this quest and [[The Fate of Karabor]], [[Scout Valdez]] flies in:
:{{text|say|Scout Valdez|Commander! Shadowmoon forces are gathering up outside of the garrison. Our troops are in defensive positions and await your orders.}}

==Progression==
{{A Sister's Sacrifice}}
