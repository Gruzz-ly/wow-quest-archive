Collect 1 Riverbeast Heart, 2 Swamplighter Venom, 4 Riotvine, and 3 Moonlit Herbs.

*[[Swamplighter Venom]] (2)
*[[Riotvine]] (4)
*[[Moonlit Herb]] (3)

==Description==
[[Gidwin Goldbraids|Gidwin]] was attacked by one of those plant creatures.

From the looks of it, he is suffering from some kind of paralysis.

I can make a cure, but I'll need some local ingredients.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
*13830 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the ingredients?

==Completion==
Bang-up job, <name>!  The base is just about ready.

==Notes==
On accept of both this and [[Swamplighter Queen (quest)]]:
:{{text|say|Fiona|Here, this herb's effects will put a spring in your step. Be careful, <name>.}}
Players are buffed with "Swiftstep: You feel lighter on your feet" for 5 minutes, increasing movement speed.

Head west first, to the north end of the area, killing [[Riot Blossom]]s and finishing off [[Twilight Riverbeast]]s. Enter the cave to the north to find the [[Swamplighter Queen]] and a whole bunch of Swamplighter wasps.

Exit the cave and head southeast to pick up [[Rotting Riverbeasts]]. South of the questgiver, the Infested Riverbeasts have [[Blooming Mandragora]] growing out of them. Moonlit Herbs are blue plants growing on or near rocks.

==Progression==
