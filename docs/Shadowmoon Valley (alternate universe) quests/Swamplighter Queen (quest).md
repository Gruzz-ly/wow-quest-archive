==Objectives==
Obtain The Swamplighter Queen's Tail for [[Fiona]] in {{Au|Shadowmoon Valley}}.
*[[Swamplighter Queen's Tail]] {{co|51.6|54.9|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
It looks like those plant creatures used some kind of poison when they attacked [[Gidwin Goldbraids|Gidwin]].

It's a powerful concoction to say the least.

If we are going to cure Gidwin we need one more special ingredient.  This one might be a bit harder to obtain than the others.

You up to the challenge, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 513 chestpieces|Karabor Skirmisher Vest|Karabor Honor Guard Chestplate|Rangari Initiate Vest|Karabor Sage Robe}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
*13830 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I just wanted to pick some herbs and relax with my boys... I should have stayed in Azeroth.

==Completion==
Wow, that was fast!  Ok, let's get to it!

==Notes==
On accept of both this and [[Fiona's Solution]]:
:{{text|say|Fiona|Here, this herb's effects will put a spring in your step. Be careful, <name>.}}
Players are buffed with "Swiftstep: You feel lighter on your feet" for 5 minutes, increasing movement speed.

Head west first, to the north end of the area, killing [[Riot Blossom]]s and finishing off [[Twilight Riverbeast]]s. Enter the cave to the north to find the [[Swamplighter Queen]] and a whole bunch of Swamplighter wasps.
