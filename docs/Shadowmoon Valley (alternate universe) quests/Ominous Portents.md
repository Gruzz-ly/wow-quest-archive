''On accept''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Be careful. The demon will try to trick you.}}

Walk up to the All-Seeing Eye:
:{{text|yell|All-Seeing Eye|Stay away from me with those things!}}
:I can see the emptiness in your soul, <name>. In the end, it will be I who compels you!
:{{gossip|Begin the compulsion of the All-Seeing Eye.}}
The vehicle UI pops up with two abilities:\#{{abilities|Vial of Moon Water|Douse the All-Seeing Eye with the blessed water of Elune, weakening its resolve.}}
#{{abilities|Scripture of Elune|Compel the All-Seeing Eye by reading from the scripture of Elune.}}

The game also pops up some hints:
:{{text|bossemote|Use the Vial of Moon Water to compel the All-Seeing Eye.}}
:{{text|bossemote|When the demon is weakened, read from the Scripture of Elune.}}

Start using the water:
*{{text|say|All-Seeing Eye|Lovely day for a compusion!}}
*{{text|say|All-Seeing Eye|I will eat your soul!}}
*{{text|say|All-Seeing Eye|Your ancestors will languish!}}
*{{text|say|All-Seeing Eye|I'll show you nothing!}}
*{{text|say|All-Seeing Eye|It burns!}}

After a few water douses, the Scripture of Elune button will light up. Use it:
*{{text|say|<Name>|Elune's radiance grant me strength!}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|Bask in... the light of Elune... and... reveal all, demon!}}
*{{text|say|<Name>|The power of Elune compels you!}}

After the scripture reading:
*{{text|yell|All-Seeing Eye|Blarggggrgggrggrrr!}}
*{{text|say|All-Seeing Eye|Ahahahahaha!}}
*{{text|say|All-Seeing Eye|I will eat your soul!}}

Repeat the process of hitting 1 a few times, then 2, until the All-Seeing Eye finally breaks.
:{{text|say|All-Seeing Eye|No more! I will turn my gaze upon Gul'var for you...}}
:''The camera tracks northwest to Gul'var. There, Gul'dan, Teron'gor, an image of Cho'gall, and Razuun are gathered:
:{{text|say|Gul'dan|Rise, old friends. The time has come for the next step of my plan.}}
:{{text|say|Gul'dan|Teron'gor, infiltrate the Auchenai and take control of {{Au|Auchindoun}}. Bleed them dry.}}
:{{text|say|Image of Teron'gor|It will be done, Lord Gul'dan.}}
:{{text|say|Gul'dan|Cho'gall, we'll finish your Frostfire business together.}}
:{{text|say|Gul'dan|I'm sending you to [[Nagrand]] to subjugate the [[naaru]] inside [[Oshu'gun]].}}
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|I will crush it! (The [[pale]] are the key.)}}
:{{text|say|Gul'dan|All I require is its limitless power.}}
:{{text|say|Gul'dan|Razuun, you stay here. I have other plans for... what is that?}}
:{{text|say|Gul'dan|Eye, what are you looking at?}}
:''Gul'dan winds up an attack as Cho'gall waves goodbye.''
:{{text|say|Gul'dan|It's all fun and games until...}}
:''The attack missile flies back to Starfall Outpost and kills the All-Seeing Eye as the player looks on in horror.''
