== Objectives ==
Build your garrison.
*Speak with Baros to build your garrison {{co|29.0|16.2|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

== Description ==
I'm impressed with how quickly you have pulled this group together, commander.

I think it's time we start putting up some walls and establishing a firm perimeter around our base.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|22|80}}
* 17110 XP
*[[Garrison Hearthstone]]

== Completion ==
The garrison is really starting to take shape.

==Notes==
''Accept:''
:{{text|say|Baros Alexston|Let me know when you are ready to start construction, commander.}}

''{{gossip|We have everything we need. It's time to build the garrison.}}''

A cutscene plays:
:'''Vindicator Maraad''': {{text|bossemote|Through your selfless actions you have earned the respect of my people. May have granted you this foothold confident that you will lead the Alliance to victory. Commander.}}
* ''The subtitle mistakenly says "{{text|bossemote|'''May''' have granted you}}". Maraad actually says "{{text|bossemote|They have granted you}}".

:''Your Tier 1 garrison, an outpost, has been built. Everyone has moved inside, while [[Bodrick Grey]] and [[Amber Kearnen]] have arrived at the meeting site and set up a tent. Speak with Alexston in the garrison.''

On complete:
:{{text|say|Baros Alexston|Thanks to you we have a terrific foothold here in Shadowmoon Valley.}}
