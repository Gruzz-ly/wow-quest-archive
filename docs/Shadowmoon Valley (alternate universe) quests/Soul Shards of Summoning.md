==Objectives==
Collect Kurgoth's Shard, Grogal's Shard, and Hagra's Shard.
*[[Hagra's Shard]] {{co|20.9|27.3|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*[[Grogal's Shard]] {{co|20.9|31.6|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*[[Kurgoth's Shard]] {{co|18.3|24.1|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
It's good to know what [[Teron'gor]] and {{Au|Cho'gall}} are up to. It's more important that we stop {{Au|Gul'dan}}.

Some of his disciples can summon minor demons. To do this, these lesser warlocks must use a soul shard. The foul crystal creates a connection to the [[Twisting Nether]], pulling a demon through against its will.

Gul'dan's as much demon as he is orc. If we can gather some of the more potent shards, we can combine them into something that just might capture him.

:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|She doesn't want me going with you. But, I can help by magically projecting myself.}}
:{{text|say|Cordana Felsong|You're right, you're not going out there!}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the shards, <name>?

==Completion==
Now all that's left to do is fashion them together into something strong enough to ensnare Gul'dan.

Luckily, we can do that right here.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Cleaning Up Gul'var]] before heading out.

Back to the west to the southern entrance of Gul'var. Find [[Grogal the Harvester]] by an altar at the south end of the quest area, [[Fel Mistress Hagra]] at an altar to the north, and [[Corruptor Kurgoth]] all the way to the north. Keep killing [[Shadow Warrior]]s, [[Gul'var Peon]]s, and [[Lesser Warlock]]s too. Turn in to the Image of Archmage Khadgar uphill to the northeast, near the forge.
