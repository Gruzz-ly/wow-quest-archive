[[File:Kral'za.jpg|thumb|Kral'za]]
[[File:Dark Apparition.jpg|thumb|Dark Apparition]]
Find [[Kral'za]].
*Find Kral'za
*[[Dol'mak]] slain
*[[Dark Apparition]] slain

==Description==
My son, Kral'za, is beyond stubborn.

After we split from the {{Au|Shadowmoon clan|Shadowmoon Clan]] he refused to let go of his relationship with a young Shadowmoon orc.

I forbid him to see her anymore. He ran off earlier today and has not returned.

I don't trust Dol'mak, like the other Shadowmoon orcs she continues to dabble in the void.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 525 trinkets|Kral'za's Resolve|Moonstone Luck Token|Dol'mak's Lucky Charm}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|12|60}}
*14100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
My son needs to learn to respect his elders.

==Completion==
Aka'Magosh, <class>. I knew that void witch was no good.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{text|say|Dulga|If you find Kral'za, and he is with that void witch Dol'mak, tell him his mother is looking for him.}}

Pick up [[Lunarblossom (quest)]] and [[Lurking in the Shadows]] before heading out.

Exit the rise and head east to the [[Umbrafen]] and follow the trail north. [[Lunarblossom]]s are marked on the minimap. [[Shadowmoon Disruptor]]s are near a bunch of [[Shadow Skeleton]]s, generally holding a Windreaver Stargazer by the neck. At the north end of the path, the path loops back south, entering the mouth of a cave. Inside [[Kral'za]] cowers before [[Dol'mak]], who shouts at him.

: {{text|yell|Dol'mak|FOOL!  If you won't respect Ner'zhul you will be sacrificed!}}

Kill [[Dol'mak]] to spawn the [[Dark Apparition]].
: {{text|say|Dol'mak|You cannot stop Ner'zhul. The power of the void will consume you!}}
After the Dark Apparition dies, Kral'za runs out in fear:
: {{text|yell|Kral'za|Mother was right; the Shadowmoon clan cannot be trusted!}}

[[File:Rai'vosh and Turog.jpg|thumb|Rai'vosh and Turog]]
Between the quest area and [[Windreaver's Rise]], look out for [[Rai'vosh]], a rare unbound air elemental, whom [[Windcaller Turog]] is trying to bind. Rai'vosh drops the [[Whispers of Rai'Vosh]] and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]].

;On complete
:{{text|say|Dulga|Thank you, <name>. Maybe next time my son will listen to his mother.}}
