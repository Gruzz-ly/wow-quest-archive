==Objectives==
Drink the Clarity Elixir and witness the fate of [[Karabor]].
*Drink the Clarity Elixir
*Witness the fate of Karabor
*[[Clarity Elixir]] (provided)

==Description==
Threads of the future weave together, winding and unwinding, creating tapestries that change in form and color from one moment to the next.

I must have clarity. I must focus on the ONE strand that will become reality.

When you are ready to share in my vision, drink the elixir.

When the vision begins, be on your guard.  The events of the vision are as deadly as anything we experience in this reality.

''On accept:''
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Drink the elixir and focus on the crystal, <name>. Let the ebb and flow of time wash over you...}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13,850 [[XP]]
* +250 with the {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
<The Prophet is deep in thought.  He looks troubled.>


A solo scenario, the Defense of Karabor, begins. As it can only be completed once, it is documented here.
===Stage 1: A Vision Revealed===
[[File:The Fate of Karabor - Yrel and Velen.jpg|thumb|Yrel and Velen]]
*Follow Prophet Velen {{co|79.8|46.6|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
Get close to Velen:
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|The Temple of Karabor? No... it cannot be. We are under attack!}}
:{{text|yell|Yrel|Hold the barricades! Protect the defense crystal at all costs!}}
:{{text|say|Yrel|We couldn't stop the [[K'ara (alternate universe)|Dark Star]], Prophet. The Iron Horde have taken the harbor!}}
:{{text|yell|Yrel|Watch your heads! Iron capsules incoming!}}

===Stage 2: Enemy Onslaught===
[[File:Krull.jpg|thumb|Krull]]
*Defeat Krull {{co|80.2|46.6|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
An elite dire orc, [[Krull]] drops from the sky and starts attacking. Help kill him alongside Velen and Yrel.

===Stage 3: Commander Vorka===
[[File:The Fate of Karabor - defense crystal destroyed.jpg|thumb|The defense crystal destroyed]]
*Witness Commander Vorka's arrival
:{{text|say|Yrel|Up there! The fleet commander shows himself!}}
: ''Commander Vorka flies up to confront the defenders on a [[rylak]].''
:{{text|yell|Commander Vorka|ENOUGH! Play time is over. Ships, on my mark, FIRE ON THE CRYSTAL!}}
:''The defense crystal is destroyed.''

===Final Stage: The Final Defense===
[[File:The Fate of Karabor - the fall.jpg|thumb|The fall]]
*Speak to Velen on the Karabor stairs {{co|79.2|46.6|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
:{{text|say|Yrel|No! That defense crystal was our only hope.}}
:{{text|say|Yrel|They're breaking through. Retreat! We'll make our final stand on the stairs!}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Stay close to me, champion!}}

Head back up the stairs and speak with Velen:
:The vision guides us, <name>. Let us see what it wishes us to learn.
''{{gossip|Prophet, we're being overrun!}}''
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|As long as I live, Karabor shall not fall!}}
: ''Velen blasts the area with a Light aoe, killing the attacking orcs, then throws up a shield over the landing.''
:{{text|yell|Commander Vorka|Prophet, your attempts are meaningless. Witness the TRUE might of the Iron Horde!}}
:''The Dark Star bombards the landing, killing everyone nigh-instantly.''
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|I cannot... hold them... back...}}
:''Velen falls. A massive wave of Iron Horde orcs storm the stairs as the scene fades to black.''

Back in the real world:
: ''The [[Oracle Stone]] cracks and breaks apart, falling into the pool.  The vision has left Velen horrified.  His tone then becomes deadly serious.''
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|No... NO! This cannot be the fate of my people!}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|{{Au|Ner'zhul}} leads us to this destiny. To save Karabor, we must stop him.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Meet me back at Twilight Glade, champion. We have much to do.}}
: ''Velen runs off down the path.''

==Completion==
I have seen enough. Ner'zhul must be stopped.

==Notes==
Before heading back to [[Twilight Glade]], head behind the tree to the northwest. On the far shore is a [[Giant Moonwillow Cone]], which contains the [[Moonwillow Wand]].

Pick up [[Going Undercover]] to continue the chain.

On completion of both this quest and [[Escape From Shaz'gul]], [[Scout Valdez]] flies in:
:{{text|say|Scout Valdez|Commander! Shadowmoon forces are gathering up outside of the garrison. Our troops are in defensive positions and await your orders.}}

==Progression==
{{A Sister's Sacrifice}}

==Patch changes==
