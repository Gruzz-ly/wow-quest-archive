==Objectives==

[[File:Shadow Council Tome of Curses.jpg|thumb|Shadow Council Tome of Curses]]
Follow {{Au|Exarch Maladaar|Maladaar}}'s trail to verify that [[Elodor]] has been infiltrated.
*Discover the Infiltrator's Hideout

==Description==
Nothing is the same since I returned. There is always whispering - everywhere, whispering. [[Vindicator Maraad|Maraad]] cannot see it, but there are even traces of fel energy here in Elodor. We have been infiltrated!

I must attend to the Exarch Council, but I need you to investigate. Follow the traces of fel energy that I will illuminate. If there are truly traitors in our midst, they will have to have some sort of hideout. Find it! I will wait for you with the other Exarchs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|8|90}}
*10350 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Completion==
A flesh-bound book lies on an unholy altar. Your skin crawls. Maladaar was right!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|Follow the trail. Find our hidden foe.}}
The ground lights up a trail, so follow it. It passes through the city center, taking a right towards the [[Altar of Sha'tar]] before entering a cave.
:{{text|say|Sha'tari Honor Guard|Where are you going, <class>?}}
In the cave is a [[Sister of Secrets]] guarding a Blood-Caked Altar with a [[Shadow Council Tome of Curses]] on it.
:{{text|say|Sister of Secrets|Naughty thing, you shouldn't be here...}}
Take her out and interact with the tome.

Formerly, the Sister would speak when the tome was interacted with:
:{{text|say|Sister of Secrets|You're too late, you poor thing.}}
