[[File:Poison Paralysis - Talren.jpg|thumb|Talren]]
Rescue the missing travelers.
*Cure [[Rimblat Earthshatter|Rimblat]] {{co|55.1|68.2|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*Cure [[Argus Highbeacon|Argus]] {{co|56.8|70.4|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*Cure [[Talren Highbeacon|Talren]] {{co|54.1|70.8|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
There are others from the caravan that have gone missing.

My guess is they have been taken into [[Blademoon Bloom]] by the [[botani]].

You have to rescue them, <name>. You are our only hope.

Here, take some of this elixir I just made, chances are you will need it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*13700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find the others?

==Completion==
I can never repay you for all you have done here today, <name>.

I am truly in your debt.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Fiona|Please let me know if there is anything I can do to repay you.}}

==Notes==
Pick up [[Botani Beatdown]], [[Blademoon Bloom (quest)]], and [[Forever Young]] before heading out.

On the way to Blademoon Bloom, find a [[Sleepy Rangari]] on the east bank. She offers [[Slumberbloom (quest)]]. The red slumberblooms all over the area to the south. It may be easier to create a <code>/tar Slumber</code> macro and turn on target tracking on the minimap.

Further south, in the [[Blademoon Bloom]], find rare mandragora [[Venomshade]], which drops the [[Venomshade Skin Boots]] and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]].

All of the named NPCs and Youngroot nodes are marked on the minimap in [[Blademoon Bloom]]. The botani spawn in trees, and Arepheon is at the south end of the area. Find Arepheon and pick up his next quest, [[Gestating Genesaur]], before heading back to the caravan.

After completing Gestating Genesaur, Fiona offers one last quest, [[Fiona (quest)]].

==Progression==
{{Purifying the Gene Pool}}
