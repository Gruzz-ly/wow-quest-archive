== Objectives ==
[[File:Warning the Exarchs - Hataaru slain.jpg|thumb|[[Exarch Hataaru (alternate universe)|Exarch Hataaru]] slain]]
Talk to [[Exarch Maladaar (alternate universe)|Exarch Maladaar]] at the [[Altar of Sha'tar (alternate universe)|Altar of Sha'tar]] in {{Au|Shadowmoon Valley}}.

== Description ==
You set the book ablaze, but not before noting its contents. The demonic tome was dedicated to enchanting weapons with fel energy. It looked as though the goal was to ensnare the victim's soul.

The Exarchs must be warned that traitors are among them! The Council should be meeting now just up the hill to the east.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|18}}
* 1400 XP
* +250 {{Au|Council of Exarchs}} reputation 

== Completion ==
Dead! Exarch Hataaru is dead! His body was discovered moments ago, stabbed in the back. The weapon that killed him was fel in origin. Tell me everything you know.

<Maladaar nods as you describe what you found.>

Yes. The traitors wanted to capture Hataaru's soul. Someone wants something he knows, dead or alive... We must act at once.

==Notes==
Step outside and run up the stairs. [[Exarch Hataaru (alternate universe)|Exarch Hataaru]] has been killed by a fel-corrupted dagger in his back:
:{{text|say|Exarch Akama|This is how he was found. Murdered!}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Othaar|Exarch Naielle, weren't you overheard arguing with Hataaru earlier?}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Naielle|We ALWAYS argue. That doesn't mean I killed him!}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|The weapon is tainted with fel energy.}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Othaar|You seem to know an awful lot about the tools of our enemy.}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Maladaar|It is my duty to know. Allow me to speak with the body.}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Akama|I forbid it! He has suffered enough!}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Othaar|I agree. Stand down, Exarch. Enough damage has been done.}}

==Progression==
