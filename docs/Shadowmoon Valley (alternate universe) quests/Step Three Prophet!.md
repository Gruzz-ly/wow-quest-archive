The title of this quest is a reference to the phrase "step three: profit" (or any humorous plan where the second-to-last step is missing and the last step is "profit"). That, in turn, originated with the Underpants Gnomes in the animated series ''[[wikipedia:South Park|South Park]]'', whose business plan was: "Phase 1: Collect underpants. Phase 2: ? Phase 3: Profit".

==Progression==
{{Establishing a Foothold}}
