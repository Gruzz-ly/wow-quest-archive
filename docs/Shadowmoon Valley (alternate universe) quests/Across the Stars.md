==Objectives==
Collect 5 Star Readings.
*[[Star Reading]] (5)

==Description==
A key source of the Shadowmoon clan's power comes from their understanding of the stars and their omens.

For centuries, they have recorded the patterns of the stars and their interpretations.

While you are in the fortress, collect some of these documents for me.

We will take their own knowledge and use it against them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
*13850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Your aid is appreciated, <class>.

==Completion==
Thank you. My acolytes will study these in great detail. With any luck, we will use this knowledge to defeat the Shadowmoon.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Into Anguish]], [[On the Offensive]], [[Harbingers of the Void]], and [[The Great Salvation]] before heading in.

Plenty of star charts all over the area.

==Progression==
{{A Sister's Sacrifice}}
