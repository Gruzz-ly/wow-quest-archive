==Objectives==
Kill 8 Shadowmoon Voidmancers.
*[[Shadowmoon Voidmancer]] slain (8)

==Description==
Your arrival should be cause for celebration, hero, but I fear our troubles are just beginning.

Warlord {{Au|Ner'zhul}} and his {{Au|Shadowmoon clan}} have launched a surprise attack on a draenei settlement to the north.

{{Au|Velen|Prophet Velen}} has gone to aid the wounded at [[Teluuna Observatory]], but we need more defenders.

I must go to assist the others. If you wish to help us, go to [[Arbor Glen]] and kill any Shadowmoon enemies that you see.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 517 necks|Rangari Luck Charm|Karabor Sage Pendant|Karabor Guardian Gorget}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
*13850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Is the Arbor safe?

==Completion==
The forests are clear of Shadowmoon enemies? Good. I knew that you would not fall.

==Notes==
''Accept:''
: ''Samaara stands and leaps aboard [[Raindash]], flying off to the northeast.''

Before getting too far away, pick up [[Think of the Children!]] from [[Efee]] and [[Closing the Door]] from [[Vindicator Tenuum]].

Don't worry about killing voidmancers specifically - the other quests will send players through enough of them while killing portalmasters and finding the kids.

==Trivia==
Formerly on acceptance, Samaara would say:

{{text|say|Samaara|Hurry, Yrel. Your hammer's might will help us greatly.}}

==Progression==
{{Shadows Awaken}}
