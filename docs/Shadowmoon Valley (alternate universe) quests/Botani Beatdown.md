== Objectives ==
Kill 5 [[Botani]].
* Blademoon Botani slain (5)

== Description ==
[[Gidwin Goldbraids|Gidwin]] is doing much better.  Thank you, <name>.

I can't believe the [[draenei]] have lived alongside those horrible monsters for so long.

Maybe we should show these beasts what happens when you mess with an Azerothian.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13,690 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
How many did you kill?

== Completion ==
That's what I'm talking about!  Great work out there, <name>.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Tarenar Sunstrike|Kill them.  Kill them all.}}

Pick up [[Poison Paralysis]], [[Blademoon Bloom (quest)]], and [[Forever Young]] before heading out.

On the way to Blademoon Bloom, find a [[Sleepy Rangari]] on the east bank. She offers [[Slumberbloom (quest)]]. The red slumberblooms all over the area to the south. It may be easier to create a <code>/tar Slumber</code> macro and turn on target tracking on the minimap.

Further south, in the [[Blademoon Bloom]], find rare mandragora [[Venomshade]], which drops the [[Venomshade Skin Boots]] and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]].

All of the named NPCs and Youngroot nodes are marked on the minimap in [[Blademoon Bloom]].  [[Blademoon Botani]] and [[Botani Bloomkeeper]]s are the mobs you're looking for.  The botani spawn in trees, and Arepheon is at the south end of the area. Find Arepheon and pick up his next quest, [[Gestating Genesaur]], before heading back to the caravan.
