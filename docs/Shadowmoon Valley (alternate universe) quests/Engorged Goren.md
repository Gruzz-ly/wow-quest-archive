==Objectives==
[[File:Crystalmaw Spitter.jpg|thumb|Crystalmaw Spitter]]
Collect 20 Crystallized Goren Scales from Crystalmaw goren in the [[Elodor Dig]].
*[[Crystallized Goren Scale]] (20)

==Description==
You must be the <class> that so impressed {{Au|Exarch Hataaru}}. Can you help?

The Elodor Dig just behind me is overrun by strange stone creatures. These so-called [[goren]] actually devour minerals, metabolize them, and grow crystalline structures from their arms and back. Like most of the wildlife on this world, they completely baffle us.

Please slay as many as you can and gather their crystal scales for me. You'll be protecting our earthworkers and aiding our research at the same time.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 513 rings|Rangari Initiate Ring|Karabor Sage Signet|Karabor Honor Guard Seal}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
*13850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
What's the status inside the dig?

==Completion==
<The artificer withdraws a loop and peers intently at the scales you've brought him.>

Unreal. The crystalline matrix is flawless, as if produced from one of our forges on Argus.

I wish we could hook up these creatures to our machinery... but I suspect the Exarch would take issue with that.

Thank you for your help!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Shut 'er Down]] from {{Au|Exarch Hataaru}} before heading in.

Kill anything that moves. In the back of the cave, look for the [[Malfunctioning Resonance Crystal]] in the back of the mine. Behind the crystal is an Override Lever.
