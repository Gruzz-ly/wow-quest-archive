*[[Arkeddon]] slain {{co|31.0|43.9|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
<Prophet Velen's voice continues.>

Yrel and I have located Warlord Ner'zhul. He is meeting with {{Au|Grommash Hellscream}} atop the highest altar overlooking [[Anguish Fortress]].

Meet us there. We must stop him.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 517 shoulders|Rangari Initiate Spaulders|Karabor Skirmisher Spaulders|Karabor Honor Guard Shoulders|Karabor Sage Mantle}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|23|60}}
*17300 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Ner'zhul will pay for what he has done.

==Completion==
We saved everyone we could, <name>. We were too late for the others... including my sister.

Prophet Velen is right. When it is asked of us, we ALL must fight. I promise this: I will never again let my loved ones suffer.

Ner'zhul is close to calling down the Dark Star. We are the only ones who can stop him.

==Notes==

After automatically accepting this quest, head due south through the rock formation where the Mark of Darkness was, find the path that leads up the hill to the [[Terrace of the Stars]], and meet Yrel on the path not far from the top of the area:
:{{text|say|Yrel|Are you ready, hero? It's just up this way.}}

Follow her to just outside the stone circle, to find Velen hiding behind a bush:
:{{text|say|Yrel|Over here, hero, before they see us! Listen - they're talking about the Dark Star.}}
:{{text|say|Ner'zhul|Behold my power, Warchief Hellscream. With my clan at your side, you will be unstoppable.}}
: ''Arkeddon spawns in the center.''
:{{text|yell|Arkeddon|The void... HUNGERS!}}
: ''A demon portal opens behind the orcs.''
:{{text|say|Grommash Hellscream|Well done, Ner'zhul. We attack Karabor soon. Summon forth the Dark Star.}}
:{{text|say|Ner'zhul|I will begin my preparations at once.}}
: ''They run over and leave through the portal.''
:{{text|say|Yrel|What is that monstrosity?}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|It is but a fraction of the Dark Star's power.}}
: ''Yrel runs forth to attack.''
:{{text|say|Yrel|We'll see about that!}}
Take it out.

: ''Yrel looks to the altar: her big sister is laying on top of it. She is dying.''
:{{text|say|Yrel|Samaara!}}
: ''Yrel runs to her sister, but it's too late to help her and they both know it.
:{{text|say|Yrel|No.  No!!!!!}}
: ''She kneels in front of the altar, sobbing.''
: ''Samaara is weak and fading, but speaks with love and encouragement.''
:{{text|say|Samaara|Yrel, do not be sad. I did not choose this fate, but you... you can still choose.}}
:{{text|say|Samaara|Be strong, little one. I... I will be watching over you.}}
: ''Samaara breaths her last and dies. Her spirit appears and rises up, disappearing into a sparkle of light.''
:{{text|say|Yrel|Samaara, I swear to you, I will become strong. I will protect our people. I. Will. Fight!}}
: ''Yrel stands, angry, but controlled and determined.''
:{{text|say|Yrel|Come, champion. I will need your help to crush this "Iron Horde."}}
:''Yrel and Velen run down the hill path to the northeast, back toward [[Embaari Village]].''

Don't forget to do the other quests in the area before heading back. The [[Shadowmoon Sacrificial Dagger]] is found atop the stairs in the Terrace of the Stars.

Back at Embaari:
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|The Iron Horde fleet has been sighted off the coast. We're calling every defender to the Temple.}}
:{{text|say|Yrel|But Ner'zhul poses an equal threat. What should we do, Prophet?}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Champion, I need your help to stop the Dark Star's arrival. Maraad, can you hold Karabor until we are finished?}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|As long as the defense crystal stands, we will hold.}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|Commander, I will gather the troops from your garrison. Do not delay long, they will need your leadership on the battlefield.}}

;Unused quotes
:Samaara: It is too late, Yrel. I did not choose this fate, but you... you can still choose.
:Samaara: Be brave, little one. I... I will be watching over you.
