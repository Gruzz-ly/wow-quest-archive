Speak to [[Sylene]] at [[Twilight Glade]] to gain an orc illusion, then plant explosives at key locations in [[Shaz'gul]].

If you lose your disguise, use Sylene's Amulet of Illusion to regain an orc appearance.
*Obtain orc disguise from Sylene {{co|40.7|54.6|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*Explosives planted at supply hut {{co|37.2|59.2|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*Explosives planted at main lodge {{co|36.3|61.4|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*Explosives planted at the chieftain's seat {{co|39.1|62.9|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

*[[Sylene's Amulet of Illusion]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Yrel]] leads my [[ranger]]s on a search for the prisoners at the Shadowmoon village.

Their work is extremely dangerous, so I need you to carry out a contingency mission.

Sylene has mastered an illusion spell which will allow you to infiltrate Shaz'gul safely. Speak to her to disguise yourself.

Then, plant explosives at the quartermaster's depot, the main lodge, and the ritual altar.

In case anything goes wrong, set them off to create a distraction.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|60}}
* 17300 XP
* +250 {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Shaz'gul is well guarded, so finding the prisoners is a challenge.  Be careful.

* The illusion should hold until your work is done.

==Completion==
You made it, <name>! Boy, am I glad to see you.

==Notes==
Before getting started on this quest, pick up and complete [[The Clarity Elixir]], [[Loola's Lost Love]], and [[A Grandmother's Remedy]] in the Nightmarsh, and pick up and complete [[The Fate of Karabor]]. Find Sylene just to the northeast.

{{dialogue|Magic is fickle, however!

Take my Amulet of Illusion.  If you lose your orc appearance while at Shaz'gul, simply use the amulet.

Be careful of the wolves that patrol Shaz'gul. Unlike eyes, their noses will not be fooled.

{{gossip|I need a Shadowmoon orc illusion.}}

Head west into [[Shaz'gul]] and look for the buildings marked on the minimap. Steer clear of the [[Void Wolf|void wolves]]! Talk to all of the now-friendly orcs, as nearly all of them have some interesting gossip text.

[[File:Iron Horde Tribute.jpg|thumb|Iron Horde Tribute]]
In the Supply Hut, loot the [[Iron Horde Tribute]] for the [[Tiny Iron Star]] and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]]. Plant the bomb on the left side of the room near some crates. Head south to the main lodge and plant the bombs on the right stairs (from the perspective of the front door). Head east to the chieftain's seat and plant the bombs behind the big rock. Head south to the training pit and place the bomb behind the pike rack.

Finally, head west-northwest past the pond to find Yrel hiding in a bush.
