Commander, we must expand our fleet if we hope to stand a chance against the [[Iron Horde]].

* [[Rush Order: Shipyard]]

== Progress ==
: {{text|say|Vindicator Krethos|Commander, over here!  I have the plans you are looking for.}}

: I can supply you with the battleship plans you need, but first, you need to prove your worth to the Hand of the Prophet here in Tanaan Jungle.

Any luck with those battleship plans?
