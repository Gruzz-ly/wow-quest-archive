== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Rulkan (alternate universe)|Rulkan]] at [[Exile's Rise]].

==Description==
Not all of the Shadowmoon orcs followed {{Au|Ner'zhul}}'s alliance with the [[Iron Horde]].

Among them, there is one orc whom I befriended many years ago. She may be able to tell us more about Ner'zhul's plans for this "Dark Star."

She can be found at Exile's Rise to the northeast. I will send word ahead so she expects your arrival.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|90}}
* 6900 XP

==Completion==
I felt that this day would come. The draenei prophet is not wrong to seek me, traveler.

Though we do not speak often, he and I have a deep mutual respect for one another.

I know the trouble that his people are suffering, and I no longer believe the Shadowmoon are following our ancestor's path.

For those reasons, I will help you.

==Notes==
Before heading out, [[Scout Valdez]] offers a side quest involving the garrison: [[On Our Guard]]. Do it or not, then north to [[Exile's Rise]], just east of Lunarfall. There is a flight path at Exile's Rise.

''On approach:''
:{{text|say|[[Hara Bloodfury]]|Halt right there.}}
:{{text|say|Rulkan|Stay your weapons.  This must be the messenger the draenei prophet promised.}}

''On complete:''
:{{text|say|Rulkan|Welcome to my fire, traveler. I know much of Ner'zhul, and yet these days, I know him not at all.}}

At Exile's Rise, there are a few side quests available: [[Forbidden Love]], [[Lunarblossom (quest)]], and [[Lurking in the Shadows]]. She also has some gossip text:
:Our people have always drawn their magic from the earth and the moon.
:Nearly three centuries ago, the ancestors sensed a dark magic. A dark source.
:This was magic of shadows. It corrupted the mind, tainting those who used it, driving them mad.
:Since then, our clan was forbidden to use these shadows.
{{gossip|''Who are you?''}}
:I am Rulkan, daughter of [[Neema (orc)|Neema]]. I was an elder of the Shadowmoon clan, but am not of the clan any longer.
:Ner'zhul is my husband, but we have parted ways. He took his followers in one direction, and I took mine in another.
