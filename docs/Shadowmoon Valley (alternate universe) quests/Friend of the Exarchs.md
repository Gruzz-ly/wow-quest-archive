[[File:Apprentice Artificer Andren.jpg|thumb|Apprentice Artificer Andren]]
[[File:Rangari Chel.jpg|thumb|Rangari Chel]]
[[File:Vindicator Onaala.jpg|thumb|Vindicator Onaala]]

Choose a follower (either [[Apprentice Artificer Andren|Andren]], [[Rangari Chel|Chel]], or [[Vindicator Onaala|Onaala]]) and then speak with [[Exarch Naielle (alternate universe)|Exarch Naielle]].
*Choose a Follower

== Description ==
Only three members remain of the {{Au|Council of Exarchs|Exarch Council}}, but we are all deeply indebted to you. The vote is unanimous: Your [[Alliance]] will have our full support on {{Au|Draenor}}.

We are also going to place a draenei representative under your direct command. Three potential candidates are here in the courtyard. Speak to them and choose who you want - we will dispatch him or her immediately to your garrison!

== Rewards ==
You will gain the follower: Follower: [[Rangari Chel]] or Follower: [[Apprentice Artificer Andren]] or Follower: [[Vindicator Onaala]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|18}}
* 1400 XP
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Progress ==
You are you going to pick, <name>?

== Completion ==
An excellent choice! We'll send your pick directly to your garrison to help with any missions you encounter.

Now, about those supplies you requested...

==Notes and trivia==
*Two of the three possible followers have counterparts in the main timeline: [[Artificer Andren]] in [[The Exodar]] and [[Exarch Onaala]] in the [[Outland]] version of [[Shadowmoon Valley]]. Rangari Chel, however, is only found in the alternate timeline.
*"I choose you!" is a reference to the [[Wikipedia:Pokémon|Pokémon]] franchise.
*It will be possible to purchase the contracts of the other two once your garrison reaches Tier 3 if you so wish.  You could also use a shortcut of visiting another player's Tier 3 garrison right away and buy them there.

Check with each one in turn:
*Rangari Chel: ''Rangari Chel reporting for duty.''
:Greetings, commander! My name is Rangari Chel.
:When we first arrived on Draenor, this whole world was a mystery - a dangerous mystery.  The {{Au|rangari}} were tasked with exploring all these new, hostile environments.  We learned to survive on our feet - using the natural resources of the land around us to survive and slip unseen in and out of enemy territory.
:As your follower, I'd focus on staying out of sight, keeping foes at bay, and doing serious damage.
*Apprentice Artificer Andren: ''Someday I hope to drop the "Apprentice" title.''
:Commander!
:I am Apprentice Artificer Andren. Before [[Exarch Hataaru (alternate universe)|Hataaru]] was murdered I was one of his most trusted assistants. As an [[Artificer]] I use draenei technology to disable foes long enough for me or someone else to crush them. I suppose among your people I'd be considered a ... [[warrior]] [[engineer]]?
:I will do my best to serve your interests if you choose me as a follower.
*Vindicator Onaala: ''Vindicator Onaala, ready for orders.''
:Commander, it is a pleasure to meet you.
:When I was young, I trained hard to become an [[anchorite]] in the priesthood, but the [[Light]] walks us down mysterious paths.  My defensive spells were so powerful that [[Velen (alternate universe)|the Prophet]] himself encouraged me to train with the [[Vindicators]].
:These days, I am not afraid to stand toe-to-toe with our enemies, protecting those behind me.  Choose me as your follower and my faith will be your shield, my armor a bulwark protecting your garrison from our many enemies.

: ''Are you sure this is the follower you want?''
