==Description==
Stranger, please help me!

My companions and I were hunting near [[Bloodthorn Hill]] when we set up camp for the night.

We shared a dinner of freshly harvested mushrooms before falling asleep.

When I awoke, I was here. I don't know where my friends have gone, but I heard screams from further down the cavern.

Please, find my companions! I won't leave here without them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13850 XP
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Completion==
My prayers have been answered, hero. I will tell everyone back at the village of your deeds.

==Notes and trivia==
Pick up this quest while in the [[Bloodthorn Cave]] on the bonus objective [[Bloodthorn Cave (bonus objective)]].

Diaani is just southeast of the questgiver. Look near her inside the ribcage of some dead beast for the [[Rotting Basket]], worth some [[Garrison Resources]]. Arekk is on the west side of the cave, not far from rare pale [[Gorum]], who drops the [[Precious Bloodthorn Loop]] and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]].

During the beta, this quest would be followed up by [[Roona (quest)]].

==Progression==
