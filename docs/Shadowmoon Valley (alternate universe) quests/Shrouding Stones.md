== Objectives ==
Destroy the Central, Northern, and Southern Shrouding Stones.
*Central Shrouding Stone destroyed {{co|23.0|24.6|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*Northern Shrouding Stone destroyed {{co|25.9|15.9|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*Southern Shrouding Stone destroyed {{co|23.8|28.7|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

== Description ==
Long ago, the shaman of the Shadowmoon clan erected three stones in the woods. There, they performed their sacred rituals, blessing the beasts and the trees.

Now, someone has placed a fel magic upon those stones. This corruption is what shrouds the village of [[Gul'var]].

Before we can use the captured demon to safely peer into the Shadow Council's village, we must bring down those stones.

''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Be wary... I suspect the stones will be heavily-guarded.}}

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|13}}

== Progress ==
Once the shrouding stones are destroyed, we'll turn out attention to breaking this demon's will.

== Completion ==
Now that the veil has been lifted from the woods, we can make use of the demon.

We will convince it to turn its eye upon Gul'var and show us what the Shadow Council is planning.

== Gains ==
* 14250 XP

== Notes ==
Turn in [[Shadowmoonwell]] and pick up [[A Curse Upon the Woods]] before heading out.

Exit Starfall to the southwest, killing fel-cursed wolves and toads along the way. The south and central shrouding stones are relative close together, but the northernstone is a good distance away to the north in a small valley.
