==Description==
Posted by: [[Eremor]]

A ferocious [[elekk]] of unprecedented size has been seen near [[Gloomshade Grove]].

Known to some as the ivory death, she is abnormally aggressive and has already taken the lives of several unwary travelers.

The rangari have as yet been unable to corner this creature. Anyone capable of taking down this beast should exchange proof of her demise to Eremor for a hefty bounty.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|60}}
*17300 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}
*100x [[Garrison Resources]]

==Progress==
Are you here for the boutny on Kuu'rat?

==Completion==
The ivory death is slain? Impressive, traveler.

Thanks to you, we are all safer with Kuu'rat gone. I will share news of this deed with the other villagers.

==Notes==
Kuu'rat is actually just outside [[Lunarfall]] in the [[Drybone Hollow]] to the southeast. Use the Call to Arms ability to help!
