== Objectives ==
[[File:Shadowmoon Raider.jpg|thumb|Shadowmoon Raider]]
[[File:Shadowmoon Dark Priestess.jpg|thumb|Shadowmoon Dark Priestess]]

Kill 8 [[Shadowmoon Raider]]s or [[Shadowmoon Dark Priestess|Dark Priestesses]].
*Shadowmoon Invaders Slain (8)

== Description ==
No sooner does power rush to the crystal outside than you hear distant warcries and shouts of alarm. [[Elodor]] is being attacked!

If you want your laborers to come home in one piece, you'd best help with the defense of the town. Defeat the invasion and then return to the control console to reset the defenses.

''Accept:''
:{{text|say|[[Exarch Hataaru (alternate universe)|Exarch Hataaru]]|Come quickly! The Shadowmoon attack!}}

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13850 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Progress ==
The sounds of attack still reverberate from outside, which is alarming, given that the console seems awash with angrily blinking warning indicators.

== Completion ==
You saved the town! The controls shut down as you approach, but many of the indicators are still blinking frantically. Something seems wrong.

Hataaru yells out to get your attention outside...

==Notes==
During the quest:
*{{text|say|Exarch Hataaru|It's working! It's... not stable. But it's working.}}
*{{text|say|Exarch Hataaru|This new structure is able to tap into a surprising amount of power.}}
*{{text|say|Exarch Hataaru|Defend the ward at all costs!}}
*{{text|say|Exarch Hataaru|Keep the Shadowmoon at bay. What is causing this madness?}}
*{{text|say|Exarch Hataaru|Defend the ridgeline. Let them come to us.}}
*{{text|say|Exarch Hataaru|Keep them engaged. The defense ward is drawing so much power - I can't maintain it for long.}}

Objective completed:
:{{text|say|Shadowmoon Dark Zealot|Pull back! We must find [[Ner'zhul (alternate universe)|Ner'zhul]] his sacrifices elsewhere.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Exarch Hataaru|Stop that thing! Bring it down!}}
:''An [[Enraged Fungal Giant]] is attacking the crystal.''
: ''[[Exarch Naielle (alternate universe)|Exarch Naielle]] runs over from the road.''
:{{text|say|Exarch Naielle|What is going on here? The entire mushroom forest is riled up.}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Hataaru|Stay in your swamp, {{Au|Rangari}}. I will handle this.}}
: ''The peacekeepers are killing the giant, but feel free to give them a hand.  Hataaru walks over to Naielle.''
:{{text|say|Exarch Naielle|Did you sink resonance crystals into the ground again?  You're driving the creatures of the earth berserk!}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Naielle|When will you learn that this world is nothing like [[Argus]]?}}
