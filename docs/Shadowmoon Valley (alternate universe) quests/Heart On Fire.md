==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Krosnis.jpg|Krosnis|Slay the infernal and take its fiery heart.}}
Collect the Fiery Heart from [[Krosnis]].
*[[Fiery Heart]] {{co|17.7|27.5|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
We have the shards, but now they must be combined. There's a forge here, but even its fires aren't hot enough for our purposes.

However, there is a demon nearby that burns hot as the sun.

{{Au|Gul'dan}}, or perhaps [[Razuun]], has managed to summon an [[infernal]]. The thing calls itself Krosnis, which means "furnace."

The demon's heart burns hotly enough. All you need do is collect it.

{{text|emote|The archmage gestures toward the forge and awaits your return with the fiery heart of Krosnis.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|26}}
*17800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
With the combined might of the shards, we should be able to trap Gul'dan.

==Completion==
Quickly, place the heart in the forge. We'll use its infernal heat to forge the trap.

==Notes==
At the base of the cliff to the northwest.
