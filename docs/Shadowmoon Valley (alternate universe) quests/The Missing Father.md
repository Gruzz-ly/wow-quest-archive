==Objectives==
Find [[Telos]] in the [[Verdant Mire]].

==Description==
I would be happy to help with your alchemical inquiries, but right now I am worried about my father.

It's been quite some time since he went hunting down by the river, but he still hasn't returned home.  I need to watch [[Lumiel]].  Will you please find him?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|14}}
*1350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you, stranger. I don't think the [[Razorfang Hunter|razorfangs]] were happy that I was hunting the same prey.

==Notes==
Southwest into the mire.
