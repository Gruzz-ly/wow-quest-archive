==Objectives==
Take revenge on the podlings.
*[[Podling]]s slain (15)

==Description==
The blood-soaked body of [[Ryan Metcalf (NPC)|Ryan]] is slumped up against the cave wall. Tiny teeth marks cover his body.

The podlings clearly are a threat to you and [[Lunarfall|your garrison]].

It's time to do a little pruning.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|60}}
*17300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<You've drastically reduced the podling numbers.

Hopefully they won't be growing back anytime soon.>

==Notes==
Pick up [[Game of Thorns]] before exiting the cave. All podlings are hostile now, so watch out! Also, keep an eye out for a [[Captured Critter]], which starts the quest [[Captured Critters]]. Kill a path to the west-southwest, noting the rare [[Leaf-Reader Kurri]] on a northwestern island, which drops the [[Mushroom of Destiny]] and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]].
