==Objectives==
[[File:Corrupted Toad.jpg|thumb|Corrupted Toad]]
Kill 10 fel-cursed creatures in the [[Cursed Woods]].
*Fel-cursed creature killed (10)

==Description==
[[Cordana Felsong|Cordana]] tells me that the creatures of the woods are cursed by the same fel energies keeping [[Khadgar]] from scrying into [[Gul'var|the orc village]].

This will not do.

If we were on [[Azeroth]], I could find a cure in a reasonable timeframe. However, we are not, nor do we have the luxury of time.

Better to put a swift end to their suffering rather than allow these poor creatures to linger with demonic energy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*25x [[Garrison Resources]]
*{{cost|11|80}}
*13850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I know it may seem harsh, and I'll understand if you decide not to do it.

However, the sooner you kill those poor creatures, the sooner their suffering will come to an end.

==Completion==
Grim business. I wish that it could have gone differently.

Thank you for your dedication, <name>. Be comforted in the knowledge that [[Elune]] understands.

==Notes==
Enter the Cursed Woods back to the west and start killing [[Corrupted Toad|corrupted toads]] and [[Cursed Wolf|cursed wolves]].

On accept:
:{{text|say|Delas Moonfang|Please be swift and merciful. Those creatures are the true victims here.}}

During the alpha, the quest was named '''A Taint Upon the Woods''' and required 15 enemies.
