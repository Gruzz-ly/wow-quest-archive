[[File:Shadowmoon Voidspeaker.jpg|thumb|[[Shadowmoon Voidspeaker]].]]
Find Maraad and the lost laborers and escort them back to Elodor Fields.
*Locate the Missing Wagon {{co|51.3|28.5|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*Defend the Camp {{co|51.3|28.5|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*Escort the Laborers {{co|55.4|33.2|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
One of our wagons fell behind, and disappeared somewhere in the woods to the northwest. [[Vindicator Maraad]] and several of your workers are stranded out there.

Find them and bring them back!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 512 boots|Moonchain Boots|Moonsole Slippers|Lunarlight Plate Stompers|Lunartanned Boots}}

You will also receive:
*50x [[Garrison Resources]] and {{cost|11|80}}
*13850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find them?  Check the woods to the northwest.  If I know Maraad, he probably tried to take the shelter of a hill.

==Completion==
I am keeping the sickles. They remind me of a lesson so many of us draenei forget - that the Light lives in every farmer as much as in any priest.

You fight well, and I am pleased to call you friend. Your laborers will be safe here in Elodor. If you are not convinced, speak to [[Exarch Hataaru (alternate universe)|Exarch Hataaru]] here. His devices secure all the draenei strongholds.

==Notes==
The group is holed up at an area in [[Saraah's Vale]].

On accept:
:{{text|say|Exarch Akama|Search to the northwest.  I will be right behind you.}}

Head northwest to find the wagon:
: ''Akama spawns and runs up from behind.''
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|It was an ambush - Shadowmoon orcs. They are circling back for the kill.}}
:{{text|say|Garrison Laborer|We can't fight them. We're just farmers! We don't even have weapons!}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Akama|Such little faith. Give me your sickle. Watch what is possible with the light.}}
: ''As Maraad runs to the other two laborers to give them directions, Akama walks over to the spilled supplies on the ground and retrieves two sickles, arming himself.''

Three [[Shadowmoon Raider]]s attack. Take them out.
: ''Akama leaps on top of the fallen wagon.''
:{{text|say|Exarch Akama|Go now. I will cover the rear.}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|This way, commander!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Follow Maraad}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|Such a joy to see Exarch Akama in action.}}

: ''The NPCs stop.''
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|Look out - here they come.}}
Another ambush.
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|This way. I remember these hills well.}}

: ''The NPCs stop.''
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|Another attack. They must think us an easy target. Hah!}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|We are almost there.}}
: ''The group passes through the entrance of the fields.''
:{{text|say|Exarch Akama|You made it.}}
: ''Maraad walks up to Akama while the laborers report to Zipfizzle.''
:{{text|say|Foreman Zipfizzle|There you are. Now get to work, you slackers!}}
: ''The laborers hurry off to the fields.''

On complete:
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|Exarch Akama, these attacks are just the beginning.}}
:''The two walk off up the road towards town.''
:{{text|say|Exarch Akama|The orcs would be fools to attack our fortified cities.}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|With respect, I disagree. We MUST '''not''' underestimate them. Take me to the Exarch Council.}}
