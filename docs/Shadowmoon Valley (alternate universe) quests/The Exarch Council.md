==Objectives==
Speak with [[Exarch Othaar]] in [[Elodor]].

==Description==
Good work at the gates! The Shadowmoon orcs have been seeking prisoners for some reason. Their aggression helps our cause.

Come with me. I would like to introduce you to the Exarch Council, "The Hand of the Prophet." I have been trying to convince the Exarchs to support our cause and go on the offensive against the Iron Horde, but they are - as always - too cautious and slow to act.

Come with me, I will introduce you to Exarch Othaar up the hill. Perhaps meeting an Alliance hero can sway the council.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox||Karabor Arcanist Tome|Rangari Initiate Hatchet|Karabor Honor Guard Axe|Rangari Boot Knife|Karabor Stargazer Shield|Karabor Honor Guard Shield }}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|18}}
*1400 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Completion==
<Exarch Othaar is a towering, intimidating figure. His eyes bore in to you, determining if you are friend or foe.>

So, you are <name>, esteemed <class> of this "Alliance" that has appeared on our shores. On behalf of the Exarch Council, I welcome you to Elodor.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Maraad mounts up and starts moving toward [[Elodor]] proper. While passing the fields'':
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|Your laborers are hard at work, Commander. Soon your garrison will be well-stocked with food.}}
: ''On reaching Othaar, Maraad dismounts and approaches on foot.''
