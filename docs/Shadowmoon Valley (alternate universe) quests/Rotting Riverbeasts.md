==Objectives==
Kill 5 Blooming Mandroga.
*[[Blooming Mandragora]] slain (5)

==Description==
The [[botani]] are infecting the local [[riverbeast]]s with some kind of strange flesh-eating plant.

I fear this infection could spread to our people.

If you see any infested riverbeasts, kill the blooming plants that inhabit their bodies... before they kill you.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 515 legs|Blademoon Leggings|Blademoon Trousers|Blademoon Chain Leggings|Blademoon Plate Legguards}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*13690 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
We need to stop this infestation.

==Completion==
This new{{sic}} is disturbing to say the least. I'm shocked the infestation has spread so quickly.

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Rangari Duula|My brothers and sisters will be watching from the shadows, we will aid you when we can.}}

In the area for [[Fiona's Solution]], find [[Rangari Duula]] on the east bank of the river offering this quest.

South of the questgiver, the Infested Riverbeasts have [[Blooming Mandragora]] growing out of them. You are looking for dead ones on the other side of the river.
