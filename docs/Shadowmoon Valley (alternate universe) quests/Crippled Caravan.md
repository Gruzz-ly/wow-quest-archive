==Objectives==
Find Fiona's Caravan in {{Au|Shadowmoon Valley}}.
*Fiona found

==Description==
I'm getting reports that the [[botani]] have started leaving [[Blademoon Bloom|their bloom]] and attacking wandering travelers.  This is most unusual.

We already dispatched a number of {{Au|rangari}} to try and resolve this issue.

A caravan from [[Azeroth]] passed through here recently, you should probably check on your people to ensure their safety.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13830 XP

==Completion==
Commander! Am I glad to see you.

We have a situation here.

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Prelate Reenu|The caravan was led by a woman that looked like a wolf.  I must admit, I'm still getting used to you Azerothians. They left here just a few hours ago.}}

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Fiona|Hold on, [[Gidwin Goldbraids|Gidwin]]. Help is on the way.}}

Pick up [[WANTED: Maa'run's Hoof]] from the wanted poster before heading out, then exit the village to the west-southwest. Follow the trail to reach the caravan.
