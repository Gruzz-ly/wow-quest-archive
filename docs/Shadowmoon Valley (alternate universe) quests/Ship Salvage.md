[[File:Shadowmoon Darter.jpg|thumb|Shadowmoon Darter]]

Collect 15 crates of Drudgeboat Salvage.
*[[Drudgeboat Salvage]] x15

== Description ==
Commander, we are running low on supplies.

Maybe we can salvage materials from that ship you arrived on?

At the rate folks are coming through the portal we are going to be out of everything by sundown... or moondown?

I'm still getting used to this place.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*60x[[Garrison Resources]]
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

== Progress ==
Supplies are getting really low, commander.

== Completion ==
Wow... with all these supplies, we should be back on track.

We are blessed to have you protecting us, commander.

== Notes ==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Baros Alexston|Maybe those orcs have something on that boat we can use?... besides tooth piercing devices.}}

Pick up [[Keeping it Together]] and [[Pale Moonlight]] before heading out.

Follow the path northwest out of the garrison back north to [[Eventide Landing]]. At the ship, [[Karabor Peacekeeper]]s are trying to fight off [[Pale Devourer]]ers. They drop [[Drudgeboat Salvage]], as do the [[Shadowmoon Darter]]s in the water. Some of the salvage is outside of the phased area.

Further west at the draenei outpost, [[Gnaw Bloodseeker]] is in the middle of the area. Kill him with help from [[Qiana Moonshadow]]:
:{{text|say|Qiana Moonshadow|Is he dead? Phew... great work, commander. I'll stay here and take care of any stragglers.}}

Also, keep an eye out for rare fish [[Bahameye]] in the water surrounding the ship. It drops 15-20x [[Fire Ammonite]] and [[Garrison Resources]]. Floating underneath the ship is the [[Sunken Treasure (Shadowmoon Valley)|Sunken Treasure]], and a barrel of [[Fantastic Fish]] is found on an island just offshore of the steps. Both contain [[Garrison Resources]]. Inside the [[Paletide Den]] is some [[Stolen Treasure]], which contains more resources.

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Baros Alexston|Eww, some of these supplies are really water logged and... sticky? These will get the job done, but truly, this is disgusting.}}
