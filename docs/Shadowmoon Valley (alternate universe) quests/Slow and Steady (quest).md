==Objectives==
Gather the herbs and return to [[Sha'la]].
* [[Toxic Umbrafen Herbs]] (5)
*[[Toxin-Resistant Satchel]] (provided)

==Description==
Excellent!

When you've collected enough herbs from the local wildlife, return to me and I'll craft them into an ink for [[Ardule D'na|Master Ardule]].

The [[sporebat]]s and giants should have what you're looking for.

And remember, be careful!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13,690 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Ah, these are just what I was looking for!

==Completion==
That was fast, <name>!  And such a generous delivery!

I've secured the ink in a vial for you, but please be careful.

==Patch changes==
