==Objectives==
Search loose mud for Granny Loola's Husband.
*[[Loose Mud (Shadowmoon Valley)|Loose Mud]] Searched (5)

==Description==
Oh it was horrible.

My husband and I were fishing in the marsh, I fell asleep and when I woke up he had been turned into a toad!

I'm sure it was one of those Shadowmoon orcs I hear so much about.

He jumped into the muddy waters before I could catch him.

Will you help me find my lost love, <class>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|20}}
*13950 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Knowing my husband he's probably hibernating.  Did you check the loose mud in the marsh?

==Completion==
Hmmm... I'm sure one of these toads is my husband.

==Notes==
''On accept:''
:{{text|say|Old Loola|Bring me back any toads you find hibernating in the mud; I'm sure one of them is my husband.}}

Pick up [[The Clarity Elixir]] and [[A Grandmother's Remedy]] before heading out.

Interact with Muddy Toads at the bottom of the river and [[Belly Toad]]s on the surface, kill [[Echidnian Hydra]]s for their [[Engorged Heart]], [[Frenzied Swamplighter]]s for their [[Swamplighter Dust]], and the [[Pristine Star Lily]] is in the center of one of the big eastern trees of the marsh.

''On complete:''
:{{text|say|Old Loola|I'll have to kiss each toad to break the spell on my husband.}}
: ''Fishing pole in hand, Loola's husband walks up to the fire.''
:{{text|say|Vulaa|Hey honey, I'm back.}}
:{{text|say|Vulaa|Oh not again... Loola, I'm right here. I'm not a toad... for Light's sake.}}
:{{text|say|Old Loola|I don't know... seems suspicious. Maybe I should kiss a couple toads to be sure.}}

==Progression==
{{A Sister's Sacrifice}}
