==Objectives==
Use Gul'dan's Soul Trap on {{Au|Gul'dan}}.
*Gul'dan's Soul Trap used {{co|18.0|30.4|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*[[Razuun]] slain {{co|17.8|30.2|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*[[Gul'dan's Soul Trap]] (provided)

==Description==
Gul'dan is on the [[Shadow Rise]] just up the hill to the west. But, you must hurry, <name>. We know that he's about to leave for [[Talador]] and [[Frostfire Ridge]].

The use of the soul trap is straightforward. Simply point and shoot to ensnare Gul'dan. The crystal will take care of the rest.

I'll see you back at [[Starfall Outpost]] when you have him.

Good luck.

:{{text|say|Image of Archmage Khadgar|Be careful, my friend.  Gul'dan is not to be underestimated no matter how prepared you might be.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 543 cloaks|Foulspawn Drape|Felblood-Starched Cloak|Flayed Flesh Cloak}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|39}}
* 21360 XP

==Progress==
Time is of the essence, <name>.  We must secure Gul'dan before he leaves.


Run uphill to the west to find {{Au|Gul'dan}} and [[Razuun]] on the [[Shadow Rise]] at a demon altar. Use the quest item on Gul'dan.

: ''Gul'dan, after a struggle, throws up a shield of fel energy.''
:{{text|yell|Gul'dan|I am not that easy.}}
:{{text|yell|Gul'dan|Razuun, your time has come.}}
:{{text|say|Razuun|What? No...}}
:''Realizing what's about to happen Razuun attempts to flee, but Gul'dan binds him to the very stone he was working at, dragging him back to it.''
:''Razuun is transformed into a man'ari eredar.''
:{{text|yell|Gul'dan|Have fun dealing with this.}}
:{{text|say|Razuun|DESTROY!}}

Defeat Razuun.
:{{text|yell|Gul'dan|No matter. Soon there will be enough felblood to make thousands for the Burning Legion.}}
:{{text|yell|Gul'dan|Do give my regards to Khadgar. I've a present coming for him.}}

==Completion==
Unfortunate, but not surprising. At least we were able to defeat one of the inner council members.

All is not lost, <name>. We know what the Shadow Council is up to and where they're heading.

We'll regroup in Talador. Together, we'll put an end to Teron'gor and his plans for Auchindoun.

Did you hear that?

''On complete, a cutscene, the player is sapped.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Commander, what's wrong?}}
:{{text|say|Cordana Felsong|Khadgar - someone's here!}}
:''Garona sneaks behind Khadgar and attempts to backstab him, but Khadgar pops his [[Ice Block]] just in time.''
:{{text|say|Garona Halforcen|Sorcerous coward.}}
:{{text|say|Cordana Felsong|Assassin!}}
:''Garona runs but Cordana intercepts her. They go at it for a few swings; Garona manages to stun Cordana then leaps backward on top of a small boulder.''
:{{text|say|Garona Halforcen|Gul'dan sends his best.}}
:''Garona vanishes.  Cordana runs back over to Khadgar.''
:{{text|say|Cordana Felsong|I knew it. You should've stayed back at the garrison, Archmage.}}
: ''Khadgar dispels the Ice Block.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Nonsense. I had that handled. Cool as a cucumber.}}
