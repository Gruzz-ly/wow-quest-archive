'''Darkness Falls''' is the pre-final quest to the [[Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe) storyline|Shadowmoon Valley storyline]]. As the [[Iron Horde]] fleet nears [[Karabor]], {{Au|Ner'zhul}} commences the ritual to summon the {{Au|K'ara|Dark Star}} and end the Dranaei resistance once and for all. [[Yrel]], {{Au|Velen}}, and the commander must stop the ritual before the full power of the [[void]] is unleashed.

==Objectives==
Find Ner'zhul.
*Enter the [[Waning Crescent (Shadowmoon Valley)|Waning Crescent]] {{co|46.6|45.3|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*Find Ner'zhul {{co|51.0|46.1|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*{{Au|Ner'zhul}} defeated {{co|52.0|46.1|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
It is already beginning, over the hills to the southeast.

Ner'zhul has everything he needs to summon the Dark Star. The Iron Horde attack on Karabor is imminent. This is where everything ends.

Champion, I must ask you to ride ahead and delay Ner'zhul. I will join you as quickly as I can.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 522 weapons|Rangari Skinning Knife|Rangari Initiate Blackjack|Karabor Honor Guard Mace|Karabor Arcanist Wand|Karabor Warmace|Karabor Starsinger Staff|Rangari Initiate Longbow|Karabor Anchorite Cudgel}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|36|60}}
*20960 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Today is the day that everything ends.  But something new rises from the ashes.

==Completion==
Prophet Velen is gone, and yet there is no time to mourn.

We will honor Velen's passing once the Iron Horde have fled from these hills.

Now, champion, is the time to fight!

==Notes==
Head south from Embaari and look for the marked cave entrance, the [[Waning Crescent (Shadowmoon Valley)|Waning Crescent]]. In the cave in the north fork is a rare mob, the [[Dark Emanation]]. Kill the Shadowmoon Voidwhisperers around it, then loot the void terror for an [[Abberant's Paw]] and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]]. Closer to the end of the cave near the waterfall is a [[Glowing Cave Mushroom]]. Loot it for 10-20 [[Starflower]]s.

Run through the cave to enter [[Light's Fall]]. At the center of the area, {{Au|Ner'zhul}} is casting a ritual. Get close to start the encounter.
:{{text|say|Ner'zhul|You are just in time. Witness the dark majesty of the void!}}

Damage him to 60%:
:{{text|yell|Ner'zhul|I will save my clan, even if I must forfeit the souls of my ancestors.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Ner'zhul summons Risen Spirits for the {{text|red|[Ritual of Destruction]}}!}}
Ner'zhul goes immune and summons 3 [[Risen Spirit (Shadowmoon Valley)|Risen Spirits]]. Kill them before he winds up his attack.

At 20%:
:''Ner'zhul knocks the player away, stunning it.''
:{{text|yell|Ner'zhul|Darkness is my strength! With this power, the Shadowmoon will be conquerors!}}
:{{text|yell|Prophet Velen|It is not too late. Turn from this dark path and let us help you.}}
:{{text|yell|Ner'zhul|The shadows have already consumed my soul, prophet.}}
:{{text|yell|Prophet Velen|There is no darkness light cannot pierce, Ner'zhul!}}
:{{text|yell|Ner'zhul|No! The power of the Dark Star will be MINE!}}
:''Ner'zhul summons a [[Void Horror]].''

After the void horror is killed, a cutscene takes place. 
:'''Ner'zhul''': {{text|bossemote|Behold... The [[K'ara (alternate universe)|Dark Star]] falls now upon you. The [[Iron Horde]] will prevail. And all that stand against us will die.}}
:''Ner'zhul teleports away. As Yrel looks on hopelessly, Velen gives her a reassuring look, transferring the naaru sigil on his forehead to her. Velen steps into the beam of void energy, sacrificing his own life to channel a beam of holy light into the Dark Star, purifying it and showing its true form: K'ara the naaru. As light flows across Shadowmoon Valley, [[Vindicator Maraad]] and the defenders of Karabor are blessed by Velen's light. K'ara floats down to greet Yrel and the commander.''
On the other side, K'ara is in the center of the platform. Turn in to Yrel, keeling on the other side.

''On complete:''
: ''Yrel is saddened and sounds somewhat disbelieving.''
:{{text|say|Yrel|I... I can't believe he's gone...}}
:''Vindicator Maraad flies in on a faerie dragon and dismounts by her. She stands to face him as he speaks.''
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|Yrel! The defense crystal is broken. The Iron Horde have overrun Karabor. We'd need a miracle to break through.}}
:{{text|emote|Yrel wipes away a tear.}}
:{{text|say|Yrel|Velen's sacrifice means nothing if the temple falls.}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|You don't have to do this, Yrel. Take the survivors and flee.}}
: ''She replies firmly and with conviction.''
:{{text|say|Yrel|No. We stand here against the Iron Horde. I will fight.}}
: ''Yrel turns to you.''
:{{text|say|Yrel|Hero, are you with us?}}

Maraad offers the next quest, [[The Righteous March]].
