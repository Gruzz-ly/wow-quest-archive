==Objectives==
Use the Gathered Pebbles to pop the Slumberblooms.
* Destroy Slumberblooms (8)
* [[Gathered Pebbles]] (provided)

==Description==
Huh?...  Oh my, I appear to have fallen asleep again.

These slumberblooms are nothing but trouble.  One second I'm fighting [[botani]] and the next I'm dreaming I'm an [[elekk]] dancing with [[riverbeast]]s.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Yawn*  We really should do something about all these slumberbloo *Yawn* ... ZZZZzzzzzzzz

<You gather a small handful of pebbles laying by the sleeping draenei.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

==Completion==
You can sleep easy tonight knowing you have destroyed so many slumberblooms... just not quite as easy.

==Notes==
Heading south to the [[Blademoon Bloom]] for [[Poison Paralysis]], [[Botani Beatdown]], [[Blademoon Bloom (quest)]], and [[Forever Young]], find the [[Sleepy Rangari]] on the east bank of the river in the [[Dyvari Overgrowth]].

The red slumberblooms all over the area to the south. It may be easier to create a <code>/tar Slumber</code> macro and turn on target tracking on the minimap.

Further south, in the [[Blademoon Bloom]], find rare mandragora [[Venomshade]], which drops the [[Venomshade Skin Boots]] and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]].

==Progression==
