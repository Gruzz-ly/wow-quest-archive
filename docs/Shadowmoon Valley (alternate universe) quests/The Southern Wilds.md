== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Prelate Reenu]] at [[Draakorium|The Draakorium]].

== Description ==
;[[Farmer Gehaar]]
First the [[Iron Horde]], then the Shadowmoon orcs, and now there's trouble brewing to the south!

My brother is a feyrider to the south, at the Draakorium.

He says that creatures from the swamp are venturing onto our lands. What is this world coming to?

Anyway, you look like a seasoned adventurer. If you are heading that way, would you mind checking in over there?

;[[Prelate Luari]]
I've heard disturbing news from our friends at The Draakorium, to the south.

The town lies near a swamp, and recently, dangerous creatures have been venturing near its borders.

You seem like a seasoned adventurer. If you are heading that way, would you mind checking in with our people there?

I would feel much better if I knew they were safe.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|60}}
*14100 XP

==Completion==
;Farmer Gehaar
Thank you for coming to our aid.

;Prelate Luari
Ah, Prelate Luari sent you, did she? Such a sweet woman, always looking out for others. 

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Prelate Reenu|Why would the botani be wandering outside of Blademoon Bloom in the first place?}}

This quest and the main storyline quest, [[Into Twilight]], can be completed independently, so pick whichever looks more appealing. Don't forget to complete the [[Migrant Workers]] chain either!

Before leaving the observatory, head upstairs to find the [[Astrologer's Box]], which contains the [[Star Chart]] and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]]. Also, immediately south of the observatory, look for rare raven [[Darktalon]]. It drops [[Darktalon's Drape]] and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]].

Follow the path clockwise to the east, south, then back to the west, picking up the flight paths at [[Path of the Light]] and the [[Draakorium]]. Just west of the Path of Light flightpath is rare warp stalker [[Insha'tar]], which drops [[Boots of the Shadowborn]] and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]].
