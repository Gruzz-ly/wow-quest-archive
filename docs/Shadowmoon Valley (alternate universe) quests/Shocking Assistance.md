==Objectives==
Collect 100 Shockscales from [[Shockscale Eel|Shockscale eels]].
*[[Shockscale]] (100)

==Description==
It's been a struggle to support the family since my wife died, and I got too ambitious when I got a contract for shockscales.

Alas, there is no way I will hunt enough eels to fulfill it in time now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|14}}
*1350 [[XP]]
*[[A Treatise on the Alchemy of Draenor]]
*[[Alchemy Lab, Level 1]]

==Progress==
Thank you so much for finding my father.

==Completion==
You did this for my family? After you saved our father? Thank you, <name>.

You wished to know about Draenor alchemy? I will do my best to share my knowledge with you.

==Notes and trivia==
Jump in the water and start killing. Each one drops 10-20 scales. Turn back in to [[Abatha]].

At the south end of the mire, keep an eye out for rare riverbeast [[Rockhoof]]. It drops [[Rockhoof's Crest]] and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]].

During the beta, the quest was followed by [[Abatha, the Alchemist]].
