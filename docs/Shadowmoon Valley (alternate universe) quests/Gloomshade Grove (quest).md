== Description ==
<This looks like one of the pack mules from your garrison. It's strange that it's wandering out here alone.

You probably should investigate.>

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|11|80}}

== Progress ==
<The mule looks frightened.>


Take the path north into Gloomshade Grove, and find Phlox. Speak with it:
:{{text|say|Phlox|You friends was here, now they gone.}}
:{{text|say|Phlox|The clues you seek, is by the pond.}}
:''Phlox runs off to the east.''

Follow the path east, and when it turns north, take the left fork to the northwest. Inspect the Alliance Sword near Phlox on a rock:
:<This weapon looks like it could have belonged to someone from the missing search party.>

Speak with Phlox:
:{{text|say|Phlox|You found a weapon a friend might wield.}}
:{{text|say|Phlox|You find more answers in the field.}}
:''Phlox runs back down the path back to the southeast.''

Before following Phlox, head just west to the next big tree. This one has a cave underneath, filled with [[Carnivorous Squirrel]]s. Clear a path to the back of the cave to find at {{co|37.2|23.1|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}} a [[Bubbling Cauldron (Shadowmoon Valley)|Bubbling Cauldron]], which contains a [[Void-Boiled Squirrel]] and some [[Garrison Resources]].

From the squirrel-infested tree, head north-northeast to find Phlox in a field by a shield:
:<It looks like this shield belonged to the missing search party.
:Upon further inspection, you find what appears to be hundreds of little puncture marks covering the blood-stained armor.>

Speak with Phlox again:
:{{text|say|Phlox|You found the armor, no friend in reach.}}
:{{text|say|Phlox|You find more clues, at the beach.}}

Head northeast to find Phlox next to a dead horse and packmule.
: You find thousands of tiny puncture marks covering the dead mule's body.>

Speak with Phlox again:
:{{text|say|Phlox|Their mounts is dead, they must be saved.}}
:{{text|say|Phlox|Your final clue, is in the cave.}}

Follow Phlox northeast to enter the [[Gloomshade Grotto]]. At the north end, find [[Jarrod Hamby]], [[Ryan Metcalf (NPC)|Ryan Metcalf]], and [[Phlox]], who is hostile!
:{{text|say|Jarrod Hamby|Run <class>, it's a trap!}}
:{{text|say|Phlox|Fool, I tricked you from the start. The time is now, I'll swallow your heart!}}

Phlox charges to attack as a handful of Podling Nibblers come in from behind. Take them all out.
