== Objectives ==
Plant the Alliance banner.
*Plant the Alliance Banner {{co|29.0|16.1|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

== Description ==
We wouldn't have survived [[Tanaan Jungle|Tanaan]] without your strength, <name>.  Many draenei and Alliance alike owe you a great debt.

Before we departed for the Dark Portal, [[Varian Wrynn|King Wrynn]] personally recommended that I place you in charge of our operations here in {{Au|Draenor}}.  After seeing you in action, I'm inclined to agree.

This is your garrison to found.  Plant the banner and we'll begin construction immediately, commander.

== Rewards ==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 510 weapons|Rangari Initiate Crossbow|Karabor Footman's Pike|Rangari Initiate Dagger|Karabor Greatsword|Rangari Initiate Armblade|Karabor Footman Sword|Karabor Arcanist Rod|Karabor Augury Mace}}
You will also receive:
* {{cost|8|60}}
* 10250 XP

== Progress ==
{{Stub-section}}

== Completion ==
So this is Draenor? A bit darker than expected. Still, after building [[Stormwind]], this project should be a walk in the park.

Well then, are you ready to begin, commander?

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|Plant your banner, and claim your destiny.}}

Step forward and plant the banner.
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I can open up a portal to Stormwind only briefly.}}
: ''Khadgar returns to human form, walks over to one side and channels a portal; some guards and laborers walk out along with [[Jarrod Hamby|Jarrod]] and [[Shelly Hamby]] and [[Assistant Brightstone]].  [[Lieutenant Thorn]] walks over to the interior edge of the plateau overlooking the road, while a Starfall Sentinel runs to the edge, checks her bearings and runs off for the road southeast (presumably to scout a suitable location for [[Starfall Outpost]]).
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|I do hope my trust in your people is not misplaced.}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|I assure you, my Prophet, the commander we've chosen represents the very best of the Alliance.}}
:{{text|say|[[Foreman Zipfizzle]]|Alright, come on through. Steady... Steady...}}
:''Zipfizzle backs out of the portal, coaxing a Garrison Packmule through.  Baros Alexston immediately walks through afterward.''
:{{text|say|Baros Alexston|This is it, boys! Let's break some ground and take this world for the Alliance!}}
: ''In the meantime, the Hambys and a dwarven laborer set up a large campfire for the group.  After seeing to the packmule, Zipfizzle joins them.''
