==Objectives==
Kill 20 {{Au|Shadow Council}} orcs at [[Gul'var]].
*Gul'var [[orc]] slain (20)

==Description==
[[Archmage Khadgar|Khadgar]] wants you to concentrate on {{Au|Gul'dan}}, but that doesn't mean we're not going to take down the Shadow Council in the process.

Gul'var's filthy with Shadow Council villains. Let's do something about them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13}}
*14250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We need to nip the Shadow Council in the bud while their numbers are still low on this world.

==Completion==
Every world is better off without those demon-loving scum.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Soul Shards of Summoning]] before heading out.

Back to the west to the southern entrance of Gul'var. Find [[Grogal the Harvester]] by an altar at the south end of the quest area, [[Fel Mistress Hagra]] at an altar to the north, and [[Corruptor Kurgoth]] all the way to the north. Keep killing [[Shadow Warrior]]s, [[Gul'var Peon]]s, and [[Lesser Warlock]]s too.

==Progression==
{{Starfall Outpost}}
