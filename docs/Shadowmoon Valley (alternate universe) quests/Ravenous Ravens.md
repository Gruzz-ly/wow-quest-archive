==Objectives==
[[File:Lunarfall Raven.jpg|thumb|Lunarfall Raven]]
Kill 6 Lunarfall Ravens.
*[[Lunarfall Raven]] slain (6)

==Description==
Do you see that? There is a gigantic raven just past the tree line.

I'm not getting anywhere near that. In fact, I'm not sure any of the men are sufficiently equipped to deal with a threat like that.

Do you want to handle this one yourself, commander?

Once those ravens are gone we can start sending more troops into the woods. So we will be killing two birds with one stone... or should I say kill five birds with...

<Confused by his own analogy, Baros scratches his head.>

You get the point.

==Rewards==
Level 90 talents will be unlocked.

You will also receive:
* {{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you kill those ravens?

==Completion==
This place is just full of surprises... terrifying surprises.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baros Alexston|Giant killer ravens... I have a feeling it's going to be a long, cold night.}}

Pick up [[Looking for Lumber]] before heading out. Then mark trees, and kill ravens.

In the [[Lunarfall Matriarch]]'s nest at {{co|30.2|19.9|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}, look for the [[Lunarfall Egg]], which contains 5-10x [[Garrison Resources]].  After completing [[Establish Your Garrison (Alliance)]], depending on your garrison tier the egg can be found at a different spot.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Baros Alexston|Impressive work, commander. I know I'll sleep a lot better without those giant killer birds flying around.}}

==Progression==
{{Establishing a Foothold}}
