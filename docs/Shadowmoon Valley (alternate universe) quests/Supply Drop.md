==Objectives==
Speak with [[Baros Alexston]] at [[Lunarfall|your garrison]] in {{Au|Shadowmoon Valley}}.

==Description==
Your laborers below have finished with the harvest and are ready to cart supplies back to your garrison. Don't worry about the safety of your caravan this time; I will dispatch a rangari detail to shadow them from the woods and protect them.

The Exarchs will always watch over you.

Your supplies should be waiting for you when you return to your garrison. Good luck with your campaign, <name>!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*50x [[Garrison Resources]]
*{{cost|1|18}}
*1400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Commander! [[Foreman Zipfizzle|Zipfizzle]] arrived with your laborers in tow just moments ago. We've got a huge surplus of food, now, and promises of more where that came from.

Apparently the draenei threw in some other resources as well. Very good work, <sir/ma'am>. What should we build next?

==Notes==
Before heading back to the garrison, this is a good time to pick up on Prophet Velen's quest, [[Into Twilight]].
