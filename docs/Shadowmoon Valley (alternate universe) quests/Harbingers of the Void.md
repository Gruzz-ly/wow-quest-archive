==Objectives==
[[File:Essence of Shadow.jpg|thumb|Essence of Shadow.]]
[[File:Essence of Anguish.jpg|thumb|Essence of Anguish.]]
Destroy the Essence of Shadow, Essence of Darkness, and Essence of Anguish.
*[[Essence of Shadow]] slain {{co|34.1|43.2|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*[[Essence of Darkness]] slain {{co|31.4|39.3|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*[[Essence of Anguish]] slain {{co|34.8|45.3|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
Our scouts have made a horrifying discovery, <name>.

The souls of the prisoners are being used to summon creatures from the void.

Inside, three beings of darkness already await - the Essence of Shadow, the Essence of Darkness, and the Essence of Anguish.

They must be destroyed immediately, before their power can be unleashed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
*13850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
The souls of innocents were used to birth the foul creatures.  All that is depraved, and sick, and twisted in this world, are embodied within them.

==Completion==
I knew I could trust this task to you, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Into Anguish]], [[On the Offensive]], [[The Great Salvation]], and [[Across the Stars]] before heading in.

Run up the stairs and interact with the main doorway. Go through the entry building. Take a left to find the Mark of Shadows. Go a bit further to find the [[Essence of Shadow]]. Kill one of the [[Shadowmoon Prophet]]s to attack it. Turn around and find the Mark of Anguish on the opposite side of the door. Past it is the [[Essence of Darkness]] over a hole to the lower level. Further west up the hill is the Mark of Darkness. Later, head to the east side of the area to find the [[Essence of Anguish]] in the [[Ancestor's Grotto]].
