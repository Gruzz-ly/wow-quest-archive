* Follow the clue to find the Rough Crystal Shard

==Description==
In his quest to restore the [[Dream of Argus]], [[Artificer Maatun|Maatun]] enlisted the help of three [[orc]]s. These same orcs betrayed him and took the crystal shards before they could be combined. If you find these orcs, they may still have them. The first target shouldn't be far. The journal reads: "I was told she spent most of her time in the crystal cave to the north of the encampment. There she studied the native crystals for ways to improve their potential abilities."
