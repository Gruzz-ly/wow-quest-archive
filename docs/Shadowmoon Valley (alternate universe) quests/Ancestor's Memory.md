Find the Ancestor's Totem in the cave beneath [[Exile's Rise]].
*Ancestor's Totem found {{co|45.7|25.3|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
I believe that you should know the price of the lives you take.

So before I will help you find {{Au|Ner'zhul}}, you must understand why he joined the [[Iron Horde]].

In a cave beneath this village is an artifact that we call the Ancestral Totem. On it is carved the names of every Shadowmoon clan member since its founding.

The opening of the cave lies directly south. I will meet you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 514 legs|Karabor Honor Guard Legguards|Rangari Initiate Leggings|Karabor Skirmisher Legguards|Karabor Sage Leggings }}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|23|60}}
*17300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You must understand a man's life before taking it.

==Completion==
We will find new traditions. My people will become something... new.

==Notes==
Jump down the cliff and enter the cave directly underneath Rulkan's position. Interact with the Ancestor's Totem in the cave:

: ''Rulkan walks in towards you, speaking.''
:{{text|say|Rulkan|When the Iron Horde came, they gave our clan a choice. Join them, or die.}}
: ''From the east, Ner'zhul walks toward {{Au|Grommash Hellscream}} approaching from the west, who has [[Commander Vorka]] off his right shoulder, and [[Garrosh Hellscream]] off his left.  Ner'zhul kneels.''
:{{text|say|Rulkan|My husband Ner'zhul chose to save our people. He joined the Iron Horde, but they asked of him a heavy price.}}
:{{text|say|Rulkan|They said:}}
:{{text|say|Grommash Hellscream|What good are stars and visions against steel and powder? Make a worthy offering, or your people shall die.}}
:{{text|say|Rulkan|So Ner'zhul turned to the silent void. He broke the ancient laws, and drew upon the dark star.}}
: ''Ner'zhul summons two void beings behind him.  Rulkan walks up to face him.''
:{{text|say|Rulkan|I pleaded with him to stop, but he would not turn back.}}
: ''Ignoring Rulkan, Ner'zhul walks past her and to the Ancestor's Totem, which he destroys.''
:{{text|say|Rulkan|By breaking this stone, he foreswore all loyalty to our ancestors.}}
: ''Grom's party turns and walks away, Ner'zhul following.''
:{{text|say|Rulkan|You must do what I cannot. Stop Ner'zhul. End his madness before it is too late.}}
:{{text|say|Rulkan|The Shadowmoon fortress is sealed to outsiders, but this keystone will allow entry. Good luck, hero.}}

Northeast of the Ancestor's Totem in the cave is the [[Shadowmoon Exile Treasure]]. It contains the [[Shadowmoon Astrologer's Almanac]]. If the player has already looted the [[Mushroom Covered Chest]] in [[Umbrafen]], this chest will not be visible.
