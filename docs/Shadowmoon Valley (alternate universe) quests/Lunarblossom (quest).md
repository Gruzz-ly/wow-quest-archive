== Objectives ==
Pick 5 Lunarblossoms.
*[[Lunarblossom]] x5

== Description ==
How I long to hold [[Kat'la]].

No star or moon can compare to her beauty.

Alas, I am but a simple boar farmer.

If only I could find time to sneak away from this pathetic excuse for a job and pick some lunarblossoms for Kat'la.

I wouldn't dare confess my love to her without a gift.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13850 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
How can I help you, <class>?

== Completion ==
Lunarblossoms! You are too kind! I can't wait to give these to Kat'la.

==Notes==

Pick up [[Forbidden Love]] and [[Lurking in the Shadows]] before heading out.

Exit the rise and head east to the [[Umbrafen]] and follow the trail north. [[Lunarblossom]]s are marked on the minimap. [[Shadowmoon Disruptor]]s are near a bunch of [[Shadow Skeleton]]s, generally holding a Windreaver Stargazer by the neck. At the north end of the path, the path loops back south, entering the mouth of a cave. Inside are [[Dol'mak]] and [[Kral'za]]. Kill [[Dol'mak]] to spawn the [[Dark Apparition]].

Between the quest area and [[Windreaver's Rise]], look out for [[Rai'vosh]], a rare unbound air elemental, whom [[Windcaller Turog]] is trying to bind. Rai'vosh drops the [[Whispers of Rai'Vosh]] and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]].
