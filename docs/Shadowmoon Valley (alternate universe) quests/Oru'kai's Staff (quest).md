==Objectives==
Retrieve Oru'kai's staff and return it to Delath.
*[[Oru'kai's Staff]]
*[[Oru'kai's Ember Ring]] (provided)

==Description==
If I had known being an enchanter was this dangerous, I would have stayed in Shattrath. Here, take this ring. The arakkoa told me to use the ring on the staff to nullify the enchantment. Bring the scepter back to him and maybe he will teach you what he promised to teach me.

==Progress==
The staff! Give it to me!

==Completion==
Yes... This is it, after so many years. Soon, I will have all of the Armaments of Oru'kai.

Return my ring as well and I will fulfill the promise I made to that squeamish draenei. 

Take this book. If you have any skill, you can use it to decipher and learn Draenor's enchantments. 

Of course, you will need a proper workplace as well. Here are plans; hopefully you can follow them.

Now, be gone, and steer clear of the other armaments, for they are mine.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13,690 [[XP]]
*[[Draenor Enchanting (item)]]	
*[[Enchanter's Study, Level 1]]
