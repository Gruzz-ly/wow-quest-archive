'''Transponder 047-B''' starts the profession quest line for engineers to unlock 700 skill and the [[Engineering Works]] for your garrison.

==Objectives==
Return the transponder to [[Goggles]].

==Description==
The back of the transponder is etched in scribbled writing.

<URGENT: If found, please return to Goggles near [[Elodor|Eledor]]{{sic}}.  It is of the utmost importance!>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*13,690 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh my!  What do we have here, commander?

<Inspecting the transponder.>

A little damaged, slightly bent and burnt to a crisp, but this is my lucky day!

We've been testing a new device and this transponder carries invaluable information!  I'll have [[Bixx]] extract the coordinates for mapping.

Just a few more parts and I should be able to teleport anything across {{Au|Shadowmoon Valley|this entire valley}}!  And I do mean anything!

That'll surely help our reinforcements stand against the [[Iron Horde]]!
