==Objectives==
Find out what happend to [[Shelly Hamby|Shelly]] and the missing lumberjacks.

==Description==
Shelly and her crew haven't returned from [[Gloomshade Grove]].

It's been days... I hope everything is okay.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|70}}
*6850 [[XP]]
*25x [[Garrison Resources]]

==Completion==
This is one of the pack mules Shelly and her crew took to Gloomshade Grove.

==Notes==
You must finish [[The Fate of Karabor]] and [[Escape From Shaz'gul]] to get this quest.

Exit the garrison to the south and cut east across the northern [[Plains of Serenity]]. East of [[Kuu'rat]]'s position is a small pool of water. On the bottom of that pond at {{co|37.2|26.0|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}} is the [[Sunken Fishing boat]], which can be looted for 5 [[Parasitic Starfish]] and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]]. Keep heading southeast to find [[Ockbar the Wanderer]] up a tree, who says one of these lines:
*{{text|say|Ockbar the Wanderer|[Draenei] Beware the podlings, <class>. They are not what they seem.}}
*{{text|say|Ockbar the Wanderer|[Draenei] I would be careful in this forest, <class>.}}

Just south of Ockbar is the [[Lost Packmule]] on the path into [[Gloomshade Grove]].

You can pick up [[Gloomshade Game Hunter]] here, or back at the garrison.
