== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Qiana Moonshadow]].
*Speak with Qiana Moonshadow {{co|29.9|29.2|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

== Description ==
If we are to win this war we are going to need more than foot soldiers. We need champions.

Qiana Moonshadow's performance in [[Tanaan Jungle|Tanaan]] and [[Eventide Landing]] was quite impressive.

Perhaps you should speak with her about taking on a greater role in the battle against the [[Iron Horde]].

== Rewards ==
You will gain these followers: Follower: [[Qiana Moonshadow]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 [[XP]]

== Completion ==
Luuka is a little shaken up, but he is safe, and that's all that really matters.

Look... commander, I owe you my life. All of us do honestly.

I would be honored to serve as your agent here in Draenor. If you have need of me, you need only say the word.

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|Qiana just headed out to [[Moonflower Valley]]. She is quite eager to explore this new land.}}

Exit to the south and follow the path, taking the right fork to find [[Qiana Moonshadow]] and [[Luuka]] at a broken caravan, staring down three [[Injured Stalker]]s. Finish them off, then interact with her:
:{{text|say|Qiana Moonfang|Commander! Your timing is impeccable as always.}}
:{{text|say|Qiana Moonshadow|Luuka, follow me. It is time we returned to the garrison.}}
:{{text|say|Luuka|I'll never sneak onto another wagon again. I swear!}}
:''They take off running back toward the garrison. In the Town Hall, find Qiana Moonshadow standing at [[Lieutenant Thorn]]'s table.

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Qiana Moonshadow|You have my utmost respect, commander. I will follow you into the dark anytime.}}
