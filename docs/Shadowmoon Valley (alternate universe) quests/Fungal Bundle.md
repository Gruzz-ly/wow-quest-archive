==Objectives==
Take the Curious Growth to [[Rangari Sheera]] at the [[Rangari Enclave]] in {{Au|Shadowmoon Valley}}.
*[[Curious Growth]] (provided)

==Description==
The umbraspore giant you killed seemed immune to the volatile spores in the area. Perhaps the odd growths you found all over its body contribute to its immunity. You grab a big, disgusting fungal lump in order to give it to the {{Au|rangari}} for study.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|40|}}
*17,460 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What did you find, <class>?

==Completion==
Oh - you were attacked by an [[Umbraspore Giant]]? They're very dangerous - you were brave to face one down!

This growth you found doesn't seem to be part of the giant. It's almost like another organism living in symbiosis. We'll have to study this more closely and see what benefit it conveys to the host.

Thank you, <name>. Outstanding work!
