==Objectives==
Destroy the [[Iron Horde]] in [[Karabor]].
*Complete The Defense of Karabor {{co|80.5|46.6|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
Defend Karabor from the Iron Horde.

At the end of the northern courtyard is [[Arnokk the Burner]]. He guards the entrance to the harbor behind Karabor, where the main Iron Horde army is waiting.

Once we've taken care of him, we'll need to deal with the Iron Horde leader, [[Commander Vorka]].

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 525 helms|Rangari Initiate Helm|Karabor Honor Guard Helm|Karabor Sage Cap|Karabor Skirmisher Hood}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|36|60}}
*20960 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}
*[[Large Karabor Fountain]]

==Completion==
We did it, <name>. Without your heroic efforts, the Temple of Karabor would have been lost to the Iron Horde.

Prophet Velen would be proud of us.

==Notes==
''On accept:''
:{{text|say|Vindicator Akama|These are the last of our forces. We'll stay here to hold the temple gates.}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Akama|Champion, I need you to fight your way to the harbor.}}

===Stage 1: Defeat Arnokk the Burner===
[[File:The Defense of Karabor - stage 3.jpg|thumb|Defeat Arnokk the Burner]]
:''Fight your way to the back gates and defeat Arnokk the Burner''
*Defeat [[Arnokk the Burner]] 
Head south. Arnokk at the eastern end of the courtyard near the door to the south. Save cooldowns for the last 20% when he summons reinforcements -- they will despawn on his death.

===Stage 2: Meet Yrel at the Karabor Harbor===
[[File:The Defense of Karabor - stage 4.jpg|thumb|Meet Yrel at Karabor Harbor]]
:''Fight your way to the Karabor Harbor''
*Clear a path to Karabor Harbor x5
*Meet Yrel at the Karabor Harbor. {{co|79.7|46.8|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
After Arnokk's death, keep moving south and kill five orcs along the way. Be warned that once you exit the hallway, [[Commander Vorka]] will order the fleet to constantly bombard the stairs. Head through the hall and down the stairs to the southeast. Yrel is at the base of the steps.
:{{text|yell|Commander Vorka|Iron Fleet!  Darken the skies!}}

Clearing the trios of orcs will free up the defenders and they will throw you a heal 
before leaving.
* {{text|say|Karabor Paladin|Forward!  We must stop Vorka!}}
* {{text|say|Karabor Paladin|My thanks to you.  Be healed and carry on!}}
* {{text|say|Karabor Paladin|Thank you for you assistance, be healed and back to battle!}}

===Stage 3: Protect K'ara from the invading forces===
[[File:The Defense of Karabor - stage 5.jpg|thumb|Protect K'ara from the invading forces]]
:''Protect K'ara until it becomes fully empowered.''
*Defend K'ara until it becomes fully empowered {{co|79.8|46.6|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
:{{text|say|Yrel|Champion, the naaru has come to aid us. We must defend it while it gathers power!}}
:{{text|bossemote|K'ara has blessed you with {{text|red|[K'ara's Benevolence]}}!}}

;Unknown
:{{text|say|Karabor Defender|I'll take the right flank, Maraad will take the left, you defend K'ara!}}

Start killing the waves of attackers. At 66%:
:{{text|bossemote|K'ara is nearing full power and gains {{text|red|[K'ara's Defense]}}!}}

Keep killing. K'ara will help by zapping enemies nearby.

===Final Stage: Kill Commmander Vorka!===
[[File:The Defense of Karabor - final stage.jpg|thumb|Kill Commander Vorka!]]
:''Stop the Bombardment of Karabor!''
*Defeat [[Commander Vorka]] {{co|80.5|46.6|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
:{{text|yell|Commander Vorka|ENOUGH. Play time is over. I will deal with you myself.}}
:{{text|say|Yrel|We've done it! Now to put an end to this assault...}}

Finish off the last of the spawned adds. Vorka is just to the east. Aggro him:
:{{text|yell|Commander Vorka|Witness the TRUE power of the Iron Horde!}}

Fire Support: Black Skies
* {{text|yell|Commander Vorka|Soldiers - Come to my aid!}}
* {{text|yell|Commander Vorka|The skies darken with iron!}}

Finish him off.

===Finale===
[[File:The Defense of Karabor - finale.jpg|thumb|Victory.]]
:''The camera pulls back as K'ara rushes forward to the circular area on the platform and unleashes a massive attack that destroys the Iron Horde ships in the harbor. [[Raindash]] flys in and lands by the beginning of the platform.''
: ''Yrel runs up by where Raindash waits and turns to you.''
:{{text|say|Yrel|We need to spread news of our victory. Take the fey dragon and meet me back at Embaari Village.}}

Hop on Raindash to fly back to [[Embaari Village]] to turn in to Yrel.

''On exiting scenario at Embaari Village:''
:{{text|say|Yrel|Hero, you fought fearlessly. For that, please accept my thanks.}}
:{{text|say|Yrel|The Light prevails, because WE stand against the darkness.}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|It is done! Victory is ours!}}
: ''The crowd of Karabor citizens break out in cheers of celebration.''

This completes the "The Light Prevails" portion of [[As I Walk Through the Valley of the Shadow of Moon]]. The [[Gorgrond storyline]] begins with [[The Secrets of Gorgrond (Alliance)]], which opened up as soon as players reached level 92.

Yrel will later mail the player [[The Prophet's Arcanum]].
{{book|Our Beloved Prophet|content=Thank you for standing by my side during our darkest moments, <name>.  I have learned so much since you rescued me from the Iron Horde in [[Tanaan]].  Destiny is calling me to a greater purpose, and I draw strength from your heroism!

The Prophet wanted you to have this.  It says a great deal to me that he trusted you immediately.  You have truly been a great boon to my people!

&nbsp;&nbsp;- Yrel}}

The achievement also unlocks the purchase of the [[Shadowmoon Valley Treasure Map]], to which Grakis will also send the player a letter.

{{book|Shiny Trinkets|content=Seek me out in Stormshield if you wish to find secrets hidden in the shadows and corners of the world.  I have ancient maps to guide on your way.{{sic}}

During the alpha, the objective was:
:Kill all the orcs in Grommar.
