==Objectives==
Meet [[Rangari Arepheon]] inside [[Blademoon Bloom]].
*Speak with Rangari Arepheon {{co|55.7|72.0|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
We are out of options.

I'm going into the bloom to find out what's going on. I'll meet you inside.

Good luck, <class>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*13700 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good, you made it. I need your help.

==Notes==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Rangari Arepheon|Seek me out inside Blademoon Bloom. It is time we put a stop to this.}}

Pick up [[Poison Paralysis]], [[Botani Beatdown]], and [[Forever Young]] before heading out.

On the way to Blademoon Bloom, find a [[Sleepy Rangari]] on the east bank. She offers [[Slumberbloom (quest)]]. The red slumberblooms all over the area to the south. It may be easier to create a <code>/tar Slumber</code> macro and turn on target tracking on the minimap.

Further south, in the [[Blademoon Bloom]], find rare mandragora [[Venomshade]], which drops the [[Venomshade Skin Boots]] and 10-20 [[Garrison Resources]].

All of the named NPCs and Youngroot nodes are marked on the minimap in [[Blademoon Bloom]]. The botani spawn in trees, and Arepheon is at the south end of the area. Find Arepheon and pick up his next quest, [[Gestating Genesaur]], before heading back to the caravan.
