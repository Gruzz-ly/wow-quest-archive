== Objectives ==
[[File:Karnoth.jpg|thumb|Karnoth]]
Confront [[Ner'zhul (alternate universe)|Ner'zhul]].
*{{Au|Ner'zhul}} confronted {{co|49.4|36.9|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*[[Karnoth]] slain {{co|49.4|36.9|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

== Description ==
We've managed to pin Ner'zhul inside [[Teluuna Observatory|the Observatory]], but he's taken many down with him.

He has taken [[Yrel]]'s sister, [[Samaara]].

I am needed to hold the line here. Please, do whatever you can to save her, hero.

== Rewards ==
You will receive one of:
{{itembox|Item level 512 belts|Rangari Initiate Belt|Karabor Skirmisher Belt|Karabor Honor Guard Girdle|Karabor Sage Cord}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|23|60}}
* {{cost|gr=100}}
* 17300 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Progress ==
Ths Shadowmoon clan's aggression began when the Iron Horde arrived on {{Au|Draenor}}.

== Completion ==
Your aid in retaking Teluuna Observatory has not gone unnoticed, hero. I grow increasingly impressed at your prowess in battle.

Perhaps you could share some of your knowledge with my disciples. They could learn much from a seasoned adventurer such as yourself.

I have something for you, as a thanks for what you've done even in the short time you've been here. Perhaps it will help you get this garrison of yours on its feet.

== Notes ==
On accept, run in to the observatory, where Ner'zhul is holding Samaara up before a fel portal:
: ''Yrel runs up the stairs and into the observatory.''
:{{text|say|Yrel|No... Samaara!}}
:{{text|say|Samaara|Ner'zhul, stop this! What do you want?}}
:{{text|say|Ner'zhul|Your blood will grant me the powers of the Dark Star. To [[Shaz'gul]] with you!}}
:{{text|say|Samaara|Yrel.... noooo!}}
: ''Samaara is pulled into the portal.''
:{{text|say|Ner'zhul|Tell your prophet that his era is over. Darkness dawns!}}
:''Ner'zhul leaps into the portal as he summons [[Karnoth]], Shard of the Dark Star.''
:{{text|emote|Ner'zhul's laugh echoes ominously in your mind.}}
:{{text|say|Yrel|Champion! Focus your attacks on that... THING! I will protect the others.}}
Kill Karnoth.
: ''Velen runs up beside Yrel as a Teluuna Guardian checks the body of one of the researchers. Velen and Yrel face each other.''
:{{text|say|Yrel|Great Prophet! Ner'zhul is taking the captives to Shaz'gul.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|We need to get our eyes onto the field. The {{Au|Rangari}} can help us.}}

This concludes the "Shadows Awaken" portion of [[As I Walk Through the Valley of the Shadow of Moon]]. Karnoth will drop a Draenor-level profession-starting item, such as the [[Mysterious Flask]] for alchemists.

Prophet Velen continues the [[Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe) storyline|Shadowmoon Valley storyline]] with [[Into Twilight]]. [[Farmer Gehaar]] offers a side chain, [[The Southern Wilds]]. Before working on those quests, don't forget about the other quest from the garrison, [[Migrant Workers]], which takes place a bit closer than either of the direct followups.

Before leaving the observatory, head upstairs to find the [[Astrologer's Box]], which contains the [[Star Chart]] and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]].  It is more than likely that you can't see it due to quest phasing; leave the immediate area so that the quest elements despawn.
