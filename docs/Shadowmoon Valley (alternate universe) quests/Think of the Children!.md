==Description==
When the Shadowmoon attacked [[Arbor Glen]], everything was thrown into chaos.

Many of us escaped, but there are still three children missing.

I believe they are still back in the village.

Please save them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
*13850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Are the children alright?

==Completion==
I am glad to hear that the children are safe. They will remember your heroic deeds for their entire lives.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Dark Enemies]] and [[Closing the Door]] before heading out.

Get to the north side of the lake and follow the road east. Hakaam is in the first area east of the one due north of Embaari.
:{{text|say|Hakaam|Wow, did you fight off all the orcs? You're strong!}}
Arianna is in the next area, and she offers [[In Need of a Hero]], a mandatory side quest to save Squiggy, her pet.
:{{text|say|Ariaana|Yay! Thank you thank you thank you SO much!}}
From Arianna's area, head south to find [[Rastaak]].
:{{text|say|Rastaak|I thought everyone forgot about me. Thank you, <mister/kind lady>!}}
