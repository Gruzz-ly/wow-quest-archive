== Objectives ==
Mark 8 trees.
*Mark trees for lumberjacks x8

== Description ==
Some of the trees around here look small enough that the workers should be able to down them in no time.

We can leave the hard labor to Shelly's men, but if you'd be willing to mark the trees for them to start with, we should be able to get this operation rolling much faster.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

== Progress ==
How goes the lumber hunt?

== Completion ==
Perfect.

Not only will this lumber do the job, it will look fantastic!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baros Alexston|If you mark those trees, Shelly's lumberjacks will do the rest.}}

Pick up [[Ravenous Ravens]] before heading out. Then mark trees, and kill ravens.

In the [[Lunarfall Matriarch]]'s nest {{co|30.2|19.9|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}, look for the [[Lunarfall Egg]], which contains 5-10x [[Garrison Resources]]. The egg can only be found while [[Lunarfall]] is not in the garrison phase, so find it before completing [[Establish Your Garrison (Alliance)]] or it will be lost forever.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Baros Alexston|An excellent choice of lumber, if I do say so myself.}}

==Progression==
{{Establishing a Foothold}}
