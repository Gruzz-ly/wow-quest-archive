==Objectives==
[[Garaal]] awaits your delivery.
* [[Neatly Bundled Goods]] (provided)

==Description==
Alright. Here you go.

Be sure to deliver them to Garaal quickly. He has a heavy interest in detail and fine craftsmanship. He'll surely appreciate your work.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|11|40}}
|The Tannery, Level 1
|Draenor Leatherworking (item)}}

==Completion==
Greetings, <name>.

Fanara mentioned the competition was fierce this year.

My, my. These goods should keep me busy for an entire season!

As the victor of the competition one usually becomes my apprentice, however, your skills are surely in need of no apprenticeship.

Perhaps a trade is in order.

I'll keep your delivery and share the goods with our local craftsmen and in return, I'll share some of our knowledge with you.
