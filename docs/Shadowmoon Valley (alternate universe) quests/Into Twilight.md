==Objectives==
Speak to {{Au|Velen|Prophet Velen}} at [[Twilight Glade]] in {{Au|Shadowmoon Valley}}.

==Description==
The safety of my people is of the utmost priority.

It is likely that {{Au|Ner'zhul}} has taken the prisoners to [[Shaz'gul]], his stronghold to the southwest.

I do not wish to use aggression against him, but he may force my hand.

Meet me at Twilight Glade, <name>. Then, we shall try our best to recover the prisoners.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|90}}
*6900 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Completion==
Thank you for coming, <name>. There is much to be done.

==Notes==
Before heading out, [[Farmer Gehaar]] starts a level 93 side quest, [[The Southern Wilds]]. Don't forget to complete [[Migrant Workers]]!

Before leaving the observatory, head upstairs to find the [[Astrologer's Box]], which contains the [[Star Chart]] and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]]. Also, immediately south of the observatory, look for rare raven [[Darktalon]]. It drops [[Darktalon's Drape]] and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]].

Head southeast from Embaari to find the [[Twilight Glade]], where Velen awaits. On approach:
:{{text|say|Yrel|Master Velen, I have never led soldiers before. Are you sure--}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|You are capable of more than you know, Yrel.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Now go. The Rangari follow your orders. Find the prisoners.}}
: ''Yrel mounts up on a talbuk; the two Rangari Sharpshooters by [[Rangari Veka]] walk over and do the same, and follow Yrel to the south east.''
