==Objectives==
Speak with {{Au|Exarch Maladaar}} at the [[Fey Landing]] south of [[Elodor]].

==Description==
The council is almost assembled: [[Exarch Othaar|Othaar]], [[Exarch Akama|myself]], {{Au|Exarch Hataaru|Hataaru}} and {{Au|Exarch Naielle|Naielle}} are ready. Only Exarch Maladaar remains. He has not been himself since he returned from his capture at the hands of the [[Iron Horde]]... but [[Vindicator Maraad]] was able to track him down.

Find Maladaar at the Fey Landing, just south of the town center.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|18}}
*1400 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Completion==
<Name>, my Alliance friend from [[Tanaan Jungle|Tanaan]]! [[A Potential Ally (Alliance)|I have not forgotten my debt to you.]]

I will do everything in my power to convince the council to support you in every way possible.  However...

<The Exarch lowers his voice.>

I have grave concerns about our safety here.
