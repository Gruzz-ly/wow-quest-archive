== Objectives ==
Follow [[Velen (alternate universe)|Prophet Velen]].
*Accompany Prophet Velen to Lunarfall Ruins {{co|28.8|16.2|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

== Description ==
So, you are the one that has led my children home? I have been waiting for you.

The Iron Horde grows stronger every day.

I have foreseen a great battle, but my visions are clouded. It's as if time is sitting on top of itself.

One thing is certain, your presence here is of great importance.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP

== Completion ==
This will have to do.

== Notes ==
At the [[Eventide Landing]], find [[Velen (alternate universe)|Prophet Velen]], [[Archmage Khadgar]], [[Vindicator Maraad]], [[Yrel]], and [[Cordana Felsong]] all at the ship. Speak with Velen to start the ride, and Maraad to turn in.

On accept:
: ''Yrel and Velen briefly step up to each other.''
:{{text|say|Yrel|Prophet, this hero - and many others from another world - have come to aid us.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|It is good to see you, my child. My people welcome your aid, champion. Come with me.}}
: ''Velen mounts as he speaks and as soon as he finishes, heads for the path uphill. Yrel and Maraad follow suit as Khadgar flys up ahead in crow form.''
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|Prophet, I must warn you: the Iron Horde intends to strike out against all who oppose them. We must prepare our defenses.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|We will deal with one problem at a time. First, we must settle your people.}}
: ''The group comes up the rise, dismounts and walks to the center of the plateau.''
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Here! This location commands the entrance to our valley.}}
