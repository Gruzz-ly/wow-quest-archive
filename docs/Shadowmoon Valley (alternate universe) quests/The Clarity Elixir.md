==Objectives==
[[File:Frenzied Swamplighter.jpg|thumb|Frenzied Swamplighter.]]
[[File:Echidnian Hydra.jpg|thumb|Echidnian Hydra.]]
[[File:Pristine Star Lily.jpg|thumb|Pristine Star Lily.]]
Collect 6 Swamplighter Dust, 3 Engorged Hearts, and 1 Starflower.
*[[Swamplighter Dust]] (6)
*[[Engorged Heart]] (3)
*[[Pristine Star Lily]] {{co|47.3|52.1|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
I see a thousand glimpses of the future, swimming in a chaotic blur.

It is possible to focus my energies to see the true eventuality - the future most likely to come to pass.

I will need an oracle stone to focus my power, and a special elixir to still my mind.

To make the elixir, I will need the following ingredients: wing dust from Swamplighters along the river, fresh hearts from a monstrously-sized hydra, and a rare star lily.

Meet me at [[Moonwillow Peak]] when this task is done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*35x [[Garrison Resources]]
*{{cost|11|80}}
*13850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==

[[File:The Clarity Elixir - Velen.jpg|thumb|Velen at Moonwillow Peak.]]
My trust in you is well placed, young <class>.

This task would have been troublesome for many of my students, and yet you finished it with ease.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Loola's Lost Love]], and [[A Grandmother's Remedy]] before entering the [[Nightmarsh]]. Save [[Going Undercover]] for later.

Interact with Muddy Toads and [[Belly Toad]]s, kill [[Echidnian Hydra]]s for their [[Engorged Heart]], [[Frenzied Swamplighter]]s for their [[Swamplighter Dust]], and the [[Pristine Star Lily]] is in the center of one of the big eastern trees of the marsh.

Turn in northwest of [[Twilight Glade]] at [[Moonwillow Peak]].

==Progression==
{{A Sister's Sacrifice}}
