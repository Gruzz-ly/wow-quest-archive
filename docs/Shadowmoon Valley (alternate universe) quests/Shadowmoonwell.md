==Objectives==
Collect a Chunk of Lunar Rock.
*[[Chunk of Lunar Rock]] {{co|23.1|20.8|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
[[Archmage Khadgar|The archmage]] has asked me to prepare this [[moonwell]]. Once it is completed, I'll be able to sanctify its water for use against the demons.

Only one thing remains.

A piece of one of Draenor's moons has fallen into a nearby pool on the far side of the woods. Such a thing is perfect for use in the dedication of the moonwell to Elune.

Will you bring it back for me, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
* 13850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
With that chunk of fallen rock, I'll be able to complete the dedication of the moonwell.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. The [[White Lady]] will be pleased.

Now, I shall go about the business of preparing the moonwell water for use in the archmage's plan.

But first, I wonder if you'd be willing to help me again. The warden broght back very disturbing stories about the creatures in the woods.

==Notes==
Head northwest through the [[Cursed Woods]] to the [[Secluded Glade]]. A huge chunk of lunar rock has landed in the pool.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Delas Moonfang|Be careful. It's likely the rock has attracted the creatures of the woods.}}

On return:
:{{text|say|Delas Moonfang|Elune-Adore, <class>.}}

==Progression==
