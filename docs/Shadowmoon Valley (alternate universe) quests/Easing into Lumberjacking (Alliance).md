==Objectives==
Harvest a Timber Sample from [[Small Timber]] and return it to [[Justin Timberlord]].
* [[Timber Sample]]

==Description==
<Sir/Ma'am>, we're going to need a lot of lumber if we're going to build this garrison into a suitable fortress. That means we're going to have to do a little work.

While I certainly wouldn't ask you to dirty your hands with manual labor, I do need you to go out and find timber for our mill. Once you mark a tree a lumberjack will come chop it down and give you the timber.

Let's give our lumberjacks a test run. There's a tree nearby!

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Apprentice Logging]]

You will also receive:
*x50 [[Garrison Resources]]
*{{cost|||30}}
* 17,110 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This garrison isn't going to build itself, commander! We need timber!

==Completion==
You're going to make a fine overseer, sir! Keep those lumberjacks in line!

Now you know the basics of logging and finding timber. Time to put them to good use for the good of your garrison.
