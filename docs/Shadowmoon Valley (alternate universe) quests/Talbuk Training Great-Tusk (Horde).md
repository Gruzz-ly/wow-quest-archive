==Objectives==
Defeat Great-Tusk while riding your Talbuk-In-Training.
*[[Great-Tusk]] Killed
*[[Silverpelt-In-Training Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
The talbuk is ready for more training, and for this, we will return to its home in Shadowmoon Valley.

One of the great beasts of this land, Great-Tusk, has taken the valley for his own. Pit your beast against him in combat, and if you should survive, it will have greater confidence in its own abilities.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (20)

==Completion==
That was a fine battle to test your talbuk against. It will need to rest before we can continue the training.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
