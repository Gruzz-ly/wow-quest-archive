==Objectives==
[[File:Shimmershroom.jpg|thumb|Shimmershroom]]
[[File:Volatile Spore.jpg|thumb|Volatile Spore]]
Use the Shimmershrooms to safely gather 12 [[Volatile Spore (item)|Volatile Spores]].
*[[Volatile Spore]] (12)

==Description==
It is our mission as rangari to explore and understand this world. Around you is the [[Umbrafen]]. Many draenei lost their lives when we first discovered this place. The volatile spores burst whenever anyone approaches.

But we watched... and we learned.

Around the swamp you'll notice "Shimmershrooms," distinguished by their orange glowcaps. Their dust will make you invisible to the volatile spores. Grab the spores - gently! - and bring them to me.

We will forge this savage world into a weapon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|80}}
*13850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Remember, unless you are covered in shimmershroom dust, the spores will explode as you get near.

==Completion==
Careful with those... hand them here. Wonderful!

I will have my rangari bury these around the perimeter of Elodor. If the Shadowmoon orcs attack us again, they are in for a nasty surprise!

Draenor is a hostile world, but if we can take the time to learn and understand it, we can turn it to our advantage.

I will finish up here and meet with the Exarch Council shortly. I will be sure to back your proposal.


''If Hataaru's quest was done first, [[Exarch Akama]] will be here:''
:{{text|say|Exarch Naielle|Exarch Akama, how do you plan to vote? I suppose you'll want to wait behind the fortifications of [[Shattrath City (alternate universe)|Shattrath]] and [[Karabor]].}}
:{{text|say|[[Exarch Akama]]|It is wisest to fight where we are strongest.}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Naielle|If we never leave our city walls, we will never be able to call this world our home.}}

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Sting]] from [[Rangari Chel]] before heading out.

Don't kill the [[Volatile Spore]]s without having clicked on an orange Shimmerspore mushroom in the Umbrafen. Stay mounted! After interacting with the mushroom, the spores are friendly for 30 seconds. Quickly run around and gather up spores.

At the northern end of the Umbrafen, keep an eye out for [[Ba'ruun]], rare elite [[fungal giant]]. It drops [[Ba'ruun's Bountiful Bloom]] and 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]].

After completion of this quest and [[Shut 'er Down]], [[Exarch Akama]] offers [[Exarch Maladaar (quest)]].
