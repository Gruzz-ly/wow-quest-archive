==Objectives==
Kill Enemy Players in Player versus Player combat to earn 10 Broken Bones then place an offering at the Altar of Bones to Earn a Conqueror's Tribute.
*[[Broken Bones]] (20)

==Description==
{{Au|Council of Exarchs|The Exarchs}} do nothing but squabble amongst themselves over petty issues while our people are slaughtered in their homes by orc filth. If they will not raise a fist of defiance against our enemies, I will.

I wish to join your Alliance and rid this world of Horde. ALL HORDE - "Iron" or otherwise.

This Altar of Bones that I stand upon represents glory in battle against our Horde enemy. Place an offering upon it and earn a conqueror's tribute worthy of your unrelenting bloodthirst.

Kill. Them. All.

==Completion==
It is a start, to be certain, but there is much work to be done if {{Au|Draenor}} is to be saved. Show no mercy, for they will show none to you.

The only warlords left upon Draenor will be you and I.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80|}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (50)

==Notes==
Requires the [[Gladiator's Sanctum]] building.
