==Objectives==
Destroy the ancient barrier below [[Socrethar's Rise]] and claim the [[Grimoire of the Nameless Void]].

==Description==

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|150||22}}
* 3,770 [[XP]]

==Progress==
[[Harrison Jones|Dr. Jones]] asked me to take this book from you, but I'm not sure I want to touch it.

==Completion==
I'll make sure this gets to Dr. Jones. 

To be honest, I'm eager to get it off my hands.

==Progression==
