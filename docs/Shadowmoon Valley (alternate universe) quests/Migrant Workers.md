==Objectives==
Speak with [[Foreman Zipfizzle]] in your garrison, then meet with the laborers outside of [[Elodor]].
*Speak with Zipfizzle {{co|44.3|51.1|Lunarfall||1}}

==Description==
<Name>, more recruits arrive at your garrison every hour. We will soon run out of food.

I have made contact with [[Exarch Akama]] in hopes of securing rations from Elodor, the breadbasket of this valley. He has agreed, provided we supply labor for the harvest. Everyone wins.

If you agree with my plan, speak with Foreman Zipfizzle here in the courtyard - he has gathered together available laborers. Akama and I will escort them and meet you at Elodor, far to the east!

''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Foreman Zipfizzle|C'mon people step it up here. We got hungry bellies to fill.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*25x[[Garrison Resources]]
*{{cost|5|90}}
*6900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Speak with Zipfizzle:
: Sir, commander, sir!
: On Maraad's orderes I rounded up a bunch of lackeys - erm - quality skilled labor. Say the word and we'll get this caravan to Elodor and secure some food.
''{{gossip|Very good, Zipfizzle. Move out.}}''
:{{text|say|Foreman Zipfizzle|You heard the commander. MOVE OUT! Go, go!}}
: ''The wagons and packmules move out to form a line on the main road exiting the garrison, with Zipfizzle driving the lead wagon.''
:{{text|say|Exarch Akama|Ah. The little one is the taskmaster.}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|You'll find our Alliance is full of surprises, Exarch. This is the commander I told you about.}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Akama|Commander! You have built a most impressive garrison. I am eager to see your men in action.}}
: ''Maraad and Akama mount up.''
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|We will escort this caravan and meet you in Elodor, commander.}}
: ''Akama moves up to lead the caravan while Maraad brings up the rear, and the procession leaves the garrison.''

==Completion==
You made it!

But... one of our wagons didn't. Have you seen Maraad? He's still out there somewhere.

==Notes==
Before following the caravan, pick up [[A Hero's Welcome (quest)]] from [[Yrel]]. Yrel's quest continues the main storyline. After completing [[Shadows Awaken]], Prophet Velen sends players off to the southeast in [[Into Twilight]], so before doing that quest, this is a good point to pick up this side chain. From [[Teluuna Observatory]], follow the road to the northeast. Just outside [[Elodor]] in the [[Elodor Fields]], find [[Foreman Zipfizzle]] on the road into town.
