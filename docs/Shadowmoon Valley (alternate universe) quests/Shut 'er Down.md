==Objectives==
[[File:Malfunctioning Resonance Crystal.jpg|thumb|Malfunctioning Resonance Crystal.]]
[[File:Override Lever.jpg|thumb|Override lever.]]
Disable the [[Malfunctioning Resonance Crystal]] in the [[Elodor Dig]].
*Crystal Disabled {{co|64.4|26.2|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
Burrowing native creatures known as "[[goren]]" have tunneled into our crystal mines. Judging from our experience at the gates, I suspect my own experimental resonance crystal is whipping the native wildlife into a frenzy.

Enter the Elodor Dig to the north and disable the malfunctioning resonance crystal!

Be careful - my earthworkers report that the mine is crawling with those beasts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Have you braved the mines yet, <class>?

==Completion==
Excellent. I will send in some peacekeepers to quell any remaining problems.

[[Exarch Naielle (alternate universe)|Exarch Naielle]] may be right - perhaps I am too aggressive in adapting our technology to this world. Still, I will never quit. Our civilization must move forward!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Engorged Goren]] from [[Apprentice Artificer Andren]] before heading in.

: ''Entering the mine proper, several workers flee the mine.''
: {{text|say|Elodor Crystalsmith|The mines are overrun!}}
: {{text|emote|A Crystalmaw Goren cries out incoherently and rushes up the ramp.}}

: ''Inside the mine, an Elodor Artificer is at a safe distance from the crystal.''
: {{text|say|Elodor Artificer|It's the resonance crystal - it's driving them crazy!}}

Kill anything that moves. In the back of the cave, look for the [[Malfunctioning Resonance Crystal]] in the back of the mine. Behind the crystal is an Override Lever.

''If Naielle's quest was done first, [[Exarch Akama]] will be here:''
:{{text|say|Exarch Akama|Exarch Hataaru - How do you plan to vote with the council?}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Hataaru|This "[[Alliance]]" from [[Azeroth|another world]] intrigues me. I would give them our full support.}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Akama|You would risk everything we have built. I cannot agree!}}

After completion of this quest and [[Fun with Fungus]], [[Exarch Akama]] offers [[Exarch Maladaar (quest)]].

==Progression==
