== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Gnaw Bloodseeker.jpg|Gnaw Bloodseeker}}
Kill Gnaw Bloodseeker and 8 Pale Devourers.
*[[Gnaw Bloodseeker]] slain {{co|25.6|5.7|Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)}}
*[[Pale Devourer]] slain x8

== Description ==
We are getting strange reports of an orc attack on a nearby draenei settlement called [[Eventide Landing]].

I'm hearing these particular orcs are unlike any we have encountered before.

They seem... sickly, and are pale in color.

The locals could use our help, commander. This seems like the perfect opportunity to test our garrison's capabilities.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 13700 XP
*60x[[Garrison Resources]]

== Process ==
Did you see the pale orcs, commander?

== Completion ==
This is unnerving to say the least.

Those things must have come from underground.

Hopefully we have seen the last of them.

== Notes ==
''On accept'':
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|Be careful, commander. If these pale orcs are real, who knows what powers they possess.}}

Pick up [[Keeping it Together]] and [[Ship Salvage]] before heading out.

There are plenty of pale on the beach, but more are found in the [[Paletide Den]] off to the west, which also contains an [[Iron Horde Stowaway]] and his [[Stolen Treasure]], which contains 10-20x [[Garrison Resources]]. There's also the barrel of [[Fantastic Fish]] found on the small island just south of the steps where [[Gnaw Bloodseeker]] was, the [[Sunken Treasure (Shadowmoon Valley)|Sunken Treasure]] beneath the stolen Iron Horde ship, and [[Bahameye]] swimming in the waters outside the ship.

''On complete'':
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|These pale orcs sound dangerous. Hopefully this is the last we see of them.}}
