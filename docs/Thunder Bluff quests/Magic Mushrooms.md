==Objectives==
Gather 6 "Magic" Mushrooms from the [[Pools of Vision]] in [[Thunder Bluff]]. Deliver them to Aska Mistrunner in Thunder Bluff.
* [["Magic" Mushroom]] (6)

==Description==
You know of the Pools of Vision, yes?

There is a sort of mushroom that grows there... not the tough, rank fungi that dominates the place, but smaller, more delicate caps that grow beneath them.

They are rare and quite delicious, adding a flavor to meat dishes that one might even call magical.

...what? No, really. They just taste good. That's it.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40|ea=1}} +1 [[Cooking]] Skill

==Progress==
Were you able to gather any mushrooms?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>! I'm sure these will impart a simply magical taste to whatever dish they're used in.

What? Stop looking at me like that!
