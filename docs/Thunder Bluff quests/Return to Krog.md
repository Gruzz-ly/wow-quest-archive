==Objectives==
Speak with [[Krog]] at [[Brackenwall Village]].

==Description==
I hope I've been helpful to you and I'm sorry I can't offer more information. My apprentices and I produce such a large volume of arms and armor that it's almost impossible to recall details about any individual piece.

Not only do we outfit the braves defending [[tauren]] lands, but the [[Grimtotem]]s have a particular fondness for my work. A seasoned warrior knows good work when he sees it.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Fleshripper (dagger)
|Crimson Barbut
|Serrated Gladius
}}

==Completion==
He actually said that the Grimtotems are his biggest customers? Mosarn gave us more help than he knows. With this much pointing toward the Grimtotems, I think we just found our first suspects.

==Progression==
{{Return to Krog}}
