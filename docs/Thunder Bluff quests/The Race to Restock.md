==Objectives==
[[Kah Mistrunner]] in [[Thunder Bluff]] wants 2 Randy Smallfish and 2 Amorous Mud Snappers from [[Stonebull Lake]] in [[Mulgore]]. 
*[[Randy Smallfish]] (2)
*[[Amorous Mud Snapper]] (2)

==Description==
Thunder Bluff's fishing pond is being overrun with voracious Azshara snakeheads; there are hardly any smallfish or mud snappers left.

We already have fishers trying to kill as many snakeheads as they can, but can you assist us in our restocking efforts?

If you could gather some fish from Stonebull Lake and bring them here to Thunder Bluff, I would be very grateful.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}}, +1 [[Fishing]]
{{itembox|You will also receive:
|Bag of Shiny Things}}

==Progress==
Did you bring those fish from Stonebull Lake, yet?

==Completion==
Your help is much appreciated, <name>.

Hopefully these fish will go a long way towards restocking our fishing pond.

==Notes==
This quest is a requirement for the achievement [[Fish or Cut Bait: Thunder Bluff]].
