==Objectives==
Stop the Malevolent Spirit.
* [[Malevolent Spirit]] slain
* Talk to [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]]

==Description==
It is fortunate that [[Spiritwalker Ussoh]] passed along your spirit guide's warning. We were able to evacuate most of the [[Commoner|citizens]].

This cursed spirit is full of malevolence and hatred. It must be destroyed, <name>!

We attack on your command.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
You have saved [[Thunder Bluff]], <class>. However, The [[Veil|spirit realm]] is growing more restless and balance is tipping. We have restored it for now. But how long until the scales are moved again and what is causing it?

I do not have those answer, but I do have another favor to ask.

==Notes==
Speak with Baine Bloodhoof:
{{dialogue|
Give the command!

{{gossip|Attack}}}}

Once you begin the assault, you will be empowered.

:{{Text|Say|Baine Bloodhoof|<Name>! I am at your side!}}

When the Spiritwalkers summon the Ancestor Spirit
:{{Text|Yell|Baine Bloodhoof|Stand beside our ancestors and accept their aid!}}
:{{Text|Yell|Baine Bloodhoof|The ancestors! Let them grant you their power!}}

After defeating the Malevolent Spirit, the Spirits of [[Cairne Bloodhoof]] and [[Tamaala]] appear.
:{{Text|Say|Baine Bloodhoof|We must destroy the spirit before it is too late!}}
:Baine runs back and sees the spirits of his parents.
:{{Text|Say|Cairne Bloodhoof|No, my son. Let it be.}}
:{{Text|Say|Cairne Bloodhoof|Our way seeks not destruction, but harmony. We need both and shadow to see what lies before us.}}
:{{Text|Say|Cairne Bloodhoof|You have helped this champion restore balance to the spirit realm. And balance is what we strive for.}}
:{{Text|Say|Baine Bloodhoof|Father...Mother...Can you stay? I have so much I wish to tell you.}}
:{{Text|Say|Cairne Bloodhoof|I know. But we must wait for another time.}}
:{{Text|Say|Cairne Bloodhoof|We are proud of you, my son. Remember always that the Earth Mother watches over you... and so do we.}}

And then, the spirits have vanished. Head to Baine Bloodhoof to turn in.
