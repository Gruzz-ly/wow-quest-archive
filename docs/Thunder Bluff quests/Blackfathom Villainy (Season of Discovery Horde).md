==Objectives==
Bring the head of [[Twilight Lord Kelris (Season of Discovery)|Twilight Lord Kelris]] to [[Bashana Runetotem]] in [[Thunder Bluff]].
* [[Head of Kelris]]

==Description==
Strength has left me. Your help is needed!

Long ago this site was a great temple of [[Elune]]. But misfortune led to ruin when the corruption of an [[Old God]] seeped up from beneath the earth and tainted the sacred [[Moon Well]].

[[Aku'Mai]], servant of the Old God, rose from the waters.

The [[Twilight's Hammer]] cultists have allied with the [[naga]] to occupy these grounds. The cultists, led by Kelris, sacrifice innocents to Aku'Mai for power.

Slay Kelris and bring his head to Bashana in Thunder Bluff, <name>, please.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Inscribed Gravestone Scepter
|Ancient Arctic Buckler}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||65}}
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]
*+200 reputation with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
May the [[Earthmother]] be with you, <name>.

Peace between the earth and all her people should be our goal. She has a grand plan for nature, and we all have a role to play in that plan.

==Completion==
Kelris has eluded the [[Argent Dawn]] for some time.

For some time they considered him dead or missing.

By ending his reign you have spared the lives of many innocent people, <name>.

Earthmother be praised! To sacrifice another to a servant of an Old God for personal gain is beyond disgusting!

You have done a great thing this day. Kelris was a creature of evil and sought to bring the world back to a time of chaos by worshipping such creatures as the Old Gods. Thank you, <name>.
