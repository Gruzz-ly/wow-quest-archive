==Objectives==
Place Clarice's Pendant on Yuriv's Tomb in [[Silverpine]].
*[[Clarice's Pendant]] (Provided)

==Description==
Filthy scum! Leaves me for his damn crusade. Because "the Light is the most important thing we have against the threats the [[undead]] pose."

Well, what about his children?! What about ME?! Night after night I sat patiently waiting for him... always second to his blasted duty!

Well, witness what "justice" brings you, <name>! He's dead and I'm bearing the very thing he was trying to stop!

Take this piece of junk and put it on his tomb at the [[Sepulcher]]. I want nothing to do with it anymore... or him!

==Progress==
The stone is cold to the touch,  but has obviously been abused. Trash litters the area; nicks and gashes decorate the relief atop the coffin; and the foliage around the grave has started to grow over the site.

No one cares for whoever is buried here, especially not any victims of the plague.

==Completion==
You place the worthless pendant on the grave, and the gemstone within the setting seems to dull noticeably.

As you stand to leave, you look down at the pendant; it lies lifelessly over the hands of the relief sculpted into the top of the coffin. Your thoughts are interrupted by a stiff, cool breeze passing over the Sepulcher. For a moment everything around you is silent.
