==Objectives==
Slay 4 Dark Tendrils and 12 Shadows of Uul in [[Thunder Bluff]].
* [[Dark Tendril]] slain (4)
* [[Shadow of Uul]] slain (12)

==Description==
A dark force has descended upon us. I refuse to believe that the [[Highmountain tauren|Highmountain]] are behind it.

The cacophony out there is disturbingly familiar. Could it be... 

No! The minions of the [[Old God]]s are attacking! We must fight for Thunder Bluff, <name>!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
For the Old Gods to manifest even these fledgling minions is troubling.

==Completion==
The Old Gods are known for subversion and duplicity. To attack so brazenly...

Whatever they seek, they want it badly.

==Notes==
*The central mesas of Thunder Bluff are phased to be under attack. Many more friendly NPCs reappear, now being trapped by the Void. Some that are regularly seen outside their buildings and tents are now placed inside.
*Baine will follow you. His [[generic name]] for other nearby players is Honor Guard.
