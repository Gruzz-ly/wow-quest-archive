*[[Fresh Mulgore Spice Bread]] (5)
*[[Mulgore Spices]] (provided)

==Description==
I am often asked, "Aska, who is making all this Mulgore spice bread?!"

It is a reasonable question. Our fine and noble bread is traded in countless settlements in the most far-away lands, even by our staunchest foes. IT'S JUST THAT GOOD.

And the answer...?

It is "YOU." Please take this packet of Mulgore spices and use it to turn bland, boring spice bread into MULGORE spice bread!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40|ea=1}} +1 [[Cooking]] Skill

==Progress==
Have you baked that Mulgore spice bread yet?

==Completion==
Ooo, that bread smells delicious. You are quite the baker, <name>.

Who knows how far these exquisite loaves will go... I hear it's even popular among the [[draenei]] of the [[Azuremyst Isles]]!
