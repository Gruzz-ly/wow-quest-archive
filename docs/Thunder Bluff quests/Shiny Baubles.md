==Objectives==
Nahari Cloudchaser in Thunder Bluff wants 20 Shiny Stones from around the central rise's base. 
*[[Shiny Stone]] (20)

==Description==
One of a fisher's most simple and effective tools is the shiny bauble; affixed to a line, even the most novice angler has a chance at a catch.

With all the fishing going on of late, though, Thunder Bluff is in woefully short supply!

Might I ask you to collect shiny stones from around the base of the central rise? Bring them to Nahari Cloudchaser so that she might craft more shiny baubles with them. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}}, +2 [[Fishing]]
{{itembox|You will also receive:
|Bag of Shiny Things}}

==Progress==
Did you happen to bring me any shiny stones?

==Completion==
My, those are some very lovely stones! They'll make perfect shiny baubles, thank you.

Here... Kah told me you'd be by with the stones, and to give this to you upon your arrival.  

==Notes==
This quest is a requirement for the achievement [[Fish or Cut Bait: Thunder Bluff]].
