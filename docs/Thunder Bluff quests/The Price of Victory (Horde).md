==Objectives==
Inform [[Baine Bloodhoof]] of what has transpired.
* Speak with Baine Bloodhoof
*Return to Lor'themar before the gates of Orgrimmar.

==Description==
[[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]]... I...

<Lor'themar takes a moment to compose himself.>

...[[Thrall]] will wish to honor Saurfang's sacrifice. And so shall the rest of us.

Recall our forces. Let them know what has transpired. Tell them that the great warrior Varok Saurfang is dead and that the warchief has abandoned us.

Speak to Baine when you arrive in [[Thunder Bluff]]. You will find him on the [[Elder Rise]]. I am certain he will want to pay his respects as well.

Let us stand as a united Horde once more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
He earned the warrior's death he always sought. There is honor in that.

==Completion==
Saurfang's death will not be in vain.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Jaina Proudmoore|Lady Jaina Proudmoore]]|Regent Lord, what manner of magic did Sylvanas use against Saurfang?}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|I had hoped either you or Thalyssra would have the answer to that question. I have never seen her wield such power.}}
:{{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|It was unlike any magic I have ever encountered. I could sense none of it, even in her presence.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Then she must have only recently acquired it... or simply waited until now to reveal it.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Either way, it does not bode well for us. Whatever she is planning, she no longer needs the Horde to achieve it.}}

Fly to Thunder Bluff. Baine is at the tent on the Elder Rise, with [[Hamuul Runetotem|Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem]], [[Ji Firepaw]], and [[Mayla Highmountain]].

:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|It pains me to remain here while others fight on the frontline.}}
:{{text|say|Mayla Highmountain|You have done more than your part, Baine. Focus on your recovery.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Champion! Has the battle been won?}}

Speak to Baine:
{{Dialogue|
It is good to see you, <name>... but if you are here, then the battle must already be over.

{{Gossip|Saurfang challenged Sylvanas to mak'gora. And then...}}
}}
:{{text|say|Mayla Highmountain|By the Earth Mother...}}
:{{text|emote|Ji bows his head.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Saurfang...}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|He risked his life to save mine... and gave his life to save the Horde.}}
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Go, <name>. We will meet you in Orgrimmar, to honor the memory of Varok Saurfang.}}

Return to Lor'themar outside Orgrimmar.
