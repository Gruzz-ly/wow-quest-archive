==Objectives==
Speak with [[Spiritwalker Ussoh]] at [[Fargaze Mesa]] in [[Camp Narache]].

==Description==
As you know, the [[spiritwalker]]s commune with our ancestors and maintain balance within the [[Veil|spirit realm]]. It is a sacred duty that links our present to our past.

But lately the spiritwalkers have been troubled by visions of chaos and turmoil. Of a rising darkness.

They tell me that the [[Ghost|spirits]] have whispered your name. We are unsure why, but Spiritwalker Ussoh means to find out.

Seek Ussoh on Fargaze Mesa to the south. Good luck, <name>. I believe you may need it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Hmph. I expected you sooner. 

No matter. Have a seat.

==Progression==
{{Heritage of the Shu'halo}}
