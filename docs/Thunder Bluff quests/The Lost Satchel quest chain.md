This set of three Horde-only quests describes the aftermath of [[Magatha Grimtotem|Magatha Grimtotem's]] failed attempt to befriend the [[troggs]] in [[Ragefire Chasm]]. It consists of a two-part quest and a technically independent third quest and gives a nice boost of XP and Rep to low level characters.

== Testing an Enemy's Strength ==

'''[[Testing an Enemy's Strength]]'''

As you reach the adequate level (level 9, in fact), you could chat with [[Rahauro]], servant of Magatha. He will tell you that, beneath the city of Orgrimmar, stout creatures known as troggs started coming to the surface from deep below the lava filled tunnels. In her ever-benevolence, Magatha sought to make peace with the creatures, but they turned on her diplomats, killing them. She will not allow such treatment of the tauren people and now consider the creatures a threat to all of the Horde. So you receive the task to Search Orgrimmar for [[Ragefire Chasm]], then kill 8 [[Ragefire Trogg]]s and 8 [[Ragefire Shaman]] before returning to Rahauro in Thunder Bluff.

'''[[Searching for the Lost Satchel]]'''

Magatha has also heard word that one of her servants, Maur Grimtotem, found something peculiar while in the Chasm, but he never made it out to show her what. She'd like Maur's body found - if it still exists - and any signs of what he found while attempting to speak to the troggs. You have to Search Ragefire Chasm for Maur Grimtotem's corpse and search it for any items of interest.

His corpse can be found on the floor in front of [[Oggleflint]], a level 16 elite trogg. Enter the instance and follow the path to the end where it comes to a T and branches off in several directions.  Take the closest path to the right which goes up hill for a short distance.  When you reach the top at the landing look to the left and you will see an entrance to a small room where you find the body of Maura Runetotem on the ground with three Troggs surrounding it. 

'''[[Returning the Lost Satchel]]'''

You get the Grimtotem Satchel, Take the Grimtotem Satchel to Rahauro in Thunder Bluff. The complete quests are finished.
