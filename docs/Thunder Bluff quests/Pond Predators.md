==Objectives==
Kah Mistrunner in Thunder Bluff wants 8 Azshara Snakehead fish from the Thunder Bluff pond. 
*[[Azshara Snakehead]] (8)

==Description==
A well-meaning goblin visitor introduced Azshara snakeheads to our waters and now they're overrunning the pond.

Please, if you can catch some of these voracious predatory fish before they eat every smallfish and mud snapper in Thunder Bluff, I'd be terribly grateful.

You will receive: {{cost|9|40}}, +1 [[Fishing]]
{{itembox|You will also receive:
|Bag of Shiny Things}}

==Progress==
Have you caught any Azshara snakeheads, yet?

==Completion==
Good work, <name>. It's up to all of Thunder Bluff's fishers to keep this vicious creature out of Mulgore's waters.  

==Notes==
This quest is a requirement for the achievement [[Fish or Cut Bait: Thunder Bluff]].
