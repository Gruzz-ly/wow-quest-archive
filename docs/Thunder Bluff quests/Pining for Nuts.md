== Objectives ==
Obtain 30 Pine Nuts by toasting [[Mulgore Pine Cone]]s from Thunder Bluff. Deliver the nuts to Aska Mistrunner in Thunder Bluff.
* [[Pine Nut]] (30)

== Description ==
The [[Shu'halo]] use pine nuts in so MANY dishes: meat, fish, vegetables, even baked into breads or sprinkled over sweet pastries.

The Earth Mother has blessed us in that the very BEST pine nuts come from the trees upon these very mesas. Simply gather pine cones and toast them over a cooking fire to release the nuts within.

Would you please be so kind as to gather some? There are hardly ever enough to go around...

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40|ea=1}} +1 [[Cooking]] Skill

== Progress ==
Have you found many of those tasty pine nuts?

== Completion ==
You work so quickly!

I'll see that these are distributed to the various chefs and bakers of Thunder Bluff.

Thank you!
