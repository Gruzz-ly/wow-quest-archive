==Objectives==
Sneak into the [[Venture Company]] mine southeast of [[Thunder Bluff]] and collect 5 Seaforium Mining Charges from carts of blasting supplies, then return them to [[Boarton Shadetotem]] in [[Thunder Bluff]].
*[[Seaforium Mining Charge]] (5)
*[[Venture Co Disguise]] (provided)

==Description==
I sense in you a hidden talent for the subtle arts, shaman. Use this mask to infilrate{{sic}} the nearby Venture Company mine and steal their supplies. It may not seem like a convincing disguise, but a skilled [[rogue]] can slip past any guard with naught but a winning smile and a cunning distraction. I believe this capability lies within you as well.

==Progress==
We'll need to work on your stealth skills, shaman.  I heard you approaching as soon as you set foot on the mesa.

==Completion==
Hmm... perhaps disguises are not your strength.
