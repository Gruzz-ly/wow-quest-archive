Completing this quest (to get the mint) is required in order to complete [[Hallow's End Treats for Spoops!]]

==Objectives==
Do a dance emote at Innkeeper Pala, and in exchange you'll receive Thunder Bluff Marzipan!
*Dance for [[Innkeeper Pala]]

==Description==
Even though you're trick-or-treating for a sick child, you still need to perform a trick for the treat!  We can't very well change the tradition, now can we...

I believe the cost of a piece of marzipan nowadays is to bust out and DANCE!  That's right, let me see your moves!  Dance for me, and I'll give you some tasty marzipan!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Thunder Bluff Marzipan]]

==Progress==
You know how to dance, don't you?  Try by putting your right foot in... then your right foot out... your right foot in... shake it all about...

==Completion==
You're quite the dancing machine, <name>!

Here's your treat for being such a good sport. &nbsp;Happy Hallow's End, and give my best to your sick little friend! &nbsp;I hope they get better soon.
