==Objectives==
Fish up a Blind Cavefish from the Pools of Vision in Thunder Bluff. Once you catch a cavefish, fillet it and check if it swallowed the ring.
*[[Poshken's Ring]]

==Description==
One of the Forsaken from the Pools of Vision came to me and said he'd lost his ring to a blind cavefish in the waters there.

Or perhaps it was his finger. It was hard to tell; his jaw did not move and his Orcish was no better than mine.

In any case, I thought it would be a kind gesture towards our unusual visitors to catch and gut cavefish until the ring - or finger - was found.

Would you help?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}}, +1 [[Fishing]]
{{itembox|You will also receive:
|Bag of Shiny Things}}

==Progress==
You haven't seen a ring about, have you? I think one of the cavefish might have swallowed it...

==Completion==
You found my ring, did you? I'm most grateful.

To be honest, I've no idea why I keep the thing. I'm not even certain how I acquired it... I suppose I am simply a creature of habit.

Still, as I said, I am grateful. Say... I found these things while searching for it myself. Perhaps they'd be of some use to you?
