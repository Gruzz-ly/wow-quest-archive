==Objectives==
Bring Ahanu's Leather Goods to [[Tal]] in [[Thunder Bluff]].
* [[Ahanu's Leather Goods]] (provided)

==Description==
I have prepared leather goods for [[Varg Windwhisper|Varg]] to sell at the [[Bloodhoof Village]]. Will you bring them to him?

If you have already been to [[Bloodhoof Village]] and spoken to their [[wind rider master]], then you can fly one of our Thunder Bluff [[wind rider]]s back to him.

Take the leather goods to Tal, our wind rider master in Thunder Bluff, and speak with him to arrange transport to Bloodhoof Village. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 50 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Thunder Bluff (faction)|Thunder Bluff]]

==Progress==
Greetings, <class>. What can I do for you?

==Completion==
You need to take this to Bloodhoof Village, eh? That's not a problem. If you've already been there and spoken to [[Tak]], then you can take one of my wind riders back to him.
