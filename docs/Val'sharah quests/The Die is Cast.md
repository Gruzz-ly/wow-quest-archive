==Objectives==
Speak with [[Ysera]] at the [[Grove of Cenarius]].

==Description==
Thanks to your efforts the temple is safe, for now.

But the [[Tears of Elune]] are stolen and [[Shaladrassil]], the world tree that once protected this land, is now an instrument in the hands of our enemy. The [[Emerald Dream]] itself is being overrun by [[Emerald Nightmare|Nightmare]].

The hearts of our people falter, their faith tested like never before. Return to Ysera with my report, <name>, such as it is.

I shall plead with [[Elune]] with what time I have left here. May we somehow yet prevail.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54|}}
*1,480 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
This is dire news indeed, <name>.

Draw upon your courage now, friend, for [[Azeroth]] needs her heroes more than ever before.

==Notes==
A cutscene plays after turning in the quest.

:''[[Cenarius]] succumbs to the corruption and disappears, taken by the Emerald Nightmare.''

:''[[Elothir]] and [[Koda Steelclaw]] leave in separate directions.''
:{{text|say|Ysera|Meanwhile, [[adventurer|you]] and I will follow his trail from here. Malfurion must not fall.}}
