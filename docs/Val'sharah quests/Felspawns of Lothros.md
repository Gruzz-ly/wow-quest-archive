==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Lothros Legion.jpg|Lothros}}
Defeat Lothros.
*[[Lothros]] slain

==Description==
These Felspawns are endless! I can't cut them down quickly enough to get to the [[dreadlord]] within the mausoleum.

Master [[Illidan]], will you come with me so we can take down Lothros together?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
A dreadlord poses little danger to you, eh?

==Completion==
We've done it! Without you, I fear I would have eventually succumbed to the onslaught.

==Notes==
*Quest available during the scenario in [[Ravencrest's Legacy (quest)]].

*[[Felspawns of Lothros]]
