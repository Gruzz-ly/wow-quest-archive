==Objectives==
Search the forge, the saber pens, and the guard tower.
* [[Bradensbrook Villager|Prison cages checked]]
* [[Stareye's Orders|Guard tower checked]]
* [[Warden's Glaive|Midnight Forge checked]]

==Description==
The fortress grounds are just up ahead. There is a large area to search, but if we split up, I believe we can cover a lot of ground.

Search the prison cages, the forge, and the guard tower for any signs of [[Maiev Shadowsong|Maiev]]. I will check the upper ramparts and meet you on the other side of the keep.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Nightvale Wristwraps
|Sablehide Armbands
|Thornbrace Wristguards
|Rooksguard Vambraces
|Farseeker Drape
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*15,070 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
We will give this area a thorough search.

==Completion==
Good work, <name>. There is no doubt that they have already moved Maiev into the prison cells beneath the tower.

==Notes==
* The prison cage with the corpse of a [[Bradensbrook Villager]] is near [[Starlys Strongbow]].
* [[Stareye's Orders]] is located to the side of [[Kester Farseeker]].
* [[Warden's Glaive]] is located beside a night elven armor stand near [[Trelan Shieldbreaker]].
