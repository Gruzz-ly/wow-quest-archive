==Objectives==
Rescue 6 Sisters of the Moon in [[Lostlight Grotto]].
*[[Sister of the Moon]] saved (6)

==Description==
The [[owlbeast]]s here are disconnected from [[Elune]].

A contingent of [[dryad]]s went into their territory to find out what went wrong, but none of them have returned. I fear the worst, and I believe they are in need of rescue.

While I try to learn if the [[owlkin]] can be saved, I would appreciate your help in freeing any Sisters you find in the grotto.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
May Elune guide your path.

==Completion==
The owlbeasts are... melting the dryads down and using their bones to create minions?! How... how could this even be?

==Progression==
# [[Emerald Sisters]] & [[Where the Wildkin Are]]
#* Side quests: [[Dreamcatcher (quest)]], [[Grotesque Remains (quest)]]
