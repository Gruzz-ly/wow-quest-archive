==Objectives==
Protect [[Tyrande]] while she holds her vigil at the [[Ancient Moonwell]].
*Meet Tyrande in [[Shadowfen]]
*Guard Tyrande During her Vigil

==Description==
[[Xavius]] led [[Ysera]] past here, but their destination is unclear.  This twisted wickedness smothers my mind!

These refugees tell of an ancient [[Moonwell]] hidden in the ruins of their home.  If it somehow resisted this corruption...

I will beg of [[Elune]] a vision to give me direction.  With her light, I may find my husband yet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
He is still alive, but the rest remains to be seen.

==Notes==
Tyrande will be waiting for you at the moonwell in [[Shadowfen]]. She will walk up to the pool once you initiate the event, during which you will need to defend her from [[Wormtalon Huntress]]es and eventually the [[Wormtalon Matriarch]] herself.
