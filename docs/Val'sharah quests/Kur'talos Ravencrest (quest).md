==Objectives==
Examine Ravencrest's Sigil.
*Examine Ravencrest's Banner

==Description==
[[Kur'talos Ravencrest|Lord Ravencrest]] was a fearless leader, a seasoned commander, a man of integrity and honor, a teacher, and a protector of his people.

[[Malfurion Stormrage|Malfurion]], [[Illidan Stormrage|Illidan]], [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande]], and I... we were still young when he helped shape our destinies.

The sigil of his house was legendary. Observe, for a moment, the sigil over his former resting place and I shall tell you more of his legacy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*15,070 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
The attacking spirits spoke of their lord and master. I fear the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] has raised Lord Ravencrest to do their bidding. What price was paid for such a sinister revival, I do not know.
