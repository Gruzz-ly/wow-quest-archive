Slay 20 [[satyr]]s within [[Val'sharah]].
* Val'sharah Satyr slain (20)

==Description==
We must exact VENGEANCE for this. While I understand the importance of the balance between the [[Emerald Dream]] and the [[Emerald Nightmare|Nightmare]], this time it's corruption has gone TOO FAR!

Satyrs. I blame the satyrs for this. Make them pay! Make them pay, and [[Elune]] will reward you with her bounty!

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Legion|Herbalism Technique: Dreamleaf (Rank 2)]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Exact your bloody vengeance, <class>. Show them the might of an herbalist.

==Completion==
I feel the blight subsiding. Good.

Our respite will not last forever, but look... even now, the [[:dreamleaf]] has succumbed more of its bounty.
