Malfurion is nearby. I can sense him..

Search the summit of Andu'talah while I continue to scour the forest.

Be swift, <name>. Time is of the essence!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]
*[[The Corruptor's Totem]]

==Completion==
My husband, Malfurion, what has become of him?!

Answer me!

==Notes==
Follow the path of stairs going up from [[Moonrest]] through [[Andu'talah]]. There you will find Malfurion trapped in corrupted vines summoned by [[Xavius]], obviously being tormented. As you approach the circle, a short cutscene will play followed by an in-game cinematic. After the cinematic ends, Xavius will be seen riding away on Ysera's back.

;Cutscene
:''The [[adventurer]] runs in to the inner circle, only to be snared by nightmare roots summoned by Xavius. Ysera is then seen flying towards the group.''
:{{text|say|Xavius|Ahh, the Mother of Dreams has arrived at last.}}

;In-game cinematic
{{#ev:youtube|Y2SC2r0KB_A|Val'sharah Intro}}
:''Xavius prepares the corrupted [[Tears of Elune]] and as Ysera charges to close the distance, magically fires it at her.  It pierces her chest and painfully twists into her body.  A burst of Nightmare energy bursts from the wound and knocks her out of the sky.  Her crash forms a crater in the ground and when she rises, she has been fully corrupted.''

;Cutscene
:''Xavius rides a corrupted Ysera. Laughs and flies away. Tyrande arrives late to the scene.''
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Malfurion! Where is my beloved?}}
