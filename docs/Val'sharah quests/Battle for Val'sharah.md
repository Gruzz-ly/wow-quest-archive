==Objectives==
Defeat Dread Vizier Gra'tork in [[Val'sharah]].

* Speak with [[Jarod Shadowsong]] to begin the final assault
* [[Dread Vizier Gra'tork]] slain

==Description==
From the very start of these attacks I've felt as though the [[demon]]s knew our plans, as if they anticipated our every move. If we are to put an end to this we must focus our attacks at the heart of the beast.

Your efforts have shown these battles are not won by bravery alone, but willingness and sacrifice. I ask that you stand on the battlefield once more among allies to bring this madness to an end.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|14|60|}}
|Antler of Cenarius
}}

==Completion==
You have sacrificed for our lands, brave <class>.

Your perseverance has inspired our brothers and sisters to stand against the [[Burning Legion]].

==Gains==
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Notes==
;Jarod Shadowsong
:These demons will pay for what they have done. This I vow!
:{{gossip|Send me to the forward camp at once! [Queue for Scenario]}}

===Stage 1: Speak with Cenarius===
* Speak with Cenarius to begin the assault.
:The enemy must be stopped at all costs!
:{{gossip|Let's begin the assault.}}

===Stage 2: Secure a Foothold===
* [[Crushfist]] defeated
:{{text|yell|Cenarius|The enemy must be stopped at all costs!}}

===Stage 3: Open the Way===
* Destroy the Fel Centrums powering the barrier

:{{text|say|Cenarius|A wall of fel energy blocks our way into the [[Starstalker's Point|Warden tower]]. Move your team forward and destroy the Legion machines powering the barrier. We will hold this position while you strike.}}


===Stage 4: Moving on Up===
* Reach the top of the tower

:{{text|say|Cenarius|The barrier is down, but the Legion's evil still looms over us. If we secure the tower's apex, the [[Dreamweavers]] will provide the means to reach the demon's vessel.}}


===Stage 5: Lord of the Tower===
* Slay [[Wrath-Lord Akrazar]]

:{{text|say|Cenarius|The key to securing the tower lies in striking  down their leader within. We must take that tower!}}


===Stage 6: Clear the skies===
* Shoot [[Shrieking Hellbat]]s out of the sky

===Stage 7: Up and Away===
* Reach the Legion command ship

:{{text|say|Cenarius|The [[Dreamweavers]] have lent their [[hippogryphs]] to carry you to the Legion's vessel. Eliminate the commander leading this assault, and the rest of these cowardly demons will retreat. Good luck, champions!}}

===Stage 8: Defeat the Legion Commander===
* Eliminate the Legion Commander

:{{text|say|Cenarius|Purge the Legion from our world!}}


===Final Stage: Escape!===
* Jump off the ship

:{{text|say|Cenarius|The Legion is retreating! Leap from their vessel! Trust the hippogryphs to catch you!}}
:''The [[adventurer]]s leap from the ship and are caught by hippogrpyhs.''

The hippogryphs will return you to [[Lorlathil]], where Cenarius awaits. You can leave the scenario group now.

If you died at stage 8 and the other players completed it, the final stage will automatically return you to life in Lorlathil, and you will still get credit for completing the scenario.
