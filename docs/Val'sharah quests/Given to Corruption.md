* [[Varethos]] slain

==Description==
A final favor for an old friend, perhaps?  My age-old companion, Varethos, has fallen to the nightmare's torment.  We once worked in unison to protect this land.  His close ties to the land brought him low in this dark hour.

As with all who suffer this fate, there is no restoring him.

Please, <name>, bring him peace.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
Is it done, then?

==Completion==
My sight fades, but I am glad that he rests.

;Description
<Name>, my friend?

I will muster all the strength that remains in me to locate Malfurion. I only wish I could aid you in his rescue.

Might I call upon you for one last favor? An age-old friend, Varethos, has fallen to the nightmare's torment. We once worked in unison to protect this land. His close ties to the land brought him low in this dark hour.

As with all who suffer this fate, there is no restoring him.

Please, friend, bring him peace.
