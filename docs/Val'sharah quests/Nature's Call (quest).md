==Objectives==
Speak to [[Aranelle]] in [[Lorlathil]].

==Description==
What vile power is this?!

A curse with the strength to paralyze a [[demigod]]? Unimaginable!

Quickly, <name>, you must gather the archdruids of the forest. With their help, we can summon [[Ysera]]. She will surely know what horror has overtaken my mentor.

I will remain here and lend [[Cenarius]] what aid I can.

Return to Lorlathil and speak with Aranelle. She will know the archdruids' whereabouts.

And please, friend, make haste...

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Mana-Infused Berries
|Life-Giving Berries
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|70}}
* 1,550 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
Cenarius is in need? Lord of the Forest, we shall not fail you...

==Notes==
Trace your steps back from the [[Grove of Cenarius]] to the fork in the path. Take the one to the right, which leads around and south towards Lorlathil.
