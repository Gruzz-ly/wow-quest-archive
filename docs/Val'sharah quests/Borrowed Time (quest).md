==Objectives==
Give the Elixir of Suspension to [[Shinfel Blightsworn]].

* Give the Elixir of Suspension to Shinfel
* [[Shimmering Elixir of Suspension]] (provided)

==Description==
Don't let the aroma deceive you, this concoction is mostly safe for consumption.

Whoever is afflicted should drink the entire contents of the vial, every last drop! If the elixir works, the effects should be immediate. If not, well... just tell them they drink at their own risk, alright?

Keep in mind, this will only weaken the curse, not cure it.

==Rewards==

* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Shinfel's curse will kill her soon if we don't find a way to slow its progression.

==Completion==
Killing a demon isn't always the answer. Sometimes, the solution is to control one, or two as the case may be.

If we can summon the sisters and bend their will to ours, it will deliver a devastating blow to [[Mephistroth]]'s forces and rid Shinfel of her curse.
