==Objectives==
Kill 8 Smolderhide furbolgs. 
* [[Smolderhide]] [[furbolg]] slain (8)

==Description==
I would help you seek audience with the [[Archdruid]], but we have a difficult situation on our hands.

The nearby furbolgs have gone into a frenzied rage.

For days, it has been all we can do to protect our grove from their aggression.

They have cut off our access to the barrow dens, where the Archdruid and our clan sleep in the [[Emerald Dream]].

In order to awaken them, we must first get past the furbolg.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
* 14800 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
Did it work?

==Completion==
The conflict against the furbolgs is abated, for now.

==Notes==
Even if you do the Littlefur quest chain first, you will still need to kill the now-neutral furbolgs to complete this one and proceed with the storyline. Sigh.

==Progression==
{{Archdruid of the Claw}}
