Slay Xandris the Dishonored.
* [[Xandris the Dishonored]] slain

==Description==
Xandris the Dishonored was among the first to betray his brethren and accept the curse of [[Xavius]].

During the [[War of the Ancients|great war]], it was he who led the slaughter of many of my comrades. The last time I met him on the battlefield he fled.

Help me to dispense justice on this foul being.

*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
Xandris has finally paid for his crimes, but his blood will not bring back the innocents he has slain.

There is still much work to be done if we are to save my land.
