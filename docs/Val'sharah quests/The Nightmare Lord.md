==Description==
You arrived just in time, friend.

[[Kagraxxis the Corruptor|Kagraxxis]] was moments away from sacrificing me to his master... I was certain I would perish.

I am grateful, but we are not out of danger yet... [[Xavius]] has returned.

The Nightmare Lord is here in [[Val'sharah]], personally orchestrating the corruption of this land. My captor revealed as much to me before I was to be sacrificed.

We must find Thaon Moonclaw and inform him before it is too late!

==Notes==
''After freeing Evelle...''
:{{text|say|Evelle Nightwhisper|Hurry! We must find Thaon before it is too late!}}
''Upon reaching the first passageway of the Archdruid's Den, you see an image of a certain satyr.''
:{{text|say|Image of Xavius|He put up quite a fight, but your archdruid belongs to me now...}}
''Xavius' image dissipates and you go to the bottom area to see that Thaon Moonclaw has been fully corrupted. There is no other choice: Thaon must die.''
:{{text|say|[[Thaon Moonclaw]]|The Nightmare will consume you!}}
:{{text|say|Thaon Moonclaw|Pathetic creature! This curse has made me stronger than the ancients!}}
:{{text|say|Thaon Moonclaw|None can stand against the Nightmare Lord!}}
''As you are making your way back to Evelle, someone speaks through your mind.''
:{{text|bossemote|Time is running out, <name>. You are needed at the Grove of Cenarius... we must act swiftly.}}
