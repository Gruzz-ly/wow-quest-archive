==Objectives==
Collect 5 Corrupted Petals.
* [[Corrupted Petals]] (5)

==Description==
<Name>, my friend. You must succeed where I have failed. You must find our dear [[Malfurion]].

As the [[Emerald Nightmare|Nightmare]] consumes my thoughts, I hear the voices of these twisted trees. I must cling to sanity long enough to aid you.

Venture into [[Ash'theran]] and bring me Corrupted Petals from the fallen denizens there.

With them, I might find your [[Archdruid]] while my mind is still my own.

==Progress==
Ahh... the fear! The panic!

I haven't the strength to fight much longer...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
The waking world is slipping further and further from my mind. But on the vestiges of this corruption consuming my mind, I sense Malfurion!

==Progression==
{{All Nightmare Long}}
