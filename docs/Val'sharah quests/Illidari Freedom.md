'''Illidari Freedom''' is a quest given by [[Arduen Soulblade]] in the [[Darkpens]] area of [[Ravencourt]] in [[Val'sharah]]. It requires completion of [[Black Rook Prison]] before it will become available.

==Objectives==
Free Sirius Ebonwing, Cassiel Nightthorn, and Asha Ravensong.
* [[Sirius Ebonwing]] found
* [[Cassiel Nightthorn]] found
* [[Asha Ravensong]] found

==Description==
<The [[Illidari]] [[demon hunter]] is bleeding from several ghastly wounds. It appears he was left here to die.>

Within the prison are three of my... <cough>... comrades.

We were taken by surprise while scouting the area.

I am not long for this world, but please, save them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*15,070 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
The other Illidari did not make it, but I owe you my life.  There is one thing I learned during my time in the prisons: the [[demon]]s within [[Black Rook Hold]] must die.

;As demon hunter
We mourn together <brother/sister> over the loss of Arduen, Cassiel, and Sirius. But, I owe you my life... again.

There is one thing I learned during my time in the prisons: the demons within Black Rook Hold must die.

==Notes==
* Don't forget to pick up the quest [[Brotherly Love]] while you're here.
* Once freed, Asha Ravensong will disappear but don't worry -- she'll waiting be on the other side of the portal in [[Lieutenant Desdel Stareye]]'s room.
