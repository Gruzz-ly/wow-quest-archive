==Objectives==
Drink from the hag's cauldron to accept her curse. Then you will be able to defeat her sister's restless spirit.
*Drink from the cauldron and release [[Aria Sorrowheart]]'s spirit

==Description==
My three sisters from that tree hung,<br />
The crimes accused there was not one,<br />
The youngest sister did escape,<br />
As the noose looped around their nape,<br />
Old Ravencrest is the one to blame,<br />
This curse for you to lift our shame.<br />

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Hag's Belongings]]

==Progress==
Steel your heart and drink deep,

Return my sister back to sleep.

==Completion==
My dear sister laid to rest,<br />
A tortured hero proves their best,<br />
Today I do lift this curse,<br />
And offer you a token, a small purse,<br />
My other sisters are still gone,<br />
There comes a day to right their wrong...

==Notes==
The [[Crooked Tree Cauldron]] is next to the Hag. Interact with it to change phases and find [[Aria Sorrowheart]]. Defeat her.
