==Objectives==
Slay 10 [[Owlbeast]]s and 8 Undulating Boneslimes within [[Lostlight Grotto]].
* Owlbeast slain (10)
**[[Moonlost Owlbeast]]
**[[Mooncrazed Owlbeast]]
* [[Undulating Boneslime]] slain (8)

==Description==
Owlbeasts are often charged with protecting places of importance to [[Elune]]. But if her influence over them wanes or is cut off, the creatures can become dangerous.

These [[wildkin]], unfortunately, must be dealt with. The recent disturbances in [[Val'sharah]] have driven these creatures to madness.

Once an individual is lost, there is only one way to address the problem.

I cannot bring myself to kill one of Elune's creations, but I know what must be done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
Owlbeasts are fierce protectors and dangerous when lost to us.

==Completion==
I wish it did not have to come to this, truly.

==Progression==
