==Objectives==
Awaken 8 [[Druid of the Claw (Val'sharah)|Druids of the Claw]].
*Druids of the Claw awakened (8)

==Description==
[[Malfurion Stormrage]]... A name I have not heard in centuries.

He was teacher to many of us. If he seeks my audience, I cannot refuse.

I will go to the [[Grove of Cenarius]], but first, we must awaken the rest of my clan. They slumber with no way of waking.

A mysterious force of great power is at work against us.

I am still too weak from my hibernation. Please, stranger, go and free them from their dreams.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
The Druids of the Claw must awaken.  We are needed.

==Completion==
Well done, hero. With my brethren at my side, we will be ready to aid Malfurion.

==Notes==
The druids say these lines upon being awakened:
: {{Text|say|Druid of the Claw|I'm awake, I'm awake...}} (reference to ''[[Warcraft III]]'')
: {{Text|say|Druid of the Claw|I slept well, but my dreams were troubled.}}
: {{Text|say|Druid of the Claw|My dreams felt strange. I fear all is not well in the [[Emerald Dream]].}}
: {{Text|say|Druid of the Claw|Is this world real? Or is the dream the actual reality?}}

==Progression==
{{Archdruid of the Claw}}
