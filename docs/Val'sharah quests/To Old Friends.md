==Objectives==
Kill Corrupted Creatures in [[Moonrest]].
* Kill Corrupted Plants (50)
* Enter [[Darkgrove Cavern]]
* Kill [[Lyrathos Darkgrove|Botanist Darkgrove]]{{sic}}

==Description==
I sense a powerful dark presence here, <name>, but it is not of [[Xavius]]. This feels too familiar.

I sense a druid's touch here, a druid twisted by the shadow of the [[Emerald Nightmare|Nightmare]].

We must deal with this threat if we are to find Xavius. I will take to the skies and lend you my aid.

Find this corrupted druid and cut down his tainted and twisted plants.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Nightvale Mantle
|Sablehide Shoulders
|Thornbrace Spaulders
|Rooksguard Pauldrons
|Nightvale Footwraps
|Sablehide Footwraps
|Thornbrace Boots
|Rooksguard Treads

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
Know this, <name>. You did the only thing you could.

When a mortal has become corrupted by the nightmare, there is no return. Only death will set them free.

==Notes==
Once you have dealt with Lyrathos, leave Darkgrove Cavern and head south to find Ysera.
