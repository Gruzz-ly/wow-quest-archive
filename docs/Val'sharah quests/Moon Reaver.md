==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Boneflux.jpg|Boneflux}}
Defeat [[Boneflux]] and rescue [[Keeper Remulos]] in [[The Undergorge]].
*Boneflux slain
*Keeper Remulos freed

==Description==
We must not delay!  If Keeper Remulos is in danger, he must be protected.

With the dreamcatcher, we should be able to enter the lair of the [[owlbeast]] Boneflux.

It must be defeated so Keeper Remulos can break free!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 reputation with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
My wounds are great, and my [[magic]] has been severely drained. I must recover from this enervation and return to the [[Dreamgrove]].

The [[owlkin]] here are beyond saving by mortal hands, but perhaps [[Elune]] will one day shine [[moonlight|her light]] upon them again.

Thank you, <name>. May your path be blessed.

;Interact with Remulos
Keeper Remulos appears drained and dazed.  The owlbeasts nearly destroyed him.
