==Objectives==
Catch Greyhorn Goats, then return them to their pen.
* [[Greyhorn Goat]]s returned (8)

==Description==
In case you haven't noticed, things are a bit hectic around here.

[[Granny Marl|Marl]]'s doing a good job protecting the corn fields, but the commotion gave our goats quite the scare. They dashed out of their pen as soon as the fighting started, and are now running amuck!

Round them up for me and I'll do my best to figure out how to handle the curse you're dealing with.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found my goats yet?

==Completion==
I can see all my goats have been accounted for.

Now, let's see if we can do something about that curse.

==Progression==
{{Warlock artifact and class hall}}
