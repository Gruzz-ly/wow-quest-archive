==Objectives==
Kill [[Araxxas]] and collect the Prison Keys.
*[[Prison Keys]]

==Description==
I did not come this far to lose her in the final moments.

[[Maiev Shadowsong|Maiev]] must be in the cells beneath [[Black Rook Hold]].

I scouted above, and the entrance to the prison is guarded by a fearsome [[Jailer (demon)|jailor]].

I will sneak past and take out the guards inside. Defeat Araxxas, take the keys, and then meet me within.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*15,070 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
Do you have the keys?

==Completion==
Good, these keys should open any of the cells within the prison.

==Notes==
Follow to find and kill Araxxas for the keys. Once done with that task, go into the enclosure behind him and down the stairs. Jarod will be right in front of you, kneeling next to a dying [[Arduen Soulblade]].
