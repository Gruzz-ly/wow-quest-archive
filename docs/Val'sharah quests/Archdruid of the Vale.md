==Objectives==
Speak with [[Thaon Moonclaw]].

Deep within our forest lies [[Moonclaw Vale]].

There you will find a reclusive group of feral druids charged with the protection of [[Val'sharah]] from any that would seek to disrupt the balance of nature.

These druids are led by Thaon Moonclaw, the most fierce of the Archdruids.

Seek him out. Let him know that [[Cenarius]] is in need of his aid.

You will receive:
