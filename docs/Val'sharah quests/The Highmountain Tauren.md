==Description==
Ye've brought me a bit of interesting rocks to look at, <name>. I've got a special assignment for ye, if ye're up for it.

I hear stories about these [[tauren]], up in Highmountain, who claim mastery over minin'. I don't know if they're as talented as you or me, but they've been minin' [[Leystone Ore|leystone]] longer.

Pay 'em a visit. See what they have to say.

You are indeed a miner. You have the look of it. There is ore in your blood.
