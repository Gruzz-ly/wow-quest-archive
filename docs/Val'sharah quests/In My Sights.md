Recover 10 Deployable Bullet Dispenser Parts around [[Moonrest]].
* [[Deployable Bullet Dispenser Parts]] (10)

==Description==
I used up all me bullets on a wee invention of mine. I call it: Tha Deployable Bullet Dispenser!

Oh aye. It shoots in-der-scriminantly wit'out all that messy and time-consumin' "aiming" or "thinkin'" that us people-folk are wont ta do.

We had deployed quite a few of 'em east o' here when this swarm of plants came a'thrashin from tha trees.

I didn't 'ave time ta go back an' get me turrets. Would ye mind gettin' them back fer me? Or at least, what's left of 'em?

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Schematic: Deployable Bullet Dispenser]]

==Progress==
Those mean greenies better not've touched me dispensers!

==Completion==
Ohhh me poor innocent bullet dispensers! Look what they've done ta yeh.

Well at least they went down shootin', tha's how I'd like ta go.

Ere's tha schematic fer 'em. Deploy 'em near somethun' yeh don't like!
