==Objectives==
Speak to [[Mayor Heathrow]] at [[Bradensbrook]].

==Description==
;Darcy Heathrow
The corpse of [[Darcy Heathrow]] lies before you pierced by several arrows and knife wounds.

In one hand she clutches a note, written with a feeble hand, that reads:

"The dead march on Bradensbrook.

Help us, please!"

;Theo the Huntsman
Another outsider?  Some bloke named [[Jarod Shadowsong|Jarod]] just went off to our village down the road claiming he might be able to help us with our problem.

If you're here to help as well, then you best speak to the Mayor.

Just know this is a bad time, and he's got an itchy trigger finger.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54|}}
*1,480 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
We don't need any help, and we don't like strangers wanderin' around on our land.

==Notes==
Follow the road past Darcy's body until you reach the first large tree that's next to the road on your left. There is a dirt trail just past that tree, which will take you to Bradensbrook. Theo is also along this path.

: ''In town, Jarod Shadowsong and his mount Bard are surrounded by local villagers who are pointing guns and other weapons at him.  Jarod speaks calmly and evenly, but Heathrow is highly suspicious.''
: {{text|say|Jarod Shadowsong|I am not your enemy, Mayor.  I came here to find [[Maiev Shadowsong|someone]] within [[Black Rook Hold]].}}
: {{text|say|Mayor Heathrow|Stop with your lies, night elf.  You'll stay where we can keep an eye on you.}}
