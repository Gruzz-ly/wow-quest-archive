==Objectives==
Speak to [[Jarod Shadowsong]] at [[Ravencrest Mausoleum]].

==Description==
Since [[Maiev Shadowsong|Maiev]] chased after {{Au|Gul'dan}} at the [[Vault of the Wardens]], her sisters among the Wardens have been searching far and wide for her whereabouts.

With so few Wardens remaining, I volunteered to join the search. I hope I will find sign of her within [[Black Rook Hold]].

The fortress will be well guarded, and I will need help to break through. Help me find her, and I will reward you handsomely.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|Warden's Boon
}}

You will also gain:
*{{cost|1|54|}}
*1,510 [[XP]]
*+10 reputation with [[Dreamweavers]]

== Progress ==
Did you have any trouble getting here?

==Completion==
What does the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] want with [[Kur'talos Ravencrest|Ravencrest]]? He was dead and buried ten millennia ago.

==Notes==
;Jarod Shadowsong
:Are you ready to depart to Black Rook Hold?
''{{gossip|I am ready to go.}}''
:''Jarod and the [[adventurer]] mount up on Bard and ride down into the [[Ravencrest Mausoleum]].''
: ''Jarod dismounts at the entrance of the inner tomb and runs up to [[Kur'talos Ravencrest]]'s resting place, but there is no body.''
:{{text|say|Commander Jarod Shadowsong|It is just as I feared. Lord Ravencrest's remains are gone.}}


:The disturbed tomb, demons here at Black Rook Hold, and the enemy night elves are no coincidence.

:The Legion has resurrected Lord Ravencrest.  My former master lives again.
''{{gossip|How did you and your sister get separated?}}''

::Maiev and I chose very different paths in life.

::Not long after the Legion's [[War of the Ancients|first defeat]] on [[Azeroth]], she dedicated her life to the pursuit of justice.

::Some would say she's gone too far in that pursuit at times.

:''{{gossip|What did she do?}}''

:::She [[Wolfheart|murdered innocents]], hoping to sever our people's ties with the [[Alliance]].

:::Still, I couldn't bring myself to kill her.

:::At first I thought I'd been weak -- that love had left me unable to do what was necessary.

::''{{gossip|So why are you trying to save her?}}''

::::I know my sister. She'd never commit such crimes unless she was under some foul influence.

::::Even so, rather than investigate fully, I assumed the worst.

::::I've been a poor brother, but there's still time for me to make things right.

:::''{{gossip|I'll help you find Maiev.}}''

==Progression==

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}

==Beta version==
;Interaction
:[[Sira Moonwarden|Sira]] and the other [[Warden]]s are doing everything they can to find Maiev.

:The attack on the [[Vault of the Wardens]] was devastating. Of hundreds, only a handful survived.

:But the Wardens are tough as steel. They will survive.
