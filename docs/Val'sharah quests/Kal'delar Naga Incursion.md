==Objectives==
* [[Murkwater]] [[Naga]] slain (12)
* [[Murkwater Standard]] burned (6)
* [[Murkwater Oracle]] slain (3)

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Celestine of the Harvest]]|Naga have overrun the ruins of [[Kal'delar]]. If they're allowed to gain a foothold, they could threaten the entire coastline.}}

==Gains==
* +75 reputation with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
: {{text|say|Celestine of the Harvest|Thank you. It is easy to ignore such threats until it is too late to pust them back.}}

==Notes==
Oracles also count toward the naga total. They're usually in tents or the stone ruins. You can 'pick up' a [[Deepsteel Trident]] to use on a [[Murkwater Behemoth]] and take out half of its HP if you so choose. If you can handle it, you can find four [[Murkwater Warrior]]s dueling in close pairs.

There are a few standards that are on the extreme edge of the quest area that have to approached from the right direction, otherwise you'll leave the area and it'll disappear (but even if it didn't, burning it wouldn't count). There is at least one on an eastern road that cannot be reached, so keep this in mind before wasting your time.

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
