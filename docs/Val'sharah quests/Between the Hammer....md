==Objectives==
Bring Saris' Hammer back to his shop.
* [[Saris' Hammer]]

==Description==
<Name>, I fear that my [[ghost|spirit]] will remain bound to this place unless I am made whole again.

Long ago, I discovered a cave near the coast behind [[Black Rook Hold]]. I explored the cave only to find an abominable creature that attacked me, causing me to drop my hammer as I fled.

I need that hammer back if I am to be at peace.

==Rewards==
You will learn: Recipe: [[Leystone Waistguard]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|80|}}
* 1,620 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Any luck retrieving my hammer?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Words cannot express what this means to me.

And as promised, here is a gift of knowledge to you.

==Notes==
The cave, [[Leygazer's Den]], is at {{Co|36|53|Val'sharah}}.
