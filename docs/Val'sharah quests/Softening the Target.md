Slay 50 Nightmare Creatures in [[Shala'nir]] riding the [[Subdued Nightwing]]. 
*Nightmare Creatures slain (50)

==Description==
The [[Archdruid]]'s end draws near. His memory will live on in the hearts of all who knew him.

[[Elothir]]'s desperate efforts revealed that [[Malfurion]] is being held in [[Shala'nir]], amidst the roots of [[Shaladrassil]].

My love. So near, yet so far....

Shala'nir is infested with [[Emerald Nightmare|Nightmare]] creatures. To rush in would be suicide.

I subdued one of [[Xavius]]' creatures. Use it against him, <name> and clear us a path.

You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
Have you managed to thin their numbers?

==Completion==
This place remains deadly, but we can now press forward.

==Notes==
