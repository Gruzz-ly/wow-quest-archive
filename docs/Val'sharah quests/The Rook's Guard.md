==Objectives==
Kill Kester Farseeker, Trelan Shieldbreaker, and Starlys Strongbow.
* [[Starlys Strongbow]] slain
* [[Kester Farseeker]] slain
* [[Trelan Shieldbreaker]] slain

==Description==
[[Black Rook Hold]] is not the same place I knew. Its walls have crumbled, a ghostly echo of its former glory.

If [[Kur'talos Ravencrest|Lord Ravencrest]] has returned, then surely he will have his former officers at his side.

Kester Farseeker, captain of the guard.

Trelan Shieldbreaker, peerless swordsman and weaponsmith.

Starlys Strongbow, who could split arrows while blindfolded.

If we stand any chance of entering the tower itself, they must be eliminated.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*15,070 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
Warriors and fighters came from across [[Kaldorei Empire|kaldorei lands]] to pledge loyalty to Master Ravencrest.  We would have followed him to the ends of the earth.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. May their spirits be at peace.

==Notes==
Before starting out on this quest, make sure you picked up [[Maiev's Trail]]!

Beginning with [[Starlys Strongbow]], travel back up the sets of staircases and immediately go left around the large pillar to find her. Kill Starlys and investigate the nearby prison cage for the first clue. Head slightly east on the minimap and then due south. Go up the stairs, where [[Kester Farseeker]] will be waiting front of you in his room. Kill him and investigate the parchment that's to the side of the room for the second clue.

Now go back as if you were heading for Starlys, except this time take the path on the right at the intersection. Go down those stairs and turn left to find [[Trelan Shieldbreaker]] pacing back and forth in his work area. Kill him and investigate the [[Warden's Glaive]] that is located next to an armor stand towards the back of the work area for the final clue.

Once done with all that, go back up the nearby stairs and follow the path left until you go up the stairs there, then go left and keep following it until you reach the main intersection of [[Ravencourt]]. Jarod Shadowsong will be awaiting you there.
