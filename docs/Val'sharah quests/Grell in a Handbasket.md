==Objectives==
*[[Wildeyed Undergrell]] slain (10)
*[[Moist Grizzleberries]] destroyed (8)
*[[Enderkind]] slain

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Koda Steelclaw]]|The [[grell]] usually keep to themselves, but they've grown bold of late. They're attacking the [[Grizzleweald tribe|Grizzleweald furbolg tribe]]! I fear they'll soon overrun the entire [[Grizzleweald|village]].}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
: {{text|say|Koda Steelclaw|Peace must be maintained in this forest. The Grizzleweald have long been allies of the people of Val'sharah, and worthy of the help you provided.}}

==Notes==
*Triggers at Grizzleweald in Val'sharah.
*On foot, you'll probably have to fight through the grells to get to Enderkind, so don't worry about getting that count. Destroy the grizzleberries on the way, but there are also some near [[Old Grizzleback]] that are easy to get to.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
