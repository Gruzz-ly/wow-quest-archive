==Objectives==
Kill 8 Darkfiend Intruders. 
* Darkfiend Intruders slain (8)

==Description==
Something, someone, intended us to never awaken. I sense their presence is still here in the barrow.

<Koda takes a moment to stand.>

My body is weak from deep slumber.

If you would aid us, clear our barrow of any enemies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
This was no accident.  Someone intended us to sleep forever.

==Completion==
Excellent. The chambers are clear. Very impressive, <class>.
