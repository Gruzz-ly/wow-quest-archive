==Objectives==
Try to find the whereabouts of a tailor in [[Val'sharah]] who can help you mend the silk.
* Talk with the [[Temple Priestess|Priestess]]
* [[Torn Shal'dorei Silk]] (provided)

==Description==
Bringing back the cloth in such a manner would not be beneficial to [[Deucus Valdera|Deucus]].

Perhaps there's a [[tailor]] here in Val'sharah who'd be willing to mend it for you.

The priestess who helped you earlier may know of such a person.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 16,170 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Leyweaver Erenyi seems lost in thought.>

==Completion==
You dare request such a menial task from me? Surely you must be joking.

==Notes==
;Speaking with the Temple Priestess
:Are you in need of healing?

:{{Gossip|Would you happen to know of a tailor in these parts?}}
:{{Text|say|Temple Priestess|A leyweaver from [[Suramar]] came through here not too long ago. I believe she headed east towards the [[Sylvan Falls]].}}
