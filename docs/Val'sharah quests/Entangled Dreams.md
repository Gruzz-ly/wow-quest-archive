==Objectives==
Kill Morphael. 

* [[Morphael]] slain

==Description==
I sense powerful magic emanating from deep within the barrow.

Whatever is down there weaves a powerful spell, entangling us within our dreams.

I am still too weak, but your skills are quite impressive, hero. I can see why [[Malfurion]] puts his trust in you.

Go and eliminate the source of this magic.

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
Someone entangled us within a sinister spell.

==Completion==
In my dreams, I saw the satyr's leader. His face was familiar, though I could not see it clearly.

I pray to [[Elune]] that it is not too late. I will go to Malfurion at once.
