==Objectives==
Find Mad Ernie the Alchemist in [[Val'sharah]].
* Find [[Ernest Carlisle|Mad Ernie]] in Val'sharah.

==Description==
If we have any hope of curing this curse, we need to know what kind of magic we're dealing with.

I know of an [[alchemist]] who earned himself quite the reputation for his unconventional methods. Shunned from [[Gilneas peninsula|Gilneas]] long ago, I believe Mad Ernie has taken up residence in these lands.

His knowledge may be the first step to breaking this curse.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you come to lend a hand? We all must do our part.

==Completion==
That's a name I thought I'd never hear again.

We may have worked together in the past, but Ritssyn needs to know I'm not the man I was before.

My priorities are [[Granny Marl|Marl]] and this [[Marl's Stead|farm]].

==Notes==
Fly to [[Bradensbrook]] in Val'sharah and head to [[Marl's Stead]].

:Those undead invaders put up quite a fight, but Marl and I won't let the farm be taken.

:{{gossip|Are you Mad Ernie?}}
::Shhh! Keep your voice down.

::I haven't gone by that name in years. I gave up the practice of alchemy some time ago, in favor of a calm life here on the farm.

::What business do you have with "Mad Ernie" anyway?.

::{{gossip|Ritssyn sent me. We need help curing a doom curse.}}
:::{{text|emote|Ernest Carlisle sighs.}}
