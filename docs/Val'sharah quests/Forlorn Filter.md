==Objectives==
Speak with a [[Temple Priestess]] at the [[Temple of Elune (Val'sharah)|Temple of Elune]] to see if you can acquire some [[Shal'dorei Silk|Shaldorei Silk]].
* Speak with the Temple Priestess

==Description==
Next on the list of things to replace are my filters. Now I'm sure you've concluded that an alchemist of my caliber uses only the finest of tools when mixing my potions.

The [[night elf|elves]] at the Temple of Elune in [[Val'sharah]] use Shaldorei silk to craft their robes. Perhaps they'd be willing to part with some for my filters.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 16,170 [[XP]]

==Progress==
A pile of tattered shaldorei silk lay on the chest.

==Completion==
This Shaldorei Silk appears to be torn into strips. The elves have apparently been using it as [[bandage]]s for their fallen warriors.

==Notes==
;Speaking with the Temple Priestess
:Are you in need of healing?

:{{Gossip|I'm looking for some Shaldorei Silk. Do you have any to spare?}}
:{{Text|say|Temple Priestess|Why yes, we do. There's some on that chest over there. But we're in short supply, so please don't take too much.}}
