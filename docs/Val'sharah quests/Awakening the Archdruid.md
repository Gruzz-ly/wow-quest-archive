==Objectives==
Awaken the [[Koda Steelclaw|Archdruid of the Claw]].

==Description==
Now, we must focus our efforts on waking Archdruid Steelclaw.

She and our [[druid]] brethren slumber in the [[barrow den]]s to the south.

With the [[furbolg]]s quelled, we can pass safely to the entrance.

Go and awaken the Archdruid. I pray to [[Elune]] that we are not too late.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*14800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
<The Archdruid's deep, shallow breaths rumble across the chamber.>

==Notes==
On accept:
: {{Text|say|Rylissa Bearsong|We'll tend to the wounded up here. Go quickly. Wake the Archdruid.}}

As of [[patch 7.0.3]], Koda is not where the quest marker is in on the quest log map! Instead, turn right at the first intersection and go to the northern part of the cave, where the quest arrow points on the minimap.

On complete:
: {{Text|say|Koda Steelclaw|The [[Emerald Dream|Dream]] was clouded with such darkness...}}

==Progression==
{{Archdruid of the Claw}}
