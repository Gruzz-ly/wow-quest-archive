Slay 10 Wormtalon Harpies in [[Shadowfen]].

Kill them, <race>. They deserve nothing less for feeding on the misery of others.

==Progress==
Have you taken vengeance for us, yet?

Such violence should not be necessary. Thank you, regardless.

==Notes==
Killing any of the [[Wormtalon Witch]]es and [[Wormtalon Huntress]]es will count as credit towards the quest.
