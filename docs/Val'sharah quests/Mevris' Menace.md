==Objectives==
Collect Brilliant Azure Scales.

* [[Brilliant Azure Scales]]

==Description==
There is a [[hydra]] that has been something of a nuisance for us as of late. It lives out on the [[Gloaming Reef]], almost directly due west of here.

It's been attacking ships that pass by, making it difficult to get supplies to and from [[Bradensbrook]].

I sent a [[Night Elf Corpse (Val'sharah)|team]] to handle it, but they haven't returned.

Go out there, kill it, and take its scales to [[Daniss Ghostdancer|Daniss]].

And when you see her, tell her that I said...

<Mevris pauses as he thinks of his words, and the meaning they carry.>

Nothing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you met with [[Mevris Ghostdancer|Mevris]]?

==Completion==
<After hearing your retelling of Mevris' plan, Daniss nods thoughtfully.>

I'm glad you were able to assist him. He has been gone for some time now. Hopefully with this creature now deceased, there is one less obstacle before he can come home.

And good work with the scales. These appear to be perfect for the task.

==Notes==
Travel west to the northern-most island on the map where the Gloaming Reef area is. You should find a [[Gluttonous Hydra]] feasting on three [[Night Elf Corpse (Val'sharah)|Night Elf Corpses]].
