==Objectives==
Close the [[Unstable Portal]]s and make your way to [[Broxigar the Red]].

==Description==
Broxigar the Red is cornered on the bridge. I am not sure he would ever admit that he needs our help, but I feel it only proper to lend him our aid.

If you wish to assist our ally, I would be humbled to accompany you in this endeavor.

*{{cost|19|40}}

Our allies are strong, but our enemy is Legion!
