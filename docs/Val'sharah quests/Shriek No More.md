==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Rotbeak.jpg|Rotbeak}}
Find Rotbeak along the Bradensbrook, and collect the beast's head.
*[[Rotbeak's Head]]

==Description==
[[Papa Radcliffe|Papa]] loved this village. He'd never hear of leaving, even in these dread times.

Before he died, he told me what attacked him: a monstrous falcon we call [[Rotbeak]].

You're fighting these undead, aren't you? Will you avenge my father? If so, you can find the beast northwest of here, patrolling our western route to the sea.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Band of Sablehide
|Bonefeather Talisman
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]
*[[Recipe: Deep-Fried Mossgill]]

==Progress==
Papa always said the only way he'd leave here would be feet-first.

I wish he'd been wrong.

==Completion==
Thank you. Grisly, eh? I think I'll mount it over the door.

I want you to have this, too. Fresh-caught mossgill was Papa's favorite.
