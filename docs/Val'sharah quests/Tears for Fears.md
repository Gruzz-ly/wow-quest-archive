==Objectives==
Retrieve the Tears of Elune.
*[[Tears of Elune]] found

==Description==
The Tears of Elune are a sacred artifact, protected by my order for thousands of years. I tell you this so that you may understand the gravity of your request.

That said, [[Ysera]] is noble and wise and I trust in her guidance. You will find the tears in a vault at the eastern edge of the temple grounds.

Proceed with caution though, as that area has been overrun by [[demon]]s.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Radiant Charm of Elune
|Darkfiend Dreadbringer Horn
|Temple Priestess' Charm
|Vibrant Temple Masonry
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
Do you have the Tears of Elune?

==Completion==
[[Xavius]] has stolen our sacred artifact?

[[Elune]], forgive me. I have failed you.

==Notes==
:''As the [[adventurer]] approaches the small chest that contains the Tears of Elune, it becomes clear that someone else has reached it first...''
