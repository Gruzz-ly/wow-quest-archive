==Objectives==
Find [[Maiev Shadowsong]] in [[Black Rook Prison]].
* [[Maiev's Belongings]] (provided)

==Description==
Maiev will be somewhere in the prison.  I found her discarded armor on my way here.

Let's split up to search the cells more quickly.

We must find her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*15,070 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
<Maiev's face is bruised, her lips cracked, and her body covered in scars. She looks thin and ragged, but she moves with purpose.>

For weeks they tried to break me. Amateurs!

I kept my silence. I counted the minutes, measured their steps, and listened to the voices beyond my cell.

I have been waiting for my chance to escape, and to strike back at my captors.

Now, you bring my armor AND my [[Warden's Glaive|blade]]. My salvation will be followed by bloodshed.

<Maiev smiles.>

Now, you bring my armor AND my blade. It's your turn to set me free, demon hunter. Let us destroy the Legion together.

<Maiev smiles.>

==Notes==
Enter the cell passageway and take the first path on the left. Follow it straight on through until you're at Maiev's cell.
