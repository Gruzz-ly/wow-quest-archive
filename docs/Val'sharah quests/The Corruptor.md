==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Kagraxxis the Corruptor.jpg|Kagraxxis the Corruptor}}
* Enter [[Moonclaw Cavern]]
* Slay [[Kagraxxis the Corruptor]]

==Description==
[[Xandris the Dishonored|Xandris]] has been slain, but there are others that must be dealt with if my grove is to be saved.

During the [[War of the Ancients|great war]], Kagraxxis took great pleasure in corrupting the lands he once called home.

Were it not for the foolish mercy of my fellow druids, I would have slain him myself.

Find the demon and bring justice upon him.

I must entrust this task to you alone, for I sense an even [[Xavius|darker presence]] here... one that requires my personal attention.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
Kagraxxis must be slain.

==Completion==
You have my thanks, <class>.

If not for your arrival I would have surely perished here.
