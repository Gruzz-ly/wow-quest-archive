Speak to [[Littlefur]] at [[Smolderhide Thicket]].

==Description==
Stranger, I beseech you! My once peaceful brethren are now cursed with insatiable wrath.

My nephew and I tried to leave against the [[Chieftain Graw|Chieftain]]'s wishes. The clan wrested him from me, and would have torn me apart if I did not flee.

He is trapped in the village, and I fear the worst.

Great <class>, please save him. I am too old and too weak to do it myself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54|}}
* 1480 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
Uncle?
