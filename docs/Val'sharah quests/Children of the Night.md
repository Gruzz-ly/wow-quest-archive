==Objectives==
Kill 12 [[Risen Assassin]]s, [[Black Rook Falcon]]s, or [[Risen Hound]]s.
* Black Rook enemies slain (12)

==Description==
I am no enemy to these people, but there is no convincing them of that.

Their [[Bradensbrook|village]] has come under attack by some very old friends of mine. Friends who are no longer... living.

There's no telling who or what controls them, but in life these noble soldiers would never engage in such acts. That's a mystery for another time.

For now, help me earn the trust of these villagers. Strike down the Black Rook enemies who are terrorizing their citizens.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*15,070 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
The attackers are night elves, yes, but they are not the same night elves I once knew.

==Completion==
Good. These villagers have done nothing to deserve these attacks. You have done well to help them.

==Notes==
