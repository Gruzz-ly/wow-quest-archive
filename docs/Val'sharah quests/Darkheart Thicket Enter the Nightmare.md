We could not save [[Ysera]], but we did prevent her from destroying the [[Temple of Elune (Val'sharah)|temple]].

Now I can finally turn my attention to my husband.

I do not know what fate he suffers now.  I only know that if we stand any chance of saving him, you must go now.

Follow [[Xavius]] into the [[Emerald Nightmare|Nightmare]] and find [[Malfurion Stormrage|Malfurion]].

Please, save my husband if you can.

Praise [[Elune]] and all that her light touches... Malfurion is alive.

I thought I would spend the rest of my days alone, dreaming of the choices I did not make.

Thank you. Thank you for returning my love to me.
