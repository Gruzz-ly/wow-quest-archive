==Objectives==
Use the Nightborne Flask to craft an Ysera's Dream Draught.
*[[Ysera's Dream Draught]]
*[[Nightborne Flask]] (provided)

==Description==
From the look of you, I take it you're an [[alchemist]], yes?

I'd be willing to trade my services with you for a price that I deem is fair.

I have been away from [[Suramar]] for some time now. I long for an Ysera's Dream Draught. To concoct it, you'll need some [[:dreamleaf]] as well as the leaves of a [[Dreamer's Tear]].

One grows not to far from here in the clearing of some ruins. Take my flask, make this drink for me, and I'll do as you ask.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 16,170 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<[[Leyweaver Erenyi]] seems lost in thought.>

==Completion==
You've crafted this rather well. I'm slightly impressed.

Now let me see that silk of yours...

==Notes==
[[Dreamer's Tear Leaves]] are looted from [[Dreamer's Tear]] in [[Ashamane's Fall]] {{coords|73|38|Val'sharah}} behind [[Leafbeard the Storied]].
