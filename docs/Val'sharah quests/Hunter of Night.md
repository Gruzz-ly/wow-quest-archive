Defeat Malvingeroth

==Description==
A glorious battle indeed!

If I am correct, we can expect something a bit more deadly at any moment.

The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] often uses fodder such as these to prepare the way for a more worthy foe.

[[Axe of Cenarius|My axe]] is sharp and ready.

The [[ghost|spirits]] honor us with a day of glorious combat! You have my well-earned respect, [[Illidan Stormrage]]. I will gladly follow you into any battle.

==Notes==
Upon accept, a cutscene plays out. On the other side of the bridge, a pit lord comes forth from a portal. Malvingeroth laughs.
