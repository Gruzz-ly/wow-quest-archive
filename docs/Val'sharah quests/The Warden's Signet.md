==Objectives==
Take the Warden's Signet to Jarod Shadowsong.
*[[Warden's Signet]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Lelyn Swiftshadow|night elf]] was carrying a signet engraved with the crest of the [[Warden]]s.

The band, made from a silvery, unbreakable metal, has been worn down by time, as if absently twisted and rubbed against its owner's finger.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54|}}
*1,510 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Jarod gazes at the ring for a long minute before closing his hands around it. He puts the ring in a pocket.>

This is [[Maiev Shadowsong|Maiev's]] ring. She would never part with it.

She must be at [[Black Rook Hold]]!
