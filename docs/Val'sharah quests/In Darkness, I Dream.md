==Objectives==
Meet [[Merithra]] at the [[Temple of Elune (Val'sharah)|Temple of Elune]] in [[Val'sharah]].

==Description==
The [[green dragonflight]] calls for aid. The [[Emerald Dream]], which they have watched over for eons, has been invaded by terrible creatures of the [[Void]].

Merithra of the Dream is attempting to combat the threat, but she cannot do so alone. If you seek to empower the [[:Heart of Azeroth]] with the strength of the green dragonflight, you must first help Merithra save it.

Meet her at the Temple of Elune in Val'sharah, and assist her however you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}

==Completion==
Thank you for coming, champion. My [[Ysera|mother]] once placed her trust in mortals, and I find that I must call upon them once again. 

I simply do not know how to fight this battle on my own.
