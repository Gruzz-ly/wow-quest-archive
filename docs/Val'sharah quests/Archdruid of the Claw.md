==Objectives==
Locate [[Steelclaw Vale]].

==Description==
Near the southern edge of our forest you will find [[Sleeper's Barrow]].

There, [[Archdruid]] [[Koda Steelclaw]] and her dedicated disciples carry out their sacred duty to observe the [[Emerald Dream]].

Find disciple [[Rylissa Bearsong]] in Steelclaw Vale and notify her of the crisis in the [[Grove of Cenarius]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94}}
* 1480 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
The forest already whispers of [[Malfurion]]'s return. There are few among us who have not heard of his deeds.

The trees said he also travels with a companion, one named <name>. Are you <he/she>?

==Notes==
Upon approaching Rylissa:
: ''Rylissa is by [[Tenno Thornpaw]], who has a large arrow in the flank.''
