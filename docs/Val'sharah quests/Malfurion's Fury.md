==Objectives==
Speak with [[Ysera]] to search for Malfurion.
*Ride Ysera to the Nightmare

==Description==
The loss of [[Cenarius]] to the nightmare is a devastating blow to us all.

Though [[Malfurion Stormrage|Malfurion]]'s rage is justified, his hatred of [[Xavius]] has burned for centuries and I fear that his blind rage will be used as a weapon against him.

May [[Elune]] guide us in our search for him, lest we have yet another friend to mourn today.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
Oh, <name>...

What is becoming of this precious land?

==Notes==
Speak to Ysera:
{{Dialogue|
Do not tarry, <race>. We cannot afford to squander such time.

{{gossip|I am ready, Ysera. We must find Malfurion!}}
}}
''As you ride Ysera while she flies to the edge of [[The Crescent Vale]] where it meets [[Moonrest]], Ysera briefly converses with you.''
:{{text|say|Ysera|Rage has blinded Malfurion. He and Xavius have a long history of conflict.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|Even he cannot hope to defeat Xavius alone. We must find him at once.}}

==Progression==
{{Into the Nightmare}}
