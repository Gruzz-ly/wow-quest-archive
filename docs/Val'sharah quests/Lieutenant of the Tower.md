{{questportrait|Lieutenant Desdel Stareye.jpg|Lieutenant Desdel Stareye|Second-in-command to Lord Ravencrest.}}
Kill Desdel Stareye.
* [[Lieutenant Desdel Stareye]] slain

==Description==
All of your instincts were correct. {{Au|Gul'dan}} raised [[Kur'talos Ravencrest|Lord Ravencrest]], and his ghostly army, from beyond the grave. Now, they serve the [[Burning Legion|Legion]], protecting secrets within the tower.

Although Ravencrest commands from above, Lieutenant Desdel Stareye operates the prisons.

He tormented me these past few moons, but I did not yield.

<Maiev runs a finger along her curved blade.>

His life must be ended.

==Completion==
Lord Stareye came from a noble house, but in [[War of the Ancients|war]], he never came close to Ravencrest or my brother.

Now that he is defeated, we can turn our attention to his commander.

However, that will be no easy task. We must gather our strength before facing Lord Ravencrest himself.

==Notes==
From Maiev's prison cell, go straight until you reach the first fork in the corridor. Go left, up the stairs, and left again to find Stareye's room.
