==Objectives==
Use [[Fargo Flintlocke|Flintlocke]]'s Gunpowder Charges to kill 15 [[Shimmering Oleander]]s.
* Shimmering Oleander Exploded (15)
* [[Gunpowder Charges]] (provided)

==Description==
If yer gonna wander inta these woods, ye'll be wantin' somethin' with some punch. These plants are a might grabby.

I've got me special explosive charges here that should send those fertilizer mutations back to the dirt.

Take 'em with yeh and give them viney beasties a what-fer!

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Schematic: Gunpowder Charge]]

==Progress==
Just wait 'til yeh see tha whites of their... uh... petals afore yeh throw the charges at 'em.

==Completion==
Quite tha weed killer, eh? Haha!

I figure ye'll be wantin' more of them charges so I went ahead an' wrote down tha schematic fer ye.

I figure it's always good ta keep them plants an' trees in line when they get all uppity.
