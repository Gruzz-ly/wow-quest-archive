==Description==
<Name>, you have returned.  Good.

I have counseled with the other archdruids and concluded that [[Cenarius]]' condition is merely a symptom of a [[Emerald Nightmare|much greater problem]].  Your experiences in [[Moonclaw Vale]] make that clear.

We need help.

There is one who can bring understanding to these events.  With [[Thaon Moonclaw|Thaon]] gone, we must ask that you aid us in reaching out to the Lady of Dreams.
