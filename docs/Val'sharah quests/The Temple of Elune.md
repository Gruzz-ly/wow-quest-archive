==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lyanis Moonfall]] at the [[Temple of Elune (Val'sharah)|Temple of Elune]].
*[[Seal of Ysera]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Cenarius]] is in danger.

If his condition is not reversed soon, he will be lost to the Nightmare that threatens the [[Emerald Dream]]. To spare him that fate, we must have the [[Tears of Elune]] - the same relic you were sent here to retrieve.

[[Elune]]'s temple is not far. Go there. Find Lyanis. Show her my seal and instruct her to release the tears into your custody.

Hurry, <name>. Time is short.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|4|15}}
*1,480 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
You - you bear the mark of The Dreamer. Elune be praised!

You've arrived just in time, visitor. [[Shaladrassil]]'s roots are at our doorstep...

==Notes==
Take the trail east out of the [[Grove of Cenarius]] until you reach the main path, then follow that north to reach the Temple of Elune. Go to the main courtyard and take the stairs to the left. Keep going straight and then a bit around the statue to enter the inner sanctum of the temple, where Lyanis Moonfall is located.
