==Objectives==
Return to [[Malfurion Stormrage]] at the [[Grove of Cenarius]] in [[Val'sharah]].

==Description==
Forgive me, <race>. Archdruid Moonclaw's fall is a terrible blow...

Malfurion must be informed of what has transpired here. Inform him of Thaon's fate and of the return of Xavius.

Make haste, friend. I fear this may be the greatest threat Val'sharah has ever faced.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
*1480 [[XP]]
*10 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
Thaon will be dearly missed. We may not have always seen eye to eye, but he was a great druid and a true protector of the vale.

Xavius will pay for his death...

==Notes==
