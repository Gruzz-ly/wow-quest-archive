==Notes==
;Tyrande
:We go to the [[Temple of Elune (Val'sharah)|Temple of Elune]]. We will ride more swiftly on [[Ash'alah]]'s back. Are you ready to depart?

''{{gossip|I am ready.}}''

:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Come with me. [[Ysera]] won't stop until this whole realm is plunged into the [[Emerald Nightmare|Nightmare]].}}
:''The [[adventurer]] joins Tyrande on [[Ash'alah]] and they ride for the temple.''
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|[[Xavius]] is using Malfurion to bait me, to distract me from what must be done. We are the only ones who can stop Ysera.}}
:''Tyrande grows emotional with memories.''
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Ah, Malfurion, my beloved! For a hundred hundred years he slept beneath [[Moonglade]].}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Whenever I was plagued with doubt, I would descend into his barrow. I watched over him as he slept.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Even in slumber, his presence calmed me. I left my fears below the earth and emerged, ready to lead my people.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|When Malfurion returned to my side, we worked as one. As if he had never been away. Have you ever loved as I have?}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Now Xavius has me by the throat. I must abandon my beloved, and subdue the most beautiful creature I have ever known.}}
:''They reach the main courtyard of the temple. [[Lyanis Moonfall]] and [[Koda Steelclaw]] are fighting Ysera with the aid of temple [[Temple Guard|guards]], [[Priestess of Elune (Legion)|priestesses]], and [[Temple Archer|archers]]. Tyrande follows the adventurer to join the fight.''

;Aggro
:''Whenever Ysera speaks, she sounds crazed and fanatical.''
:{{text|say|Ysera|This is your end, mortals. The [[Emerald Dream|Dream]] is undone!}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Not while I still draw breath.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Koda, keep her distracted. Lyanis, mend our wounds. Champion - with me!}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Are you truly lost, Ysera? After ''all'' we have built? ''All'' we have done?}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|My eyes are open at last, priestess. I see night eternal.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|The Nightmare consumes ''all''!}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|By the light of Elune, we will ''end'' this madness!}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|I will end your torment, Dreamer. And I promise we will avenge you.}}

:''[[Nightsong]] is heard in the background as Ysera falls to the floor of the Temple of Elune with one last roar, as Tyrande looks at her with regret. The Dreamer raises her head and looks up at the sky with a moan of pain, which darkens as the [[White Lady]] moves in front of the sun, creating a sudden solar eclipse. Lit only by the corona of the sun, Ysera's eyes change from dark red back to emerald green.''
:''Tendrils of lunar light extend down from the moon to Ysera, who lowers her head back to the ground.  As the light suffuses her body, it goes slack as the muscles release and she settles further to the ground; there is a feeling of acceptance as she finally succumbs to death and closes her eyes. The lunar beams gently lift Ysera's spirit, looking as if sleeping, from her mortal coil and into the sky, as the night elves watch in astonishment. With the neck extended to a curve and the wings lifted open to full extension, her spirit dissipates in the sky, the general outline indicated by new stars lighting up &mdash; a new constellation.''
:''The tendrils of moonbeam retreat into the corona and the solar eclipse passes; the night elves momentarily squint at the sudden return of daylight. Tyrande watches solemnly as Ysera's body literally fades in the returning sunlight: the ground blossoms with fresh grass and plants where the corpse touched the ground. From where it had pierced her chest a sapling grows among the grass, revealing the corrupted Tear of Elune, which then sheds off its Nightmare taint into red dust, becoming purified. The night elves lower their heads in sadness and respect as silence falls over the temple grounds.''

Once the quest is completed, be sure to pick up [[The Tears of Elune]] from the [[Tear of Elune]], next to Tyrande Whisperwind, at the temple.
