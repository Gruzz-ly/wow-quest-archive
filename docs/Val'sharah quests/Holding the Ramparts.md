==Objectives==
Scout the demonic presence atop [[Black Rook Hold]].

* Passage to ramparts acquired
* Legion Forces repelled
* Reach the top of Black Rook Hold
* [[General Zeonar]] defeated
* Report to [[Jarod Shadowsong]] atop the terrace in Black Rook Hold

==Description==
With their ground presence weakened the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] has retaliated with additional forces.

Our allies managed to track several of these demons to the skies above Black Rook. I fear they intend to establish a foothold.

Take this [[hippogryph]] and scout the ramparts. Should this fear become a reality I ask that you deal with the threat swiftly.

==Completion==
Our victory here is well deserved. With their forces subdued we can press our attacks to the forward camp and the monstrosity on the horizon.
