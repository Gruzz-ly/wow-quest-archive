==Objectives==
Go to [[Black Rook Hold]] and search for Saris Swifthammer.
* Find [[Saris Swifthammer]]

==Description==
<Name>, have you heard of Saris Swifthammer?

He was a legendary [[Smith|blacksmith]] amongst the [[night elf|elves]] of Black Rook Hold. I wonder if any of his research still exists.

I want you to travel there and see if you can discover anything about Saris, or see if he left anything we can research here at my shop.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|86|}}
* 1,620 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you again for freeing me, stranger. I see you wish to discuss the art of blacksmithing.

==Notes==
Click on the [[Ancient Anvil]].

:{{Text|say|Saris Swifthammer|Here to pillage our wares, demon?! You shall take NOTHING!}}

The ghost of Saris appears as {{Rep|unfriendly}} and walks towards the player and turns {{Rep|hostile}}.

:{{Text|say|Saris Swifthammer|Wait! Stop! You're... you're no demon...}}
:{{Text|say|Saris Swifthammer|The fog has lifted and I can see the truth once more. Thank you, monk. If you would join me at my old shop, perhaps we can speak further.}}

After his defeat, he turns {{Rep|neutral}} and kneels.
