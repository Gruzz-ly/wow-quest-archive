==Objectives==
Destroy the [[Nightmare Totem]].
* Nightmare Totem destroyed

==Description==
I heard the others talking earlier. I may know the cause of their fear.

They say the Chieftain has a mysterious totem. It gives him power, and fearful visions.

If you destroy the totem, the madness will end.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Nightvale Cord
|Sablehide Belt
|Thornbrace Waistguard
|Rooksguard Girdle
|Nightvale Gloves
|Sablehide Handguards
|Thornbrace Grips
|Rooksguard Grips
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14800 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
The totem works its magic on anyone who touches it.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>! My nephew is returned to me.

He explains that the source of the madness comes from a powerful totem, deep in our village. 

It makes sense, but who - or WHAT - gave us such a thing?

I will share this knowledge with the druids at once.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Littlefur|I go to my uncle. Thank you, kind stranger!}}

Upon approaching the Nightmare Totem:
:{{Text|say|[[Chieftain Graw]]|The power of the totem is mine. You won't take it!}}

Chieftain Graw drops [[Chieftain's Beads]], which start the side quest [[The Chieftain's Beads]].

==Progression==
{{Archdruid of the Claw}}
