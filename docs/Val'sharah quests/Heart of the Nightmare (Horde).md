==Objectives==
Track Malfurion's path through the Nightmare.
*Follow Malfurion's trail

==Description==
I know only that my [[Malfurion Stormrage|husband]] is somewhere deeper in this twisted forest. He is still alive, but it remains to be seen if he is whole.

<Tyrande's expression hardens into a scowl as she peers at you.>

[[Elune]] herself cannot protect [[Xavius]] and his ilk if he is not.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54|}}
*1,480 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
No one is safe from this corruption.

==Notes==

:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Stay close. Do not let the Nightmare confound you.}}
:''Tyrande pauses at a fork in the road.''
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|The path splits. Wait, what is that?}}
:''Tyrande moves to the point of interest on the main path.
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Feathers and blood... It is still wet! There may still be time!}}
:''Tyrande hastens along that path before pausing again, this time at the bridge leading into [[Dreadroot]].''
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|The corruption is thick here. What is that across the bridge? Follow closely.}}
:''Tyrande crosses the bridge.''
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|[[Elothir]]? By Elune... not you too! Have you seen my husband?}}
;Quest complete
:{{text|say|Elothir|The trees whisper his name, but their words are madness to my ears!}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|You must help me find him! Is there anything I can do?}}
:{{text|say|Elothir|You may not, but perhaps... your mother moon can.}}
