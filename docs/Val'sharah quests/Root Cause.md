==Objectives==
Collect 30 Root Samples.
*[[Corrupted Root Sample]] (30)

==Description==
The massive roots of [[Shaladrassil]] are spreading a horrible corruption throughout the forest.

If we are to save [[Val'sharah]], we will need to find a way to stop the encroachment of the [[World Tree|world tree]].

If you bring me enough corrupted root samples, I may be able to discover their secrets.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
Have you collected the root samples yet?

==Completion==
It is as I feared, <race>. This corruption is... irreversible.

Our only course of action is to somehow find a way to fight it at its source.
