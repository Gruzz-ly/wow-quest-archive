==Objectives==
Collect 5 Stolen Lunarwing Eggs in the [[Lunarwing Shallows]].
*[[Lunarwing Egg]] (5)

==Description==
Why the [[Thistleleaf]] are collecting the Lunarwing eggs is anyone's guess, but you can be sure it's not to give them a loving home.

[[Saylanna Riverbreeze]] will know what to do with these.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
Gather as many eggs as you can and bring them back to me. I will keep them safe.

==Completion==
Until I can discover what is vexing the Thistleleaf, I'll have to look after the Lunarwing eggs. At least I know they will be safe.

==Progression==
...
