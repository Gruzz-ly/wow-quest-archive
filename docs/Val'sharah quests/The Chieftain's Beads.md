==Objectives==
Speak to [[Elder Sookh]] at [[Smolderhide Thicket]]. 

==Description==
The ceremonial beads, decorated with shells and feathers, are worn by the clan's chieftain.

Perhaps Elder Sookh would be interested in seeing these.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
* 14800 [[XP]]
* 150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
[[Chieftain Graw|Graw]] was the first to succumb to the madness, and the rest of the clan followed.

With these, I will take the reins as our clan's new chieftain.

Thank you, traveler. I will do my best to rebuild my clan.
