==Objectives==
Check on the Heathrow house, Granny Marl's farm, and the Radcliffes' fishing dock.
*Check the [[Heathrow Manor|Heathrow house]]
*Check the [[Marl's Stead|Corn Fields]]
*Check the [[Radcliffe Landing|Fishing Dock]]
*Return to [[Bradensbrook]]

==Description==
Forgive us, stranger. [[Mayor Heathrow]] has been under a lot of stress recently.

I can't blame him: his own daughter, [[Penelope Heathrow|Penelope]], has been missing for two days.

In fact, we could use information on several farmsteads to the south: Mayor Heathrow's house, Granny Marl's farm, and the Radcliffes' dock. Can you go check on the situation out there?

Help us, and perhaps the mayor's heart will soften.

How does it look out there?

==Completion==
I'm sorry for my suspicion earlier. We're all on edge with the recent attacks.

I couldn't be more grateful to you and your friend.

Thanks to you, our situation is under control now. We've got a lot of rebuilding to do, but we'll survive.
