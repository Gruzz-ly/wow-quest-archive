== Objectives ==
* Black Rook forces thwarted

== Description ==
: {{text|say|[[Celestine of the Harvest]]|There are many noble [[Ghost|spirits]] that walk the land of the living, but [[Kur'talos Ravencrest|Lord Ravencrest's]] cursed followers are beyond redemption. You'd best defeat them before they rally and attack [[Bradensbrook|Bradesbrook]]{{sic}} in force.}}

==Rewards==
* +75 reputation with [[Dreamweavers]]

== Completion ==
: {{text|say|Celestine of the Harvest|The spirits' forces have been weakened... for now. Can what is dead ever truly die?}}

== Notes ==
Any of the mobs will count, as well as breaking Weapon Racks and kicking Kaldorei Tomes.

== Trivia ==
Originally, the [[Rickety Ballista]]s were usable vehicles that could kill the mobs; each would last for five shots. Shooting down the [[Kaldorei Windgryph]]/[[Reanimated Archer]] pairs from the sky would very quickly complete the quest, but since this presumably was not in line with the quests' design intentions, they were later made non-interactive.

==Beta==
{{rfb-section|Legion}}
;Objectives
Take the Warden's Signet to Jarod Shadowsong.

;Description
Inside the chest, hidden amongst various knickknacks, is a signet engraved with a unique crest.

The band, made from a silvery, unbreakable metal, has been worn down by time, as if absently twisted and rubbed against its owner's finger.

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 7.3.0|note=Rickety Ballistas are no longer usable.}}
* {{Patch 7.2.0|note=Added.}}
