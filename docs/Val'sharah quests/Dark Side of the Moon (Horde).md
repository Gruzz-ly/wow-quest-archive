==Objectives==
Protect Tyrande while she holds her vigil at the Ancient Moonwell.
*Meet Tyrande in [[Shadowfen]]
*Guard Tyrande during her vigil

==Description==
[[Xavius]] led [[Ysera]] past here, but their destination is unclear. The Nightmare smothers my mind!

These refugees tell of an ancient [[Moonwell]] hidden in the ruins ahead. 

If it is uncorrupted, it will give me the focus I need. By [[Elune]]'s light, we will find my [[Malfurion Stormrage|husband]] yet.

Meet me at the Moonwell at once, <class>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
He is still alive, but the rest remains to be seen. For your sake, let us pray that he is unharmed.

==Notes==
Tyrande will be waiting for you at the moonwell in [[Shadowfen]]. She will walk up to the pool once you initiate the event, during which you will need to defend her from [[Wormtalon Huntress]]es and eventually the [[Wormtalon Matriarch]] herself.
