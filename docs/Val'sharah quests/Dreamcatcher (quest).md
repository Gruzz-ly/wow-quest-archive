==Objectives==
Charge the dreamcatcher using [[owlbeast]] totems in [[Lostlight Grotto]].
* [[Shriektalon Totem]] siphoned
* [[Fearfeather Totem]] siphoned
* [[Reaverbeak Totem]] siphoned
* [[Leirana's Dreamcatcher]] (provided)

==Description==
I cannot hold on for much longer...

I brought a dreamcatcher with me.  I was to use it to steal the [[magic]] from owlbeast totems.

It is the only way to break the barrier where they hold [[Keeper Remulos]].

Please help where I have failed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
[[Leirana]]?  Oh no...

==Completion==
I knew Leirana... she was one of Remulos' favored, and kindhearted soul. If he has been captured as she believes, we have no time to mourn her passing.

==Progression==
...
