==Objectives==
Use Old Grizzelback's Staff to destroy 5 snarled brambles in [[Grizzleweald]].
*[[Snarled Bramble]] disentangled (5)
*[[Old Grizzleback's Staff]] (provided)

==Description==
When I arrived at my home, the front door was barred by magical roots.

I was able to remove them, but few of [[Grizzleweald tribe|my tribe]] possess the necessary ability to do so themselves.

Take my staff. Its powers will easily disentangle the obstructing roots.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
My old bones need more rest than I would care to admit.

==Completion==
The [[grell]] trapped our young within the huts. They are no longer at risk, thanks to your generous efforts.
