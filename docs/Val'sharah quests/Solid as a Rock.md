* {{NPC||Del'thanar Sagewood}} Rescued

==Description==
[[Cenarius]] requires me?

I shall depart as soon as I am able, but I mustn't leave while my [[druid]]s are in danger. A vile [[harpy]] coven has emerged and seeks to claim my grove as their own.

These vermin inflict a petrifying disease which, given time, will destroy the infected.

While I wish for all of my followers to be cured, it is crucial that my elder disciples survive to protect the grove in my absence.

If you would assist us, find my disciples and rouse them from this terrible state.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14800 [[XP]]
*+150 reputation with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Progress==
Have you roused my disciples, traveler?

==Completion==
Your arrival was a blessing, friend.

Ande'thoras-ethil.

==Notes==
Seek out the three ancients throughout [[Thas'talah Basin]] and click on them.
