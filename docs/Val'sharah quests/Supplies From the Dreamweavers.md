Hero!

Your dedication to defending Val'sharah has given us a much needed respite from the vile influence of the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]. We were able to scavenge some supplies as a result of your efforts.

Here, take them and know that, should you continue to aid us, we will set aside more rewards such as these as we find them.
