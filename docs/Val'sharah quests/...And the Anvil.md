==Objectives==
Gather 5 Black Rook Breastplates from the [[night elf|elves]] of [[Black Rook Hold]].
* [[Black Rook Breastplate]] (5)

==Description==
If you truly wish to see my work then you'll have to go and retrieve it as my shop has been raided of everything I've made.

The breastplates of the Black Rook soldiers were one of my greatest accomplishments. They're light, yet strong and offer great mobility

Relinquish my cursed brethren of their breastplates and bring them back to me. I will explain the finer points of how I made them upon your return.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|60|}}
* 16,170 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you acquired any breastplates?

==Completion==
These pieces will do fine as examples. Now, let me explain how I crafted them...
