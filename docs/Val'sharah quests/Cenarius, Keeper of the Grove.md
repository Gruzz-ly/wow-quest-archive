==Objectives==
Speak to [[Malfurion Stormrage]] at [[Lorlathil]] in [[Val'sharah]]. 
* Speak to Malfurion

==Description==
Ahh, Val'sharah.

It has been an age since I have set foot in these sacred woods. Too long...

Our work here is simple, <class>. We must call upon my mentor, [[Cenarius]], and learn where he safeguards the [[Tears of Elune]]. With them, you will be one step closer to sealing [[Tomb of Sargeras|Sargeras' Tomb]] and thwarting the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].

You have many treacherous tasks in front of you. Consider your visit here a brief respite.

Come, this will not take long.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54|}}
* 1,480 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
This corruption - I've never seen it before.

And yet, it seems somehow familiar...

==Notes==
Talk to Malfurion.

:Welcome to Lorlathil, sanctuary of the druids. Though this forest has aged, its spirits still remember me.
:{{Gossip|I am ready, Malfurion.}}

Malfurion will shift into [[Travel Form]], and you will automatically mount and ride him to the [[Grove of Cenarius]], where [[Cenarius]] himself lies sick on the other side of the pond.
