==Objectives==
[[Prince Toreth]] at [[Wyrmscar Island]] has asked that you slay 5 Viridian Whelps and 5 Viridian Broodlings.
*[[Veridian Whelp]] slain (5)
*[[Veridian Broodling]] slain (5)

==Description==
The whelps that you see on this island are the agitated spirits of the [[green dragonflight]]. Like me, they are bound to the land, unable to ascend to their final resting place in the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]].

Recovering the bones of the fallen has settled them somewhat but you must take further action.

Destroy their ethereal manifestations. I cannot leave this place until it is done. They must be released!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1450 [[XP]] (or {{cost||9|}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
It pains me to watch. Please, let us not speak of this any further.

==Completion==
As reprehensible as your task was, it had to be done. Now you must look into the face of evil.

==Progression==
