==Objectives==
Speak with [[Vindicator Corin]] at [[Vindicator's Rest]] on [[Bloodmyst Isle]].

==Description==
I would not ask you to single-handedly bear the burden of destroying the Vector Coil and slaying Sironas, &lt;name&gt;; however, I believe that you can be of some help in clearing the way for others that might take on such a dangerous assignment.

Take the road going north out of [[Blood Watch]] and follow it until you get to the fork. Once there, take the left road and follow it until you see Vindicator's Rest - it will be slightly west of the road itself. Corin will be waiting for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*390 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with {{F|Exodar}}

==Completion==
Perhaps you will be the one to deliver our people into a new age of prosperity and peace.
