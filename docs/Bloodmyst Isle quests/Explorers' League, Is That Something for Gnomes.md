This quest points you to [[Clopper Wizbang]], who starts you off on a short series of quests.

==Objectives==
Find [[Clopper Wizbang]] camped in an old turtle shell on the shore north of [[Blood Watch]]. 

==Description==
Babysitting! Would you believe it?

They pulled me out of a promising dig and sent me along with [[Admiral Odesyus|Captain Odesyus]]' expedition to babysit that little gnome!

I'd never heard o' a gnome wanting to become a prospector before, so I asked.

Seems we are takin' gnomes now, and this particular one has a fascination with murlocs!

Well, he's gone off and set up shop in an old turtle shell on the northern shore of the island. Go and have a look if you don't believe me!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*320 [[XP]] (or {{cost||1|80}} at level 70)

==Completion==
I thought so! That grumpy old dwarf was supposed to help me carry my equipment and gather data, but all he does is sit in that strange draenei town, drinking himself into a stupor.
