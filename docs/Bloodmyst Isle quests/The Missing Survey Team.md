This quest is part of the [[Learning from the Crystals quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Harbinger Mikolaas]] wants you to find the Survey Team he sent to the [[Ruins of Loreth'Aran]] and assist them in any way you can.
 
==Description==
As we've gotten ourselves established here at [[Blood Watch]], I've been sending out survey teams to create more reliable maps of the island. In most cases, they returned unharmed with the data we need, but the team I sent east to the ruins hasn't reported back.

I worry about what might have happened to them, but I can't spare the men to send another mission after them. Find them, <name>, and lend them any assistance they require to return with their survey data.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*975 [[XP]] (or {{cost||6|}} at max level)
*+150 [[reputation]] with {{F|Exodar}}

==Completion==
The bodies of the [[draenei]] survey team are scattered all over the ground here, pierced by [[naga]] weaponry. The area is littered with the remains of their supplies and survey equipment, but their data crystals are nowhere to be seen.

==Notes==
The remains of a Draenei cartographer, part of the survey team, are found in the middle of the ruins (61,48), with Naga all around.

==Progression==
