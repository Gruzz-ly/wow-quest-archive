== Objectives ==
[[Kessel]] at [[Kessel's Crossing]] on [[Bloodmyst Isle]] wants you to kill [[Lord Xiz]] at [[Wrathscale Lair]] and drive the Draenei Banner through his dead body.
* [[Draenei Banner]] (provided)

== Description ==
Have you seen the serpent men? The ones that call themselves [[naga]]?

<Kessel spits.>

They dared make an advance upon this camp under cover of darkness only three nights ago. Can you believe the audacity of those primitive beasts?

I need you to deliver a message to their leadership, <name>. To the northeast is [[Wrathscale Lair]], home to [[Lord Xiz]]. Find him, slay him where he stands and drive this banner through his corpse.

Let them know fear whenever they should see our standard!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Kessel's Cinch Wrap
|Kessel's Sweat Stained Elekk Leash
|Kessel's Sturdy Riding Handle
|Kessel's Elekk Leading Chain
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

== Progress ==
Is it done?

== Completion ==
I am sorry that you had to do that, <name>. Heavy-handed violence is not the draenei way, but sometimes it is the only way.

This is one of life's truths that many do not understand until it is too late. So it was for our people, when we were slaughtered at the hands of the orcs.

Becoming a [[Hand of Argus]] is a process of rebirth. And with birth comes pain...

== Notes ==
Coordinates for [[Lord Xiz]]: {{coords|68|67|Bloodmyst Isle}}

Wrathscale Lair is east and north from where Kessel is.  Lord Xiz is at the top of the ruins.  He can very nearly be killed without having to kill any other naga in the area if the ruins are approached from the north.  Lord Xiz is a level 13 warrior.  You must '''use''' the [[Draenei Banner]] on his corpse, to gain credit for the quest.
