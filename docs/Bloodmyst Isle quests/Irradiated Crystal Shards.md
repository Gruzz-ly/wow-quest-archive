==Objectives==
Vindicator Boros at [[Blood Watch]] wants you to bring him 10 Irradiated Crystal Shards.
*[[Irradiated Crystal Shard]] (10)

==Description==
The Exodar's crash scattered pieces of fouled crystals all over [[Bloodmyst Isle]], corrupting the water and the landscape.

We've even begun finding pieces of the crystals inside the flesh of animals taken for meat.  I've uncovered a way to purify the shard and turn them into functional crystals, so if you bring me enough shards, I'll trade one of my completed crystals for them.  So far I've found the shards in the bodies of bears, ravagers, flutterers, and treants inhabiting the corrupted part of the island. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Crystal of Vitality|Crystal of Insight|Crystal of Ferocity}}
You will also receive:
*1050 [[XP]] (or {{cost||6|60}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Exodar}}

==Progress==
Have you gathered crystal shards from the creatures of Bloodmyst?

==Completion==
Well done.  These will provide the raw materials for another batch of enhancement crystals.

You're welcome to choose from among the three kinds of crystals I can make.  I find each of them useful for stalking different kinds of prey.

==Notes==
The buffs from the reward Crystals cannot be stacked, whether from the same Crystal or a different one.  Using any Crystal will replace any previous Crystal buff.  There appears to be no such conflict with buffs from sources besides the Crystals.
