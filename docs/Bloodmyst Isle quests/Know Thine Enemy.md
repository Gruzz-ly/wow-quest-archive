==Objectives==
Find the [[Nazzivus Monument]] in [[Nazzivian]] and retrieve a Nazzivus Monument Glyph. Return to [[Vindicator Aalesia]] in [[Blood Watch]] when you have one of the glyphs. 
*[[Nazzivus Monument Glyph]]

==Description==
It's good to see another new face here in [[Blood Watch]], <class>. Although the [[blood elves]] are the most immediate threat, there are other sinister creatures that call [[Bloodmyst Isle]] home.

The [[Nazzivus]] satyr are of particular concern. They are foul, demonic creatures, commanding dark magics and feeding on the corruption created by the ''[[Exodar]]'s'' crash.

We must hold them in check, but first we must learn more about them. Go southwest to Nazzivian and learn what you can from their grotesque monument.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||6|}}
*975 [[XP]] (or {{cost||6|}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Were you successful in obtaining knowledge of the Nazzivus [[satyr]]?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Let me see what I can learn from this glyph, so we can plan our next move.

==Notes==
Nazzivus Monument Glyph is located in the north end of the Nazzivian {{coords|36.5|71.4|Bloodmyst Isle}}.

:{{Text|say|Vindicator Aalesia|These pictographs tell a story.  This figure at the beginning, almost looks like [[Injured Night Elf Priestess|one]] of the [[Night elf|creatures]] we encountered at Azure Watch...}}
:{{Text|say|Vindicator Aalesia|No, this can't be... It says this creature willingly became a servant of the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].  He transforms into a satyr and receives the Legion's "blessing."}}
:{{Text|say|Vindicator Aalesia|We must defeat these satyr, <name>.  We will not suffer the Legion's presence in these lands.}}
