==Objectives==
[[Captain Edward Hanes]] on [[Wyrmscar Island]] wants you to recover 4 Bloodcursed Souls.
*[[Bloodcursed Soul]] (4)

==Description==
On a ledge of the reef, deeper than where you found the [[bloodcursed]] naga, you will find the hopeless ones: The bloodcursed voyagers, ghosts of those taken by the [[bloodcurse]].

It is regrettable, what I ask of you now... but they must be destroyed and their cursed shells brought back to me.

Their souls must be put to rest. Return to me when you have done as asked and I shall give you one final task.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1350 [[XP]] (or {{cost||8|40}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
Do not mourn their demise, <name>.

==Completion==
You have done the hopeless ones a great service, <name>. There is but one final task: Destroy the leader of the Bloodcursed.

==Progression==
