==Description==
Good to see you again, <name>! You were exceptionally efficient in completing the last task that I offered you. Perhaps you would be interested in another?

To the northeast lies [[Wyrmscar Island]], home to a rare species of mushroom known as Ysera's tear - named after the green dragonlings that inhabit the island. I only require a small sampling of the mushroom, but I must warn you that the denizens of the island do not welcome visitors. Tread carefully.

* {{cost||1|65}}

==Progress==
Back so soon?

==Completion==
I hope this wasn't too strenuous a task, <name>. Once again you have proven yourself a competent and considerate <race>. I offer my gratitude and a small bit of monetary compensation.
