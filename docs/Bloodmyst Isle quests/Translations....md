==Objectives==
Take the Sunhawk Missive to [[Interrogator Elysia]] at [[Blood Watch]].
*[[Sunhawk Missive]] (provided)

==Description==
Our chief interrogator, Elysia, is fluent in Thalassian. Take the document to her and see what she has to say.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*120 [[XP]] (or {{cost|||60}} at max level)
*+10 [[reputation]] with {{F|Exodar}}

==Progress==
I'm a bit busy here, agent <name>. This better be important.

==Completion==
<Elysia reads from the document.>

If what this document says is true, the blood elves have opened a portal to the Outland! It would certainly explain their seemingly endless numbers...

==Progression==
{{Intercepting the Message}}
