Critters of the Void is given by Scout Loryi. 

== Objectives ==
Kill 12 Void Critters and report to Vindicator Aesom at Blood Watch.
* [[Void Critter]] slain (12)

== Description ==
Aesom sent my squad out on a reconnaissance mission to search for the sun gate a few days ago.  Needless to say, we found it...

<Loryi points at Jorli.>

Whatever those fool elves are transporting through that portal is causing void energy to be released.  The area is teaming with void critters.

We must destroy them before they have a chance to grow into void anomalies.  You'll find the source of the creatures southwest of here, near the sun gate.  Kill them and report back to Aesom when you're done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

== Progress ==
Void critters grow into void anomalies.  Truth be told, we really don't know what these creatures are... the name is more of a classification.

== Completion ==
It's a real mess up there, eh?  You've done well, <name>.  I'll send some anchorites out to help Loryi and Jorli.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
