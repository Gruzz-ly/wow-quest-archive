==Objectives==
Kill Sunhawk elves until you find the Sunhawk Missive, then return it to [[Vindicator Boros]] at [[Blood Watch]].
*[[Sunhawk Missive]]

==Description==
It is good to see you again, <name>. I have a quandary that you might be able to solve.

Our agents situated behind Sunhawk lines have reported seeing Sunhawk soldiers parsing an unusual document.

Unfortunately, we have been unsuccessful in acquiring a copy of the document for ourselves. I need you to go out in the field and try to recover the document. I am certain that if you apply enough pressure, a Sunhawk agent will turn over the information we seek. I leave the use of force to your discretion.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1150 [[XP]] (or {{cost||7|20}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Exodar}}

==Progress==
Back so soon? Have you found the missive?

==Completion==
<Vindicator Boros eyes the document.>
This is in Thalassian. Fortunately, I know just the person that can translate it...
