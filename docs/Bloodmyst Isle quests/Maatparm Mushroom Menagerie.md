==Objectives==
[[Maatparm]] at [[Blood Watch]] wants 1 Aquatic Stinkhorn, 1 Blood Mushroom, 1 Ruinous Polyspore, and 1 Fel Cone Fungus.
*[[Aquatic Stinkhorn]]
*[[Blood Mushroom]]
*[[Ruinous Polyspore]]
*[[Fel Cone Fungus]]

==Description==
Did you know mushroom hunting is far more dangerous than mushroom consumption? Mushroom hunters expose themselves to many unknowns - not including potential wildlife dangers!

What would life be without a little danger? I am in need of mushrooms for my collection. Scattered throughout these unexplored wilds you will find four different types: An aquatic stinkhorn, a blood mushroom, a ruinous polyspore, and a fel cone fungus. They are each unique to various regions in Bloodmyst. Bring them to me.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Maatparm's Fungus Lined Cuffs
|Maatparm's Fungus Lined Bands
|Maatparm's Fungus Lined Bracers
|Maatparm's Fungus Lined Bindings
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||1|10}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Remember, the mushrooms I requested are each unique to the different environments of Bloodmyst.

==Completion==
Well, I did warn you - did I not? Hopefully this payment more than makes up for the mild discomfort that you may have suffered. Return to me when you have gained strength and perhaps I will have another job for you - mushrooms of course!

==Notes==
Speak with Maatparm for clues.

:{{Gossip|Maatparm, could you direct me towards the aquatic stinkhorn?}}
::Look in the waters that divide this island, but be warned: the [[Stinkhorn Striker|stinkhorn striker]] makes its home in the waters of the river.

:{{Gossip|Maatparm, could you direct me towards the ruinous polyspore?}}
::As the name suggests, it can be found near ruins. [[Loreth'Aran]] holds the answer.

::Actualy, the name doesn't really suggest that -- I was just trying to be clever in naming the fungi.

:{{Gossip|Maatparm, could you direct me towards the fel come fungus?}}
::Fel cone derives its name from fel magic corruption. Seek the fel cone fungus at the [[Nazzivian]] satyr camp - to the west.

:{{Gossip|Maatparm, could you direct me towards the blood mushrooms?}}
::Blood mushrooms are more common than the other fungi varieties and can be found mostly anywhere in the woods around Bloodmyst. Keep your search south of the road dividing Bloodmyst if you value your life.

;Aquatic Stinkhorn
These can be found in the waterway to the south. They can also be found in the bellies of Stinkhorn Striker fish.

;Blood Mushroom
These red-capped beauties are found over much of Bloodmyst Isle. They are easy to see and easy to recognize with their glowing red cap.
*(One coordinate: {{coords|51|81|Bloodmyst Isle}})

;Ruinous Polyspore
These grey and pink mushrooms are found near (as in, within arm's reach of) the naga ruins to the east. 
*(One coordinate: {{coords|64|47|Bloodmyst Isle}})

;Fel Cone Mushroom
These evil shrooms are a bit harder to recognize. They are a simple yellow-white mushroom, fairly thick, that congregate with other, less useful, shrooms.
