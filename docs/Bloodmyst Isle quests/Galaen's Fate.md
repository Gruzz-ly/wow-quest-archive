==Objectives==
Bring Galaen's Amulet to [[Morae]] at [[Blood Watch]]. 
*[[Galaen's Amulet]]

==Description==
You have no means of identifying the corpse as [[Galaen]] with the information Morae gave you, but the clothing appears to have been torn in search of valuables.

The [[Blood elf|blood elves]] in the area would've claimed anything of value from the wreckage, including Galaen's jeweled amulet.

Although her husband did not survive the crash, you believe that Morae would be grateful if you recovered her husband's amulet from the blood elves.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Cryo-Core Attendant's Boots
|Lightweight Plate Boots
|Technician's Boots
|Artificer's Boots
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
<Morae looks at you hopefully.>

Did your search turn up any trace of Galaen?

==Completion==
<You tell Morae of your findings in the wreckage of the [[Cryo-Core]].>

So... he's...

I guess I knew on some level, but just wouldn't let myself believe it. It's not the news I was hoping for, but you have my deepest thanks for finding Galaen.

==Notes==
''On accept:''
: ''The ghost of Galaen appears.''
: {{text|say|Galaen|Morae...  Is that you?}}
: {{text|say|Galaen|No... you're not Morae, but I sense that you have met.  When you see her, tell her that I survived the crash, only to be done in by the infiltrators.}}
: {{text|say|Galaen|Let her know... my last thought was of her...}}
: ''The spirit fades away.''
