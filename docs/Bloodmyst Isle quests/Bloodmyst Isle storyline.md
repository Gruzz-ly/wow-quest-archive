# Bloodmyst Isle storyline

[[File:WorldMap-BloodmystIsle.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

'''[[Bloodmyst Isle]]''' is a level 11-20 [[Alliance]] zone just north of [[Azuremyst Isle]] and is the second place [[draenei]] players visit on their questing journeys. Major conflicts on the island include battles against the irradiated wildlife, the local satyrs and the blood elves known as [[Sunhawk]]s. Most of the questing is done from Blood Watch in the center of the island, though there are a couple of other questing hubs.

The progress of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Bloodmyst Isle Quests]].

==Kessel's Crossing==
The first place draenei players arrive is Kessel's Crossing, right on the border between Azuremyst Isle and Bloodmyst Isle. There, [[Kessel]] has numerous quests for them revolving around defending the crossing from the threats of the Blood Elves and the Naga. Other quests in the area involve [[A Favorite Treat|collecting fruit from the island]] and [[Alien Predators|balancing the local ecosystem]] after the Exodar's crash unbalanced it.

Kessel's Quests:
#[[The Kessel Run]] (takes place on Azuremyst Isle)
#[[Declaration of Power]]
#[[Report to Exarch Admetius]] (to Blood Watch)

With [[Saving Princess Stillpine]] and [[Report to Exarch Admetius]], players move on to Blood Watch.

In [[Blood Watch]], players have many quest lines dedicated to the defense of Bloodmyst Isle against the myriad threats being faced by the newly-arrived Draenei. In order to combat these threats, there are Vindicators who offer specific quest chains dedicated to countering each threat. The quest chains intertwine with each other to lead to the ultimate goal of the safety of the island.

==Main story - Sunhawks==
The main Vindicator giving quests to defeat the Sunhawks is [[Vindicator Boros]]. Upon arriving at Blood Watch from the quest [[Report to Exarch Admetius]], players are sent to Boros who immediately sends them into the field to terminate Sunhawks and collect crystals.

#[[What Argus Means to Me]]
#[[Blood Watch (quest)]] & [[Irradiated Crystal Shards]]
#Unlocks [[More Irradiated Crystal Shards]]

After some time, players can then help Vindicator Boros as he searches for information on how the Sunhawks are fighting so valiantly against the Draenei. They discover the existence of Sun Gates - portals to Outland that the Sunhawks are using to summon reinforcements. This information is taken to Prophet Velen in [[Audience with the Prophet]]. He proposes that the Sun Gates can be located by the presence of Void anomalies.

[[Vindicator Boros]]:
#[[Intercepting the Message]]
#[[Translations...]]
#[[Audience with the Prophet]]
#[[Truth or Fiction]]
#[[I Shoot Magic Into the Darkness]]

Unfortunately, the Sun Gate has to be put on a backburner - another crashed section of the ''Exodar'' was found, and it is the vessel's cryo-core, holding crucial medical supplies and, possibly, more survivors.

[[Vindicator Kuros]]:
#[[The Cryo-Core (quest)]]

So much for survivors, the Sunhawks clearly got there first. On finding Galaen's Journal, players discover that [[Vindicator Saruan]], a Draenei leader, was captured and tortured by the Sunhawks before being brutally transformed into some sort of abomination. On hearing this, Vindicator Kuros is furious and has players capture the Blood Elf responsible, [[Matis the Cruel]] so he may be brought to justice.

#[[Galaen's Journal - The Fate of Vindicator Saruan]]
#[[Matis the Cruel (quest)]]

Back to the matter of the Sun Gate, Vindicator Aesom gives them a task to destroy the Gate, while Harbinger Mikolaas sends players onwards to Vindicator's Rest to assist the scouts. Afterwards, players return to Blood Watch.

[[Vindicator Aesom]]:
#[[Don't Drink the Water]]
#[[Limits of Physical Exhaustion]]
#[[The Sun Gate]]

[[Harbinger Mikolaas]] and [[Scout Jorli]]:
#[[Talk to the Hand]]
#[[Cutting a Path]]
#[[Critters of the Void]]

Having learned of the torture of Vindicator Saruan and destroyed the Sun Gates, players are directed to Exarch Admetius himself for the final stage of the plan to destroy the Sunhawks - destroying the [[Vector Coil]]. Players interrogate a Sunhawk prisoner to learn the weaknesses of the Vector Coil and are then dispatched to Vindicator's Rest to prepare the way for the assault. This sends the player back to Vindicator's Rest.

#[[What We Know...]]
#[[What We Don't Know...]]
#[[Vindicator's Rest (quest)]]

On returning, players can join Vindicator Corin in clearing out all the threats around Vindicator's Rest before assaulting the Vector Coil itself and destroying it in [[Ending Their World]]
#[[Clearing the Way (Alliance)]]
#[[Ending Their World]]

Afterwards, players can return to the Blood Watch, where Prophet Velen himself has come to congratulate them for their work.

==Side quests==
===Crystal Corruption===
[[Harbinger Mikolaas]] is concerned with the nature of the crystals that were scattered around Bloodmyst Isle by the Exodar's crash, and the effects they are having on the local wildlife.
