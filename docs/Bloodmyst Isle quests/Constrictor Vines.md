==Objectives==
Tracker Lyceon at [[Blood Watch]] wants you to bring him 6 Thorny Constrictor Vines.
*[[Thorny Constrictor Vine]] (6)

==Description==
A good woodsman makes use of every available resource, <class>. Even the most bizarre creatures possess attributes we can use to our advantage.

With [[Blood Watch]] under constant assault from the Sunhawks, we're looking to a variety of natural defenses including traps. The lasher's thorny vines are perfectly suited to the construction of the traps I have in mind. The combination of sharp spines and deadly toxin will fell unwary attackers. Bring me the vines of mutated constrictors so that I can begin my work.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||7|}}
*1050 [[XP]] (or {{cost||6|60}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Exodar}}

==Progress==
Did you manage to get the constrictor vines?

==Completion==
These seem sturdy enough to do the job. Thank you for your help, <name>. Your contribution to Blood Watch's defense will not be forgotten.

==Patch changes==
