==Objectives==

Bring 3 Crude Murloc Idols and 6 Crude Murloc Knives to [[Clopper Wizbang]], who is hiding in a beached turtle shell.
* [[Crude Murloc Idol]]: 0/3
* [[Crude Murloc Knife]]: 0/6

==Description==
My observations and writings about the Blacksilt [[murloc]]s are quite illuminating, ''<name>'', but they are just the beginning. I plan to return to [[Ironforge]] with items produced by the Blacksilts' rudimentary crafting skills.

The problem is that the Blacksilt carry these items with them at all times, and I can't have their blood on my consience. If you're willing to help me gather the idols carried by Blacksilt seers and crude knives of the Blacksilt warriors and shorestrikers, I won't ask how you came by them.

== Progress ==
Do you have those samples for me to send back to Ironforge?

== Completion ==
Astounding, simply astounding! These are perfect, ''<name>''. I can already see them under the glass in the [[Library (Ironforge)#Museum|museum]] in Ironforge. The text for the display is virtually writing itself in my head! 

Your help has been invaluable in getting my studies back on track. How do you spell your name? I'll make sure it appears in my report as co-author. 

One of the chaps on the ship gave me this 'treasure map' to cover a gambling debt, but mythology isn't my area of study. Superstitious lot, sailors.

== Rewards ==
* [[Weathered Treasure Map]]
* {{cost||9}}
* 130 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progression==
{{:Weathered Map quest series}}

== Notes ==
The drop rates for these items seems to vary between "Great" and "Agonizing". Be patient and enjoy the grind. The finding of [[Crude Murloc Knife|Crude Murloc Knives]] is made a little simpler for you can see which Murlocs are wielding a knife - however, there is no way to identify which Murlocs are carrying the [[Crude Murloc Idol|Idols]].

== Trivia ==
*This quest's name is a reference to melodic death metal band [[wikipedia:In Flames|In Flames]]'s song "Artifacts of the Black Rain," from the album [[wikipedia:The Jester Race|The Jester Race]].
