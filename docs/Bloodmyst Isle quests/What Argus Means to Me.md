==Objectives==
[[Exarch Admetius]] at [[Blood Watch]] has told you to speak with [[Vindicator Boros]].

==Description==
What does [[Argus]] mean to you, <name>? Many draenei probably do not know or remember our home planet. It is there that we split from the man'ari: the twisted demonic reflections of ourselves that were 'gifted' by [[Sargeras]]. Or as they call themselves, [[Eredar]].

Eredar... this word once held meaning.

<Admetius smacks his lips as if to taste the word.>

Disgusting.

Let us not waste anymore time. Find Vindicator Boros to begin your training.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*110 [[XP]] (or {{cost|||60}} at max level)
*+10 [[reputation]] with {{F|Exodar}}

==Completion==
Ah, <name>... I've heard about you. You're the one that made the [[The Kessel Run|Kessel Run]] in under 15 minutes, right? Bah, probably not.

Are you ready to spill some blood in the name of the Light? For [[Velen]]? For Argus?

<Boros laughs.>

I'll slow down.
