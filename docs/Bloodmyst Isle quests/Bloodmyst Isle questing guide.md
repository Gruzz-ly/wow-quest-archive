# Bloodmyst Isle questing guide

{{ood}}
This '''questing guide''' for the zone of Bloodmyst Isle details the best method to obtain and complete quests in [[Bloodmyst Isle]].

For a list of all [[Bloodmyst Isle]] quests in table format (arranged by level), see [[Bloodmyst Isle quests]].

[[Image:Icon-warning-22x22.png|Note]] '''Note''': This guide is not meant for power-leveling purposes. Rather, it is meant to show a player the most efficient way to complete all quests available for a particular zone. If you know of a better order or method to accomplish this, your input is welcome (in fact, greatly desired). For major changes, feel free to edit, but make a note in the '''[[Talk:Bloodmyst Isle questing guide|talk page]]''' as to your reasoning.

[[Bloodmyst Isle]] is an [[Alliance]]-aligned zone designed for young [[draenei]] adventurers, and has only Alliance quests. The main questing hub is the village of [[Blood Watch]], which also houses a flight path back to [[Azuremyst Isle]]. 

It is recommended that the Azuremyst quests be done prior. It is also recommended to be at level 12.

*Before heading to Bloodmyst Isle, you should pick up [[Elekks Are Serious Business]] from outside [[The Exodar]].

*Travel to Kessel's Crossing (63,87), hand in [[Elekks Are Serious Business]] at Vorkhan the Elekk Herder and get the followup [[Alien Predators]]. Also get [[A Favorite Treat]] from Aonar. Before you get the other quest, carefully read through this section. When you're ready, take the quest [[The Kessel Run]].

*Kessel will give you an Elekk speed buff for 15 minutes, avoid getting it into water or into buildings, also stay out of the Stillpine Hold cave. Otherwise, you'll auto-unmount and lose much time. It is possible to stay mounted while talking to NPCs, however you must be almost right on top of them to do so. Druids: You won't get the speed buff if you're in bear or other form.

*Ride back to Azuremyst. The objective NPCs for [[The Kessel Run]] don't have extra quest marks on them, talking to them is enough to get the quest updates.

:First stop is High Chief Stillpine at Stillpine Hold. Just talk to him for [[The Kessel Run]], but also accept [[Warn Your People]] (which is only available when you did all other Stillpine Hold quests but this, otherwise just ignore this step).

:Then ride on to Azure Watch. Talk to Exarch Menelaous and also turn in [[Warn Your People]].

:Final stop is Odesyus' Landing. Talk to Admiral Odesyus to complete [[The Kessel Run]] and then ride back to Kessel's Crossing (63,87) on Bloodmyst Isle.

*Return to Kessel's Crossing, hand the quest in and receive [[Declaration of Power]].

*Talk to Vindicator Aesom for  [[What We Know...]]. After this, talk to Exarch Admetius in the building to the west and get the followup [[What We Don't Know...]]

*Once you accept this quest, you are transformed into a female Blood Elf. Then go and talk to the Captured Sunhawk Agent in the Makeshift Prison using the Talk Bubbles until you get a yellow message that you have successfully recovered the Sunhawk Information. Then return back to Exarch Admetius for your reward. He will then have [[Vindicator's Rest (quest)]].

*Repair, sell loot, and restock, etc. Be especially careful, as this will be a long circle.

*Leave Blood Watch, travel back towards Vindicator's Rest. You should spot Matis the Cruel along the road. Don't kill him! If you see him, quickly go to your inventory and right click on the Flare Gun. When you do so, a Tracker ally comes to help you. If you get Matis the Cruel's health down enough, you will get a yellow message that you have successfully captured him (note that this seemed quite easy).

*Just south of Vindicator's Rest, you can find the Enraged Ravagers as well as the Mutated Tanglers. Kill the Enraged Ravagers and the Mutated Tanglers until you have all 18 kills (10 Ravagers and 8 Tanglers and note that you may have to head slightly southwest a bit to find more of these enemies).

*Continue southwest and you will find the Sunhawk camps. Kill the Sunhawk Pyromancers and Sunhawk Defender enemies until you have all 20 kills (10 of each type). If at all possible, kill these enemies at the most southern camp (see your World Map), so that you can get to the Pool area south of this camp. Once you reach this Pool, swim under the water and kill the Void Critters until you have all 12 kills (you will probably have to wait for a respawn to get all 12).

*Now head north, finishing your 10 Defender and also 10 Pyromancer kills on the way. Avoid aggroing the elite mobs guarding the Vector Coil.

*After this, head west from the Foul Pool to discover the area of Amberweb Pass. You will see off to your right by the edge of the mountain Researcher Cornelius who has [[They're Alive! Maybe...]]. Fight your way up the Amberweb Pass.

*Kill the Myst Leecher and Myst Spinner Spiders in this area until you have all 16 kills (8 of each type). As you do this, you will also see many Cocoons. Range shoot these to free the Expedition Researchers. Be warned that there are also other enemies in some of the Cocoons.

*Work your way up the hill going northwest here until you reach the top (see your World Map if needed). Up at the top you will find the boss Spider named Zarakh surrounded by many other spiders. It is highly suggest taking out as many of the smaller spiders first as possible and then taking on Zarakh one on one. Work your way back down the mountain, finishing the other kills you might still need before returning to Researcher Cornelius and turn in [[They're Alive! Maybe...]]

*Then return to Vindicator's Rest and turn in [[Cutting a Path]] and [[Oh, the Tangled Webs They Weave]].

*Return to Blood Watch. Turn in quests and get followups.

Then swim west back to Captain Edward Hanes, but DON'T TURN IN [[The Hopeless Ones...]] yet!

*Instead, ask him to renew the waterbreathing and swimspeed buff (''Can you cast the spell to help me breathe and move underwater?''). Swim back to the main island to collect 8 Dragon Bones.

*Return to Wyrmscar Island, turn in [[Restoring Sanctity]] at Prince Toreth and get the followup [[Into the Dream]].

*Now kill 5 Veridian Whelps and Broodlings each.

*Explore the island to find Ysera's Tears Mushrooms from the ground (green in color).

*Turn in [[Into the Dream]] at Prince Toreth and get the followup [[Razormaw (quest)]].

*Move to the top of the hill. Clear it of the whelplings and prepare to fight. Then right click the ever-burning pile and wait for Razormaw to descend. Some hints for the battle:

:His flame breaths can be interrupted.
:He can be feared and stunned.
:Don't forget a Draenei's Gift of the Naaru.

*Once he's dead, return to Prince Toreth and turn in [[Razormaw (quest)]].

*Visit Captain Edward Hanes, renew the swim buff, then get the rest of your 4 Bloodcursed Souls if needed and before turning in [[The Hopeless Ones...]]. Renew the buff again (can't do it anymore after completing that quest). Turn in the quest and get the followup [[Ending the Bloodcurse]].

*Swim south until you reach the Bloodcurse Isle. From the north side of the Isle, work your way up the path to the top. Clear out the area here and ensure you're at full health and mana before you right click on the Statue of Queen Azshara to summon Atoph the Bloodcursed. Kill him and then swim north back to the Wyrmscar Island and talk to Captain Edward Hanes. Turn in [[Ending the Bloodcurse]]. Whelplings are useful for grinding here.

*Hearth back to Bloodwatch and turn in quests and get followups.

*If you're not a Draenei, you can accept only The Sun Gate, so just skip what you must.

*Repair, sell loot, and restock, etc. Fly to [[The Exodar]], learn your new class spells and if you want, do your class quests if there are any new, then fly back to Blood Watch.

*Make sure you still have the quest [[The Sun Gate]] from Vindicator Aesom, then travel to Vindicator's Rest.

*Read carefully before you accept the quests. You will be escorted by a level 20 elite shaman NPC. He will deal lots of damage, place totems, and in most cases heal both himself and you if necessary. He might sometimes overpull if he runs into a patrol, so consider pulling for him. He also stops twice to plant explosives. At that time, he won't care about adds, so stop pulling!

*[[Fenissa the Assassin]], a rare mob, might spawn while doing this quest. You might have already seen her at the Cryo-Core. Ensure you do more than half of the damage to earn her loot! You have to do half of the damage to a mob to earn its loot and be credited the kill, so ensure you damage the mobs the NPC targets, as he will also tank for you most of the time. Also, make sure to do enough damage to Sironas to earn credit for her kill.

*Accept [[Clearing the Way]] from Vindicator Corin. Talk to [[Demolitionist Legoso]] for [[Ending Their World]]. Once you accept this quest, follow Legoso and kill all enemies in your path, including the Sunhawk Agents and Sunhawk Saboteurs. After clearing out the lower area, Legoso asks you to protect him while he sets up the Explosive Charge. After this, continue following Legoso up the hill. After you get to the top, you will see Sironas siphoning the power of the Vector Coil. Kill more of the Sunhawk enemies until he asks you to protect him again as he sets up the second Explosive Charge.

*After a few moments, the Charges go off and Sironas increases in size and starts attacking your party. Kill her.

*Before leaving the area, be sure you also have all needed kills. After this, you can jump back down the hill on the southern side. Find the Sun Gate. Right click on each of the four Sunhawk Portal Controllers to attack and destroy them. Once they are all gone, you can swim in the water and right click on the Sun Gate itself to attack it until you get a yellow message that you have successfully destroyed it.

*Travel back to Vindicator's Rest, turn in [[Clearing the Way]] at Vindicator Corin, then hearth or travel back to Blood Watch.

*Turn in [[The Sun Gate]] at Vindicator Aesom.

*Prepare for one of your most unique moments in WoW and turn in [[Ending Their World]] at Exarch Admetius. He will then yell out that you are a Hero of the Draenei people. After exiting the building, a procession of NPCs you have been in contact with appears. Enjoy the party on the outside (they all got their special words to tell you, just talk to them). Be certain to talk to Prophet Velen for [[The Unwritten Prophecy]]. Otherwise you'll have to visit him again in [[The Exodar]] if you wait too long.
