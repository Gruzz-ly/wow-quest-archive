== Objectives ==
Vindicator Kuros at [[Blood Watch]] wants you to capture [[Matis the Cruel]]. 
*Matis the Cruel Captured
*[[Flare Gun]]

==  Description ==
Matis will be brought to justice, <name>; and I want you to be the one to find him and bring him back to the Triumvirate.

Scour the island for this bastard. Should you find him, use this flare gun. When my [[Tracker of the Hand|trackers]] see the flare, they'll come and assist in capturing Matis. Return to me after he's been captured.

== Progress ==
A soldier of Matis' stature won't be traveling alone.  Be careful out there.

==  Completion ==
The Triumvirate has decided to try Matis immediately. You have brought an arch-criminal to justice on this day, young <race>.

You have performed admirably for two of three; only Aesom remains.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Vindicator's Woolies
|Vindicator's Leather Chaps
|Vindicator's Iron Legguards
|Vindicator's Chain Leggings
}}

You will also receive:
*1350 [[XP]] (or {{cost||8|40}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

: {{text|say|Blade of Argus|You heard the Prophet.  Move, filth.}}
: ''The Blade escorts Matis to the emmiter.''
:{{text|say|Image of Velen|Matis, blood elf lieutenant of the [[Sunhawk]]s, you have been found guilty of genocide against the [[draenei]] people.}}
:{{text|say|Image of Velen|You are to be executed at light's dawning.  Have you anything to say for yourself?}}
:{{text|emote|Matis spits at the image of Velen.}}
:{{text|say|Image of Velen|May the [[Light]] have mercy on your soul.  Take him back to his cell.}}
:{{text|say|Matis|The Light?}}
:{{text|emote|Matis laughs.}}
:{{text|say|Matis|I am [[Blood Knight]], mongrel.  I do not serve the Light, the Light serves me.  If mercy is to be granted, it will be by me.}}
:{{text|say|Matis|You seek to martyr me before my order - so be it.  Strike me down, another will rise in my place and the suffering of the Light - of the conquered - will continue uninterrupted.}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Kuros|You [[Blasphemy|blaspheme]]!  The Light would never allow such an aberration!}}
:{{text|say|Matis|The Light has no choice.  It does as it is commanded.  Just as the [[naaru]] you hold at the core of your vessel will do when we capture and enslave it... Do my words surprise you, blue blood?  Yes we know... We know everything.}}

:{{text|say|Matis|Draenei dog!  Did you know that the one you call [[Vindicator Saruan|Saruan]] wept like a babe as I beat him?  A feeling of euphoria coursed through me, knowing that I had a member of high rank in my grasp.  Were it not for [[Sironas]]' plans for him, I would have tortured him to death... As I do to all draenei that I capture. Alas, I am certain that you will see him again soon...}}

:{{text|say|Vindicator Kuros|Breathe your last breath, heathen.}}
:''Kuros runs over to Matis and slays him.''
:{{text|emote|Vindicator Kuros spits on the corpse of Matis.}}
