==Objectives==
Vindicator Boros at [[Blood Watch]] wants you to slay 10 Sunhawk Spies. 
*[[Sunhawk Spy]] slain (10)

==Description==
Blood Watch is one of two forward bases operated by the Hand of Argus. You have already been to the other base, Azure Watch; things are completely different in Bloodmyst. When we first got here, the land was as beautiful as Azuremyst. We even called it Silvergale but now sickness is spreading across the land, worse yet, the blood elves that we were battling on the [[Exodar]] survived the crash. This brings me to your assignment: Venture northwest into Bladewood and terminate any blood elves that you find.
 
==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1050 [[XP]] (or {{cost||6|60}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

{{itembox|And be able to choose one of the following:|Fist of Argus|Blade of Argus|Hand of Argus Crossfire}}

==Progress==
There are so many of them that I cannot help but think that they are somehow multiplying.

==Completion==
You have returned - and in one piece!

I have some good news, <name>. We have received some new information about the possible location of more survivors. A new crash site has been discovered! When I am done attending to those matters, I will call for you.
