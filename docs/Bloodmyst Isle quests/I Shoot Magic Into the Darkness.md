==Objectives==
Vindicator Boros at [[Blood Watch]] wants you to locate the Sun Portal Site and slay 5 Void Anomalies.
*Sun Portal Site Confirmed
*[[Void Anomaly]] slain (5)

==Description==
Velen states that if the blood elves have been opening rifts between this island and the Outland, there will be residue or anomalies left in the areas where the portals have been opened.  You must search the island for locations that exhibit or display these anomalies.

Be warned, <name>; some of these anomalies will be creatures from the void itself.  Should you find void anomalies, slay them!  Report back to me with any new information that you may find.  Begin your search to the north, near the [[Warp Piston]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Vindicator's Soft Sole Slippers
|Vindicator's Leather Moccasins
|Vindicator's Stompers
|Vindicator's Chain Boots
}}

You will also receive:
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
I've been hearing reports of strange creatures appearing in the area.  Whether they are mutated indigenous animals or true void anomalies is something that you need to find out.

==Completion==
How many did you say you saw at the Warp Piston?  Just how many times have they opened up this sun portal?  This is very bad news...

Alas, you have learned all that I am able to teach you, <name>.  Kuros will call for you when it is time.

==Progression==

==Trivia==
The title of this quest is a reference to a radio sketch done by the Dead Alewives called Dungeons and Dragons, in which a player insists on casting a spell at nothing - "I'm attacking the darkness!"
