==Objectives==
Collect 6 Satyr Totems.
*[[Satyr Totem]] (6)

==Description==
The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] may be one entity, but it is vast. The [[demon]]s that comprise it are as varied as the innumerable worlds they have conquered.

But I have had no dealings with [[satyr]]. From what [[Velen|the Prophet]] has told me, they seem disorganized. Intelligent certainly, but feral in their malevolence.

I am inclined to believe their recent attacks are random, but perhaps not. Bring me the totems they have scattered across [[Bloodmyst Isle|Bloodmyst]]. I may be able to tell ascertain what, if anything, their end goal is.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*6,800 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

==Progress==
I would prefer to know the capabilities of the satyr before engaging them.

==Completion==
Curious.

These crystals appear similar to the others erupting from Bloodmyst, but their placement on these totems seems deliberate.

I will study them further.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
:{{Text|say|[[Chieftain Hatuun]]|Why have you allowed these demons to infest this area for this long?}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|We have lacked the time and resources needed to eliminate them. Other threats strained our forces.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Arzaal]]|Their opportunism ends today. I will slaughter each one personally if needs require it!}}

Collect Satyr Totems around the area.

Upon completion of both:
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|The depth of corruption in these animals... it is not the work of lesser demons.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|There is a larger threat behind these attacks, then?}}
:{{Text|say|Arzaal|Yes. These crystals were made into [[fel spreader]]s. No satyr could do that. A [[man'ari]] [[artificer]] made them--I know it.}}
