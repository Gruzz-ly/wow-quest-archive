==Objectives==
[[Prince Toreth]] at [[Wyrmscar Island]] has asked that you slay [[Razormaw]].
* [[Razormaw]] slain
* Suggested Players [2]
* [[Bundle of Dragon Bones]] (provided)

==Description==
Many of the [[black dragonflight]] were slain during the attacks. One of them, a lieutenant of [[Deathwing]] himself, still haunts this place. If you look to the heavens, you can see his spectral countenance circling the skies. His hatred is so great that he remains even in death.

Take the bones that you gathered for me earlier to the top of the mountain on this island and place them in the [[Ever-burning Pyre|ever-burning pyre]]. This act should signal [[Razormaw]] to descend. When he does, slay his undead form.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Robe of the Dragon Slayer
|Breastplate of the Dragon Slayer
|Vest of the Dragon Slayer
|Chainmail of the Dragon Slayer
}}

You will also receive:
* 200 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

==Progress==
I recommend that you bring allies, <name>.

==Completion==
How long has it been? A thousand years? Ten-thousand perhaps? You have done me and the memory of my people a great service, <name>. Please accept this item of power as a token of appreciation from [[Loreth'Aran]] - in honor of your deeds.
