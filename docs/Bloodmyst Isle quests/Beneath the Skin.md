==Objectives==
Collect 8 Pitted Bones from corrupted wildlife.
*[[Pitted Bones]] (8)

==Description==
[[Arzaal]] and I are of the same mind. We must know the strength of these [[satyr]] before we attempt to drive them back with force. Else we may be walking into a fight we cannot win.

I can learn much about my enemies by observing what damage they leave in their wake.

The wildlife here was corrupted by the [[Exodar]]'s lingering energies, but I suspect the [[demon]]s' presence made it worse.

Collect bones from the local wildlife for me. Studying them may give us some clues.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*850 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

==Progress==
Remember, you are putting them out of their misery.

==Completion==
<Hatuun snaps one of the bones, then sniffs the frothing marrow tentatively and frowns.>

Lesser demons do not corrupt creatures this deeply. Their [[fel]] disease can barely spread beneath the skin, much less the bones or the soul.

These are no weak [[imp]]s we are dealing with.

==Notes==
;Upon accept of both
:{{Text|say|[[Chieftain Hatuun]]|Why have you allowed these demons to infest this area for this long?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Prophet Velen]]|We have lacked the time and resources needed to eliminate them. Other threats strained our forces.}}
:{{Text|say|Arzaal|Their opportunism ends today. I will slaughter each one personally if needs require it!}}

Kill [[Infected Nightsaber]]s and [[Corrupted Grizzly|Corrupted Grizzlies]] neaby to collect [[Pitted Bones]].

Upon completion of both:
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|The depth of corruption in these animals... it is not the work of lesser demons.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|There is a larger threat behind these attacks, then?}}
:{{Text|say|Arzaal|Yes. These crystals were made into [[fel spreader]]s. No satyr could do that. A [[man'ari]] [[artificer]] made them--I know it.}}
