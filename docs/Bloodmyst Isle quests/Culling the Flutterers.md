==Objectives==
Tracker Lyceon at [[Blood Watch]] wants you to kill 10 Royal Blue Flutterers. 
*[[Royal Blue Flutterer]] slain (10)

==Description==
When we first encountered flutterers, they showed few signs of mutation. As the corruption got progressively worse, the moths and other species began to show signs of contamination.

It has progressed to the point where they damage nearly everything they come in contact with. They're amplifying the damage being done by the crystal shards scattered by the [[Exodar]]'s crash. We have no choice but to begin culling their population in the lands north of [[Blood Watch]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Cincture of Woven Reeds
|Ornately Tooled Belt
|Segmented Girdle
|Ornate Wire Cinch
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Have you culled the moths?

==Completion==
In time, we'll have to devise a plan for returning the species to its native state, but for now, periodically culling their numbers is about the best we can hope for. Thank you for your help, <name>.
