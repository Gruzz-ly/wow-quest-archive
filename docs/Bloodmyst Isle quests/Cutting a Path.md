==Objectives==
Kill 10 Enraged Ravagers and return to [[Scout Jorli]] at [[Vindicator's Rest]].
*[[Enraged Ravager]] slain (10)

==Description==
During our mission to reconnoiter the Sunhawks and their portal, I sustained a serious wound. [[Scout Loryi]] has managed to staunch the bleeding and she's trying to figure out a way to evacuate me to [[Blood Watch]].

The problem is that we'd have to abandon our position here in order to guarantee a safe return.

As soon as we leave this consecrated ground, we'll be set upon by [[ravager]]s. If you can clear some of the enraged ravagers, it might allow us to make the trip back safely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1250 [[XP]] (or {{cost||7|80}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Exodar}}

==Progress==
Have you managed to clear some of the ravagers in the area?

==Completion==
It looks a bit better out there, but I still wonder if I wouldn't be better off waiting for a medic here.

==Patch changes==
