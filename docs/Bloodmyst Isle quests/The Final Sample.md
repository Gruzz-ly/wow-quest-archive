This quest concludes the [[Learning from the Crystals quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Get an Axxarian Crystal Sample using the Crystal Mining Pick on the [[Axxarien Crystal]] and bring it to [[Harbinger Mikolaas]] in [[Blood Watch]]. 
*[[Axxarien Crystal Sample]]
*[[Crystal Mining Pick]] (provided)

==Description==
There's just one sample remaining before I can send this set of crystals to the [[Exodar]], <name>. The final sample must come from the satyr stronghold of [[Axxarien]] to the northwest.

I'm not certain what to expect from this crystal sample, but I'm sure there will be some signs of corruption. Take care to mine your shard from the crystal that looks like the ones you took your previous samples from, or else our researchers cannot make a valid comparison.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||10|}}
*1350 [[XP]] (or {{cost||8|40}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Exodar}}

==Progress==
Have you returned with the last sample for my set?

==Completion==
<Harbinger Mikolaas accepts the last crystal from you.>

That rounds out the set. All that remains to be done is to box them and send them to the Exodar.

<The harbinger seems glad to be done with the task.>

Don't get me wrong, <name>, I'm sure the research is valuable, but we're faced with a number of other pressing problems out here.

==Notes==
The Axxarien Crystal{{coords|41|31|Bloodmyst Isle}} you are looking for is quite large.  It can be found near a shrine on the cliff side of the Axxarien camp.

The quest [[Containing the Threat]] also takes you into this camp, cutting down the numbers of [[satyr]] in the area.
