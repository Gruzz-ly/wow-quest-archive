[[Image:HallowsEndWaterBarrel.jpg|thumb|left|Fire brigade water barrel.]]
With the threat of the [[Headless Horseman]] looming, the peacekeepers have been diligent in forming a fire brigade when needed. Do you want to help?

West of here, toward the [[Exodar]], the peacekeepers set up a small area to practice fighting fires. Go there and throw buckets onto the blazes. You can fill a bucket from the water barrel here.

Good bye, <name>.  When you're done with fire brigade practice, please visit us again!

Hello, <name>. Have you been perfecting your fire fighting techniques? Don't forget about the practice area to the south!

==Completion==
You're smudged with soot! You must have been extinguishing fires!

Well done! As an honorary member of the Azuremyst Fire Brigade, I beg you to return here if ever the village needs you!

==Gains==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
* +75 with [[Exodar]]

== Notes ==
With this particular version of [[Fire Brigade Practice|this quest]], it is possible, acting solo, to extinguish all the burning wicker figures.  The figures are in a row, and a fire at one can (at maximum size) throw embers to reignite one two figures away.  The tactic is to reduce the size of the fires that can throw embers onto the figure you are dowsing so they don't reignite it, and simply work from one end to the other.  Unlike some of the horde fires, the [[Azuremyst Peacekeeper]] watching these blazes does not reignite them right away.

Extinguishing all the burning figures will gain you:
