==Objectives==
[[Vindicator Kuros]] at [[Blood Watch]] wants you to recover 12 boxes of Medical Supplies.
*[[Medical Supplies]] (12)

==Description==
We have others pursuing leads on the sun portals, <name>. I need you to focus on the task at hand.

[[Vindicator Boros|Boros]] has received new reports of another crash site. What we've since discovered is that the crash site is actually the [[Exodar]]'s cryo-core. This is a pod holding area that houses pods exactly like the one you crawled out of in [[Ammen Vale]].

This area also holds medical supplies. Head to the Cryo-Core, directly west of Blood Watch. Search for supplies and search for survivors.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Vindicator's Smasher|Vindicator's Letter Opener|Vindicator's Walking Stick}}

You will receive:
*1250 [[XP]] (or {{cost||7|80}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Was the information accurate?

==Completion==
Just [[Blood elf|blood elves]]? No survivors? This is troubling. I'll need some time to think this through, <name>. Perhaps [[Aesom]] or Boros have an assignment for you to complete.

==Patch changes==
