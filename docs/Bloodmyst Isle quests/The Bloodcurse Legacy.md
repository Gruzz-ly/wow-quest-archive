==Objectives==
[[Admiral Odesyus]] has asked that you find and speak with [[Captain Edward Hanes]].

==Description==
Dear friend,

My hand trembles as I ink this letter. I pray that it reaches you in time.

Last night, Edward Hanes, captain of the ship '[[Lost Hope]]', appeared before me in my tent. The same Edward Hanes that died of scurvy 20 years ago.

This apparition told me a tale that made my heart tremble. A tale that I need you to hear and a mission that I need you to accomplish. Will you do it? Will you seek out Edward on [[Wyrmscar Island]], northeast of your base?

Regards,

Admiral Odesyus

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*340 [[XP]] (or {{cost||2|10}} at max level)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
Have you heard of the [[bloodcurse]], landlubber? No, of course you haven't. The bloodcurse is what sunk all these ships. The spoiled, desecrated part of the water here is known as [[Bloodcursed Reef]] - a part of the world you never want to visit. I've been here myself for 20 years.

Scurvy my foot! I died on these wild shores as food for the [[dragon]]s... Ah, but that's another story for another time. Right now, we have to help the poor souls that are trapped in that reef.

==Notes==
If the player abandons the quest, loses the letter without accepting the quest, or is on [[World of Warcraft Starter Edition|Starter Edition]] and cannot receive the letter due to not having access to mail, the quest can also be obtained directly from [[Admiral Odesyus]], in which case the first two and last two paragraphs of the description are removed.
