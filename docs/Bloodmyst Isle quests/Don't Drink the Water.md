==Objectives==
Vindicator Aesom at [[Blood Watch]] wants you to use the Water Sample Flask to get a Bloodmyst Water Sample. 
*[[Bloodmyst Water Sample]] {{coords|33|33|Bloodmyst Isle}}
*[[Water Sample Flask]] (provided)

==Description==
Our shaman claim that the elements of water have become greatly agitated by the pollution of the water source. We know that the Exodar's power core is lodged into the mountain to the west. It must be leaking volatile fluids into the water supply! I need you to get me more information.

<Aesom points to a flask and nods.>

You are to take this flask and follow the beach north until you reach the area where the rivers of Bloodmyst drain into the ocean. Take a sample from that location and return to me. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1350 [[XP]] (or {{cost||8|40}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Exodar}}

==Progress==
Don't drink the water, <name>! 

==Completion==
As I suspected, the water has turned red due to contamination from leaking core fluid.

I hope you didn't swim in any of that contaminated water. 

==Progression==
