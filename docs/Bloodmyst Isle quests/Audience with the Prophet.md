Take the Translated [[Sunhawk Missive]] to [[Prophet Velen]] at the [[Exodar]].
*[[Translated Sunhawk Missive]] (provided)

==Description==
I need you to deliver the translated documents to Velen personally, &lt;name&gt;. I don't trust that deranged messenger.

Explain to the Prophet that the blood elves are receiving reinforcements from the Outland and that they have a spy amongst the draenei at the [[Exodar]]. Velen resides in the Vault of Lights inside the [[Exodar]].

Make haste!

You will receive:
*1150 [[XP]] (or {{cost||7|20}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Exodar}}

==Progress==
<Velen smiles.>

Greetings, <name>. I have been expecting you.

==Completion==
<Velen begins to read the document.>

Interesting... This does indeed explain much.
