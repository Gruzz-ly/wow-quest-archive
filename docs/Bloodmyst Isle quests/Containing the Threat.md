==Objectives==
Kill 5 Axxarien Shadowstalkers, 5 Axxarien Hellcallers, and [[Zevrax]], then gather 5 Corrupted Crystals and return to [[Vindicator Aalesia]] in [[Blood Watch]].
*[[Axxarien Shadowstalker]] slain (5)
*[[Axxarien Hellcaller]] slain (5)
*[[Zevrax]] slain
*[[Corrupted Crystal]] (5)

==Description==
Now that we have made our presence known to the satyr, we must send a message that we will not tolerate the Burning Legion's hounds in these lands.

Too long have the draenei fled in the wake of the Legion and its minions, &lt;name&gt;. Wherever they have found us, they have shown no mercy.

We must not permit the satyr to exploit the Exodar's crash and use the corrupted crystals as weapons. Go north to where their leader resides in Axxarien, destroy him, and recover the corrupted crystals he has been gathering!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Huntsman's Crossbow|Lightspark (item)}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost||10|}}
*1350 [[XP]] (or {{cost||8|40}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
<Vindicator Aalesia seems to look through you rather than at you, her mind fixed on dealing with the satyr.>

Have you moved against the satyr leader as I have asked?

==Completion==
Without their leader, and with the recovery of the corrupted crystals underway, we can safely keep the satyr in check. Light knows how many more of these wretched creatures are out there.

Harbinger Mikolaas and I are grateful for the help you've provided in dealing with the satyr before they could become a larger threat. Your work stands as a reminder that vigilance is the key to victory against the Legion and its minions.
