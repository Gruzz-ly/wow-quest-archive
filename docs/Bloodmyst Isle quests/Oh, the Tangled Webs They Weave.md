==Objectives==
Kill 8 Mutated Tanglers and report to [[Vindicator Corin]] at [[Vindicator's Rest]].
*[[Mutated Tangler]] slain (8)

==Description==
We don't dare abandon our post, or wander too far from Vindicator's Rest, <race>. The mutated creatures closest to the Vector Coil have been changed profoundly by energy leaking from the crystals.

The mutated tanglers appear to have gained a certain degree of sentience. They've learned to create, set, and conceal vicious traps that can ensnare even the most careful warrior.

We'll never be able to move against the Sunhawks if we're constantly forced to look underfoot. Attack the problem at its source, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||10|}}
*1700 [[XP]] (or {{cost||10|20}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Exodar}}

==Progress==
Have you managed to clear any of the mutated tanglers?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>.  It's going to be much easier to get reinforcements from [[Blood Watch]], or launch strikes against the Sunhawks without having to worry about what the tanglers are up to.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
