'''Alien Predators''' sends the players off to hunt down escaped [[ravager]]s before they upset the natural ecology of the area.

==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Bloodmyst Hatchling]]s then return to [[Vorkhan the Elekk Herder]] at [[Kessel's Crossing]] on [[Bloodmyst Isle]]. 
*[[Bloodmyst Hatchling]] slain (10)

==Description==
One thing we've learned in our travels is that extreme care must be taken when introducing wildlife from one world to another. When the [[Exodar]] crashed, it was carrying specimens of various [[Outland]] species, including an insectoid predator called the [[ravager]].

Some of the specimens were lost, but many others survived and took to the wild. If we don't keep them in check, they will upset the natural balance here on the islands.

You'll find these ravagers to the west of Kessel's Crossing, near the coast. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|2 Stone Sledgehammer
|Elekk Handler's Blade
|Old Elekk Prod
|Surplus Bastard Sword
|Long-Reach Elekk Prod
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
We must act before the ravager displaces Bloodmyst Isle's native predators. Have you begun culling the ravager population?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. The ravager population will bear watching for some time to come, but we've made a good start. 

==Notes==
The hatchlings can be found near the coast to the east and south of Vorkhan.
