==Objectives==
Vindicator Aesom at [[Blood Watch]] wants you to slay 10 Sunhawk Pyromancers and 10 Sunhawk Defenders. 
*[[Sunhawk Defender]] slain (10)
*[[Sunhawk Pyromancer]] slain (10)

==Description==
Victory is close at hand, &lt;name&gt;. With the discovery of the sun gate, it won't be long until their supply lines are completely closed off. Now is the time to strike at their numbers.

To the west you will find numerous Sunhawk camps. The Sunhawk pyromancers and defenders occupy the vast majority of the area. Find them, kill them and return to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1350 [[XP]] (or {{cost||8|40}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Their leader can't hide from us forever. We will systematically eliminate every possible hiding place until Sironas is found.

==Completion==
This will surely soften up their defenses and make them think twice before rushing foolishly into our ranks!
