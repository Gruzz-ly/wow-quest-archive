'''Ending Their World''' starts as soon as you accept the quest from [[Demolitionist Legoso]].  You have to escort him and keep him alive during the entire quest.

==Objectives==
Follow and protect [[Demolitionist Legoso]] as he attempts to destroy the [[Vector Coil]] and slay Sironas.  Return to [[Exarch Admetius]] at [[Blood Watch]] should you complete the mission.
* [[Vector Coil]] Destroyed and [[Sironas]] Slain

==Description==
Don't accept this assignment if you value your life.  You see that gigantic power core jutting out of the mountain side over yonder?  Whoever takes on this burden will need to fight their way through that mountain, battling an army of [[Sunhawk]]s while protecting me as I rig the core up for demolition.  Sironas the [[eredar]] is somewhere up there as well.

I won't think less of you if you just walk away, <name>.

But maybe you're the one - the one to destroy the Vector Coil and take down Sironas.  Well, are you?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Blade of the Hand
|Crossbow of the Hand
|Mace of the Hand
|Staff of the Hand
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||35}}
*2350 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Is it done?  Are we victorious?

==Completion==
You have saved the whole of [[Bloodmyst]] and [[Azuremyst]], securing the [[draenei]] way of life on [[Azeroth]], <name>!  For this, there can be no amount of thanks, no reward, nothing large enough in scope to truly express our appreciation.

Yet, there are still so many that were left behind on [[Draenor]] who cannot be here for this historic event.  You must find your way back.  Find your way back to the [[Outland]], Hero of [[Argus]].  Bring our people home.  Home to the land that you saved.  Home to Azeroth...

Upon completion of this quest, an announcement is made to the region and [[Bloodmyst Isle]]'s major NPCs and quest givers assemble outside the tower's entrance to honor your accomplishment: a host of kneeling [[Blade of Argus|Blades of Argus]], and cheering [[Exarch Menelaous]], [[Acteon]], [[Anchorite Fateema]], [[Daedal]], [[Diktynna]], [[High Chief Stillpine]], [[Princess Stillpine]], [[Kurz the Revelator]], [[Stillpine the Younger]], [[Admiral Odesyus]], [[Archaeologist Adamant Ironheart]], [[Injured Night Elf Priestess]], [["Cookie" McWeaksauce]] and several [[Chicken (critter)|chickens]], [[Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare]], [[Kessel]], [[Archimindy]], [[Cowlen]], [[Magwin]], and [[Prophet Velen]]. The quest [[Audience with the Prophet]] sends the player to the Exodar, but it can be turned in here, along with the final step of the storyline, [[The Unwritten Prophecy]].
