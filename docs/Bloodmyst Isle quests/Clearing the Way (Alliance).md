== Objectives ==
[[Vindicator Corin]] at [[Vindicator's Rest]] wants you to slay 8 Sunhawk Saboteurs and 8 Sunhawk Agents. 
*{{NPC|Combat|Sunhawk Agent}} slain (8)
*{{NPC|Combat|Sunhawk Saboteur}} slain (8)

==  Description ==
Only the most battle hardened, noble and positively fearless will submit to [[Demolitionist Legoso|Legoso]]'s mission.  The exarch will not order any agent of the Hand to take on the task of destroying the Vector Coil and dispatching [[Sironas]].  He refuses to send any draenei to their death - which is what the mission is: suicide...

<Corin sighs.>

My job is to soften up the Sunhawk defenses.  You are to slay Sunhawks near the Vector Coil and keep the path clear for our champion - whoever that may be.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Flutterer Silk Handwraps

}}

You will also receive:
* 250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

== Progress ==
Do you see any unusually brave and powerful draenei around here?

==  Completion ==
Hopefully a hero arrives before they are able to call forth reinforcements to guard the area you just secured.
