==Objectives==
Take the Ancient Journal to [[Anchorite Paetheus]] in [[Blood Watch]]. 
*[[Battered Journal]] (provided)

==Description==
Lacking the means to read the book's contents, you think about who might be able to help you separate the author's words from the mapmaker's scrawl.

Remembering Anchorite Paetheus's collection of artifacts from countless cultures, you wonder if his experienced eye might be able to help you decipher the book's contents.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1150 [[XP]] (or {{cost||7|20}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
The Light shine upon you in all your endeavors, <class>. What is it you have there?

==Completion==
Hmm... this is most intriguing. Yes, I should be able to make out what the original author wrote in the pages of this book.

I should have everything I need for the process. This should only take a moment.

==Notes==
;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Anchorite Paetheus|In the process of translating this, I believe I've learned more about the drunken exploits of a certain '[[Andrew Clementine]]' than about the journal's author.}}
:{{Text|say|Anchorite Paetheus|But, no matter. Mister Clementine's... err, 'contribution' notwithstanding, this seems to be the journal of a man named Nolkai. The entries toward the end describe a brutal battle.}}
:{{Text|say|Anchorite Paetheus|Take a look at this passage...}}

==Progression==
