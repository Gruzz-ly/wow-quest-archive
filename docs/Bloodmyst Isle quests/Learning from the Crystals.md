This quest starts the [[Learning from the Crystals quest chain]], leading the character across [[Bloodmyst Isle]] to collect crystal samples for [[Harbinger Mikolaas]].

==Objectives==
Get an Impact Site Crystal Sample using the Crystal Mining Pick on the [[Impact Site Crystal]] and bring it to [[Harbinger Mikolaas]] in [[Blood Watch]]. 
*[[Impact Site Crystal Sample]]
*[[Crystal Mining Pick]] (provided)

==Description==
Welcome to [[Blood Watch]], <class>. Seeing to the defenses of the outpost is my primary concern, but I've also been tasked with a variety of other duties by our leaders at the [[Exodar]].

The problem is that it's hardly safe to send out large amounts of researchers when the island is this dangerous. I need someone to gather a series of crystal samples from various sites on the island.

The first sample I need must come from the ravager infested ship debris south of the town and across the bridge.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Crystal-Flecked Pants
|Crystal-Studded Legguards
|Shard-Covered Leggings
|Shard-Linked Greaves
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Were you able to gather the first crystal sample?

==Completion==
This crystal shard will give our researchers a baseline to compare against samples from other parts of the island, since it comes from one of Bloodmyst's less corrupted regions.

I won't be able to send it off until we have a full set of samples, but this is a great start. If you're willing to help gather the other samples, I'll see to it that you're rewarded for your efforts.

==Notes==
Go south from [[Blood Watch]], and cross the bridge into the area where the grass is the more normal green rather than red.  South and west of the road is the impact site you are looking for.
You are looking for a big red crystal that will highlight as ''Impact Site Crystal'' {{coords|58|83|Bloodmyst Isle}}.
