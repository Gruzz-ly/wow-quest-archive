==Objectives==
Bring the Red Crystal Pendant to [[Morae]] at [[Blood Watch]].
*[[Red Crystal Pendant]] (provided)

==Description==
Examining the crudely constructed pendant, you notice the crystal pulsating softly. Though it emits little light, you can almost feel the crystal radiating a sense of wrongness.

You're not quite sure what might have possessed [[Cruelfin]] to create this pendant, but the find is too important to ignore. You should probably show it to someone at [[Blood Watch]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||5|}}
*900 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|40}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Exodar}}

==Progress==
What is it you have there?

==Completion==
This is most curious, <class>. I don't believe we've ever seen the [[murloc]]s wearing any kind of adornment before.

Given the corrupting influence that the crystal shards are known to have, the murloc that wore this pendant must have believed it granted him power over his fellows. I wouldn't be surprised if he had rapidly outgrown his fellow murlocs and gained in strength.
