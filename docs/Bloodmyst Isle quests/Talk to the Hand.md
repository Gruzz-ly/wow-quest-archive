== Objectives ==
Report to [[Scout Jorli]] at Vindicator's Rest. 
==  Description ==
The Hand of Argus has established a forward base at Vindicator's Rest, but they are sorely outnumbered by both the blood elves and mutated wildlife. Without backup, their outpost is in danger of falling, and we'd have no way to keep an eye on events near the Vector Coil.

Report to [[Scout Jorli]] at Vindicator's Rest to the northwest and offer her your assistance, &lt;name&gt;. 

==  Completion ==
I was hoping [[Blood Watch]] would send reinforcements once they learned what we're up against. 

==  Gains ==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*140 [[XP]] (or {{cost|||90}} at level 70)
