==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Myst Spinner]]s, 8 [[Myst Leecher]]s and their leader, [[Zarakh]]. Return to [[Achelus]] at [[Blood Watch]] when the task is complete. 
*[[Myst Spinner]] slain (8)

*[[Zarakh]] slain

==Description==
About a week ago, my research team and I were out exploring the western wilds of [[Bloodmyst Isle|Bloodmyst]] when we were attacked by bloodthirsty [[spider]]s. The effect of the crystal contamination was clearly evident as these spiders were massive and extremely aggressive.

I managed to escape but my team wasn't so lucky. We must not let the same fate befall others. Go west to the [[Amberweb Pass]] and destroy the spiders and their matriarch, [[Zarakh]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||30}}
*1450 [[XP]] (or {{cost||9|}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
It was a terrible mess...

==Completion==
Incredible! Did you find any survivors?

<Achelus lowers his voice to a whisper.>

I'll be honest, <name>; nobody else was willing to take on this mission. You are a brave <class>...
