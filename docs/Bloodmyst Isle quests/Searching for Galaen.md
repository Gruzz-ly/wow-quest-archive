== Objectives ==
Search for [[Morae]]'s husband [[Galaen]].

== Description ==
Do you think often of your family, <name>? There were a number of families aboard the [[Exodar]], but I've heard of very few being reunited.

I, myself, am looking for traces of my husband Galaen, who was a technician in the [[Cryo-Core]]. The wreckage of it is located to the west, and it's swarming with [[Blood elf|blood elves]]!

I must find out what became of Galaen! Even news of his death is better than never knowing. My husband will be wearing a pendant identical to my own; they were a gift from my sister.

== Completion ==
The corpse appears to be dressed in the manner of an Exodar technician, but the pendant described by Morae is absent.

== Gains ==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*1350 [[XP]] (or {{cost||8|40}} at level 70)
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar]]
