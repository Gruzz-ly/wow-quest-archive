==Objectives==
Discover the source of the fel concentration in [[Axxarien]] and destroy it.
*Source of [[fel]] revealed
*[[Romuul]] called for aid
*Speak to [[Velen]]
*Generator defended

==Description==
Can you hear that? The silence?

The area is empty. Not even the rabid wildlife dare approach the camp.

I do not see any immediate cause, but the fel resonance here is overwhelming. I sense it was woven by [[man'ari]] hands, but I'm being blocked from probing more deeply.

Something is being hidden.

It must be the cloaking magic Hatuun reported from the other camp that hinders me. I can dispel it, but I cannot guarantee what we will find when I do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|80}}
*8,500 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

==Progress==
This ends here!

==Completion==
It is done.

I could not have imagined the threat in [[Bloodmyst Isle|Bloodmyst]] had grown this dangerous.

Thank the [[Light]] that I chose to bring Hatuun and Arzaal here. This could not have been done without them--without all of us.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Arzaal|This [[satyr]] camp appears abandoned. But the fel resonance is stronger here than anywhere else on the island.}}
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|It is too quiet here. Be wary of an ambush.}}
:{{Text|say|Arzaal|Hatuun is right. Something is hidden here, and I will reveal it.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|Do what you must, Arzaal. We will follow your lead.}}
:{{Text|say|Arzaal|[Demonic] Maladath enkil, maev raka tiros!}}
:''Arzaal casts a spell revealing fel spreaders everywhere.''
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|More fel spreaders! Buried... across the whole island--hundreds of them!}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|We must act quickly. <Name>, call Romuul, we need his aid.}}

Use the Call Romuul extra action button:
:{{Text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|Ah, uh, <name>? I am a little busy right now with the preparations. What do you need?}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|Romuul, transport one of our generators to <name>'s location immediately.}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|What? Uh... Yes, Prophet! Right away! Calibrating transport. Generator inbound!}}

The [[Arkonite Generator]] is transported to the adventurer's location. Speak with Velen next:
{{Dialogue|
I expect the satyr will swarm us once we begin to charge the generator.

Tell me when you are ready to begin.

{{Gossip|quest=|I am ready.}}}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|Hatuun and I will overcharge the generator. The satyr will sense the energy building. <Name>, Arzaal, hold them off.}}
:{{Text|say|Arzaal|With pleasure.}}

Fend off [[Axxarien Fleshrender]]s and [[Axxarien Ragehide]]s until [[Sironas]] shows up.
:{{Text|say|Sironas|You will not ruin my plans again, draenei. My magic has claimed this land, and will soon claim every last soul in your wrecked city!}}

After defeating Sironas an in-game cutscene plays out:
:''The light explosion caused by the overcharged generator destroys all the fel spreaders.''
{{#ev:youtube|YD_a5hxS2a0|urlArgs=start=179&end=203}}

:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|This threat was beyond what I expected to find here. But it could not stand against us united.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|With the corruption removed, Bloodmyst will finally begin to heal. As will our people--together.}}

Arzaal and Hatuun have new gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Arzaal|If Sironas reforms one day, I will rip her soul apart myself.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Hatuun|I will admit that Velen's plan was... serviceable.}}

==Progression==
{{Draenei heritage}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2024-05-10|bluenote=Players can now call for aid while mounted.}}
*{{Patch 10.2.7|note=Added.}}
