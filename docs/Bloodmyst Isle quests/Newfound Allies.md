== Objectives ==
Take the Letter of Introduction to [[Huntress Kella Nightbow]].
* [[Letter of Introduction]] (provided)

== Description ==
[[Harbinger Mikolaas]] has done a commendable job of safeguarding [[Blood Watch]], <class>, but our enemies are many and our resources few.

Our weakness is well known to our enemies, but your contact with the forces of the [[Alliance]] is something they haven't accounted for. I have prepared a letter of introduction to the people of [[Auberdine]], the closest Alliance settlement, proposing cooperation in the fight against our foes. Take it with you and seek out Huntress Kella Nightbow near the docks west of the [[Exodar]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 800 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]

== Progress ==
Greetings, <class>.  What have you there?

== Completion ==
I can help you get to Auberdine. Fortunately, it's only a short boat trip away!

== Notes ==
*This quest was intended to direct the character from [[Bloodmyst Isle]] to [[Darkshore]] through [[Auberdine]], where further quests can be found.  Instead, one could go up [[Teldrassil]] and start quests in [[Shadowglen]], or take the flight path to [[Lor'danel]].
*Before [[patch 4.0.3a]], this quest was followed with [[The Way to Auberdine]]. Strangely, the description of the remaining quest still mentions Auberdine, even though it is now destroyed.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
