== Objectives ==
Captain [[Edward Hanes]] on [[Wyrmscar Island]] wants you to kill 10 Bloodcursed Naga. 
* [[Bloodcursed Naga]]  slain (10)

== Description ==
They say when the world was sundered, this land cried the loudest. It was here that thousands of night elves faded into oblivion and in their place rose terrible creatures of hate - the naga.

Obedient to their twisted queen, [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]], they would destroy all that would dare pass through their sea. It would remain this way for thousands of years - until now.

The first order of business is to remove the bloodcursed naga from the reef.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1350 [[XP]] (or {{cost||8|40}} at level 70)
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
They're nasty creatures...

== Completion ==
A good start, but there's much more to be done!
