==Objectives==
Locate the pavilion described by the map and search for what the map's maker was trying to record.
* [[Weathered Treasure Map]] (provided)

==Description==
The crudely-drawn map reveals nothing of its maker, but it appears to have been drawn with an unsteady hand. Wavering lines and symbols depict a small pavilion with broken columns located to the west of a partially submerged tower.

If the map is to be believed, this cluster of ruins appears to be located on the eastern coast of the island. You have no idea what you'll find, but it was important enough for the map's creator to record.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||9}}
*130-1150 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Darnassus}}

==Progress==
Perhaps this old journal is what the map is referencing.

==Completion==
Examining the book carefully, you conclude that it must be a journal. Its pages are filled with an elegant script differing from that of the map. The text of many of the pages is obscured by drawings and writing in the mapmaker's hand.

It's nearly impossible to make out the text beneath the mapmaker's tales of drunken carousing during shore leave.

==Notes==
This quest ends at a book{{coords|61.2|41.9|Bloodmyst Isle}} at the [[Ruins of Loreth'Aran]].  It is in the ruined gazebo that is farther north of the main ruins.
