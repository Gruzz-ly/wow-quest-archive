==Objectives==
Meet Velen and Hatuun in Nazzivian to search for signs of man'ari presence in the area.
*Meet [[Velen]] and [[Hatuun]] in [[Nazzivian]]
*Man'ari evidence found (3)

==Description==
I cannot in good conscience gather the [[draenei]] for the [[Tishamaat]] if we are threatened this close to home.

If one of the [[man'ari]] is using the [[satyr]] to orchestrate these attacks, or to distract us from some larger foul purpose, then they must be rooted out immediately.

We will divide our efforts to look for signs of the enemy. [[Arzaal]] will search the northern satyr camp. You, Hatuun, and myself will search the closer camp.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*6,800 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

==Completion==
We did not find the man'ari responsible. But when we do, they will pay.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|Arzaal, search the satyr camp to the north. <Name>, Hatuun, come with me and search the camp to the west.}}
:{{Text|say|Arzaal|Of course. Hatuun, take this sargerite shard. It will guide you towards any [[fel]] magic of man'ari origin.}}
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|Sargerite? If you think it will help, Arzaal.}}
:''They head out.''

Follow suit and travel to [[Nazzivian]] to meet up with Velen and Hatuun.
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|Let us begin our search.}}

The area is patrolled by [[Nazzivus Darkblade]]s, [[Nazzivus Felcaller]]s, and [[Corrupting Servant]]s. Use the Sargerite Shard to track down and destroy the first [[Crystalline Felspreader]].
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|A cloaking spell? Cowardly [[Burning Legion|Legion]] tactics. Why did you not see this before, Velen?}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|I... do not know. But we must destroy it!}}

Track down the second felspreader.
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|Fel spreaders were rooting the corruption to [[Bloodmyst Isle|Bloodmyst]] all this time and you let it run rampant! Why?}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|To protect the [[Rangari]], I pulled them out of Bloodmyst. Their lives were worth more to me. I stand by my decision.}}

Locate the final felspreader.
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|It is done. The sargerite shard is no longer reacting to energies here.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|Indeed. We should return it to Arzaal at the northern camp.}}

Meet up with Arzaal, Velen and Hatuun in [[Axxarien]]. The character has the Urgency buff.
:{{Text|say|Arzaal|This satyr camp appears abandoned. But the fel resonance is stronger here than anywhere else on the island.}}

Arzaal and Hatuun have new gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Arzaal|
[[Demon]]s will corrupt areas not only to claim territory, but also to empower themselves.

The stronger the corruption, the more power we can draw from it, like metal being heated by a fire.

If I am correct, a man'ari conscripted these satyr to hide their [[fel spreader]]s across [[Bloodmyst Isle|Bloodmyst]] for exactly that purpose.

Whoever they are, they would be rather powerful by now.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Hatuun|
It does not surprise me that Velen has had demons on his doorstep this whole time.

But at least they will be dead now. I take much satisfaction in that.}}

Upon quest completion, Velen, too, has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
If Hatuun and Arzaal are correct, we may have an opportunity to end this here and now.

I will not see it squandered.}}
