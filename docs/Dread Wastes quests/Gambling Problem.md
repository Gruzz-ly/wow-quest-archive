==Objectives==
Speak with [[Deck Boss Arie]] at [[Soggy's Gamble]] in [[Dread Wastes]].

==Description==
If this war is to be won we cannot afford to leave anything unchecked, outsider.

There is a disturbance among the coast that needs to be investigated. The presence there is not of [[mantid|our kind]] and are of no value to us. However, their supplies could prove very valuable.

If there is anything of use there we must get to it before the empress.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|14}}
*23600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So the bugs have taken an interest in us, have they? Well if they want somethin' from us they'll have to come and earn it themselves!

You work for what you get here. That means you too!

==Notes==
This is an optional breadcrumb to [[Soggy's Gamble]], an [[Anglers]] outpost along the southern shore of [[Dread Wastes]]. Ambersmith Zikk will offer it upon completion of "The Might of the Klaxxi" criterion of [[Dread Haste Makes Dread Waste]].
