==Objectives==
[[File:Klaxxi'vess - A Unified Swarm.png|thumb|Klaxxi'vess.]]
Infiltrate Klaxxi'vess.
*Speak with [[Taoshi]] outside of Klaxxi'vess ({{coords|56.4|29.6|Dread Wastes}})
*[[Corrupted Amber (object)|Corrupted Amber]] destroyed (5)
*Escape [[Klaxxi'vess]]

==Description==
It seemed as though the [[mantid]] had been producing the corrupted [[amber]] for some time before our... intervention. It stands to reason that they are keeping a stockpile of it somewhere.

The [[Shado-Pan]]'s [[scout]]s have been reporting an increased presence of the swarm's [[warrior]]s in Klaxxi'vess. I would wager that they are guarding the corrupted amber.

Meet me there. If we have a chance to destroy that amber, then we need to take it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|80|}}
*22,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
If the entire swarm were empowered by that corrupted amber, [[N'Zoth]] would have an unstoppable army under his command.

==Notes==
;Accept
: {{text|say|Taoshi|Remain unseen as you approach Klaxxi'vess. We will require the element of surprise.}}

;Speak with Taoshi outside of Klaxxi'vess
Ready to go?

{{gossip|Let's go.}}

: ''Taoshi joins you and stealths you. A Sap ability button is provided.''
: {{text|say|Taoshi|We stand no chance against the [[Klaxxi]] on our own. Focus on destroying the amber.}}

;Getting near the entrance guard
: {{text|say|Taoshi|I can incapacitate the guards if necessary. Speak to me again if we are discovered.}}

;Reapplying stealth
:{{Gossip|Return us to the shadows.}}

* NOTE: It is imperative that you do NOT Sap any mobs if you have the [[Raining Blood]] enhancement active, as that will cause Taoshi to attack it and break the stealth. You should be able to go to the left and around the far side of the stone pillar.

;Escape Klaxxi'vess
Head south to the rendevous point to continue.

: ''Reaching the point on the south road leading out of Klaxxi'vess, Taoshi unstealths you and heads up the rise to the southwest.''
:{{text|say|Taoshi|That appears to be all of them. Let's head for higher ground.}}
: ''At the top of the cliff, Taoshi has a Shado-Pan Kite all ready to go.''
