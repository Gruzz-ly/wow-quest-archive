==Objectives==
Kill 200 Mantid and 3 Kunchong or Dread Behemoths while flying with Xaril the Poisoned Mind.
*Speak to [[Xaril the Poisoned Mind]]
*[[Mantid]] slain (200)
*[[Kunchong]] or [[Dread Behemoth]]s slain (3)

==Description==
The swarm begins, Wakener!  The mantid amass at the [[Heart of Fear]].

Already they fill the skies with their wings and rend the earth with their claws.  They shall not stop the dark march until their bodies are laid open and bleeding upon the ground.

This we shall gladly do.  We will attack them from above.  While I fly, use my poisons to destroy their advance.

Do not mix the two serums until you are ready to attack.  The reaction can be quite... violent.

Speak to me when you are ready to go.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Such wonderful destruction!

==Completion==
Well done, Wakener.  You have a destroyer's aim.

==Notes==
*Speaking with [[Xaril the Poisoned Mind|Xaril]] to initiate the quest while mounted with [[skyriding]] enabled will cause the player to disconnect. Be sure to dismount before starting the run for this quest.

===Dialogue===
Speak with Xaril to initiate the run:
:{{Gossip|I am ready to fly, Xaril.}}

Bomb [[Krik'thik Wingguard]]s, [[Ik'thik Warrior]]s, [[Krik'thik Wingleader]]s, [[Ik'thik Slayer]]s, [[Krik'thik Battletank]]s, [[Ik'thik Kunchong]], and [[Dread Behemoth]]s.

During the fly-around near the Heart of Fear, any random Empress council member will appear to get bombed. It's like bombing [[Brutallus]] during the Sunwell Bombing when doing [[Isle of Quel'Danas]]. Bomb them triggers responses from them:

;[[Amber-Shaper Un'sok]]
*{{text|yell|Yes, my little monsters! Go! Unleash yourselves upon our enemies!}}
*{{text|yell|The next stage of my experiment begins!}}
*{{text|say|Ahh, if I could just get my hands on you! You would make a very nice experiment!}}
*{{text|say|Auuugghhh! That hurt!}}
*{{text|say|Are you... afraid?}}

;[[Blade Lord Ta'yak]]
*{{text|yell|The swarm is the blade that will cut through our enemies!}}
*{{text|yell|A single cut should do.}}
*{{text|yell|Our enemies will fall beneath our blades!}}
*{{text|say|Do you wish to test the edge of my blade?}}
*{{text|say|I smell the stench of Klaxxi disobedience! Stop running and face the Lord of Blades!}}
*{{text|say|Ahahhhaahaa... was that supposed to hurt?}}

;[[Imperial Vizier Zor'lok]]
*{{text|yell|Trust in the might of your Empress. She shall lead us to glory!}}
*{{text|yell|Together, the swarm will rise higher than any empire this land has ever known!}}
*{{text|yell|The will of the Empress is our own. Her greatness is our greatness. Her victory is a victory for the swarm!}}
*{{text|say|You dare challenge the voice of the Empress? What the voice speaks, the swarm hears!}}
*{{text|say|[[Blasphemy]]! You are not one of the swarm!}}
*{{text|say|You are but one against the Empress's divine wrath! You, too, will fall!}}

;[[Wind Lord Mel'jarak]]
*{{text|yell|The cold wind blows. The time of the swarm has begun!}}
*{{text|yell|Do they think a wall can stop us? Do they believe that stone can stand against those who ride upon the wind?}}
*{{text|yell|The swarm shall darken the skies with our numbers! We shall cast eternal night upon this land!}}
*{{text|say|A pitiful attempt.}}
*{{text|say|Infiltrator! You cannot hope to stop the swarm!}}
*{{text|say|Flying away, little rider? A true champion would face me in the heart of fear!}}
