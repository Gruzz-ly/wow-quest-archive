==Objectives==
Slap [[Rikkilea Flitterling]]s, then catch 88 flecks of Flitterling Dust.
*[[Flitterling Dust]] (88)

==Description==
I think that old paper said something about "fiery wings." Those [[faerie dragon|little dragons]] around here have wings. They're kind of fiery, in a way.

You're quicker than me. Try catching some of those dragons... or at least slapping the powder off of them.

No point in killing a harmless little dragon, if all you want is the sparkle from their wings.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I haven't been able to catch any of those things!

==Completion==
YEAH!!! FLITTERLING DUST!!!

<Olon throws the powder into the pot.>

This brew is turning out... strange, and pretty smelly. I'm starting to think maybe Lya was right.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Incantations Fae and Primal]] and [[The Horror Comes A-Rising]] before heading out.

The faerie dragons are closest. Run up to one and click on it. Then follow it as it starts flying away. Get between the sparkles and the ground to catch them. Afterword, head northwest to [[Rikkilea]] and start killing the [[gyreworm]]s. The named mistlurkers are at the west end of Rikkilea.
