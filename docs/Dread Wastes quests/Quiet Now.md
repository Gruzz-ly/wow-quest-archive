==Description==
On the southwestern corner of Zan'vess lie the Whispering Stones.  Much like the towers here, they are critical in transmitting long-range sonic signals.

An adjunct of the Empress operates the stones, keeping her in communication with the Zan'thik forces.  Disrupt the signal, then silence him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Information is power.

==Completion==
It must drive her further into paranoia and madness, losing contact with Zan'vess.

Good.  Let her suffer.
