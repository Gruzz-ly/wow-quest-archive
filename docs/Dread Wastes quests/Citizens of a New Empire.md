==Objectives==
Gather 10 Vor'thik Eggs from [[Kypari Vor]].
*[[Vor'thik Eggs]] (10)

==Description==
At [[Grand Empress Shek'zeer|Shek'zeer]]'s command, the great [[kypari]] tree of Kypari Vor was twisted into a totem of horror.

Like those outside of the palace, the clutch nearby is now used to corrupt our swarmborn.

Recover the eggs of the [[Vor'thik]] before they are tainted. We shall raise them here. They shall be the citizens of a new empire, free from the [[sha]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Kypari Vor was beautiful once. Rich with [[amber]] and surrounded by prime hunting grounds. Its proximity to the wall made it ideal as a forward clutch from which we could easily reinforce our swarm.

==Completion==
They are large. They will hatch soon.

Good. We may need them.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Dreadsworn]], [[A Cry From Darkness]], and [[Concentrated Fear]] before heading out.

Head northeast to [[Kypari Vor]] to get started killing dreadsworn, killing fear-shapers for amber foci, picking up eggs, and taking out [[Qi'tar the Deathcaller]].
