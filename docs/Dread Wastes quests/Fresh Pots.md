==Objectives==
[[File:Sea Monarch.jpg|thumb|[[Sea Monarch]].]]
Kill [[Sea Monarch]]s and use their meat to bait [[Empty Crab Pot]]s in the [[Shelf of Mazu]].
*Crab Pots Baited x10

==Description==
We got a load of empty crab pots out there that need fresh bait.

Now, we COULD pull them one at a time and bait them up here in comfort. A nice chair to sit on, maybe a hot cup of tea to keep you warm. Sounds nice, doesn't it?

Never gonna happen.

Head to Lonesome Cove, immediately southwest, and bait those pots with fresh sea monarchs. By "fresh" I mean killed right there in the water.

Oh, and by "pots" I mean traps. If you wanna be part of the crew, you'd better learn the lingo.

==Progress==
What's wrong, green? You aren't afraid of the dark, icy sea are you?

==Completion==
Not bad, green, not bad.

==Notes==
Pick up [[You Otter Know]] before heading out.

Head out in the water, east to the [[Lonesome Cove]]. Kill neutral Sea Monarchs for their [[Sea Monarch Chunks]] and use them to bait the [[Empty Crab Pot]]s. Avoid the [[Dreadmaw Grouper]]s.
