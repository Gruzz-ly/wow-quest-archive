==Objectives==
Speak with [[Sapmaster Vu]] at [[Brewgarden|The Brewgarden]] in [[Dread Wastes]].

==Description==
Scouts have reported a non-[[mantid]] presence near [[Kor'vess]]. Their intrusion and their theft of amber would normally be dealt with swiftly, but our forces are needed elsewhere.

This task seems suited to you, Wakener. You will convince them to leave this land, or you will destroy them in the name of the [[Klaxxi'va]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|14}}
*23600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So they want us to leave, do they? What a selfish request! We're only taking amber from one tree.

Well, I'm not going anywhere! I have brew to make.

If you help us maybe we can all come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I give them some brew, they stop trying to kill us.

==Notes==
This is an optional breadcrumb to [[The Sunset Brewgarden]]. Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver will offer it upon completion of "The Might of the Klaxxi" criterion of [[Dread Haste Makes Dread Waste]].

==Progression==
