==Objectives==
[[File:Vengeful Gurthani Spirit.jpg|thumb|[[Vengeful Gurthani Spirit]].]]
Slay 6 Vengeful Gurthani Spirits in the [[Terrace of Gurthan]].
*[[Vengeful Gurthani Spirit]] slain (6)

==Description==
I can hear them howling in rage... The spirits of the Gurthani mogu I slayed so long ago. They wander this ruined terrace, seeking vengeance.

If they find me in this state, I will not have the strength to fend them off. Draw their attention and put them down.

Finish what I started, and I will tell you who I am.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
The mogu of Clan Gurthan are [[quilen]] lords. Do not wake [[Ancient Guardian (Dread Wastes)|their guardians]].

==Completion==
We have a common enemy in the mogu. And perhaps others.

We shall see.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Wakening Sickness]] before heading out.

All over the terrace. Keep away from the [[Ancient Guardian (Dread Wastes)|ancient guardians]], as they will wake up and aggro if any fighting takes place within 18 yards of them.

==Progression==
{{Finding the Klaxxi}}
