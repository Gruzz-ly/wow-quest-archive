==Objectives==
Kill 3 Ik'thik Genemancers and 6 Ik'thik Egg-Drones.
*[[Ik'thik Egg-Drone]] slain (6)
*[[Ik'thik Genemancer]] slain (3)

==Description==
Far to the south, Wakener, the Empress's genemancers set about their dark experiments. (Dark yes, but not as dark as mine!)

They dissect and mutate the nearby wildlife, breeding creatures of their own design. (Their design, which will become my design!)

We must not let them succeed! (No, no! Only I am allowed such power!)

Their mutations are already being unleashed for war. Go! Destroy them at any cost!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Is it done? Are my competitio - I mean, our enemies - dead?

==Completion==
Yes, yes! They are dead!

Thank you, Wakener. Well done.

==Notes==
Fly to the southeast part of the zone, past the [[Lake of Stars]] to the [[Chittering Coast]]. Start killing mantid, and remember to weaken and kill the scorpid for [[A Little Brain Work]] as well. Wrap up the other dailies in the area before heading back to [[Klaxxi'vess]].
