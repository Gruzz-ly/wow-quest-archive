==Objectives==
Collect 8 Venomous Stingers.
*[[Venomous Stinger (quest item)]] (8)

==Description==
If we are to strike against the [[Grand Empress Shek'zeer|Empress]], we must arm ourselves with weapons. My own choice of weapon is of a particularly toxic design.

The [[scorpion]]s wandering the ledge produce a deadly venom that they store in their tails.

Bring me their stingers, and I will show you how I earned the title of paragon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40|}} (or {{cost|19|84|50}} at max level)
*236,000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Klaxxi|The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Did you feel the venomtail's sting? Such lovely pain.

==Completion==
Well done, Wakener. I hope you handled these stingers carefully.

The natural poison from these scorpions is deadly, but slow.
