==Objectives==
Obtain 3 Large Mushan Teeth.
*[[Large Mushan Tooth]] (3)

==Description==
That recipe said: "rending daggers of the great ones"...

<Olon ponders this line.>

Mushan! That's it!

There's plenty of mushan roaming out there with these great, big teeth... they're as long as daggers. That's gotta be what the recipe calls for.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I wonder how we'll mix those things into the brew? Can't grind them up - that'd be too gritty.

Maybe I'll just soak 'em for a while?

==Completion==
I never thought of putting mushan teeth in a brew before.

That scroll's got some wacky ideas.

==Notes==
Pick up [[I Bring Us Great Shame]], [[Bound With Shade]], and [[Rending Daggers]] before heading out.

Circle around the tree to the southeast, killing mushan along the way for teeth. Any [[Sha-Haunted Rodent]]s are worth 2 Shade units and have a nominal amount of health, but don't go out of the way to kill them.

The mugs are immediately to the east of [[Fear Clutch]] on the [[Horrid March]] in a big pile on a rock. The keg is on the opposite side of the Horrid March immediately to the south of the entrance of the [[Amber Vault]], not far from [[Chen Stormstout]], who offers his next quest: [[Evie Stormstout (quest)]]. A few yards further southeast are the Lost Picnic Supplies next to a sha-corrupted tree.

Groups of 3-4 [[Nagging Dreadling]]s litter the area and can be easily taken out with a few AoE spells for 3 Shade units each. [[Dread Lurker]]s are worth 10 Shade units each, but beware of their Dread Claw attack!

On the [[Horrid March]] south of the tree, [[Kz'Kzik]] spawns next to the catapult just south of the tree, and [[Ilikkax]] is to the southwest in the [[Fear Clutch]].
