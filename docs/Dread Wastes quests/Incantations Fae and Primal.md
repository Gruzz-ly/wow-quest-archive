==Objectives==
[[File:Ahgunoss.jpg|thumb|[[Ahgunoss]].]]
[[File:Mygoness.jpg|thumb|[[Mygoness]].]]
Slay Ahgunoss and Mygoness.
*[[Ahgunoss]] slain {{co|32.1|17.4|Dread Wastes}}
*[[Mygoness]] slain {{co|33.1|19.2|Dread Wastes}}

==Description==
I suspect we are going to need the help of these [[sprite]]s.

We have two enchanted daggers, bound together with wood and shade. Now we need someone to perform ancient "incantations" on our artifact.

Before we ask for favors, let's show the sprites that we mean well. I heard their leader talking about a pair of [[mistlurker]]s that kidnapped several of their villagers. If we slay these fog beasts... we may get the "incantation" we need in return.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hope we're on the right track...

==Completion==
Nice work. I've heard the sprites talking about us.

We're getting their attention.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Fiery Wings]] and [[The Horror Comes A-Rising]] before heading out.

The faerie dragons are closest. Run up to one and click on it. Then follow it as it starts flying away. Get between the sparkles and the ground to catch them. Afterword, head northwest to [[Rikkilea]] and start killing the [[gyreworm]]s. The named mistlurkers are at the west end of Rikkilea.
