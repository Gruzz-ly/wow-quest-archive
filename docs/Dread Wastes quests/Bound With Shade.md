[[File:Sha-Haunted Rodent.jpg|thumb|[[Sha-Haunted Rodent]].]]
Harvest 100 drops of Shade by slaying [[sha]] creatures and wildlife near [[Sunset Brewgarden|The Sunset Brewgarden]].
*Shade Harvested (100)

==Description==
About that scroll you found...

I keep looking at that line in the second stanza - "bound with wood and shade". The "shade", in particular, intrigues me.

I must admit, I've often considered taking some of the area's residual sha essence and incorporating it into a brew. I suspect that this is the shade which our recipe calls for.

You will find large amalgamations of sha to the southeast of our tree... though you may also be able to harvest some from the local wildlife.

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You needn't look far to find shade around here, friend.

==Completion==
Beautiful. This will make a fine addition to our brew.

The most dangerous ingredients are quite often the most delicious.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Sapmaster Vu|Nearby sha creatures have the shade I'm looking for... though you might find a little bit on the nearby wildlife. Good luck!}}
Pick up [[I Bring Us Great Shame]], [[Daggers of the Great Ones]], and [[Rending Daggers]] before heading out.

Circle around the tree to the southeast, killing mushan along the way for teeth. Any [[Sha-Haunted Rodent]]s are worth 2 Shade units and have a nominal amount of health, but don't go out of the way to kill them.

The mugs are immediately to the east of [[Fear Clutch]] on the [[Horrid March]] in a big pile on a rock. The keg is on the opposite side of the Horrid March immediately to the south of the entrance of the [[Amber Vault]], not far from [[Chen Stormstout]], who offers his next quest: [[Evie Stormstout (quest)]]. A few yards further southeast are the Lost Picnic Supplies next to a sha-corrupted tree.

Groups of 3-4 [[Nagging Dreadling]]s litter the area and can be easily taken out with a few AoE spells for 3 Shade units each. [[Dread Lurker]]s are worth 10 Shade units each, but beware of their Dread Claw attack!

On the [[Horrid March]] south of the tree, [[Kz'Kzik]] spawns next to the catapult just south of the tree, and [[Ilikkax]] is to the southwest in the [[Fear Clutch]].
