==Objectives==
Slay 6 Vor'thik Dreadsworn at [[Kypari Vor]].
*[[Vor'thik Dreadsworn]] slain (6)

==Description==
The [[Klaxxi]] see far and hear much. They have shared their insight with me.

The [[Vor'thik]] embrace the [[sha]], using its power to fuel their march in this false swarm. Their warriors consume tainted amber and call themselves the dreadsworn.

Their is no future for them. They are waste which needs disposing.

And YOU will begin that process for us when you reach Kypari Vor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Cut down the dreadsworn if you wish to please the Klaxxi.

==Completion==
In disciplined hands, the spear is the perfect weapon. Only the weak would augment it with sorcery.

And we have no need for the weak.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Citizens of a New Empire]], [[A Cry From Darkness]], and [[Concentrated Fear]] before heading out.

Head northeast to [[Kypari Vor]] to get started killing dreadsworn, killing fear-shapers for amber foci, picking up eggs, and taking out [[Qi'tar the Deathcaller]].
