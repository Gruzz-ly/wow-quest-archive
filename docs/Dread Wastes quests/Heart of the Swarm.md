==Objectives==
Fly with [[Taoshi]] on the [[Shado-Pan]] Kite.
* Ride the [[Shado-Pan Kite]]
* Scout the [[Heart of Fear]]
* Escape the [[Dread Wastes]]

==Description==
We need to know what we're up against. Before we return to the [[Serpent's Spine]], we should take the opportunity to scout the swarm.

I will fly us over the [[Heart of Fear]]. We should be able to survey [[Grand Empress Shek'zara|Empress Shek'zara]]'s forces from above. Then we can determine the extent to which [[N'Zoth]] has bolstered their ranks with his own.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A close call. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
* The quest name is likely a reference to the ''StarCraft II'' expansion ''Heart of the Swarm''.

;Ride the Shado-Pan Kite
: ''The player jumps up on the kite in a standing position facing backwards. Taoshi steers the kite around the south side of the [[Clutches of Shek'zeer]].''
: {{text|say|Taoshi|This is strictly reconnaissance. We take stock of the empress's forces and return to the Serpent's Spine.}}
: ''On approaching the entrance of the Heart of Fear, however, Shek'zara herself comes out.''

;Scout the Heart of Fear
: {{text|yell|Grand Empress Shek'zara|Meddlers! Come, my swarm! Show them the price for defying the Deep One!}}

;Escape the Dread Wastes
: ''Taoshi immediately turns the kite on its tail and flees eastward, but masses of [[Zara'thik Swarmling]]s are converging on your position.''
: {{text|say|Taoshi|We need to get out of here, now! Use these fireworks to hold off the swarm!}}

You can spam the vehicle action button to instantly kill any groups of swarmlings that you're aiming at all around the kite. Finally around the area of the [[Writhingwood]], the mantid are left behind and Taoshi parachutes you onto the Serpent's Spine.
