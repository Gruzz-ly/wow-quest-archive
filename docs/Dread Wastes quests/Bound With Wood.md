==Objectives==
Obtain 8 pieces of Fragrant Corewood.
*[[Fragrant Corewood]] (8)

==Description==
<Vu eyes the recipe.>

Hmm... "bound with wood". We don't typically brew with wood. Sap, yes... but not wood.

We have, on rare occasions, infused our drinks with corewood from the [[treant]]s to the west of here. Most of them have fallen to the [[mantid]]... but their remains should suffice for our recipe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We don't brew with wood here. It gives the brew a harsh, insipid flavor, not unlike that of wine.

<Vu spits.>

==Completion==
I'll get these pieces prepared.

We've already gathered quite a few of these ingredients! I'll have to get a pot boiling soon.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Wood and Shade]] and [[Kor'thik Aggression]] before heading out.

Head southwest. Treant corpses litter the ground between the brewgarden and [[Kor'vess]]. Start killing any [[Kor'thik swarm]] mantid, including {{NPC||Kor'thik Battlesinger||battlesingers}}, {{NPC||Kor'thik Chitinel||chitinels}}, and {{NPC||Kor'thik Havoc||havocs}}. Don't kill all the mantid before finding the two objects inside the tree for Wood and Shade, however, as the entrances are guarded by more mantid. The Mark of the Empress is inside the east entrance, while the Heartroot is inside the north entrance. Merely getting close to the objects is enough for quest credit.
