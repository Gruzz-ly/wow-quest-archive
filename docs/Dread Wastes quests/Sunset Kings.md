==Objectives==
[[File:Rikkitun Village.jpg|thumb|[[Rikkitun Village]]]]
Meet [[Sapmaster Vu]] at [[Rikkitun Village]].

==Description==
[[Olon]] had a clever idea. He thinks that we should visit the [[sprite]]s to the west, and ask them if they have any of these ingredients. Some of the elements to this recipe are seeming... strange.

The Rikkitun sprites have a village to the west of [[Kor'vess]]. I hope to see you there, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It's been a while since I brewed on the road.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|yell|Sapmaster Vu|Come on, Olon! Brew-ty calls!}}
:{{text|yell|Olon|YEAH! BEEEEER!!}}
:''The two start running, but Lya intercepts them.''
:{{text|say|Lya of Ten Songs|Where are you two going?}}
:{{text|say|Sapmaster Vu|Nowhere.}}
:{{text|yell|Olon|Rikkitun Village!}}
:{{text|say|Lya of Ten Songs|Rikkitun... that's IT!}}
:{{text|say|Lya of Ten Songs|"Incantations fae and primal"... that must refer to the Rikkitun sprites.}}
:{{text|say|Lya of Ten Songs|I'm going too! See you there, <name>!}}
:''The three start running, disappearing off in the distance.''
Take off after them. Circle around to the west side of the tree to find [[Rikkitun Village]], full of friendly sprites!
