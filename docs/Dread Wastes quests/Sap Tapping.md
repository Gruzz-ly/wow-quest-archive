==Objectives==
[[File:Amber Tap.jpg|thumb|Amber Tap]]
Collect 6 Amber Sap.
*[[Amber Sap]] (6)

==Description==
I found a grove of young amber trees to the east, Wakener.

I've placed tapping devices on these trees, but I have been too busy to retrieve the sap.

I need someone to find the extractors. Activate them, then bring me samples of the amber.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
These trees are still young. They are not yet kypari.

Their sap is like water, while the sap of a true kypari tree is like wine.

They must be allowed to grow.

==Completion==
Ah yes, this is exactly what I needed.

I will examine these samples. We must continue to monitor the health of these young kypari.

==Notes==
Fly northeast to the [[Terrace of Gurthan]]. West of the ruins proper are a number of young kypari trees with [[Sapfly|Sapflies]] guarding amber collectors. Take out the sapflies, interact with the amber taps, let the amber collect in the amber pot, then loot the pot to collect [[Amber Sap]].
