==Objectives==
Speak with [[Bowmistress Li]] on the [[Serpent's Spine]].

==Description==
I am sure many of our associates will be requesting your services after your victory [[Winter's Blossom|here]]. But I have received a request for aid from our defenders at the wall along the [[Dread Wastes]]. If you would assist them, then take a kite and check in with Bowmistress Li.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|14}}
*23,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A volunteer for Dread Wastes duty? I think you might be the first.

Pleased to meet you.

==Notes==
Accepting this quest should teach the adventurer the [[Serpent's Spine]], [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]] flight path. Speak to Len and take a Kite to Li's location.
