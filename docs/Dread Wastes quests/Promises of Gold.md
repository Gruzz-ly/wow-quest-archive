==Objectives==
Report to [[Chief Rikkitun]] at [[Rikkitun Village]] in [[Dread Wastes]].

==Description==
As soon as the creature died, a strange group of [[sprite]]s appeared and took its pearl away.

The sprites have a village nearby, called Rikkitun Village. Perhaps you should investigate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Gokk'lok's Shell]] and {{cost|34|20}}
*353000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The shinyseed... it was your doing? I already had one shinyseed... but two is better.

We need only the seed, not the casing. If you like, you can keep.
