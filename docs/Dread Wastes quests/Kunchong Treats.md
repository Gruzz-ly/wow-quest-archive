==Objectives==
Collect 4 Meaty Turtle Haunches.
*[[Meaty Turtle Haunch]] (4)

==Description==
As Kovok grows, he will require equal parts discipline and reward.

I lack no shortage of discipline, but our supply of meat is almost empty.

To the south, you will find turtles roaming north of the [[Lake of Stars]] and [[Kypari Zar]].

Hunt them. Kovok likes the taste of their flesh.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
What have you brought for Kovok?

==Completion==
Yes, a worthy feast.

Well done.

==Notes==
Fly to the southwest corner of the zone. The [[Chillwater Turtle]]s are ''north'' of the [[Lake of Stars]], sharing spawn areas with the [[Horrorscale Scorpid]]s for [[The Fight Against Fear]]. Get the quota of turtle haunches, then focus on the other daily quests in the area before heading back to Klaxxi'vess.
