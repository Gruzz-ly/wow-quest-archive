==Objectives==
Collect 200 Thresher Teeth by pulling them from the jaws of [[Longfin Thresher]]s on the [[Shelf of Mazu]].
*[[Thresher Teeth]] (200)

==Description==
Crabbing is our big money-maker, but we send all kinds of goods back around [[Serpent's Spine|the wall]]. Oils, plants, even rare minerals - the sea's bounty is rich out here!

Right now the big craze in the markets back home is [[thresher]] teeth. Apparently they make great necklaces?

Threshers are all over the Shelf of Mazu to the west. Bring me lots of teeth!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Anglers]]

==Progress==
Having actually seen someone eaten by a thresher, I'm not sure why you'd willingly string their teeth around your neck, but whatever.

==Completion==
Those are perfect, just put them down over there. I'd rather not touch them myself. Creeps me out.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Walking Dog]], [[Old Age and Treachery]], and [[On the Crab]] before heading out.

Out in the open water, summon [[Dog (Dread Wastes)|Dog]] using [[Dog's Whistle]]. Dog immediately turns around and offers [[Dog Food]], so accept it.

The Silt Vents are on the northeast end of the Shelf of Mazu, almost due west from [[Soggy's Gamble]].
:{{text|emote|Dog swims excitedly through the vents of warm water.}}
The [[Wreck of the Mist-Hopper]] is just southwest of the silt vents.
:{{text|emote|Dog rubs against the prow of the Mist-Hopper and whimpers.}}
On deck, forward, is Soggy's Footlocker. Loot the [[Sealed Charter Tube]] out of it.

Finally, southwest, just offshore of [[Zan'vess]], is the whale corpse.
:{{text|emote|Dog looks around cautiously before leaving his mark on the whale corpse.}}
Crab pots are all over the seafloor, and merely interacting with them is enough to get them up to the surface. Kill [[Longfin Thresher]]s, loot their [[Thresher Jaw]]s, and extract [[Thresher Teeth]] from them, 22-30 at a time. Carefully. Last but not least, kill [[Rockshell Snapclaw]]s so Dog can eat them.
