==Objectives==
Bring the Massive Kyparite Core to [[Ambersmith Zikk]] at [[Klaxxi'vess]].
*[[Massive Kyparite Core]] (provided)

==Description==
<As the ringworm tumbles apart, a massive chunk of organic kyparite falls from its core. Someone at Klaxxi'vess will want to see this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|22|80|lcgf=2}}
* 294000 [[XP]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Completion==
Interesting. You were wise to spot the importance of this, Wakener. Organic kyparite is highly valuable to us.

Here, a reward. In fair trade.

==Notes==
While heading to or returning from [[Zan'vess]] for the [[Klaxxi]] daily quests, note [[Kypa'rak]], a massive kyparite worm on the west side of the [[Briny Muck]]. Kill it and it drops the [[Massive Kyparite Core]], which starts this quest.

Kypa'rak is a level 90 elite [[kyparite worm]] with 2,363,000 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Burrow|Burrow into the ground, reducing damage taken by 75% and becoming immune to stuns.|notes=Instant. Hits for ~26,000 Physical if it's in range. While burrowed, casts:}}
**{{abilities|Raise Earth|While burrowed, causes the nearby ground to rumble, creating impaling chunks of rock that inflict 95,000 Physical damage and knock back all nearby enemies.|notes=1.5 sec cast. 12 sec channel. Ticks...}}
***{{abilities|Raise Earth|Inflicts Physical damage and knocks the target into the air.|notes=Instant. Hits for 75,000 Physical on cloth.}}
**{{abilities|Groundbreaker|Burst through the ground, knocking up and inflicting Physical damage to all nearby enemies.|notes=1 sec cast. Hits for 65,000 Physical on cloth.}}
**{{abilities|Cracking Stone|Breaking through the ground is tough, causing damage taken to be increased by 25%. This effect stacks.|notes=Instant. Debuff cast on itself after each Groundbreaker. Stacks.}}

Before getting Kypa'rak's attention, clear the area of [[Muck Sifter]]s and [[Brineshell Snapper]]s. While units are in melee range, Kypa'rak is not very likely to Burrow, but for ranged attackers, Kypa'rak will burrow shortly after resurfacing. It still takes damage while underground, but the Raise Earth spikes are always targeted at the adventurer's feet, so the underground phase is all about doing damage on the move.

Stay well clear of the dust cloud noting Kypa'rak's position while underground when the Raise Earth channel ends, as the Groundbreaker cast hits everyone standing within it. Take advantage of the Cracking Stone damage taken boost, as it will stack as far as it needs to in order for Kypa'rak to get killed.
