==Objectives==
Meet [[Chen Stormstout]] at [[Sunset Brewgarden|The Sunset Brewgarden]], then listen to his eulogy.
*Meet up with Chen {{co|50.2|10.2|Dread Wastes}}
*Eulogize [[Evie Stormstout|Evie]]

==Description==
I was too late. She was so small... and I was too late.

She should be given a proper burial. A little warrior like her deserves better than this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|70}}
*118000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Chen is in mourning.>

==Completion==
<Chen is, for the moment, silent.>

==Notes==
After [[Fate of the Stormstouts]], Chen leaves the brewgarden and comes across Evie due south of the tree on the [[Horrid March]]. Catch up with them there.

On accept, Chen picks her up and starts walking, slowly, back to the Brewgarden, disappearing along the way. Head back that direction. Chen is north of the Brewgarden itself overlooking the cliff above the [[Ambermarsh]]. Get close to Chen:
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|They say your name was Evie.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|They say you were a sweet girl.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|I never knew you... but you were family.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|May your journey in the next world be filled with joy and beauty.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Farewell, Evie Stormstout.}}

Turn in and pick up the followup from him.
