==Objectives==
Kill 8 Coldbite Crocolisks.
*[[Coldbite Crocolisk]] slain (8)

==Description==
I must join the [[Klaxxi]] Council and the other paragons immediately, but I am barely strong enough to stand.

I must feed, Wakener.

I sense the beating hearts of creatures on the northern bank of the lake.

Kill them for me, and I shall do the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
I have been sleeping for many thousands of years. I must regain my strength before rejoining the Council.

==Completion==
I feel the strength returning to my body.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Living Amber (quest)]] before heading out.

Exit the cave and head north into the lake, then start killing crocolisks. Look for the small amber chunks on the lakebed, not the big ones.
