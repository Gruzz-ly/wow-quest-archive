Assist [[Master Angler Ju Lien]] in [[Soggy's Gamble]].
*Speak with Master Angler Ju Lien {{co|53.6|76.0|Dread Wastes}}
*Assist Master Angler Ju Lien

==Description==
I never thought I'd see the day, but for the first time since... well, EVER, Master Angler Ju Lien asked for some help with his lines.

Apparently the sea is going crazy today and he can't keep up. See if you can give him a hand. He's fishing just south of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Anglers]]

==Progress==
Go give Ju Lien a hand, would ya?

==Completion==
What happened out there? I heard a scream and next thing I know these nasty things come rolling in on the next wave!

==Notes==
Run down the shoreline to the southern tip of Soggy's Gamble. Speak with Ju Lien, holding four fishing poles at once!
:What will the sea bring us today?
:{{gossip|Deck Boss said you needed some help.}}
:{{text|say|Master Angler Ju Lien|Pick any of these fabulous rods and CAREFULLY tug the line. That should help set the hook into whatever's flailin' around at the other end.}}

Four rods are available on the racks beside Ju Lien: the [[Improvised Rod]], [[Classic Rod]], [[Bamboo Rod]], and [[Serpent Rod]]. Tug on one. A [[Jiao Spawn]] will appear in the water and jump up on the cliff to attack you. Kill it.
:{{text|say|Master Angler Ju Lien|Well that's unusual... Take care of it, then tug another line when you can.}}

After a rod has been interacted with, it becomes unusable. Interact with another to cause another Jiao Spawn to appear.
:{{text|say|Master Angler Ju Lien|Grrr... whatever I've got here is big. Keep up the good work on those lines while I land this baby!}}

Spawn a third:
:{{text|say|Master Angler Ju Lien|What... in... [[Mazu]]'s... name... HRRGHHH!!}}

Pull on the last remaining line and the phase will change.
:''A gigantic [[Jiao Tentacle]] appears out of the water just in front of Ju Lien.''
:{{text|say|Master Angler Ju Lien|What the...}}
:''[[Jiao]] appears out in the distance.''
:{{text|yell|Master Angler Ju Lien|LEVIATHAN!!}}
:{{text|say|Master Angler Ju Lien|We gotta warn the others!}}
:''Just as Ju Lien turns around to start running, the tentacle snags him into the water!''
:{{text|yell|Master Angler Ju Lien|Aaaagghhhh!!}}

Head back to Arie to turn in. All of the [[Deckhand (Dread Wastes)|Deckhands]] have disappeared and Jiao Spawn are swarming! [[Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao]] is now standing next to Arie and offers the next quest.
