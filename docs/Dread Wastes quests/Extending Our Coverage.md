==Objectives==
Activate the Resonating Beacon in [[Amberglow Hollow]].
*Amberglow Hollow located {{co|46.4|52.9|Dread Wastes}}
*[[Adjunct Zet'uk]] slain {{co|48.1|49.7|Dread Wastes}}
*Use the Resonating Crystal on the Silent Beacon {{co|48.2|49.7|Dread Wastes}}
*[[Resonating Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
The Klaxxi'va hear another paragon. His cries are weak and lost in darkness. The signal must be strengthened.

There is a beacon in Amberglow Hollow that has been silent for many years. It must sing; the Klaxxi demand it!

This time I will go with you. You will help me repair it.

Take the resonating crystal and meet me in Amberglow.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|14}}
* 236000 XP
* +250 reputation with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Why are you still standing here?

==Completion==
It is good you showed up when you did.

Perhaps you are not as useless as I thought...

The Klaxxi'va sing to the paragon now. Soon they will know where to send you. For now there are other tasks.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Amber Is Life]] before heading out. Extending Our Coverage takes place to the southwest between Kypari Ik and the Briny Muck, while Amber Is Life takes place to the southeast by [[Kypari Ik]] and the [[Lake of Stars]], so pick one set to do first.

Head south out of [[Klaxxi'vess]] across the scar and down to sea level. Loop for the entrance to [[Amberglow Hollow]] southeast of the gear marked on the map. Inside, Kor'ik is standing next to the Silent Beacon alongside Adjunct Zet'uk:
:{{text|yell|Adjunct Zet'uk|Give me the resonating crystal you puny little bark eater!}}

Zet'uk is a level 90 mantid with 787,000 health and the following ability:
*{{abilities|Sha Eruption|Releases an eruption of Sha energy towards a random enemy. The Sha energy inflicts 9,500 to 10,500 Fire damage to all enemies within 3 yards.

Aggro him:
:{{text|say|Adjunct Zet'uk|I should have known you would not come alone Kor'ik.}}

Finish him off:
:{{text|say|Adjunct Zet'uk|This is not over...}}

Quickly use the resonating crystal on the silent beacon, then talk to Kor'ik.
