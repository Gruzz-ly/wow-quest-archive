==Objectives==
Collect 6 Zan'thik Shackles from [[Thought-Bound Miner]]s and [[Thought-Bound Brute]]s in [[Zan'vess]].
*[[Zan'thik Shackles]] (6)

==Description==
The Zan'thik employ a sizable force of... indentured labor.

[[Yaungol]] are bound in special shackles which enhance and prolong the effects of sonic manipulation. It is this technology that allows the Zan'thik manipulators to command such large quantities of thralls to endlessly toil for them in the quarries.

I would like to study these shackles.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Surely this is something you can handle, is it not?

==Completion==
Ingenious devices, really. I have a feeling they will prove useful.

==Notes==
Head southwest off the mainland to [[Zan'vess]]. Get started killing mantid. And the named, [[Vess-Guard Vik'az]], who patrols the housing complex center of the island just south of the kypari tree itself. And the [[kypari worm]]s, looking for [[Kyparite Shards]]. And looting the Dreadspore Bulbs on the ground, mindful of the [[Haunt of Fear|Haunts of Fear]] that may come out or any of the other random debuffs... And killing the [[Thought-Bound Miner]]s for their [[Zan'thik Shackles]]. And testing out [[Korven's Experimental Grenades]] on the [[Zan'thik Amberhusk]]s on the western side of the island.

Finally, don't forget to kill [[Kypa'rak]] and loot the [[Massive Kyparite Core]] from its corpse, which starts [[Kypa'rak's Core]], the "hidden" daily of Zan'vess.
