[[File:VZ-Dread Wastes.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

The '''[[Dread Wastes]] storyline''' takes place after the [[Townlong Steppes storyline]] during the [[Mists of Pandaria campaign]]. Adventurers are directed to the {{NPC||Bowmistress Li}} upon the [[Serpent's Spine]], just south of the [[Gate of the Setting Sun]] to begin the storyline. After locating a member of the [[Shado-Pan]] who has fallen from the wall, adventurers are quickly introduced to the [[Klaxxi]] faction of [[mantid]], who find themselves in direct opposition to {{NPC||Shek'zeer}} and her sha-based corruption of the swarm.

After completing "The First Paragons" portion of [[Dread Haste Makes Dread Waste]], side quests open up at the [[Sunset Brewgarden]] and [[Soggy's Gamble]], but breadcrumbs to those quest hubs are not offered until later in the Klaxxi storyline.

==The First Paragons==
The zone storyline opens up with breadcrumbs from everywhere leading to the southern side of the [[Gate of the Setting Sun]] in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
