==Objectives==
Kill 15 Horrorscale Scorpid.
*[[Horrorscale Scorpid]] slain (15)

==Description==
When we discovered the sha influence at [[Kypari Zar]], I had hoped the corruption could still be cleansed.

Unfortunately, the Klaxxi Council has confirmed that the [[Sha of Fear|sha of fear]]'s corruption is deep-seated, and continues to spread.

To the south, I have observed some of the local wildlife consumed by an unnamed terror.

The sha can warp and twist its victims into unimaginable horrors.

We must stop the corruption before it becomes worse. Seek out the sha-infected Horrorscale Scorpids. Eliminate them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
The sha will continue to spread like a disease... unless we can stop it.

==Completion==
You have purged the hills of the infected creatures? Good.

The sha is a merciless enemy. Thus must we be merciless in return.

==Notes==
Fly to the southwest corner of the zone. The Horrorscale scorpids are ''north'' of the [[Lake of Stars]], sharing spawn areas with the [[Chillwater Turtle]]s for [[Kunchong Treats]]. Kill the quota of scorpid, then focus on the other daily quests in the area before heading back to Klaxxi'vess.
