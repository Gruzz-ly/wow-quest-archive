==Objectives==
Use the Shado-Pan Dragon Gun to destroy 20 Dreadspinner Eggs in the [[Terrace of Gurthan]].
*[[Dreadspinner Egg]] slain (20)
*[[Shado-Pan Dragon Gun (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
I recovered this weapon on a recent scouting run near [[Serpent's Spine|the wall]]. It would seem ideal for helping your [[Shado-Pan]] with their infestation problem in Gurthani Terrace.

The more they are focused on keeping spiders off the wall, the less time they are killing fear-gripped swarmborn.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
I don't have to explain how to use it, do I?

You point the scary end at something that isn't burning and you FIX THE PROBLEM.

==Completion==
A crude weapon, but it has its uses.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Dreadspinner Extermination]] before heading out.
