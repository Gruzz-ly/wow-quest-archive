* Report to Malik the Unscathed {{co|40.4|34.6|Dread Wastes}}

== Description ==
[[Grand Empress Shek'zeer]] has finally lost her patience with us. We have learned of an enormous army, massing in the shadows of the Heart of Fear, with orders to crush [[Klaxxi'vess]].

We have been fortunate to hold out this long, but we cannot survive a siege of this scale.

Wakener, you have been invaluable to our efforts. Come, take your place on the field among we paragons.

I will see you on the battlefield!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|19|84|50}}

== Progress ==
Klaxxi'vess must not fall.

== Completion ==
Malik the Unscathed has fallen in battle. Nine paragons remain. They must be somewhere out on this battlefield.

== Notes ==
This quest opens up upon reaching {{rep|Exalted}} with the [[Klaxxi]].
