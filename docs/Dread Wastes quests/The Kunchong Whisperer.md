==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Oracle Hiss'ir.jpg|Oracle Hiss'ir|High oracle of the Muckscale tribe.}}
Kill Oracle Hiss'ir and 10 [[Muckscale tribe]] members.
*[[Oracle Hiss'ir]] slain {{co|42.0|63.6|Dread Wastes}}
*Muckscale Tribe slain (10)

==Description==
To really connect with [[Kovok]] you need to challenge him mentally and physically. You must respect his strength and intelligence; only then will he allow you to really train him.

The muckscale tribe may provide an adequate test of his abilities and with you there he shouldn't be in danger.

Additionally, this will allow us to decrease their numbers in the [[Briny Muck]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
How has Kovok done against more challenging opponents?

==Completion==
I am most impressed with your progress, Wakener. Kovok's training is coming along nicely and he seems to be fond of you.

I have no doubt that you are the best choice to assist me in training him.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Feed or Be Eaten]] before heading out. After accepting both:
:{{text|say|Kaz'tik the Manipulator|I will return to Klaxxi'vess to meet with the council. Please take good care of Kovok.}}
Head northwest and start killing [[Brineshell Snapper]]s and members of the [[Muckscale tribe]]: [[Muckscale Flesh-Hunter|flesh-hunters]], [[Muckscale Ripper|rippers]], [[Muckscale Shaman|shaman]] and [[Muckscale Slayer|slayers]]. [[Oracle Hiss'ir]] is on the main Muckscale island in the center of the murk. Kill him, then loot the Glowing Amber he was guarding to start [[Falling to Pieces]]. Head back up to [[Klaxxi'vess]] to turn in, or do [[Amber Is Life]] if not already done.
