==Objectives==
Speak with [[Bowmistress Li]] on the [[Serpent's Spine]].

==Description==
With the [[Sha of Hatred]] dead, the greatest threat to this land is vanquished, but our travels along the southern border have made it exceedingly clear that the [[mantid]] forces in the [[Dread Wastes]] are on the move, and likely won't be held back for long.

If you wish to continue to aid the [[Shado-Pan]], I would recommend reporting in to Bowmistress Li on the Serpent's Spine. She oversees the great wall that separates the terrors in the Dread Wastes from our [[Valley of the Four Winds|bountiful lands to the east]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|14}}
*23,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A volunteer for Dread Wastes duty? I think you might be the first.

Pleased to meet you.

==Notes==
Take the flight path to the [[Serpent's Spine]], south of the [[Gate of the Setting Sun]].

==Progression==
{{Finding the Klaxxi}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
