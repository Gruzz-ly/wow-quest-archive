==Objectives==
[[File:Muckscale Serpentus.jpg|thumb|Muckscale Serpentus]]
Kill 12 Muckscale Flesheaters and the Muckscale Serpentus.
*[[Muckscale Flesheater]] slain (12)
*[[Muckscale Serpentus]] slain

==Description==
I'm afraid that I wet my hands with saurok blood while you were away.

I'm sorry, but I could not help myself. Now, watch them attack me.

Pitiful!

Do they think to take vengeance for their fallen? Do they come challenge ME?

I, who have won a hundred wars? I, who stood alone against thousands and still shouted for my enemies to come?

No, these... saurok... will crumple before me like paper before the flame!

I shall show you my might, Wakener. Fight alongside me and see.

Here they come!

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Completion==
You have succeeded once again. Well done, Wakener.

==Notes==
Even before accepting, several [[Muckscale Flesheater]]s are streaming into the grotto and are being killed quickly by Skeer. After accepting, they will keep streaming in, but one or two of each wave will be aggroed upon the adventurer and not on Skeer. Skeer won't help kill saurok who aren't focused on him. However, make sure to tap each mob that enters the area to get credit for them.

Once twelve are dead, the [[Muckscale Serpentus]] will spawn, again aggroed upon the player. Finish it off, then head back to Klaxxi'vess to turn in, or head down to [[Zan'vess]] for [[The Zan'thik Dig]] if not already done.
Shortly after accept:
:{{text|say|Skeer the Bloodseeker|Ah yes... Wakener, doesn't the scent of blood fill you with new strength?}}
Later:
:{{text|say|Skeer the Bloodseeker|Weaklings! Fools! You cannot stand before the Bloodseeker!}}
Around the 10th kill:
:{{text|say|Skeer the Bloodseeker|Just a bit longer, Wakener! They are on their last legs!}}
Serpentus spawn:
:{{text|yell|Muckscale Serpentus|Swarmborn! Filthy muckeaters! You defile our grotto. You will not escape!}}
Success:
:{{text|say|Skeer the Bloodseeker|Well done, Wakener. I will stay a while longer to quench my blade's thirst. You may tell the others of my return, but I believe my swift wings will bear me to Klaxxi'vess before you.}}

This completes the "Skeer the Bloodseeker" portion of [[Amber is the Color of My Energy]].
