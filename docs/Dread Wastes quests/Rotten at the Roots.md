==Objectives==
Stop the source of the corruption within the [[Morrowchamber]].
* [[Shal'xik the Nameless]] slain
* [[Binder Zz'jalix]] slain
* [[Ri'lij the Dreamer]] slain
* [[Caller Vzj'ax]] slain

==Description==
Underneath [[Kypari Kor]] is a large chamber where the [[mantid]] tend to the [[Kypari tree|tree]]. That must be where the source of the corruption lies.

We need to get into that chamber and stop them. [[N'Zoth]] must not be allowed to empower the swarm.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The mantid [[Shadow of the Empire|swore to stand]] by the [[Old God]]s upon their return. It seems that time has come.

==Completion==
[[N'raqi|Faceless ones]]? The kypari trees are sacred to the mantid... but I suppose their devotion to the Old Gods is greater.

==Notes==
In each of the side chambers is one of your targets.
