*Use Ruining Fork on Iyokkuk the Lucid {{co|32.4|33.7|Dread Wastes}}
*Protect Iyyokuk the Lucid until he escapes {{co|32.8|33.9|Dread Wastes}}
*[[Ruining Fork]] (provided)

==Description==
We've found the blades, bound them together with wood and shade, and blessed them with an ancient incantation. If I'm not mistaken, it's time to use this thing.

The sprites spoke of an ancient piece of sap within the [[Amber Hibernal]], a mantid cave near their [[Heart of Fear|empress' palace]]. That must be the "Blood of Ancients" that the prophecy spoke of.

Whatever's inside that sap must be important. Good luck, <name>.

You will also receive:

* 236000 XP

==Progress==
Make sure to bring that forked blade with you.

==Completion==
There was a... a [[mantid]] inside that amber? I never would have thought that the solution to our war on the mantid would be... another mantid.

There are still many things that I have left to learn, but I do know this: that CERTAINLY wasn't a beer recipe.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Blood of Ancients]] before heading out.

Run southwest through [[Rikkilea]] to the ''north side'' of the [[Heart of Fear]]. On the northwest side of the tree is a chunk of Solidifed Amber in front of an Enormous Landslide blocking a cave. Loot the amber, then interact with the landslide, summoning three [[Rikkitun Chanter]]s that cast the Incantation of the Rikkitun to clear it, much like how they lifted the [[Motherseed]]s in [[Great Vessel of Salvation]]. This is the [[Amber Hibernal]].

Run down the steps inside. Inside is the [[Klaxxi]] paragon [[Iyyokuk the Lucid]] inside a huge chunk of crystallized amber and... [[Mama Stormstout]]? Use the fork near Mama Stormstout to free her. Suddenly...
:{{text|yell|Adjunct Okzyk|There! The Klaxxi! Hold that crystal together... don't let it escape!}}

[[Adjunct Okzyk]], an imperial chitinel, [[Adjunct G'kkal]], an imperial blade-dancer, and [[Adjunct Pivvika]], an imperial pain-rouser, spawn and are focused on Iyyokuk. They can each be pulled individually, so take advantage of that.

Aggro each one:
:{{text|say|Mama Stormstout|THE HATCHING HOUR IS NIGH... I MUST ANSWER TO THE SWARM...}}
:{{text|say|Mama Stormstout|NO... YOU WILL NOT KEEP ME INSIDE THIS ABHORRENT PRISON...}}
:{{text|say|Mama Stormstout|SET ME FREE... THE KLAXXI CALL...}}

On the death of the third:
:{{text|say|Iyyokuk the Lucid|Freedom...}}
:{{text|say|Iyyokuk the Lucid|For eight hundred and seventy-seven years, I waited in that crystal... watching shadows pass through the cracks, counting decades.}}
:{{text|say|Iyyokuk the Lucid|Now, I am needed elsewhere.}}
:''The [[paragon]] flies off as Chen Stormstout runs in.''
:{{text|say|Mama Stormstout|I... wah... where? What is going on?}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|You were being mind-controlled by some sort of malevolent ancient insect creature.}}
:{{text|say|Mama Stormstout|Oh that. Bah, I've been through worse. And who exactly are you?}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|I am Chen Stormstout. From the [[Wandering Isle]].}}
:{{text|say|Mama Stormstout|STORMSTOUT? No. You're foolin'. Really? A Wandering Isle Stormstout, here, on Pandaria! Where's the rest of the family?}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|I'll explain on the way back to the Sapmasters.}}

Head back to the [[Sunset Brewgarden]] to turn in.

This quest resolves Mama Stormstout's fate, following up after [[Han Stormstout (quest)]]. The Stormstout family saga at the Brewgarden gets one last installment after turning in [[Blood of Ancients]].

This quest completes the "[[Iyyokuk the Lucid]]" portion of [[Amber is the Color of My Energy]].
