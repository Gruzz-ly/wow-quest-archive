==Objectives==
[[File:Mistblade Ripper.jpg|thumb|[[Mistblade Ripper]].]]
[[File:Mantid Relic.jpg|thumb|[[Mantid Relic]].]]
Collect 8 Mantid Relics.
*[[Mantid Relic]] (8)

==Description==
This strange-looking carving is covered in a complex written language that might be [[mantid]] in origin.

You notice more relics strewn carelessly among the camps and inside the lake.

Perhaps the Klaxxi would be interested in examining these artifacts.

Who knows? Perhaps it will earn you some favor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
What do you have there?

==Completion==
These relics describe the history of Kypari Vos and the nearby amber trees.

I would like to study these.

Thank you, <class>.

==Notes==
Killing [[Mistblade Ripper]]s for [[Amber Is Life]], one of them will drop the [[Strange Relic]], starting this quest. Keep killing rippers and looting the relics off of the ground.

The [[Mistblade Scale-Lord]] is in a small cave with its mouth just southeast of the lake. Kill him, then turn in [[Amber Is Life]] to free [[Korven the Prime]].
