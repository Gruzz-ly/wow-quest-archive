==Objectives==
[[File:Kypari Zar crocolisk den.jpg|thumb|Kypari Zar crocolisk den]]
[[File:Coldbite Matriarch.jpg|thumb|[[Coldbite Matriarch]].]]
Kill the Coldbite Matriarch.
*[[Coldbite Matriarch]] slain {{co|57.3|57.8|Dread Wastes}}

==Description==
[[Kypari Zar]] is dying.

A creature of terrible darkness corrupts it from deep beneath its roots.

The tree cannot be saved, but at least we can lessen its pain.

Look. The vile creature has carved a path to its own lair. We need only follow it down the hill, just behind this tower.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 429 trinkets|Relic of Kypari Zar|Sigil of Kypari Zar|Emblem of Kypari Zar|Insignia of Kypari Zar|Badge of Kypari Zar}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
The swarm knows not of their terrible folly! These precious trees must be protected at all costs!

==Completion==
Thank you, Wakener. Kypari Zar can now dream in peace.

However, the beast was merely a vessel for the corruption.

No... the true corruption lies much deeper.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Korven the Prime|Despite your obvious weaknesses, I have grown fond of you, Wakener. I was made a paragon because of my prowess on the battlefield. It was said that I could cheat death itself. I shall lend you this very ability, Painkiller, to protect you during this task ahead.}}
Adventurers are buffed with Painkiller: "Carrying the mark of Korven the Prime, which grants the ability, Painkiller. Upon taking a blow that would have killed you, instead you are encased in a block of amber, which reduces damage taken and regenerates health and mana for the duration fo the spell. This effect cannot occur more than once every 3 min. Only effective at Kypari Zar."

Run downhill to the northwest beneath the tree, to find the den of the [[Coldbite Matriarch]], a sha-infested crocolisk with 1,181,000 health. Don't step on the eggs! They have a nasty habit of revealing [[Coldbite Spawn]], weak level 89 crocolisks with 39,000 health. Kite her to the surface and then kill her to save some pain and suffering.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Korven the Prime|I feel strong enough to continue on my own, <name>. I must report this... [[sha]] presence to the Council immediately. If we meet again, it shall be at [[Klaxxi'vess]].}}
This concludes the [[Korven the Prime]] portion of the [[Dread Wastes storyline]]. If not already done, wrap up the [[Kaz'tik the Manipulator]] portion of the storyline, which started with [[Extending Our Coverage]].

This quest, alongside [[Feed or Be Eaten]] and [[The Kunchong Whisperer]] are the criteria for "The Might of the Klaxxi" potion of [[Dread Haste Makes Dread Waste]].
