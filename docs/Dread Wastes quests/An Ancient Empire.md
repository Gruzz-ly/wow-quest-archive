Collect 8 Gurthani Tablets.

==Description==
My brothers speak of an ancient mogu empire that once dwelled in the [[Terrace of Gurthan|ruins to the east]].

Once, this tribe knew untold secrets of sorcery and subjugation.

I have a curious mind, Wakener, and I wish to learn of the empires that ruled after my time.

Knowledge of the past will determine our future.

Go search the ruins for their ancient tablets. I will study their secrets and make them our own.

Good, Wakener. It will take me time to decipher these tablets, but all knowledge is worthy.
