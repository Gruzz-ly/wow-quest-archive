==Objectives==
Attach a Mist-Hopper Buoy to 8 [[Full Crab Pot]]s on the [[Shelf of Mazu]].
*Full Crab Pots Sent to Surface x8
*[[Mist-Hopper Emergency Buoy]] (provided)

==Description==
I just got word that a string of pots we dropped this morning hit it BIG. We're on the crab!

Problem is, the rips are getting stronger and we lost track of some of the pots. They're just sitting out there, filled with spiky blue GOLD!

I need you back out there. Hook one of these buoys up to any of the full traps you find and send it to the surface for us.

==Progress==
You smell that, green?

<Arie takes a big, dramatic whiff of rank, fishy air.>

Smells like money!

==Completion==
Nice work out there!

==Notes==
[[File:Full Crab Pot buoyed.jpg|thumb|upright|A crab pot being buoyed.]]
Pick up [[Walking Dog]], [[Old Age and Treachery]], and [[Shark Week]] before heading out.

Out in the open water, summon [[Dog (Dread Wastes)|Dog]] using [[Dog's Whistle]]. Dog immediately turns around and offers [[Dog Food]], so accept it.

The Silt Vents are on the northeast end of the Shelf of Mazu, almost due west from [[Soggy's Gamble]].
:{{text|emote|Dog swims excitedly through the vents of warm water.}}
The [[Wreck of the Mist-Hopper]] is just southwest of the silt vents.
:{{text|emote|Dog rubs against the prow of the Mist-Hopper and whimpers.}}
On deck, forward, is Soggy's Footlocker. Loot the [[Sealed Charter Tube]] out of it.

Finally, southwest, just offshore of [[Zan'vess]], is the whale corpse.
:{{text|emote|Dog looks around cautiously before leaving his mark on the whale corpse.}}
Crab pots are all over the seafloor, and merely interacting with them is enough to get them up to the surface. Kill [[Longfin Thresher]]s, loot their [[Thresher Jaw]]s, and extract [[Thresher Teeth]] from them, 22-30 at a time. Carefully. Last but not least, kill [[Rockshell Snapclaw]]s so Dog can eat them.
