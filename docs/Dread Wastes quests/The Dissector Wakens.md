==Completion==
Look at you! Many parts and pieces... yes... and all of them so good at killing. Fascinating.

I must pick your brain some time. Muhahah.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|bossemote|Hold off the Zan'thik wile Rik'kal the Dissector gathers his strength!}}
A [[Zan'thik Impaler]], followed by a [[Zan'thik Manipulator]], then one more [[Zan'thik Impaler]] will spawn. They are all at full health, so fight smart.

After 45 seconds:
:{{text|say|Rik'kal the Dissector|My strength returns. Speak to me, Wakener, before I report to the Klaxxi.}}

This completes the "Rik'kal the Dissector" portion of [[Amber is the Color of My Energy]].
