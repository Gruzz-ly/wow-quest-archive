==Objectives==
Bring 100 Sapfly Bits to [[Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver]] in the [[Terrace of Gurthan]].
*[[Sapfly Bits]] (100)

==Description==
You will forgive my current state. I have slept for many years.

A Klaxxi'va should have been here to attend my Wakening with kypari sap... but you will have to do.

I sense the buzzing of sapflies to the south. They gorge on the nourishing sap I need. Bring them to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Without nourishment, I will die where I stand.

==Completion==
This will do.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Ancient Vengeance]] before heading out.

Sapflies are critter-sized wasps to the south. Go killing.

==Progression==
{{Finding the Klaxxi}}

==Patch changes==
