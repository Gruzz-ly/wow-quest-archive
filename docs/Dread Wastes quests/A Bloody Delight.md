==Objectives==
Collect 100 Volatile Blood from [[Dread Remora]]s.
*[[Volatile Blood]] (100)

==Description==
A warrior is not ready for battle until he tastes the blood of his enemies.

I am still too weak to hunt, so you must go in my stead.

Only the blood from the fiercest predators will do. I can smell their presence in the waters outside this cave!

Bring this to me, and then perhaps you shall see why they call me the Bloodseeker.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
By drinking the blood of your enemies, you acquire their strength.

==Completion==
Yes, this will do.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Strange Appetite]] and [[Fine Dining]] before heading out.

Exit the cave back into the [[Muckscale Shallows]]. While in the area, Skeer provides the Mark of Skeer, granting water breathing at 125% swim speed. Start killing [[makura]] and [[remora]], and gathering starfish from the seabed and rocks underwater. The makura are neutral, and so are [[Bitterwater Crab]]s, so make sure the right mobs are getting killed. Tails drop from roughly every other clacker, and remora drop 6-15 units of blood each, averaging around 8. Gather everything up, then head back.
