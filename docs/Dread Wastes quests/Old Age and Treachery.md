==Objectives==
Recover the charter from the Wreck of the Mist-Hopper.
*[[Sealed Charter Tube]] {{co|44.7|78.7|Dread Wastes}}

==Description==
Look, I ain't got reason to trust you, but there's a task I can't give to my crew.

I need you to search the wreck of our old ship, the Mist-Hopper, and bring back the charter. It'd be sealed up in a silver tube, in a footlocker below deck.

It's sort of, uh... incriminating. I can't risk any of the crew finding it if they decide to visit the ol' girl. She's resting on the Shelf of Mazu, to the west.

I'd suggest riding a rip current out there, if you got the stomach. They're all over the shelf.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Anglers]]

==Progress==
To be honest, I hope a grouper ate the old charter.

Wait, then it might end up here anyway. Dang it!

==Completion==
That's the charter tube, alright. I guess you'd like to know what all the fuss is about, eh?

<Soggy lets out a long sigh as he un-caps the tube.>

Might as well get it over with.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Walking Dog]], [[On the Crab]], and [[Shark Week]] before heading out.

Out in the open water, summon [[Dog (Dread Wastes)|Dog]] using [[Dog's Whistle]]. Dog immediately turns around and offers [[Dog Food]], so accept it.

The Silt Vents are on the northeast end of the Shelf of Mazu, almost due west from [[Soggy's Gamble]].
:{{text|emote|Dog swims excitedly through the vents of warm water.}}
The [[Wreck of the Mist-Hopper]] is just southwest of the silt vents.
:{{text|emote|Dog rubs against the prow of the Mist-Hopper and whimpers.}}
On deck, forward, is [[Soggy's Footlocker]]. Loot the [[Sealed Charter Tube]] out of it.

Finally, southwest, just offshore of [[Zan'vess]], is the whale corpse.
:{{text|emote|Dog looks around cautiously before leaving his mark on the whale corpse.}}
Crab pots are all over the seafloor, and merely interacting with them is enough to get them up to the surface. Kill [[Longfin Thresher]]s, loot their [[Thresher Jaw]]s, and extract [[Thresher Teeth]] from them, 22-30 at a time. Carefully. Last but not least, kill [[Rockshell Snapclaw]]s so Dog can eat them.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|What the...?! This ain't the charter! It's a letter. In Arie's handwriting?}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|"Dear Soggy, if you are reading this it means you finally worked up the guts to send someone after the old charter. Well, you're too late."}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|"We know the Mist-Hopper wasn't hired to venture this far beyond the wall. We know it was supposed to be a routine job off the coast of Jade Forest."}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|"What should have been a week of easy fishing turned into a wild misadventure that ran us aground in the most dangerous place on the continent and nearly got us all killed, because you couldn't stop chasing your hunches."}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|We just wanted to say: Thank you."}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|"Thank you for chasing fortune on the distant horizon. Thank you for dreaming. And most of all, thank you for bringing us along."}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|"We'll always be your crew, Soggy. Ship or no ship. We'd follow you anywhere."}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|"Sincerely, all of us. Even Dog."}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|Wow...}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|Would you excuse me for a moment, <name>? I've, uh... I've got somethin' in both my eyes.}}
