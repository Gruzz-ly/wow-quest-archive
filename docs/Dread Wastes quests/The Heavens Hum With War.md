==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Azzix K'tai.jpg|Azzix K'tai|One bad mantid.}}
Slay Azzix K'tai.
*[[Azzix K'tai]] slain {{co|52.6|10.3|Dread Wastes}}

==Description==
The [[mantid]] don't ever make my job easy, but now they've gone too far.

We can fend off the occasional attack from [[Kor'vess]], but now... now they're starting to surround us.  What's worse, they're draining the amber from our tree.

This will not stand!  We need that amber!  To make beer!

They've dug a burrow into the south side of the tree.  I'm short-handed here.  Could you take care of them for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Azzix, his name was.  I think.  Azzix K'tai.

==Completion==
We're not here to hurt anybody.  We just want to make a little brew out of this tree sap.  Is that too much to ask?

==Notes==
Exit the camp and circle around the tree to the southeast. At the south end of the tree is the entrance to the [[Amber Vault]]. Run down the stairs and note the [[Scroll of Auspice]] at the base of the steps offering a quest, [[Sacred Recipe]]. Pick it up, then cross to the opposite side of the room to find [[Azzix K'tai]], a level 89 mantid with 653,000 health.

Behind him is the mantid lore object [[Amber (object)|Amber]]. Kill him, then head back.
