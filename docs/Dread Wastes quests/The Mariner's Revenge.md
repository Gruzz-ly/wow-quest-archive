==Description==
I'm not gonna sit in a damn rocking chair while my crew gets devoured by a [[kraken|leviathan]]!

Come on, let's get to the dock and launch a dinghy. I got a special one set up just for this kind of situation. My own little Mist-Hopper Jr.

We'll give that thing a case of harpoon fever.

I knew we could do it. Never met anything that can't be killed with enough harpoons.

==Notes==
[[File:The Mariner's Revenge - Jiao wounded.jpg|thumb|Jiao after being hit 20 times in each spot]]
On accept:
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|The Mist-Hopper Jr. is on the dock just southeast of here. Let's go!}}
:''He takes off running in that direction.''
Follow him. Then hop in the dinghy.
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|Aim for the bow, the port and starboard buoyancy sacs, and the stern...}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|Err, sorry... Let me put that another way.}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|Shoot it in th face! And the sides! And the pooper! You know, the soft bits.}}
The dinghy provides one ability:
:{{Abilities|Harpoon Cannon|range=300|A rapid-fire harpoon cannon salvaged from the Mist-Hopper.|icon=inv_misc_2h_harpoon_b_01|notes=Instant. Not on the GCD.}}
Spam it, aiming at each of the four targets on the leviathan as the dinghy circles around.

On getting 20 hits in each spot, Jiao will start bleeding a black liquid while Soggy says one of the following:
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|Keep it up!}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|That is some first-rate harpoonery!}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|Looks like he sprung a leak!}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|Nice shooting!}}

Once all four quotas have been met, Soggy takes aim with a harpoon:
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|[[Mazu]], guide my arm...}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|HURGHH!!!}}
:''He launches the harpoon! Jiao retreats seaward and disappears.''
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|Ha ha! What do you think of that, you old squid?!}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|That's right! Back to the depths with ya!}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|Alright, let's get back to shore.}}

After a fade to black, the player ends up back at the southern dock of Soggy's Gamble. Everything has returned to normal in the town: the [[Deckhand (Dread Wastes)|Deckhands]] are back and the [[Jiao Spawn]] have disappeared. Speak with Soggy at the end of the dock. [[Deck Boss Arie]], next to him, offers the conclusion.
