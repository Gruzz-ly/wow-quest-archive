==Objectives==
Investigate [[Kor'vess]].
* [[Amber Taps]] investigated
* [[Mark of the Empress]] investigated
* [[Heartroot of Kypari Kor]] investigated

==Description==
You found this on a member of the swarm? It seeps with corruption... and with power. We could be faced with a serious threat if the rest of the [[mantid]]'s [[amber]] is similarly corrupted.

Far to the west in the [[Dread Wastes]] lies Kor'vess, a large [[kypari tree]] that provides the swarm with most of its amber. From there, we can determine just how much of their stores have been infused with the energy of the [[Old God]]s.

I will meet you closer to the tree.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have we looked everywhere?

==Completion==
The mantid appear to be corrupting the entire tree. It is worse than I thought.

==Notes==

;Heartroot of Kypari Kor investigated
: ''Navy blue energy flows throught the root.''
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Even the tree's heartroot has been corrupted. This does not bode well.}}
