*[[Mistblade Scale-Lord]] slain {{co|66.4|66.1|Dread Wastes}}

==Description==
In order for our efforts against the mantid empire to continue, we require more amber.

There is a great deposit of amber underneath [[Lake of Stars|the lake to the south]], but the area is inhabited by a savage [[saurok]] tribe.

I cannot spare anyone else. You must go to the lake and test the tribe's strength. Thin their numbers and eliminate their leader.

Surely this is not too great a task for you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
The amber looks familiar for some reason...

==Completion==
The whispers seem to be emanating from within this amber.

Could there be another paragon sleeping within?

==Notes==
Pick up [[Extending Our Coverage]] before heading out. Extending Our Coverage takes place to the southwest between Kypari Ik and the Briny Muck, while Amber Is Life takes place to the southeast by [[Kypari Ik]] and the [[Lake of Stars]], so pick one set to do first.

Head southeast to the [[Lake of Stars]] and start killing [[Mistblade Ripper]]s. Any one of them will drop the [[Strange Relic]], which starts [[Relics of the Swarm]]. Then, while killing other [[saurok]] of the [[Mistblade tribe]], loot the [[Mantid Relic]]s off of the ground.

The {{NPC||Mistblade Scale-Lord}} is in a small cave with its mouth just southeast of the lake.{{coords|66.8|63.9|Dread Wastes}}

On entering the cave:
:{{text|whisper|A Mysterious Voice|Even in my sleep, I hear her terror.}}
:{{text|whisper|A Mysterious Voice|Fear grips her mind and body. The Empress is no longer fit to rule the empire.}}

Near the Ancient Amber Chunk:
:{{text|whisper|A Mysterious Voice|A presence approaches! Someone out there can here me! But... it is no Klaxxi.}}

Aggro the Scale-Lord:
:{{text|say|Mistblade Scale-Lord|This amber is ours, trespasser! Amber not for the mantid!}}
:{{text|whisper|A Mysterious Voice|The time of awakening must be near, but they have not yet come for me. Why do the Klaxxi wait?}}

The Scale-Lord is a level 90 saurok with 1,181,000 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Charge|range=5-35|Charges an enemy, inflicting normal damage and stuns the opponent for 2 sec.|notes=Instant. Hits for ~10000 Physical on cloth.}}
*{{abilities|Cleave|Inflicts 400% of normal melee damage to an enemy and its nearest ally.|notes=Next melee. Hits for ~45,000 Phyiscal on cloth.}}
*{{abilities|Demoralizing Shout|Reduces the attack power of nearby enemies for 30 sec.}}
*{{abilities|Kick|range=Melee|Kicks an enemy for 71 damage, interrupting the spell being cast for 6 sec.|notes=Instant.}}

Finish him off. Interact with the amber chunk:
:{{text|whisper|A Mysterious Voice|Yes! Break it! Free me from this amber sleep!}}

{{NPC||Korven the Prime}} appears:
:{{text|say|Korven the Prime|At... last... my time has come.}}
:{{text|say|Korven the Prime|Yes, Klaxxi'va. How long I have waited to hear the Council's command!}}
:{{text|say|Korven the Prime|I see. Much has transpired since I first entered my long sleep.}}
:{{text|say|Korven the Prime|There is much to do. But first, Wakener... help me recover my strength.}}

Speak with him:
:As soon as I awakened, the Klaxxi sensed my presence and relayed as much as they dared.
:They confirmed my own suspicions. The Empress is no longer fit to rule the empire. She must be... cleansed.
Pick up the followup quests: [[Feeding the Beast]] and [[Living Amber (quest)]].
