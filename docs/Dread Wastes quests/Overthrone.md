Speak to Klaxxi'va Ik to begin the ritual.

:''[[Klaxxi'va Kor]], [[Klaxxi'va Krik]] and [[Klaxxi'va Set]] joins the others in channeling their magic into the immense amber spire in the center of Klaxxi'vess.  Suddenly, the ground shakes and from behind Klaxxi'va Krik flames of [[sha]] energy blast violently from the ground.  A nearly solid image of the Empress appears; the ends of her wings and limbs are corrupted by sha energy and cloud of energy surges from beneath her.''
:{{text|say|Grand Empress Shek'zeer|Death to all who dare challenge my empire!}}
:''Shek'zeer fires her own sha-tainted spell into the amber spire through the back of Klaxxi'va Krik, killing him instantly.  The moment she does so, Klaxxi'va Vor and [[Klaxxi'va Sra]] disengage and throw up shields that leaves them stunned but saves their lives; [[Klaxxi'va Zan]] and [[Klaxxi'va Kek]] don't react fast enough and are killed, their bodies exploding.  Klaxxi'va Set dies a moment later, but the delay allows Klaxxi'va Kor to shield himself as well.  Shek'zeer's lethal spell has been traveling through the spire and slowly but surely overwhelms [[Klaxxi'va Ik]]'s spell, the amber color draining from him: he can only watch his death approaching and he is killed as well.''
:''It is a complete disaster for the council.  Five elders are dead, leaving [[Klaxxi'va Vor]], [[Klaxxi'va Sra]] and [[Klaxxi'va Kor]] as the only survivors.''
:{{text|say|Grand Empress Shek'zeer|Such is the fate of those who question authority.}}
:''The Empress roars and her image disappears.''

Speak to Klaxxi'va Vor for the turn in.
