==Objectives==
Use the Bag of Clams to feed 8 Coldwhisker Otters in [[Lonesome Cove]].
*[[Coldwhisker Otter]] fed x8
*[[Bag of Clams]] (provided)

==Description==
You know what happened to the bait in those pots?

[[Otter]]s. That's what happened.

They prefer fresh clams, but they'll pick our crab traps clean if they're hungry enough.

The otters in Lonesome Cove are protected by law and we run a legitimate operation here. As much as I'd love to chum those little rats and call it a day, we just make sure they aren't hungry enough to raid the crab pots.

Toss 'em a few clams to keep them busy while you're out there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 236000 XP
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[The Anglers]]

==Progress==
In the words of my old deck boss: "Do what I say, 'cause I said it!"

==Completion==
That should keep their little whiskers out of our traps for awhile.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Fresh Pots]] before heading out.

Head out in the water, east to the [[Lonesome Cove]]. Otters are friendly level one beasts, so just use the provided bag of clams on them when they come down to dig. Feeding an otter will cause it to happily swim around in a circle with a heart over its head for a few seconds.
