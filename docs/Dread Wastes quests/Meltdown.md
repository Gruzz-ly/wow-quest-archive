==Objectives==
Slay 6 Zan'thik Venomstings in [[Zan'vess]]. Use Korven's Experimental Grenade to counter their armor plating.
*[[Zan'thik Amberhusk]] slain (6)
*[[Korven's Experimental Grenades]] (provided)

==Description==
The venomsting scorpions on Zan'vess are fed sap from a young age, causing a fascinating mutation in which their natural armor plating becomes infused with amber. Effectively, it's organic [[kyparite]], the same substance used in forging most of the empire's weapons and armor.

I think I've found a way to chemically break down kyparite, but it needs testing. Use these grenades on the Zan'thik venomstings and observe the results.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
The [[kypari]] truly are amazing.  They color the entire ecosystem around them in ways I had never thought possible.

==Completion==
The kyparite ignited, did it?  Fascinating!

Not exactly what I was hoping for, but it's something.

==Notes==
Head southwest off the mainland to [[Zan'vess]]. Get started killing mantid. And the named, [[Vess-Guard Vik'az]], who patrols the housing complex center of the island just south of the kypari tree itself. And the [[kypari worm]]s, looking for [[Kyparite Shards]]. And looting the Dreadspore Bulbs on the ground, mindful of the [[Haunt of Fear|Haunts of Fear]] that may come out or any of the other random debuffs... And killing the [[Thought-Bound Miner]]s for their [[Zan'thik Shackles]]. And testing out [[Korven's Experimental Grenades]] on the [[Zan'thik Amberhusk]]s on the western side of the island.

Finally, don't forget to kill [[Kypa'rak]] and loot the [[Massive Kyparite Core]] from its corpse, which starts [[Kypa'rak's Core]], the "hidden" daily of Zan'vess.
