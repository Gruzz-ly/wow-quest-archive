==Objectives==
Awaken the paragon in [[Duskroot Fen]].
*Awaken [[Hisek the Swarmkeeper]]
*[[Klaxxi Tuning Fork#Dropping Our Signal]] (provided)

==Description==
The beacon in [[Amberglow Hollow]] seems to have been tampered with. Right before the signal cut out the [[Klaxxi'va]] picked up a signal for another paragon nearby.

They believe he is hidden in that wretched little swamp, Duskroot Fen.

I will meet you in the fen to set up a temporary beacon until I can get Amberglow operational again.

You will wake the paragon and then you will help me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
{{cost|11|40|}}  (or {{cost|19|84|50}} if completed at level 90)
*236,000 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with The [[Klaxxi]]

==Completion==
It seems my work will begin immediately. You have come to a dangerous place, Wakener.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
