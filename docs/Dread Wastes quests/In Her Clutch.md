==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Kor'ik.jpg|Kor'ik|We have found a paragon near your location.}}
Locate and waken the [[mantid]] paragon in [[Clutches of Shek'zeer|The Clutches of Shek'zeer]].
*Paragon Wakened {{co|44.8|41.6|Dread Wastes}}

==Description==
The crystal sings to the Klaxxi. They sense a paragon in the clutch, east of the tower.

Clutch-keepers are trying to pollute this one. The Klaxxi will not permit this.

Go and find the paragon. Place your hands on his chamber, and the Klaxxi will channel their whispers through you to break him free. Protect him if you can.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 429 rings|Band of Channeled Whispers|Ring of Unspeakable Nightmares|Band of Sudden Dreams|Seal of the Paragon Wakened|Clutch-Keeper Seal}}
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Completion==
My slumber was interrupted by sudden dreams. Unspeakable nightmares.

Then I awoke.

The Klaxxi have spoken to me. I have my orders. There is much to be done.

==Notes==
After interacting with the Inactive Sonic Relay, [[Dead Zone]] completes automatically and this quest is offered.

Start moving southeast killing bladesworn, clutch-keepers and swarmborn along the way. Note the Sha-Haunted Crystal in the middle of the spawn clutch. It starts [[A Source of Terrifying Power]]. Pick it up, then interact with the Ancient Amber Chunk, and prepare for a fight:

:{{text|bossemote|Hold off the swarm while Malik the Unscathed awakens!}}
:{{text|say|Malik the Unscathed|Unngghh...}}
70 seconds later...
:{{text|say|Malik the Unscathed|I am returned. I heed the call of the Klaxxi.}}
Wrap up then head back to Klaxxi'vess.

This completes the "Malik the Unscathed" portion of [[Amber is the Color of My Energy]].

On complete:
:{{text|say|Klaxxi'va Vor|Malik the Unscathed.}}
:{{text|say|Klaxxi'va Vor|Never a glancing blow laid upon you, but countless foes cut down by your halberd.}}
:{{text|say|Malik the Unscathed|And countless more to come, Klaxxi'va. It is my honor to serve in our time of need.}}
:{{text|say|Klaxxi'va Vor|And serve you shall. Arm yourself at the quartermaster. The drones here are at your disposal.}}
:{{text|say|Malik the Unscathed|Right away, Klaxxi'va.}}
:{{text|say|Malik the Unscathed|This soft one should serve well. Come, Wakener.}}
