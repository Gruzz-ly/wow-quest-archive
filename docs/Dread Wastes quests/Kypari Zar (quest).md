==Objectives==
Activate the Sonic Tower, then defend [[Korven the Prime]] as he examines the tree.
*Sonar Tower examined {{co|59.9|59.5|Dread Wastes}}
*Korven the Prime defended

==Description==
What is that tree on the hill to the west? Can it be... [[Kypari Zar]]?

<Korven the Prime lapses into silence.>

When I returned from my final ravage, before being risen to a paragon, I was given the honor of planting that very tree.

I see it has grown into a great [[kypari]], but... it seems something is amiss.

There is an old sonar tower at the base of the tree. Take me there, Wakener. I can use the tower to take a closer look.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
What has happened to our home? Things feel amiss.

==Completion==
Once, great rivers of amber coursed through this tree's veins. Now, it is but a dried husk.

==Notes==
Head west of the [[Lake of Stars]] to [[Kypari Zar]], minding the [[Horrorscale Scorpid]] packs. Just off of the path leading south to [[Soggy's Gamble]] from the lake is the Sonar Tower. Interact with it.
:{{text|say|Korven the Prime|Yes, it is true! This IS Kypari Zar!}}
:{{text|say|Korven the Prime|But why do I sense no life emanating from within? Why do I sense no amber sap running through its veins?}}
:{{text|say|Korven the Prime|I must examine the tree. Guard me while I perform this task, Wakener!}}

*{{text|say|Ik'thik Towerguard|Stealer of signals! This is the Empress's tower!}}
A wave of two, then of four, then of six [[Ik'thik Towerguard]]s spawn, each weak level 90 mantid with 39,914 health. They hit very weakly, so AoE them all down.
:{{text|say|Korven the Prime|It is done. Kypari Zar... cries out in unbearable agony.}}
