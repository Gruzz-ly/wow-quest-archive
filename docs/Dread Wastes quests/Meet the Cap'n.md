==Objectives==
Speak with [[Captain "Soggy" Su-Dao|"Soggy" Su-Dao]] in [[Soggy's Gamble]].

==Description==
Alright, <name>, I got another job for ya.

You see that [[lion seal]] in the pen over there? Name's [[Dog (Dread Wastes)|Dog]]. He's been Soggy's pet for years.

Dog's acting up lately - I think he's getting restless in that pen. Why don't you go talk to Soggy and let him know.

I'd say it's about time you meet the cap'n anyway.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|14}}
*23600 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[The Anglers]]

==Completion==
New deckhand, eh? We'll see about that.

I run a tight ship - even if she IS at the bottom of the sea.

==Notes==

Just to the east.

His gossip text:
{{Dialogue|
Don't mind those [[Deckhand|two idiots]] outside - they're caught up in some fad called "sharking."

I'd wager they feel pretty dumb about that picture in a couple of months.
