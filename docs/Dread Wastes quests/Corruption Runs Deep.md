==Objectives==
Defeat the traitor in the Duskroot Fen.
*Defeat the traitor in the Duskroot Fen.

==Description==
Today you learn that no one can be trusted in times of war, Wakener. Even those closest to the [[Klaxxi]] are susceptible to corruption.

Who knows how long this traitor has been corrupted. He must be destroyed!

You appear confused. Do you not see the traitor in our midst? Allow me to adjust your vision.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40|}}   (or {{cost|19|84|50}} if completed at level 90)
*13,690 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Klaxxi|The Klaxxi]]

==Completion==
You will see more of this. War is never pretty.

The [[Grand Empress Shek'zeer|empresses]]' corruption is far reaching and hard to detect.

There is much work to be done. We need to start repairing the damage [[Kor'ik]] did.

After accepting the quest.
:{{text|say|Hisek the Swarmkeeper|This may disorient you momentarily, Wakener. It is always difficult the first time your eyes truly see.}}
:{{text|say|Hisek the Swarmkeeper|Now you will see. Traitors hide within our ranks.}}
:{{text|say|Kor'ik|I see the paragon has been awakened.}}
:{{text|say|Hisek the Swarmkeeper|Kor'ik! How long have you worked for the empress?!}}
:{{text|say|Kor'ik|The paragon does not speak truth, Wakener. His mind did not survive encasement.}}
:{{text|say|Kor'ik|He cannot allow him to live in this madness. The Klaxxi will want him put down.}}
:{{text|say|Hisek the Swarmkeeper|The only madness here is your own Kor'ik! Did you really think you would go unnoticed forever?}}
:{{text|say|Hisek the Swarmkeeper|You will not deceive us. We see you for who you truly are!}}
:{{text|say|Kor'ik|You and the Klaxxi are fools! Your arrogance will be your end!}}
After defeating Kor'ik.
:{{text|yell|Kor'ik|Empress Shek'zeer will destroy you!}}
:{{text|yell|Kor'ik|Empress Shek'zeer knows your plans. Your treachery will be punished.}}
