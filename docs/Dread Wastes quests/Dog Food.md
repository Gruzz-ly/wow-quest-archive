==Objectives==
Help [[Dog (Dread Wastes)|Dog]] to eat the remains of 10 [[Rockshell Snapclaw]]s.
*Dog Fed (10)

==Description==
<Dog whines as best as a [[lion seal]] can, feebly lifting one flipper toward his massive jaws.

He's hungry.

The [[Shelf of Mazu]] is covered in rockshell [[makrura]] that should make a fine meal for him.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Anglers]]

==Progress==
<This has got to be the most pathetic lion seal you've ever seen.>

==Completion==
<Dog licks his chops happily, looking satisfied.>

==Notes==
Out in the [[Shelf of Mazu]] for [[Walking Dog]], among other quests, summon Dog. He immediately offers this quest.

The Silt Vents are on the northeast end of the Shelf of Mazu, almost due west from [[Soggy's Gamble]].
:{{text|emote|Dog swims excitedly through the vents of warm water.}}
The [[Wreck of the Mist-Hopper]] is just southwest of the silt vents.
:{{text|emote|Dog rubs against the prow of the Mist-Hopper and whimpers.}}
Inside the ship, below deck forward, is Soggy's Footlocker. Loot the [[Sealed Charter Tube]] out of it.

Finally, southwest, just offshore of [[Zan'vess]], is the whale corpse.
:{{text|emote|Dog looks around cautiously before leaving his mark on the whale corpse.}}
Crab pots are all over the seafloor, and merely interacting with them is enough to get them up to the surface. Kill [[Longfin Thresher]]s, loot their [[Thresher Jaw]]s, and extract [[Thresher Teeth]] from them, 22-30 at a time. Carefully. Last but not least, kill [[Rockshell Snapclaw]]s so Dog can eat them.
