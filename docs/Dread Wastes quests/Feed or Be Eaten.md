==Objectives==
Begin [[Kovok]]'s training by feeding him 6 [[Succulent Turtle Filet]]s found on the [[Brineshell Snapper]]s in the [[Briny Muck]].
*Succulent Turtle Filets fed to Kovok (6)

==Description==
After years of working with the [[kunchong]] I developed a theory; raising one from infancy would strengthen the bond and therefore strengthen the sonic connection.

I had just begun training [[Kovok]] when I was choosen for encasement. He is still very young and will need diligent training to reach his full potential.

I'm entrusting Kovok to you, but be warned, if any harm comes to him your life is forfeit.

First you must feed him to gain his trust. The turtles in the area should be suitable for this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Once the bond is formed a Kunchong will gladly give its life for you.

==Completion==
Very good! I had half-expected Kovok to just eat you. What a pleasant surprise to see you both in one piece.

Perhaps Kunchong raising is in your blood.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Kunchong Whisperer]] before heading out. After accepting both:
:{{text|say|Kaz'tik the Manipulator|I will return to Klaxxi'vess to meet with the council. Please take good care of Kovok.}}
Head northwest and start killing [[Brineshell Snapper]]s and members of the [[Muckscale tribe]]: [[Muckscale Flesh-Hunter|flesh-hunters]], [[Muckscale Ripper|rippers]], [[Muckscale Shaman|shaman]] and [[Muckscale Slayer|slayers]]. [[Oracle Hiss'ir]] is on the main Muckscale island in the center of the muck. Kill him, then loot the Glowing Amber he was guarding to start [[Falling to Pieces]]. Head back up to [[Klaxxi'vess]] to turn in, or do [[Amber Is Life]] if not already done.
