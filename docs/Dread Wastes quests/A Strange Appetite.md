==Objectives==
[[File:Spiny Starfish.jpg|thumb|Spiny Starfish]]
Collect 12 Starfish Meat.
*[[Starfish Meat]] (12)

==Description==
Food. I must have food.

In my time, the meat of the starfish brought not only strength, but also clarity of mind. This is what I must eat.

Bring this to me from the nearby shallows.

Wait much longer, and I will devour you instead.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
The juices of the starfish will clear my mind.

==Completion==
Yes, give it here! Well done, Wakener.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Fine Dining]] and [[A Bloody Delight]] before heading out.

Exit the cave back into the [[Muckscale Shallows]]. While in the area, Skeer provides the Mark of Skeer, granting water breathing at 125% swim speed. Start killing [[makura]] and [[remora]], and gathering starfish from the seabed and rocks underwater. The makura are neutral, and so are [[Bitterwater Crab]]s, so make sure the right mobs are getting killed. Tails drop from roughly every other clacker, and remora drop 6-15 units of blood each, averaging around 8. Gather everything up, then head back.
