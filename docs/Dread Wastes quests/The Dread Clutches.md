==Objectives==
[[File:Shek'zeer Clutch-Keeper.jpg|thumb|[[Shek'zeer Clutch-Keeper]].]]
Slay 6 Shek'zeer Clutch-Keepers in the [[Clutches of Shek'zeer]].
*[[Shek'zeer Clutch-Keeper]] slain (6)

==Description==
The imperial clutches have become an abomination! Clutch-Keepers rush the development of new swarmborn, saturating them in this vile "sha" energy before sending them away to the wall.

The Klaxxi wish to stem the tide of swarmborn production in these dread clutches. Put the keepers to death!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Those swarmborn are terrified, chattering husks. Not fit to swarm.

==Completion==
A few less traitors for us to feed to the kunchong when the dust settles.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Not Fit to Swarm]], [[Amber Arms]] and [[Dead Zone]] before heading out. Then speak with Kil'ruk again:
:I trust in the will of the Klaxxi. They know what is best for our people.
:{{gossip|Please fly me to the Clutches of Shek'zeer}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|I will drop you near the tower. Do not get used to this.}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|The tower is just there. I will cover you from the sky. Be quick.}}
Adventurers are buffed with Angel of Death: "Granted by Kil'ruk the Windreaver. When you gather at least 2 enemies within 10 yds, Kil'ruk will assist with Reave. This cannot occur more than once every 60 sec. Only one Klaxxi Enhancement can be active at a time. Only effective in Dread Wastes. Reave - Kil'ruk cleaves nearby enemies dealing 118182 damage instantly and causing them to bleed for an additional 118182 damage over 10 sec."

Should any unfortunate mantid be in the area where players land, they find themselves one-shot via Sonic Divebomb, which deals ~550,000 Physical damage!

First things first, run just to the northeast and interact with the Inactive Sonic Relay. This will complete Dead Zone and start [[In Her Clutch]] automatically.

Start moving southeast killing bladesworn, clutch-keepers and swarmborn along the way. Note the Sha-Haunted Crystal in the middle of the spawn clutch. It starts [[A Source of Terrifying Power]]. Pick it up, then interact with the Ancient Amber Chunk, and prepare for a fight:

:{{text|bossemote|Hold off the swarm while Malik the Unscathed awakens!}}
:{{text|say|Malik the Unscathed|Unngghh...}}
70 seconds later...
:{{text|say|Malik the Unscathed|I am returned. I heed the call of the Klaxxi.}}
Wrap up then head back to Klaxxi'vess.
