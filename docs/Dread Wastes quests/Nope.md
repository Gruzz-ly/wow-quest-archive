==Objectives==
[[File:Dreadspinner Tender.jpg|thumb|[[Dreadspinner Tender]].]]
Slay 6 Dreadspinner Tenders and use the Shado-Pan Dragon Gun to destroy 20 Dreadspinner Eggs in the [[Terrace of Gurthan]].
*Dreadspinner Eggs destroyed (20)
*[[Dreadspinner Tender]] slain (6)
*[[Shado-Pan Dragon Gun (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
We're holding, but just barely.  Anything you can do to stem the tide of dreadspinners coming up the wall would be a big help.

Feel like tearing open spider eggs one at a time by hand?

I didn't think so. Take one of our dragon guns and light it up down there.  I wanna hear those puppies pop.

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 236000 XP

==Progress==
Hey, help me out here!

==Completion==
Nice work with that dragon gun.  I did what I could down here, but arrows are only so useful against these things.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Falling Down]] before heading out. Then use the rope right behind her to rappel down.

Start using the dragon cannon to burn spider eggs. It doesn't really work all that well on full-size spiders, though. Head southwest. [[Marksman Lann]] can be found in the lower level of the terrace, stuck in a web.

If you use the gun in his direction:

* {{text|say|Careful!  Don't burn the chops...}}
* {{text|say|Hey!  Live, FLAMMABLE pandaren here!}}
* {{text|say|Hey, easy with that thing!}}
* {{text|say|Woah, point that somewhere else!}}
