==Objectives==
Speak with [[Master Angler Ju Lien]] in [[Soggy's Gamble]].

==Description==
That was some amazing work you and the captain did out there, <name>! It's an honor to have you on the crew.

Oh! And Ju Lien survived! He swam ashore just after you started letting the harpoons fly. He was raving about some kind of gigantic egg or something that washed in with {{NPC||Jiao}}.

Go check up on him, will you? He's probably hauled it out of the water by now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Completion==
Hey there!

Oh, I'm fine. I've had worse spills than that after a night at the [[Chum Bucket]].

But would you look at this thing? I spotted it peeking out of the sea floor when I went under - Jiao must have dredged it up while he was thrashing around.

Not really sure what to do with it. Seeing as how you pretty much saved all our hides, I think we owe you this catch.

==Notes==
[[File:Mazu's Bounty finale.jpg|thumb|Ka'roz in the net]]

Ju Lien's up closer to Arie, rather down at his spot on the cape. In the big net is a gigantic chunk of amber!

On complete:
:{{text|say|Master Angler Ju Lien|So, do you just want to... I don't know... Roll it away or something?}}
:{{text|say|Master Angler Ju Lien|Wait... is it moving?}}
:''Ka'roz bursts forth from the amber chunk!''
:{{text|say|Ka'roz the Locust|Tremble, fools! The locust has awakened!}}
:''Ka'roz quickly finds himself overcome and starts vomiting.''
:{{text|say|Ka'roz the Locust|WHARRGARBL!!!}}
:{{text|say|Master Angler Ju Lien|Oh, nasty.}}
:{{text|yell|Master Angler Ju Lien|You okay up there?}}
:{{text|say|Ka'roz the Locust|Ugh... <cough> The locust is fine! <cough> <cough>}}
:''Ka'roz shakes off the crabs clinging to him.''
:{{text|say|Ka'roz the Locust|Get off me, insolent crabs!}}
:''Ka'roz gathers himself and lifts off, flying in the direction of Klaxxi'vess.''
:{{text|say|Ka'roz the Locust|The Klaxxi beckon...}}
:{{text|say|Master Angler Ju Lien|Well then.}}
:{{text|say|Master Angler Ju Lien|I'm guessing you know something about what just happened?}}
:{{text|say|Master Angler Ju Lien|Actually, forget it - I don't want to know. I'm going back to my lines.}}
:''Ju Lien walks back to the cape...''

This completes the "Like a Deck Boss" criterion of [[Dread Haste Makes Dread Waste]] and the "[[Ka'roz the Locust]]" criteron of [[Amber is the Color of My Energy]].
