==Objectives==
Use the Klaxxi Resonating Crystal on the Inactive Sonic Relay at the [[Heart of Fear]].

Speak with [[Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver]] at [[Klaxxi'vess]] for a ride to the Heart of Fear.
*Sonic Relay Activated {{co|40.0|39.0|Dread Wastes}}
*[[Klaxxi Resonating Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
A Klaxxi'va whispers to the tower. It carries their whisper far; to other towers, to mantid, to paragons. The whisper bounces back, and the Klaxxi hear it.

This way, they see all.

A tower near the palace is quiet. This will not do. It must sing for the Klaxxi.

It is my job to fix the tower, but if you serve the Klaxxi, you should serve me as well. You fix the tower, and I will wait here!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 236000 XP
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Completion==
<As the crystal buzzes to life, an alien voice permeates your mind.>

==Notes==
Pick up [[Not Fit to Swarm]], [[The Dread Clutches]] and [[Amber Arms]] before heading out. Then speak with Kil'ruk again:
:I trust in the will of the Klaxxi. They know what is best for our people.
:{{gossip|Please fly me to the Clutches of Shek'zeer}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|I will drop you near the tower. Do not get used to this.}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|The tower is just there. I will cover you from the sky. Be quick.}}
Adventurers are buffed with Angel of Death: "Granted by Kil'ruk the Windreaver. When you gather at least 2 enemies within 10 yds, Kil'ruk will assist with Reave. This cannot occur more than once every 60 sec. Only one Klaxxi Enhancement can be active at a time. Only effective in Dread Wastes. Reave - Kil'ruk cleaves nearby enemies dealing 118182 damage instantly and causing them to bleed for an additional 118182 damage over 10 sec.}}

Should any unfortunate mantid be in the area where players land, they find themselves one-shot via Sonic Divebomb, which deals ~550,000 Physical damage!

First things first, run just to the northeast and interact with the Inactive Sonic Relay. This will complete Dead Zone and start [[In Her Clutch]] automatically.
