==Objectives==
Kill 6 infected wildlife. Infected wildlife may include [[Bonedust Moth]]s, [[Bluehide Mushan]], and [[Mutating Scorpid]].
*Infected wildlife slain (6)

==Description==
The Empress's genemancers play with dangerous toys.

To the south, they are injecting local wildlife with pheromone-laden parasites, in an attempt to create monstrous mutations for war.

Carelessly, they have allowed their parasitic worms to escape into the local ecosystem.

Left unchecked, the infection will spread from one animal to another, until we have an outbreak.

I will inject you with a mild toxin.  With it, you will be able to identify infected creatures.

Kill the carriers at once.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Do not worry.  I have given you a weak toxin that allows you to share my ability to sense pheromones.

It has no effect on [[mantid]].

==Completion==
So the infection was spreading.  You halted the spread just in time, it seems.

I doubt that the genemancers will stop their outrageous experimentation, but we must continue to thwart their efforts.
