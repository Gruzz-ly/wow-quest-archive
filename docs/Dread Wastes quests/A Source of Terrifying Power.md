==Objectives==
[[File:Sha-Haunted Crystal.jpg|thumb|Sha-Haunted Crystal.]]
Bring the Sha-Haunted Crystal to [[Ambersmith Zikk]] at [[Klaxxi'vess]].
*[[Sha-Haunted Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
<The clutch-keepers seem to be using these blinding white crystals as magical foci. Peering inside, you see thick tendrils of black smoke swirling in the center. One of the workers at Klaxxi'vess may know more about this material and why it is so abundant in the wastes.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Completion==
Do you have any idea what that is? It's amber!

But it is polluted with fear.

I would not expect an outsider like you to understand the consequences of this.

==Notes==
While killing [[Shek'zeer Swarmborn]] for [[Not Fit to Swarm]], note the Sha-Haunted Crystal in the middle of the spawn camp. It starts this quest.

==Progression==
{{Klaxxi'vess}}
