==Objectives==
Bring 4 Mushan Tongues to [[Kaz'tik the Manipulator]] at [[Klaxxi'vess]].
*[[Mushan Tongue]] (4)

==Description==
[[Kovok]] is growing at an accelerated rate, but his brain may not be able to keep up. He'll require a special diet to ensure that he does not outgrow the capacity to control his own body.

[[Mushan]] tongue is rich in the nutrients that promote brain growth in [[kunchong]], but they normally eat the beasts whole and fill up quickly. If we feed Kovok only mushan tongues every couple of days or so, it should balance out his growth.

Greatback mushan graze the hills east of here, near the [[Terrace of Gurthan|Gurthani Terrace]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Have you found a suitable meal for Kovok?

==Completion==
Kovok was whining the whole time you were away. It was really quite pathetic.

==Notes==
Head northeast to the [[Thundering Run]], between the [[Terrace of Gurthan]] and the northern branch of the [[Horrid March]]. Look for the mushan specifically called [[Greatback Mushan]] and kill them for their tongues. The tongues are [[party loot]], so grouping up will help for this quest as every member of the party can loot a copy of each tongue that drops.
