== Description ==
The Klaxxi have detected the existence of another paragon, Wakener.

This one was kept well-hidden from us, and for good reason.

The Empress already has possession of this one, and her adjuncts work to destroy it even now.

They are performing their sorcery in a chamber deep beneath the palace, and they must be stopped.

We hold Klaxxi'vess. You must go in our stead. Find the entrance to their chamber from the ledge to the west. 

==Completion==
You have done your duty well, Wakener. 

== Gains ==
You will receive: {{cost|11|40|}}   (or {{cost|19|84|50}} if completed at level 90)

Upon completion of this quest you will also gain:	
*13,690 [[XP]]
*+250 rep with The Klaxxi

==Transcript==
After Xaril the Poisoned Mind is awakened:
:{{text|say|Xaril the Poisoned Mind|You came not a moment too soon, Wakener. The Adjuncts would have destroyed me as I slept.}}
:{{text|say|Xaril the Poisoned Mind|Even in my dreams, I could hear their dark thoughts...HER dark thoughts.}}
:{{text|say|Xaril the Poisoned Mind|The Empress fears her own undoing, yet fear itself is her undoing. She is gone beyond the edge of madness.}}
:{{text|say|Xaril the Poisoned Mind|Wait. The Klaxxi speak to me. Yes, Council, I have heard the Empress's intentions. Her reign must end.}}
:{{text|say|Xaril the Poisoned Mind|Tell me no more, Council. I will see my old home with my own eyes. I would gaze upon the ruin that Shek'zeer has wrought.}}
:{{text|say|Xaril the Poisoned Mind|There is much punishment to deliver for the empire's crimes. We have no time to waste, Wakener. Meet me outside.}}
