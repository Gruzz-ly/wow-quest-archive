==Objectives==
Kill Vess-Guard Vik'az in [[Zan'vess]].
*[[Vess-Guard Vik'az]] slain {{co|29.1|74.7|Dread Wastes}}

==Description==
Vess-Guard Vik'az co-ordinates the defense forces at Zan'vess. He is worth ten mantid in battle, and his presence inspires the Zan'thik who fight alongside him.

Needless to say, we need him dead.

He patrols the housing area at the center of the island.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Do not underestimate the impact of a precision strike. All of the Zan'thik will reel with the loss of Vik'az.

==Completion==
One by one, her champions fall.

==Notes==
Head southwest off the mainland to [[Zan'vess]]. Get started killing mantid. And the named, [[Vess-Guard Vik'az]], who patrols the housing complex center of the island just south of the kypari tree itself. And the [[kypari worm]]s, looking for [[Kyparite Shards]]. And looting the Dreadspore Bulbs on the ground, mindful of the [[Haunt of Fear|Haunts of Fear]] that may come out or any of the other random debuffs... And killing the [[Thought-Bound Miner]]s for their [[Zan'thik Shackles]]. And testing out [[Korven's Experimental Grenades]] on the [[Zan'thik Amberhusk]]s on the western side of the island.

Finally, don't forget to kill [[Kypa'rak]] and loot the [[Massive Kyparite Core]] from its corpse, which starts [[Kypa'rak's Core]], the "hidden" daily of Zan'vess.
