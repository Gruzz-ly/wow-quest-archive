== Objectives ==
Slay 7 Shuffling Mistlurkers and 2 Kyparites.
*[[Shuffling Mistlurker]] slain x7
*[[Kyparite (mob)|Kyparite]] slain x2

== Description ==
We are protected from the [[mantid]]. Such was the agreement made so many millennia ago.

There are forces from which we are not safe, however. The [[kyparite worm|kyparites]] beneath the ground to the west will haunt us, chase us... even eat us. The [[mistlurker]]s eat our kind by the handful.

Help our people, outsider. Defeat our enemies.

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 236000 XP

== Progress ==
We hate being eaten.

== Completion ==
It is good to have someone of your colossal size in our village.

You have many uses.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Fiery Wings]] and [[Incantations Fae and Primal]] before heading out.

The faerie dragons are closest. Run up to one and click on it. Then follow it as it starts flying away. Get between the sparkles and the ground to catch them. Afterword, head northwest to [[Rikkilea]] and start killing the [[gyreworm]]s. The named mistlurkers are at the west end of Rikkilea.
