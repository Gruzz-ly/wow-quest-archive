Bring 3 Motherseeds to the collection pit in [[Rikkitun Village]], with the assistance of the [[Rikkitun Chanter]]s.

You can use the Rikkitun Bell to re-summon your chanters if you become separated.
*Bring [[Motherseed]] back to the [[Motherseed Pit]] x3 {{co|36.7|17.6|Dread Wastes}}
*[[Rikkitun Bell]] (provided)

==Description==
I know what you and the [[Lya of Ten Songs|girl-panda]] seek. We can perform the rite for you... in time.

First, I require aid. The seeds fall from our great mother-tree. It is our responsibility to collect them, even in dangerous times like these.

Escort my chanters to the motherseeds, that they may bring them back to the collection pit.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
* 236000 XP

==Progress==
The collection pit is down the hill, just to the west of here.

==Completion==
Yes, good. The motherseeds are taken care of.

Now, we may speak of your enchantment.

==Notes==
Head west into the field. Plenty of Motherseeds litter the area. Interact with one then run to the pit just southwest of the main village, full of seeds.

==Progression==
