==Objectives==
Stomp out 6 Eyes of the Empress around the [[Terrace of Gurthan]]. Killing anything will grant you Pheromone Tracking, helping you detect them.
*[[Eye of the Empress]] slain (6)

==Description==
If this Empress is truly possessed by fear and paranoia, she will have sent scouts to every corner of the land in order to cement her control.

These scout grubs are likely everywhere, but difficult to spot with the naked eye.  Better to track them by the pheromone trails they leave behind.

I've already... gifted you... a reactive toxin that will reveal these trails to you for a brief time after experiencing the thrill of victory.

Go now to the Terrace of Gurthan and root out these spies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Best not to ask how I afflicted you with the toxin - you have become quite useful to us, and it would be a shame if we drove you mad with horror just yet.

==Completion==
Information is power, <name>.  We cannot allow the Empess to monitor our movements.
