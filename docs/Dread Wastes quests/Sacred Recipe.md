==Objectives==
Bring the Scroll of Auspice to [[Lya of Ten Songs]] at [[The Sunset Brewgarden]].
*[[Scroll of Auspice]] (provided)

==Description==
"When the horror comes a-rising<br />
And the heavens hum with war<br />
Our great vessel of salvation<br />
Must be broken from its core."

The scroll continues on for several stanzas. Perhaps somebody at the Brewgarden will be able to decipher its cryptic message.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 429 trinkets|Charm of Ten Songs|Braid of Ten Songs|Knot of Ten Songs}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is that some sort of scroll?

Would you mind if I took a look?

==Completion==
<Lya reads the entirety of the message.>

This scroll, this... prophecy...

It's terrifying!

==Notes==
Entering the [[Amber Vault]] for [[The Heavens Hum With War]], note the [[Scroll of Auspice]] on the ground at the base of the steps. It offers this quest.

{{Book|Scroll of Auspice|content=When the horror comes a-rising<br />
And the heavens hum with war<br />
Our great vessel of salvation<br />
Must be broken from its core.

Rending daggers of the great ones<br />
Shall be bound with wood and shade<br />
If the fiery wings of sunset kings<br />
Are ever to be stayed.

----

Incantations fae and primal<br />
Bought on promises of gold<br />
Bind the glamour to the thing<br />
That quenches fires and fears of old

Comprehend this sacred recipe<br />
Perform it as I've penned<br />
Drive its fruit through Blood of Ancients<br />
And your terror-war shall end.}}
