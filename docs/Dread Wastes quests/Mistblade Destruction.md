==Objectives==
Kill 6 Mistblade Rippers.
*[[Mistblade Ripper]] slain (6)

==Description==
[[Korven the Prime|Korven]] has told me of his findings. There is an enormous amber deposit sitting at the bottom of the [[Lake of Stars]].

Unfortunately, a hostile [[saurok]] tribe lives at the edge of the lake, and revere the amber as their own.

They will not allow us to enter their territory easily.

Go south to the lake. Kill the [[Mistblade tribe|Mistblade saurok]], so that we can more easily harvest the nearby amber.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Have you eliminated the opposition?

==Completion==
Well done. With access to this amber, we shall be able to craft weapons to our cause.

==Notes==
Pick up the other quests, then take Kil'ruk's free flight to [[Kypari Zar]]. Use his aerial decimation move to wipe out as many enemies as possible on landing. Don't forget about the [[Mistblade Scale-Lord]] in the [[Mistblade Den]]. He needs to die for [[The Scale-Lord]] too. Kill the quota of saurok around the lake, then focus on the other quests in the area before heading back to Klaxxi'vess.
