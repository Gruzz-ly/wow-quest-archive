== Objectives ==
Accompany [[Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver]] into the chamber below [[Klaxxi'vess]].
* Walk with Kil'ruk

== Description ==
You only understand part of [[Klaxxi|our order]]. You are an outsider, and have been treated as such.

It is no longer appropriate that we keep our secrets from you. There is something you should see.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|Rewards
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Seal of the Lucid
|Seal of the Unscathed
|Seal of the Bloodseeker
|Seal of the Windreaver
|Seal of the Prime}}	
You will also receive: {{cost|24|72}}

== Progress ==
There is something you should see.

== Completion ==
<Kil'ruk gives you a strange glance.>

The Klaxxi'va may never accept you fully. Their xenophobic minds are closed to the possibility of a useful <race>.

I, for one, have been proud to fight by your side, <class>. Your presence, and your assistance, do us great honor.

==Notes==
{{gossip|''What do you want to show me, Kil'ruk?''}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|Wakener, your deeds have earned you the trust of the [[Klaxxi]].}}
:''Kil'ruk heads for the door of Klaxxi'vess at a brisk pace.''
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|You are to be rewarded.  Walk with me.}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|We [[mantid]] are an elder race.  The [[pandaren]] you associate with - they are but children.  They have their role to play.}}
:''Kil'ruk reaches the door to the lower level and opens it, continuing the monologue while walking the path.''
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|Each cycle, our young swarm their walls.  The pandaren slay the weak.  The strong return.}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|With each generation, we grow ever stronger.}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|Before your history began, our empire was vast.  We shared this world with our sister kingdoms, [[Ahn'Qiraj]] and [[Azjol-Nerub (kingdom)|Azjol-Nerub]].}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|Our Gods were many, and powerful.  We mantid worshipped the seven heads of [[Y'Shaarj|Y'shaarj]].{{sic}}}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|Great was the Old One, and terrible was His wrath.  He consumed hope and begat despair; He inhaled courage and breathed fear.}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|When the usurpers came - the ones you call "[[Titan]]s" - Y'shaarj was destroyed.}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|His last terrible breath has haunted this land ever since, but [[Sha|the shadows he left behind]] are mere whispers of his former glory.}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|I tell you now, because you have earned this warning.}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|Your gods are not our gods, outsider.}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|If the [[Old Gods|Old Ones]] ever return, we mantid will once again stand by their side.}}
:''Kil'ruk stops in front of a picture of what is presumably a representation of Y'Shaarj and turns around, facing the adventurer.''
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|The wisest among you will do the same.}}

{{rfb-section|Mists of Pandaria}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|That is all that needs to be said. Come, take your reward, and remember what you have learned today.}}

Return to Kil'ruk's position up on the surface to turn in.
