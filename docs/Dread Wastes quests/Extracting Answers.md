== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Venom-Coated Mandibles from the [[Ik'thik Swarmborn]] in [[Kypari Ik]].
* [[Venom-Coated Mandible]] (6)

== Description ==
Kypari Ik is just one of many locations that houses some of [[Grand Empress Shek'zeer|Empress Shek'zeer]]'s offspring. In their juvenile state the young are reckless and difficult to control. They are also deadly.

Swarmborn are hatched with a highly toxic venom that diminishes in potency with age. The venom can incapacitate even the strongest and most skilled fighter if it hits flesh.

I would like you to bring me some of this venom.

== Rewards ==

You will also receive: {{cost|11|40}}

== Progress ==
Swarmborn venom will not only give us an additional weapon, it will also help us figure out what stage the swarm is in.

== Completion ==
This venom is in its advanced stages, but doesn't seem to be losing it's potency...

This is very curious. The Klaxxi will want to know immediately. Thank you, Wakener.
