==Objectives==
Locate the unearthed paragon in the [[Amber Quarry]] on [[Zan'vess]].

==Description==
We have just intercepted a message from an adjunct on Zan'vess. [[Yaungol]] laborers there have unearthed a paragon in the amber quarry on the back side of the island.

Get there immediately and free him before the Zan'thik destroy him!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|14}}
*23600 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Completion==
<From the looks of it, this [[mantid]] was just recently broken out of his chamber. He lets out a hacking cough.>

...Diss-ec...tor... has... returned...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Skeer the Bloodseeker (quest)]] before heading out. These quests take place in different locations, so choose one to do first.

Head southwest to [[Zan'vess]], then keep heading south to reach the southeastern corner of the island. On the eastern end of the [[Amber Quarry]] is {{NPC||Rik'kal the Dissector}}, already freed from the amber.
