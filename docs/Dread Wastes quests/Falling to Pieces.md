==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Kaz'tik the Manipulator.jpg|Kaz'tik the Manipulator}}
Return the Glowing Amber to [[Kaz'tik the Manipulator]].
*[[Glowing Amber]] (provided) {{co|42.0|63.6|Dread Wastes}}

==Description==
Why would the [[saurok]] have amber? more importantly, why would [[Oracle Hiss'ir]] be so protective of it?

It is unlikely this came from the heavily guarded [[Zan'vess]], so where did it come from?

Perhaps the [[Klaxxi]] will know what to make of it.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 437 chest pieces|Sunset Satin Robe|Sunset Hide Robes|Withered Wood Breastplate|Sunset Burnished Chestguard|Sunset Silk Robe|Sunset Leather Tunic|Wind-Reaver Breastplate|Sunset Heavy Chestpiece|Sunset Armored Chestpiece}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Where did you find this?

==Completion==
You were wise to bring this to us. This is a piece of another paragon's encasing amber.

The damage suggests the paragon may be in trouble.

I will speak with the council to decide what should be done next.

==Notes==
Killing [[Oracle Hiss'ir]] for [[The Kunchong Whisperer]], note the Glowing Amber he was guarding. It starts this quest.
