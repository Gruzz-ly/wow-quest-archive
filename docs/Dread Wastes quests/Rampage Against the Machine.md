==Objectives==
Kill 200 Mantid while controlling Kovok in the Scar.
*Locate [[Kovok]] near the [[Clutches of Shek'zeer]] {{co|50.8|41.4|Dread Wastes}}
*Mantid slain (200)

==Description==
Kovok has progressed at an astonishing rate. Perhaps the years in hibernation effected his growth process...

Whatever the reason, this could not have come at a better time. I believe it is time to test his abilities.

You have done so much to aid in his training. It is only fitting that you assist him in his first battle.

I've already guided him to the edge of the scar. Find him and destroy Shek'zeer's army!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 XP
*+130 reputation with [[The Klaxxi]]
*Completing this quest will give players the [[Test Drive (achievement)]] achievement.

==Progress==
Was the battle glorious?! How many of Shekzeer's army fell to Kovok?

==Completion==
I was able to glimpse moments of the battle through your mind. It looked to be a massacre! Well done!

==Notes==
Fly southwest down the path to reach the edge of the scar to find Kovok. Hop on, where it provides the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Poison Blast|range=50|Shoots poison at enemies, inflicting Nature damage, then additional damage every 3 sec. for 10 sec.|cd=3 sec.|notes=Instant. Hits for 3600 Nature, ticks for 5000 Nature. Use it as a pulling ability, as it will hit a decent amount of enemies in a wide arc in front of Kovok.}}
*{{abilities|Ground Slam|range=25|Kovok enrages, slamming his head into enemies, dealing damage and knocking back enemies in a cone in front of him.|cd=3 sec.|notes=Instant. Hits for ~100,000 Physical, ticks for 14,000 Physical.}}
*{{abilities|Slice|range=30|Slices enemies in front of the caster, dealing 400% damage and slowing them for 10 sec.|notes=1.5 sec cast. Can be cast while moving. Will one-shot most non-elite mantid.}}

Pull with Poison Blast, let mantid get close, wind up a Slice, then knock units away with a Ground Slam. Rinse and repeat.
