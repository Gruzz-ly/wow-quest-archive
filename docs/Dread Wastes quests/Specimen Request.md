==Objectives==
Collect 6 Kyparite Shards from Muck Tunnelers in The Briny Muck.
*[[Kyparite Shards]] (6)

==Description==
Kyparite worms have shown extreme adaptations in order to mimic the environment around them. They can also grow to immense sizes at rates which are nearly unheard of for most creatures.

Their physiology could provide valuable insight into further mutations.

Bring me sample shards from the muck tunnelers in the shallows near Zan'vess.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Do you have the specimens?

==Completion==
Well look at that, you actually got it done. I half expected to be scooping your remains out of the muck with a jar.

==Notes==
Head southwest off the mainland to [[Zan'vess]]. Get started killing mantid. And the named, [[Vess-Guard Vik'az]], who patrols the housing complex center of the island just south of the kypari tree itself. And the [[kypari worm]]s, looking for [[Kyparite Shards]]. And looting the Dreadspore Bulbs on the ground, mindful of the [[Haunt of Fear|Haunts of Fear]] that may come out or any of the other random debuffs... And killing the [[Thought-Bound Miner]]s for their [[Zan'thik Shackles]]. And testing out [[Korven's Experimental Grenades]] on the [[Zan'thik Amberhusk]]s on the western side of the island.

Finally, don't forget to kill [[Kypa'rak]] and loot the [[Massive Kyparite Core]] from its corpse, which starts [[Kypa'rak's Core]], the "hidden" daily of Zan'vess.
