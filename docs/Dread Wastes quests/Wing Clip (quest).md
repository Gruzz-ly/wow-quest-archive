==Objectives==
Collect 24 Needler Wings from [[Shek'zeer Needler]]s in the [[Clutches of Shek'zeer]].
*[[Needler Wings]] (24)

==Description==
The young fliers of this era are fascinating. Their exceptional agility and endurance were, in my time, the feats of incredibly skilled or mature fliers.

This would seem to indicate some kind of evolution in wing structure... Or perhaps a result of advancements in training? Induced genetic mutation? Selective breeding?

Gah! There's no way to know for certain without tissue samples.

Bring me their wings! And try not to ruin them in the process, will you? I need them intact!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Do you have the specimens?

==Completion==
Excellent, these are in fine shape.

==Notes==
Pick up all of the other dailies offered, then speak with Kil'ruk for a trip to the area. Make sure to use the landing ability to take out as many mantid as possible!

Get started north of the entrance to the [[Heart of Fear]], killing [[Shek'zeer Bladesworn]] (among others) for [[Culling the Swarm]] and killing [[Shek'zeer Needler]]s specifically for their [[Needler Wings]] for [[Wing Clip (quest)]]. There are four building entrances with steps leading downward and inward in the area that lead to the feeders for [[Sampling the Empire's Finest]]. The building entrances are marked on the map below, but the feeders themselves have their coordinates listed on the Sampling quest article. Also in the immediate vicinity of the eastern feeder entrance is [[Vess-Guard Na'kal]], who is the target of [[Shortcut to Ruin]].

Crossing southeast over the trail to the center of the [[Clutches of Shek'zeer]] are the elite [[Dread Kunchong]], being manipulated by [[Shek'zeer Manipulator]]s. Get within 20 yards of the kunchong and use the [[Sonic Disruption Fork]] to have the kunchong turn on any nearby manipulators and vastly weaken it. To get credit for the quest, more than 50% of the damage to the mobs must be dealt by the adventurer and not by any NPCs. Kunchong Cages are also in the area. Interact with them to free the [[Kunchong Hatchling]]s for [[Free From Her Clutches]].

Finally, don't forget to kill [[Karanosh]], an elite kunchong. She spawns in front of the entrance to the [[Heart of Fear]] along the path and patrols to the north. She drops the [[Enormous Kunchong Mandibles]] which will start the "hidden" daily quest: [[The Matriarch's Maw]]. See that article for more information.
