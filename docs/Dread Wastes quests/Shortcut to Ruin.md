==Objectives==
Kill Vess-Guard Na'kal outside the [[Heart of Fear]].
*[[Vess-Guard Na'kal]] slain {{co|39.3|31.0|Dread Wastes}}

==Description==
There is a champion among the loyalists, Vess-Guard Na'kal, whose strength comes not from experience or development, but from genetic modification. He was meant to be an example of the future of mantid - the sick idea that we can be born strong, without earning it.

He's a mockery of my work! Gene augmentation was meant for mature, post-swarm veterans ONLY!

End him. Perhaps it will serve as a lesson to Grand Empress Shek'zeer that taking shortcuts leads to ruin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
I will not see my work used as a crutch to prop up the unworthy!

==Completion==
My enhancements are tools for experienced warriors. Not toys for these fool children!

==Notes==
Pick up all of the other dailies offered, then speak with Kil'ruk for a trip to the area. Make sure to use the landing ability to take out as many mantid as possible!

Get started north of the entrance to the [[Heart of Fear]], killing [[Shek'zeer Bladesworn]] (among others) for [[Culling the Swarm]] and killing [[Shek'zeer Needler]]s specifically for their [[Needler Wings]] for [[Wing Clip (quest)]]. There are four building entrances with steps leading downward and inward in the area that lead to the feeders for [[Sampling the Empire's Finest]]. The building entrances are marked on the map below, but the feeders themselves have their coordinates listed on the Sampling quest article. Also in the immediate vicinity of the eastern feeder entrance is [[Vess-Guard Na'kal]], who is the target of [[Shortcut to Ruin]].

Crossing southeast over the trail to the center of the [[Clutches of Shek'zeer]] are the elite [[Dread Kunchong]], being manipulated by [[Shek'zeer Manipulator]]s. Get within 20 yards of the kunchong and use the [[Sonic Disruption Fork]] to have the kunchong turn on any nearby manipulators and vastly weaken it. To get credit for the quest, more than 50% of the damage to the mobs must be dealt by the adventurer and not by any NPCs. Kunchong Cages are also in the area. Interact with them to free the [[Kunchong Hatchling]]s for [[Free From Her Clutches]].

Finally, don't forget to kill [[Karanosh]], an elite kunchong with 2,363,000 health. She spawns in front of the entrance to the [[Heart of Fear]] along the path and patrols to the north. She drops the [[Enormous Kunchong Mandibles]] which will start the "hidden" daily quest: [[The Matriarch's Maw]]. See that article for more information.
