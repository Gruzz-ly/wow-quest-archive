==Description==
"Rending daggers of the great ones shall be bound with WOOD and SHADE." Hmm.

I've learned a lot about the Kor'thik mantid in my time here. I know that they maintain shrines within their settlement, [[Kor'vess]].

One is a heartroot of the very tree that they inhabit. The other is a dark pillar, connecting them with their queen.

These shrines are the wood and shade. If my predictions are right... the daggers should react in their presence.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Lya looks concerned.>

==Completion==
<Name>, look! The daggers - they've bound together, into a forked blade.

We are on the right track. I knew this wasn't a beer recipe.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Bound With Wood]] and [[Kor'thik Aggression]] before heading out.

Head southwest. Treant corpses litter the ground between the brewgarden and [[Kor'vess]]. Start killing any [[Kor'thik swarm]] mantid, including [[Kor'thik Battlesinger|battlesingers]], [[Kor'thik Chitinel|chitinels]], and [[Kor'thik Havoc|havocs]]. Don't kill all the mantid before finding the two objects inside the tree for Wood and Shade, however, as the entrances are guarded by more mantid. The Mark of the Empress is inside the east entrance, while the Heartroot is inside the north entrance. Merely getting close to the objects is enough for quest credit.
