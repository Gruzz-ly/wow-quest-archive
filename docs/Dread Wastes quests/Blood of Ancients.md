==Objectives==
Obtain a Chunk of Solidified Amber.
*[[Chunk of Solidified Amber]] {{co|30.2|30.6|Dread Wastes}}

==Description==
Lya and I agree on one thing - "Blood of Ancients" is almost certainly the sap from the great trees of the area. I should know - I brew with the stuff all the time.

The most ancient tree of all is the one that [[Grand Empress Shek'zeer]] calls her home - now known as the [[Heart of Fear]]. Find some amber from that tree, and our brew should be complete.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Any luck?

==Completion==
That should do it! Recipe - complete.

Now let's see how this beer tastes.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Fires and Fears of Old]] before heading out.

Run southwest through [[Rikkilea]] to the ''north side'' of the [[Heart of Fear]]. On the northwest side of the tree is a chunk of Solidifed Amber in front of an Enormous Landslide blocking a cave. Loot the amber, then interact with the landslide, summoning three [[Rikkitun Chanter]]s that cast the Incantation of the Rikkitun to clear it, much like how they lifted the [[Motherseed]]s in [[Great Vessel of Salvation]]. This is the [[Amber Hibernal]].

See Fires and Fears of Old for more information about what happens inside. Run back to [[Sunset Brewgarden]] to turn in.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Sapmaster Vu|Hmm...}}
:{{text|say|Sapmaster Vu|Yeah. This is pretty horrible.}}
:{{text|say|Sapmaster Vu|I think I'll call it... Dreadbrew. You want to try some, Lya?}}
:''She declines.''
:{{text|say|Sapmaster Vu|Very well. How about you, Olon?}}
:{{text|yell|Olon|YEAH! BEEEEEER!!!}}
:{{text|say|Sapmaster Vu|Thank you for your help, <name>. We may not have made the best brew, but we had quite an adventure.}}
:{{text|say|Sapmaster Vu|Feel free to take some brew from this keg whenever you're feeling adventurous.}}

Be adventurous and snag a [[Mug of Dreadbrew]] from the keg:
:{{text|say|Han Stormstout|...}}
He's alive! It seems that contrary to what [[Chen Stormstout|Chen]] thought, the suspended animation qualities of amber don't just work on [[mantid]]. Speak to him:
:<Han is encased in a tomb of amber.>
:{{gossip|<Pour some of the Dreadbrew onto Han's amber, just to see what happens.>}}
:''The amber instantly liquefies and dissolves, releasing Han.''
:{{text|yell|Han Stormstout|AAAAAHHHHH!}}
:{{text|say|Han Stormstout|AAAAAHHHHH!}}
:{{text|say|Han Stormstout|What happened?  Last I remember I was...}}
:{{text|say|Han Stormstout|Ugh, what did you pour on me?  It's disgusting!}}
:{{text|say|Han Stormstout|Gotta calm down now... a little confused... just need to focus.}}
:{{text|say|Han Stormstout|W-whoa... what's that thing?  Do you want to fight!?  Why am I so dizzy?  I'm going to... going to...}}
:''He throws up.''
:{{text|yell|Han Stormstout|WHHARRGLBLRRGLBRGL}}
:''Han falls asleep where he stands.''

Leave and come back later to find Han sitting by the cliff edge, as Chen and [[Mama Stormstout|Mama]] talk nearby.

This quest completes the "Taste of Amber" portion of [[Dread Haste Makes Dread Waste]].
