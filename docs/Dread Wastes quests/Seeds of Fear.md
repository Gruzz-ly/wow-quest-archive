'''Seeds of Fear''' is a repeatable quest for the purpose of gaining reputation with [[The Klaxxi]]. There is no maximum reputation restriction.

==Objectives==
Bring [[Dread Amber Shards]] to [[Ambersmith Zikk]] in [[Klaxxi'vess]].
* Dread Amber Shards (5)

==Progress==
Some of the corrupted kypari were shattered during the swarm's horrid march, casting slivers of sha-infested amber across the land.

Bring me any that you find in your travels, so that they may be disposed of properly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*23,600 [[XP]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Completion==
As long as these shards blanket the land, our home will be a place of fear and death.

==Notes==
Dread Amber Shards only drop from mobs that are located in [[Dread Wastes]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 5.1.0|note=Now requires 5 Dread Amber Shards, down from 20.}}
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
