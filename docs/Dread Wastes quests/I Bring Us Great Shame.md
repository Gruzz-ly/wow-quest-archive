==Description==
I have failed my fellow brewers.

I took some supplies out to the clearing, east of our tree... and I left them there. Now, with the [[sha]] corrupting the land, and the [[mantid]] on the prowl, it is too dangerous for me to bring them back.

If you would help me look for them, perhaps I could regain some of my lost honor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find them? Can it be?

==Completion==
You have brought me joy, traveler.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Daggers of the Great Ones]], [[Bound With Shade]], and [[Rending Daggers]] before heading out.

Circle around the tree to the southeast, killing mushan along the way for teeth. Any [[Sha-Haunted Rodent]]s are worth 2 Shade units and have a nominal amount of health, but don't go out of the way to kill them.

The mugs are immediately to the east of [[Fear Clutch]] on the [[Horrid March]] in a big pile on a rock. The keg is on the opposite side of the Horrid March immediately to the south of the entrance of the [[Amber Vault]], not far from [[Chen Stormstout]], who offers his next quest: [[Evie Stormstout (quest)]]. A few yards further southeast are the Lost Picnic Supplies next to a sha-corrupted tree.

Groups of 3-4 [[Nagging Dreadling]]s litter the area and can be easily taken out with a few AoE spells for 3 Shade units each. [[Dread Lurker]]s are worth 10 Shade units each, but beware of their Dread Claw attack!

On the [[Horrid March]] south of the tree, [[Kz'Kzik]] spawns next to the catapult just south of the tree, and [[Ilikkax]] is to the southwest in the [[Fear Clutch]].
