Find {{NPC||Han Stormstout}} in the [[Morrowchamber]] beneath [[Kor'vess]].
*Find Han Stormstout {{co|43.8|16.7|Dread Wastes}}

==Description==
There will be time for mourning later. For now, there are other Stormstouts to be found.

They say that Han Stormstout was last seen exploring Kor'vess. I suspect he headed into that mantid burrow, just across the way.

You should meet me down there, <name>. I don't doubt that I can handle a few mantid by myself... but I'd feel better with you by my side.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 XP

==Progress==
I think I see someone over there, but I can't seem to get across these amber beams.

==Completion==
First Evie, now Han.

I was too late again.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|[[Evie Stormstout|She]] looked like [[Li Li]].}}
:''He takes off to the southwest.''
Follow him into the Morrow Chamber, where great beams of amber divide up the chamber. Han is encased in a chunk of amber directly opposite Han in the central room. It is possible, if lucky, to jump over the beams and have the knockback launch in the direction of motion, but otherwise, go to a side room on either side and duck under the beam once it's more than a few yards off the ground on the ramp.

On the far side of the room, interact with the amber and then get back to Chen.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Another one... lost.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|He may never know the peace of returning to the earth... but at least he went out fighting.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|Come on. There is nothing more to be done here.}}
:{{text|say|Chen Stormstout|I am going on ahead. They say [[Mama Stormstout]] is still out there somewhere.}}

Mama Stormstout is found later in the Sunset Brewgarden storyline, specifically during [[Fires and Fears of Old]].

==Progression==
{{Sunset Brewgarden}}
