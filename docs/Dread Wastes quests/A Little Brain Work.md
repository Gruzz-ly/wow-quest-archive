==Objectives==
Collect 3 Amber-Encrusted Brains from Ik'thik Amberstingers.
*[[Amber-Encrusted Brain]] (3)
*[[Sonic Emitter]] (provided)

==Description==
Far to the south, the swarm breeds weapons of destruction - enormous, nearly unbreakable amber scorpions.

Like all other creatures, they are subject to manipulation, but unlike other creatures, they have not yet submitted to my mind control.

It appears that further research is necessary before I can dominate them for our own purposes.

I must study their brains, and you must retrieve some specimens for me.

Take this sonic emitter. I have found it to be quite effective against the beasts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
They continue to resist my sonic manipulation. I must understand why.

==Completion==
My my, this is interesting indeed. They are unlike any other brains I have seen.

I will study these carefully.

==Notes==
Fly to the southeast part of the zone, south of the [[Lake of Stars]] to the [[Chittering Coast]]. [[Ik'thik Amberstinger]]s are level 90 elite [[scorpid]] with 787,000 health. Land some distance away form one and use the [[Sonic Emitter]] while it's targeted to weaken it down to a normal level 90 with 393,000 health, then kill it and loot the [[Amber-Encrusted Brain]] from it. Don't forget to kill the mantid in the area for [[Bad Genes]] either.

Wrap up all of the other dailies in the area before heading back to [[Klaxxi'vess]].
