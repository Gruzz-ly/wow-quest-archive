==Objectives==
Kill 6 Zan'thik Impalers and 6 Zan'thik Manipulators in [[Zan'vess]].
*[[Zan'thik Impaler]] slain (6)
*[[Zan'thik Manipulator]] slain (6)

==Description==
The warriors of Zan'vess are some of the most feared and respected in the empire, for good reason.

Impalers are unmatched in their mastery of the polearm - no doubt Malik trained among the Zan'thik in his time. Their manipulators command terrifying sonic power with the ease and subtlety of a breath.

Both will need to be dealt with.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Put their pride to the test.

==Completion==
I will admit, Wakener, I am impressed.

==Notes==
Head southwest off the mainland to [[Zan'vess]]. Get started killing mantid. And the named, [[Vess-Guard Vik'az]], who patrols the housing complex center of the island just south of the kypari tree itself. And the [[kypari worm]]s, looking for [[Kyparite Shards]]. And looting the Dreadspore Bulbs on the ground, mindful of the [[Haunt of Fear|Haunts of Fear]] that may come out or any of the other random debuffs... And killing the [[Thought-Bound Miner]]s for their [[Zan'thik Shackles]]. And testing out [[Korven's Experimental Grenades]] on the [[Zan'thik Amberhusk]]s on the western side of the island.

Finally, don't forget to kill [[Kypa'rak]] and loot the [[Massive Kyparite Core]] from its corpse, which starts [[Kypa'rak's Core]], the "hidden" daily of Zan'vess.
