== Description ==
The rest of the freed paragons are scattered around the Heart of Fear, fighting off the mantid swarm. They may need your help!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|24|72}}

== Progress ==
Klaxxi'vess must not fall.

== Completion ==
The siege is broken, for now.

== Notes ==
North, south, and just east of the entrance to the [[Heart of Fear]] are the spawn locations of the three named mobs. Keep an eye out for a bossemote announcing that one of the three has entered the battlefield, go find it and help the three paragons nearby kill it, then go back to killing trash.

[[Korven the Prime]], [[Skeer the Bloodseeker]], and [[Rik'kal the Dissector]] can be seen fighting against Akkolon.

[[Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver]], [[Xaril the Poisoned Mind]], and [[Kaz'tik the Manipulator]], who is controlling [[Kovok]], can be seen fighting against Shox'tik.

[[Hisek the Swarmkeeper]], [[Ka'roz the Locust]], and [[Iyyokuk the Lucid]] can be seen fighting against the Manifestation of Terror.

Return to Kil'ruk at Klaxxi'vess upon completion.
