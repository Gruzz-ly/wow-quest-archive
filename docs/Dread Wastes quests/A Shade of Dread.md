==Objectives==
Collect 8 Dreadshade.
*[[Dreadshade]] (8)

==Description==
The last ingredient is perhaps the deadliest.

The dreadshade flower grows all along these hills.

It is by eating these poisonous plants that the local wildlife has become so venomous.

A single drop of dreadshade nectar can stop a [[kunchong]]'s heart.

Go and bring me some of these flowers. Do not be tempted to taste them.

You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40|}} (or {{cost|19|84|50}} at max level)
*236,000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Sometimes, the most beautiful things are also the most dangerous.

==Completion==
Many would not know the value of what you hold.

You have done well, Wakener.
