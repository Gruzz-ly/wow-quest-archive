==Objectives==
Travel to [[Klaxxi'vess]] at the center of the [[Dread Wastes]]. You may speak with [[Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver]] in the [[Terrace of Gurthan]] for a ride, or travel on your own.
*Travel to Klaxxi Hub

==Description==
I must report to the [[Klaxxi]]. They would not have woken me unless the situation were dire.

You have not been entirely useless. For that, I will spare your life.

The council may even find a use for you.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 429 necks|Gurthan Locket|Council Choker|Swarmborn Necklace|Kil'ruk's Pendant|Sacred Stone Amulet}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Completion==
This is a sacred meeting place for the Klaxxi.

It would be wise of you to let me do the talking.

==Notes==
Speak with Kil'ruk again:
:If you are so curious about the mantid, I will tell you more on the way to Klaxxi'vess.
:Otherwise, leave me to my work.
:{{gossip|''Take me to Klaxxi'vess.''}}

:''Kil'ruk picks up the adventurer and starts flying westward.''
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|I am Kil'ruk, a warrior from an era long passed.}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|In my time, this was a mogu stronghold. It was my honor to paint the walls with their blood.}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|For my deeds, I was named a Paragon. A hero to be preserved in amber for a time when the empire would need... correcting.}}
:''Flying by Kypari Ik.''
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|Wakener, what [[sha|power]] is this that burns our land and corrupts our trees?}}
:''Getting close to the [[Heart of Fear]].''
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|[[Heart of Fear|The palace]]! This is... not our way. I see why the [[Klaxxi]] have been forced to act.}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|They are a council of our wisest cultural leaders. They serve to check the power of the Empress.}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|Should the Emperess ever fall to corruption or endanger our civilization, the Klaxxi are sworn to unseat her.}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|There are others like me. Paragons of each era, frozen in time and buried safely beyond the whispers of the Empress.}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|We answer only to the council. And we rest only when their will is done.}}

This quest completes the "Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver" criterion of [[Amber is the Color of My Energy]].

On complete:
:{{text|say|Klaxxi'va Vor|Wind-Reaver. You have awakened. What of Klaxxi'va Tik?}}
:{{text|say|Klaxxi'va Set|And what is this filth you've brought to our sanctuary?}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|The Klaxxi'va you sent has fallen to an adjunct of Her majesty.}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|This... "filth" defeated the adjunct and saw to my Wakening.}}
:{{text|say|Klaxxi'va Set|We do not need help from the lesser races! Dispose of it!}}
:{{text|say|Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|Right away, Klaxxi'va.}}
:{{text|say|Klaxxi'va Vor|No.}}
:{{text|say|Klaxxi'va Vor|The Wakener may prove useful. One way or another.}}
:{{text|say|Klaxxi'va Set|As fodder for the swarm, perhaps!}}

Up next: [[The Dread Clutches]] and [[Not Fit to Swarm]] from [[Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver|Kil'ruk]], [[Dead Zone]] from [[Kor'ik]], and [[Amber Arms]] from [[Ambersmith Zikk]]
