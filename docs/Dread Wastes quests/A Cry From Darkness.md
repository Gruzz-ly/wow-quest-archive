==Objectives==
[[File:Qi'tar the Deathcaller.jpg|thumb|[[Qi'tar the Deathcaller]].]]
Slay the corrupted paragon at [[Kypari Vor]].
*[[Qi'tar the Deathcaller]] slain {{co|59.4|18.4|Dread Wastes}}

==Description==
So, you survived the imperial clutches. You are... resilient.

The Klaxxi hear another [[paragon]] to the north, among the sha-scorched roots of Kypari Vor.

This one cries out in terror and agony. It cannot be saved.

The Klaxxi want him put down. Go and defeat him or do not return here.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|
|Band of Channeled Whispers
|Ring of Unspeakable Nightmares
|Band of Sudden Dreams
|Seal of the Paragon Wakened
|Clutch-Keeper Seal}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
The order stands. Slay the fallen paragon.

==Completion==
What?! How did you...

The Deathcaller was a legendary hero. He must not have been fully wakened.

You are fortunate.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Dreadsworn]], [[Citizens of a New Empire]], and [[Concentrated Fear]] before heading out.

Head northeast to [[Kypari Vor]] to get started killing dreadsworn, killing fear-shapers for amber foci, picking up eggs, and taking out [[Qi'tar the Deathcaller]].

This quest completes "The First Paragons" portion of [[Dread Haste Makes Dread Waste]].
