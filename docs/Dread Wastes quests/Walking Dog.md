==Description==
Dog ain't my "pet." He's a member of this crew, and my best friend. Saved my life more than once, you know.

But I'm gettin' too old to walk him anymore, and he still needs his exercise. Take Dog for a trip around the shelf for me, would ya?

He loves to swim through the hot geysers just southeast of the shallows.

He absolutely has to... er... "leave his mark" on the dead whale at the far western edge of the shelf.

Oh, and he'll want to visit our old shipwreck, too. He likes to reminisce.

==Progress==
Dog deserves all the freedom the sea has to offer him - I've tried to set him free, but he won't go.

Best we can do anymore is take him out for walks now and then.

==Completion==
How did it go? I hope he didn't cause too much trouble!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Old Age and Treachery]], [[On the Crab]], and [[Shark Week]] before heading out.

Out in the open water, summon [[Dog (Dread Wastes)|Dog]] using [[Dog's Whistle]]. Dog immediately turns around and offers [[Dog Food]], so accept it.

The Silt Vents are on the northeast end of the Shelf of Mazu, almost due west from [[Soggy's Gamble]].
:{{text|emote|Dog swims excitedly through the vents of warm water.}}
The [[Wreck of the Mist-Hopper]] is just southwest of the silt vents.
:{{text|emote|Dog rubs against the prow of the Mist-Hopper and whimpers.}}
On deck, forward, is Soggy's Footlocker. Loot the [[Sealed Charter Tube]] out of it.

Finally, southwest, just offshore of [[Zan'vess]], is the whale corpse.
:{{text|emote|Dog looks around cautiously before leaving his mark on the whale corpse.}}
Crab pots are all over the seafloor, and merely interacting with them is enough to get them up to the surface. Kill [[Longfin Thresher]]s, loot their [[Thresher Jaw]]s, and extract [[Thresher Teeth]] from them, 22-30 at a time. Carefully. Last but not least, kill [[Rockshell Snapclaw]]s so Dog can eat them.
