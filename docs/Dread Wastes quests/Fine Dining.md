==Objectives==
Collect 8 Clacker Tails.
*[[Clacker Tail]] (8)

==Description==
In my living years, I was the greatest warrior of the swarm.

Help me regain my strength, and I shall show you.

I smell the salt sea nearby, and where you can find the sea, you will find briny clackers.

Bring me their tails. I must feast upon their flesh.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
I have much work to do. The sooner I can fight, the sooner I can return to the Council.

==Completion==
Excellent. This shall give me the strength to vanquish my foes.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Strange Appetite]] and [[A Bloody Delight]] before heading out.

Exit the cave back into the [[Muckscale Shallows]]. While in the area, Skeer provides the Mark of Skeer, granting water breathing at 125% swim speed. Start killing [[makura]] and [[remora]], and gathering starfish from the seabed and rocks underwater. The makura are neutral, and so are [[Bitterwater Crab]]s, so make sure the right mobs are getting killed. Tails drop from roughly every other clacker, and remora drop 6-15 units of blood each, averaging around 8. Gather everything up, then head back.
