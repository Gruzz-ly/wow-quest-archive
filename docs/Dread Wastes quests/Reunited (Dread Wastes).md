*Find [[Kovok|Kaz'tik's greatest weapon]]

==Description==
You look at me and see I am no great warrior. Why was I chosen to be a Paragon? Not all weapons can be seen, Wakener. One should not judge by appearance alone.

Before I explain further, I need to know that you are trustworthy.

Something precious to me was hidden at the time of my preservation. I am nothing without it.

Defend me as I unearth my greatest weapon, and you will have my trust.

==Progress==

==Completion==
[[Kovok]] is just as impressive as the last time I saw him. He will ensure great victories for the Klaxxi.

==Notes==
This is an escort. [[Kaz'tik the Manipulator|Kaz'tik]] is a friendly level 90 [[mantid]] with 315,000 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Holy Nova|causes an explosion of holy light around the caster, causing 873 to 879 Holy damage to all enemy targets within 10 yards and healing all party members within 10 yards for 360 to 440. These effects cause no threat.|notes=Instant|Hits for ~7800 Holy, heals for ~6600 Holy.}}
*{{abilities|Holy Smite|Smites an enemy, inflicting Holy damage.|notes=2.5 sec cast. Hits for ~11,000 Holy.|range=40}}
*{{abilities|Penance|Launches a volley of holy light at the target, causing 296 to 344 Holy damage to an enemy every 1 sec for 3 sec}}
*{{abilities|Power Word: Shield}}

There are three scripted spawns of two level 90 [[saurok]] each. Both saurok have the standard level-90 health of 393,000 each. In addition, the regular spawns in the area (including giants with ~787,000 health!) will wander along the path. Kaz'tik does not have a massive aggro radius, but he will detour to attack any mobs that get within 15 yards of him. The path starts at his spawn location on the big island on the east side of the muck, takes the south exit, and then runs more or less due south three islands away.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Kaz'tik the Manipulator|We will have to work quickly, Wakener. This area is not safe.}}

Leaving the first island:
:{{text|say|Kaz'tik the Manipulator|Prepare for battle, Wakener!}}

Exiting combat:
:{{text|whisper|Kaz'tik the Manipulator|Your mind is strong, Wakener. Even now I struggle to communicate with you. Controlling you would be near impossible...}}

Attack wave two:
:{{text|say|Kaz'tik the Manipulator|Attackers approach!}}

Exiting combat:
:{{text|whisper|Kaz'tik the Manipulator|Your thoughts intrigue me. There is purpose to your actions. Your complexity is impressive.}}

Landing on the third island:
:{{text|say|Kaz'tik the Manipulator|Prepare for battle, Wakener!}}

Exiting combat:
:{{text|whisper|Kaz'tik the Manipulator|Your intelligence will come in handy almost as much as your skill for battle. I see much potential in a mind like yours, Wakener.}}

Escort complete:
:{{text|say|Kaz'tik the Manipulator|We're here. With this weapon we will lay waste to the Empresses' army!}}
:''[[Kovok]], a tiny [[kunchong]], comes out of the ground.''
:{{text|say|Kaz'tik the Manipulator|Isn't he magnificent?!}}
:{{text|say|Kaz'tik the Manipulator|Come to me, Kovok.}}
