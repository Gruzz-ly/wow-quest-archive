Slay 17 Kor'thik Mantid at [[Kor'vess]].
*Kor'thik Mantid slain (17)

==Description==
I'm no brewer - just looking at all those heaps of ingredients makes my head spin. Just put the brew in front of me when it's finished, thank you.

No, I'm here to make sure that the brewers don't get cut in half while they're trying to make that perfect brew. It's not an easy job.

The Kor'thik mantid across this basin have been attacking us nightly. If you're already heading over there, why don't you return the favor and attack a few of them?

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Can't stand those mantid.

==Completion==
You've got the makings of a find brewgarden guard, <race>. Let me know if you ever get tired of the whole "<class>" thing.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Wood and Shade]] and [[Bound With Wood]] before heading out.

Head southwest. Treant corpses litter the ground between the brewgarden and [[Kor'vess]]. Start killing any [[Kor'thik swarm]] mantid, including [[Kor'thik Battlesinger|battlesingers]], [[Kor'thik Chitinel|chitinels]], and [[Kor'thik Havoc|havocs]]. Don't kill all the mantid before finding the two objects inside the tree for Wood and Shade, however, as the entrances are guarded by more mantid. The Mark of the Empress is inside the east entrance, while the Heartroot is inside the north entrance. Merely getting close to the objects is enough for quest credit.
