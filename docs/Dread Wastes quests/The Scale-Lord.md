==Objectives==
Kill the Mistblade Scale-Lord.
*[[Mistblade Scale-Lord]] slain {{co|66.4|66.1|Dread Wastes}}

==Description==
The saurok at the [[Lake of Stars]] take their orders from their Scale-Lord, a vicious, merciless leader who guards his territory fiercely.

If we can eliminate this leader, then we can gain access to the enormous amber lode beneath the lake.

Go. Their leader gives his orders from his underground dwelling, at the southern edge of the lake.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
Good. I am glad to hear that he is dead.

==Notes==
Head southeast to the [[Lake of Stars]]. The Scale-Lord is in the same [[Mistblade Den]] he was earlier for [[Amber Is Life]], recovering [[Korven the Prime]] during the [[Dread Wastes storyline]]. Don't forget to kill the regular saurok for [[Mistblade Destruction]] too. Wrap up the other dailies in the southwest part of the zone before heading back to [[Klaxxi'vess]].
