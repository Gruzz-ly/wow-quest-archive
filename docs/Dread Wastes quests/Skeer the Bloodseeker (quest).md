==Objectives==
Awaken Skeer the Bloodseeker in [[Muckscale Grotto|the underwater cave]].
*[[Skeer the Bloodseeker]] awakened {{co|25.7|50.3|Dread Wastes}}

==Description==
Our efforts to secure [[Briny Muck|the shallows]] before [[Zan'vess]] have paid off.

We have spotted another paragon buried in amber, hidden in the waters to the southwest.

Adding another paragon to our numbers is vital. Another champion from ages past could turn the tide in our favor.

I would go immediately, but unfortunately, I am needed here.

Since you are already a Wakener, you can carry out this task in my stead.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Completion==
The hunger... they said it would be fierce, but I did not expect anything like this.

It is strange to feel so... weak.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Zan'thik Dig]] before heading out. These quests take place in different locations, so choose one to do first.

Head to the southwest corner of the mainland, southwest of the [[Heart of Fear]]. Just offshore in the [[Muckscale Shallows]] at {{co|25.7|54.5|Dread Wastes}} is an underwater cave entrance. Dive in to reach the [[Muckscale Grotto]]. Inside are a few [[Muckscale Skinflayer]]s and the Ancient Amber Chunk. Clear out the saurok, then interact with the amber chunk:
:{{text|say|Skeer the Bloodseeker has returned! Unnngghhh...}}
:{{text|say|Skeer the Bloodseeker|Yes, Klaxxi'va. What does the Council command? Skeer hears. Skeer obeys.}}
:{{text|say|Skeer the Bloodseeker|It appears that Empress Shek'zeer has let our empire fall into chaos. This we must address. But first, I must regain my strength.}}
Speak to him again to turn in.
