==Objectives==
[[File:Amber Collector.jpg|thumb|Amber Collector]]
Gather 7 Amber-Filled Jars from the Amber Collectors on the [[Stinging Trail]].
*[[Amber-Filled Jar]] (7)

==Description==
It is a crime to harvest the young trees, but a much bigger crime to waste the amber.

Young amber is not as strong, but the Klaxxi need it to continue the fight. We will bring them more and they will sing my praises!

Gather the young amber. We will store it until it is aged and can be eaten.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 429 neckpieces|Amberglow Locket|Amberglow Choker|Amberglow Necklace|Amberglow Pendant|Amberglow Amulet}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
I would go with you to gather amber, but my talents are more useful here.

==Completion==
Even this raw amber will be of use. We can't afford to be picky in times like these.

The Klaxxi'va will be grateful.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Crime and Punishment]] before heading out.

The jars are guarded by [[Ik'thik Harvester]], which need to be killed.
