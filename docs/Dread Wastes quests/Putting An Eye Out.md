==Objectives==
Collect 1 Pristine [[Mire Beast]] Eye.
*[[Pristine Mire Beast Eye]]

==Description==
Ah! Wakener! You must help me! (You will help me, or else I will help myself to you!)

I need more materials for my experiments, yes yes! (Blood and guts, hearts and brains, tongues and eyes, eyes, eyes!)

To the west, I have seen [[mistlurker|creatures of mist and fog]]. They possess such big, round, wonderful globes! Big for seeing, round and unblinking!

Go now, little Wakener. Bring me back a single pristine eye!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+130 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Ooooh, what wonderful, tasty parts have you brought me?

==Completion==
Yes, yes! Wonderful! Oh, so delicious!

==Notes==
Head northeast to the [[Terrace of Gurthan]]. [[Mire Beast]]s can be found either at the northeast end of the ruins by the two small ponds, or to the south at the [[Forgotten Mire]]. Kill them until an eye drops. The eye is [[party loot]], so grouping up will help for this quest, as every member of the party can loot a copy of the eye when it finally drops.
