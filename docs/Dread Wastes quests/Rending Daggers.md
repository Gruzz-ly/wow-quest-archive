*[[Blade of Ilikkax]] {{co|50.8|21.1|Dread Wastes}}

==Description==
Forget about them, and forget their BREW. We've got real work to do.

The scroll mentions "rending daggers of the great ones". I've got a feeling I know where to find them.

A pair of [[mantid]] lieutenants patrol the [[Horrid March]], to the south. Each one carries a ceremonial dagger.

Bring those daggers back here, <name>. We may be on the brink of something big.

==Progress==
I think I'm starting to understand the next few lines of this prophecy, <name>.

Do you have the daggers yet?

==Completion==
These daggers, look!

<Lya holds the blades hilt-to-hilt.>

They were built to fit together! But how to join them...?

==Notes==
Pick up [[I Bring Us Great Shame]], [[Daggers of the Great Ones]], and [[Bound With Shade]] before heading out.

Circle around the tree to the southeast, killing mushan along the way for teeth. Any [[Sha-Haunted Rodent]]s are worth 2 Shade units and have a nominal amount of health, but don't go out of the way to kill them.

The mugs are immediately to the east of [[Fear Clutch]] on the [[Horrid March]] in a big pile on a rock. The keg is on the opposite side of the Horrid March immediately to the south of the entrance of the [[Amber Vault]], not far from [[Chen Stormstout]], who offers his next quest: [[Evie Stormstout (quest)]]. A few yards further southeast are the Lost Picnic Supplies next to a sha-corrupted tree.

Groups of 3-4 [[Nagging Dreadling]]s litter the area and can be easily taken out with a few AoE spells for 3 Shade units each. [[Dread Lurker]]s are worth 10 Shade units each, but beware of their Dread Claw attack!

On the [[Horrid March]] south of the tree, [[Kz'Kzik]] spawns next to the catapult just south of the tree, and [[Ilikkax]] is to the southwest in the [[Fear Clutch]].
