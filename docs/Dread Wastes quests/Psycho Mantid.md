==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Adjunct Kree'zot.jpg|Adjunct Kree'zot|A mantid wielding the power of sha like a weapon? How can this be?}}
Investigate the mantid infighting at the [[Terrace of Gurthan]].
*[[Adjunct Kree'zot]] slain {{co|73.5|27.4|Dread Wastes}}

==Description==
You aren't going to believe what I saw! Two mantid fighting each other, whipping some serious magic back and forth.

One of them didn't look like any mantid I've ever seen. Completely different color and dress to him, like some kind of... oracle or something. The other one was a total psycho, splashing sha energy around like it was a keg of Stormstout Special.

Look, I gotta get back to my post, but those two are still fighting in the cave behind me and I have a feeling it's a big deal. Check it out?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
The empress... is... misguided.

==Completion==
<This mantid is severely wounded. He barely manages to choke forth his words between wheezing gasps for breath.>

Hold, <race>...

We are... not your enemy.

==Notes and trivia==
*The name of the quest might be a reference to the character {{Wp|Psycho Mantis}} from the {{Wp|Metal Gear}} franchise.

Run northeast. Hidden in a nook are [[Klaxxi'va Tik]] and [[Adjunct Kree'zot]], staring each other down, both heavily wounded.
:{{text|say|Adjunct Kree'zot|The Klaxxi have betrayed her majesty. Your corpses will be strung from the palace walls for this.}}
:{{text|say|Klaxxi'va Tik|It is... the empress who has betrayed... our people...}}
:{{text|say|Adjunct Kree'zot|How DARE you question her will!}}

Aggro Kree'zot:
:{{text|say|Adjunct Kree'zot|What's this?! Now they come over the wall to oppose us? The fools!}}

Kill Kree'zot:
