==Objectives==
Gather 4 Dread Amber Foci from [[Vor'thik Fear-Shaper]]s at [[Kypari Vor]].
*[[Dread Amber Focus]] (4)

==Description==
Amber is power. It brings life.

This... dread amber you have brought me has been twisted. It is concentrated fear.

The Vor'thik know this well. Their [[kypari]] has been completely engulfed by the [[sha]], and they use the dread amber to quicken their own swarmborn.

Bring me the crystals used by the Vor'thik fear-shapers in their rituals. The [[Klaxxi]] will study them and decide on a protocol for disposal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Klaxxi]]

==Progress==
Do you have the crystals?

==Completion==
What would happen, I wonder, if you ate one? What would it do to your soft, pink insides?

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Dreadsworn]], [[Citizens of a New Empire]], and [[A Cry From Darkness]] before heading out.

Head northeast to [[Kypari Vor]] to get started killing dreadsworn, killing fear-shapers for amber foci, picking up eggs, and taking out [[Qi'tar the Deathcaller]].
