==Objectives==
[[File:Marksman Lann.jpg|thumb|[[Marksman Lann]].]]
Use the Shado-Pan Rope to descend into the [[Terrace of Gurthan]] and search for the fallen [[Shado-Pan]] marksman.
*Find [[Marksman Lann]] {{co|72.6|28.7|Dread Wastes}}

==Description==
It's bad enough trying to hold off the mantid, but now we've got spiders swarming up from the ruins below.

One of my best marksmen caught a blast of webbing around his leg and got pulled straight down!

We think he's alive, but I don't have the manpower to send anyone in after him. We're stretched thin up here, <class>.

If you want to help, use the rope behind me to drop down into the ruins. You're not afraid of heights are you?

How about spiders?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The fall wasn't that bad, actually. I've always had a knack for soft landings.

That I landed on a pile of spider corpses probably helped, too.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Nope]] before heading out. Then use the rope right behind her to rappel down.

Start using the dragon cannon to burn spider eggs. It doesn't really work all that well on full-size spiders, though. Head southwest. [[Marksman Lann]] can be found in the lower level of the terrace, stuck in a web.
