==Objectives==
Meet [[Alexstrasza]] at the [[Verdant Pass]].

==Description==
[[Amirdrassil]] draws power from the [[Wellspring Temple]] in preparation for its bloom. The barrier protecting the temple will not last much longer under [[Fyrakk]]'s assault.

I have sent messengers all across [[Azeroth]] asking for reinforcements, but none have yet arrived. Something blocks their path into the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]]. For now, we must rely on the forces we have.

I ask you to travel to the Verdant Pass. If there is anyone I would have by my side, it is you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We are thankful for your arrival, <name>.

Our forces have assembled, but the odds are against us. We will only be able to hold on for so long without reinforcements. Let us hope we can draw Fyrakk's attention until the Bloom is complete.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|We must draw Fyrakk away from the temple until the Bloom is complete.}}
:{{text|say|[[Tyrande Whisperwind]]|Victory is a fleeting hope. We will not be able to hold Fyrakk's attention for long without reinforcements.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I know I ask what may seem impossible.}}
:{{text|say|[[Merithra]]|We must try. If Fyrakk reaches the heart of Amirdrassil, all of Azeroth shall burn.}}
:''They all walk and/or fly away.''

On approach in the Verdant Pass:
:{{text|say|[[Vyranoth]]|Fyrakk has entered the battle.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Good. We want him as far from the temple as possible.}}

Upon complete, [[Alexstrasza]] has new gossip:
{{book|content=
A desperate battle, a never ending war. And once more we fight together.

I had hoped Amirdrassil would herald an age of peace. Yet here we are, shedding blood once more. Will it never end?
