[[File:In and Out Scout.jpg|thumb|[[Bodwin]] and [[Igira|Igira the Cruel]] at [[Slagfell Hold]]]]

==Objectives==
Spy on the [[djaradin]] leaders in [[Slagfell Hold]].
* Spy on [[Moltenbinder]] {{co|46.2|19.2|Emerald Dream (zone)}}
* Spy on [[The Anvil (djaradin)|The Anvil]] {{co|44.6|23.9|Emerald Dream (zone)}}
* Spy on [[Igira|Igira the Cruel]] {{co|48.4|22.4|Emerald Dream (zone)}}
* [[Somnowl's Shroud]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Bodwin]] reports that [[Galok Wingslicer|Galok]] is not the only new threat to [[Eye of Ysera|the Eye]]. The djaradin forces below are led by two others--a warrior and a mage.

It is unwise to engage them directly in their own, well-established base. But I am certain they are a part of Galok's plan of attack.

Please gather more information from these djaradin leaders. We need to know how best to counteract their attacks. Bodwin can grant you stealth so that you may move unseen in the camp.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Fearless Faerie's Shroud
|Summer Soother's Wrap
|Spirited Stag's Cape
|Chartreuse Champion's Cloak
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
What have you seen?

==Completion==
<Merithra is very still. Only her eyes betray unspeakable rage.>

We will avenge our kin.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Merithra|Bodwin grants you the means to be stealthy. Use his power wisely.}}
:''Bodwin flies off.''

Slagfell Hold is an elite area, but none of the enemies have truesight, so use [[Somnowl's Shroud]] to move around quietly, and the [[Dreamy Dust]] from [[Disarm Specialist]] to sleep any errant enemies that aggro.

Moltenbinder is standing in a lava pool at the northern end of the quest area:
:{{text|say|Moltenbinder|Once our fire magic succeeds, there will be nothing to stop us from descending upon the [[Eye of Ysera]]!}}

The Anvil is at the western end of the quest area:
:{{text|say|The Anvil|Move it, weapon shapers. Igira expects perfection.}}

[[Bodwin]] and [[Igira|Igira the Cruel]] are at the eastern end of the quest area. Above is [[Rydra Scalegorger]]. Speak with Bodwin:

{{book|content=
<The owl's eyes reflect uncanny intellect.>

{{gossip|quest=|Let's see what Igira the Cruel is up to.}}}}

An [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|6BI_2emYk5U}}
:''Galok approaches Igira with three prisoners - a [[green drakonid]], [[Green dragonspawn|dragonspawn]], and [[Green dragon|dragon]] in visage form. They look at Rydra.''
:{{Text|say|Igira the Cruel|Galok. You have returned from your hunt.}}
:{{Text|say|Igira the Cruel|I trust the weapons I supplied you were effective.}}
:{{Text|say|Galok Wingslicer|<grunts>}}
:''Galok turns and strikes [[Brathia]], the dragonspawn, killing her.''
:{{Text|say|Brathia|<screams>}}
:{{Text|say|Igira the Cruel|Good.}}
:{{Text|say|Igira the Cruel|Now go.}}
:{{Text|say|Igira the Cruel|Take the Eye.}}
:{{Text|say|Igira the Cruel|But bring me any prisoners you capture.}}
:{{Text|say|Igira the Cruel|Fyrakk may want them for more... "testing."}}
:{{Text|say|Galok Wingslicer|It will be done!}}

On return, Merithra has new gossip:
:[[Amirdrassil]] must be protected.

On complete of both:
:{{text|say|Merithra|Thank you, Bodwin. Your assistance has been vital to our victory.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|And yours, <name>, as always.}}
