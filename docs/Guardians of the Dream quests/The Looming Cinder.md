'''The Looming Cinder''' concludes the second chapter of the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]], Druids of the Flame. The next chapter, Ice and Fire, starts immediately after with [[Mayhem Incarnate]].

==Objectives==
Return to [[Merithra]] at [[Amirdrassil]].

==Description==
The [[Druids of the Flame]] are nothing more than allies of convenience to [[Fyrakk]] and his ilk. Nevertheless, they present a dire threat to the well-being of Amirdrassil, to say nothing of the rest of [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]].

The victory we earned here today was hard-fought, but it only served to stem the tide. No doubt the [[Ashendir Hartwood|Prophet]] and the [[Norana Morninglight|Priestess]] have already reunited with their erstwhile allies.

We should return to Merithra. She needs to know of this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the Dream Wardens]] (+2500 reputation with [[Dream Wardens]])
*[[Plump Dreamseed]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
I am glad to see you return, <class>. Would that I could bid you a moment to rest for all of the hard work that you have done.

Unfortunately, we've no such luxury. Where one flame falters, another flares in response. Amirdrassil remains in danger.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Though it pains me to say so, I understand how these zealots have swayed so many of my people to their cause.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|The [[Kaldorei]] have suffered time after time. Tragedy after tragedy. The Druids of the Flame promise them relief. Purity. Salvation.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|But it is a lie. We cannot burn away the scars we have suffered. They will forever be a part of us.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|We must return to Amirdrassil. Our fight is not over. Not while Fyrakk yet remains to threaten all we have worked for.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Merithra|If Fyrakk's aim is to take the tree, why is he holding back?}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|And why place his troops so far from his goal?}}
:{{text|say|[[Vyranoth]]|Fyrakk craves power. The power to subjugate.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Whatever he is planning, it is a means to this end.}}
:{{text|say|[[Alexstrasza the Life-Binder]]|We must go, observe his soldiers, and learn what they are up to.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|But Queen Alexstrasza, I must--}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Fyrakk is my responsibility now.}}

This is the "Druids of the Flame" criterion of [[Defenders of the Dream (achievement)]].
