The dragon has the Dream Bolt ability. Take out 25, then head to the southwest corner of the Eye to speak with Merithra:

An [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cinematic]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|cKiYPUw34kE}}
:''Emerald Dream, exterior, day. Green dragons and fireswarm shalewings are darting around the [[Eye of Ysera]], locked in combat. [[Galok Wingslicer]], atop his mount, is hovering nearby. Having turned the tide of battle, the shalewings are fleeing, with the dragons in hot pursuit.''
:{{text|bossemote|Galok Wingslicer|Cowardly beasts! To the Eye! Obey your master!}}
:''[[Lord Itharius]] and a bunch of other green dragons fly in, blocking him from the Eye.''
:{{text|bossemote|Lord Itharius|Stand down, Galok. We have won.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Galok Wingslicer|Not while I yet live!}}
:''Galok's mount winds up a shadowflame breath attack, but Merithra dives in to intercept it.''
:{{text|bossemote|Merithra|We will suffer your evil no longer!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Galok Wingslicer|The djaradin will be your doom! We are constant as the--}}
:{{text|bossemote|Merithra|Begone!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Galok Wingslicer|<screams>}}
:''Merithra winds up a breath attack and BLASTS Galok from his mount! He screams as they both fall into the water far below. The shadowflame orb in the center of the platform explodes harmlessly, ending the assault.''

After the cutscene, the dragons are gathered around Merithra and [[Ysera]] - Lord Itharius, [[Valithria Dreamwalker]], [[Somnikus]], [[Gerithus]], and [[Theramus]].
