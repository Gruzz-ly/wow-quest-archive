'''The Bloom Begins''' begins the "A Dream of Fields and Fire" chapter of the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]].

==Objectives==
Witness [[Amirdrassil]] begin to bloom.
* Speak to [[Merithra]]

==Description==
I sense a change on the wind. Like the dawning rays of the sun. Like petals before they unfurl. A great swelling energy, right at the heart of the [[Emerald Dream]].

The Bloom. It has begun.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
A bloom so beautiful, yet it brings such dread. Can we truly prevail?

==Completion==
Amirdrassil is now at its most vulnerable. Whether it shall bloom within [[Azeroth]] as a beacon of hope... Or if it shall become a harbinger of doom.

Its fate is ours to protect. And protect it we must.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|[[Vyranoth]]|[[Fyrakk]] still assaults the [[Wellspring Temple]], but the barrier holds strong.}}
:{{text|say|[[Alexstrasza]] the Life-Binder|As long as it remains intact, the World Tree is safe.}}

Speak with Merithra again:

{{book|content=
I can feel the energy surging within Amirdrassil. It is almost... overwhelming.

{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Play Movie)}} What can you tell me about the Bloom?}}
}}

An [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cinematic]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|CJ1i-IsgFiY}}
:''Emerald Dream, exterior, day. Alexstrasza, Merithra, [[Tyrande Whisperwind]], Vyranoth, and the adventurer are under [[Amirdrassil]] at the [[Central Encampment]] looking at the [[moonwell]].''
:{{text|bossemote|Merithra|The Bloom begins. Amirdrassil draws power from the Wellspring.}}
:''The earth shakes, breaking Merithra out of her reverie.''
:{{text|bossemote|Merithra|It is weakening the barrier. Fyrakk will break through before the Bloom is complete.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Tyrande Whisperwind|We have not the strength to face Fyrakk alone. And our allies are unable to enter the Dream. Something blocks their path.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|We cannot wait for reinforcements. Fyrakk must be stopped. No matter the cost.}}

After the cutscene, the Blooming buff is given.
