==Objectives==
Speak to Merithra and prepare for [[Fyrakk]]'s attack.
*Speak to [[Merithra]]

==Description==
I hear approaching wings and smell [[shadowflame]].

[[Fyrakk]] is here.

<Merithra's anger is quiet but terrible.>

[[Gerithus]]' pain will not go unanswered.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
He left [[Amirdrassil|the tree]] alone?

Does he have another objective?

And why is he listening to that [[Druid of the Flame]]?

==Notes==
Speak with Merithra:

{{book|content=
Fyrakk approaches. Steel yourself.

{{Gossip|{{Text|rare|(Play Movie)}} I'm with you.}}}}

An in-engine cinematic plays:
{{#ev:youtube|RiN1RPX406Q}}
:''Merithra, Alexstrasza, and the adventurer are looking off in the distance as Tyrande runs up. They spot Fyrakk flying in! He lands a few yards away from them.''
:{{text|bossemote|Fyrakk|I knew you would come. Chasing fire like flittering moths.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Fyrakk|Oh, how I have longed for you to witness it, Alexstrasza.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Fyrakk|This world tree, the heart of its great power, filled with shadow and flame.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Fyrakk|But now that you and your champions have gathered... Why wait? I should just end you now!}}
:''[[Ashendir Hartwood]] flies in, shifts to his night elf form, and walks between Fyrakk and his foes, distracting Fyrakk.''
:{{text|bossemote|Ashendir Hartwood|The defeat of this treacherous queen would be a glorious battle.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Ashendir Hartwood|But the plan, Fyrakk! Remember your brilliant plan to humble, humiliate, and break them.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Ashendir Hartwood|Open the way to the temple. Then the tree will be yours!}}
:''Fyrakk lets out a frustrated roar, then prepares to take flight.''
:{{text|bossemote|Fyrakk|Yes! And once I take what is mine... my foes will perish in flames!}}
:''Fyrakk takes off, a ring of shadowflame extending out from his launch point. Ashendir shifts back to flight form and takes off after him.''
