==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Smoldering Copse]].

==Description==
[[Andi'thur]] tells me of smoke rising from a grove to the west. [[Norana Morninglight|Norana]]'s new allies are not exactly the subtle sort.

I do not care what her motivations are. I will not allow her to set another inch of this land ablaze. Ride for the western groves. However the [[Druids of the Flame]] plan to seek their so-called rebirth, we will do all we can to stop them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
Norana... You were always such a kind and quiet soul. To think that you would help spur something so foul.

<Tyrande sighs.>

There is much to be done.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Andi'thur tells me that the Druids of the Flame have claimed a grove to the west. No doubt this is where our quarry lurks.}}
:{{text|emote|Tyrande looses a sharp whistle, calling [[Ash'alah]] to her side.}}
:''Tyrande mounts Ash'alah and runs off.''
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Make haste. Every moment we delay provides the zealots another chance to spread their burning ground.}}

At the [[Viridescent Thicket]], Tyrande has new gossip:
:When [[Fandral Staghelm|Fandral]] died, I thought we had seen the last of the Druids of the Flame. These zealots seem different, somehow - though the source of their power and the threat they pose to the world are similar enough.

==Progression==
{{Druids of the Flame}}

==Patch changes==
