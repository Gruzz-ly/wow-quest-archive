Seek out [[Wild God]]s and allies within the [[Emerald Dream (zone)|Emerald Dream]].

*[[Q'onzu]]'s aid requested
*[[Elder Cassaphine]]'s aid requested

==Description==
The [[Emerald Dream]] is the home of nature's Wild Gods. We will need their strength and their power to counteract the damage that [[Fyrakk]] has brought to this realm.

The first to seek out is Goldrinn. The ancient [[wolf]] has a fondness for [[Azeroth]] and mortals, so he is sure to aid us.

Others may need more convincing.

I will meet you nearby in the Fields of Reverie, where [[dryad]]s and [[Keeper of the grove|keepers]] reside.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
We are too late. Fyrakk's forces have already begun their attack on the Dream!

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Tyrande Whisperwind]]|I will meet with the rest of the [[kaldorei]] at the base of [[Amirdrassil|the tree]]. There, we have set up the heart of our defense.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Merithra]]|Very well. We will send reinforcements to you as soon as possible.}}
:{{Text|say|Cenarius|Come, <name>. Let us seek out the others.}}
:''Tyrande and her [[Sentinel of the New Moon|Sentinels of the New Moon]] run up ahead.''

Head to the Fields of Reverie and speak with Goldrinn:
{{book|content=
:A mortal dares to walk the Dream! Always an impressive feat. And at such a difficult time: the [[Druids of the Flame]] dare to set our home ablaze!

:So little has changed here in so long, though the paths are still difficult to navigate.

:Now change is coming. Perhaps I can help you face it.

:{{Gossip|quest=|Merithra requests your aid in defending the World Tree.}}
:{{Gossip|Who are you?}}
::I am the fangs of rage. The ferocity of a cornered beast. The starving hunter on a bloodscent.

::I am the briefest, brightest moments before your death on the battlefield. The strength that only comes from insurmountable odds.

::A ghost of a god, known by many... for rage and fury do not discriminate.

::{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
}}

:{{Text|say|Goldrinn|And I answer the call of the pack! Together, we will defend the Dream and the tree!}}
:''Goldrinn runs away.''

[[File:Q'onzu.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Q'onzu]]]]
Proceed further and find Q'onzu at {{Co|65.6|70.2|Emerald Dream (zone)}} and speak with them:
{{book|content=
:What have we here? A mortal whose mere presence changes the realm?

:You are very interesting, indeed.

:{{Gossip|quest=|Merithra requests your aid in defending the World Tree.}}
:{{Gossip|Who are you?}}
::I am the cool, fresh scent in the air just before the rain. I am the face you can't quite remember.

::I am the harbinger of change. I am the reaper of consequence.

::I serve the unending flow of [[Life]], and I am the victim of its stagnation.

::Do I speak the truth, mortal? Or do I deceive you with my grandeur? I was hoping you would tell me.

::{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
}}

:{{Text|say|Q'onzu|Now why would I want to stop the Dream from changing? I think I will wait and see what happens. Try not to die, mortal.}}
:''Q'onzu flies away.''

[[File:Elder Cassaphine.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Elder Cassaphine]]]]
Turn back and enter the [[Barrows of Reverie]] at {{Co|63.4|71.5|Emerald Dream (zone)}} and speak with [[Elder Cassaphine]]:

{{book|content=
:The flowers slowly turn to flame. The petals are not consumed, but they burn brightly.

:{{Gossip|quest=|Merithra requests your aid in defending the World Tree.}}
:{{Gossip|Who are you?}}
::I am an elder dryad, one of the defenders of the Dream.

::For ages, I have protected and nurtured these groves. Yet they never seem to grow more verdant. They merely... remain. They hibernate.

::Would it matter at all if we were not here? Would these fields stay exactly as they have? Or must something dire happen for them to finally renew?

::{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
}}

:{{Text|say|Elder Cassaphine|To aid a friend... or to seek renewal?}}
:''The ground shakes.''
:{{Text|say|Elder Cassaphine|The portals are open! The flames are here!}}
:''Cassaphine runs out of the barrows.''

Follow Cassaphine back to the Fields of Reverie. The area is under attack from the [[Druids of the Flame]] and other Fyrakk's forces coming from [[Flame Portal]]s. Cenarius is present for turning in the quest.
