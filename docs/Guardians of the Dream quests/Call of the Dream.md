'''Call of the Dream''' begins the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]]. This quest will be pushed automatically to players upon release of patch 10.2.0. [[Merithra]] will start it at the [[Ancient Bough]] in [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].

If players have not already completed the [[Fury Incarnate campaign]] beginning with [[A Sentinel's Summon]] and ending with [[Raise the Alarm]], that must be completed first.

==Objectives==
Complete the "Coalition of Flames" storyline from Shandris in [[Valdrakken]], then travel to the [[Ancient Bough]] in the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].
*Complete "[[Guardians of the Dream campaign#Prelude: The Coalition of Flames|The Coalition of Flames]]" storyline from [[Shandris]]
*[[Shandris's Scouting Report]] (provided for alts)

==Description==
A [[Amirdrassil|great tree]] grows within [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]]. Soon, it will emerge in [[Azeroth]].

But before it does, we must protect it from those who would do it harm or wield its power for their own ends. We must band together and see it through its verdant birth.

Join me and the others in the Ancient Bough. Together, we will travel into the [[Emerald Dream (zone)|Emerald Dream]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}

==Completion==
Not so long ago, the World Tree was planted within the Emerald Dream. There, we have kept it safe.

Now our enemies have found their own way into the Dream. We must unite and protect it. The tree has so much promise... and potential.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|[[Merithra]]|The time for the World Tree to bloom draws near, and our enemies are gathering in the Emerald Dream. Come.}}

Head to the [[Ancient Bough]] in western [[Ohn'ahran Plains]] and find a group of characters there. In the back are five [[Sentinel of the New Moon|Sentinels of the New Moon]]. In front of them on the right side are [[Kalecgos]], [[Archmage Khadgar]], and [[Khanam Matra Sarest]], while on the left side is [[Ysera]]. In front of the Dream portal are [[Merithra]], [[Alexstrasza]], [[Vyranoth]], and [[Tyrande Whisperwind]] who is part of the [[Dream Wardens]]. Some of those NPCs can be spoken with:

{{dialogue|title=Vyranoth|
Speak if you must.

{{Gossip|Why are you here?}}

[[Fyrakk]] has lost sight of our true aim. He seeks power and fire, not the liberation of [[dragonkin]]d from the [[Titan]]s' corruption.

Alexstrasza and I have spoken at length. We have achieved understanding and, I believe, trust.

Therefore, I am trusting both her and you as I endeavor to stop my brother from undoing all we have fought for.

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
}}

{{dialogue|title=Ysera|
Thank you for coming to help.

I see Merithra stand up as the leader of [[Green dragonflight|our flight]], and I am proud.

Let us venture into the Dream one time. One last time, perhaps, and see the future of the world tree secured.

{{Gossip|{{Text|rare|(Play Movie)}} Remind me how you returned to Azeroth.}}

''The [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|cinematic]] from [[Reunited, Once Again]] plays out.''

{{dialogue|title=Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|
Our [[Dragonflight|flights]] have come together to stand against the fiery forces that would threaten the Emerald Dream. 

For so long, my sister was the [[Dragon Aspects|Aspect]] of that realm. And now, her daughter leads us. It is a bittersweet feeling.

{{Gossip|{{Text|rare|(Play Movie)}} Show me what threatens the World Tree.}}

''The "[[#A Crown of Flame cinematic|A Crown of Flame]]" cinematic plays out.''
}}

{{dialogue|title=Merithra|
I swore that the tree would be kept hidden and safe in the Dream. Now all we have worked for is under threat by flame.

I will not fail. I must not fail.

If you do not fully understand what is at stake, I can show you. The Dream as we know it might change forever...

{{Gossip|{{Text|rare|(Play Movie)}} Show me what threatens the World Tree.}}

''The "[[#A Crown of Flame cinematic|A Crown of Flame]]" cinematic plays out.''

{{Gossip|{{Text|rare|(Play Movie)}} Show me how the tree was planted in the Dream.}}

''The cinematic from [[And Yet So Far]] plays out.''
}}

{{dialogue|title=Tyrande Whisperwind|
The [[Night elf|kaldorei]] will stand and defend this tree. We have lost too much to lose hope.

{{Gossip|Where is [[Malfurion]]?}}

He rests in [[Ardenweald]].

When the [[Primalists]] threatened the Emerald Gardens and attempted to find the nascent tree, he took Ysera's place in order to fulfill the bond with the [[Winter Queen]].

I can sense his presence is very near, though. Just out of reach. I know he is with us in spirit.

{{#ev:youtube|83bc-086rPU}}
:''[[Zaqali Caldera]], [[Zaralek Cavern]]. The right arm of [[Igira]] extends upward and swings down onto an anvil with a metallic thud. Offscreen, [[Fyrakk]] speaks as several [[Druids of the Flame]] stand at attention, with their arms crossed in front of their chest. Throughout, Igira keeps striking the axe.''
:{{text|bossemote|Fyrakk|[[Iridikron|My brother]] believed he could control me, this rage inside my heart.}}
:''With one last strike, the blacksmith moves away as Fyrakk, in visage form, walks up to the axe: [[Fyr'alath the Dreamrender]].''
:{{text|bossemote|Fyrakk|[[Vyranoth|My sister]] believed she could tame me. My fury will not be sated.}}
:''As Fyrakk looks at Fyr'alath, the four Druids of the Flame start a ritual -- runes appearing at their feet. Those runes appear on the axe.''
:{{text|bossemote|Fyrakk|The Aspects believed they could imprison me, but my hatred cannot be contained.}}
:''The purple of [[shadowflame]] appears from Fyrakk's eyes before he grabs Fyr'alath, which flares to life. The scene shifts to the [[Central Encampment]] of [[Amirdrassil]] in the [[Emerald Dream (zone)|Emerald Dream]] as Fyrakk continues speaking offscreen.''
:{{text|bossemote|Fyrakk|They know what is coming. That the unyielding flame draws closer, ever closer.}}
:''The camera pans around to focus on [[Ysera]], in visage form, alongside [[Shandris Feathermoon]] as [[Alexstrasza]] and [[Nozdormu]] fly in. Nearby, [[Ebyssian]] and [[Kalecgos]], both in their visage forms, are preparing. At a war table, [[Khadgar]], [[Vyranoth]], [[Merithra]], [[Sabellian]], and [[Wrathion]], all in their visage forms, are discussing a plan.''
:{{text|bossemote|Fyrakk|Even now, they cling to one another in the dark... lost in their "dream".}}
:''The scene cuts to show [[Tyrande Whisperwind]], focused on her warglaives, as she is sharpening them. Alexstrasza and Norzdormu flying past is enough to distract her as she turns to watch them land. Hiding behind a conveniently-placed tree, they land and shift to their visage forms as well.''
:{{text|bossemote|Fyrakk|Deceived by those who squandered our birthright.}}
:''As Alexstrasza walks up, Vyranoth turns her head and nods at the dragonqueen. Alexstrasza nods in return. The scene cuts back to Zaqali Caldera, focused on the axe that Fyrakk is dragging along the ground.''
:{{text|bossemote|Fyrakk|Betrayers, all of them.}}
:''He walks through the four Druids of the Flame, then picks up Fyr'alath, holding it in both hands.''
:{{text|bossemote|Fyrakk|So it falls to me, to make them pay.}}
:''Fyrakk lifts up Fyr'alath overhead, and slashes it down in a two-handed strike, opening a tear in reality that leads to the Emerald Dream! Cackling menacingly, he walks through the tear, focusing on Amirdrassil as the grass at his feet catches fire. He drops the axe and the fire spreads rapidly.''
:{{text|bossemote|Fyrakk|Their suffering has just begun.}}
