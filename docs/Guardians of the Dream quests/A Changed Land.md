==Description==
The arrival of [[Amirdrassil]] brings great change to [[Azeroth]]. Its roots are finding a home in the soil beneath even as its branches stretch skyward to taste the air.

This is an auspicious moment, but we must not forget our allies from the Isles. Visit with those nearby to ensure they are safe and sound.

* [[Perennial Pompon Pendant]]
* [[Sunrise Circlet]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Amirdrassil has safely arrived, but we must make sure our allies are also safe and sound.

==Completion==
I am heartened to hear that our friends are well. Thank you for visiting them, Champion.

==Notes==

:{{text|say|Cataloger Coralie|I don't see it anywhere. It must be on the beach somewhere!}}

:{{text|say|Kranac Sagesnow|[Furbolg] Its branches... its roots...}}

For something like this to exist... the dragons have indeed returned.
