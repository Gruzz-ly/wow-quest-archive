==Objectives==
Bring [[Khadgar]] a drink in [[Bel'ameth]].
* Drink ordered
* Drink delivered to Khadgar

==Description==
Ah, <name>! You're just the person I was looking for. I'm a little concerned about Khadgar. I don't think it's anything dire, but he doesn't seem to be enjoying himself like everyone else--he just seems... distracted. 

I don't want to pry, but perhaps you could bring him a drink for me? He may open up to you.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Luscious Leaf Loop]]
* [[Summer Sky Signet]]
* [[Bramble Bark Band]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Were you able to cheer up Khadgar, <name>?

==Completion==
Thank you, friend. I knew he'd speak to you.

Maybe now we can both relax.

==Notes==
Speak with [[Kritha]], the barkeep:
{{Dialogue|
We are at your service, <name>. What would you like to drink?

{{gossip|quest=|I'd like a drink for Khadgar, please.}}
{{Dialogue-child|class=plainlist|
Is that so? Well, which would he prefer?

{{plainlist|
*{{gossip|A Dalaran Dazzler.}}
*{{gossip|A Karazhan Twist.}}
*{{gossip|Something delightfully sour.}}
*{{gossip|Something dark and curious.}}
*{{gossip|Whatever [[Kalecgos]] is having.}}
*{{gossip|Whatever you recommend will do.}}
*{{gossip|Just an ale, please.}}
*{{gossip|Goat's milk in a skull mug.}}
}}}}}}
:{{text|say|Kritha|I hope he enjoys!}}

Pick any option, which in order of above, will be: [[Dalaran Dazzler]], [[Karazhan Twist]], [[Hornswog's Breath]], [[Niffen Strong-Sniffer Stout]], [[Azure Leywine]], [[Emerald Dreamtime]], [[Maruukai Pale Ale]], or [[Goat's Milk in a Skull Mug]].

Then speak with Khadgar:

{{Dialogue|
<Khadgar frowns at something on the table.>

Oh, <name>. What is it you need?

{{gossip|quest=|I have a drink for you from Kalecgos.}}

:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Hello, champion. I trust you are enjoying this well-deserved moment of celebration.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|It was heartening to see members of the [[Alliance]] and [[Horde]] fighting side by side for a shared cause.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|After the dark days of the [[Fourth War]], I feared it would never happen again.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Yet even as we relish the victory over [[Fyrakk]] and welcome the birth of a new [[World Tree]], members of the [[Kirin Tor]] have brought me troubling reports.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Something is moving in the shadows. An ancient enemy stirs, incited by some "[[Xal'atath|Harbinger]]" with whom [[Iridikron]] has dark dealings.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|How these forces are connected and what they're after, I cannot say. But I've spoken with an [[Alleria Windrunner|old friend]] who's going to investigate.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|If what I suspect is truly coming to pass, [[Azeroth]] will soon need you to defend her once again.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Enough of my rumination. Please, return to the gathering... and let Kalecgos know he doesn't need to worry about me!}}
