:''The scene fades to black for a moment and the characters all disappear.''

Before [[Tyrande Whisperwind]] leaves, she has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|The kaldorei will flourish amidst this wondrous new home.
}}

On the hill to the east, many {{expac|Dragonflight}} characters have arrived and are gathered around tables as well as [[Night Elf Reveler]]s, [[Dizzying Reveler]]s, [[Disoriented Reveler]]s, [[Irritated Reveler]]s, [[Dedicated Patron]]s, [[Noxious Decoration]]s, and [[Talking Fish]]. Find [[Erugosa]] or a [[Vibrant Feast]] table, then bring it to any [[Table (Amirdrassil)|Table]]. [[Boisterous Child]]ren and [[Boisterous Instigator]]s are also running around and dancing.

To continue, feed twelve tables, then find the Aspects near the top of the hill. [[Kalecgos]] and [[Merithra]] both offer quests, [[A Disquieting Feeling]] and [[A Different Enthusiasm]], which are required to continue.

Characters that respond to getting fed:
*{{text|say|Boss|More snacks? Thank you, <name>!}}
*{{text|say|Brena|Always happy to share a meal with friends.}}
*{{text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Wow, that's a lot of food! Thanks, <name>.}}
*{{text|say|Haephesta|Remarkable preparation. This cuisine is sure to impress!}}
*{{text|say|Haleh|Oh, that looks delicious! Thank you!}}
*{{text|say|Doc Nanners|Nanners calls dibs!}}

*{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Why thank you, Uplander! That smells divine.}}
*{{text|say|Akora|Thank you! That looks amazing. Was it grown here?}}
*{{text|say|Haephesta| Remarkable preparation. This cuisine is sure to impress!}}

For the sake of organization, character gossip is ordered by race or by organization, then by the table they're standing around:

===Centaur and tauren===
[[Khanam Matra Sarest]], [[Khansguard Akato]], [[Scout Tomul]], [[Nawa]], [[Koya Windtotem]] [[Ironhoof]], [[Windsage Boku]], [[Okir]], [[Sansok Khan]], [[Basran]], [[Tigari Khan]] and [[Altan]], [[Taivan]], [[Chimei]]
{{Dialogue|title=Khanam Matra Sarest|We continue to honor the pact of friendship between [[Centaur|our people]] and the [[dragon]]s--and look how the world has been rewarded! Such natural splendor is truly a wondrous sight to behold. Why, even Ohn'ahra herself has joined the celebration.

None of this would have been possible without you. The daughters of [[Teera]] will always smile on you, friend.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Scout Tomul|I've never been one for celebrations. I'd rather be on the hunt.

<Scout Tomul looks to the side.>

But I suppose if I'm going to celebrate, doing so with my favorite two-foot isn't so bad.
}}
{{Dialogue|title=Windsage Boku|My friend! The winds told me you'd be safe, and they were right! I wanted to thank you for what you've done to help my people.

In case nobody's told you already.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Sansok Khan|
<As Sansok Khan signs, Okir vocalizes.>

Enjoying the feast, friend? [[Clan Shikaar|The Shikaar]] are proud to have supplied the game for the table, and prouder still of our courageous brethren.

We have overcome great challenges since the dragons returned, many thanks to your help. Know that you will always be welcome at our fires or on our hunts, wherever they may be.

{{gossip|It is good to see you again, friend.}}
}}
:''Sansok Khan signs "thank you".

{{Dialogue|title=Basran|
<You extend a hand to offer Basran pets, but he stays stoically next to his khan.

Basran is currently working and you should not pet service dogs on duty.>
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Chimei|The celebration is a little loud.

But I'm okay. I'm happy for everyone.}}

===Dracthyr and dragonkin===
[[Scalecommander Azurathel]], [[Scalecommander Cindrethresh]], [[Scalecommander Viridia]], [[Kodethi]], and [[Dervishian]]
{{Dialogue|title=Scalecommander Azurathel|Before stasis, I could not see a family or a future beyond my own [[weyrn]], and that was all I needed.

Honor and duty mean nothing without a cause to apply them to. These people, and these dragons, are more than I had the ability to dream of during my training.

And I shall protect them to my very end.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Scalecommander Cindrethresh|I finally showed Viridia me. This version of me.

You know what she did when she saw me? She gave me a hug! Can you believe it? A hug! With both arms and wings.

I once watched her rip a [[wyvern]] stinger out of a soldier's chest without so much as batting an eye.

I hope I can talk her into sticking around.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Scalecommander Viridia|Thanks to you, we have been able to recover [[Dracthyr|our people]], defeat an ancient foe, and bring a measure of peace to this part of the world.

Now my real work can begin. Cindrethresh would like me to go with him, but I have already seen too much, and not enough.

This world is in pain, and her people are in pain. As long as there are people in need of healing and relief, I will be there to bring it.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Kodethi|I am grateful this conflict is over. I have a multitude of experiments and research my talons are itching to dig into.

Questions like how a [[World Tree]] could balance such a maelstrom effect like the loss of the [[Well of Eternity]]. Or the impact of [[titan]]ic and [[void]] influences on the substrate of [[Azeroth]] would not just shear it to pieces.

I heard there are some portals that lead to a world called [[Draenor]]. Fascinating place. I should visit there as part of my research.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Dervishian|The cultures! Do you know how much food I have tried since waking up? I have caught up on so much history. It is fascinating.

I even got a job. A job! Not an assignment. You are looking at the newest diplomat for the [[Alliance]]. Travelling, talking to new people, avoiding opening doors with ancient enemies behind them. That sort of thing. 

I am so excited.}}

[[Chromie]], [[Soridormi]], [[Siaszerathel]], [[Andantenormu]], [[Eternus]], [[Aeonormu]]
{{Dialogue|title=Chromie|The tree is safe and so is Lord Nozdormu! And we have [[Dragon Aspects|our Aspects]] back!

See! I just KNEW it would all work out. Did I see the future?

<Chromie winks at you.>

Well, that would be telling.

Go and enjoy the party, <name>. We'll be meeting again--well... You'll see.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Soridormi|<Soridormi smiles, eyes alight with wonder as she beholds [[Amirdrassil]].>

The [[timeway]]s have been so clouded and so much has been uncertain. But here and now, I can see clearly. This tree has a great future ahead of it.

<Soridormi's attention turns to you.>

As do you, <name>. For all you have done for [[Bronze dragonflight|my flight]], you have my thanks.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Siaszerathel|<Name>! When I joined the [[Timewalkers]] I never thought I'd be involved in the birth of a whole new World Tree! Isn't this amazing?

I'm no longer a recruit! I'm a full timewalker now. I couldn't have done it without your help. Thank you.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Andantenormu|The timeways have been so chaotic as of late. I knew I could not sit idly by and remain with my research. I am pleased we have brought some order back to the timeways.

<Andantenormu chuckles.>

I did not foresee I would make friends such as you and Zera, but I am glad. We will meet again... in due time.
}}
{{Dialogue|title=Eternus|This is not how I envisioned things would turn out, but I cannot say I am displeased with the results, mortal.}}

[[Lord Andestrasz]], [[Majordomo Selistra]], [[General Torastrasza]], [[Kandrostrasz]], [[Commander Lethanak]]
{{Dialogue|title=Lord Andestrasz|Keep flying high and may your drake guide you onward wherever you may go, friend!}}
{{Dialogue|title=Majordomo Selistra|Amirdrassil is secure and the festivities are plentiful. Let us rest our wings here, yes?}}
{{Dialogue|title=Commander Lethanak|Another battle hard-won, and another victory for the people of Azeroth!}}

[[Alexstrasza]], [[Ysera]], [[Kalecgos]], [[Merithra|Merithra of the Dream]], [[Ebyssian]], [[Sabellian]], [[Wrathion]], [[Vyranoth]], [[Scalecommander Emberthal]], [[Right]], [[Talonstalker Kavia]], [[Left]]. Kalecgos starts [[A Disquieting Feeling]], and Merithra starts [[A Different Enthusiasm]], both required to continue.
{{Dialogue|title=Alexstrasza|It warms my heart to see a celebration of renewal rather than victory. I feel as if our kind is about to take wing for the first time, not as five Aspects, but as a unified people. 

So much of this can be credited to you, my friend. Thank you for all you have done.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Nozdormu|It is a relief to see the timeways so clearly after so long. I am no longer afraid for my future, or the future of my flight. Chromie has reminded me of what it means to steward the paths of [[time]].

Of course, she credits you for everything. I can see the truth in that as well.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Ysera|<Ysera seems distracted. Perhaps it would be best to leave her to her thoughts for now.>}}
{{Dialogue|title=Kalecgos|I still can scarcely believe that my flight, once so scattered, have forged bonds with each other so quickly. Much of that is thanks to you, my friend.

The [[blue dragonflight]]--and myself--are forever in your debt. Should you have need of anything, simply ask.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Merithra|It seems [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]] once again stands strong, thanks to your aid. I do not know what we have done to deserve your favor time and again, but I am forever grateful for it. Thank you.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Ebyssian|[[Black dragonflight|My flight]]--it still seems strange to call them mine--stands united because of you. We have a future because of you. We will live on because of you.

Forgive me, I do not have the words to express the depth of our gratitude. You have secured the survival of my kind. Thank you.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Sabellian|Champion--I had no idea how my return to Azeroth would be received. Truth be told, there was concern beneath my confidence, though I hardly let it show.

You provided not only a welcome, but the means to establish a future for my flight. It is all I could have asked for and so much more.

I am forever in your debt.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Wrathion|Ah, my friend! I should have known you'd be at the festivities. A word, if you don't mind?

I am admittedly young, but I feel my journey has already come so far. And yet, so much still lies ahead of me. I thought being an Aspect was my destiny. But you have helped me see it is so much more than that.

I do not know where this path will take me, but I hope that you will join me on the journey every now and again.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Vyranoth|It is strange--your [[Life spans|lifespan]] is but a blink of my eye, yet you did not hesitate to help me and offer your friendship. I still do not know what to think of this.

But if your kind is capable of so much, then perhaps even one as ancient as myself still has lessons to be learned.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Scalecommander Emberthal|We have come a long way, <name>.

The future still seems uncertain, but in a good way, I think. Instead of orders, we have allies... and friends.

This world is not the world we left when we went into stasis. But in many ways I think it is a world that will embrace our people far more readily than the one we left behind.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Right|If he didn't say thank you, I will.

But don't tell him about it.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Left|Perhaps he isn't a prince after all, but he's still my priority.}}

[[Gerithus]], [[Valithria Dreamwalker]], [[Itharius]], [[Somnikus]], [[Theramus]]
{{Dialogue|title=Gerithus|Sometimes when I close my eyes I can still feel the heat of [[Fyrakk]]'s [[Shadowflame|flame]], hear his laughter.

I know that he's gone and there is nothing more to fear, yet the memories are still so fresh in my mind. Has that ever happened to you?

If I keep my focus on studying Amirdrassil now that it has bloomed into Azeroth, it will get better, perhaps.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Theramus|Being here with my friends and [[Green dragonflight|flight]] all around me... A new beginning awaits us all. I finally feel at peace. Everything was worth it.}}

[[Azuregos]], [[Zeros]], [[Haleh]], [[Stellagosa]], [[Lanigosa]], [[Headteacher Doragosa]], [[Emmigosa]]
{{Dialogue|title=Azuregos|So many people--alive and well. Perhaps [[Sindragosa]] was right after all.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Zeros|Wow. I feel so lucky to see this. I hope [[Senegos]] is watching, wherever he is now.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Haleh|This is a truly magical time! To think that I only [[Winterspring|knew frost and snow]], for so long... There will be so much to study about the new tree.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Stellagosa|The [[Azurewing]] are still processing Grandfather's passing, but they were relieved that it was a moment he chose.

I admit, I scarcely know where to begin in leading them, but Kalecgos assures me I am more than capable. Grandfather told him as much.

Thank you for everything, my friend. Should you have need of the Azurewing, we will always be there.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Lanigosa|So many people! I hardly know what to say. I think for now I'll simply listen.

It is good to hear the voices of friends again.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Emmigosa|<Emmigosa smiles shyly.>

Thank you.}}

[[Veritistrasz]], [[Voraxian]], [[Baskilan]], [[Exadria]], [[Osoria]]
{{Dialogue|title=Veritistrasz|It has been a long time since I have intentionally gone to such a large gathering.

When you first met me, I do not think I would have been able to.

Now, I find it... less overwhelming.

<Voraxian elbows Veritistrasz.>

Okay, okay. I am enjoying myself.

Thank you for everything, <name>.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Voraxian|Everyone was so spread out in [[Outland]]. Even in [[Shattrath]] we wouldn't have this many people close together.

It's pretty good fun!

After all that has happened, it is nice to see my kin finally be able to unwind.}}

[[Agapanthus]] and [[Sir Pringly]], [[Vaeros]], [[Lasztak]]

{{Dialogue|title=Agapanthus|Meeting Lasztak's previous mentor has proved to be very enlightening.

I'm not sure whether I am learning more about how to care for ruby [[whelp]]s or how to better instruct Lasztak.
}}
{{Dialogue|title=Vaeros|A few hours away from the whelps is welcome and necessary. Very, very necessary.

I am grateful to be working with promising young whelptenders like Lasztak.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Lasztak|Sometimes I miss working in the [[Ruby Life Pools]] gardens. But we get to visit a lot with the whelps at the [[Little Scales Daycare|daycare]]!}}

[[Guard-Captain Alowen]], [[Atrenosh Hailstone]], [[Forgemaster Bazentus]], [[Field Commander Ignax]], [[Teller]], [[Boss (drakonid)|Boss]], [[Captain Drine]], [[Beef]], [[Wellington]], and [[Mignon]]
{{Dialogue|title=Boss|Thanks for all your help. The [[Obsidian Outcasts|Outcasts]] have been all smiles again, and I owe that to you.}}

[[Akora]], [[Ecologist Tharu]], [[Ecologist Iskha]], [[Dazakros]], [[Keshki]]
{{Dialogue|title=Akora|Oh, to think we'll be living at the feet of a garden of this scale! What a dream come true!}}
{{Dialogue|title=Ecologist Tharu|It's been fun! But maybe we can finally get some work done with all these [[adventurer]]s out of our way, hah!}}
{{Dialogue|title=Ecologist Iskha|Oh dear, I just hope someone's done an ecological survey on how all this noise will affect the wildlife.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Dazakros|Lasztak, Keshki, and Akora are all wranglin' their tasks so well! 

I know we're part of the same class, but I look up to each of them.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Keshki|I, um. I just have something in my eye. Thinking about how safe all the creatures will be.}}

===Keepers of the grove===
[[Cenarius]], [[Keeper Amrymn]],<ref group="note">In place of Keeper Amrymn was originally [[Larodar]], but he was eventually hotfixed out and replaced with Keeper Amrymn.</ref> [[Keeper Ordanus]], [[Rensar Greathoof]], [[Lyessa Bloomwatcher]], [[Keeper Remulos]]
{{Dialogue|title=Cenarius|This cherished expression of the Dream, married with the dedication of the [[kaldorei]] and the waters of Eternity... it is truly a blessed place.}}

===Niffen===
[[Aurantia]], [[Effervesta]], [[Myrrit]], [[Perisimona]], and [[Tuberros]]
{{Dialogue|title=Aurantia|<Aurantia sighs.>

I can't remember the last time I left [[Loamm]]. I worry about my [[niffen]] while I'm gone. But this is worth it, uplander.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Effervesta|This party is amazing, uplander! I've never smelled a tree up close. And this one is huge!}}
{{Dialogue|title=Myrrit|I wanted you to know that we'll always be dig buddies, even if you go on other adventures. Just don't forget about me. I'll never forget YOU!}}
{{Dialogue|title=Elder Honeypelt|You uplanders sure know how to party! Now let me see if I can find that [[Wrathion|nice-smelling friend of yours]].}}

===Night elves===
[[Delaryn Summermoon]] is by herself:
{{Dialogue|title=Delaryn Summermoon|My heart may be cold, but the sight of Amirdrassil... for a moment, I felt warm.

I only wish [[Ferryn]] were here to see this.

{{gossip|Stay a while and listen.}}
}}
:''A [[wisp]] flies up and excitedly flies around Delaryn.''

{{Dialogue|title=Altruis the Sufferer|Many sacrifices have made way for this moment. We must not forget a single one.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Shandris Feathermoon|I may never fully understand why [[Demon hunter|these kaldorei]] chose such a desperate path... but I want to try. They should be heard.

None of our people should suffer.}}

[[Felina Starrunner]], [[Celina Crunchyleaves]], [[Belysra Starbreeze]], [[Thalendra]], [[Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare]], [[Moon Priestess Lasara]], [[Lunara]], [[Priestess Alinya]]

{{Dialogue|title=Norukk|Goodness! You're here, too!

My! I haven't seen this many folk in one place since the last Tuskmoot! And such strange, unique creatures have come!

My, my, my! Is that a [[fairy]]? And a [[harpy]]! And SO many dragons! Oh goodness, what could we learn from speaking with these folks!

Why, I wonder how that fairy keeps herself afloat with wings of that size. By known standards of flight...

<He continues for some time.>}}

[[Ruriq]], [[Kauj]], [[The Blubberwall]], [[Flufferpaw]], [[Tutaqan]] and [[Qipi]], [[Tukkaraq]], and [[Brena]]
{{Dialogue|title=The Blubberwall|Ah, it is good to lay back for a bit.

Have a drink, friend! Those cowardly [[primalists]] will soon be gone from [[Imbu]]. Our home reclaimed, our people safe!

This drink is sweet, but victory is sweeter!

<The Blubberwall laughs.>}}
{{Dialogue|title=Tutaqan|In our darkest moments, it can difficult to believe that we will one day grow past our troubles. But so too do seeds grow in the darkness of the soil, and look what beauty blooms from them!}}
{{Dialogue|title=Brena|I can sense spirits all around us. They are joyous, hopeful.

<Brena closes her eyes and smiles.>

What a wonderful feeling.

With the wisdom of the spirits of the old and the hope of the young... I think this is a new beginning for us all.}}

[[To'no]], [[Nau]], [[Neelo]], [[Rowie]], [[Little Ko]], and [[Scaps]] at the kids table.
{{Dialogue|title=To'no|If I climb on this table I don't think I'll get in trouble cuz Scaps is up there and if he can do it so can I.

My parents said not to climb on tables but sometimes Ko does and I'm her big brother so I'm supposed to go with her and then we'll both be on the table.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Nau|Hi hi!

<Nau kicks her legs back and forth.>

Neelo, Scaps, and Rowie have been w-whuspurin' about running off and a-advuntring together!

They think they can leave me behind?!

<Nau picks at her sleeve.>

I can't decide if I should tell ma and ta... or follow them.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Neelo|<Neelo quickly hushes up and turns away from Rowie as you approach.>

Hi there!

Who, us? We're just talking about... which kind of fish is the best! Definitely!}}
{{Dialogue|title=Rowie|Whoa! It's you again!

<Rowie glances to see if the adults are watching and then leans in close to whisper.>

Look, don't tell anyone, but Neelo and I are planning an adventure! We want to be big strong heroes like you!

Scaps is coming too, of course. With those claws and teeth, he'll be a huge asset in the wilderness!

<Rowie glances at the adults again and then sighs.>

Don't worry, we'll start small. Just a little journey! To the [[Kauriq Gleamlet|Gleamlet]], maybe.

{{Dialogue|title=Erugosa|Deliver that order first, then come back to me for another.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Big Kinook|<Kinook appears deep in thought as he considers the ingredients before him.>

Hrm, the fish here are... strange. The texture is so... light, so airy. Nothing at all like some good ol' [[eel]] guts.

Hah! I'll just have to give it a try! New ingredients means all sorts of new soup flavors to bring out!}}
{{Dialogue|title=Pleeqi|<Pleeqi is nearly vibrating with excitement watching Kinook experiment with new ingredients.>}}

Hard to get into trouble back here with all the delicious food!}}
{{Dialogue|title=Apprentice Tucky|<Apprentice Tucky glances away from the list.>

Oh, it's you. Don't worry, I'm just making note of everything coming through the portal. You know, for [[Kirin Tor]] purposes.

...If you want to grab something off the record, just let me know.}}

You understand that the chef is rather busy, but happy to see you again.>

{{Dialogue|title=Chef Butterfingers|Hey, <name>! Great to see you again. You should try [[Tri-Spiced Escargot|the escargot]]--it's a little something I developed while in [[Zaralek Cavern]].

{{Dialogue|title=Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem|I remember when the [[tauren]] were first allowed to join the [[Cenarion Circle]]. Little did we know then that there were far more [[druid]]s in the world than just shu'halo<ref group="note">In place of the word "shu'halo" was originally "taurahe", but it was quickly hotfixed.</ref> and kaldorei.

I believe this is the first we have all been able to gather under the banner of peace. We have much to learn from each other.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Cataloger Coralie|<Name>! Have you seen the delightful little [[critter]]s running around Amirdrassil?

This World Tree has drawn in so many majestic creatures. I'm going to run out of film!}}
{{Dialogue|title=Cataloger Wulferd|Ah, adventurer! Here's a photograph as my thanks for before.

<Wulferd hands you a landscape photo of the [[Waking Shores]]. The number in the corner suggests it is not unique.>

That'll be worth triple what it is now in a few years. Better hold onto it!}}

[[Boss Magor]], [[Thaelin Darkanvil]], [[Rannan Korren]], [[Naleidea Rivergleam]], [[Toddy Whiskers]]
{{Dialogue|title=Thaelin Darkanvil|<Thaelin cranes his neck to look at the other party guests.>

Do ye think there are any night elf architects here? Now tha' Amirdrassil's on Azeroth, there's talk of building a new city!

Can ye imagine it? With all these roots an' branches, and the new [[moonwell]]... Och, I have scores of ideas already!

{{Dialogue|title=Rannan Korren|I never went and saw the other World Tree before it... yanno.

I thought it was just a tree. [[Lathos Sunband|Lathos]] would have disagreed and told me more about the elves than I cared to know.

But now, seeing all these people here gathered around it... with friends... He was right. And I miss him.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Naleidea Rivergleam|In all my years of exploration, I never expected to witness the birth of a new World Tree. Fascinating!}}
{{Dialogue|title=Toddy Whiskers|Hoo! Wasn't that an adventure! You're proving every day why I'm glad to have you on my team, friend.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental|<Name>! It is wonderful to see you.

This is quite the smashing party, is it not?

They even have shale sandwiches! That is very thoughtful.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Earthmender Narvra|So, saved a new World Tree. Brought it from the Dream into the real world. And defeated Fyrakk.

This is a normal day for you, isn't it?

I'm glad we have you with us.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Tellywin Sharpfizzle|Wow, someone is going to have to write this one down for historical purposes.

I don't suppose you kept notes of everything you did?}}
{{Dialogue|title=Sonova Snowden|It's been a trip, hasn't it, <name>? I was expecting an adventure when tha [[Dragonscale Expedition|Expedition]] came a-knockin', don't get me wrong, but maybe next time we can do it without all tha fire. I've had me fill for a while.

Ah well, "Adversity beads prosperity", as the [[Winterpelt Furbolg|Winterpelt]] say. Or something to that effect, anyway.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Glania of the Blessed Ones|Ah, my friend! Have you sampled the delightful food they are offering? There is plenty of fish!

I caught many myself.

<Glania smiles proudly.>}}
{{Dialogue|title=Noriko the All-Remembering|As practitioners of [[magic]], we are often witness to the fantastical--it is as ordinary as having our morning tea.

But this... this is a truly extraordinary occasion. I will commit this to memory, always... and to the historical records at [[Dalaran]], once we make our return.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Tyrande Whisperwind|<Tyrande smiles gently.>

[[Elune]] smiles on us this day. For the first time in what seems so long, I feel as if I can breathe unimpeded.

Thank you.

{{Dialogue|title=Mayla Highmountain|I have not had the chance to speak to you, but I wanted to thank you for helping Baine. He has been through much, and it weighed on him far more than he would ever admit.

That weight has been lifted somewhat, thanks to you. His journey is far from over, but you have helped him take the first few steps towards healing.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Baine Bloodhoof|It is a relief to see the Alliance and the [[Horde]] coming together for something that is not a battle.

Our people--on both sides--have been through enough.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Champion, it is good to see you again. It is good to see everyone--I spent many years searching for peace between the factions. Today, I feel as if perhaps we have accomplished it.

For now.

I only hope that this unity lasts.

:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|So beautiful. Like a [[Radiant Song|song]]. It seemed to be calling out to me.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Could it be the voice of the World Tree?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I don't think so. It sounded far more ancient. I'm not sure how I know that. It's just a feeling.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|If we both heard it... felt it... maybe others did, too.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Perhaps. But let's leave that investigation for another day. Tonight, we celebrate our victory.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|All of us. Together.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Together.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Thrall|It is strange--the last time I remember all of us being united like this, we saw the destruction of the World Tree at the end of it. This time, we see the birth of renewed hope.

May the bonds we've built today last longer.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Lilian Voss|We haven't been welcomed with open arms, but we haven't been attacked, either.

It's a start.}}

===Others===
[[Q'onzu]] is by themself.

{{Dialogue|title=Q'onzu|Greetings, mighty champion.

It seems we all have our new World Tree and Azeroth claims victory once again.

All hail goodness! All hail [[Order]]!

<Q'onzu cocks their head sarcastically.>

In the end, it matters not who won.

You have changed. The Dream has changed. Azeroth has changed.

As all things must.

{{gossip|Why are you called a [[loa]]?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Why are you a <race>? Why are you called a <class>?

It's who you are. Loa is who I am. It's what I was called by my first devotees and it's what I have chosen to embrace.

<Q'onzu swivels their great head around, their eyes narrowing in a cheeky expression.> 

Mystery is certainly delightful... isn't it?}}

{{gossip|I have met and aided many spirits of the Wilds and those that worship them. You, however, are new.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Doesn't that make this all the more exciting? An unfamiliar droplet in an ocean of ordinariness!

The [[Wild God]]s, the [[August Celestial]]s, even the many loa you are familiar with! Instead of perceiving me through the lens of what is known, consider an alternative.

The tree of life is vast, her crown reaching high and her roots sinking deep.

And you, <order hall title>, have only seen a few of her many branches.

{{Dialogue|title=Cerellean Whiteclaw|[[Anaya Dawnrunner|Anaya]]'s [[Anaya's Pendant|pendant]] was beginning to weigh on me, as though it were the last piece of her trapped here on Azeroth. It granted me courage through a dark season, but it was time to let it go.

Thank you for your part in the ceremony. I feel... lighter than I have in some time.}}
