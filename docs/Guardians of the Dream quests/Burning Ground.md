==Objectives==
Disrupt the [[Smoldering Copse|smoldering copse]].
* Captured denizens rescued (8)

==Description==
We allowed ourselves to be distracted. We thought the [[Druids of the Flame]] had followed us into the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]], when clearly they arrived before we did.

With [[Amirdrassil]] so close at hand, we cannot allow them to plant their ashen roots here. Release their prisoners. Ransack their supplies. Do whatever you can to ensure that this burning corruption does not spread further.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Chartreuse Champion's Girdle
|Summer Soother's Sash
|Spirited Stag's Waistguard
|Fearless Faerie's Belt
|Summer Soother's Bands
|Chartreuse Champion's Bracers
|Fearless Faerie's Wristbands
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
We must act quickly. The further this flame-blighted ground spreads, the more danger our allies will face in the days to come.

==Completion==
Even as warped by flame as they are, these druids have not forgotten the way to the dream. It will be difficult to keep them out entirely.

Still, without a proper base of operations, they will struggle to expand their influence. Your deeds today will help ensure Amirdrassil's safety against this spreading fire.

==Notes==
When accepting both this quest and [[Grim Reprisal]]:<!--both or only Grim Reprisal?-->
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Immortality... Is that truly what this is about? Is that the lie these zealots have sold them?}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|My people have suffered so much. I will not allow these sycophants to sell them a seeming eternity, built upon a burning pyre of innocent lives.}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Disrupt their camp and break their ranks. I will seek out their leader - and show them how foolish it is to tempt the ire of [[Elune]].}}
:''Tyrande runs off.''

Captured denizens include [[Captured Runebear]]s, [[Captured Sister]]s, and [[Captured Darter]]s held in [[Smolderbark Cage]]s.

Catch up with Tyrande southwest of the quest area, with some [[Rescued Runebear]]s, [[Rescued Sister]]s, and [[Rescued Darter]]s:
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|You are safe. Good. The denizens that you rescued are burned and bruised, but they should survive thanks to your efforts.}}
