'''Raise the Alarm''' concludes the "Coalition of Flames" storyline of the [[Fury Incarnate campaign]] added in [[patch 10.1.7]].

It is also a requirement to begin the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]] in [[patch 10.2.0]].

==Objectives==
Deliver your report to Captain Drine at the [[Seat of the Aspects]] in [[Valdrakken]].
*Use the [[Sentinel's Whistle]] to return to Valdrakken (Optional)
*Report delivered to [[Captain Drine]] {{co|56.0|40.0|Valdrakken}}
*Use the [[Drakonid Grapple]] (Optional)
*Follow guards to the lower ledge

==Description==
So the [[Druids of the Flame]] have allied with [[Fyrakk]] to help him invade the [[Emerald Dream]].

They were able to turn [[Larodar, Keeper of the Flame|that keeper]] to the flame with hardly any effort. Fyrakk must be bolstering their power, perhaps as payment for their aid in accessing the Dream.

We need to mobilize troops immediately to find every Druid of the Flame on the [[Dragon Isles]] and stop them.

Go to Captain Drine in Valdrakken and alert her. She will dispatch the [[drakonid]].

I will go to [[Merithra]] and handle things here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 15x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
We have to trust [[Alexstrasza]] for now.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Take this whistle. One of my [[hippogryph]]s can quickly ferry you back to Valdrakken.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|[[Elune]] watch over you, <name>. Over us all.}}

Use the provided [[Sentinel's Whistle]] to summon a [[Sentinel's Hippogryph|hippogryph]], and the scene fades to black. After a loading screen, the player stands atop the [[Seat of the Aspects]]. Check in with [[Captain Drine]]:

{{book|content=
So long as you are here to aid Valdrakken, the [[Scalesworn]] will be grateful for the assistance.

We trust in those [[Dragon Aspects|the Aspects]] trust.

{{gossip|quest=|Fyrakk is planning to attack the Emerald Dream. We need to stop him.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Captain Drine|So that is why Fyrakk has been focusing his assault on the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].}}
:''The weather changes as a sudden snowstorm arrives.''
:{{text|say|Captain Drine|I will meet with-- Wait. That sudden chill. Do you feel it?}}
:{{text|say|Captain Drine|By the Aspects... She is here.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Drine|Guards! To the lower ledge! <Name>, follow us and prepare to fight.}}
:''Drine and [[Ruby Queensguard]]s jump off the ledge to get to the lower level.''

Interact with the Drakonid Grapple at the edge of the tower (or just fly down) to the middle layer of the tower. There, Drine and eight guards are facing off against Vyranoth:
:{{text|say|[[Vyranoth]]|I will find Alexstrasza. You will not stop me.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Drine|Begone, Incarnate! You are not welcome in our city!}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|I must speak with Alexstrasza. Out of my way, all of you.}}

Speak with Drine:
{{book|content=
Stand with us, <name>! 

We will not allow the Incarnates to invade our city!

:{{text|say|Vyranoth|I will speak with your Dragon Queen!}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Then speak.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|No doubt you are aware of what my brother is after.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Every gateway to the Emerald Dream has been secured}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|and is well-defended.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|It is not a gate he seeks.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|With the Druids of the Flame at his side,}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Fyrrak will tear his way into that realm}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|and march his forces upon [[Amirdrassil|the World Tree]].}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|His forces?}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|They will fail.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|[[Burning of Teldrassil|This World Tree will not be burned]].}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Burn it?}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|He comes to claim it.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|To twist its pure heart into a mirror of what his own has become --}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|cruel, blazing with insatiable malice,}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|and wreathed in shadow.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|I cannot stand with him.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|He is my brother no more.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Vyranoth ...}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Do what you will with this knowledge.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Farewell, Alexstrasza.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Stand with us.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|(astonished sigh)}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Why would I do that?}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Because you are a protector of [[Azeroth|this world]],}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|and you do not want to see it burn.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|(scoffs)}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Please, hear me now.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I failed you before.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I failed our people.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Yes. You did.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I will not fail them again.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Stand with us, Vyranoth.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|For all [[dragonkin]]d.}}

After the cutscene, Alexstrasza and Vyranoth walk to the door before disappearing. Turn in to Drine. On complete:
:{{text|say|Captain Drine|Guards, back to your posts.}}
:''They walk off and disappear in the distance.''
