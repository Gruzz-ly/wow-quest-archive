'''Echo of the Firelands''' concludes the "A Dream of Fields and Fire" chapter of the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]]. The next chapter begins with [[A Blossom Witnessed]]. Alexstrasza also immediately offers the [[Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope: Fyrakk]] quest to kill Fyrakk.

==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Prophet of the Flame (magma giant).jpg|Prophet of the Flame|The Prophet can shapeshift into powerful forms drawn from the [[Firelands]].}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|84|27}}
* 14,300 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
[[Fyrakk]] has broken through the barrier! He must have become desperate once he saw our forces closing in. To use that much shadowflame all at once...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Merithra]]|The center of Fyrakk's forces are faltering. Only the Prophet stands in our way.}}
:{{text|say|[[Tyrande Whisperwind]]|Then the time has come to extinguish his flame.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|We shall cover your advance from the sky, champion!}}
:''Vyranoth, Alexstrasza, and Merithra LEAP to safe spots, then shift to their dragon forms, while Tyrande mounts up and jumps down.''

Back down in the Field of Flames, [[Cenarius]] is tanking the Prophet of the Flame as [[Chen Stormstout]], [[Baine Bloodhoof]], [[Rokhan]], [[Thrall]], [[Rexxar]] (along with his pets [[Misha]], [[Huffer]], and [[Spirit (hawk)|Spirit]]), [[Mayla Highmountain]], [[Archmage Khadgar]], [[Hamuul Runetotem|Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem]], [[Lilian Voss]], [[Stellagosa]], [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lady Jaina Proudmoore]], Scalecommanders [[Scalecommander Azurathel|Azurathel]], [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]], [[Scalecommander Viridia|Viridia]] and [[Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Cindrethresh]], [[Shandris Feathermoon]], [[Kalecgos]], [[Gelbin Mekkatorque]], [[Jarod Shadowsong]], [[Maiev Shadowsong]], [[Velen|Prophet Velen]], [[Moira Thaurissan]], [[Genn Greymane]], and [[Turalyon|High Exarch Turalyon]] are all engaged in combat with it.

Aggro it:
:{{text|say|Prophet of the Flame|Fyrakk shall open the way!}}

Occasionally:
*{{text|yell|Archmage Khadgar|To the barrier!}}
*{{text|yell|Stellagosa|To the barrier!}}
*{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|To the barrier!}}
*{{Text|yell|Kalecgos|Hurry, stand within a barrier!}}
:{{text|bossemote|The Prophet of Flame prepares to unleash {{text|red|[Incineration]}}!}}

Verdant Rejuvenation:
:{{Text|yell|Cenarius|You will not fall, champion!}}

Defeat it:
:{{text|say|Prophet of the Flame|My flame... will burn... eternal...}}

An [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] starts shortly thereafter:
{{#ev:youtube|kFiDA-Jq4Po}}
:''Fyrakk observes the fall of the prophet, then turns toward the temple.''
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|<growls>}}
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|You are all useless!}}
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|Move aside!}}
:''Fyrakk stands in front of the barrier.''
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|These worms dare to challenge me?}}
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|My will shall be their ruin!}}
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|<Growling scream as he charges up.>}}
:''The four [[Primalist Shieldbreaker]]s that were working on the barrier try to run away, but are caught in Fyrakk's flame.''
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|<A mighty shout as Fyrakk swings at the barrier.>}}
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|THIS TEMPLE.}}
:''Fyrakk swings with [[Fyr'alath the Dreamrender|Dream Render]] several times.''
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|WILL BE.}}
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|MINE!}}
:''The barrier is destroyed and the way into the temple is open.''
:{{Text|say|Fyrakk|<Chuckles.>}}

After the cutscene, the player is standing at the [[Wellspring of Life]] near the instance line to [[Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope]]. Present are [[Emerald Guardian]]s, [[Druid of the Claw (Emerald Dream)|Druids of the Claw]], [[Ancient Protector (Emerald Dream)|Ancient Protectors]], [[Cloudsong]], [[Elderbranch]], Tyrande, [[Sentinel of the New Moon|Sentinels of the New Moon]], [[Priestess of the Moon (Emerald Dream)|Priestesses of the Moon]], and [[Kaldorei Archer]]s.

Approach Alexstrasza:
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Fyrakk has breached the temple!}}

Turning in this quest completes the "A Dream of Fields and Fire" criterion of [[Defenders of the Dream (achievement)]].

Originally, completing [[Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope: Fyrakk]] was required to have Tyrande offer the next quest, [[A Blossom Witnessed]]. Starting with the week of 12 December 2023, the follow-up quest unlocked for everyone regardless of raid progress.

At this point, [[Amirdrassil]] becomes available, and the [[Dragon Isles]] map is updated.
