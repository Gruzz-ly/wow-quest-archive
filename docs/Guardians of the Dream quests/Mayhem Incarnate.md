'''Mayhem Incarnate''' begins the Ice and Fire chapter of the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Vyranoth]] near the [[Primalist Stronghold|Primalist encampment]].

==Description==
We need to uncover exactly what [[Fyrakk]]'s plan is. He is holding his forces away from the tree, but we do not know why.

I can do some scouting, but direct conflict with Fyrakk would not help our cause right now.

Follow me further into the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]]. There is a [[Primalist]] encampment to the north. Let us start there, so we can put an end to this madness.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
My claws are here?

==Notes==
Pre-accept:
:{{text|say|Merithra|If Fyrakk's aim is to take the tree, why is he holding back?}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|And why place his troops so far from his goal?}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Fyrakk craves power. The power to subjugate.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Whatever he is planning, it is a means to this end.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|We must go, observe his soldiers, and learn what they are up to.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|But Queen Alexstrasza, I must--}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Fyrakk is my responsibility now.}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|<Name>, I will meet you near the Primalist encampments to the northwest.}}

Outside the [[Primalist Stronghold]], [[Buri]], a proto-drake of the [[Claws of Vyranoth]], is also present.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Buri|Vyranoth? You have returned.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Buri? I had not expected Fyrakk to put you on the front line.}}
:{{text|say|Buri|I had not expected him to let us live.}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Us? The others also live? I am... pleased.}}

Vyranoth has new gossip:

{{book|content=
Fyrakk's assault on the Emerald Dream must be stopped.

{{gossip|Who are the Claws of Vyranoth?}}

During my time with the Primalists, I commanded an elite squadron of primal dragons. They were called the Claws of Vyranoth.

The four Claws were my most trusted soldiers. They all possessed extraordinary talent, which made them quite useful.

I am pleased to be reunited with them.

As does Buri:

{{book|content=
As a member of the Claws of Vyranoth, my loyalty lies with her.

{{gossip|Who are the Claws of Vyranoth?}}

Vyranoth had a squadron that consisted of her most trusted primal dragons. There were four of us. Me, Suzska, Lethka, and Terro. 

Originally, it was purely a tactical decision. A general who knows their soldiers well can better apply their talents.

But beneath her cold exterior, I know she cares for us more than she lets on.

She came back, didn't she?
