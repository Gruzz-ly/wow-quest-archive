==Objectives==
Regroup with [[Merithra]] at the edge of [[Eye of Ysera]], overlooking [[Slagfell Hold]].

==Description==
[[Ysera|My mother]] seems unable to fully attune with the Eye. Perhaps it senses her ties to [[Ardenweald]]...

Her shield is but a fraction of the Eye's power. If she was fully attuned, she could completely quench our foes' flames.

But we cannot idly wait. We still need more information about [[Galok Windslicer|Galok]] and his plan of attack. [[Bodwin]] indicates there is new flurry of activity in [[Igira]]'s base of operations. With Bodwin's help, we can investigate without being seen.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This will not be easy...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Merithra|All right, Mother. Buy me a little more time. We'll have a plan.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|Show us, Bodwin. We'll regroup outside overlooking the [[djaradin]] base.}}

On complete, Merithra has new gossip:
{{book|content=
The djaradin, [[Primalists]], and [[Druids of the Flame]] make a powerful trio. Their assault has been far too successful, and though I want to believe in our victory, I am scared of the cost.

After what happened to my son, [[Gerithus]], I know that none of us is untouchable.

Much depends on us, <name>. Let's not waver.
