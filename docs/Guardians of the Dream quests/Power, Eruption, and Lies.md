==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Lethka.png|Lethka|A former member of the [[Claws of Vyranoth]], Lethka has pledged herself to [[Fyrakk]]'s cause. She intends to detonate Cinder Summit.}}
Slay Lethka at [[Cinder Summit]].
* [[Lethka]] slain

==Description==
[[Buri]] told me that Lethka plans to ignite Cinder Summit, and [[Vyranoth]] pursued her.

Lethka revealed herself because she knew that Vyranoth would go after her. The power in Cinder Summit can destroy this barrier, or Vyranoth.

We have to go after them.

==Completion==
I cannot celebrate the loss of a friend, but it had to be done.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Buri|Vyranoth should be back by now.}}
:{{text|say|Suzska|Where is she?}}
:{{text|say|Buri|Vyranoth pursued Lethka to Cinder Summit.}}
:{{text|say|Buri|After we saw what she did to [[Terro]]...}}
:{{text|say|Suzska|Lethka is more dangerous than Vyranoth knows.}}
:{{text|say|Suzska|We cannot allow Lethka to detonate that mountain. If Cinder Summit explodes, the barrier will fall.}}
:''They fly off.''

Near the caldera, Vyranoth is hovering after having frozen much of the lava. Buri and Suzska are flying around, and Lethka is stunned on the ice.

:{{text|say|Vyranoth|<Name>! Quickly!}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Go now!}}

Start attacking:
:{{text|say|Lethka|I will enjoy burning you to ash, then melting your precious ice Incarnate!}}
:{{text|say|Lethka|You threw away power for ideals. I will not!}}
:{{text|say|Lethka|The Cinder Summit's power will crush that barrier!}}

Defeat her:
:{{text|say|Lethka|Fyrakk... will end you...}}
:{{text|say|Vyranoth|Lethka. I failed her.}}
:''Vyranoth and the surviving claws fly away.''

On complete:
:{{Text|say|Vyranoth|You both have my thanks.}}

:{{text|say|Suzska|For us, or for you?}}
