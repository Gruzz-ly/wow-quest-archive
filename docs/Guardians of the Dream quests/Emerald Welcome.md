==Objectives==
Enter the Emerald Dream through the portal in [[Ancient Bough]].
*Cross into [[Emerald Dream (zone)|Emerald Dream]]
*Speak to [[Merithra]]
*Meet Merithra in the Emerald Dream.

==Description==
We protected [[Amirdrassil|the tree]] by guarding all entrances to the [[Emerald Dream]]. Now [[Fyrakk]] has found allies to open the way for him.

I will do the same for you and our allies. The [[green dragonflight]] cannot do this alone.

Through this portal, we will enter the Dream together. We must protect that realm and all that grows within it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*[[Flourishing Whimsydrake]]

==Progress==
There is much to be done.

==Completion==
Fyrakk's power threatens the fabric of the Dream. We must hurry to save the realm. This drake will aid you.

==Notes==
Upon accept, the present company enters the portal into the Dream. Follow suit. On the other side of the portal:
:{{Text|say|[[Gerithus]]|Welcome to the Emerald Dream! [[Merithra|My mother]] awaits you further ahead. I must... recover...}}
:{{Text|say|[[Somnikus]]|Mind yourself. There is secret and ancient [[magic]] here.}}

Proceed forward toward the [[Verdant Landing]].
:{{Text|say|Sentinel of the New Moon|There it is... after so long... it's really here.}}

Approach Merithra:
:{{Text|say|Merithra|The Dream welcomes you. Beyond these shores, the World Tree waits.}}

Speak with her:

{{book|content=
I swore that the tree would be kept hidden and safe in the Dream. Now all we have worked for is under threat by flame.

I will not fail. I must not fail.

If you do not fully understand what is at stake, I can show you. The Dream as we know it might change forever...

{{Gossip|How do you feel about this moment?}}

So much has been lost by the [[Night elf|night elves]], and so quickly. Now there is finally a chance to heal and to grow.

First we face Fyrakk. Then my dearest wish is that there will be opportunities for new growth... new life... and a new future.

{{Gossip|{{Text|rare|(Play Movie)}} What do you want me to see?}}}}

An in-engine cutscene plays:

:{{Text|say|Merithra|Behold. Amirdrassil.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|A new World Tree, soon to bloom and be born into [[Azeroth]].}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|The very embodiment of the cycle of life, its boughs infused with the souls of the kaldorei.}}
:{{Text|say|Merithra|Until the tree crosses over into our world, we must defend this symbol of hope from--}}
:''The camera focuses on enemies corrupting the wildlife.''
:{{Text|say|Merithra|No! We must save them!}}
