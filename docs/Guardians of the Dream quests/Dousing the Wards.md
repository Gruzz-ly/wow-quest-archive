==Objectives==
Destroy 4 Warding Firestones.
* [[Warding Firestone]]s destroyed (4)

==Description==
[[Fyrakk]] and [[Vyranoth]] are already here. I spotted them near the overlook at the northeastern edge of [[Lunedane]]. Landing close to their location would reveal our presence, thus we are forced to begin our mission here.

However, the bridge connecting this area to the overlook has been protected with fire magic. We will not be able to break through it.

Fyrakk's [[Primalist]] allies appear to be maintaining the fire using wards set up around this area.

If we destroy the wards, the fire should subside.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
We need to bring that barrier down so we can get closer to [[Primal Incarnates|the Incarnates]]. We cannot hear them from this far away.

==Completion==
Destroying those stones appears to have extinguished the fire magic protecting the bridge.

Though I cannot be certain how long it will stay that way. It would be best to move swiftly.

==Notes==
Once the quest is accepted, Shandris joins the party and will follow the player around. She also has new gossip:

{{book|content=
We need to tread carefully. Alarming the entire encampment at once could be fatal.
}}

Look for Warding Firestones all over the marked quest area. Destroy the fourth one:
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Good. The fire blocking off the bridge should be extinguished now.}}

==Progression==
{{The Coalition of Flames}}
