[[File:Disarm Specialist.jpg|thumb|A Suffusion Shaper and some Suffusion Supplies]]

==Objectives==
Kill 6 Suffusion Shapers and destroy 8 Suffused Supplies.
* [[Suffusion Shaper]] slain (6)
* [[Suffusion Supplies]] destroyed (8)
* [[Dreamy Dust]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Bodwin]]'s scouting sortie returned more key information. The [[djaradin]] plan to use suffused weapons to turn the tide of the battle.

We must dispatch their smiths and destroy their weapons. Targeting both will weaken and slow them. Then we will have time to consider our next move.

You will be in great danger on this mission. Take this. 

Throwing it onto enemies will temporarily put them to sleep. Use it so that you may avoid becoming overwhelmed in combat.

Good luck, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 10x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
Tread carefully, <name>. Igira will have your head if you are caught.

==Completion==
That will hamper their forces significantly.

==Notes==
[[Slagfell Hold]] is an elite area, but none of the enemies have truesight, so use [[Somnowl's Shroud]] from [[In and Out Scout]] to move around quietly, and the [[Dreamy Dust]] to sleep any errant enemies that aggro.

On return, Merithra has new gossip:
:[[Amirdrassil]] must be protected.

On complete of both:
:{{text|say|Merithra|Thank you, Bodwin. Your assistance has been vital to our victory.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|And yours, <name>, as always.}}

==Progression==
{{Eye of Ysera}}

==Patch changes==
