==Objectives==
Meet [[Faerin]] at [[Tenir's Ascent]] aboard the [[Dawnbreaker (airship)|Dawnbreaker]].

==Description==
It's critical, with so many [[nerubian]]s pouring through the [[Aegis Wall]], that we defend our [[Arathi airship|airships]] docked at [[Tenir's Ascent]].

The nerubians have always outnumbered us, but our fleet allows us to concentrate our defenders where they are attacking, as well as allowing us to bombard them from the safety of the skies.

If we lose our armada, our hopes fade dramatically. Meet us there when you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm glad you're with us, <name>.

Without our airships, we have little chance of holding back the nerubians in the long run.

To say nothing of our dockworkers, who are safe below deck.

Let's see to the defense.

==Notes==
