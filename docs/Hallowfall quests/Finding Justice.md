'''Finding Justice''' concludes the The Last Mage of Hallowfall optional chapter of the [[Hallowfall storyline]]. [[General Steelstrike]] starts the first quest in the chain, [[The Last Mage]], inside the church of [[Mereldar]].

==Objectives==
Track down [[Wenren Althal|Wenren]]'s killer.
* Trail followed (Optional)
* Wenren's killer found

==Description==
<The pieces fit together to form a simple, but dark picture.

The [[Order of Night]] did not want Wenren to create a portal back to [[Arathi Empire|the Empire]]. No doubt reinforcements and supplies would hinder their mission. 

So, someone stabbed him, burned his research, and smashed his tools. 

But with this Arcane Focus in hand, you can see a faint trail of arcane residue. Did some arcane dust get on the perpetrator? 

Follow the trail and find out.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Steelstrike listens to your story with growing concern.>

No! Dead?!

==Notes==
Follow the trail hither and yon to the west side of [[Beledar's Bounty]] to spot none other than [[Tefferty Ulreth]]:

{{dialogue|content=<Tefferty glances around.>

Can I help you?

:{{text|say|Tefferty Ulreth|Tracked me, have you? You won't live to tell the tale!}}

Defeat him:
:{{text|say|Tefferty Ulreth|The Order of Night... will prevail...}}

Head to the church in the northwest corner of [[Mereldar]] to turn in to [[General Steelstrike]].

On complete:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Oh, Wenren... I'm such a fool. We should have had faith in you. We should have offered you the protection due your cause.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|The Order of Nighfs cruelty is beyond words. And how many others hide in our midst? We must be more cautious.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Thank you, <name>, for your help. I'm sorry for this tragedy. I will see to it that Wenren's memory is honored.}}

If one returns to Althal's Lab they can see the body gone and [[Ol' Gail]] scrubbing the blood off the floor:
