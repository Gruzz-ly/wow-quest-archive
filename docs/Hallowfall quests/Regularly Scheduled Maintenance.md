==Objectives==
Take Orren's Message, 6 Crimson Charmer and 6 Amber Bloom to [[Aemyra]] at [[Velhan's Claim]].
* [[Orren's Message]] (provided)
* [[Crimson Charmer]] (6)
* [[Amber Bloom]] (6)

==Description==
I've got another problem that's a bit more... personal, <name>.

My girlfriend, Aemyra, is a [[Lamplighter]]. I thought she'd be back from her last mission, to Velhan's Claim, by now.

Could you go make sure she's okay, and deliver this message? I'm worried to the point of distraction.

Maybe you could also pick some of her favorite flowers, up that hill?

I'd go myself, but if I can get [[ELIZA]] working right, it would do so much to feed people in [[Hallowfall]]. And give me more time to spend with Aemyra, too!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
* 11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
These are from Orren? I think they go well together, even though they're so different.

==Completion==
Wow, that's really sweet of him. I'll be here for a while, dealing with the [[kobyss]], but I should send something back.

So he knows I'm safe, and that I can't wait to see him.

==Notes==
Orren has gossip:
{{dialogue|
These fields provide so much of Hallowfall's food. And one day soon, they'll do it without our help!

{{gossip|What do you like about Aemyra?}}

{{dialogue-child|
Aemyra is very caring--I love that. But many Arathi care for others, yet stay inside with their doors locked when the crystal goes dark.

But Aemyra is courageous to do and say what's needed, whether it's facing the darkness, or sharing a difficult truth for me to hear.

And...

{{gossip|Go on.}}

{{dialogue-child|
Well, I have a lot of big ideas. Dreams of what farming in Hallowfall could look like.

Most people aren't interested in hearing my ideas. But Aemyra listens.

More than that, she pokes at them where they don't make sense, and helps me make them better.

Honestly, I can't see wanting to spend my life with anyone else, <name>.

I think I'm going to ask her to marry me, once I've got ELIZA is working right.

{{gossip|Tell me about ELIZA.}}

{{dialogue-child|
I'm glad you asked! ELIZA stands for Efficient Labor Innovation for Zero-Error Agriculture! I do admit, the name is a bit forced, but I still like it! She'll be the first of her kind.

She'll be able to help with the hard work, like any harvest bot, but also avoid errors. We need to plant seeds at the right time, pull weeds without hurting the plant, chase off jawcrawlers or birds, harvest the crops at exactly the right time...

If I can get ELIZA fine-tuned properly to make all those decisions, then each of these farmhands you see can do other important jobs in Hallowfall, without anyone running short of food.

I'm getting close, but I still don't have the right balance in the tensor springs.

:{{text|say|Aemyra Acton|It's really hard to be in love with someone, when your calling pulls you in different directions.}}
