==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Skulldunk.png|Skulldunk|A congealed mass of bone and slime, animated by some unknown necromancy.}}

*[[Oskaer Daleclash's Tinderbox]]
*[[Dalian Ironlink's Tinderbox]]
*[[Idona Seerstone's Tinderbox]]
*Inquire with [[Addysen Wildbanner|Addysen]] about Idona (Optional)

==Description==
Since the [[Day of Shadows]] these lands have been a dangerous place.

The [[kobyss]] are emboldened, the [[nerubian]]s probe our lands, creatures of pure shadow have begun to manifest themselves.

The memory of those who have fallen is etched in our everyday lives. We must locate their remains to bring closure.

Search for the Tinderboxes of these missing expedition members and return them to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you located the tinderboxes?

==Completion==
These tinderboxes are but a small symbol of the immense loss we suffered on the Day of Shadows. We will recover the bodies you have located and begin to heal the memories of our loved ones.

==Notes==
One can inquire with [[Addysen Wildbanner|Addysen]] about Idona:
{{dialogue|
Stay vigilant and keep your blade at the ready. These fungal monstrosities show no sign of relenting.

{{gossip|quest=|I am looking for Idona Seerstone.}}

{{dialogue-child|
Idona? She was a good person.

She fell fighting the larger lashers here. I couldn't save her, and the fungus consumed her body.

Perhaps you could find some remains out in those fields, but be wary, don't meet her fate.
