==Objectives==
Gather 7 Light-Bathed Lotus in [[Hallowfall]].
* [[Light-Bathed Lotus Cuttings]] (7)

==Description==
Flames blessing to you, <name>.

Trade has been going well now the [[Ringing Deeps]] are safe once again and things have, relatively, calmed down. Despite that, our General still won't breathe easily. She's wound tight and it's not healthy. An unhealthy general leads to an unhealthy army. 

So a day with the family. Can you pick some herbs for the meal? You'll want the big ones, don't bother with the small ones.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Herbs bathed in the light of Beledar have a fantastic taste.

==Completion==
These will be wonderful, well done.

==Notes==
One can stay a while and listen to a conversation between [[Auralia Steelstrike]] and [[General Steelstrike]]:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|How are the children, quartermaster?}}
:{{text|say|Auralia Steelstrike|General. It would be inappropriate of me to let you know that they are doing well and look forward to their grandmother visiting for dinner.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Quite so, soldier. How are our stores?}}
:{{text|say|Auralia Steelstrike|Running very low on consecrated alchemy. The Priory missed its last shipment. I think they're hoarding.}}
:{{text|say|Auralia Steelstrike|I've sent over multiple official requests for an answer. They have ignored them all.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|I'll talk to the Prioress. We need those, else we'll have even more deaths on our hands.}}

Upon completing both quests go to [[Steelstrike Residence]] in Mereldar:
:{{text|say|Tara Steelstrike|Eep!}}
{{Dialogue|<Tara tried to hide behind the table as you approach. You hear General Steelstrike call from across the room.>

Tara, what do we say to guests?

<Tara peeks above the table.>

Hi.

<She quickly disappears again.>}}

Auralia's gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Auralia Steelstrike|Mother may be crabby at the moment, but wait until she gets cooking. She loves cooking.

Fair warning though, she's awful at it. Really bad. She has burnt a salad.

I'm still not sure how.}}

The general's gossip:
{{Dialogue|I've been told I have to "rest" and "relax."

I don't like it.}}
