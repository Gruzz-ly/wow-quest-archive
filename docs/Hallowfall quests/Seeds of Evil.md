==Objectives==
Collect Corrupted Shadowleaf Seeds.
* [[Corrupted Shadowleaf Seed]] (16)

==Description==
<Class>, some of the shadowleaf plants are more... wrong than the rest. I don't know how to describe it better.

My idiot brother, [[Tomothy Hillhelm|Tomothy]], was supposed to help me get rid of these, but I haven't seen him and I can't wait.

Clearly we don't want these to reproduce so I want you to cull as many as you can find, and then take their seeds. We'll burn those in holy fire to make sure we've cut off the infestation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you cull those plants?

==Completion==
Good job culling those plants. Now, if only my lazy brother would show up for work.

==Notes==
Completing this quest is a criterion in [[Life on the Farm]].

==Progression==
{{Lost in the Darkness}}
