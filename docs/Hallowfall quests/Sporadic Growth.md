Slay Gloomsprout and 15 Gloomgrowth using the Patrol Torch.

==Description==
Fungal growths are still spreading unchecked from the nearby [[Mycomancer Cavern|Mycomancers' cavern]]. The latest surge has sent all my recruits fleeing in fear.

I urgently need your skills in eliminating one troublesome fungal growth.

Take my Patrol Torch and eradicate Gloomsprout and the surrounding growths that sprouts from it. The torch should handle the smaller stuff, but Gloomsprout will require a more direct approach

*[[Lamplighter Supply Satchel]]

One-time warband bonus:
