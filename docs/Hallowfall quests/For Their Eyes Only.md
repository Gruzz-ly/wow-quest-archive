==Objectives==
Gather 3 [[nerubian]] [[Sureki Shadecaster (item)|Shadecasters]] to learn their plans.
* Shadecaster collected (3)

==Description==
We've fought the nerubians since we arrived, <name>. Their attacks have not risen to this level in a long time.

These airship docks are clearly a target, but do they have any others? Is there a larger goal?

The nerubians carry shadecasters with orders from [[Queen Ansurek|their queen]]. We need to learn what we can of their plans and intentions, and recovering a few of those shadecasters is the best way we can do so.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found any of those shadecasters yet, <name>?

==Completion==
Final war? Ascension? Not as many answers as questions, <name>. But we at least have some pieces of the puzzle.

==Notes==

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Faerin|Kyron, the [[dawntower]] isn't lit. If [[Beledar]] should shift...}}
:{{text|say|Great Kyron|You're right. Your new friends can protect the people. We must ignite the [[Sacred Flame]].}}
:''Faerin and Great Kyron run off.''

[[Sureki Shadecaster]] drops from most of the [[Direweb]] mobs. Upon looting one, an image of [[Queen Ansurek]] appears nearby:
*{{Text|say|Queen Ansurek|[[Azj-Kahet (kingdom)|Azj-Kahet]] will rise. Prove your worth. Earn your [[Ascended nerubian|Ascension]].}}
*{{Text|say|Queen Ansurek|The threads have been spun. They will get their fated [[Renilash|final war]].}}
*{{Text|say|Queen Ansurek|The tendrils of shadow are sinking into this land. Utilize their fear to strike them down!}}

Turn in to Anduin, still on the Dawnbreaker, who has gossip text:
{{Dialogue|It's amazing to see what the Arathi have been able to achieve in Hallowfall, in their years here, with no help from the outside.

They'll make strong allies.

And if we can protect the Dawnbreaker, I'm sure they'll be able to push back the nerubians.}}
