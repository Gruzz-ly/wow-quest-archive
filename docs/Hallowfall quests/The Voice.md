==Objectives==
Defend [[Orweyna]] as she meditates.

==Description==
Here is where I must focus. I can hear the voice of my goddess. And she must be near.

I will enter a meditation to ask what I must do. How can I continue this mission alone? How can I go on without the others?

Stay close. I don't know what may lurk or threaten while I am concentrating.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 5 [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
<Orweyna is unresponsive as she focuses entirely on her meditation.>

==Completion==
I understand.

We must go to where I can here the sounds of things moving beneath the stones, I don't know what it means, I only know that I must go there.

Will you go with me?
