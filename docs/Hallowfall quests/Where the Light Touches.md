==Objectives==
Meet with [[Faerin]]'s ally near the [[Aegis Wall]].
* [[Relief Cart|Ride with Faerin]] to the Aegis Wall (Optional){{Co|68.2|45.16|Hallowfall}}
* Arrive at the Aegis Wall

==Description==
Many in [[Hallowfall]] will call you "outsider". I would call you friend. I would also ask for your help, if you are no stranger to combat. Desperate times forge strong friendships.

[[General Steelstrike]] ordered [[Arathi Army|the army]] to fall back from the [[nerubian]] onslaught. In doing so, she abandoned a [[Lamplighter]] and many troops to the darkness. I may not be able to save them on my own, but with your help I may succeed.

If you're willing, ride with me or meet me there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Outsider! The nerubians took us by surprise. The army went into retreat when the wall was breached. I've been keeping them away from this tower, but I could certainly use your help.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Faerin|I'm Faerin, [[Lamplighter]] of Hallowfall. I have a relief cart prepped for the wall. Will you join me?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Anduin. I'm... an adventurer exploring [[Khaz Algar]] with my friend.}}

A nearby Relief Cart pulled by an [[Arathi Lynx]] lights up. Hop in it for exposition on the way to the Aegis Wall:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|That crystal--}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|Star. We call it a star. [[Beledar]], the "Emperor's Vision" of holy light.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|A vision of light... Deep under the ground.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|We're the Hallowfall expedition of the [[Arathi Empire]].}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|We followed our [[Emperor of the Arathi|emperor]]'s sacred vision across [[Storming Sea|the sea]] -- to fight in [[Renilash]], the final battle between light and dark.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|As we crossed the sea, we were caught in a storm. The fleet was... enveloped in golden radiance.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|In a flash, our entire armada was transported down here.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|You've been down here fighting the nerubians ever since?}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|I was just a child, the only child, when we were marooned. The nerubians have never ceased their hostility.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|They crawl up from [[Azj-Kahet|their kingdom]] seeking a fight and try to drag us down into the darkness.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|Steelstrike's army does well beneath Beledar's light. Those bugs are good at extinguishing hope.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|We Lamplighters have trained to charge into the darkness. We save those who are lost and keep the [[dawntower]]s lit.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|We're here.}}
:''The trio disembarks in front of the dawntower.''
:{{text|say|Faerin|Great Kyron! You're alive!}}
:{{text|say|Great Kyron|Faerin! Your courage acquits you well, young Lamplighter.}}

[[File:Where the Light Touches - end.jpg|thumb|Faerin, Anduin, and Kyron at the Aegis Wall.]]
At the Aegis Wall, characters have new gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Anduin Wrynn|This wall is impressive, yet the nerubians were able to overcome it. Will yet another human kingdom fall?

Not just a human kingdom, they seem to hail from both old [[Arathor]] and [[Quel'Thalas (kingdom)|Quel'Thalas]].  Much like [[Dalaran (kingdom)|Dalaran]]... was.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Faerin|It's hard to see the destruction here, knowing how well the wall has served us for so long. Hard to think about the soldiers who died defending it, and those that will die because we don't have this defensive advantage.

{{Gossip|Why don't you leave this place, Faerin?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Hallowfall is a holy place, <name>. Here we guard the Emperor's Vision, Beledar.

It is our faith in the [[Sacred Flame]] which prevents it from shifting forever into shadow.}}}}

{{Dialogue|title=Great Kyron|content=A Lamplighter will always accept an ally, <name>.

{{gossip|Who are you, Kyron?}}
{{Dialogue-child|I served the empire for many years before coming to Hallowfall, as a warden in our military.

When we first arrived in Hallowfall, I volunteered to lead a group in scouting the land. We found what areas were defensible, what was overrun by nerubians and the [[kobyss]], and laid a foundation for the defense of [[Mereldar]].

I found my calling late in life. Bound to a star of [[prophecy]], in an unlikely land beneath the ground.

And I would see all those that walk in the light of the Sacred Flame survive another day.

{{Gossip|I have another question.}}}}

{{gossip|Tell me about the Lamplighters.}}
{{Dialogue-child|It's not easy to face darkness you know is dangerous. That's even more true in a cave, <name>.

We Lamplighters are the ones who brave the darkness, to make sure Arathi dawntowers are lit and our people are safe.

We frequently have... strong disagreements with the military, but we're free to do what we believe we must.

We're few in number, to be sure, and our willingness to face the darkness in spite of our fears is seen as unusual.

But when a Lamplighter arrives, the Arathi's hopes grow brighter.

{{Gossip|I have another question.}}}}}}

==Alpha version==
{{Rfa-section}}
Anduin's dialogue at the Aegis Wall was different in the alpha version:
{{Dialogue|I'm glad to be back with [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]]. She blames herself for what happened to [[Dalaran]], but not as much as she blames the nerubians.

She wants to get vengeance, especially against their leaders, but I worry about the risks she might take to do so.}}
