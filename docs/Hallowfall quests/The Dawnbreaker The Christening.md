==Objectives==
Help the christening ceremony in the Dawnbreaker dungeon succeed.
*Defend the [[Dawnbreaker]]

==Description==
The flagship of the [[Arathi]] armada is the Dawnbreaker. She is a marvel of Arathi engineering and faith in the [[Sacred Flame]]. Her presence in the [[Hallowfall]] sky will help us push back the [[nerubian]]s when next they dare launch another assault on our lands.

As someone who has helped us so much in the past, you are cordially invited to the christening ceremony of the Dawnbreaker. If you could make sure it goes off without a hitch, you will have my personal gratitude.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 15,250 [[XP]]
*[[Airship Captain's Lost Pendant]]

One-time warband bonus:
*{{wb|repitem=Hallowfall Arathi Commendation|repamount=500|faction=Hallowfall Arathi|altqty1=25|altitem1=Resonance Crystals}}

==Progress==
The Dawnbreaker will cause problems for the nerubians once she is active. It is very important everything goes off without a hitch.

==Completion==
Well.

That went as well as could be expected for a ceremony in Hallowfall.

Thank you for being here.
