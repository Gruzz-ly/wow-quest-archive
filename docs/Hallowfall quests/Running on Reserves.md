==Objectives==
Assist 5 Arathi Reserves in [[Livia's Patience]] in [[Hallowfall]].
*[[Arathi Reserve|Reservists]] rescued (5)
*Meet your allies in Livia's Patience.

==Description==
We have to try to save any of our people left alive in Livia's Patience.

Every Arathi is or was a member of [[Arathi Army|the military]]. If you can help them, they'll be able to help themselves.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I managed to rescue a few, did you find people to rescue?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Between myself, Alleria, Anduin, and you, I think we managed to save quite a few.

The nerubians abducted many of the rest. We need to help them!

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Stalwarts! We are the wall today! Together we will stand against the darkness!}}
:''Steelstrike runs off along the docks.''
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|We need to evacuate the villagers before the Reckoning's bombardment.}}
:''Faerin, Anduin, and Alleria hop on mounts and fly off while Kyron stays on the ship.''

Down to the south. Reserves are standing in doorways to buildings and marked on the map, and Kaheti nerubians are everywhere.

Reserves will have one of the following gossip lines:
{{Dialogue|Flame take these Nerubians!

I haven't had time to put on my armor, I can only hold off so many.}}
{{Dialogue|Hah! This is not the day I thought I was going to have this morning.

If I can just get my armor on, I can fight my way out!}}
{{Dialogue|The backup is appreciated!

Can you buy me time to put on my armor?}}
:{{gossip|I'll buy you time.}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Reserve|I just need a moment!}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Reserve|They came so fast, I only had time to get my sword.}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Reserve|When I get my armor on, these Nerubians will pay!}}

Fend off a spawning [[Kaheti Fighter]] while the reserve runs inside and fetches their armor, after which they run off:
*{{text|say|Arathi Reserve|Flame bless you, outsider. I can fend for myself now, there might be others who need your help.}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Reserve|I can make my way to Light's Redoubt now. Thank you.}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Reserve|Now these Nerubians will feel my wrath! You have my thanks, stranger!}}

When both objectives are completed, the ''Reckoning'' appears next to the [[Patient Lake Inn]]:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Everyone is evacuated! The nerubians are massing for another assault! Fall back!}}

Catch up with Alleria, Faerin, and Anduin at the top of the stairs leading to the inn:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Quickly! Before the nerubians overwhelm us!}}
