'''Boot Camp''' introduces players to the daily Radiant or Sureki incursion quests also offered by [[Mylton Wyldbraun]] for the [[Flame's Radiance]] at [[Morgaen's Tears]] in southwestern [[Hallowfall]].

==Objectives==
Complete a Radiant Incursion or Sureki Incursion.
* Complete an Incursion quest

==Description==
The Sureki gather across [[Hallowfall]] and [[Azj-Kahet]] while we prepare for their attack on [[Mereldar]]. 

They want to split our forces, but we cannot ignore their activities elsewhere. The [[Flame's Radiance]] forces are defending against their incursions in Hallowfall while we run incursions of our own into Azj-Kahet. 

Rendezvous with the Flame's Radiance in the field and assist their efforts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 250 [[Resonance Crystals]]
* +200 reputation with [[Flame's Radiance]] (via [[Flame's Radiance (currency)]])

==Progress==
Every blow we can deal to the remaining Sureki weakens their efforts in Hallowfall. Please hurry!

==Completion==
Thank the Sacred Flame for your assistance. The war continues but at least the battle is won.
