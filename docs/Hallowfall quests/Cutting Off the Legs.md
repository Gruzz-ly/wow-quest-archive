==Objectives==
Slay the nerubian lieutenants.
*[[Nix'k the Wicked]] slain {{co|66.7|64.9|Hallowfall}}
*[[Kaz'vik]] slain {{co|67.9|67.5|Hallowfall}}
*[[Anub'ata]] slain {{co|64.7|68.5|Hallowfall}}

==Description==
While we've yet to locate [[Xal'atath]], we've received reports from deeper in the field of certain [[nerubian]]s giving orders. It won't buy us too much but every action is critical.

Take them out. Hopefully that will allow us some breathing room. 

Speak with [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] after you are done. He and the [[Arathi]] girl went after [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Speak with Anduin within the [[Sanguine Grasps]].

==Completion==
Oh, good, you made it.

==Notes==
The named targets are marked on the minimap. [[Kurdran Wildhammer]] assists with Nix'k, [[Lady Liadrin]] and [[Salandria]] assist with Kaz'vik, and [[Danath Trollbane]] with Anub'ata.

:{{text|yell|Danath Trollbane|The Sons of Lothar fight on the same battlefield once again! Taste the might of Stromgarde!}}

Once done with all three, head north, near the [[Skittering Breach]] delve to turn in to Anduin:
