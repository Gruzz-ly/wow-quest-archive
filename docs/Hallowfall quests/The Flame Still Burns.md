==Notes==
Faerin and Alleria:
{{Dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|The shadow always tries to corrupt.

It only works on the weak willed.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Faerin Lothar|By the Flame, that was close.

I'm glad it worked-- I mean, of course it worked, I knew it would.

Don't tell the General I said that.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Alleria... What happened?}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|For years I've held back the Void within me, worried I'd hurt my loved ones.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|When Dalaran fell I didn't draw on my power and someone dear to me paid the price.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Like [[Aelric Leid|Aelric]], Xal'atath thinks herself safe behind layers of shadow.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|She isn't. Not when I can turn their own power against her.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I will do all it takes to end her threat for good.}}

{{Dialogue|title=General Steelstrike|content=Aelric drove a wedge through the heart of the Arathi people.

We will root out his followers, his cult. We will burn it to the ground.

I will undo everything he has done.

{{gossip|How are you doing?}}}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|When I saw the depths of Aelric's betrayal, I lost hope. I retreated--Flames. The kobyss would have taken Mereldar.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Anduin Wrynn|By the Light...

That, that was incredible. I've never seen anything like it. The closest was [[Calia Menethil|Calia]]'s resurrection, but that...

So many people. One purpose, one unity.

One hope.

{{gossip|How are you doing?}}}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|What Faerin said... It got me thinking. Perhaps I've been wrong about what the Light wants from me?}}

Groups of [[Arathi Stalwart]]s are marked on the minimap. Pick either option to have them move to the Eternal Flame:
{{Dialogue|You should have seen it, we took so many kobyss down!

Sure we took a few flesh wounds, but the Flame preserved us, and let us carve a bloody swathe through them!

{{gossip|The only good kobyss is a dead kobyss.}}<br>
{{gossip|Well done on surviving.}}}}
:{{text|say|Arathi Stalwart|Hah! You just have to kill them before they kill you!}}
:{{text|say|Arathi Stalwart|We'll head to the Eternal Flame. Meet you at the next fight eh?}}

{{Dialogue|I... Flames, they were raising our dead.

I had to kill my sister, after watching her get cut down by those monsters.

{{gossip|That sounds awful. I'm so sorry.}}<br>
{{gossip|You had no choice.}}}}
:{{text|say|Arathi Stalwart|We do what we have to. We always do what we have to to survive.}}
:{{text|say|Arathi Stalwart|We'll head to the Eternal Flame. The Arathi endure.}}

{{Dialogue|We got dinged up pretty bad by the kobyss. Lost a few friends.

Killed lots of kobyss though. So there's positives.

{{gossip|You did well.}}<br>
{{gossip|I'm sorry you lost friends.}}}}
:{{text|say|Arathi Stalwart|Nothing that hasn't happened before. Nothing that won't happen again.}}
:{{text|say|Arathi Stalwart|Thanks for checking on us. We'll meet you at the Eternal Flame.}}

{{Dialogue|The Veneration Grounds have been despoiled. Ruined.

Where do we go from here? If they can strike at our most sacred places, how long before they come for the rest of us?

{{gossip|You're alive. That's a start.}}<br>
{{gossip|The Arathi are survivors. You'll pull through this.}}}}
:{{text|say|Arathi Stalwart|You're right. We've survived worse, and we will again.}}
:{{text|say|Arathi Stalwart|Come on troops, we rally at the Eternal Flame!}}

{{Dialogue|By the Flame that was close.

If those Kobyss had broken through to Mereldar, who knows what would have happened!

{{gossip|You held the line.}}<br>
{{gossip|You fought to keep those you love safe.}}}}
:{{text|say|Arathi Stalwart|We are the Empire's Might! We are the Wall!}}
:{{text|say|Arathi Stalwart|We'll head to the Eternal Flame. Troops move out!}}

[[File:The Flame Still Burns.jpg|thumb|Stalwarts lined up before the Eternal Flame.]]
On return to the Eternal Flame, the Stalwarts have lined up in formation in front of Faerin, Steelstrike, Anduin, and Alleria:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Arathi, friends, the Flame blesses us with victory. Your courage against the dark has saved the day.}}

On completion of both:
:''[[Regald Hornfyre]] runs up.''
:{{text|say|Regald Hornfyre|General, the nerubians! They've opened a new front at Light's Redoubt!}}
