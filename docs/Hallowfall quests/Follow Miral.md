==Description==
[[Tomothy Hillhelm|Tomothy]]'s [[Imperial lynx|lynx]], Miral, has been bugging me. I don't know what she wants but it is unusual to see her without my brother. She's a great [[farm]] cat, but she's still a cat, so maybe she's just bored with Tomothy today? I don't know. Maybe Tomothy got into some sort of trouble.

Can you find out what is bothering her for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}

==Progress==
<Miral looks at you as if expecting something. You are being judged.>

==Completion==
<Miral lets out a pleased sound and purrs at you.>

==Notes==
Follow Miral as she leads you to items belonging to Tomothy and then finally to [[Isaec's Folly]].
