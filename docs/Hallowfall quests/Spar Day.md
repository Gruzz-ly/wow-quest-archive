==Objectives==
Duel 8 [[Arathi Reserve|Recruits]]{{Sic}} in [[Mereldar]].
* Duel Arathi Recruits{{Sic}} (8)

==Description==
Your skills in combat are impressive, <name>.

We are rotating our next round of reserves into active duty, and they need to sharpen their skills.

While [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] fills me in on [[Xal'atath]], I would appreciate it if you could help with their training.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The tricks they learn from you today will help them survive a difficult encounter later.

==Completion==
Thank you.

What they learnt from you will no doubt save their lives later.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|[[Auralia Steelstrike|Auralia]], send a runner to [[Faerin Lothar|Faerin]]'s new elf friend. We need to talk.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Faerin tells me your friend wields the [[Void]].}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|I'm either going to regret meeting her or thank the Flame.}}

Speak with any [[Arathi Reserve]]:
{{Dialogue|It is an honor to serve the Arathi people.

{{Gossip|Your general asked me to spar with you.}}}}
Aggro:
*{{text|say|Arathi Reserve|Come. Let me learn from you.}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Reserve|I am blessed by Beledar. I won't be beaten!}}
*{{Text|say|Arathi Reserve|I can see you are strong. Teach me.}}
*{{Text|say|Arathi Reserve|If the general thinks you are good, you must be really good!}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Reserve|Let's see if you fight better than an Arathi!}}
*{{Text|say|Arathi Reserve|My skills with a blade are unmatched!}}

Shortly after entering combat, they'll sometimes cheat and have another nearby Reserve join them in battle:
*{{text|say|Arathi Reserve|Twice the fight, twice the glory!}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Reserve|Maybe two on one can provide you with a challenge!}}
*{{Text|say|Arathi Reserve|The nerubians often fight two on one!}}

Defeat:
*{{text|say|Arathi Reserve|Wow, that was instructional. Thank you!}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Reserve|I yield! Light of the Flame, you don't pull your punches!}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Reserve|Hah, ow. Thank you, I learned a lot from that!}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Reserve|I still have all my extremities. Given how you fight, I'll consider that a win!}}
*{{Text|say|Arathi Reserve|Ooph! You'd give [[Great Kyron]] a run for their money!}}
*{{Text|say|Arathi Reserve|I can see why the general wanted you to spar with us. Well played!}}

[[File:Spar Day.jpg|thumb|Alleria, Auralia, and the general.]]
On return, Alleria has arrived:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|The Harbinger is from the [[Black Empire]]? Flames... One of the [[Old God]]s?}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|No. Something else. A survivor from the depths of time.}}

On complete, General Steelstrike has a new {{gossip|<Stay a while and listen.>}} gossip option:
:''Steelstrike starts walking out onto the wall to look up at Beledar.''
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Walk with me for a bit, outsider. I assume Faerin has told you of how we came to this strange land.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|"[[Emperor of the Arathi|The Emperor]]'s Vision", a prophecy of light, battle, and victory for the Arathi and the Sacred Flame.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|I was newly raised to my position. Being entrusted to seek out an imperial prophecy was a great honor.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Our armada braved the [[Storming Sea]] and its impassable tempests. I thought that final storm was sure to scuttle every airship.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Instead there was a radiant flash. The Emperor's Vision, exactly as he had foreseen.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|The light transported us beneath the surface of Azeroth, but still under the light of this star we named Beledar.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|So many died as the armada crashed into the cliffs. We thought the [[Eternal Flame]] of Arathor snuffed out that day.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Then as we labored to rescue this stowaway child, Faerin, we discovered that she had preserved embers of the flame, at risk to her own life.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Brave fool. Yet I'm eternally grateful that she held on to that symbol of hope. Don't tell her I said that.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Years later, there was a great rumble. We thought the cavern was going to collapse. It was the [[Day of Darkness]], the first time Beledar shifted to shadow.}}
:''Steelstrike starts walking back to the barracks.''
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|We had put down roots by then, my soldiers left to make homes for themselves. They started families. Flames help me, there are children now.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|I've had too many years of defending against the monsters that go bump in the night. Great Kyron and their [[Lamplighter]]s guided us through the darkness.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|But like Faerin, they mistake saving for safeguarding. My people are brave and strong, but they are not all Flame-blessed heroes.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|I know exactly how many soldiers we lose to the dark. If we play it safe, we might survive long enough for me to put my grandchildren on the front line.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|I welcome you, outsider. I hope your people's arrival, and the earthen's reunification means better days for Mereldar.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|But I fear we have just made ourselves a bigger target for the dark.}}
