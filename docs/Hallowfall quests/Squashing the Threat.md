==Objectives==
Remove 10 Shadow-Sour Squash and slay 8 Shadow-Sour Mites.
* [[Shadow-Soured Squash]] removed (8)
* [[Shadow-Sour Mite]] slain (10)

==Description==
I need your help!

The massive Shadow-Soured squash have begun to grow all over the place. They're stinky and crawling with nasty mites.

Mom and Dad brought in some airships to help us yank them out, but it's risky business with all those bugs.

Can you attach ropes to these Shadow-Soured Squash, and the airships can then haul them away without making a mess?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Hallowfall Arathi Commendation]] (+200 [[reputation]] with [[Hallowfall Arathi]]) (first time) or 40x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
Have you removed all the Squash?

==Completion==
You did it! I heard stories of one time the squash was so heavy the airship crashed! Glad that didn't happen.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Elmo Seedheart|I want to watch!}}

When one of the squash is removed:
*{{text|say|Elmo Seedheart|Do you eat squash?}}
*{{text|say|Elmo Seedheart|Fly away squash!}}
*{{text|say|Elmo Seedheart|I banish you squash!}}
*{{text|say|Elmo Seedheart|I want to fly those airships, and take all the squash away!}}
*{{text|say|Elmo Seedheart|Watch out for bugs.}}

Completing this quest is a criterion of [[Beacon of Hope]].
