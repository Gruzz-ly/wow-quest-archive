==Objectives==
Collect 8 Lost Personal Effects from enemies in the [[Harrowing Depths]].
* [[Lost Belongings]] (8)

==Description==
There was a time when I would have known what words to say to help her.

But now... they are as lost to me as everything else.

<Anduin sighs.>

There must be something we can do. Her old [[Lamplighter]] companion, this [[Andari]]... would have had one of those [[tinderbox]]es, right? They seem important for funeral rites. I'll accompany [[Faerin Lothar|Faerin]] back to [[Mereldar]] and meet you there. If you think there's hope of finding Andari's lost belongings... could you try to look?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
There's no time to mourn. Not when there's fighting to be done. If you have time to mourn, you have time to train.

To make sure we don't lose anyone else.

==Completion==
You found their things? In all the darkness?

Thank you.

And this, this is...

==Notes==

On accept, Faerin and Anduin walk up the stairs and despawn.

:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Oh no, I'm not ratting anyone out.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|But there are people worried about you. They care.}}

Lost Belongings drop from wildlife in the Harrowing Depths in the form of [[Broken Trinket]], [[Engraved Dagger (quest item)]], and [[Game Piece]]. Return to Mereldar, where Faerin and Anduin are waiting in the [[Lamplighter Headquarters]]. On completion:

:{{Text|say|Faerin Lothar|It's for a game many [[Arathi]] here play, [[Light's Gambit]]. When we lost pieces, Andari and I started to make our own. It's... it's just a hobby.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|It's a board game? How do you play? I've enjoyed a few myself.}}
