==Objectives==
Find 9 Salamanther Hearts in [[Rumshackle]].
* [[Salamanther Heart (Hallowfall)]] (9)

==Description==
;Normal
:For many years, the only non-[[Arathi]] we ever saw in [[Hallowfall]] were trying to kill us. [[Nerubian]]s, shadow creatures, beasts. So, forgive me if I view your sudden arrival with suspicion.

:However, my [[Lerrenai Fayn|better half]] would urge me to be more welcoming... and I want to try to be better. For her.

:Some of the [[salamanther]]s in Rumshackle have been bothering us. Kill them and bring me proof.

;To [[Undead (playable)|undead]], [[void elf (playable)|void elves]], [[death knight]]s, [[demon hunter]]s, [[Priest#Shadow|Shadow priests]], and [[warlock]]s
:The [[Arathi Empire]] is one founded on faith, in both the [[Emperor of the Arathi|Emperor]] and the [[Light]]. If my elder ever saw the sorts of things you practice, he would urge me to strike you down where you stand.

:Still, my better half would urge me to be more welcoming. That we must rely on each other to survive here.

:I want to be a better man. For her.

:Some of the salamanthers in Rumshackle have been bothering us. Kill them and bring me proof.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 11,150 [[XP]]
*{{wb|repitem=Hallowfall Arathi Commendation|repamount=500|faction=Hallowfall Arathi|altqty1=25|altitem1=Resonance Crystals}}

You will receive one from:
*[[Wine-Dyed Leggings]]
*[[United Arathi's Jerkin]]
*[[Salamanther-Scale Greaves]]
*[[Derill's Unused Visor]]

==Progress==
Others may be satisfied with just your word that you have done what I'd ask.

I am not.

==Completion==
;Normal
:You have helped.

:Perhaps she is right, and perhaps I should follow the example set by [[Dunelle]].

:Thank you.

;To [[Undead (playable)|undead]], [[void elf (playable)|void elves]], [[death knight]]s, [[demon hunter]]s, [[Priest#Shadow|Shadow priests]], and [[warlock]]s
:Oh. You did it.

:[[Elder Fraink]] would say that you are trying to lull me into a false sense of hope. Those are the sorts of tactics you would use.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Derill Fayn|I don't trust you any further than I could throw you, <name>.}}

If the player character is an [[Undead (playable)|undead]], [[void elf (playable)|void elf]], [[death knight]], [[demon hunter]], [[Priest#Shadow|Shadow priest]], or [[warlock]], he instead says:
:{{Text|say|Derill Fayn|Once a creature of darkness, always a creature of darkness.}}

The salamanthers are in the same area as the barrels for [[For Morale]]. Completing both quests rewards the "Suspicious Neighbors" criterion of [[Sojourner of Hallowfall]]. Undead, void elves, death knights, demon hunters, Shadow priests, and warlocks get a follow-up quest, [[Prove One's Mettle]].

==Progression==
