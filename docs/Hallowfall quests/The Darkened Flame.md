==Objectives==
[[File:Darkfire.jpg|thumb|The Darkfire in the Cliffside Beacon.]]
Investigate the darkened [[dawntower]].
* [[Darkfire]] investigated
* Clues found outside the tower (4)
* Return to [[Faerin Lothar|Faerin]]{{Co|56.28|41.97|Hallowfall}}

==Description==
This... [[Order of Night]], as they call themselves, did some foul ritual to turn the tower's flame to darkness. I know not what.

We should investigate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|11|70}}
*5,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
My own people... how could they?

<Faerin shakes her head in disbelief.>

==Completion==
So, they killed [[Kelther Hearthen|Kelther]], too?

<Faerin squeezes her eyes shut and mouths a prayer and a curse at the same time.>

We'll make sure he gets a proper funeral. The Order of Night will pay for this.

We sealed off [[Gloomcrag Bower|Gloomcrag]], the nearby cave, years ago. They must have dug their way in so they could target this dawntower.

How long have they been planning this? How long has the Order of Night been among our ranks?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|The Flame is corrupted! Can we restore it?}}
:''Faerin, Alleria, and Anduin all run in and look at the Darkfire.''

Interact with the [[Darkfire]] and Faerin starts channeling the [[Light]] at it:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|This... shadow! It's too much--!}}
:''Alleria walks over to Anduin.''
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Anduin, help her. Call upon the Light once more.}}
:{{text|emote|Faerin glances at Anduin in surprise.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I...}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|--no. I can't. There must be another way.}}
:''Faerin stops her channeling, walks over and kneels down next to some rubble.''

After the script event, Anduin and Alleria have new gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Anduin Wrynn|<Anduin stares into the dark flames, mouth a hard line.>

I should have-- I--

<He shakes his head.>

I can almost taste it. The Light... it's right there, at the tip of my fingers.

But I just can't reach for it.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|Stay sharp. Something evil happened here.}}

Outside, from north to south, are an [[Order of the Night Polearm]] at {{Co|56.31|40.65|Hallowfall}} next to a [[Glooming Shadow]]:
{{book|content=<The polearm has faint sigils carved into the haft. They have been torn and changed, forming new shapes.

They pulse with dark energy.>}}

The corpse of [[Kelther Hearthen]] at {{Co|55.94|42.02|Hallowfall}}:
{{Dialogue|<The wounds on the body form a ritualistic pattern. This poor soul was not only killed, but sacrificed to the darkness.>

{{gossip|quest=|<Wish his spirit well.>}}}}

[[File:Order of Night Poster.jpg|thumb|[[Order of Night Poster]].]]
An [[Order of Night Poster]] at {{Co|55.38|42.02|Hallowfall}} with another Glooming Shadow channeling something at it:
{{book|content=My friends,

We have lived in fear long enough.

Beledar has been trying to show us the way.

The Light has forsaken us. In the Light's glare, are all watched. Exposed.

In the darkness, we are free. We are afraid of the dark only because the Light wants us to be.

Beledar has shown us the way. No more fear.

Instead, we must become fear.

[[File:Order of Night Journal.jpg|thumb|[[Order of Night Journal]].]]
And an [[Order of Night Journal]] at {{Co|54.72|43.04|Hallowfall}}:
{{book|content=<The journal is heavily scratched out and torn up. Few segments remain.>

[[Tabita]],

I'm leaving. I'm tired. I don't expect you to understand.

The Order of Night gathers strength. They hide in caves, in towns, and linger with our greatest enemies.

They even have a base beneath one of their precious towers. The army has no idea.

The Light has made us all blind.

Not me. Not anymore.
----
What have we fought for this whole time? Why are we here?

Does Beledar even know we exist? Does it love us for our devotion?

Or does it hate us for holding it back? What if its true form is darkness?

We've toiled in the Light for years. What good has it done?

We die. Picked off in the shadows, one by one.

Perhaps we should listen to what Beledar is trying to tell us. There's comfort, in the shadows.

I'm tired, Tabita.

I know what this means. I know we will end up hurting our own. Hurting you.
----
I'm not sorry.
