==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Vaelisia Steelstrike|I'll meet you there, <name>.}}

Upon reaching the [[Arathi Infirmary]]:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|After each battle, I come here to assist Kaeleb at the infirmary. He can always use an extra pair of hands, and I can see the price each conflict extracts.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|You've been a great help already. If you could assist Kaeleb, I would appreciate it. The darkness takes a heavy toll on us all.}}
:{{text|say|Kaeleb Flamegard|I have some spare bandages.}}

The injured soldiers say:
{{Dialogue|I... actually don't mind it here really. Kaeleb is pretty nice, and I don't hate not being in constant peril.}}

{{Dialogue|Do you think you could smuggle me a pie from the inn? I love their pies.

Going to be the first thing I do when I get out, eat so many pies I pass out!}}

{{Dialogue|Kaeleb says I'm not allowed to lift weights while in bed. How am I supposed to keep my strength up?}}

{{Dialogue|I took a nerubian spine to my knee.}}

{{Dialogue|Do you have any word from the front? How is it going?}}

{{Dialogue|I thought there was nothing worse than waiting around for the next Nerubian attack.

But not knowing if there is already another Nerubian attack and I'm not there to help is much, much worse.}}

{{Dialogue|I managed to wiggle my toes earlier!}}

Pick up a [[Cobbled Together Bandage]] or use heal on one of the [[Injured Soldier (Hallowfall)|Injured Soldiers]]:
:{{Text|say|Injured Soldier|Oh wow, that even fixed my busted knee, thanks!}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|We lose so many at the wall. But without it, the nerubians raid the settlements.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Their strategy vexes me. Their only goal seems to be the fight itself.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|If they open a new front, I fear it would be our end.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|I can take it from here. You should get some downtime at the inn while you can. We need you fresh for the next crisis.}}

Keleb's gossip after:
{{Dialogue|Thank you for your help, <name>.

I know you are busy, I can take it from here for the day.}}
