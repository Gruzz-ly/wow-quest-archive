==Objectives==
Collect garlic for the chef.
* Garlic collected
* [[Secret Garlic|More garlic than that collected]] (6)

==Description==
Normally, this would do. I'm not so picky. But you're a guest. So we'll need some garlic.

I found some growing on a hill not far off. Shouldn't be there. But it is.

Too bad hydras found it, too.

You have weapons and such, right?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You think that's enough?

==Completion==
Ahh, there we go. That is enough garlic.

==Notes==
Upon grabbing one garlic:
:{{text|say|Dolena|You better not just be grabbing one bulb of garlic over there! Please bring back a reasonable amount of garlic.}}

Completing the quest also awards the "The Mysterious Chef" criterion of [[Sojourner of Hallowfall]].

==Progression==
