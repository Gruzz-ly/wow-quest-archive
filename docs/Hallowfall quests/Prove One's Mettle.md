'''Prove One's Mettle''' is a quest exclusive to [[Undead (playable)|undead]], [[void elf (playable)|void elves]], [[death knight]]s, [[demon hunter]]s, [[Priest#Shadow|Shadow priests]], and [[warlock]]s, offered after completing [[Suspicious Minds]].

==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Coalesced Iniquity.jpg|Coalesced Iniquity|A roiling manifestation of darkness in Hallowfall.}}
Defeat the Coalesced Iniquity in [[Rumshackle]].
* [[Coalesced Iniquity]] slain{{Co|62.4|38|Hallowfall}}

==Description==
Yes, you helped us out with these pests, but it is not enough. I need more.

One of the areas near [[Dunelle's Kindness|our town]] has been overrun by shadow. If you are truly not being controlled by your... strange background, you would have no problem destroying the source of this danger, would you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If you are truly here to help the [[Arathi]], you would have no problem with what I am asking of you.

==Completion==
I have been following the [[Church of the Sacred Flame]] since the moment I was born. Doctrine is hard to set aside.

But I see now that you are here to help. And as long as you use your powers for us, I will reach out a hand of friendship--regardless of where that power came from.

==Notes==
The Iniquity is in [[Rumshackle]].{{Co|62.4|38|Hallowfall}} On approach, Derill appears and accompanies the player to help them in combat.
:{{Text|say|Derill Fayn|I did not believe you would show up! I'm glad. We fight shoulder to shoulder, stranger.}}

Kill it:

Derill walks some distance south and kneels down.{{Co|62.75|38.8|Hallowfall}} His gossip text:
{{Dialogue|I underestimated you.

I still have much to learn, it seems.}}

Upon turning in to him, he stands up and [[Lerrenai Fayn|Lerrenai]] appears and runs over to her husband.
:{{Text|say|Derill Fayn|I will tell the others that you can be trusted. Thank you for your help.}}
:{{Text|say|Lerrenai Fayn|So this is where you went, old man?}}
:{{Text|say|Derill Fayn|<Name> helped me clear the evil that was gathered here. Maybe...}}
:{{Text|say|Lerrenai Fayn|It's a new world for you and me, Derill. Come on, let's go back home.}}
:{{Text|say|Derill Fayn|... Yeah. Home.}}

They walk back in the direction of [[Dunelle's Kindness]] and despawn after a couple steps.
