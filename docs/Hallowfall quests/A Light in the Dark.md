* Defeat Xal'atath

==Description==
Something is very wrong. As the battle continues, each side has become more aggressive.

[[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] seems to know something - she ran off at one point during the battle. We've been giving chase, but I cannot leave these soldiers to die. She's just ahead, we can reconvene with her together.

*[[Drape of the Lamplighter]]
*{{cost|10|80|50}}
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
[[Khadgar]] will need immediate help. We will have time for celebrations later.

==Notes==
After accepting the quest, speak with Anduin:
{{Dialogue|
Alleria knows something we don't. She's been distracted this entire battle.

Let me know when you're ready to catch up with her.

An [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cutscene]] plays before entering the scenario.
{{#ev:youtube|6b-cAQKAz1Y|Whisper on the Wall}}

''Exterior, the Sanguine Grasps. The adventurer, Anduin Wrynn, and Faerin Lothar are watching Turalyon and Alleria Windrunner fight off nerubians in the distance. With laborious battle cries, Turalyon keeps fending off enemies with his greatsword as Alleria fires off bow shots. As she prepares to fire off another shot, she stops, hearing an unexpected voice.''

{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|Alleria...}}

''Alleria lowers her bow and looks around, confused.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Khadgar?}}

{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|This isn't... the real fight...}}

''Alleria uses her powers to peer into [[The Unseeming]], feels the ground with her hand, and senses the [[Black Blood]] running through it headed in the direction of the [[Priory of the Sacred Flame]]. She gasps, shocked.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|The Black Blood... it's all around us.}}

''With another grunt, Turalyon sinks his sword into another nerubian, trying to catch his breath. Alleria fires off another shot and runs up to Turalyon.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Turalyon. I... I have to go.}}

''Turalyon pulls his sword from a slain nerubian as he turns to face Alleria in confusion.''

{{text|bossemote|High Exarch Turalyon|What? The battle is about to turn!}}

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|We've played right into Xal'atath's hands. But I know where she is. And I'm going to stop her.}}

{{text|bossemote|High Exarch Turalyon|I'm coming with you!}}

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|I know you would.}}

''Alleria smiles at Turalyon, who smiles in return.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|But your place is here. I need you to trust me.}}

''After a moment of consideration, Turalyon looks into Alleria's eyes and nods in agreement. They turn as Faerin, Anduin, and the adventurer arrive from the rear.''

{{text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|We'll be right with her.}}

''Turalyon and Alleria share a look.''

{{text|bossemote|High Exarch Turalyon|Come back to me.}}

''Alleria gently places her hand upon Turalyon's chest, and smiles sweetly at him.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|I always do.}}

''The party head off to find Xal'atah. Turalyon turns around, looking for his next target.''

On the other side of the cutscene, the scenario begins, atop the ''Dawnbreaker'' docked at the [[Priory of the Sacred Flame]].

===Bumps in the Dark===
''Light the [[Corrupted Flame|braziers]] and push back the initial darkness.''
*South Brazier lit
*North Brazier lit
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|This oppressive darkness. I can barely see beyond the airship's flame.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|In my heart there is fire. A beacon in the dark.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Xal'atath is here. I can sense her. We need to hurry.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|But first we must find a way to light our path.}}

On the Dawnbreaker, Faerin Lothar, the adventurer, Anduin Wrynn, and Alleria windrunner are standing, looking at the Priory of the Sacred flame, wreathed in darkness.

Players are both buffed and debuffed with:
:{{abilities|Consecrated Ground|Holy flames protect you from the encroaching darkness.|notes=Also heals for 5% health every 3 sec.}}
:{{abilities|Void's Embrace|The darkness slowly grows.}}

Additionally, a bar, Hope, drains while away from the light:
:{{abilities|Hope|Xal'atath's darkness grows ever closer. Spending too much time outside the light will force you to retreat.}}

Head west ashore and push to the southern brazier. Targets will be obscured by the shadow, so make sure to be close to them in order to attack. Xal'atath will taunt along the way:
:{{text|say|Xal'atath|Keep struggling. Let your emotions run. Every moment of defiance charges the air around you and feeds me.}}

Additionally, below 40% hope, an extra action button may appear:
:{{abilities|Call for Aid|Call for Faerin to consecrate the ground with holy flame, creating an area which temporarily drives back the darkness.}}
*{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|I will bring light to the darkness!}}
*{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|The Sacred Flame protects us!}}
*{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|To me!}}

As the ability finishes:
*{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|The darkness saps my strength...}}
*{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|I can't keep that up for long...}}
*{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|<Huff>... I'll need a moment to recover.}}

At the south brazier, guarded by [[Nightcaller Velys]], Faerin drops to one knee and begins channeling her magic to relight the brazier.
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|There - we should be able to purify that flame.}}

Interact with it to summon some enemies.

While channeling she may be interrupted by an enemy.
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|I can't keep that up for long...}}

At the north brazier, guarded by [[Hazzk the Ascended]], Anduin takes charge, while faerin once again channels her magic to relight the brazier.
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|We'll cover you Faerin. Focus on the brazier!}}

===Deeper into the Dark===
''Kill the Shadesworn Crusher.''
*[[Shadesworn Crusher]] slain
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|The Priory has a lightwell in the middle of the courtyard. No doubt it has been tainted.}}

With both braziers lit, head towards the [[Sanctified Grounds]] of the central courtyard. As the party enters, Xal'atath continues her taunting:
:{{text|say|Xal'atath|Even the Light burns with your rage as your carry candles into a starless night.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|It is not rage, but hope that guides the way. Dawn is ever on the horizon, Harbinger!}}

Engage the Shadesworn Crusher that sits at the very center of the courtyard:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|The Sacred Flame protects us!}}

Finish it off.

===Beacon for the Lost===
''Cleanse the Holy Oilwell.''
*[[Oil Brazier|Holy Oilwell]] cleansed
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|The courtyard is clear! Purify the well!}}

Interact with the Holy Oilwell to have Faerin cleanse it. This removes the Void's Embrace debuff and Hope bar.

===Longest Shadow===
''Kill the Broken Queen.''
*[[The Broken Queen|Broken Queen]] slain

After cleansing the well, the Broken Queen appears in the party's path to the Priory.
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|The darkness has receeded! Hurry, to the Priory!}}
:{{text|yell|The Broken Queen|Darkness... calls...!}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Wait, what is that!?}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|All the remains of Queen Neferess.}}

As players near the Broken Queen, Xal'atath whispers one of four things depending on the character's past actions:
;Obtained [[Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire]] and completed [[His Eye Upon You]]
:{{text|whisper|Xal'atath|After we shared so much, you simply threw me away. I will savor the taste of your insanity. Just let go.}}
;Obtained Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire but not His Eye Upon You
:{{text|whisper|Xal'atath|Yes, bring your 'allies' to me, my blade. Drive them to the brink! For you have become the weapon that I now wield.}}
;Completed His Eye Upon You
:{{text|whisper|Xal'atath|I told you that you were destined for great things. Rejoice, for you have aided the end of all things.}}
;None of the above
:{{text|whisper|Xal'atath|Your world is dying. Breathe deep and accept that you have caused your end.}}

Engage the Broken Queen:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Monster! May your soul be judged by the Flame!}}
:{{text|say|The Broken Queen|My people... shrouded... in pain...}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Something's wrong...}}
:{{text|say|The Broken Queen|No more! Darkness... pain... No more!}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|She's fighting against her will...}}

===Harbinger's End===
''Enter the Priory.''
* Enter the Priory

After the Broken Queen's defeat, Alleria leads the way into the Priory, while Faerin stays outside to cover them.
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Xal'atath is just ahead! After me!}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Go! I'll hold the line!}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|In the very heart of shadow I will be the shield that guards the way!}}

Enter the Priory to start a pre-rendered in-game cutscene:
{{#ev:youtube|zJjlgj_IdT8|Confronting Xal'atath}}

''Interior, the Priory of the Sacred Flame. Dark, dramatic music plays as Alleria quietly walks through the main chamber. In the center of the window, Xal'atath is floating, focused on Beledar and channeling it with her back turned.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|You know, Alleria, you mortals are the most wrathful creatures in existence.}}

''Xal'atath briefly turns her head to acknowledge Alleria.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|I've watched you break worlds, overthrow gods. Even the realm of death couldn't hold you. Your hunger for violence is insatiable.}}

''A close-up shows Xal'atath channeling energy into the Dark Heart, and Alleria's determined look changes to one of realization and anger.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|You lured us here, unleashed us upon the Nerubians.}}

''Alleria's mind replays key moments from the events of [[Visions of Azeroth]].''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|All to fuel the Black Blood's power. My power.}}

''Alleria narrows her gaze as she nocks an arrow on her bowstring.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|This stops now.}}

''Xal'atath cackles and glances back towards Alleria.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Your determination delights me. But I have risen from the ashes of countless empires.}}

''Xal'atath stops channeling into the Dark Heart and turns to face Alleria. Alleria aims her bow.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|I have survived ordeals you cannot comprehend. You cannot kill me.}}

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|I'm not aiming at you.}}

''The music stops. Alleria rotates her hand 90 degrees and fires her arrow with a clank. Suddenly realizing Alleria's true target, Xal'atath attempts to evade the arrow and protect the Dark Heart, but fails. Dramatic music plays as the arrow strikes the Dark Heart, cracking it, and causing it to leak energy.''

''Xal'atath roars in displeasure as she surrounds herself with swirling energy and teleports away.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|This changes nothing!}}

''From the lingering portal, a raven, heavily injured, struggles to fly itself with a squawk before landing hard on the ground before Alleria. It shifts to reveal Khadgar with a flash! The music softens. Realizing, Alleria runs to him.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Khadgar! Oh no.}}

''Alleria drops to her knees and cradles Khadgar in her arms.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|No. No, no, no! I heard your voice.}}

''Melancholic music plays as Anduin Wrynn slowly approaches from behind with concern.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|This can't be.}}

''Khadgar coughs wheezily, opens his eyes, and breathlessly speaks.''

{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|You... did well.}}

''Khadgar coughs again.''

{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|I knew... you... would stop her.}}

''Khadgar's eyes fall closed and his head rolls back.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Stay with me, Khadgar. Don't let go.}}

''Khadgar's body goes limp and his arm falls to the floor. Alleria feels his body go limp as she breathes shakily, then lays upon his chest and sobs briefly before sighing. Anduin looks on with sadness, before looking up to see [[Beledar]] turn to Light outside through the window. Soft ethereal choral music associated with the Light and Stormwind plays.''

''Anduin thinks for a moment before closing his eyes while basking in the Light, then opens his eyes and turns to Khadgar with a look of understanding. Anduin places his left hand on Alleria's right shoulder while she continues to lay upon Khadgar's chest. Surprised at the touch, she looks at Anduin as he places his right hand upon Khadgar's chest, closes his eyes, and focuses. Alleria looks on in shock as she realizes what Anduin is doing. A soft shimmering thrums. Anduin, eyes still closed, continues to focus as he channels the light from his hand into Khadgar. Hopeful music stirs and the thrum continues.''

''With a gasp, Khadgar opens his eyes before breathing softly. Anduin looks at Khadgar fondly, pleased it worked. Alleria looks at Khadgar in amazement, before hugging him tightly. Khadgar sighs from the force of the hug, rapidly blinks, and sighs again as he settles into it. Khadgar looks up at Anduin, appreciative and happy. The hopeful music continues as Alleria and Anduin help Khadgar up. The music rises and fades out as they start to depart, but finishes with a sinister boom.''

On the other side of the cutscene, the adventurer, Alleria, Anduin, and Khadgar appear outside the Priory. Khadgar is unconscious.
