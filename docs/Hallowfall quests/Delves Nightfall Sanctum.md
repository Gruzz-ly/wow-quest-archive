==Objectives==
Find evidence of Zekvir within the Nightfall Sanctum and complete the [[delve]] on any difficulty.
* Information on [[Zekvir]] found within [[Nightfall Sanctum]]

==Description==
Good tae see you again! I've run into a bit of a mess since we last met.

Some [[nerubian]] called "Zekvir" wants the expedition to stop explorin' this land. You know what that means. We've got to explore even more!

These [[Order of Night]] cultists might have information regarding Zekvir. Let's go to Nightfall Sanctum and see what we can find out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|84|27}}
* 15,650 [[XP]]
*100x [[Resonance Crystals]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Companion Experience]]

==Completion==
Hrm... So this Zekvir fellow seems tae be lurking in the dark of a lot of places we're exploring. He might even be capable of empowering folk!

We'll have tae go deeper tae figure this out. Leave the legwork tae me!

==Notes==
On approaching Brann in [[Mereldar]]:
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Hrm... So you think the Order of Night has a base near here? And it's filled with treasure?}}
:{{text|say|Mereldar Sentry|Correct. We unfortunately cannot muster a force to go after them just yet. They deal in foul magics.}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|I'm off tae check Nightfall Sanctum. Let's hope these cultists have some information on this "Zekvir" that threatened us.}}

Inside Nightfall Sanctum one can find [[Scribbled Notes]] that reads:
{{dialogue|<You find a scroll that has drawings similar to the nerubian Zekvir. You read the notes left by the cultist.>

I hear whispers in the dark. The name Zekvir. The promise of power. He wants to silence something, though I do not understand what from the whispers.

This creature offers immense power for any who would aid him. Enough that I could bring about Renilash!

<The last part of the scroll is hastily scribbled.>

{{Gossip|quest=|Copy the note on Zekvir empowering your foes.}}
}}

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Zekvir sounds like a real problem. Whispering tae enemies, offering them power... All to stop us!}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Keep yer ear to the ground for any more information. I'll see you around.}}
