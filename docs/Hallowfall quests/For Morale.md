==Objectives==
Retrieve 6 barrels of Imperial Brut from [[Rumshackle]].
* [[Imperial Brut]] (6)

==Description==
Please excuse [[Derill Fayn|my husband]]'s rudeness. When we signed up for [[Hallowfall Arathi|our expedition]], we expected to be away from our families for a few years at worst. Instead, we settled here as we guard against--well, against the end, against [[Renilash]]. Who knows when our watch will end?

I've been stockpiling a cache of wine from our church vineyards to share with everyone when tensions got high. My hiding place, Rumshackle, has been overrun by creatures. Can you get the wine for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Imagine twenty [[Arathi]] huddling under the safety of a single light for ten years. Imagine they're waiting for a chance to let their hair down with a good drink with their comrades.

Now imagine how they'll feel once they hear the wine is gone.

...please hurry.

==Completion==
Oh, thank the [[Sacred Flame|Flame]].

You've prevented a small riot from forming. Bless you, bless you, bless you!

==Notes==
The barrels are in the same area as the salamanthers for [[Suspicious Minds]]. On completion:
:{{Text|say|Lerrenai Fayn|This will go a long way to boost morale around here!}}

Completing both quests rewards the "Suspicious Neighbors" criterion of [[Sojourner of Hallowfall]].
