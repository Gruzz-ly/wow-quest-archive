The '''Hallowfall Fishing Derby''' is a [[fishing]] event takes place every Saturday for 24 hours. One of five variations of this quest will be available each week from [[Captain Oathmyt]] south of [[Mereldar]].

Accepting the quest grants a once-weekly one hour (real time) buff that allows players to catch the requested trophy fish:
:{{Abilities|Derby Dasher|id=456024|Able to catch trophy fish around Khaz Algar.|icon=inv_misc_trophy_argent|notes=}}

This buff will tick down even offline, so don't dawdle! This quest must be turned in while it's still Saturday server time, though it does not have to be turned in while the buff is still active.

Each fish has specific requirements in order to catch, beyond just fishing skill and perception, listed in the [[#Notes|notes section]] below.

Fishing all 20 Algari fish while the buff is active awards [[The Derby Dash]], granting [[Kah, Legend of the Deep]], a flying mount.

==Objectives==
Catch these Trophy Fish before the Derby Dasher buff expires: <x, y, and z>.
* Catch a <fish x>
* Catch a <fish y>
* Catch a <fish z>

==Description==
Life is always on the edge here, <name>. Nerubians, kobyss, hunger--there's always something ready to kill you.

So we need to find times to relax, and challenge ourselves at something other than survival. Like fishing.

My dad always spent Saturdays fishing, when I was growing up. He'd say, "Take some time for yourself, or you can't be effective for others." 

So every Saturday, I challenge people to the Hallowfall Fishing Derby. You have one hour to catch trophy fish. See what you can bring me!

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* 2x [[Soaked Journal Entry]]
* 2x [[Algari Seekerthread]]
* 2x [[Algari Anglerthread]]

You will also receive:
* 10x [[Mereldar Derby Mark]]

==Progress==
Any bites, <name>?

==Completion==
These are some great catches, <name>! I can't wait to see what you catch next week!

==Notes==
On approach:
