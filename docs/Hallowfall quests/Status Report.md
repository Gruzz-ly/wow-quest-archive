'''Status Report''' begins an optional chapter of the [[Hallowfall storyline]]: What Grows in the Dark. [[Captain Trueflame]], near the entrance to [[Dunelle's Kindness]], starts this quest.

==Objectives==
Locate the missing [[Arathi Army]] scouting party.

==Description==
[[Arathi airship|Airships]] give the Arathi Army command of the skies. But roads are the lifeblood of empires. My [[scout]]s protect and light the passageways of [[Hallowfall]] for our citizens.

One such patrol has been late to report their walk of the eastern road. Seek my missing scouts by the sight of smoke or flame. [[Arathi]] soldiers know better than to linger in the dark.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<[[Scout Wayshelm]] does not meet your gaze.>

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Captain Trueflame|Find those scouts, outsider. The Arathi Army is stretched thin as it is. Every single soldier counts.}}

Captain Trueflame's gossip:
{{dialogue|
My scouts are the eyes and ears of the Arathi Army. We answer to General Steelstrike, reporting where darkness gathers and our enemies lurk.
}}

Head uphill to the northeast to find [[Scout Wayshelm]] by a campfire in the [[Shadowmire]], where he has gossip:
{{Dialogue|
<The man does not meet your gaze.>
