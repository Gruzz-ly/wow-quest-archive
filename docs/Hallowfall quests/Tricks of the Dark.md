==Objectives==
Rescue 5 [[Hallowfall Arathi|Arathi]] captives.
* Arathi rescued (5)

==Description==
[[Kobyss]] lurk in the shallows of murky water and snatch any who come near, faster than a viper!

And that's just when they hunt alone. In numbers, they are a swarm to be reckoned with. They've been a plague on our outskirt villages since the day we arrived.

They eat victims alive, given the chance. We must rescue the villagers that have already been dragged to the water!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I will leave no one behind.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. These people are badly hurt, but I think they will make it. Some seem to have some skill in healing of their own.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Soldiers, with me!}}
:''Steelstrike and her unit walk into town.''
:{{text|say|Arathi Fisher|Help! I need--}}
:''Faerin and Anduin run down the path to the Sunless Strand and the Arathi Fisher, who is lying on the ground and near death.''
:{{text|say|Faerin|I'm more fighter than healer! Anduin, can you--}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Not... with the Light. But I know first aid.}}
:{{text|emote|Faerin nods to you and Anduin.}}
:''Faerin runs off into the kobyss camp.''

If you heal the injured [[Arathi Fisher]]:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Thank you, <Name>. Please help as many others as you can find.}}

In the area, the bonus objective [[Release the Beasts]] is available. Take care of that as well for some bonus XP and gold. Faerin is off fighting kobyss on her own in an eastern corner of the camp:
{{Dialogue|Stay strong, my friend! We must rescue the villagers and slay these fiends!}}

Free [[Arathi Captive]]s, but watch out for [[Kobyss Shadeshaper]]s! Upon freeing the captives:
*{{Text|say|Arathi Captive|I'll give these fish-fiends a taste of my blade! Later... once I've healed...}}
*{{Text|say|Arathi Captive|I thought I was done for. Thank you!}}
*{{Text|say|Arathi Captive|That wasn't the first time I was almost eaten by kobyss. Let's hope it's the last.}}
*{{Text|say|Arathi Captive|There are others to save. Hurry!}}
*{{Text|say|Arathi Captive|May the Flame light your path, my hero.}}
*{{Text|say|Arathi Captive|I'll regroup with the others. Thank you, outsider.}}

Any kobyss unit will drop a [[Gasping Fish]], which starts [[Gasping Plea]]. (Alternatively, wait until you can begin the optional [[Targeted Recon]], which leads to the same questline.)

Kill and save everybody, then head back to Anduin and the Arathi Fishers who've gathered around him. On approach, Faerin runs up:
:{{text|say|Arathi Fisher|You have our thanks, Faerin Lothar. And you too, outsiders.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|... Lothar?}}

==Progression==
{{Hope in Solidarity}}
