Kill Dreadfang the Merciless.
* [[Dreadfang the Merciless]] slain

==Description==
My brother and I have dealt heavy blows to the kobyss, <name>, but you could have done more. 

The most foul kobyss of them all has yet to taste my blade. If we take out their leader, the rest will flee back into the waters from which they came.

Let's take the head of Dreadfang!

==Completion==
No, please! Get up! ... Theleon...

Head southwest and finish [[Dreadfang the Merciless]] off. Once the kobyss dies:
