'''A Moment to Rest''' begins the optional "Rest at Last" chapter of the [[Hallowfall storyline]], offered by [[Great Kyron]] in [[Mereldar]]'s [[Lamplighter Headquarters]] at level {{Level|tww-max}}. When the player is eligible, they will see [[Anduin Wrynn]] standing next to Kyron. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Great Kyron|Spare a moment, <name>? I have a favor to ask of you and your friend here.}}

==Objectives==
Find Faerin near [[Light's Redoubt]].
* [[Faerin Lothar|Faerin]] found{{Co|40.73|70.96|Hallowfall}}

==Description==
Good, you're both here.

I have a favor to ask.

Faerin's wandered off. I think it might help if you and your... disheveled friend here find her.

She'll be in Light's Redoubt.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Anduin chews his lip, lost in thought.>

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Why did you ask us both here?}}
:{{Text|say|Great Kyron|Faerin is quiet about her hurt, but she lost a close friend recently. She doesn't listen to advice from us old soldiers, anymore. Talk to her, will you? She'll be in Light's Redoubt.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|... I see. <name>, I'll meet you there.}}
:''Anduin walks out of the headquarters and despawns.''

On arrival in Light's Redoubt, Faerin is sitting on the edge of a platform and looking out over the [[Harrowing Depths]]. Anduin is standing some distance behind her.
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|She's just there. Maybe you should talk to her first.}}

Talk to Faerin:
{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|Faerin looks into the darkness with glazed-over eyes.

*{{Gossip|Your friend sent us to see how you're doing.|quest=}}
*{{Gossip|Are you alright?|quest=}}
*{{Gossip|<Clear your throat but say nothing.>|quest=}}}}

All three options yield the same result:
:''Faerin gets to her feet, still looking south, and Anduin walks up to her.''
:{{Text|say|Faerin Lothar|Oh-- did something happen? I was just... paying my respects.}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|You lost someone here. It's... it's okay if you want to talk about it. We're here.}}
:{{Text|emote|Faerin sighs and shakes her head.}}
:{{Text|say|Faerin Lothar|[[Andari]], my dearest friend. I never had time to say goodbye. But no, I should get back to Mereldar. I can't wallow here. Let's go.}}
:''She walks over to Anduin.''
:{{Text|emote|Anduin struggles for words and fails, falling silent.}}

Faerin's dialogue:
{{Dialogue|<Faerin smiles, but it doesn't reach her eyes.>

Andari fell in the darkness. Alone. Holding off a small horde of monsters from reaching a tower I was defending. I should have gone to them. I should have been strong enough.

<Faerin sighs.>}}
