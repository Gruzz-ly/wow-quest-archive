==Objectives==
[[File:The Shadow Rising - Eternal Flame.jpg|thumb|The Void shield surrounding the Eternal Flame.]]
Kill the [[kobyss]] deepspeakers in the [[Veneration Grounds]] in [[Hallowfall]].

* [[Heartfang]] slain{{Co|35.05|56.86|Hallowfall}}

==Description==
I can sense three beacons of void ahead, all funneling their power into one massive font of darkness.

You will need to kill them. With them dead, I can bring down the shield.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm ready to end this.

==Completion==
Excellent.

Now to break through this shield.

==Notes==
[[File:The Shadow Rising - Nightfall.jpg|thumb|Beledar shifting above the Eternal Flame after the player kills the second deepspeaker.]]
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Arathi! Push back the kobyss. Make them regret ever stepping onto our hallowed lands!}}
:''They charge west.''

The named units are marked on the map, and are channeling a void spell into the big orb at the west.

Kill one:
:{{text|say|Aelric Leid|[[Xal'atath|The Harbinger]] manipulates the kobyss through their hunger and the Arathi through their fear!}}

Upon killing the second, [[Beledar]] shifts to shadow:
:{{text|say|Aelric Leid|Yes! Yes! Night falls! [[Renilash]] begins!}}

Kill the third:
:{{text|say|Aelric Leid|Join me in the shadows. Bring the Harbinger joy!}}

Catch up with the gang at the western end of the quest area, near the shadow shield around the Eternal Flame:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Aelric's ritual is the source of this darkness. We need to break through this barrier!}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|He draws strength from the darkness. So do I.}}
