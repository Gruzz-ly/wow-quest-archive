==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Faerin|Those shadows came from the [[Dawntower]]!}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Faerin, wait! We must withdraw to [[Mereldar]]!}}
:''Faerin and Anduin run off.''

Faerin and Anduin have stopped just south of town, looking further south at the dawntower off in the distance, which has turned to shadow:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|The tower...}}

Speak with her:

{{Dialogue|<Faerin stares at the tower in the distance, a strange, flickering light reflecting in her eyes.>

The tower...

{{gossip|quest=|<Look closer at the tower with Faerin and Anduin.>}}}}

An [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cinematic]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|Zq5LFVK_0HQ|Arathi Tower turns to dark Fire}}

''Exterior. Beledar's Shadow. Faerin, Anduin, and the adventurer are on a ridge looking down at the Cliffside Beacon dawntower.''

{{Text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|The dawntower! What is happening to it?}}

''The camera cuts to a close-up of the top of the tower, glowing Shadow purple instead of Light yellow. In the courtyard at the base of the tower, a group of [[Nightfall Darkcaster]]s are channeling shadow magic in a circle, while [[Aelric Leid]] is standing inside, corrupting the tower's flame. Suddenly a series of arrows pick off all but two of the cultists. One runs away, while the other turns to yell for Aelric.''

{{Text|bossemote|Nightfall Darkcaster|Aelric! She's-}}

''Alleria shoots the darkcaster. Aelric walks out from the tower while Alleria walks toward him with her bow raised.''

{{Text|bossemote|Aelric Leid|The Harbinger has whispered to me of your arrival... And your failure at Dalaran.}}

{{Text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Where is your master?}}

''Alleria fires an arrow at Aelric, but he teleports away at the last moment, laughing creepily. Alleria lowers her bow as Faerin, Anduin, and the adventurer come running.''

On the other side, the player has been transported to the Cliffside Beacon alongside Faerin and Anduin. Faerin has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|So much darkness. How could it come to this?

Does Light give way to darkness so easily?

{{gossip|Tell me about Aelric.}}
{{Dialogue-child|Aelric was one of us, a Lamplighter. For years, he worked with us to keep the dawntowers lit and the people of Hallowfall safe. We all trusted him. He'd fought with us, we'd saved people from the darkness together.

Then he betrayed the Arathi, and everything the Lamplighters stand for. He ambushed my friend [[Andari]], and leads the Order of Night, who caused the breach here and all these deaths.

I'm still not sure... Was he ever good? Did he plan that from the start?

I don't know anyone more terrible. No one even comes close.

{{Gossip|I'd like to talk about something else.}}}}}}

==Progression==
{{Hope in Solidarity}}

==Alpha version==
{{Rfa-section}}
In the alpha, the player, Faerin, and Anduin remained standing outside Sina's Yearning after the cutscene, and the player had to manually travel to the Cliffside Beacon. After the cutscene:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|That was Aelric, the bastard!}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|We have to help Alleria!}}
:''They run off.''

On arrival to the Cliffside Beacon:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|No, the Sacred Flame! What has Aelric and his cult done?}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I don't know, but they claim allergiance{{Sic}} to Xal'atath. And so their lives are forfeit.}}
