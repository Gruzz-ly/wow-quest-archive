==Objectives==
Locate "Peevish" Paeton Berncort and recover 8 bottles of Dauntless Draught.
* [[Attica Whiskervale|Attica]]'s Cave Torch activated
* [["Peevish" Paeton Berncort|Peevish Paeton Berncort]] located
* [[Dauntless Draught (quest item)]] (8)
* [[Attica's Cave Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
Codswallop! Peevish has run off again. He is assigned to this post but is never here!

I heard him screaming from the nearby cave. He must have tried to hide in there.

Take my torch and go to the [[Coldshadow Cave]]. Find Peevish along with the bottles of Dauntless Draught he stole. He can desert his post if he wants, but I won't let him take the drinks!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Dauntless Draught]]
*[[Lamplighter Supply Satchel]]
*{{wb|repitem=Hallowfall Arathi Commendation|repamount=200|faction=Hallowfall Arathi|altqty1=40|altitem1=Resonance Crystals}}

==Progress==
Have you found "Peevish" Paeton Berncort and the bottles of Dauntless Draught he took with him?

==Completion==
I didn't anticipate Peevish would muster the courage to return, but at least you recovered the Draught. 

We'll raise a toast and wish him luck in that cave.

==Notes==

Paeton Berncort's gossip upon finding him inside the cave:
{{Dialogue|Did Captain Lancekat send you? Are you here to humiliate me further?

{{Gossip|Attica asked me to find you.}}

{{Dialogue-child|You tell that lynx lover, Peaton Berncort is nobody's fool. 

I am done with the Hallowfall expedition, and I won't be back to camp. I lost the drinks in the cave, so find them yourself.}}

{{Gossip|Tell me about Captain Lancekat?}}

{{Dialogue-child|In my family's history, there's always been a Berncort captaining a ship of the Arathi Navy. 

It was my destiny to be captain of the Dauntless, but Lancekat graduated from Officer's Academy with top honors.

They say I never went to class and flunked out, but it was Lancekat and the instructors conspiring against me!}}

Completing this quest is a criterion of [[Beacon of Hope]].
