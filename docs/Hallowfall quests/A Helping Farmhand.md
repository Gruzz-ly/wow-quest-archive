==Objectives==
Recover 8 Slightly Chewed Harvest Bounty from [[Gluttonous Jawcrawler]]s.
*[[Slightly Chewed Harvest Bounty]] (8)

==Description==
Greetings, <name>, name's Orren. We've got a whole mess of Jawcrawlers that came up from underground attacking the crops. Something a <class> like yourself could really help out with!

Hunger is never far away in Hallowfall, so saving these crops is my priority.

But if you'd be willing to drive them off for me, I'll be able to focus on my long-term plan to feed people more effectively.

Meet me over by the shed! And bring any food that's not too chewed up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This'll keep our crops safe in the future. And perhaps the leftovers can go... in a stew.

==Completion==
Good work, <name>, that looks... edible. And when you're on the wall, worried about nerubians killing you, I doubt anyone will mind. 

I was able to get a lot of ELIZA's decision sprockets properly aligned while you were doing that, so thanks!

==Notes==
Upon approach:
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|<Class>, I could really use your help if you can spare the time.}}

Upon accept, Orren starts going somewhere:
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|Finally, a chance to make some headway with Eliza...}}
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|I wonder if Aemyra will be back soon.}}

Upon meeting again with Orren, he can be seen working on [[ELIZA]], a harvest golem:
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|Where is Aemyra? I thought she'd be here by now.}}
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|I love her dearly, but it's hard with a Lamplighter, to not know when they'll be back. Or if...}}

==Progression==
{{Apart for Purpose}}

;Description
Greetings, <name>, name's Orren. I work the farm here at [[Beledar's Bounty]]. I was about to head out to the fields, we've got a whole mess of [[Jawcrawler]]s that came up from underground attacking the crops.

[[Hallowfall]] is a dangerous place, and one persistent danger we face is starvation. So these crops are my priority. But if you'd be willing to drive them off for me, I'd be able to take care of some... important business of my own.

Meet me by the shed! And bring any food that's not too chewed up.
