# Hallowfall storyline

[[File:VZ-Hallowfall.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

The '''Hallowfall storyline''' starts after the [[Ringing Deeps storyline]] in [[Hallowfall]], the third zone of [[Khaz Algar]] as part of [[The War Within campaign]].

==Campaign==
The three-chapter campaign is tracked in [[Hallowfall (achievement)]]:

===The Guiding Star===
Accompanied by [[Anduin Wrynn]], the outsiders entered [[Hallowfall]], a vast subterranean cavern that resembled the surface world. Within it were vegetation, airships, and an inland sea. Above, [[Beledar|a massive crystal]] embedded in the cavern ceiling illuminated the region with light comparable to the sun. As they entered, the [[Radiant Song]] once again filled the minds of Anduin and the outsiders. Before long, they encountered [[Faerin Lothar|Faerin]], a [[Lamplighters|Lamplighter]], who enlisted their aid in delivering supplies to the [[Aegis Wall]]. During the journey, Faerin explained that the crystal was known as Beledar, or “the Emperor's Vision,” to the [[Hallowfall Arathi|Arathi]] people. She further revealed that the Hallowfall Arathi were descended from an expedition of the [[Arathi Empire]] that had arrived in the cavern slightly more than a decade earlier.

At the Aegis Wall, the outsiders encountered the leader of the Lamplighters, [[Great Kyron|Kyron]]. Together with Faerin, he tasked them with lighting a keyflame and pushing back the [[nerubian]] assault. Beyond the wall, the outsiders carried the offensive further, recovering the bodies of fallen Arathi soldiers. Soon after, a larger swarm of nerubians broke through the defenses and advanced toward [[Tenir's Ascent]]. The outsiders, accompanied by Anduin, Faerin, and Kyron, moved to the airdocks to protect the workers stationed there. During the battle, the outsiders uncovered messages from [[Queen Ansurek]] of the nerubians, which spoke of a “[[War between light and shadow|fated battle]]” and “[[Ascended nerubian|ascension]].” The assault was led by [[Siegelord Xerosh]], who was slain with the aid of [[Alleria Windrunner]], newly arrived in Hallowfall. Alleria revealed that she had been tracking the nerubians responsible for [[Dalaran]]'s fall into the depths below. As the fighting concluded, the Lamplighters ignited the [[dawntower]]. However, in that moment Beledar shifted into shadow, and the cavern of Hallowfall was plunged into darkness.

===Gathering Shadows===
While traveling through the shadowed canyons of Hallowfall, Faerin, Anduin, and the outsiders were ambushed by strange creatures of the night. After defeating them, Faerin requested their aid in rescuing the villagers of [[Lorel's Crossing]] from the [[kobyss]]—bipedal aquatic beings that emerged from the depths of [[The Undersea]]. Though [[General Steelstrike]], leader of the Hallowfall Arathi, opposed the diversion, the rescue was carried out successfully. The group then advanced to [[Sina's Yearning]], a fishing settlement under heavy kobyss attack. As the fighting raged, a surge of dark energy swept over the village, extinguishing the [[Sacred Flame]]. Tracing its source, the outsiders discovered that a nearby dawntower had been corrupted by the [[Order of Night]], Arathi who venerated Beledar's Shadow and [[Xal'atath]]. In a cave near the tower, the group halted the cult's ritual to spread further corruption. Upon returning to the surface, Anduin and Faerin combined their efforts in a cleansing rite, restoring the dawntower. The ritual not only reignited the Sacred Flame, but also renewed Anduin's shaken faith in the [[Light]]. After purifying the dawntower, Beledar shifted back to the light.

===Hope in Solidarity===
In the Arathi city of [[Mereldar]], Faerin informed General Steelstrike of the Order of Night's growing plot to plunge Hallowfall into shadow. Exploring the streets, the outsiders discovered that the cult was exploiting the Arathi's fear of Beledar's Shadow to swell its ranks. Their investigation was cut short when alarm bells rang—the Order had launched an assault on the [[Veneration Grounds]]. As the cultists conducted a dark ritual, waves of kobyss surged forth to attack the Arathi. With the aid of Alleria, the outsiders broke through the defenses, and Alleria shattered the shadow barrier protecting [[Aelric Leid]], the cult's leader. The outsiders struck him down, halting the ritual. The victory was fleeting. A messenger arrived with dire news: the nerubians had descended on the settlement of [[Livia's Patience]]. Faerin, Anduin, Alleria, and the outsiders hurried to the site, only to find the town reduced to rubble. After rescuing the few survivors, preparations were made to strike back directly at the nerubians. A great warship, the ''[[The Reckoning (airship)|Reckoning]]'', was readied to descend into enemy territory. As the outsiders, Faerin, and Alleria boarded, Anduin chose to remain behind to sabotage a ballista targeting the ship. Though he succeeded, the delay left him surrounded by nerubians. With no choice, his allies were forced to depart without him.
