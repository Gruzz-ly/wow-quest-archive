'''An Orphan's Request''' begins an optional chapter of the [[Hallowfall storyline]], started by [[Alyza Bowblaze]] in [[Mereldar]] while on [[Mereldar's Light]]. The ultimate reward for this chapter is +500 reputation with [[Hallowfall Arathi]] and the [[Adult-Sized Arathi Epaulets]].

==Objectives==
Retrieve Alyza's Much Loved Teddy Bear from the [[Hungering Pool]] in [[Hallowfall]].
* [["Much Loved" Teddy Bear]] {{co|52.3|50.2|Hallowfall}}
* Talk to [[Alyza Bowblaze|Alyza]]

==Description==
Wow, you look really strong! Would you be able to help me?

My parents were killed by the mean [[kobyss]]. When I came here, I left my favorite, most well loved teddy ever behind.

Could you go get it for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
;Before speaking to Alyza at [[The Hungering Pool]]
Can you find my teddy?

;After speaking to Alyza at [[The Hungering Pool]]
I will make the kobyss regret ever setting foot in these lands.

==Completion==
Fine, fine. I guess I don't mind if you come help.

You do actually look big, and strong.

==Notes==
;Before speaking with Alyza
:Can you find my Teddy?
;After speaking with her
:I will make the kobyss regret ever setting foot in these lands.

At the surface level on the eastern side of the [[Hungering Pool]] is a half-destroyed shack with an [[Arathi Chest]] in it. Open it, and Alyza will break the first rule of Stealth by speaking:
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|Ok, Alyza, they'll go soon. You got what you needed from them. Just wait them out.}}

Walk around to the other side and speak with her:

{{dialogue|Drat, how did you find me?

Nevermind, it doesn't matter. I got what I needed from you. You can go now.

I have to do this next bit on my own.

{{gossip|Wait, how did you get here so fast?}}
:I stowed away on your mount, obviously.
:I have places to be, kobyss to kill. I can't be cooped up in some orphanage.}}
If you took some time to get to this quest, after accepting it:
{{dialogue|
:I stowed away on your mount, obviously.
:You took your time coming here. Didn't care about a poor orphan's favorite teddy bear huh?
:Whatever, I have places to be, kobyss to kill. I can't be cooped up in some orphanage.
:{{gossip|What do you want to do here?}}
:You're not going to be like those other adults are you? "Oooh, Alyza, you can't go and kill the kobyss, they are dangerous."
:These kobyss killed my parents, and stole their things.
:I'm going to get vengeance, and kill them right back.
:{{gossip|quest=|I'll help you kill the kobyss and get your parents items back.}}

{{gossip|I should take you back to the Orphanage.}}
:You won't catch me. I'm fast.
:Then what? Are you going to tell my parents?
:Good luck. They're dead.

{{gossip|quest=|I'll help you with whatever you are doing next.}}
