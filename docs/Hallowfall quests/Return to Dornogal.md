'''Return to Dornogal''' concludes the final chapter of the max-level [[The War Within (achievement)]] storyline. The [[The War Within campaign]] continues with the [[Nerub-ar Palace]] storyline, beginning with [[Our Chance to Strike]].

==Objectives==
Return to [[Dornogal]] in the [[Isle of Dorn]] and report what happened.
* Report back to [[Merrix]] in Dornogal {{co|39.9|26.0|Dornogal}}
* Speak to [[Executor Nizrek]] in [[Hallowfall]] (Optional) {{co|36.8|36.0|Hallowfall}}

==Description==
The battle is finally over and I suppose it's time we lick our wounds. 

Head back to Dornogal, Champion. 

I'll be right there as soon as [[Khadgar]] is healthy enough to withstand travel.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*[[The War Within (achievement)]]

==Completion==
Our battle has been hard fought. But there is still much to come.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Fortune smiles on us today. The battle is won, and in victory we've had a dear friend returned to us.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Traces of [[Xal'atath]]'s presence linger in the air. In time, she will strike again. But for now, I believe we've all earned some respite.}}

Before leaving, check in on everybody in the Priory exterior. Alleria and Anduin are looking at Khadgar, but have nothing to say.

At the base of the steps is [[Faerin Lothar]]:
{{dialogue|With the forces of Azj-Kahet and the Harbinger gone, Hallowfall has a moment to breathe. Beledar is safe - at least from outside threats. Now the only shadows left to contend with are ones of our own making.}}

Directly ahead, before the fountain, are two [[Lightforged Vindicator]]s and [[High Exarch Turalyon]]:
{{Alliance}}{{dialogue|I've known Alleria for many, many years. She still never ceases to amaze me.

The battle against the nerubians turned the moment Beledar shifted back to the Light. Somehow, I knew it was because of Alleria's efforts. That she had walked boldly into darkness and emerged victorious.

I... cannot bring myself to trust the Void, or the power it promises. But I trust Alleria with every fiber of my being.

For now, that is enough.}}

Just southeast are [[Executor Nizrek]], a projection of [[Widow Arak'nai]], and [[The Broken Queen]]:
{{dialogue|title=Executor Nizrek|To see our old queen in such a state...

Your discretion and civility in this situation is a boon. We will take her back to Azj-Kahet and see if any of her former life is retained in her. If not...

Then we'll deal with it ourselves.

{{gossip|quest=|<Ask about Neferess's condition.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|It would have been easy for you to end Queen Neferess's life to secure victory. And yet you spared her.}}
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|Words cannot capture my gratitude. I will escort my queen home, and bring word of your deeds to my conspirators.}}
:{{text|say|Executor Nizrek|Return to the surface for now. And know that you will forevermore have allies in Azj-Kahet.}}

Travel back to Dornogal and check in with Merrix, Faerin, [[Lufsela]], [[Brinthe]], and [[Adelgonn]] in [[Foundation Hall]]:
{{dialogue|Do you have an appointment?

{{gossip|quest=|<Report what happened in Hallowfall.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|And so the battle is won. <Name>, all of Khaz Algar owes you a tremendous debt.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|When you first arrived on our shores, we were fractured and divided. But you showed us the path to becoming whole again.}}
:{{text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|You reignited our drive for purpose, and to define the parameters of our own existence.}}
:{{text|say|Lufsela|We see now that traditions can change and evolve... and even be broken, if necessary.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|The Arathi no longer cower in darkness. We bring the Light in our hearts wherever we go.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|This Council stands stronger than ever before, with new friends and allies by our side. And we have you to thank for it.}}
:''They all bow. The earthen then return to their thrones and Faerin walks out of the hall.''

Catch up with Anduin and Thrall southeast of the [[Coreway]], looking at the ruins of [[Dalaran]] from the ridge.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|It feels good to know we made a difference here. And yet... I can still hear the [[Radiant Song]] echoing in my heart.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Why did it lead us here? Was it to solely to confront Xal'atath? Or is there something larger at play?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I'm no stranger to feeling like a greater calling awaits. But this is different, somehow. I just hope that we prove ready to answer it.}}

==Stay awhile and listen==
Many characters have new <Stay awhile and listen.> gossip options, starting with Anduin:

===Anduin and Thrall===
[[File:Return to Dornogal - Anduin and Thrall.jpg|thumb|Anduin and Thrall, looking at the ruins of Dalaran]]

Anduin and Thrall are at the turn-in location, at {{co|25.4|66.2|Dornogal}} in southeastern Dornogal:

{{dialogue|title=Thrall|Greetings, <name>.}}

{{dialogue|title=Anduin Wrynn|Although this journey has been difficult, I have learned much.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|You found your Light again.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Sort of. More like I stopped running from it.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Before he died, [[Varian Wrynn|my father]] wrote me a [[Letter to Anduin|letter]].}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|He said that I had to fight for peace.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I thought that I had to become him. Because the world still needed him.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Because I still needed him.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|But taking up his [[Shalamayne|sword]] only led to war and death.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I made mistake after mistake. I felt...}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|...Unworthy.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Varian Wrynn was a fierce, proud warrior. I respected his strength.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|But you, Anduin... you have your own strength, greater than any sword.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I'm not my father...}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|...but he never expected me to be.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|That's why he wrote that letter.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|To remind me who I am.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|It was his final lesson. And his greatest gift.}}

===Alleria and Khadgar===
[[File:Return to Dornogal - Alleria and Khadgar.jpg|thumb|Alleria and Khadgar, sporting his new ride]]

[[Alleria Windrunner]] and [[Archmage Khadgar]] are at {{co|42.4|27.1|Dornogal}} in the [[Foundation Hall]] of Dornogal. Khadgar is in a summoned wheelchair, that is floating a few inches off of the ground:

{{dialogue|title=Archmage Khadgar|There is much to reflect on, <name>.}}

{{dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|What news do you bring, <name>?

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}<br>
{{gossip|Remind me what happened to Xal'atath.}} (''replays the Alleria-vs-Xal'atath cinematic'')}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|It occurs to me that I never got the chance to properly thank you, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Were it not for your efforts, [[Dalaran]] could have proven to be an even greater tragedy than it was.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|We thought we had lost you, Khadgar. How did you survive?}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|The [[Dark Heart]] was created not to destroy, but to capture and harness all manner of power.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|When I felt what it was doing to me, I transmuted myself into pure arcane energy...}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|...and allowed yourself to be trapped within the Dark Heart.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Yes. Until you freed me.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|That was a risky move. Trusting me to finish the fight against Xal'atath.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I knew you would do whatever it took to defeat her. Just like [[Invasion of Draenor|all those years ago]]...}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|...when we charged through the [[Dark Portal]] and closed it behind us to save our world.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Both then and now, placing my faith in you was never any risk at all.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|That transmutation spell, however... that was not without consequences.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|You know, [[Kurdran Wildhammer|Kurdran]] keeps saying I should just ride a gryphon around.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|That seems terribly inconvenient, if you ask me. I much prefer this chair.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Could that be because [[Archmage Modera]] designed it for you herself?}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Why Alleria, whatever are you implying?}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Only that you and Turalyon are so very alike: bold in battle, shy in matters of the heart.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Hah! And you are still the same old Alleria, I see.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|That I am, Khadgar. Void, or no Void.}}

===Neferess and the Weaver===
[[File:Return to Dornogal - Neferess and the Weaver.jpg|thumb|Neferess and Widow Arak'nai in the Trap Door of the Weaver's Lair]]

In the [[Trap Door]] inn of [[Weaver's Lair]] in [[Azj-Kahet]], find [[Neferess]] at {{co|57.1|39.3|Azj-Kahet}} weaving unsteadily into a banner:

{{dialogue|title=Neferess|Sew. Stitch. Heal. 

I... was Neferess. I am.

{{gossip|I'm glad you are doing well.}}}}
:''Arak'nai walks in.''
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|My queen. Forgive me. I should have known your demise was [[Making of a Monster|manufactured]] by Xal'atath.}}
:{{text|say|Neferess|Widow... NO! No... do not... look... stay away!}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Neferess... I have been apart from you for too long. Do not ask me to suffer your absence for another moment!}}
:{{text|say|Neferess|I... abomination... hurts... leave me, Naia!}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|Never. After all that has happened, all that we've done... It was worth it, to hear you say my name again.}}
:{{text|say|Widow Arak'nai|You needn't speak, my dear. I am here at your side. I will not leave you. All is as it should be.}}

==Other visitors==
===Dezco, Rata, and Kyron===
At {{co|40.5|52.4|Hallowfall}} in [[Mereldar]]  of [[Hallowfall]], [[Sunwalker Dezco]], [[High Prelate Rata]] and [[Great Kyron]] talk about [[Beledar]] and [[Renilash]]:
:{{text|say|Sunwalker Dezco|This crystal... Beledar. It's larger than I expected.}}
If Beledar is in its light state:
:{{text|say|High Prelate Rata|Warmer than I expected. Like a real sun.}}
:{{text|say|Great Kyron|Beledar's warmth keeps us all safe, and allows this canyon to flourish.}}
If Beledar is in its voidstate:
:{{text|say|High Prelate Rata|I have never seen this much void light. It makes ma skin crawl.}}
:{{text|say|Great Kyron|You aren't the only one, Prelate. Beledar's visage in this state is an omen of woe and strife.}}
Either way, the dialogue continues:
:{{text|say|Sunwalker Dezco|Great Kyron. It is an honor.}}
:{{text|say|Great Kyron|The honor is mine. Without the help of your people, we would not have survived the Harbingers attack.}}
:{{text|say|High Prelate Rata|Ya had a prophecy about this yes? Renilash, I believe?}}
:{{text|say|Great Kyron|The great battle of the Arathi versus the dark, yes.}}
:{{text|say|Great Kyron|I can't help but wonder if this was Renilash, where do we go from here?}}
:{{text|say|Great Kyron|If it wasn't Renilash... what else could come our way?}}
:{{text|say|Sunwalker Dezco|Given Xal'atath is on the loose, I doubt we'll have to wait long to find out.}}
:{{text|say|High Prelate Rata|Dezco, we should continue onwards. Great Kyron, I look forward to talking to ya again.}}
:{{text|say|Great Kyron|And you. Flame's Blessing upon you.}}

===Liadrin, Salandria and Regald Hornfyre===
Also in Mereldar [[Lady Liadrin]], [[Salandria]] and [[Regald Hornfyre]] talk about the [[Sacred Flame]]:
:{{text|say|Lady Liadrin|Thank you for agreeing to meet with us. I'm eager to learn more about the Sacred Flame.}}
:{{text|say|Regald Hornfyre|It's no problem, my lady. I'm always happy to discuss the Sacred Flame.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Liadrin|Do you gain the Sacred Flame through [[Beledar]]?}}
:{{text|say|Regald Hornfyre|Beledar is more... a symbol. A holy relic if you will. A powerful source of the Light yes. But not the source of the Sacred Flame.}}
:{{text|say|Salandria|Does the Flame come from another source, or is it intrinsic?}}
:{{text|say|Regald Hornfyre|Sorry, I'm trying to condense years' worth of training into a single conversation.}}
:{{text|say|Regald Hornfyre|The Sacred Flame comes from within, much like the Light. But it's also an external source, much like the Light. It just has more... physical applications, given its flammability.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Liadrin|Interesting. So you tap into the [[Elemental Plane]]?}}
:{{text|say|Regald Hornfyre|In many ways it's an element of faith. The Sacred Flame isn't a being or energy from the [[Firelands]], nor any specific plane, but the representation of belief.}}
:{{text|say|Regald Hornfyre|It's not just holy nor just arcane, but both, and neither. Coming from within us, and existing as a radiant force throughout the cosmos.}}
:{{text|say|Salandria|It sounds akin to some of our applications of the Light, compared to [[Stormwind]].}}
:{{text|say|Lady Liadrin|True, and I suppose it makes sense, given its origins.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Liadrin|Thank you, Reginald. It has been a pleasure. I hope we can return soon.}}

===Fareeya and Chay===
[[Captain Fareeya]] and [[Chay]] have a little chat in [[Mereldar]]:
:{{text|say|Chay|Excuse me, miss. Why are you shining?}}
:{{text|say|Captain Fareeya|I was forged in the Light, little one. To fight the [[Burning Legion]].}}
:{{text|say|Chay|Oh wow! Probably a good thing you weren't forged in the Sacred Flame. Being on fire might hurt.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Fareeya|Hah, I imagine it would. I am happy with just the Light. No Flame is needed.}}
:{{text|say|Chay|But you could burn your foes! Phaawww! Fooossh!}}
:{{text|say|Captain Fareeya|I have defeated plenty of foes without it. I have no doubt I will defeat plenty more.}}
:{{text|say|Chay|Oh wow! Could you show me?}}
:{{text|say|Captain Fareeya|Perhaps when you are older, yes?}}
:{{text|say|Chay|Thanks, Glowy Lady!}}
:{{text|say|Captain Fareeya|It's Fareeya, little one. Look for me when you are grown.}}

===Adventurer party===
A group of adventurers discuss their next mission while passing through Mereldar:
:{{text|say|[[Temper (human)|Temper]]|Ok, our next mission is to take out some kobyss on the other side of Hallowfall.}}
:{{text|say|[[Yagnar Klog]]|Good. I've been itching to get back at them after they got my robe dirty.}}
:{{text|say|[[Tobra]]|They got your robe dirty because you pulled before the tank was ready.}}
:{{text|say|Yagnar Klog|That's Temper's fault for being too slow.}}
:{{text|say|Yagnar Klog|Besides, the [[kobyss]] need to pay for trying to ruin this beautiful face.}}
:{{text|say|[[Ghatgut]]|I need more pocket bacon before we go.}}
:{{text|say|Temper|It's just regular bacon. You don't need to call it pocket bacon.}}
:{{text|say|Ghatgut|I need a way to tell it apart from boot bacon.}}
:{{text|say|Temper|I... nevermind. Bywren, your thoughts?}}
:{{text|say|[[Bywren]]|Sqwaak!}}
:{{text|say|Temper|Good point. Let's head out.}}

===Stellin Verasa and Maeryl Vlann===
Stellin and Maeryl have a chat about the new arrivals in the city:
:{{text|say|[[Stellin Verasa]]|Hey Maeryl. Hallowfall is pretty crowded these days, huh?}}
:{{text|say|[[Maeryl Vlann]]|Yeah. It's nice though. The nerubians have paused their attacks.}}
:{{text|say|Maeryl Vlann|Maybe we can have a shift or two of peace.}}
:{{text|say|Stellin Verasa|Flame willing, but I doubt it.}}
:{{text|say|Stellin Verasa|Oh! You'll never guess what happened earlier. One of the outsiders asked if I needed help with anything.}}
:{{text|say|Maeryl Vlann|That was nice of them.}}
:{{text|say|Stellin Verasa|Well, I said they could help me catalog my books, and they looked a bit upset.}}
:{{text|say|Stellin Verasa|They said they were more interested in killing things for me.}}
:{{text|say|Maeryl Vlann|Did you need anything killing?{{sic}}}}
:{{text|say|Stellin Verasa|Not immediately. They said they'd come back later "in case anything had looked at me funny."}}
:{{text|say|Maeryl Vlann|Outsiders. Totally crazy.}}
:{{text|say|Stellin Verasa|Right? Anyway, I'll leave you too{{sic}} it, good talking to you.}}
