==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|ELIZA.png|ELIZA|Orren's machine is out of control, and needs to be stopped.}}
Stop ELIZA.
*[[ELIZA]] stopped
*Aemyra's message delivered

==Description==
I shouldn't have set ELIZA to simply gather as much food as she could. She was working, but when a wagon came by, full of food for Mereldar, she started chasing it! And she wouldn't let me access her decision sprockets or tensor springs!

I kept trying, but ELIZA wouldn't stop. Eventually, she outran me. <Name>, I need you to stop her before someone gets killed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|80}}
*[[ELIZA's Rake Attachment]]
*{{wb|repitem=Hallowfall Arathi Commendation|repamount=500|faction=Hallowfall Arathi|altqty1=25|altitem1=Resonance Crystals}}

==Progress==
Were you able to stop ELIZA?

==Completion==
ELIZA didn't work like I expected. But Aemyra believes I'll get it right... I'm going to keep trying. 

And when I do, lack of food won't be a threat to the Arathi--and lack of time won't keep me from Aemyra!

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|Do what you must, <name>. But if it's possible to not completely destroy her, I would be grateful.}}

Upon engaging ELIZA in combat:
:{{text|say|ELIZA|Threat to crop yields detected. Eradicating.}}

Upon defeat:
:{{text|say|ELIZA|Damage sustained exceeds design parameters. Returning for diagnostic tests.}}

Upon returing to Orren:
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|Thanks for stopping ELIZA, <name>. I'm not sure I'm ever going to get her working right.}}

Talking to Orren:
{{dialogue|
I guess the tension on the "find crops" priority spring was too high.

It's going to take a while to repair ELIZA, let alone get those settings right. I might never get it--maybe it's not even possible.

{{gossip|quest=|Aemyra sent this for you.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|Thanks, <name>, for bringing this. It's great to hear from her.}}

Orren's comment on the letter based on the choices made previously:
{{dialogue|
{{gossip|I miss you, Orr, and I'm afraid I'm going to keep missing you for a while as I make Velhan's Claim safe for people.}}
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|Aemyra, the times we're together totally outweigh the difficulties of our time apart. Nothing makes me happier.}}
{{gossip|My work at Velhan's Claim will take me a while.}}

{{gossip|As thrilling as it is to hang around the farm, I'm afraid I'm going to be here fighting the kobyss for a while.}}

{{gossip|I'm afraid it's going to take quite a while to set things in order at Velhan's Claim. But I'll see you again when I'm done here.}}
}}


{{dialogue|
{{gossip|The work you're doing with ELIZA is brilliant. Soon you'll have her caring for the fields, and we'll have more time together.}}
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|Wow, she said I'm brilliant? Things like that keep my own lamp lit, if you'll pardon the pun.}}
{{gossip|You're going to get ELIZA working eventually.}}
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|Aemyra thinks I'm going to get ELIZA working eventually. I hope she's right!}}
{{gossip|Don't get any ideas about replacing me with that robot! But you're doing great work on it.}}
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|Replace her?! ELIZA could never replace Aemyra--nothing could!}}
{{gossip|Please be careful with your work on ELIZA. That seems like it could backfire, but I know you'll figure it out.}}
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|Huh... Aemyra knew this might backfire. But she says I'll get it figured out!}}
}}


{{dialogue|
{{gossip|I'm truly grateful for all the good you bring to my life, Orren.}}
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|She's ...grateful for me? I'm constantly distracted by thoughts about how lucky I am to have found her.}}
{{gossip|I like you and look forward to seeing you.}}
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|Aemyra says she's looking forward to seeing me. I wish it were sooner, but I'll wait, <name>!}}
{{gossip|I want you to know, I love you every bit as much as I hate the kobyss!}}
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|Heh. Aemyra says she loves me as much as she hates the kobyss. That's really a lot, <name>!}}
{{gossip|If you love me as much as I do you, we have a bright future together!}}
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|She thinks we have a really bright future together, based on how much we love each other, <name>!}}
}}

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|Thanks, my head was in a pretty bad place, before. But I'm ready to get back to work.}}
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|I'll be at the shed, with what's left of ELIZA. Despite that huge setback, I really am getting close.}}

At the shed, Orren has new gossip:
{{dialogue|
ELIZA, once we get you fixed up, I think attention is all you need.

Thanks again for your help, <name>!
