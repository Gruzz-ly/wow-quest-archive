==Objectives==
Retrieve Alyza's parents' items in the [[Hungering Pool]] in [[Hallowfall]].
* Parental Effects (4)

==Description==
When the [[kobyss]] killed my parents, they stole some of their most cherished things. 

Not me, obviously. Cherished items. 

While we are murdering kobyss, let's find them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Stupid kobyss. I hate them.

==Completion==
Well done. Far more useful than those other adults who told me not to do this.

"But Alyza, the kobyss are dangerous. You'll die." Stupid adults, thinking they know best.

Are you ready to kill the big one? I'm ready to kill the big one.

==Notes==
[[File:A Bloody Inheritance - Alyza.jpg|thumb|Alyza with a helm and sword entirely too big for her]]

Alyzza's gossip before accept:
{{dialogue|Finally, an adult that will help me achieve vengeance.

Let's salt the bones of the kobyss. Let's burn their world to ashes!}}

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|Fine, maybe you can help with killing the kobyss.}}

She has new gossip too:

{{dialogue|content=Are you ready to kill some kobyss?

I'm ready to kill some kobyss.}}

The collected items are a [[Battered Helmet]], some [[Dented Boots]], a [[Salt-pitted Sword]], and a [[Resplendant Shield]] and are marked on the minimap, held in [[Kobyss Chest]]s.

:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|My mum got this helmet from my grandpa. She said it would always protect her.}}
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|Maybe if she was wearing it, she would still be alive.}}
:''Alyza equips the helmet.''

:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|Ah, these were my mums boots. They weren't anything special though.}}
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|You can hold them. Its not like I can throw a shoe at the kobyss.}}

:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|What have these filthy fish-faces done to my dads sword?}}
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|He always kept it sharpened. This is a disgrace!}}
:''Alyza equips the sword.''

Upon looting the shield:
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|Oh, you might need to carry this one. It's a bit big.}}
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|Be careful with it. It saved my dad from lots of nerubians.}}

Kill 50 kobyss with Alyza present to earn the [[Never Enough (achievement)]] achievement.
