==Objectives==
Recover Harvest Seeds and plant 8 seeds in Seed-Ready Soil.
* [[Harvest Seed Supply|Harvest Seed recovered]] (Optional)
* Harvest Seeds [[Seed-Ready Soil|planted]] (8)

==Description==
These once obedient [[harvestbot]]s have run amok and are wreaking havoc in our fields.

The success of our community depends on getting our seeds in the ground, but most of the seeds are in the hands of those harvesters!

Would you venture into the fields, eliminate any rogue machines, gather the seeds, and finish the planting?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*{{wb|repitem=Hallowfall Arathi Commendation|repamount=200|faction=Hallowfall Arathi|altqty1=40|altitem1=Resonance Crystals}}

==Progress==
Have you planted the seeds?

==Completion==
You've truly done us a great service! Planting those seeds buys us valuable time until the harvestbots are repaired.

==Notes==
Completing this quest is a criterion of [[Beacon of Hope]].
