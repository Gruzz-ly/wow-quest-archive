You were really good at controlling Remy.  Maybe you can come back and help next week as well!

==Notes==
Harvestbot Remy has the following abilities:
#{{Abilities|Bug Broiler|id=||icon=}}
#{{Abilities|Remy Jump|id=||icon=}}
#{{Abilities|Throw Cabbage|id=||icon=}}
#{{Abilities|Throw Carrot|id=||icon=}}

Upon throwing cabbage to a [[Cabbage Cart-Pusher]]:
:{{text|say|Cabbage Cart-Pusher|A Cabbage...bzzt.}}

Upon throwing carrot to a [[Carrot Cart-Pusher]]:
:{{text|say|Carrot Cart-Pusher|A Carrot...bzzt.}}

Upon filling a cart full of vegetables, the Cart-Pushers will say:

The mites come out when stomping on [[Strange Dirt]]s.

Exiting the Remy:
:{{Text|bossemote|You are no longer controlling the harvestbot.}}

Completing this quest is a criterion of [[Beacon of Hope]].
