==Objectives==
Collect 20 Duskstem from the tallest plants that grow in the darkness.
*[[Duskstem]] (20)

==Description==
Fishing out here is not easy, especially when the spooky sounds of the darkness start to wear on the nerves.

I've taken to chewing on the Duskstem from the tall plants nearby. It's sweet and chewy, keeps the jaw busy, and helps me pass the time!

If you could lend a hand by gathering some Duskstem with your flying mount, I would be most appreciative.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Lamplighter Supply Satchel]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Hallowfall Arathi Commendation]] (+200 [[reputation]] with [[Hallowfall Arathi]]) (first time) or 40x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
Have you collected enough?

==Completion==
You made that look easy. It usually takes me an hour to climb one of those plants.

==Notes==
Completing this quest is a criterion of [[Beacon of Hope]].
