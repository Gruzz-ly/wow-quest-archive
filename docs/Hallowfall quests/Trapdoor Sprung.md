==Objectives==
Kill 15 nerubians in [[Livia's Patience]] in [[Hallowfall]].
* [[Nerubian]]s slain (15)
*Meet your allies in Livia's Patience.

==Description==
We need time to get [[The Reckoning (airship)|the Reckoning]] ready. Take your friends and hold back the nerubians for as long as you can.

They deserve nothing but death for what they have done to our people.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How goes the hunt?

==Completion==
Good job, <name>. I'm surprised the nerubians aren't fleeing already!

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Stalwarts! We are the wall today! Together we will stand against the darkness!}}
:''Steelstrike runs off along the docks.''
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|We need to evacuate the villagers before the Reckoning's bombardment.}}
:''Faerin, Anduin, and Alleria hop on mounts and fly off while Kyron stays on the ship.''

Down to the south. Reserves are marked and Kaheti nerubians are everywhere. Interacting with reserves spawn [[Kaheti Fighter]]s that count for this quest, so don't go on a killing spree before saving them!

When both objectives are completed, the ''Reckoning'' appears next to the [[Patient Lake Inn]]:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Everyone is evacuated! The nerubians are massing for another assault! Fall back!}}

Catch up with Alleria, Faerin, and Anduin at the top of the stairs leading to the inn:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Quickly! Before the nerubians overwhelm us!}}
