==Completion==
Thanks, <name>. I'll make sure to put in a good word with General Steelstrike for you. I know her well.

Well, I met her once.

Well, I saw her in the street.

But I did think about talking to her, so it's the same thing really.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|Take me to my parents home, <name>. We have things to burn.}}

Return to the half-destroyed shack:
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|I got some stuff from the house to burn in memory of my parents.}}
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|Normally we burn all the effects of the dead, but... they're all I have.}}

Interact with the sack of Parents Personal Effects to burn them:
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|Stupid fish people. They took everything from me.}}
:{{text|emote|Alyza turns away. Muffled sobs can be heard.}}
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|Any... Anyway you can take me back to the orphanage now.}}
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|There is nothing left for me here.}}

On complete, Alyza walks inside and upstairs:
:{{text|say|Sygfraed Siegepyr|Alyza! By the Flame--we had the guard out looking for you!}}
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|Well. I'm back now. Parents avenged. As I said I would. I'm going to bed.}}
:{{text|say|Sygfraed Siegepyr|Alyza... poor girl.}}
:{{text|say|Sygfraed Siegepyr|Thank you, <name>. I'm sorry about Alyza. Her loss was recent, and she is quite... intense.}}

She has new gossip upstairs, still equipped with her mother's helm and father's sword (what arm strength she has!):

{{dialogue|You're a good one, <name>. Killed lots of kobyss.

<Alyza sighs.>

Still though, it feels like we didn't really kill enough. Not really.

Ah well. Plenty more fish in the sea.}}
