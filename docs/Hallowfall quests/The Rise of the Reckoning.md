==Completion==
What fools we are.

==Notes==
Before taking off, everyone has gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Anduin Wrynn|We must keep the light of the Arathi alive, at any cost!}}
{{Dialogue|title=Faerin Lothar|We've saved everyone we can.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|These nerubians keep coming. 

Normally I would be grateful for my enemies to throw themselves at me in such a blatant manner, but they keep us from my true quarry.}}

The crew toss down a [[Rope Ladder (Hallowfall)|Rope Ladder]]. Climb aboard to start a [[The War Within in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]], Anduin is Lost:
{{#ev:youtube|LkwjZC4U8oo|Anduin is Lost}}

''Alleria climbs up the rope ladder and Faerin, already on board, reaches out a hand to help her up.''

{{Text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|We have to get out of here now!}}

{{Text|bossemote|Faerin|...Where's Anduin?}}

''Alleria looks down to see Anduin fighting a last nerubian on the balcony. He kills it and heads for the ladder, but stops himself when he sees the nerubians preparing a nearby ballista and aiming a Void-infused projectile straight at the Reckoning.''

{{Text|bossemote|Faerin|Anduin!}}

''Anduin holds up [[Shalamayne]] and looks at the empty hollow where the blade used to glow.''

{{Text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|The Light will return...}}

{{Text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Even if someone else carries the torch.}}

''Faerin notices what Anduin is about to do and runs to the edge of the deck to look down at him.''

{{Text|bossemote|Faerin|Anduin!}}

''Anduin grips Shalamayne and jumps off the balcony down at the ballista with an aggressive yell. Anduin smashes into the ballista with Shalamayne and destroys it, throwing off its aim and causing the fired projectile to miss the deck of the Reckoning by a hair's breadth. Alleria and Faerin watch as the nerubian horde closes in around Anduin next to the ruined ballista.''

{{Text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|No!}}

''The Reckoning flies out, leaving Alleria to look down at Anduin while leaning out from one of the ropes.''

After the cutscene, the player is aboard the Reckoning in the vehicle interface, controlling a ballista on the port side as the ship circles above Livia's Patience:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Curse them all! Where did they take him? Do you see Anduin?}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|They dragged him down! I lost track of him!}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Ash! We can't let them reach Mereldar! Blast them apart!}}

Players have two abilities:
:{{Abilities|Ballista Strike|id=434364|Call down a ballista strike.|range=250|cd=1 sec|notes=Instant. Ground-targeted AoE.|icon=inv_polearm_2h_odynspear_d_02}}
:{{Abilities|Leave The Reckoning|id=445855|Leave The Reckoning.|icon=ability_vehicle_launchplayer}}

Use Ballista Strike to blast the [[Nerubian Frontliner]]s and [[Crypt Lord (Hallowfall)|Crypt Lords]] swarming in Livia's Patience. At 15 kills, the view switches to Faerin on the starboard side:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Incoming! I'll show them the Sacred Flame's blaze!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Use Faerin's ability to fill an area with the holy flame!}}

This provides a second ability:
:{{Abilities|Faerin's Spear Strike|id=434277|Call Faerin to strike, filling an area with the Sacred Flame, which damages enemies every 2 seconds for 30 seconds.|range=250|cd=12 sec|notes=Instant.|icon=spell_holy_innerfire}}

At 45, the camera switches to Alleria at the bow:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|The darkness hungers. Let's give Xal'atath's forces a taste of their own shadows.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Use Alleria's ability to pull enemies together in an area, then take them out with ballista or sacred flame!}}

Ability #3 is:
:{{Abilities|Alleria's Hungering Void|id=445423|Call Alleria to create a well of void magic, which sucks in nearby enemies and stuns them for 15 seconds.|range=250|cd=20 sec|notes=Instant.|icon=inv_cosmicvoid_nova}}

At 100:
:{{text|bossemote|Move your view around the ship to see more enemies!}}
:{{abilities|Switch Focus|Change your focus to another part of the ship.|range=500|cd=1.5 sec|notes=Instant}}

At 150:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|We've beaten them back! Let's get Anduin!}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Hold on! We don't know what's down there! Reinforcements are on the way, we could wait--}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|We'll lose his trail!}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|You're right. Let's make those monsters pay for everything they've done!}}

Another real-time cutscene plays, Airship Tangled Up:
{{#ev:youtube|qrStczWtiy4|Airship Tangled Up}}

''The Reckoning quickly flies through the [[Whispering Chasm]] down toward the [[Ruptured Lake]] in Azj-Kahet. Nerubians on all sides fire ballista web-shots toward the ship but miss. A group of [[haranir]] walk away from the area, but one, [[Orweyna]], stops and looks back at the battle.''

{{Text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|Flames... they were ready for us.}}

{{Text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|Brace yourselves!}}

''A series of ballista shots manage to hit the Reckoning, trapping it in webs and bringing it to an abrupt halt. A swarm of [[nerubian flyer]]s immediately attack it. Meanwhile, on the ground, Orwenya comes running. As Alleria, Faerin, and the player character fight the attackers, a [[Nerubian spiderlord|spiderlord]] rears up behind them, only to be hit by a bolt of nature magic that instantly kills it by causing roots to sprout from its body. Alleria runs to the edge of the deck to look for where the magic came from and sees Orweyna running away.''

On the other side, the Reckoning has come to a stop above the Ruptured Lake. Turn in to Faerin. Turning in the quest awards [[Hallowfall (achievement)]].

Alleria has gossip:
{{Dialogue|I have hunted demons across the great dark. If Xal'atath thinks that she can escape me, then she is more foolish than I thought.}}
