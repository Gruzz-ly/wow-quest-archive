==Objectives==
Meet [[Hannan]] in [[Hallowfall]] to hear the plan.

==Description==
I am not blind. I know that they are tired and weary. But we are so close to figuring out what we can do about the [[Black Blood]].

The importance of what we uncover goes beyond Hallowfall, or the [[Azj-Kahet (kingdom)|nerubian kingdom]]. There is so much more work if we are to find a solution.

For now, let us withdraw and recover. Somewhere away from these creatures.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
Na'layro, Kai'shae, [[Ney'leia]], [[On'hiea]].

Hannan.

We are a family all on our own, here, far away from home.

I do not blame them for wanting to return, but I would blame myself if I gave up now. I must focus on what comes next.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|You are safe. Come, we must recover before continuing our fight.}}
:{{Text|Say|Hannan|Continue? Orweyna, we must retreat and speak.}}
:{{Text|emote|Ney'leia takes a long look at Orweyna, then shakes her head and sighs.}}
:''Orweyna leaves.''

Go to [[Rumshackle]] where Hannan is standing.
{{dialogue|There are things that are more important than this mission. We must take care of each other, even if it means leaving some questions unanswered.

We have been through too much for what we have achieved.

A [[The War Within in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] plays:

:On the other side of the cutscene, Orweyna stands alone.
:{{Text|say|Orweyna|I must press on. I must. If I do now, the Black Blood may consume all that I care about.}}
:Orweyna turns into a bat and heads to the [[Undersea]].

Head to the Undersea and meet up with Orweyna.
:{{Text|say|Orweyna|I cannot do this alone. Your aid is the only reason I can continue.}}
