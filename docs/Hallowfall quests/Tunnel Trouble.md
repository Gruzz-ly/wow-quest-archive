==Objectives==
Destroy 6 Nerubian Burrows.
* [[Nerubian Burrow]] Destroyed (6)
*Meet Great Kyron atop the Aegis Wall.

==Description==
It's good to have new allies here. Together, we have much better chances of protecting this [[Dawntower|tower]].

The [[nerubian]]s have overwhelmed us. If we're going to have any chance against them, we need to destroy the burrows they're using to come under the [[Aegis Wall|Wall]].

If you can handle that, we will survey the field from the top of the wall and meet you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to stop the nerubians from coming under the ground?

==Completion==
Excellent, <name>--if we don't have to worry about the nerubians stabbing us in the back, we can deal with those pouring through below.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Faerin|The dawntower won't be enough to hold them back. The nerubians have gotten braver.}}
:{{text|say|Great Kyron|We must ignite the keyflame on the wall. Its Sacred Flame will keep the nerubians at bay.}}
:''Faerin, Great Kyron, and Anduin walk off.''

Interact with [[Nerubian Burrow]]s and defeat the [[Dreadstrike Ambusher]]s that pop out. They likely have [[Shattered Remnants]] on them.

==Progression==
{{The Guiding Star}}
