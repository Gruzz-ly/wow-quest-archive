==Objectives==
Destroy the Shadow Rift.
*[[Shadow Rift (Hallowfall)|Shadow Rift]] destroyed
*Anguishing Nightmare slain
*Find Faerin and Anduin at the Cliffside Beacon.

==Description==
<Faerin speaks in a hushed, furious whisper.>

Good work. But before we can leave, there's something else.

Down this way are some powerful priests. I think they are summoning something-- something big. No doubt to strike at us above and drive us from [[Cliffside Beacon|the tower]] itself.

It will be dangerous, but we must stop them. Are you with me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*13,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Faerin's eyes are dark with weariness.>

It never ends, does it?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|If we stop that ritual, I should be able to cleanse the Flame!}}

Downhill, two [[Caller of the Gloom|Callers of the Gloom]] are channeling into a Shadow Rift. Take them out, then interact with the rift.

A [[The War Within in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|CY_3csd4JTY|Anduin's Light Reluctance}}

''Interior, Gloomcrag Bower. Faerin, Anduin, and the adventurer stand in front of the shadow rift as an [[Anguishing Nightmare]] pops out. Anduin lifts his right hand to try to call on the Light.''

{{Text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|Light be my...}}

''After a beat, not getting a response, he gives up and stares at his hand, starting to breathe rapidly. He closes his eyes for a moment, then clenches his hand, grabs his sword and charges the Anguishing Nightmare. Blood spatters dot his arm guard as he runs past. Anduin roars in rage, swinging his sword with fevor multiple times, then Faerin and the adventurer run to join him.''

On the other side, the darkness in the cave has intensified, and the adventurer has automatically equipped a torch that provides a small circle of light around them:

The [[Anguishing Nightmare]] attacks:
:{{text|yell|Faerin Lothar|Stand strong! The darkness won't take us today!}}

Kill it:
:''Anduin kneels down nearby.''
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Anduin, your Light... what happened to it?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|It doesn't matter. I'm no longer... worthy of it.}}
:{{text|emote|Faerin frowns.}}

Anduin's gossip:
{{Dialogue|We have to get out. There must be a way.

It's suffocating in here. Are we running out of air?

We have-- we have to get out.}}
