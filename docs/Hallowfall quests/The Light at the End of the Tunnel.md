==Objectives==
Escape [[Gloomcrag Bower]] with [[Faerin Lothar|Faerin]] and [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]].
* Faerin followed

==Description==
I've never seen shadows this deep. This... vicious.

It almost feels like they're reaching for us.

<Faerin shudders.>

We can't stay here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm glad you're safe. I sensed something amiss when those creatures suddenly stopped attacking the tower and disappeared. [[Beledar]] shifted on its own shortly after.

That was no simple illusion [[Xal'atath]] trapped you in. I wonder, was I its intended target?

You, me, Anduin, Faerin... perhaps she was happy to ensnare any of us.

==Notes==
On accept, two [[Hungering Shade]]s float down the tunnel and attack:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|More shadows. We're trapped in here, aren't we?}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|No. We're not giving up here!}}

Kill the shades with Faerin's help:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Let's go. We can do this if we stick together.}}
:''Faerin starts briskly walking up the tunnel. Anduin gets to his feet and follows some distance behind.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|The Light shines through you... but what if it goes out? What if you fail your people?}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|You think I've never failed? I've never made mistakes?}}

Kill another wave of three Hungering Shades. This time there's a [[Keening Shadow]] as well:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|I was never even supposed to be in Hallowfall. I stowed away to escape a family that only ever saw me as a failure.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Was it a mistake? I lost an eye and an arm for it. Does that make me unworthy of the Light?}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|I regret nothing. I keep fighting because in the darkness, it's all we can do. I can't give up. It's not in my nature.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|And I don't think it's in yours, either.}}

Kill a third wave:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|You don't understand. I've hurt people. I was [[Domination|controlled by darkness]], but... part of me enjoyed it.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Enjoyed hurting people? Or no longer being able to agonize over every thought and action?}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Having doubt, making mistakes... none of these make you unworthy, Anduin. They light your path forward.}}
:{{text|emote|Anduin looks surprised, but thoughtful.}}

[[File:The Light at the End of the Tunnel - exit.jpg|thumb|Exit's blocked.]]
Faerin and Anduin reach the exit, which is blocked by shadowy boulders.
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|The entrance... it's gone. There really is no way out.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Enough of your illusions, Xal'atath!}}
:''Alleria shoots and destroys the barrier.''
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Beledar's light has returned! Thank you, Alleria.}}

[[File:The Light at the End of the Tunnel - end.jpg|thumb|Anduin, Faerin, and Alleria outside the cave.]]
Alleria, Faerin, and Anduin walk out onto the surface, where Beledar has shifted back to light. Anduin has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|<Anduin looks up at Beledar, its light in his eyes.>

It really is something, isn't it.

Faerin's right. Seeing the Light return... you can't help but feel hope swell in your chest. Even me.

<Anduin shakes his head.>

I'm sorry for what I said back there. I shouldn't have been dragging you and Faerin down with me.}}

As does Faerin:
{{Dialogue|<The weariness seems to have drained from Faerin's face. She smiles as she takes in the Light of Beledar.>

Thank you for staying strong with me, <name>.

Beledar shifts of its own accord. I do not think our actions here influenced it, and yet...

<She smiles up towards Beledar.>

I can't help but love when it reflects the light in my heart.

You and your friends are newcomers here, and yet... I haven't felt this connected to anyone in a long time.

Thank you for coming here, my friend.}}
