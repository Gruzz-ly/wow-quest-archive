==Objectives==
Defeat the [[kobyss]] leaders besieging [[Velhan's Claim]].
* [[Droopfin]] slain
* [[Bristlespine (kobyss)|Bristlespine]] slain
* [[Sharpfang (kobyss)|Sharpfang]] slain

==Description==
Everything rises and falls on leadership, <name>. With a good leader, a unit can achieve almost anything. With a bad leader, chaos ensues and success moves out of reach. I've seen that first-hand.

Without leaders, the kobyss siege will break like a wave and everything else we do here becomes easier. I've seen three kobyss who seem to be leading the others--let me mark their locations on your map.

Deal with them, and we'll be much more able to help Velhan's Claim.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find their leaders? They look strong, but I'm sure you're up to the task.

==Completion==
Excellent. That will put us and the kobyss on a more even footing. At least in terms of leadership.

They still outnumber us by a lot, but one thing at a time.

==Notes==
Upon accept of both quests:
:{{Text|say|Aemyra Acton|We'll try to fight through to Velhan's Claim, while you soften the kobyss assault.}}  
:{{Text|say|Taenar Strongoth|They'll be relieved to see a pair of Lamplighters--well, they'll be glad to see one of us, at least.}}  
:{{Text|say|Aemyra Acton|What do you mean, Taenar?}}  
:{{Text|say|Taenar Strongoth|I'll explain on the way, Aemyra.}}  

Upon meeting with Taenar and Aemyra again. One can see them talking with [[Duke Velhan]] at the settlement in [[Velhan's Claim]]:
:{{Text|say|Duke Velhan|Taenar... long time. What brings you here to my part of Hallowfall?}}  
:{{Text|say|Taenar Strongoth|Your dawntower is unlit, Velhan. Aemyra and I came to investigate.}}  
:{{Text|say|Aemyra Acton|It's an honor to meet you, Duke Velhan! Taenar has told me about his service with you!}}  
:{{Text|say|Aemyra Acton|And, I've heard the stories, as well.}}  
:{{Text|say|Duke Velhan|Of course. We can deal with the kobyss, but you are welcome to assist if you choose.}}  

==Progression==
