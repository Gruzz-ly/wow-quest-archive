==Objectives==
Play with 3 [[Arathi Orphan]]s.
* Play with orphan (3)

==Description==
I still need more time with [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] to learn about [[Xal'atath]]. What I have learned is very worrying.

[[Faerin Lothar|Faerin]] sent word that she was going to the [[Orphanage (Mereldar)|orphanage]], and asked you to meet her there.

She often entertains the children while she is in Mereldar, I don't doubt she would appreciate you doing the same.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It's great to see how happy these kids are, after what they have gone through.

==Completion==
I love coming here whenever I visit Mereldar. The kids always bring a smile to my face, and I hope I do to them as well.

After everything they have been though{{Sic}}, they deserve happiness.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Faerin's at the orphanage. She was the first child to call it home. She visits whenever she can.}}

This quest completes criteria of [[Children's Entertainer]], one of the required achievements for [[Crystal Chronicled]]. Additional opportunities are available in the world quest version of this quest, [[Work Hard, Play Hard]].

Inside the Orphanage, [[Alyza Bowblaze]] starts [[An Orphan's Request]].

Outside the Orphanage, speak with any the set of three [[Arathi Orphan]]s holding swords:
{{Dialogue|We're looking for a big grown up to pretend to be a monster.

Can we slay you?

{{gossip|I can play.}}}}

This puts the player in a vehicle interface playing the role of a "Scary Monster" with the following abilities:
#{{Abilities|Scary Roar|id=448449|Roar scarily, so the brave Arathi Orphans can attack you!|icon=ability_druid_challangingroar}}
#{{Abilities|Taunting Flex|id=448463|Taunt the Arathi Children. No doubt you are an undefeatable monster!|icon=ability_physical_taunt_purple}}
#{{Abilities|Kaiju Chomp|id=448474|Chomp like a Kaiju! The Arathi Children will surely defend Mereldar from such a menace!|icon=ability_druid_ferociousbite}}
#{{Abilities|Scared Monster!|id=448481|The Arathi Children are too strong! Even a Scary Monster is too scared of them!|icon=ability_druid_cower}}

Using any of the abilities drastically depletes the player's health as the orphans pretend to fight back:
*{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|No monster can stand the might of the Arathi!}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|Hah! Take that foul beast!}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|Arathi Army! Take that monster down!}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|I'm not scared of you! Take that!}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|We're not scared of you, monster!}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|I'll kill you, until you die from it!}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|Hah! We are too scary even for monsters!}}

Upon losing all health, the player pretends to die and exits the interface:
*{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|That was lots of fun, <name>!}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|Great play acting, <name>!}}
*{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|Thanks so much, <name>!}}

Another set are looking at a target dummy. Interact with one then throw a rock at it:
:{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|Wow! That was a great throw!}}

If you throw stones at the windows of the orphanage, Sygfraed will complain from inside:
:{{Text|Say|[[Sygfraed Siegepyr]]|Oh no... Kids, stop throwing stones!}}

Speak with the lone orphan by the fence:
{{Dialogue|We're playing Floor is Undersea. You can't touch the floor or else the tentacles will get you! You have to run along the fence and get to the other side.

Do you want to play?

{{gossip|I can play.}}}}
This puts the player on the fence and ghostly tentacles spawn on the ground. Run along the fence, jump around the corners and on the barrel to get to the other end.
:{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|Wooo! Go, <name>!}}
:{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|<Name> soars through the sky with the grace of a skyray!}}
:{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|There goes my hero!}}
:{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|I believe in you, <name>!}}
:{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|Go, <name>! You can do this!}}
:{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|Nearly there! Tag me to finish the course!}}
:{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|Yay you made it. Well done!}}

One orphan is playing by the sand box:
{{Dialogue|We're playing hide and seek. One of us is hiding, and you need to find them!

Do you want to play?

{{gossip|I can play.}}}}
Follow the orb to the orphan to the southeast, who is seated in stealth between a building and a fence:
:{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|Wow. You're pretty good at hide and seek!}}

Two are playing tag near the sand box:
:{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|You can't tag me! You weren't it in the first place!}}

Upstairs in the Orphanage, 3 children are having a discussion:
{{Dialogue|We're having a disgustion... a dicusing... a talk about if nerubians or kobyss are scariest.

What do you think?

:{{gossip|Kobyss.}}
:{{gossip|Nerubians.}}}}

If you picked Kobyss:
:{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|I told you it was kobyss! They are all fishy and slimy. Yuck!}}

If you picked Nerubians:
:{{text|say|Arathi Orphan|Of course it's nerubians! Anything with more than six legs is creepy!}}

[[File:Mereldar's Light.jpg|thumb|Faerin in the Orphanage.]]
Inside, Faerin is reading a book to two more orphans. She has gossip:
{{Dialogue|Welcome to our orphanage!

When we arrived, I was the only child. They founded this for me. I'm not quite sure how [[Sygfraed Siegepyr|Sygfraed]] put up with me, I was quite rambunctious.

I love coming here when I'm in town. Despite everything, the kids are so bright and happy.

They are our future, and we fight for them.}}

On complete, bells ring:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|That's the warning bells of the main gate.}}
:{{text|say|Sygfraed Siegepyr|Children! Inside!}}
:''They all run in.''

==Progression==
{{Gathering Shadows}}

==Alpha version==
{{Rfa-section}}
In the alpha, Faerin's dialogue in the Orphanage stated "When we arrived ten years ago" but was otherwise the same.
