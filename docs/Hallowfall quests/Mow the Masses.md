[[File:Mow the Masses.jpg|thumb|Two [[Foulnectar Frond]]s]]

==Objectives==
Cut down 8 Foulnectar Fronds.
* [[Foulnectar Frond]]s destroyed (8)
*Return to Scout Wayshelm in Shadowmire

==Description==
[[Scout Maevest|Maevest]] and [[Scout Wayshelm|I]] broke away from the others and fled, their screams left in our wake. Foul muck smothered our lanterns and we stumbled in the dark through knee-high waters. I heard a splash like she had tripped and fallen in, but I couldn't bring myself to look back.

Only later did I find the tiny bite marks on my ankles. Be warned, there's something in the water.

I took notice of fronds growing from the pools. Swarming insects feast on their sickly nectar. Destroy those plants and starve the beasts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Stay out of the water if you can help it. If they latch onto you, those swarming insects can be shaken free with a few good jumps.

==Completion==
<Scout Wayshelm gives you an approving nod and finds a grim smile.>

In the dark, even the plants want us dead.

==Notes==
On return:
:{{text|say|Scout Wayshelm|When you stepped boldly into the mire, I felt a trickle of my courage return. I mustn't let you brave this darkness alone.}}
