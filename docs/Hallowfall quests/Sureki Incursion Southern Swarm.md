'''Sureki Incursion: Southern Swarm''' is one of three sureki daily quests for the [[Flame's Radiance]]. This quest takes place between [[Tenir's Ascent]] and [[Beledar's Bounty]] in southern Hallowfall. [[Meradyth Lacke]] has a small camp just outside Tenir's Ascent.

==Objectives==
Assist the [[Flame's Radiance]] in pushing back the Sureki swarm in southern [[Hallowfall]].
* Sureki swarm thwarted (0/100%)

==Description==
The Sureki aren't known to give up their assaults so easily.

Reports from our southern holdings have warned of a swarm stirring along the mountain range. 

I don't know whether they plan to hit [[Tenir's Ascent]] or [[Beledar's Bounty]], but we cannot wait for them to make the first move.

Join our allies and intercept the swarm!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Confiscated Cultist's Bag]]
* 55 [[Resonance Crystals]]
* 5 [[Weathered Undermine Crest]]
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Flame's Radiance]] (via [[Flame's Radiance (currency)]])

==Progress==
The nerubians have brought every foul, multi-limbed horror from the depths in this swarm! 

We cannot allow our holdings to fall!

==Completion==
Lady Faerin was right about you, <name>. We owe you our thanks.

You've bought Tenir's Ascent and Beledar's Bounty some much-needed time. 

We will manage the rest from here.

==Notes==
At camp are [[Meradyth Lacke]], [[Aemyra Acton]], [[Orren Masyn]], [[ELIZA]], an Arathi harvest golem, and [[Stoutheart]], Meradyth's lynx companion.

A few characters have something to say:
{{dialogue|title=Aemyra Acton|The decree of Flame's Radiance is one that burns especially bright for we Lamplighters. 

With many spread thin across Khaz Algar, those who yet remain in Hallowfall must rally and inspire others.

Orren hasn't wielded a weapon or donned his armor in many years, but it warms my heart to see courage lit within him.

We'll hold this place--Orren has ELIZA helping as well.}}

{{dialogue|title=Orren Masyn|It's good to see you again, <name>, though I wish it were under different circumstances.

When Flame's Radiance was decreed, Aemyra leaped up to answer the call and... well it's been some time since I've wielded a weapon.

My previous position as a logistics officer meant I didn't see much combat back home. 

But Aemyra has inspired me, just as the tale of Flame's Radiance inspires her.

I am proud to answer the call and stand at her side.}}

{{dialogue|title=Meradyth Lacke|<Meradyth stands at attention and salutes you.>

We meet at last, <name>. My fellow Lamplighters speak quite highly of you. 

Your arrival is most inspiring.}}
