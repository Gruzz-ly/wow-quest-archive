Join us. You have more than earned the right.

*[[Recipe: Beledar's Bounty]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Hallowfall Arathi Commendation]] (+500 [[reputation]] with [[Hallowfall Arathi]]) (first time) or 25x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
It's been such a long time since I had a meal with the entire family.

==Completion==
Ah, I needed this.

You are welcome to join us anytime, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Now to feast upon the spoils of our victory. Back to the house!}}

Sit down and try the stew:
{{Dialogue|<You notice a hefty chunk of carrot bobbing idly by before sinking into the depths.

You know what went into making this stew. One can only wonder how it'll taste.>

{{Gossip|quest=|Eat the stew.}}}}
If you totally failed to get good progress on the previous quest before time ran out:
:{{text|say|Auralia Steelstrike|I had braced myself for something terrible. But this is so much worse than I expected.}}
:{{text|say|Auralia Steelstrike|I... I think I need a bucket.}}
:{{text|say|Vaelisia Steelstrike|Nonsense! I ate carrots straight from the field when I was campaigning in the Empire. This is luxury by comparison.}}
:{{text|say|Auralia Steelstrike|Sure mum. Did you march uphill both ways as well?}}
:{{text|say|Auralia Steelstrike|Thankfully <name> was able to get us food earlier, and I had it cooked for this eventuality. Dig in!}}
If you managed to make solid progress, but didn't 100% the objective on the previous quest before time ran out:
:{{text|say|Auralia Steelstrike|I had braced myself for something terrible, and you have met my expectations. Well done.}}
:{{text|say|Tara Steelstrike|I like when the vegetables go crunch!}}
:{{text|say|Fynn Steelstrike|The General says that the more your stomach works, the more your brain works!}}
:{{text|say|Vaelisia Steelstrike|Fynn, I've told you to call me "Gran" when we are at home. Anyway, he's right. I'm right. You know what I mean.}}
:{{text|say|Fynn Steelstrike|Yes General, I mean Gran.}}
:{{text|say|Auralia Steelstrike|Thankfully <name> was able to get us food earlier, and I had it cooked for this eventuality. Dig in!}}
If you managed to 100% the objective on the previous quest before time ran out:
:{{text|say|Auralia Steelstrike|What... What is this? It has flavor, it even has seasoning. it has a full taste profile!}}
:{{text|say|Auralia Steelstrike|<name>, what did you do? Are you some sort of culinary wizard? Please, cook for us again!}}
:{{text|say|Fynn Steelstrike|Wow! This is really great! This is much better than we normally make!}}
:{{text|say|Tara Steelstrike|The vegetables crunch and are tasty! I didn't know it could be both!}}
:{{text|say|Vaelisia Steelstrike|I've never been a part of cooking a dish this good! Teach me your ways, <name>.}}

All of the Steelstrikes have gossip. [[Vaelisia Steelstrike]]'s gossip:

{{Dialogue|This was nice. I got a chance to be Vaelisia for a while, not just "The General."

It's good for even me to remember that I'm just a person, and even I need a bit of fun, once in a while.

{{gossip|What do you normally do to relax?}}

{{Dialogue-child|Here? Almost nothing. I haven't had many chances since the Day of Darkness.

But back in the Empire? Heh, you probably wouldn't have recognized me. I was quite the hell-raiser.

Prank and jokes, that was how I blew off steam. I always had a smile on my face, and a quick quip on my lips.

But those things are easy when everyday isn't a life-or-death situation, when you aren't losing friends constantly.

{{gossip|If we solve the problems here, what will you do?}}

{{Dialogue-child|I... don't know.

I expected to die in this place. It's been so long now that while I hoped the Empire would come to relieve us, I knew, deep down, they wouldn't.

How could they? They don't know we're here. As far as they know the expedition stopped sending messages and dropped off the face of Azeroth. Which, heh, isn't that far from the truth.

Maybe I'll stay here. Take up gardening? I've dabbled a bit outside, it's nice to grow things.}}

[[Auralia Steelstrike]]'s gossip:
{{Dialogue|Thank you for this. My mother hasn't had many opportunities for smiling in a long time.

We face a lot of loss. She's lost her partners, I've lost mine. But life needs to continue.

We need to try to find joy anywhere you can, otherwise, what's the point in living?

{{gossip|What's it like raising kids here?}}

{{Dialogue-child|Hard.

I had only recently joined the army when we left the Empire. I remember all the things I had when I grew up. The education, the libraries, the... peace.

They don't know any different of course. To them this is a perfectly normal childhood. But I know better.

{{gossip|Does your mum help you out?}}

{{Dialogue-child|No, because I won't let her. She has enough things to be worrying about without helping raise kids.

To be clear, she was the perfect mother to me. I felt cared for and supported growing up, but she needs to dedicate all her time to the army or we lose people. I make sure she has that time.

I want her to feel joy when she spends time with her grand kids, not feel like they're another job.}}

[[Fynn Steelstrike]]'s gossip:
{{Dialogue|When I grow up, I want to be a Lamplighter!

Lamps are pretty cool, I have a collection of them, and I like talking to Paige Ambleglow. She has the best lamps in Mereldar!

My Mum says that Lamplighters don't do much with lamps these days, now we have the Dawntowers. But I bet if I was a Lamplighter, I could bring lamps back.

{{gossip|What is it about lamps you like?}}

{{Dialogue-child|They glow. Like Beledar!

It makes sense when you think about it. All good things glow.

{{gossip|Not all good things glow. Some bad things glow too.}}

{{Dialogue-child|I bet those are just good things in training.

Mum says I always have to work at being good. It's probably the same for other things too.}}
}}

[[Tara Steelstrike]]'s gossip:
{{Dialogue|<Tara's previous shyness has vanished, and she is now gleefully waving a spoon around like a sword.>

When I grow up, I want to be an earthen! Mama says they are all rocky and have gems in them.

I've tried eating a gem before, but it was quite difficult. I've decided I have to start slow, crush up the gems, then it'll go down easier!

{{gossip|I think you would be the best earthen ever.}}

{{Dialogue-child|<You hear a groan coming from Auralia.>

Please don't encourage her.

<Tara interrupts and starts pointing to different parts of her face.>

I'm going to get gems here, and here, and here, and rocks in between! Then when I'm fighting, everything will bounce off me.

I'll be invincible!
}}

{{gossip|Has Auralia explained to you that you can't be an earthen?}}

{{Dialogue-child|Mum says I can't be an earthen. She says you have to be born that way.

But Mum also said I can be anything I want to be, so I feel like she's sending me mixed messages.}}
