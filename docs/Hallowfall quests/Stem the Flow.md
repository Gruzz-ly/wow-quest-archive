==Objectives==
Slay 12 [[Bloatrot Stinger]]s or [[Fungal Infestor]]s.
* [[Shadowmire]] monsters slain (12)
*Return to Scout Wayshelm in Shadowmire

==Description==
The roads were meant to be lit. But the path was overgrown, the lanterns dark. Swarming, frothing, and reeking with rot. It all happened so fast. By the time we realized the danger, the beasts were upon us. The largest of them was huge and black as night.

It is our duty to slay monsters and push back the darkness. But the thought of going back fills with me fear. 

I've lost my nerve. But you, outsider, can still make this right.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<[[Scout Maevest]]'s compass gleams in the firelight. [[Scout Wayshelm|Wayshelm]] has bound it with twine and now wears it around his neck.>

==Completion==
You're alive. Praise the [[Sacred Flame]].

==Notes==
On return:
:{{text|say|Scout Wayshelm|When you stepped boldly into the mire, I felt a trickle of my courage return. I mustn't let you brave this darkness alone.}}
