Use the provided [[Arathi Warhorn]] near friendly combatants to rally them.

Once done, head into the [[Sanguine Grasps]]. Various characters are present: [[Alleria Windrunner]] and [[High Exarch Turalyon]], [[Faerin Lothar]] and [[Anduin Wrynn]], and various unnamed characters: [[Tauren Plainswalker]]s, [[Forsaken Warlock]]s, [[Suramar Chronomancer]]s, [[Arachno-Pummeler Mk. I]]s, [[Zandalari Prelate (Hallowfall)|Zandalari Prelates]], [[Veteran Blood Knight (Hallowfall)|Veteran Blood Knights]], [[Horde Wolfaxe]]s, [[Stormwind Knight (Hallowfall)|Stormwind Knights]], [[Druid of the Claw (Hallowfall)|Druids of the Claw]], [[Dwarven Sharpshooter]]s, [[Rift Voidsinger]]s, [[Master Tidesage]]s, [[Night Elf Starcaller]]s, [[Lightforged Vindicator (Hallowfall)|Lightforged Vindicators]], [[Kirin Tor Defender (Hallowfall)|Kirin Tor Defenders]], [[Shining Warframe]]s, and [[Exodar Vigilant]]s.

Several characters have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=High Exarch Turalyon|I've known Alleria for many, many years. She still never ceases to amaze me.

The battle against the nerubians turned the moment Beledar shifted back to the Light. Somehow, I knew it was because of Alleria's efforts. That she had walked boldly into darkness and emerged victorious.

I... cannot bring myself to trust the Void, or the power it promises. But I trust Alleria with every fiber of my being.

For now, that is enough.}}

{{dialogue|title=Anduin Wrynn|Alleria knows something we don't. She's been distracted this entire battle.

Let me know when you're ready to catch up with her.}}

After completing the objective and approaching [[Thrall]]:
