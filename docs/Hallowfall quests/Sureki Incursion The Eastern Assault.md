There's no time to rest, <name>!

Our earthen allies in eastern [[Hallowfall]] have spotted a Sureki battalion preparing to attack [[Dunelle's Kindness]]--they must be targeting the [[Dawntower]]!

Flame's Radiance reinforcements are securing the town and [[Lothar's Landing]] as we speak.

Head east and lend what aid you can!

==Progress==
We will hold this position. Go, help Dunelle's Kindness below!

==Completion==
The people of Dunelle's Kindness thank you, <name>.

We will continue to hold [[Lothar's Landing]] with our earthen allies and fortify the town below. 

May the light of the Sacred Flame remain with you, friend.

==Notes==
Upon bandaging [[Injured Sentry (Arathi)]], they say one of the following:
*{{text|say|Thank you, <name>. Stay sharp out there.}}
*{{text|say|Bless you, soldier. I've a second chance now!}}
*{{text|say|I thought I was done for--thank you, friend.}}

Characters with gossip at camp are [[Izaeh Strongiron]], [[Sister Etna Blayze|Prioress Etna Blayze]], [[Foreman Duinth]], and [[Mylton Fyreswyd]].

Other characters include [[Maera Ashyld]] and [[Magpie]], Maera's lynx companion,  [[Machinist Kilton]], [[Marja Lenglow]], [[Claryssa Paller]], [[Valrin Paller]], [[Attica Whiskervale]], and a great number of unnamed [[Arathi Aeroknight]]s, [[Arathi Crusader]]s, [[Arathi Laborer]]s, [[Arathi Recruit]]s, [[Arathi Volunteer]]s, [[Arathi Warlynx]], [[Construction Haulbot]]s, [[Machine Ordinant]]s, [[Gundargaz Caretaker]]s, [[Gundargaz Workhand]]s, and [[Wounded Soldier (Hallowfall)|Wounded Soldier]]s.

Several characters have gossip:

{{dialogue|title=Izaeh Strongiron|I always loved to tell the story of the Flame's Radiance to the children back in Lorel's Crossing.

I didn't think I'd be repeating it just as often here on the front, but I suppose a well-told story is always good for morale.

I even brought [[A Spark of Radiant Flames|my own copy]], if you wish to read it!}}

{{dialogue|title=Foreman Duinth|With communications once again reinitialized with the Arathi, the Highspeaker deemed it necessary to repair this trade station. 

As machines fortune would have it, our work site happened to be stationed right above the nerubian ambush on Dunelle's Kindness.

Our deployed Ordinants and golems managed to secure the bridge long enough to allow the Flame's Radiance to mobilize from Mereldar.}}

{{dialogue|title=Mylton Fyreswyd|I remember you... from Nalina's tavern. She told you my story the day Beledar shifted...

I thought I had lost something that day. A part of me swept away in the darkness. 

It was fear that choked me, hanging overhead as my people endured the horrors around them.

<Mylton exhales slowly.>

I am still uncertain about my path. But the Flame's Radiance has re-ignited a small glimmer within me and so, I must do my part.}}

{{dialogue|title=Prioress Etna Blayze|After Murrpray and her loyalists were extinguished from the Priory, those who remained sought to rekindle our flame with Hallowfall. 

Many devout looked to me to fulfill the duties of Prioress. I was never interested in such a role, I am but a humble servant to the Sacred Flame. 

But my brothers and sisters needed someone to remake what was lost during that dark time. 

For now, I am who they need me to be.

With the Flame's Radiance decreed, the Priory has offered its full strength to the cause. Whether by blade or by faith, we are here to fight.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Kaeleb Flameguard|When Flame's Radiance is decreed, it is the duty of all Arathi to answer.

I and the other healers are ready to answer the call.}}

The book [[A Spark of Radiant Flames]] is on the table between Izaeh and [[Sister Etna Blayze|Prioress Etna Blayze]], and it reads:

{{book|content=
May the Flame's Radiance serve as a reminder that even in the darkest of times, a single torch can burn away the darkness.

Long ago, in the age of turmoil and strife, distant enemies moved against our great empire. Determined to meet her enemies head on, the Empress rallied her armies and summoned every soldier at her disposal.

The collected might of the empire marched off to war, the light of their torches growing dimmer on the horizon. And those left behind found themselves plunged into darkness. 

With no soldiers or guards to protect them, threats throughout the land encroached upon the vulnerable.

----

As the shadows closed in, it was the old war veterans--soldiers deemed too old or wounded to march off to war--who lit the first torch.

They donned their dusty, faded armor and drew their battle-worn blades. And then, they rallied the rest of the common folk. 

Crafters, farmers and laborers gathered around to hear their words. 

"The light of the Empress may be distant and faded, but the Sacred Flame still burns. Darkness may close in now, but we still bear our own flame. We shine with our own radiance. We shall not falter!"

By their radiance of their flames, both common folk and veterans rallied, holding strong against any threat.

----

Great battles were fought, and homesteads were lost. Yet in the end, the Arathi persevered. 

And when the Empires' armies returned and their light settled upon battle-scarred homes, the Empress mourned. In her righteous cause to protect the empire from outside threats, she had not seen the darkness that lurked within.

With praise, the Empress declared the act carried out by the people one worthy of sanctification. 

By her hand, she decreed it to be the "Flame's Radiance"--an edict sworn to all Arathi, young and old, trained and untrained.

Should the light of the Empire for any reason be absent or extinguished, the Flame's Radiance can be decreed to rally the people and protect the Empire.}}
