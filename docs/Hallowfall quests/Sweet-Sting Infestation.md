==Objectives==
Collect 10 vials of Wasp Venom
*[[Sweet-sting venom]] (10)

==Description==
Poor [[Sir Theleon Braunpyke|Theleon]]. I gave him some of his first lessons in combat. I'll see him to his final pyre.

But first, you. 

I've been trying to fight back an infestation of Sweet-stings harassing our wine-making operations. I need someone else to finish them off while I tend to Theleon's remains.

Be fast and clever and bring me some of their venom as you take care of things. We'll turn that into a poison for the nesting sites and be done with the nuisance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you kill those things?

==Completion==
Good job! You hardly look stung.

==Progression==
{{The Priory}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.0.2|note=Added.}}
