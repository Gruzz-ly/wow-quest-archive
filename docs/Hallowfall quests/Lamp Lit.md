==Objectives==
Place 8 torches around the perimeter of [[Velhan's Claim]], then observe the re-lighting of the dawntower.
* [[Arathi Torch|Torches]] placed (8)
* Speak with [[Taenar Strongoth|Taenar]] at the [[Dawntower]]
* Dawntower Lit

==Description==
The [[kobyss]] normally live deep underwater, <name>. When [[Beledar]] is at its brightest, they don't bother us. Other sources of bright light will usually keep them away, but definitely weaken them.

As [[Lamplighters]], we not only go into the dark to protect those in need, but we provide them the light that will keep them safe. Go set up these torches along the perimeter, then meet us up at the dawntower behind Velhan's Claim.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,150 [[XP]]
*[[Sturdy Arathi Censer]]
*{{wb|repitem=Hallowfall Arathi Commendation|repamount=500|faction=Hallowfall Arathi|altqty1=25|altitem1=Resonance Crystals}}

==Progress==
Did you get those torches set, <name>? The people will be able to quickly light them whenever Beledar fades.

==Completion==
You saved my son, <name>. You broke the spine of the attack on our home, gave us what we need to fight.

You helped me to be the leader I'd pretended I was. Thank you.

The Lamplighters will always have allies in Velhan's Claim.

==Notes==
After lighting the torches around the settlement go speak with Taenar at the Dawntower:
{{dialogue|
Lighting the dawntower will give the people of Velhan's Claim a real advantage over the kobyss, <name>. To say nothing of igniting their hopes and instilling courage.

}}
:{{Text|say|Taenar Strongoth|Duke Velhan, are you and your son ready?}}  
:{{Text|say|Duke Velhan|Indeed! May the light of this dawntower drive back the kobyss!}}  

They each say a line before throwing a torch into the flame:
:{{Text|say|[[Aemyra Acton]]|We light the Sacred Flame over Velhan's Claim.}}  
:{{Text|say|Duke Velhan|Light to keep us truthful and courageous.}}  
:{{Text|say|[[Maximillian Velhan]]|Light to keep us safe.}}  
:{{Text|say|Taenar Strongoth|And Light to remember lost friends. The Sacred Flame burns for us all.}}  

==Progression==
