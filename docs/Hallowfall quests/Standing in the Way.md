==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Bloodcrust Behemoth.jpg|Bloodcrust Behemoth|An unusually large beast strengthened by seeping blood.}}
Defeat the [[Bloodcrust Behemoth]].

==Description==
Some of these creatures are stronger than others. When we were able to act together and fresh to the fight, these creatures were no threat. Now our injuries and separation leave us vulnerable. 

My people are resilient, but we are not immortal. 

There is one beast larger than all the others. That beast is making it difficult for the haranir to return and recover. 

Slay it, so they can be safe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
*10 [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Once we are together again I know we will be able to regroup and continue.

==Completion==
<Orweyna nods.>

Thank you.

==Notes==
Find the [[Bloodcrust Behemoth]] in the [[Sanguine Grasps]] and slay it.
