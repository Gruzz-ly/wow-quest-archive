Those bells mean Mereldar is under attack! 

Let's get to the gates and find out what is going on.

You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,400 [[XP]]

We will make them pay for this, <name>. 

We will hit them so hard they never come back.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Mereldar's under attack! Children, stay inside!}}
:''She runs out.''

Head counterclockwise to the northwest, where Anduin, Steelstrike, Faerin, and Alleria are gathered with a company of six [[Arathi Stalwart]]s, looking west toward the [[Veneration Grounds]] where the [[Eternal Flame]] has been surrounded by a shadow barrier.
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|The kobyss strike our Veneration Grounds during Beledar's light. How?}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Look, General! [[Darkfire]]. This is [[Aelric Leid|Aelric]]'s doing.}}

They all have gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Anduin Wrynn|After what the kobyss did at [[Sunless Strand|the beach]]...

<Name>, we need to save anyone we can, we can't let them take more Arathi.}}
{{Dialogue|title=General Steelstrike|Light of the Flame, the kobyss have never attacked in such numbers before.

We need to push them back, and we need to stop whatever it is they are doing to the Eternal Flame.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Faerin Lothar|Aelric is behind this. I know it. I can feel it.

Whatever his plan is, <name>, we need to stop it.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|I can feel void emanations from ahead. Powerful ones.

This can only be Xal'atath's work.

Be ready, <name>.}}
