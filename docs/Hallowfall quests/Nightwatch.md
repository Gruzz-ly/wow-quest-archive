On accept:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Anduin, we need to talk.}}

[[File:Nightwatch - Alleria and Anduin.jpg|thumb|Alleria and Anduin on the wall.]]
Outside, there's a marked area for propaganda, as well as two marked spots. On the wall to the southwest, Alleria and Anduin are enjoying the view, with Alleria having gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|<Alleria and Anduin are standing on the wall looking at Beledar, the large crystal in the sky.>

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I wish you had heeded my warning and stayed in [[Dornogal]].}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|She is here, Anduin. The Arathi are in danger. We are in danger.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I needed to see if there were really descendants of the [[Arathor|Arathi]] down here. I'm the king of Storm--}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|So many human kingdoms have fallen. I needed to know if there were others.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|It was still a foolish risk.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|You're not the only one grappling with the voices in their head!}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|What have you been hearing?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Beledar, the "Emperor's Vision!" That prophecy that drew them here, it's the [[Radiant Song]] I'm hearing.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|You have been hearing the star?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Yes-- no, not really. When I [[The Hallowed Path|saw Beledar]] for the first time I had the vision again. It's related somehow.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I wish [[Khadgar]] were here. He'd know what it all meant.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|No. You're right. I wish he was here as well. We'll have to find our own answers.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I've gotten a look at the crystals in their [[keyflame]]s. It's not [[:Azerite]], but it is close enough that I think they are connected.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Then you've realized when Beledar shifted for the first time?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Their [[Day of Darkness]]... the same day [[Sargeras]] plunged [[Sword of Sargeras|that sword]] into Azeroth.}}

[[File:Nightwatch - Faerin and Raen.jpg|thumb|Faerin and Raen in the armory.]]
To the southeast is the armory, where [[Faerin Lothar]] is speaking with [[Raen Dawncavalyr]], the head armorer. They both have gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Raen Dawncavalyr|Faerin tells me you have been keeping her safe. Thank you, though she doesn't know it, many look to her for her positivity.

Her light acts as a beacon for others to follow, her loss would affect us all.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Faerin Lothar|<Name>, meet Raen, our head armorer.

She leads the team whose inventions have saved many lives since we landed in Hallowfall. Raen herself forged my shield.

I always enjoy coming here and seeing what new things her team has thought of.

{{gossip|Stay a while and listen.}}}}
:{{text|say|Raen Dawncavalyr|Faerin, I was inspired last Beledar's Shadow, I designed a new arm prosthetic. I think you'll wear this one.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Thank you Raen, but the shield you made me is all I need. I'm sure your talents would be better spent on other inventions.}}
:{{text|say|Raen Dawncavalyr|It's my pleasure to make a new arm you would use, Faerin! You told me about the discomfort and how it impacted your mobility. So I was thinking--}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Raen, no. I have lived with my injury since I was a child. I've learned to do everything from sword fighting to dressing myself with one hand.}}
:{{text|say|Raen Dawncavalyr|But what if I've figured out the weight balancing? You said that was what you didn't like about the first few I made.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Then I think some of our veterans who will lose an arm to the nerubians will be very grateful that you've improved the design.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Raen, I've learned to navigate my life without a prosthetic. I don't want to relearn everything.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|But if you want to improve something of mine, a better shock absorber on the shield would be a blessing of the Flame.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Those nerubians are getting bigger and it puts all that weight on the shoulder.}}
:{{text|say|Raen Dawncavalyr|Oh yeah? Hmmm... That's a tough one. Let me sketch out some ideas and get some measurements. I think that'll be an interesting project.}}
:{{text|say|Raen Dawncavalyr|Thanks, Faerin.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Keep up your work. Everyone on the front line appreciates the new kit upgrades.}}
:''Faerin walks off.''

While picking up [[Order of Night Propaganda]], citizens may chime in:
:{{text|say|Arathi Citizen|Those shadow-touched fools have littered our area again. We have to do something about this!}}
:{{text|say|Shipyard Hand|Curse the Order of Night. They have no business sticking their letters on my boat! I'm a good Empire-loving Arathi!}}

The propaganda comes in three varieties:
{{book|content=Arathi,

Your leaders lie to you, they sell you false hope. They say the light is the way, the Light is your salvation.

Look at the state of Hallowfall! If that were true, would Beledar be turning to the void? Would the Nerubians be attacking?

The Order of Night has seen the truth, the Light is not the way. Open yourself to the void, embrace the Harbinger, and through her we will remake Hallowfall.}}
{{book|content=Steelstrike and her cronies teach you to be afraid of the dark.

The dark is not your enemy, the dark is your friend!

Embrace it, give yourself into it fully, and it will protect you.

The Harbinger has come, embrace her protection, before it is too late.}}
{{book|content=Death comes to Hallowfall!

The Harbinger will protect you. Prostrate yourself before her and beg her protection! Only she can save us. Only through her can the Arathi people flourish.

Prostrate yourself, before it is too late.}}

At the barracks, inside the tent, are [[General Steelstrike]] and her daughter, [[Auralia Steelstrike]], the Arathi Quartermaster. Auralia starts [[Economical Request]], and the general has gossip:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Meet Auralia, our quartermaster. I'm also proud to call her my daughter.}}

{{Dialogue|Everytime we rotate our reserves through, I make sure to learn their names.

Many of them won't be coming back, the least I can do is remember them.

{{gossip|Why is your daughter the quartermaster?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
You suspect nepotism? Understandable, you haven't been here for long.

My daughter is, without a doubt, the backbone of the [[Arathi Army]]. I lead it, but she ensures it actually runs. She has a gift for organization that we desperately need.

I have tried to rotate her onto the front lines as part of our reserve rotation, as is only fair. I was overruled by the [[Priory of the Sacred Flame|priory]] every time.

{{Gossip|<Ask another question.>}}
