==Objectives==
Kill 13 [[kobyss]] invaders.
* Kobyss invaders slain (13)

==Description==
Judging by the glint in your eye, you wish to join [[Faerin]] in this madness?

To push into the kobyss waters? In the darkness?

You are a fool with a death wish.

Take as many of those damnable fish out as you can, before they drag you into the depths for their dinner.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We can't abandon the villagers here!

==Completion==
These foes are relentless.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Soldiers, with me!}}
:''Steelstrike and her unit walk into town.''
:{{text|say|Arathi Fisher|Help! I need--}}
:''Faerin and Anduin run down the path to the Sunless Strand and the Arathi Fisher, who is lying on the ground and near death.''
:{{text|say|Faerin|I'm more fighter than healer! Anduin, can you--}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Not... with the Light. But I know first aid.}}
:{{text|emote|Faerin nods to you and Anduin.}}
:''Faerin runs off into the kobyss camp.''

If you heal the injured [[Arathi Fisher]]:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Thank you, <name>. Please help as many others as you can find.}}

In the area, the bonus objective [[Release the Beasts]] is available. Take care of that as well for some bonus XP and gold. Faerin is off fighting kobyss on her own in an eastern corner of the camp:
{{Dialogue|Stay strong, my friend! We must rescue the villagers and slay these fiends!}}

Any kobyss unit will drop a [[Gasping Fish]], which starts [[Gasping Plea]]. (Alternatively, wait until you can begin the optional [[Targeted Recon]], which leads to the same questline.)

Kill and save everybody, then head back to Anduin and Faerin runs up:
:{{text|say|Arathi Fisher|You have our thanks, Faerin Lothar. And you too, outsiders.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|... Lothar?}}

==Progression==
{{Hope in Solidarity}}

==Alpha version==

The quest was named "Fish Are Food, Not Friends"

;Description
:Judging by the glint in your eye, you wish to join Faerin in this madness?

:To push into the kobyss waters? On their turf? In their darkness?

:You are a fool with a death wish.

:But I salute your mettle. Take as many of those damnable fish out as you can, before they drag you into the depths for their dinner.

;Completion
:I've heard of creatures that use lures such as lights in order to draw in prey. These kobyss seem to have learned to take it another step farther.

:The darkness can play tricks on your mind. I wonder if they learned from the shadows themselves...

This quest's name was a reference to the sharks' motto from ''{{wp|Finding Nemo}}'': "Fish are friends, not food."
