==Objectives==
Find 6 lost mementos.
* Mementos collected (6)

==Description==
Now that the job's done -- one thing I've always done on this route is muck around for some of the valuables that fall from the docks. As things get moved onto [[Arathi airship|ships]] small items can fall off. Sometimes people chuck 'em for luck or in rage, and the like.

But some of those items have memories in 'em. Things so precious that losing it might as well be losing part of your heart. If you could help me look I'd be grateful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Tarnished Compass]]
*[[Plush Lynx]]
*[[Broken Bracelet]]

==Progress==
What'd you find?

==Completion==
That's quite a haul. Take a few of these with you. Mayhaps you can find the owner of 'em.

==Notes==
Kill enemies or loot [[Sludge Pile]]s to find:
*[[Plush Lynx]]
*[[Knotted Aviator Scarf]]
*[[Small Hilt]]
*[[Rusted Torch]]
*[[Tarnished Compass]]
*[[Broken Bracelet]]

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Maera Ashyld|What do ya think, Mags? Did they do a good job?}}
:{{text|say|Maera Ashyld|Come back later, y'hear. I might be able to use your help again.}}

Completing the quest also awards the "Memories of the Sky" criterion of [[Sojourner of Hallowfall]].
