}}
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|Fine. but you better kill lots of kobyss for me.}}

For her to accompany once again, go to the orphanage in [[Mereldar]], head up stairs and speak with her:
{{Dialogue|You're a good one, <name>. Killed lots of kobyss.

Still though, it feels like we didn't really kill enough. Not really.

Ah well. Plenty more fish in the sea.
