==Objectives==
Kill 12 Kobyss warriors around [[Velhan's Claim]].
* [[Kobyss]] attackers slain (12)

==Description==
The problem I see, <name>, is the kobyss. There's just so many of them.

Everyone here was serving in the [[Arathi Empire|Empire]]'s military when we arrived in [[Hallowfall]]. They may be rusty now, but they've all trained before, and know how to be dangerous.

But we need to eliminate every disadvantage, including the kobyss numbers. So head out there and even up the numbers. [[Aemyra Acton|Aemyra]] and I will keep everyone safe here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How's it going out there, <name>? You sending those creatures of darkness back to the deeps?

==Completion==
You know, I've hated the kobyss ever since they were dragging my fellow stalwarts into the night as dinner guests.

Hopefully because of the work you've done, that won't happen to any of the citizens of Velhan's Claim, <name>.

==Notes==
Kill [[Murkfin Sciomancer]]s, [[Murkfin Depthstalker]]s, [[Murkfin Ravager]]s, [[Bristlespine (kobyss)|Bristlepine]], [[Droopfin]], and [[Sharpfang (kobyss)|Sharpfang]].
