I am afraid. But I can't just sit by and do nothing.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Scout Wayshelm|The beast makes its lair in that cave. I am with you, <name>.}}
:''Wayshelm runs off.''

Follow him in and aggro it:
:{{text|say|Scout Wayshelm|Together! For the fallen!}}

Finish it off:
:{{text|emote|Scout Wayshelm wipes the sweat from his brow with shaky hands.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Wayshelm|Thank you for guiding me to make this right, <name>. Let us return to Dunelle's Kindness.}}

Before leaving the cave, don't forget the [[Spore-Covered Coffer]] in the back!

On return to [[Captain Trueflame]] in [[Dunelle's Kindness]]:
:{{text|say|Captain Trueflame|I see. With the light of the road extinguished, you were blind to the ambush. These monstrosities will not cease until Hallowfall is snuffed out.}}

Wayshelm has new gossip:
{{dialogue|
I was ready to join my fallen comrades before you arrived. My people, our empire, need each and every one of us to repel the darkness.

I will remember what you've done for me. And I will remember them. Until next we meet, <name>.

:{{text|say|Scout Wayshelm|Aye, Captain.}}
