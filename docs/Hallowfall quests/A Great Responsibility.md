==Objectives==
Accept the tinderbox.

==Description==
To witness such corruption is deeply unsettling.

Despite the dark energies intertwined with this tinderbox, there remains a flicker of the [[Sacred Flame]], struggling to escape. I will not destroy that flicker, champion.

Yet I dare not hold onto it any longer.

Perhaps your purity of spirit can withstand the darkness it holds. Please, <name>, carry it with you. Protect that small spark of purity, and help it break free of the dark magic that ensnares it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
*[[Darkened Tinderbox]]

==Completion==
I place in your care this small ember of hope, along with the weighty responsibility to safeguard it.
