'''Economical Request''' starts the Striking Steel optional chapter of the [[Hallowfall storyline]]. [[Auralia Steelstrike]] will start the quest in [[Mereldar]] once players come across her while on [[Nightwatch]], during the third chapter of the main storyline.

==Objectives==
Write a letter of recommendation in Mereldar in Hallowfall.
* Suggest Additional Trading Partners
* [[Letter of Recommendation|Write a letter of Recommendation]]

==Description==
I hear you've come from the surface? Did you meet the [[earthen]]?

We used to trade with them but, after the Day of Darkness we struggled to send envoys. Those we sent, never made it back. Honestly, we thought that they had perished.

I'm going to try reaching out, again. I'd like for you to write a letter of recommendation, in case we did something to offend them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hope this goes well. We really need additional resources.

==Completion==
Thank you, I'll send send a runner with this to the Earthen. I pray they make it back safely.

And... thank you for the information about trade with your people, I hope they'll join as well.

==Notes==
Speak with Auralia again:
