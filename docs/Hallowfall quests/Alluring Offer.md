==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Chieftain Gillcarver.png|Chieftain Gillvarver|Insulated by kobyss forces, Gillcarver fortifies his kin's forces against land-walkers.}}
Lure and assassinate Gillcarver and his [[Kobyss]] Tidemarshals on the island off the [[Sunless Strand]].
* Use the Beguiling Lure (Optional)
* [[Sunless Tidemarshal]] slain (5)
* [[Chieftain Gillcarver]] slain

==Description==
It is done. Take this tidal charm, cloak your form in the darkness of the sea, and unmake the kobyss. Their strongest warriors gather and scheme against your kind upon that central island. With the lure, they will not see you for what you are. Use that advantage to become their end.

But understand, as the kobyss fail to, this is a power you borrow. It belongs to the sea.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*13,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Isolate them. Destroy them.

==Completion==
With this, the lesson has been given. They will think twice before considering my kind as meat.

You kill well, land-walker. But the power of the deep must be returned. Our time together nears its end.

==Notes==
The island is an elite area, watch out! Find a safe spot before landing and use the extra action button:
:{{abilities|Beguiling Lure|Become shrouded in illusory magic that allows the caster to lure and ambush kobyss.|notes=1.7 sec cast}}

This turns all the kobyss neutral, but watch out for the patrolling [[Sunless Shadowblade]], who have truesight.

Use the area of effect around the player to lure Sunless Tidemarshals up to [[Chieftan Gillcarver]], then use the new extra action button ability:
:{{abilities|Ambush the Lured|Release the dark magic of the lure, dealing 50% of each target's health as damage to all lured kobyss within 8 yards. Additionally, targets are stunned and take 100% increased damage for 6 sec.|notes=Instant}}

Gillcarver will occasionally wind up a Dispel Illusions cast if players are near him, so try to time the ambush around them.
