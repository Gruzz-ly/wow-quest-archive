==Objectives==
Light a torch with the Sacred Flame, then rally 6 groups of Arathi in [[Sina's Yearning]].
* [[Torch (Hallowfall)|Torch]] lit{{Co|55.15|32.72|Hallowfall}}
* Arathi groups rallied (6)

==Description==
I trust in your strength. I must ask you to go ahead to reinforce Sina's Yearning. [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] and I can see my people to safety in [[Lorel's Crossing]].

With the darkness and the [[kobyss]], the hearts of my people in Sina's Yearning will be faltering to fear. We can't let them wallow.

Light a torch with the Sacred Flame in the center of town and use it to inspire my people's valor. Remind them of their strength.

We will catch up with you. May the Flame guide you, my friend.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Lamplighter's Unlit Torch]]
* [[Lamplighter's Torch]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The [[Hallowfall Arathi|Arathi]] are strong. Proud. The kobyss may be vile but they will not win this day.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Arathi Fisher|If more of those fishy bastards try to-- Ah! My leg! I can't--}}
:''The injured Arathi Fisher tries to walk a few steps.''
:{{text|say|Faerin|Easy! We'll patch you up. <Name>, go assist the general in Sina's Yearning. We'll meet you there.}}
:''The Fisher walks back to her starting position.''

Anduin also has a {{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}} line:
:''Anduin stands up and he and Faerin walk aside.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Did I hear that right, earlier? You're a... [[Lothar]]?}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|You know the name?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Know it? I was named for [[Anduin Lothar]], one of [[Stormwind (kingdom)|Stormwind]]'s greatest heroes. He was close friends with my grandfather, King [[Llane Wrynn I|Llane Wrynn]].}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Few names hold higher esteem. You must be a lady, or a--}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|Oh no, don't you start using formalities on me! My family is noble, but it's been long since we've seen great fortune.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|To think I had relatives in the old world? Wonderful! I hope I can live up to such legends.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|Wait, if your grandfather was king of this... Stormwind, then--}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|Anduin, my new friend... are you a king?}}
:''Anduin goes back to kneeling next to one of the injured Arathi Fishers.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Not anymore.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|...So don't you start using formalities on me, either.}}

Head to the center of town, where [[General Steelstrike]] starts [[Something's Fishy]]:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|So you live! Is Faerin well?}}

Pick it up, then interact with the Torch behind her to pick it up. Use the extra action button at marked spots with Arathi Farmers and Kights fighting off against the kobyss:
:{{Abilities|Rally|id=433115|Rally the nearby group of Arathi with their faith in the Sacred Flame!|range=10|icon=spell_holy_avengersshield|notes=1.3 sec cast}}
*{{Text|say|Arathi Farmer|For the Sacred Flame!}}
*{{Text|say|Arathi Farmer|Have strength, we shall not fall here!}}
*{{Text|say|Arathi Farmer|Stand strong in the light!}}
*{{Text|say|Arathi Farmer|To arms! We will protect our homes!}}
*{{Text|say|Arathi Farmer|Together!}}

Fulfill both objectives and return to Steelstrike. Faerin and Anduin have caught up:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|I'm glad you're all right, Faerin. Now stop and take a breath for once.}}

On completion of both, a wave of shadow passes through town:
:{{text|say|Faerin|A wave of shadow! What just happened?}}
