==Objectives==
Place the Breastplate and Tinderbox in the forge at [[Mereldar]].
* [[Breastplate and Tinderbox]] (provided)

==Description==
It is our custom to pay homage to the fallen by burning whatever we can recover of their belongings. Usually, it is their tinderboxes as those are easier to carry. We then return those items to the [[Sacred Flame|flame]].

While we were able to retrieve [[Sir Ashrealm]]'s tinderbox, [[Ryton Blackholme|Ryton]]'s breastplate will serve to honor his memory.

You have placed your life in danger not only for [[Faerin Lothar|me]], but also for [[Hallowfall]]. I would be honored if you would assist me this one last time in remembering our fallen.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Honorable Arathi Breastplate]]
*[[Honored Soldier's Chainmail]]
*[[Arathi Defender's Breeches]]
*[[Mereldar Scholar's Leggings]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Thank you, <name>.

==Completion==
It is done. It feels both odd and somehow comforting to finally know my dear friend's fate with certainty.

Thank you for everything, <name>.
