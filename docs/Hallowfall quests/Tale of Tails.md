==Objectives==
Locate Beans, Beef, Thunder, and Cap'n Elaena. Then return them to [[Attica Whiskervale]].
* Lynx kitten [[Beef (imperial lynx)|Beef]]
* Lynx kitten [[Beans]]
* Lynx kitten [[Thunder (imperial lynx)|Thunder]]
* Lynx kitten [[Cap'n Elaena]]
* Attica's Cave Torch

==Description==
The newborn [[Imperial lynx|lynx]] have wandered off again!

Those rascally cats are always up to mischief, darting off without a care. With [["Peevish" Paeton Berncort|Peevish]] missing and only [[Vesper Stormiron|Vesper]] and I to hold [[Torchlight Mine|this position]], your assistance would be a boon!

I reckon those pesky felines are somewhere nearby. See if you can bring them back.

I would use a light and search the cave, the [[spider]]-infested area to the south, and the coast to the north.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Thunder (companion)]]

==Progress==
Have you found all the cats?

==Completion==
If these cat could talk they'd have quite the story to tell!

It looks as if one has taken a liking to you. I think you might have a new friend.
