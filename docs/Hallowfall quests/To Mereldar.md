You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Finally, a chance to rest.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|We need to return to Mereldar. I need to let the General know what happened here.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|This Order of Night is no mere cult. The Harbinger they speak of is [[Xal'atath]].}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|She won't stop. Your people need to be ready.}}
:{{text|emote|Anduin looks lost in thought.}}
:''They all exit the tower, hop on flying mounts (a [[candlefly]] for Faerin, [[gryphon]]s for Alleria and Anduin), and head westward in the direction of [[Mereldar]].''

At an airship landing point on the northeast side of town:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Aelric corrupted the [[dawntower]]'s flame? Ashes take that man... and this "Harbinger."}}

The named characters all have gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|content=I sense Xal'atath's hand in this Darkflame. We may have slowed her down, but she has plans within plans.

We need to be on the lookout for her next move.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Anduin Wrynn|This city is breathtaking. To see what the Arathi have built here in such a short time is incredible.

To think, while this was happening, we were fighting [[Burning Legion|the Legion]]. Then the [[Fourth War]], and [[Shadowlands|then]]...

Well. It's quite the sight.}}

{{Dialogue|title=General Steelstrike|You have done us a great service, <name>.

I have put the army on high alert for Aelric. If he moves, we'll know about it.

For now though, I think you deserve a break.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Faerin Lothar|Mereldar. I've been wanting to bring you here since we first met but, well, it's been one thing after another, as you know!

Steelstrike will make sure someone goes back to Cliffside Beacon to see to the tower and [[Kelther Hearthen|Keither]]'s{{sic}} body. In the meantime, we can finally breathe.

The walls keep people safe. Of anywhere in Hallowfall, this feels the most relaxed. You can unwind, even if just for a brief time.}}
