==Objectives==
Find and rally 3 Demoralized Recruits using the Patrol Torch.
* [[Demoralized Recruit]]s rallied to you (3)
* [[Patrol Torch (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
Greetings, <name>. I find myself in a dire situation.

Some fresh recruits and I were on patrol in these lands when our torches went out, leaving us utterly lost and disoriented.

I found safety in this house, but most of the recruits fled, confused into the darkness.

Will you help me locate them? I have a spare Patrol Torch. The mere sight of it should rally them to your side.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
*[[Lamplighter Supply Satchel]]
*{{wb|repitem=Hallowfall Arathi Commendation|repamount=200|faction=Hallowfall Arathi|altqty1=40|altitem1=Resonance Crystals}}

==Progress==
Have you found the recruits?

==Completion==
The time spent with you is much greater training than I could ever provide these recruits. One of them will remain here to aid you further.

==Notes==
[[Demoralized Recruit]]s have gossip:
{{dialogue|Do you carry the light?}}

When approaching Valeir Steelshot:
:{{text|say|Demoralized Recruit|The dark is everywhere.}}
:Upon using the patrol torch:
:{{text|say|Demoralized Recruit|<Name>, the light! There is hope after all.}}
:{{text|say|[[Valeir Steelshot]]|By [[Beledar]]'s light I will assist you, <name>.}}

When approaching Gaeret Velhan:
:{{text|say|Demoralized Recruit|Who is there?}}
:Upon using the patrol torch:
:{{text|say|Demoralized Recruit|<Name>, the light! There is hope after all.}}
:{{text|say|[[Gaeret Velhan]]|I will be brave in battle, like my uncle!}}

When approaching Lallie Fireclad:
:{{text|say|Demoralized Recruit|Please... help me.}}
:Upon using the patrol torch:
:{{text|say|Demoralized Recruit|<Name>, the light! There is hope after all.}}
:{{text|say|[[Lallie Fireclad]]|The flame is with me, I pledge to fight alongside you.}}

Upon completion, one of the recruits will remain in place of [[Yorvas Flintstrike]] with gossip and the ability to have them assist you in battle:
{{dialogue|
There is no place here for those that make shadows their home.

{{gossip|Would you aid me in battle?}}

Completing this quest is a criterion of [[Beacon of Hope]].
