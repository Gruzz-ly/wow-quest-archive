==Objectives==
Kill 10 kobyss in [[Hungering Pool|The Hungering Pool]] in [[Hallowfall]].
*[[Kobyss]] slain (10)

==Description==
The kobyss are... a bit larger than I expected, and I might--might, you understand?--have more trouble with them than I originally anticipated.

Kill any stupid fish-faces you see.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes, make them bleed. Make them pay!

==Completion==
You've killed a lot of them.

I wouldn't mind if you killed more. Just saying.

==Notes==
Alyzza's gossip before accept:
{{dialogue|Finally, an adult that will help me achieve vengeance.

Let's salt the bones of the kobyss. Let's burn their world to ashes!}}

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|Fine, maybe you can help with killing the kobyss.}}

She has new gossip too:

{{dialogue|content=Are you ready to kill some kobyss?

I'm ready to kill some kobyss.}}

Kill [[Kobyss Necromage]]s, [[Kobyss Slicer]]s, and [[Kobyss Shimmerfin]]s.

On kills:
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|Die you miserable kobyss!}}
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|Flame take you, fish-face!}}
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|Make them pay, <name>!}}
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|More, <name>. Kill more!}}
:{{text|say|Alyza Bowblaze|Not so tough now, kobyss! <name> is here to destroy you all!}}

Kill 50 kobyss with Alyza present to earn the [[Never Enough (achievement)]] achievement.
