Collect kobyss teeth from slain [[kobyss]].

==Description==
The Kobyss grow bold if they feel they can defile our veneration grounds. I think we should collect their teeth to wipe the smiles off their faces.

Come! [[Sir Theleon Braunpyke|My brother]] and I will cleanse our lands from this filth. Try to keep up!

==Completion==
A job well done, I think.

And you managed to keep up!

On accept:
:{{text|say|Baron Sybaestan Braunpyke|HA! These Kobyss shall not stand before our combined might!}}

Start moving south into [[Morgaen's Tears]]:
:{{text|say|Baron Sybaestan Braunpyke|To victory, my brother!}}
:{{text|say|Sir Theleon Braunpyke|Lead the way, Sybaestan. Wherever you go, I have your back!}}

While killing, they will say:
:{{text|say|Baron Sybaestan Braunpyke|Your discipline in battle is impressive, my brother. This outsider would do well to watch and learn.}}
:{{text|say|Sir Theleon Braunpyke|Forgive baestan, my new friend. we wouldn't have made it this far without your help.}}

:{{text|say|Sir Theleon Braunpyke|These kobyss have taken advantage of our fight with the Nerubians. They've grown bold, brother.}}

:{{text|say|Sir Theleon Braunpyke|These skirmishes tire me, brother. We should pace ourselves lest we fall to error.}}
:{{text|say|Baron Sybaestan Braunpyke|The Sacred Flame will sustain us, brother. Let the heathen draw the ire of the kobyss. We will then strike their unprotected flank.}}

:{{text|say|Sir Theleon Braunpyke|I fear I was not prepared for the sheer number of enemies we face, brother. A moment to regaip my strength.}}
:{{text|say|Baron Sybaestan Braunpyke|The outsider is capable of soldiering on, so should we. The emperor demands we push ourselves beyond the limits of our enemies.}}
