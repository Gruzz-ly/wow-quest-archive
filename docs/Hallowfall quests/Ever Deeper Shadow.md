==Objectives==
Slay 10 Order of Night cultists in the cave beneath the [[Cliffside Beacon]].
* [[Order of Night]] cultists slain (10)

==Description==
When I reached for the Flame, I felt the overwhelming hopelessness and despair that had been poured into it.

It pains me, but... my light alone is not enough to banish these shadows.

And so, we take a more direct path. If the remaining cultists have withdrawn to [[Gloomcrag Bower]], their combined power must be what's keeping the Flame dark.

We must stop them before this darkness spreads.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
These were once my people. My allies. My mentors.

I once tried to reason with them. Tried to make them see the [[Light]]... see that the Light is still within us all.

<Faerin's face flickers between sadness and anger.>

They wouldn't listen. And they're killing innocents.

I can't hesitate. Not anymore.

==Completion==
<Faerin's jaw is firm.>

They made their choice.

On accept:
:{{text|yell|Alleria Windrunner|Look out!}}
:''Ghostly shadow elementals and fog beasts appear outside the tower and start attacking. Alleria leaps outside and starts firing off arrows.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|What are those things?! They hardly seem real.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|A trick of the shadow. I will deal with them. You all go ahead.}}
:{{text|emote|Anduin nods.}}
:''Anduin and Faerin run off.''

Head to the cave beneath the tower and get to killing. Once the quota has been met, catch up with Faerin and Anduin in front of a tunnel leading down to a [[Shadow Rift (Hallowfall)|Shadow Rift]] being maintained by the [[Caller of the Gloom|Callers of the Gloom]].
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Quickly, <name>! Aelric is nowhere to be found, but these traitors are wielding powerful darkness up ahead.}}

Anduin has gossip:
{{Dialogue|Once I would have been unable to understand what drove these cultists to the shadows. How they could harm their own.

Now...

<Anduin sighs.>

I know all too well how the darkness sinks its claws into you. Bleeds you out and doesn't let you go. Distorts everything with its lies.

I am fortunate to have people who saved me before it tore out my eyes and made me blind to the suffering of others.

Not everyone here was so lucky.}}
