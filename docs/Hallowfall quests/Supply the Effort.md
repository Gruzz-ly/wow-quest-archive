==Objectives==
Recover various stolen items from the surrounding area to satisfy our needs.
*Recover any supplies you can find (0/100%)

==Description==
When shadow fell upon our town, many necessary supplies were taken in the cover of darkness.

With the light returning, it is time to rebuild, but first, we must retrieve what was lost.

Search the surrounding areas, recover any supplies that might be useful.

You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}

==Progress==
Have you recovered the stolen items?

==Completion==
You have recovered far more than we could have hoped.  I've set some of the extras aside for you to have.
