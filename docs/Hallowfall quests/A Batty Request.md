==Objectives==
Collect 10 [[Shacklefang Leafnose]] Meat.
* [[Shacklefang Leafnose Meat]] (10)

==Description==
I'll gather a selection of our major trade goods before we head out for the meet up, but I could use some help in gathering some additional items.

Lately we've been struggling with collecting the best bat meat in [[Hallowfall]]. Could you gather some before you come to [[Dunelle's Kindness]]?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you get the meat?

==Completion==
Excellent. We just haven't had the resources to pull people off the wall to gather the meat with all those wasps around.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Auralia Steelstrike|The General and I will meet you at Dunelle's Kindness, <name>.}}

[[Shacklefang Leafnose]] bats, [[Shacklefang Hornet]]s, and [[Tough Ivy]] are all on the top layer of the [[Fangs]] and [[Rumshackle]].

After finishing all three quests, head to [[Dunelle's Kindness]], where [[Auralia Steelstrike]], [[General Steelstrike]], [[Teha]], [[Merrix]], and [[Andee Seabraid]] have gathered:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Merrix.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|Vaelisia.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|We thought your people were dead.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|Same. Good to see that you aren't.}}
