==Objectives==
Interrogate the local clergy.
* Suspicious Clergy questioned (5)

==Description==
All the dead are missing? How can that be? They were all laid out in preparation for their pyres. Who would want to move them? Someone must have seen something.

Go ask anyone in the area who might have seen something and I'll go talk to some of the upper clergy. We'll get to the bottom of this and return our dead so they can be properly tended to.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find anything out?

==Completion==
They attacked you? And said the Prioress is involved? That does not bode well.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Sister Etna Blayze|We'll get to the bottom of this, <name>.}}
:''Etna walks off.''

Speak with [[Helpful Clergy]], [[Pious Disciple]]s, and [[Vitner Monk]]s. Clergy not in on it will say:
*{{text|say|I don't know anything about that. Does the Prioress?}}
*{{text|say|Missing Bodies? I wonder if the Prioress knows...}}
*{{text|say|How can a body be misplaced?}}
*{{text|say|Are you sure you were looking in the right place, outsider?}}

Suspicious clergy will turn hostile when confronted:
*{{text|say|Our dead are not your concern, outsider!}}
*{{text|say|The prioress said they would not understand!}}
*{{text|say|We do as the Prioress commands! Her will is unquestionable!}}
*{{text|say|Prioress Murrpray is not to be questioned!}}

Fend them off:
*{{text|say|The Prioress will hear of this!}}
*{{text|say|The will of the Prioress will be done!}}
*{{text|say|You'll understand her vision soon!}}
