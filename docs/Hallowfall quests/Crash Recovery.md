==Objectives==
Retrieve 4 Recovered Tinderboxes from the [[Indomitable (airship)|Indomitable]]'s stalwarts.
*[[Recovered Tinderbox]] (4)

==Description==
A lot of things went wrong when the Indomitable crashed, <name>. But the most upsetting one is that--when the order was finally given to make our way back to [[Mereldar]], we couldn't honor our fallen comrades.

It seems the [[kobyss]] reanimated our fallen stalwarts, who now wander the Indomitable in a ghastly [[Skeleton|skeletal]] form.

Take back their tinderboxes. If we can deliver those to the [[Sacred Flame]], they'll finally be free after all these years.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find those tinderboxes, <name>?

==Completion==
The flame burns for us all, <name>. I wish I could have saved them that night, but I'm glad we'll be able to honor their memories.

It's what we all would want, if it happened to us.

==Notes==
Upon recovering the tinderboxes:
