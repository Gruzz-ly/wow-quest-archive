'''A Concerned Friend''' is an optional breadcrumb to the optional "Rest at Last" chapter of the [[Hallowfall storyline]], offered by [[Val Thalvassa]] in central [[Dornogal]] at level {{Level|tww-max}}.

==Objectives==
Meet [[Great Kyron]] in [[Mereldar]].

==Description==
Ah, <name>, there you are! Great Kyron was asking after you and your friend [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]].

I think they want to talk to you about [[Faerin Lothar|Faerin]]. Nothing urgent mind you, she probably just needs some good company. But we're all a bit worried about her.

Check in with Kyron when you have a moment, will you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I hope the journey wasn't long.

==Progression==
{{Rest at Last}}

==Patch changes==
