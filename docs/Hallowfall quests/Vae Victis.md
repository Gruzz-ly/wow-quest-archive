{{Questportrait|Sharpscale the Devourer.jpg|Sharpscale the Devourer|Sharpscale has been terrorizing the Hungering Pool for some time.}}

Kill Sharpscale the Devourer and retrieve its head in the [[Hungering Pool]] in [[Hallowfall]].
* [[Sharpscale the Devourer]] slain {{co|48.8|53.9|Hallowfall}}
* [[Sharpscale's Head]]

==Description==
Ah it's time.

Kill their leader. Salt his bones, take his head, and laugh as his tribe crumbles!

Sharpscale's last moments are upon him, and he doesn't even realize it yet. 

Stupid fish-face.

==Rewards==
You will receive:

*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
His skull would make a good cup I think? Perhaps a mantle ornament?

==Completion==
Oh. This head is quite a bit more icky than I was expecting. You can keep that.

You are much more useful than I thought you would have been, <name>.
