==Objectives==
Collect [[Sir Theleon Braunpyke|Theleon]]'s remains.
* Inspect funerary platform

==Description==
Theleon was a good one, but now we must commit his body to the Flames.

[[Baron Sybaestan Braunpyke|Sybaestan]] is in no shape to bear his brother. Would you collect his remains from among those others awaiting their final rest?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You're strong and you have the distance Sybaestan lacks right now.

==Completion==
Gone? All the bodies are gone?!

==Notes==
Head west and interact with the [[Funerary Platform]] that has a placeholder of Theleon on it:
{{Dialogue|<Theleon's body is missing.

You notice that all the other bodies awaiting funerals are missing as well.

You should probably report this to Sister Etna.>}}
