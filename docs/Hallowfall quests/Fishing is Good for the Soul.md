==Objectives==
Meet Shinda at the fishing hole.
* Meet [[Shinda Creedpike]] by his fishing hole
* Clear the creatures around the fishing hole (4)

==Description==
I used to fish with my mother at the local pond when I was a child. It wasn't the fish that made the experience--my mother was famously terrible at cooking--but the tranquility and bonding time.

Perhaps I could find a portion of that peace again here. There's a spot south of Mereldar that the others use to fish. I'll meet you there!

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,150 [[XP]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Hallowfall Arathi Commendation]] (+500 [[reputation]] with [[Hallowfall Arathi]]) (first time) or 25x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
Maybe I can find peace in the act of fishing.

==Completion==
I wish we could have fished. But if today confirmed anything to me, I have relearned a valuable truth.

If I lay down my sword, these children would have to pick them up if they are to survive this place. They have known no other place than this land.

They will see our homeland. They must see our homeland.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Shinda Creedpike|I haven't fished in decades. I'm getting excited just thinking about it.}}

Upon reaching the fishing spot Shinda is found alongside [[Bruvv Tearon]] protecting [[Anastaria]] from [[Enraged Kodiak]]s:
:{{text|say|Shinda Creedpike|We must protect the children, <name>! Clear the fishing hole!}}

Anastaria has gossip:
{{dialogue|Mister Tearon told me he'll teach me to fish, but there's too many of these things around. Once I grow up, I'll be strong enough to fight these off for my elders!}}

Procede to slay some of the nearby [[Enraged Kodiak]] or [[Horrific Baelgat]].
