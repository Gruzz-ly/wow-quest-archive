'''Return to the Sea''' concludes the optional "Crushing Depths" chapter of [[Sojourner of Hallowfall]], part of the [[Hallowfall storyline]].

==Objectives==
Take the Peculiar Fish to deeper waters.
* [[Rehydrated Fish|Collect the fish]]
* Drop the fish in deeper waters in [[Bleak Sand]]

==Description==
I remain weakened by my time so near the searing [[Light]] of the surface. I ask that you take me to deeper waters, away from these [[kobyss]], where I can return to my kind.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Fathom Incher]]
*{{Cost|11|70}}
*5,600 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Hallowfall Arathi]]

==Progress==
This is far enough.

==Completion==
<A warbling cry emanates from the fish. It casts its song into the ocean depths.>

I expected an ignoble end at the hands of the kobyss for my folly. Never could I have believed a land-dweller would be my savior. I will remember you. Now, let the facade be at its end. My kind will be expecting me.

<The fish's form begins to shift and unwind. You realize its guise as a fish has been yet another illusion.>

==Notes==
Pick up the fish, fly north to the marked location, use the extra action button to drop it again.

On complete, the fish reveals its true form, and an [[Abyssal Leviathan]] rises up from the deeps further afield:
:{{text|whisper|Peculiar Fish|Our cooperation is at an end. Now, I return to the sea beneath the sea, away from this accursed star. Bring its Light to our depths and we shall be your crushing end.}}
:{{text|whisper|Peculiar Fish|Let us not meet again. The thought of your drowned corpse displeases me.}}

==Progression==
{{Crushing Depths}}

==Patch changes==
