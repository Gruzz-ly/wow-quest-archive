On accept:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Flames... Arathi! Mount up! Light's Redoubt calls for help! We bring hope into the darkness!}}
:''Everyone walks east.''

Head southeast to [[Light's Redoubt]] and land on the deck of [[The Reckoning (airship)|the ''Reckoning'']]:
:{{text|say|Great Kyron|Livia's Patience is overrun. We must buy the villagers time before the Reckoning can launch.}}

New gossip all around:
{{Dialogue|title=Great Kyron|The populace of Livia's Patience is being abducted.

The Lamplighters are helping, but there are too many nerubians.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Faerin Lothar|Livia's Patience. So many people.

By the flame, I was here only a few days ago. We have to help them, <name>!}}
{{Dialogue|title=General Steelstrike|We have to stop this here, <name>. Flames, we cannot survive if this is not stopped.

At least here we can use the power of our airships. The Reckoning's guns will turn this tide.

We just need the time to get it ready.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Anduin Wrynn|The Arathi have been knocked back once again.

It's up to us to help them stand firm. We need to do what we can to hold back this tide.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|I feel her. Xal'atath is behind this. I can feel her desperation behind this push.

I must resume my hunt... after we help these people.}}
