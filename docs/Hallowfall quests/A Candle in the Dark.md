==Notes==
[[File:Crossroads of Twilight.jpg|thumb|The heroes in front of the shield.]]
Before moving in, everyone has gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=General Steelstrike|We've lost the Eternal Flame.

Light of the Empire, we've lost everything.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Faerin Lothar|Aelric... he's dogged our steps for too long.

Now we have him cornered. Now we can take him down.

I have waited too long for this moment!}}
{{Dialogue|title=Anduin Wrynn|The Arathi have been through so much.

We must do what we can, <name>. This is when they need our help the most.}}

[[File:A Candle in the Dark - Alleria vs shield.jpg|thumb|Alleria bringing down the shield.]]
Talk to Alleria:
{{Dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|This odious man... He reminds me of [[Dar'Khan Drathir]].

Let us hope he stays dead.

{{Gossip|quest=|Bring down the bubble.}}}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Aelric thinks the shadows will save him. He should see what true power looks like...}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Alleria, be careful.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|We are well past that.}}
:''Alleria channels a Void beam into the shield around the Eternal Flame, gradually bringing it down and destroying it. She falls to her knees.''
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Now! Go for the kill!}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Hold back these kobyss! Today they taste ashes!}}
:''Four [[Ragefin Carver]]s (unattackable by the player) spawn and start fighting Steelstrike, Faerin, and Anduin.''

Run west to Aelric and aggro him:
:{{text|say|Aelric Leid|The Harbinger spoke of you.}}

At 50%:
:{{text|say|Aelric Leid|She has taken an interest in you.}}

At 10%:
:{{text|say|Aelric Leid|Harbinger! Do not forsake me!}}

When Aelric falls, an [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cinematic]] plays, Faerin's Rallying Speech:
{{#ev:youtube|IJvVZOnLGew|Faerin's Rallying Speech}}

''Faerin walks to up to Aelric's body where it lies in front of the still-dark Eternal Flame.''

{{Text|bossemote|General Steelstrike|How... how could any Arathi be in league with such monsters?}}

''[[Arathi Stalwart]]s gather near Steelstrike and she turns to address them.''

{{Text|bossemote|General Steelstrike|The Sacred Flame is lost!}}

{{Text|bossemote|General Steelstrike|Fall back!}}

''Three of the stalwarts begin moving out, but the others stand still.''

{{Text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|No!}}

''The moving stalwarts stop and turn around again.''

{{Text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|We cannot keep retreating from the darkness!}}

{{Text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|Our fear has overshadowed our faith.}}

''Faerin turns around and looks up at the darkened Beledar.''

{{Text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|Beledar may have guided us, but it is not what will save us.}}

{{Text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|Stand with me against the shadow!}}

{{Text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|Show this Harbinger the true strength of the Arathi.}}

''The Stalwarts cheer and applaud.''

{{Text|bossemote|General Steelstrike|And if you fall against the darkness, what will we do then?}}

''Anduin comes walking and joins the crowd of Stalwarts. Faerin looks at him when she replies.''

{{Text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|It's what we always say, General, the Light will return. Even if someone else carries the torch.}}

''The Stalwarts begin to line up. Anduin looks around at them. Faerin turns around to face the Eternal Flame.''

{{Text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|We are the seekers of Light.}}

{{Text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|We are the holders of hope.}}

{{Text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|In the very heart of shadow...}}

{{Text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|Together, we guide the way.}}

''The Eternal Flame turns back to Light, and moments later Beledar does the same.''

On the other side, the Eternal Flame has been restored to normal. Steelstrike stands in front of it, Faerin and Alleria by themselves to the south, and Anduin with a group of Arathi Stalwarts to the north, with two smaller groups of Stalwarts present as well.
