==Objectives==
Distribute 8 spears to the residents of [[Velhan's Claim]].
* Spears distributed (8)

==Description==
<Name>, the people of Velhan's Claim have been locked up inside, afraid of the dark, for too long.

And there's plenty to fear out there, but these are capable, strong people. They should be driving the [[kobyss]] away, not hiding behind their walls.

Get these spears to the people of Velhan's Claim. They've learned to hide from their problems, but we'll give them the means to take their lives back!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you handed out those spears yet? The people need them to remind them what they're capable of.

==Completion==
I think now we'll see them acting very differently, now that they're armed, <name>.

There's something about knowing you can take care of yourself, that you can handle your own problems, and you don't need anyone to rescue you.

Of course, we [[Lamplighters]] will always be there to help, but it's very likely that we won't be needed next time.

==Notes==
Upon accept go talk to [[Velhanite Citizen]]s:
{{dialogue|Yes, <name>?

{{gossip|quest=|Here's a spear to defend Velhan's Claim.}}

*{{Text|say|Velhanite Citizen|If it's my time, I'm going to go out fighting.}}  
*{{Text|say|Velhanite Citizen|At least I'll have a chance if they get inside.}}  
*{{Text|say|Velhanite Citizen|It's only fair that I give this back to one of the kobyss.}}  
*{{Text|say|Velhanite Citizen|The kobyss are going to regret coming out of the water.}}  
*{{Text|say|Velhanite Citizen|The kobyss will pay for what they've done to us.}}  

At the top floor, one can see that [[Maximillian Velhan|Maximillian]] is missing, and the kids that were with him earlier say:  
:{{Text|say|Velhanite Child|I hope Max is okay. The kobyss were scary!}}  
:{{Text|say|Velhanite Child|They didn't get him--I saw him run away.}}  
:{{Text|say|Velhanite Child|Then when will he be back?}}  

Upon return:  
:{{Text|say|Velhanite Child|...so I thought we'd better tell you where Max had gone before something bad happens.}}  
:{{Text|say|Duke Velhan|What? Maximillian is outside, with the kobyss? By himself?}}  
:{{Text|say|Duke Velhan|We need to rescue him.}} 

Upon completion:
:{{Text|say|Duke Velhan|I must speak to you at once, <name>!}}

==Beta==
Upon completion:
:{{Text|say|Duke Velhan|Speak with me at once, <name>! My son is in danger.}}
