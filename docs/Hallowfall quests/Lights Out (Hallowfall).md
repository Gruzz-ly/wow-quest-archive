==Objectives==
Meet [[Taenar Strongoth|Taenar]] and [[Aemyra Acton|Aemyra]] near [[Velhan's Claim]].

==Description==
Name's [[Aegor Irynbawnd|Aegor]]. I try to keep tabs on [[Lamplighters]] in the field and assess what areas of [[Hallowfall]] may be in need of their aid.

The [[dawntower]] fell dark at Velhan's Claim a few weeks ago. Based on what's been happening around Hallowfall, it's probably because of the rising tide of [[kobyss]].

Lamplighters Taenar and Aemyra are heading there, but this might be more than even two Lamplighters together can handle. Will you meet them there and help them restore the light at Velhan's Claim?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Pleased to meet you, <name>. I'm Taenar, and this is Aemyra.

The dawntower at Velhan's Claim went dark a while ago, and with all that's been happening, we're only just getting here to help.

We did some scouting, and it seems the area is overrun with kobyss. I imagine Velhan's holed up inside, instead of fighting them off.

Good thing for his people that we're here. And it's better still to have you along helping.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{Text|say|Aegor Irynbawnd|I can't imagine what would keep Duke Velhan from being able to keep his dawntower lit.}}
:{{Text|say|Aegor Irynbawnd|Whatever it must be, the Lamplighters will probably need help, <name>.}}

Upon approaching Aemyra and Taenar at [[Velhan's Claim]]:
:{{Text|say|Aemyra Acton|I've not gone to light the Velhan's Claim dawntower before. I wonder if I'll meet Velhan himself.}}  
:{{Text|say|Taenar Strongoth|That may not be the honor you think it is, Aemyra.}}  
:{{Text|say|Aemyra Acton|What? Every Arathi knows about Velhan's leadership on the Day of Darkness.}}  
:{{Text|say|Taenar Strongoth|True. Every Arathi knows the story...}}

[[Aemyra Acton]] has gossip:

{{dialogue|I'm glad you're here with us, <name>.

{{gossip|How did you come to be a Lamplighter?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Like everyone here, I came to Hallowfall with the Armada, seeking the source of the Emperor's Vision. We were all sure it was going to lead us to the glorious battle of Renilash.

Instead, a lot of our ships crashed when we were teleported underground, and the rest of us have been here since. Having no night was an adjustment, but when the crystal darkened a few years later, I'd never been more afraid.

I found my way through that fear by helping others. Over time, it became more and more clear that my place here was with the Lamplighters. Having a purpose keeps the fear at bay.

{{Gossip|I have another question.}}

{{gossip|Who's in charge, you or Taenar?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
We're working together to protect and bring light to those in need. No one's in charge. We cooperate and watch each other's backs.

Taenar has been a Lamplighter longer than me, and I've learned a great deal working with him. Though I think he'd say he's learned a lot from me, as well. We work together, though--neither of us is over the other.
