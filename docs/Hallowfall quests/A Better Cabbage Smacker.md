'''A Better Cabbage Smacker''' takes place at the [[Whirring Field]] in northeastern [[Hallowfall]].

This quest is a criterion of [[Sharing the Light]].

==Objectives==
*[[Gyro-Optic Spring]] (12)
*[[Cleanbrass Bolts]] (5)
*Find and return [[Control-Gear]] to [[Ezgi Irongear|Ezgi]]

==Description==
:{{text|say|[[Great Kyron]]|The harvesters work the land with the strength of ten Arathi. Yet the shadow corrupts even our machines.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10 [[Valorstone]]s
* [[Lamplighter Supply Satchel]]
* 200 [[Resonance Crystals]]

==Completion==
{{text|say|Great Kyron|Your efforts are appreciated! With uncorrupted harvesters, we can retake these fields and feed the towns of Hallowfall.}}

==Notes==
*{{item|Gyro-Optic Spring|s}} drop from [[Dark-Crazed Harvester]]s.
*[[Cleanbrass Bolts]] can be found on the ground or looted from Dark-Crazed Harvesters or the [[Crazed Cabbage Smacker]]. Picking them up off the ground is more efficient.
*[[Control-Gear]]s can be found on the ground in the northern part of the Whirring Field. Interacting with one will tie a rope to it, allowing it to be dragged. [[Ezgi Irongear]] is located at the Whirring Field's [[keyflame]]; when the keyflame is fully lit, he'll have a yellow circle around him where the gear can be delivered.
