==Objectives==
Destroy 4 siege weapons below [[Tenir's Ascent]].
* [[Keg of Black Powder]] collected (4)
* Siege weapon destroyed (4)

==Description==
<Name>, if we're going to hold the [[nerubian]]s back, we have to deal with their siege weapons.

Around Tenir's Ascent, there are kegs of black powder to supply our [[Arathi airship|ships]] for combat. Since the nerubians have caught these ships on the ground, let's put that powder to work.

Gather some barrels, and take them down to the nerubian siege weapons.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*13,950 [[XP]]
*[[Arathi Demolition Charge]]

==Progress==
Were you able to destroy their siege weapons, <name>?

==Completion==
With those siege weapons destroyed, we're in much better shape. Faerin went ahead to light the [[Dawntower]] with [[Great Kyron]]. She asked that we meet them there.

==Notes==
After accepting, Faerin has gossip:
{{Dialogue|The nerubians vastly outnumber us, but our armada gives us the firepower and mobility to outmatch them in a given battle.

That's why it's so vital that we protect the air docks, and especially the Dawnbreaker.

It's good to have your help in this, <name>.}}

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Faerin|Kyron, the dawntower isn't lit. If [[Beledar]] should shift...}}
:{{text|say|Great Kyron|You're right. Your new friends can protect the people. We must ignite the [[Sacred Flame]].}}
:''Faerin and Great Kyron run off.''

Loot 4 [[Keg of Black Powder]] from [[Blackpowder Barrel]]s around the docks, then place them in ghost images next to the siege weapons on the western front to blow them up. Turn in to Anduin, still on the Dawnbreaker, who has gossip text:
{{Dialogue|It's amazing to see what the Arathi have been able to achieve in Hallowfall, in their years here, with no help from the outside.

They'll make strong allies.

And if we can protect the Dawnbreaker, I'm sure they'll be able to push back the nerubians.}}
