==Objectives==
Kill 10 Shacklefang Hornets.
* [[Shacklefang Hornet]] slain (10)

==Description==
We haven't been able to gather resources from this area due to hornets moving in.

We just haven't been able to spare the resources from the wall to deal with them. If you can, we'd all appreciate it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Damn those hornets. Wasps were bad enough when they were the size of my finger.

==Completion==
Thanks, <name>.

I hate those things. Seriously, who thought it was a good idea to have wasps the size of a lynx.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Auralia Steelstrike|The General and I will meet you at Dunelle's Kindness, <name>.}}

[[Shacklefang Leafnose]] bats, [[Shacklefang Hornet]]s, and [[Tough Ivy]] are all on the top layer of the [[Fangs]] and [[Rumshackle]].

After finishing all three quests, head to [[Dunelle's Kindness]], where [[Auralia Steelstrike]], [[General Steelstrike]], [[Teha]], [[Merrix]], and [[Andee Seabraid]] have gathered:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Merrix.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|Vaelisia.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|We thought your people were dead.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|Same. Good to see that you aren't.}}

==Beta==
;Description
I'm sorry for asking so much from you, but the reason we haven't been able to gather these resources is wasps have moved in recently. 

We just haven't been able to spare the resources from the wall to deal with them. If you can, we'd all appreciate it.
