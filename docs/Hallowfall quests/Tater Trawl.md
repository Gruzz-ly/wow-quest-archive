==Objectives==
Light 15 Harvest Torches and gather 5 Firelight Spuds.
* [[Harvest Torch]] lit (5)
* [[Firelight Spud]] (15)

==Description==
Harvesting in this area has become a challenge, with crazed Harvesters destroying most of our crops. There are potatoes to be found if you look closely.

If you light the harvest torches, you might uncover some potatoes hiding in the shadows.

Using those lights, gather as many potatoes as you can. Every bit helps in these trying times.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Hallowfall Arathi Commendation]] (+200 [[reputation]] with [[Hallowfall Arathi]]) (first time) or 40x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
Have you found any spuds?

==Completion==
This is perfect. We love fried potato fingers, we're going to cook up some of those tonight!

==Notes==
Completing this quest is a criterion of [[Beacon of Hope]].
