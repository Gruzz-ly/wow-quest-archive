==Objectives==
Collect 4 Game Pieces from [[Arathi]] in [[Mereldar]].
* Game Pieces borrowed (4)

==Description==
[[Light's Gambit]] is an old and honored game. There's a reason so many Arathi play it!

It can teach you a lot about strategy. And it can tell you a lot about your opponents.

<Faerin suddenly deflates.>

But we're still missing a few pieces that we need in order to play.

Sometimes, folks around Mereldar lend us pieces for a game. Could you ask around?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
The rules are a bit lengthy but trust me... it's worth it!

==Completion==
We... might have gotten a bit ahead of ourselves.

==Notes==
On accept, Faerin and Anduin head up the stairs to the third floor:
:{{Text|say|Faerin Lothar|So in Light's Gambit, we'll take opposite sides of the board, and try to take each other down with our piece's abilities--}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|We should wait for <name> to get back to explain the rules.}}
:{{Text|say|Faerin Lothar|Right! Right. We can go set up the table. And get some drinks! <name>, meet us at the game table upstairs when you're done!}}

[[Kiera Horth]]{{Co|43.98|49.72|Hallowfall}} in the [[Communal Kitchen]]:
:{{Gossip|Faerin wants to know if you have a Light's Gambit game piece to spare?|quest=}}
:{{Text|say|Kiera Horth|Of course, here's a piece, though [[Beria]] may have chewed it a bit. Don't let Faerin beat you!}}

[[Marja Lenglow]]{{Co|40.32|51|Hallowfall}} in the [[Church of the Sacred Flame (subzone)|Church of the Sacred Flame]]:
:{{Gossip|Faerin wants to know if you have a Light's Gambit game piece to spare?|quest=}}
:{{Text|say|Here's one. Are you going to play a game with Faerin? Let her know I'm ready for a rematch whenever she is.}}

[[Keth Wernt]]{{Co|41.77|55.83|Hallowfall}} on the second floor of the [[Orphanage (Mereldar)|Orphanage]]:
:{{Gossip|Faerin wants to know if you have a Light's Gambit game piece to spare?|quest=}}
:{{Text|say|Keth Wernt|Aw, but Gerrigon the Great was about to have his final battle with the Shadowlord!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Peara Wernt]]|It's okay, we can use Clary's doll!}}
:{{Text|say|Keth Wernt|Oh! Do you think Clary might want to play with us?}}

[[Cargen Fairleifen]]{{Co|43|56.85|Hallowfall}} in the armory area:
:{{Gossip|Faerin wants to know if you have a Light's Gambit game piece to spare?|quest=}}
:{{Text|say|Cargen Fairleifen|Here's a piece I made to go with some custom ability rules I'm working on!}}
:{{Text|say|Cargen Fairleifen|Let Faerin know the new abilities are almost done, will you? I'd love to have her test them out.}}

Faerin and Anduin are seated by a Light's Gambit board on the third floor of the Lamplighter Headquarters. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Faerin Lothar|Oh, firecrackers, did I forget to explain base powers? Well, if your unit collects enough--}}
:{{Text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Ah, <name>! Sorry, I think we got a little ahead of ourselves. Faerin's already explained the rules-- well, most of them, anyway.}}
:{{Text|say|Faerin Lothar|You're just in time for the best part, the combat! Come join us!}}
