==Description==
Guard our ways, repel the dark. Civilize this twisted land. All in the name of our empire. This is the mission of the Arathi Army. A mission I can heed no longer.

I am afraid.

I won't go back into the dark. Not after what I've seen. If [[Scout Maevest|Maevest]] or any of my other companions survived, they must crave the mercy of a swift death. And I left them to that terror.

Tell [[Captain Trueflame]] her scouts died in darkness, one and all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Scout Wayshelm gazes into the flames of his campfire.>

==Completion==
<Scout Wayshelm clutches the compass tight and finally raises his gaze to regard you.>

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Scout Wayshelm|I won't go back into the darkness. I can't.}}

Head to the marked location to find the corpse of [[Scout Maevest]] on the edge of a pond. Don't get in the water, or the Itching Waters will lead to a Parasitic Infestation. Interact with the corpse and three [[Parasitic Wasp]]s pop out!
:{{text|emote|Parasitic Wasps violently emerge from the scout's disturbed corpse.}}

Also popping out is [[Maevest's Compass]]. Fend off the wasps, pick up the compass, and return it to Wayshelm.

On complete, Wayshelm has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|I am all that remains of my patrol. The others, my comrades... I failed them.}}
