Time to cook!

==Notes==
On accept, Dolena starts cooking:
:{{text|say|Dolena|Alright then. Get to chopping.}}

Stand in the circle. The UI changes to show these abilities:
#{{Abilities|Peel Garlic|id=||icon=}}
#{{Abilities|Cube Taro|id=||icon=}}
#{{Abilities|Mince Herbs|id=||icon=}}
#{{Abilities|Ask Question: Cave?|id=||icon=}}
#{{Abilities|Ask Question: Recipe?|id=||icon=}}
#{{Abilities|Ask Question: Vegetables?|id=||icon=}}

While chopping the vegetables, one can ask Dolena questions. One can ask Dolena about why they camp in [[Growling Hollow|this cave]]:
:{{text|say|Dolena|No one bothers me here. They're all afraid of the fungarians.}}
:{{text|say|Dolena|Or maybe they're afraid of me. Haha!}}
:{{text|say|Dolena|Either way, camping here means that I only have to interact with people on my terms.}}
:{{text|say|Dolena|Unless an adventurer like yourself comes around, I suppose. But you're alright.}}

One can ask Dolena where they learned this recipe:
:{{text|say|Dolena|The original recipe? Ancient history.}}
:{{text|say|Dolena|Used to work with this bloke--hardest working cook I've ever met. We all resented him for it. Made us look bad.}}
:{{text|say|Dolena|He taught it to me. His version used potatoes instead of taro.}}
:{{text|say|Dolena|I wonder if he's still alive. Would love to show him how much better my version is.}}

One can ask Dolena about how vegetables grow down here:
:{{text|say|Dolena|The taro? It's native. Or, at least, it was here before I was.}}
:{{text|say|Dolena|As for the garlic? Who knows. It shouldn't, that's for sure.}}
:{{text|say|Dolena|Live down here long enough, though, and you learn to save your energy for the mysteries that hurt.}}
:{{text|say|Dolena|No sense questioning the ones that fill your belly.}}

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Dolena|Alright, that'll do. Come grab a bowl if you'd like.}}
{{Dialogue|Well? You staying or going?

{{Gossip|<Stay a while and eat quietly>}}}}
