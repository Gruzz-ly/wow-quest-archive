:{{text|say|Keyrra Flamestonge|This bracelet was a gift from Skiela, my sister who stayed behind. I lost it fairly early into our time in Hallowfall.}}
:{{text|say|Keyrra Flamestonge|Aevery yelled at me when I lost it. We had petty arguments before that but nothing on that scale. Thinking back on it, it's probably when our relationship started falling apart.}}
