==Description==
Sorry my daughter roped you into this. I'm sure you had better things to be doing.

She has terrible manners. I'll have to have words with whoever raised her.

<The general's mouth twitches in a quick smirk.>

Still, you are here. Would you like to join us for the more enjoyable activity? We're about to start cooking.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Why do they say a pinch of salt? Why not a handful? More ingredients has to be better.

==Completion==
Hah! Oh flames, I had forgotten how much fun cooking can be!

I really needed that.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Join us in the communal kitchen, <name>.}}

Joining the Steelstrikes in the [[Communal Kitchen]]:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Let's start on the basics. Chop up the tough vegetables. Throw the cheese in the pot.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|It's soft. It'll melt. Eventually.}}

Auralia Steelstrike can be found seated in a corner:
{{Dialogue|I'm staying well out of the way of this mad house.

The kids love cooking with their grandmother. Flame only knows why, it's barely edible in the end.

It's fun to watch though.}}

Chop the vegetables and throw cheese into the pot:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Things might get a bit... hot. If a fire breaks out, just splash the cooking pot with water.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Stew needs water anyway, it's a win-win. Give it a try.}}

Throw water into the pot and speak to the general:
{{Dialogue|Stew is best when you get as many ingredients in the pan as you can!

Are you ready to get the pots on fire, and chop the vegetables in the pan?

{{Gossip|quest=| I don't think that's how--}}}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Let's cook!}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Throw as many ingredients in the pot as you can!}}
:Pick up vegetables, cheese and spices around the kitchen throw them into the pot within the time limit.}}

:The pot will occasionally burst on fire:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Fire! Douse it with Water!}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Fire's out. Throw more things in the pot!}}

Sample the stew, its taste depends on how well you did. If you did bad:
{{Dialogue|<While lacking in any coherent flavor or texture, this is still technically edible.

It can be served.>}}

If you did ok:
{{Dialogue|<You've had better dishes in the middle of a battlefield, or sitting at the side of a road.

That said, you've also had worse dishes. It can be served.>}}

If you did well:
{{Dialogue|<Given the method of its making, this stew is surprisingly adequate.

It can be served.>}}
:{{Gossip|quest=|I want to try again.}} (to repeat the cooking process)
:{{Gossip|quest=|Good enough!}} (completes the quest)
