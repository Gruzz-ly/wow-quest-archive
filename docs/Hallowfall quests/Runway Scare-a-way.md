==Objectives==
Kill 25 moths either by flying through them or killing them normally.
* [[Flickering Glowmoth]] slain (25)

==Description==
'Lo there.

Me and [[Magpie|Mags]] are generally in charge of clearing the sky in this area during our [[Lamplighters|Lamplighting]] route. If we don't cull the [[moth]]s in the area, they start spreading up towards the skydocks and start laying eggs in the machinery of [[Arathi airship|our ships]].

Unfortunately we're not as spry as we used to be. Could you lend a helping hand? They're pretty frail so they'll squish easily to any high velocity flight. Or you could just smack 'em the old-fashioned way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Nasty critters...

==Completion==
Kill one of 'em and four more somehow pop up. Well, this will help. We can take care of the rest.

==Notes==
Maera has gossip:
{{dialogue|Well, I didn't expect to see anyone out here today. How can I help?}}
