==Objectives==
Explore [[Mereldar]].
* Meet [[Faerin Lothar|Faerin]], [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]], and [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] at [[Empire's Edge Tavern|Empire's Edge Inn]]
* Buy [[:a Round of Drinks]]
* Hand out the Drinks (4)

==Description==
I have to admit, I did not think that the first visitors we'd have in Mereldar would have been outsiders. I thought [[Arathi Empire|the Empire]]... Well, nevermind.

You have been more than helpful to my people, and that deserves recognition. Mereldar is the bastion of the Arathi in Hallowfall. Take some time, rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|17|55}}
*8,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This city has much to see.

==Completion==
It's been good to sit down and breathe for a bit.

==Notes==
On accept, Faerin, Anduin, and Alleria walk up the path into the city:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|We should grab some food at the inn while we can. One of the general's rules I happily follow.}}
:{{text|emote|Anduin looks meaningfully at Alleria.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Perhaps a moment's rest is warranted?}}
:{{text|emote|General Steelstrike glances towards the tower you just came from, rubs her chin, and frowns towards the ground.}}

Catch up with them in the inn, seated at a table:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|<Name>, can you order a round of drinks?}}

Before doing that, they all have gossip:

{{Dialogue|title=Faerin Lothar|At some point, you'll have to try our Imperial Wine! It's made with grapes from the [[Priory of the Sacred Flame|Priory]], and is heated with the [[Sacred Flame]].

We only drink it on special occasions, so just drinking it is enough to conjure thoughts of good times.

{{gossip|What can you tell me of the [[Arathi Empire]]?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I was young when we left, but I have some memories.

I remember the parades through the city streets, everyone would be out and cheering as the army walked by. I remember the [[Imperial lynx|lynxes]] in ceremonial armor, resplendent and regal.

I remember the park near where I used to live, my parents would take me for walks there, and we'd feed the animals.

Most of all though, I remember the feeling of belonging. I remember my family. I remember my friends.}}}}

{{Dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|<You see Alleria scanning the people entering and exiting the inn.>

Any one of them could be an [[Order of Night]] member.

Any one of them could have the information I need.

{{gossip|How are you doing?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
You think this is the first time I've lost friends? I've lived a long time.

In the Thousand Years War, I saw planets burn. I lost [[Lirath Windrunner|my brother]] to the [[Old Horde|Orcish Horde]] in the [[Second War]]. I lost [[Sylvanas Windrunner|my sister]] to herself.

[[Turalyon]] and [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]], I... haven't spent as much time with as I would like.

[[Dalaran]] isn't the first time I have lost people.

{{gossip|Dalaran wasn't your fault.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
It was my job to stop [[Xal'atath|her]].

Not only did I fail, but I failed so catastrophically that a city was destroyed.

I may not have caused Dalaran's destruction, but it happened because of me.

{{Gossip|Is [[Vereesa Windrunner|Vereesa]] safe?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
She's safe, thank the stars.

She moved away from Dalaran a few years ago. I stop by when I'm able to but my work keeps me busy.

Much as I love my sister, she is the least of the things I need to worry about at the moment.

{{gossip|We're here for you if you need us.}}

''Alleria has two responses here, one for players who, assumedly did not complete the Legion campaign. The second appears to be account wide rather than per character, though this may be a glitch having to do with [[Warbands]]'':

{{Dialogue-child|
Thank you.
}}
''Those who have (completed the Legion campaign?) will see:''
{{Dialogue-child|
Thank you.

After [[Xe'ra]] imprisoned me, I had given up all hope of seeing Azeroth again. Of seeing my son. After you rescued us, I got to see both.

And now, I am deep in the bowels of Azeroth, with the very person who saved me from another planet.

It would be nice if this ended the same way.}}}}}}}}}}

{{Dialogue|title=Anduin Wrynn|<Anduin looks lost in thought as he stares at his drink.>

{{gossip|What's on your mind?}}

''Anduin has two responses here, one for players who did not fight [[Anduin Wrynn (tactics)|his encounter]] in the [[Sepulcher of the First Ones]]. The second appears to be account wide rather than per character, though this may be a glitch having to do with [[Warbands]]'':

{{dialogue-child|<Anduin looks over too{{Sic}} you.>

<Name>. You've been so helpful down here, as always. How do you do it?

Ever since the Shadowlands, I...

I'm struggling.

{{gossip|That wasn't you.}}
}}
''Players who fought Anduin instead see:''

{{dialogue-child|<Anduin looks over to you.>

<Name>. You've been so helpful down here, as always. How do you do it?

How can you even look at me, after what happened... after what I did to you?

I tried to kill you.

{{gossip|That wasn't you.}}
}}

''Both options converge to:''

{{dialogue-child|It felt like me.

I remember the rage. I remember the hate. I remember the... exhilaration. Satisfaction, even.

Were they my emotions, or [[Zovaal|his]]? I don't know, but I felt them.

In my nightmares, I still feel them.

<Anduin sighs.>

Maybe Faerin's right. Maybe I need to let it go. But I never understood how. How can one just decide one day to feel better about everything?

Maybe it just means to keep moving forward.

{{Gossip|<Ask another question.>}}
}}

{{gossip|What are your thoughts on the Arathi?}}

{{dialogue-child|Honestly? I'm still reeling. I didn't expect to find that there's an entire empire across the sea when I started on this journey.

The [[Arathor|Arathi empire]] of our world collapsed so long ago, and has dwindled down to the smallest remnant now. To find that the empire continued to flourish across the sea...

But still, we are dealing with such a small portion of the Arathi. Are they normally this friendly, or do we need to be worried?

{{Gossip|<Ask another question.>}}
}}}}

Speak with [[Nalina Ironsong]], the innkeeper:
{{Dialogue|Nice to meet you. I take it you are the outsider I have been hearing so much about?

{{buy|{{text|rare|(Quest)}} Purchase a round of drinks.}}
}}

[[A Round of Drinks]] costs {{cost||10}}. After purchasing, players catch part of a conversation:
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|The cats are trained as well as the soldiers are. When one bonds to you, you have a friend for life.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Do you have a lynx?}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Oh--no. No, no, no. I am not a cat person.}}

Interact with the four ghost mugs on the table to hand out the drinks, then turn in. After completion, Nalina gets a {{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}} option:
:{{text|say|Nalina Ironsong|It's rare I see a new face in the Empire's Edge. Pull up a stool, friend.}}
:{{text|say|Nalina Ironsong|You and the other outsiders have been conscripted by Lamplighter Faerin I see.}}
:{{text|say|Nalina Ironsong|When you're lost in the dark, one Lamplighter is a blessing of the Flame. If you see more than one...}}
:{{text|say|Nalina Ironsong|Well, then you know the darkness has brought trouble to your door.}}
:{{text|say|Nalina Ironsong|It's good that Faerin has found compatriots willing to dive into the pits of evil she frequents.}}
:{{text|say|Nalina Ironsong|Seriously though, watch yourself. Danger finds young lady Faerin Lothar more than anyone else in Hallowfall.}}
:{{text|say|Nalina Ironsong|It's only by the blessing of the Flame that she still draws breath-- the trouble she gets into.}}
:{{text|say|Mylton Fyreswyd|Need a refill.}}
:{{text|say|Nalina Ironsong|Be right there, Mylton!}}
:{{text|say|Nalina Ironsong|Mylton was caught out on the coast when Beledar shifted. He would have been a meal for the kobyss if Faerin hadn't been on patrol.}}
:{{text|say|Nalina Ironsong|He lost part of himself to the darkness. Never been the same since. Doesn't leave the city, barely leaves my tavern.}}
:{{text|say|Nalina Ironsong|Everyone has a story like that. I remember this one time I found this cave with--}}
:{{text|say|Nalina Ironsong|What I'm saying is that Faerin has been able to endure the adversity of this land better than most.}}
:{{text|say|Nalina Ironsong|But we all have limits.}}
:{{text|say|Nalina Ironsong|I'm glad you're here, outsider. Keep an eye on her.}}
