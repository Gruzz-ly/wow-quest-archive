==Objectives==
Kill 12 Nerubian attackers.
* [[Nerubian]] attackers slain (12)

==Description==
<Name>, if we don't stem the tide of nerubians climbing up to us, nothing else will matter.

Their numbers are just too great.

We need to delay their onslaught to buy the people of [[Hallowfall]] time to prepare. The wall still serves as a very effective chokepoint.

Do what you can to thin their numbers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Name>, every nerubian you kill here could mean a life saved in Hallowfall, and aids the chances of our own success.

==Completion==
This is a good start. There are still many more nerubians coming from below, but we must turn our attention to those already inside Hallowfall.

==Notes==
Kill [[Dreadstrike Priest]]s, [[Dreadstrike Subjugator]]s, [[Dreadstrike Flitterer]]s, and [[Direweb Marauder]]s.

==Progression==
{{The Guiding Star}}
