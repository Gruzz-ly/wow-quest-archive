==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Siegelord Xerosh.jpg|Siegelord Xerosh|Xerosh has been responsible for countless Arathi deaths over years.}}
Defeat Siegelord Xerosh.
* [[Siegelord Xerosh]] slain

==Description==
<Name>, the [[nerubian]]s all seem to be taking orders from that siegelord south of here. If we can defeat her, that may turn the tide of this attack.

Without a leader organizing the attack, the [[Arathi]] may be able to drive back the nerubians, especially if [[Faerin]] is able to light this [[dawntower]] she spoke of.

But the longer we delay, the greater damage to the Arathi airships. Go quickly!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to defeat the siegelord?

==Completion==
With the nerubian leader defeated, we should be able to leave the defenses to the Arathi.

You've saved many lives today, <name>.

==Notes==
Upon approaching Xerosh's location, [[Alleria Windrunner]] appears to accompany the player:
:{{Abilities|Windrunner's Protection|Accompanied by Alleria Windrunner.|icon=artifactability_marksmanhunter_legacyofthewindrunners}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Good to see you, champion. I've been tracking this one since it crawled up out of its hole.}}

Aggro her:
:{{text|say|Siegelord Xerosh|We shall break the Arathi here!}}

During the battle, the player gets prompted to have Alleria help them with an extra action button:
:{{Text|bossemote|[[File:Spell priest mindspike.png|18px]] Alleria Windrunner has reached full power and is prepared to shoot her {{Text|red|[Voidrending Shot]}}!}}
:{{Abilities|Alleria's Aid|id=457545|Instruct Alleria to attack her target with Voidrending Shot!|icon=ability_hunter_markedfordeath}}

[[File:Zero Out Xerosh - end.jpg|thumb|Anduin and Alleria.]]
Defeat her:
:{{text|say|Siegelord Xerosh|Destroy everything!}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I look at these Arathi and see [[Arator the Redeemer|my son]]. I will slaughter every nerubian in my path to keep them from harm.}}

Turn in to Anduin, who has moved from the Dawnbreaker to a nearby shed. On approach, Alleria automatically leaves the player's side to stand next to Anduin.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I thought [[Recompense (quest)|we agreed]] you'd stay in [[Dornogal]].}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I heard stories of the Arathi. As king--I mean, I was curious.}}
