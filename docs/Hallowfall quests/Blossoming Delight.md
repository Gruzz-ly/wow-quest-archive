==Objectives==
Collect 20 Ever-Blossoming Fungi from [[Mycomancer Cavern|Mycromancer Cavern]]{{Sic}}.
*[[Ever-Blossoming Fungi]] (20)

==Description==
Few followers of the [[light]] would dare to attempt the dish I plan to make. A mix of traditional Imperial spices combined with the forbidden harvest of the nearby fungal blooms.

This dish will delight the palate and remind one of the adventurous spirit that founded the [[Hallowfall Arathi|Hallowfall expedition]].

Please journey to the [[Mycomancer Cavern]] nearby and harvest the blooms I require.

* {{cost|23|40}}
