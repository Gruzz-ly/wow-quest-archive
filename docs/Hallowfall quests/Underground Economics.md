Thank you, once again. You have done us a great service.

==Notes==
Before getting started, all gathered have gossip:

{{dialogue|title=Auralia Steelstrike|We need this to go well.

We're running critically low on many supplies.}}

{{dialogue|title=General Steelstrike|Diplomacy is not my strong suit.

Give me a sword, and I'll lead you until I die. But words...

<Vaelisia shakes herself.>

My people need this. I need to succeed.}}

{{dialogue|title=Merrix|This is my first time down here. The Edicts forbade us from venturing this far, only the [[unbound]] dared venture here{{sic|missing dot.}}

It is a lot more green than I was expecting.}}

Pick up an item:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|<name>, can you put the trade goods on display?}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Merrix, we sent emissaries. None returned. Had we offended you?}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|Vaelisia, I'm sorry. We never received those emissaries.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|After the world shook, we never heard from your people again. We assumed the worst.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Well, I'm glad you're alive. It's good to see you again, Merrix.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|And you, members of the outlander realms. Welcome to Hallowfall.}}
:{{text|say|Auralia Steelstrike|Here are examples of items we can trade. I have itemized lists as well.}}
If Alliance:
:{{text|say|Andee Seabraid|Ye have <name> helping. Wise. They've a reputation of solving anything they put their mind to.}}
If Horde:
:{{text|say|Teha|<Name> be helping ya'. Smart. They've a reputation of solving tha' greatest of problems.}}

Speak with Andee Seabraid:
{{dialogue|Fancy place they got here.

Does the crystal ever go out? I can't imagine it's easy to sleep with that thing on.

{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Alliance)}} I vouch for the Arathi. We should open trade with them.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
{{text|say|Andee Seabraid|Heh, if <name> vouches for ye, thats good enough for me. Let's trade!}}
}}
{{gossip|quest=|What would it take to convince you to open trade with the Arathi?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
The weapons look great, but we have more swords than ye could shake a stick at. New spices are always good I suppose?

It doesn't seem like they have much large-scale resources to trade, though. Not at the level we usually trade at. Seems risky for us.

{{gossip|They are struggling to survive. With extra resources they can thrive. You'll get favorable rates when that happens.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
{{text|say|Andee Seabraid|Aye... That's a fair point ye have there. Okay. T and W Trading Post would like to make a formal offer of trade with the Arathi.}}
}}
{{gossip|Don't play coy with me. You are on an island with limited trade options.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
{{text|say|Andee Seabraid|Ach, calm yer Grizzlies. Okay, okay. T and W Trading Post would like to make a formal offer of trade with the Arathi.}}}}
}}}}

Speak with Teha:
{{dialogue|Who woulda thought that it was so airy down here?

Ma folks back home will never believe me. Clouds! Underground!

{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Horde)}} I vouch for the Arathi. We should open trade with them.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
{{text|say|Teha|Any friend of <name> be a friend of mine. Let's trade!}}
}}
{{gossip|quest=|What would it take to convince you to open trade with the Arathi?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
New spices be good, but we're already swimming in spices from Pandaria as it is. The weapons are good quality, but so are the ones we make.

Doesn't seem like they have much to offer. I'm worried they won't be able to offer trade in the numbers we need, ya?

{{gossip|They are struggling to survive. With extra resources they can thrive. You'll get favorable rates when that happens.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
{{text|say|Teha|Hmm, I do like favorable rates... Zen'shiri Trading Post would like to open trade with the Arathi!}}
}}
{{gossip|Don't play coy with me. You are on an island with limited trade options.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
{{text|say|Teha|Pah, ya could learn a thing or two from Torga, mon. Fine, fine. Zin'shiri would like to open trade with the Arathi people.}}}}
}}}}

After getting both [[Trading Post]] representatives to sign on:
:{{text|say|Merrix|We've traded before, Vaelisia. I'd like to do so again.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Thank you. Do you have any idea why our emissaries wouldn't have made it through to you?}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|The Ringing Deeps were dangerous up until recently. We have <name> to thank for solving that.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Seems I have a lot to thank <name> for.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Do you have time? I'd like to catch up. It's been so many years.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|Of course. A lot has happened. Let me fill you in...}}

==Beta==
;Description
After the [[Day of Darkness]], we sent people to the Earthen to try to reestablish contact. None of them made it back.

We couldn't afford to go looking for them, not while we were under constant attack, so in the end, we stopped trying. 

We used to be on good terms, I'd even have considered [[Merrix]] a friend, albeit an odd one. 

We need this to go well. Any help you can provide would be appreciated.

;Completion
<Vaelisia looks like she has run a marathon, sweat is visibly dripping down her brow.>

Flames preserve me. that went better than I had hoped.

Thank you, once again. You have done us a great service.
