==Objectives==
Recover 6 [[Arathi]] [[tinderbox]]es from fallen soldiers and burn their bodies.
* [[Arathi Tinderbox|Tinderboxes]] recovered (6)

==Description==
Good people died here today, <name>--a lot of them.

Every Arathi soldier carries a [[tinderbox]]. It represents their devotion to the [[Sacred Flame]]. Many use it as a focus to bring forth the Flame's light. In the dark places beyond the light of [[Beledar]], the Sacred Flame brings hope.

With the [[nerubian]] attack, we can't recover their bodies. So we must retrieve these symbols, to venerate their sacrifice. Then use this torch to burn their bodies. It's the best funeral we can offer.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Lamplighter's Handwraps]]
* [[Lamplighter's Epaulets]]
* [[Lamplighter's Cinch]]
* [[Lamplighter's Sabatons]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered their tinderboxes? Every life deserves to be remembered in the Sacred Flame.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. You've helped to honor their sacrifice as well as we can.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Faerin|We Arathi are consecrated in the Sacred Flame. Do not leave my people on the field.}}

[[Fallen Defender (Hallowfall)|Fallen Defenders]] light up on the minimap. Interact with them to torch their body (the cast bar says "Returning to the Flame") and simultaneously loot their [[Arathi Tinderbox]].

On complete:
:{{text|say|Faerin|These were true Arathi, holding onto hope in the very heart of shadow.}}
:{{text|say|Great Kyron|They seek the light of the Sacred Flame now. Come, their killers still live.}}
