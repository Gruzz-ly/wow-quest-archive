==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Edwyn Wyndsmithe.png|Edwyn Wyndsmithe|Edwyn has Sophietta's final assignment.}}
Confront Edwyn about the notebook.
* Confront [[Edwyn Wyndsmithe|Edwyn]] about the notebook

==Description==
I'm so tired of Edwyn. From the day we all arrived, he's been telling everyone he'll be selected as [[Captain (rank)|captain]].

He's a great flyer--very talented, and he knows his stuff. But his ego gets in the way of treating people as he should. And he knows my grades and flight review scores are higher.

But if I can't turn in my report, he'll be the next captain. Take it back from him!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you get it back? I'd love to see the look on Edwyn's face...

==Completion==
He threw it into the valley and the WIND TOOK IT?!

==Notes==
Go to Edwyn who can be found alongside [[Faerley]] and [[Caerin]]:

Who are you, and what do you want?

{{gossip|Why are you down here?}}

{{dialogue-child|
We're studying. We've got a big test coming up on how wind affects objects in flight.

{{gossip|Why did you take the notebook?}}

{{dialogue-child|
It's not personal. Sophietta's a great student. But I'm the best candidate to be airship captain. No one will fly as well, or keep their crew as safe.

For some reason, she's managed to get ahead of me in the ratings. But I know I'm the only one who has what it takes in this class. So I'm doing what it takes to make sure I get the spot.

For the good of everyone.
