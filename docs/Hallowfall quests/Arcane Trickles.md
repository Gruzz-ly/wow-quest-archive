'''Arcane Trickles''' begins an optional chapter of the [[Hallowfall storyline]], The Last Mage of Hallowfall. [[Wenren Althal]] starts this quest at [[Beledar's Bounty]] with no prerequisites, though [[General Steelstrike]] in the church at [[Mereldar]] will breadcrumb players here.

==Objectives==
Obtain 5 Arcane Suffused Organs from [[Strange Shore Crawler|Shore Crawlers]] near [[Mereldar]].
*[[Arcane Suffused Organ]] (5)

==Description==
I've almost got it!

I'm making a new kind of [[teleportation]] spell to get us back home to the Empire.

These [[crab]]s might just the key. They're practically radiating [[arcane]] teleportation [[magic]]!

I need more samples to study.

Take this focus, it will let you see traces of the arcane. There's not much other arcane sources around here, so any you see should lead you straight to the affected crabs!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found the crabs? They'll be near water. That focus should let you see the trails of arcane dust they leave behind.

==Completion==
Yes, these are perfect!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Wenren Althal|If my theory works, we can go home. We can get supplies and reinforcements! Teff can see his wife again! Do you think my cat remembers me?}}

Northwest past [[Mereldar]] to the north of the [[Veneration Grounds]] to find [[Strange Shore Crawler]]s [[Blink]]ing about near water level.

On return:
:{{text|say|Tefferty Ulreth|Here's the last of Ol' Gail's flowers. Are ya sure this will work, Wenren? Its all she had left of home.}}
:{{text|say|Wenren Althal|Thanks, Teff. I know. I'm sorry. Tell her I'm sorry. I will make this work.}}

==Progression==
{{The Last Mage of Hallowfall}}
