==Objectives==
Find the pinned-down haranir and examine Strange Flowers.
*Strange Flower examined (6)
*Haranir evacuated. (3)

==Description==
I don't know what prompted you to come here, but we could use your help.

We came to investigate signs of the [[Black Blood]] in this area, but the creatures overwhelmed us. Several of us are still out in the field.

You are hale and hearty. Go find my people so they can return.

And, if you have the strength, take a closer look at the strange flowers that grow from the blood that seeps beneath the ground. They may hold a clue as to how we can fight against its corruption.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}

==Progress==
Have you found my people?

==Completion==
<Orweyna counts the number of haranir silently-- to reassure herself. Then she nods.>

That's all of us. And I'm grateful.

Those flowers you found are also odd. They seem to have corrupted properties and have become something new. I have to dig into this more.

We can't stop now. Not when we're so close. This could be the key to how we fight back.
