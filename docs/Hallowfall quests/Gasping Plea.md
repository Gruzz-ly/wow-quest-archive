'''Gasping Plea''' is started by a looted [[Gasping Fish]] on the corpse of any [[kobyss]] invader on the [[Sunless Strand]] while players are in the area for [[Tricks of the Dark]], [[Fickle Fiendish Fish]], or [[Targeted Recon]]. This begins the optional Crushing Depths chapter of the [[Hallowfall storyline]].

This questline's ultimate reward is the [[Fathom Incher]] pet and +500 reputation with the [[Hallowfall Arathi]].

==Objectives==
Put the strange fish in safe waters near the [[kobyss]] camp at [[Sunless Strand]].
*Drop the fish into the water near [[Sunless Strand]]
*[[Gasping Fish]] (provided)

==Description==
<A gasping, pathetic-looking fish taken from the corpse of a kobyss flops weakly in your hand. Its beady eye twitches, and you suddenly hear a breathless voice in the recesses of your mind.>

The water. Take me to the water. Away from these kobyss wretches. Away from the sky.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*2,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The fish gulps down saltwater to regain its breath and then turns to look at you with intelligent eyes.>

I live, thanks to you. The shade of these rocks suits me nicely for the work to be done.

Allow me to repay your selfless gesture.

==Notes==
Head to the marked spot and use the extra action button while near the ghost fish:
:{{abilities|Put Me in the Water|Drop the fish in the water.}}

On complete, the Peculiar Fish has gossip:
{{dialogue|<A sharp intelligence in the fish's eyes betrays the idea that it is in any way ordinary.>}}
