==Completion==
Ah, this is cute. Couldn't tell you where it came from - it appears to be made by a hobbyist rather than an artisan. I'll put it up on display though.

==Notes==
On complete:
:{{text|say|Barahl Lynflayme|This figure depicts the Ballad of Flame Claw. A storied war lynx that braved a burning ship to save its rider.}}
:{{text|say|Barahl Lynflayme|It's said that when he ran through the debris, it was as if the Flames were blessing him, leading him to his goal.}}
:{{text|say|Barahl Lynflayme|Recently scholars have found some old soldiers logs that suggest Flame Claw may have actually been given the name 'Beans'. Heh. I guess nothing has changed about how we Arathi treat our cats.}}
