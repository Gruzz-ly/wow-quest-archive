'''The Last Mage''' begins an optional chapter of the [[Hallowfall storyline]], The Last Mage of Hallowfall. [[General Steelstrike]] starts this quest in the church of [[Mereldar]] with no prerequisites.

==Objectives==
Find [[Wenren Althal]] in [[Beledar's Bounty]].

==Description==
I want you to check in on someone. He's a [[mage]]... the only one of us who is. All the others died in the crash.

He's trying to make a portal to [[Arathi Empire|the Empire]], so we can get reinforcements and have a way to and from home.

We all know it's a lost cause, but he still hasn't given up.

Maybe meeting a seasoned traveler like you will give him the reality check he needs. Check on him, will you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What? Who sent you?

It doesn't matter, listen! I'm so close to a breakthrough I can taste it!

==Notes==
Head southeast to [[Beledar's Bounty]] to find [[Wenren Althal]] attempting to teleport [[Shore Crawler]]s around:
:{{text|say|Wenren Althal|They actually teleported?! Finally, a breakthrough!}}

Wenren has gossip:
{{dialogue|
Our people are dying. There's no question we need supplies and reinforcements... desperately.

If I don't open us a portal home... who will?

If only I had learned before we left home.

{{gossip|<Ask about other mages in the [[Hallowfall Arathi]].>}}

Sadly, I'm the only mage left of the Hallowfall Expedition. Some conjurers of the Priory toy with the arcane, but none truly wield it.

I was a mere apprentice when we set out, over a decade ago. My masters were core to the mission. They were to set up portals back home whenever we arrived at our destination. That way, we'd have a steady flow of supplies and reinforcements.

It was a stroke of darkest luck that every single one died in the crash.

<Wernen lets out a long, mournful sigh.>

And I never learned how to make a portal home while I had the chance.

{{gossip|<Ask why he can't make a portal right now.>}}

To tell the truth... I've never been any good at teleportation magic.

But even if I was a genius, teleportation is complicated. Most often, you have to be at the location in order to learn how to make a portal there. Sometimes, a skilled enough master can teach you how to create a portal to somewhere they know, even if you do not.

I wasn't able to master the spell before we left the Empire. We didn't think that would matter, given how many other master mages came with us.

Who could have expected all the others would be lost?

{{gossip|<Ask about his research into teleportation magic.}}

Nobody else thinks it will work. To be honest, I'm scared to get my hopes up, myself.

But, if it does work... think of the possibilities! The reinforcements, the supplies!

People can see their families again.

I have a theory. Every living being holds within themselves a memory of where they were born.

If I can tap into that information, perhaps I can combine that with more traditional teleportation to teleport people home.

I just haven't had the right hook into proper teleportation magic, until these crabs appeared!

{{gossip|<Ask about the origin of the crabs.>}}

Strange, isn't it? What could be causing this sudden arcane energy? It only started recently.

Something in the water, perhaps? Something these particular crabs are particularly sensitive to?

But why now?

<Wenren shrugs.>

Magic works in mysterious ways.

{{gossip|<Tell Wenren about the crash of [[Dalaran]].>}}

What?!

So that's what that quake was? A massive, arcane-infused city crashing into [[Isle of Dorn|the island above]]?!

<Wenren ponders this.>

Yes, if... if some magic residue got into the water, then trickled down here from above... that could certainly be what's affecting the crabs.

Fascinating!}}
