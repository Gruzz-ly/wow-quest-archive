==Objectives==
Take the care package to [[Sophietta Lynflayme]] at [[Lightspark Sky Academy]].
*[[Valrin's Sweetrolls]] (provided)

==Description==
My cousin Sophietta and I came to [[Hallowfall]] together as stalwarts. Since arriving, we both lived here in [[Dunelle's Kindness]] for years. But she left last year to follow her dream of being one of our [[airship]] [[Captain (rank)|captains]], or at least joining an airship crew.

She's a strong person, but I don't know how she's doing. Especially without [[Valrin Paller|Innkeeper Valrin]]'s sweetrolls! She can't get them at Lightspark, the Sky Academy. Will you take these to her, and make sure she's doing alright?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*1,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What's this? Are these for me?

==Completion==
That was very kind of Barahl to send these. You can tell him I'm doing well, but first, do you think you could help me with something?

==Notes==
Upon approach:
:{{text|say|Barahl Lynflayme|Hey, would you be willing to help me with something? I need to stay here to watch the cats.}}

==Progression==
{{The Sky's the Limit}}
