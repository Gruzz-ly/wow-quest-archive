==Objectives==
Restore the [[Veneration Grounds]] in [[Hallowfall]].
* Veneration Grounds cleared (0/100%)

==Description==
Our Veneration Grounds have been desecrated. Its beauty marred.

It's going to take a bigger effort, but I would appreciate anything you can do to cleanup our grounds.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|70|20}}
*17,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I wish you could have seen this place before the [[Kobyss]] arrived.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. It may not have seemed like much, but this is one of our most sacred places.

We remember our dead here. We... have a lot to remember.

==Notes==
Fill up the bar to 100% by interacting with toppled [[Memorial Plant]]s to right them and [[Kobyss Spear]]s to remove them around the grounds.

On completion of both:
:''[[Regald Hornfyre]] runs up.''
