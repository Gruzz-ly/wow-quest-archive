==Objectives==
Harvest 6 taro with the chef. Properly, this time.
* Taro harvested properly
* [[Pristine Taro]] (6)

==Description==
Alright, I'll come with you. Show you how to do this properly. If I'm up, we might as well stock up on taro. Can't rely on adventurers to do delicate work, I suppose.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is that all of them?

==Completion==
Much better. This will last for a while. If you want to eat, though, I'll need a little more help.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Dolena|I'll show you how to do it properly.}}
:{{text|say|Dolena|Taro is usually pretty hardy, but this stuff is delicate.}}
:{{text|say|Dolena|Need to be gentle if you don't want to mangle it.}}

Dolena follows you, when speaking to her she says:
{{Dialogue|Well? You staying or going?}}

Find a [[Cave Taro]] plant and grab it:
:{{text|say|Dolena|Okay, gently now. Grab as close to the root as you can. Then pull back slowly.}}

Pull it gently:
:{{text|say|Dolena|There you go! Now go harvest some more. I need to prep the greens.}}

==Progression==
