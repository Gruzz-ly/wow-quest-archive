==Objectives==
Recover 10 pages from [[Sophietta Lynflayme|Sophietta]]'s report.
* [[Stained and Tattered Page]] (10)

==Description==
I can't believe [[Edwyn Wyndsmithe|Edwyn]] threw my report out into the wind.

Can you please track down what papers you can find? I'll look for any around the school grounds, you check the valley.

This report is already late... But I had some really good insights around [[airship]] capabilities. When [[Headmaster Fynch]] sees them, maybe he'll still allow me to turn it in.

Bring me whatever pages you find!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hope you found all the pages, <name>!

==Completion==
I really wish this looked better. I'm honestly ashamed to turn it in, if Headmaster Fynch will even let me. 

But we have to try--the ideas are what matters, and they're still true!

==Notes==
Collect [[Stained and Tattered Page]] from the ground or from slaying [[Learned Mongrel]]s.

{{The Sky's the Limit}}
