==Objectives==
Gather 5 Shattered Remnants and use them to empower the Aegis Keyflame.
* [[Shattered Remnants]] collected from Nerubians (5)
* [[Aegis Keyflame]] empowered by Shattered Remnants (5){{Co|70.09|61.13|Hallowfall}}
*Meet Faerin atop the Aegis Wall.

==Description==
One [[dawntower]] has fallen, but a faint glimmer of hope remains with the smaller [[keyflame]] atop the wall.

The shattered remnants needed to sustain that light were taken by the nerubians.

Gather the remnants from [[nerubian]]s you slay, and help ignite a beacon of hope!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
An empowered keyflame will be a great help.

==Completion==
With the light of the flame I see hope that we will drive the nerubians back!

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Faerin|The dawntower won't be enough to hold them back. The nerubians have gotten braver.}}
:{{text|say|Great Kyron|We must ignite the keyflame on the wall. Its Sacred Flame will keep the nerubians at bay.}}
:''Faerin, Great Kyron, and Anduin walk off.''

Defeat [[Dreadstrike Ambusher]]s and [[Dreadstrike Subjugator]]s for their [[Shattered Remnants]]. After doing enough for both quests, head up on the wall where Faerin, Anduin, Kyron, and two [[Injured Defender (Hallowfall)|Injured Defenders]] are gathered around the [[Aegis Keyflame]]. Interact with the keyflame five times to toss the remnants at it and ignite it.
:{{text|say|Injured Defender (1)|The light brings hope.}}
:{{text|say|Injured Defender (2)|There is hope in the flame!}}
:''The Injured Defenders run back toward the battle and despawn.''

==Progression==
