==Objectives==
Help [[Aemyra Acton|Aemyra]] choose the right words for her message to [[Orren Masyn|Orren]].
* Put Aemyra's sentiments on paper

==Description==
I had told Orren I'd be back by now, but [[Velhan's Claim]] has larger problems than I expected. The people here need my help against the [[kobyss]].

<Name>, I've always been better with a sword than a pen. Strong feelings and being far apart makes it even harder.

I'm more at home protecting the vulnerable than being vulnerable.

Perhaps I could tell you what I want to get across and you could write it for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|17|55}}
* 8,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find Aemyra? Is she alright?

==Completion==
I'm really glad to hear she's okay! But I have a huge problem now.

==Notes==
Upon accept, talk to Aemyra to start writing the letter, she and Taenar comment on some of the choices made:
{{dialogue|
<Name>, will you help me find the right words for my message to Orren?

{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready.}}


{{dialogue-child|
First off, we should make sure Orren knows I'm okay, just delayed by the kobyss.

{{gossip|Thanks for checking on me, sweetie! I'm alright, just dealing with some nasty kobyss.}}
:{{text|say|[[Taenar Strongoth]]|I'd fight nerubians over the kobyss any day.}}
{{gossip|Hey, Orren, I'm okay, just dealing with some kobyss.}}
:{{text|say|Aemyra Acton|Nice and understated.}}
{{gossip|Nice of you to send <name> to check on me, Orren, but you know I'm okay! A few kobyss won't be a problem.}}
:{{text|say|Aemyra Acton|Orren doesn't need to know just how many kobyss there are here! No need to make him worry.}}
{{gossip|I hope you're not worried, Orren! I'd planned to be back to the farm already, but there are a lot of kobyss at Velhan's Claim.}}
:{{text|say|Taenar Strongoth|I'm disappointed to see Velhan hasn't dealt with them. Not surprised, though.}}
}}


{{dialogue|
Now let's thank him for sending those lovely flowers.

{{gossip|I love the flowers you sent! It's great to have a reminder that you're thinking of me.}}
:{{text|say|Aemyra Acton|Orren is always doing thoughtful things like that.}}
{{gossip|Thanks for those nice flowers.}}
:{{text|say|Taenar Strongoth|I've always liked Amber Bloom, if I'm honest.}}
{{gossip|I was surprised to see you only sent me twelve flowers! Kidding, they're lovely.}}
:{{text|say|Aemyra Acton|I appreciate how Orren makes me feel special. But it's fun to give him a hard time.}}
{{gossip|You shouldn't have troubled yourself to send me flowers. That was very sweet, though!}}
:{{text|say|Aemyra Acton|I can't exactly put these in a vase somewhere, but the thought really means a lot.}}
}}


{{dialogue-child|
It's going to be a while before I'm done here and get back to see Orren again. How should I tell him?

{{gossip|I miss you, Orr, and I'm afraid I'm going to keep missing you for a while as I make Velhan's Claim safe for people.}}

{{gossip|My work at Velhan's Claim will take me a while.}}

{{gossip|As thrilling as it is to hang around the farm, I'm afraid I'm going to be here fighting the kobyss for a while.}}

{{gossip|I'm afraid it's going to take quite a while to set things in order at Velhan's Claim. But I'll see you again when I'm done here.}}
}}


{{dialogue-child|
I want to let Orren know I believe in his work to feed our people with that machine.

{{gossip|The work you're doing with ELIZA is brilliant. Soon you'll have her caring for the fields, and we'll have more time together.}}

{{gossip|You're going to get ELIZA working eventually.}}

{{gossip|Don't get any ideas about replacing me with that robot! But you're doing great work on it.}}

{{gossip|Please be careful with your work on ELIZA. That seems like it could backfire, but I know you'll figure it out.}}
}}


{{dialogue-child|
I need to make sure Orren knows how I feel about him.

{{gossip|I'm truly grateful for all the good you bring to my life, Orren.}}

{{gossip|I like you and look forward to seeing you.}}

{{gossip|I want you to know, I love you every bit as much as I hate the kobyss!}}

{{gossip|If you love me as much as I do you, we have a bright future together!}}
}}


{{dialogue-child|
How should I sign it?

{{gossip|Yours, Aemyra}}

{{gossip|Aemyra}}

{{gossip|Your biggest fan, Aemyra}}

{{gossip|Love you! Aemyra}}
}}

Upon letter completion:
:{{text|say|Taenar Strongoth|Aemyra, Orren's nice, but he's a little strange. What do you see in him?}}
:{{text|say|Aemyra Acton|A lot of things, Taenar! He has a big vision of how to help the people of Hallowfall. I admire that.}}
:{{text|say|Aemyra Acton|He's really persistent, even when things don't come easily. He's been working on ELIZA for a couple years!}}
:{{text|say|Aemyra Acton|And not everyone can deal with a Lamplighter who's always taking risks and helping others. But Orren supports it.}}

Aemyra's gossip after:
{{Dialogue|I'm glad you're here with us, <name>.}}

Taenar's gossip:
{{dialogue|This is a big task, even for a pair of Lamplighters! There are a lot of kobyss surrounding Velhan's Claim.}}

Upon returning to Orren:
:{{text|say|Orren Masyn|This is terrible. How am I going to stop her?}}
