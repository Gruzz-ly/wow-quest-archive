'''Sureki Incursion: Hold the Wall''' is one of three sureki daily quests for the [[Flame's Radiance]]. This quest takes place immediately southwest of [[Mereldar]], where [[Auralia Steelstrike]], part of the Flame's Radiance, is leading the defense.

==Objectives==
Assist the [[Flame's Radiance]] in pushing back the Sureki outside [[Mereldar]].
* Sureki forces repelled

==Description==
Flames! Those chitinous vermin are relentless!

We've received reports from [[Auralia Steelstrike]] that a small force of nerubians are harassing the outer perimeter of the city.
 
Regroup with our allies on the outskirts of Mereldar and join the fight!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Confiscated Cultist's Bag]]
* 55 [[Resonance Crystals]]
* 5 [[Weathered Undermine Crest]]
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Flame's Radiance]] (via [[Flame's Radiance (currency)]])

==Progress==
We must hold the line against these Sureki. Push them back!

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. Our reinforcements will take it from here.

Mylton's reports indicated a much larger force to the west of the [[Veneration Grounds]], so we must remain vigilant and hold these walls. 

Sacred Flame guide your blade.

==Notes==
At the defense line, Aurelia has this to say:
{{dialogue|We meet again, <name>. I was hoping you'd be among those who answered the call from Dornogal.

When the Sureki rekindled their assaults on our borders, the Great Kyron and his Lamplighters mobilized to secure Light's Redoubt and the Aegis Wall.

Neither of us were expecting an assault on Mereldar so soon, so your arrival is most appreciated.

{{gossip|Where is General Steelstrike?}}

<Auralia smiles.> 

Doing what she always does--leaping into the fray.

After Thaed convinced her to declare Flame's Radiance, the General entrusted Mereldar's defenses to me while she organized a regiment to secure our townsteads to the north. 

The Sureki have been spotted in large numbers all around Hallowfall. We cannot allow a single corner of our home to remain undefended.
