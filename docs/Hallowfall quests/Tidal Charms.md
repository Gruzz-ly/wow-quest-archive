==Objectives==
Collect 12 Sunless Shards from the [[kobyss]] at [[Sunless Strand]].
* [[Sunless Shard]] (12)

==Description==
<When the fish speaks, its lips do not move. You hear its voice in your head.>

No doubt you have found that your senses cannot be trusted when dealing with the kobyss. A tremendous power, is it not? It is only fair that you show them the power they wield is not theirs alone.

I will show you how to craft a tool to lure and destroy them. You will find their kind carry shards taken from the deep. Bring them to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Bring the materials. Only then can we continue.

==Completion==
Glinting abyssal shards and strands of coral. Bound with words of power and worn around the neck, I will show you how to trick the senses of your enemies.

==Notes==
Sunless kobyss will drop up to three [[Sunless Shard]] at a time.

==Progression==
{{Crushing Depths}}
