==Objectives==
Kill 15 kobyss attackers in the [[Veneration Grounds]] in [[Hallowfall]].
* [[Kobyss]] Attackers slain (15)

==Description==
We need to take the Veneration Grounds back from the kobyss.

Push them back and pave a bloody path through them.

We need to stop whatever is happening at the [[Eternal Flame]]! If they manage to corrupt it like they did at [[Cliffside Beacon|the tower]]... I don't even want to imagine what will happen.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Flames, they just keep coming.

==Completion==
Now we just need to deal with the shield.

==Notes==

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Arathi! Push back the kobyss. Make them regret ever stepping onto our hallowed lands!}}
:''They charge west.''

Get to killing, then catch up with the gang at the western end of the quest area, near the shadow shield around the Eternal Flame:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Aelric's ritual is the source of this darkness. We need to break through this barrier!}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|He draws strength from the darkness. So do I.}}

==Progression==
{{Gathering Shadows}}
