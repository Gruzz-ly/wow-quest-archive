==Objectives==
Burn 10 [[kobyss]] cages with [[Aemyra Acton|Aemyra]]'s Holy Flame.
*Cages Burned (10)
*[[Torch of Holy Flame (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
When we were scouting before you arrived, we saw a lot of cages set up around [[Velhan's Claim]]. Typically, the kobyss use these to hold their victims until they're needed for a ritual sacrifice.

Those sacrifices lead to... lots of other dark activities. Not the least of which is eating the victims.

Let's get ahead of all that. Take my torch, and destroy the cages, so we don't have to see that happen to anyone from Velhan's Claim.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you dealt with those cages yet? The citizens of Velhan's Claim won't be safe until you do.

==Completion==
Good work, <name>. Without their cages, the kobyss won't be able to take [[prisoner]]s.

No prisoners means no foul rituals, and preventing those gives us a much better chance of saving the people at Velhan's Claim.

==Notes==
Upon accept of both quests:
:{{Text|say|Aemyra Acton|We'll try to fight through to Velhan's Claim, while you soften the kobyss assault.}}  
:{{Text|say|Taenar Strongoth|They'll be relieved to see a pair of Lamplighters--well, they'll be glad to see one of us, at least.}}  
:{{Text|say|Aemyra Acton|What do you mean, Taenar?}}  
:{{Text|say|Taenar Strongoth|I'll explain on the way, Aemyra.}}  

Upon meeting with Taenar and Aemyra again. One can see them talking with [[Duke Velhan]] at the settlement in [[Velhan's Claim]]:
:{{Text|say|Duke Velhan|Taenar... long time. What brings you here to my part of Hallowfall?}}  
:{{Text|say|Taenar Strongoth|Your dawntower is unlit, Velhan. Aemyra and I came to investigate.}}  
:{{Text|say|Aemyra Acton|It's an honor to meet you, Duke Velhan! Taenar has told me about his service with you!}}  
:{{Text|say|Aemyra Acton|And, I've heard the stories, as well.}}  
:{{Text|say|Duke Velhan|Of course. We can deal with the kobyss, but you are welcome to assist if you choose.}}  

==Progression==
