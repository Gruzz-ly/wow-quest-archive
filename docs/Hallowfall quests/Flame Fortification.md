'''Flame Fortification''' introduces players to the [[Nightfall scenario]], which takes place hourly at the top of the hour (at xx:00) at [[Morgaen's Tears]] in southwestern [[Hallowfall]].

==Objectives==
Complete the [[Nightfall scenario]].
* Complete the scenario "Nightfall"

==Description==
[[Sureki]] forces are gathering all over [[Hallowfall]] and [[Azj-Kahet]]--but we're certain they're just distractions. 

We think the main attack will come from the west. When the time comes we'll need all the help we can get to push them back and defend [[Mereldar]]. 

Can Flame's Radiance count on your support?

You will receive:
* 250 [[Resonance Crystals]]
* +200 reputation with [[Flame's Radiance]] (via [[Flame's Radiance (currency)]])

==Progress==
Be ready, the Sureki could attack at any moment!

==Completion==
I knew we could count on you!
