==Objectives==
5 Hillhelm Remnant Supplies gathered and used to empower the [[Hillhelm Keyflame]].
*[[Hillhelm Remnant Supply]] (5)
*Hillhelm Remnants used to empower Keyflame. (5)

==Description==
The keyflame braziers, located across the countryside keep the darkness at bay and our people safe. Many have gone dark as the [[Radiant Remnant]]s needed to maintain them have become harder to find.

We've worked hard to ensure our brazier is always lit, but we could always use your help.

Please gather remnants from our supplies and use them to help empower our family keyflame.

==Progress==
Have you empowered our keyflame?

==Completion==
The warmth of the flame already gives hope that we can retake these lands. Please take a few of these spare remnants to help light the other nearby keyflames.

==Notes==
Upon empowering the keyflame:  
:{{Text|say|[[Anxious Farmer]]|You have restored the flame, thank you!}}  
:{{Text|say|[[Lily Hillhelm]]|The light is back, it's safe to come out now.}}  

Upon completion:  
:{{Text|say|Aliya Hillhelm|Only by relighting the keyflames, can we bring hope back to these lands.}}  

This quest is a criterion of [[Life on the Farm]].
