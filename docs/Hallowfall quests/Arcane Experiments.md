==Description==
This is it! The energy crackling from these crabs is charged with teleportation magic! I just need to extract it and adjust the formula--

I can do this, my new friend! I just need another hand. Help me test this?

You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Wenren's lifeless eyes stare up at you.>

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Wenren Althal|Le?s get started! Please connect the nodes on the spellwork, my new assistant, while I sequence the energy flow.}}

Drag one node to another:
:{{text|say|Wenren Althal|Every living being holds a deep memory of where the were born. I've worked for years to tap into that information.}}

Connect the other nodes:
:{{text|say|Wenren Althal|There! A portal! This should take us to the place this plant sprouted. I marked the location when I first gathered it, so... we just have to see!}}

Take the Portal to Somewhere, which leads to [[Tenir's Ascent]]. There's likely a [[Shadegrumble Bear]] at the landing spot, so fend it off.
:{{text|say|Wenren Althal|Er? Is it safe? You alive through there? Oh, I hope I didn't kill you. Give me a sign?}}

Interact with the Portal to Wenren's Lab to pull Wenren through.
:{{text|say|Wenren Althal|This-- this is it! Yes! This is where I plucked that flower we just tested on!}}
:{{text|say|Wenren Althal|It worked! It actually took us to the flower's home! We-- we have to confirm! I have another plant here. Let's do it again!}}

Wenren opens another Portal to Somewhere. Take it to drop off at [[Rumshackle]], where three [[Wandering Stinger]]s immediately aggro:
:{{text|say|Wenren Althal|All good out there? Any scary monsters around?}}

Fend them off, then interact with the Portal to Somewhere again to pull Wenren through once more:
:{{text|emote|Wenren wipes tears from his eyes.}}
:{{text|say|Wenren Althal|I can't believe it, I've done it! I've actually done it! I can take my people home, my friend! Home!}}
:{{text|say|Wenren Althal|Do you think Larky is still around back home? That's— that's my cat.}}
:{{text|say|Wenren Althal|Meet me back at my lab, <name>. Together, we'll complete the true spell to get us all home to the Empire.}}
:{{text|say|Wenren Althal|Wait, sorry, did I just cast teleport instead of portal--}}
:''Wenren teleports away.''

Return to [[Beledar's Bounty]] and check in on Wenren, but he's lying dead in a pool of blood!
