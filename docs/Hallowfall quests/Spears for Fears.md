==Objectives==
Gather 8 Kobyss Spears for the people of [[Velhan's Claim]].
* [[Kobyss Spear]] (8)

==Description==
It seems [[Duke Velhan|Velhan]] and his followers hoped they could live in peace here. They were so sure they could, in fact, that they didn't bring any weapons with them.

This is a problem, with the [[kobyss]] attacking now, but the kobyss can actually solve it for us. They've brought plenty of spears for their siege on Velhan's Claim, and a spear will skewer a kobyss just as well as a [[human]].

Head out there and gather some spears for the people, <name>, and they won't have to be so afraid.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Kobyss giving you trouble? Soon, the people of Velhan's Claim will be the ones giving them trouble.

==Completion==
Good work, <name>, this is exactly what we need to not just drive the kobyss back today, but to make sure the people of Velhan's Claim can defend themselves in the future.

==Notes==
The spears can be collected from the ground or from killing the kobyss in the area.

==Trivia==
*The title of the quest is likely a reference to the English pop rock group {{Wp|Tears for Fears}}.
