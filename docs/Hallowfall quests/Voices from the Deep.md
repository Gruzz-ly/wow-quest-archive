==Objectives==
Study three ritual sights for insights on the [[kobyss]].
*Raised Shrine studied
*Submerged Shrine studied
*Guarded Shrine studied

==Description==
To deceive the senses of these kobyss is one matter. To know what will captivate them is another. They champ and drool at the thought of devouring your kind. But it is the voices of the deep that transfix them and lower their guard. It's then that you will strike.

Search their shrines to gain an insight for what these wretches hold sacred. See how they have twisted the bellowing truths that lie below.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you learned?

==Completion==
You see now what the kobyss revere. It is time to put that dark knowledge to use.
