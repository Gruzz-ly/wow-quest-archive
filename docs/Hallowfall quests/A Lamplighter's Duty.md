'''A Lamplighter's Duty''' begins the second chapter of the [[Hallowfall storyline]], Gathering Shadows.

==Objectives==
Take the Lamplighter Skiff to [[Lorel's Crossing]].
*[[Lamplighter Skiff|Skiff]] taken to Lorel's Crossing{{Co|53.89|64.08|Hallowfall}}

==Description==
Darkness has fallen. We can't rest yet.

<[[Faerin]] gives you a weary smile, but there is a light in her eyes.>

The light from the tower will hold the worst dangers in the darkness at bay. It's my duty, as a Lamplighter, to keep all the towers blazing.

My patrol takes me to Lorel's Crossing by air next. I would welcome you and [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] at my side, for all our sakes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The kobyss have already been dragging innocent villagers to the shore! They'll drown them and eat them!

We have to save them!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|This darkness... how long does it last?}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|Sometimes only moments, sometimes days. We lost so many the [[Day of Darkness|first time]] it turned.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|We will travel by air. Monsters arise in the darkness.}}
:''They walk over to the Lamplighter Skiff at the nearby dock.''

Interact with it to take an airship ride:
:{{text|say|Anduin|To live under constant threat of shadow... how do you do it?}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|When night falls, [[Arathi Army|the army]] enacts the [[Shadow Curfew]]. Get inside. Get to safety.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|Incoming! Use the lances on those enemies!}}

The skiff grinds to a halt as a swarm of [[Keening Shadows]] appears and starts flying around the vessel. Use the vehicle ability to fend them off:
:{{Abilities|Lance of Light|id=441435|Launch a projectile that deals moderate damage to the first enemy hit.|icon=spell_holy_searinglight}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|Good work. You'd fit in well with us Lamplighters.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|As our numbers dwindle, some find their faith shaken. They turn to the whispers in the darkness.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|Look out, here come more of those fiends!}}

The skiff stops again as more enemies attack. Fend them off, then a [[Vile Behemoth]] appears!
:{{text|say|Faerin|A behemoth! Quickly, take it down!}}

Fend it off!
:{{text|say|Faerin|Thank goodness, that was a small one. Those monsters can take out a [[warship]].}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|We must hold to our faith in the Sacred Flame, ourselves, and in each other if we are to succeed.}}
:{{text|emote|Anduin stares mournfully up at the dark star.}}

The skiff makes it to Lorel's Crossing and everybody alights. A group of [[Arathi Farmer]]s come running. Most run into a nearby house, but one stops in front of Faerin and Anduin:
:{{text|say|Arathi Farmer|Beledar's Shadow! Quickly, get inside!}}
:{{text|say|Arathi Farmer|Faerin! Thank the Flame. Kobyss are raiding Sina's Yearning. The army went ahead, but--}}
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Say no more. Our new allies and I will go to their aid. Seek shelter immediately!}}
:''The Farmer salutes and runs to join the others.''
:{{text|emote|Faerin nods to you and Anduin.}}
:''Faerin and Anduin run out of town.''

Follow them up the road to the northeast to reach [[Sina's Yearning]], where Faerin is arguing with [[General Steelstrike]] in front of a company of [[Arathi Stalwart]]s and [[Arathi Bulwark]]s:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Halt, Faerin. We secure the village, then rescue the captives.}}
:{{text|say|Faerin|They'll be dead by then!}}

Faerin has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|I don't care if Steelstrike thinks I'm reckless. I don't care if I get hurt. I can't let my people die.

We've lost too many already. To nerubians, to kobyss, to the shadows themselves...

There's hardly any of us left. How long until there are none?

{{Gossip|<Ask for more information about the kobyss.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|<Faerin scowls.>

Horrible, violent, and... stinky creatures. They've plagued us since the moment we arrived in Hallowfall.

We've tried to figure out how intelligent they are. Could we parley for peace? But every scholar we've sent to study how to communicate with them has ended up dead. Usually, dead and eaten.

And worse, they seem to wield some kind of necromancy. As if eating us wasn't enough, sometimes they chose{{Sic}} to dishonor the memory of our allies even further by raising them to fight against us. I have no idea how they choose which of us to eat and which of us to raise. Raise the strongest, eat the plumpest?

It churns my stomach to contemplate these things.

{{Gossip|<Ask about something else.>}}

As does Anduin:
{{Dialogue|The shadows are... unsettling.}}
