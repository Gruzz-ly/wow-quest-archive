==Objectives==
Slay Deepsludger, The Abominable Wavecrasher, and Tidelord Teethwretch in [[Sina's Yearning]].
* [[Deepsludger]] slain
* [[The Abominable Wavecrasher]] slain
* [[Tidelord Teethwretch]] slain

==Description==
So you outsiders and [[Faerin]] managed to both survive and save the villagers at [[Sunless Strand|the beach]]?

<Steelstrike breathes a quick prayer in relief.>

We're in trouble, here. The [[kobyss]] brought some of their strongest forces to the doorsteps of villagers.

We have our hands full just holding the line. If you can take out those monsters, we might be able to turn the tide.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
When we first encountered the kobyss, there were those among us who tried to establish peace with them. But it quickly became apparent that they only see us as food.

==Completion==
Every [[Hallowfall Arathi|Arathi]] has killed more kobyss than I care to count. We've also lost more Arathi to kobyss than I want to count.

I don't know what underwater cavern they hail from... but I shudder to think of it.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|So you live! Is Faerin well?}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|The Arathi will fight so long as the light is with us. Destroy those monsters!}}

Pick up the Torch behind her, then work on both quests in parallel. The named targets are marked on the minimap. Fulfill both objectives and return to Steelstrike. Faerin and Anduin have caught up:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|I'm glad you're all right, Faerin. Now stop and take a breath for once.}}

On completion of both, a wave of shadow passes through town:
:{{text|say|Faerin|A wave of shadow! What just happened?}}

==Progression==
{{Hope in Solidarity}}

:Would that we could all brave the darkness as Faerin does.

:We're in trouble, here. The kobyss did not come in numbers, but in strength. They've brought some of their strongest forces to the doorsteps of villagers.
