==Objectives==
Collect 10 Tough Ivy Fiber's
* [[Tough Ivy Fiber]] (10)

==Description==
There is a plant fiber that grows in [[Rumshackle]] and [[Fangs|The Fangs]] that makes for an excellent rope. Because of the hornets, we haven't been able to collect it in a long time, and are running very low in our supplies.

While you are in the area, could you collect some?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The fibers are like magic. The ropes they make are strong, and supple.

==Completion==
Maybe your people would be interested in these fibers?

They make the best rope I have ever seen.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Auralia Steelstrike|The General and I will meet you at Dunelle's Kindness, <name>.}}

[[Shacklefang Leafnose]] bats, [[Shacklefang Hornet]]s, and [[Tough Ivy]] are all on the top layer of the [[Fangs]] and [[Rumshackle]].

After finishing all three quests, head to [[Dunelle's Kindness]], where [[Auralia Steelstrike]], [[General Steelstrike]], [[Teha]], [[Merrix]], and [[Andee Seabraid]] have gathered:
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|Merrix.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|Vaelisia.}}
:{{text|say|General Steelstrike|We thought your people were dead.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|Same. Good to see that you aren't.}}

==Progression==
{{Striking Steel}}
