'''Priory of the Sacred Flame: A Brother's Grief''' concludes the The Priory optional chapter of the [[Hallowfall storyline]]. [[General Steelstrike]] in [[Mereldar]] starts the quest chain with no further prerequisites.

==Objectives==
Confront Prioress Haelsey Murrpray inside the [[Priory of the Sacred Flame]].
* Speak with [[General Steelstrike]] in [[Mereldar]]
* Defeat [[Baron Braunpyke]]
* Defeat Prioress Murrpray

==Description==
I fear that the Prioress may be behind our missing dead-- and our missing baron. Sybaestan has disappeared as well and I don't believe in coincidences. 

She and Sybaestan have taken our recent losses hard. I fear what their overwhelming grief might be doing to their souls. We must confront them and bring them back to sanity... If we can.

Tell General Steelstrike what you have learned. We might need her backup. I'll be waiting for you here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|93|60}}
*22,350 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must confront the prioress.

==Completion==
I wish it could have happened some other way... but at last they are all at peace.

==Notes==
On accept:
