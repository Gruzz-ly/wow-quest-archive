==Objectives==
Find [[Shinda Creedpike]] at [[Mereldar]] in [[Hallowfall]].
* Talk to Shinda Creedpike

==Description==
A moment, if you have one.

One of my [[lieutenant]]s, Shinda Creedpike, did not report in at first bonfire. That may not seem like a large issue to you, but the [[Arathi]] in Hallowfall survive only because we follow orders and stand for our brethren.

I am not cruel. I do not want to punish a man for his weakness in this terrible environment. Can you find him and bring him back?

Take all the time you need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Dawnsurge must have sent you.

It seems like my respite is over.

==Completion==
You're speaking my language, <name>. Plans give me structure and a goal to achieve.

Let me think about the optimal way to relax.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Endiri Dawnsurge|I see glimpses of the warning signs in Shinda, when I have time to pay attention. There is a listlessness in the eyes. Snippiness. He is fragile, now.}}
:{{text|say|Endiri Dawnsurge|Even the best of us would falter under these circumstances. And they have.}}

Speak with Shinda who can be found at the [[Church of the Scared Flame]]:
{{dialogue|May Beledar give us all succor.

...Light knows I need it.

{{gossip|quest=|Are you Shinda Creedpike?}}

{{dialogue-child|Yes. I am Shinda, lieutenant of the Arathi army and devoted son of the sacred flame.

I imagine Dawnsurge asked you to find me.

{{gossip|quest=|Why didn't you show up to your shift?}}

{{dialogue-child|I can't remember the last time I felt at peace. For that matter, I can't remember the last time I slept a full night.

Dawnsurge gave us all a day of relaxation yesterday, and I couldn't think of a reason to do anything. Why should I, when the burden remains just as heavy for the next day?

It has been years, <name>.

...I do not know how much longer I can stand this.

{{gossip|quest=|I'm sorry.}}
{{dialogue-child|Thank you.

<Shinda smiles, though the expression doesn't reach his eyes.>

I wish I knew how to get past this to be a good soldier again.

{{Gossip|quest=|Be kind to yourself. Allow yourself time.}}
{{dialogue-child|Perhaps you are right, <name>.

Thank you.}}

{{Gossip|quest=|Think of the Light.}}
{{dialogue-child|Thank you for your concern, <name>. Perhaps I could lean on you to find a way through this difficult time.}}

{{Gossip|quest=|And you call yourself a paladin, with all this whining.}}
{{dialogue-child|Noted.}}
}}

{{gossip|quest=|I sympathize. I've endured difficult times over the years.}}
{{dialogue-child|You understand.

How did you survive those times?}} 

:(same as above)

{{gossip|quest=|Think of your friends. They're worried about you.}}
{{dialogue-child|I've noticed them worrying.

I know I'm letting them down by not getting better.}}

:(same as above)

{{gossip|quest=|Stand up and fight. You call yourself a soldier?}}
{{dialogue|Everyone has a breaking point, <name>. I pray you do not ever reach yours.}} 
}}
}}

{{gossip|(Skip Conversation) I don't have time for this.}} (at any point in the conversation you can pick this option)
}}

After the conversation, Shinda's gossip changes to:
{{dialogue|Hmph.}}
