==Objectives==
Deliver The Lost Shoe to [[Aliya Hillhelm]] at [[Hillhelm Stead]].
*[[A Lost Shoe]] (provided)

==Description==
<A shoe in the style worn by members of the [[Hillhelm]] family. Maybe Aliya Hillhelm can shed some light on it.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Addysen and I used to tiptoe barefoot through those caves. With light steps, the slumbering fungus would not awake. It wasn't foolproof, and we did lose a lot of shoes escaping from angry Lashrooms.

This shoe, however, seems to have once belonged to Gerta?
