==Objectives==
Slay three Kobyss Shadeshapers in [[Sunless Strand]].
* [[Kobyss Shadeshaper]] slain (3)

==Description==
If you've spent much time in [[Hallowfall]], no doubt by now you've run across the foul [[magic]] of the [[kobyss]]. Reports that their illusions have been evolving are fiercely debated within the [[Arathi Army]].

Your outside perspective is just what I'm looking for. Venture to the Sunless Strand, slay a few of their illusory [[assassin]]s, and then report your findings. You'll likely find them hiding in the shadows.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have your report on the kobyss?

==Completion==
Their illusory projections of Arathi civilians sound convincing as ever. I struggle to understand how such vicious and undiplomatic creatures can emulate Arathi mannerisms so well.

Nonetheless, this is all in line with our current understanding of the kobyss. Your report shall be put to good use. Thank you, outsider.
