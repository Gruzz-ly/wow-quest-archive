'''The Light of the Dawntower''' concludes the The Guiding Star chapter of the [[Hallowfall storyline]]. The campaign continues immediately with [[A Lamplighter's Duty]].

==Objectives==
Assist the [[Lamplighter]]s in lighting the [[dawntower]].
* Witness the lighting of the dawntower{{Co|54.11|64.66|Hallowfall}}

==Description==
<Name>, [[Faerin]] went to light the dawntower. She said it keeps the light of the Sacred Flame shining upon [[Hallowfall]]. [[Great Kyron|Kyron]] is there as well.

It's hard to imagine that any beacon could outshine their star [[Beledar]], but I am eager to see this new expression of the [[Light]].

Meet me by the dawntower and we can see how the Sacred Flame of the [[Arathi]] helps to safeguard these long-lost cousins of mine.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Tower-Keeper's Shoes]]
* [[Tower-Keeper's Grips]]
* [[Tower-Keeper's Shoulderguards]]
* [[Tower-Keeper's Waistguard]]

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|11|70}}
* 5,600 [[XP]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Hallowfall Arathi Commendation]] (+2,500 [[reputation]] with [[Hallowfall Arathi]]) (first time) or 125x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Completion==
Just in time, <name>--Beledar has fallen dark for a time. But now we have our own light to hold back the darkness.

==Notes==
On accept, Alleria and Anduin run off. Faerin and Kyron are standing in the base of the tower in [[Tenir's Ascent]], but instead of heading to them, talk to Anduin standing outside some distance away:
{{Dialogue|Faerin says these dawntowers, with the Lamplighters' aid, keep the Arathi ready for whatever darkness comes. Do you feel ready, <name>?

{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready.}}}}
A [[The War Within in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] plays, The Crystal Changes:
{{#ev:youtube|L4j0x-ROtpQ|The Crystal Changes}}

''Exterior. Day. At Tenir's Ascent, Anduin Wrynn and the adventurer look up at Beledar. Faerin and Kyron channel a spell into the brazier at the bottom of the dawntower, lighting the tower. Mere seconds later, shadows progress down Beledar, dimming the light and darkening Hallowfall.''

{{Text|bossemote|Anduin Wrynn|What-- What is happening?}}

''Faerin walks up next to him.''

{{Text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|It's Beledar, our star. It shifts between the Light and... this. The dawntowers hold back the darkness with the Sacred Flame. But the Light always returns.}}

''Alleria, reclining against a wall some distance behind Faerin, Anduin, and the adventurer, takes a few steps toward them while looking up toward Beledar until she hears Xal'atath's whispering voice in her head. Shadow energy fills the edges of the screen as Alleria attempts to draw her bow, then decides against it.''

{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|The stars are devoured, and they light a candle.}}

''Alleria scans the area looking for the source of the voice.''

{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|You know how this ends, Alleria. Inevitably... the Void consumes everything.}}

''Xal'atath's face appears next to Alleria's and speaks into her ear, but when Alleria turns around to face her, Xal'atath disappears.''

{{Text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Show yourself monster!}}

''Xal'atath chuckles.''

{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|You know where to find me... deeper in the darkness.}}

''The shadows fade from the screen.''

After the cutscene, Anduin, Faerin, Kyron, and Alleria are all standing gathered outside the tower.
