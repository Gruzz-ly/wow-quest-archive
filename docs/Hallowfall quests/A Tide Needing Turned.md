'''A Tide Needing Turned''' begins the fifth and final chapter of the max-level [[The War Within (achievement)]] campaign. This quest was time-gated and unlocked the week of 3 September 2024.

==Objectives==
Meet with [[General Steelstrike]] in [[Hallowfall]].
* Traverse the Coreway to the Ringing Deeps (Optional)

==Description==
[[Xal'atath]]'s army has been capable of striking at us for a while now. So what caused her to choose this moment?

Something is wrong here. She waited for us to build an army in response, and then attacks openly. We're playing into her hands.

Report to the [[Arathi]] general. I'll head to the battlefield directly.
