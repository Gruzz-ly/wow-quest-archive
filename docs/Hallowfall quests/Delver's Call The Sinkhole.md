==Objectives==
Complete the Sinkhole delve on any difficulty.
*The [[Sinkhole]] delve completed on any difficulty

==Description==
We have reports of large amounts of [[kobyss]] gathering towards a lair called the Sinkhole. There are concerns they plan to attack the smaller coast villages when they get the chance.

There's a hefty reward for anyone who can go into the Sinkhole and stop whatever they're planning!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|84|27}}
* 15,650 [[XP]]
*[[Companion Experience]]
*100x [[Resonance Crystals]]

==Progress==
Beware of what lurks within the Sinkhole.

==Completion==
Thank you for the aid. It's hard to aid everyone in Hallowfall given the current situation.

Hopefully, the kobyss will think twice about trying any further attacks.

==Patch changes==
