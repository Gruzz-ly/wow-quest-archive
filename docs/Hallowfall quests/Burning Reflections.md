==Objectives==
Help [[Baron Sybaestan Braunpyke|Sybaestan]] mourn his brother.
* Speak with Sybaestan to begin
* Memories Burned (3)

==Description==
Sybaestan could use your support now. [[Sir Theleon Braunpyke|His little brother]] was his best friend. Only death could separate them... and it has. He is not taking it well.

It is customary to burn written memories of the deceased. By committing them to the flames, we let go our heartache and let the warmth of memory heal us. It is a bittersweet time. You were with Theleon at the end, too. That might help Sybaestan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The ritual helps ease the hearts of many.

==Completion==
It worries me Sybaestan's still in such anger over his grief.

==Notes==
Catch up with [[Baron Sybaestan Braunpyke]] to the southwest by a large fire as [[Prioress Haelsey Murrpray]] walks away:
:{{text|say|Prioress Haelsey Murrpray|Remember what I've said, Baron, and keep hope burning.}}
:{{text|say|Baron Sybaestan Braunpyke|I... I will keep your idea in mind, Prioress. Thank you.}}

Speak with Sybaestan:
{{Dialogue|Theleon... If there was only something I could do...

{{gossip|quest=|<You pat Sybaestan's shoulder awkwardly.>}}<br>
{{gossip|quest=|<You nod solemnly to Sybaestan in silence.>}}<br>
{{gossip|quest=|<You engulf Sybaestan in a huge hug.>}}<br>
{{gossip|quest=|<You stand ready to help, shuffling your feet awkwardly.>}}<br>
{{gossip|quest=|<You quietly tell Sybaestan you are ready whenever he is.>}}
}}

Pick any option. A Memory paper lights up in front of the fire, so interact with it and the player will pick up a book and start writing in it:
:{{text|say|Baron Sybaestan Braunpyke|My oldest memory of Theleon... I remember he was in his crib and I'd been told to leave him alone to sleep.}}
:{{text|say|Baron Sybaestan Braunpyke|But I didn't want my little brother to be lonely, so I put our lynx's kittens in with him.}}
:{{text|say|Baron Sybaestan Braunpyke|Mother was so upset because Theleon could have been smothered, but I just didn't want him to have to be alone.... Like he is now.}}
:''The player throws the book into the fire.''

Pick up another Memory:
:{{text|say|Baron Sybaestan Braunpyke|Mother was so worried about Theleon coming with me on the Hallowfall expedition.}}
:{{text|say|Baron Sybaestan Braunpyke|Theleon told her not to worry. I would be there to look after him. I assured her I always would.}}
:{{text|say|Baron Sybaestan Braunpyke|I always had an eye out for him. Except... My best wasn't good enough.}}

And the third:
:{{text|say|Baron Sybaestan Braunpyke|We fought sometimes. What brothers don't? He was more cautious than I. We disagreed over that the most.}}
:{{text|say|Baron Sybaestan Braunpyke|But he was the wiser. I can see that now. What am I do to without you, Theleon? How can I remain centered?}}
:{{text|say|Baron Sybaestan Braunpyke|I'm sorry, <name>. I think I'd like to be alone for awhile.}}
:''Sybaestan walks off.''
