==Objectives==
Rescue 8 injured mechagnomes.
* [[Injured Mechagnome]]s rescued (8)

==Description==
A conspiracy of [[raven]]s is preying on [[Commoner|citizens]] of [[Rustbolt]]! It's most unacceptable! 

[[Prince Erazmin]] has asked me to rescue as many citizens as I can, but I could use your help. I've tracked the ravens to this hill. We blast the ravens out of the sky, and you rescue the [[Mechagon mechagnome|mechagnomes]].

Use my marker gun if you need help bringing the ravens down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

You've lived up to your reputation.
