==Objectives==
Collect 10 Damaged Energy Cells.
* [[Damaged Energy Cell]] (10)

==Description==
You will not be sorry that you rescued [[Pristy Quickcharge|my dear sister]] and me, <name>.

We are the vanguard of a new technological revolution, creating opportunities for all to enhance their lives with incredible [[technology]]!

But, before we can do that, we need our laboratory to be fully powered. Those ruffians from [[Mechagon City|Mechagon]] really did a number on our equipment.

Fully charged energy cells are exceptionally rare around here, but I can make do with broken ones.

Check around town, in the wreckage from the last attack.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
*[[Empty Energy Cell]]

==Progress==
Everything old can be made new again.

==Completion==
These are broken, but not TOO broken... Yes, I'm sure I can get these working again.

You may keep one as your recompense.
