==Description==
The garbage in these trash heaps is full of rare metals: [[Dalaranium]], [[Suramarite]], even [[Gnomeisium]]! 

I've not seen this much easy [[gold]] to be had, since they left the vault door open in [[Boralus]]! You help me collect some of the metal, and my friend [[Steelsage Gao|Gao]] will sell it on the black market.

I've got a device that can tear the metal right out of the trash!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]
