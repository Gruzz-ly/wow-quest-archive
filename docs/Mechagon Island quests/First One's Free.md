==Objectives==
Punchcard Satchel recovered.
* [[Punchcard Satchel]]

==Description==
The pocket-sized computational device can accept [[punch card]]s to upgrade and modify its performance.

I could give you a punch card, but a particularly crafty trogg, Moch'k Eight-Thumbs, stole my satchel full of cards.

Kill Moch'k Eight-Thumbs, recover my satchel, and I'll set you up with a punch card for free.

(Moch'k Eight-Thumbs: A notorious technology snatcher, who harasses Rustbolt citizens.)

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Completion==
You are rather amazing for someone with so little mechanization!
