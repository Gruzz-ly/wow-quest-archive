==Objectives==
Activate the [[Synchroscope]] when [[Christy Punchcog|Christy]] tells you to fire.
* Initiate synchronization
* Synchronization complete
* Open the [[Mekkatorque's Escape Pod|escape pod]]

==Description==
We now have a baseline of who [[Gelbin Mekkatorque|Mekkatorque]] is, looks like there could be some room for improvement.

Your assistance is needed to get him stabilized and synchronized before removing him from his pod.

Please position yourself by the Synchroscope. I will make adjustments, you will need to fire the machine when I call.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you successfully push the button?

==Completion==
Your button pushing skills are commendable.

We are fortunate you were here.

==Notes==
On accept:

:{{text|say|Christy Punchcog|Excellent. Now we use the data to synchronize the units with the subject's neural oscillations.}}
:{{text|yell|Christy Punchcog|Fire the synchroscope!}}

Activate the Synchroscope at the bottom of the ramp.

:{{text|say|Christy Punchcog|Amazing gamma amplitude in this sequence. With a few adjustments, we can enhance his logical reasoning tenfold.}}
:{{text|say|[[Sapphronetta Flivvers]]|We like him just the way he is, though. Too much logic, and he could lose his heart.}}
:{{text|say|Christy Punchcog|A seemingly frivolous priority, given the opportunity to achieve perfection...}}
:{{text|say|Christy Punchcog|But if you insist, I will retain his prior functionality... flaws and all.}}

Open the escape pod to reveal Mekkatorque - alive, but still comatose. Turn in to Christy.
