==Objectives==
Kill Bondo Bigblock.
* [[Bondo Bigblock]] slain

==Description==
Those of us with enough mechanization survived, but it didn't matter. Bondo Bigblock sold us out. In exchange for full mechanization, he built [[Gnomebot|giant bots]] and attacked [[Rustbolt]]. 

He will continue to act against us, till those few of us left are dead. 

We must remove this threat immediately.

(Bondo Biglock: Fully mechanized and loyal to King Mechagon.)

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|q1=20|item1=Spare Parts
}}

You will also receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
Will you help me deal with this threat?

==Completion==
We can start to rebuild now.

==Notes==
This quest is only available when [[Chromie]] is offering the quest [[The Other Place]], which takes you to an alternate Mechagon.
