'''Operation: Mechagon - The Mechoriginator''' is the final quest in the [[Mechagon storyline]]. This quest is required for [[The Mechagonian Threat]]; however, the objective can be marked as complete with [[#Notes|a skip option]], so you no longer need to actually run the dungeon to unlock the [[Mechagnome (playable)|mechagnome]] allied race.

==Objectives==
Enter [[Operation: Mechagon|Mechagon]] and defeat [[King Mechagon]].
* [[King Mechagon (tactics)|King Mechagon]] slain

==Description==
My father's madness won't be contained to [[Mechagon Island|this island]].

King Mechagon is creating a [[Mechoriginator|massive device]] capable of reversing the [[Curse of Flesh]] across the entirety of [[Azeroth]]!

Any [[race]]s forged by the [[Titan]]s will return to their original state. For us [[gnome]]s, that means [[Mechagnome|fully mechanical]]. For [[Dwarf|dwarves]] and [[trogg]]s, [[Earthen|stone]]. [[Vrykul]], [[Iron vrykul|iron]].

The list goes on, but most races aren't even ON the list. Anything not forged by the titans will be completely obliterated.

We must stop King Mechagon before it's too late!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|93|60|}}
* 35,700 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]
*[[S.P.A.R.E. Crate]]
*[[Humming Azerite Heart]] (2,500x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
King Mechagon's madness threatens all of us. We must stop my father!

==Completion==
That robot... that AI... was not my father.

My father died the day he abandoned his body and [[soul]] for full mechanization. The day he betrayed our people.

The burden of leadership has rested on my shoulders for some time... Only now, do I feel I can embrace it.

I will lead my people with wisdom, ingenuity, and humility. Thank you, <name>.

==Criteria of==
*[[The Mechagonian Threat]]
