==Objectives==
Gain access to the Charging Station in [[Bondo's Yard]], then use it to charge an [[Empty Energy Cell]].
* Find [[Charging Station]]
* Access bought from [[Flux]]
* [[Energy Cell]] charged

==Description==
Do you feel the energy rippling through the ground here, my dear test subject?

<[[Flip Quickcharge|Flip]] inhales deeply.>

Without that constant bristle of electricity, nothing of any meaning would exist.

[[Pristy Quickcharge|My dear sister]] and I have tapped into a high-voltage power line buried here, but the real juice is over in Bondo's Yard. He selfishly hoards access to the heftiest power line in [[Mechagon Island|Mechagon]]!

If you want to recharge your empty energy cells, you're going to have to get access to the Charging Station from Flux.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Bondo's dunderhead who lucked into the best bargaining chip on the island.

==Completion==
Flux is rude, crude, and I suspect more than a little unglued.

Be careful with that wondrous energy cell. Those little packs of power are worth their weight in [[gold]] out here in Mechagon!
