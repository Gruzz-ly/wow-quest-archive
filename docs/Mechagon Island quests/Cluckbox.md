==Objectives==
Show the Cluckbox to [[Vera Lonelycog]] in [[Rustbolt]] on [[Mechagon Island]].
* [[Cluckbox (item)]]

==Description==
<In the sparking, smoldering wreckage of [[Unit 35]], you find a small, black cube.

It looks to be made of a metallic substance and appears unharmed.

Looking closely, you see a single word imprinted in the metal -- "Cluckbox."

This particular [[Mechanical chicken|mechanical fowl]] was operating quite strangely. Someone in [[Rustbolt]] will probably want to investigate.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Completion==
Is that the cluckbox from that rust-blooded Unit 35? I hate that thing!

<Vera grabs the box from you and throws it to the ground. She stomps on it a few times, then once more for good measure.>

Someone programmed that thing to wake up the island at dawn every morning! Who does that?

<Vera glares in the direction of the city.>

If you see that thing show up again, smash it good for me.
