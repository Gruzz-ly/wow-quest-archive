==Notes==
;Speaking with Pristy
:We're so very excited to have you test the NRG-100!
{{Gossip|I'm ready to test the NRG-100}}
:<Pristy giggles.>
:You are certainly NOT ready, dead test subject!
:You haven't agreed to the verbal contract yet.
:{{Gossip|I'm ready to agree to your verbal contract.}}
:{{Gossip|Why do you have a verbal contract?}}
::We simply insist that every potential test subject confirm their ability and willingness to participate in our experiments.
::We believe that our technology can, and will, improve the lives of every living being on Azeroth. But we also believe that living beings should choose this improvement. We will not force it on anyone who does not ask for it.
::We're not wicked King Mechagon, after all!
::<Pristy giggles.>
::{{Gossip|Yes, of course... And how do I agree to the verbal contract?}}
:::Wondrous, let's proceed.
:::This verbal contract waives all previously held, typically understood, or spiritually derived claims regarding your physical form and its current functionality.
:::{{Gossip|What sort of functionality?}}
::::Specifically, you waive your claims to the following functionalities:
::::Resspiratory,
::::Circulatory,
::::Muscular,
::::Reproductive,
::::Skeletal,
::::Digestive,
::::Both innate AND adaptive immunity,
::::Facial,
::::Structural,
::::General well-being,
::::and interminable biological life.
::::{{Gossip|Is there any functionality that I'm not waiving claim to?}}
:::::You'll be as cute as ever. There's no waiving that one, not for you. No way.
:::::<Pristy looks you up and down slowly.>
:::::{{Gossip|My face is up here, Pristy.}}
::::{{Gossip|What was the last one?}}
:::::Interminable biological life.
:::::Oh, it's not as scary as it sounds, I waived mine long ago!
:::::Are you ready to continue?
:::::{{Gossip|Okay...}}
::::::::Wondrous, let's proceed.
::::::::Do you, <name>, hereby waive all of the claims I've previously mentioned in their entirety, for all eternity?
:::::::{{Gossip|I do.}}
::::::::{{Text|say|Pristy Quickcharge says: Dear brother, <name> has waived all claims.}}
::::::::{{Text|say|Flip Quickchar|Tremendous! Now the experiment can begin.}}
::::::::Wondrous! Welcome to the Quickcharge team, dear test subject.
::::::::Your verbal agreement is now stored on file here at our laboratory.
::::::::You're authorized to participate in any and all future experiments we conduct at this and any and all future locations, regardless of risk, life expectancy, or your general uneasiness at the aims or methods of said experiments.
::::::::Welcome to the future!
:::::::{{Gossip|I need more time to think this over.}}
::::::::Of course, dear test subject.
::::::::Flip and I would never want you to feel pressured to participate.
::::::::Take your time. Consider the joys of your future life, when its{{sic}} enhanced by all of the wondrous technology we can create.
::::::::Consider the incredible enhancements you can already see on your own bodies. The Quickcharge twins are walking testaments to the power of technology!
::::::::Let me know when you're ready to proceed.
::::::::{{Gossip|Okay, I'm ready to proceed.}}
::::::::{{Gossip|I'll come back later.}}
:::::::::Please do, dear test subject. We'll be waiting.
