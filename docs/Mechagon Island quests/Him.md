==Objectives==
Gather data from [[gnome]]s and [[Mechagon mechagnome|mechagnomes]] in [[Mechagon Island|Mechagon]].
* Speak with [[Elya Codepunch]]
* Speak with [[Idee Quickcoil]]
* Speak with [[Pegi Cogster]]
* Speak with [[Quimby Sparklighter]]
* Speak with [[Flouresce Brightgear]]
* Speak with [[Stuard Sharpsprocket]]

==Description==
Speak to some of the gnomes in Mechagon, enhanced or otherwise. Of my people, ask what they hope for in a leader of our kind. Of our new friends, ask what they appreciate most about [[Gelbin Mekkatorque|their current leader]].

From what I have learned thus far, the High Tinker has always led his people by necessity, he never sought or desired the crown. I believe the gnomes should be united once again.

I seek a solution that will be most amenable to all. Will you gather the information I need?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have your communications been productive?

==Completion==
Excellent, excellent, these are the results I was hoping for. You have strengthened my theory.

==Notes==
The NPCs to speak to are all around Rustbolt.

Elya Codepunch is standing by the [[Rustbolt Gramophone]].

{{Gossip|What do you look for in a leader?}}
:{{text|say|[[Elya Codepunch]]|Well, they must be as brilliant as I! Or is it me?}}

:{{text|say|[[Yergin Galvaquad]]|I want a leader that helps me realize my value in our community, and doesn't just see us as tools.}}
:{{text|say|[[Tera Geotorque]]|Gelbin creates things that make the world better. He keeps us moving, he keeps us safe. No one can look through the gnomes with Mekkatorque before us.}}
:{{text|say|[[Alvin Teasprocket]]|He listens and shares ideas from his prolific mind. He can untangle a mess that seems insurmountable, without losing his cool.}}
:{{text|say|[[Pete Mixelgear]]|He plays a mean harmonica.}}

Pegi Cogster is sitting next to the [[Meeting Stone]] for [[Operation: Mechagon]].

:{{text|say|[[Lelu Multipass]]|If someone is willing to fight for us, protect us, I will follow them to the [[Blasted Lands]] and back again!}}
:{{text|say|[[Pegi Cogster]]|A good leader would give us ownership... and accountability. They would not micromanage us.}}
:{{text|say|[[Spark Nimblecog]]|They would have courage, and honesty - they would trust us and builds{{sic}} us up!}}
:{{text|say|[[Abel Camhorn]]|Why, Gelbin, he is the most magnanimous, big-hearted, big-brained, big-eared man to wear the heavy mantle of leading us wily gnomefolk.}}
:{{text|say|Abel Camhorn|I think that young man has done a right good job of it!}}

Quimby Sparklighter is near Rustbolt's southern gate, not far from [[Recycler Kerchunk]].

:{{text|say|[[Luka Morespark]]|Want them not to be a dastard...}}
:{{text|say|[[Raz L. Dazzle]]|Gelbin is strong of heart... and he's not afraid to say what is really on his mind.}}

:{{text|say|[[Flouresce Brightgear]]|I'd just like for someone to help us clean up this mess.}}
:{{text|say|[[Lanna Statiglow]]|Gelbin notices those who put in more effort, care more, try harder... he sees those that just make things better.}}

Stuard Sharpsprocket is sitting on a fence not far from Elya.

{{Gossip|Why do you appreciate Gelbin Mekkatorque?}}
:{{text|say|[[Stuard Sharpsprocket]]|He shares his responsibilities, he is one of us. He is more than a leader, he is our friend.}}
:{{text|say|[[Twyla Flickspring]]|There is nothing Mekkatorque would not do to help a fellow gnome. His loyalty is to us first, the [[Alliance]] second... as it should be.}}
:{{text|say|[[Jaska Aeroflange]]|Mekkatorque's trust brings confidence. I don't know how to explain it better. When he tells me I can do a thing... you know what? I realize I can!}}
:{{text|say|[[Briony Vandercog]]|There is none I respect more.}}
:{{text|say|[[Sapphronetta Flivvers]]|A good leader should have strong eyebrows. His are very commanding!}}
