==Objectives==
Ride with Prince Erazmin to [[Junkwatt Depot]].
* Ride with [[Prince Erazmin]]

==Description==
[[Rustbolt]] isn't usually in this level of malfunction.

[[King Mechagon]] attacked our town last night. His mechanical armies captured many members of the [[Rustbolt Resistance]] and destroyed as much as they could before we drove them out.

The [[prisoner]]s are being processed at Junkwatt Depot. After that, they'll be transferred down into King Mechagon's [[Mechagon City|underground city]]... for full mechanization.

We can't let that happen. Will you help me rescue them?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Completion==
This is where they process all prisoners before sending them into King Mechagon's city for reprogramming.
