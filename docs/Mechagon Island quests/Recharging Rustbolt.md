==Objectives==
Use the NRG-100 to charge 6 generator energy cells.
* Equip the [[NRG-100]]
* NRG-100 cell charged (6)

==Description==
Our personal generator is worthless until we recharge its empty energy cells.

As [[Flip Quickcharge|my dear brother]] says, energy cells are the lifeblood of innovation. Everything in [[Mechagon Island|Mechagon]] needs power, and energy cells deliver that power in a wonderfully universal format.

But, once they're drained of power, most people toss the empty cells away.

Most people are fools, dear test subject.

We have perfected the [[technology]] to recharge small numbers of energy cells back to full power.

Will you help us test it?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
*[[Energy Cell]]

==Progress==
We only test the best!

==Completion==
Wondrous work, my dear test subject!

I detected unconventional electrical discharges from the NRG-100, but I see now that I was wrong to worry.

It's still in one piece. Oh, and so are you!

Cheer up. You've already outsurvived 5% of our test subjects!

==Notes==
*Go to the [[Heaps]], kill [[Malfunctioning Scrapbot]]s, [[Malfunctioning Scraphound]]s, and [[Malfunctioning Scrap Pup]]s to automatically recharge the item.
