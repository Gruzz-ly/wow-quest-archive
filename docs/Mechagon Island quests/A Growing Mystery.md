==Objectives==
10 Ancient Runestones collected.
* [[Runestone Fragments]] (10)

==Description==
This runestone could be of [[Vrykul]] origins. Is it possible that Vrykul once visited [[Mechagon Island|this island]]?

Where there's one runestone, there's usually more. The roots of [[lasher]]s are drawn to the [[magic]] of runestones. If there are more buried here, the Lasher roots maybe wrapped around them!

Clear these lashers and see if any have runestones tangled in their roots.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]
