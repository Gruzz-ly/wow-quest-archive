The Bubble-eyed Rolly used to be plentiful in the nearby pond. Last week they all started to vanish!

A large [[water elemental]] has been swallowing all the [[fish]]! They are still alive, just swimming around inside the elemental now.

I need you to kill that elemental, and catch three Bubbly-eyed Rolly so I can examine their condition.
