==Objectives==
Collect an Overcharged Mecha-core from the [[Overcharged Mechanocrawler]].
*[[Overcharged Mecha-core]]

==Description==
You've been holding out on me!

Here I was, thinking that we're friends now and yet you neglected to tell me about your magnificient wrench!

<Christy inspects it closely.>

Well, not too magnificient... I recognize the [[Ub3r-Spanner]] from its blueprints, but whoever built this is lacks a certain level of craftsmanship.

I will upgrade it for you. Bring me the Overcharged Mecha-core from a mechanocrawler.

No excuses. I will fix your mistakes.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Upgrade!]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Imagine crafting an Ub3r-Spanner without an overcharged mecha-core... Ha!

==Completion==
This will only take a minute. Keep a close eye on what I do, and you will learn a thing or ten.

==Progression==
...
