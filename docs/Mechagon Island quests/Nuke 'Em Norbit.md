==Objectives==
Eliminate the 5 Reinforced Sparkweave Eggs
* [[Norbit Control Pannel|Norbit Controls]] activated
* [[Motospider]]s destroyed (40)
* [[Reinforced Sparkweave Egg]]s destroyed with [[Scrap Bomb]] (5)

==Description==
These motospiders continue to multiply unchecked. If we don't slow them down they'll overrun [[Rustbolt]] soon.

I've modified [[Norbit Z-12|Norbit]] here with adequate firepower to take the spiders head on!

Would you pilot Norbit and destroy the Reinforced Sparkweave Eggs?
