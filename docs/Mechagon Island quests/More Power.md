==Objectives==
Connect power lines from [[Bondo's Yard]] to the Quickcharge laboratory.
* Attach [[Alpha Wire (Mechagon)|Alpha Wire]] to [[Alpha Pylon (Mechagon)|Alpha Pylon]]
* Attach [[Beta Wire (Mechagon)|Beta Wire]] to [[Beta Pylon (Mechagon)|Beta Pylon]]
* Attach [[Gamma Wire]] to [[Gamma Pylon]]
* Attach [[Delta Wire]] to [[Delta Pylon]]
* Use Jump Cable (JDA)

==Description==
Welcome back, dear test subject.

[[Pristy Quickcharge|My dear sister]] has kindly asked me to administer today's experiment, which falls below our typical standards of legality...

You may, as always, choose not to participate and we will acquire sufficient replacement test subjects.

Our new project requires more energy than our generator can manage. We must supercharge it with a jolt of power from the outside.

Bondo's Yard has the best power line in [[Mechagon Island|Mechagon]], so we shall siphon what we need from those rapscallions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]
*[[Energy Cell]]

==Progress==
More power, more projects!

==Completion==
Our generator is bristling with power... I've never felt so alive!

==Notes==
;Upon attaching the last wire
:{{Text|say|Flip Quickcharge|Power spike, dear sister! Our test subject has done it!}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Flip Quickcharge|So much power... the generator... it's beautiful...}}
:{{Text|say|Pristy Quickcharge|Stabilize yourself, dear brother. We must continue our project.}}
:{{Text|say|Flip Quickcharge|Of course, dear sister. You are always correct.}}
