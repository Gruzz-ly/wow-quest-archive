[[King Mechagon]] won't be happy we're on [[Mechagon Island|his island]].

But a cruel [[king]] like that is gonna have enemies. You and I know that better than most, yeah?

While [[Skaggit]] and the crew get our foothold dug in here, you and I are gonna find some potential allies to shield us from King Mechagon's wrath.

Those two guards ran into that junkheap town up the hill. That place don't smell of royalty to me... Let's check there first.
