==Objectives==
Collect 4 Heat Tolerant Ooze and 6 Acquisitioned Machine Parts.
* [[Heat Tolerant Ooze]] (4)
* [[Acquisitioned Machine Part]] (6)

==Description==
I think I can modify one of our existing devices to give us access to [[Gelbin Mekkatorque]] without disturbing his life preserving functions.

There are some items I will need you to procure.

From the nearby vector of the [[Heaps]], you will find [[Gnomebot|scrapbots]] and [[mechanical wolf|scraphounds]]. These would be a fine source of spare parts for my construction project.

The [[Outflow]] is home to some particularly [[ooze|slimy]] friends. From them, you will find excellent ingredients for the heat resistant lubricant we need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were all assets found?

==Completion==
Yes, yes, these will do.

Excellent work, <name>!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Waren Gearhart|I will oversee the construction of the units to open the escape pod. I estimate the chances of crushing the occupant at sub-fifty percent.}}

Kill scraphounds and other robots in the Heaps outside Rustbolt for the machine parts, and then kill elemental oozes in the Outflow near the [[Reclamation Rig]] for the lubricant.

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Prince Erazmin|<Name>! We have an emergency that requires immediate attention!}}
