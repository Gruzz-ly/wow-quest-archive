==Objectives==
Acquire the powercore schematics from Bondo Bigblock.
* Speak with [[Bondo Bigblock]]
* [[Robot]]s defeated (6)
* [[Clockwork Giant]]s defeated (2)
* Speak with Bondo Bigblock
* [[Powercore Schematics]]

==Description==
I need to rebuild the main powercore. It's a [[500S-Cybergenic Powercore|500S Mekronic]] so I'll need the operational schematics to get the work done. Only person I know who has a copy of that is Bondo Bigblock.

We're going to need Bondo's help to finish this. Maybe if you ask him, he'll lend us his schematics.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
Did you make a deal with Bondo?

==Completion==
Great work <name>. All that's left is to rebuild this power core.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Clockwork Automaton]]s and [[Repeating Wrenchbot]]s.
