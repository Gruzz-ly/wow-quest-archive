==Objectives==
Acquire Shellsteel Plating, Multi-Leg Chaindrive, and a Mechanobot Ignition.
*[[Mechanobot Ignition]]
*[[Shellsteel Casing]]
*[[Multi-Leg Chaindrive]]

==Description==
As a reward for all your help here, I was planning to fix this old mechaspider mount to give to you.

I could use some more of your help though to get this project started!

I'll need parts off a few of the bots nearby, and maybe you could talk to [[Cork Stuttguard|Cork Stuttgard]]{{Sic}} at [[Bondo's Yard]] and see if you can get a Mechanobot Ignition system.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
Did you find those parts yet?

==Completion==
These parts will get us started, but there's a lot of work to do still.

==Notes==
Shellsteel Casings drop from [[Steelplated Hardshell]]s ({{coords|80|55|Mechagon Island}}) and the Multi-Leg Chaindrive drops from [[Sparkweaver Ohm]] at [[Sparkweaver Point]].
