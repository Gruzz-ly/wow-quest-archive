==Objectives==
Destroy Pummeller Red, Pummeller Orange, and Pummeller Grey
* [[Pummeller Grey]] slain
* [[Pummeller Red]] slain
* [[Pummeller Orange]] slain

==Description==
[[Mechagon Island|This land]] is already a monumental disaster, but it could get worse!

The [[Venture Company]] is here, and will exploit this land for every ounce of profit they can make. We must make their venture here unprofitable, so they will leave.

Destroy the three expensive security units with them, and they may leave for more profitable ventures.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
Did you hurt them in their wallet?

==Completion==
This certainly hurts their profits. Now we see if they leave!
