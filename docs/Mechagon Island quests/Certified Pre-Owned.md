==Objectives==
Collect 15 Salvaged Mechagnome Appendages.
* [[Salvaged Mechagnome Appendage]] (15)

==Description==
First, let me say that you will ALWAYS be our favorite test subject.

But our experiments require far more sacrifice than a single test subject can offer. And, from time to time, some of those test subjects require new limbs.

My [[Flip Quickcharge|dear brother]] and I have a nascent concept for expanding the average [[Life spans|lifespan]] of [[mechanical]] appendages. But we've run out of components to experiment on.

Salvage some appendages from the [[Heaps|heap]] outside [[Rustbolt|town]] so we can continue our experiments.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

{{Itembox|You will receive:|Energy Cell
}}

==Progress==
Don't worry about any malfunctioning or missing parts. [[Gill the Drill|Gill]] will help us repair whatever you find.

==Completion==
Wondrous! This should last us...

<Pristy counts the appendages and scribbles in her notebook.>

...at least 3 hours. Wow, we're really churning through these appendages!
