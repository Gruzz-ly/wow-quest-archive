When [[Chromie]] is NOT a quest giver visitor to [[Mechagon Island]], use a [[Personal Time Displacer]] to reach the alternate future, complete at least [[Adapt, Improve, Overcome!]], and then kill [[The Rusty Prince]] to trigger this quest.

==Objectives==
Deliver the Visual Holo Sphere to [[Izira Gearsworn|Izira Geasworn]]{{sic}} in [[Rustbolt]].
* [[Visual Holo Sphere]] obtained from [[Armored Vaultbot]]
* Craft an {{item|Armored Vaultbot Key|Armored Vaultbot key}} from [[Pascal-K1N6]]. (optional)

==Description==
You exist here due to a [[time]] anomaly, but you must return to your own time and help us there.

The Visual Holo Sphere from the Vaultbot nearby contains the data necessary to defeat [[King Mechagon]] before he can use the [[Mechoriginator]].

Deliver the Visual Holo Sphere to me in your reality. With luck I will be able to rewind history and prevent this existence from ever happening.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* [[Spare Parts]] x40
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
You will have to return to your time period.

==Completion==
Let's hope that you bringing me this, is not what triggers that [[Alternate timeline|alternate reality]].

==Notes==
To complete this quest efficiently, you will need to already turned in the [[Blueprint: Vaultbot Key (item)]] from the main timeline Armored Vaultbot to Pascal-K1N6, then have one crafted ''before'' traveling to the alternate future.

Without the key, you would have to wait and hope another player that has one comes along.
