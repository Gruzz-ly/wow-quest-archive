==Objectives==
Collect 15 discarded technologies from techno-animated [[Sludge beast|sludge]].
* Activate [[:Spark-7143]] in The [[Outflow]]
* [[Discarded Technology]] (15)
* [[Spark-7143]] (provided)

==Description==
When I say that power is [[life]], I'm not speaking figuratively, my dear test subject.

Properly harnessed, power can create life itself--or at least a close enough facsimile for our purposes.

There is a massive reserve of discarded [[technology]] lurking deep in the mucky depths of the Outflow. As usual, [[Mechagon Island|Mechagon]]'s trash is our treasure.

I've finally perfected my device that will animate the sludge to bring that technology up to the surface for you.

All you have to do is pop 'em and grab the tech!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

{{Itembox|You will receive:|Energy Cell
}}

==Progress==
Please thoroughly document any adverse side effects you experience while using the Spark-7143.

==Completion==
Glorious recovery!

And you say that the Spark-7143 did NOT cause an extreme burning sensation in your gut?

<Flip makes a quick note and smiles.>

Wondrous indeed!

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Flip Quickcharge|No one wants to plumb the depths of that muck. So we'll make the muck bring it to us!}}
