==Objectives==
Use Pascal-K1N6 to craft a Scrap Grenade.
* [[Scrap Grenade]]s crafted at [[Pascal-K1N6]]

==Description==
Behold, the fabled [[Pascal Workshop of Rustbolt]] -- MY workshop!

Countless inventions have sprung forth into existence on this very spot, including my very finest invention, Pascal-K1N6!

Pascal-K1N6 can craft anything... as long as you have the blueprints for it.

And since I have you to thank for the K1N6's safe return to [[Rustbolt]], would you like to learn how to access his blueprints database?

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Upload: Scrap Grenade]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
Remember, you can collect Spare Parts from almost anything on Mechagon.

==Completion==
Pascal-K1N6 is a marvel of junkyard tinkering! A wonder of the modern age!

Did I mention that I invented him myself? Of course I did.
