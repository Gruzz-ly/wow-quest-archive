==Objectives==
Hack a projector to display the [[Rustbolt Resistance]] emblem and defend it.
* [[Mechagon Projector]] hacked (Optional)
* [[HK-8 Aerial Oppression Unit]] repelled

==Description==
My people are once again safe... for now.

[[King Mechagon]] won't stop sending [[Arcforged|his armies]] at us as long as he does not fear us.

We must send him a message.

Climb to the top of the ramparts, and hack one of my father's projectors to proudly shine the [[banner]] of the Rustbolt Resistance big enough for the whole [[Mechagon Island|island]] to see.

I'm sure that'll attract the attention of my father, King Mechagon.

(HK-8 Aerial Oppression Unit - King Mechagon wields a wide range of large, deadly robots in his army.)

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,800 [[XP]]
* +350 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Completion==
[[Rustbolt]] already looks improved, doesn't it?

It's not the first time we've had to rebuild it, and it won't be the last.

==Notes==

The oppression unit is immune to attacks and summons [[Overcharged Coilbearer]]s. Click on [[Power Surge Orb]]s that spawn from the coilbearers to damage the unit. [[Gazlowe]] and [[Tinkmaster Overspark|Overspark]] on their flying machines aid in the attack.
