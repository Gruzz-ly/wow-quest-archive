==Objectives==
Quasi-Facet scan creatures in [[Mechagon Island|Mechagon]]

* Scan creatures in Mechagon
* [[Quasi-Faceted Scanner]] (provided)

==Description==
I must share the wonders of this place with all of [[Azeroth]] in a way that will entertain young and old alike. I will use the technology here to create a new line of toys unlike anything seen before!

My Quasi-Faceted scanner can help construct perfect replicas of things here on the island.

I just need a helpful individual such as yourself to scan a few things around this area.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|q1=|item1=Azeroth Mini: Starter Pack
|q2=40|item2=Spare Parts
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*17,850 [[XP]]
*+150 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
Did you get me some scans?

==Completion==
The first batch of toys is all ready to go!

==Notes==
Leave [[Rustbolt]] and look for most kinds of mobs to scan: vehicles don't count, nor does anything that can't easily kill you. It cannot be aggroed beforehand, and if you use it on a mob in a group or near a group, it will aggro all of them and only get credit for the one targeted.

One suggestion is to use an [[Anti-Gravity Pack]] so that you can hover while scanning a mob, then easily fly away.

Return to Jepetto once you have filled the tracker bar to 100%.
