==Objectives==
Acquire a Sixteen-Servo-Actuator from Bondo Bigblock.
* Speak with [[Bondo Bigblock]]
* Bondo's [[Pistonhead|gang]] defeated in the circle (15)
* [[Knuckles]] defeated
* [[Sixteen-Servo-Actuator]]

==Description==
We're going to need a new Sixteen-Servo-Actuator if we're going to fix the controls on this thing.

Bondo's gang at the [[Bondo's Yard|yard]] probably has one, but they usually aren't too helpful.

Talk to Bondo, see if you can get us one.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
Did you head over to the yard yet?

==Completion==
I really didn't think Bondo would give us one of these!

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Recycler Kerchunk|Bondo's gonna be difficult, he never gives anything away for free!}}

;Speaking with Bondo
You got some guts coming to ask us for help.

{{Gossip|I need a sixteen spring servo-actuator.}}
:Sure we got one of those! It should be in that strongbox, just over there.
:If you want it, you just need to get past my whole gang first!

[[Pistonhead Recycler]]s, [[Humongous]], [[Repeating Wrenchbot]]s, and [[Chattertooth]] attack you. Once the objective is completed, Knucles attacks. After defeating him, open [[Bondo's Strongbox]].

;On completion
:{{Text|say|Recycler Kerchunk|Check back tomorrow, we may need some more help!}}
