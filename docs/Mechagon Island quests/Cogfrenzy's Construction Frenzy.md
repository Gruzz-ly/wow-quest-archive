==Objectives==
Help build construction projects.
*Contribute to construction projects

==Description==
You [[Rustbolt Resistance|Rustbolt resisters]] inspire me. Tinkering, building, exploring.

Letting your imagination run wild and then chasing after it, wherever it leads, with reckless abandon!

<Walton releases a deep sigh.>

I miss those days. I hope, someday, my conscience will allow me to stay on the surface with you all permanently...

Before I return to [[Mechagon City|Mechagon]], we must build something incredible.

[[Waren Gearhart|Waren]] and I have identified a large number of extra construction projects sites for today.

Build with boldness! 

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|q1=|item1=Cogfrenzy's Construction Toolkit
|q2=40|item2=Spare Parts
}}

You will also receive:
*+150 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
Even the greatest builders are eventually forgotten, but their creations are not.

==Completion==
Clever craftsmanship, <name>.

Continue practicing your construction and you'll replace me as Chief Architect in no time. Ha!
