==Objectives==
Collect 8 Golden Cogpaste.
* [[Golden Cogpaste]] (8)

==Description==
Once every week, [[Mechagon City|Mechagon]] expels a lot of excess oils through the outflow. That's why the place is a toxic mess!

Today they expelled a batch of Golden Cogpaste. The stuff is amazing! I make air fresheners out of it. Make's any mount smell like it's brand new!

Check all the pipes in the outflow, and see if you can collect some of this paste.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
I still could use that cogpaste.

==Completion==
I was running low on Air Fresheners, this will let me whip up a new batch right away!

==Progression==
