==Objectives==
Lead [[Gazlowe]]'s crew into the vault.
* Vault secured
* Gnome Kidnapped
* Vault breached

==Description==
Looks like the coast is clear with [[Tinkmaster Overspark|Overspark]] gone. Let's get inside that vault and see what's really going on here.

[[Mechagon Island|Mechagon]] or not, there'd better be some quality hardware in there to make this trip worth our time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Easy peasy. Now we just gotta get all this fancy [[Gnome|gnomish]] machinery workin' again!
