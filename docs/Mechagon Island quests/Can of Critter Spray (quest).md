* [[Can of Critter Spray]]

==Description==
<Inside the wreckage of the robot, you find a sealed can of anti-critter spray.

Destroying all life, down to the rats, seems cruel but on par for [[King Mechagon]].

Someone in Rustbolt might be able to provide additional insight.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 950 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Completion==
Oh, yeah, you didn't hear? Proclamation 7: King Mechagon outlawed non-mechanicals smaller than a [[baby]].

He thought that was so important that it was his SEVENTH proclamation ever made.

<Vera shakes her head.>

The king hated bugs, rats, anything uninvited that always finds its way into a city. So, he made them illegal. 

He arrested rabbits, squirrels, even fish. Held tiny trials, sentenced them to mechanization, or death, or exile.

He made those flying robots to deal with any that remained.
