==Objectives==
Show the Broken Unit 6 to [[Vera Lonelycog]] in [[Rustbolt]] on [[Mechagon Island]].
* [[Broken Unit 6 (item)]]

==Description==
<[[Unit 6]] sits here, nonfunctional following your attack.

There is something different and unsettling about this mechanical frog. It appeared to be mimicking frog behavior, but in a way that seemed wrong somehow.

None of the other [[mechanical frog]]s in the area behave similarly.

Instead of taking back only part of the unit for inspection, you pocket the entire frog. It's pretty small, after all.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Completion==
Is that one of the mechanical [[critter]]s? Ah, one of the dark metal ones.

I've never seen one up close. I kept my distance because they never felt... right to me.

No one in [[Rustbolt]] knows where they came from. Perhaps [[King Mechagon]] sent them to watch the other critters as they mechanized? He would be the type to want to watch their suffering.

Most think they're here to spy on us. You shouldn't have brought the whole thing back to the town. Just grab an eye, or a liver, next time.
