Destroy the Aerial Patroller XZ-2
* [[Aerial Patroller XZ-2]] slain

==Description==
One of [[King Mechagon]]'s older [[Aerial unit]]s is having mechanical problems and is grounded nearby.

They're trying to get it repaired, so we need to act fast while it's vulnerable.

Destroy the Aerial Patroller XZ-2 before they can get it repaired.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
Did you kill the Aerial Patroller XZ-2?

==Completion==
That's one less threat to our forces!
