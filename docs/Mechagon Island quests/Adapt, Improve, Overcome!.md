20 Pristine Hound Bolts, 4 Steel Tibia XS, and 2 Machined Heel Nut.
* [[Pristine Hound Bolts]] (20)
* [[Leg Strut XS]] (4)
* [[Sentry Heel Nut]] (2)

==Description==
[[Izira Gearsworn]] is still alive, she is [[Rustbolt]]'s strongest [[fighter]], but her legs are broken. If we're going to survive I need parts to repair and upgrade her.

There are machines all over with parts we can salvage. With some perseverance we should be able to fix Izira's legs.

Help me obtain the following parts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]
*[[Spare Parts]]

==Progress==
We need to start searching!

==Completion==
These are in excellent shape!

==Notes==
;On completion
:''Christy runs to [[Izira Gearsworn]].''
:{{Text|say|Christy Punchcog|These results are quite a triumph.}}
:{{Text|say|Christy Punchcog|I continue to be impressed at what you are able to achieve with such inferior mechanization.}}
:{{Text|say|Christy Punchcog|Once Izira is repaired we'll begin our resistance anew!}}
