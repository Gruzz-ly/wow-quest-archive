==Objectives==
Collect 20 Mechanical Giblets and repair the OOX-Bomber/MG.
* [[Mechanical Giblets]] (20)
* [[OOX-Bomber/MG]] repaired

==Description==
If you've spent any time with that arrogant nitwit, [[Tinkmaster Overspark|Overspark]], you know why I'm here.

To silence his boasting and finally prove that my inventions are better!

I've released countless [[mechanical chicken]]s across [[Mechagon Island|this island]] to analyze the technology here, adopt it, and evolve their own circuitry. One of them will become my ultimate battle chicken!

But [[Scrapbone|those]] idiot [[trogg]]s think my chickens are edible and keep bashing them.

Protect them, so my techno-evolutionary experiment can run its course.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
Imagine being so dumb that you try to eat a mechanical chicken...

==Completion==
Superlative intervention, <name>!

Now, we sit back and let the robots evolve themselves through natural selection... with no negative side effects whatsoever.
