==Objectives==
Show the Mechanical Egg Sac to [[Vera Lonelycog]] in [[Rustbolt]] on [[Mechagon Island]].
* [[Mechanical Egg Sac (item)]]

==Description==
<You find a [[mechanical]] [[egg]] sac inside of the defunct spiderbot.

This doesn't make any sense, [[robot]]s don't reproduce this way.

Or do they?

Someone in Rustbolt might have the answers.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Completion==
Well that's creepy.

Maybe [[King Mechagon]] thought we'd be scared of mechanical creatures that could reproduce.

I could see him doing something like that. Reveals his own fears more than ours.

Or maybe the [[mechanical spider]]s are... evolving.

Can programs do that?

...

Am I a program?

<Vera sits down to think.>
