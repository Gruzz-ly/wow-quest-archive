==Objectives==
Kill 12 Mechagon forces in [[Junkwatt Depot]].
* Mechagon enemies slain (12)

==Description==
[[King Mechagon|My father]] was once a good leader. He envisioned a brighter future for his people, and did everything in his power to help us acquire it.

But when his vision became misaligned with the dreams of his people, he failed to adapt. Instead, he grew rigid, forcing his will on others.

In secret experiments, he began fully mechanizing the bodies of those who resisted him.

It was horrible to watch... there was nothing left of the original [[gnome]]s who followed him willingly.

Only [[robot]]s remained. [[Slave]]s.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
If we don't stop my father here, we will all share these poor gnomes' fates.

==Completion==
If we don't stop my father, we will all share these poor gnomes' fates.
