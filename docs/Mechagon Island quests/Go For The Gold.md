* [[Chief's Key]]

==Description==
I've heard lot's of stories about dead fathers, mothers, and family treasures. Don't believe any of it. We're all here to get any [[pirate]] [[gold]], before these mecha-fools get it first!

If there's gold to be had here, it's in that fat chest the [[murloc]]s are guarding.

Kill their chief, empty out the chest, and we'll split it fifty-fifty, since I'm telling ya about it.

(Chief Curglrrmrgur: A notorious collector of lost pirates gold.)
