==Description==
<[[Prince Erazmin]] sifts through the resources you both collected.>

Yes... This appears to be sufficient material to repair that drill rig.

I'll do what I can with the parts that I have, but you will need to complete the repairs with yours.

When you're ready, return to that broken drill rig we found and open it up.

Together, we'll have it up and running in no time.

* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Completion==
