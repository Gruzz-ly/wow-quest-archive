* [[Spark Reactor]] delivered
* Circuit calibrated

==Description==
We saw a flare near [[Junkwatt Depot]].

The retrieval team has made it out with the power source. We are now forever safe from [[King Mechagon]]'s [[Annihilo-tron 5000|Annihilo-tron]], its heart will serve a new purpose.

This is great news!

However, the flare means they have company. Your help will be needed to extricate the team and retrieve the Spark Reactor.

Please move with haste, we are so close to completion.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are you ready?

==Completion==
I am quite pleased.

With a 40% chance of success, I was not sure the variables would reconcile in our favor.

It was a serendipitous sequence of events.

==Notes==
[[File:Mekkatorque is Iron Gnome.jpg|thumb|right|He ''is'' Iron Gnome.]]
Travel to the entrance to Junkwatt Depot to find [[Kelsey Steelspark]], accompanied by [[Shim Crankturner]] and [[Noden Gyrozap]], being chased by an [[Insurgent Coilbearer]] and two [[Insurgent Machinist]]s.
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|We've got incoming!}}

Kill the coilbearer to retrieve the Spark Reactor.

:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Get this back to town. Quickly!}}
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|We need to teach these bots some manners.}}

Kelsey, Shim, and Noden run back into Junkwatt Depot. Bring the reactor back to Rustbolt, and place it on the table next to Mekkatorque.

:{{text|say|Christy Punchcog|The reactor is locked in.}}
:{{text|yell|Christy Punchcog|Flip! You're up!}}
:{{text|say|Flip Quickcharge|Excellent, I just need a moment to calibrate the circuit.}}
:{{text|say|Flip Quickcharge|Done! Go ahead and flip the switch!}}

Flip the switch over on [[Genny (Mechagon Island)|Genny]].

:{{text|say|Flip Quickcharge|Defibrillate at will!}}

Resuscitate Mekkatorque with the Resuscitation extra button. Nothing seems to happen for a moment...

:{{text|say|Flip Quickcharge|Uh... did it work?}}

Mekkatorque then sits up.

:{{text|say|Flip Quickcharge|It worked!}}
:{{text|say|Gelbin Mekkatorque|Where... where am I?}}
:{{text|say|Gelbin Mekkatorque|What happened? The attack on Dazar'alor...}}
:''Mekkatorque rises from the table and walks down to Erazmin and Kelsey.''
:{{text|say|Gelbin Mekkatorque|You have my sincerest gratitude, Prince Erazmin. As do you, Kelsey. And you, champion.}}
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|We couldn't have done it without the people of Mechagon. And I think I know a way we can repay the favor.}}

Turn in to Erazmin.
