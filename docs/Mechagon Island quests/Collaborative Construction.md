==Objectives==
Find a construction project in [[Mechagon Island|Mechagon]] and help build it.
* Contribute to a construction project

==Description==
Construction projects can be found all over the island. You'll be able to build some of 'em yourself, but you're gonna need help with the bigger projects.

Ask around and see what others are already working on, or just head out on your own and find a project you're interested in.

Construction projects move around and even change day-to-day, so keep an eye out for new ones while you're exploring.

If you're ever curious what construction projects are available on a given day, just ask me!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
Keep an eye out for construction projects. Let me know if you have any questions.

==Completion==
Ah, I remember my first construction project...

<Waren sighs wistfully.>

I wonder where I put that steam-powered pacifier?
