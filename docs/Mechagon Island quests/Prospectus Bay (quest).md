==Objectives==
Jetpack into [[Prospectus Bay]] with [[Gazlowe]] and the crew.
* Grab a [[Goblin Gangplank|jetpack]]

==Description==
Looks like we made it in unnoticed.

[[Skaggit]]'s crew can set up shop on that beach, but we gotta make sure it's safe for 'em to land first.

Let's do a quick flyover to scout out how we're going to crack this place wide open.

That town up on the hill looks promising...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We'll own [[Mechagon Island|this whole island]] in no time.
