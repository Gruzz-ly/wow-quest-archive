==Objectives==
Rescue the [[Rustbolt Resistance]] members.
* Scientists rescued
* [[Tinker]]ers rescued
* [[Engineer]]s rescued

==Description==
[[King Mechagon]] is ruthlessly efficient. He only expends resources to kidnap those he deems worthy.

The rest, he... discards.

<[[Prince Erazmin]] grimaces.>

We will deal with my father, King Mechagon, another day.

This information is more immediately relevant in that my father's predictability means our top scientists, engineers, and tinkerers should all be trapped, alive, somewhere in this depot.

We will find them, and break them out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress and completion==
My father is short-sighted. He judges the worthiness of an individual in its current state. He fails to truly see their potential.

==Notes==

;Tinkerers rescued
:{{Text|yell|[[Pascal]]|Forget about me! They took [[Pascal-K1N6]], the greatest invention of our time!}}
:{{Text|say|Prince Erazmin|Stabilize yourself, Pascal. I will resolve the problem. Return to your workshop for now.}}

;Engineers rescued
:{{Text|say|Prince Erazmin|[[Rustbolt]] is in a state of disarray. Your skills are presently required.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Waren Gearhart]]|Nothing some scrap, energy cells, and elbow grease won't fix.}}
