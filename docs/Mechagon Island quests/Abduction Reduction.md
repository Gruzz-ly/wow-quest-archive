==Objectives==
Free 6 captured [[Mechagon mechagnome|Mechagnomes]] and catch them before they hit the ground.
* Mechagnomes caught safely (6)
* [[Clobberbottom's Boomer]] (provided)

==Description==
We got actual ABDUCTIONS happenin' here, <name>!

Honest to [[gold]], flying [[robot]]s are swoopin' into town and snatchin' up people like it's closin' time at [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]]'s buffet!

Lucky for the [[Rustbolt Resistance]], [[Gazlowe]] called in me and my [[explosive]]s to save the day.

You wanna pitch in? Take one of my [[rocket]] launchers and blast those containment crates outta the sky.

Whatever they've got trapped inside will come tumblin' down real fast, so you gotta run underneath and catch 'em.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

{{Itembox|You will receive one from:|Spare Parts

|Empty Energy Cell

==Progress==
Be sure to run underneath the containment crates after you blast 'em, to catch whatever falls out.

==Completion==
Nice shootin' out there!

And, hey, don't worry if you "accidentally" missed a Mechagnome or two... I did too!

<Penny winks at you.>
