* Craft the [[Sapphronetta Flivvers Action Figure]] at Pascal-K1N6

==Description==
Heya, <name>.

<[[Grizzek Fizzwrench|Grizzek]] leans in close and whispers.>

I'm workin' on a surprise for [[Sapphronetta Flivvers|Saffy]]. Hopin' you can help me out.

I overheard her beggin' [[Jepetto Joybuzz]] to make her into one of his fancy new action figures.

That ol' jerk told her no. Can you believe it? My Punkin!

Well, we don't need him. I reverse engineered a few of his toys and found out what makes them tick.

I got a blueprint ready to go. We can make Saffy's action figure ourselves and surprise her with it!
