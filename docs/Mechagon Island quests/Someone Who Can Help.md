==Objectives==
Help [[Kelsey Steelspark|Kelsey]] move [[Gelbin Mekkatorque|Mekkatorque]]'s Escape Pod to Mechagon.
* [[Homing Copter]] acquired
* [[Mekkatorque's Escape Pod|Escape Pod]] sent to [[Mechagon Island|Mechagon]]
* [[Prince Erazmin]] met
* Speak with Prince Erazmin on Mechagon Island.

==Description==
I believe there is a way to help Mekkatorque, but some may not be a hundred percent on board...

The [[Mechagon mechagnome|mechagnomes]] have advanced techniques in biomechanical repair and improvements.

If there is even a chance they can help him, we have to try! There are some mechagnomes sending supplies out to the island from a dock in [[Hook Point]]. No one will notice one more piece of cargo. We need to reroute one of their [[Gnomish copter|homing copters]].

Will you please help me get Mekkatorque's Pod to Mechagon?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How can I help?

==Completion==
It would be my pleasure to give aid to the most esteemed High Tinker Mekkatorque!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Even if the mechagnomes can't help him, they could power the pod long enough for me to find someone who can.}}

Acquire a [[Homing Copter]] at Hook Point in Boralus, and return it to Mekkatorque's escape pod. The flying claw will grab the pod and then fly off.

: ''Their job done, the tidesages bow and walk off.''
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Perfect! The homing copter will take him directly to Mechagon!}}
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|I... probably should have told Erazmin to expect us. Let's get there ahead of the pod!}}
: ''She runs off to the south.''

Travel to [[Rustbolt]] to meet with Erazmin. Upon completion:
: ''Erazmin runs over to [[Waren Gearhart]] as he speaks.''
:{{text|say|Prince Erazmin|Let us speak to Waren. She will inform us of the materials she requires.}}
