==Objectives==
Show the Rusty Tube to [[Vera Lonelycog]] in [[Rustbolt]] on [[Mechagon Island]].
* [[Rusty Tube (item)]]

==Description==
<The [[Sputtertube|malfunctioning junkbot]] is now a mere heap of metal, its signature tube poking out of the remains.

You remove the tube. The [[Commoner|citizens]] of Rustbolt seem to trade in junk, maybe someone will want it.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Completion==
A tube? A rusty tube. Aw, you shouldn't have!

<Vera laughs and then looks closer at the tube.>

Hold a moment, an 18 unit tube? You're telling me the circumference of this tube is 18 standard units. That's what I'm seeing here with my unit gauge.

Holy manufactured light, that is just perfect for my hair dryer.

You're the best! Well, best tube-finder, at least.
