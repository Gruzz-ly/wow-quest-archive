==Objectives==
Find 1 [[Empty Energy Cell]]s in [[Mechagon Island|Mechagon]].

Then, help build the [[Charging Station]] construction project and use it to charge your Empty Energy Cells.
* Build the Charging Station
* Empty Energy Cells charged at Charging Station (5)

==Description==
The wondrous scuttlebutt around [[Rustbolt|town]] is that the charging station in [[Bondo's Yard]] is going to be repaired today!

That charging station is the best way to recharge all the Empty Energy Cells that've been piling up in your bag. Or in other people's bag. Or inside the [[mechanical]] innards of [[robot]]s you don't own but are legally allowed to destroy.

After you've acquired Empty Energy Cells, help build the charging station in Bondo's Yard and charge all of your Empty Energy Cells!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Empty Energy Cells can always be found on the island, but the Charging Station isn't always available.

Chat with that wondrous Miss Gearhart if you want to know more.

==Completion==
Wondrous! I hope those nasty troggs let you charge up in peace.

They simply do not comprehend technology to any degree. Frankly, I'm embarrassed for them.
