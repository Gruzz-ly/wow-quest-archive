==Objectives==
Scan 10 [[Clockwork Giant]]s.
* Speak with [[Chromie]]
* Memory Banks Scanned (10)
* [[Robotic-Memory Recorder]] (provided)

==Description==
In my travels of the [[Alternate timeline|many possible futures]], I discovered another place much like [[Rustbolt]], but different.

In this other time and place, very little is alive, everything is machines.

You must travel to this other place. You will scan the memory banks of the Clockwork Giants you find there. Then we will use that data to ensure that our Rustbolt never become's, the other place.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

{{Itembox|You will receive:|Spare Parts

==Progress==
You must accomplish this task, for all of our sakes.

==Completion==
With this perhaps we can alter the timeline that would bring us all to this place.

==Notes==
