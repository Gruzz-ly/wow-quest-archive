==Description==
Look at what they've done to this [[Mechagon Island|island]], <name>.

Nature is nearly extinguished, its death cry falling on the deaf ears of [[Mechagon mechagnome|mechagnomes]].

But I have heard the teeny tiny [[animal]]s of Mechagon, and bring aid from afar!

It won't be easy to restore balance to a land so severely wounded. Nature's scars run deep here.

Thankfully, we are not alone. I've brought living sap from Nordrassil, the [[World Tree]] of [[Mount Hyjal]]. Use it to regrow the forests and speed nature's recovery in this land.
