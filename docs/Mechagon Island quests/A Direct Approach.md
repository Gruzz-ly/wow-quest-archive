==Objectives==
Eliminate 12 [[Venture Company|Venture Co]]. employees
* Tech Scavenger slain (12)

==Description==
[[Maokka]] has such a gentle heart. He is so good with the little ones, always playing games and telling stories.

We do however really dislike these Venture Co. individuals, so I suggest a more direct approach.

Try killing them all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
Did you get rid of them all?

==Completion==
You've sent them a message they won't forget.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Tech Scavenger]]s, [[Profit Maker Grifa]], [[Lifting Specialist Gogo]], [[Share Stealer Wonka]], and [[Problem Solver Skitz]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.2.0|note=Added.}}
