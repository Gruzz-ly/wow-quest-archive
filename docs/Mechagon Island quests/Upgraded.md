==Objectives==
Collect 20 Microcogs.
* [[Microcogs]] (20)

==Description==
Well, look at you, <race>...

<Christy's mechanical eyes quickly scan your body.>

Not as impressive as I had hoped.

[[King Mechagon]]'s armies are fully mechanized. But, you... you have a severe excess of flesh and matching machinery deficiency.

Yes, we simply must make a few changes... Maybe a neural-cranial upgrade!

Bring me a few microcogs from the [[motospider]]s nearby and I'll fix you up!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

{{Itembox|You will receive:|Pocket-Sized Computation Device

==Progress==
You must be able to out-think King Mechagon in battle. Get me those parts.

==Completion==
Your first upgrade! Try it out some before we attach it permanently.
