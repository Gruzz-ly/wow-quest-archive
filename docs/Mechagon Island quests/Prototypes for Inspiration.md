==Objectives==
Collect 150 Unfinished Prototypes in [[Mechagon Island|Mechagon]], while in [[War Mode]].
* [[Prototype Implant]] (150)

==Description==
<[[Tinkmaster Overspark|Overspark]] pulls you in close and whispers.>

As the leader of this momentous expedition, I must stay with [[Prince Erazmin]] to ensure he's not swindled by this [[Horde]] hooligan.

But I cannot stop my research, or the Horde will gain the advantage!

Underlings like yourself must collect the technology samples required to fuel my legendary brainstorms.

Bring me prototypes from the island, and I will turn them into groundbreaking new innovations for the [[Alliance]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +200 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
I don't care where you get the prototypes from. Take them from [[Gazlowe]]'s thugs if you have to.

==Completion==
<Tinkmaster flicks through the prototypes you brought.>

Interesting... provocative... inspiring! I can certainly turn these into something useful.

==Patch changes==
