Take the [[fish]] to [[Danielle Anglers]].

* +25 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Completion==
This fish looks to have adapted to survive in the shallow water pools around the trash heaps. It smells awful, the smell probably protects it from any predators. I want to catalogue this and release it before this smell sticks to me!
