==Objectives==
Defeat the scavenging [[trogg]]s and retrieve [[Mekkatorque's Escape Pod]].
* [[Piston Throttlebin|Piston]] and crew activated
* [[Rust-Eye the Clever]] slain
* [[Pod Vehicle|Pod]] retrieved
* Pod delivered
* [[Slappy]] slain

==Description==
One of our [[Rustbolt Defender|defenders]] saw the troggs take out the [[Homing Copter|homing copter]] carrying [[Gelbin Mekkatorque|Mekkatorque]]'s pod.

Since we started bringing goods in from [[Tiragarde Sound|Tiragarde]], they have been a real thorn in our side.

Piston, a very promising young [[Gnomish inventor|inventor]], has a vehicle able to handle this task. Meet his crew down in [[Bondo's Yard|Bondo's yard]].

Please hurry and retrieve the pod! I am not sure what will happen to Gelbin, if they break it open.

Ahem, we would not be upset if you did a little beach clean-up while you were there...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did everyone make it back in one piece?

==Completion==
I hope the poor guy didn't get shaken around too much in there.

==Notes==
Meet [[Piston Throttlebin]] at [[Bondo's Yard]], and he will follow the player with his mechaspider, equipped with a heavy cannon.

Travel to [[Broken Point]] at the southeastern tip of Mechagon, where [[Rust-Eye the Clever]] has been taking pot-shots at incoming copters. He has the same teleport-attack as the [[Upgraded Sentry|Upgraded Sentries]].
:{{text|say|Rust-Eye the Clever|Trogg cave in your skull!}}

Kill Rust-Eye to secure the pod.

: ''Piston loads the pod onto the cockpit of the Cargo Crawler.''
:{{text|say|Piston Throttlebin|We've acquired the pod! Back to Rustbolt!}}

Return to Rustbolt, where Piston will deliver the pod to the platform behind [[Waren Gearhart]]. [[Christy Punchcog]] has joined the group.

:{{text|say|Piston Throttlebin|Task completed! Please contact us again for any vehicular needs!}}

Turn in to Waren. Upon completion:
