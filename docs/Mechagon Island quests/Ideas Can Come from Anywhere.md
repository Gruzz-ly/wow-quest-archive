'''Ideas Can Come from Anywhere''' unlocks once you complete the [[achievement]] [[Junkyard Collector]].

==Objectives==
Find people and things to inspire 1 new ideas in [[Mechagon Island|Mechagon]].
*New ideas inspired

==Description==
I didn't notice the [[tinker]]er's spark in you when we first met.

But look at all of the blueprints you've recovered and uploaded to [[Pascal-K1N6]]'s database.

I was wrong. And happily so, my budding junkyard tinkering apprentice!

But this is a dangerous moment in your creative development.

You must avoid complacency!

Take time off to find new ideas. Speak with builders that inspire you, reverse-engineer bots on the island, and be open to new ideas - no matter where they come from!

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following: [[Brainstorm New Inventions]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
Whenever I run out of ideas, I like to break open a robot and see what's inside!

==Completion==
I see it! The spark of new ideas in your eyes...

You've returned from your travels fresh and ready to brainstorm some blueprints!

I have too. Let's discuss.
