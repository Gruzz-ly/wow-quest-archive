==Objectives==
Eliminate 5 Venture Co. Transports
* [[Venture Co. Transport]] destroyed (5)
* [[BOOM-TASTIC 3000]] (provided)

==Description==
<This box of [[rocket]]s could just be used to take out the [[Venture Company|Venture Co]]. [[Hot air balloon|Balloons]]. That would really motivate Venture Co. to go somewhere else.>

You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]
*[[Spare Parts]]

==Progress==
You'll need to destroy those balloons.

==Completion==
You are a generous one. You did far more than I asked.

==Notes==
As long as [[Waste Not (Mechagon)]] is not active, the Venture Co. Rocket Box will drop from:
* [[Share Stealer Wonka]]
* [[Profit Maker Grifa]]
* [[Problem Solver Skitz]]
* [[Lifting Specialist Gogo]]

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.2.0|note=Added.}}
