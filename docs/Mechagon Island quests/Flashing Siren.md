==Objectives==
Show the Flashing Siren to [[Vera Lonelycog]] in [[Rustbolt]] on [[Mechagon Island]].
* [[Flashing Siren (item)]]

==Description==
<Despite the [[robot]] being destroyed, the [[siren]] continues flashing.

Clearly this was a key sentry of [[King Mechagon]]. The [[Commoner|citizens]] of [[Rustbolt]] will want to know of its demise.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Completion==
Gold trim on the base. This must be from that golden robot patrolling the city outskirts?

Nice hit, that thing has been a pain in our side for as long as I can remember.

Not because it actually catches us--it's terrible at that.

No, the thing wanders into the city in the middle of the night, and looks in our rooms! Just imagine -- you're sound asleep, then the room is lit up bright red, and there's a robot just standing there, looking at you.

It wanders away eventually, but wow, how rude!
