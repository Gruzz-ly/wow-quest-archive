* [[Anodized Sentry Fish]]
* [[Jarmouthed Goby]]
* [[Suction Tube]]

==Description==
There's a huge [[fish]] lurking these waters, and it's been causing lots of problems! 

It eats other fish, [[Fisher|fishermen]], and a lot of expensive gear. I saw it swallow a beautiful [[Zigby 300 Fishing Rod]] along with its owner just the other day!

I've got a plan, but I've lost a lot of my equipment in the waters around here. Can you help fish up some of these items for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
Did you get me the items?

==Completion==
Great work, <name>.  Now I can build the [[Minnow Vac]]!
