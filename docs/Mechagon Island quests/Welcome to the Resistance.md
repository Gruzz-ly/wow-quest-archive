==Objectives==
Tour Rustbolt with Prince Erazmin.
* Tour [[Rustbolt]] with [[Prince Erazmin]]

==Description==
Life in the [[Rustbolt Resistance]] is not easy, <name>.

But it is yours. We will not order you around or force you to fight. [[Mechagon Island|Mechagon]] is a land of endless opportunities, and you may chase whichever opportunities you see fit.

Of course, if you'd like suggestions for which improvements you most require, myself or any of the other [[Mechagon mechagnome|mechagnomes]] in town will be happy to advise you of your current weaknesses.

But, for now, I ask simply that you walk with me to my workshop.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]
*250x [[Spare Parts]]
*3x [[Energy Cell]]

==Completion==
I wonder, what will you choose to do next?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
Follow the prince as he goes around the town.

:{{Text|say|Prince Erazmin|As you can observe, we take pride in our ability to refurbish and repurpose [[technology]].}}
:{{Text|say|Prince Erazmin|However, we also value our organic components. Our emotions and memories, our personalities.}}
:{{Text|say|Prince Erazmin|[[King Mechagon|My father]] does not share that view. He intends to mechanize the entirety of our people, willing or not.}}
:{{Text|say|Prince Erazmin|The choice to install upgrades belongs to each of us. No one can strip us of that autonomy.}}
:{{Text|say|Prince Erazmin|It seems we have an impressive haul today, Christy.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Christy Punchcog]]|Yes, sir. Their tech is improving. We can hardly keep up.}}
:{{Text|emote|Prince Erazmin looks at the fully [[Prototype Sentry|mechanized Sentry]] and sighs.}}
:{{Text|say|Prince Erazmin|The extent of this mechanization... is there even a [[gnome]] left in there?}}
:{{Text|say|Christy Punchcog|I have yet to determine that. King Mechagon has converted over 99 percent of their physical composition.}}
:{{Text|say|Prince Erazmin|We will stop him. We must stop him.}}
:{{Text|say|Prince Erazmin|Most of the resistance still have family and friends within [[Mechagon City|Mechagon]].}}
:{{Text|say|Prince Erazmin|We fight not only for our own freedom, but for theirs as well.}}
:{{Text|say|Prince Erazmin|If my father succeeds, then all of us will end up like that machine on the wall.}}
:{{Text|say|Prince Erazmin|He'd erase everything that makes us who we are. We cannot allow that to happen.}}
:{{Text|say|Prince Erazmin|Thank you for your assistance. But there remains much more to do.}}

If you wish to skip this tour, you can simply ask Erazmin to do so.
:Oh, you have a question?
{{Gossip|I don't need a tour of the city.}}

;On completion
:{{Text|say|Prince Erazmin|Explore Rustbolt and acquaint yourself with the resistance.}}
:{{Text|say|Prince Erazmin|There's always something in progress on this island.}}

Finishing this quest unlocks various normal and daily quests across Rustbolt and beyond, including [[Prototypes for Profit]] / [[Prototypes for Inspiration]], [[Junkyard Tinkering and You]], [[Upgraded]], and [[Fishing For Something Bigger]].
