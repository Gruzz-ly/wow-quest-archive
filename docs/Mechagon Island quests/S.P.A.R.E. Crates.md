==Objectives==
Craft $1oa Junkyard Tinkering items with [[Pascal-K1N6]].

==Description==
I'm sure you agree that Pascal-K1N6 is the greatest invention you've ever seen!

If you're not convinced yet, try to push him to his limits. I don't mind!

Bring him more resources and blueprints -- he'll craft anything you need!

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Upload: S.P.A.R.E. Crate]]
You will also receive:
* +25 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Completion==
Look at all those spare parts you've got in those bags! You're starting to look like a real junkyard [[tinker]]er.

Let me give you a tip, though. Only amateurs carry 'em around all helter skelter like that.

Real experts keep 'em organized efficiently, so we can carry more.

Here, I'll show you how.
