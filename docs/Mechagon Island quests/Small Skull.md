==Objectives==
Show the Small Skull to [[Vera Lonelycog]] in [[Rustbolt]] on [[Mechagon Island]].
* [[Small Skull (item)]]

==Description==
<Inside of the gelatinous remains of the slime you find a small [[skeleton]].

Someone in Rustbolt might be missing. 

You pick up the skull, it might still be able to be identified.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Completion==
Another one? Don't worry, there's no tragedy behind this skull. It's not real.

When we first started finding the skeletons, we feared the worst. Our [[child]]ren getting lost in the wastes and devoured!

But no, the kids are safe.

It's him, he's tormenting us. [[King Mechagon]]. Heard he has some new [[technology]], calling it "thrice die mentioned smithing." Lets him make whatever he wants.

And he chooses to make fake baby skeletons.

<Vera shakes her head.>

Just toss it in the grinder with the rest.
