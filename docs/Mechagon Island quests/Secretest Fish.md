==Objectives==
Take the fish to [[Danielle Anglers]] in [[Mechagon Island|Mechagon]].
* [[Secretest Fish (item)]]

==Description==
<Danielle Anglers in Mechagon may be interested in this fish.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*20 [[Secret Fish Lure]]
* {{cost|70|20}}
* 11,600 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Completion==
Where did you find this fish? It opens up many new possibilities for fish research!

With just a little adjustment, I can modify a rudimentary lure, adapting it to attract more fish than ever!

Of course it might just attract more fishermen instead! 

==Notes and trivia==
*During ''Shadowlands'' development, it was a daily quest.
*This quest reuses an unused Stormsong Valley quest from [[patch 8.0.1]].
