==Objectives==
Wait for the Alliance to leave the vault.
* Hide behind the [[Fake Rock]]
* Spy on the [[Alliance]]

==Description==
Bad news. We're late.

The Alliance was already crawling all over the vault when we got here.

Lucky for us, some big commotion inside sent some of 'em running for the hills.

Most of 'em are still down in that vault, though, including that crazy braggart [[Tinkmaster Overspark]].

Let's give 'em a few more minutes to clear out, so we don't have to go in guns blazing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What'd they find down there?

==Completion==
Told you that Overspark was a chump.

A boss has gotta respect his crew, or they won't respect him.
