==Description==
The legs and shocks on this mount are shot! We'll need some new ones if we're going to get this mount crawling.

A few weeks ago, [[Bondo Bigblock|Bondo]] and [[Pistonheads|his gang]] rode into the [[Scrapbone Den]] hoping to scare the [[Trogg]]s off. The Troggs tore their crawlers apart! The parts for those crawlers are still laying all around Scrapbine{{sic}} Den.

See if you can get us some of those parts from the Troggs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Progress==
We need those legs.

==Completion==
These parts will get us closer to being able to ride this thing!
