==Objectives==
Brawl with [[Grumbol Grimhammer]]'s forces on [[Mechagon Island|Mechagon]].
* [[Grumbol's Hammers]] defeated

==Description==
[[Gazlowe]] hired you for protection too? I guess it's true that he only hires the best, eh? Ha!

Pay's great, but the rules are dung: no fightin' in [[Rustbolt|town]], no exceptions. Bah!

<Usha takes a big gulp of her drink.>

That [[Prince Erazmin|tiny tender prince]] won't give us his [[Technology|tech]] unless he thinks we're good little [[angel]]s... Ha!

But Gazlowe didn't say nothin' about fightin' outside of town.

I got my own [[Usha's Eyegougers|squad]] on the outskirts, ready to brawl with Grumbol's guzzlers if they show their bearded faces.

You want in?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

{{Itembox|You will receive:|Spare Parts

==Progress==
Grumbol's gutter guzzlers... Ha!

==Completion==
Ha ha ha! Look at Grumbol's stupid face!

He can't believe it! Ha ha ha! Pathetic!
