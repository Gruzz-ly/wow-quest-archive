==Objectives==
Show the Mechanical Eye to [[Vera Lonelycog]] in [[Rustbolt]] on [[Mechagon Island]].
* [[Mechanical Eye (item)]]

==Description==
<As the mechanical body of [[Unit 17]] crumples into a heap, one eye lights up.

You hear a popping noise, and the eye flies from the head, aided by a small explosion.

You pick up the eye and notice it twitch a few times, then power down.

The [[Commoner|citizens]] of [[Rustbolt]] seem to like junk, maybe they'll be interested in this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

==Completion==
You retrieved this from a [[Mechanical squirrel|mechanical marmot]]? It must have been that one with the smoke-colored metal.

Did I ever tell you my story about that sinister Unit 17?

So there I was, browsing the scrap heap for junk, like you do. Suddenly, it's right in front of me -- Unit 17. 

I froze. Did it see me? What would it do? I took one step backwards, it twitched, I yelped.

Then it blared at me in a tone I will never forget.

"Error 74."

I ran back as fast as my legs could take me.

<Vera shudders.>
