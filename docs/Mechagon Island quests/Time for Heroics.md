==Objectives==
[[Leona Mistcaller]], Dunkin Crackjaw, and Adalin Halfheight rescued.
* Leaona{{sic}} Mistcaller rescued
* [[Dunkin Crackjaw]] rescued
* [[Adalin Halfheight]] rescued

==Description==
That card you found was a {{HS|Golden card|gold}} {{HS|Rarity#Rare|rare}} [[Huolon]]!

I think that card belonged to Adalin Halfheight, one of our junior [[Explorers' League|explorer league]] members. If he dropped it, he and our other junior members maybe in trouble!

We need to find Leona Mistcaller, Dunkin Crackjaw, and Adalin Halfheight immediately!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

{{Itembox|You will receive:|Spare Parts
|Energy Cell
|Empty Energy Cell
}}

==Progress==
Let's find these people!

==Completion==
You certainly are the hero they all talk about!

==Notes==
;Leona Mistcaller
A Slime Elemental attacked us, and we all got separated.

I was headed back to Rustbolt for help, but became trapped here!

{{Gossip|You are safe now.}}

;Adalin Halfheight
The slimes attacked us and my pack broke. My cards were scattered everywhere!

There's a slime up the hill that ate some of my cards. I'm not leaving till I get those back!

{{Gossip|I will take care of it.}}
:''[[Deck 'Em]] becomes available.''

;Dunkin Crackjaw
Don't worry about me, I joined the Explorer's League for the action!

Find the others. They need your help more!

{{Gossip|I'll see they are safe.}}
