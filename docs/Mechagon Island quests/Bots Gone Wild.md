==Objectives==
Whirling Zap-O-Matic slain
*[[Whirling Zap-O-Matic]] slain

==Description==
It's loose up there!

I told them not to do it, but they didn't listen. Now it's gone out of control and killed everyone up there. It's an experimental [[Gnomebot|Whirlbot]], they never should have built it!

You need to stop it before it comes down here looking for more victims!

Kill the Whirling Zap-O-Matic.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Rustbolt Resistance]]

{{Itembox|You will receive:|Spare Parts

==Progress==
You need to stop it.

==Completion==
You performed better than those that build the bot.

==Patch changes==
