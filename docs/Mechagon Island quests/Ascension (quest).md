==Objectives==
Clear the remaining Mechagon defenders.
* Take [[Mechagon City Teleporter|teleporter]] to [[Mechagon City]]
* [[Blastatron X-81]] slain
* Speak with Gelbin Mekkatorque.

==Description==
After everything the [[Mechagon mechagnome|mechagnomes]] have done for us today, it is our duty to return the favor.

Let us clear out the rogue creations that remain in Mechagon.

With their home returned, [[Prince Erazmin]] and his people will have a brilliant path forward.

With this team, we will make short work of the remaining [[King Mechagon]] [[Arcforged|loyalists]].

Let me know when you are ready to roll out!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
That was exciting!

The world just got a little bigger, my friend!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Prince Erazmin|Many rogue bots still roam the city. Any assistance you can provide toward their removal would be most appreciated.}}
: ''Gelbin, Erazmin, and Kelsey run for the teleporter.''
:{{text|say|Gelbin Mekkatorque|Well then, let's recycle some scrap!}}

Walk over to the nearby path out of Rustbolt (looking towards the ''[[Greasy Eel]]'' in [[Prospectus Bay]]), where a teleporter into [[Mechagon City]] awaits. Step onto it, and you will be teleported into the Under Junk of Mechagon City, just past where you would fight [[K.U.-J.0.]]. You are joined by Erazmin, Mekkatorque, and [[Kelsey Steelspark]].

:{{text|say|Gelbin Mekkatorque|We'll make quick work of this lot.}}
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Ready when you are.}}

Proceed forward into Mechagon City, which is patrolled by [[Mechagon Trooper]]s, [[Alarm-o-Bot (Operation: Mechagon)|Alarm-o-Bots]], and [[Defense Bot Mk I]]s. Proceed to the [[Machinist's Garden]] to fight the [[Blastatron X-81]].

:{{text|say|Blastatron X-81|You will be exterminated.}}
:{{text|say|Blastatron X-81|Resistance is futile.}}

Upon defeating it, turn in to Mekkatorque.
