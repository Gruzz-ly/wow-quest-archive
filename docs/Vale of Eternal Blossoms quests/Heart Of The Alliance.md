==Objectives==
Confront 6 Sha-Touched Footmen.
*[[Sha-Touched Footman]] saved (6)

==Description==
I can't believe this has happened, <name>. After all we have been through here on [[Pandaria]], will our people never learn from their past mistakes?

[[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann's]] expedition returned recently from [[Mogujia]], bearing a sample of [[sha]] for study.

I had my reservations about this endeavor in the first place, and my worst fears have been realized.

The sha has escaped containment. I do not need to explain the horror of bringing the sha into the heart of the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms|Vale]].

We must dispel any sha we can find, and quickly!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 XP
*+500 reputation with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]
*+500 reputation with [[Alliance]]

==Progress==
We must protect this land, and our people, from the sha's influence.

==Completion==
I see that you and my son have been hard at work. Thank you for taking the initiative to aid our cause here in the Vale.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Be ready for anything, <name>. We may have to use force against our own men.}}

Look around for {{NPC||Sha-Touched Footman||sha-touched footmen}} and interact with them. They will turn hostile. Watch out for their Devastation ability! Defeat six, then return to King Varian as Anduin teleports away:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I knew you were the right one for this task, <class>. Meet me back upstairs when you are finished here.}}

On entering the [[Imperial Exchange]]:
:{{text|say|Stormwind Royal Guard|All hail the King of [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilneas]], [[Genn Greymane]]!}}
:{{text|say|Stormwind Royal Guard|From the faraway boroughs of tranquil [[Darnassus]], [[Tyrande Whisperwind|High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind]] arrives!}}
:{{text|say|Stormwind Royal Guard|Representing the [[draenei]], the wise and noble [[Farseer Nobundo]] from the [[Exodar]]!}}
:{{text|say|Stormwind Royal Guard|From the flying city of [[Dalaran]], the leader of the [[Kirin Tor]], [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lady Jaina Proudmoore]]!}}
:''The aforrementioned NPCs all enter from their respective portals as they're announced and approach Varian, Anduin, Brann, Rogers, and Overspark.''

Speak with Varian to complete the quest and the "Heart of the Alliance" portion of [[Operation: Shieldwall Campaign]]. A script event begins on completion:
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|I see.  So it was this... sha... that caused such violent behavior in our troops?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Yes, father.  I encountered sha energy in my travels.  At its full power it is terrible to behold.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian|We Alliance have rallied to defeat many enemies, my son.  The sha will fall to us, just like any other.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|This isn't the same, father.  The sha cannot simply be defeated.  It feeds on our inner-most weaknesses.  It twists our thoughts.  Don't underestimate it!}}
:''An [[Echo of Hatred]] forms from the Sha-touched Claw.''
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Yer Majesty!  Look!}}
:''Jaina immediately casts [[Frost Nova]] to freeze it in place.''
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|By the light, is that a sha?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Yes.  Don't go near it!}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|I sense great darkness emanating from this... thing.  Destroy it, now!}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Nobundo|I agree.  Only suffering can come of such a creature.}}
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Your Highness, we should study it.  Weaponize it!  The Horde already outnumber us here on Pandaria.  We need to gain every possible advantage.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|It couldn't hurt to study it.  'Tho I don't much care for the way it's lookin' at me.}}
:{{text|say|Tinkmaster Overspark|Yes, yes!  Very interesting!  Perhaps I could distill it into a new power source?}}
:{{text|say|Sky Admiral Rogers|Garrosh is using every weapon he can lay his hands on.  Shouldn't we level the playing field?}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|What do you think, Anduin?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Garrosh's example is not one that I care to follow.  The Alliance should make its own decisions.  The RIGHT decisions.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|It is true, it may be possible to someday harness the sha into a weapon.  But we risk destroying our own people in the process.  That is not a price I am willing to pay.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|Well said, my son.}}
:{{text|say|King Varian Wrynn|This power is too dangerous.  I will have none of it!}}
:''Varian destroys it with a mighty strike from [[Shalamayne]].''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|<Name>, thank you for helping me today.  I knew we could convince my father of the right course.  Please, go back to your other duties for now.}}
