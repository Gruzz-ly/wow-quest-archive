After retrieving various pieces of lore on the [[Isle of Thunder]], Lorewalker Cho is at last able to piece together the origin of the [[Mogu]]. 

==Objectives==
Bring the Gods and Monsters to [[Lorewalker Cho]].
*[[Gods and Monsters (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
Dear <name>,

Is it true that the [[mogu]] are really connected to the [[titans]]? I find this very hard to believe. But looking over your research, some of the truth about the mogu begins to take shape.

If you visit us at the [[Seat of Knowledge]] in [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]] we can add this contribution to your personal collection.

Thank you for your diligence!

Sincerely,

Lorewalker Cho

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
* 236000 XP
* +2850 reputation with [[The Lorewalkers]]

==Completion==
Your research is most distressing. But it sheds light on a truth we have long sought: "Where did the mogu come from? And why were they such tyrants?"

We will add this knowledge to your collection. If you wish me to narrate this for you, simply point at the correct volume in your Private Collection.

==Notes==
Upon completion of the [[Gods and Monsters]] Pandaria exploration achievement, [[Lorewalker Cho]] sends a letter via the in-game mail system. The letter has an item attached that starts this quest. see the achievement for more details.
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Fathers and sons. Mothers and daughters. As parents, we pass our legacy to our children.}}
:''Cho walks over to an image of [[Varian Wrynn|Varian]] and [[Anduin Wrynn]].''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|What values do we choose to instill in our progeny?}}
:''He walks past an image of [[Deathwing]] in human form and [[Wrathion]].''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|What will our children learn from our mistakes?}}
:''He walks past [[Thrall]], [[Aggra]], a baby orc in a cradle, and a banner of the [[Frostwolf clan]].''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|What sort of world will we create and leave behind for our daughters and sons?}}
:''The previous images fade as Cho walks past [[Terenas Menethil II]] and [[Arthas Menethil]], as Arthas gains in stages the armor of the Lich King and the [[Helm of Domination]].''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Parents place their children on a path, but they do not always know where the road will take them.}}
:''Shadows of titans, [[Eonar|one female]], [[Khaz'goroth|one with a hammer]], and a tall unarmed one, appear along the back wall.''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The [[mogu]] were children as well. Children of the [[titans]]. They were once a legion of stone, heartless and obedient.}}
:''Pre-Curse of Flesh mogu appear and start fighting off mantid.''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|By the titans' command, they fought the terrible servants of the [[old gods]]. They shaped the mountains and carved the rivers of the land.}}
:''Golden trees appear on either side.''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|And they created a magical cradle of life in a hidden valley that we now call the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].}}
:''The shadows of the titans disappear as the mogu grow smaller and weaker.''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|But eventually the titans fell silent. And their creations were [[Curse of Flesh|cursed with flesh]].}}
:''Lei Shen appears.''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The mogu grew restless. Many generations later, when the [[Lei Shen|Thunder King]] united them, they seized upon their legacy!}}
:''[[Quilen]] and [[terracotta warrior]]s appear on the left side, as several classes of saurok appear behind Cho.''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|I truly believe now that the mogu thought they were doing the work of the titans. They fought against the [[mantid]] and used the [[Saurok|powers of the Vale to create new life]].}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Ah, but such terrible works!}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Parents cannot always be assured of the legacy they will leave behind.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|How especially true this is, when the parents are gods. And their children - monsters.}}
