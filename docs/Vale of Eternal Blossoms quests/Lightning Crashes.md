Destroy 6 Lightning Rods in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].

==Description==
The [[Zan-Tien]] like to claim mastery over the power of storms, yet they resort to machines to harness lightning from the sky.

Show these pretenders that the true power of storm and thunder comes from within. Break their toys, and see how they fare without.

You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
*250 [[Coalescing Visions]]
*50 [[War Resources]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
Hah! Let's see how these so-called "masters of storm" fare without their precious contraptions!

This should be entertaining.
