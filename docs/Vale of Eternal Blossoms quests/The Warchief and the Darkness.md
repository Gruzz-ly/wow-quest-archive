==Objectives==

*"The Dark Heart of Pandaria" scenario complete

==Description==
I see now how the [[Varian Wrynn|Alliance King]] leads his people. But what is the [[Garrosh Hellscream|Horde Warchief]] up to? Just below us, a swarm of [[goblin]]s is burrowing into the sacred [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms|Vale]] on his orders. What does he hope to find there? We must find out!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Greater Cache of Treasures]]
*{{cost|45|60}}
*471000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It is not my place to make stories. I simply tell them.

==Completion==
Whaaaat? The remains of an [[Old God]] are buried beneath Pandaria? No wonder the land is so haunted!

The warchief's pursuit of those dormant powers is fraying apart the very Horde he leads. His vision is narrow, but very, very dangerous. I must inform the [[Shado-Pan]] immediately.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The High King, his champions, and the Dark Iron dwarves worked together to save Ironforge.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The other dwarven leaders were ashamed of their behavior, and vowed never again to allow fear or distrust to cloud their judgment.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|And so it was a human king who helped to unite the dwarven clans so long divided.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Free to trust one another, all three dwarven leaders pledged their full strength to the Alliance cause.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Meanwhile, in the city of Orgrimmar, Warchief Garrosh Hellscream sent goblin dig teams all across the continent of Pandaria.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|He promised gold and riches to any who could discover for him the hidden secrets of this land that fill Pandaria with such a dark and powerful energy.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|To my surprise, his people have found something! Right here, in the sacred vale! What will happen now?}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The story is still being written...}}
As before, use the [[Dungeon Finder]] interface, or interact with [[Lorewalker Cho's Dream Brew]] on the table at the base of the steps to queue for the [[Dark Heart of Pandaria]] scenario. See the scenario article for a walkthrough.

:''The below conversation took place during 5.3.0 till 5.4.0:''
If the player travels to the [[Golden Terrace]] of the [[Shrine of Two Moons]], [[Sunwalker Dezco]] and [[Taran Zhu]] can be seen having this dialogue:
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Tauren! What have your people done? You have dredged open a scar within our sacred Vale!}}
:{{text|say|Sunwalker Dezco|Lord Zhu, please understand - the orc "Warchief" who ordered the deed no longer speaks for the whole of the Horde. Many voices are rising up against him.}}
:''Taran Zhu turns to walk away from Dezco.''
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Your politics are no concern of mine. Your Horde has disrespected the sanctity of this place. You are no longer welcome here - leave at once!}}
:''Dezco chases after Taran Zhu.''
:{{text|say|Sunwalker Dezco|Give us time, Lord Zhu. Give us the opportunity to bring Hellscream to justice.}}
:''Taran Zhu turns to face Dezco.''
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Sunwalker, I respect your people. You have aided us in our campaign against the Sha and the Thunder King. Otherwise, I would have already ordered the Shado-Pan to purge this entire shrine. But my patience is at an end. The Horde must leave.}}
:{{text|say|Sunwalker Dezco|Please. Give us time to make this right.}}
:{{text|emote|Taran Zhu stares grimly into the distance.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Very well. You have until season's end. No longer.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|We pandaren are no strangers to dealing with tyrants. The coming battle will try your souls. May the celestials guide your actions.}}
:''Taran Zhu leaves.''

This completes "The Lorewalker's Counsel" portion of [[Darkspear Revolutionary]] / [[Hordebreaker]].
