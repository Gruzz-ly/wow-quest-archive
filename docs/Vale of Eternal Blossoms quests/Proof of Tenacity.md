==Objectives==
Obtain a Conqueror's Trophy from the [[Commander (rank)|commander]] of an Assault in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Conqueror's Trophy]]

==Description==
If the [[Ra|Highkeeper]] is so convinced that we don't stand a chance against our enemies, perhaps a show of force would sway him.

I am not sure how you would manage, but if you could bring proof of a victory against those who threaten the Vale, it may convince him that action should be taken.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* Choice of Azerite armor
**{{ClassIcon|Rogue}} [[Vest of the Insatiable Maw]], [[Visage of the Insatiable Maw]], or [[Mantle of the Insatiable Maw]]
* [[Radiant Azerite Matrix]] (1,500 [[Azerite (resource)]])
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Rajani]]

==Progress==
What is it this time?

==Completion==
So, you've managed to defeat one of the Vale's would-be conquerors? A notable feat, but [[Azeroth]]'s enemies are innumerable.

The [[Burning Legion]], the [[Old God]]s, the [[Void]]... sooner or later the scales will tip against this world.

...but I have been mistaken before.

==Notes==
Accepting the quest starts a Vale assault. Several daily quests are also available, which are useful to fill the bar but are optional.

As in Uldum, don't just kill normal mobs. Scour the area for marks on the minimap and quest objectives. The commander will be listed on the minimap after filling the 100% progress bar.

;Description
I am not sure how you would manage, but if you could bring proof of a victory against this evil he speaks of, it may convince him that action should be taken.
