==Objectives==
Collect 100 Anima Globule from [[Dokani clan|Dokani]] [[mogu]] and their allies in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Anima Globule]] (100)

==Description==
The Dokani see themselves fit to wield the ancient [[magic]] of [[Anima (blood fluid)|anima]], but their [[golem]]s and manifestations are but a fraction of anima's true power.

Liberate them of their prized substance, so that the [[Rajani]] may put it to better use.

You will receive:
* {{cost|201|59|}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What do you bring?

==Completion==
This will do.

Go now. I am sure you are needed elsewhere.
