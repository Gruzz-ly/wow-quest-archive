== Objectives ==
Complete the "[[Blood in the Snow]]" scenario. You can queue from the dungeon finder or use [[Lorewalker Cho's Dream Brew]].
*"Blood in the Snow" scenario complete

== Description ==
I am glad you are here, <name>. I have been using my dream brew to experience events around the world, but the more I learn, the more confused I become.

For instance, [[Varian Wrynn|King Wrynn]] has asked the [[dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Ironforge]] for more troops, but they do not all support him.

I will tell you more, but I would also like to hear from your experience firsthand...

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|45|60}}
* 471000 [[XP]]
*[[Greater Cache of Treasures]]

== Progress ==
It is not my place to make stories. I simply tell them.

== Completion ==
So, King Wrynn and the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron dwarves]] saved the city, and bitterly divided [[Council of Three Hammers]] gained a new unity under the Alliance banner. How interesting!

But what is happening within the Horde?

As a breadcrumb to start this quest, [[Lorewalker Cho]] sends a letter via the in-game mail system:
{{book|Please See Me in the Vale!|content=Friend!

&nbsp;&nbsp;My humble land has become the center of a worldwide storm.  Events are moving very quickly between the Alliance and the Horde.  Can you help me make sense of it all?  Please visit me at the [[Seat of Knowledge]] in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]], above the entrance to [[Mogu'shan Palace]].  We must speak!

&nbsp;&nbsp;Your friend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorewalker Cho}}

Get there and speak with him to start this quest. On accept, Cho begins a story:
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Once upon a time - moments ago, in fact - a great [[Varian Wrynn|King]] sought the help from a trio of powerful [[dwarf|dwarves]]: The [[Council of Three Hammers]].}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The King's [[SI:7|scouts]] had discovered that [[Zandalar tribe|Zandalari trolls]] threatened the [[Ironforge|dwarven capital]].}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Surely, the king thought, if he helped them with their [[troll]] problem, they would give him more troops for his campaign against the [[Horde]].}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|But what the King did not realize is that the dwarves did not trust one another!}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|"We cannot help you," said the [[Muradin Bronzebeard|Bronzebeard dwarf]], "For if we turn our back on the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Irons]], they will defeat the [[Wildhammer clan|Wildhammer]] and take over Ironforge!"}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|"We cannot help you," said the [[Kurdran Wildhammer|Wildhammer dwarf]]. "For if we turn our back on the Dark Irons, they will defeat the [[Bronzebeard clan|Bronzebeard]] and take over Ironforge!"}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The King was furious. "If none of you help, then Ironforge will fall under siege!"}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Only one dwarf offered to help the King. "We will lend you our strength," said [[Moira Thaurissan|Moira]], of the Dark Iron. "We will trust our dwarven brothers and we will show them what loyalty means!"}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|And so Moira and the High King set out in the snow to save the city, leaving the others to think about their actions.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|What happens next? I must know!}}
Use the [[Dungeon Finder]] interface or [[Lorewalker Cho's Dream Brew]] on the table at the base of the steps to queue for the [[Blood in the Snow]] scenario. See the scenario's article for a walkthrough.
