==Objectives==
Burn 6 [[Zara'thik]] Banners within the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Vil'thik Banner]] destroyed (6)

==Description==
The brazen [[mantid]] think they've already won. Even now, they fly [[banner]]s along the [[Serpent's Spine]], announcing their dominance.

They must learn that [[Pandaria]] belongs to the [[pandaren]].

Burn their banners down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
* 380 [[Azerite (resource)]]
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The mantid have no place here.

==Completion==
Their marks have been erased from the Vale. Soon, so will their forces.

I hope to fight by your side when we finally drive them back over the Serpent's Spine.
