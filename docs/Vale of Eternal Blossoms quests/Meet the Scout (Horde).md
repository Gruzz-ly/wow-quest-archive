==Objectives==
Speak with [[Scout Rokla]] at the [[Horde Landing Site]] in [[Krasarang Wilds]].

==Description==
It has been two months since the parting of the mists. Horde scouts, seeking a suitable landing site for the fleet, have engaged Alliance forces on a small island off the coast of Krasarang Wilds.

Meet with Scout Rokla and help secure the landing site.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|70}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]

==Completion==
You are just in time. [[Garrosh Hellscream|The Warchief]] is about to land. Once this site passes his inspection, the fleet will follow.

==Notes==
This quest begins the Horde Pandaren campaign. Offered automatically after logging in, head to southwestern [[Krasarang Wilds]]. [[Dawnchaser Retreat]] is the nearest flight path.

Speak with Rokla to turn in, which starts a short script event:
:{{text|yell|Garrosh Hellscream|Here! Stop the boats here.}}
:''Garrosh jumps off the boat that he arrived in.''
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|This island will make a perfect coastal stronghold. Rokla! When the peons arrive, clear these trees and begin construction of the docks.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Champion, you have been here for many weeks, and know this land well. Come with me.}}
Speak with Garrosh to continue.

This quest's name may be a reference to "Meet the Scout," an animated short in ''{{wp|Team Fortress 2}}''<nowiki/>'s "Meet the Team" series of shorts.
