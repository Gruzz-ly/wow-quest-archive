==Objectives==
Rescue 6 [[Captured Pandaren|captive pandaren]] in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Torment Cell|Captive pandaren]] freed (6)

==Description==
[[N'Zoth]]'s forces struck the vale suddenly. By the time I and my [[Shado-Pan]] arrived, many of the [[Golden Lotus]] had already been taken captive by the [[Old God]]'s forces.

Even with our combined might, we have only been able to hold off the invaders from taking more of our people. Those already taken, however, are still within the clutches of the Old God.

I know we have had our differences, <name>, but if you could aid us in their recovery, the Shado-Pan would be in your debt.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|198|2}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Any news of the captives?

==Completion==
I do not wish to dwell upon the fate that would have otherwise befell those you rescued.

You are a true champion of pandaria, <class>.
