'''Testing the Untested''' is a daily quest available during the [[mantid]] swarm [[assaults]].

==Objectives==
Kill 12 [[Vil'thik]] Swarmborn in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Vil'thik Swarmborn]] slain (12)

==Description==
During a swarm, the [[mantid]] send their youngest in great numbers against the enemy to test their mettle. Those who survive join the swarm as true [[warrior]]s of the mantid.

We should do our best to ensure that they don't make it through this test.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

You will also receive one or two from:
*349 [[Azerite (resource)]]
*250 [[Coalescing Visions]]
*70 [[War Resources]]
*65 [[War Resources]]

==Progress==
Have you culled the Swarmborn?

==Completion==
The mantid are foolish to send such untested creatures against a well-prepared foe.

May this be a lesson they never learn.

==Patch changes==
