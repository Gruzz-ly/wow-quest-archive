==Objectives==
Kill 10 fleshbeasts in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Fleshbeast]] slain  (10)

==Description==
To see the Vale of Eternal Blossoms recover from the [[Sha]] to its former beauty, only to see it tainted by the [[Old God]]s once more, it makes the blood boil!

We must root out the Old God's corruption before it can take hold of this land again. I have seen the fleshbeasts that accompany [[N'Zoth]]'s forces spreading his corruption where they tread.

Make sure they tread no longer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I will not see the Vale fall again!

==Completion==
You have done well.

We must not let N'Zoth take hold of this land!

==Notes==
*Kill [[Living Infestation]]s and [[Escaped Mutation]]s.
