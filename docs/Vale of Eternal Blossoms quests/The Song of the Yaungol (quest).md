Upon completion of the [[The Song of the Yaungol]] Pandaria [[exploration achievement]], [[Lorewalker Cho]] sends a letter via the in-game mail system. The letter has an item attached that starts this quest. See the achievement for more details.
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Fire! It is the most magical of elements. It warms us, it cooks our food. It is the hearthfire that makes a house a home. In the right hands, fire can shape iron into swords or plowshares. Left uncontrolled, fire could destroy a city.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Fire is the instrument of change.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Long ago, a group of sturdy nomad hunters wandered the world. By a stroke of fate, they were here in [[Pandaria]] when [[the Sundering]] split apart the continents of [[Azeroth]]. The wanders found themselves trapped in the [[Townlong Steppes]], a harsh and dangerous land.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Those noble hunters found a way to survive on their own. Fire was the key. They drew up oil from the ground. They used it to heat their homes, cook their food, and burn their enemies. They grew STRONG.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|From the flames of fate, the [[yaungol]] were born. They survive beyond the wall, for they refuse to submit to any law but their own.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Has fate been cruel to the yaungol? You may as well ask if fire is good or bad.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Fate is like fire; it can shape or destroy us.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|All that matters is what you do with it.}}
