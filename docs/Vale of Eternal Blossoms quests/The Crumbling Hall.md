==Description==
An ancient mogu artifact has been uncovered in the [[Guo-Lai Vault]], beyond the [[Hall of Statues]]. We've made repeated attempts to retrieve it, but none have been successful.

We cannot let this artifact fall into the hands of the Shao-Tien. I need someone capable to retrieve it, and quickly.

Are you in?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|72|lcgf=2}}
*294000 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Golden Lotus]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered the artifact yet?

==Completion==
When everyone else lets me down, you follow through. That's why I like you.

Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
Fly into the [[Guo-Lai Halls]] and take a left at the bottom of the ramp to enter the [[Hall of Statues]]. There are [[Shao-Tien]] mobs milling about the area. Additionally, the "Jade" Guardians standing in the room will activate if anyone gets too close. They have ~500,000 health and hit quite hard, but move rather slowly.

After a forced right turn, the next room has two nooks to the left and right and a path heading straight forward. Head north and round the next corner to enter the [[Guo-Lai Vault]] and the tile room. Note that the fire tiles are safe this time. The deactivation orb varies in its placement; sometimes it's in the center of the room. Other times, it can be found in a corner.

===Patch 5.4===
The [[mogu]] have invaded the Vale in even greater numbers. This has resulted in many mogu mobs being located where once there were few. Because of the change, it's much more important now to bring along a friend if you are working towards the achievement [[One Step at a Time]].
