==Objectives==
Collect [[Stoneshaper Rod]]s from [[Baruk Stoneshaper]]s and use them to free 5 Petrified Warriors in the [[Ruins of Guo-Lai]].
* [[Petrified Warrior]] freed (5)

==Description==
Some of our [[warrior]]s were camped in the small settlement near Guo-Lai when the [[Baruk clan|Baruk]] invaded the area. Some managed to escape, but they returned with tales of their brothers and sisters in arms being petrified by the [[mogu]] stoneshapers into living statues!

We can't leave our warriors behind!

The stoneshapers must carry some means to reverse the spell and free them from their stone prisons. Bring our soldiers back!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you managed to free our warriors?

==Completion==
Your deeds honor us, <name>.

I can't imagine what fate would've befallen our warriors if left to the Baruk.
