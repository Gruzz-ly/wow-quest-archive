==Objectives==
Solve 1 artifact from Pandaria.
*Artifact of Pandaria Solved

==Description==
Interested in being a Lorewalker? There is lots of digging and reading and digging and more reading.

I have entire days where I stare at a broken vase trying to figure out how it goes back together.

Should give it a try. Go solve one artifact of Pandaria and we will appreciate you sharing the knowledge of how you did it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}
*236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I am beginning to wonder if I'll ever get the hang of this stuff.

==Completion==
Wow! You got the pieces to meld together so well. The quality of this restoration is amazing.

How did you do it?

==Notes==
Nothing to it—collect enough fragments+keystones to solve any artifact, and do so after accepting this quest, then turn back in.

==Progression==
