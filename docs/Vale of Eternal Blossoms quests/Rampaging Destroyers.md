==Objectives==
Kill 4 Kunchong Destroyers in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Kunchong]] Destroyer slain (4)
* Suggested players: 3

==Description==
The last [[mantid]] swarm is still very fresh in the memory of the [[Golden Lotus]]. Prior to the advancement of the swarm, the mantid would send their massive kunchong to soften up the defenders' lines.

It would seem their tactics have not changed.

We must stop those kunchong if the Golden Lotus hope to mount a defensive against the swarm. I'm counting on you to strike them down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have the beasts been halted?

==Completion==
The kunchong are dangerous beasts. You are a brave <class> for taking them on.

The Golden Lotus thanks you.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Kunchong Destroyer]]s, [[Destroyer Krox'tazar]], and [[Kri'vin]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.3.0|note=Added.}}
