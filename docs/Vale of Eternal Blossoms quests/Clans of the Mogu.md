==Objectives==
Help [[Lorewalker Cho]] discover the origin of the Mysterious Mogu Sigil at the [[Seat of Knowledge]].
* [[The Serpent Masters]] read
* [[Power Through Blood]] read
* [[Will of Stone]] read
* [[The Origins of the Mogu]] read

==Description==
You say a [[mogu]] asked for your help? This is quite uncharacteristic.

I'd be happy to help you uncover the origins of this sigil. To be honest, the prospect of a mogu [[clan]] that isn't openly hostile interests me greatly. Just think of the possibilities!

Let's get down to business. We'll need to consult the volumes on the various mogu clans in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms|vale]] to narrow it down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Why are you talking to me? The knowledge you seek is in the tomes.

==Completion==
If the mogu are once again following Ra-den it could mean an end to their days of war.

This is very exciting!

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|Say|Lorewalker Cho|As you know, the mogu clans were once again united by the resurrected Thunder King, [[Lei Shen]].}}
:''A vision of adventurers attacking Lei Shen appears. The group consists of a Mage, Druid, Paladin, Priest, Warrior, Rogue, and Hunter. A Quilen is also present.''
:{{Text|Say|Lorewalker Cho|After [[Lei Shen (tactics)|his defeat]], the mogu splintered and began warring for dominance. Many new clans arose from the ashes.}}
:''Another vision shows untargetable mogu fighting one another.''
:{{Text|Say|Lorewalker Cho|Perhaps this sigil belongs to one of them. Let's begin our search with my copy of "The Serpent Masters".}}

;Reading The Serpent Masters
:''A vision of a mogu channeler subduing a cloud serpent plays out.''
:{{Text|Say|Lorewalker Cho|With their command over storm and serpent, many consider the [[Zan-Tien clan|Zan-Tien]] the dominant clan... though the others surely disagree..}}
:{{Text|Say|Lorewalker Cho|However, I see nothing pertaining to our mysterious sigil. Perhaps my copy of "Power through Blood" holds the answer...}}

;Reading Power Through Blood
:''A vision of a mogu blood caster in front of blood golems plays out.''
:{{Text|Say|Lorewalker Cho|Masters of [[blood magic]], the [[Dokani]] bolster their ranks with powerful war machines fueled by the life essence of those they conquer.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lorewalker Cho|This looks nothing like the sigil, though. See if you can find a copy of "Will of Stone".}}

;Reading Will of Stone
:''Terracota warriors stand guard over saurok who dig at stones with a big terracotta mogu.''
:{{Text|Say|Lorewalker Cho|Stubborn and prideful, the [[Baruk clan|Baruk]] use the spirits of the dead to animate the statues littering their ruins and turn them into immortal soldiers.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lorewalker Cho|The sigil does not appear here, either. Could it be we've not encountered these mogu before?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lorewalker Cho|Wait... there is one more tome we could search. Bring me a copy of "The Origins of the Mogu".}}

;Reading Origins of the Mogu
:{{Text|Say|Lorewalker Cho|Originally, the mogu served the [[titan]]s as builders and guardians. Those who answered to [[Ra|Highkeeper Ra-den]] were known as the "[[Rajani]]."}}
:''Several green mogu kneel in front of Ra.''
:{{Text|Say|Lorewalker Cho|Remarkable! This sigil matches that of the Rajani! Is it possible that this ancient clan has been resurrected? And what of Ra-den?}}
