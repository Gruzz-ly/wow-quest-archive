==Objectives==
Defeat 10 players through Find Battle with a team of level 25 pets.
*Win PvP Pet Battles (10)

==Description==
Are you ready to put your pets to the test? The battle pet arena is no place for low-level rabbits, you'd better have a rocketbot in your pocket and be ready for action. If you've got three fully-experienced pets, find battles against trainers of similar skill and show the world what you've got. You can find the instructions in your Pet Journal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40||}} (or {{cost|19|84|50}} if completed at level 90)

You will also receive:
*[[Brawler's Pet Supplies]]
*[[Valor Points]] (20)
*[[Lesser Charm of Good Fortune]] (8)

==Progress==
Well, you're back, did your pets make it out in one piece?

==Completion==
I've heard stories about some of your matches circulating around, apparently they were quite a sight to behold! I think you've earned this reward. Congratulations, trainer, and keep up the good work.

==Patch changes==
