==Objectives==
Destroy 6 Corrupted Incubators in the [[Big Blossom Mine]] in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Corrupted Incubator]] (6)

==Description==
[[Shado-Pan]] scouts have spotted evidence of a new [[mantid]] hatchery within the Big Blossom mine. It seems these [[Deephive]] mantid are looking to create new corrupted spawn to serve [[N'Zoth]].

If these eggs were allowed to hatch, a new swarm empowered by the Old God could blacken the skies of the Vale and plunge [[Pandaria]] into darkness.

We will not allow that to happen, will we?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What news of the hatchery?

==Completion==
The swarm has been abated, for now.

Keep an eye out for any new hatcheries. We cannot afford to leave the Deephive unchecked.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.3.0|note=Added.}}
