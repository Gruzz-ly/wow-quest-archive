}}

Remove the clutter and put the artifact on display.

==Completion==
This will aid lorewalkers and archaeologists in understanding the history of [[Pandaria]].

==Notes==
{{Book|Terracotta Arm|content=When the Mogu had exhausted their options for enslaved mortal warriors, they turned their attention to creating armies of animated constructs to do their fighting for them. Because these terracotta warriors would sometimes sit dormant for centuries, it is hard to pinpoint exactly when this one was constructed or used. However, scoring at the base of the severed arm indicates that it was felled in combat.

This specimen was donated by the esteemed <class>, <name>.}}
