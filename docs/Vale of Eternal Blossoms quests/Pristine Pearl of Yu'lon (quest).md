==Notes==
{{Book|Pearl of Yu'lon|content=Etched around the center of this orb of jade is a serpent eating its own tail.  Inscriptions on either hemisphere read: 'There is but one certainty - every end marks a new beginning.'  This orb, carved during the reign of Pandaren Emperor [[Shu Blindeye]] in honor of the [[Jade Serpent]], is a representation of his{{sic}} rebirth into a new body every hundred years.  Yu'lon still bestows wisdom and insight from his{{sic}} [[Temple of the Jade Serpent|temple]] in the [[Jade Forest]].

This specimen was donated by the esteemed <class>, <name>.}}
