== Objectives ==
Clean off the Empty Bookshelf.
*[[An empty bookshelf]]

== Description ==
[[Pandaria]] is rich with history, legends, stories, and lore of every sort. While you are traveling throughout the world I would ask that you keep an eye open for artifacts and pieces of information that you feel would be pertinent to our work here.

When you accumulate enough knowledge, we will compile it in to a volume for your personal collection here.

You can, of course, return whenever you like to review the volumes we are making for you.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|98|50}}
* 23600 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
So much to learn.

== Completion ==
Ah! Now that that is done we can start to place your collected research here. I look forward to seeing what you find.

== Notes ==
Run down the base of the steps, turn right, and click on the first bookshelf.

There are no direct followups, so pick up a daily from {{NPC||Ms. Thai}} on the east side of the room.

==Progression==
{{The Lorewalkers}}

== Patch changes ==
