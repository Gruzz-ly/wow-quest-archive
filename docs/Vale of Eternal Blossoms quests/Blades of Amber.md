==Objectives==
Collect 15 Amber Blades from [[Vil'thik]] [[mantid]] in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Amber Blade (BfA)]] (15)

==Description==
The mantid are frail and easily broken, but the [[amber]] blades they wield are formidable.

With a bit of work, they could be reshaped into something suitable for the [[mogu]].

Bring them to me, and I can see about repurposing them to service the [[Rajani]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

You will also receive one from:
{{itembox||q1=466|Azerite
|q2=65|War Resources
|q3=250|Coalescing Visions
|q4=489|Azerite
}}

==Progress==
Have you brought me some blades?

==Completion==
It surprises me how such a sharp and durable blade could be made from something as fragile as a tree.

Perhaps we have something to learn from the mantid, after all.
