== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Bowmistress Li}} at the [[Gate of the Setting Sun]] between the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]] and the [[Dread Wastes]].

== Description ==
The [[Klaxxi]] are only rumored to exist, far beyond the wall in the Dread Wastes.

Few have ventured into that territory, and none have returned to tell the tale.

If you are set on finding these... Klaxxi... there is a small group of [[Shado-Pan]] manning the wall to the far southwest who may know more.

== Completion ==
The Dread Wastes is a very dangerous place.

== Notes ==
Take the flight path to the [[Serpent's Spine]] south of the [[Gate of the Setting Sun]].

==Progression==
{{Finding the Klaxxi}}

== Patch changes ==
