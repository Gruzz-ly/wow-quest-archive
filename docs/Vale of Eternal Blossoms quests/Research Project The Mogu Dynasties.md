==Objectives==
Obtain 20 Mogu Archaeology Fragments.
*[[Mogu Archaeology Fragment]] (20)

==Description==
Ah, an explorer. Just what I could use. I am on the verge of discovering the dark secrets of the [[mogu]].

Not all of the secrets, mind you. They kept a lot of dark secrets. But I am on the verge of discovering "a" secret at least.

If, in your travels, you come across some fragments of the mogu past, bring them to me and I will happily reimburse you for them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
* 236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It is dangerous to forget our past.

==Completion==
Ah! Some fine pieces here. Very fine pieces indeed. My thanks, adventurer.

==Notes==
This quest requires [[Archaeology]] to complete, but unlike most [[profession]]-specific quests, is not marked as such and is offered to all players. The required items are typical archaeology fragments, found through normal archaeology work.

==Progression==
{{The Lorewalkers}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
