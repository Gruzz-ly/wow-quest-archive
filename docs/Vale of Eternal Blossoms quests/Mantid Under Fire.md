==Objectives==
[[File:Krik'thik Hiveling.jpg|thumb|[[Krik'thik Hiveling]].]]
Use a Shado-Pan Hot Oil Bucket to kill 80 mantid near the [[Gate of the Setting Sun]].
*[[Krik'thik Hiveling]] slain (80)

==Description==
The mantid are attacking again, and we're a bit short-handed up on the wall. In hopes that you'd help, I saved one of the more fun posts for you: the hot oil!

It's a bit more violent and a bit less scandalous than it sounds.

It's simple really. Get up on the wall, find one of the oil stations, and dump it on any of the mantid pouring up against the wall. It's very effective.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236,000 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Golden Lotus]]

==Progress==
The hard part is the cleanup. Fortunately, you're not responsible for that.

==Completion==
You've done devastating damage to the mantid forces. The wall defenders should be able to get things under control.

==Notes==
Fly to the Dread Wastes-side of the Gate of the Setting Sun. Flanking the gate itself are two towers with Hot Oil Cauldrons on the crenellations. Interact with one to control it:
*{{abilities|Ignitable Oil Bucket|range=150|Cover mantid in ignitable oil, preparing them to be burned alive.|notes=Instant.|cd=1 sec}}
*{{abilities|Ignite Oil|range=150|Ignite mantid covered in ignitable oil, dealing high Fire damage over 12 seconds and spreading fire to other nearby ignitable mantid.|notes=Instant|cd=8 sec}}

===Classic===
In {{expac|Mists of Pandaria Classic}}, interacting with a Hot Oil Cauldron causes it to become a flying vehicle with the same attacks as the original version. It is intended to be flown over the mantid before attacking.

The quest may appear not to be working correctly if the attacks are launched from a cauldron's original location without flying it outward; in this case the torch may not actually ignite the mantid. Simply flying it out from the wall into the Dread Wastes resolves this issue.
