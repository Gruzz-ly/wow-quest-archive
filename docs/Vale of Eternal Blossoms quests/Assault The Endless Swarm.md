==Objectives==
Drive back the [[Mantid Assault]] in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* Cull the [[mantid]] swarm (0-100%)
* [[Kri'vin]] slain
* Return to [[Taoshi]] at the [[Silent Sanctuary]].

==Description==
:{{Text|Say|Taoshi|The swarm is advancing over the [[Serpent's Spine]]! We must drive them back!}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 26,800 [[XP]]
* [[Cache of the Mantid Swarm]]
* [[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (500 [[Azerite (resource)]])
* +500 reputation with [[Rajani]]

==Progress==
Are you with me?

==Completion==
It looks like they're retreating. That was a close one.

The Vale should be safe, for now.

==Notes==
;Cull the mantid swarm 100%
:{{text|say|[[Grand Empress Shek'zara]]|Your pathetic resistance is nothing against my swarm! [[Kri'vin]] shall devour you!}}

;Kri'vin slain
:{{Text|Say|Taoshi|The mantid are scattering! You've given us the edge we needed to turn the tide. The [[Shado-Pan]] can take it from here!}}
