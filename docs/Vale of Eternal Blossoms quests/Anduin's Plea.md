Ah, just the <class> I was looking for. I have received an urgent letter from the young Prince Anduin.

He is playing host to his father, [[Varian Wrynn|King Wrynn]], and several other Alliance dignitaries at the Shrine of Seven Stars in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].

According to his most recent correspondence, something bad is happening at the city.

Please go at once and speak with him. I must settle some affairs here at Lion's Landing, but I will join you soon.

Speak to Fennie if you'd like a ride to the Vale.

You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Operation: Shieldwall]]

==Completion==
Well met, <class>. We have much work to do here.

==Notes==
Speak with Fennie Hornswaggle up the hill for a kite ride.

:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|The young Prince Anduin's been askin' after ya.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|After the excavation trip to Mogujia, the Explorer's League brought their findings back to our city in the Vale o' Eternal Blossoms.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|They've been studying the relics that the blood elves were stealin'.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|I'm not supposed ta say anything 'bout this, but ye've got a face that says ye like a good Dwarven stout, so I trust ye!}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Those mogu belong to a tribe called the Korune.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|From the looks o' it, the Korune were loyal to the Thunder King, thousands o' years ago... before even the pandaren came to rule this land.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|They worked from the shadows, and get this... somehow, they managed to master the sha.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|If the Korune were capable of such a feat, ain't no wonder Garrosh is after their knowledge!}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Imagine what would happen if that knotty-pated axe-bludgeoner Garrosh could manipulate the sha to his bidding.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Makes me shudder even ta think.}}
:{{text|say|Fennie Hornswaggle|Here you go. Good luck!}}

The shrine has been infested by the sha! [[Anduin Wrynn]], [[Varian Wrynn]], [[Brann Bronzebeard]], [[Tinkmaster Overspark]], [[Sky Admiral Rogers]], [[Hilda Hornswaggle]], [[Sarannha Skyglaive]], [[Shieldwall Explorer]]s, and a handful of [[Stormwind Royal Guard (NPC)|royal guards]] have taken over the [[Imperial Exchange]] on the upper floor on the east side.
