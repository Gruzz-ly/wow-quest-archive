==Objectives==
Kill 6 Eyes of the Empire in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Eye of the Empire]] slain (6)

==Description==
Were it not enough for our enemy to apply deadly force against us, their minions also strike into the very heart of our defenders.

I speak, of course, of the eyes. They peer into the [[soul]]s of our [[warrior]]s and produce their darkest fears against them.

If we have any hope to defeat this foe, they must be destroyed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
The foul eyes are no more, and our warriors' courage is restored.

Thank you, <name>.
