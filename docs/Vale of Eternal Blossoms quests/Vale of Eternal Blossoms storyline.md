The '''[[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]] storyline''' begins at level 87 in [[Kun-Lai Summit]] at the [[Temple of the White Tiger]]. A short quest chain pays off with the opening of the [[Gate of the August Celestials]] for the first time in generations! After that, breadcrumbs open up to [[daily quest]]s elsewhere on the continent once adventurers reach level 90.

The actual storyline plays out whenever players gain a reputation level with the [[Golden Lotus]] faction. Daily quests for the Golden Lotus start at the [[Golden Pagoda]] underneath the two mogu statues on the east side of the zone. The progression of the Golden Lotus storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Eternally in the Vale]].

In [[Kun-Lai Summit]], word has gotten out that {{NPC||Xuen}}, the White Tiger, is hearing petitions to open the [[Gate of the August Celestials]] at the southern border of Kun-Lai with the Vale. Should adventurers pass his tests, he, along with the rest of the [[August Celestials]], will open the Vale for the first time in generations.
