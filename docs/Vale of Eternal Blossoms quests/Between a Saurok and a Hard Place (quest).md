==Description==
Dear <name>,

We have received your research on the [[saurok]] and believe we have pieced together clues about their past.

If you visit us at the [[Seat of Knowledge]] in [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]] we can add this contribution to your personal collection.

Thank you for your diligence!

Sincerely,

Lorewalker Cho

* +2850 [[reputation]] with [[The Lorewalkers]]

==Completion==
Before your research, I don't think pandarens{{sic}} ever really knew why the saurok were so vicious. We will add this knowledge to your collection. If you wish me to narrate this for you, simply point at the correct volume in your Private Collection.

==Notes==
Upon completion of the [[Between a Saurok and a Hard Place]] Pandaria [[exploration achievement]], [[Lorewalker Cho]] sends a letter via the in-game mail system. The letter has an item attached that starts this quest. See the achievement for more details.
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Let us talk about the nature of power.  In my hands I hold a sword.  I ask you: Who wields the power?}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|I do, for I wield the sword!}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Many thousands of years ago, the [[mogu]] held all the power.  They ruled this [[Pandaria|land]] with fists of Iron.  But as [[mogu empire|their empire grew]], they needed a way to police and control it.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|They used the powers of the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms|Vale]], and their own flesh-warping magics, to twist and shape a of [[basilisk|ferocious lizards]] into a living weapon.  They created a army.  An army of [[Saurok]].  Bloodthirsty savages created to enforce the will of the emperor.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Ah, but there is a problem with creating a living weapon.  Do you see?}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Who, now, wields the power?}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The heartless saurok, even with their tiny lizard brains, soon realized the truth of their position.  They killed the [[Mantid|enemies of the mogu]].}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Then they killed the [[Pandaren|subjects of the mogu]].}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Soon, they started killing the mogu themselves.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The mogu emperor then ordered all of the saurok to be purged.  He tried to wipe out their entire race, to no avail.  They still plague Pandaria to this day.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|So you see - power is easily taken, but should not be lightly given.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Oh... I seem to have lost my sword.}}
