==Objectives==
Defeated 20 Shado-Pan Trainees in the Battle Ring.
*[[Shado-Pan Trainee]]s defeated (20)

==Description==
We have some fresh trainees that are far from being a danger to you, but in numbers, they may prove enough of a challenge. And if not, they could use the lesson in humility.

Step into the battle ring when you're ready. Don't go easy on them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Golden Lotus]]

==Progress==
Step into the ring. Show them how a real <class> fights.

==Completion==
Very impressive. It seems they have much learning to do. I'll see to that.

==Notes==
Head just southwest to the ring of Shado-Pan Trainees under the command of [[Hai-Me Heavyhands]]. They have one tenth of the health of normal level 90 mobs. Inside the ring, adventurers will be buffed with "Battle Ring", and trainees will start coming a few at a time. Use any and all group-combat tactics.
