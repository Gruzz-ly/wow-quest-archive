==Objectives==
Destroy 6 [[Black Empire]] Obelisks in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Black Empire Obelisk]] (6)

==Description==
In ages past, the black obelisks of the [[Old God]]s would herald the coming of their forces. The dark conjurers among the [[k'thir]] and [[n'raqi]] would utilize these monuments to establish footholds in our world and usher in more of the Old Gods' minions.

Today, we see these very same obelisks littering the battlefields. So long as they stand, [[N'Zoth]]'s forces will be without end.

Make sure they do not.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

A combination of two from:
*325x [[Coalescing Visions]]
*50 - 60 [[War Resources]]
*[[Glowing Azerite]] (350 Azerite)

==Progress==
Is your task complete?

==Completion==
You've destroyed the obelisks? Good, the Old Gods must be given no ground.

Remember this in your battles.
