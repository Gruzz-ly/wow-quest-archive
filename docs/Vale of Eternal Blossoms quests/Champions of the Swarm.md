==Objectives==
Defeat 3 [[rare]] [[mantid]] enemies in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
*Rare mantid enemies defeated

==Description==
It is clear that [[Grand Empress Shek'zara|Shek'zara]] is fully committed to this invasion. Our [[scout]]s have spotted some of her greatest champions among the battlefield.

Any one of these mantid could prove too much for the soldiers of the [[Golden Lotus]] to overcome. We must hunt them down and eliminate them ourselves.

Are you in?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|191|81}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

You will also receive one or two from:
* {{Cost|cv=250}}
*60 - 65x [[War Resources]]
*306 [[Azerite (resource)]]

==Progress==
Strike swiftly.

==Completion==
Impressive kill count. You almost kept up with me.

Maybe next time, though.

==Patch changes==
