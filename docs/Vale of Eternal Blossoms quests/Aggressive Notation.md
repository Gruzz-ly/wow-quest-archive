==Objectives==
Use the Lorewalker's Notebook to gather notes about the [[N'raqi|faceless]], [[k'thir]], and [[fleshbeast]]s in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* Faceless notated
* K'thir notated
* Fleshbeast notated
* [[Loremaster's Notebook]] (provided)

==Description==
Even given the [[Sha]]'s origins with the [[Old God]]s, we in [[Pandaria]] still know very little of them.

I would like to take this opportunity to add whatever information I can about them to the archives of the [[Lorewalkers]]. Of course, that becomes a bit problematic when they're trying to kill us.

That doesn't seem to be a problem for you, though. Could you do me a favor and jot down some notes about what you encounter out there? It could help a great deal towards understanding what we're fighting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*17,850 [[XP]]
*325 [[Coalescing Visions]]
*70 [[War Resources]]

==Progress==
What have you discovered?

==Completion==
Fantastic! This is very thorough!

I must ask, though, how do you maintain such impeccable penmanship in the heat of battle?

==Patch changes==
