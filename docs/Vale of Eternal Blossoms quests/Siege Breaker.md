==Objectives==
Sabotage 3 [[Vil'thik]] War [[Wagon]]s in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Vil'thik War Wagon]] destroyed (3)

==Description==
The [[Golden Lotus]] can hold their own against the [[mantid]]'s [[warrior]]s, of that I have no doubt. Their [[war wagon]]s, on the other hand, have the capability of crippling an entire squad of our fighters in a single volley.

If we wish to maintain the upper hand in this battle, we will need someone to infiltrate their positions and sabotage their siege engines.

I would like you to volunteer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have the war wagons been dismantled?

==Completion==
Our scouts have reported several mantid war wagons seem to have been destroyed in spectacular fashion.

I assume I have you to thank for this.
