== Objectives ==
Earned {{reputation|Revered}} status with the [[Golden Lotus]].

== Description ==
A contingent of [[Shado-Pan]] soldiers have made base camp at Shado-Pan Garrison, on the western coast of the Townlong Steppes near [[Niuzao Temple]].

We have dedicated a sizable force to defending the temple from all sides.

Although we Shado-Pan do not typically seek help from strangers, the situation is dire enough to warrant it.

== Completion ==
Yes, I suppose we could use your help.

== Notes ==
Bearheart is at the northwest side of the camp.
