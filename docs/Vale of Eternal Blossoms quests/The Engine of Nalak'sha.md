==Objectives==
Follow the secret passage within [[Mogu'shan Palace]] and re-activate the Engine of Nalak'sha.
* [[Engine of Nalak'sha]] activated

==Description==
Your kind have proved me wrong in the past, so I will give you a chance to do so again.

The [[titan]] structure which houses the Engine of Nalak'sha spans the entirety of [[Pandaria]]. There are more ways to reach it than just the [[Mogu'shan Vaults]].

There are many such routes, but the closest would be through Mogu'shan Palace. The chambers beneath the palace are interconnected with the vaults. 

Seek your fate there, champion.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Rajani]]

==Progress==
Your courage is impressive. I only hope it is not wasted.

==Completion==
You have done a great thing for the Rajani today, champion.

I hope the Engine of Nalak'sha provided the power you seek.

==Notes==
On accept, Magni persists in teleporting directly to the quest objective without offering the champion a lift:
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|So all o' the titan facilities on Pandaria are connected? Fascinating!}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Well, no sense standin' around while the world is endin'! Tae Mogu'shan Palace!}}

Zone in through the instance portal to load in to a special version of the instance:

===Stage 1: A Way Down===
:''Find a way to the lower levels of Mogu'shan Palace.''
*Find a way to the lower levels
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Ra-den said that the secret passage is hidden beneath the palace. We need tae find a way down there.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Ach! The statues are comin' tae life!}}

Four [[Animated Guardian (Mogu'shan Palace)|Animated Guardian]]s come active, one after the other. Defeat them all:
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Looks like defeatin' the guards opened the door. Let's go, champion!}}

Approaching the spear traps:
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Careful where ye step. The mogu are known tae leave traps for unwary intruders.}}

Jump over the tiles on the ground. Four more Animated Guardians defend the doors to the [[Crimson Assembly Hall]].

===Stage 2: Watch Your Step===
:''Activate the Ancient Lever in the Crimson Assembly Hall.''
*Activate the [[Ancient Lever]]
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|That switch must open the way forward. Just watch yer step around those tiles.}}

The center of the room is full of tiles. Stepping on a tile will cause other tiles of that same type to become unsafe. The objective is to always change tile types with each move. Flip the lever in the center to continue.

===Stage 3: A Weighty Problem===
:''Find a way to open the sealed door in the Forgotten Passageway.''
*Find a way to open the door.
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|A hidden staircase!}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|It looks like this leads underground. Let's find that passage!}}

The lever opens the path down to the [[Forgotten Passageway]], where two [[Trapped Saurok]] come up to attack. Don't forget the trap tiles on the way down! Also note some of the trapped saurok turning to cannibalism because of their dire straits...

Down another set of stairs, more saurok and a room of four Mogu Statues, with one misplaced...
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Hmm. I dunnae see a way to open the door.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|There must be a switch somewhere. We best start searchin'.}}

Stepping on the pressure plate will give a clue as to what the solution may be.

:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Ah, seems we'll need somethin' tae weigh down this tile tae keep the door open.}}

Get behind the statue then click on it to move it in that direction. Once it's mostly on the button the scenario continues.

===Stage 4: The Long Walk===
:''Reach the Mogu'shan Vaults through the secret route from the Forgotten Passageway.''
*Reach the Mogu'shan Vaults
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|The statue, of course! Ye've got a sharp mind, hero!}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|That did it! Now, let's see where this passage leads!}}

Walk into the newly-opened doorway and the scene will fade to black:
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Maybe we should've brought a torch...}}

On the other side, the [[Repository]] of [[Mogu'shan Vaults]]:
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Wait, I think we're here! Now let's find the Engine!}}

Step forward, and the mantid invaders appear:
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|What in the name of Azeroth is goin' on in here?}}
:{{text|yell|Depthcaller Xith'el|Intruders have breached the vaults!}}

Aggro [[Depthcaller Xith'el]]:
:{{text|yell|Depthcaller Xith'el|Leave none alive!}}

Defeat her to continue.

===Stage 5: Madness Manifest===
:''Destroy the Manifestations of N'Zoth being summoned into the Repository.''
*Destroy the manifestations of N'Zoth (0/100%)
:{{text|say|Depthcaller Xith'el|The Deep One... returns...}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I, I should've known the mantid would throw their lot in with N'Zoth!}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|They're tryin' tae corrupt the Vaults! We cannae let that happen!}}

The clickable objects are what count, not the normal mobs.
*[[Summoned Eye]]: 5%
*[[Summoned Tentacle]]: 10%
*[[Summoned Maw]]: 23%

Get to 100% and the scenario continues, with N'Zoth reaching into the player's mind.

===Stage 6: The Hall of the Shapers===
:''Fight through the mantid forces in the Hall of the Shapers to reach the Engine of Nalak'sha.''
*Reach the Engine of Nalak'sha
:{{text|say|N'Zoth|Do you feel the frenzy of the swarm?}}
:{{text|say|N'Zoth|They know what is coming. They know you will be its herald.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Champion? Are ye still with me?}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I'm startin' tae worry about ye. But right now, we have tae focus on the Engine. Come on!}}

Clear a path downstairs in the direction of [[Elegon]]'s room. Upon entering the [[Hall of Shapers]]:
:{{text|say|Swarmguard Kzaz|The empress will have our heads if the ritual is interrupted.}}
:{{text|say|Swarmguard Kzaz|Stop them at all costs!}}
:''Kzaz and his entourage run west, leaving some guards behind.''

[[Swarmguard Kzaz|Kzaz]] aggroes immediately upon entering the [[Engine of Nalak'sha]] room:
:{{text|yell|Swarmguard Kzaz|You cannot oppose the Deep One!}}

Behind him several [[Deephive Summoner]]s can be seen performing a ritual.

Defeat him to continue.

===Stage 7: The Final Summoning===
:''Defeat Yox'ith in the Engine of Nalak'Sha.{{Sic}}''
*Defeat [[Yox'ith]]

The summoners finish their ritual, giving their lives in the process.

:{{text|say|Swarmguard Kzaz|You are... too late...}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Look at the size o' that thing! Go for the eye!}}

Where [[Elegon]] would normally be fought, a gigantic eye stalk and four [[Tentacle (Yox'ith)|Tentacles]] are found instead. It's [[Yox'ith]], a Manifestation of N'Zoth. Reminiscent of the [[Megaera]] encounter, defeating the Tentacles will knock off an equivalent amount of health from Yox'ith.

Defeat Yox'ith to continue.

===Final Stage: Revving the Engine===
:''Network the Engine of Nalak'sha to the Chamber of Heart.''
*Link the Engine of Nalak'sha to the Chamber of Heart

Interact with the [[Titan Console (Mogu'shan Vaults)|Titan Console]], where this time a cutscene plays out rather than starting a boss encounter:
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|There we go! Ye can use that console tae connect us tae the Chamber of Heart.}}
:{{text|say|MOTHER|Remote link established. Awaiting circuit completion.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Hold yer horses, lass. This thing didn't exactly come with instructions.}}
:''A bolt of storm hits Magni.''
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Ouch! That stung.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Wait... it all makes sense now! Connectin' the power circuit!}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|What's this? Interestin'... I'll remember that fer later.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|There, the link is up.}}
:{{text|say|MOTHER|Acknowledged. Rerouting power to Forge of Origination.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|We did it, hero! The Forge is drawin' power from the Engine o' Nalak'sha!}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|And... I found somethin' in the archives that could turn the tide against N'Zoth!}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Come on, let's get back tae the Highkeeper!}}

Magni ''again'' immediately teleports away. Thankfully, there's a teleporter that leads back to the entrance of [[Mogu'shan Palace]].

===Finale===
Head back to the [[Silent Sanctuary]].

On approach:
:{{text|say|Ra-den|An intriguing discovery, Speaker. If the mogu have learned how to focus the Forge's energies...}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Aye, it means we can use the Forge against N'Zoth without reoriginatin' the entire world!}}
:{{text|say|Ra-den|Hmm. Perhaps I should observe this myself.}}
