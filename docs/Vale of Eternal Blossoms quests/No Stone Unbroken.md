Kill 10 Baruk mogu in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].

==Description==
When the warring [[clan]]s came into the Vale, the Baruk deigned themselves worthy to lay claim to the ancient grounds of [[Ruins of Guo-Lai|Guo-Lai]].

They are not.

Show these usurpers their place, and you may earn a modicum of favor with the [[Rajani]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

You will also receive one or two from:

|q3=50|War Resources
|q4=60|War Resources
}}

==Progress==
What is it?

==Completion==
The Baruk will soon learn their place under the foot of the Rajani.

Well done.
