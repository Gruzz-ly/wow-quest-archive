'''Pristine Sound Beacon''' is a quest that allows the player, through [[phasing]], to permanently display an [[Inert Sound Beacon]] as a physical object in the [[Seat of Knowledge]].

==Objectives==
Put the artifact on display.
* [[Pristine Sound Beacon]] (provided)

==Description==
This artifact has been restored to a remarkably excellent condition.  Perhaps you will put it on display at the [[Seat of Knowledge]], so that [[lorewalkers]] and [[archaeologist]]s can study it.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=3|Restored Artifact
|q2=1|Mantid Amber Sliver
}}

==Progress==
Remove the clutter and put the artifact on display.

==Completion==
This will aid lorewalkers and archaeologists in understanding the history of [[Pandaria]].

==Notes==
{{Book|Inert Sap Feeder|content=The technology behind mantid sound beacons is incomprehensible for non-mantid races.  They seem to rely on mantid physiology.  This ancient beacon, while intact, is completely inert without mantid to interact with it.

This specimen was donated by the esteemed <class>, <name>.}}
