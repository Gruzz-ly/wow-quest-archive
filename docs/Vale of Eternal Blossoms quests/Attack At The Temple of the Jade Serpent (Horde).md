== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Elder Sage Tai-Feng}} at the [[Jade Temple Grounds]] in [[Jade Forest|The Jade Forest]].

== Description ==
Darkness enshrouds the [[Temple of the Jade Serpent]], and {{NPC||Yu'lon||Yu'Lon's}} priests beseech us for aid.

They hold the [[sha]] in check, but just barely.

You may be able to turn the tide, <class>.

== Completion ==
You've arrived just in time, <class>.

== Notes ==
Fly to the southern end of the [[Jade Temple Grounds]], as the rest of the grounds have been taken by the sha. Inside the building next to the flight master is {{NPC||Elder Sage Tai-Feng}} and {{NPC||Elder Sage Storm-Sing}}, who both offer daily quests.

==Progression==
