==Objectives==
Close 3 Void Tears within the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Void Tear (Vale of Eternal Blossoms)|Void Tears]] closed (3)

==Description==
As [[N'Zoth]]'s influence spreads within the Vale, our very reality begins to break down.

The [[Old God]]'s power has created tears in the fabric [[Azeroth|our world]], acting as doorways for his minions to invade from [[Ny'alotha|his dark realm]].

As long as these tears exist, we will never be free from N'Zoth's grasp. Close them, and stem the tide of his corruption!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
