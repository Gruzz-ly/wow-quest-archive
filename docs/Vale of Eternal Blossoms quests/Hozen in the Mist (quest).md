==Notes==
Upon completion of the [[Hozen in the Mist]] Pandaria [[exploration achievement]], [[Lorewalker Cho]] sends a letter via the in-game mail system. The letter has an item attached that starts this quest. See the achievement for more details.
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|One day, a father grew tired of his young cub's misbehavior. "You act just like a [[hozen]]!" the father scolded. Still, his son misbehaved.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|To teach him a lesson, the father dragged the cub out to the forest, to watch how the hozen live. "Do you see what the hozen are like?" he asked, "Do you want to live like that?"}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The hozen are quite lively indeed. A short-lived race, few hozen survive past their 20th birthday. Their leaders are all 14 or 15. How mature were you at 14 years old? Mediate on that!}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Afterwards, the father asked his cub what he had learned.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|"I learned that we work and toil on our little farm, but that the hozen have the whole world as their garden." the cub said. "I learned that we squint by the light of a single candle, but that the hozen enjoy the light of the stars. I learned that I go to school every day, but that the hozen learn by doing."}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|And the cub concluded, "I should very much like to live like a hozen!"}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Who then, was the wiser? The father or the cub?}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|That, my friend, is for you to decide.}}
