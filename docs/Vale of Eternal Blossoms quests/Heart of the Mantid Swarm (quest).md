==Description==
Dear <name>,

While we appreciate your efforts to investigate the lore of [[Pandaria]], the documents you sent us on the [[mantid]] managed to rob me of several nights sleep. Terrifying stuff.

If you visit us at the Seat of Knowledge in [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]] we can add this contribution to your personal collection.

Thank you for your diligence!

Sincerely,

Lorewalker Cho

You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +2850 [[reputation]] with [[The Lorewalkers]]

==Completion==
When we began this research project I never thought I would learn so much about such a terrifying people.

We will add this knowledge to your collection. If you wish me to narrate this for you, simply point at the correct volume in your Private Collection.

==Notes==
Upon completion of the [[Heart of the Mantid Swarm]] Pandaria [[exploration achievement]], [[Lorewalker Cho]] sends a letter via the in-game mail system. The letter has an item attached that starts this quest. See the achievement for more details.
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Oh, my student - you wish to study the [[mantid]]? Be warned: the [[pandaren]] frontier is littered with the graves of former pupils.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The mantid are harsh teachers.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Every generation, the mantid swarm the [[Serpent's Spine]] wall in great numbers. They murder many pandaren, so we kill many times their number in return. Yet each generation, they attack once more. Why do they do this?}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|We pandaren do not know.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Our ancient writings indicate that the mantid have always been here. They predate even the [[mogu]]. Where did they come from?}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|We pandaren do not know.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Perhaps, if you were to [[Klaxxi|befriend]] the mantid, and earn a [[reputation]] among them, they would teach you their [[Y'Shaarj|secrets]]. But I warn you:}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Nobody has ever befriended the mantid.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Here is what the pandaren do know: By massacring our people, by slaughtering tens of thousands of pandaren, generation after generation, they have taught us the value of life. A precious but fleeting gift. Easily snuffed out... in an instant.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|This is what the mantid have taught us.}}
