==Notes==
{{Book|Empty Keg|content=The heart-shaped spigot to this cask reveals it to be an artifact of the late great Brewfather [[Xin Wo Yin]], "The Brokenhearted". Generations ago this renowned Brewfather created "Heartswell Brew", a concoction that infuses the drinker's entire being with a profound sense of warmth and wellbeing. It was said that Xin Wo Yin so loved the product of his art that he wept tears of heavy sorrow over every keg that left his brewery. It is likely that he wept over this very keg. Being that it's empty, you feel a little morose yourself.

This specimen was donated by the esteemed <class>, <name>.}}
