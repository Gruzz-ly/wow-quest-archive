==Objectives==
Kill 8 Putrid Ichors in [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Putrid Ichor]] slain (8)

==Description==
The corruption of the [[Old God]]s is often so foul it manifests itself in physical form.

We have seen this with the [[Sha]]. This time is no different.

Cull this corruption wherever you see it spread. It must not be left to flourish.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
* 346 [[Azerite (resource)]]
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
I can see the stains of N'Zoth's corruption on your weapons.

Well struck, <class>.
