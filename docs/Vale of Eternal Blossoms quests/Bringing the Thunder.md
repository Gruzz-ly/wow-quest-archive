==Objectives==
Kill 12 Zan-Tien mogu in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Zan-Tien clan|Zan-Tien]] [[mogu]] slain (12)

==Description==
All of the mogu [[clan]]s are formidable, to be sure, but it is the Zan-Tien that pose the most direct threat to the [[Golden Lotus]].

Even now, their numbers are amassing outside the [[Golden Pagoda]]. Many of our [[warrior]]s are fresh-faced and inexperienced. They would not withstand a mogu assault for long.

An experienced <class> like you could serve to slow them down significantly.

Care to help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What's the word from the front?

==Completion==
You've probably saved the lives of many Golden Lotus warriors today.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Torsheg]], [[Houndlord Ren]], [[Xiln the Mountain]], [[Zan-Tien Raider]]s, [[Zan-Tien Subjugator]]s, and [[Zan-Tien Caller]]s.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.3.0|note=Added.}}
