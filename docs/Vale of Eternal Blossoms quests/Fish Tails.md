:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Great events often have humble beginnings. Consider: a quiet pond. Still. The water is like a sheet of glass.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Until I throw a stone. Such a small thing - but soon, ripples engulf the whole of the lake!}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The [[jinyu]] also have humble origins. Once [[murloc|primitive creatures]], they were fortunate enough to live near the enchanted pools within the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms|Vale]].}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The magic of the pools expanded their minds and grew their bodies, until they became one of the great ancient cultures of [[Pandaria]].}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The wisest of the Jinyu are very wise indeed - they can speak to the rivers the way you and I would consult our elders.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|In the whispering waters, they can hear the future.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The jinyu and their [[waterspeakers]] stand at the very heart of the greatest events of Pandaria's history.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Their visions built empires, freed slaves, and warned our Last Emperor of the [[Great Sundering|Sundering]] that shattered [[Azeroth]] ten thousand years ago.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Think about it: the smallest voice can change the world. Consider that, friend, the next time you decide to start throwing stones!}}
