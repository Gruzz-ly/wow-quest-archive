Obtain 20 Pandaren Archaeology Fragments.

==Description==
Ah, adventurer.  You come at a most opportune time. My daughter and I are researching the history of our people and have hit a roadblock in our research.

Should you come across fragments of the pandaren past, please, bring them to us here. We would benefit greatly from the additional information.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=1}}

==Progress==
It is dangerous to forget our past.

==Completion==
Ah!  Some fine pieces here.  Very fine pieces indeed.  My thanks, adventurer.

==Notes==
Nothing special here - gather twenty pandaren fragments and turn back in.

==Patch changes==
