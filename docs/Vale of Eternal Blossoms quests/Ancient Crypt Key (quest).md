==Objectives==
Bring the key to [[Lorewalker Cho]] in [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
*[[Ancient Crypt Key]]

==Description==
<A magical device found on the [[mogu]] island invaders, it contains no more power.

You are aware of similar devices that were used to activate ancient [[titan]] machinery in the mogu vaults of [[Pandaria]].

This particular one teems with a foreboding presence.

The [[Lorewalkers]] may know more about this device.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (700x [[Azerite (resource)]])
*{{cost|11|70|}}
*8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh, hello my friend. We do not get many visitors here any longer, it is good to see you.

What is it you have there?

Ah, yes, I see. A rare device of mogu origin. We have seen these before, many years ago.

During the [[Age of a Hundred Kings]], the mogu found [[necromancy]]. Powerful mogu [[Necrolord (occupation)|necro-lords]] ruled their [[tribe]]s from crypts dug deep beneath the surface.

Many such crypts remain, unearthed or awoken by the [[Silithus: The Wound|wound in the world]], I cannot say which.

Oh! And I have something for you, as well. Here.
