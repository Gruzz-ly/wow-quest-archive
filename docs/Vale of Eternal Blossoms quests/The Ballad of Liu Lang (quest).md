==Notes==
[[File:Young Liu Lang and Shen-zin Su.jpg|thumb|[[Liu Lang]] and [[Shen-zin Su]].]]
Upon completion of the [[Ballad of Liu Lang]] Pandaria [[exploration achievement]], [[Lorewalker Cho]] sends a letter via the in-game mail system. The letter has an item attached that starts this quest. See the achievement for more details.
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|When the [[Great Sundering|Sundering]] ripped apart the continents of [[Azeroth]], we [[pandaren]] thought that the rest of the world had been utterly destroyed.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|But as the centuries passed, one young explorer decided to see what was out there. His name was [[Liu Lang]]. And he set out to discover the world... on the back of a turtle!}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|We celebrate his bravery with statue and song, but if you were actually there on the beach that very day - well, I'm sure he looked quite silly, indeed.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Oh, how the pandaren laughed at him. But Liu Lang was more clever than anyone thought. [[Sea turtle]]s always return to the beach where they were born. And so, despite the mists that envelop our land, he always had a way home.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Every few years, he returned - with tales of [[Zul'Farrak|mysterious cities in the sands]], [[tauren|nomadic people]] living on [[Mulgore|endless grassy plains]], a [[Azjol-Nerub|great empire]] under [[Northrend|the ice]], and a [[Quel'Thalas (kingdom)|magical kingdom gilded in gold]].}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Each time he returned, more and more pandaren answered Liu Lang's call, and joined him on his growing turtle. They were the bravest among us: The explorers. The adventurers.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|And that is the lesson of Liu Lang, my friend. Everyone always laughs at the explorer. They always laugh... until he returns.}}
