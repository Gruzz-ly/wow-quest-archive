Kill 10 Deephive mantid within the [[Big Blossom Mine]] in [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Deephive]] [[mantid]] slain (10)

==Description==
A sect of the mantid swarm calling themselves the "Deephive" have taken hold of the Big Blossom mine. These mantid have fully given themselves up to the [[Old God]]s' corruption, making them especially dangerous.

We cannot allow the Deephive to run amok in the Vale. Do what must be done.

==Rewards==

* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

A combination of two from:

*325x [[Coalescing Visions]]
*65 [[War Resources]]

==Progress==
Have the Deephive been taken care of?

==Completion==
The mantid are incessant, but we will drive them back.

At least you've taken care of the worst of their numbers.
