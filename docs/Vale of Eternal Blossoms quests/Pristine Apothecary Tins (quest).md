==Notes==
{{Book|Apothecary Tins of Yao Firmpaw|content=A complete set of brass apothecary jars, with neatly engraved labels, meant for the storage of a complicated array of powerful medicinal herbs.  Although the exact use of most of the herbs remains a mystery, a plaque on the box containing the tins identifies the physician as [[Yao Firmpaw]], a name still associated with health and wellness in the [[Valley of the Four Winds]] because of his spectacular career.  Yao never married - legend has it because his heart was forever broken.
