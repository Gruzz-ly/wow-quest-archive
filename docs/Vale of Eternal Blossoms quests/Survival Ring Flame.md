==Objectives==
Enter the Survival Ring and survive for 60 seconds without leaving.
*Live through the Survival Ring for 60 seconds

==Description==
This is one of the challenges I put upon my warriors during peaceful times to keep them strong and fast. Let's see how you fare.

Survive the ring for 60 seconds without getting pushed out or killed. Stay on your toes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Golden Lotus]]

==Progress==
The constant danger in the ring prepares us for life or death fighting we have to endure outside the wall.

==Completion==
Not bad, <class>. Not bad at all.

==Notes==
This quest cannot be completed or attempted while mounted. The Shao-Pan Trainers surround the survival ring, tossing fireworks every few seconds. The spot where the fireworks will land is marked by a big shadow, though the damage radius is a yard or two larger than the shadow graphic. Keep out of the fire for 60 seconds.
