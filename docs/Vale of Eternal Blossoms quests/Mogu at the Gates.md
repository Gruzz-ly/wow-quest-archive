Some of your kind have already gone to the gate to scout out the size of their force. If you think yourself worthy for such a mission, meet them there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

The mogu have not massed in numbers like this since... well I cannot remember!

We must be careful. They have overtaken the entire plains.
