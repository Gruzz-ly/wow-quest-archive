==Objectives==
Free 8 [[Golden Lotus]] [[prisoner]]s from [[Hardened Amber Cage]]s in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Golden Lotus Warrior|Golden Lotus prisoner]] freed (8)

==Description==
There's something different about this [[mantid]] swarm. Instead of just killing everything in sight like the mantid usually do, they've taken to capturing our defenders and holding them alive.

I really don't want to know what they have in store for the captives. 

Why don't you go rescue them so we don't have to find out?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

You will also receive two from:
{{itembox||q1=250|Coalescing Visions
|q2=65|War Resources
|q3=60|War Resources
|q4=55|War Resources
}}

*[[Glowing Azerite Geode]] (497 [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
I hope they're okay...

==Completion==
You've freed them? Oh, thank goodness!

I cannot fathom what a mantid would want to do with live prisoners, but it cannot be good!

==Notes==
*Interact with [[Hardened Amber Cage]]s.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.3.0|note=Added.}}
