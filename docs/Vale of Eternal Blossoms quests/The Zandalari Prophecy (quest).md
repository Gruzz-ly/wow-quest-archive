*[[The Zandalari Prophecy (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
Dear <name>,

I have read your reports on the Zandalari and believe I have some clues as to their most recent aggression.

If you visit us at the [[Seat of Knowledge]] in [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]] we can add this contribution to your personal collection.

Thank you for your diligence!

Sincerely,

Lorewalker Cho

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
* 236000 XP
* +2850 reputation with [[The Lorewalkers]]

==Completion==
No wonder the Zandalari have come. They are in need of a new home, and I am sure their mogu allies have promised them much.

We will add this knowledge to your personal collection. If you wish me to narrate this for you, simply point at the correct volume in your Private Collection.

Upon completion of the [[The Zandalari Prophecy]] Pandaria exploration achievement, [[Lorewalker Cho]] sends a letter via the in-game mail system. The letter has an item attached that starts this quest. See the achievement for more details.
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|It is said the [[King Rastakhan|God King Rastakhan]], ruler of the [[Zandalari]], lords over his [[Zuldazar|mighty kingdom]] from a throne carved of solid gold.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Years ago, as he sat on his opulent seat of power, he was visited by his most trusted prophet: [[Zul]].}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Zul warned King Rastakhan of a terrible [[Shattering|Cataclysm]]. For Zul had seen a vision a [[Deathwing|great armored dragon]] clenching the world with his ferocious jaws.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|King Rastakhan did nothing.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Months later, Zul returned, bearing more grim news from his visions. He saw a [[Naga|legion of serpents]] pouring forth from a [[Abyssal Breach|gaping fissure]] that tore open the floor of the [[Abyssal Depths|ocean]].}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Still, King Rastakhan did nothing.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Finally, mere months before the Cataclysm, Zul returned. Tearing his clothes and throwing his staff on the ground. Zul spoke of earthquakes and tidal waves.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|He described the golden capital of Zandalar slowly sinking beneath the waves in the aftermath of the Cataclysm. Its once-great people drowning as their mighty works slipped forever beneath the sea.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|King Rastakhan tired of Zul and his troubling nightmares. To be rid of the prophet, he granted Zul the use of his largest ships, so that he and his followers could seek a new land if his visions came to pass.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|And his visions DID come to pass.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|When Deathwing rose from the [[Maelstrom]], dark, angry waves crashed onto the Zandalari capital. The spine of the land broke in two, and soon, the city and all its riches began to slide into the hungry sea.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The Zandalari people turned to their King for help, but there was only one Zandalari equipped to help them: the prophet Zul. The prophet, and the mighty warfleet he had assembled while his King sat idle.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|You see, the TRUE power of kings and emperors stems from the power to aid their people.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The moment they fall, they cede their power to the one who can.}}
