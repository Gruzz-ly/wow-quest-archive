==Objectives==
Loot 3 [[Mogu]] Plunder from the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Mogu Plunder]] looted (3)

==Description==
Our raids on [[Lei Shen]]'s treasuries did much to ensure the Thunder King's downfall. I think we should employ the same strategy here.

Seek out the hoarded plunder of the mogu [[clan]]s and relieve them of it.

We must do all we can to disrupt their advance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
* 458 [[Azerite (resource)]]
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It's surprising how effective some simple thievery can be.

==Completion==
Well done. We should continue to keep these supplies out of our enemies hands.

Even the smallest measures taken to disrupt our enemy can turn the tide of battle.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.3.0|note=Added.}}
