==Objectives==
Investigate the Mercurial Guardian and obtain the Ancient Korune Tablet.
*Investigate the [[Mercurial Guardian]]
*[[Ancient Korune Tablet]]

==Description==
Too slowly!? We are working as quickly as possible for the Warchief!

We must excavate carefully, catalogue each find, and of course follow safety procedures. He must understand!

Well, we may have something to show him soon. Do you see that stone statue to the west?

We suspect it is an ancient stone storage vessel. Now we just have to find a way to open it.

If you would care to help us with our excavation, please go about it carefully.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +400 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]

==Progress==
We are quite capable of handling this excavation. I understand the Warchief sent you, but he will get faster results if he leaves us to our work.

==Completion==
Hmm... very interesting. This tablet will yield many secrets, indeed.

==Notes==
On Mercurial Guardian Aggro:

On completion, Fanlyr Silverthorn says:

{{text|say|Fanlyr Silverthorn|If I am correct, <name>, then this... Divine Bell... is exactly the type of weapon that Garrosh is looking for. Return to your other duties for now. I will bring this information to the Warchief myself.}}


Fanlyr Silverthorn also sends you a letter and an item in the mail:
[[Reliquary Facsimile]]

{{Book|A Startling Discovery|align=left|content=
Greetings <name>,

Thank you again for you{{sic}} help with out{{sic}} excavation in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.

As expected, Warchief Hellscream was more than pleased to learn of the Empyreal Ledger that you excavated from the stone guardian.

I thought you might be interested in receiving a copy of the relevant factual data you recovered.

I trust, of course, that you will not share this sensitive information with just anyone.
