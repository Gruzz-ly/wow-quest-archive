==Objectives==
Collect 8 Tomes of Ancient Madness from [[k'thir]] enemies in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Tome of Ancient Madness]] (8)

==Description==
In times like these, it becomes necessary for all of the denizens of the vale to pitch in and do their part. Unfortunately, I have never been much of a fighter, so my usefulness in times of war is limited.

However, I may be able to do some good. You see, we know very little about the invaders we face, and knowledge can be a very powerful weapon.

I think I have seen tomes carried by some of the k'thir. If you could bring some to me, I may be able to glean something useful from their writings.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you managed to procure the tomes?

==Completion==
Yes, this is exactly what I was looking for! I'll start researching these at once!

Ah, it's good to feel useful!
