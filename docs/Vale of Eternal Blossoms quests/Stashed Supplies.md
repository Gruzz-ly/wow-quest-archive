==Objectives==
Collect 4 Golden Lotus Supplies from [[Ambered Cache]]s in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Golden Lotus Supplies]] (3)

==Description==
The invading [[mantid]] have been making off with the [[Golden Lotus]]' supplies lately. They're probably hoping they can starve us out.

Well, they may be right if we can't get some of our supplies back.

While you're taking the fight to the swarm, keep an eye out for anywhere they might have stashed our supplies. You'd be doing the Golden Lotus a big favor if you could recover some.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
