==Objectives==
Speak with [[Ra-den]] to return to the Chamber of Heart.
* Return to the [[Chamber of Heart]]

==Description==
Your persistence fills me with hope for [[Azeroth|this world]].

Let us return to your "Chamber of Heart." As the caretaker of the [[Forge of Origination]], I believe I can help your efforts to restore it.

Speak to me when you are ready, and I will bring us there.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:*
|Death-Resistant Leaf
|Focused Star Point}}
<nowiki>*</nowiki>This choice is for classes with a [[Healer (role)|healer]] ''and'' a [[tank]] specialization. Classes with one but not the other will simply receive the appropriate item, while DPS-only classes won't receive an item at all. Classes with both options can buy the other item from [[Zhang Ku]] in [[Mistfall Village]].

You will also receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Champions of Azeroth]]

==Completion==
Not only have we managed tae restore power tae the Forge of Origination, but we even brought back the Titan keeper that originally installed it!

But believe it or not, that's not the end o' the good news!

==Notes==
Speak with Ra-den, where, for once, a quest giver offers a quick path to the objective.
:You have given me hope, and in return I will offer my aid.
:Let me know when you are ready to travel to the Chamber of Heart.

:{{text|say|Ra-den|Long has it been since I last saw the Forge of Origination.}}
:''[[Stormspeaker Qian]] turns around to Ra-den.''
:{{text|say|Ra-den|Stormspeaker, I leave the Rajani in defense of the Engine.}}
:''Qian bows deeply before resuming his post.''
:{{text|say|Stormspeaker Qian|As you command, Highkeeper.}}
:{{text|say|Ra-den|I will take us to the Chamber of Heart. This may prove... disorienting.}}
:''Ra-den teleports the party. Back in the Chamber, he and Magni walk side-by-side into the room, the massive doorway proving to be quite reasonably sized for the keeper.''
:{{text|say|Ra-den|Such a magnificent facility! It looks to be of [[Archaedas]]'s make.}}
:{{text|say|Ra-den|Odd that I was unaware of its existence.}}
:{{text|say|[[MOTHER]]|Knowledge of chamber restricted to sigma-level clearance. Proximity to world soul requires additional safeguards.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Aye, we only found this place because [[Azeroth (titan)|Azeroth]] herself showed us the way!}}
