==Objectives==
Destroy 6 [[Mogu]] Statues in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Mogu Statue]]s destroyed (6)

==Description==
The [[Baruk]] use the forbidden arts of [[necromancy]] to trap [[soul]]s of fallen mogu into the statues that fight for them.

These tactics are a disgrace to our people, and cannot be allowed to continue.

Break their precious statues, and give them no vessels with which to contaminate with their stolen spirits.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

You will also receive one or two from:
{{itembox||q1=50|Coalescing Visions
|q2=250|Coalescing Visions
|q3=70|War Resources
|q4=60|War Resources
}}

==Progress==
What is it, <class>?

==Completion==
As their statues crumble, so too shall their clan.

You have performed adequately.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.3.0|note=Added.}}
