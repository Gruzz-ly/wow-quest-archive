==Notes==
{{Book|Walking Cane of Brewfather Ren Yun|content=A long cane tipped with a head of carved [[whale]]bone, once used by the enigmatic Brewfather, [[Ren Yun]].  Blind since birth, Ren Yun's other senses were heightened.  As a result, he found the brews of his time to be harsh or bitter.  Years of experimentation allowed him to perfect four perfect brews that appealed to each of his other senses.  And yet, the "one brew" that would appeal to all four sense at the same time eluded him.  It was only at the end of his long life that he perfected the [[Tablet of Ren Yun|one master recipe]], "[[Four Senses Brew|The Four Senses Brew]]", that was the most magnificent discovery of his generation.  Sadly the recipe was lost to time, because Ren Yun's handwriting was pretty much illegible.
