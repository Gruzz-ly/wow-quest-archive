==Objectives==
Collect 3 Artifacts of the Black Empire from [[Black Empire Cache]]s in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Artifact of the Black Empire]] (3)

==Description==
I understand that the [[Black Empire]] poses a grave threat to [[Pandaria]], but we may also use this as an opportunity!

Though we've faced them several times before, very little is known about the [[Old God]]s or [[N'Zoth]]'s mysterious [[Plane|realm]] of [[Ny'alotha]]. 

When studying ancient civilizations, we often rely on artifacts to unlock the deepest mysteries lost to time. I wonder if some such artifacts could be found among the Old God's forces?

It can't hurt to check, right?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|186|91}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find anything interesting?

==Completion==
Spendid! Just think of what ancient mysteries we could learn from these artifacts!

I hope you didn't go through too much trouble to get these.
