==Objectives==
Speak with [[Chromie]] outside of the [[Seat of Knowledge]] in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].

==Description==
As you survey the devastation of the vale, a flash of bronze catches your eye. Unless you're mistaken, a tiny gnome is trying to catch your attention from the balcony above Mogu'shan Palace, just outside of the Seat of Knowledge.

You should see what she wants.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|85}}
*59000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The tiny gnome's eyes reflect the light with a copper sheen. She is not what she seems.>

<Name>! I have been waiting for you. The [[bronze dragonflight]] has need of your services.

==Notes==
This quest is automatically offered to players who fly into the [[Shrine of Seven Stars]] in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]] after [[Patch 5.4]] has landed. Chromie can be found staring at a map sitting next to [[Mishi]] outside the entrance to the [[Seat of Knowledge]] directly above the entrance to [[Mogu'shan Palace]].
