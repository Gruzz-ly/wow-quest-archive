==Objectives==
Kill 6 Mantid ambercasters in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Mantid]] ambercasters slain  (6)

==Description==
The ambercasters are among the highest castes of mantid society. Through their [[magic]], they can mend and form [[amber]] to their will, allowing hastened recovery of the mantid's forces after a battle.

They are strategic targets, and we should seek them out.

Care to join us?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
With no one to mend their wounded soldiers, it's only a matter of time before the swarm is driven back to the wastes.

You did well.

==Notes==
