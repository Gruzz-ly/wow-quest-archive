Collect 12 pieces of Salvaged Mogu Armor from [[mogu]] enemies in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].

==Description==
The warring [[clan]]s are relentless and our [[warrior]]s are going through armor faster than I can keep it repaired.

If you find yourself in battle with the other clans, see if you can salvage any undamaged armor pieces from their [[soldier]]s. We should not let good resources go to waste.
