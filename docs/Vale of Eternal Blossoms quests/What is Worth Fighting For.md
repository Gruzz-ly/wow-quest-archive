==Notes==
Upon completion of the [[What Is Worth Fighting For]] Pandaria [[exploration achievement]], [[Lorewalker Cho]] sends a letter via the in-game mail system. The letter has an item attached that starts this quest. Upon turning in the quest, the following story is told to the player:
: <vplayer/>
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|What is the source of YOUR power? Think carefully before you answer. Many adventurers point to their weapons, or their equipment, or to tomes of arcane might.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Long ago, when [[Pandaren|my people]] were slaves of the [[mogu empire]], we were forbidden from carrying any weapon at all. We were not fighters. And no one believed we could fight the mogu without magic and steel.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Until [[Kang]], the Fist of First Dawn, opened our eyes.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|One day, the beloved [[monk]] issued a challenge to his fellow slaves. "Hit me!" he called out.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Surprised, the beleaguered Pandaren slaves tried to strike Kang. One by one they failed, for he intercepted their blows like a dancer and sidestepped their attacks like a reed in the wind.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|"Our backs are hardened by the whips of the mogu." he told them. "Our arms are powerful from building their fortresses. Our minds are sharp from working alongside our enemy. You think the mogu are stronger? I say we are their strength!"}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The farmers, the bricklayers, the shepherds and the smiths... they all bowed before Kang. "Teach us," they said. "Teach us to fight."}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|And when they rose... they rose as warriors.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Your voice. Your hands. THESE are the tools of true heroes. Use them well... and you can change the world.}}
