==Objectives==
Kill 7 [[Squidtail tribe|Squidtail]] [[hozen]] in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Squidtail Screamer]] slain (7)

==Description==
The Hozen are opportunistic and weak. It does not surprise me that some of their kind have thrown their lot in with the [[Old God]]s.

We should take care of them before they become more than a nuisance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*17,850 [[XP]]
*+250 reputation with [[Rajani]]
*325 [[Coalescing Visions]]
*[[Glowing Azerite Geode]] (311 - 483 [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Well?

==Completion==
Good. The Vale is better off without their filth. 

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.3.0|note=Added.}}
