==Objectives==
Speak to [[Fanlyr Silverthorn]] at [[Ancestral Rise]] in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].

==Description==
I am told that the mogu once possessed hundreds of hidden armories full of earth-shattering weapons.

When a [[mogu]] army prepared for war, they struck fear and terror into the hearts of their enemies.

THIS is the knowledge I seek here on [[Pandaria]]!

I have sent an expedition to study some ruins to the west, but they work as slowly as dim-witted peons!

Go speak to Fanlyr Silverthorn, their leader. Tell him that I want to see results immediately.

You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236,000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]

==Completion==
The Warchief sent you? What does he say?
