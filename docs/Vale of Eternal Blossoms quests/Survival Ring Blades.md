==Objectives==
Enter the Survival Ring and survive for 60 seconds without leaving.
*Live through the Survival Ring for 60 seconds

==Description==
This is one of the challenges I put upon my warriors during peaceful times to keep them strong and fast. Let's see how you fare.

Survive the ring for 60 seconds without getting pushed out or killed. Stay on your toes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Golden Lotus]]

==Progress==
The constant danger in the ring prepares us for life or death fighting we have to endure outside the wall.

==Completion==
Not bad, <class>. Not bad at all.

==Notes==
Just to the northwest. Shado-Pan Trainers are running paths through the spinning blades. They move at 110% run speed and will push players out of their way into the blades. Avoid them.

==Progression==
