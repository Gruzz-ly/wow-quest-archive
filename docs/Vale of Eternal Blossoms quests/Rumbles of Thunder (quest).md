*[[Rumbles of Thunder (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
Dear <name>,

The foreboding sound of thunder has haunted my people for generations. And as you have discovered in your own research, [[Lei Shen]] is at the heart of that fear.

If you visit us at the [[Seat of Knowledge]] in [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]] we can add this contribution to your personal collection.

Thank you for your diligence!

Sincerely,

Lorewalker Cho

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
* 236000 XP
* +2850 reputation with [[The Lorewalkers]]

==Completion==
What we know of Lei Shen are dark legends that have been remembered over the vast span of time. I often wondered if these legends had exaggerated the power of Lei Shen. But your research would suggest they may have greatly underestimated the Thunder King. These are dark days indeed.

We will add this knowledge to your collection. If you wish me to narrate this for you, simply point at the correct volume in your Private Collection.

:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|The mogu tell a legend about [[Lei Shen]], the Thunder King.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|It is said that he tore out the very heart of the [[Ra-den|mogu God]]. And from that hateful act he gained power over wind and storm.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|His followers fell to their knees before him. "We will call you 'The Lightning King,'" they said.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|But Lei Shen did not agree.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|"Lightning strikes in an instant and is over in a flash," he said.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|"But thunder. Thunder! Thunder proclaims the coming of the storm."}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|"Thunder quakes the skies long before the lightning strikes, and thunder echoes in the hills long after lightning's power is spent."}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|"It is thunder that sends animals cowering and fills the hearts of peasants with dread. Let thunder be my herald, so that my power is felt throughout the land."}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|"I will be... The Thunder King."}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Oh my friend - that awful sound. For a hundred hundred generations the crash of thunder filled the hearts of pandaren with terror.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|It is said that after the revolution, the [[Chi-Ji|Red Crane of Hope]] placed the rainbow in the sky, so that pandaren would know not to fear the storms any longer.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|I do not see any rainbows today. Do you?}}
