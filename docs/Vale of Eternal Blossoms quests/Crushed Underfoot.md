==Objectives==
Squash 10 Vil'thik Larvae in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Vil'thik Larva]] squashed (10)

==Description==
In the past, the [[mantid]] would safeguard their hatchlings in incubation chambers until they were ready to be tested in the swarm.

These [[Vil'thik]] are sloppy, however, allowing their [[larva]]e to scurry out in the open.

Wouldn't it be a shame if someone crushed them?

No, of course it wouldn't.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==

==Completion==
Ah to see the future of your enemy crushed underfoot.

It is a good feeling, is it not?
