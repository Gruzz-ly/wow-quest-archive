==Objectives==
Kill 6 faceless minions of [[N'Zoth]] in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[N'raqi|Faceless]] minions slain (6)

==Description==
The n'raqi have long served as the [[Commander (rank)|commanders]] and taskmasters of the [[Old God]]s' forces. Their presence on the field of battle shows that this invasion is a coordinated effort rather than a random outbreak of corruption.

Led by these faceless masters, the chaotic forces of the Old Gods transform into capable military.

We must make it a priority to fell these creatures. Only then might we take the upper hand against [[N'Zoth]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
