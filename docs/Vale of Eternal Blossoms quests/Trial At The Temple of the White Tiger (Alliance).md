== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Xuen}} at the [[Temple of the White Tiger]] in [[Kun-Lai Summit]].

== Description ==
Xuen, the great [[August Celestial|Celestial]] of the North, seeks the greatest champions in the land.

Today, he holds trials of battle at his temple in Kun-Lai Summit.

If you wish to test yourself against skilled fighters from all across [[Pandaria]], then go to him and enter the challenger's ring!

== Progress ==
''When you get close enough, Xuen will announce:''
: {{text|say|Xuen|Welcome, Challengers, to my Tournament of Strength!}}

== Completion ==
So you wish to test your skills? Very good, <race>.

== Notes ==
Head north from the vale to the northeast corner of [[Kun-Lai Summit]] to reach the [[Temple of the White Tiger]], south of the [[Zouchin Province]]. Xuen is down close to the entrance, near the [[Grummle Bazaar]].
