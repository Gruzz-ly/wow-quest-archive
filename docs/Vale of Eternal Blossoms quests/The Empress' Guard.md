==Objectives==
Kill 8 Zara'thik mantid in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Zara'thik]] [[mantid]] slain  (8)
* Suggested players: 3

==Description==
The Zara'thik are the [[Grand Empress Shek'zara|empress]]' elite guard. Empowered with plundered [[:Azerite]], they will stop at nothing short of absolute conquest of all of [[Pandaria]].

If we allow them to advance past the [[Serpent's Spine|Serpent's spine]], the [[Golden Lotus]] will be no match for them.

Stop them at the wall, <class>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
* {{cost|we=55}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must break the Zara'thik advance!

==Completion==
You seem to have halted their advance. That will have to do for now.

I'll alert you if if the situation worsens.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Zara'thik Hive-Guard]]s, [[Zara'thik Skirmisher]]s, and [[Zara'thik Soldier]]s.
