==Objectives==
Destroy 6 Amber Vessels in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
*[[Amber Vessel]] (6)

==Description==
The [[mantid]] use [[amber]] in nearly all aspects of their lives, from the structures they live in to the weapons they wield. Of course, I'm more interested in the latter.

If we can deprive the mantid of their materials, we will deprive them of their means to create implements of war.

Find where they keep their amber and make sure they are unable to use it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must press every advantage against the mantid.

==Completion==
Without their precious amber, the mantid will be unable to resupply.

Well done, <class>.
