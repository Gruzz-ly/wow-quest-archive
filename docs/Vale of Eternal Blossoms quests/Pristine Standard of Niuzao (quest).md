{{Book|Standard of Niuzao|content=A spool of thick canvas that, when held aloft, unfurls to reveal a proud emblem of the Pandaren Empire. Heavy iron rings dangle from long ribbons of leather affixed along the bottom, pulling the banner taut. Stitched into each strip of leather is a reminder for the standard-bearer:  "Fear seeks to diminish you. / Instead, let it reveal you."
