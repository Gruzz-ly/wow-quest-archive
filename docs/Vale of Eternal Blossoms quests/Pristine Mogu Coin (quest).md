==Notes==
{{Book|Mogu Coin|content=This currency was used during the reign of mogu emperor Wai, who is depicted in all his snarling glory.  The reverse of the coin depicts the changing of Mogu dynasties, a bloody process wherein the previous regime must be overpowered and executed.  In many ways, ancient Mogu government was a meritocracy, based on brutal strength and terrible cunning.
