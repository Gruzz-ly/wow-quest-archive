==Objectives==
Kill 4 Onyx Warserpents in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Onyx Warserpent]] slain (4)
* Suggested players: 3

==Description==
Where the [[Zan-Tien clan|Zan-Tien]] march, the warserpents are sure to follow.

I cannot stress to you enough how dangerous these beasts are. It is a shame to see them subjugated by the [[mogu]], but we cannot afford to let them run rampant.

I need you to put them down before they can wreak havoc on our lines.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
* {{cost|wr=50}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you taken care of the serpents?

==Completion==
It is unfortunate to see the cloud serpents cut down, but the Zan-Tien have driven them beyond recovery.

Don't worry, we'll make them pay.
