==Objectives==
Bring the Mysterious Mogu Sigil to [[Lorewalker Cho]] at the [[Seat of Knowledge]] in [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].

==Description==
<The slain [[mogu]] clutches a sigil in his hand -- a symbol of the mysterious [[clan]] he belongs to.

Perhaps if you could track down his clan, they may know more about the [[mantid]]'s invasion of [[Mogu'shan Vaults]] and how they can be overcome.

Lorewalker Cho is well known as font of lore for [[Pandaria]]. He may be able to track down the origins of the mogu's sigil.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So Mogu'shan Vaults has been taken by the mantid? A strange turn indeed, though hardly surprising.

Seeking the help of the mogu to reclaim it though, that is unexpected. Last I heard, they weren't precisely on speaking terms.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Hmm. If this mogu's clan is anything like him... Maybe they'd be willin' tae help us.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I dunnae know the first thing about mogu clan sigils. But I bet Lorewalker Cho does! I'll meet ye at the Seat of Knowledge.}}

;Approaching Cho
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Ah, champion! Just as new dangers threaten Pandaria, her heroes make a triumphant return!}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|This will surely be a tale to remember. But enough prattling. How can I help?}}
