==Objectives==
Return to [[Stormspeaker Qian]] at the [[Silent Sanctuary]].

==Description==
The [[mantid]] have been corrupting their [[kypari tree]]s to imbue their [[amber]] with power from [[N'Zoth]]. The swarm is enough of a menace on its own. N'Zoth could transform them into something even more dire.

The [[Shado-Pan]] need to hear about this. I suggest you bring this information to your other allies as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* [[Radiant Azerite Matrix]] (1,500 [[Azerite (resource)]])
* +1,000 reputation with [[Rajani]]

==Completion==
That the mantid would give their own kypari trees over to corruption speaks volumes of their loyalty to N'Zoth.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
