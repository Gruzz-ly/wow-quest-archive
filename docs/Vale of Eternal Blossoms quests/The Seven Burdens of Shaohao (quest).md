Dear <name>,

It would seem you have discovered the full tale of [[Shaohao]], the last emperor of Pandaria.

Lorewalker Cho

This is a story I have long sought to uncover.  Ever since the [[Sha]] was released I have felt in my belly that this tale was at the heart of it all.

==Notes==
[[File:Emperor Shaohao.jpg|thumb|Emperor Shaohao.]]
Upon completion of the [[The Seven Burdens of Shaohao]] Pandaria [[exploration achievement]], [[Lorewalker Cho]] sends a letter via the in-game mail system. The letter has an item attached that starts this quest. See the achievement for more details.

:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Ah! You wish to learn of our last and greatest emperor, [[Emperor Shaohao|Shaohao]]? My friend, I do not have the time here to recount all of his adventures, but his actions ten thousand years ago resonate to this very day.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|We know that he purged his [[Sha of Doubt|doubts]] in the [[Jade Forest]]. That he cleansed himself of [[Sha of Despair|despair]] in the [[Krasarang Wilds]]. That he overcame his [[Sha of Fear|fear]] in [[Townlong Steppes]]. And that he defeated [[Sha of Anger|anger]], [[Sha of Hatred|hatred]], and [[Sha of Violence|violence]] high in the mountains of [[Kun-Lai Summit|Kun-Lai]].}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|This is known; and there are temples to mark these most sacred of places.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|But I want you to imagine standing in this very [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms|valley]] on the day he returned from his journey. Imagine being here when the gates opened for him. By then our emperor was a creature of pure light: No doubts, no fears, no hatred...}}
:''As Cho speaks, various ghostly figures appear near him to represent his words. Statues of each of the four [[August Celestial]]s to represent their temples, great gates for the entrance of the Vale, blossoming trees when Shaohao arrives...''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|It is said that all the trees in the vale blossomed as he entered, and continue to blossom to this day.}}
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Would that we could all live like our most sacred emperor. That we could put aside all our burdens and exist in harmony with the cosmos. THAT, I believe, was his message to us... before he became one with the land, and hid [[Pandaria]] away from the terror of the [[Great Sundering|Sundering]].}}
:''Shaohao's ghostly figure starts praying and then disappears.''
:{{text|say|Lorewalker Cho|Thank you, dear emperor.}}
