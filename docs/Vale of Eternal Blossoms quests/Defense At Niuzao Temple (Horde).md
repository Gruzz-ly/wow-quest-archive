== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Ogo the Elder}} at [[Niuzao Temple]] in the [[Townlong Steppes]].

== Description ==
Niuzao Temple, far to the west, is under attack by the [[mantid]].

The great Celestial holds them back for now, but he cannot stand alone forever.

Go and help the defenders, <class>. The Temple must not fall!

== Completion ==
Well met, <class>! We need your help.

== Notes ==
Fly all the way west to Niuzao Temple. The closest flight path is at the [[Shado-Pan Garrison]], which has other level 90 daily quests.

While heading over to the temple from the direction of the garrison, note {{NPC||Ku-Mo}} just off the island end of the bridge. If not already done, he offers [[My Father's Crossbow]], a quick side-chain.
