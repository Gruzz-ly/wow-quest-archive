==Objectives==
[[File:Krik'thik Swarmer.jpg|thumb|[[Krik'thik Swarmer]].]]
Kill 30 Krik'thik Swarmers using a Setting Sun Turret.
*[[Krik'thik Swarmer]] slain (30)

==Description==
We have cannons set up on the top of the towers flanking the main gate. They are our best method clear the skies when the flying [[mantid]] try to pass over the wall, like they are now.

You've impressed me, and I promised I'd save some of the best jobs for you. Here you go - I need you to man one of the cannons.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236,000 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Golden Lotus]]

==Progress==
It was on the wall where I earned my reputation. It was on the wall where I met the Shado-Pan that stand beside us in this valley. That wall made me what I am.

==Completion==
You've got good aim, <class>. I'll remember that the next time the fliers come.

==Notes==
Fly up to the wall and hop in a cannon. It has one ability:
*{{abilities|Setting Sun Turret Shot|range=300|Anti-Mantid projectile.|notes=Instant.|cd=0.2 sec}}
Kills will generally take two hits.

In [[Patch 5.4]], all Golden Lotus dailies were removed that were not associated with certain achievements. However, this daily quest remains in the game despite not being attached to an achievement. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown.

==Progression==
{{Golden Lotus dailies|step=2b}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 5.4.0|note=Moved from [[Leven Dawnblade]] to [[Kun Autumnlight]].}}
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
