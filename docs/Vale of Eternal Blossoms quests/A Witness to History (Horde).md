Exit the temple and bank right to get to the flight master across the bridge. Fly to [[Eastwind Rest]] and run due southwest to get to the gate. Speak with Dezco:
:This is a historic moment, <name>. What do you think lies beyond the gates?
:{{gossip|Let's find out!}}
:''A cutscene begins as the camera pulls back to show a wide view of the [[Gate of the August Celestials]]. The four [[August Celestial]]s arrive, setting up in front of the gate: [[Niuzao]] stands sentinel in front of the right statue as [[Chi-Ji]] does the same on the left.  [[Xuen]] walks up, directly facing the doors as [[Yu'lon]] flys up and hovers to the left of Xuen as all of the onlookers kneel before them.  Sunwalker Dezco walks up to flank Xuen's left as [[Anduin Wrynn]] does the same on the right.  As they also kneel, the player phases in between them and kneels as well.''
:{{text|say|Yu'lon|Children of Pandaria. The mists have fallen. A new era dawns for us all. Accept the healing powers of this Vale... but use these gifts wisely.}}
:''Xuen steps forward and makes a deep, earth-trembling roar, at which the gates' inner gear system unlocks and the doors swing forward on their own. The onlookers rise as one and start filtering in.''

After the cutscene
:{{text|say|Yu'lon|Let us draw ourselves together to rebuild this sacred place, the first step toward healing a war-torn world.}}
:{{text|say|Niuzao|These outsiders have brought chaos to this land. Can we trust them to set it right?}}
:''Chi'ji and Xuen's lines remain the same.''

The Kun-Lai Refugees have had their lines removed and despawn shortly after entering the now-ruined Vale. [[Madam Vee Luo]] also ends this quest and the quest chain, explaining after turn-in where a player can go.

:{{text|say|Madam Vee Luo|Welcome, traveler. Make your home here if you wish. Upstairs you will find the bank vaults and the city portals. Vendors of all trades have set up shop around the building. Please explore at your own leisure.}}

;Description
I will gather up the other tauren pilgrims and we will travel into the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms|Vale]] together. We can set up a [[Horde]] outpost in there to act as our embassy with the pandaren.

Meet me at the Gate of the August Celestials at the southern edge of [[Kun-Lai Summit]] and speak with me there.

;Completion
Thank you for coming so quickly.

For thousands of years, the Golden Lotus has kept the Vale safe from those who would seek its power.

Unfortunately, that time is past, and we need your help.

;Dialogue
When the cutscene ended, the script event continued:
:{{text|say|Yu'lon|We risk everything, allowing so many into the Vale.}}
:{{text|say|Chi-Ji|I have faith in our friends from beyond the mists.}}
:{{text|say|Xuen|Their strength is an inspiration... and sorely needed. We must trust that their hearts are pure.}}
:''The four celestials depart.''

On the other side of the cutscene, run through the now-opened gate to reach the [[Golden Stair]]. Follow the line of refugees, who say something as the adventurer passes:
*{{text|say|Kun-Lai Refugee|I've always wondered what lies behind these gates.}}
*{{text|say|Kun-Lai Refugee|Just look at this place! It's amazing!}}
*{{text|say|Kun-Lai Refugee|To have witnessed the opening of the gates... it is a tale I will pass down to my children's children.}}
*{{text|say|Kun-Lai Refugee|I heard some hero from a far away land convinced Xuen, the tiger god, to open the Vale. Maybe I'll see them someday.}}
*{{text|say|Kun-Lai Refugee|I heard all kinds of stories about what lay behind the gate. I never imagined it would be something like this.}}
*{{text|say|Kun-Lai Refugee|Perhaps we can find a new home here in the Vale.}}
*{{text|say|Kun-Lai Refugee|The Shado-Pan told us this would be a safe haven for all the refugees from Kun-Lai. Perhaps here, we shall finally find peace.}}
*{{text|say|Kun-Lai Refugee|Was this really the home of the ancient emperors of Pandaria? It is beautiful.}}
