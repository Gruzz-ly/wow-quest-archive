==Objectives==
Collect a Mogu Scouting Report from [[mogu]] in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Mogu Scouting Report]]

==Description==
Now that we have an idea of who we're looking for, the next question is, where can we find them?

With the constant infighting of the mogu, it is likely that each [[clan]] would keep tabs on the whereabouts of their competitors. If we can find such information, it may just lead us to the [[Rajani]].

Seek out the champions of the mogu. They would be the most likely to carry reports on their enemies' whereabouts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found a scouting report?

==Completion==
Excellent. Not only might this lead us to the Rajani, but it will prove valuable to the [[Golden Lotus]]'s defense efforts.

This is valuable information indeed!

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|Say|[[Magni Bronzebeard]]|I'll stay with the Lorewalker and ask what he knows about the Vaults. Good luck with the mogu!}}

;On complete
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Ye've found the Rajani? Excellent!}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Let's just hope they'll put down their spears long enough tae hear us out.}}

Magni offers the next quest, [[Time-Lost Warriors]].
