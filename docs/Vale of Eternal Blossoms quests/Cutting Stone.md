==Objectives==
Collect 10 [[Mogu]] Armaments in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Mogu Armament]] (10)

==Description==
One problem with waging war against other mogu is that weapons dull and break very quickly when used against foes of stone and metal.

Being the sole [[Smith|blacksmith]] among the [[Rajani]], it is sometimes difficult to keep up with our [[warrior]]s needs.

If you come across any weapons in your battles with the mogu, I'm sure I could put them to good use.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you found?

==Completion==
These weapons look to be in good enough shape.

They will serve our warriors well.
