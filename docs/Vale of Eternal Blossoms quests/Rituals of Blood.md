==Objectives==
Destroy 6 Blood Fonts in the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].
* [[Blood Font (Vale of Eternal Blossoms)|Blood Fonts]] destroyed (6)

==Description==
[[Anji Autumnlight|Anji]] and I have fought in many battles, so we know how to handle a few [[mogu]], but the [[blood magic]] used by these [[Dokani]] is just unsettling!

As if it weren't bad enough for them to kill everyone in their path, but to use their corpses to fuel their unholy rituals? I just can't stomach it!

Do me a favor. If you ever come across any of these rituals, put a stop to them! Even our enemies don't deserve to be defiled with their dark magic.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* {{cost|cv=250}}
* 379 [[Azerite (resource)]]
*  17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hope you were able to do something about those rituals.

==Completion==
It is a relief to know that you've put an end to those rituals.

Just thinking about them turns my stomach.
