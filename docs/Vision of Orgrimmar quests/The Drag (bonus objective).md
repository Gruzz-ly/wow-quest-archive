;Entering the area
:{{Text|yell|[[Inquisitor Gnshal]]|Kill the orc and scour the [[Drag]]! All who refuse the [[N'Zoth|master's]] blood shall suffer!}}

*{{Text|say|Garona Halforcen|I don't feel any pain. Unless I move...}}
*{{Text|say|Garona Halforcen|I had things under control... for the most part.}}

;Speaking with Garona
:The faceless are dragging civilians out of their homes and forcing them to drink N'Zoth's blood. Any who refuse are tortured and slain.

:Some survivors are still hiding throughout the Drag. We need to find them and get them out of Orgrimmar.

:{{Gossip|You have my aid. <Help Garona up>}}
:{{Text|say|Garona Halforcen|Let's search the Drag for survivors. I'll conceal any we find while you keep the enemy at bay.}}
:{{Text|say|Garona Halforcen|There's a teleporter on the other side of the Drag. I just hope it still works.}}

As you move through the area, click on [[Barricade (Vision of Orgrimmar)|Barricades]]. 

;At Gotri's Traveling Gear
:{{Text|say|Garona Halforcen|See if there's anyone here.}}

[[Gotri]] is found dead.

:{{Text|say|Garona Halforcen|Another casualty. Let's move along.}}
:{{Text|say|Garona Halforcen|Check the tailoring shop and orphanage for survivors. I'll keep watch.}}

Work your way through the shops and the [[K'thir Dominator]]s, [[Faceless Shadowcaller]]s, and [[Voidbound Ravager]]s mobs.

;At Magar's Cloth Goods
:{{Text|yell|[[Borya]]|Help! [[Snang]]'s gone mad!}}

;Snang killed
:{{Text|say|Borya|He... was our friend...}}
:{{Text|say|[[Magar]]|It was him or us...}}

;At Orgrimmar Orphanage

:{{Text|say|[[Roxxik]]|We're up and running! Come on!}}
