== Objectives ==
Gather 8 Bloated Kelp Bulbs hanging under the southern terrace.
*[[Bloated Kelp Bulb]] x8

== Description ==
Hello! I've been scrambling, scrambling to prepare for the {{NPC||Admiral Dvorek||Admiral's}} assault. He's got high hopes and high plans to blow all kinds of things sky high! ...or water high? That would do.

Blowing things high takes EXPLOSIVES! I don't have explosives. It's saddening. Very saddening.

I've been properly inspired to improvise though, and the solution has become apparent. The bulbs on the seaweed hanging from the ruins contain a surprisingly volatile gas. Maybe you might gather some for me? Pretty Please?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Tick, tock, tick, tock. Always in such a hurry. No time for innovation. What I wouldn't give for a lab again!

== Completion ==
You are brave indeed! I've seen you battling all manner of murloc, naga, and pointy-toothed fish, but that was nothing! The way you just sling those kelp bulbs under your arm like that is a new kind of fearless. BOOM! You could blow up at any second.

You're my kind of <race>.

== Notes ==
Head to the tunnel where the Alliance forward post is to the southwest, if Horde. Look up. See the kelp hanging from the ceiling. Inspect closely. There are big balls of kelp hanging near the bottom of the kelp strands.
