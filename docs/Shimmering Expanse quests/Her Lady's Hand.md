== Objectives ==
Defeat the opponents of 8 Naz'jar Honor Guard on the field of battle and deliver their new orders.

This task is part of a {{NPC||Naz'jar Battlemaiden}} vision. If needed, use the [[Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden]] at a time focus to return to the vision.
*{{NPC||Naz'jar Honor Guard}} relieved x8

== Description ==
Battlemaiden!

Find my Honor Guard upon the field of battle and relive them of their foes. I need them to return to guard the {{NPC||Sira'kess Tide Priestess||priestesses}} immediately!

I will hold the entrance. Be swift!

== Progress ==
I dispatched my Honor Guard when the fighting broke out. They are better equipped to deal with the chaos of this kind of battle, and I am hardly in need of their aid.

== Completion ==
Well done, Battlemaiden.

I will attend to the eastern brdige. I need you to attend the temple itself. The ritual must not be interrupted.

== Notes ==
All of the honor guards are busy fighting. Get them out of combat...
