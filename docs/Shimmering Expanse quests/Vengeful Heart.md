== Objectives ==
Kill 10 Zin'jatar Ravagers.
*[[Zin'jatar Ravager]] slain x10

== Description ==
These are the naga that took our people. I only need one to interrogate, kill the rest.

Show no mercy, <class>, for they would surely show us none.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
These naga have ignited a fire in me that is not easily quenched.

== Completion ==
Good to have a real warrior at my side. Too often, my shaman brethren can't seem to stomach the work.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Vortex (Vashj'ir)]] before heading out. Use the globes to kill the snakes before the ravagers can call them. Called ravagers will not get picked up by the vortexes.

==Progression==
