== Objectives ==
Retrieve the [[Crucible of Nazsharin]].

This task is part of a {{NPC||Naz'jar Battlemaiden}} vision. If needed, use the [[Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden]] at a time focus to return to the vision.

== Description ==
Our {{NPC||Lady Naz'jar||revered lady}} has sent me to aid you in your task. She wants you to retrieve the stolen Crucible of Nazsharin and bring it back here as soon as you can.

She grows impatient to start the ritual of summoning so that we might fully begin our preparations for war.

== Completion ==
The crucible looks far too heavy to carry on your own, but more than enough naga forces remain to prepare it for transport.

== Notes ==
Keep heading southwest. At the third marked temple on the zone map is {{NPC||Executioner Verathress}}. Do his side quest, [[Setting An Example]], then head south into the building to find the Crucible.
