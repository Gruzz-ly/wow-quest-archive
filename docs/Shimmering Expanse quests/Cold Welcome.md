== Objectives ==
Kill 10 Glimmerdeep Tidehunters.
*[[Glimmerdeep Tidehunter]] slain x10

== Description ==
Many of the survivors made their way down into [[Glimmerdeep Gorge]] to help with clam diving. We've been receiving reports back of deliberate attacks from some kind of [[murloc]]s down there.

The {{NPC||Admiral Dvorek||Admiral}} has to stay here as more men report in from the shell, so I'm having trouble convincing him to get any significant muscle to help the divers. If you'd be up for it, I'm certain they could use your help.

Come back and let me know if you get the situation under control.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Let me know if you get things taken care of down there. We're stretched pretty thin and I'm getting worried about the safety of the divers.

== Completion ==
Thank you for stepping up to take care of this, <class>. I know there are a lot of concerns swarming us right now, but maintaining the safety of the survivors is paramount.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[A Powerful Need To Eat]] before heading out. Exit the cavern and circle around to the northwest to reach Glimmerdeep. The murlocs are on the west side of the gorge, while the divers are on the east side. The divemaster is close to the shipwreck near the east end of the gorge. Talk to the divemaster and pick up the quests there before killing the deep sea murlocs. Save turning this quest in until getting sent back in [[Bellies Await]].
