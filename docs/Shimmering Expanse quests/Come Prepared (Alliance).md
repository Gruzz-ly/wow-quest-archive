==Objectives==
Retrieve an Alliance Survival Kit.
*[[Alliance Survival Kit]]

==Description==
We must always come prepared. Prepared with gear. Prepared with plans. Prepared with gear plans!

All of the ships in all of the Alliance fleets stow a survival kit. A lot of our tools came from a survival kit. My balloon came from a survival kit too! But now it's gone. I need another survival kit!

There's a ship to the southeastish. Let's hope that the survivors were dumb and didn't take the survival kit. More survival kit for us!

==Progress==
A whole big box is amazing That's what it is. I need more amazing in my life.

Don't worry, I'll share.

==Completion==
Let me see, let me see... flare gun... balloon... no rope. Never any rope. Terribly impractical if you do ask me. Rope should be mandatory.
