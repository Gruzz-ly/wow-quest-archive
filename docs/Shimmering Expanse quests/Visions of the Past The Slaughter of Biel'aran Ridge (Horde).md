== Objectives ==
Witness the continuing story of the Battlemaiden by using her broken blade at the site of the Kvaldir General's death.
*Witness the Contuing Story of the Battlemaiden

== Description ==
Look, I know this is asking a lot during a time like this, but I need you to tear yourself away from this defeat for a moment.

I will tend to these soldiers - you will need to find the location of that battle with the Kvaldir General to the west that you told me about. You should be able to glimpse more of the Battlemaiden's experiences from there. I have a strong feeling that the key to defeating these naga will lie with that Battlemaiden.

Please hurry - I will do everything I can to buy you time.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Battlemaiden's Vision|Grips of the Kvaldir|Kvaldir Battle Standard|Ancient Beth'moran Cloak}}
You will also receive: {{cost|31|20}}

== Progress ==
I know it's a hard request to heed - a whim in a time of dire consequences. You just have to trust me. More than anything right now, we need to know why the naga are here and what they are capable of.

== Completion ==
You've finished! Just in time. I don't think we could have held them much longer.

An artifact? Could this be something we can use against the naga? I suppose that we would require finding it.

We may have to attend to more pressing matters first, until an opportunity to pursue this further presents itself.

== Notes ==
Swim due west through the tunnel to the site of the general's death. There's another big glowing ball there now, a second [[Vision of the Battlemaiden]], at {{coords|28.9|78.7|Shimmering Expanse}}. Use the [[Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden]] at the time focus to resume the storyline. Details are in the [[By Her Lady's Word]] article, the quest offered by {{NPC||Lady Naz'jar}}.


When you enter the vision, Lady Naz'jar speaks:
:{{text|say|Lady Naz'jar|The Kvaldir have been purged from the city. Now we begin our preparations.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Naz'jar|Battlemaiden, I have a task that requires your attention.}}

when you return from the vision (likely on the conclusion of [[The Culmination of Our Efforts]]):
:{{text|say|Wavespeaker Tulra|Thank the waves, you're back! The others have already retreated, we need to get out of here!}}

Wavespeaker Tulra will be accompanied by a few of the surviving Horde Attack Volunteers.
