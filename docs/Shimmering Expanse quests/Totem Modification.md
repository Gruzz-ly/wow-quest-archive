==Objectives==
Plant one of {{NPC||The Great Sambino||Sambino's}} modified totems in the sand of [[Silver Tide Trench]].
*Drill Sample Taken

==Description==
Okay, I'll let you in on the real work, since you're looking at me so desperately.

This rock is untapped! It's probably richer than a trade prince during a great war! I need samples. More samples. Samples from everywhere!

I've modified my earth totems to drill through the sand and store samples of the rock underneath. Go find a nice spot and plan one.

The shaking and rumbling will probably attract all the cute, curious wildlife, so maybe you can make some friends while you're at it.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Drill-Guide Belt|Rockbite Slicer|Sambino's Old Hammer}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
Bah! There's sand in my helmet. It itches!

==Completion==
Another sample. Brilliant! The rocky riches of the sea shall soon be mine!

==Notes==
Talk to Sambino before taking off. Players can ask for a {{item|Sambino's Modified Earthbind Totem|Earthbind}}, {{item|Sambino's Modified Stoneclaw Totem|Stoneclaw}}, {{item|Sambino's Modified Strength of Earth Totem|Strength of Earth}}, {{item|Sambino's Modified Stoneskin Totem|Stoneskin}} or Earth Elemental Totem. Choosing one of the first three options will give players the requested totem along with one of the following responses:
*{{text|say|The Great Sambino|Jeeze... would you like me to have {{NPC||Felice}} give you a massage while you're at it? Here, take it. Go get me my sample!}}
*{{text|say|The Great Sambino|Well you're a picky little <race>, aren't you? Fine. Just go get me that sample.}}
*{{text|say|The Great Sambino|Wait a second... who's working for who here? If I give you the new totem, will you just finish the darn task?}}
Asking for a Earth Elemental totem, on the other hand...
:{{text|say|The Great Sambino|No. Stop being greedy.}}
Plant the totem at least 40 yards away from any other modified totems. A few crabs and eels spawn, then finally an {{NPC||Enormous Sand Crab}} will spawn. Kill the enormous crab, which has ~92,853 HP, to complete the quest.
