== Objectives ==
Find and speak to {{NPC||Admiral Dvorek}} under the southern terrace in the [[Ruins of Vashj'ir]].

Use Wavespeaker Valoren's sea horse to reach the forward post quickly.

== Description ==
The Admiral used the information you gathered for him to make a forward post under the terrace to our west. He's been preparing there for some kind of attack against the naga.

You should go to him immediately and inform him of the scope of what you've witnessed. Our force is small, and I fear for our soldiers if we charge in too recklessly.

Take my sea horse. It knows the way.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||78}}

== Completion ==
Good to see you again, <class>. I almost thought we'd lost you to the {{NPC||Wavespeaker Valoren||Wavespeaker's}} fool errand.

Did anything come of it?

== Notes ==
Hop on the seahorse for a quick ride directly to the forward post. There's a building with an aiery barrier inside that lets the force breathe at {{coords|33.2|68.4|Shimmering Expanse}}.
