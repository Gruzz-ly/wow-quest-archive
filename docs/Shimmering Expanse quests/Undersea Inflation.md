== Objectives ==
Fil one of {{NPC||The Great Sambino||Sambino's}} Air Balloons and find his Lost Air Valve.
*Fill {{NPC||Sambino's Air Balloon}}
*[[Sambino's Air Valve]]
*[[Sambino's Air Balloon]] (provided)

== Description ==
Fine! Fine. You argued me into it. You can help.

I'm leaking air worse than a [[zeppelin]] stuffed with [[quilboar]]! My air valve must have come loose somewhere in the trench.

I brought spare air balloons - make yourself useful and go fill one up, will ya? And find my valve! I'll need that too.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
If only air weren't so darn floaty! Or if only those [[breath|water breathing]] spells came with stylish helmets! Either would do nicely.

== Completion ==
Ya know, I should have given you a weight belt so that you wouldn't just float away, air balloon and all. Lucky for me you came down here with armor and all! Hah!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Crabby Patrons]] before heading out. There are plenty of shells and sponges that are bubbling air. Use the item near the air source. It'll take 10. The [[Green Sand Crab]]s have a chance of dropping the lost air valve.

==Progression==
