==Objectives==
Use Duarn's Net to capture a [[Deepseeker Crab]] inside of [[Nespirah]].
*[[Deepseeker Crab]]
*[[Duarn's Net]] (provided)

==Description==
Everything in my body tells me that Nespirah is trying to speak with me but I cannot hear her. Perhaps the naga have done something to her voice.

<Duarn thinks to himself for a moment.>

Nespirah's voice may be suppressed... that means... we need to find a voice for her!

I've got it. The Idra'kess have been known to train deepseeker crabs as battle companions. Use this net to capture a crab and bring it to me. You will likely find them prowling the chamber's outer edges.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
I hope this works. My skills as a shaman are limited, and I fear that this task may be too much for us.

==Completion==
<Duarn looks at the crab and disguises a frown.>

It doesn't look very impressive, does it?

==Notes==
Head out, find a harpooner/crab combination, net the crab, loot it while it's friendly, then kill the harpooner.

==Progression==
{{Nespirah}}
