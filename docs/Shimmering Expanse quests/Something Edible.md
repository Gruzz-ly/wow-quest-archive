==Objectives==
Collect 8 [[Snapjaw Grouper]] Meat.
*[[Snapjaw Grouper Meat]] (8)

==Description==
Were they trying to starve us all to death?! Not giving prisoners food is just despicable.

We need to get these soldiers fed. The best prospect I spotted on the way here were those giant [[grouper]]. Several of those and we shouldn't want for meat for a while.

If you can bring me back some, I'll see to it that it gets cooked and passed out fairly.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Grouper-Skin Chestwrap|Meiofauna Wristguards|Filet Knife}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
With all the rumbling bellies, it sounds like there's a monster in this cave. It's putting my nerves on edge.

==Completion==
Now to hold up my end of the bargain. I'll get this cooked and passed out immediately.

You and I will have to have a talk later. I'm going to need help that these soldiers just can't offer.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Deep Attraction]] and [[Shelled Salvation]] before heading out. Exit the cave, turn around and go up over the top back toward Nespirah. While up on the ridge, keep an eye out for {{NPC||Fiasco Sizzlegrin}}, who offers [[Crafty Crabs]]. Then start killing grouper.
