== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Farseer Gadra}} to enter your Spirit Trance.
*Share in Farseer Gadra's Spirit Vision

== Description ==
Can ya feel how angry the elements be? They be wantin' to attack us and consume us even as we just arrive. We need ta calm dem, but that kinda wisdom only comes from knowin' what's riling them up in da first place.

Come sit with me by da fire. Let yaself get lost in the flames... let ya spirit peer into the true threat.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

== Progress ==
Lose yaself in the dancin' flames. Come with me, deeper into Vashj'ir, so that we be known' the face of our en emy.

== Completion ==
We'd all suspected da naga, but I knew nothin' of the [[Twilight's Hammer clan|Twilight Cult]] bein' beneath the waves. Somehow dey are corruptin' and pervertin' the elements, making' demselves into dese horrors.

We goin' ta have to be fightin' both of dese threats to stand a chance of bringin' peace ta [[Vashj'ir]]. We don't have da men ta do that yet.

Come, <class>, we got much ta do.

Huge amounts of {{NPC||Azsh'ir Infantry}}, {{NPC||Naz'jar Honor Guard}}s and {{NPC||Twilight Champion}}s are looking into the breach. {{NPC||Neptulon's Chosen}} are circling the breach in a weak attempt of the plane of water.''
