==Objectives==
Use the Globes of Tumultuous Water to trap 30 swarming serpents.
*[[Swarming Serpent]]s trapped x30
*[[Globes of Tumultuous Water]] (provided)

==Description==
I have no fondness to snakes, and even less so down here. Fortunately for us, the watery elements still bend to my will for now.

Take these globes and throw them at the ground to send the nearby water into a vortex, pulling in all the nearby serpents. The naga will most certainly turn the snakes against us, so keep the orbs close at hand.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Too often, we are mistaken for druidic types. perhaps that's true for some shaman, but do not let yourself be plagued by the ignorant belief that we are always peaceful.

Nothing about what I do is harmonious. I command the elements to my will. There is nothing offered in return. I would have it no other way.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Vengeful Heart]] before heading out. The globes are a ground-targeted AoE. Point it at an area with a large amount of not-aggroed serpents. It will pick up the serpents near it then path around in a line in an attempt to pick up more.
