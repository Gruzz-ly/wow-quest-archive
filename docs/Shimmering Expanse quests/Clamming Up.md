== Objectives ==
Gather 16 Glimmerdeep Clams.
*[[Glimmerdeep Clam]] x16

== Description ==
Here to help with the clam diving?

Get to it then. There are clams about everywhere just waiting to be dived.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Has your clam-laden frolic proved fruitful?

== Completion ==
Well done, indeed. This is an entirely unshameful amount of clams to have gathered. The survivors back at [[Tranquil Wash|the cave]] will surely be grateful.

== Notes ==
Clams are everywhere. Look for the little ones, not the big shells.
