== Objectives ==
Speak to Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar, Lady Sira'kess, and Overseer Idra'kess.

This task is part of a {{NPC||Naz'jar Battlemaiden}} vision. If needed, use the [[Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden]] at a time focus to return to the vision.
*Speak to {{NPC||Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar}}
*Speak to {{NPC||Lady Sira'kess}}
*Speak to {{NPC||Overseer Idra'kess}}

== Description ==
Lady Sira'kess has begun preparations for the ritual of summoning, but the [[Crucible of Nazsharin]] has been stolen from us. The [[Kvaldir]] have surely taken it with them as they retreated to shallower waters.

Speak to the caste leaders to secure a war party, and lead them west in retrieving the artifact from [[Biel'aran Ridge]] to the east.

I trust you, my Battlemaiden, for you have never failed in any task that I have given you. As I am revered to the {{NPC||Queen Azshara||Queen}}, so are you revered to me. Go with my blessings.

== Progress ==
It seems I beat you to the fight yet again. I'm sure you defeated scores of [[vrykul]] on your way here, or other such nonsense.

It is good to have you by my side again, Battlemaiden.

== Completion ==
Reinforcements have begun to circle the waters around the ledge, preparing for the attack. They await only your lead.

== Notes ==
Before accept:
:{{text|say|Lady Naz'jar|The Kvaldir have been purged from the city. Now we begin our preparations.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Naz'jar|Battlemaiden, I have a task that requires your attention.}}

Back in the Battlemaiden story! She now has a fourth ability:
#{{abilities|Soul Strike|range=8|Deals 1567 to 2033 Shadow Damage up to 3 targets and increasing the Battlemaiden's damage by 20%. The Battlemaiden gains 10% of the damage caused in health.}}
#{{abilities|Impaling Pull|range=10-40|Hurls your trident at a target and pulls them back to you, dealing 2125 to 2875 Physical damage and taunting the target.|notes=0.5 sec cast|cd=6 sec}}
#{{abilities|Vicious Charge|range=40|Charges at a target, dealing 7160 to 8840 Physical damage to any enemies in the Battlemaiden's path|notes=Instant|cd=6 sec}}
#{{abilities|Spinning Trident|range=30|Spin your trident in the air in a dazzling display of weapon mastry, dealing 4500 to 5500 Physical damage every 0.25 sec for 2 sec to all enemies in front of the Battlemaiden.|notes=Channeled|cd=20 sec}}
The battlemaiden also still has her movement speed increase buff, which stacks every five seconds up to three times while not in combat.

From her starting position, swim east through the tunnel to find Zin'jatar flanked by his {{NPC||Zin'jatar Stormsiren||stormsirens}} and {{NPC||Zin'jatar Warrior||warriors}} inside the big hallway.

Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar at {{coords|34.4|78.7|Shimmering Expanse}}
:The city has been routed. The Azsh'ir cry your name as a victory call. You've earned much respect this day.
{{gossip|''I am to hunt the Crucible of Nazsharin. Do you have warriors to assist me?''}}
:{{text|say|Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar|You will have some of my best men, do not worry Battlemaiden. Return to us quickly - I am eager to begin hunting {{NPC||Neptulon||the Tidehunter}}.}}

Exit the tunnel and take a quick right to find {{NPC||Overseer Idra'kess}} and his {{NPC||Idra'kess Enchantress||enchantresses}} and {{NPC||Idra'kess Sentinel||sentinels}}.

Overseer Idra'kess at {{coords|35.9|83.5|Shimmering Expanse}}
:I'd not expected the city to be taken so quickly. It seems we'll have much time to prepare for the invasion.
{{gossip|''I am to hunt the Crucible of Nazsharin. Do you have warriors to assist me?''}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Idra'kess|You shall have your reinforcements, Battlemaiden. I had already intended to collect Kvaldir to labor in [[Nespirah]], so your timing is opportune.}}
Turn to the broken ledge to the northeast to find {{NPC||Lady Sira'kess}} leading her {{NPC||Sira'kess Tide Priestess||tide priestesses}} and {{NPC||Sira'kess Guardian||guardians}}.

Lady Sirakess at {{coords|37.2|75.3|Shimmering Expanse}}
:The summoning incantations have been prepared, but we were depending on the Crucible of Nazsharin to draw power for our spell. The artifact must be recovered.
{{gossip|''I am to hunt the Crucible of Nazsharin. Do you have warriors to assist me?''}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sira'kess|I will send some of my priestesses to aid you. Find the artifact quickly so that I can begin summoning our allies for the battles to come.}}
Gathering completed, head up and east to [[Biel'aran Ridge]] to find {{NPC||Fathom-Stalker Azjentus}} standing on the other side of the [[Severed Span]].
