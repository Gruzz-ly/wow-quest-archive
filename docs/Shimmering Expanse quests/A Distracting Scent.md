== Objectives ==
Drag 3 Dead Zin'jatar Raiders into the open water over [[Glimmerdeep Gorge]].
*[[Dead Zin'jatar Raider]]s disposed of x3

== Description ==
Predators will smell these dead [[naga]] from nearly a mile away. Soon we'll find ourselves fighting just to get in and out of [[Silver Tide Hollow|the cave]]. Care to help me clean up?

Just over the ridge to the south is Glimmerdeep Gorge. If you drag the corpses over there and cut them loose, the wildlife will pick them clean before they hit the sea floor. Just steer clear of the sharks as much as you can.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Cowl of the Leptochelae|Aquasear Waistguard|Wentletrap Legplates}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
We are the prey to many of the creatures in these waters. We cannot let our guard down.

== Completion ==
It shouldn't take long to cleanse the water. Thank you for your help.

== Notes ==
{{item|Vashj'ir Seahorse|Mount up}}, pick up one of the dead naga and swim south along the cliff face until the zone changes to [[Glimmerdeep Gorge]]. The naga will automatically drop. Return and repeat the process.
