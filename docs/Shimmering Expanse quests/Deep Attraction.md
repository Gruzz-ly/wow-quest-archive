== Objectives ==
Kill 10 Redgill Scavengers.
*[[Redgill Scavenger]] slain x10

== Description ==
I've been able to help some of the survivors make it to [[Legion's Rest|the cave]], but it's starting to get hair out there. If we didn't have enough problems, some glowing [[murloc]]s started creeping up from the nearby crevice to attack the stranded survivors.

The men up there are warriors—they won't go down without a fight—but they're much worse for wear after that [[Nespirah|damned shell]].

If you have any breath left in your lungs, get up there and take out some of those murlocs. Hellscream's eyes are upon you.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
I don't know how long the men up there can hold out. Between exhaustion, limited air, and those murlocs, they're going to get worn down quickly.

== Completion ==
You know what it is to carry yourself with honor, <class>. You do Hellscream proud.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Shelled Salvation]] and [[Something Edible]] before heading out. Exit the cave, turn around and go up over the top back toward Nespirah. While up on the ridge, keep an eye out for {{NPC||Fiasco Sizzlegrin}}, who offers [[Crafty Crabs]]. Then start killing [[deep sea murloc]]s.
