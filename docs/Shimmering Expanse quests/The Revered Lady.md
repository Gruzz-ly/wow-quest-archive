== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Lady Naz'jar}} at the north end of the [[Quel'Dormir Gardens]].

This task is part of a {{NPC||Naz'jar Battlemaiden}} vision. If needed, use the [[Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden]] at a time focus to return to the vision.

== Description ==
The Revered Lady has sent word for you. She awaits you at the far end of the temple gardens.

If you feel the need to mention the heroic exploits of your faithful battle brother, {{NPC||Fathom-Stalker Azjentus||Azjentus}}, please don't hold back. I won't take your admiration of me as a weakness.

I'll hold you up no longer. The Lady awaits.

== Completion ==
Ah, my battlemaiden, you've come to me. The warrior caste whispers of nothing but your victories on the battlefield, and we've only just begun our assault to take [[Ruins of Vashj'ir|the city]].

You have served me proud thus far. May {{NPC||Queen Azshara||the Queen}} favor you that you might continue to do more of the same.

== Notes ==
On reaching Lady Naz'jar:
:{{text|say|Lady Naz'jar|{{NPC||Lady Vashj}} is nothing like her [[Lestharia Vashj|mother]]. It is little wonder she left this city so long ago.}}
