== Objectives ==
Kill 7 Idra'kess Sentinels and 7 Idra'kess Enchantresses.
*[[Idra'kess Sentinel]] slain x7
*[[Idra'kess Enchantress]] slain x7

== Description ==
I may be unable to open direct communication with the beast [[Nespirah]], but I can still feel some things indirectly. For example, I can clearly sense that Nespirah is not happy about the naga's presence here.

When we first entered Nespirah's body, I saw dozens of sentinels and enchantresses patrolling the central chamber. Perhaps some of the ancient one's pain will be alleviated if you thin their numbers.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Kilt of Shamanic Dreams|Polychaete Footguards|Stolen Idra'kess Drape}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
<Duarn is too focused on his task to notice your presence.>

== Completion ==
Can you sense it? If you have an ounce of shaman's blood in you, you must feel the sense of relief in the air.

Nespirah is pleased. Perhaps she will finally speak with us.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Slave Labor]] before heading out. Find a naga, kill a naga.
