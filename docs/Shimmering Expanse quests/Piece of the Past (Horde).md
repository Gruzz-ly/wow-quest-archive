==Objectives==
Bring the Ancient Elven Etching to [[Elendri Goldenbrow]]. You should find her with the [[Horde]] Nespirah Survivors.
*[[Ancient Elven Etching]] (provided)

==Description==
<An ancient, slightly cracked slab of stone with an immense number of inscriptions etched on all sides of it. You're unable to decipher the language, but the sheer amount of text and the semi-ornate nature of the stone suggest that this might carry significant value.>

<Elendri Goldenbrow, back with the [[Nespirah]] survivors, was looking for something exactly like this.>

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Keenstone Helm|Gloves of Transcription|Scribe's Quill}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|7|80}} (or {{cost|16|53}} at max level)
*27700 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|66000}} at max level)

==Progress==
Hah! Did you see the [[Captain Vilethorn|captain]] giving me dirty looks and decide to throw some sympathy my way? I've pretty much lost hope of making him understand that these ruins offer us some opportunity to salvage some usefulness out of this whole mess.

I'd actually hoped that you might turn up again - you seem like the only one I can rely on. Wait... what's that you have there?

==Completion==
Brilliant! I can't have expected much more with the tools I gave you.

I should be able to fill in the blanks and get this all written out shortly. There's no knowing if we will make it out of this place, but if it comes down to it, I will find a way to float this to the surface in hopes that it will one day be found.

Thank you again, <name>. You're not bad. 

==Notes==
The Ancient Elven Etching drops from any [[Azsh'ir Patroller]] in the [[Ruins of Vashj'ir]] while players are on [[Caught Off-Guard (Horde)|Caught Off-Guard]].
