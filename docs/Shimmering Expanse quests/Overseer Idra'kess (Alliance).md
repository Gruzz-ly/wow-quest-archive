== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Overseer Idra'kess.jpg||Overseer Idra'kess, desecrator of Nespirah.}}
Head to the top of [[Nespirah]] and slay Overseer Idra'kess.
*[[Overseer Idra'kess]] slain.

== Description ==
My men are flagging, <name>. We won't last much longer against these naga, I'm afraid. With the [[Hopelessly Gearless|Idra'kess' weapons]] and [[Still Valuable|Nespirah's pearls]], we should be ready to bust out of here.

Listen... I've seen the senior warlords and prophets head up that ramp to an upper chamber. I assume that their leader is in there, or perhaps the key to Nespirah's awakening. Hopefully both.

If you feel strong enough, head up to the top of the shell and look for some answers.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Earthmender's Sawfish Girdle|Gorgonian Belt|Helm of the Crushed Overseer}}
You will also receive: {{cost|23|40}}

== Progress ==
<Name>?

== Completion ==
No need to bring me up to speed... Nespirah has been narrating your adventures as they happened, and {{NPC||Taylor||Captain Taylor}} filled me in on the rest.

<Duarn closes his eyes and nods.>

Nespirah says that she is quite grateful, and that she has a small surprise ready for the naga.

== Notes ==
Keep circling counter-clockwise until reaching a ramp heading counterclockwise upstairs. There are Idra'kess, a level 80 elite with 150k health and two {{NPC||Idra'kess Mistress||mistress}} adds, each with 12k health. Take Idra'kess down to half health, he will pop a protection sphere absorbing most of damage, and channel a spell on Nespirah. You will get a raid warning to slay the two mistresses to destroy the shield. Once the shield is down, a ring of Nespirah Fluid will spawn around him. Drag him over these fluids and they will explode, dealing a good amount of damage to him and eventually kill him (or you can kill him straightforward).

At 50% health:

:{{text|yell|Overseer Idra'kess|Now, you will watch as I complete the ritual and turn the beast against you!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Slay the Idra'kess Mistresses to destroy the shield!}}
Bring the shield down:
:{{text|yell|Overseer Idra'kess|Aghhh! My sssphere!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Nespirah is waking up! Use the Nespirah Fluid to kill Idra'kess.}}
:{{text|yell|Overseer Idra'kess|No! My bubble is weakening!}}
:{{text|yell|Overseer Idra'kess|Nessspirah! Why do you turn against me?}}
Wipe:
: {{text|yell|Overseer Idra'kess|It isss done! Nessspirah isss mine!!!}}
Defeated:
:{{text|yell|Overseer Idra'kess|No! Nessspirah belongs to the naga!}}
