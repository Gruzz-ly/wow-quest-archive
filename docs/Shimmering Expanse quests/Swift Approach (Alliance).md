== Objectives ==
Destroy 8 Azsh'ir Monitors.
*Azsh'ir Monitor destroyed x8

== Description ==
I've taken the liberty of performing some preliminary scouting. The naga may not be aware of our position, but they are not entirely unprepared for intruders.

Beyond their patrols, they have set up magical sentry devices that will warn them of unwelcome guests. Fortunately, they seem to have sacrificed quality for quantity, and there is definitely a window in which the devices can be destroyed before their alarms are answered.

I trust that you can see to this before our other soldiers arrive.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to include one of these rewards|Gulper Eel Sandals|Chestguard of Alarming Dreams|Cowry-Shell Pendant}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
It seems clear that they do not take us seriously, which actually worries me. We have no idea how many of these naga there really are. As time passes, I grow to fear that the shell we escaped was only a small piece of a very large puzzle.

== Completion ==
Well done, <name>, and just in time too. The {{NPC||Admiral Dvorek||Admiral}} just started sending more men out. Strong sword arms to be sure, but I doubt they possess quite the same awareness and finesse that you do.

We were lucky to have you here when things went south. I suspect you will have a large role to play in things to come as well.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Caught Off-Guard (Alliance)|Caught Off-Guard]], [[An Occupation of Time (Alliance)|An Occupation of Time]] and [[A Better Vantage (Alliance)|A Better Vantage]] before heading out. The monitors have an [[Eye of Kilrogg]] model on top of a small pillar and only ~2k health. Players have roughly 10 seconds to kill the monitor before it summons an [[Azsh'ir Sentry]].
