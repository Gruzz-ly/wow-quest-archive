== Objectives ==
Seek out {{NPC||Felora Firewreath}} in [[Silver Tide Hollow]].

== Description ==
Most of the other [[Earthen Ring]] that escaped the massacre on the boats have taken shelter in a cave a short swim down from the ridge. It's tucked midway up a huge rock formation, west of [[Nespirah]], the gigantic shell on the horizon. I need you to make sure they're okay. There's no telling how many naga might have attacked them as well.

I'm going to hunt down that {{NPC||Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar||Fathom-Lord}}. I'll send word if I find the rock he's hiding under.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|95}}

== Completion ==
A friendly face! Welcome!

Very kind of you to come check on us. We're fine. A naga scouting force did find us, but I'm pretty sure none escaped. We should be safe for now.

== Notes ==
The cave entrance is visible southwest from {{NPC||Toshe Chaosrender||Toshe's}} position.
