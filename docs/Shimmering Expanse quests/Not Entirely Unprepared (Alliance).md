==Objectives==
Deliver 8 Bundles of Crossbow Bolts to Alliance Lookouts.
*[[Alliance Lookout (Shimmering Expanse)|Alliance Lookout]] restocked
*[[Box of Crossbow Bolts]] (provided)

==Description==
I overheard your conversation with the [[Admiral Dvorek|Admiral]]. I know what we're doing sounds insane, but we really don't have much of a choice. There are people back at that cave that are depending on us.

I've stationed lookouts on various ledges in the immediate area. They're burning ammo fast on the scattered naga scouts. Can you bring them some more crossbow bolts to buy us some extra time?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Treads of Dependability|Seafletcher Shoulderpads|Liminal Greathelm}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
You are perhaps the most dependable person I've ever met. I wish I could have more men half as thorough as you.

==Notes==
There are plenty of scouts up on ledges south of Taylor's position, the wall itself where the building is located, as well as further south.
