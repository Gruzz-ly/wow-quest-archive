==Objectives==
Use Duarn's Rope to save 8 Enslaved Pearl Miners.
*Pearl Miners rescued x8
*[[Duarn's Rope]] (provided)

==Description==
It will take me some time to break through this barrier and communicate with [[Nespirah]]. In the meantime, you can save some of those men that the naga have enslaved in the pits below.

<Duarn produces a length of rope from within his robes.>

This should come in handy.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
I need more time, <name>...

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>... although I'm afraid I haven't been nearly as productive as you have.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Stick it to Them]] before heading out. The miners, Alliance and Horde both, are down ledges that are nigh impossible to get out of. Thankfully the rope will reach them and pull them out.
