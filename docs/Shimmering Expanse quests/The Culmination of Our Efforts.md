== Completion ==
With every day, more warriors arrive at {{NPC||Queen Azshara||Azshara's}} command. Soon, the {{NPC||Neptulon||the Tidehunter}} will hear of our preparations, but too late to stop what we have set in motion. Our numbers will be too great and our allies too powerful. Victory is only a matter of time.

In Azshara's name.

== Notes ==
Complete the quest to end the vision and return to Valoren, who is waiting to complete [[Visions of the Past: The Slaughter of Biel'aran Ridge]].
