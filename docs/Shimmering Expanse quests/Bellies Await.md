== Objectives ==
Bring the Hefty Sack Of Clams back to the [[Tranquil Wash]].
*[[Hefty Sack of Clams]] (provided)

== Description ==
We have quite a stock of gathered clams to tote back to the cave. I was simply awaiting someone to do the toting. You've proven dangerous enough to be the sort.

I highly expect that such a fine meal shall not pass uncontested by predators on the way back, so I'd make your trip as swift as possible.

Thank you for your help, friend. It has been a pleasure.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Queen Conch Chestguard|Sea Star Wristwraps|Clam Shucker}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
You look to have come back to us with purpose. Was your trip successful?

== Completion ==
This is wonderful. I will begin cooking them immediately. It is good to know that of our many fears, starvation shall no longer need to be one of them.

I imagine the {{NPC||Admiral Dvorek||Admiral}} will have much work for you. Let me trouble you no further for a while.

== Notes ==
Nearing the cave:
