==Objectives==
Collect 8 [[Spiralung (quest item)]] shells and give them to the stranded [[Horde Shell Survivor]]s.
*Shell Survivors rescued x8

==Description==
A lot of the men haven't made it to [[Legion's Rest|the cave]] yet. It's a safe bet they're stranded at the vents on the ridge above us.

We found some spiralung shells on the way here. They don't produce much air, but it was enough for us to make the cave.

I need to stay here to count heads and get them back on their feet as they arrive. Do me a favor - go collect those spiralung shells, get them to any of my men that are still up on the ridge, and give them a swift kick in the arse so that they get moving.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
We need to get back on our feet quickly, before the rest of the naga find us.

==Completion==
Thank you, <class>. You've proven very useful.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Deep Attraction]] and [[Something Edible]] before heading out. Exit the cave, turn around and go up over the top back toward Nespirah. While up on the ridge, keep an eye out for [[Fiasco Sizzlegrin]], who offers [[Crafty Crabs]]. Along the ridge are small [[Spiralung]]s. Loot them and hand them to survivors holding out near air vents.
*None left behind, eh? You're a stand-up <race>.
*How many times is that that you've saved me today? I lost count.
*I thought I'd been left behind for sure. Thanks for coming back for me!
*I won't forget this. Thank you.
*I could kiss you. I'll spare you the shell-breath though.
*I'm going to name my firstborn <name>.
*You're a lifesaver, <class>.
*I owe you. Big time.
