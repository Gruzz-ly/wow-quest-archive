== Objectives ==
Obtain 4 Purloined Polearms from the weapon racks inside of [[Nespirah]].
*[[Purloined Polearm]] x4

== Description ==
I honestly don't know how we've survived this long. The naga took my armor and weapons, and left me with rags and a mining pick... and THAT snapped in half long ago.

If we're to stand any hope of turning the tide, I'm going to need something to fight with... as will my companions, though they may be too proud to admit it.

I've seen weapon racks in the naga storage areas nearby. I'm not accustomed to fighting with a trident, but it'll sure be better than fighting with my fists.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Beakless Polearm|Dusky Pearl Ring|Sand-Scoured Protector}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
In my youth, I was given some training on spearfighting. "Stick them with the pointy end," I think it was.

== Completion ==
<Admiral Dvorek admires the polearms you present him.>

Oh, I'm sorry. I was just imagining what these will look like with little bits of naga stuck to the ends of them. Thank you, <name>. We'll put these to good use.

== Notes ==
There are weapon racks everywhere.
