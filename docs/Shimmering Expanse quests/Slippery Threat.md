== Objectives ==
Kill 12 Spiketooth Eels.
*[[Spiketooth Eel]] slain x12

== Description ==
Been attacked by any of the [[eel]]s along the ridges yet? If not, you will. They are vicious, bloodthirsty little monsters. They don't seem to show much of any preference in what they're biting.

If you're going out into the valley, I'd appreciate if you thinned their population a bit. Not everyone here is as well equipped as you - we might not come back with just scratches.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
You look relatively intact. Have you finished?

== Completion ==
Thank you, <class>. There are still much bigger predators we'll have to keep an eye out for, but this will at least give us a bit of peace of mind around [[Silver Tide Hollow|the cave]].

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Don't be Shellfish]] before heading out. Plenty of sifters and eels along the bottom of the trench.

==Progression==
