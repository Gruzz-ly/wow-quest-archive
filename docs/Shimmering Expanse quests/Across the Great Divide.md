== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Farseer Gadra}} in [[Damplight Cavern]].

== Description ==
We will need to press deeper into [[Vashj'ir]] if we want to uncover what the naga are doing here.

Just across the [[Lightless Reaches]], the giant chasm bordering the [[Kelp'thar Forest]] to the west. If you look across it, you should see a cluster of plant-life surrounding the entrance to Damplight Cavern.

Once you're inside the cave, it's a bit of a ride up until you break surface, but I have friends there that should provide you a warm welcome.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||78}}

== Completion ==
Ello, mon! You look a bit more capable then most of dem coming through here.

Come rest a bit. Make yaself at home.

== Notes ==
Exit Deepmist, mount up, and keep heading southwest. Keep an eye out for a well-marked cave across the abyss and ride in to it.

==Progression==
