== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Toshe Chaosrender}} at the [[Ruins of Thelserai Temple]].

== Description ==
You met Toshe back in [[Damplight Chamber]], didn't you? He followed some of the fleeing [[naga]] to a set of ruins to the east and then sent for help.

Find Toshe at the ruins as soon as you can. If you find out anything about what the naga want, please let us know.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|95}}

== Completion ==
I remember you. You were there when they attacked us back in [[Shimmering Grotto|the cave]].

Good to have you with me, <class>. Ready for a little vengeance?

== Notes ==
Swim east beyond [[Nespirah]] to the Ruins of Thelserai Temple.
