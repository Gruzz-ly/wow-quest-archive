==Objectives==
Bring the Ancient Elven Etching to [[Levia Dreamwaker]]. You should find her with the [[Alliance]] Nespirah Survivors.
*[[Ancient Elven Etching]] (provided)

==Description==
<An ancient, slightly cracked slab of stone with an immense number of inscriptions etched on all sides of it. You're unable to decipher the language, but the shear amount of text and the semi-ornate nature of the stone suggest that this might carry significant value.>

<Levia Dreamwaker, back with the [[Nespirah]] survivors, was looking for something exactly like this.>

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Keenstone Helm|Gloves of Transcription|Scribe's Quill}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}} (or {{cost|16|53}} at max level)

==Progress==
Hah! Did you see the [[Admiral Dvorek|admiral]] giving me dirty looks and decide to throw some sympathy my way? I've pretty much lost hope of making him understand that these ruins offer us some opportunity to salvage some usefulness out of this whole mess.

I'd actually hoped that you might turn up again - you seem like the only one that I can rely on. Wait... what's that you have there?

==Completion==
Brilliant! It will take me a while to translate, but this is precisely the kind of find I was hoping for.

There's no knowing if we will make it out of this place, but if it comes down to it, I will find a way to float this to the surface in hopse that it will one day be found.

Thank you again, <name>. here... perhaps I have something that may be of use to you.

==Notes==
The Ancient Elven Etching drops from any [[Azsh'ir Patroller]] in the [[Ruins of Vashj'ir]] while players are on [[Caught Off-Guard (Alliance)|Caught Off-Guard]].
