==Objectives==
Kill 10 Muckskin Scroungers.
*[[Muckskin Scrounger]] slain

==Description==
[[Fiasco Sizzlegrin|Fiasco]] came out here with a balloon of some sort that he retrieved from one of our ships. He tried to float it to the top, but those Muckskin Scroungers came out of nowhere and swarmed the thing.

He's got an idea for another balloon, but we need to make sure that the past doesn't repeat itself. I need you to kill off those [[gilgoblin|giblins]]. Or at the very least, enough of them to make them fear us.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|78000}}

== Progress ==
These scroungers seem intensely curious about our equipment. Sometimes suicidally so. I wonder what attracts them to it so much.

== Completion ==
Less gilblins is good!

I'm glad they're so primitive. I don't think I'd want to be dealing with a race of aquatic tech-freaks right now. Not at all.

== Notes ==
Head southwest toward the Horde ship. The gilgoblins have taken over the area. At least they're hostile to the kvaldir...
