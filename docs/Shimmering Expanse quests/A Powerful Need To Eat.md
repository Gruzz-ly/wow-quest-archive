== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Divemaster Birmingham}} in [[Glimmerdeep Gorge]].

== Description ==
Poor things. They're starving.

We've many matters to attend to, not the least of them the naga, but first we need to get some food in these bellies. I'm not sure what the naga fed them up in that shell, if anything, but they're definitely worse for the wear.

Quite a few of the survivors have made their way into Glimmerdeep Gorge, to the northwest. Go join them and help out. With a bit of clam meat, we can get these survivors back on their feet.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|2}}

== Completion ==
More help! Superb! We can certainly use it, I'll tell you that much.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Cold Welcome]] before heading out. Exit the cavern and circle around to the northwest to reach Glimmerdeep. The divemaster is close to the shipwreck near the east end of the gorge.

The quest name might refer to a Malcolm Reynolds quote from the movie [[wikipedia:Serenity (film)|Serenity]], although used largely in a different context.
