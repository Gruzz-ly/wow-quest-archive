== Objectives ==
Board the ''[[Verne]]'' from The ''[[Stygian Bounty]]'' and aid in securing [[Tenebrous Cavern]].
*Board the ''Verne'' once it arrives
*Secure Tenebrous Cavern

== Description ==
We've located the beast that destroyed our ships. It makes its lair in Tenebrous Cavern, a giant underwater cavern bordering the Abyssal Breach.

This time we're ready. The goblins have been proving their worth by making a vicious machine for us back at [[Bilgewater Harbor]], and it's packing firepower that'll make the fiend wet itself.

When the ''Verne'' pulls up to dock beside the ship, make your way on board and help out however you can. We'll be right behind you.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Completion ==
Well done, <class>.

That slippery beast got away! I'll be making a few upgrades. It won't be so lucky next time.

== Notes ==
Hop on the sub and take the ride.

Get down to the bottom level, as the ship reaches Tenebrous Cavern:

:{{text|say|Captain "Jewels" Verne|Take her in slowly, number two.}}
:''The ship pulls in. Ozumat is inside the cave!''
:{{text|say|First Lieutenant Pieracci|The reports were accurate! The beast is here...}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Jewels" Verne|S-s-s-steady, number two...}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Jewels" Verne|Fire! Fire! Blow it out of the water!}}
:''The ship releases a lot of weapons, but Ozumat escapes.''
:{{text|say|First Lieutenant Pieracci|The beast escaped sir! By Gallywix's gut, it was fast!}}
:{{text|say|Captain "Jewels" Verne|Don't worry, number two. We'll get another chance. And we'll be ready.}}
