==Objectives==
Meet with [[Fiasco Sizzlegrin]] on [[Biel'aran Ridge]].

==Description==
Toldrek and Fiasco left to find a way to contact help. The trade lanes aren't far, so there might be a chance of success, but I'm wary to let anyone get their hopes up.

In truth, we don't have any other options. We're not likely to last much longer here. The naga will find us eventually, and... well... you saw how many of them there were.

You should go find the two of them on [[Biel'aran Ridge]] to the southeast. I'll keep everyone here safe as long as I can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|19500}}
*6950 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|16550}} at max level)

==Completion==
Look at you, a regular aquatic hero! Trouble comes. You come. Save the day. You must be proud of yourself!

We've devised our brilliant plan. Gloriously simple, barring the hostility of local life. Simpler yet with a you available!

==Notes==
The Horde NPCs are at the northwestern corner of the ridge.
