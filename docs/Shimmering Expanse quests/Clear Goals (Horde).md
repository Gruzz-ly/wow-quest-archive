== Objectives ==
Kill 10 of the naga forces building up under the southern terrace.
*Southern Naga Forces slain x10

== Description ==
I see. The news you bring is grim, but I was not entirely unprepared for such possibilities. Without any effective scounting of naga numbers, I knew our plan was risky, but that's why we established this forward post.

Let me put it to you plainly, <class>. If we do not keep the naga off-balance they will bring the fight to us. We do not have the structures or the men to mount a defense, so that is not an option.

We need more time. Can you thin their numbers to the south?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
They're amassing infantry to the south.

We need more time. Do anything you can to clear them out.

== Completion ==
More naga are amassing to the south then reported too it seems. We shall have to move quickly then.

== Notes ==
Head south. Valid targets are [[Azsh'ir Abyss Priestess]]es, [[Azsh'ir Infantry]] and [[Naz'jar Serpent Guard]]s.

==Progression==
