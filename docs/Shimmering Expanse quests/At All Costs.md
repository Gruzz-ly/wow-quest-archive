== Objectives ==
Kill 20 Kvaldir attackers within [[Quel'Dormir Temple]].

This task is part of a {{NPC||Naz'jar Battlemaiden}} vision. If needed, use the [[Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden]] at a time focus to return to the vision.
*Kvaldir Attacker slain x20

== Description ==
We are to begin the ritual immediately, and you are to see to it that we are not interrupted.

Slaughter any [[Kvaldir]] that enter the temple. See to it that my priestesses live to see their task complete, no matter the cost.

== Progress ==
I am trusting you to safeguard us, Battlemaiden.

== Completion ==
{{NPC||Fathom-Stalker Azjentus||Azjentus}} is to be taken at his word. Lady Naz'jatar's Honor Guard should be sufficient to see the rest of the ritual through.

== Notes ==
A lot of elites are there to help out. Focus on the door and the center of the room. Use the battlemaiden's new abilities to swiftly finish off the kvaldir.

While inside the temple, [[Overseer Idra'kess]] assists and watches you to kill the 20 Kvaldir.

Upon killing 20, Azjentus swims in:
