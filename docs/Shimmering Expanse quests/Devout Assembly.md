== Objectives ==
Seek out Fathom-Caller Azrajar midway down the northern stairs and 6 Sira'kess Tide Priestesses on the upper portion of the ruins, and instruct them to return to the temple.

This task is part of a {{NPC||Naz'jar Battlemaiden}} vision. If needed, use the [[Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden]] at a time focus to return to the vision.
*{{NPC||Sira'kess Tide Priestess}}es gathered x6
*{{NPC||Fathom-Caller Azrajar}} gathered

== Description ==
Ah, Battlemaiden. You carry with you the word and will of our Lady. I might ask a favor of you...

I need Fathom-Caller Azrajar and my Tied Priestesses to return so that we can begin the ritual. Can you carry my will to them a such? You should find them spread upon the temple terrace. Azrajar will be at the stairs to the north.

== Progress ==
The threat may not be sure, but the [[Kvaldir]] are certainly not fools. They would not return if they did not have some confidence in victory.

== Completion ==
The Kvaldir have proved a greater threat than we anticipated, but our plans are not hindered in the least. As our allies arrive, we will have a force more than sufficient to usurp {{NPC||Neptulon||the Tidehunter}}.

All that remains is to ensure that the ritual of summoning is completed.

== Notes ==
Before accept:
:{{text|say|Lady Sira'kess|The Kvaldir have returned to take the city back from us, Battlemaiden. They will need you outside.}}

The conclusion to the Battlemaiden story! She now has a fifth ability:
#{{abilities|Soul Strike|range=8|Deals 1567 to 2033 Shadow Damage up to 3 targets and increasing the Battlemaiden's damage by 20%. The Battlemaiden gains 10% of the damage caused in health.}}
#{{abilities|Impaling Pull|range=10-40|Hurls your trident at a target and pulls them back to you, dealing 2125 to 2875 Physical damage and taunting the target.|notes=0.5 sec cast|cd=6 sec}}
#{{abilities|Vicious Charge|range=40|Charges at a target, dealing 7160 to 8840 Physical damage to any enemies in the Battlemaiden's path|notes=Instant|cd=6 sec}}
#{{abilities|Spinning Trident|range=30|Spin your trident in the air in a dazzling display of weapon mastry, dealing 4500 to 5500 Physical damage every 0.25 sec for 2 sec to all enemies in front of the Battlemaiden.|notes=Channeled|cd=20 sec}}
#{{abilities|Soul Devour|Absorbs lifeforce from all enemies within 25 yards of the Battlemaiden, dealing 1215 to 1485 Shadow damage and healing the Battlemaiden for 7500 per target.|cd=20 sec|notes=Instant}}
The battlemaiden also still has her movement speed increase buff, which stacks every five seconds up to three times while not in combat.

Head outside and speak to {{NPC||Lady Naz'jar}}, who also offers a quest: [[Her Lady's Hand]].

Head north to kill vrykul and free priestesses. The Fathom-Caller is at the far northern end of the ledge.
