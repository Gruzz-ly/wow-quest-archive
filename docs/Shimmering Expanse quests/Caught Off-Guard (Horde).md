==Objectives==
Kill 12 Azsh'ir Patrollers.
*[[Azsh'ir Patroller]] slain (12)

==Description==
Our escape from the shell can't have gone unnoticed, but either the [[naga]] at these ruins weren't informed or they don't consider us a threat. I don't intend to take the opportunity for granted - we strike now.

I need you to slip into the lower level of the ruins and take out as many of their patrols as you can. We cannot risk any of those patrols finding out about our occupation of this cave - make sure none escape.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
This is a matter of life and death, <class>. The longer we wait, the more we risk giving away our position.

==Completion==
Excellent work, <class>.

I will get some of our own patrols out to make sure no more naga get within sight of this cave. We should have the area secured within the hour.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Swift Approach (Horde)|Swift Approach]], [[An Occupation of Time (Horde)|An Occupation of Time]] and [[A Better Vantage (Horde)|A Better Vantage]] before heading out. Scouts are everywhere in the lower level. Don't focus killing them to the detriment of completing the other quests.
