==Objectives==
Retrieve a Horde Survival Kit.
*[[Horde Survival Kit]]

==Description==
It's a short swim to the top. Not much trouble really. Hard to get any supplies up there though. Too heavy.

All of the ships in all of the Horde fleets stow a survival kit. I had a balloon from the old survival kit, but it fell on hard times recently. I need another survival kit.

There's a ship to the southeastish. Let's hope that the survivors were dumb and didn't take the survival kit. More survival kit for us.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Anomuran Footpads|Nephropsis Treads|Staff of Post-Facto Preparation}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
A whole big box is amazing That's what it is. I need more amazing in my life.

Don't worry, I'll share.

== Completion ==
Let me see, let me see... flare gun... balloon... no rope. Never any rope. Terribly impractical if you do ask me. Rope should be mandatory.

== Notes ==
The Horde ship is to the south''west''. The crate is astern below deck.
