Kill 16 Kvaldir on [[Nar'shola Terrace]], the middle level of the [[Ruins of Vashj'ir|ruins]].

*Kvaldir invaders on the terrace slain x16

== Description ==
{{NPC||Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar}} has sent word that the [[Kvaldir]] leader has shown himself. I would like you to make your way to him at the far end of the terrace above us, on the middle level of the ruins: Nar'shola Terrace.

Kill any Kvaldir that stand in your path. We want the echoes of this defeat to ring in their minds so that they will not dare return to threaten our purpose here.

Your devotion does not go unnoticed, my battlemaiden. Go knowing that you have my blessing.

== Progress ==
So I am to be graced by the presence of the Battlemaiden?

The Kvaldir stream endlessly into the sharp ends of our weapons. Please welcome yourself to some of the glory.

== Completion ==
It is good of you to join me, Battlemaiden. The echoes of your combat graced your approach. It was a beautiful sound to behold.

== Notes ==
On accept, the battlemaiden is granted a new ability:
*{{abilities|Vicious Charge|range=40|Charges at a target, dealing 7160 to 8840 Physical damage to any enemies in the Battlemaiden's path.|notes=Instant|cd=6 sec}}

Pick up [[Built to Last]] before heading up. Valid targets up top include [[Kvaldir Plunderer]]s, [[Kvaldir Pillager]]s and [[Kvaldir Wasteroamer]]s. The Nar'shola terrace extends all the way to the south end of the ruins, which is where Zin'jatar awaits.
