== Objectives ==
Enter [[Nespirah]]'s northwestern entrance, then find a way to communicate with it.
*Find a way to communicate with Nespirah

== Description ==
It is clear to me at this point what must be done, <name>.

The [[naga]] can only be obtaining these pearls from one place: Nespirah, the ancient, shelled creature that rests outside of [[Silver Tide Hollow|this cave]]. Why Nespirah would submit to the naga, however, is beyond my understanding.

We can enter Nespirah's body cavity through a small tube near the exit to [[Silver Tide Hollow|this cave]]. I must first fetch {{NPC||Erunak Stonespeaker||my master}}, then we can meet you inside. We will convene in Nespirah's northwestern entrance.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||78}}

== Completion ==
Erunak trusts this task to me? Very well, let's see what we can learn from the ancient one.

== Notes ==
Exit the cave, mount up, and swim southeast to the big red opening at {{co|51.9|48.6|Shimmering Expanse}} just to the left of its mouth with air bubbles rising out of it. Swim inside and run toward the center. Duarn and Stonespeaker will follow.

A script event happens:
:{{text|say|Earthmender Duarn|Her body appears even larger from the inside. Fascinating!}}
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|Amazing!}}
:''The shaman head over to the ledge overlooking the mine beneath.''
:{{text|say|Earthmender Duarn|Look, <race>. I see man and orc, chained up as slaves, mining Nespirah's pearls. And I see naga holding the whip. Something must be done.}}
:{{text|say|Earthmender Duarn|What's this over here?}}
:''Duarn is distracted by something and leads us to a room nearby; it's Nespirah's brain chamber.''
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|This job is well-suited for you, Duarn. I must attend to matters outside.}}
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|Good luck to you too, <name>.}}
