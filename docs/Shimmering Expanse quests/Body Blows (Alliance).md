==Objectives==
[[File:Nespirah Abscess.png|thumb|Nespirah Abscess.]]
Attack 7 Nespirah Abscesses along the walls of [[Nespirah|Nespirah's]] body chamber.
*[[Nespira Abscess]] attacked (7)

==Description==
<[[Taylor|Captain Taylor]] listens intently to your recount of [[Earthmender Duarn|Duarn]] and Nespirah's conversation.>

I see. So that creature wants our help waking it up, is that it?

With hundreds of slaves already picking away at her pearls, the beast seems to be a pretty heavy sleeper. You might have better luck, though.

My suggestion, look around the creature's flesh for signs of weakness. Maybe that weapon of yours will find a ticklish spot and force the beast to come to its senses.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
You'd better keep trying, <name>. These naga aren't going anywhere unless you wake the creature up.

==Completion==
Hopefully we made some progress. I'm not sure how we'll know when the creature wakes up, but something tells me that it will be pretty obvious when it does.

==Notes==
Abscesses can be found on the floor and the walls everywhere in the general area.

==Progression==
{{Nespirah}}
