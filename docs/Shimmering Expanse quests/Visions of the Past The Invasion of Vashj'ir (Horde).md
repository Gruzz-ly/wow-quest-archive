==Objectives==
Use the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden at the battle site towards the southern end of the gardens.
*Attune With the Broken Blade's Owner
*[[Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden]] (provided)

==Description==
The shard you recovered looks to be of naga origin. I had hoped to find a strong focal object like this for a spell I've been working on that would allow us to glimpse into the recent past.

I've enchanted the blade, but you'll have to take it to a place where we know its owner was. I want you to travel back to the site where you found it and use the blade.

Perhaps we can uncover more behind what the naga are doing here. Or even better, maybe we'll uncover a weakness that will give us a better chance.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Wound-Binding Girdle|Chestguard of the Naz'jar|Wavespeaker's Focus}}
You will also receive: {{cost|31|20}}

==Progress==
That took longer than expected. Did you learn anything useful? Who did the blade belong to?

==Completion==
A Battlemaiden? I never have heard of such a thing.

The way you explain it, it sounds like the naga forces are in far greater scope than the Admiral could possibly have realized. We might be able to learn more through the blade if we can find other locations where this Battlemaiden was present, but the information you gave me makes me fear for the Captain and his soldiers. We must warn them.

==Notes==
Head back southwest to the southern ruins where the skull is, at {{coords|40.5|75.4|Shimmering Expanse}}. A bright glowing ball, the Vision of the Battlemaiden, now appears over the skull. Additionally, there is a vision of the NPCs in the area, ghosts of naga and corpses of kvaldir. Using the item puts players in the shoes of the [[Naz'jar Battlemaiden]]. She is offered the quest [[Reoccupation]], which starts a quest chain involving her. See that article for more information. Upon the completion of [[Not Soon Forgotten]], players are brought back to where they entered the vision, where the wavespeaker awaits.

Upon use of the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden, at the beginning of the vision, there is a short cutscene:
:{{text|say|Fathom-Stalker Azjentus|I could hear the sound of your trident breaking from the gardens! The skulls of these Kvaldir are as strong as rock.}}
:{{text|say|Naz'jar Battlemaiden|A single prong. Hardly enough to stop me from slaughtering hundreds more.}}
:{{text|say|Fathom-Stalker Azjentus|Indeed. I doubt much would.}}

When awakening from the vision:
:{{text|say|Wavespeaker Valoren|Welcome back, <name>. That took longer than expected. Learn anything useful?}}
