== Objectives ==
Return to {{NPC||Felora Firewreath}} in [[Silver Tide Hollow]].

== Description ==
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure Felora wants you back. That woman has no respect for innovation. When I told her about the modifications I was making for my Earth Elemental, she nearly threw a fit.

Go tell her everything's all well and dandy. And tell her she's not getting a share of my inevitable fortune either.

She probably likes sleeping on the rock anyway.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|95}}

== Completion ==
{{NPC||The Great Sambino||Sam's}} in one piece then? And his poor assistant {{NPC||Felice}}? Good to hear.

I hope that one day he'll learn to respect the elements as more than just a tool.

== Notes ==
Back to the cave. Up next is [[Toshe's Vengeance]].

==Progression==
