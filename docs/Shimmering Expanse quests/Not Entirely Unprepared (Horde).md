==Objectives==
Deliver 8 Bundles of Crossbow Bolts to Horde Lookouts.
*[[Horde Lookout]] Lookout restocked
*[[Box of Crossbow Bolts]] (provided)

==Description==
I overheard your conversation with the [[Captain Vilethorn|Captain]]. I know what we're doing sounds insane, but we really don't have much of a choice. There are people back at that cave that are depending on us.

I've stationed lookouts on various ledges in the immediate area. They're burning ammo fast on the scattered naga scouts. Can you bring them some more crossbow bolts to buy us some extra time?

==Rewards==

You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
You are perhaps the most dependable person I've ever met. I wish I could have more men half as thorough as you.

==Notes==
They're all over the general area just to the south.
