==Objectives==
Speak to [[Farseer Krogar]] at the [[Western Earthshrine]] in [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
We find ourselves in a much better position against our enemies in [[Vashj'ir]] than before you arrived.  Don't get me wrong, your aid is still needed here, but perhaps other fronts are in an even more urgent situation.

I've been informed that our allies in the [[Earthen Ring]] have put out a call for aid in a matter I've been assured is most critical.

Speak to Farseer Krogar at the Western Earthshrine in Orgrimmar for further instructions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3490 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|8300}} at max level)

==Completion==
Your aid is most timely, <name>. 

==Notes==
Duarn offers this quest on the ''[[Stygian Bounty]]'' when players are sent there for [[A Breath of Fresh Air (Horde)|A Breath of Fresh Air]] if players have already reached level 82. If players have not, return to the ship after completing [[Defending the Rift (Horde)|Defending the Rift]].

==Progression==
{{Deepholm, Realm of Earth}}
