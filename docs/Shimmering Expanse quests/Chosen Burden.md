== Objectives ==
Return to the western edge of the [[Biel'aran Ridge]] with the news of the [[Crucible of Nazsharin]].

This task is part of a {{NPC||Naz'jar Battlemaiden}} vision. If needed, use the [[Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden]] at a time focus to return to the vision.

== Description ==
With the Crucible of Nazsharin, all that remains is to inform Lady naz'jar of your success.

== Completion ==
Well done, my battlemaiden.

This crucible will serve as a font of power for our summoning ritual. With it, {{NPC||Lady Sira'kess||Sira'kess}} will beckon our allies from the depths to bolster our already swelling forces.
