== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Earthmender Duarn}} inside [[Nespirah]] to activate her bio-defenses, then escape from Nespirah's body.
*Listen as Duarn speaks to Nespirah
*Escape on Erunak's Seahorse

== Description ==
Thanks to you and the {{NPC||Legionnaire Nazgrim||Legionnaire}}, Nespirah has full control of her body... but most of the naga don't know this yet. Once we make our escape, she will activate her biological defenses and destroy the naga from within.

Make yourself ready... I will now tell Nespirah to begin the countdown.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Completion ==
It appears that I owe you my life, yet again. Thank Hellscream that you found me before you and your shaman activated those bio-defenses.

== Notes ==
Watch the script event, then follow Erunak outside to find the {{NPC||Swiftfin Seahorse}}. There are an incredibly large amount of Nespirah Fluids attacking the naga inside. Taking the seahorse ride will send players to [[Legion's Rest]], just to the southwest of Nespirah.

:{{text|yell|Voice of Nespirah|K-k-k-k-kkkah! I am freed from the naga's servitude, and my will is once again my own!}}
:{{text|yell|Voice of Nespirah|My body is already starting to fight the naga infection. Please, I ask you to get to safety before I unleash my wrath!}}
:{{text|say|Voice of Nespirah|You may leave now, friend. The tauren's friend {{NPC||Erunak Stonespeaker||Erunak}} should be waiting outside with [[seahorse]]s. In fact, it looks like he is here now.}}
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|I have secured escape for us, <name>. You are to come with me.}}
:{{text|yell|Erunak Stonespeaker|Duarn - excellent work. Do not dally long within Nespirah's shell. You know as well as I do the dangers posed by an angry [[demigod]].}}
:{{text|say|Voice of Nespirah|Worry not, Erunak. The tauren will be safe.}}
:{{text|yell|Erunak Stonespeaker|Now, follow me!}}
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|Board the seahorse, friend. You do not want to be near Nespirah when she turns on the naga.}}

This concludes the [[Nespirah]] quest chain! Up next, the [[Ruins of Vashj'ir]], starting with [[Deep Attraction]], [[Shelled Salvation]], [[Something Edible]] and [[Crafty Crabs]].
