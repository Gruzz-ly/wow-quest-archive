== Objectives ==
Kill 10 Green Sand Crabs.
*[[Green Sand Crab]] slain x10

== Description ==
These [[crab]]s are not friendly. Not. Friendly.

{{NPC||The Great Sambino||Sam's}} endless drilling is riling them up. I know from experience that there's no stopping Sam, so let's look into the other side of things, shall we?

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Leggings of the Albino Brachyura|Crabcracker Chestguard|Super-Sized Stompers}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Careful. They pinch.

== Completion ==
Does everything down here only come in jumbo size? Oooh! That's a thought. Maybe there are some hunky [[gilgoblin|sea goblins]] around here somewhere.

Thanks, by the way.

== Notes 
Pick up [[Undersea Inflation]] before heading out. Plenty of regular neutral green sand crabs all over the area.
