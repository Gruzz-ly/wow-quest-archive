== Objectives ==
Bring a Kvaldir High-Shaman to the feet of {{NPC||Executioner Verathress}}.

This task is part of a {{NPC||Naz'jar Battlemaiden}} vision. If needed, use the [[Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden]] at a time focus to return to the vision.
*[[Kvaldir High-Shaman]] executed

== Description ==
The High-Shaman are in the buildings nearby, chanting and taunting, but not daring to approach me. These [[Kvaldir]] find their courage and strength only in the mist. They are a pitiful nuisance beneath the waves.

I came bearing a message. If your ladyship has the time, bring a high-shaman to my feet so that I might deliver this message to him and his people.

== Progress ==
If your ladyship has the time, bring a high-shaman to my feet so that I might deliver this message to him and his people.

== Completion ==
My axe is sated. Thank you, my lady.

== Notes ==
It's easiest to use the Impaling Pull at max range on one of the high-shaman after clearing his guards, then kite him to Verathress.
