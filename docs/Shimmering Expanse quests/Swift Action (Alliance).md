== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Engineer Hexascrub}} to join the assault, then use your improvised explosives to kill 100 Azsh'ir Soldiers, 20 Azsh'ir Wavescreamers, and 12 Azsh'ir Archaeans.
*Speak to [[Engineer Hexascrub]]
*[[Azsh'ir Soldier]] slain x100
*[[Azsh'ir Wave Screamer]] slain x20
*[[Azsh'ir Archaean]] slain x12

== Description ==
We have everything we need to begin the attack.

If your claims are correct, you would do well to make sure you cling tight to your mount as we make the run. Anyone who gets caught in the open water isn't likely to out-swim a naga.

Kill as many as you can as we make the attack run and we'll rendezvous on the broken ledge of the southern terrace above once we've expended our explosives. Hopefully by that point there will be few enough that we can finish them off the old fashioned way.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Tiger Shark Belt|Atoll Treaders|Pelagic Prism}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Speak to Engineer Hexascrub to secure a mount for the assault.

== Completion ==
You did great up there! You devastated their ranks, but there were far more than we accounted for, and most of our men went down out there in the masses of naga.

We'll need to hold this position as long as possible to buy them some time. Hopefully some of them will still make it to the rendezvous.

== Notes ==

Players are mounted on a Tamed Manta with a ground-targeted AoE:
#{{abilities|Improvised Explosives|range=90|Extend friendly invitations to naga in the Ruins of Vashj'ir via one of Hexascrub's surprise gift-bags.|notes=Instant}}
The manta will do one big loop of the terrace before doing smaller loops until players hit the required number of kills. Archaeans take two hits! The manta will then head to the southeast end of the terrace where the force is fighting off a few soldiers at a time.

You are unable to dismount or eject the mount once the bombing run begins.  Whether this is a bug, or working as design, is unknown.  Bear this in mind before starting this quest if you are queued for a [[Dungeon Finder|random dungeon]].
