==Objectives==
Swim to the surface, retrieve the flare gun, and fire a rescue flare towards the Alliance Ships.
*Swim to the rescue balloon at the surface
*Fire a rescue flare towards the Alliance ships

==Description==
All done! I'm confident it will work. And not a scrounger in sight to pop a hole in it this time! Fortuitous.

[[Jorlan Trueblade|Jorlan]] already swam up to catch it. Swam up and stopped to wait for it. He said you'd get the honors though. Jorlan's nice like that.

Go to the top with the balloon, take the flare gun from the crate, and scan the horizon for Alliance ships. If you see any, fire the flare towards them. That's it! All there is to it.

Swim. Float. Flare. Rescue! That last part's my favorite.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|78000}}

== Progress ==
Those aren't trade ships, those are war ships. Still, this is an incredible stroke of luck. Fire that flare off and pray that they see it.

== Completion ==
Perfect! There's no way they missed that, fighting or not.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Hexascrub|Up you go!}}
Swim directly up. The rescue balloon, the Survival Kit Remnants, and Jorlan are all on the surface. Break surface and loot the crate to get the [[Rescue Flare]], aim toward the ships, and use it.

On breaking the surface:
:{{text|say|Jorlan Trueblade|Fresh air! By the Light, I missed it. We have some ships just in sight to the north, <name> - fire the flare in their direction.}}
After firing off the flare:
:{{text|say|Jorlan Trueblade|Ha ha! There's no way they'll miss that, cannon fire or not.}}
