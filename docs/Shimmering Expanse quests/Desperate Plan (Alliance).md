==Objectives==
Meet with [[Engineer Hexascrub]] on [[Biel'aran Ridge]].

==Description==
[[Jorlan Trueblade|Jorlan]] and Hexascrub left to find a way to contact help. The trade lanes aren't far, so there might be a chance of success, but I'm wary to let anyone get their hopes up.

In truth, we don't have any other options. We're not likely to last much longer here. The [[naga]] will find us eventually, and... well... you saw how many of them there were.

You should go find the two of them on Biel'aran Ridge to the southeast. I'll keep everyone here safe as long as I can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|19500}}
*6950 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|16550}} at max level)

==Completion==
Impeccable timing. Like clockwork! Trouble comes. You come. Save the day. Clockwork!

We've devised our brilliant plan. Gloriously simple, barring the hostility of local life. Simpler yet with a you available!

==Notes==
The Alliance NPCs are at the northern end of the middle of the ridge.
