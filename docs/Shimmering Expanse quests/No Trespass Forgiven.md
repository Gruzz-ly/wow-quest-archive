==Objectives==
Kill 20 Kvaldir on the [[Biel'aran Ridge|Vrykul Ledge]].

This task is part of a [[Naz'jar Battlemaiden]] vision. If needed, use the [[:Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden]] at a time focus to return to the vision.
*Vrykul Ledge Kvaldir slain (20)

==Description==
I know that you, like our revered lady, have unfortunate streaks of mercy that you succumb to at times. I would advise against such kindnesses this day. The [[Kvaldir]] are proud, and they will strike back if we do not cripple them completely. Kill all that you find.

Sadly, I have the inglorious task of making sure none return to the city, so you can go have all of the fun. I will cheer you on though, of course.

==Progress==
Look. It's my job to guard [[Severed Span|the bridge]]. It may not be a glorious job, but it's the only one I have right now.

Go find some Kvaldir to kill off in those ruins and leave this little slice of heaven to me.

==Completion==
Not one slipped through to the bridge. Not one.

It was very boring. I'd appreciate if you shared a little next time.

==Notes==
Plenty of kvaldir to the southwest. Valid targets are the [[Kvaldir High-Shaman|high-shaman]], [[Kvaldir Sandterror|sandterrors]] and [[Kvaldir Limbripper|limbrippers]]. Go nuts. Before heading back to turn in, keep heading southwest to find {{NPC||Executioner Verathress}} just north of the southwestern ruin marked on the map at {{coords|57.2|85.1|Shimmering Expanse}}, where he offers [[Setting An Example]]
