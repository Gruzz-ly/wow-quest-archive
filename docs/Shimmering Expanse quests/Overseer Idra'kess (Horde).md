== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Overseer Idra'kess.jpg||Overseer Idra'kess, desecrator of Nespirah.}}
Head to the top of [[Nespirah]] and slay Overseer Idra'kess.
*[[Overseer Idra'kess]] slain.

== Description ==
My men are flagging, <name>. We won't last much longer against these naga, I'm afraid. With the [[Hopelessly Gearless|Idra'kess' weapons]] and [[Still Valuable|Nespirah's pearls]], we should be ready to bust out of here.

Listen... I've seen the senior warlords and prophets head up that ramp to an upper chamber. I assume that their leader is in there, or perhaps the key to Nespirah's awakening. Hopefully both.

If you feel strong enough, head up to the top of the shell and look for some answers. Hellscream's eyes are upon you!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Earthmender's Sawfish Girdle|Gorgonian Belt|Helm of the Crushed Overseer}}
You will also receive: {{cost|23|40}}

== Progress ==
<Name>?

== Completion ==
No need to bring me up to speed... Nespirah has been narrating your adventures as they happened, and {{NPC||Legionnaire Nazgrim}} filled me in on the rest.

<Duarn closes his eyes and nods.>

Nespirah says that she is quite grateful, and that she has a small surprise ready for the naga.

== Notes ==
Keep circling counter-clockwise until reaching a ramp heading counterclockwise upstairs. There are Idra'kess, a level 79 elite with 39,120 health and two {{NPC||Idra'kess Mistress||mistress}} adds, each with 5216 health. Focus on the two mistresses, as their frostbolts hit for more than Idra'kess's melee swings. Once they're down, take Idra'kess down to half health. He will spawn a protection sphere that absorbs 90% of damage inflicted and channel a spell on Nespirah. A large number of abscesses will spawn too. Attack the abscesses to drop stacks of the shield, then finish him off. He doesn't stop the channel even after the sphere drops.

At 50% health:

:{{text|yell|Overseer Idra'kess|Now, you will watch as I complete the ritual and turn the beast against you!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Slay the Idra'kess Mistresses to destroy the shield!}}

:{{text|yell|Overseer Idra'kess|Nessspirah! Why do you turn against me?}}
Wipe:

Defeated:
