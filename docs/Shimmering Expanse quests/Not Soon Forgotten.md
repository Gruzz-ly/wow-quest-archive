== Objectives ==
Kill Varkul the Unrelenting.

This task is part of a {{NPC||Naz'jar Battlemaiden}} vision. If needed, use the [[Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden]] at a time focus to return to the vision.
*[[Varkul the Unrelenting]] slain

== Description ==
The [[Kvaldir]] leader has shown his rotting, ugly face but a short swim from here, down this hall. We kill him now and the Kvaldir occupation of our once beloved city shall be ended.

Beware Battlemaiden, for he is no weakling. He has many Kvaldir at his command. Some {{NPC||Sira'kess Sea Witch}}es have been dispatched to weaken him during your attack, but they will be interrupted if you let any of his Kvaldir attack them.

Show no mercy, Battlemaiden.

== Progress ==
Your foe is but a short swim down this hall. Go, and bring death with you.

== Completion ==
<The Kvaldir General crumples to the ground, defeated.>

<With this, the [[ruins of Vashj'ir]] have been claimed for {{NPC||Lady Naz'jar}}. her ultimate goals remain uncertain, but it is clear that the naga came here with purpose.>

<If only you could continue, you are sure that the answers to defeating the naga lie within this vision, but the Wavespeaker's magics are waning, and you are losing your connection with the Battlemaiden.>

== Notes ==
Head west along the hall to the far end. There, Varkul the Unrelenting, a level 81 elite kvaldir with 1.5 million health, awaits. He is being attacked by 5 sea witches who are stacking a +100% damage taken debuff on him. If the sea witches get interrupted, the debuff on Varkul drops. So keep the sea witches unperturbed, then get back on Varkul. Some {{NPC||Zin'jatar Warrior}}s and a {{NPC||Zin'jatar Stormsiren}} are also assisting.

Completing the quest ends the vision and players wake up back at the spot where they entered the vision, where the wavespeaker greets them.
