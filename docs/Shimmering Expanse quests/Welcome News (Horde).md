==Objectives==
Return to [[Legionnaire Nazgrim]] at [[Legion's Rest]].

==Description==
They'll probably send a skiff over, which may take a bit. I'll stay here to make contact.

You need to return to the cave immediately and let them know that rescue is on its way. We can only hope that the naga have not found them yet.

Go. Swim fast, <name>.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Robes of the Watery Savior|Harp Shell Wristguards|True Beacon Shoulderplates}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|90}}
*13850 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|33000}} at max level)

==Completion==
That is the best news I've heard in what seems like an eternity. We'll get the survivors moving over there to the surface as soon as possible. Perhaps we can forget that this whole nightmare ever happened.

Thank you, <name>.<br>
You've shown your worth down here. There will be a glorious spot in the Horde for you.

You should consider meeting us at the ships later, when you finish saying your goodbyes to the naga.
