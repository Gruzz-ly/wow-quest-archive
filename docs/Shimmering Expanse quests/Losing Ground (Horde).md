==Objectives==
Use [[Wavespeaker Tulra]]'s sea horse to return to [[Captain Vilethorn]] just north of the [[Quel'Dormir Gardens]].

==Description==
You'll have to catch me up more later. Right now, we need to get out of here before more [[naga]] push in. Make your way back to the forward post on the level below us.

Take my sea horse. We will meet you back there shortly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|78000}}
*27700 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|66000}} at max level)

==Completion==
You made it! After the attack at the forward post, I thought we might be the only ones left. It's good to see you in one piece, <class>.

==Notes==
Head to the forward base, but...
:{{text|say|Injured Lookout|They attacked while you were gone... the [[Captain Vilethorn|Captain]] fell fighting them off. The rest retreated to the cave, you should do the same.}}
''The corpses of the invading naga and many of the Horde Assault Volunteers are littered around the base.''
