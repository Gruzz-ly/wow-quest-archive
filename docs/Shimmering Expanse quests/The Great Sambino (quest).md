== Objectives ==
Find "{{NPC||The Great Sambino||Sam}}" at the western end of [[Silver Tide Trench]].

== Description ==
If you're heading down the trench, I'd like you to check in on one of our novice members for me.

His name is Sam, but he's likely to embellish it a bit. He doesn't really understand how members of the [[Earthen Ring]] work, buet he tries hard, so we try to give him the benefit of the doubt.

Don't get too wrapped up in helping him with his crazy schemes. Just make sure he's still in one piece and let me know so that I can have a little peace of mind.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||78}}

== Completion ==
Another fan of the Great Sambino! Come all this way for an autograph perhaps? I'm far too busy to be signing anything... move along now.

== Notes ==
Head out of the cave and swim west along the bottom of the trench toward the [[Abyssal Depths]] two find two goblin members of the Earthen Ring! Sambino and {{NPC||Felice}} are fighting off {{NPC||Agitated Green Sand Crab}}s.

Sam's gossip text:
:I'm the bleeding edge, baby! Elemental infused technologies. Exploding the depths of [[Azeroth]] for lost knowledge and new resources.
:Remember the name.

:I don't know about you, pal, but I can't breathe underwater.
[[File:Gossipgossipicon.png]] ''You're with the [[Earthen Ring]], I just figured you'd have a {{ability|Water Breathing|water breathing}} spell like the rest of them.''
:And miss out on wearing my awesome custom-made helmet? Not a chance.
