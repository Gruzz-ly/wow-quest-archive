== Objectives ==
Hold the bridge on [[Quel'Dormir Terrace]] until {{NPC||Lady Sira'kess||Lady Sira'kess'}} allies arrive.

This task is part of a {{NPC||Naz'jar Battlemaiden}} vision. If needed, use the [[Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden]] at a time focus to return to the vision.
*Hold the eastern end of QuelDormir Terrace
*Push the Kvaldir back across the bridge

== Description ==
Get to the bridge on the east, quickly. {{NPC||Lady Naz'jar}} and the {{NPC||Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar||Fathom-Lord}} should be there with whatever forces remain.

Follow our Lady's direction, as always. Hold the bridge until we can complete the ritual.

Once our allies arrive, the [[Kvaldir]] will be doomed.

== Progress ==
Stand with us, Battlemaiden. We shall not fall this day.

== Completion ==
I could ask for no more proficient a battlemaiden than you. You have done yourself a great honor this day.

== Notes ==
Head out the temple and take a right, then circle around to the west. [[Kvaldir Skinflayer]]s and [[Kvaldir Fearweaver|Fearweavers]] are attacking the line.

:{{text|yell|Lady Nazjar|Hold them back! Keep them away from the temple!}}
:{{text|yell|[[Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar]]|You march to your deaths! [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] shall see you wiped from the seas!}}
:{{text|say|Kvaldir Fearweaver|You will never take these waters from us!}}
:{{text|say|Kvaldir Fearweaver|These waters will be your grave.}}
:{{text|say|Kvaldir Skinflayer|Tides take you!}}
:{{text|say|Kvaldir Skinflayer|Tides, give me strength!}}

After a few minutes, Lady Naz'jar pushes ahead to the end of the bridge, where [[Hagrim Hopebreaker]] and his [[Kvaldir Dreadbringer|dreadbringers]] await.
:{{text|say|Lady Naz'jar|Move forward! Hold the bridge!}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Naz'jar|Cut them down, Battlemaiden!}}
:{{text|say|[[Fathom-Stalker Azjentus]]|Back to the sands with you, wretch!}}

:{{text|yell|Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar|Slaughter them all! Show no mercy, [[Naga|brothers]]!}}
:{{text|yell|Hagrim Hopebreaker|You should have left this city to the waves!}}
:{{text|say|Fathom-Stalker Azjentus|About as tough as seaweed too.}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Naz'jar|Stand fast! The ritual is almost complete.}}
:{{text|yell|Hagrim Hopebreaker|Your race is a disease upon the sea!}}

During the battle, taunt after taunt comes from both sides.
*{{text|yell|Fathom-Stalker Azjentus|Humph! Kind of them to stream in one by one!}}
*{{text|yell|Fathom-Stalker Azjentus|They must really like this city. Maybe it's the view?}}
*{{text|yell|Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar|The only peace you shall find is in death [[Kvaldir]]!}}
*{{text|yell|Hagrim Hopebreaker|Choke upon the sands of the Kvaldir!}}
*{{text|yell|Hagrim Hopebreaker|[[Neptulon]] will rise and wash your [[Naga|kind]] from [[Azeroth]]!}}

After another few minutes, the allies arrive! They're {{NPC||Deep Fiend}}s and {{NPC||Deep Subjugator||Subjugators}}! Capped off by a kraken, {{NPC||Ozumat}}, who finishes off Hagrim and the rest of the kvaldir with Dark Slaughter: Decimates any enemies foolish enough to share the water with this beast!
:{{text|say|Lady Naz'jar|Our allies have arrived! Push them back over the bridge, my brethren!}}

On success:
:{{text|say|Lady Naz'jar|We are victorious. In [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]]'s name.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Naz'jar|My Battlemaiden, once again you have earned my respect, and the respect of all of our people.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Naz'jar|You have surpassed your title. You are a Battlemaiden no longer. Take your new crown, [[Nar'jira]], champion of Azshara.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Naz'jar|With the summoning complete and the armies of Azshara gathering for war, [[Neptulon]] the Tidehunter will soon fall.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Naz'jar|All the oceans shall be ours, and then we shall look beyond.}}

Completing the quest concludes the vision—head back to the cave to finish off [[Visions of the Past: Rise from the Deep]].
