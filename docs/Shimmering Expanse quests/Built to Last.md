== Objectives ==
Reactivate 8 Nar'shola Wards.

This task is part of a {{NPC||Naz'jar Battlemaiden}} vision. If needed, use the [[Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden]] at a time focus to return to the vision.
*Nar'shola Wards activated x8

== Description ==
My lady, I have a request from the {{NPC||Lady Sira'kess||High Priestess}} that I am to pass along to you. Many of [[Ruins of Vashj'ir|the city']]s defenses remain from long before it sunk [[Great Sundering|beneath the waves]], and some of them are but a trivial task to reactivate, were it not for the countless [[Kvaldir]] that stand in our way.

We are told you are to be fighting on the [[Nar'shola Terrace|terrace above]]. We would do my lady a great service if you would but touch some of the devices as you pass. Your noble blood should prove more than sufficient to reactivate them.

== Progress ==
The High Priestess sends her thanks for agreeing to aid us in our efforts.

== Completion ==
The Nar'shola Wards are performing perfectly. I will inform the Mistress of the Tides of your aid immediately.

Thank you for your assistance, my lady.

== Notes ==
There are plenty of wards all along the terrace, so head south toward the end of the [[Nar'shola Terrace]] where another {{NPC||Sira'kess Tide Priestess}} awaits, not too far way from {{NPC||Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar}}.
