== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar.jpg||Suffering his first major defeat at [[Damplight Cavern]], Fathorm-Lord Zin'jatar retreated to the ruins to recover. It seems he didn't retreat quite far enough.}}
Kill Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar.
*[[Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar]] slain

== Description ==
The Fathom-Lord is here, at the far side of the ruins. He's still injured from our last battle.

I'll leave this pleasure to you. Make sure he doesn't get away this time.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Priapulid Bracers|Sea-Bending Gloves|Displaced Crown of Azrakir}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Waiting on something? I thought you'd appreciate the opportunity to handle this yourself.

Did I misjudge you?

== Completion ==
And with this, hopefully their attacks on us will calm for a while.

== Notes ==
Swim down to {{co|67.3|49.7|Shimmering Expanse}} at the southern edge of the ruins. The Fathom-Lord is already down to 116,066/464,265 health and swinging far more weakly. "Weakly" is roughly 1000 damage a swing on cloth, but still... better than what he was hitting for in the cavern.

On aggro:
:{{text|say|Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar|Ah, so you've left your hole? The Lady will claim you soon enough.}}

Defeated:
:{{text|say|Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar|You press on...to your deaths...fools...}}

The Fathom-Lord drops the [[Luminescent Pearl]], which continues the chain.
