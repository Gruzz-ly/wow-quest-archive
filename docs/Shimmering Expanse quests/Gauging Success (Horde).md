== Objectives ==
Scout the northwestern portion of the circular terrace and the tunnel under the main stairs to the north. Both locations are on [[Nar'shola Terrace]], the middle level of [[Ruins of Vashj'ir|the ruins]].
*Scout the Tunnel to the north
*Scout the Northwestern Terrace

== Description ==
Vicious louts... they did a lot of damage with those spears.

<The {{NPC||Captain Vilethorn||Captain}} winces slightly as he clutches a wound on his side.

We'll hold here as long as we can for all the men to make it. I need someone to scout their numbers to see how much damage we did.

One of the biggest groups of them was around the corner on the northwest portion of the round terrace, and the other was a bit farther to the north in the small tunnel, also on this middle level of the ruins.

Up for some scouting?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Any word... on their numbers?

== Completion ==
Still so many? They must want something very important to come here in such numbers.

I will be honest with you, <name>, because you deserve at least that: I don't know how much hope there is. We will retreat shortly, but we won't be able to defend ourselves when they strike back. We don't have anywhere to run... we're running out of options.

I'm sorry. I should keep such thoughts to myself. Do me a favor and don't mention that to any of the men. I'll figure something out.

From the quest giver's position, circle clockwise to the southwest around the terrace, talking to soldiers along the way. While scouting, spot the second Vision of the Battlemaiden due west of the rendezvous point at {{coords|28.9|78.7|Shimmering Expanse}}. Keep heading north past the circular part of the ruins to find a tunnel a bit to the north with lots of naga coming out. Circle back around to the southeast to get back to the quest givers, talking to any last soldiers necessary.
