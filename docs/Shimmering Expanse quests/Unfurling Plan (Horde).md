==Objectives==
Collect 8 Coils of Kvaldir Rope.
*[[Coil of Kvaldir Rope]] (8)

==Description==
Survival kits never have any rope. It makes no sense! Rope and bombs, that's all they should store. The rest of this stuff is just a waste of space.

Except maybe the balloon. That's coming in handy right now.

I bet those Kvaldir have rope. They're always riding around in boats, tying knots, dressing in nets. Go take some rope from them! I must have it for our plan to work. It is non-optional.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|78000}}
*27700 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|66000}} at max level)

==Progress==
The rope ties the whole plan together!

==Completion==
This is great! I love it. It should work per... ewww! Is this stuff braided with hair?

Doesn't matter. Almost done. This thing will be ready in the twist of a rope.

==Notes==
Head southeastish. There are rope ties on the ground. Additionally, the [[Kvaldir Fleshcarver]]s and [[Kvaldir Seahorror]]s drop them too.
