==Objectives==
Gather 8 Anemone Chemical Samples using the Anemone Chemical Extraction Device.
*Anemone Chemicals Gathered x8
*[[Anemone Chemical Extraction Device]] (provided)

==Description==
I have an idea. A brilliant idea! Those [[Anemone Frenzy|clown-looking fish]] have developed a symbiotic defensive relationship with the anemones. Having dismissed anemone disguise plausibilities, I've uncovered the chemical attractor that lures the fish.

I have a gyrocoptic thermascrub extractor that I've brought down to take samples. Use it to extract the chemical attractor from several of the anemones, then bring the samples back to me for rapid synthesis and deployment.

Go with haste! Brilliance is waiting!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==

These chemicals are of utmost importance to my defensive diving strategies. Delay not, for we are all in murloc-laced peril!

==Completion==
Superb! Chemicals abound!

My instantaneous chemical synthesizer is already pre-tested and prepared. Your deployment compound shall be ready in the blink of an eye!

==Notes==
The anemone are on the cliff faces, not the bottom of the gorge, with frenzy guarding them. Kill the frenzy then move close to the anemone and use the item near the orange glow.
