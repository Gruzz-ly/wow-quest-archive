==Objectives==
Collect 12 of Fiasco's Stray Parts.
*[[Fiasco's Stray Parts]] (12)

==Description==
It was that darn crab!

Here I thought that all the exercise from walking here was making me super buff. My pack just kept getting lighter and lighter. But no! That crab snipped a hole in my bag and all my parts were falling out the whole way here.

Please, help a sexy [[goblin]] out, will ya? Go back and help me pick up all of my stray parts. I'm sure those conniving vicious [[Sandskin Pincer|little crabs]] ran off with some of them too.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Part-Picker Wraps|Oddly Revealing Chestguard|Pocket-Sized Mace}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
Never understimate the appeal of something shiny.

==Completion==
Glad you know a quick buck when you see one. Pleasure doing business with you, buddy.

==Notes==
While up on the ridge above [[Legion's Rest]] to the south of [[Nespirah]], keep an eye out for [[Fiasco Sizzlegrin]] holding out near an air pocket. He offers this collection quest. There are actually parts on the ground. Otherwise, just kill crabs.
