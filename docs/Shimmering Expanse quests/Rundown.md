==Objectives==
Use Toshe's Hunting Spear to run down 20 fleeing Zin'jatar naga.
*[[Fleeing Zin'jatar Fathom-Stalker]] slain x20
*[[Toshe's Hunting Spears]] (provided)

==Description==
They're getting away!

These are the same [[naga]] that attacked the boats and carried away our friends. We cannot let them escape!

Take these spears and run them down with {{item|Vashj'ir Seahorse|that seahorse}} of yours... don't waste your time dismounting, just keep after them and kill all that you can with the spears.

I will try to hunt down that [[Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar|Fathom-Lord]]. Meet me at the far end of the ledge when you're done.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
Our other allies are in the cave below. Things look safe from here, but it's hard to be certain.

Did you do as I asked of you?

==Completion==
Swift work. Very impressive.

That Fathom-Lord got away... I don't see him anywhere. He's most certainly the key to finding our captured friends.

I will hunt him down. He cannot stay hidden for long.

==Notes==
Jump in, mount up and get moving! The naga are swimming south out of the cave to the southern end of the grotto. Follow the crevasse to the west south toward [[Nespirah]]. At the very edge of the grotto is Toshe, waiting at {{co|53.3|33.0|Shimmering Expanse}} just across the chasm from [[Silver Tide Hollow]].

On accept:
:{{text|say|Toshe Chaosrender|The naga escaped out of the tunnel ahead. Show them no mercy, <class>.}}
