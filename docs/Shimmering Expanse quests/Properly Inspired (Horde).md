== Objectives ==
Gather 8 Bloated Kelp Bulbs hanging under the southern terrace.
*[[Bloated Kelp Bulb]] x8

== Description ==
Been all over the place. Blown all kinds of things up. I thought I might have some trouble carrying on the trend, what with the water and all, but it's just a matter of inspiration.

I found something volatile enough to make bombs out of! There's a bunch of kelp hanging under the terrace to the southwest. Normally kelp stores gas that makes it float - this kelp produces a different kind of heavy gas. it keeps it hanging, but also makes for great explosions.

Gather me some?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Tick, tock, tick, tock. Always in such a hurry. No time for innovation. What I wouldn't give for a lab again!

== Completion ==
You are brave indeed! I've seen you battling all manner of murloc, naga, and pointy-toothed fish, but that was nothing! The way you just sling those kelp bulbs under your arm like that is a new kind of fearless. BOOM! You could blow up at any second.

You're my kind of <race>.

== Notes ==
Head to the tunnel where the Alliance forward post is to the southwest, if Horde. Look up. See the kelp hanging from the ceiling. Inspect closely. There are big balls of kelp hanging near the bottom of the kelp strands.
