==Objectives==
Apply the Anemone Chemical Application Device to 8 [[Glimmerdeep Diver|Clam Divers]].
*Clam Divers Odorfied x8
*[[Anemone Chemical Application Device]] (provided)

==Description==
Marvelous creation if I do say so myself. Ready for deployment.

Simply spray the clam divers with a bit of the chemical and they shall soon be accompanied by a protective aquatic companion. You can even spray yourself to similar effect if you desire.

Speaking of desire, I would highly recommend that you moderate deployment of the chemical attractor to minimal applications. Large doses could result in undesirable effects...

Undesirable for you anyway. Likely very desirable for the fish.

Away!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Gloves of Piscine Attraction|Chestplate of Fragrant Desire|Prototype Chemical Applicator}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
Fishy companions for all!

==Completion==
Well done my odorific associate. You are both swift and assiduous, if I do say so myself. May your future travels be rampant with inspiration and opulence.

==Notes==
A Frenzy swims over and accompanies whoever is sprayed.  The Frenzy does not aid you in fights, it just ... looks cool?

*A fish? For me? It's adorable.
*Hexascrub, right? Of course.
*Do I want to know where this stuff is from?
*I don't want to be ungrateful, but was that absolutely necessary?
*This will make me feel a tad safer from those murlocs. Thank you.
*What the... disgusting!
*Thanks... I think.
* Oh come on.  As if I haven't been through enough.
