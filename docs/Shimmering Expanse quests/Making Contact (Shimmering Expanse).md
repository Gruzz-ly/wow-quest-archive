== Objectives ==
Observe as {{NPC||Earthmender Duarn}} attemps to communicate with [[Nespirah]].

== Description ==
I can't believe that Nespirah would willingly allow these naga to take residence in her shell. As I see it, one of two things have happened: they have convinced her to willingly join their cause, or they have weakened her to a point where she cannot fight back. Either one is bad.

Here in this chamber, I should be able to communicate directly with Nespirah. Let us find out for ourselves. Speak to me when you are prepared, <class>.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|3|90}}

== Progress ==
Nespirah needs our help. If nothing else, I can sense that.

== Completion ==
That didn't go well. For some reason, the beast won't speak back to me.

<Duarn is clearly frustrated.>

If only {{NPC||Erunak Stonespeaker||Erunak}} had not left us! He would know what to do.

== Notes ==
Talk to Duarn:
:This creature... she is quite old, and very wise. We stand to learn a great deal about [[Vashj'ir]] and the naga, if we can only speak with Nespirah.
