==Description==
The loss of [[Xe'ra]] is a blow, especially to [[Turalyon]]. But even the Light Mother could not be allowed to force destiny upon us.

I wish [[Illidan Stormrage|Illidan]] had found another way to refuse her... but I too have had choices imposed upon me by the [[naaru]].

This must not distract us from our mission. Now that we have the [[Army of the Light]] survivors with us, it is time to press our attack.

We need a foothold on the Antoran Wastes from which we can assault the [[Antorus, the Burning Throne|Burning Throne]]. It is time to deprive [[Sargeras]] of his prize!
