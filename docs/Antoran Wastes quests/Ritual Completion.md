== Objectives ==
* [[Everburning Doombringer]] slain

== Description ==
: {{text|say|[[Illidan Stormrage]]|An [[infernal]] has crashed down, killing the very masters who spawned it. Destroy this monstrosity before it jeopardizes our advance!}}

== Rewards ==
* +75 reputation with [[Army of the Light]]

== Completion ==
: {{text|say|Illidan Stormrage|The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] grow reckless. They reek of desperation!}}

== Notes ==
Triggers at the [[Altar of Darkest Rites]] in [[Antoran Wastes]]. At level, it can be very difficult to kill by yourself due to Ignition, so it may be best to wait for others to show up first if you can't out-dps it before repeated Ignitions kills you. If you group up for it, note that completion will not count in a raid.

== Patch changes ==
