==Objectives==
Collect 50 Pristine Argunite from [[Invasion Points]], Rare encounters, or treasure chests on [[Argus]].
*[[Pristine Argunite]] (50)

==Description==
There is a rare and precious resource to be found in these wastes, <name>.

Argunite was once abundant on Argus. Its magical properties helped [[eredar]] civilization thrive. Far better for us to make use of its power than the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].

Seek out all the pristine argunite you can, champion. Every bit you recover will aid our cause.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|va=300}}
* +1,000 reputation with [[Argussian Reach]]
* +1,000 reputation with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
Victory requires every resource we can muster.

==Completion==
A good start, hero. There is plenty more where that came from.

==Progression==
...

*{{Patch 7.3.5|note=Now rewards 1,000 reputation with Argussian Reach (was 250) and Army of the Light (was none).}}
*{{Patch 7.3.0|note=Added.}}
