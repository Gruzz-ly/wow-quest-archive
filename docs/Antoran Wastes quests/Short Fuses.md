==Objectives==
*[[Legion Hullbreaker]] fuses replaced (6)

You will receive:
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Completion==

==Notes==
There are [[Explosive Munitions]] sitting around; these will buff you with an extra action button of three powerful explosives for five minutes. It must be used up or expire first before you can pick up more. These can be very useful, especially against [[Hulking Fiend]]s if necessary.
