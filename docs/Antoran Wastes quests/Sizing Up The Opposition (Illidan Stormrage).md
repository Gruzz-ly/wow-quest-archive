==Objectives==
Speak with [[Turalyon]].

==Description==
No doubt your High Exarch will fret at the news that we lack the resources to assault [[Antorus, the Burning Throne|Antorus]]. He is not used to believing his vaunted [[Army of the Light]] to be inadequate.

His pride is no concern of mine. While he plots a new strategy, I will bathe the ground in [[demon]] blood.

Go. There is much to be done before we can achieve our final victory.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|85|}}

==Completion==
<Turalyon listens in grim silence.>

==Notes==
Use the nearby [[Lightforged beacon]] to return to the [[Vindicaar]].

;Quest completion
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|This is the Legion's heart, and is fortified as such. An assault now would be madness. We will need additional preparation to tip the balance.}}

;Speak to Turalyon again
:I am glad that [[Khadgar]] chose to accompany you. His is the only face among your cohort that I recognize. Has it truly been so long?

:<Turalyon's gaze shifts away from you.>

:Hah! I can see he still hasn't changed. Speak his name and...

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}

:''Khadgar walks up the stairs starboard side.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|It is good to see you again, my friends. When I couldn't find you after the devastation of [[Draenor]], I wasn't sure what to think.}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|We feared for you as well, Khadgar. But I think part of me knew it would take more than the explosion of a planet to slow you down.}}
:{{text|say|[[Alleria Windrunner]]|[[Kurdran Wildhammer|Kurdran]] and [[Danath Trollbane|Danath]] are safe as well?}}
: ''Khadgar reaches the top level.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Indeed, though I don't get to see them as often as I'd like. When this is all behind us, perhaps the [[Sons of Lothar]] should share a reunion feast!}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|I agree. It's been a long time, but as I recall it was your turn to buy the drinks, Khadgar.}}
: ''You can hear the smile in Khadgar's voice.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Well, I don't know about that...}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|''Definitely'' your turn. Never question an [[elf]]'s memory... even after a thousand years.}}
:''Khadgar walks back downstairs.''

;Randomly on another arrival to the ''Vindicaar''
:''Alleria and [[Vereesa Windrunner|Vereesa]] are seen walking together down starboard ramp to the [[Navigation Console]]. Alleria speaks with angered denial, then with bitterness about the past.''
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|''Impossible!'' I refuse to believe she now leads the [[Horde]], not after all they did to our people during the [[Second War|war]].}}
: ''Vereesa's voice is soft and saddened.''
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|There is more. I'm... I am not sure how to explain the rest. Or is this is even the time or place to--}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I ''must'' know, Vereesa. What fate befell [[Sylvanas Windrunner|our sister]]?}}
: ''They scale the stairs.''
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|Give me a moment. I will do my best to explain...}}
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|Perhaps we had best discuss the matter in private.}}
: ''They turn away from facing each other to return to their regular places.''
