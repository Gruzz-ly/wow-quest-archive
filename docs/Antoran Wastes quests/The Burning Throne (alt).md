'''The Burning Throne''' is the lore quest that opens the way to the raid [[Antorus, the Burning Throne]]. This is the alternate version for those that skipped [[Seat of the Triumvirate: The Crest of Knowledge]], perhaps on alts.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Grand Artificer Romuul]] while above the [[Antoran Wastes]] to open the way to [[Antorus]].
*Speak with Romuul above the Antoran Wastes

==Description==
The time has come, <name>, to begin our assault upon Antorus. Everything we have fought for, everything our friends and family have sacrificed, has brought us to this moment.

We will fire [[:Light's Judgment]] upon the walls of the accursed citadel and storm their seat of power. We will end the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].

After all you have done, it is fitting that you have the honor. Speak to Romuul and let us finish our mission.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]
*+250 reputation with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
We have not come this far to stop now.

==Completion==
After so many years... so many sacrifices... victory is finally within our grasp.

It matters not. What does matter is that the cannon will do its job. We will destroy the gates of Antorus and defeat the Legion.

Are you ready, <name>?

::''The cannon reconfigures itself, apparently for a high-powered shot. The 'barrel' spins up to a high speed, then fires a concentrated beam of [[Light]] at the gigantic mass of solid stone blocking the entrance and blowing it to smithereens.''
