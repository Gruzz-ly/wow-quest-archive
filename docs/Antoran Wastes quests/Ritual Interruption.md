== Objectives ==
* [[Banishment Stone Shard]] (8)
* Banish the [[Everburning Doombringer]]

== Description ==
: {{text|say|[[Illidan Stormrage]]|Legion summoners are calling forth a massive [[infernal]] to rain terror upon our allies. Put an end to their ritual!}}

== Rewards ==
* +75 reputation with [[Army of the Light]]

== Completion ==
: {{text|say|Illidan Stormrage|The [[Burning Legion|Legion's]] plans shatter as its [[Burning Crusade]] crumbles to dust.}}

== Notes ==
Triggers at the [[Altar of Darkest Rites]] in [[Antoran Wastes]]. Kill the [[Nether Acolyte]]s and [[Wrathguard Overseer]]s for their Banishment Stone Shards, a 100% drop.

There are Overseers that are guarding the path leading up to the quest area that are regularly up (depending if someone already killed them, ect). If you were to lure them inside the quest area, you can kill them for shards; if not, you won't be 'on the quest' and no shards will drop. By using them to complete the quest, it would help get rid of them and you likely won't have to deal with their aggro when you leave.

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 7.3.0|note=Added.}}
