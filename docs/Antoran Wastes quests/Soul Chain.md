== Objectives ==
* [[Broken Soul]]s freed (8)
* [[Talisman of the Prophet]] (provided)

== Description ==
: {{text|say|[[Prophet Velen]]|So many of my kinsmen's souls endure torment at the hands of the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]. Free them, that they may rest.}}

==Rewards==
* +150 reputation with [[Army of the Light]]

== Completion ==
: {{text|say|Prophet Velen|I hope my brothers and sisters will know some measure of peace.}}

== Notes ==
There are two souls each in the two ground floor chambers, and some interspersed around the outside. There are six above on the second level. The best method would be to clear the second level and get the rest from a chamber.

There are also [[Broken Soul Fragment]] crystals around, which give a 10 min buff.

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 8.1.0|note=''[[Legion]]'' World Quests for the [[Highmountain Tribe]], [[Nightfallen (faction)|Nightfallen]], [[Army of the Light]], and [[Argussian Reach]] now reward increased reputation.}}
* {{Patch 7.3.0|note=Added.}}
