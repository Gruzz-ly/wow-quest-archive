==Objectives==
Use the [[Scouting Map]] and complete the mission, "Gambit in the Wastes."

* Complete the mission, "[[Gambit in the Wastes]]."

==Description==
<Class title>, I could use your help. The [[Army of the Light]] is coordinating an attack against the [[Spirit Crucible]], [[Terminus]], and [[Shaper's Rise]] to cripple the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s ability to wage war outside of the [[Antoran Wastes]]. We do not have enough soldiers to defend our footholds and execute this operation.

Will you approach the <class>s on our behalf? This gambit could succeed with them fighting by our side. We can paralyze the Legion war machine.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[Lightforged Equipment]]

==Progress==
Will they fight by our side, <class title>?

==Completion==
Three Legion facilities decimated in a single operation. Extraordinary.
