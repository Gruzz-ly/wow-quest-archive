==Objectives==
Speak with [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] at [[Light's Purchase]].

==Description==
Now that we have established a foothold, we need to rendezvous with our soldiers in the field.

We have an [[Army of the Light]] encampment to the south, near where the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] is keeping their strongest warriors in some sort of stasis.

Alleria went to scout the area. Find her, and see what information she has gathered.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[Lightforged Beacon: Light's Purchase]]

You will also receive: {{cost|4|85|}}

==Progress==
The camp lies to the south. When you find the large stasis capsules, look for a passage on the left.

==Completion==
We have a foothold here... for now.

I am unsure how long it could hold out against a sustained assault.

==Notes==

Talk to Alleria:
{{dialogue|
Welcome to the heart of Argus.

They are truly endless. We must find a way to bring a final end to them.

There is much prey to be had here.

Even here, I can hear it calling to me. Its hunger...

{{gossip|What information have you been able to gather, Alleria?}}

The outlook is grim.

Mounting a direct assault from this location would prove far too costly. What is more, those cannons atop the wall may well be powerful enough to bring down the [[Vindicaar]].

I suggest using this foothold to launch guerilla strikes. Assassinate key members of their leadership and wreak havoc within their ranks.

I know this is not what you or Turalyon were hoping to hear, but a patient hunter must know when to strike.
