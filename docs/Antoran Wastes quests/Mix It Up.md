==Objectives==
*Wyrmtongue slain (5)
*[[Legion Unguent]] destroyed (10)

==Description==
:{{text|say|[[High Exarch Turalyon]]|My soldiers speak of demonic brews that melt armor and disfigure flesh. Find the source of this insidious alchemy and destroy it!}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Completion==
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|To think [[Burning Legion|Legion]] soldiers drink that swill... disgusting to the last!}}

==Notes==
*Most of the unguents are in [[Chief Alchemist Munculus]]'s building, who also counts for the quest if he happens to be up. If he is up, try to get to all the bottles in the room before he dies or start the second he dies, lessening the chances you're still inside when he respawns.
** Kill: [[Filthy Assistant]]s and [[Potion Researcher]]s.
