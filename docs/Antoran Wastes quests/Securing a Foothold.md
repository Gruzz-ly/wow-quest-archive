==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Antoran Wastes]] and place the [[Lightforged beacon|Lightforged Beacon]].

* (Optional): Speak with [[Grand Artificer Romuul|Romuul]] to reach the surface
* Place the Lightforged Beacon

==Description==
[[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] and I have scouted this area before, alongside some of our best soldiers. We stationed encampments on either side of our current position, but I fear they will have come under heavy attack. They need reinforcements.

Our first order of business is to set up a teleportation beacon directly below the [[Vindicaar]]. From there, we will have access to both fronts.

Speak to Romuul when you are ready to head down to the surface.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[Lightforged Beacon: Antoran Wastes]]

You will also receive: {{cost|1|94|}}

==Progress==
We need that teleportation beacon set up if we are to reinforce our positions.

==Completion==
Good. From here we can quickly access and reinforce each of the encampments.

==Gains==
...

==Notes==
;Grand Artificer Romuul
:I cannot believe what has befallen our world.

:Looking out there, I see nothing but hatred. Nothing but desolation.

:Part of me is glad that I must stay here aboard the Vindicaar. I would not want to set hoof on that accursed ground.

:I have locked in coordinates below our position, close enough for you to establish the teleporter. Let me know when you have finished your preparations.

''{{gossip|I am ready, Romuul.}}''

: ''You are teleported down.''

;Beacon placed at [[Hope's Landing]]
:{{text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|That should do it! I am adding the coordinates to our beacon units.}}
: ''In the the meantime, Turalyon uses the teleporter and steps out onto the surface.''
