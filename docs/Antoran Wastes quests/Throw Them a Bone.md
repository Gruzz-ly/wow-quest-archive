== Objectives ==
* [[Voracious Scavenger]] slain (8)
* [[Slave Trap]]s disarmed (3)

== Description ==
: {{text|say|[[High Exarch Turalyon]]|Demon beasts and deadly traps slow our advance. Deal with these impediments!}}

== Rewards ==
* +75 reputation with [[Army of the Light]]

== Completion ==
: {{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|The way forward is clear. Our campaign to bring down the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] carries on!}}

== Notes ==
* Triggers at the [[Scavenger's Boneyard]] in [[Antoran Wastes]].
* Combat pets and bodyguards can set off the traps if they move through them. This can particularly happen if they're running up to catch up with you on your mount.

At the southern side of the Scavenger's Boneyard is a pit of bones surrounding a small stone mound in the middle. This is where [[The Many-Faced Devourer]] is summoned from; if you can summon it, getting a group while you're here could be advantageous.

* {{Patch 7.3.0|note=Added.}}
