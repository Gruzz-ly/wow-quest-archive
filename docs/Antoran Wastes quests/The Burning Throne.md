'''The Burning Throne''' is the lore quest that opens the way to the raid [[Antorus, the Burning Throne]]. This is the mainline version for those that have completed [[Seat of the Triumvirate: The Crest of Knowledge]].

==Objectives==
Use the Crown of the Triumvirate while above the [[Antoran Wastes]] to open the way to [[Antorus]].

* [[Crown of the Triumvirate]] activated above the Antoran Wastes

==Description==
The time has come, <name>, to begin our assault upon Antorus. Everything we have fought for, everything our friends and family have sacrificed, has brought us to this moment.

We will fire [[:Light's Judgment]] upon the walls of the accursed citadel and storm their seat of power. We will end the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].

After all you have done, it is fitting that you have the honor. Activate the Crown of the Triumvirate and let us finish our mission.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]
*+250 reputation with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
We have not come this far to stop now.

==Completion==
After so many years... so many sacrifices... victory is finally within our grasp.

==Notes==
;Quest accept:
:{{text|say|[[High Exarch Turalyon]]|This is it, champion. Now we assault the heart of the Legion itself.}}

;Activate the Crown
:''A cutscene starts outside the ''[[Vindicaar]]'', and as [[Grand Artificer Romuul]] speaks, zooms in to Light's Judgment on the underside of the hull.''
:{{text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|Now, fire the gun! For Argus! For our people!}}
:''The cannon reconfigures itself, apparently for a high-powered shot. The 'barrel' spins up to a high speed, then fires a concentrated beam of [[Light]] at the gigantic mass of solid stone blocking the entrance and blowing it to smithereens.''
