'''You Survived!''' is the first quest for the [[draenei]], in [[Ammen Vale]].

== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Proenitus]] at the [[Crash Site]] in [[Ammen Vale]].

== Description ==
Nevermind my injuries, <brother/sister>. It's a miracle that any of us are alive!

It didn't look like you'd pull through; you've been in suspension for weeks.

Something happened and the [[Exodar]] crashed. Many have died.

But I'm relieved that you are alive, <name>. With you leading our efforts, I'm sure we'll get to safety soon! Proenitus asked me to send you to him when you awoke. He's waiting for you at the bottom of the hill. Just follow the path southwest.

==Completion==
<Name>, by my eternal soul, it is good to see you!  I don't know why the Exodar crashed.  Only those of us that were in this part of the ship remain.

There's not much time if we're to save everyone that we can!

==Notes==
Proenitus is straight ahead down the path in front of the Crash Site, you should be able to see his yellow question mark appear as soon as you accept the quest from Megelon.

==Progression==
