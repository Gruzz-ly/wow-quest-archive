# Draenei starting experience

[[File:WorldMap-AmmenValeStart.jpg|thumb|Area map]]
The '''draenei starting experience''' begins in [[Ammen Vale]] on [[Azuremyst Isle]]. Players join the [[Draenei]] at the crash site, just after falling from the sky after a devastating interworldly journey. The first order of business is to go around helping the wounded Draenei. After that, there is more work to be done as the crash of the Exodar has caused damage to the local ecosystem and [[Botanist Taerix]] needs help resolving these problems. An unexpected twist occurs when it is revealed that the Blood Elves who caused the Exodar's crash are also on Azeroth, and some are in Ammen Vale! After dealing with them, [[Technician Zhanaa]] manages to repair the ship's holographic emitter and contacts another group of survivors in [[Azure Watch]]. Players are sent onwards to help Azure Watch and to request further aid for Ammen Vale.
