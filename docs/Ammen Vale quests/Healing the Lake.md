==Objectives==
Disperse the Neutralizing Agent at the [[Irradiated Power Crystal (object)|Irradiated Power Crystal]], then return to [[Botanist Taerix]] at the [[Crash Site]] in [[Ammen Vale]].
* Disperse the Neutralizing Agent
* [[Neutralizing Agent]] (provided)

==Description==
Thank goodness, I think it'll work! I have an agent for you to spread at [[Silverline Lake]] to the south. It will neutralize the effects of the irradiated ship's power crystal that fell there.

Swim out and scatter the neutralizing agent near it. Don't worry, you won't be exposed long enough to become irradiated.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*250 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
The sooner you disperse the agent at the lake, the fewer native creatures that will be mutated by drinking the water, including ourselves!

I'm sorry that we can't do anything to help the poor creatures that have already been infected. If only my lab equipment were intact.

==Completion==
From what you describe, the neutralizing agent worked! I just wish that I knew how long it will last; we really need to remove that power crystal from the lake entirely.

Thank you, <name>! I will tell [[Apprentice Tedon|Tedon]] to try the neutralizing agent on one of the captured beasts at once.
