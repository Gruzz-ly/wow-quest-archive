==Objectives==
Gather 10 Lasher Samples and return them to [[Botanist Taerix]] at the [[Crash Site]] in [[Ammen Vale]].
*[[Lasher Sample]] (10)

==Description==
The [[Silverline Lake|nearby lake]] has been contaminated by one of the ship's power crystals. Many of the plants and animals of [[Ammen Vale]] have been mutated because of this.

I have a theory on how to heal the lake, but I must have samples from the [[Mutated Root Lasher|mutated lashers]] for analysis. They can be found to the west in the [[Ammen Fields]].

Will you help me, <class>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||35}}
*170 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
I'll need all of the samples in good condition if we're to have a chance of cleansing the lake.

We don't have much time, <class>!

==Completion==
These will do. Thank you, <class>!

While you were out, I managed to gather some equipment together to make an analysis of the samples.  This should only take a moment.
