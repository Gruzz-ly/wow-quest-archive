'''Blood Elf Spy''' is an [[Alliance]]-only quest in the [[draenei]] starting area [[Ammen Vale]]. Players must kill [[Surveyor Candress]], a blood elf in charge of a group of scouts sent by [[Kael'thas]] to investigate the new home of the [[draenei]].

==Objectives==
Slay Surveyor Candress and then inform [[Vindicator Aldar]] at the [[Crash Site]] in [[Ammen Vale]].
*[[Surveyor Candress]] slain

==Description==
I have a plan. We must kill their leader. Without their master, perhaps they will retreat to regroup. We just need to buy time until the repairs are completed.

Then Vindicator Aldar must know of this. Kill the surveyor, then return and tell him what we've found.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Exodar Bastard Sword
|Exodar Dagger
|Exodar Maul
|Exodar Shortsword
|Exodar Crossbow
|Exodar Staff
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||3|}}
* 670 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Then it is true... a scouting party of blood elves here in Ammen Vale! How did they follow us?

I'll get someone out there immediately to bring [[Tolaan]] back.

==Completion==
I thank you for dealing with the blood elf surveyor. Surely she was their leader. Rest assured, we will deal with whatever remnant of them is still nearby.

Please, take one of these weapons as a sign of my gratitude.

==Notes==
[[Surveyor Candress]] is in front of the tent at the top of the Blood Elf encampment at [[Shadow Ridge]].  She spawns fairly often, and should be easy to kill.

==Progression==
