'''Spare Parts'''  is an [[Alliance]]-only quest in the [[draenei]] starting region [[Ammen Vale]] in which players are sent to collect parts from the crashed ship which were scattered across the vale, then subsequently stolen by the owlkin inhabiting the area. [[Technician Zhanaa]] hopes to use the parts to fix the holographic emitter which was damaged in the crash. Get the quest [[Inoculation]] along with this one, since it it's objective is in the same area.

==Objectives==
Collect 4 {{loot|Common|Emitter Spare Part|Emitter Spare Parts}} and then return to [[Technician Zhanaa]] at the [[Crash Site]] in [[Ammen Vale]].
*[[Emitter Spare Part]] (4)

==Description==
We managed to recover a damaged holographic emitter from the crash. If we repair it, we'll have a chance to find other survivors outside of Ammen Vale.

There were devices from the ship that could be salvaged for spare parts in the area, but the local owlkin carried them off before we could get to them.

<Name>, you must go south to Nestlewood Thicket and Hills to find the spare parts.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Beaten Plate Leggings
|Rough Leather Leggings
|Hand Sewn Pants
|Coarse Mail Leggings
}}

You will also receive:
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
When we have those spare parts, I know that we'll get this emitter repaired. With any luck there will be someone else out there left to talk to.

==Completion==
Let me take a look at those.

Yes, I think that these will do nicely; good job, <name>. The emitter is rather complex so it may take some time to finish the repairs. I'll let you know when it's ready.

In the meantime, you might see if [[Vindicator Aldar]] has anything he could use you for.

==Notes==
The {{loot|Common|Emitter Spare Part|Emitter Spare Parts}} can be gathered by right clicking the crystal gizmos scattered through the owlkin territories of the [[Nestlewood Thicket]] and [[Nestlewood Hills]], southeast of the [[Crash Site]]. You may want to do the quest [[Inoculation]] now as well, since it requires getting close to the uninfected owlkin here.

[[Technician Zhanaa]] can be found at the back entrance to the ship at the [[Crash Site]]. Talk to her to receive this quest.
