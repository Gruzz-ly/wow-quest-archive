'''The Missing Scout''' is an [[Alliance]]-only quest in which players must locate one of [[Vindicator Aldar]]'s scouts, named [[Tolaan]].

==Objectives==
Find and speak with [[Tolaan]] at [[Shadow Ridge]] in [[Ammen Vale]].

==Description==
We now have several separate confirmations of unusual activity up on the [[Shadow Ridge]].

This is disturbing; we thought that the scouting missions already undertaken had been thorough. One of my scouts hasn't reported back yet.

<Class>, I need you to head southwest to the other side of [[Silverline Lake]] and find [[Tolaan]], and see what has delayed him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*110 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Completion==
Help... [[Blood elf|blood elves]]!  They... ambushed... me.  Don't have... long.

==Notes==
[[Tolaan]] is kneeling near the [[blood elf]] encampment, which is to the southwest of the [[Crash Site]]. The area is known as [[Shadow Ridge]]. Talk to [[Tolaan]] to complete this quest.
