==Objectives==
Gather 3 Corrupted Flowers and return them to [[Apprentice Vishael]] at the [[Crash Site]] in [[Ammen Vale]].
* [[Corrupted Flower]] (3)

==Description==
The [[Ammen Fields]] to the west are the primary breeding ground of the local [[lasher]] population. With the corruption of the water table from the nearby lake, [[Botanist Taerix]] is worried that the lashers will not be able to repopulate themselves once we've cleansed the lake.

Go to the Ammen Fields and pick some of the corrupted flowers for me so that I might take a look at them and see what can be done. You should be able to identify them by their uncharacteristic red petals.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||50}}
*250 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
Hello, <class>.  Do you have those flowers yet?

==Completion==
These look like fine specimens.  Thank you for performing the field work.  Once I can find the time to analyze these, I should be able to tell what it will take to restore the fields.
