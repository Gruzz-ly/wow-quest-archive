'''The Emitter''' is an [[Alliance]]-only quest in the [[draenei]] starting area, [[Ammen Vale]]. This quest is only available after a chain which starts with [[Inoculation]] from [[Vindicator Aldar]] at the [[Crash Site]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Technician Zhanaa]] at the [[Crash Site]] in [[Ammen Vale]].

==Description==
<Name>, while you were out investigating the [[Shadow Ridge]], Zhanaa here has been going on about the holographic emitter. You might want to speak with her.

==Completion==
I got it, I got it! I think I managed to fix the emitter! Here, I'll just activate this last crystal and that should do it.

Take a look at the emitter, <name>. It looks like it's beginning to work... someone is appearing!

==Notes==
