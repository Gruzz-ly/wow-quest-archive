'''Inoculation''' is an [[Alliance]]-only quest in the [[draenei]] starting region [[Ammen Vale]] in which players use an [[Inoculating Crystal]] to protect the native owlkin from being affected by the [[Bloodmyst Radiation|radiation]] put off by the crashed bits of the [[Exodar]].

== Objectives ==
[[File:Quest - Inoculation TCG.jpg|thumb|In the [[TCG]].]]
Use the Inoculating Crystal on 6 Nestlewood Owlkin. Then return to [[Vindicator Aldar]] at the [[Crash Site]] in [[Ammen Vale]].
*[[Nestlewood Owlkin]] inoculated (6)
*[[Inoculating Crystal]] (provided)

== Description ==
[[Zhanaa]] needs our help to salvage parts from the [[Exodar]]. [[Botanist Taerix|Taerix]] prepared an inoculum that can be given to the Nestlewood [[owlkin]] that live in the area of a lot of the salvage.

Just get close to the unaffected ones and use the crystal on them. Unfortunately, you'll have to kill the others. You'll find the owlkin at [[Nestlewood Thicket]] and [[Nestlewood Hills]] to the southeast.

== Rewards ==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Elixir of Minor Defense]] (3)
*[[Elixir of Lion's Strength]] (3)

You will also receive:
*{{cost||1|50}}
*[[Minor Healing Potion]] (3)
*450 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

== Progress ==
The more we can do to clear up Nestlewood, the faster Zhanaa can get back to work.

== Completion ==
With many of the owlkin now inoculated we can focus on getting out here and not have to worry about wiping out the owlkin population in the area.

Here, choose from these. You've done good work, and you deserve to be rewarded!
