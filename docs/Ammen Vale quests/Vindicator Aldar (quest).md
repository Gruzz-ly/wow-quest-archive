'''Vindicator Aldar''' is an [[Alliance]]-only quest in the [[draenei]] starting region [[Ammen Vale]]. This quest is not required for [[Inoculation]], but gives a few extra XP so it is recommended that you get this quest before that one. It appears that you must complete the [[Healing the Lake]] quest chain from [[Botanist Taerix]] before she will offer this quest.

== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Vindicator Aldar]] at the [[Crash Site]] in [[Ammen Vale]].

== Description ==
With your help, we were able to find a solution to our problems faster than I could have hoped.

I don't have any other work for you to do. My apprentices and I can handle the rest.

You should go speak with Vindicator Aldar on the other side of the ship.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*180 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

== Completion ==
<Name>, is it? I've heard good things about you and the work you've been doing in the short time since you came to.

We'll definitely need your help getting things back to normal. [[Technician Zhanaa|Zhanaa]], over there, could also use your help, I'm sure.

==Progression==
{{:Draenei starting experience}}
