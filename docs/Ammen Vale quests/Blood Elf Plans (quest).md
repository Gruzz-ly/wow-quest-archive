'''Blood Elf Plans''' is an [[Alliance]]-only quest in the [[draenei]] starting area [[Ammen Vale]]. When plans detailing the blood elves' mission in [[Ammen Vale]] are discovered, the player must quickly inform [[Vindicator Aldar]].

==== How to Get This Quest ====
This quest starts from the item [[Blood Elf Plans]], which is dropped by [[Surveyor Candress]] at the top of [[Shadow Ridge]] in [[Ammen Vale]]. She is also the target of the quest [[Blood Elf Spy]], so players will most likely get this quest while completing that one.

== Objectives ==
Take the Blood Elf Plans to [[Vindicator Aldar]] at the [[Crash Site]] in [[Ammen Vale]].
* [[Blood Elf Plans]] (provided)

== Description ==
These plans seem important. You should take them to Vindicator Aldar at the crash site.

== Reward ==
You will receive: {{cost||1}}

== Progress ==
What have you got there?

== Completion ==
Here, let me read those plans.

[[Sunfury|The blood elves]] have followed us here?  They are evil to the core and should be wiped from existence!

<The [[vindicator]] takes a moment to regain his composure.>

I apologize, that was uncalled for.  We are indebted to you for uncovering this information, <name>.
