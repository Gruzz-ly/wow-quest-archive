==Objectives==
Deliver the Bundle of Vials to [[Zalduun]] at the Crash Site in [[Ammen Vale]].
*[[Bundle of Vials]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that you've gathered all that we need to replenish our healing crystals, I need you to deliver the vials to Zalduun, our [[priest]].  You'll find him tending to our wounded inside the central chamber of the ship.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*45 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with {{F|Exodar}}

==Progress==
Hello, <class>.  What have you there?  Is it for me?

==Completion==
Good work!  This will do nicely to replenish our depleted healing crystals.

But now that you're here, I think I have another use for you, if you're willing?

==Notes==
Zalduun is the priest NPC tending to the injured draenei inside the crashed ship.

==Progression==
{{:Draenei starting experience}}
