'''Replenishing the Healing Crystals''' is a simple loot-gathering quest.  You must kill [[Vale Moth]]s to collect [[Vial of Moth Blood]].

There is a minor difference in the quest text, depending if your character is a draenei or a member of other race. Also, the reputation you earn in this quest is different between the two versions.

This is the first quest in the chain, instead of [[You Survived!]], if you aren't a draenei.

==Objectives==
Acquire 6 Vials of Moth Blood from the nearby [[Vale Moth]]s and <give/bring> them to [[Proenitus]] at the [[Crash Site]] in [[Ammen Vale]].
*[[Vial of Moth Blood]] (6)

==Description==
;Draenei

: Our immediate concern is the depleted state of our healing crystals. We must replenish them quickly!

: Unfortunately, the only way to do this at this point is to extract the blood from the local [[Vale Moth|vale moths]]. Their blood will make for a suitable substitute.

: The moths can be found in many places around the vale, but they are mostly concentrated in the northwest.

; Non-draenei

: We are the [[draenei]]. [[The Exodar|Our ship]] crashed and, since we have many wounded, our immediate concern is the depleted state of our healing crystals. We must replenish them quickly!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Salvaged Leather Belt
|Slightly Rusted Bracers
|Worn Slippers
|Partially Tarnished Chain
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|||55}}
*250 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
;Draenei

: <Name>, have you harvested the necessary moth blood for the healing crystals yet?  With survivors scattered all over the vale, time is of the essence!

; Non-draenei

: Have you harvested the necessary moth blood for the healing crystals yet?  With survivors scattered all over the vale, time is of the essence!

==Completion==
Regrettable that those creatures had to die so that we might live - indiscriminate killing is not the draenei way.  However, the blood you gathered will replenish our healing crystals, so their deaths will not be in vain.

==Notes==
The Vale Moths are found all over the Crash Site in [[Ammen Vale]], you should have no trouble finding them, and they are easy to kill.

==Progression==
{{:Draenei starting experience}}
