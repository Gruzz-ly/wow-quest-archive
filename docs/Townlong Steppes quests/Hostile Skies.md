==Objectives==
[[File:Hostile Skies - shooting.jpg|thumb|Shooting swarmers out of the sky]]
Shoot down 50 Kor'thik Swarmers and Voress'thilak.
*[[Kor'thik Swarmer]]s shot down (50)
*[[Voress'thalik]] shot down

==Description==
We're about to get hit hard...

Pick up [[Nurong's Cannon|that cannon]] there and lend a hand, if you would.  There will be no shortage of targets.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Nurong's Gun]] and {{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
I could really use you on that cannon...

==Completion==
Excellent shooting!

I'm pretty sure that [[Voress'thalik|big bug]] survived the fall though...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Hawkmaster Nurong|A large wave of fliers approaches! Take my cannon, <class>, quickly!}}
Interact with [[Nurong's Cannon]], next to him. It has one ability:
*{{abilities|Nurong's Cannon Shot|One shot. one kill.|notes=Instant. Not on the GCD.|cd=0.2s}}

Plenty of [[Kor'thik Swarmer]]s in the air. The projectile's travel time is nearly instant, so don't bother leading the target. Once fifty have been killed, [[Voress'thalik]] spawns.
:{{text|say|Hawkmaster Nurong|What... what is that thing? Is it really trying to fly across?}}

It has 8 million health, so it will take several shots to knock it out of the sky.
:{{text|say|Hawkmaster Nurong|Nice work! Let's get down there and finish it off.}}

==Progression==
{{Rensai's Watchpost}}

==Patch changes==
