==Objectives==
Speak with [[Orbiss]] in the [[Lower Sumprushes|Sumprushes]].

==Description==
The calling to be a [[Shado-pan]] is one to bring balance and harmony to this land. It is our duty to ensure balance is maintained, <name>.

The [[yaungol]] activity in [[Townlong Steppes|Townlong]] is threatening this balance and must be stopped before it is too late.

We've had sightings of yaungol in the Sumprushes. The reports indicate they are attacking the [[mist lurker]]s in the area. Find out why and put an end to it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|10|}} (or {{cost|1|65|}} at max level)
*19,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Orbiss groans at you in agony.>

So, the shado-pan have sent you to see what the yaungol are doing? Well, do you see?
