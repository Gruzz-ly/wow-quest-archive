==Objectives==
Kill 8 Ashfang Hyenas.
*[[Ashfang Hyena]] slain (8)

==Description==
The rotting corpses are attracting [[hyena]] scavengers.

In addition to spreading diseases from feeding on the dead, the feral creatures will attack us on sight.

Go and eradicate the beasts. It is unfortunate, but ultimately for the best.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
It is better to be safe than sorry.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. It was an unpleasant task, but it had to be done.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Dust to Dust (quest)]], [[Totemic Research]], and [[Last Toll of the Yaungol]] before heading out.

Get started burning [[Palewind Villager]]s, killing hyenas, finding totems, and scouting the four smoke trails. The totem is a ground-targeted AoE and is large enough to get a few yaungol at a time.

The southern smoke trail is by the oil derricks, with the [[Palewind Chief]]:
:{{text|say|Xiao Tu|It's the yaungol chief, slain like the rest. Seems that he could not keep order in the final fight.}}
Eastern trail is by the wall in the corner:
:{{text|say|Xiao Tu|They fought over their food supplies. It looks like rather than sharing their food, someone destroyed it all. Why would they do that?}}
The "northwestern" trail is just northwest of the eastern trail:
:{{text|say|Xiao Tu|Look, I see some of Suna's things! She must have made camp here. But where is she?}}
Western some trail is northwest of the questgivers by another three oil derricks:
:{{text|say|Xiao Tu|From what I can tell, there were no sides in this fight. Why would the yaungol kill each other in a free-for-all?}}

==Progression==
