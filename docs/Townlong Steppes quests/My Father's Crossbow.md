*[[Father's Crossbow]] {{co|38.7|65.3|Townlong Steppes}}

==Description==
I came here to visit my dad at [[Niuzao Temple|the temple]]. As soon as I got here, I saw the most terrifying thing I've ever seen.

It was a [[mantid]], walking right past me, carrying my father's crossbow.

Something's happened to my dad! We've got to find out what it is... but first, we'll need his crossbow back. I saw him heading west, behind the temple.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did... did you find it?

==Completion==
Yeah, this is dad's.

Let's head on over to the temple. They'll know what...

<Ku-Mo's voice catches.>

...what happened to him.

==Notes==
Circle around the southwest of the [[Niuzao Temple]]. There, [[Et'kil]] and two [[Sra'thik Drone]]s are hiding in a corner. The combined health total is somewhere around 1.6 million health, so be prepared!
