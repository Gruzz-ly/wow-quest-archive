*Amber Vault bombed {{co|21.0|45.9|Townlong Steppes}}
*Nutriment Cell bombed {{co|23.8|47.3|Townlong Steppes}}
*Egg Chamber bombed {{co|23.6|44.7|Townlong Steppes}}
*Torture Cell bombed {{co|22.0|41.5|Townlong Steppes}}
*Slaughtering Pit bombed {{co|21.2|43.2|Townlong Steppes}}
*[[Bag of Shado-Pan Gas Bombs]] (provided)

==Description==
Our alchemists have cooked up a set of gas bombs that will discourage [[mantid]] from staying anywhere that we set them off.

If we plant these in the critical structures of Sra'vess, they'll need to evacuate. That should sow some chaos and delay any action from the mantid there for days.

Get to it, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Have you planted the gas bombs?

==Completion==
Nice, I can see the smoke from here. That should definitely cause some confusion.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ling of the Six Pools|Here, take these supplies. You'll need them for your missions.}}
Pick up the other dailies before heading out. Also, pick up the Bag of Wu Kao Supplies by her feet. Don't forget to speak to a friendly NPC for a battle companion before leaving the garrison.

Get to [[Sra'vess]]. On the island, adventurers are provided with an Assassin's Shroud, which puts the adventurer in stealth. The supply bag had 10x[[Shiny Shado-Pan Coin]] and 6x[[Wu-Kao Dart of Lethargy]] inside, which can be used while under the quest stealth.

The targeted buildings are all part of the Sra'vess [[kypari]] tree itself and not any outbuildings on the greater island.
