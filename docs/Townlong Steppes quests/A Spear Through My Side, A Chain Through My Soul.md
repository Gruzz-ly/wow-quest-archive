==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Dmong Naruuk.jpg|Dmong Naruuk|A powerful mist-shaman of the Osul tribe.}}
Slay Dmong Naruuk, the shaman who holds [[Orbiss]] hostage.
*[[Dmong Naruuk]] slain {{co|68.4|71.4|Townlong Steppes}}

==Description==
My fate is sealed. The [[yaungol]] put this spear in my side. The wound will kill me.

The yaungol hold me in place with their twisted, corrupted magic. The indignity of it hurts worse than my spear-wound.

My death, I cannot stop. My imprisonment... you may be able to help me with this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I will not die before having my revenge.

==Completion==
I am freed.

The yaungol must be stopped.

==Notes==
Head due east of the questgiver's position to find a path leading to the [[Upper Sumprushes]]. Circle around to the west to find [[Dmong Naruuk]], a level 89 yaungol with 1,144,000 health.

Aggro:
:{{text|yell|Dmong Naruuk|You are on the wrong side of this battle, <race>. You side with savage beasts!}}
At 25%:
:{{text|yell|Dmong Naruuk|No! I've lost focus on the torch!}}
:''Naruuk breaks off and runs to the torch.''
:{{text|yell|Dmong Naruuk|Must... regain... control...}}
:''It backfires, killing him instantly.''
Return to Orbiss.

==Progression==
{{Lower Sumprushes}}
