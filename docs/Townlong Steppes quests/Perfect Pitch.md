==Objectives==
Collect 8 Dark Pitch.
*[[Dark Pitch]] (8)

==Description==
When the Osul tribe goes to war, they coat their spears and arrows with a highly flammable, ever-burning pitch.

They use this terrible weapon to shed not only blood, but to raze the homes of their enemies.

I need you to collect some of this pitch while you are in their camp.

We will use it to show the yaungol that when you play with fire, you can get burned.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
The yaungol are not content merely to defeat their enemies. No, they would rather destroy and decimate them.

==Completion==
It still smells fresh.

Good job, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Foot in the Door]] and [[Running Rampant]] before heading out.

On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|<Name>, there is a situation to the south that requires my immediate attention.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|When you are finished with your duties, report to [[Ban Bearheart]]. I am leaving him in command for the duration of the mission here.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|I will see you soon.}}
:''He and Taoshi walk away.''
Cross over to the northwest to reach [[Fire Camp Osul]]. Start killing yaungol, scaring yaks and mushan, and looting Pitch Pots for Dark Pitch. Yaungol, when trampled, take an additional 50% damage.

Ban Bearheart can be found at the southwest end of Fire camp Osul on the high bluff near the oil derrick alongside Suna. They are having a conversation:
:{{text|say|Suna Silentstrike|We should attack them now, Ban, while their eyes are set upon the gates of Kun-Lai.}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|Lord Taran Zhu just departed with the majority of our soldiers. Attacking now would be foolish.}}
:{{text|say|Suna Silentstrike|Have you forgotten that they are holding my husband prisoner? Time is running out!}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|Patience, Suna. I share your desire to stop the yaungol. But I must consider every soldier, not just your husband.}}
:{{text|say|Suna Silentstrike|Tcha! Why did Taran leave you in charge? You would have us cower in our bedsheets until the yaungol break down our very doors!}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|Lower your voice. It's no wonder Taran did not pick you for command. You take too many risks.}}
:{{text|say|SUna Silentstrike|But Lin is down there!}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|We will save him, Suna. I promise.}}
