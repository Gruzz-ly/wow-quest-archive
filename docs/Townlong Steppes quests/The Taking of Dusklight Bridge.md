==Completion==
The mantid aren't likely to return soon after a beating like that... and now Lao-Chin is free to join us in the hunt.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|Lord Zhu, we'll return shortly.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|With pleasure. Return to me when you two are finished.}}
:{{text|say|Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|Come, <name>, let's push these insects back!}}

Follow Lao-Chin over the [[Dusklight Bridge]].

Several handfuls of Bloodletters will spawn. Let Lao-Chin tank them! When they are all dead, the Fleshrender will spawn. Kill it, then head back.

On return, [[Taoshi]] has caught up as all of the NPCs are out of combat close to the bridge:
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|I take it you were successful at the bridge?}}
:{{text|say|Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|We were. My new friend here performed stunningly!}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|You are to join us in our hunt of the [[Sha of Hatred]] then, Lao-Chin. The men here should be able to hold the bridge and repair the camp on their own.}}
:{{text|say|Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|Of course. My staff is yours, Lord Zhu.}}
