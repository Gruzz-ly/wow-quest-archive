==Objectives==
[[File:Joining the Hunt.jpg|thumb|Joining the Hunt]]
Ride with [[Taran Zhu]], [[Taoshi]], and [[Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|Lao-Chin]] to [[Rensai's Watchpost]].

==Description==
We are one stronger. Your help is invaluable.

Let's move on westward to Rensai's Watchpost to find the last member for our party.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|75}}
*49000 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Completion==
We are close. I can feel the unnatural hatred surging.

It's a testament to the training of the Shado-Pan that the forces here have not been consumed by its influence.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''The three mount up and start riding west.''
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|The crossroads is not far. Let us seek our last member there.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Is it to be [[Hawkmaster Nurong]] then?}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Yes. We'll need his expertise with a crossbow when the final battle comes.}}
:{{text|say|Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|My men speak highly of this Nurong. It will be good to finally meet him.}}
:''They reach [[Rensai's Watchpost]].''
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Good to see you well, [[Rensai Oakhide|Rensai]]. We're here for Hawkmaster Nurong. Where can we find him?}}
:{{text|say|Rensai Oakhide|Well met, Lord Zhu. he's with the rest of my men, holding the line at [[Farwatch Overlook]].}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Farwatch Overlook? I've heard no reports of mantid in the chasm below.}}
:{{text|say|Rensai Oakhide|No, not the chasm. Fliers. In numbers like we've never seen.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Taoshi, the [[Sha of Hatred]] is close. Find it and report back to me.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|At once, Lord Zhu.}}
:''She turns and takes off.''
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|<Name>, help at Farwatch Overlook and then bring Nurong back to us here. Our final confrontation approaches swiftly.}}
Turn in to Taran Zhu. Both he and Rensai offer quests.
