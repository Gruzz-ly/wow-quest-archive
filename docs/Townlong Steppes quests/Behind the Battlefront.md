==Objectives==
Meet with [[Taoshi]] at [[Dampsoil Burrow]].

==Description==
This blockade has been undermanned and unsupplied for too long during my absence in [[Kun-Lai Summit|Kun-Lai]]. We need to get things back in order here before we can pick up the trail of the [[Sha of Hatred]].

Taoshi is my best. I've sent her north to investigate rumors of [[mantid]] that have somehow made it through the blockade. I need someone I can trust to get out there and work with her to plug any holes in our defenses.

If my reports on you are correct, I can trust you with this, right <class>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|75}}
*49000 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Completion==
You look capable. Taran knows to send me the best. I like that.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Treatment for the Troops]] before heading out. Circle around to the north to find Taoshi on the southern lip of the crevasse. Quickly turn in Behind the Battlefront and pick up [[Unwelcome Intruders]].

==Progression==
{{Gao-Ran Battlefront}}
