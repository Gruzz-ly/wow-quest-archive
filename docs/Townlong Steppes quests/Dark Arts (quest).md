==Objectives==
Collect 8 Shan'ze Tablets.
*[[Shan'ze Tablet]] (8)

==Description==
It is said that [[Shan'ze Dao]] was once home to a great mogu temple.

There, the Shan'ze studied and practiced the art of subjugating the dead or inanimate.

Much of their knowledge still remains on the island to the northwest, buried among the ruins.

We need to get our hands on their knowledge - both to keep it out of their hands, and to understand the nature of their experiments.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Knowledge is powerful. That is why the mogu are so dangerous.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>.

We'll begin deciphering the writing on these tablets at once.

==Notes==
Make sure to choose a companion before heading out. Tablets are found on the ground all over the isle, and extremely rarely on the corpses of the mogu.

==Progression==
{{Shado-Pan Garrison dailies}}

==Patch changes==
