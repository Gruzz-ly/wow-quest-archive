==Objectives==
Defeat 12 [[Sra'thik swarm|Sra'thik]] attackers at [[Niuzao Temple]].
*Sra'thik attacker slain (12)

==Description==
The [[mantid]] continue to attack us. Their numbers ebb and flow, but they do not stop.

It is no matter. The yak is stamina embodied. We will not bend to them. We will defend his home forever.

Will you help us?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*294000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
The weight of the west sits squarely on Niuzao's shoulders. A few fluttering mantid are nothing to him.

==Completion==
You fight like you are one of us.

==Notes==
Start killing mantid and looting their weapons off the ground.
