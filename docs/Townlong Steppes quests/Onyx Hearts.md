==Objectives==
Collect 4 Onyx Hearts.
*[[Onyx Heart]] (4)

==Description==
The [[Shan'ze Serpentbinder]]s dominate the minds of wild [[cloud serpent]]s, but they also create their own dark creatures from stone, metal, blood, and ancient sorcery.

Their creations, the [[Onyx Stormclaw]]s, guard the island to the northwest.

I wish to study the magic binding these creatures. Bring me their hearts, so that I can better understand what sorcery we are up against.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
The Onyx Stormclaws will never disobey their masters.

==Completion==
These will do well, <name>. Thank you.

==Notes==
Make sure to choose a companion before heading out. Stormclaws are mostly found on the central to northwest part of the island.

==Progression==
