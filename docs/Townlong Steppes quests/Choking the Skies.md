==Objectives==
Burn 10 Kor'thik Fleetwing corpses.
*Burn [[Kor'thik Fleetwing]] corpses x10
*[[Wu Kao Torch]] (provided)

==Description ==
[[Hawkmaster Nurong|Nurong]] wants me to pass out torches for burning the bodies.

The flying [[mantid]] are fragile, and won't last long in the hot smoke.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Cremating Torch]] and {{cost|11}}
*196000 XP
*+75 reputation with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Some of them can make it through the smoke, but in small enough numbers that we can easily pick them off.

==Completion==
Your help is appreciated, stranger.

==Notes==
Down at [[Farwatch Overlook]] for [[In Skilled Hands]] and [[Grounded Welcome]], [[Marksman Ye]] offers this quest. Pick it up before getting started killing mantid. Also, look for [[Hawkmaster Nurong]] up on a hill overlooking both the overlook and the ravine far below.

On approach:
:{{Text|say|Hawkmaster Nurong|<Class>, up here! I could use a hand!}}
Turn in In Skilled Hands and pick up [[Hostile Skies]]. Do Hostile Skies and pick up [[Devastation Below]], then get started killing fleetwings and burning their corpses.

The path down to [[Voress'thalik]] is toward the north end of the overlook. Nurong is kiting Voress'thalik around the bottom of the [[Widening Deep]]. It has less than 800,000 health left.
