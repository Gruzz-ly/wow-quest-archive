==Description==
I can't find a single good yak [[Fields of Niuzao|here]]. ALL the yaks are bad!

Some are too stinky, some too fight-y, others just scared.

You look like a lucky <race>. Here, take a lasso. See if you can find a good yak for me.

You will receive:
*{{cost|11}} and [[Ruthers' Harness]]
* 196000 XP

==Progress==
See? I told you! No good yaks.

==Completion==
Well, well! A good yak!

Tell you what, <name>. I take this GOOD yak, and you can do whatever you want with this bad, bad one.

==Notes==
Headed to the [[Niuzao Catacombs]] for The Terrible Truth, Give Them Peace, and A Trail of Fear, players may run across [[Bluesaddle]], south of the lake. He offers this quest after completing [[Bad Yak]].
