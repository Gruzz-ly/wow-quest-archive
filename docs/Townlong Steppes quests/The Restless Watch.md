==Description==
I'm being told that our scouts have been on duty in [[Shallowstep Pass]] for more than 2 days straight, no rest. No wonder [[mantid]] are slipping through. Even the most dedicated scouts would slip with those kinds of shifts.

I want you to go out there and deliver orders to the scouts that they are to return to the blockade immediately for rest and rations. I'll arrange for a new shift to be posted.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|
|Ring of Shallowstep Pass
|Ring of the Watchful Eye
|Band of the Faithful Scout
|Taoshi's Signet
|Seal of the Restless Watch
}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
The whole blockade is being worked to the bone. We need more men out here.

==Completion==
Thank you. I'll have the new scouts at their posts shortly.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Breach in the Defenses (Townlong Steppes)]] and [[Trap Setting]] before heading out.

Toss flares to see the stealthed [[Krik'thik Scentlayer]]s, who will not aggro unless they take damage. Keep an eye out for spike traps on the ground and reactivate them. Feel free to kite scentlayers onto activated traps for a nice surprise!

Scout Wei-Chin can be found right next to the wall in the northeast part of the pass, just north of east of the questgivers:
:I could use a campfire and some warm food right about now. Are you here with good news?
:{{gossip|I have orders for you to return to the blockade.}}
:{{text|say|Scout-Wei-Chin|Even better news than I was hoping. I look forward to a warm bed.}}
Maybe a hundred yards to the southwest in the blue grass on a small rise is [[Scout Long]]:
:We've been at this post for days with no sleep. You've no idea how badly I want to just lie down.
:{{gossip|I have orders for you to return to the blockade.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Long|Let my replacement know that a lot of mantid have been trying to sneak through the main channel. This is no easy post.}}
Head southeast to the wall corner to find Scout Ying near a small monument.
:A happy face is welcome around here. Happen to bring some rations?
:{{gossip|I have orders for you to return to the blockade.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Ying|Even better than rations. Res. I thought I'd be out here a while yet.}}
Finally, head west to find Scout Jai-gan, overlooking the sha-corrupted path into the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]]:
:I've never seen them in such numbers...
:{{gossip|I have orders for you to return to the blockade.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Jai-gan|That swarm is what we have to look forward to. Ancestors help us if they decide to turn on the blockade.}}
Head back to the entrance of the [[Gao-Ran Battlefront]] to turn in.
