*Find [[Niuzao Catacombs]] {{co|32.6|61.5|Townlong Steppes}}
*Investigate the [[Ghastly Confines|Niuzao Catacombs]] {{co|62.8|41.5|Niuzao Catacombs}} / {{co|37.1|59.2|Townlong Steppes}}
*[[Dread Shadow]] slain {{co|50.3|24.8|Niuzao Catacombs}} / {{co|36.0|57.8|Townlong Steppes}}

==Description==
It is with a heavy heart that I confirm your suspicions. The [[mantid]] are indeed under the sway of the [[Sha of Fear]].

It was OUR sworn duty to confine that creature beneath our temple. Unfortunately, our vigil faltered, our defenses buckled, and the sha escaped. It is with the mantid now.

See for yourself. The mantid burrowed into the western side of our island.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 429 trinkets
|Mark of the Catacombs
|Sigil of the Catacombs
|Emblem of the Catacombs
|Medallion of the Catacombs
|Symbol of the Catacombs}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Completion==
Let me make this clear... that creature was NOT the Sha of Fear. Simply a shadow... a fraction of the sha's true power.

No, the Sha of Fear is with the mantid now. The elders of [[Shado-Pan|my order]] need to be informed of this immediately.

I will handle the rest from here. Thank your for your assistance, <race>. Once again, your kind proves to be an asset to [[Pandaria]].

==Notes==
On complete:
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|As I suspected. Thank you, Ogos. <Name> - I will meet you in the catacombs.}}
Pick up [[Give Them Peace]] and [[A Trail of Fear]] before heading out.

Exit the temple to the north and turn left, heading southwest. Along the edge of the cliff are a few banners and a trail that circles back to the southeast under the cliff to enter the [[Niuzao Catacombs]].

[[Fear-Stricken Sentinel]]s litter the ground. Interact with them to flip them on their stomachs. [[Dreadling]]s are also all over the catacombs. Near the back of the catacombs is the [[Ghastly Confines]]. Find it to complete the "Investigate" step of The Terrible Truth. Inside the ghastly confines is the [[Dread Shadow]]. See its article for tactics. [[Tai Ho]] is in the room with the dread shadow, so turn in The Terrible Truth to him. Kill a path back out of the crypts and turn in up top at the temple.

This completes the "Tai Ho's Investigation" portion of [[One Steppe Forward, Two Steppes Back]].
