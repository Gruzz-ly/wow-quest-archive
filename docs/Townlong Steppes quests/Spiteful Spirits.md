==Objectives==
Kill 15 Spiteful Spirits.
*[[Spiteful Spirit]] slain (15)

==Description==
The spirits of the fallen villagers have risen! I can feel the hatred emanating from the spirits.

<Name>, if we are to survive here, we must defend ourselves. This is the only way we can put them to rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
The air is thick with their malicious intent.

==Completion==
Well done. We cannot bring them retribution, but at least we can end their rage.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Hatred Becomes Us]] before heading out.

Look for [[Crazed Shado-Pan Ranger]]s and drop a Totem of Harmony on them to pop out a [[Seething Hatred]]. Kill the hatred, with the guard's help. Additionally, [[Spiteful Spirit]]s will spawn aggroed upon the player from potentially halfway across the map. Stay relatively close to guards if possible. Be aware of the progress bar keeping track of Hatred. If it reaches 100, a Seething Hatred will pop out!

Be warned that the totem has a several-second cast and will be interrupted by taking damage, so plan ahead!

==Progression==
