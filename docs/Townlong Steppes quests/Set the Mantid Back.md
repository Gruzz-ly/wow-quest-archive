*Kri'thik Supplies Exploded {{co|56.6|53.9|Townlong Steppes}}
*[[Gunpowder Casks]] (provided)

==Description==
Every day, the [[mantid]] build up munitions for use on their enemies. We cannot stop them, just you and I... but we can set them back.

<[[Tai Ho]] hands you some explosives.>

I need to keep a low profile. Would you do the honors?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
* 196000 XP
* +75 reputation with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
The Shado-Pan are counting on you, <name>.

==Completion==
We are in your debt, <race>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Motives of the Mantid]] before heading out. [[Provisioner Bamfu]] also has some collection quests that can be done alongside of these: [[Natural Antiseptic]], [[The Field Armorer]], and [[A Proper Poultice]].

Head northeast out of the garrison through the [[Underbough]]. Start killing mushan and turtles, and looting mao-willows. Circle around to the north side of Kri'vess to find the entrance to the mantid area. Tai Ho will join the party as players get close:
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|You take them out. I'll hide in the shadows and search their bodies.}}
The weapons and supplies caches are OUTSIDE of the tree to the north. Use the item and target the ground where the weapons and supplies caches are to destroy them. The mantid will take exception to this, so take them out. Tai Ho may not find any clues on the corpses of the mantid:
*{{text|say|Tai Ho|Nothing on this one}}
*{{text|say|Tai Ho|No... nothing of note here. Keep looking.}}
*{{text|say|Tai Ho|There's nothing here. Let's keep looking.}}
Or he could find a random poor-quality item:
*{{text|say|Tai Ho|Here's something you might find interesting.}}
*{{text|say|Tai Ho|No clues here... but I did find this.}}

First clue:
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|The color has just... left its body.}}
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|There's no doubt about it. These creatures have been affected by sha.}}
Second clue:
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|Look at the size of these! This one is definitely a breeding male.}}
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|That means the mantid queen is involved in this... somehow.}}
Third clue:
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|His body - it's covered in scars. Old scars.}}
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|Not just any scars, either. These were created by pandaren weapons.}}
Fourth clue:
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|Here it is! This is what we've been looking for!}}
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|Yak hair.}}
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|Come back to camp when you are finished. We have much to discuss.}}
Finish up with the three gathering quests before heading back.
