==Description==
[[Ban Bearheart|Ban]] has asked me to explore the village to determine what happened here.

I noticed smoke rising up from the east, the west, northwest, and the south.

I need someone I trust to watch my back.

What do you say? Want to help me on my first scouting mission?

==Progress==
Something terrible must have happened here.

==Completion==
Thank you for your help, <name>.

We cannot know exactly what happened here, but it's clear that something caused the yaungol to turn on one another.

What kind of power could do this?

==Notes==
Pick up [[Dust to Dust (quest)]], [[Slaying the Scavengers]], and [[Totemic Research]] before heading out.

Get started burning [[Palewind Villager]]s, killing hyenas, finding totems, and scouting the four smoke trails. The totem is a ground-targeted AoE and is large enough to get a few yaungol at a time.

The southern smoke trail is by the oil derricks, with the [[Palewind Chief]]:
:{{text|say|Xiao Tu|It's the yaungol chief, slain like the rest. Seems that he could not keep order in the final fight.}}
Eastern trail is by the wall in the corner:
:{{text|say|Xiao Tu|They fought over their food supplies. It looks like rather than sharing their food, someone destroyed it all. Why would they do that?}}
The "northwestern" trail is just northwest of the eastern trail:
:{{text|say|Xiao Tu|Look, I see some of Suna's things! She must have made camp here. But where is she?}}
Western smoke trail is northwest of the questgivers by another three oil derricks:
:{{text|say|Xiao Tu|From what I can tell, there were no sides in this fight. Why would the yaungol kill each other in a free-for-all?}}

If you lose Xiao Tu, you can find him back by the bonfire near the quest givers.
