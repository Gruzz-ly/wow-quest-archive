== Objectives ==

[[File:Sra'thik Warcaller.jpg|thumb|{{NPC||Sra'thik Warcaller}}]]
Defeat 25 Sra'thik attackers at Niuzao Temple.
*Sra'thik attacker slain x25

== Description ==
Today's [[mantid]] swarm is among the worst I've seen. We are lucky to have {{NPC||Niuzao}} join us in battle.

Help him, <class>. Return to the courtyard, and join in the defense of our temple.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|72|lcgf=2}}
* 294000 XP
* +350 reputation with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

== Progress ==
Hopefully your battle will be made easier with Niuzao at your back.

== Completion ==
Look at him, <class>.

Nothing can stop Niuzao. Only Niuzao can stop Niuzao.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Big Guns]], [[The Overwhelming Swarm]], and [[In Battle's Shadow]] before getting started.

Head down the stairs. Niuzao is running circuits around his besieged courtyard. Kite {{NPC||Sra'thik Warcaller||Sra'thik warcallers}}, {{NPC||Sra'thik Swiftclaw||swiftclaws}}, and {{NPC||Sra'thik Kunchong||kunchong}} into his path and he will stomp them flat. The Pot of Fire to blow up the {{NPC||Sra'thik War Wagon}}s act as a ground-targeted AoE and have a huge range, so try to blow the wagon up from as far away as possible (at least 50 yards away), then start running. 8-9 {{NPC||Sra'thik Fleshrender}}s will pop out, aggroed on whoever threw the bomb. They each have ~50,000 health remaining.

Loose bricks can be found near broken masonry all over the temple.
