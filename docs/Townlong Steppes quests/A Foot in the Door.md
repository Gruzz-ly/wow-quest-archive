Kill 8 Osul Chargers.

==Description==
<[[Taran Zhu|Lord Taran]] immediately pins you down with his steely gaze.>

<class>, you bear the marks of many a past battle.

Good! We need more seasoned people like you to hold back the front.

We've managed to secure a foothold [[Longying Outpost|here]], but the [[yaungol]] are desperate to remove our presence.

If you wish to prove your worth, go down the hill and show the yaungol that we will not back down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
We are slowly gaining ground.

==Completion==
Good. I can see that you are capable.

I hope to rely on your talents for what is to come.

==Notes==
Head north and start killing. Take out eight and head back to Taran.
