You will receive:
*{{cost|2|75}}

Let's get this taken care of so we can get down to the bridge.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|We've done all we can here. Farewell, [[Gao-Ran the Tempered|Gao-Ran]]. I will send more men as soon as I am able.}}
:{{text|say|Gao-Ran the Tempered|Appreciated, Lord Zhu. Good luck in your hunt.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Come. Let us go.}}
:''[[Taran Zhu]] and [[Taoshi]] mount up and take off.''
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|It is time for us to continue westward, <name>, after the [[Sha of Hatred]].}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|We will need more veteran [[Shado-Pan]] among us before we can confront it. We'll stop at the encampments along the way.}}
:''They travel for a while, stopping as they near [[Dusklight Hollow]].''
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Do you feel that...?}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Yes. The Sha of Hatred has been through here.}}
:''They start walking again, stopping at [[Initiate Pao-Me]]'s position.''
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|You, initiate. Where are the troops?}}
:{{text|say|Initiate Pao-Me|Lord Zhu! They are down at the bridge, holding off a mantid attack force, sir.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|<Name>, Taoshi, help these men get their camp in order. I'll assess the state of the bridge.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Of course, Lord Zhu.}}

Turn in to Taoshi. She and Pao-Me both offer quests.
