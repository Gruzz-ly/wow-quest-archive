==Objectives==
Use the Shado-Pan Flare to aid in killing 10 Mantid Scentlayers.
*[[Krik'thik Scentlayer]] slain (10)
*[[Shado-Pan Flare]] (provided)

==Description==
Normally, it only takes a few scouts to hold this pass. Most of this territory is in sight of the wall, so archers would devastate any mantid force attempting to push through here. The problem is, most of the archers are occupied with the onslaught at [[Gate of the Setting Sun|the gate]].

Take this flare - it will help you locate the mantid that are sneaking through the eastern pass under our diminished watch. Kill any you find. We can't let them lay a trail that might lead the mantid swarms farther into the steppes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
The defenders on the wall are stretched thin. The Yaungol are pushing through the gates into Kun-Lai to the north. The mantid are pouring against the gates to the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]]. I hear that there's been a breach into the [[Valley of the Four Winds]] to the south too.

We do not have the men to combat all of these threats.

==Completion==
There are more getting through than I had thought. I may need to stay here and clean up a while.

You've done more than your part though, <class>. Thank you.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Restless Watch]] and [[Trap Setting]] before heading out.

Toss flares to see the stealthed [[Krik'thik Scentlayer]]s, who will not aggro unless they take damage. Keep an eye out for spike traps on the ground and reactivate them. Feel free to kite scentlayers onto activated traps for a nice surprise!

Scout Wei-Chin can be found right next to the wall in the northeast part of the pass, just north of east of the questgivers. Maybe a hundred yards to the southwest in the blue grass on a small rise is [[Scout Long]]. Head southeast to the wall corner to find [[Scout Ying]] near a small monument. Finally, head west to find Scout Jai-gan, overlooking the sha-corrupted path into the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].

Head back to the entrance of the [[Gao-Ran Battlefront]] to turn in.
