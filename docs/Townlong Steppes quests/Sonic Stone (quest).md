==Objectives==
Show the stone to [[Sentinel Commander Qipan]] in [[Townlong Steppes]].
*[[Sonic Stone]]

==Description==
<The stone vibrates to your touch. The frequency resonates throughout your body, and you feel refreshed.

The [[mantid]] likely use these stones to allow them to fly great distances across the sea.

To see them on the island was strange, the mantid took a heavy blow when [[Grand Empress Shek'zeer|Shek'zeer]] was destroyed, they should not be swarming now.

The denizens of [[Pandaria]] may have more information.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (700x [[Azerite (resource)]])
*{{cost|11|70|}}
*8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Yes? We are quite busy here, as you can see, what is it?

Ah, I see you have also encountered the mantid swarm.

Our fears are realized, the new empress has hatched. Princess Zara, no, now [[Grand Empress Shek'zara]], is here.

She is as hotheaded and impulsive as mantid queens usually are, and has mobilized most of her forces to search for Azerite.

We know not why.

<Qipan squishes a nearby bug between his fingers.>

But we do not like it.

Here, Azerite taken from their corpses, take it.
