== Objectives ==
Kill 3 Shan'ze Illusionists.
* [[Shan'ze Illusionist]] slain (3)

== Description ==
<class>, I need your strength to eliminate the [[Shan'ze Illusionist]]s on [[Shan'ze Dao]], to the northwest.

It wearies me to ask of you this difficult task.

The illusionists are among the strongest of the Shan'ze's elite sorcerors.

They will not be easy to defeat, but I know no <class> who is better suited to the task.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}

== Progress ==
Do not be fooled by their illusions.

== Completion ==
I knew you could do this, <name>!

With fewer Shan'ze Illusionists to stand against us, our task here will be much easier.
