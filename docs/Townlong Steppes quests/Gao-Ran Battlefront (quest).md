==Objectives==
Speak to [[Taran Zhu|Lord Taran Zhu]] at the [[Gao-Ran Battlefront]] in the [[Townlong Steppes]].

==Description==
With your help, we have quelled the spirits of [[Hatred's Vice|this place]].

At last, they may rest in peace.

Our journey into this cursed land, I am afraid, has only begun.

I have some important matters to finish up here, but we will be moving out soon.

I need someone to go ahead and tell Lord Taran Zhu that we are joining him.

Find him at the Gao-Ran Battlefront. Tell him what has transpired here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|50}}
*98000 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Completion==
Did the northern expedition go well, then?

What news do you have to report?

==Notes==
Head southwest out of Hatred's Vice and follow the path through the [[Shallowstep Pass]]. Look for some pandaren guards to find the entrance of the [[Gao-Ran Battlefront]]. There, Taran Zhu is having a conversation with [[Gao-Ran the Tempered]]:
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Where are the northern sentries? I didn't spot a single one of your men before reaching the camp. You grow lax, Gao-Ran.}}
:{{text|say|Gao-Ran the Tempered|With all due respect, Lord, we have not grown lax. We are stretched thin. We are beset on all fronts, my men are worked to the bone, and I have not a single warrior to spare.}}
:{{text|say|Gao-Ran the Tempered|Lord Zhu, the [[mantid]] here have not been seen in these numbers since the swarm more than 90 years ago. My men are going days without sleep just to hold this line.}}
:{{text|say|Gao-Ran the Tempered|Perhaps we should pull back to the wall? If the full force of the mantid come, we can confidently hold them there.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|No, we will not be pulling back. It's 10 years yet before the mantid birth their next swarm. I will not see the Townlong Steppes given to them freely.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|I had come to seek strong pandaren to hunt the Sha of Hatred, but we will step in here and help you fortify the barricade first.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|[[Taoshi]], go north and make sure there are no mantid on our flank. I will see to the defenses.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|At once, Lord Zhu.}}
:{{text|say|Gao-Ran the Tempered|The men will be glad to have you with us, Lord Zhu.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|I've gone too long without visiting the front, Gao-Ran. Your long efforts are appreciated.}}
