==Objectives==
[[File:Needlebottom.jpg|thumb|[[Needlebottom]].]]
Recover {{NPC||Initiate Chao||Initiate Chao's}} Sword.
*[[Initiate Chao's Sword]] {{co|63.1|87.7|Townlong Steppes}}

==Description==
Look... um... this is really embarrassing. I set down my sword for like ONE SECOND to gather some orbs, and a big [[sprite]] sprung out of nowhere, snatched it, and bounded off down the western gap.

I can't go back to camp without it. Losing your weapon is a sure way to get kicked out of the [[Shado-Pan]]. It's sacred.

Please, can you try to find this big sprite and get my sword back? It would mean a lot to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Chao Cookies]]
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
My mom warned me this was going to happen...

==Completion==
You... you are a lifesaver! Seriously.

Thank you so much!

==Notes==
On the way down to the [[Ambermarsh]] for [[Improvised Ammunition]], Initiates Feng and Chao offer [[Thieves and Troublemakers]] and In the Wrong Hands. Pick them up before descending into the marsh.

Start killing sprites. They stand a chance of dropping orbs, but they mainly can be found near the big amber orbs on trees around the pools. To find the sword, head west out of the main pools area. [[Needlebottom]] can be found in a large depression at the west end of the marsh. He does count for Thieves and Troublemakers, too.
