==Objectives==
[[File:Niuzao Strongarm.jpg|thumb|[[Niuzao Strongarm]].]]
[[File:Niuzao Food Supply.jpg|thumb|Niuzao Food Supply.]]
Obtain 6 stores of Niuzao Food. Your [[Niuzao Strongarm]] will carry the food for you.
*Gather Food for Niuzao (6)

==Description==
Our patron Niuzao is a mountain on wheels... very difficult to move, even more difficult to stop. My point: once we get him moving, the mantid will have their arms full trying to slow him down.

The easiest way to get him moving is to put food in front of him. Luckily for us, food in our temple is plentiful... even in wartime.

I will send one of my strongarms with you, to shoulder the load.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
Niuzao, please... it is time to join the battle...

==Completion==
He will get up. Soon. Maybe not today, but soon.

And when he does...

<A smile grows on [[High Adept Paosha|Paosha]]'s face.>

==Notes==
On accept, a Niuzao Strongarm joins the party:
:{{text|say|Niuzao Strongarm|You lead the way. I'll carry the food.}}
Food supplies in the form of hay bales and picnic baskets can be found all along the southern side of the temple. While they can be found amongst the attacking mantid, many are available in the secure battlements without encountering any enemies at all.
