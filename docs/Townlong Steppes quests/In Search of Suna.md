==Objectives==

[[File:Shado-Pan Caravan.jpg|thumb|[[Shado-Pan Caravan]].]]
Speak to [[Ban Bearheart]] after arriving at [[Hatred's Vice]].

==Description==
I have bad news. When I returned, [[Suna Silentstrike|Suna]] was already gone.

The others say that she took her things and headed down the road to the east, muttering about hunting down the source of the yaungol aggression.

I cannot allow her to venture into dangerous territory alone.

I've already prepared a group of soldiers to push further east.

We are leaving shortly. Hop on the caravan if you wish to travel with the Shado-Pan. You can also meet us there if you wish.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|50}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Completion==
Well, we made it.

==Notes==

A [[Tame Steppebeast]] and the [[Shado-Pan Caravan]] are immediately behind Ban. Hop in.
:{{text|say|Yalia Sagewhisper|Ban, you look worried.}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|Yes, well... it's not like Suna to run off by herself.}}
:{{text|say|Yalia Sagewhisper|She must be torn by grief over her husband's death.}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|She blames me, you know.}}
:{{text|say|Yalia Sagewhisper|That may be, but it was no one's fault.}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|I should have taken the risk and sent the order to attack.}}
:{{text|say|Yalia Sagewhisper|You did what you thought was best. No commander has the foresight to see the future.}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|But now... she hates me.}}
:{{text|say|Yalia Sagewhisper|You swore the Shado-Pan blood oath together, did you not? You are bound together by powers far stronger than hatred.}}
:{{text|say|Yalia Sagewhisper|She cannot hate you. At least not forever. Hahahaha!}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|I hope so, Yalia.}}
:{{text|say|Xiao Tu|Look! Suna's tracks lead into the village ahead.}}
:{{text|say|Yalia Sagewhisper|Ugh, what is this stench?}}
:{{text|say|Xiao Tu|It looks like the site of... a massacre.}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|It's too quiet. We should check this out.}}
:{{text|say|Yalia Sagewhisper|But this place reeks of death!}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|We stop here. Everyone out!}}
:{{text|say|Xiao Tu|In this place? Are... are you sure?}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|Yes. Suna's tracks stop here. We won't leave until we find her.}}

Ban, Yalia, and Xian Tu are all at the bonfire. They all offer quests.
