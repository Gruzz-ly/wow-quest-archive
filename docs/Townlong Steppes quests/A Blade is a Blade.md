==Objectives==
[[File:Sra'thik Weapon.jpg|thumb|Sra'thik Weapon]]
Obtain 10 Sra'thik Weapons.
*[[Sra'thik Weapon]] (10)

==Description==
This is no time to hold to tradition. Our masons' calloused hands bleed and tremble. Our blacksmiths cannot forge weapons as quickly as our sentinels can break them.

It is time to fight smart.

Many of the [[mantid]] come bearing weapons, and when they die, they simply leave them on the battlefield. It would be a shame to see them go to waste.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
Our men are accustomed to fighting with maces and clubs. Unfortunately, we have little time for customs.

==Completion==
I will see to it that these are properly distributed. What's more - I'll make sure our blacksmiths get a rest. Niuzao knows they deserve it.

==Notes==
Start killing mantid and looting their weapons off the ground.

==Progression==
