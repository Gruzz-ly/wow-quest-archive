== Objectives ==
Kill 24 Shan'ze Ancestors. Shan'ze Ancestors may be found inside [[Mogu Burial Urn]]s.
* Shan'ze Ancestor slain (24)

== Description ==
We've found ancient mogu burial urns among the ruins on [[Shan'ze Dao]].

This is normally no problem, except these urns are home to angry mogu spirits.

Not only do these urns pose a danger to anyone unlucky enough to find one, but they could be used for destruction if they were to fall into the wrong hands.

We must rid Shan'ze Dao of their presence.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}

== Progress ==
Did the spirits cause you any problems?

== Completion ==
Good riddance, I say! Those mogu ghosts were long past their expiration.
