==Objectives==
Kill the mantid of the [[Sra'thik Incursion]] so that [[Tai Ho]] can search their bodies for pieces of [[Niuzao]]'s statuette.
*Find Statuette Head
*Find Statuette Body
*Find Statuette Legs
*Find Statuette Tail

==Description==
Niuzao owns a statuette which he values greatly: a small icon, in his image, sculpted by one of his long-since fallen sentinels. This statuette was recently stolen by the Sra'thik [[mantid]], and taken to their encampment to our north.

Bring back this statuette. Then we will give you - and your Shado-Pan associate - the answers you seek.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 429 trinkets
|Sigil of Compassion
|Sigil of Fidelity
|Sigil of Grace
|Sigil of Patience
|Sigil of Devotion}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]
*+250 reputation with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
Niuzao does not move quickly, nor does he make rash decisions. Perform his task and give him time to decide.

==Completion==
Niuzao will be pleased.

Despite his size, our patron is a beast of grace and compassion. He treasured this icon... just as he treasures each of his followers.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|As you wish. We will find your artifact. <name> - I will meet you at the [[Sra'thik Incursion]].}}
Run northeast out of the temple to the [[Sra'thik Incursion]], where [[Tai Ho]] joins the party.
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|Same drill as before. You do the killing, I'll do the searching.}}
Start killing [[Sra'thik Guard|Sra'thik guards]] or [[Sra'thik Wound-Mender|wound-menders]].

Find nothing:
*{{text|say|Tai Ho|Nothing here. Keep moving.}}
*{{text|say|Tai Ho|There's nothing here. Let's keep moving.}}

Find a poor-quality item:
*{{text|say|Tai Ho|No clues here... but I did find this.}}
*{{text|say|Tai Ho|What's this?}}

Statuette Legs:
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|Strange... this one carries a few pieces of polished stone.}}
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|Hopefully they came from Niuzao's statuette. We can only hope.}}
Statuette Body:
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|Another stone... and it matches the markings on the others we found.}}
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|I think we're getting somewhere, <name>. Let's keep looking around.}}
Statuette Tail
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|If I didn't know any better, I'd say this was a stone ox tail.}}
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|All that's left now is the head. And it can't have gotten far.}}
Statuette Head:
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|Here's the head. A perfect fit, too.}}
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|We've performed Niuzao's errand. Now it's time to get back to some real investigation.}}
:''Tai Ho takes off for the temple.''
Follow him to turn in.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Ogo the Elder|Come here, <race>. I wish to speak with you. Our secret can remain hidden no longer.}}
