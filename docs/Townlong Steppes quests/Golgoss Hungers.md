==Objectives==
[[File:Snarlvine.jpg|thumb|Snarlvine]]
Obtain 10 Snarlvines.
*[[Snarlvine]] (10)

==Description==
[[Golgoss]]' strength is great, but he requires nutrition before he can use it.

The snarlthorn bushes in the [[Upper Sumprushes]] have heavy, fibrous branches. These should sate his appetite.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Golgoss' hunger is great.

==Completion==
We are one step closer to my goal.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Arconiss Thirsts]] and [[Orbiss Fades]] before heading out.

Back up to the Upper Sumprushes. Mist geysers are small white clouds appearing every few seconds on the water. Kill beavers and loot snarlvine.

==Progression==
{{Lower Sumprushes}}

==Patch changes==
