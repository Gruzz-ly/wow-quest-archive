==Objectives==
Heal 8 Injured Shado-Pan Blackguards.
*Heal [[Injured Gao-Ran Blackguard]]s x8
*[[Citron-Infused Bandages]] (provided)

==Description==
<name>, I could use your help. With their long shifts, our warriors down at the southern front of the blockade are fighting to the point of exhaustion, and many of them have been exposed to the [[mantid]] poison.

We need more people to tend to the wounded. I've prepared some bandages with the herbs you brought me, but if you have some healing skills, those might work even better.

Please, <name>, get our men back on their feet so that they can get back here to safety.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
* 196000 XP
* +75 reputation with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
With the constant mantid attacks, the men are being worked to the bone. We are undermanned on all fronts.

Your help means a lot to us, <name>.

==Completion==
There are several warriors that owe their lives to you. You have my deepest appreciation, <class>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Endless Swarm]] and [[Rummaging Through the Remains]] before heading out.

Immediately to the southwest is the main blockade. Limbpincers are swarming, so help take them out. The limbs themselves pop off the corpses and appear on the ground. Look for units specifically called [[Injured Gao-Ran Blackguard]] to heal.

==Progression==
