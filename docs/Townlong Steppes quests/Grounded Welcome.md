==Objectives==
Kill 12 grounded Kor'thik Fleetwings.
*[[Kor'thik Fleetwing]] slain (12)

==Description==
All of my men are down at [[Farwatch Overlook]] to the southwest, holding off [[mantid]] that are trying to fly across the chasm. As long as my marksman have arrows, they'll ground any mantid that clear the chasm.

If you're here to help, I could use some more men clearing the mantid out once they're on the ground. Are you willing, <class>?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 429 chestpieces|Farwatch Satin Robe|Farwatch Hide Robes|Earthmover Breastplate|Farwatch Burnished Chestguard|Farwatch Silk Robe|Farwatch Leather Tunic|Osul Peak Chestguard|Farwatch Heavy Chestpiece|Farwatch Armored Chestpiece}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Our vigil continues...

==Completion==
Your efforts are appreciated, <class>. Even a few more moment's breath between attacks are a relief these days.

==Notes==
Pick up [[In Skilled Hands]] before heading out.

Exit from the watchpost to the southwest and follow the path to reach the [[Farwatch Overlook]]. There, [[Marksman Ye]] offers [[Choking the Skies]]. Pick it up before getting started killing. Also, look for [[Hawkmaster Nurong]] up on a hill overlooking both the overlook and the ravine far below.

On approach:
:{{Text|say|Hawkmaster Nurong|<Class>, up here! I could use a hand!}}
Turn in In Skilled Hands and pick up [[Hostile Skies]]. Do Hostile Skies and pick up [[Devastation Below]], then get started killing fleetwings and burning their corpses.

The path down to [[Voress'thalik]] is toward the north end of the overlook. Nurong is kiting Voress'thalik around the bottom of the [[Widening Deep]]. It has less than 800,000 health left.
