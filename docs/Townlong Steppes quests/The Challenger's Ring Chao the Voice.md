==Completion==
I'm sure there's no hard feelings. She just loves a good fight.

You should talk to her next time I have some missions for you. She's quite an able fighter, as I'm sure you saw.

==Notes==
Chao is right next to Snowdrift's position. Speak with her:
:Yeah? What's up?
:{{gossip|I'm here to challenge you!}}
:{{text|say|Chao the Voice|Ha! You think you're ready to take me on?}}
:{{text|say|Chao the Voice|Let's see if you're still standing after this.}}
:''Chao mounts up and runs down to the ring.''
Speak with her again:
:What, you change your mind? I understand. I wouldn't want to fight me, either.
:{{gossip|Let's do this.}}
