==Objectives==
Free 6 [[Wild Cloudrunner]]s from their chains.
*Wild Cloudriders freed (6)

==Description==
Do you know the story of the great [[cloud serpent]]s of [[Pandaria]], <name>?

Someday you must hear it. Unfortunately, there is no time to tell it now.

What you must know is that the wild cloudrunner serpents of Townlong are in trouble.

The mogu are capturing wild serpents and corrupting their minds, bending them to their sinister will.

Go to [[Shan'ze Dao]], to the northwest. Free the adult serpents from their chains. Save them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
The wild cloudrunners should remain free.

==Completion==
Good work, <race>. It gladdens me to see that the wild serpents are free once again.

==Notes==
Make sure to choose a companion before heading out. The cloud serpents are on the southeastern beach of the island.
