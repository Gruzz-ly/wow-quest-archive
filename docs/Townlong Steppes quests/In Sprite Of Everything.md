==Objectives==
[[File:Shan'ze Dao sprite den.jpg|thumb|Sprite den entrance.]]
[[File:Darkwoods Faerie.jpg|thumb|[[Darkwoods Faerie]].]]
Kill the Darkwoods Faerie.
*[[Darkwoods Faerie]] slain

==Description==
The sprites of [[Shan'ze Dao]] have always been capricious tricksters, but now they have fallen under the mogu's influence.

Even as we speak, they gather under a new leader.

We cannot allow this to happen.

Their mischievous pranks were one thing, but united, their dark magic is too powerful and too dangerous to comprehend.

Take out their leader before it is too late.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
The sprites are easily manipulated, and too dangerous to ignore.

==Completion==
Good work, <name>.

The wood sprites may look harmless, but that's what makes them so dangerous.

==Notes==
After completing the sprite and cloud-serpent portion of today's dailies, the Shado-Pan officer in the field offers this quest. Fly northwest to the western side of the island. Inside a small virmen hole is the [[Darkwoods Faerie]], a level 90 elite sprite with 1,969,000 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Starsurge|range=40|You fuse the power of the moon and sun, launching a devastating blast of energy at the target. Causes 14,764 to 14,770 Spellstorm damage to the target.}}
*{{abilities|Fae Spirit|This spirit shares health with its body.|notes=Summons a handful of fae spirits, 90 fey sprites with 94k health. Damage done to the dragonkin is mirrored on the boss.}}
*{{abilities|Night Sky|range=30|Calls down starshards that lasts 8 sec., inflcting Arcane damage every 2 sec. to all enemies in a selected area.|notes=2 sec cast. Hits for 20,217 Arcane}}
Finish it off, then head back.

==Progression==
{{Shado-Pan Garrison dailies}}
