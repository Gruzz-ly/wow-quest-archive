Kill 16 Gai-Cho Yaungol, Earthtalkers or Pitchthrowers.
*[[Gai-Cho Yaungol]], [[Gai-Cho Earthtalker|Earthtalkers]], or [[Gai-Cho Pitchthrower|Pitchthrowers]] Slain (16)

==Description==
The [[Yaungol]] are a constant nuisance, but [[Gai-Cho tribe|the group]] at [[Fire Camp Gai-Cho]], to the northeast, conspired with the [[Osul tribe|Osul yaungol]] in their recent incursion into [[Kun-Lai Summit|Kun-Lai]].

We cannot allow such an incursion to go unpunished.

Go, attack Fire Camp Gai-Cho. We need to make sure they remain occupied, so that they cannot rise up and threaten [[Ox Gate|The Ox Gate]] again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Is your raid on Gai-Cho complete?

==Completion==
Well - that should certainly deter any attack for a while. Good work, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Assault Deadtalker's Plateau]], [[The Enemy of My Enemy... Is Still My Enemy!]], and [[Spirit Dust (quest)]] before heading out. Don't forget to grab an NPC helper, either!

Circle around the [[Underbough]] to the northwest to reach [[Deadtalker's Plateau]]. [[Deadtalker Corpsedefiler]]s are walking around with seven [[Defiled Spirit]]s around them, with a total combined health pool of 1.3 million. Try to crowd-controll the deadtalker and AoE down the group—the ghosts merely have ~110,000 health each. Be wary of the elite [[Deadtalker Crusher]]s wandering around! It takes four [[Ancient Spirit Dust]] for each set of Defiled Yaungol Remains, so keep that in mind.

Once Deadtalker's Plateau and Spirit Dust are both complete, turn them in and pick up [[Uruk!]] from the companion. [[Uruk]] is on the northwest part of the plateau overlooking the [[Westersea]]. A level 90 yaungol, Uruk has 1,181,000 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Shadow Bolt|range=40|Hurls a bolt of dark magic at an enemy, inflicting Shadow damage.|notes=3 sec cast. Hits for ~40-43,000 Shadow.}}
*{{abilities|Call of the Keening Spirits|range=40|notes=4 sec cast.|cd=20 sec}}

Kill him, then keep heading north to the [[Gai-Cho Battlefield]] and [[Fire Camp Gai-Cho]]. Skip the battlefield itself and head up to the fire camp to start killing yaungol and looting [[Highly Explosive Yaungol Oil]] Barrels. Only ten barrels can be carried at a time, so gather a bunch, go out and kill the units on the battlefield, then repeat. Don't kill all of the yaungol on the mesa before killing the combatants down below.
