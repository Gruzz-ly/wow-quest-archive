==Description==
Our scouts have sent a very troubling report. Three of our trainees have gone missing, and our scouts found them... They've been captured by the mantid and sent to their Kunchong pits. Their Kunchong FEEDING pits. We're lucky that the Kunchong don't eat that often. I need you to get in there, give them these escape kites, and get them out!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
The trainees, <name>! You have to save them!

==Completion==
Oh, thank goodness. I was worried about them!

==Notes==
Make sure to choose a companion before heading out. The [[Feeding Pits]] are in the southwestern corner of [[Sra'vess]], but swarming flies will dismount players from their flying mounts after a few seconds. [[Ravenous Kunchong]] will stand near the "snack", then charge 50 yards away, wait a few seconds, then charge back. Either kill the elite kunchong or wait until it runs away before freeing the trainee.
