*[[Deadtalker Corpsedefiler]] slain (8)
*[[Deadtalker Crusher]] slain

==Description==
We have always left the Deadtalkers alone. For so long, they were just responsible for maintaining the sacred burial grounds of the [[yaungol]] tribes.

Now, though, they are practicing dark magic, defiling the corpses of their former clanmates...

I know not where the learned those dark magics, or why they no longer treat their dead with respect, but we do not have time to find out.

We need to stop them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Have you defeated the Deadtalkers?

==Completion==
By conspiring to use these dark magics, the Deadtalkers have given up their rights to protection. Your actions should deter them from their current course, I hope.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Assault Fire Camp Gai-Cho]], [[The Enemy of My Enemy... Is Still My Enemy!]], and [[Spirit Dust (quest)]] before heading out. Don't forget to grab an NPC helper, either!

Circle around the [[Underbough]] to the northwest to reach [[Deadtalker's Plateau]]. [[Deadtalker Corpsedefiler]]s are walking around with seven [[Defiled Spirit]]s around them, with a total combined health pool of 1.3 million. Try to crowd-controll the deadtalker and AoE down the group—the ghosts merely have ~110,000 health each. Be wary of the elite [[Deadtalker Crusher]]s wandering around! It takes four [[Ancient Spirit Dust]] for each set of Defiled Yaungol Remains, so keep that in mind.

Once Deadtalker's Plateau and Spirit Dust are both complete, turn them in and pick up [[Uruk!]] from the companion. [[Uruk]] is on the northwest part of the plateau overlooking the [[Westersea]]. A yaungol, Uruk has the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Shadow Bolt|range=40|Hurls a bolt of dark magic at an enemy, inflicting Shadow damage.|notes=3 sec cast. Hits for ~40-43,000 Shadow.}}
*{{abilities|Call of the Keening Spirits|range=40|notes=4 sec cast.|cd=20 sec}}

Kill him, then keep heading north to the [[Gai-Cho Battlefield]] and [[Fire Camp Gai-Cho]]. Skip the battlefield itself and head up to the fire camp to start killing yaungol and looting [[Highly Explosive Yaungol Oil]] Barrels. Only ten barrels can be carried at a time, so gather a bunch, go out and kill the units on the battlefield, then repeat. Don't kill all of the yaungol on the mesa before killing the combatants down below.
