== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Sha of Hatred.jpg|Sha of Hatred}}
Defeat the Sha of Hatred.
*Defeat the {{NPC||Sha of Hatred}} {{co|45.9|82.8|Townlong Steppes}}

== Description ==
The end of our hunt is upon us. We have gathered the strongest the [[Shado-Pan]] have to offer, and with your strength to aid us, we will defeat the Sha of Hatred and choke out its influence on the world.

When we enter the tunnel, stay close, and trust in my orders. Defeating a [[Sha]] is nearly impossible, but I have a plan that will surely assure our victory.

Whatever happens, it has been an honor traveling beside you, <name>.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Mistborne Hood
|Mistlurker Helm
|Earthmover Helm
|Goldtalon Headcover
|Swampwalker Cowl
|Steppebeast Helm
|Osul Peak Helm
|Temple Guardian Helm
|Palewind Helm
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|33}}
* 294000 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

== Progress ==
It's difficult to keep the hatred out of my heart when facing the creature that nearly put an end to the Shado-Pan.

== Completion ==
Defeating a Sha... is not an easy thing. And killing one is nearly impossible. It is a miracle that we came out of this unscathed.

Taran still blames himself for letting his hatred get the best of him and setting this beast loose on the land. It may take some time for him to come to terms with this, but it is important that he does, lest he be vulnerable again.

We accomplished a great thing this day, a thing that will not soon be forgotten.

And neither shall you for your hand in this. Thank you.

This concludes the main Sha of Hatred storyline, and "The Sha of Hatred" portion of [[One Steppe Forward, Two Steppes Back]]. The direct followup sends adventurers south to the [[Dread Wastes]], but just north of [[Sik'vess]] is the [[Shado-Pan Garrison]]. There, {{NPC||Tai Ho}} and {{NPC||Provisioner Bamfu}} offer quests: [[The Motives of the Mantid]], [[Set the Mantid Back]], [[Natural Antiseptic]], [[The Field Armorer]], and [[A Proper Poultice]].
