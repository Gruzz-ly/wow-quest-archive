==Objectives==
Kill Serevex with the aid of [[Lao-Chin the Iron Belly]].
*[[Serevex]] slain {{co|45.4|77.4|Townlong Steppes}}

==Description==
Lao-Chin is facing against the leader újust above the entrance in the tree, on the north side of [[Sik'vess]]. He is to bring back the second crystal that we need to get into the [[mantid]] tunnel.

Go there and lend him your aid.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
The Sha of Hatred dies this day...

==Completion==
We have the second crystal then. Good.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Taoshi and Korvexxis]] and [[Nurong and Rothek]] before heading out.

Take the southwest path out of [[Rensai's Watchpost]] past the [[Farwatch Overlook]] to reach [[Sik'vess]]. The first named mantid reached is Korvexxis, an elite mantid with no special abilities. Taoshi is hiding by a giant root.
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Your move. I'll follow you in.}}
Kill it.
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Good work.}}
Nurong and Rothek are all the way on the west side of Sik'vess—probably faster to circle around the north rather than all the way around the south.

On approaching Nurong:
:{{text|say|Hawkmaster Nurong|I'll cover you. Go whenever you're ready.}}
Rothek is also an elite mantid with no special abilities.
Death:
:{{text|say|Hawkmaster Nuron|Very impressive!}}
Finally, head just to the northeast to find Lao-Chin and Serevex.
:{{text|say|Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|I'll be with you.}}
Rothek is also a level 88 elite mantid with 1,356,000 health and no special abilities.
Death:
:{{text|say|Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|Not bad... not bad.}}
Turn in to {{NPC||Taran Zhu}} at the entrance to the [[Sik'vess Lair]], just to the southeast.
