==Objectives==
Kill the Sra'thik Swarmlord at [[Sra'vess]] in [[Townlong Steppes]].
*[[Sra'thik Swarmlord]] slain {{co|16.4|40.9|Townlong Steppes}}

==Description==
While we're here, we should do one more thing.

The Sra'thik Swarmlord is responsible for directing the [[mantid]] forces from the air.  If we leave it alive, it's going to cause trouble for the [[Shado-Pan Garrison|garrison]].

So we're not going to leave it alive.  Let's take it out, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
We need to take down the Swarmlord!

==Completion==
I heard you did a little... extra credit while you were out there.  Good work, friend.

Come back another day - I'm sure we'll have some more work for you.

==Notes==
After turning in the previous four, this quest automatically accepts. Fly to the northwest side of the island, [[Ikz'ka Ridge]]. Make sure there aren't any patrolling elites reporting to it, then aggro the swarmlord and pull it behind the house. A level 90 elite mantid with 2,757,000 health, the swarmlord has the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Blinding Speed|Increases damage and move speed by 20%. Stacks.|notes=Instant.}}
*{{abilities|Empower Blades|Increases damage dealt by 100% and slows movement speed by 70% for 8 sec.|notes=Instant. Announced by a boss emote:}}
**{{text|bossemote|Sra'thik Swarmlord casts [Empower Blades] Run!}}

Flee when he does the Empower Blades move, but otherwise move quickly as Blinding Speed will stack as far as it needs to.
