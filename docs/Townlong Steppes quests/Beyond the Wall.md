==Objectives==
Speak with [[Taran Zhu]] at the [[Longying Outpost]] in [[Townlong Steppes]].

==Description==
We received word the [[Shado-Pan]] have begun a counter attack in to Townlong Steppes. It sounds like they are going after the root of the yaungol invasion.

The pandaren have not traveled in force in to Townlong for thousands of years. The Shado-Pan are strong and brave, but they are also proud and few. They will need help from heroes like yourself. Can you travel through the [[Ox Gate|Gate of Winter's Blossom]] in the northwest? Find the Shado-Pan leaders and lend your help and experience?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
*12900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Welcome to Townlong Steppes. If you insist on wandering in to the darkest places of Pandaria then far be it from me to not put you to good use.

==Notes==
This is an ''optional'' breadcrumb directly to the [[Townlong Steppes storyline]], skipping a few quest hubs in the [[Kun-Lai Summit storyline]] for players who have already reached level 88. This quest is mutually exclusive with [[My Husband...]], as only one breadcrumb can lead to a new quest hub.

==Progression==
