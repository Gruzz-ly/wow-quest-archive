==Objectives==
Kill Rothek with the aid of [[Hawkmaster Nurong]].
*[[Rothek]] slain {{co|39.8|75.6|Townlong Steppes}}

==Description==
Hawkmaster Nurong has gone ahead to the northwest of [[Sik'vess]] to make sure the last [[mantid]] leader cannot escape.

Catch up with him and help him kill the mantid leader. Nurong will bring back the final crystal once you've aided him in this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Act swiftly. I do not want the Sha of Hatred to escape our grasp again.

==Completion==
The final crystal is ours. We are on the doorstep of our final confrontation.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Taoshi and Korvexxis]] and [[Lao-Chin and Serevex]] and Nurong and Rothek before heading out.

Take the southwest path out of [[Rensai's Watchpost]] past the [[Farwatch Overlook]] to reach [[Sik'vess]]. The first named mantid reached is Korvexxis, a level 88 elite mantid with 1,356,000 health and no special abilities. Taoshi is hiding by a giant root.
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Your move. I'll follow you in.}}
Kill it.
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Good work.}}
Nurong and Rothek are all the way on the west side of Sik'vess—probably faster to circle around the north rather than all the way around the south.

On approaching Nurong:
:{{text|say|Hawkmaster Nurong|I'll cover you. Go whenever you're ready.}}
Rothek is also a level 88 elite mantid with 1,356,000 health and no special abilities.
Death:
:{{text|say|Hawkmaster Nuron|Very impressive!}}
Finally, head just to the northeast to find Lao-Chin and Serevex.
:{{text|say|Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|I'll be with you.}}
Rothek is also a level 88 elite mantid with 1,356,000 health and no special abilities.
Death:
:{{text|say|Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|Not bad... not bad.}}
Turn in to {{NPC||Taran Zhu}} at the entrance to the [[Sik'vess Lair]], just to the southeast.
