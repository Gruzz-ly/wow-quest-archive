Kill 12 Sik'thik mantid.
*[[Sik'thik]] [[mantid]] slain (12)

==Description==
For all our efforts to keep the [[mantid]] in the [[Dread Wastes]], some have broken through, seemingly intent on [[Niuzao Temple]]. My men have been attempting to extinguish their presence to the west, at [[Sik'vess]], but to no success. If you're half of the <class> [[Taran Zhu|Taran]] paints you to be, maybe you will fair better.

Head west, and kill any Sik'thik mantid you find. And remember, this is no time for mercy. There are lives at the temple depending on us.

==Rewards==

|Sik'thik Locket
|Oakhide Choker
|Rensai's Necklace
|Crossroads Pendant
|Watchpost Amulet}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
How did it go?

==Completion==
The mantid are relentless. Fortunately for us, you have a dedication that surpasses even theirs.

It is good to have you walk these roads, <class>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Search for Restless Leng]] before heading out.

Head southwest to [[Sik'vess]] and start killing mantid and breaking cages. After breaking the eighth cage:
:{{text|say|Restless Leng|Thank you. I owe you greatly.}}
:{{Text|say|Restless Leng|I overheard a great deal through the cage. Rensai will be pleased with what I have to tell him.}}
:{{text|say|Restless Leng|I hope we meet again soon, my new friend.}}
Finish up killing, then head back to the watchpost.
