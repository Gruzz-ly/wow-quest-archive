[[File:Krik'thik Limbpincer.jpg|thumb|[[Krik'thik Limbpincer]].]]
Kill 12 Krik'thik attackers at the [[Gao-Ran Battlefront]].
*[[Krik'thik Limbpincer]] slain (12)

==Description==
[[Gao-Ran the Tempered|Gao-ran]]'s men need help down on the southern front. If you want to stand by the [[Shado-Pan]], that's where you should do it.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|item level 429 gloves|Mistborne Gloves|Mistlurker Gloves|Earthmover Gauntlets|Goldtalon Gloves|Swampwalker Handguards|Steppebeast Gloves|Osul Peak Gauntlets|Palewind Gauntlets|Temple Guardian Gauntlets}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Our vigil is never-ending.

==Completion==
The men of the blockade are growing to respect you. You clearly know how to fight.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Back on Their Feet]] and [[Rummaging Through the Remains]] before heading out.

Immediately to the southwest is the main blockade. Limbpincers are swarming, so help take them out. The limbs themselves pop off the corpses and appear on the ground. Look for units specifically called [[Injured Gao-Ran Blackguard]] to heal.
