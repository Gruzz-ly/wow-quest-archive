== Objectives ==
Search for [[Sentinel Ku-Yao]]. 

== Description ==
I've searched everywhere... but I haven't found my father. I KNOW he's alive still. He just needs his crossbow... then he'll be OK.

I've heard that you [[Shado-Pan]] guys sometimes fight the [[mantid]] on [[Sra'vess]]. I don't have any way of getting there. If you ever go over there, can you look for my dad? 

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236,000 [[XP]]

== Completion ==
<Ku-Mo doesn't seem to notice you.>

== Notes == 
This quest is only avaliable on days where [[Ling of the Six Pools]] is giving the [[Wu Kao]] set of daily quests at the [[Shado-Pan Garrison]].
