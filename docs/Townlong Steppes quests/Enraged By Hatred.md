==Objectives==
[[File:Dusklight Hollow scorpid nest.jpg|thumb|Scorpid nest in Dusklight Hollow]]
Kill 9 Seething Fleshrippers.
*[[Seething Fleshripper]] slain (9)

==Description==
These [[scorpion]]s are infected with [[sha]]. It seems to have driven out of their hole and into [[Dusklight Hollow|our camp]], hatred seething at invaders in their territory.

We need to clear the scorpions and secure the camp. Kill any you find.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 429 cloaks
|Cloak of the Hollow
|Cloak of Seething Hatred
|Scorpion Drape
|Fleshripper Cape
|Dusklight Drape}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
The [[Sha of Hatred]]'s passing did this to them. I doubt this is the only thing that will have been affected by it's passing.

==Completion==
Good. What's left of the camp will be a bit safer.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Taking Stock]] before heading out.

Start killing scorpions and looting arrows in groups of 4 to 19. More scorpid can be found in the nest to the southeast of the main ruined camp.
