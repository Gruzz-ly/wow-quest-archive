==Objectives==
Collect 10 Violet Citron.
*[[Violet Citron]] (10)

==Description==
A new face! Pleasure to meet you. I'm [[Septi the Herbalist|Septi]]. I keep the [[Shado-Pan]] fighting.

The mantid have [[poison]] that chews through the skin and infects the blood. It makes for slow, excruciating death when not treated.

I need pollen from the violet citron flowers. The nearest place to find them is around [[Dampsoil Burrow]] just north of the blockade. If you happen to go in that direction, could you bring some back for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Mixed properly, the pollen from these flowers can eat away at the poison without doing any lasting damage to the body otherwise.

==Completion==
Marvelous. And in good condition too!

Thank you, kind <class>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Behind the Battlefront]] before heading out. Circle around to the north to find Taoshi on the southern lip of the crevasse. Quickly turn in Behind the Battlefront and pick up [[Unwelcome Intruders]].

Start gathering [[Violet Citron]] and killing [[Krik'thik Deep-Scout]]s. Taoshi will drop out of stealth to help. Head back to the battlefront and turn in Treatment, then keep heading northeast back toward [[Hatred's Vice]] to reach [[Shallowstep Pass]]. Taoshi is standing next to [[Mao the Lookout]].
