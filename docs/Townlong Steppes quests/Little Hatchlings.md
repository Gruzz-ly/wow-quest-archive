==Objectives==
[[File:Cloudrunner Hatchling.jpg|thumb|Cloudrunner Hatchlings.]]
Free 20 Cloudrunner Hatchlings.
*[[Cloudrunner Hatchling]]s freed (20)

==Description==
I have seen the cruel experiments that the Shan'ze are performing on [[Shan'ze Dao|their island]] to the northwest.

The Shan'ze raise baby serpents from the egg. They keep the young in tiny cages, surrounded by squalor and filth.

The cruelest gaolers starve and torture them.

We must save as many hatchlings as we can. You have my full permission to punish any mogu that gets in your way!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
The mogu are cruel beyond measure.

==Completion==
Those creatures will remember you as their savior.

You have done well, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Mogu Menace]], [[Spiteful Sprites]], and [[Egg Rescue!]] before heading out. Speak to a friendly NPC for a battle companion before leaving the garrison. If not already done, pick up and complete [[Through the Portal]] from [[Moshu the Arcane]] up at [[Shan'ze Dao]] to open up a portal to/from [[Shan'ze Dao]].

At the base camp, head west and start killing sprites. There's a bigger camp on the west side of the island as well. Once that's done, cross back to the east and head down the hill to the cloud strider area. Eggs litter the ground, the hatchlings are caged, and hostile mogu are everywhere.

Turn in all four to the Shado-Pan companion out in the field and pick up [[In Sprite Of Everything]] before heading back to the garrison.

==Progression==
