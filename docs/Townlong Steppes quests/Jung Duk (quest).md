==Description==
THIS. IS. WAR.

I will have the heads of everyone who took [[Lin Silentstrike|Lin]] from me. EVERYONE!

We will begin with the Osul leader, Jung Duk.

Take this [[Shado-Pan]] war banner and place it at the center of their camp.

Jung Duk will have no choice but to face you.

Show him no mercy, <name>.

==Progress==
Jung Duk's legacy is written in the blood of innocents.

==Completion==
Jung Duk is dead at last.

Hundres, perhaps thousands, lost their lives due to his violent aggression.

Though they are not here to witness his demise, they owe deep gratitude to your bravery today.

==Notes==
Just northwest past [[Katak the Defeated]] is the Ceremonial Pile. Interact with it. [[Jung Duk]], a yaungol, will come running from the northwest.
