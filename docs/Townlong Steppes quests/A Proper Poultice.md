==Objectives==
[[File:Mao-Willow.jpg|thumb|Mao-Willow]]
Obtain 11 Mao-Willows.
*[[Mao-Willow]] (11)

==Description==
A dry bandage doesn't do much good, other than maybe keeping bugs out of the wound. In some camps, that's the best you can hope for.

Not in my camp, though.

I prefer to make a paste from whatever soothing herbs I can find, and layer that between bandages. The most soothing herbs I've been able to find in the field are the Mao-Willows from the fields in the northeast. If you run into any, bring them back.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Any luck out there, <name>?

==Completion==
These will do. The [[Shado-Pan]] appreciates your work, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Natural Antiseptic]] and [[The Field Armorer]] before heading out. Don't focus on these quests to the exclusion of others&mdash;they're long-term gathering quests. The main chain starts with [[The Motives of the Mantid]] and [[Set the Mantid Back]] from [[Tai Ho]].

Head northeast to the [[Underbough]] to start killing mushan and tigers and looing Mao-Willows. Saliva drops in units of 56-79. Shell fragments drop in quantities of 8-12, and willows are gathered individually.

==Progression==
{{Shado-Pan Garrison}}
