==Objectives==
[[File:Krik'thik Limb.jpg|thumb|Krik'thik Limb]]
Recover 20 Krik'thik Limbs.
*[[Krik'thik Limb]] (20)

==Description==
I do have another task for you, <name>, though it's a might grim. I really need to get to the bottom of this mantid poison, but to do that, I need more information directly from the source.

While you're down on the southern battlefield, could you bring me back some [[mantid]] limbs so that I can examine their intact poison glands?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Dislodged Stinger]]
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
I'm hoping to find a permanent counter to the mantid poison so that the men won't be affected in the first place. It may take some time to piece it together.

==Completion==
These are in great condition! Thank you, <name>!

You know, I've managed to distill some of their poison into a form that we can apply readily. I've even come up with some methods for weaving it into spell-casting, if you believe it. Would you like to give some a try?

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Endless Swarm]] and [[Back on Their Feet]] before heading out.

Immediately to the southwest is the main blockade. Limbpincers are swarming, so help take them out. The limbs themselves pop off the corpses and appear on the ground. Look for units specifically called {{NPC||Injured Gao-Ran Blackguard}} to heal.

==Progression==
{{Gao-Ran Battlefront}}

==Patch changes==
