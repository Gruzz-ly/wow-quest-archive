==Objectives==
Obtain 4 Clotted Rodent's Blood.
*[[Clotted Rodent's Blood]] (4)

==Description==
[[Arconiss]] fights with unmatched fury, but his extended stay beneath the mists has left him weakened.

The [[Swamp Rodent|rodents]] of the swamp are plentiful, and their bodies are filled with nourishing blood. Return with blood enough to reignite Arconiss' spirit.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Our preparation will not take much longer.

==Completion==
Yet another step closer to completing my mission.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Golgoss Hungers]] and [[Orbiss Fades]] before heading out.

Back up to the Upper Sumprushes. Mist geysers are small white clouds appearing every few seconds on the water. Kill beavers and loot snarlvine.

==Progression==
{{Lower Sumprushes}}

==Patch changes==
