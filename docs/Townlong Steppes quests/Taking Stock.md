==Objectives==
[[File:Shado-Pan Fire Arrows.jpg|thumb|Shado-Pan Fire Arrows]]
Gather 120 Shado-Pan Fire Arrows.
*[[Shado-Pan Fire Arrows]] (120)

==Description==
I was dispatched back to [[Dusklight Hollow|camp]] to gather pitch-tipped arrows for our archers at [[Dusklight Bridge|the bridge]], and this is what I came to. I trained with most of these pandaren... I wasn't prepared for this.

Still, the archers at the bridge need our help. If you could help gather arrows from the wreckage, then maybe we can salvage something from this horror.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
The pandaren at the bridge are depending on us.

==Completion==
I... you... er, thank you. You didn't have to help, but you did. Thank you.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Enraged By Hatred]] before heading out.

Start killing scorpions and looting arrows in groups of 4 to 19. More scorpid can be found in the nest to the southeast of the main ruined camp.

==Progression==
{{Dusklight Hollow}}
