Where have you been all my life?! That was amazing!

I'm proud to fight by you any day.

== Notes ==
Before heading down to kill the named, do [[Grounded Welcome]] and [[Choking the Skies]] up at the [[Farwatch Overlook]].

The path down to {{NPC||Voress'thalik}} is toward the north end of the overlook. Nurong is kiting Voress'thalik around the bottom of the [[Widening Deep]]. It has roughly a million health left, but takes double damage if attacked from behind. Voress'thalik is fixated on Nurong, so don't worry about pulling aggro off him.

On complete:
