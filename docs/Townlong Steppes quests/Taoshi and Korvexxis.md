==Objectives==
Kill Korvexxis with the aid of [[Taoshi]].
*[[Korvexxis]] slain {{co|46.6|83.1|Townlong Steppes}}

==Description==
Taoshi is setting up an ambush for one of the [[mantid]] leaders on the south side of [[Sik'vess]]. She is tasked with retrieving his crystal so that we can use it to open the door.

Two are stronger than one. I want you there to make sure it goes smoothly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Our hunt is nearly over...

==Completion==
The first crystal is ours...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Lao-Chin and Serevex]] and [[Nurong and Rothek]] before heading out.

Take the southwest path out of [[Rensai's Watchpost]] past the [[Farwatch Overlook]] to reach [[Sik'vess]]. The first named mantid reached is Korvexxis, a level 88 elite mantid with 1,356,000 health and no special abilities. Taoshi is hiding by a giant root.
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Your move. I'll follow you in.}}
Kill it.
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Good work.}}
Nurong and Rothek are all the way on the west side of Sik'vess—probably faster to circle around the north rather than all the way around the south.

On approaching Nurong:
:{{text|say|Hawkmaster Nurong|I'll cover you. Go whenever you're ready.}}
Rothek is also a level 88 elite mantid with 1,356,000 health and no special abilities.
Death:
:{{text|say|Hawkmaster Nuron|Very impressive!}}
Finally, head just to the northeast to find Lao-Chin and Serevex.
:{{text|say|Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|I'll be with you.}}
Rothek is also a level 88 elite mantid with 1,356,000 health and no special abilities.
Death:
:{{text|say|Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|Not bad... not bad.}}
Turn in to [[Taran Zhu]] at the entrance to the [[Sik'vess Lair]], just to the southeast.
