==Objectives==
Kill 12 Krik'thik Deep-scouts with [[Taoshi]]'s help.
*[[Krik'thik Deep-Scout]] slain (12)

==Description==
Those are [[mantid]] scouts down there. [[Gao-Ran Battlefront|Gao-Ran's Battlefront]] is meant to keep them out of eastern [[Townlong Steppes]]. If we allow them north of the barricade, we may lose our foothold here.

Let's clear them out. I'll be with you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Completion==
This is where they're getting throug{{sic}}, the eastern pass.

==Notes==
North of the [[Gao-Ran Battlefront]] for [[Behind the Battlefront]] and [[Treatment for the Troops]], find [[Taoshi]] on the south side of the crevasse at [[Dampsoil Burrow]]. Turn in Behind the Battlefront and pick up this quest.

Start gathering [[Violet Citron]] and killing [[Krik'thik Deep-Scout]]s.
On kills:
*{{text|say|Taoshi|You should never have left the Dread Wastes, mantid.}}
*{{text|say|Taoshi|What desperation makes them think they stand a chance past our lines...}}
*{{text|say|Taoshi|Take that message back to your queen, mantid.}}
Objective complete:
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Good work. Meet me at the eastern entrance to the blockade. We need to find the hole in the defenses and plug it.}}
Head back to the battlefront and turn in Treatment, then keep heading northeast back toward [[Hatred's Vice]] to reach [[Shallowstep Pass]]. Taoshi is standing next to [[Mao the Lookout]].
