==Objectives==
Speak to [[Yalia Sagewhisper]] to begin the ceremony.

Then, activate the Totem of Kindness, the Totem of Tranquility, and the Totem of Serenity.
*Speak to Yalia Sagewhisper {{co|82.6|73.0|Townlong Steppes}}
*[[Totem of Kindness]] activated {{co|82.6|73.2|Townlong Steppes}}
*[[Totem of Tranquility]] activated {{co|82.4|73.6|Townlong Steppes}}
*[[Totem of Serenity]] activated {{co|82.7|73.6|Townlong Steppes}}
*Ritual completed

==Description==
If my suspicions are correct, this place still reels from some lingering darkness.

Whatever happened here... it could not have been the natural course of events.

Even the [[yaungol]] are not so brutal as to slaughter their own kind to the point of... this.

I will use the totems that you brought me to perform a cleansing ritual.

I need someone to assist me in the ceremony. Let me know when you are ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
I believe that we must drive the taint from this place.

==Completion==
We look upon the true face of hatred!

Now it all makes sense. This is the work of the [[sha]].

==Notes==
[[File:What Lies Beneath - After.jpg|thumb|The sha have come]]
Speak with her again.
:{{gossip|I am ready to begin the ritual.}}
:{{text|say|Yalia Sagewhisper|Follow me, <name>. We will use these totems to purify the earth.}}
:{{text|say|Yalia Sagewhisper|Now! Let us see what darkness corrupts this place!}}
:{{text|say|Yalia Sagewhisper|<Name>, help me by activating the three large totems.}}
There are three big totams and six small totems in a decently large circle centered on Yalia. Interact with each of the big ones.

:''The adventurer is stunned as a giant sha appears out of ground''
After regaining control, immediately run to the giant glowing circle on the ground, a huge Pool of Harmony. The pool reduces the amount of hatred a player has, as indicated by a progress bar in the center of the screen. Should players let the progress bar reach 100%, they will spawn a [[Seething Hatred]] of their own to deal with. Additionally, [[Spiteful Spirit]]s will spawn, aggroed on the player from halfway across the map. Attempt to stay near guards, as even though they are possessed by the sha, they will still kill yaungol.

==Progression==
