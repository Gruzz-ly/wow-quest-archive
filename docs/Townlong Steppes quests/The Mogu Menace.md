==Objectives==
[[File:Shan'ze Serpentbinder.jpg|thumb|[[Shan'ze Serpentbinder]].]]
[[File:Shan'ze Beastmaster.jpg|thumb|[[Shan'ze Beastmaster]].]]
Kill 12 [[Shan'ze Serpentbinder]]s or [[Shan'ze Beastmaster]]s.
*Shan'ze Serpentbinders or Beastmasters slain (12)

==Description==
Our scouts have discovered a heavy mogu force at [[Shan'ze Dao]] to the northwest.

The island was supposedly uninhabited, so their presence is disturbing news.

Even more disturbing is the fact that they are performing sinister experiments on the island.

I need a capable <class> to check out the situation.

The Shan'ze are likely to give you trouble, and if they do, kill them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
How many were there?

==Completion==
The Shan'ze are up to something. Well done, <name>, but we must continue to monitor their actions.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Spiteful Sprites]], [[Egg Rescue!]], and [[Little Hatchlings]] before heading out. Speak to a friendly NPC for a battle companion before leaving the garrison. If not already done, pick up and complete [[Through the Portal]] from [[Moshu the Arcane]] up at [[Shan'ze Dao]] to open up a portal to/from [[Shan'ze Dao]].

At the base camp, head west and start killing sprites. There's a bigger camp on the west side of the island as well. Once that's done, cross back to the east and head down the hill to the cloud strider area. Eggs litter the ground, the hatchlings are caged, and hostile mogu are everywhere.

Turn in all four to the Shado-Pan companion out in the field and pick up [[In Sprite Of Everything]] before heading back to the garrison.
