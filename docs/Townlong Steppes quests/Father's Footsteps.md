==Description==
Yes, the boy's father - [[Sentinel Ku-Yao]] - has gone missing. He could be any number of places... we have no shortage of enemies these days.

You're free to look around, if you wish. You might start by looking for his yak, or by asking Sentinel Yalo what he knows.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*196000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Any luck?

==Completion==
No shield, no crossbow, no yak... something bad has happened to dad.

==Notes==
Yalo is just north of Qipan on the second level of the courtyard, pacing by the foot of the steps. Interact with him:
:{{text|say|Sentinel Yalo|You're looking for Ku-Yao? I haven't seen him in days. You don't think he's in trouble, do you?}}
Head up the stairs behind Yalo and stop at the entrance of the watch tower. On the left side of the entrance is Father's Shield.
:{{text|bossemote|The shield is engraved. Sentinel Ku-Yao. It belongs to the boy's father.}}
Head inside to find Father's Bedroll.
:{{text|bossemote|Ku-Yao's bedroll is empty. He's not here.}}
Finally, head to the back of the temple. [[Ha-Cha]] is standing in front of of a yak statue. Interact with it:
:{{text|bossemote|This is Ha-Cha, Sentinel Ku-Yao's Yak.}}
Return to Ku-Mo back near Qipan.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Ku-Mo|Thanks for your help, <mister/miss>. I'm going to keep looking for my dad now.}}
:{{text|say|Ku-Mo|I hope I find him.}}

The follow-up for this quest is [[Seeking Father]], which is only avaliable on days where [[Ling of the Six Pools]] is giving daily quests at the [[Shado-Pan Garrison]].
