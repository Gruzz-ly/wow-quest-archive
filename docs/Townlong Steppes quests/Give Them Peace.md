==Objectives==

Give peace to 10 Fear-Stricken Sentinels by closing their eyes and placing them on their bellies.
*Give peace to [[Fear-Stricken Sentinel]] (10)

==Description==
I overheard. Our secret is out, then.

When I learned that the [[mantid]] had burrowed beneath [[Niuzao Temple|our temple]], I reacted hastily. I sent dozens of guardians to defend what they could, but they were not prepared. They succumbed to fear, and never returned.

A [[pandaren]] deserves to die embracing the ground, as he does in sleep... not flat on his back with his eyes transfixed in terror. Please, <name>. Give them the peace they deserve.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
I should have gone with them.

==Completion==
Thank you, <class>.

<Qipan sighs.>

I should have been among them.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Terrible Truth]] and [[A Trail of Fear]] before heading out.

Exit the temple to the north and turn left, heading southwest. Along the edge of the cliff are a few banners and a trail that circles back to the southeast under the cliff to enter the [[Niuzao Catacombs]].

[[Fear-Stricken Sentinel]]s litter the ground. Interact with them to flip them on their stomachs. [[Dreadling]]s are also all over the catacombs. Near the back of the catacombs is the [[Ghastly Confines]]. Find it to complete the "Investigate" step of The Terrible Truth. Inside the ghastly confines is the [[Dread Shadow]]. See its article for tactics. [[Tai Ho]] is in the room with the dread shadow, so turn in The Terrible Truth to him. Kill a path back out of the crypts and turn in up top at the temple.
