==Objectives==
[[File:Darkwoods Pixie.jpg|thumb|[[Darkwoods Pixie]].]]
[[File:Darkwoods Charmer.jpg|thumb|[[Darkwoods Charmer]].]]
Kill 30 [[Darkwoods Pixie]]s or [[Darkwoods Charmer]]s.
*Darkwoods Sprites or Darkwoods Charmers slain (30)

==Description==
The [[Darkwoods]] [[sprite]]s on [[Shan'ze Dao]] have fallen to the [[mogu]]'s domination.

The once sly tricksters are now the full servants of the [[Shan'ze]]. They grow bolder each day, stealing and killing to satisfy their masters.

They must be eliminated, but be careful. They may look harmless, but they are actually quite vicious.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
The sprites must do as their masters command.

==Completion==
Good work, <class>. Left unchecked, the sprites would soon outnumber our entire army.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Mogu Menace]], [[Egg Rescue!]], and [[Little Hatchlings]] before heading out. Speak to a friendly NPC for a battle companion before leaving the garrison. If not already done, pick up and complete [[Through the Portal]] from [[Moshu the Arcane]] up at [[Shan'ze Dao]] to open up a portal to/from [[Shan'ze Dao]].

At the base camp, head west and start killing sprites. There's a bigger camp on the west side of the island as well. Once that's done, cross back to the east and head down the hill to the cloud strider area. Eggs litter the ground, the hatchlings are caged, and hostile mogu are everywhere.

Turn in all four to the Shado-Pan companion out in the field and pick up [[In Sprite Of Everything]] before heading back to the garrison.
