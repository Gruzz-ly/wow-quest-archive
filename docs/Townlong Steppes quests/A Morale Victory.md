[[File:Eastern Idol.jpg|thumb|Eastern idol.]]

Destroy the Southern, Central, Eastern and Western Idols at [[Sra'vess]].
*Southern idol
*Western idol
*Central idol
*Eastern idol

==Description==
The mantid have statues built on Sra'vess. We don't know exactly what they use them for. They may have some sort of religious significance, or maybe they assist with their sonic communication.

When you fight your opponent, you don't just engage them physically, you also engage them mentally. Whatever they use them for, the fact is that those statues are important to them.

Which is why I want you to blow them up. Losing something important will be a substantial hit to morale.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
The statues?

==Completion==
I'm sure they'll be upset without those statues. Right?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ling of the Six Pools|Here, take these supplies. You'll need them for your missions.}}
Pick up [[Sra'vess Wetwork]], [[The Bigger They Come...]], and [[Destroy the Siege Weapons!]] before heading out. Also, pick up the Bag of Wu Kao Supplies by her feet. Don't forget to speak to a friendly NPC for a battle companion before leaving the garrison.

Get to [[Sra'vess]]. On the island, adventurers are provided with an Assassin's Shroud, which puts the adventurer in stealth. The supply bag had 10x[[Shiny Shado-Pan Coin]] and 6x[[Wu-Kao Dart of Lethargy]] inside, which can be used while under the quest stealth.

The two northern siege weapons are at the [[Sra'thik Swarmdock]] on the northeast side of the island. As is the [[Sra'thik Swarm-Leader]]. And the Eastern Idol.

On the southeast side of the island is the [[Kzzok Warcamp]], which has both of the southern siege weapons. The southern idol is just west of the camp, where the mantid are cutting down trees.

The central idol is due north of the southern idol, across the lake near the [[kypari]] tree itself on its southern side. Finally, the western idol is just south of the [[Ikz'ka Ridge]], which is the northwest corner of the island.

The elites patrol the roads with two non-elites. Pull them to a cleared area to fight them. Don't forget about using the dart to sap one of the three! The [[Sra'thik Swarmlord]] does NOT count for the elite-killing quest, so keep that in mind.
