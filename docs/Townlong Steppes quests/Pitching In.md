==Objectives==
Use Ban's Explosives to destroy 6 Osul Ballistas.
*[[Osul Ballista]]s destroyed x6
* [[Ban's Explosives]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[yaungol|yaungol's]] [[siege weapon]]s - those ballista spearthrowers down there - are tearing apart our defenses both at [[Longying Outpost]] and in [[Kun-Lai Summit]].

Those terrible weapons must be destroyed.

Take these explosives. I've covered the arrows in the pitch that you collected.

Toss them at those ballistas, and we'll give the yaungol a little taste of their own medicine.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ban's Bag of Bombs
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|11|40|}}
* 700 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Fire is a cruel weapon. Luckily, we are only using it to destroy weapons of war.

==Completion==
Good, <class>.

Now that they cannot hide behind their siege weapons, they have no choice but to face us.

==Notes==
[[File:Suna and Ban after Ranger Rescue.jpg|thumb|Suna and Ban after Ranger Rescue]]
Pick up [[Seeing Red]] and [[Ranger Rescue]] before heading out. Before going too far, {{NPC||Katak the Defeated}} just to the north down the hill also offers [[The Exile]].

Start killing Spearguards for Seeing Red and Ranger Rescue. Use the [[Stone Key]]s the spearguards drop to open [[Drywood Cage]]s, which contain {{NPC||Longying Ranger}}s. They will join the party once freed. Use the quest item on {{NPC||Osul Ballista}} to destroy them, not regular attacks. The three named ''do'' count for Seeing Red, so take advantage of that. Battat is just to the west, Urang is just to the northwest of Battat, and Ku-Tong is on the north side of the big field, all in big tents.

Lin, unfotunately, did not make it. His corpse can be found just south of Ku-Tong's position, north of the big field. Finish up and turn in.
