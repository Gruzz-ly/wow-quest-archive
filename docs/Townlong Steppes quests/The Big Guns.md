[[File:Sra'thik Fleshrender.jpg|thumb|[[Sra'thik Fleshrender]].]]
Destroy 3 Sra'thik War Wagons.
*[[Sra'thik War Wagon]] exploded x3
*[[Pot of Fire]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[mantid]] now surround the [[Niuzao Temple|Temple]] with their infernal war wagons. The sooner we are rid of those things, the better. You could destroy them with your own weapons and spells, but this will work much faster.

<Ogo hands you a few small casks of hastily-packed explosives.>

Beware of retaliation from mantid that remain be inside the war wagon when it explodes. In fact, I'd stay as far away from those things as possible.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
We can push these mantid back. We can outlast them.

==Completion==
Good, you're back in one piece.

We hope to be seeing more of you in the future, <race>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Siege Swells]], [[The Overwhelming Swarm]], and [[In Battle's Shadow]] before getting started.
