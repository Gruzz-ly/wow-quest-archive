==Objectives==
Obtain 120 Rankbite Shell Fragments.
*[[Rankbite Shell Fragment]] (120)

==Description==
The [[Shado-Pan]] fight. As such, their armor often gets cut, scratched, torn, and burned. And it's my job to repair it.

I'm no armorer, but I can repair a broken piece of mail as long as the hole's not too big.

I prefer to use shell fragments from the tortoises that live in the wild fields to the northeast. Get some for me, and I can keep more Shado-Pan armored and alive.

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11}}
* 196000 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
I refuse to let one of our kind fall just because of a broken set of armor.

==Completion==
Excellent. I'll get to repairing the armor tonight, once most everyone's returned.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Natural Antiseptic]] and [[A Proper Poultice]] before heading out. Don't focus on these quests to the exclusion of others&mdash;they're long-term gathering quests. The main chain starts with [[The Motives of the Mantid]] and [[Set the Mantid Back]] from [[Tai Ho]].

Head northeast to the [[Underbough]] to start killing [[Longshadow Mushan]] and [[Rankbite Tortoise]]s and looing Mao-Willows. Saliva drops in units of 56-79. Shell fragments drop in quantities of 8-12, and willows are gathered individually.

==Progression==
{{Shado-Pan Garrison}}
