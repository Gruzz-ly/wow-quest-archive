Is this the place where they replace defective yaks?

*98000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This yak is not a good yak. Not at all.

==Completion==
I think we made a convincing argument. They'll HAVE to replace my yak now.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Bluesaddle|As you can see, this is a defective yak. Go ahead, <race>. Try to pet it.}}
Interact with it to channel "Pet Gently" for seven seconds. Upon conclusion, Ruthers will launch the player up and back a few yards.
:{{text|say|Bluesaddle|You see? Bad yak. Now go on, <race>. Try to feed it.}}
Interact with it again.
:{{text|say|Yak-Keeper Kyana|I think you don't understand how the yak temple works.}}
Interact with it again.
:{{text|say|Yak Keeper Kyana|Try to understand, grummle. This is a temple to Niuzao, the great Black Yak. We are servants to him, and keepers of the temple. We do not "replace yaks".}}
:{{text|say|Bluesaddle|I see. Can I at least get mine serviced? He won't even take a rider.}}
Interact with it one last time.
:{{text|say|Cousin Bag-of-Rocks|Cousin Bluesaddle... you are too persistent. And you are being mean to the <race>.}}
:''When the channel completes, the yak launches the player down the stairs, inflicting a little fall damage.''
:{{text|say|Bluesaddle|My case is made. This yak is very bad. We will not leave this yak temple until you fix him or replace him.}}
On complete:
:{{text|say|Yak-Keeper Kyana|Fine. There are plenty of wild yaks near the lake to the north. You can "replace" your yak with one of those.}}
:{{text|say|Bluesaddle|See, Cousin Bag-of-Rocks? Persistence pays off.}}
:{{text|say|Cousin Bag-of-Rocks|But... we could have found wild yaks back in [[Kun-Lai Summit|Kun-Lai]]...}}
:''The two grummles and their yak walk down the steps.''

Find Bluesaddle and Bag-of-Rocks out in the field to the northeast by the lake.
