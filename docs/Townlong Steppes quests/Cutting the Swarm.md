==Objectives==
[[File:Krik'thik Acidslinger.jpg|thumb|[[Krik'thik Acidslinger]].]]
Use a Dragon Launcher to kill 50 swaming [[mantid]].
*[[Krik'thik Drone]] slain (50)

==Description==
The mantid numbers have been increasing since you left for [[Ambermarsh|the cleft]]. Let's put these orbs you gathered to use.

Get down on the blockade and man one of the cannons. Let none through.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
I can't remember the last time they swarmed this thickly. They probably haven't within my lifetime.

==Completion==
We're not done yet...

==Notes==
Back to the southwest. [[Krik'thik Drone|Krik'thik drones]] and [[Krik'thik Acidslinger|acidslinger]]s are swarming the barricades. Mount one of the Dragon Launchers. They have one ability:
*{{abilities|Dragon Cannon|range=30-200|Launches a rocket at the targeted location, dealing 0 Fire damage and knocking enemies back from the point of impact.|notes=1.5 sec cast. Deals 430,000-460,000 Fire damage.}}
The cannons can one-shot all of the mobs in its targeting circle, so take as many as possible. The cannon does not have a cooldown.

Once the fiftieth [[mantid]] has been slain, a cutscene pulls the camera out to the battlefield to show [[Norvakess]], the terror of the [[Dread Wastes]], coming out of the ground!
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Looks like we have our work cut out for us...}}
Speak to Taoshi, a yard from the player, to continue.
