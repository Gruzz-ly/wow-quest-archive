[[File:VZ-Townlong Steppes.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

The '''[[Townlong Steppes]] storyline''' takes place after the [[Kun-Lai Summit storyline]] and the [[Shado-Pan Monastery]] during the [[Mists of Pandaria campaign]]. Adventurers cross in to Townlong via the [[Ox Gate]] southwest of [[Winter's Blossom]].

The progression of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[One Steppe Forward, Two Steppes Back]].

==Fire Camp Osul ==

Just on the other side of the wall are [[Fire Camp Osul]] and the [[Longying Outpost]], the latter of which was recently taken by the [[Shado-Pan]] to serve as a base. {{NPC||Suna Silentstrike}}, {{NPC||Ban Bearheart}}, {{NPC||Taoshi}}, and {{NPC||Taran Zhu}}, cleansed of his sha corruption, are having a war conference around a bonfire.

After the events at [[Fire Camp Osul]], Suna has run off. Ban and the rest of the Shado-Pan are trailing her footsteps, but stop when they reach [[Hatred's Vice]], the site of a yaungol massacre.

After figuring out what happened at Hatred's Vice, Ban sends adventurers forward to the [[Gao-Ran Battlefront]].

A more immediate threat than the {{NPC||Sha of Hatred}} has been wearing down the [[Gao-Ran Battlefront]] of late: the [[mantid]]. {{NPC||Gao-Ran the Tempered}}'s [[Shado-Pan]] have been worked to the bone, and some haven't slept in days. What's worse, the mantid are getting through.

Immediate threat taken care of, {{NPC||Taran Zhu}} and {{NPC||Taoshi}} take off toward [[Dusklight Hollow]] to get closer to the {{NPC||Sha of Hatred}}. It made it through first, though, as the hollow has been destroyed and what's left of the defenders are all down at the [[Dusklight Bridge]] trying to fend off another [[mantid]] swarm.

After pushing the mantid back in to the [[Dread Wastes]] across the [[Dusklight Bridge]], Taran Zhu adds {{NPC||Lao-Chin the Iron Belly}} to the party as they move forward to [[Rensai's Watchpost]], intent on adding {{NPC||Hawkmaster Nurong}} to finish off the sha-hunting party.

This concludes the main {{NPC||Sha of Hatred}} storyline. Just north of [[Sik'vess]] is the [[Shado-Pan Garrison]], which has a flight path and starts Tai Ho's Investigation. In addition, [[The Threat in the South]] opens up from [[Taoshi]] which serves as a breadcrumb towards [[Dread Wastes]].

==Dailies==
Two sets of level-90 daily quests are offered in Townlong. One set, involving the [[Shado-Pan]] at the [[Shado-Pan Garrison]], is offered daily. The other set, involving [[Niuzao Temple]], is not offered every day--only one of the four [[August Celestials]] temples will be questable each day.
