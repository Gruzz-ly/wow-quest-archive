==Objectives==
Bring the Shado-Pan Crossbow Bolt Bundle to [[Hawkmaster Nurong]].
*[[Shado-Pan Crossbow Bolt Bundle]] (provided)

==Description==
<Name>, take these crossbow bolts and then bring them to Hakmaster Nurong at [[Farwatch Overlook]] to the southwest.

Nurong is praised among all the Wukao for being a flawless shot. His efforts are credited with holding the line here for these many months. I'm hoping you can work with him and judge for yourself. He may be the final [[Shado-Pan]] we need for the hunt.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 XP
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Another wave of fliers approaches. Be ready.

==Completion==
There's a lot of movement on the other side of the chasm... something big is coming.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Grounded Welcome]] before heading out.

Exit from the watchpost to the southwest and follow the path to reach the [[Farwatch Overlook]]. There, [[Marksman Ye]] offers [[Choking the Skies]]. Pick it up before getting started killing. Also, look for [[Hawkmaster Nurong]] up on a hill overlooking both the overlook and the ravine far below.

On approach:
:{{Text|say|Hawkmaster Nurong|<Class>, up here! I could use a hand!}}
Turn in In Skilled Hands and pick up [[Hostile Skies]].
