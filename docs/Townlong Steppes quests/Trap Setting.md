==Objectives==
Rearm 8 Shado-Pan Spike Traps.
*Rearm [[Shado-Pan Spike Trap]]s (8)

==Description==
Good to meet you, <class>. We have traps all along [[Shallowstep Pass|the pass]] to help us catch [[mantid]] that might be sneaking through, but their numbers have been so great that most of the traps have already been triggered.

[[Taoshi]] said you might be able to reset some of them while you're out there. Can you help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
These traps have been very effective, the mantid numbers are just getting out of hand in these past weeks.

==Completion==
We could use a few more capable <men/women> like you around the camp. Thank you for your help, <class>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Breach in the Defenses (Townlong Steppes)]] and [[The Restless Watch]] before heading out.

Toss flares to see the stealthed [[Krik'thik Scentlayer]]s, who will not aggro unless they take damage. Keep an eye out for spike traps on the ground and reactivate them. Feel free to kite scentlayers onto activated traps for a nice surprise!

Scout Wei-Chin can be found right next to the wall in the northeast part of the pass, just north of east of the questgivers. Maybe a hundred yards to the southwest in the blue grass on a small rise is [[Scout Long]]. Head southeast to the wall corner to find [[Scout Ying]] near a small monument. Finally, head west to find Scout Jai-gan, overlooking the sha-corrupted path into the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]].

Head back to the entrance of the [[Gao-Ran Battlefront]] to turn in.
