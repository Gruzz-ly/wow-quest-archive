==Objectives==
Speak with [[Ogo the Younger]] at [[Niuzao Temple]] in the [[Townlong Steppes]].

==Description==
[[Niuzao]], the Black Ox, rests in the temple to the west. He may know why the [[mantid]] are attacking.

He may, in fact, know much more than that.

I will rendezvous with you at Niuzao Temple, <class>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Completion==
Your [[Shado-Pan]] associate has spoken with me. Yes, Niuzao knows why the mantid are attacking. But he is not ready to tell you.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|Something is happening with the mantid... and I suspect it has to do with that temple across the bridge.}}
:{{text|say|Tai Ho|I will rendezvous with you at Niuzao Temple, <name>. Our investigation isn't nearly over yet...}}
Cross the bridge to the northwest of the garrison to reach [[Niuzao Temple]]. Immediately on the opposite side of the bridge, however, is [[Ku-Mo]], who offers [[My Father's Crossbow]]. Swing southwest around the temple to acquire the crossbow, then head into the temple proper.

Ignore the [[Sra'thik Swiftclaw|Sra'thik swiftclaws]] and [[Sra'thik Warcaller|warcallers]] &mdash; the [[Niuzao Sentinel|Niuzao sentinels]] have them in check &mdash; run through the central courtyard and up the southwest stair to find [[Ogo the Elder]], [[Ogo the Younger]] and [[Tai Ho]] having a war conference.

Nearby, Bluesaddle offers a side quest: [[Bad Yak]].
