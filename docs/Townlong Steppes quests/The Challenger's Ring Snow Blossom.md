Challenge [[Snow Blossom]] and defeat her in the Challenger's Ring.
*Challenge Snow Blossom
*Defeat Snow Blossom

==Description==
News of your feats has been traveling around [[Shado-Pan Garrison|the camp]], <name>.

In fact, Snow Blossom would like to test your skill in battle.

You had best prepare yourself, <class>. She is not easily defeated.

If you can prove your worth to her, you will win a valuable friend.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5x [[Valor Points]]
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
How did it go?

==Completion==
Ahhhh, so you bested Snow Blossom in battle, did you?

She will be stinging from that loss for a while, I'd wager.

However, you have done well to win her to your side.

She does not warm to strangers quickly, but through time, she will prove to be a loyal and dependable companion.

==Notes==
Head just behind Ben and speak with Snow Blossom:
:{{gossip|Shall we meet in the Challenger's Ring?}}
:{{text|say|Snow Blossom|Are you really as strong as the others say? I will test you myself in the challenger's ring.}}
She is a level 90 pandaren with 630,000 health and acts as a frost mage with the following abilities:  [[Frostbolt]] (~27,000-30,000 Frost), [[Cone of Cold]] (~7500 Frost), [[Frost Nova]] (~7000 Frost), [[Frost Armor]], [[Arcane Intellect]], [[Summon Water Elemental]], [[Polymorph|Polymorph: Sheep]], [[Blink]], and [[Ice Block]]. Her level 90 water elemental has 196,000 health.

Speak with her again at the ring:
:{{gossip|I challenge you!}}
:{{text|say|Snow Blossom|I accept your challenge!}}
:{{text|say|Snow Blossom|I promise this won't hurt... too much.}}
Defeat her:
:{{text|say|Snow Blossom|What!?!? I lost!?!?}}
:{{text|say|Snow Blossom|You are as strong as they say, especially considering you defeated ME. Well fought.}}
:{{text|say|Snow Blossom|I need no further convincing. If you need me, I will be waiting on the hill behind the tents.}}
