==Objectives==
[[File:Gushing Mist.jpg|thumb|Gushing Mist]]
Obtain 8 Gushing Mists by walking through mist geysers in the [[Upper Sumprushes]].
*Gushing Mist Collected (8)

==Description==
I knew death would come. I did not know that it would come this fast.

I must buy time. The mist of the Upper Sumprushes is warm and fragrant. Such mist is nutritive to my kind.

Gather this mist however you can... in jars, in vials, within the interior of your bags. Bring it back to me, and I can use it to remain corporeal for a bit longer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I require more mist. I am fading...

==Completion==
I told you earlier, this wound would be my death. While you have bought me a bit more time, it is not long now.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Golgoss Hungers]] and [[Arconiss Thirsts]] before heading out.

Back up to the Upper Sumprushes. Mist geysers are small white clouds appearing every few seconds on the water. Kill beavers and loot snarlvine.

==Progression==
{{Lower Sumprushes}}
