==Objectives==
[[File:Loose Brick.jpg|thumb|Loose Brick]]
Throw 10 Loose Stones up to [[Niuzao Stonemason]]s.
*Loose Brick (10)

==Description==
[[Niuzao]]'s appearance on the battlefield is a blessing... in more ways than one.

With the distraction that he's caused, our stonemasons have seized the opportunity to build up our crumbling walls. They could use your help.

Toss any loose bricks you find up their way. And hurry! Niuzao will not rampage forever.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Completion==
It looks like the walls are beginning to take shape again. In time, the Temple will be whole again.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Siege Swells]], [[The Big Guns]], and [[The Overwhelming Swarm]] before getting started.

==Progression==
