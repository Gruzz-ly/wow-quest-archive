==Objectives==
Defeat Norvakess, the Terror of the [[Dread Wastes]].
*[[Norvakess]] slain {{co|74.2|87.5|Townlong Steppes}}

==Description==
That thing is huge!

The [[Shado-Pan]] holding the [[Gao-Ran Battlefront|blockade]] were never trained for something like this... let's get down there and take it out ourselves.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Item level 442 rings|Gao-Ran Ring|Band of Terror|Seal of Taran Zhu|Ring of Norvakess|Battlefront Band}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
I've never seen anything like this...

==Completion==
You. You're coming with me.

I've never seen someone handle themselves on the battlefield like that. I need a strong <class> like you with me when we face the {{NPC||Sha of Hatred}}.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Ready when you are, <name>.}}
She joins the party. Run out and take it on!

[[Norvakess]] is an elite [[kyparite worm]] with the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Resonating Pulse|range=8|notes=4 sec cast}}
Nothing special to worry about—it just has a lot of health. Stay out of the resonating pulses.

On death:
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Let's meet back up with Lord Zhu. There's nothing more we can do here.}}

This completes the "On Hatred's Path" portion of [[One Steppe Forward, Two Steppes Back]].

==Progression==
{{Gao-Ran Battlefront}}
