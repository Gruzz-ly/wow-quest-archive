==Objectives==
Find [[Suna Silentstrike]].
*Find Suna Silentstrike {{co|84.1|70.5|Townlong Steppes}}
*[[Totem of Harmony (quest item)#The Point of No Return]] (provided)

==Description==
One of our [[ranger]]s reported seeing Suna up the hill to the northwest.

I am relieved to find her safe. I had feared what she would do in her grief.

Would you go speak to her on my behalf?

Take this totem with you. If you encounter any danger along the way, you may find it useful.

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11}}
* 196000 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
If I could change the past, I would. If I could take [[Lin Silentstrike|Lin]]'s place, I would.

In a thousand lifetimes, I will never be able to repay Suna's loss, or share even a measure of her grief.

==Completion==
What? She was possessed by the [[Sha of Hatred]]?

No. NO!

Despite our differences, she was one of us. Today, the [[Shado-Pan]] has lost a dear sister.

Her death will not be in vain. I will not rest until I have defeated the Sha of Hatred!

Suna, I swear this to you!

==Notes==

Suna can be found back at the "northwest" spot where her things were at for [[Last Toll of the Yaungol]], inside the tent. She is a level 89 pandaren with 1,634,000 health.

:{{text|yell|Sha of Hatred|Ahahaha... you pitiful weaklings!}}
:{{text|yell|Sha of Hatred|Even your strongest warriors succumb like lambs to the slaughter.}}
