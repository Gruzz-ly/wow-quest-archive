==Objectives==
Collect 1000 Ancient Arcane Powder.
*[[Ancient Arcane Powder]] (1000)

==Description==
Ah, just the <class> I wanted to see!

We've finally figured out why the portal is not working. We need more arcane powder!

It would take us months to get a shipment sent out to us, but luckily, the [[mogu]] on [[Shan'ze Dao|this island]] carry plenty for their own spells.

They tend to use some older stuff, so we're going to need a lot of it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]
*5x [[Valor Points]]

==Progress==
Did you find the powders?

==Completion==
Excellent! Excellent!

This is just the stuff, <name>.

We'll get to work right away. I have no doubt we'll be done very soon.

==Notes==
Up at [[Shan'ze Dao]], inside the small cave on the southeast side of the island, [[Moshu the Arcane]] and two [[Omnia Mage]]s are trying to open up a portal to the [[Shado-Pan Garrison]]. Pick up this side quest when sent up in that direction for dailies.

Mogu drop the dust in quantities of 50-100, the full-health sprites drop around a dozen units each.

==Progression==
{{Shado-Pan Garrison dailies}}
