==Objectives==
[[File:Niuzao Catacombs path.jpg|thumb|Path to the Niuzao Catacombs]]
[[File:Niuzao Catacombs mouth.jpg|thumb|Mouth of the Niuzao Catacombs]]
Kill 12 Dreadlings within the [[Niuzao Catacombs]].
*[[Dreadling]] slain (12)

==Description==
You now know Niuzao's secret. We are not only the wardens of [[Niuzao Temple|this temple]]... we were the wardens of the [[Sha of Fear]] that was buried beneath it.

The Sha itself may have escaped... but it left traces behind. If you're truly going down into the catacombs, you should eliminate those traces, before they escape and cause greater problems than those we already face.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Even among our own order, only a few chosen elders know of our sacred duty to contain the Sha of Fear.

Why they chose to tell the yak-keeper, I may never know.

==Completion==
We already have [[mantid]], [[mogu]], and [[yaungol]] to worry about. This [[sha]] problem needs to be nipped in the bud before we are overrun.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Terrible Truth]] and [[Give Them Peace]] before heading out.

Exit the temple to the north and turn left, heading southwest. Along the edge of the cliff are a few banners and a trail that circles back to the southeast under the cliff to enter the [[Niuzao Catacombs]].

[[Fear-Stricken Sentinel]]s litter the ground. Interact with them to flip them on their stomachs. [[Dreadling]]s are also all over the catacombs. Near the back of the catacombs is the [[Ghastly Confines]]. Find it to complete the "Investigate" step of The Terrible Truth. Inside the ghastly confines is the [[Dread Shadow]]. See its article for tactics. [[Tai Ho]] is in the room with the dread shadow, so turn in The Terrible Truth to him. Kill a path back out of the crypts and turn in up top at the temple.
