==Objectives==
Kill 6 Osul Sharphorns.
*[[Osul Sharphorn]] slain (6)

==Description==
Now that we have had time to assess our enemies' weaknesses, it is time for us to deal the [[yaungol]] a direct blow.

Go and confront the Osul Sharphorn up the mesa to the west.

Let them know that we are here, and that we are not scared of their threats.

You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Day and night, the plains ring with the sound of their barbarian rituals.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. I hope you showed those cretins no mercy.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Running Rampant]] and [[Perfect Pitch]] before heading out.

On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|<Name>, there is a situation to the south that requires my immediate attention.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|When you are finished with your duties, report to [[Ban Bearheart]]. I am leaving him in command for the duration of the mission here.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|I will see you soon.}}
:''He and [[Taoshi]] walk away.''
Cross over to the northwest to reach [[Fire Camp Osul]]. Start killing yaungol, scaring yaks and mushan, and looting Pitch Pots for Dark Pitch. Yaungol, when trampled, take an additional 50% damage.

Ban Bearheart can be found at the southwest end of Fire camp Osul on the high bluff near the oil derrick alongside Suna. They are having a conversation:
:{{text|say|Suna Silentstrike|We should attack them now, Ban, while their eyes are set upon the gates of Kun-Lai.}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|Lord Taran Zhu just departed with the majority of our soldiers. Attacking now would be foolish.}}
:{{text|say|Suna Silentstrike|Have you forgotten that they are holding my husband prisoner? Time is running out!}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|Patience, Suna. I share your desire to stop the yaungol. But I must consider every soldier, not just your husband.}}
:{{text|say|Suna Silentstrike|Tcha! Why did Taran leave you in charge? You would have us cower in our bedsheets until the yaungol break down our very doors!}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|Lower your voice. It's no wonder Taran did not pick you for command. You take too many risks.}}
:{{text|say|Suna Silentstrike|But Lin is down there!}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|We will save him, Suna. I promise.}}
