==Objectives==
Kill any 15 non-elite [[mantid]] near [[Sra'vess]].
*Lesser [[Sra'thik swarm|Sra'thik mantid]] slain (15)

==Description==
The mantid outnumber us quite badly. Hundreds of them for each of us.

And, they surround us on two sides - at [[Gao-Ran Battlefront|Gao-Ran]] in the south we're holding them off, but to the west, on the island they call Sra'vess, they continue to mass unabated.

We're not stupid. We're not going to launch a full scale attack on them. We can't sustain an intense battle on multiple fronts.

Instead, we're going to send you, and one of our Wu Kao, to do some dirty work. Sounds fun, doesn't it?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
The mission isn't complete, <name>.

==Completion==
Good work. I think it's always best to strike while they're unprepared.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ling of the Six Pools|Here, take these supplies. You'll need them for your missions.}}
Pick up [[The Bigger They Come...]], [[A Morale Victory]], and [[Destroy the Siege Weapons!]] before heading out. Also, pick up the Bag of Wu Kao Supplies by her feet. Don't forget to speak to a friendly NPC for a battle companion before leaving the garrison.

Get to [[Sra'vess]]. On the island, adventurers are provided with an Assassin's Shroud, which puts the adventurer in stealth. The supply bag had 10x[[Shiny Shado-Pan Coin]] and 6x[[Wu-Kao Dart of Lethargy]] inside, which can be used while under the quest stealth.

The two northern siege weapons are at the [[Sra'thik Swarmdock]] on the northeast side of the island. As is the {{NPC||Sra'thik Swarm-Leader}}. And the Eastern Idol.

On the southeast side of the island is the [[Kzzok Warcamp]], which has both of the southern siege weapons. The southern idol is just west of the camp, where the mantid are cutting down trees.

The central idol is due north of the southern idol, across the lake near the [[kypari]] tree itself on its southern side. Finally, the western idol is just south of the [[Ikz'ka Ridge]], which is the northwest corner of the island.

The elites patrol the roads with two non-elites. Pull them to a cleared area to fight them. Don't forget about using the dart to sap one of the three! The {{NPC||Sra'thik Swarmlord}} does NOT count for the elite-killing quest, so keep that in mind.
