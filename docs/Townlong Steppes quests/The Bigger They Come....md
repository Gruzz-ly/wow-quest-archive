==Objectives==
Kill any 4 elite [[mantid]] at [[Sra'vess]].
*Greater [[Sra'thik swarm|Sra'thik mantid]] slain (4)

==Description==
Killing the smaller mantid works mostly as a distraction. It forces them to replenish their numbers before they consider any serious offensive.

The big ones, though - we kill a few of those, and we really disrupt operations on the island. That buys ourselves a substantial amount of time. With mantid, it's like their size is directly proportional to their importance in the empire.

So kill some of the big ones for me, while you're out there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
I don't think you're done yet.

==Completion==
Well done, well done. That should keep us safe for a few days, at least.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ling of the Six Pools|Here, take these supplies. You'll need them for your missions.}}
Pick up [[Sra'vess Wetwork]], [[A Morale Victory]], and [[Destroy the Siege Weapons!]] before heading out. Also, pick up the Bag of Wu Kao Supplies by her feet. Don't forget to speak to a friendly NPC for a battle companion before leaving the garrison.

Get to [[Sra'vess]]. On the island, adventurers are provided with an Assassin's Shroud, which puts the adventurer in stealth. The supply bag had 10x[[Shiny Shado-Pan Coin]] and 6x[[Wu-Kao Dart of Lethargy]] inside, which can be used while under the quest stealth.

The two northern siege weapons are at the [[Sra'thik Swarmdock]] on the northeast side of the island. As is the [[Sra'thik Swarm-Leader]]. And the Eastern Idol.

On the southeast side of the island is the [[Kzzok Warcamp]], which has both of the southern siege weapons. The southern idol is just west of the camp, where the mantid are cutting down trees.

The central idol is due north of the southern idol, across the lake near the [[kypari]] tree itself on its southern side. Finally, the western idol is just south of the [[Ikz'ka Ridge]], which is the northwest corner of the island.

The elites patrol the roads with two non-elites. Pull them to a cleared area to fight them. Don't forget about using the dart to sap one of the three! The [[Sra'thik Swarmlord]] does NOT count for the elite-killing quest, so keep that in mind.
