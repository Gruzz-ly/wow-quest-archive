Obtain 6 Mist-Shaman's Torches.
*[[Mist-Shaman's Torch]] x6

== Description ==
Until recently, the [[yaungol]] shaman would come here to work alongside us. Now, they bend [[mistlurker|my people]] to their will.

If we refuse, they kill us. Even if we oblige... they kill us.

The yaungol mist-shaman's magic flows through his torch. Take his torch away, and he has nothing.

== Rewards ==

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11}}
* 196000 XP

== Progress ==
I can use these torches in my revenge.

I have not succumbed to this wound yet. I can still have my revenge before I die.

There is time yet.

== Completion ==
This torch... the yaungol once used these to communicate with me, with my people.

Now, they use them to undo us.

== Notes ==
Head out into the swamp and start killing shaman. Interact with their totem on the ground once dead to loot it.
