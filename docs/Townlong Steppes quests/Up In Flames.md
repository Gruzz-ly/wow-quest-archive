==Objectives==
[[File:Kor'thik Timberhusk.jpg|thumb|[[Kor'thik Timberhusk]].]]
[[File:Keg Bomb (Townlong Steppes).jpg|thumb|Keg Bomb]]
Kill 10 Kor'thik Timberhusks with the aid of Lao-Chin's kegs.
*[[Kor'thik Timberhusk]] slain (10)

==Description==
The [[mantid]] coming across [[Dusklight Bridge|the bridge]] have thick carapaces that shrug off most of our attacks. They have a weakness though: fire.

{{NPC||Lao-Chin the Iron Belly||Lao-Chin's}} men brought kegs to the battlefield for exactly this purpose. Kick the kegs into groups of mantid, and Lao-Chin's archers will light them up.

They should be easy to finish off from there.

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Creative solution.  Lao-Chin impresses.

==Completion==
We have the added benefit that the mantid will leave with broken morale after watching their brethren burn to death. Grim, but many lives will be spared if they simply stop pressing our lines.

==Notes==
Get behind a keg and put it between you and mantid within 30 yards or so, then click on it. Properly aimed, it will roll to a mantid or two then blow up, taking off the Timberhusk - "A tough wood-like carapace that reduces damage taken by 60%. Broken by Fire damage." -  and doing some Fire damage. Help kill them to get quest credit.

==Progression==
