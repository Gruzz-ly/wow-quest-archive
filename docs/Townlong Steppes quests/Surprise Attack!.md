[[File:Hei Feng.jpg|thumb|[[Hei Feng]].]]
Meet up with [[Ban Bearheart]] outside [[Niuzao Temple]] in [[Townlong Steppes]], and put a stop to the Mogu Invasion there.
*Join the Battle at Niuzao Temple {{co|42.6|63.9|Townlong Steppes}}
*Defeat the Mogu Invasion

==Description==
Those damnable mogu...

Those scouts were a distraction! While we were hunting their spies, the main force moved on Niuzao Temple. Corrupted [[cloud serpent|serpents]], Mogu everywhere... this is a disaster!

Thankfully, Ban was able to make it past their lines with the most elite members of our order. If you can slip past, too, meet up with him. We need to put a stop to this!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|34|20}}
*353000 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]
*[[Reins of the Onyx Cloud Serpent]]

==Completion==
Niuzao has been saved. The mogu pushed back. And you, friend, have been found worthy of a great honor.

We shall induct you into the [[Shado-Pan]].

==Notes==
Cross the bridge to [[Niuzao Temple]] to find [[Ban Bearheart]] leading all of the rest of the named [[Shado-Pan]] that were at the garrison. Speak with him:
:Niuzao... we must save him!
:{{gossip|Alright. Let's go.}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|The mogu are attacking the temple!}}
:{{text|say|Yalia Sagewhisper|The temple must not fall!}}
:{{text|say|Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|Quickly, everyone to arms!}}
:''The Shado-Pan run to [[Niuzao]], who is in the center of the courtyard, and set up between him and [[Shan Bu]].''
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Ahahaha, the great Niuzao, strength of the west, divine celestial, protector of the weak...}}
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Your charge, the [[Sha of Fear|sha of fear]] has escaped.}}
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|The [[mantid]] besiege you from all sides.}}
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|You wield the powers of a god, but you are beaten!}}
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|You bear the burden of an entire people upon your shoulders. And how have they repaid you?}}
:{{Text|yell|Shan Bu|You are forgotten. This is what you fear, is it not?}}
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Lay your duties aside and rest.}}
:{{text|yell|Niuzao|I will NEVER yield!}}
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|When you are dying, beast, remember that I gave you a choice.}}
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Shan-ze! Hei Feng! Kill him!}}
Dozens upon dozens of [[Shan'ze Brutalizer]]s stream in, focused on Niuzao but picked up by the NPCs. They have no special moves to be aware of. [[Hei Feng]] is circling the courtyard, taking potshots with Shadow Detonation:
*{{abilities|Shadow Detonation|range=500|Shoots a bolt of shadowy energy that explodes on impact.|notes=Instant. Hits for 35,000-38,000 Shadow}}
The bolt has a few seconds of travel time and the ground is lit up with a red circle indicating the area of effect. The bolt hits friendly and enemy units alike, so take advantage of that, as the Shado-Pan have healers in the raid, whereas the mogu do not.

During the inital 2-and-a-half minutes of combat, the members of the Shado-Pan will yell out at random:
*{{text|yell|Ban Bearheart|Believe in your own strength!}}
*{{text|yell|Ban Bearheart|Drive them back!}}
*{{text|yell|Ban Bearheart|Do not give up!}}
*{{text|yell|Taoshi|We will not allow this to come to pass!}}
*{{text|yell|Hawkmaster Nurong|We will not allow this to come to pass!}}
*{{text|yell|Protector Yi|Perseverance! Victory is in our grasp!}}
*{{text|yell|Protector Yi|You will not defeat us.}}
*{{text|yell|Chao the Voice|Destroy them!}}
*{{text|yell|Chao the Voice|I don't think so.}}
*{{text|yell|Chao the Voice|They are falling! Don't stop now!}}
*{{text|yell|Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|We will not allow this to come to pass!}}
*{{text|yell|Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|There is no way your getting pass us!}}
*{{text|yell|Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|Crossing the Shado-Pan was a bad idea!}}
*{{text|yell|Fei Li|They're not going to get away with this!}}
*{{text|yell|Fei Li|Time to light some fires!}}
*{{text|yell|Fei Li|Hey, over my dead body!}}
*{{text|yell|Fei Li|Drive them back!}}
*{{text|yell|Snow Blossom|Do not let them pass!}}
*{{text|yell|Snow Blossom|For Niuzao!}}
*{{text|yell|Yalia Sagewhisper|We will not yield!}}
*{{text|yell|Yalia Sagewhisper|Drive them back!}}
*{{text|yell|Yalia Sagewhisper|We must stand together!}}
*{{text|yell|Yalia Sagewhisper|You will not succeed! The Shado-Pan will stop you!}}
At 2:10:
:{{text|bossemote|Hei Feng prepares to land!}}
At 2:30:
:{{text|bossemote|Hei Feng is landing!}}
:{{text|yell|Hei Feng|The storm will consume you!}}
:{{text|yell|Protector Yi|You will not defeat us.}}
:{{text|yell|Hei Feng|I shall show you TRUE strength!}}
Hei Feng, a level 93 elite cloud serpent with 8,722,740 health, lands and joins the fight with the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Serpent Sweep|notes=2.5 sec cast. Hits for ~9,000 Physical on cloth and knocks affected units up and back.}}
*{{abilities|Deep Breath|range=500|notes=4 sec cast. Triggers...}}
**{{abilities|Deep Breath Effect|range=500|notes=Instant. Ticks for 29,000-30,000 Fire every 2 sec to units in a frontal cone.}}
Also telegraphed by a bossemote/yell:
:{{text|bossemote|Hei Feng takes a Deep Breath! Move behind him!}}
:{{text|yell|Hei Feng|You cannot escape the storm.}}
Finish off the last of the brutalizers, as there are going to be a few up when Hei Feng lands. Get out from in front of Hei Feng when prompted, step a few yards back to avoid the Serpent Sweep, but otherwise just let the NPCs tank and heal.

Finish him off:
:{{text|yell|Hei Feng|No, NO!}}
:{{text|yell|Hei Feng|Master, I have failed you...}}
:''Hei Feng dies.''
:{{text|yell|Niuzao|Thank you, <name>. You have saved us all.}}
:{{text|yell|Niuzao|Remember, it is at the darkest moment that light shines the brightest.}}
:{{text|yell|Niuzao|Well done, heroes.}}
Return to Ban back at the garrison.
