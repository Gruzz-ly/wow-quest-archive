==Objectives==
Defeat 4 Sra'thik Kunchong.
*[[Sra'thik Kunchong]] slain (4)

==Description==
I command the [[Niuzao Sentinel|sentinels of Niuzao]]. Every defender out there can hold his own against the [[mantid]] swarm.

The [[kunchong]], however, are something different.

They are massive, violent, and without a question the biggest threat to my sentinels' lives. Only [[Niuzao]] stands a chance against them. Niuzao... and perhaps you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
Stay stalwart, <race>. The kunchong would have their way with you.

==Completion==
Put on our armor, and you'd be indistinguishable from any of the other sentinels out there.

Good fighting, <race>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Siege Swells]], [[The Big Guns]], and [[In Battle's Shadow]] before getting started.

==Progression==
