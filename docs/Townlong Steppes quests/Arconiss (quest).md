Summon Arconiss by planting the Mist-Shaman's Torches into the [[Peat Mound]] in the [[Upper Sumprushes]].
*Summon [[Arconiss]] {{co|71.5|72.3|Townlong Steppes}}
*[[Stack of Torches]] (provided)

==Description==
If I am to fight [[Jahesh of Osul|Jahesh]], leader of the [[yaungol]] mist-shaman, I must have Arconiss by my side. Arconiss' ferocity is second to none.

He rests beneath the mists of the Upper Sumprushes. Find his resting place, and then use these torches to awaken him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
* 196000 XP

==Progress==
Arconiss' size belies his prowess in battle. He will be an asset.

==Completion==
It will be difficult to lose with Arconiss by my side.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Golgoss (quest)]] before heading out.

Head back up the ramp to the east to the [[Upper Sumprushes]]. On the first island is the [[Peat Clump]]. Plant the torches. An [[Osul Mistbreaker]] will spawn, aggroed on Golgoss. Take it out. Another will spawn, so kill it. After that, at least a dozen weak [[Small Swamp Rodent]]s will spawn. Use area of effect abilities to take them out. Finally, one last mistbreaker spawns. Once it's dead, Golgoss awakens:
:{{text|say|Gol... goss...}}
He lumbers over in the direction of Orbiss.

The [[Peat Mound]] is on the island just southwest of the big island in the center of the upper swamp. The same pattern of mobs will attack Arconiss - mistbreaker, mistbreaker, rodent swarm, mistbreaker.
:{{text|say|Arconiss|Must fight Osul now. Must stop hatred.}}
Take them all out then head back to Orbiss.

==Progression==
{{Lower Sumprushes}}
