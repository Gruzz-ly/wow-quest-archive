'''Mogu Incursions''' is a quest that becomes available at {{rep|exalted}} reputation with the [[Shado-Pan]].

==Objectives==
[[File:Shan'ze Spymaster.jpg|thumb|[[Shan'ze Spymaster]].]]
[[File:Shan'ze Infiltrator.jpg|thumb|[[Shan'ze Infiltrator]].]]
Find and kill the Shan'ze Spymaster.
*[[Shan'ze Spymaster]] slain {{co|48.8|58.6|Townlong Steppes}}

==Description==
We've heard reports of a group of mogu infiltrating the coast here in [[Townlong Steppes|Townlong]]. I have no idea what they are doing. Frankly, I don't care.

You've proven yourself, so we've decided to give this mission to you.

What's going to happen is this - you're going to go, find them, and kill them.

Our scouts reported the first group landed to the north, between here and [[Deadtalker's Plateau]]. Go there and wipe them out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|92|50}}
*118000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Why aren't they dead already?

==Completion==
It was just a decoy! They've moved to attack Niuzao Temple!

==Notes==
Head north along the path to [[Deadtalker's Plateau]]. At {{co|48.8|58.6|Townlong Steppes}} on a small bluff overlooking [[Westersea]] is a [[Shan'ze Spymaster]] and two [[Shan'ze Infiltrator]], all level 90 mogu with 393,000 health. Aggro them:
:{{text|say|Shan'ze Spymaster|The [[Shado-Pan]] sends a lackey to do their work? Perhaps [[Shan Bu]] was wrong about them...}}
Nothing too special about the mobs--the spymaster will [[Shadowstep]] and [[Backstab]], but that's about it.

Job done, head back to the [[Shado-Pan Garrison]]. [[Shan'ze Invader]]s are storming the bridge between the Shado-Pan Garrison and [[Niuzao Temple]], with air support from [[Shan'ze Cloudrider]]s!

==Progression==
{{Shado-Pan finale}}
