==Objectives==
Report in to [[Taran Zhu]] at the [[Gao-Ran Battlefront]].

==Description==
I still have some cleanup to do here in [[Shallowstep Pass|the pass]] - there are some [[mantid]] still making it through. You're a valuable person to have at hand though, and I know Taran wouldn't appreciate me keeping you longer for such basic work.

Taran should still be in the main camp with [[Gao-Ran the Tempered|Gao-Ran]]. Report back in. I'll catch up with you a bit later.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|75}}
*49000 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Completion==
Welcome back. I heard about the breaches in the eastern pass. It sounds like I put the right people on the job.

==Progression==
{{Gao-Ran Battlefront}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
