Destroy the four mantid siege weapons at [[Sra'vess]] in [[Townlong Steppes]].
*Large Southern Siege Weapon destroyed
*Small Southern Siege Weapon destroyed
*Large Northern Siege Weapon destroyed
*Small Northern Siege Weapon destroyed

==Description==
The mantid don't just attack in swarms.

They're smart. They use alchemy, bombs... and what's worst, they've got [[siege weapon]]s. Those have the potential to be incredibly destructive if they attack with them.

We've got reports that they're building up a force of siege weapons to the west at Sra'vess. Go and destroy them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
You need to take out those siege weapons, <name>!

==Completion==
Those siege weapons won't be a problem. They may rebuild, but we've bought ourselves some time.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ling of the Six Pools|Here, take these supplies. You'll need them for your missions.}}
Pick up [[Sra'vess Wetwork]], [[The Bigger They Come...]], and [[A Morale Victory]] before heading out. Also, pick up the Bag of Wu Kao Supplies by her feet. Don't forget to speak to a friendly NPC for a battle companion before leaving the garrison.

Get to [[Sra'vess]]. On the island, adventurers are provided with an Assassin's Shroud, which puts the adventurer in stealth. The supply bag had 10x[[Shiny Shado-Pan Coin]] and 6x[[Wu-Kao Dart of Lethargy]] inside, which can be used while under the quest stealth.

The two northern siege weapons are at the [[Sra'thik Swarmdock]] on the northeast side of the island. As is the [[Sra'thik Swarm-Leader]]. And the Eastern Idol.

On the southeast side of the island is the [[Kzzok Warcamp]], which has both of the southern siege weapons. The southern idol is just west of the camp, where the mantid are cutting down trees.

The central idol is due north of the southern idol, across the lake near the [[kypari]] tree itself on its southern side. Finally, the western idol is just south of the [[Ikz'ka Ridge]], which is the northwest corner of the island.

The elites patrol the roads with two non-elites. Pull them to a cleared area to fight them. Don't forget about using the dart to sap one of the three! The [[Sra'thik Swarmlord]] does NOT count for the elite-killing quest, so keep that in mind.
