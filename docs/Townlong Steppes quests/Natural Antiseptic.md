==Objectives==
Obtain 5 Full Mushan Bladders.
*[[Full Mushan Bladder]] (5)

==Description==
The [[Shado-Pan]] are rare, elite, and quite expensive to train and replace. We can't afford to have any falling to a poisoned weapon or an infected cut. That's why I need you to get... something.

Let me be blunt. Mushan urine is a great, natural antiseptic. They produce a large amount of it, which is lucky... because we tend to use a lot.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
It's messy work, certainly.

Nowhere near as messy as digging graves.

==Completion==
Your messy work may have saved a few lives today, <race>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Field Armorer]] and [[A Proper Poultice]] before heading out. Don't focus on these quests to the exclusion of others&mdash;they're long-term gathering quests. The main chain starts with [[The Motives of the Mantid]] and [[Set the Mantid Back]] from [[Tai Ho]].

Head northeast to the [[Underbough]] to start killing [[Longshadow Mushan]] and [[Rankbite Tortoise]]s and looing Mao-Willows. Bladders are somewhat frequently dropped. Shell fragments drop in quantities of 8-12, and willows are gathered individually.

==Progression==
{{Shado-Pan Garrison}}
