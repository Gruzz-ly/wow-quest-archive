This quest is mutually exclusive with [[Beyond the Wall]]. Only one of the quests may be accepted concurrently.

==Objectives==
Meet up with [[Suna Silentstrike]] at [[Longying Outpost]] in the [[Townlong Steppes]].

==Description==
[[Lin Silentstrike|Lin]]...

I don't care what [[Ban Bearheart|Ban]], [[Lao-Chin the Iron Belly|Lao-Chin]], or even [[Taran Zhu]] says. I'm moving ahead into Townlong. I may not be able to save Lin myself, but I'm not going to sit around waiting for everyone else to catch up.

Once Taran Zhu opens the doors to his precious monastery, we'll save Lin. Until then, I'll scout ahead and make sure he's alright.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|50}}
*98000 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Completion==
Good. Looks like the rest of the Shado-Pan decided it was a good time to catch up.

==Notes==
''On accept:''
: ''Suna stealths and heads for the gate.''
:{{text|say|Suna Silentstrike|I'm going ahead.  I will see you on the other side... I hope.}}

Put this quest on the back burner for two quests ([[Where are My Reinforcements?]] and [[Unbelievable!]]), until players wind up inside the [[Shado-Pan Monastery]]. Run the instance or not, then...

Head south from [[Winter's Blossom]] through the [[Ox Gate]] into [[Townlong Steppes]]. Follow the path south past [[Fire Camp Osul]], mindful of the [[Osul Charger]]s on the path swarming toward [[Longying Outpost]]. [[Longying Defender]]s and [[Longying Archer]]s are guarding the path, so move into the town proper to find [[Suna Silentstrike]] at a bonfire alongside [[Ban Bearheart]], [[Taoshi]], and [[Taran Zhu]].

They are having a conversation:
:{{text|say|Suna Silentstrike|Lord Taran, our foothold here is secure. We should take the first opportunity to attack.}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|I disagree. We cannot underestimate the yaungol's strength.}}
:{{text|say|Suna Silentstrike|We already have them on the defensive. Even as we speak, their numbers weaken.}}
:{{text|say|Ban Bearheart|As do ours. Do you not see the number of our injured? Do you forget how many have been taken prisoner?}}
:{{text|say|Suna Silentstrike|I do not. YOU are the one who forgets my husband is one of the captives.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Settle down, you two. We have much to do, and getting Lin out alive is one of our top priorities.}}

Taran Zhu offers the next quest, [[A Foot in the Door]].
