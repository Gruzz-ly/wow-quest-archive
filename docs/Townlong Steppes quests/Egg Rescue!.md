==Objectives==
[[File:Shiny Egg.jpg|thumb|Shiny Egg]]
Collect 8 Cloudrunner Eggs.
*[[Cloudrunner Egg]] (8)

==Description==
Eggs. Yes, you heard me right. I said eggs, and these aren't for eating.

Have you ever seen a [[cloud serpent]] egg?

These rare eggs look like jewels, and were once worth their weight in solid gold.

[[Shan'ze Dao]] to the north normally teems with wild cloud serpents, but the [[mogu]] and the [[sprite]]s have their eggs on lock-down.

We need to save as many of these precious eggs as we can.

I'm counting on YOU, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Did you find any eggs? The serpents lay their eggs in nests on the beach, but the wood sprites are also known to steal them whenever they can.

==Completion==
Gently, gently!

Thank you for recovering these eggs safely, <name>. I know a few Serpent Riders in the [[Jade Forest]] who will take good care of these.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Mogu Menace]], [[Spiteful Sprites]], and [[Little Hatchlings]] before heading out. Speak to a friendly NPC for a battle companion before leaving the garrison. If not already done, pick up and complete [[Through the Portal]] from [[Moshu the Arcane]] up at [[Shan'ze Dao]] to open up a portal to/from [[Shan'ze Dao]].

At the base camp, head west and start killing sprites. There's a bigger camp on the west side of the island as well. Once that's done, cross back to the east and head down the hill to the cloud strider area. Eggs litter the ground, the hatchlings are caged, and hostile mogu are everywhere.

Turn in all four to the Shado-Pan companion out in the field and pick up [[In Sprite Of Everything]] before heading back to the garrison.
