== Objectives ==
Collect 20 Bronze Claws.
* [[Bronze Claw]] (20)

== Description ==
Among the [[Shan'ze clan|Shan'ze]]'s fiercest and most loyal creations are their [[quilen]].

These beasts will hunt until they kill their prey, or die in the process.

I need you to not only cull their numbers, but also to retrieve their bronze claws.

Their claws are strong and razor sharp, and we can use them to make weapons and hooks for our cause.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}

== Progress ==
The quilen are fierce, but I see fierceness in your eyes as well.

== Completion ==
These claws will come in handy.

Good work, <class>.
