==Objectives==
[[File:Dread Orb.jpg|thumb|Dread Orb.]]
Recover 16 Volatile Dread Orbs from the [[Ambermarsh]].
*[[Volatile Dread Orb]] (16)

==Description==
I've got another job for you.

The dragon cannons we depend on to keep the thicker swathes of [[mantid]] back are running low on ammo. The camp's [[cannoneer]]s developed an improvised explosive that's made from the globe seeds down the western ridge.

They dispatched a couple initiates to bring some back hours ago, but have heard nothing from them. I want to send someone a bit more capable to make sure that this gets taken care of.

Are you my <man/woman> for this?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|
|Mistborne Pantaloons

|Goldtalon Pantaloons
|Swampwalker Pantaloons

|Osul Peak Legguards

|Palewind Pantaloons}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|11}}
*196000 [[XP]]
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Back even more quickly than expected. Did you bring the seeds?

==Completion==
It's good to have a <class> that I can count on.

==Notes==
Head southwest toward the [[Ambermarsh]]. Before actually getting there, however, Initiates [[Initiate Feng|Feng]] and [[Initiate Chao|Chao]] offer [[Thieves and Troublemakers]] and [[In the Wrong Hands]]. Pick them up before descending into the marsh.

Start killing sprites. They stand a chance of dropping orbs, but they mainly can be found near the big amber orbs on trees around the pools. To find the sword, head west out of the main pools area. [[Needlebottom]] can be found in a large depression at the west end of the marsh. He does count for Thieves and Troublemakers, too.
