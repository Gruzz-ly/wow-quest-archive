==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Tenwu of the Red Smoke.jpg|Tenwu of the Red Smoke|A deadly Wu Kao rogue, almost as skilled at bragging as he is at combat.}}
Challenge [[Tenwu of the Red Smoke]], and then defeat him in combat at [[Shado-Pan Garrison]] in [[Townlong Steppes]].
*Challenge Tenwu of the Red Smoke
*Defeat Tenwu of the Red Smoke

==Description==
So... you've been challenged by the infamous Tenwu of the Red Smoke.

That's what he calls himself, at least. He's a good fighter, and a good rogue, but it's a wonder he manages to sneak up on anyone with how loudly he brags about himself.

Anyways, I think you should answer the challenge. Maybe it'll give him a touch of humility. Maybe not. Either way, if you win, he'll probably be willing to go with you on your missions.

And I get some entertainment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Well? How did it go?

==Completion==
Wow! Well done. Glad to see you fought so well.

Maybe if he's trying to keep up with your fighting it'll help keep his mouth shut.

==Notes==
He's right next to Ling.
:Ha! What say you to master swordsman, Tenwu the Red Smoke?
