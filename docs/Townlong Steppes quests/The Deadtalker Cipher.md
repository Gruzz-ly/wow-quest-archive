==Objectives==
Collect a Scroll of Spiritbinding Rites from the [[yaungol]] at [[Deadtalker's Plateau]].
*[[Ciphered Scroll]]

== Description ==
We need to understand what went wrong with the Deadtalkers. For so many years, the Deadtalkers were simply responsible for maintaining the burial grounds and holding funerals for fallen warriors. From a recent raid, we've recovered a tablet from the grounds that is clearly written using a cipher, but it isn't one we've encountered before. If you can gather a ciphered scroll from one of the Deadtalkers, we can begin to put together the cypher and understand what's happened.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 XP
*+250 reputation with [[Shado-Pan]]

==Progress==
Did you find something?

==Completion==
Aha! Show me that.

Hmm... we will send this to the monastery for analysis. As we find which of these symbols are most common in their writing, we can begin to understand the meaning of these writings.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Assault Fire Camp Gai-Cho]], [[Assault Deadtalker's Plateau]], and [[The Enemy of My Enemy... Is Still My Enemy!]] before heading out. Don't forget to grab an NPC helper, either!
