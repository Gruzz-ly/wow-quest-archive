==Objectives==
Meet with [[Kalecgos]] at the [[Mourning Rise]] in the [[Isle of Dorn]].

==Description==
I'm afraid that our "clean up" of [[Dalaran]] extends far from the shores of the Isle of Dorn.

In my attempts to find you, I circled this island many times. During my flight, I sensed the [[magic]] of many familiar items--items that were formerly housed in Dalaran.

Dangerous items.

Someone or something has taken them who knows where. We must find these objects before innocent bystanders come to harm.

Follow me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
We will begin our search here.

I can feel faint arcane auras emanating from around and beneath this structure.

The kobolds must have found and brought them to this place.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|I'll meet you at the Mourning Rise, <name>. I need to--}}
:''Aethas drops to one knee.''
:{{Text|Say|[[Aethas Sunreaver]]|Kalecgos, go. I will be fine.}}
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|Maybe. But I am not leaving that to chance.}}
:''Kalecgos casts a spell creating three mirror images of himself.''
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|Let's go, <name>.}}
:''Kalecgos walks away.''
:{{Text|Say|Aethas Sunreaver|Just like a [[dragon]]... stubborn. And a show off.}}

The first mirror image between the mailbox and tent is a vendor, selling food and drink. The second mirror image near the Cabinet Display has gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Kalecgos|We have made this area safe for us, but we must also make it safe for any artifacts we find.}}

The third mirror image is behind the flying carpet, Scrying for Survivors, and has gossip too:

{{Dialogue|title=Kalecgos|Dalaran's debris may also be keeping us from communicating with surviving members of the Kirin Tor.

Scrying may also be affected, but I have a few tricks up my sleeve.}}

Aethas has gossip too:
{{Dialogue|title=Aethas Sunreaver|I'll be fine, <name>.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:''The display case mirror image of Kalecgos approaches Aethas.''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|What you have told me makes me afraid for you, Aethas.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|Fear isn't part of it. Or... not fear of nerubians or... or even Xal'atath.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Then of what?}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|Of letting everyone we have lost down again. If I slip. If... if I sleep. What then?}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|What horror comes here and takes more of us away?}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I know very little about what has transpired here. But...}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Aethas, none of it was your fault.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|You're a survivor--a victim of this tragedy.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|To continue to fight and then rebuild... that's more than anyone would ask of you.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|And yet, here I am. Still alone. The Kirin Tor...}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|They will come.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|For now, you need rest. Let me put the burden on my wings for awhile.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|Kalecgos, I... thank you.}}

Travel to [[Mourning Rise]] where Kalecgos awaits.
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|The kobolds are definitely hoarding magical items here. I can sense them.}}
