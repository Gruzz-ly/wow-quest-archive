==Objectives==
Meet with [[Adelgonn]], [[Geya'rah]], and [[Turalyon]].

==Description==
The [[stormrook|rooks]] and their chosen riders will need time to bond. 

Perhaps you should use this time to check in on our other trainees. 

The [[Stormriders]] are the traditional army of the [[earthen]], but many [[Unbound]] and [[Oathsworn]] have expressed willingness to fight at our side due to help in restoring their machines.

Adelgonn, Geya'rah, and Turalyon are busy training them. Go and see if they need any assistance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Someone save me from all this bickering. [[Alliance]] this, [[Horde]] that... 

I've never encountered anything like it in my thousands of years even amongst the Oathsworn and Unbound. If they committed half the energy they expend on posturing towards training, our task would be complete by now.

See what help you can offer my people. They need real mentorship if we are to be ready for the next [[nerubian]] offensive.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Thrall|The stormrooks and their new riders need time, and you are needed at the shore, champion.}}

Before leaving, Lufsela has a <Stay awhile and listen.> gossip option:
:{{text|emote|Thrall|Thrall nods to Lufsela with respect.}}
:''Thrall leaves''.
:{{text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|New stormrooks, new riders--we're going to have to start all over.}}
:{{text|say|Olbarig|You won't be alone, Lufsela. I can help you. So can Vokmar, and--}}
:{{text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|But I'm no Stormward, Olbarig. I don't know if I can--}}
:{{text|say|Olbarig|Lufsela... Baelgrim was as stubborn as a ram's arse and twice as shale-headed.}}
:{{text|say|Olbarig|Do you think he knew what he was doing when he took over the Stormperch? No.}}
:{{text|say|Olbarig|He was a good rider, but it took him far longer than you to figure out how to train a stormrook.}}
:{{text|say|Olbarig|Sure, he went through many recharges. But he knew what the titans had done to the rooks was wrong.}}
:{{text|say|Olbarig|We fought about it. That's why I finally left. He wouldn't admit it.}}
:{{text|say|Olbarig|But I realized it didn't matter. The way he called them...}}
:{{text|say|Olbarig|At some point, he changed. More like one of those "shaman." Like Thrall.}}
:{{text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|So he knew, somewhere inside. But he didn't... remember?}}
:{{text|say|Olbarig|Something like that. But you weren't afraid of the truth, Lufsela. And that's why you deserve this.}}
:{{text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|I'm... still not sure I do. But the stormrooks deserve better. And I can give them that.}}

Head southeast down the way to catch up with [[Overlord Geya'rah]], [[Adelgonn]], [[High Exarch Turalyon]], and two [[Mag'har Grunt]]s and [[7th Legion Soldier]]s overlooking the earthen training down on the beach.

On approach, one of:
*{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Feh. Another Alliance lackey here to polish Turalyon's armor.}}
*{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|Great. Yet another of your Horde savages to bark at the recruits.}}

They have gossip:

{{dialogue|title=Overlord Geya'rah|Finally a chance to see more of this world, and kill what threatens it!}}

{{dialogue|title=High Exarch Turalyon|Once again darkness stirs, and once again we rise to meet it. Be it on other shores or other worlds, the Alliance will always answer the call.}}

{{dialogue|title=Adelgonn|The Horde and the Alliance field impressive forces, but if these two are any indication, they have a lot to learn about teamwork. I gather that there is much history, between these two in particular.}}

On the beach, named characters include [[Lilian Voss]], [[Dark Ranger Velonara]], and [[Deathstalker Commander Belmont]], [[Champion Uru'zin]], [[Tahu Sagewind]] and [[Aponi Brightmane]], [[Shuja Grimaxe]], [[Warlord Breka Grimaxe]], [[Gorgonna]], [[Sunwalker Dezco]], [[Kor Dawnchaser]], [[Salandria]] and [[Lady Liadrin]], [[Volt]], [[Officer Herrick]], [[Hagenbran]] and [[Gizwig]], [[Ji Firepaw]] and [[Aysa Cloudsinger]], [[Captain Garrick]] and [[Henry Garrick]], [[Sentinel Commander Lyalia]], [[Tinkmaster Overspark]] and [[Gila Crosswires]], [[Lysander Starshade]] and [[Arko'narin Starshade]], [[Thisalee Crow]] and [[Delas Moonfang]], [[Captain Tread Sparknozzle]].
