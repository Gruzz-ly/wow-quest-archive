==Objectives==
Speak with [[Burkhalt]] in the [[Proscenium]].

==Description==
<Name>, I have learned a lot from watching you perform. You change your nature so easily. In one play, I have seen you change from enemy to friend, from anger to sorrow... It's like watching mercury flow.

With you on our stage, I feel we complete our plays to the letter of our directives with the highest satisfaction for our audience.

If you have a moment, I would like to thank you for your support.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We decided that this was the least we could do to thank you for sharing your experience with us.

I have much more to learn myself. So please, join us for another play.
