==Objectives==
Kill [[Nerubian]] forces at the [[Opalcreg]] in the [[Isle of Dorn]].
* [[Nerubian Skirmisher]] slain (8)
* [[Nerubian Webspinner]] slain (6)

==Description==
I'm a city guard, not a soldier! But these people need our help!

There are too many nerubians for us to clear out. We can only keep this chokepoint and hope the miners make their way to us.

That one was too small. But you look like a fighter. Help us!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We will do what we can to help the miners escape.

==Completion==
Thank you, outlander. You have given them a fighting chance.

==Notes==
Upon approach:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|A nerubian attack? Here?}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Hektare|Stay back, small one! We will do what we can!}}

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Hektare|Go. We can take it from here. You have my thanks.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Good luck, Hektare!}}
