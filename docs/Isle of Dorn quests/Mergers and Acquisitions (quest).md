==Objectives==
Defeat Goldie Baronbottom and help [[Wenbrandt]] reclaim the [[Cinderbrew Meadery]].
* [[Goldie Baronbottom]] slain

==Description==
When the [[nerubian]]s launched their attack on my meadery, they left it a burnt-out husk. [[Adelgonn]] promised to rebuild it, but I got impatient and accepted the [[Venture Co]].'s offer to help with its "restructuring."

But now, it's clear they had their own agenda. Blasted [[goblin]]s have taken over, and they're driving the place into the ground. They've ramped up production to unsafe levels, pushing the [[cinderbee]]s and our equipment to their limits.

Please help fix this, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|93|60}}
* 24,400 [[XP]]

You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Chef Chewie's Towel]]
*[[Strapped Rescue-Keg]]
*[[85-Year Tenure Ring]]

==Progress==
Thinking about those goblins in my meadery... Oh, it makes my head feel molten. And that makes me think of my cinderbrew!

==Completion==
A heartfelt thank you for what you did at the Cinderbrew Meadery.

Driving away Venture Co. was no small feat, but thanks to you, we've reclaimed our beloved meadery and will resume making cinderbrew the right way--the way we've made it for centuries.
