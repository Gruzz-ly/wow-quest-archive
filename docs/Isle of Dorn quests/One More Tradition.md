==Objectives==
Gather 5 ore and 5 Charged cores near [[Fallside Outpost]].
*[[Charged Core]] (5)
*[[Clump of Ore]] (5)

==Description==
Before I shut down, I must craft an item that is meaningful to me. 

As a Stonebound, I worked the mines. I had a lantern I made and used until I lost it in a collapse. I became [[Unbound]] shortly after.

I wish to forge a new lantern to guide my way through these final moments.

The lantern was made of an ore found in small amounts around this area. I used a charged core in the lantern. You can find them in the stormfangs that roam these hills.

Gather the materials, and I will forge the lantern.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you gotten the materials I asked for?

==Completion==
These will do nicely!

Now... hopefully I can remember how to forge a lantern.

==Notes==
Both of them have new gossip before the quest starts:
{{Dialogue|title=Korgran|
I have often walked the path between the outpost and the [[Mourning Rise]] memorial site.

I can recognize the ruts made by my heavy steps. Same as those who came before me.

But as an Unbound, I wanted to be free of traditions that lock me into performing the same duties day to day.

I chose to be a caretaker, but I wish I had wandered the isle more. I didn't really know how much time I had left...

I would much rather shutdown by the ocean southeast of here. There is a lovely spot there I have wandered to often.

Or... Alas, maybe [[Urtago]] is right. I am just a crumbling earthen who is losing their pebbles.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Urtago|
I told Korgran about what you did back in Mourning Rise. It made him happy to hear that the kobolds have been dealt with--at least for now.

He seems very happy, which is kind of worrying for his condition. I hope he doesn't push himself too hard...

We still need to prepare him for his shutdown.

On accept:
:{{Text|say|Korgran|There is one more thing I must do before my shutdown.}}
:{{Text|say|Korgran|An Unbound master of a profession bestows their apprentice with their knowledge and experience.}}
:{{Text|say|Korgran|It is a ceremonial tradition that is rather symbolic than spiritual in nature.}}
:{{Text|say|Korgran|I will set the forge for your return.}}

Collect ores from [[Vein of Ore|Veins of Ore]] around the area and charged cores from slaying [[Great Stormfang]]s and [[Scavenging Stormfang]]s.
