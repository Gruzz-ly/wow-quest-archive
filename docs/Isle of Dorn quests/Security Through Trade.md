==Objectives==
Convince Bevrusi to give you access to the cinderbrew speakeasy.
* Speak to [[Bevrusi]]
* Insist you need the Passrune
* See what Bevrusi will trade

==Description==
If we're to solve this quarrel between [[Steelvein]] and [[Overseer Ardgrin|Ardgrin]] amicably, then we'll need to make some new friends.

One of Ardgrin's employees, [[Obstorn]], frequents a cinderbrew speakeasy here in [[Dornogal]]. Only [[Machine Speakers]] may enter it.

Even as [[Councilward]], I am not able to access it. However, there are others in the city who can.

Bevrusi, a [[Gundargaz]] trader, should be able to give you access. If you can grease her palm, she may be able to supply you access.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 5,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do I know you?

==Completion==
So what do you say, surface-runner? 

You polish my back and I'll polish yours. Do we have a deal?

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Merrix| Bevrusi plies her trade near the Gilded Exchange. She might be willing to trade with you.}}

[[Merrix]] also has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|{{Gossip|Why do you support Steelvein's operations if they defy your Edicts?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
For a moment, you sounded just like Baelgrim.

As you can attest, Steelvein's operations are necessary within Dornogal. They benefit all earthen, above ground and below.

Steelvein's methods may bend the Edicts in ways my councillors{{sic}} disapprove of, but given the turmoil between the [[Unbound]] and the workers in the Deeps, sometimes one must... look the other way.

{{Gossip|I have another question.}}
}}
{{Gossip|Who is Ardgrin and how are they connected to Steelvein?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Overseer Ardrgin manages the shipping tracks down in the Deeps. He ensures the supplies we send to the Machine Speakers are distributed and in turn, the raw materials they process are sent up to us.

It would seem that Ardgrin has--or rather, had--some sort of back alley deal with Steelvein to smuggle up supplies otherwise prohibited by our Edicts.

{{Gossip|I have another question.}}
}}
{{Gossip|Why is Ardgrin interfering with Steelvein's shipments?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
<Merrix hums in thought for a moment.>

I cannot say for sure, but I would imagine it has something to do with the dwindling supplies and raw materials we have been receiving from the Unbound.

Unfortunately, this means sending fewer shipments into the Deeps, despite the trade they continue to send up.

Officially, Dornogal has a mutual trade arrangement with them, so this appears to be a personal grievance...

{{Gossip|I have another question.}}
}}}}

Meet with [[Bevrusi]] near the [[Gilded Exchange]]:
{{Dialogue|quest=|And what are you staring at, surface-runner?

{{Gossip|I'm told you could get me into the private Machine Speaker speakeasy.}}
{{Dialogue-child|<Bevrusi sizes you up and down for a moment before she chuckles.>

I won't lie and say I'm not curious about how you even know about that place.

Still, I can't just give you the passrune to access the speakeasy. It's valuable after all!

But maybe we can trade.

{{Gossip|I don't have time to trade. I need access to that speakeasy.}} 
{{Dialogue-child|And I'm the only one who will even entertain the idea of trading for the passrune to that lounge, so we play by my rules.

Dornogal is full of merchants and peddlers willing to strike a bargain. You bring me what I want, and I'll get you what you need.

Do we have a deal?

{{Gossip|I need time to think about this.}} 
}}

{{Buy|{{Text|rare|(Quest)}} What are you looking to trade?}}
:''Opens up a vendor interface where one can trade a [[Vial of Liquid Opal]] for the [[Speakeasy Passrune]].''
}}}}

After thinking about it:
{{Dialogue|So what do you say, soft one?

You polish my back and I'll polish yours. Find me what I am looking for and I'll get you into that Speakeasy.

{{Gossip|Where can I find liquid opal?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Start your query with Vokgret near the inn. She will know how to acquire liquid opal. She knows how to acquire anything.

Though I suspect she's not likely to hand it over without a trade.

{{Gossip|I understand.}} 
}}

{{Gossip| Tell me about the cinderbrew speakeasy.}}
{{Dialogue-child|The speakeasy is a private lounge for us Machine Speakers. We don't often come to the surface, so many eons ago we were granted our own private space.

We tend to prefer secrecy and being left alone, hence the security golem.

But don't worry. So long as you provide the passrune, the golem won't harm you.

<Bevrusi grins.>

{{Gossip|I understand.}}
