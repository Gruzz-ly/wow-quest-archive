Get to the bottom of the mine and find [[Cenderragg]].
* Parachute equipped (Optional)
* Opalcreg explored

==Description==
A long way down to be sure, but I am certain that you can make it.

If you doubt yourself, I made some parachutes to help you stick the landing.

Once you get to the bottom of the cave, look for Cenderragg. She's the most senior of the group and probably has the best idea on how to rescue the team.

==Completion==
Who are you and why are you here?
