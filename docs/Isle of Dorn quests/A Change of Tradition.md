==Objectives==
Meet [[Urtago]] and [[Korgran]] by the shore.

==Description==
An [[Unbound]] [[earthen]] can't return to the [[Coreway]], so we have [[Mourning Rise]]. But looking at Korgran, remembering our last conversation before...

I may not be the Mourning Rise caretaker just yet, but with Korgran's condition, it falls to me to be in charge.

As Unbound, we made our own rules and traditions. So what if he doesn't want to stand at Mourning Rise? If a seaside memorial is what Caretaker Korgran wants, that's what he gets.

<Name>, meet me at the shore to the southeast of here.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
He enjoyed the walk, but it has taken a heavy toll on him.

Korgran barely recognizes me now.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Urtago|Come Korgran. It is time to go.}}
:{{text|say|Korgran|Who... who are you? Where are we going?}}
:{{text|say|Urtago|It is me, Urtago. We are going to the shore.}}
:{{text|say|Korgran|Oh, do I like the shore?}}
:{{text|say|Urtago|Yes, it is your favorite spot to give yourself time to think.}}
:{{text|say|Korgran|Time...}}
:''They walk off.''

Head to [[Restless Estuary]]. Korgran and Urtago have new gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Korgran|
This place.

The sound of the waves. The sand under my feet. It's bringing together what shards of memories I have left.

But there are so many memories I've lost.

My inception. My first wanderings of this land...

Urtago is right. There is no other place I would rather shutdown than here in the waves.

{{Dialogue|title=Urtago|
Korgran's journey is close to its end.

I need to do a few things to prepare, but I don't want to do any of them.

I keep thinking if I don't, maybe he will be here for longer?

But I know it's time for him to go.
