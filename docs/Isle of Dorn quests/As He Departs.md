==Objectives==
Help [[Urtago]] and [[Korgran]] perform the ceremony.
*Incense placed
*Give the horn to Korgran
*Ceremony concluded

==Description==
It is time for the ceremony, <name>.

Please place the bowl of ashenfolds by Korgran and then hand him the horn.

Once the ceremony concludes, I will be the new caretaker. Then I will have to say a final farewell to my friend.

Korgran will shutdown peacefully, knowing we were here by his side in the place he loved most--something I wish and hope to have when it is my time.

My core is mud, but it is a great honor to stand here with him... and with you.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,400 [[XP]]
*[[Horn of Declaration]]

==Progress==
It is a bittersweet moment.

==Completion==
What an honor it is to be here. To be present at such an event.

You were part of it, and I know that deep inside him, somewhere within Korgran's core, there will always be a living memory of you, <name>.

Thank you.

==Notes==
Place the Incense and give Korgran the horn:

Urtago has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
It is done.

Now is my time to take care and face the upcoming challenges of Mourning Rise.

I will miss Korgran. 

I think this is going to be my new think-through spot when I need a zephyr of fresh air to clear my head. 

Or when I will need a listening ear.

On his lantern hangs a plaque that reads:
{{Dialogue|<Korgran stands in the shallows, his once warm eyes now locked in a gaze of wonder at the horizon as his lantern sways with the gentle ocean breeze.

A small ornate plaque hangs on the lantern. It reads:

Here stands Caretaker Korgran in his final shutdown.

May his forever rest not be dictated by tradition, but rather by choice.

- Caretaker Urtago>
