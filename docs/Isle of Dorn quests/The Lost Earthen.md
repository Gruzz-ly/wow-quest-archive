==Description==
This is horrible! I knew I should have been keeping a closer eye on him.

Confusion is the last symptom before a shutdown. Our memory is finite and starts overwriting. The more an [[earthen]] exert themselves, the faster their energy depletes and they lose memories. Korgran must be scared not knowing where he is--maybe not even who he is.

I am such a boulder head!

<Name>, please, I think I saw him go east into the trees. Meet me there up the road!

==Progress==
Were you able to find any sign of Korgran?

==Completion==
Oh no, Korgran's condition is sliding downhill fast.

Showing him the lantern was a good idea.

Thank you for guiding him back to me.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Urtago|I hope we can get to Korgran on time.}}
:''Urtago runs away.''

Catch up with Urtago Southwest of Mourning Rise:
:{{text|say|Urtago|Korgran! Where are you?}}
:{{text|say|Urtago|There must be something we can do! Maybe start by looking for tracks?}}

Urtago has gossip:
{{Dialogue|I lost his tracks. He must be around here somewhere.}}

Just northeast by some rocks and a tree is [[Korgran's Lantern]]:
:{{text|say|Korgran|I... I know that lantern. Is it... Is it my lantern?}}
:''Korgran appears.''

Talk with Korgran:
{{Dialogue|Yes, I remember you...

We worked together, didn't we? You are... um...

<Korgran pauses and taps his right temple. His eyes squint as he tries to remember your name.>

<Name>, yes, <name>... 

What was I talking about? Why are we here?

{{Gossip|quest=|<Show the lantern to Korgran.>}}

I remember now. I wanted to craft a lantern so it can guide me when I am lost.

You helped me make it. But... I don't recognize you. Everything is cloudy. I can't think.

There was another. Ur... I can't remember her name.

{{Gossip|quest=|Her name is Urtago. She is waiting for you.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Korgran|Waiting you say? For me? I must be important...}}
:''Korgran walks to Urtago.''

They have new gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Urtago|
I can feel the build up of pressure at my core. You outsiders call it sadness.

It is hard for me to see Korgran like this.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Korgarn|
Hello... Do I know you?

Hah, I can barely recognize myself anymore.

Have I ever showed you this lantern? A good friend of mine helped me make it. I... I don't remember their name.
