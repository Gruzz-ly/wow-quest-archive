==Objectives==
Evacuate 8 Unbound Meadworkers.
* [[Unbound Meadworker]]s evacuated (8)

==Description==
Look, you can blow up [[Cinderbrew Meadery|my life's work]] if it is our only choice, but I will not put my workers in danger.

This was the path we all chose, but I won't have them sacrifice themselves to fire or [[nerubian]]s for it. Tell them that I said they need to get out of here immediately. 

And if a single one of them gets so much as chipped, [[Council of Dornogal|the Council]] will have a lot to answer for!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If my workers cannot be kept safe, I am putting a stop to this plan.

==Completion==
I am glad to hear they had the sense to clear out without much of a fuss.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Lay the Trap]] before heading out. On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Wenbrandt|Are you sure this will work, [[Baelgrim]]?}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|It will. It has to.}}
:{{text|say|[[Adelgonn]]|Then let's get started.}}

Head north into the [[Meadyard]] and interact with [[Unbound Meadworker]]s:
*{{text|say|Unbound Meadworker|I hope Wenbrandt knows what he's doing!}}
*{{text|say|Unbound Meadworker|I'll hope there's a meadery to come back to.}}
*{{text|say|Unbound Meadworker|I'll tell the workers out in the forest to keep away!}}
*{{text|say|Unbound Meadworker|Nerubians? Here?!}}
*{{text|say|Unbound Meadworker|Well, that's exciting! And terrifying.}}
*{{text|say|Unbound Meadworker|You don't have to tell me twice!}}

==Progression==
{{The First Blow}}

==Patch changes==
