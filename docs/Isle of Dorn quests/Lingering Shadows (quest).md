'''Lingering Shadows''' begins the [[Lingering Shadows]] questline, added with the launch of [[patch 11.0.7]] during the [[Siren Isle campaign]]. Find [[Alleria Windrunner]] in [[Dornogal]] to begin. This questline eventually awards the [[Lingering Shadows (achievement)]] achievement.

==Objectives==
Return to where Alleria sensed Black Blood in Hallowfall.
*Take the burrow to [[Azj-Kahet]] (optional)
*Return to where [[Alleria]] sensed [[Black Blood]] in [[Hallowfall]]

==Description==
When we faced [[Xal'atath]]'s forces in Hallowfall, I sensed something dark just beneath the surface. Something that was not her, but it still troubles me.

I have learned that running into every situation myself is not always the best tactic. Sometimes, a leader must stand back to see the field.

So, I send you.

Go to Hallowfall, and uncover what you can about this mysterious force. I don't want to be caught blind again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
I didn't expect to see you here.

But then, you always manage to show up where there's something interesting, don't you?

There is no time for talk, though. My people have run into problems.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Xal'atath has been forced to retreat, but she and the Black Blood are still out there.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Even now it lingers in Hallowfall, long after [[A Light in the Dark|our last battle]]. Please investigate it further.}}

Alleria offers a skip for alts who have already done the Lingering Shadows questchain.

Take a portal to Azj-Kahet or head to [[Sanguine Grasps]] at {{coords|63.27|67.43|Hallowfall}} where [[Hannan]] and Orweyna are waiting.
:{{Text|Say|Orweyna|Do not lose hope, Hannan! They will be safe. I have seen it!}}

Upon completion, Orweyna has new gossip:
