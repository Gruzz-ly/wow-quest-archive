==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Sargassum Guardian.jpg|Sargassum Guardian|This fusion of sand and sea is empowered with ancient titan bracers.}}
Activate the [[Excavated Console]] and use the device to defeat the [[Sargassum Guardian]] in [[Golgrin's Reach]].
*Power cells inserted
*[[Titan Emitter|Titan device]] recovered
*Siphon Power from [[Sargassum Guardian|Elemental]]
*Sargassum Guardian slain

==Description==
Insert the batteries into the cylindrical holes on the console.

Then, [[titan]]s willing, we will see what it holds.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|09}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
To obtain the power necessary, find an [[elemental]] of sufficient size to charge the artifact.

If I am right, the titan artifact will do the rest.

==Completion==
Curious. It is emitting a signal I have seen before.

I have an idea where this may lead us.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|[[Dagran Thaurissan II]]|It's like puttin' in a battery. Just slot the power cells in, an' it should turn right on!}}

Interact with the [[Excavated Console]], then with the [[Titan Device]] to loot the [[Titan Emitter]].
:{{text|say|[[Speaker Brinthe]]|The console synthesized an object from its data logs.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|They can do tha'?}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Yes, but the device appears dormant. We may need another power source to determine the device's function.}}

Siphoning the [[Sargassum Guardian]], then kill it, and return to Brinthe and Dagran.
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Is it workin'? Can ye tell what it is?}}
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Allow us to look at it, <name>. Perhaps we can ascertain its function now.}}
