==Objectives==
Gather 20 handfuls of Elementally Charged Silt.
*Combine Frenzied Earth and Water to create Living Elemental Mud (Optional)
*Handfuls of [[:Elementally Charged Silt]] (20)

==Description==
Remember when we used that clay and the fire honey to patch up [[Shalehoof]]? Let's do that again, but bigger!

Problem is we've run out of clay. But fortunately, with all the recent seismic activity, a whole avalanche of [[elemental]]s has been roused out of torpor and are clashing on the eastern beach!

Bring me wet, elementally charged silt to use as our restorative substrate!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
By combining living sand and water, we can create an elemental silt that mimics the underclay's healing properties. Or at least something that comes close to it!

Isn't elemental fusion fascinating?

==Completion==
Can you feel the energy in the silt between your fingers, <name>? The charge that hums through it?

Isn't it exhilarating? Doesn't it make you feel one with the earth and the mountains?

<Harmot squeezes the silt in his thick stony fingers.>

==Notes==
Upon accept of both quests:
:{{text|say|Harvester Farnee|Mind yourself in the Cinderwold, <name>. The cinderbees don't take too kindly to disturbances.}}
:{{text|say|Harmot|They may be temperamental, but like all elemental creatures on the island, they're vital in the role they play!}}

You can either gather Elementally-charged Silts from [[Elemental Silt Mound]]s of sand around the beach or kill [[Scornful Sandshoal]]s and [[Frenzied Tidecore]] to loot their [[Frenzied Water Globule]]s and [[Frenzied Sand Globule]]s, and combine them to form the silts.

==Progression==
