==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Mage Slayer Phytethil.png||The Mage Slayer is known to extract all of the mana from its victims to be used as batteries in grand rituals.}}
Slay Mage Slayer Phytethil near [[Rambleshire]] in the [[Isle of Dorn]].
* [[Mage Slayer Phytethil]] slain

==Description==
I confess I have come here with reason. There is one entity that may be out there still that cannot be allowed its freedom.

A [[prisoner]] from the [[Violet Hold]] that we begrudgingly know as the Mage Slayer. I had come to request aid from these people, but they are farmers and ranchers. I hope you are better equipped for a challenge.

Seek out this fiend and put an end to its existence.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 13,000 [[XP]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+100 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) (first time) or 5x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Completion==
[[Dalaran]] may be in ruins, but the [[Kirin Tor]] does not grant you release Mage Slayer!

Thank you for your assistance, <name>.

Are you sure you defeated all of it?
