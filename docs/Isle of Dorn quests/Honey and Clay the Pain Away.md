==Objectives==
Help [[Harmot]] prepare [[Shalehoof]]'s salve.
*Break up the clay
*Fire honey placed into mortar
*Honey mixed into clay
*Honey mixture applied to Shalehoof

==Description==
[[Ramolith]]s! Magnificent, aren't they? One of the finest [[elemental]] beasts on the isle.

The bad news is they're not immune to injury. Poor Shalehoof here was attacked by awakened elementals in [[Harvester Farnee|Farnee]]'s pond.

The good news is that we have all we need to tend to him.

We just have to mix that clay you found with some fire honey and slap it up on ol' Shalehoof's hock! 

Ready?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Much like us earthen, healing something made from rock and stone is no easy task.

But the unique properties of the clay you've brought, combined with the fusing properties of the honey makes for an excellent restorative!

==Completion==
Well, aren't you just a natural with the elements. Ever thought about making a career out of it?

Say, since you're not afraid of getting messy, why don't you help us with Farnee's problem?

;To [[shaman]], instead the quest reads:
Well look at you! You are a MASTER of the elements! I've never seen anything like it!

Remind me to pick your memory matrix later on elemental beasts. THere's plenty of them across this land!

Say, since you're not afraid of getting messy, why don't you help us with Farnee's problem?

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Harvester Farnee|You're going to get a random outsider to heal my ram?}}
:{{text|say|Harmot|Absolutely I am! <Name> let's start by crushing up the clay you brought over on that anvil.}}

Break the clay on [[Earthen Mortar]]:
:{{text|say|Harvester Farnee|You never answered my question about dealing with the mountain giant--or his elemental friends!}}
:{{text|say|Harmot|As I was starting to say, earth elementals and mountain giants aren't exactly "friends," Farnee. Besides, the giant's sleeping!}}

Pick up fire honey from the [[Pot of Fire Honey]] and place it into mortar by using the Throw Fire Honey extra action button:
:{{text|say|Harmot|Well, sleeping for now anyway. It could wake up though. Oh, bring that honey over to the clay, <name>!}}
:{{text|say|Harvester Farnee|Sleeping or not, seems that those recent tremors have shaken up my pond. There's elementals all over my waterfall!}}

Mix honey into clay:
:{{text|say|Harvester Farnee|I'm not exactly keen to just wait for that giant rock and the rest of the waterfalls to just wake up.}}

Apply the honey mixture to Shalehoof:
:{{text|say|Harmot|I suppose waking him up on our terms might be a better solution instead of letting the elementals annoy him out of his slumber.}}
:{{text|say|Harvester Farnee|And how exactly do you propose we do that?}}

==Progression==
{{Elemental Healing}}
