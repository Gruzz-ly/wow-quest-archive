==Objectives==
Meet [[Peacekeeper Leif]] at [[Rambleshire]].

==Description==
The [[Order of Night]] is clearly interested in our resources. They have abducted [[earthen]] to harvest for them and may continue taking others. We must stop them.

The next largest earthen settlement is Rambleshire. If the Order needs more workers, they might have gone there to get them.

Go on ahead <name>. I must first speak with Kaerter about why the [[Arathi]] are doing this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
While we have not yet seen any Arathi, there is an uneasiness about the town.

Kaerter believes the Order is here. He says they are simply waiting for a moment to strike.

==Notes==
Upon accept, Leif and Kaerter start talking as they leave for [[Rambleshire]]:
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|Why would your people kill each other?}}
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|They're not MY people! I always work alone.}}
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|They're Order of Night cultists, they use shadow magic, wear purple clothes, yada yada. The usual.}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|... the usual what?}}
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|... You might be on the surface, but you don't get out much, do you?}}

Upon meeting catching up with them in Rambleshire:
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|They're here. I can feel it.}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|If they wanted to abduct more workers, Rambleshire is the next logical step.}}
