==Objectives==
Work with [[Augermu]] to create an Echo of N'Zoth and insert it into the Hourglass of Horrific Visions.
*Echo of N'Zoth created
*Orb Operation Manual unlocked

==Description==
We can use your displaced corrupted mementos to create Echoes of N'Zoth. 

I don't want to bore you with the details unless you want to hear. 

No? Oh well. 

<Augermu appears slightly disappointed.> 

The more echoes you have, the closer we can get you to a version of yourself that's more prepared for the visions. 

So, let's get started.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}

==Progress==
Were you able to slot in the first Echo of N'Zoth?

==Completion==
The more echoes you make, the more mementos it'll take.

If you ever want to know how much you need for the next one, talk to me. I'll figure it out.

Those visions are so creepy--but together I know we'll succeed, <class>. The Void stands no chance against us.

{{Dialogue|
Hello adventurer.

I can turn your Displaced Corrupted Mementos into power to help boost your power inside the Horrific Visions.
