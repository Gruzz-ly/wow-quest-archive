'''Delve into the Earth''' serves as an introduction to [[Delves]], the tentpole solo and small-group feature of {{expac|The War Within}}.

==Objectives==
Complete the Earthcrawl Mines delve near [[Freywold Village]].
*Journey to the [[Earthcrawl Mines]] delve
*Speak to [[Brann Bronzebeard]]
*Open the [[Explorers' League Supplies]]
*Earthcrawl Mines entered
*Earthcrawl Mines objectives completed
*Earthcrawl Mines treasure found
*Speak to Brann Bronzebeard outside the delve

==Description==
The [[nerubian]] attack, your meteoric fall...

And now [[Baelgrim]] is here?

Baelgrim needs more hands for his [[Coreway]], but I couldn't help even if I wanted to. My people are dying as we speak. Some were abducted by the nerubians during the attack.

You're not the first outlander I've met. A small fellow, like Moira, arrived here earlier and wasted no time following the nerubians. He took the path west to a nearby cave.

I would be in your debt if you found my people.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Arachnophobic Spelunker's Battleaxe]]
*[[Arachnophobic Spelunker's Battlestaff]]
*[[Arachnophobic Spelunker's Greatmace]]
*[[Arachnophobic Spelunker's Knife]]
*[[Arachnophobic Spelunker's Saber]]
*[[Arachnophobic Spelunker's Scepter]]
*[[Arachnophobic Spelunker's Spellsword]]
*[[Arachnophobic Spelunker's Striker]]

You will unlock access to the following:
:{{abilities|Delve Companion|Brann Bronzebeard permanently joins your party while in Delves.|icon=inv_cape_special_explorer_b_03|id=442446}}

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|56|18}}
*13,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The mines were always dangerous even when the Stonebound worked them. Be careful.

==Completion==
Thank you for saving my people from the nerubians.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|This is a waste of cycles. I will go to the quarry myself.}}
:''Baelgrim walks off.''
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|Then you'll be the first Stormrider it's seen for centuries.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Let him go. We'll rescue your people, Adelgonn.}} <!-- Last line here didn't appear for me. -->
:''Moira walks over to some [[Injured Earthen (Isle of Dorn)|Injured Earthen]] and starts healing them with {{Abilities|Moira's Mending|id=448092|icon=spell_holy_prayerofhealing02}}.''

Moira has gossip:
{{dialogue|Might as well roll up me robes an' help while I'm here.

Cannae hurt, can it?}} <!-- For me, she still uses gossip from after previous quest. -->

As does the earthen she is healing:
{{Dialogue|I feel... better. I've never felt this kind of healing magic before. Thank you, outlanders.}}

Before leaving, pick up the flight path, and [[Hreka]], north of town, starts [[Prairie Fever]].

Head west-southwest to [[Earthcrawl Mines]] and spot [[Brann Bronzebeard]] blasting an [[Armored Abductor]] into next week with [[:Ol' Faithful]], turning it into a [[Dead Nerubian]] in the process:
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Take that, ye crawlin' creeps! Won't get the best of me.}}

Speak with him:
{{dialogue|ARGH--ah, <name>! I cannae express how relieved I am tae see ye again.

I went explorin' an' found Freywold village. They'd been attacked by nerubians just before I arrived.

I think the attack happened around the same time as the Coreway and Dalaran attacks. Tha smacks o' a coordinated effort.

<Brann sighs.>

These earthen need our help, but I cannae do it alone.

An' who knows? We might find other things of interest.

So, how about it?

{{gossip|quest=|Let's go save the earthen in the delve.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Let's stock up on supplies before we head in.}}

Interact with the crates of [[Explorers' League Supplies]] next to him:
{{dialogue|<You rummage through the supplies and find a selection of useful items.>

{{gossip|View Brann Bronzebeard's supplies.>}}
}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|All right, let's do this! Through here!}}

This opens the Delve companion interface. Select a role for Brann, either healer or damage dealer, then run through the instance line to enter the delve. Delves can be completed solo or in role-agnostic groups of up to five players, though parties must be manually formed and cannot be queued for. While leveling, players can choose Tier 1 (minimum challenge) or Tier 2 (moderate challange). At max level, after completing [[The War Within campaign]] and an item level of at least 538, they can choose Tier 3 or higher.

For a walkthrough, see the [[Earthcrawl Mines]] article.

After clearing the boss and looting the treasure, exit the delve and speak with Brann once more:

{{dialogue|Whew, what an adventure--an we saved those earthen too!

{{gossip|quest=|What will you do now?}}}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|There's more tae explore out there! And ye know me. Can't resist a good cave.}}
:''Brann runs off.''

On return:
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Keeper's beard, the quarry is overrun with fungarians!}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|And whose fault is that? Your Edict is to protect the isle. Not just the city and not just the Oathsworn.}}

==Progression==
{{Earthen Fissures}}

==Alpha version==
;Description
:The nerubian attack, your meteoric fall...

:And now Baelgrim is here?

:It's a lot to process. But we must focus on the task at hand:

:Some of my people were taken by the nerubians during the attack. We believe they are now in a nearby cave.

:Baelgrim needs more hands for his [[Coreway]], right? We can't fix it if there aren't enough of us left.

:And I would be in your debt.

:You're not the first outlander I sent after them. A small fellow wandered through here and hasn't come back.

Moira's stay awhile and listen script started with two additional lines:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Let me just roll up me sleeves and hike up me robe an' we can get started.}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|I am grateful--and surprised--by your assistance. It is ironic that an outlander would be the one to finally help us.}}
