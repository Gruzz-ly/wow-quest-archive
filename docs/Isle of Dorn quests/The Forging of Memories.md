==Objectives==
Help Korgran forge his lantern.
*Speak with [[Korgran]] to start forging the lantern
*[[Korgran's Lantern|Lantern]] Forged

==Description==
Before its shutdown, we earthen would descend to the Awakening Machine below and renew our cycle. But now, even if it was still working, I would see my cycle broken and be remembered as I am.

<Korgran lets out a deep sigh.>

These hands look strong, but they become heavier with each passing moment. The stiffness in my wrists and elbows will not let me carry the items to the forge.

Please, add the right material to the forge as I call them out.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}

==Progress==
Oh, I almost forget. I did ask you to help with forging the lantern, didn't I?

==Completion==
Is it... hm, It looks like... I can't remember.

But this lantern is absolutely magnificent!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Korgran|Let me know when you are ready.}}

Speak with Korgran again:
{{Dialogue|I can feel it. It's like a shadow hanging at the edges of my memory.

It is growing, encroaching on me. It is like a dark fog that shadows parts of who I was and who I am.

My body... It is hard to move.

But! There is work to be done. I do love making things.

I was a Stonebound, did I tell you that? We used to tend the buildings in uh... D- the city!

I can take joy in making... the lantern! Yes, the lantern.

[[A Pile of Coals]], [[Ore Barrel]], and [[Charged Core]] light up.

:{{text|say|Korgran|Alright, let's see if I can still do this.}}
:{{text|say|Korgran|Would you toss me some of that ore, please?}}
:{{text|say|Korgran|This used to be easy.}}
:{{text|say|Korgran|Would you please hand me a charged core?}}
:{{text|say|Korgran|You are a great helper, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Korgran|We need more heat! Toss in some coals.}}
:{{text|say|Korgran|It is getting hard to concentrate.}}
:{{text|say|Korgran|Hm, what am I making? Oh, right, the lantern.}}
:{{text|say|Korgran|Wait, who are you? Oh, <name>, wasn't it?}}

;Fail
*{{Text|say|Korgran|Hm, not what I had in mind.}}

;Description
:These are pristine samples.

:<Korgran lets out a deep sigh.>

:There was a time when all of us could descend the [[Coreway]] and go to the Great Vault to be renewed. But now the Great Vault is offline, and even if it were not, it is difficult for [[Unbound]] to be supported in [[Dornogal]].
