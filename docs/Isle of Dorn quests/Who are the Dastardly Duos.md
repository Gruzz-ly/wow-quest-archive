'''Who are the Dastardly Duos?''' is the first of six weekly [[Dastardly Duos]] quests in [[Dornogal]], [[Stormwind]], or [[Orgrimmar]].

==Objectives==
Beat the [[Dastardly Duos]] while finishing Vinnie's "Dastardly" tasks, then speak with [[Vinnie Sweets]].
* Speak with [[Xyggie Marou]]
* Eat a Dastardly Food
* Drink a Dastardly Potion
* Damage a Dastardly Prop
* Win Dastardly Duos fight

==Description==
Great question! Here's how to find out: Talk to Xyggie Marou and sign up to fight the Dastardly Duos.

And because you're new to this, let me give you a list of "Dastardly" tasks to do while you're in there!

Good luck! Maybe I'll see you on the other side.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* [[Dastardly Prize Purse]]

==Progress==
Speak with Xyggie Marou, do my tasks, and beat those Dastardly Duos!

==Completion==
I saw your fight, good stuff. Here's your prize purse. Pleasure doing business.

Feel free to sign up again. I'll remember to not bet against you next time.

==Notes==
Vinnie has this to say when describing Dastardly Duos:
{{dialogue|Hey there, champion! If you're looking for the Dastardly Duos, then you're in the right place!

{{gossip|I want to be famous.}}
{{dialogue-child|If you get a high enough score, and pay me a little, then fame is in your future!

{{gossip|Alright, here's the payment. Now make me famous!

<Pay 100 gold>}} (''Awards [[Fiendishly Famous]].'')
}}
{{gossip|I want to be a Duos Darling.}}
{{dialogue-child|You know what fans love? An underdog!}}

{{gossip|Yep, I'm an underdog... and darling too!}} (''After earning [[Duos Underdog]] by dying at least 3 times in a match. Awards [[Duos Darling]].'')
}}

Speak with [[Xyggie Marou]]:
{{dialogue|You come here to fight?

Here's your form. Don't forget to check the 'donor' box.

{{gossip|Let's go!}}}}

This pops up a confirmation window:
{{dialogue|Enter the Dastardly Dome?}}

Confirming will enter in the queue, which drops players off at the south end of an instanced version of the [[Demolition Dome]] in [[Undermine]]. If not in a full 5-player party, players will be matched with [[Follower Dungeons]] NPCs and Xyggie Marou yells out:
:{{text|yell|Xyggie Marou|Here is some help! Talk to me if you want them gone.}}

Speak with her if desired:
{{dialogue|Want to dismiss the volunteers?

{{gossip|Dismiss them. We got this on our own!}}}}

If you dismiss the volunteers, you can speak with Xyggie again:
{{dialogue|Your group looks a little light. Want some volunteers to help?

{{gossip|Yeah I want volunteers. Fill up the party!}}
}}
