==Objectives==
Find Black Blood Residue and Displaced Corrupted Mementos from the bosses of the Corrupted and Lost areas of the [[Horrific Visions]].
* [[Black Blood Residue]] (8)
* [[Displaced Corrupted Mementos]] (500)

==Description==
Adventurer, I have made an amazing discovery. 

Analyzing the memories from the time I have discovered that I might be able to recreate the corruption effects that have been wielded in the past. Albeit in a much more controlled way. 

I will need you gather some black blood residue from defeating the bosses of the Corrupted or Lost areas of the map and a few more of the displaced corrupted mementos.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Lesser Rune of the Void Ritual]]
* [[Lesser Rune of the Twisted Appendage]]
* [[Lesser Rune of Gushing Wound]]
* [[Lesser Rune of Infinite Stars]]
* [[Lesser Rune of Echoing Void]]
* [[Lesser Rune of Twilight Devastation]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}

==Progress==
Were you successful?

==Completion==
Yes, by combining this residue with the displaced corrupted mementos I can... yeah just like so... and then with a bit of my bronze magic... there. Done.

Now that I have a working knowledge I can also make more if you bring me additional displaced corrupted mementos. I will see if I can refine the process anymore. Check back with me later.
