'''Trouble in the Highlands''' begins the [[Rise of the Red Dawn]] storyline added in [[patch 11.1.7]]. Find [[Faerin Lothar]] at her usual spot at {{co|46.1|49.6|Dornogal}} between [[Stonelight Rest]] and the flight master in central [[Dornogal]] to begin.

==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Arathi Highlands]] via the portal in [[Dornogal]].
* Take the portal to the Arathi Highlands
* Follow [[Faerin Lothar|Faerin]] {{co|21.6|38.5|Arathi Highlands||1}}
* Speak to Faerin

==Description==
Both [[Geya'rah]] and [[Danath Trollbane|Danath]] have received word of unrest in the Arathi Highlands--civil unrest in [[Stromgarde]], and raids on [[Mag'har orc|Mag'har]] and [[Stromgarde (kingdom)|Stromic]] outposts.

Danath and Geya'rah are returning to their homes, Stromgarde and [[Hammerfall]], to defuse tensions.

I asked to accompany them. I have long wanted to reconnect myself and [[Arathi|my people]] to the Arathi. I also want to learn more about the [[Horde]].

Geya'rah was willing, but... Danath took some convincing.

Though, I may have implied you were joining me...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I had been sent word of [[bandit]]s roaming the Highlands but... I did not know it was this bad.

It's just as well we happened into this attack.

If we want to get to the bottom of this, we might as well start here.

Though... I do wish Faerin were not here to see this.

==Notes==
Approach Faerin, Danath, and Geya'rah in Dornogal:
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Your people have broken their word, Trollbane.}}
:{{text|say|Danath Trollbane|I understand your frustration, Geya'rah. But do not rush to conclusions.}}

Danath has gossip:
{{dialogue|The Arathi Highlands have always been a hotbed of tensions. Let's just hope it's not as bad as these reports make it sound.

{{Gossip|We are all frustrated, Danath. You don't have to keep saying it. (To disable dialogue.)}}

{{Gossip|What were you and Geya'rah talking about? (To re-enable dialogue.)}}}}

As does Geya'rah:
{{dialogue|The Mag'har left Draenor to escape war and persecution. We only want peace. If the humans continue to test us, our patience will eventually run out.

We will not start a conflict, but rest assured we will finish it.}}

On accept:
:''The Earthen Runeweaver opens a Portal to Arathi Highlands, and Geya'rah and Danath move to take it.''
:{{text|say|Danath Trollbane|We must investigate before we have another war on our hands. <Name>? Lamplighter?}}
:''They take the portal.''
:{{text|say|Faerin Lothar|Ready and right behind you, Danath. Thank you for accompanying us, <name>.}}

Follow them through the portal to arrive in a special version of [[Arathi Highlands]], dropping off between [[Stromgarde Keep]] and [[Ar'gorok]] looking at [[Thoradin's Wall]]:
:{{text|say|Danath Trollbane|Hmph. Pity that a family squabble could make me loathe to return here.}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Family squabble? Feh. [[Marran Trollbane|Marran]]'s lucky she's your niece. I would have killed her for what she did.}}

Danath has gossip:
{{dialogue|My niece Marran might be a [[Trollbane]], but that is where our similarities end. I placed my trust in her, and she nearly started another war between the Horde and the [[Alliance]].

<Danath grimaces.>}}

Speak with Faerin:
{{dialogue|<Faerin does not seem to hear the conversation between Geya'rah and Danath.

Instead, her eyes are locked on the great ruin in the distance, a small smile creeping across her face.>

{{gossip|quest=|Play Movie=|<Stand and look with Faerin.>}}}}
An [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cutscene]] "Faerin and the wall" plays:
{{#ev:youtube|nr3rCuDHG64|Trouble in the Highlands}}
[[File:Trouble in the Highlands 2.png|thumb|Faerin talking to Danath]]
:''The [[adventurer]] and Geya'rah walk up to Danath and Faerin, who are staring at Thoradin's Wall.''
:{{text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|Is that...}}
:{{text|bossemote|Danath Trollbane|Thoradin's Wall? Yes.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|Then the stories and legends I read as a child were... True.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Danath Trollbane|Stories are just stories, Faerin. And that wall is just a wall.}}
:''Danath takes a few steps away.''
:{{text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|I know Arathi history is embelleshed, Danath. But are you not proud of your heritage?}}
:''Danath stops for a moment and turns around to look at Faerin, sighing.''
:{{text|bossemote|Danath Trollbane|Yes. But pride in our "legends" foments Stromic superiority. And reasons to strike at our neighbors.}}
:''Danath looks over his shoulder at [[Ar'gorok]].
:{{text|bossemote|Faerin Lothar|I understand. Among my people some still distrust outsiders. I had thought your people...}}
:''Danath sighs again.''
:{{text|bossemote|Danath Trollbane|Going to [[Khaz Algar]] was unpopular in Stromgarde. But the Sons of Lothar promote tolerance and mercy--}}
:''A scream in the distance cuts short the conversation.''
:{{text|bossemote|Newstead Farmer|Help! Bandits!}}
:''The adventurer and Geya'rah take off running. Faerin and Danath quickly follow.''

After the cutscene, run downhill to catch up with them. Faerin is kneeling down, speaking with [[Maggie Wiltshire]], who is on her knees. Danath is speaking with [[Walker Gresham]], and [[Overlord Geya'rah]] is standing over the corpse of a Slain Bandit. [[Clarabelle (cow)|Clarabelle]], the Highlands Cow of the Year, is tied to a post nearby.
*{{Alliance}} {{text|say|Walker Gresham|Finally! The Alliance has sent us help!}}
:{{text|say|Danath Trollbane|Finally? What's happened here, Walker?}}

*{{Horde}} {{text|say|Walker Gresham|Horde savages too? Stay back!}}
:{{Text|say|Danath Trollbane|Easy, Walker. We're here to help. Tell us what happened.}}

Several characters have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Walker Gresham|It's terrifying to think but...

If I hadn't been on my way out here to fix the wagon and Maggie hadn't followed me...

<Walker shakes his head.>

We were able to get out after the bandits showed up.

There are more and more of them every week. 

Why are they coming to the Highlands? How many people's lives are they here to ruin?}}

{{dialogue|title=Maggie Wiltshire|Are we safe? I'm still scared...

Can we go home now?}}

{{dialogue|title=Faerin Lothar|Don't worry, little one. You're safe with us.

<Faerin glances up at you.>

I'm not sure I agree with Danath. But...

Darkness, even here, affects even the youngest of our shared people.

I am glad I felt the calling to come here where I can be of service.

<Faerin, smiling, returns to distracting Maggie.>

I wish my hair was long enough to have braids like yours, Maggie.}}

{{dialogue|title=Overlord Geya'rah|Hmph.

This reminds me too much of [[Battle of Go'Shek Farm|what happened the last time Lord Danath returned]]...

{{gossip|Ask what Geya'rah means.}}

<Geya'rah's lip curls in disgust.>

Lord Danath left Stromgarde to be ruled by his niece, Lady Marran Trollbane, until his return.

She began using the [[7th Legion]] to claim territory that belonged to the Horde. To protect ourselves, we brought the [[Kor'kron]] here. It was a standoff.

[[Jaina]] and [[Thrall]] traveled to Stromgarde and [[Hammerfall]] to ask for aid in Khaz Algar. That went as well as you would expect.

The conflict only ended when my people laid down their arms and the 7th Legion did the same. Lord Danath arrived and removed Marran from rule. And then we all joined the fight in Khaz Algar.

Lady Marran is in prison, but old hatreds smolder. Not surprising another threat has kindled from its ashes.}}

{{dialogue|title=Danath Trollbane|An attack here? This close to Stromgarde?

If Stromgarde cannot even defend a farmstead outside its walls, something is terribly wrong.}}
