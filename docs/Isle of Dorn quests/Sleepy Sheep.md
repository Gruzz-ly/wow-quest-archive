==Objectives==
Use an Energized Lodestone to rouse 1 Lethargic Mosswools near [[Rambleshire]].
* [[Lodestone (item)]] found
* [[Energized Lodestone|Lodestone charged]] by [[Shraubendre]]
* [[Lethargic Mosswool]]s roused (8)

==Description==
The energized moss that these flocks produce is a favorite treat for the storm rooks. But with the storm gone, the rams are lethargic, vulnerable, and no longer producing.

We may not be able to conjure a storm, but we could offer the mosswools a motivating zap. See if you can find a lodestone that will hold a charge. Then bring it here to [[Shraubendre]] so she can get it loaded up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The lodestone should hold just enough of a charge to give the mosswools the motivation they need to return to their corrals. It won't hurt them.

==Completion==
The mosswools look like they have a bit more pep. Hopefully they'll start producing again soon, if the storm comes back, that is.

Rancher Stenspor believes he knows why the storm is missing. He claims two legendary ram brothers re-energize the storm once a year. Just not this year, for some reason.

==Notes==
;Upon picking up this quest and [[Power Predators]]
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|I'll head into the village to find someone who knows what's going on with the storm. The lack of one, rather.}}
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|Shraubendre, stay here for now. I don't want you spooking the livestock.}}
:''Lufsela starts walking toward the ranch.''

Look near the bridge for [[Highlands Lodestone]], return to Shraubendre and interact with it, then click on Lethargic Mosswools on the farm.

;Upon approach
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|You're telling me the storm's gone on account of a missing ram?}}
:{{Text|say|Head Rancher Stenspor|Not just any ram!}}
