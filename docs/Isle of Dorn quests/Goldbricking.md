==Objectives==
Spar with undisciplined earthen trainees.
* [[Undisciplined Earthen]] sparred (8)

==Description==
Is this what we are to rely on to help us defeat [[Xal'atath]]? The [[Unbound]] define themselves by their desertion. And the [[Oathsworn]], for being made of stone, are pretty soft. City life hasn't done them any favors.

We've got a lot of work to do.

Get down there and give these earthen a taste of what it's like to face a real threat. Try not to knock any "offline," but a maiming here or there would send a strong message to the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Don't go easy on them. They're made of stone after all.

==Completion==
You lit a fire down there, and we will continue to fan the flames.

Go now, secure in knowing you have helped set these earthen on the path to glory. The nerubians won't know what hit them!

==Notes==
On accept of both, if Alliance:
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|Pay attention, orc. Watch one of the Alliance's best at work.}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Oh! Will they also talk the enemy to death?}}
:{{text|emote|Adelgonn sighs.}}

If Horde:
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|You're in luck, Exarch. You get to see how the Horde gets things done.}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|I see more than you know.}} 
:{{text|emote|Adelgonn sighs.}}

Speak with any Undisciplined Earthen on the beach:
{{dialogue|
*Can't you see I'm busy?
*This better be good.
*Why don't you mind your own business?
*Do you need something?
*Do I know you?
*I'm getting too old for this...
*What do you want?
*I'm in the middle of something here.

Aggro:
*{{text|say|Undisciplined Earthen|Have at you!}}
*{{text|say|Undisciplined Earthen|I can take you!}}
*{{text|say|Undisciplined Earthen|I don't need practice!}}

*{{text|say|Undisciplined Earthen|Watch this!}}
*{{text|say|Undisciplined Earthen|You doubt my skill?}}
*{{text|say|Undisciplined Earthen|You think I can't fight?}}

Defeat:
*{{text|say|Undisciplined Earthen|I apologize for my failings.}}
*{{text|say|Undisciplined Earthen|I shall correct myself.}}
*{{text|say|Undisciplined Earthen|I will join the others.}}

*{{text|say|Undisciplined Earthen|I... suppose I have more to learn.}}
*{{text|say|Undisciplined Earthen|Sorry. Won't happen again.}}

On return:
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|Meddling titans, do the Alliance and Horde always bicker like this?}}
