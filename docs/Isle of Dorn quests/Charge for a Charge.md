==Objectives==
Collect 3 Power Cells in [[Golgrin's Reach]].
* [[Power Cell]] (3)

==Description==
I am pleased [[Dagran]] has brought you here. I need help with a dangerous task.

I used Dagran's opals to repair the titan console we recently recovered from this site.

The [[Oathsworn]] have long wanted to learn more about the [[titan]]s and restore records unreachable in the [[Archive]]--or from before its construction.

This console may hold some answers if we can bring it back online.

Take this device I have made. It will lead you to titan power cells we can use to power it on now that it is restored.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Without power, we will not be able to bring the console online.

==Completion==
Well executed, <name>.

Now, I will need Dagran's help.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Speaker Brinthe| Follow the device's pulses. When the indicator fills, the power cells are nearby.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II| An' watch out for elementals. They're all over the place.}}

Follow the Power Detector circle and beam to look for and reveal [[Sand Pile]]s that contain [[Power Cell]]s.
