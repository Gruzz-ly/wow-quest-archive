:{{Text|say|Merrix|Seek out my steward, <name>. He is waiting to assist you.}}

Alleria has a <Stay awhile and listen.> gossip option:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Jaina, Thrall. When we last spoke, I... was in a dark place.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|My grief and rage were deafening. I thought the only way to silence them...}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|...was to hunt down those responsible.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I know what that's like. To survive an atrocity, and feel like vengeance is all you have left.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Or to think you could have stopped what happened, if you had just seen what was right in front of you.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|That pain, that guilt... I felt it twisting me into someone I'm not.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|But I assure you... I have found my way back from the edge. And I am here, with you, to the end.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|It's good to have you with us, Alleria.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|We're all in this together.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|That we are. The time will come when I must face Xal'atath again.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|But when I do... It will be for the right reasons.}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Dornogal Steward]]|
Long ago, Councilward Merrix appointed me as the decorator of Dornogal. 

It is my solemn duty to maintain the aesthetic harmony of our city. With each passing cycle, I diligently weave style and beauty into the fabric of Dornogal's streets, imbuing them with a subtle elegance and functional allure that befits our esteemed heritage. 

As the appointed decorator, I pledge to uphold the legacy of Merrix and ensure that Dornogal remains a beacon of beauty and wonder for cycles to come.

How can I help you?

{{gossip|I'm here to help prepare the embassy.}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Dornogal Steward|Directive confirmed. Let us begin with banners then.}}
:{{Text|say|Dornogal Steward|I am certain you will find this design to your taste.}}

Place both faction banners:
:{{Text|say|Dornogal Steward|Very good. Let us continue inside.}}
:{{Text|say|Dornogal Steward|I have prepared everything you might need.}}
:{{Text|say|Dornogal Steward|Once your task is complete, please let me know.}}

Inside, place two [[Large Horde Banner]]s on either side of the fire, an [[Horde Weapon Rack]] and the [[Strongbox]] in the corner, and a [[Small Horde Banner]] on the north wall. Once done:
:{{Text|say|Dornogal Steward|Well done. All I need now is your signature.}}

;Interacting with the steward again
{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|
{{gossip|You wanted me to sign something?}}

Ah yes, please sign this and I will be on my way.

<The steward extends his hand, offering the document for your signature with a practiced efficiency.>

I hereby certify that the embassy building has been meticulously inspected and prepared in strict adherence to the established standards and regulations, ensuring its suitability for diplomatic operations.

Signed

Head back out to the Coreway to spot [[Magni Bronzebeard]], [[Moira Thaurissan]], [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]], [[Thrall]], [[Merrix]], [[Lady Liadrin]], [[High Exarch Turalyon]], and [[Alleria Windrunner]] gathered:

{{dialogue|title=Magni Bronzebeard|Well, I'm nae a thraegar anymore--if I ever was. Am I still Azeroth's Speaker?

No way tae know until I'm called again, I suppose.

When I think o' the energy Azeroth had locked inside o' me, an' how long it took me tae come here an' use it...

Tae think freein' and healin' these people--an' meself--was what I was meant tae do all along...

I needa moment to think an' breathe. 

An' Let the wind blow through me beard!}}

Turalyon has new gossip after accepting the quest:

{{dialogue|title=High Exarch Turalyon|Alleria and I didn't have a chance to speak before she departed for Dalaran. 

To know what she went through...

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}

:{{Text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|I would have come sooner. I wanted to. But the state of the world right now... the Radiant Song...}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|It's alright, Turalyon. You don't. We each have our responsibilities to bear.}}
