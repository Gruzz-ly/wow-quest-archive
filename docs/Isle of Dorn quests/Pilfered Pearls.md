==Objectives==
Retrieve 8 Pilfered Pearls from [[gorloc]]s at the [[Glimmering Shore]].
* [[Pilfered Pearl]] (8)

==Description==
The pearls that these farmers harvest are their only source of livelihood. Some of these earthen even look at pearl farming as their primary reason for existing.

The gorlocs continue to pilfer pearls at every opportunity. As you eliminate the gorlocs, search them for stolen pearls. Let us recover as many as we can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We need to return these pearls to the farmers.

==Completion==
Thank you <name>. Eliminating the gorloc threat was just one of our objectives here. Giving the farmers their lives back is another.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Frontline Farmers]] before heading out.

[[Pearlfin Sea-Shaman]], [[Pearlfin Sparkleseeker|Sparkleseekers]], [[Pearlfin Tiderunner|Tiderunners]], [[Pearlfin Waterweaver|Waterweavers]] all can drop a [[Pilfered Pearl]], but not the [[Burgeoning Seaborne Colossus|colossi]] that the sea-shaman have summoned nor the [[Pearlfin Clawclacker]] hunter pets.

While killing gorlocs and placing weapon crates, watch out for rare gorloc [[Gar'loc]] just east of the east crate location.

On return after completing both objectives, Aggartha and four Pearl Farmers have relocated slightly and have just fended off a wave of gorlocs:
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|Take that gorlocs!}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|Are we winning?}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|Of course we are!}}

Aggartha has new gossip:
{{dialogue|The farmers have acquitted themselves well. I am proud to fight alongside them.

However, this is not yet over.}}
