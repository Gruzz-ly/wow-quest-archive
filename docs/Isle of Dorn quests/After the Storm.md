'''After the Storm''' begins the second chapter of the max-level [[The War Within (achievement)]] campaign.

==Objectives==
Check on the Stormriders.
* [[Stormriders]] assessed (4)
* [[Rooktender Lufsela|Lufesla]] questioned

==Description==
[[Turalyon]] and [[Geya'rah]] are training our new [[earthen]] allies as ground forces. But we will need more than that. We will need the Stormriders.

Many were lost in the infiltration of the [[Stormperch]] and more to the [[nerubian]]s. Their leader, Stormward [[Baelgrim]], died valiantly.

The surviving Stormriders are being cared for at a triage station nearby. We need to do whatever is necessary to get them and their rooks back in the air. They will be the earthen's most potent weapon in the battles to come.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 6,100 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
I'm sorry about Shraubendre. She was just protecting me. And I lied to protect her.

But you truly don't intend to take her away? You just want to summon more stormrooks?

==Notes==
Prior to accepting the quest:
{{Dialogue|title=[[Jaina Proudmoore]]|The Alliance and Horde fleets have finally arrived. I only regret I could not teleport our forces here. So many lives might have been spared if only we could have gotten here sooner.}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Thrall]]|Well met, champion. It seems you have been busy in our absence. But there is still much work to be done, and I fear there is little time left for it.}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Merrix]]|There is much work to be done before we can commit ourselves to the war below. I hope your Horde and Alliance friends are up to the task.}}

On accept:
:{{Text|say|Thrall|I will accompany you, <name>. I want to learn about the Stormriders and their bond with their rooks.}}

Head southeast to catch up with [[Thrall]] and the Stormriders:
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Is this all that remains of the Stormriders?}}

Thrall has gossip:
{{dialogue|There are so few Stormriders left, and it seems their rooks were lost in battle. But we must not despair. If the stormrooks were summoned into our world once before, it can be done again.}}

Before leaving Merrix, Jaina and Moira have new gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Merrix|The Stormriders will be a critical component to any strategy we earthen might employ in this war. Be sure that they're ready. Without Baelgrim, they'll need strong leadership.}}

{{dialogue|title=Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I would go with you as well, but there are still more ships making their way here, and the seas around the isle can be turbulent. I will see what I can do to calm the winds and the waves, while you and Thrall see to the stormrooks.}}

{{dialogue|title=Moira Thaurissan|It is good to have Jaina and Thrall back with us after all that has happened. I just hope the Horde and Alliance can fulfill the promises we've so far set. There is much to be done.}}

Interact with the Stormriders:
{{Dialogue|title=[[Stormrider Meirand]]|
<Stormrider Meirand appears to have a significant head injury. She looks to be shielding her eyes from the light.>

{{gossip|quest=|How are you holding up?}}

Been better. Hit the ground hard when I lost my stormrook. One moment she was under me, the next she was just gone.

{{gossip|quest=|What happened out there?}}

It was chaos. We were expecting reinforcements from the Stormperch, but they never came. We were overwhelmed.}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Stormrider Vokmar]]|
<Stormrider Vokmar's injuries look severe, but he should pull through.>

{{gossip|quest=|You all right?}}

My shoulder... I don't dare remove this pauldron. It may be the only thing holding my arm together.

{{gossip|quest=|Are the four of you all that's left?}}

As far as I know. But even if we were well enough to fly, our stormrooks are gone. What use are we now?}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Stormrider Edeltrau]]|
<Stormrider Edeltrau shows no outward signs of injury, but she nevertheless appears to be in great pain.>

{{gossip|quest=|Are you okay?}}

I keep reliving the battle over and over like my memory is... broken.

I hear the stormrooks screaming. And see their riders falling... falling so far.

{{gossip|quest=|Where did the stormrooks come from?}}

The stormrooks have always been with us. Only Stormward Baelgrim knew of their origins, and he took those secrets to the grave.}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Stormrider Hunfrid]]|
<Stormrider Hunfrid wears a thousand-yard stare. He doesn't even look up at your approach.>

{{gossip|quest=|Hello?}}

<It takes him a moment, but Hunfrid eventually meets your gaze.>

I'm sorry. Were you saying something?

{{gossip|quest=|Would Baelgrim have told anyone how to summon stormrooks?}}

I do not know. Maybe Gorren, but he is gone too. Perhaps you should try one of the rooktenders?}}

After speaking with the fourth:
:{{text|say|Thrall|We need to ask someone who knows them well. Lufsela, may we speak to you?}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Rooktender Lufsela]]|
I can't believe what has happened. So many Stormriders lost. And the poor stormrooks.

They were dispersed back to Skywall, a place they haven't seen in titans-know how long. They must be so scared.

{{gossip|quest=|Do you know how to find more stormrooks?}}}}
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|All the stormrooks are gone. I can't help you.}}
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|Now if you'll excuse me, I have my, uh. roo-fish to, uh, water!}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|She is hiding something. Follow her.}}

Upon approach, the adventurer and Thrall are struck with lightning and get {{abilities|Zapped|id=442324|icon=spell_frost_stun}} by [[Shraubendre]]:
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|Shraubendre, no!}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Easy, friend. We don't want to harm your rider.}}
