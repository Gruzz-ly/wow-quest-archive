'''Shattered Spires''' is offered to players who complete [[Slay the Saboteurs]] and [[Urgent Recovery]] but did not pick up [[Erratic Artifacts]] from [[Aethas Sunreaver]] while in the area.

==Objectives==
Find [[Aethas Sunreaver|Aethas]] at the [[Tranquil Strand]].

==Description==
With nothing to contain their [[arcane]] power, [[Dalaran]]'s spires are crumbling.

If we let their energies continue to bleed out unchecked, that power could destabilize and destroy what is left of our forces.

Find Aethas! He will know what to do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}
*1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]] yet lives?

Thank the [[Sunwell]]!

Though none of us will survive long if we do not contain the energies of the spires.
