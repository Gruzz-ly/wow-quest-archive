==Objectives==
Meet with [[Speaker Brinthe]] and [[Dagran]] behind [[Dornogal]] in the [[Isle of Dorn]].

==Description==
There is... a place behind Dornogal that I cannot go.

And I am not the only one. Something--a force, most likely [[titan]] in origin--keeps the [[earthen]] from investigating a small portion of the island behind the city.

This, of course, fires my curiosity. But for thousands of years I have dutifully kept away. It seemed the titans' will.

The site emits a faint signal like the one from this device. Perhaps it is "the key" in a literal sense to what lies there.

We will see.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I cannot describe what this place feels like to me.

It is... oppressive. I cannot think.

The urge to turn back is... strong.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{Text|say|Speaker Brinthe| Come with me, Dagran. Perhaps you can help me process what has happened here.}}
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|O' course, Speaker. We'll meet ye near the abandoned tower behind Dornogal, <name>.}}

Upon approach behind Dornogal:
:{{text|emote|Speaker Brinthe winces in pain.}}
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Speaker Brinthe? Is somethin' wrong?}}
