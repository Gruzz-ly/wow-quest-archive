'''Somehow We Survived''' concludes the Arcane Desolation half of the [[Fate of the Kirin Tor]] storyline. [[Jaina Proudmoore]] immediately starts the Strength Amidst Ruins portion with [[A Helping Hand (Isle of Dorn)]].

==Objectives==
[[File:Somehow We Survived.jpg|thumb|Kalecgos and Jaina]]
Regroup with [[Kalecgos]] at the [[Tranquil Strand]].

==Description==
What we experienced in [[Kel'Thuzad]]'s [[pocket dimension]] is a timely reminder of what can happen when [[magic]] is used without regard to ethics or regulation.

To me, this underlines the importance of the [[Kirin Tor]].

But, on the other hand, Kel'Thuzad was Kirin Tor. It is also a reminder of how power corrupts.

Now that we have made sure these artifacts will not cause anyone else to go on an unexpected trip... Let's return to [[Aethas]].

Perhaps now more have responded to his letter.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
It looks like more mages have arrived!

This gives me hope.

I am sure Aethas will be relieved.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|Our brush with Kel'Thuzad underscores my greatest fears about the Kirin Tor. I... we need to regroup.}}
:''Kalecgos turns to his dragon form and flies off.''

Return to the Tranquil Strand and meet up with Kalecgos and [[Jaina Proudmoore]] outside the arcane bubble:
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Kalecgos! It is good to see you.}}

Jaina has gossip:
{{dialogue|Closure is finding peace in saying goodbye.}}

==Progression==
