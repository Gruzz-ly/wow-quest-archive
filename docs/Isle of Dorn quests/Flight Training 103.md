==Objectives==
Help [[Kurdran]] train recruits in aerial combat.
* [[Tiderusher Shalemaw|Shalemaws]] blasted (50)

==Description==
These recruits seem tae be up for a challenge. Let's find them somethin' with a little bite!

I saw a poor giant just off shore bein' pestered by a swarm of flying devils. Let's see if these rooks can shoot the wings off 'em an' provide some relief.

You and [[Shraubendre]] are settin' a good example for the rest. Keep it up!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Stormrider Flight Badge]]
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
The training went well, did it? I'm sorry I wasn't there for it. There was just something I had to do.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kurdran Wildhammer|Right then. Let's hunt those beasties.}}

Kurdran has gossip before leaving:
{{dialogue|Grateful to the tinkers for those projectors. Hope we didn't fry too many of them with those lightning blasts. All in the name of progress, eh!}}

Hop on [[Shraubendre]] once more, then head southeast to the [[Sunken Shield]]. Blast all the [[Tiderusher Shalemaw]]s that are pestering [[Austraskeld]].

At 20:
:{{text|say|Kurdran Wildhammer|Send them down to the deeps, lads and lasses!}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Kothilde|Lads? Lasses? We are thousands of years old.}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Gurnot|It is not age that matters but experience.}}

At 50:
:{{text|say|Kurdran Wildhammer|Well done, everyone. I think it's time we gave your stormrooks a breather.}}
:{{text|say|Kurdran Wildhammer|<Name>, I think I saw the ol' Stormrider, Olbarig, while flyin' by the Meadery.}}
:{{text|say|Kurdran Wildhammer|Ye might check on him while I take the flock home to roost.}}

Find Olbarig just north of the [[Cinderbrew Meadery]] at [[Sunrise Shadow]]:
:{{text|say|Olbarig|I came to see where Baelgrim fell. Didn't expect to find the ones responsible.}}
