* [[Disfigured Ghoul]] slain (3)
* Speak with the Mirror Image
* Leave pocket dimension

==Description==
A pocket dimension. This is old magic.

[[Malygos]] used pocket dimensions on occasion when he did not wish to be disturbed.

They were mainly used by mages as research spaces or for testing dangerous spells. Or if a mage wanted to hide what they were doing...

I wonder who made this one? I supposed it doesn't matter. We need to get out. 

Thankfully, every pocket dimension has an exit. Though, it is normally well hidden.

Let's find it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 15x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Look! Whatever magic was left in that necklace is gone now. And with it, Kel'Thuzad's mirror image.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|Perhaps that scroll holds the key to leaving?}}

Kalecgos has new gossip:
{{dialogue|There must be a way out. We just have to find it!

The answer lies somewhere in this chamber.}}

If you escape from the dimension using a teleport or Hearthstone, you can return via the [[Portal to Pocket Dimesion]] where the previous quest began. Kalecgos is standing near it with the following gossip:
{{Dialogue|<name>! It seems we've been separated! Use this portal to return to the pocket dimension--I need your help!}}

Before interacting with the scroll there are three other items of interest around that one can inspect:

{{Dialogue|title=Journal|Today, Antonidas introduced me to his pupil, Miss Proudmoore. 

While she shows a certain aptitude, I cannot help but feel disappointed by the lack of ambition and drive I see in her and many of her generation. They seem content with mediocrity, unwilling to push beyond the basic limits of their abilities. 

In my day, we were eager to delve into the deepest arcane mysteries and constantly sought to expand our knowledge and power. 

The future of our craft looks bleak if this complacency persists.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Rat Cage|<The rat cage is a single-level, rectangular enclosure with sturdy metal bars.

It is equipped with a wheel, tunnels, and a cozy nesting area.>}}

{{Dialogue|title=Letter from the Council|Following the Council's recent investigation, all forbidden tomes and scrolls concerning dark magics in your possession have been seized and destroyed.

Should we ever discover any further engagement with forbidden arcane practices, severe consequences will follow, including expulsion from the Council of Six and Dalaran.

This is your last warning.

[Signed]

Grand Magus Antonidas}}

[[File:Research Notes (Pocket Dimension).jpg|thumb|Research Notes]]
Interact with the Pursuit of Eternal Life scroll. It shifts out the Fragmented Souls, and some [[Research Notes (Pocket Dimension)|Research Notes]]:
{{dialogue|After extensive experimentation on rats, it is evident that I have reached the limitations of what can be learned from them as test subjects.

To progress my research further, it is imperative that I transition to human subjects. However, this shift introduces significant ethical risks. I also risk discovery by my meddling "peers."

To mitigate these risks, I should consider sourcing subjects from the sewers, where disappearances are less likely to attract attention.

This approach may seem "controversial," but it is the only way to obtain the knowledge I so crave.}}

Interact with the three [[Fragmented Soul]]s, which have random gossip:

{{Dialogue|He found me in the sewers. Promised food and a safe place to sleep.

It's so cold here.

{{gossip|quest=|<Release the Fragmented Soul.>}}
}}
{{Dialogue|He promised to cure me. Everyone said the Kirin Tor can be trusted!

Now look at me.

{{gossip|quest=|<Release the Fragmented Soul.>}}
}}

{{dialogue|He got angry when the experiment failed. 

Can you help us?

{{gossip|quest=|<Release the Fragmented Soul.>}}}}

[[File:Trapped Between Life and Death - Stratholme.jpg|thumb|Stratholme-based clues]]
Once the Soul Fragments are released, a new scenario shifts:
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|Another shift. Keep doing what you're doing, <name>. Perhaps we'll shift out of here!}}

Several objects appear, including a [[Rusted Key (Pocket Dimension)|Rusted Key]]:
{{dialogue|<Attached to the keychain you find a note: "[[Stratholme]]">}}

And a [[Bag of Grain]]:
{{dialogue|Delivered to Dalaran as requested: fresh grain from Brill.

Payment upon receipt.}}

In the center is a cauldron with two three items around it on grain piles, a Skull, some Alchemical Solution, and the Essence of Death. Toss them in to the cauldron:
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|<Name>, look out!}}

The [[Disfigured Ghoul]]s appear.
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|Ghouls...like the ones in [[Northrend]]. But they're unstable. Are they a prototype?}}

Slay the three Disfigured Ghouls and then the mirror image of [[Archmage Kel'Thuzad]] & [[Mr. Bigglesworth]] appear.
:{{Text|Yell|Archmage Kel'Thuzad|Enough!}}
:''Kalecgos walks towards Kel'Thuzad.''
:{{Text|Say|Archmage Kel'Thuzad|Did the Council send you to seize my tomes again?}}
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|Careful. Even though that's a mirror image, it can still be dangerous.}}

Speak with Kel'Thuzad:
{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|
Meddlesome <class>. How did you find this place?

*{{gossip|quest=|We are here by mistake. We would leave if we knew how.}}
*{{Gossip|What is this place?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Must I explain everything to you simpletons?

Fine. This pocket dimension is a realm hidden from prying eyes, a place where driven, visionary mages--like myself--can make real progress. 

It's a world of shadow, cloaked in magic, where time bends to your will and power flows freely--if you know how to harness it. 

And best of all, there are no distractions, no fools meddling in your affairs. Just you, your ambition, and raw arcane energy waiting eagerly to be tamed and shaped.

{{gossip|I saw your experiments.}}

As the sole master of this dimension, the usual quibbling Alliance moral constraints and the nonsense rules of the Kirin Tor are, shall we say, optional. 

Progress demands sacrifice--sometimes of the body, sometimes of the soul. Here, I push the boundaries of magic in ways narrow-minded mages like Antonidas would never dream. Flesh is just another material to mold. Death merely a doorway to greater power. 

Here I reanimate, reshape, and rewrite the very laws of existence. Souls, energy, life--all are tools. There is no room for sentiment when grappling with the power of life and death.

The key to immortality is within my reach.

{{gossip|I have more questions.}}}}

{{Gossip|Tell me about the Kirin Tor.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
The Kirin Tor? They are nothing but a husk of their former selves.

Once they pursued true magical power, but now they're bogged down by endless debates and pointless moral equivocating. Every spell is questioned, every action turned into political theater. Instead of mastering magic, they waste time worrying about ethics and appearances. 

They've forgotten that magic isn't a gift--it is power. Power we could wield to dominate our foes. And finally have lasting peace!

But instead we negotiate and pander.

Pathetic.

{{gossip|I have more questions.}}}}

{{gossip|{{Text|red|<Skip this conversation.>}} Let us out of here.}}

:{{text|say|Archmage Kel'Thuzad|A mistake? Is that not what the Kirin Tor is now? Bumbling mages making mistakes and meddling in what they understand not.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Kel'Thuzad|They mistake cowardice for morality and wisdom for mediocrity.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Kel'Thuzad|True power can only come from sacrifice; from setting aside taboos and fear and venturing into the unknown.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Kel'Thuzad|So, do not speak to me of mistakes. The Kirin Tor is the mistake. I have chosen my path, one of learning and discovery.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Kel'Thuzad|I will not be hindered by the shortsightedness of those who cling to the illusion of "right" and "wrong."}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Kel'Thuzad|Now, go before I find use of you in one of my experiments.}}
:''A [[Passage Between Dimensions]] appears, and Kalecgos walks into it.''

Interact with it, and it will return players back to Mourning Rise:
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|We're back! Kel'Thuzad helped us... and the necklace is just a necklace now.}}
