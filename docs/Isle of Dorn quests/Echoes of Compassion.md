[[File:Echoes of Compassion.jpg|thumb|Injured earthen at [[Freywold Village]]]]

==Objectives==
Heal 5 Earthen denizens in [[Freywold Village]].
* [[Injured Earthen]] healed (5)
* Findorn picked up
* Findorn placed in pool
* Ebona assessed

==Description==
The last thing I expected today was to see [[Baelgrim]]--much less receive his help. But I guess since the [[Coreway]] was damaged, he has no choice. I... do not know how to compute this. It is only logical to accept it.

<[[Adelgonn]] begins crushing the [[fungarian]] flesh roughly in her stone hands. It becomes a masticated pulp disturbingly quickly.>

Here. Mix this with mud and apply it to the injured.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Cured Terracotta Axe]]
*[[Cured Terracotta Firearm]]
*[[Cured Terracotta Lantern]]
*[[Cured Terracotta Pummeler]]
*[[Cured Terracotta Shield]]
*[[Cured Terracotta Stabber]]
*[[Cured Terracotta Warglaive]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We've fought off animals and elementals before, but nerubians? My people are artisans and miners--not warriors.

==Completion==
<Adelgon appraises Moira, Baelgrim, and finally you.>

I... thank you. It's been a long time since I've received help from outlanders--or the Oathsworn.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|This poultice can mend even our stone bodies.}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|Baelgrim. Your help is... appreciated.}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|You were right. I have been... remiss in fulfilling my Edict.}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Now the Coreway lies in ruin. I need your help, Adelgonn. Just like you needed mine.}}

Interact with five Injured Earthen in the area to apply a salve on them.
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|I need Findorn and [[Treagor]] brought to the pool.}}

Interact with Findorn:
{{dialogue|<Findorn's face is a mass of webs. Pale, dull eyes peek out... but they blink once slowly at you.>

{{gossip|quest=|<Carry Findorn to the pool.>}}}}

Walk Findorn to the pool and Baelgrim will do the same for Treagor.
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|Good. Now for Ebona...}}

Interact with Ebona:
{{dialogue|<Ebona looks like a pile of rubble. A faintly glowing and mud-like poultice is barely holding her together.

Ebona's eyes are still and do not respond to light or movement.>

{{gossip|quest=|How is Ebona doing?}}}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|She's fading. I...}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|My stormrook can take her to Dornogal. Perhaps the healers there can help.}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|Baelgrim... thank you.}}
:''[[Zarein]] leaps over, picks up Ebona, and flies off.''

On complete, an [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cutscene]] plays, Nerubian Swarm Flyover:

{{#ev:youtube|3ACeDsJLXIE|Nerubian Swarm Flyover}}

''The sky overhead is overwhelmed by a huge swarm of Nerubians flying over, on the way to the city.''

Afterwards, Adelgonn has new gossip:
{{dialogue|I am vastly curious about your people's origins. This isle hasn't seen outsiders for a long time.

In a way... I've been waiting for your arrival. You are the sign that we [[Unbound]] have been seeking.}}

==Progression==
{{Earthen Fissures}}
