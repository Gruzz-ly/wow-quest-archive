==Objectives==
Find Black Blood Coagulate and Displaced Corrupted Mementos from the bosses of the Lost areas of the [[Horrific Visions]].
* [[Black Blood Coagulate]] (8)
* [[Displaced Corrupted Mementos]] (1000)

==Description==
Welcome back adventurer. I have made a new discovery but I need to test it out. 

Hidden in the Lost areas of the Horrific Visions I believe is a rare black blood coagulate. This might be the key to increasing the power of the corruption effects... in a safe way. 

If you can go into these areas and find this item and also bring me back more displaced corrupted mementos I should be able to increase the potency of the corruption effects.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Greater Rune of the Void Ritual]]
* [[Greater Rune of the Twisted Appendage]]
* [[Greater Rune of Gushing Wound]]
* [[Greater Rune of Infinite Stars]]
* [[Greater Rune of Echoing Void]]
* [[Greater Rune of Twilight Devastation]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}

==Progress==
Were you successful?

==Completion==
Ok, this is promising... the coagulate catalyzes slower so the increased corruption is more contained... yes, this allows a higher yield of corrupted material without any negative side effects.

Alas, I cannot keep it stable for long. These effects will not last. I am sorry adventurer but we should take advantage of the effects while we can. 

Again, if you bring me additional displaced corrupted mementos I can make you more of these greater corruptions.
