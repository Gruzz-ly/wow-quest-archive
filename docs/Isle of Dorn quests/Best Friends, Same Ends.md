==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Shipwright Isaebela.png|Shipwright Isaebela|Isaebela provides the Order of Night with lumber to build their own airships.}}
Eliminate Shipwright Isaebela and Shadowspinner Azarak at [[Silkwood Grotto]].
* [[Shipwright Isaebela]] slain
* [[Shadowspinner Azarak]] slain
*Meet Peacekeeper Leif outside Silkwood Grotto.

==Description==
I saw the shipwright leave the cave and head down to the beach. She was accompanied by a formidable looking [[nerubian]].

The shipwright is the mastermind behind this entire operation. She knows precisely how the [[lumber]] is to be cut and what lumber is needed for their [[Arathi airship|airship]]s.

The nerubians know this and likely assigned one of their best to protect her.

If we can eliminate the shipwright, we can bring all of their carefully laid plans to ruin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*13,000 [[XP]]
*{{cost|56|18}}

==Progress==
Is it done <name>?

==Completion==
With the nerubian leader destroyed, their remaining forces will be in disarray.

Without the shipwright's knowledge and leadership, their entire operation will be crippled.

Let us hope it also drives a wedge between these hopefully former friends.

==Notes==
Completing the quest also awards the "Brotherhood in the Skolzgal Wood" criterion of [[Sojourner of Isle of Dorn]].

Upon accept of both quests:
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|Ugh... Leif... can you help me down the hill? My ribs are killin' me.}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|Of course Kaerter. Let us move slowly and deliberately.}}

Upon engaging the shipwright and the shadowspinner in combat:
:{{text|say|Shipwright Isaebela|I underestimated you. I will not do so again.}}

When you kill Azarak:
:{{text|say|Shadowspinner Azarak|Must... protect... shipwright...}}

When you kill Isaebela:
:{{text|say|Shipwright Isaebela|No! They need... me...}}

Upon returning to Leif and Kaerter:
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|This is so fascinating.}}
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|Look, that's just the basics of the faith. I'm no [[priest]], got it?}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|Got it.}}

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|Leif, you said there are hotsprings up here.}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|Indeed! I can show you my city. You can stay at my home.}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|And perhaps you can tell me how I could become a [[Lamplighter]]? I too want to go forth and help people as you do.}}
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|Alright, we'll talk about it. I know at least one Lamplighter who could use a partner.}}
