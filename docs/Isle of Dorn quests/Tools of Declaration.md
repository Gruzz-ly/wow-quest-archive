==Objectives==
Collect 4 Pristine Horns near [[Restless Estuary]].
*[[Pristine Horn]] (4)

==Description==
As [[Unbound]] caretakers, we have a tradition for when a master bequeaths their mantle to their apprentice.

Figuratively, of course.

To do that, [[Korgran]] will need a horn.

He would then face me, blow the horn, and the sound signifies his passing the mantle of the [[Mourning Rise]] caretaker to me.

I saw [[shalehorn]]s to the west of here. I would be thankful if you could bring me several of their horns. I will choose one that is suitable.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Remember, the horns must be in pristine condition.

==Completion==
These are beautiful!

I feel sorry for the shalehorns, but there are many of them around.

==Notes==
Head back on the way to the coast and kill [[Shalehorn Impaler]]s.

==Progression==
