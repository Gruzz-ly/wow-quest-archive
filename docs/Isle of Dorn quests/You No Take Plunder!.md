==Objectives==
Recover [[earthen]] belongings from piles of plunder.
*[[Earthen Belongings]] (3)

==Description==
It looks like the [[kobold]]s have taken gems and other... body parts off these shutdown earthen.

Abominable.

Find where the kobolds are holding their plunder, and bring it back to me so I can return it to its rightful place later.

This vandalism will not go unchecked!

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find their plunder?

==Completion==
Thank you for doing this.

<Urtago nods to herself with confirmation as she examines the items.>

I am relieved, but there is much more work to do.

==Notes==
Upon accept of both quests:
:{{Text|say|Urtago|I will be waiting up ahead--I know how to sneak past kobolds.}}

Head to the upper section and find [[Pile of Earthen Belongings|Piles of Earthen Belongings]] in the rooms.

Upon meeting with Urtago again:
{{Dialogue|This infestation is worse than I thought!

I didn't want to escalate this, but I see no other way.

These kobolds must learn their lesson and never come back.
