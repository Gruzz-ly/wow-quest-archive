==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Gramwharl.png|Gramwharl|This huge gorloc has killed others of its kind to obtain a glowing and warming titan artifact.}}
Retrieve the artifact from the huge [[gorloc]].
*[[Titan Artifact (Because It's Shiny)]] collected

==Description==
While these two were ordering you around, I thought I would do something useful and make sure the gorlocs were not going to surprise us here on the beach.

None of them seemed interested in us, but then I saw one huge gorloc.

It killed off some smaller gorlocs then took off. It had something glowing in its claw though!

It had to be an artifact. And it looked like it was working! We've got to get it back.

By "we" I mean "you." Larger-than-average gorlocs are above my [[Dragonscale Expedition|Dragonscale]] pay grade.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to get the artifact?

==Completion==
I can hear it humming from here. Ow. It irritates my ears.

Let's see if our two "professionals," Rannan and Tuberros, know what this artifact is.

==Notes==
All three have new gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Tharessa|
I think I'm getting the hang of this. Delegate the hard stuff to someone else, take the artifacts, catalogue them, and then... profit?
}}
{{Dialogue|title=Rannan|
Tharessa is doing a great job so far! I guess I'm not so bad at this "mentoring" thing. I just keep thinking "what would [[Lathos Sunband|Lathos]] have done?"

And, then I'm sad.

But my inner Lathos has never steered me wrong.

{{Dialogue|title=Tuberros|
I needa keep an eye on that kid. I think she's onta me.

Not that I'm against havin' a new business partner, but more partners mean less whiffs for me, you know what I mean?
}}

Head eastward and kill [[Gramwharl]].
