[[File:Lasting Repairs.jpg|thumb|Putting the plan together]]

==Objectives==
Discuss the plan to attack the [[nerubian]]s with [[Baelgrim]].
* Discuss the plan to fight the nerubians

==Description==
With my [[Stormriders]]... inactive, [[Dornogal]] is undefended, save a handful of lay [[peacekeeper]]s. If the nerubians attack us here again, Dornogal will fall--and all of us with it.

It is imperative we draw them away from the city and take out their commander. 

We can and will make our own web and capture [[Queensguard Zirix|Zirix]] in it.

I have a plan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We cannot remain on the defense.

==Completion==
Then it is settled.

We will make our stand at the [[Cinderbrew Meadery]].

==Notes==
Speak with [[Baelgrim]] again:
{{dialogue|class=plainlist|
We cannot trust that the nerubians will keep away from the Coreway once it is repaired.

We must strike at their forces before they can muster another assault.

*{{gossip|quest=|What is the plan?}}
*{{gossip|{{text|red|<Skip conversation>}} You can discuss this amongst yourselves.}}
