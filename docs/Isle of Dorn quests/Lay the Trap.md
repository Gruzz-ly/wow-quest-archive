[[File:Lay the Trap.jpg|thumb|Kegs of cinderbrew ready to go]]

==Objectives==
Connect 4 [[Rope Fuse]]s to [[Sizzling Keg]]s.
* Fuses connected to kegs (4)

==Description==
With all these cinderbrew kegs here, [[Cinderbrew Meadery|this meadery]] would burn hotter than the [[Forgegrounds]] if they were all ignited.

I surmise that's why [[Wenbrandt]]'s kegs are made out of stout and strong [[ironwood]]--they do not break or catch fire easily. 

Luckily, we can start a reaction from the inside if we lead fuses into each of them.

Those ropes the workers left around should work in a pinch.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We need to get the cinderbrew kegs prepared.

==Completion==
[[Queensguard Zirix|Zirix]] will fall by my hand. It is my directive. It is my will.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Evacuation Area]] before heading out. On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Wenbrandt|Are you sure this will work, Baelgrim?}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|It will. It has to.}}
:{{text|say|[[Adelgonn]]|Then let's get started.}}

Head north into the [[Meadyard]] and either use the [[Meadery Ladder]]s or fly up on top of the barrel piles, interact with the [[Rope Fuse]]s, then run them to the [[Sizzling Keg]]s near the base of the ladders. 

==Progression==
{{The First Blow}}
