==Objectives==
Search [[Woldkeeper Freydrin|Freydrin]]'s home for help against the [[fungarian]]s in [[Boskroot Basin]].
* Freydrin's Hovel investigated
* Urn searched
* Freydrin's memory heard
* Pledge read
* [[Freydrin's Shillelagh]]

==Description==
Freydrin must have had some way of fending off the fungarians.

Although there are few left in the countryside who still follow the Edicts. Freydrin was long a true believer. She would never have allowed these woods to reach this state while she held faith.

We should take a look at her home in the woods. Perhaps there is something that may prove useful inside.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Looking through the Woldkeeper's things unnerves me. So many untold stories.

==Completion==
This staff holds a familiar magic I had hoped to forget. Oh Freydrin, what happened here?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Woldtender Igris|I pray Freydrin's hovel will have what we need. Meet me there!}}
:''Igris runs off.''

Enter the house and look on the shelves for a [[Fine Earthen Urn]], next to plushies of [[Mr. Munchykins]], [[Mayor Striggs (object)|Mayor Striggs]], and [[Trunksy]]:
{{book|content=
<The fine craftsmanship in this clay pot is betrayed by the odor of rotting tree bark stored in it.

This is not what you are looking for.>}}

By the forge is a [[Dusty Memory Gem]]. Interact with it and a vision of Freydrin runs in:
:{{text|say|Woldkeeper Freydrin|Final offering. I can wait no longer. We are abandoned.}}
:{{text|say|Woldkeeper Freydrin|These woods will have to hold without me. Goodbye.}}
:{{text|emote|The memory of Freydrin removes her memory gem and shuts down abruptly.}}
:{{text|say|Woldtender Igris|Final offering? Oh. Hmm.}}

Downstairs to the east is [[Oathbinder's Pledge]]:
{{book|content=
<This stone banner would have once hung proudly outside of this home as a pledge to the Keepers and their edicts. 

Now it is a symbol of a broken memory and an empty promise.>}}

Nearby is [[Freydrin's Shillelagh]]:
:{{text|say|Woldtender Igris|That should do it. I feel an old presence in that staff. Bring it here!}}
