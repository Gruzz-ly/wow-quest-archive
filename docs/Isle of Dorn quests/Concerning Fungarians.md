Log Entry: 235-18-7<br>
Date: Fabrication Quarter Cycle

Observation: Fungarians exhibit accelerated growth and increased territorial aggression. Spore dispersal seems to have quadrupled compared to previous recorded rates.

==Rewards==
You will receive:

The notes are all within the building. Head upstairs to find more Discarded Research Notes, which are [[Log Entry 467-21-5]] and [[Log Entry 652-12-3]]. The third entry, [[Log Entry 893-03-9]], is held by the [[Mossbloom Hazewalker]] fungarian at the top of the building.

The notes read:

{{dialogue|title=Log Entry: 467-21-5|Log Entry 467-21-5<br>
Date: Reclamation Quarter Cycle

Observation: Mycelium expansion noted at an alarming rate, infiltrating neighboring vegetation. Fungarians display a heightened response to environmental stimuli, showcasing a potential shift in their ecological behavior.}}

{{dialogue|title=Log Entry 652-12-3|Log Entry 652-12-3:<br>
Date: Storage Quarter Cycle

Notation: Fungarians demonstrate aggressive mycorrhizal interactions, outcompeting nearby fungal species. The accelerated growth raises concerns about potential ecological imbalances in the affected area.}}

{{dialogue|title=Log Entry 893-03-9|Log Entry 893-03-9:<br>
Date: Repair Quarter Cycle

Observation: Fungarians now spreading beyond the initial study site. Aggressive mycelial intrusion observed in unexpected habitats. Urgent investigation needed to assess the broader ecological impact of this newfound behavior. Evacuation is recommended, and research activities are temporarily halted for the safety of all involved.
