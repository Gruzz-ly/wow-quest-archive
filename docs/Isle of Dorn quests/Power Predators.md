==Objectives==
Cull 10 predators around [[Rambleshire]].
* Mosswool predators slain (10)

==Description==
[[Thunderhead Peak]] normally boasts a perpetual storm from which the local [[mosswool]]s draw energy. Without it, the poor dears look to be listless and near dead on their feet. That makes them easy pickings for predators.

To get moss production back on track, we'll need to get to the bottom of the missing storm. But first we need to beat back these predators before they turn the mosswools to gravel.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Please do what you can for the poor mosswools.

==Completion==
That should buy the ranchers and their flocks some time while we figure out what's going on with the missing storm. No storm means no moss, which means grumpy storm rooks.

According to the locals, the storm is born of two legendary rams butting heads atop Thunderhead Peak. They think one of them went missing, if you can believe that.

==Notes==
;Upon picking up this quest and [[Sleepy Sheep]]
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|I'll head into the village to find someone who knows what's going on with the storm. The lack of one, rather.}}
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|Shraubendre, stay here for now. I don't want you spooking the livestock.}}
:''Lufsela starts walking toward the ranch.''

Valid targets include [[Stormtop Shalemaw]]s, [[Stormtop Shalemaw Young]], and [[Stormtop Terralisk]]s.

;Upon approach
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|You're telling me the storm's gone on account of a missing ram?}}
:{{Text|say|Head Rancher Stenspor|Not just any ram!}}
