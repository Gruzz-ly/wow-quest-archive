==Objectives==
Aid 7 survivors of the [[Dalaran]] crash.
*Crash survivors aided (7)
*[[Dalaran Civilian]]s healed (5) (Optional)

==Description==
We survived mostly unharmed. Not everyone was so lucky.

Many who were in Dalaran when it went down are unaccounted for. They will need our help.

Search the battlefield for survivors. Help them in any way you can.

We need everyone up and fighting!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must save everyone we can.

==Completion==
It is good to know many survived.

When this battle is over, we will recover the bodies of those who did not.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Slay the Saboteurs]] from [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]] before heading out. On accept of both:
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|We have to push forward, or we'll be slaughtered!}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Rescue who you can along the way!}}

The survivors are [[Brann Bronzebeard]], [[Moira Thaurissan]], [[Dagran Thaurissan II]], [[Archmage Aethas Sunreaver]], [[Ritssyn Flamescowl]], [[Marin Noggenfogger]], and [[Meryl Felstorm]]. They are all marked on the minimap.

Marin Noggenfogger is found with a few [[Envenomed Contractor]]s, some of whom are dead, a [[Recovering Contractor]] and several [[Underbelly Bruiser]]s. Marin, who is busy gutting a [[Nerubian Saboteur]], has the following buff: {{Abilities|Extracting Venom Glands|id=437318|Extracting venom glands from a dead nerubian.|icon=ability_rogue_poisonedknife}}
:{{Text|say|Marin Noggenfogger|Hey, you! Give out these antidotes! I'm guttin' venom sacs fast as I can!}} -or- {{ClassIcon|Rogue}} {{text|say|Shadowblade! Give out these antidotes! I'm guttin' venom sacs fast as I can!}}
Loot the [[Hastily-Prepared Antidote]] near him to toss it to an [[Envenomed Contractor]] in the area, who becomes [[Recovering Contractor]].

[[Dagran Thaurissan II]] and [[Moira Thaurissan]] are trapped under a [[Tower Fragment]]:
:{{Text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Help! I cannae... move!}}
Interact with it to free them:
:{{Text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Dagran! Are ye all right?}}
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Yes, thanks to gran'da teachin' me stoneform. Wait, where is he?}}
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|We've got tae find him!}}
:{{Text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Dagran! Wait!}}
:''Moira and Dagran run away.''

;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver
:{{Text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|No mana... I cannot...}}
Aethas is Drained and almost entirely out of mana. Interact with the [[Sunreaver Satchel]] near him:
:{{Text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|Much better. Now, there is work to be done!}}

He starts [[Erratic Artifacts]]. Pick it up before moving on, or leave it in order to also complete [[Shattered Spires]].

;Brann Bronzebeard
Interact with the [[Polymorphed Victim]] in front of Aethas Sunreaver to dispel the polymorph.
:{{Text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Thank ye, champion. I got the wool pulled over my eyes--literally!}}

;Meryl Felstorm
:{{Text|say|Meryl Felstorm|You there! Help me stabilize this portal! Quickly!}} -or- {{ClassIcon|Mage}} {{text|say|Archmage <name>, help me stabilize this portal! Quickly!}} / {{text|say|<Name>, help me stabilize this portal! Quickly!}}
Interact with the [[Dalaran Power Shard]]:
:{{Text|say|Meryl Felstorm|Excellent! My arcane guardians will hold this area. Help the others!}}

;Ritssyn Flamescowl
[[Ritssyn Flamescowl]] is found dead, impaled on a spike of a gateway near a group of [[Surviving Warlock]]s. Interact with [[Rittsyn's Soulstone]]{{Sic}} on the ground to revive him. The nearby [[Soulwell (Isle of Dorn)|Soulwell]] can be interacted with for an [[Emergency Healthstone]].
:{{Text|say|Ritssyn Flamescowl|That... always stings. Get moving! I'll take care of the wounded here.}} -or- {{ClassIcon|Warlock}} {{text|say|That... always stings. Get moving, Netherlord! I'll take care of the wounded here.}}

On completion of all three:
:''Anduin Wrynn runs up.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Jaina! Thrall! We need help! Magni is in trouble.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Anduin! You're alive!}}

Healing Dalaran Civilians, either through [[healing]] abilities or interacting with them, grants the character {{abilities|Sense of Duty|id=439556|icon=achievement_dungeon_gloryofthehero}}, increasing their [[Haste]] and [[Speed]] by 5%, stacking up to five times.
