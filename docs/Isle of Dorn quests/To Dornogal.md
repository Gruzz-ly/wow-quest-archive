==Objectives==
Meet Baelgrim in Dornogal by following the Stormrider's Slipstream.

Most services in Dornogal will be unavailable during this quest.
*[[Trained Stormrook]] mounted (Optional)
*Slipstream followed (10) (Optional)
*Meet [[Baelgrim]] in [[Dornogal]]

==Description==
You have brought death and destruction to our shores the likes of which has not been seen in millennia.

But you have [[nerubian]] blood on your hands and a [[thraegar]] at your side. This is enough to earn my trust--for now.

My [[Stormriders]] and I must return to our capital, Dornogal, and investigate what is likely an ongoing attack there. Fly with us. Our slipstream will allow you to soar through the skies with ease.

I will send other Stormriders to collect your allies once it is safe for them to land.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What have the nerubians wrought? And why?

:{{Text|say|Baelgrim|The Edicts mandate that I defend the [[Coreway]]. I must return to Dornogal.}}
:{{Text|say|Baelgrim|My Stormriders will gather the rest of the survivors. Now, take flight!}}
:''They fly off.''

Either hop on a [[mount]] capable of [[skyriding]] and manually fly to Dornogal, or choose the [[Trained Stormrook]] and take the very slow taxi there:
:This stormrook will take you to Dornogal, but it flies very slowly.

:Do you want to mount it?

Flying through the rings refills [[Vigor (game resource)]].

Catch up with [[Baelgrim]] atop the tower in Dornogal, where he's overlooking the [[nerubian]] attack on the city!
