==Objectives==
Meet [[Rannan Korren|Rannan]] at The [[Three Shields]].

==Description==
Our [[merchant]] friend told us about some small islands off the northeast coast called "The Three Shields."

Apparently, there was a lot of [[titan]] activity there long ago. To me, the "activity" sounded like titan research and development. Exciting stuff!

[[Tuberros]] and I are going there to check it out. [[Tharessa Sunstrand|Tharessa]], my new [[Algari Expedition|Algari]] trainee, is coming along to see true professionals at work.

Care to join us?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
All right, I'm fine. It's just a scratch. 

But it took the three of us to bring down one little gorloc, so it's good you decided to join us.

==Notes==
Upon approach in Rambleshire:
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|If what that merchant said checks out, landing here may be the best thing that's happened to us!}}
:{{text|say|Tharessa Sunstrand|Landed? We crashed and almost drowned! You call that the "best thing?"}}
:{{text|say|Tuberros|We're still gonna find somethin' shiny, right?}}

All three have gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Rannan Korren|"Join us on Dalaran," they said. "It will be great," they said.

Good thing I can swim! Tubes almost drowned me trying to carry him to safe land! He latched himself to my back.

"Just dig through the water!"

Oh well, we lived.

I feel bad for everyone who is stranded here now, but the least we can do is make the best of it.

{{Dialogue|title=Tuberros|I'm a little shaken up, but this place is nice.

Lots of new smells. It makes me want to go back home to Perisimona.

But even if ya got love, you still gotta eat. So here I am with the boss making money for grubs.

We'll discover something, I just know it. It's going to be fat tubers and worms from here on out!

Shh! Don't tell Rannan though. I'm here for "history" or whatever like everyone else!
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Tharessa Sunstrand|Greetings! Nice to meet you!

I am Tharessa, Rannan's new Algari Expedition trainee. I'm super excited to be here.

Even though... you know.

I am very into titan technology, and Rannan and Tuberros have a reputation for dealing with that "stuff" as Rannan calls it. I really want to see some of it up close!

And it looks like I will! Even if it took a city crash-landing to do it...

{{Gossip|Aren't you a little young for an Algari Expeditioner?}}

{{Dialogue-child|<Tharessa looks uneasy for a moment.>

Uh, how could you tell? Don't tell anyone, but I told the expedition recruiters I was two hundred years old.

<Tharessa smiles, holding in a chuckle.>

Drop a zero out of that, and you will get the right answer.

Especially, don't tell Rannan. For some reason, he has a very high opinion of elves.

He keeps assuming I'm older and understand the science of what he's talking about. But honestly? No clue.

Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Tuberros|I hope these shiny artifacts are worth somethin'.}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|Really Tubes? Not in front of Tharessa. I thought we talked about this.}}
:{{text|emote|Tharessa raises an eyebrow.}}
:{{text|say|Tharessa Sunstrand|Talked about what?}}

Arriving at the [[Three Shields]] to find Rannan lying down. Next to him is a dead [[Shimmerfin Scrapper]]:
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|Ow! I've been wounded! Are [[gorloc]] claws venomous? Medic! Medic!}}
:{{Text|say|Tharessa Sunstrand|You tripped and hit your head. The gorloc didn't even touch you.}}
:{{Text|say|Tuberros|Yeah, Tharessa and I took out the gorloc.}}
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|Well I... distracted it. Shh! You're making me look bad in front of <name>.}}
