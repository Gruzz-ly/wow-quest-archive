==Objectives==
Return to Merrix in Dornogal.
* Return to [[Merrix]] in [[Dornogal]]

==Description==
We dealt a heavy blow to the [[nerubian]]s. But [[Baelgrim]]...

<[[Adelgonn]] pauses to compose herself.>

He was infuriatingly rigid and we argued ceaselessly, but in the end... he was a defender of our people--all of them.

Baelgrim sacrificed himself to vouchsafe the [[Isle of Dorn]] from the nerubians. Everyone needs to know that--and we can't let the nerubians force our hand like that again.

Go back to Merrix in Dornogal. Tell him we will come soon. We just... need a moment here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You are alive! But what of the others?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|I... the Coreway's repairs must continue. It's what Baelgrim would have wanted.}}
:{{text|emote|Wenbrandt nods in solemn silence.}}

Here, [[Adelgonn]] has gossip and dialogue:
{{dialogue|Our people must know what Baelgrim did for us.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:''Adelgonn stands up.''
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|Baelgrim and I were rivals. We both became wards at the same time.}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|Each of us weighed our accomplishments and accolades against the others. Whom had the [[titan]]s favored more?}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|But we were like two [[ram]]s in a yoke, pulling together--him with his stormrooks, me with my quarry and forge.}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|Dornogal needed us both in equal measure.}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|But it all started to... fall apart. The Coreway, the Archive... There began a time of despair as we pieced everything together.}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|I saw what it was doing to our people. And so did Baelgrim.}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|My logic led me away from the titans. His said we needed them more than ever.}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|I thought he would never forgive me for leaving him alone, yoked to Dornogal, but in the end...}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|If the both of us weren't so thick-headed, I can't help but think we could have avoided his fate.}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|Dornogal has lost its protector, and I've lost... a friend.}}
:''Adelgonn kneels.''

Back at the [[Coreway]] outside the [[Archive]], [[Merrix]], [[Speaker Brinthe]], [[Moira Thaurissan]], [[Dagran Thaurissan II]], [[Magni Bronzebeard]], and [[Anduin Wrynn]] are looking on:
:{{text|say|Merrix|I see you return alone, <name>. I presume not all went well.}}

Characters have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Merrix|With the help of Adelgonn's workers, the major repairs on the Coreway's machinery are complete.

Titans willing, it will soon be fully functional once again.}}

{{dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|Do not be lulled into a false sense of victory, <name>. [[Xal'atath]] yet lives.

So long as she schemes in the shadows, the safety we've secured here is fleeting... just as it was in [[Dalaran]].

While [[Anduin]] and the [[earthen]] tend to our wounded, I will protect them the way I know best.

<Alleria clenches her fist.>

By slaughtering all who threaten us.}}

{{dialogue|title=Moira Thaurissan|Greetings, champion.}}
