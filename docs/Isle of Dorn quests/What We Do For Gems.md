==Objectives==
Collect 4 elemental cores from the [[Igneous Elemental|Igneous Sand elementals]].
* [[Igneous Core|Elemental Cores]] collected (4)

==Description==
According to the [[earthen]], we have to lure the spirit. Or disturb it. Or something.

The four [[Standing Stone|standing stones]] they mentioned have depleted [[elemental]] cores laying around them. There are [[Igneous Elemental|igneous elementals]] outside and on the beach to the north. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

Could you get me elemental cores? Maybe just a few? We're so close, so we might as well try...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the cores?

==Completion==
Four cores for four standing stones.

I am ready when you are.

==Progression==
{{Gems Are Forever}}
