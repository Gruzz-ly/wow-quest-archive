==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Grand-Heister Bokk.png|Grand-Heister Bokk|Grand-Heister Bokk does nothing but sing, take the best candles, and eat lots of cheese.}}
Slay Grand-Heister Bokk.
*[[Grand-Heister Bokk]] slain {{co|62.4|38.6|Isle of Dorn}}
*Talk to [[Urtago]]
*Return to Urtago in Fallside Outpost.

==Description==
While you were dealing with the tunnels and the workmasters, I saw a peculiar kobold go into a cave to the northwest. The [[Kobold]]s seemed to respect him more than the others, calling him Grand-Heister Bokk and offering him the food you call "cheese." This makes me think he is the real mastermind.

If that kobold is in fact the real Ward of this operation, then we should take the opportunity to strike him down.

I will meet you at this cave.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I am happy to see you, <name>.

I feel my inner workings grinding--that's a sign of anxiety. [[Korgran]] nears his shutdown with every passing moment, and then this place will be under my care.

It is a lot of responsibility. But I believe that I am ready for it.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Urtago|I will scout ahead and meet you by the cave.}}
:''Urtago stealth and heads out.''

Upon reaching the cave:
:{{text|say|Urtago|This is the cave I told you about. He's just inside!}}

Upon approach:
*{{Text|say|Grand-Heister Bokk|Cheese, cheese! Who moved my cheese?!}}
*{{Text|say|Grand-Heister Bokk|Candle candle on my head, who's the best kobold you ever had?}}
*{{text|say|Grand-Heister Bokk|Tam, ta-da dee-dam, give me some of that waxy cheese in a yam!}}

Upon engaging Grand-Heister Bokk:
:{{text|say|Grand-Heister Bokk|Dead earthen don't need loot! It belongs to me!}}

Upon slaying Grand-Heister Bokk:
:{{text|say|Grand-Heister Bokk|Greedy earthen keep loot for themselves.}}

Go back outside and talk with Urtago:
{{Dialogue|I can't believe it got this far.

{{Gossip|quest=|It is done.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Urtago|So much death. I am glad this is over.}}
:{{text|say|Urtago|Meet me back at [[Fallside Outpost]]. I hope Korgran is all right.}}
:''Urtago walks away.''

Upon meeting Urtago and [[Korgran]] back at the house:
:{{text|say|Korgran|Mourning Rise is a sad place and not where I would like to have my final shutdown.}}
:{{text|say|Urtago|But Mourning's Rise is the traditional place for final shutdowns.}}
:{{text|say|Korgran|Did we become [[Unbound]] from the [[Titan]]s just to be bound by traditions?}}
