'''Hope, An Anomaly''' concludes an optional chapter of the [[Isle of Dorn storyline]], started in [[Freywold Village]].

==Objectives==
Make a piece of pottery with [[Hreka]].
*Ore placed in forge
*[[Ball of Clay]] moulded
*[[Unfired Pot]] picked up
*Unfired Pot placed in forge

==Description==
<Hreka looks through the things you retrieved, one by one.>

So you risked your life to find our friend.

[[Modhina]] is gone, then. Her notes are about the rare ore from the cave. Melted down, it becomes a beautiful glaze for pottery.

What can I do? I'm no fighter. I can't avenge her. Besides, her body has already been reclaimed by the earth. That much is certain by the state of her memory gem fragment.

What can I do now, but make a pot? Will you help me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]
*5x [[Hreka's Pot-Making Kit]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+500 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) (first time) or 25x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
A lifetime spent making pottery. Is this my titan given fate? Then why do I still wonder?

==Completion==
Almost done. It needs a bit of time in the fire to set.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Hreka|Place the ore here for smelting.}}
:''Hreka walks over to the forge.''

Interact with the ghost Forge Vessel to place the ore:
:{{text|say|Hreka|While I smelt this, will you try moulding the ball of clay on the table?}}

Interact with the Ball of Clay on the table to start a long channel:
:{{text|say|Hreka|Don't overthink it. Go with the flow. Trust your hands.}}
:{{text|say|Hreka|The ore has melted into a glaze. I will now apply it. Keep doing what you're doing.}}
:{{text|say|Hreka|There! Now place it in the forge for firing.}}

Pick up the Unfired Pot and place it in the forge.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Hreka|Let's see.}}
:{{text|say|Hreka|...Hm. Wobbly edges.}}
:{{text|say|Hreka|An asymmetrical, oblong body.}}
:{{text|say|Hreka|And the glaze looks too dry, it will crack. I need more practice smelting this new ore.}}
:{{text|say|Kodun|Hreka...}}
:{{text|say|Hreka|Thank you, <name>. I have not felt this depth of gratitude before.}}
:{{text|say|Hreka|I will return with new pottery, Kodun. We won't let Modhina's efforts be in vain.}}
:''Hreka walks away.''

Hreka and Kodun have new gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Hreka|I have spent my lifetime making pottery for the earthen. My results remained perfect and limited, just as the titans intended.

Until you came along. Look at the pot we made together.

It's colorful. It's fragile. It's imperfect, and unique to you.

Modhina gave her life to give mine more meaning. I hope I can find it. It's why Adelgonn created the Unbound. We live to break free.}}

{{dialogue|title=Kodun|Thank you for bringing us closure. We will remember Modhina.

All these years, and the greatest changes of our lives happen in a single day.

Your city crashing onto our shores. Our people meeting the outside world for the first time. Our ancient enemies inflicting devastation throughout the isle. The broken earthen, speaking once more.

These are the signs that we Unbound have been looking for, ever since we split from the Oathsworn.

There are so many things kept from us... I think we have only scratched the crust of the earth.}}

Nearby [[Hreka]] is the [[Glazed Pot]] you made together:
{{book|Glazed Pot|content=<Just as Hreka pointed out, the pot is far from perfect.

But, you notice the satisfying roundness that you had paid extra attention to. You notice a thicker lip from where you had applied less pressure.

You remember the comforting smoothness of the wet clay between your hands, and Hreka's gratitude.>}}

Completing this quest awards the "Hope, An Anomaly" criterion of [[Sojourner of Isle of Dorn]].
