* Waygate activated
* Waygate used

==Description==
After me da' did whatever he did, the [[titan]]s machines are back online--even the ones here in Dornogal.

Dagran was havin' enough fun with Brinthe askin' her a thousand questions, but now he's helpin' her sort through the Archive.

An' now he wants your help. He was too excited to tell me why, but he wanted ye to meet him in the Archive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Fascinating. This is clearly a chamber meant for a Keeper. But for what? 

We need to investigate.

==Notes and trivia==
[[Moira Thaurissan]] has gossip upon accepting the quest:
{{dialogue|title=Moira Thaurissan|Greetings, champion.}}

Speak with Dagran inside:
{{Dialogue|title=Dagran Thaurissan II|I cannae believe the Archive is back online--an' that this ancient transporter is active again!

Brinthe and I are both keen tae find out where it goes.

Guess there's one way to find out! 

Are ye ready tae go with us?

{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready.}}}}
:{{Text|say|Speaker Brinthe|I have validated a destination for the teleporter. Activate it when you are ready, <name>.}}

The [[Deactivated Waygate]] on the floor, well, activates:

{{Dialogue|<At first glance, the teleporter pad appears dormant, its surface still and quiet. Yet, a subtle hum emanates from within as it rotates slowly.>

{{gossip|quest=|<Gently tap the center of the waypoint.>}}}}

:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|It works! Oh, I hope it's more books or gems... Let's go!}}

Take the Waygate, which drops players off in the [[Vault of Memory (Isle of Dorn)|Vault of Memory]] alongside Dagran and Brinthe:
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|It's a titan vault! And it's... just like the Chamber of Heart?}}

Inside, Dagran and Brinthe have new gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Dagran Thaurissan|Brinthe an' I have been through a lot together, haven't we?

At first I was just curious about this isle an' the earthen.

But now I feel as if she's part o' me family!}}

{{dialogue|title=High Speaker Brinthe|Yes?}}

The quest's name is the catchphrase of Kelsier, one of the principal characters of ''{{wp|Mistborn}}''.
