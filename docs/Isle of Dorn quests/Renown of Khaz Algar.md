==Objectives==
Speak with [[Faerin Lothar]] in [[Dornogal]].

==Description==
There is still much we still need tae do to aid [[Khaz Algar]].

But I dunnae know much about this land past the realms of [[earthen]].

I'll have to refer ye to Faerin Lothar tae see what [[Hallowfall]] may need.

Talk to her an' see if she needs any help. Ye already are acquainted, aren't ye?

==Completion==
Good to see you again, <name>.

We have a lot of work to do.

==Notes==
Catch up with Faerin near the Dornogal flight master and inn:

{{Dialogue|Greetings, friend.

I'm here for a short while to help continue rebuilding our relationship with the earthen. Brinthe has come as well, representing the Machine Speakers. I've been learning so much from her!

Our talks are going well! Though I'm having some trouble keeping down their "mead." Strong stuff!}}
