Trade the Vial of Liquid Opal for the Speakeasy Passrune from [[Bevrusi]].
* [[Speakeasy Passrune|Trade for the Speakeasy Passrune]]
*Meet Merrix in the Stoneshaper's Atrium.
* [[Vial of Liquid Opal]] (provided)

==Description==
You have certainly made my disaster of a day far less stressful, <name>.

For that, you have the thanks of the entire [[Forgegrounds]] and those who keep it running.

<[[Vokgret]] winks as she gives you a knowing smile.>

Bevrusi was right to send you to me. Do tell her not to be a stranger now. I could use more friends from the [[Ringing Deeps|Deeps]].

Here is her liquid opal. Give it to her with my compliments.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 5,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Everyone in the city is in need of something, and there is always someone with the means to acquire it.

==Completion==
I send you to a [[Machine Speakers|Machine Speaker]] to get us into the speakeasy, and you wind up aiding the market reeve of the Forgegrounds in some roundabout delivery and trading operation?

<Merrix smirks coyly as he claps his heavy stone hands in applause. It is a much quieter sound than you would imagine.>

Well done, my resourceful outlander.

==Notes==
[[Vokgret]] has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|You're quite skilled at this market business, you know?

Perhaps you might entertain a change in profession one day.
}}

Go back to Bevrusi and trade with her:
:{{Text|say|Bevrusi|Vokgret came through, huh? A trade's a trade, <name>! Here's the passrune, but you didn't get it from me.}}
