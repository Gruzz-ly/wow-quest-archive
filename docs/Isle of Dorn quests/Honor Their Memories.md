==Objectives==
Eliminate the kobold infestation and place gifts near the shut-down, past caretakers.
*[[Deck of Cards]] placed
*[[Earthen Figurine]] placed
*[[Precious Gem]] placed
*[[Kobold]] Infestation dealt with (0/100%)

==Description==
Take these gifts and place them by the past caretakers. Each is a gift honoring their memory.

I'd also like us to perform some light groundskeeping to at least maintain the site. Unfortunately, what these kobolds are doing to the memorials will take us weeks to fix.

Please do what you can about the kobolds. It would be unwise to leave the gifts unguarded while they are still roaming the area.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The kobolds cannot be left to desecrate Mourning Rise.

The [[Unbound]] that rest here are here because they do not want to be disturbed or moved. While they do not wish to be revived, taking their armor and possessions is an insult to earthen culture.

We must do something.

==Completion==
I am amazed how much damage the kobolds have done to the site. So many shut-down earthen desecrated!

I know that I am not yet the head caretaker, but I take full responsibility for this. I should have asked for the mantle of caretaker long ago when [[Korgran]] started to show the first signs of memory overwrite and stasis lock.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Urtago|We have to deal with these kobolds and place gifts before we can move forward.}}

Near Urtago is a [[Mourning Rise Monument]] that reads:
{{Book|title=Mourning Rise Monument|content=
To commemorate and honor Kriegval, we Caretakers, Nattar and Dorgad, declare this place as Mourning Rise.

For those who wish to forever free themselves from the cycle of the Machine.

For those who do not wish for their freedom to be unmade after shutdown.

For those who wish to live their final cycle unburdened and unshackled without fear.

Let this rise cradle those who embrace it as their final shutdown site.

Mourn their passing but rise to freedom.

- Caretaker Nattar and Caretaker Dorgad
}}

Fill the bar by killing [[Candlelit Desecrator]]s and [[Candlelit Pebblemaker]]s.

Place the gifts near the dead earthen. Below each one is a [[Mourning Rise Epitaph]]:
{{Book|content=
<The earthen above the plaque was wearing Stormrider armor, but most of it has been removed by force. The earthen has also been bashed in the face by a blunt object.>

In remembrance of Caretaker Bagdur:

Once a celebrated Stormrider, she was discharged from their ranks when she turned away from Oathsworn beliefs. A lover of fine cinderbrew and gems, she was as ardent a Stormrider as she was a Caretaker.}}

{{Book|content=
<This plaque looks older than the others and so does the earthen standing above it. 

Even so, the cracks on his head and belt seem recent as do a missing parts of his leg and gems.>

In Remembrance of Caretaker Radok: 

Struck down while protecting Mourning Rise from nerubians, he was beloved by all his sector. Known as a brave fighter, he was no fiercer than when he played his favorite card game, "Resonance."

There will always be an empty chair for him at his sector's gaming table.}}

{{Book|content=
<This shutdown earthen has noticeable damage all over his body. There is new damage on his left arm where gems are missing from his bracer.>

In Remembrance of Caretaker Okdan:

Known by his unit of friends for striking a victorious pose when he won an argument. May he rest victoriously as well.}}
