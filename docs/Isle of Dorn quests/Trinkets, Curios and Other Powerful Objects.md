==Objectives==
[[File:Bag of Stolen Goods.jpg|thumb|Bag of Stolen Goods]]
Reclaim stolen [[Kirin Tor]] artifacts from the [[kobold]]s in the [[Mourning Rise]].
*[[Stolen Kirin Tor Artifacts]] collected (15)
*[[Arcane Manuscript]]s found (5)

==Description==
The kobolds here could get up to untold mischief with the items they have stolen.

Take what you can back from them by... whatever means you see fit.

While you deal with the kobolds around Mourning Rise's grave sites, I will go underground and search [[Kriegval's Rest]] and do the same.

Meet me near Kriegval's Rest when you have secured the Kirin Tor artifacts the kobolds stole.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
We must search and reclaim what we can. Even the smallest curio could be meaningful to someone... or dangerous.

==Completion==
I am shocked to see how much they managed to pilfer in such a short time.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|I must admit, the sight of Dalaran reduced to rubble overwhelmed me.}}
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|Though I put on a strong front for Aethas, I... need a distraction. Something else to focus on.}}
:''Kalecgos runs off.''

Slay the [[Candlelit Desecrator]]s and [[Candlelit Pebblemaker]]s to collect the [[Stolen Kirin Tor Artifacts]] and collect the Arcane Manuscripts from the Stolen Bag of Goods.

Interact with the [[Kobold Thief]] to begin the [[Mysterious Necklace]] quest.

On return:
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|<Name>, did you find anything?}}

==Progression==
{{Fate of the Kirin Tor}}
