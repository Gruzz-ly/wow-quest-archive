==Objectives==
[[File:Lessons in Defensive Magic.jpg|thumb|An Arcane Ward]]
Help [[Aethas Sunreaver]] cast a spell to create a protective [[arcane]] dome in the [[Tranquil Strand]].
*First Ward activated {{co|29.4|58.1|Isle of Dorn}}
*Second Ward activated {{co|29.6|57.5|Isle of Dorn}}
*Third Ward activated {{co|30.0|57.9|Isle of Dorn}}
*Fourth Ward activated {{co|29.8|58.5|Isle of Dorn}}
*Spell empowered

==Description==
The spell for the barrier is ready, but I must channel it and define its perimeter.

While I channel the spell, take these wards and place them at the edges of our would-be barrier.

We will empower the spell when you are finished.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
The last few days have been... difficult.

==Completion==
<Aethas inhales.>

Yes. This will do... for now.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Aethas Sunreaver|Place the wards on the ground, <name>. I will channel the barrier.}}

Aethas moves to a small rock, and has new gossip:
{{dialogue|I'll be fine, <name>.}}
 
Activate the four wards:
:{{Text|Say|Aethas Sunreaver|To me, it seems the Kirin Tor continue to make the same mistakes.}}
:{{Text|Say|Aethas Sunreaver|If fate has brought Dalaran low twice, maybe it should not be rebuilt.}}
:{{Text|Say|Aethas Sunreaver|For all the ground we gain, we lose people... and history.}}
:{{Text|Say|Aethas Sunreaver|Now, <name>! Use the Frostfire Essence to seal the barrier.}}

Use the extra action button to activate the [[Frostfire Essence]] and empower the spell:
:{{Text|Say|Aethas Sunreaver|That...will do. I think I may need a moment to catch my breath.}}

==Progression==
{{Fate of the Kirin Tor}}
