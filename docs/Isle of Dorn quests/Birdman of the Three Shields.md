==Objectives==
Find [[Olbarig]] on the [[Three Shields]].

==Description==
Are you here to watch the [[mosswool]]s? No?

That's too bad. I find the [[elemental]] creatures on our isle fascinating. I'm not the only one.

An old friend of mine named Olbarig resides out on the Three Shields. He studies the wild [[cloudrook]]s there.

But come to think of it, I haven't heard from him in awhile. Maybe someone should check on him. Hm. Would you mind?

;Dialogue if completed [[To Wake a Giant]]
Well, hey! It's you again, <name>.

Shame I don't have any elementals for you to get in shape...

But I do have another favor to ask you, if you're up for it.

A friend of mine, Olbarig, lives out at Three Shields. He studies the wild cloudrooks there, and he and I talk about them from time to time.

But I haven't heard from him in a long time. Would you check on him for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|2|25}}
*2,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Harmot sent you to check on me? 

Huh. Well, I didn't know that sack of charcoal cared.

But he does have an innate sense of when elementals are in turmoil. Maybe he knew something was brewing out here.

Harmot's timing is good, outlander. And your aid would be most welcome.
