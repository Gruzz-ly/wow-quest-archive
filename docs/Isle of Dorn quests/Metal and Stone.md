==Objectives==
Equip earthen trainees for battle.
*[[Earthen Trainee]]s armed (10)

==Description==
While some of these recruits struggle with discipline, most have a strong work ethic. They only need training and the equipment to make the most of it.

[[Earthen]] weaponsmiths and armorers have been working around the clock to equip this fledgling army. But we could use some help getting the new armaments into the hands of these trainees.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Algari Heavy Axe]]
* [[Algari Mace]]
* [[Algari Shield]]
* [[Algari Dagger]]
* [[Algari Censer]]
* [[Algari Warglaive]]
* [[Algari Hatchet]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Check in with [[Vindicator Jaelaana]]. She is in charge of distributing the weapons though she can be rather stingy. Be sure she doesn't send too many off for hand-to-hand training.

==Completion==
Now they're starting to look like a real army. We'll continue with their training, but I believe you have more important matters to attend to.

==Notes==
On accept of both, if Alliance:
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|Pay attention, orc. Watch one of the Alliance's best at work.}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Oh! Will they also talk the enemy to death?}}
:{{text|emote|Adelgonn sighs.}}

If Horde:
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|You're in luck, Exarch. You get to see how the Horde gets things done.}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|I see more than you know.}} 
:{{text|emote|Adelgonn sighs.}}
