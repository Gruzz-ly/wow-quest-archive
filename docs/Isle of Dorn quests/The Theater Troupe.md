==Description==
Since you're an honorary member of the theater troupe, <name>, what do you think about playing a part in our plays?

No big parts--I don't want to upset the rest of the troupe by taking away their limelight. You know how they are.

Are you available, say, once a week?

You will receive:
*[[Theater Troupe's Trove]]
*+1000 [[Council of Dornogal]]
*200 [[Resonance Crystals]]
*[[Hellcaller Chest]] (during [[A Greedy Emissary]])

==Progress==
The show must go on! And on. And on. We've been renewed for a permanent showing. For the earthen that means... well, it means we're all employed for a long time.

==Completion==
Marbleous! You're the perfect addition to our theater troupe, <name>.

Please come and help us again in our next showing!
