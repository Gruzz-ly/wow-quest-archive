==Objectives==
Investigate the abandoned tower behind [[Dornogal]].
* [[Forgotten Weapon Rack]] inspected
* [[Petrified Ironwood Parchment|Petrified Parchment found]]
* Meet [[Dagran]] outside the tower
* [[Titan Emitter]] used

==Description==
Long ago, there were once plans to build a tunnel through the mountain into Dornogal.

Before excavation could begin, the surrounding area was suddenly abandoned.

There is no record of what happened. Only a... deterrence--the field--that keeps [[earthen]] away from this region.

Every part of my cognitive matrix is pressing for me to leave. But we must persist.

The device's signal indicates something lies within the nearby tower.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm not sure what's afflicting [[Brinthe]], but it's clear she's in pain. I offered to escort her back to the city but she refused.

I will stay with her an' make sure she does nae take a turn for the worse and try an' figure this device out more too.

==Completion==
Forget what ye found in the tower--did ye see that?! Those looked like [[titan watcher]]s!

But... what does it all mean? And who were they?

==Notes==
;Upon accept

:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|I'll see if I cannae get the device workin'. Ye go on inside, <name>.}}

;Inspecting [[Forgotten Weapon Rack]]
{{book||content=
<The surrounding weapon cache and other supplies are covered in thick cobwebs and dust.

There are gaps where several weapons are missing, presumably taken to be used.

Despite this, it appears that no one has been here in a long time.>

;Upon picking up [[Petrified Ironwood Parchment]] which reads:
{{book||content=
[[Galan|Watcher Galan]] has grown paranoid. She asks us what has become of [[Dornic|Watcher Dornic]].

We have claimed ignorance, but she has been interrogating our kin and then collecting their memory gems.

She will stumble upon one of us soon or worse--find our armaments cache.

We must make a move--tonight.

:{{Text|yell|Dagran Thaurissan II|Hey, <name>! I think I got the device workin'! Head on down to the tower's entrance an' see!}}

Approach Dagran and Brinthe. The orb glows. [[Titan Emitter]] is automatically placed in the bag.
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Activate the device, <name>. I think it's reactin' to whatever is affectin' Brinthe.}}

Approach the orb and use the Archaic Quandary extra action button to show a vision of the past:
:''Projection of a watcher talking to a [[Forgotten Projection|stunned watcher]] appears. [[Forgotten Resistance|Earthen]] can be seen lying around the ground.''
