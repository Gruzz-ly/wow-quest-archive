==Objectives==
Use the Explosive sticks to destroy Kobold tunnels.
*[[Kobold]] tunnels bombed (3)
*[[Explosive Sticks]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that we landed a mighty blow, it is time to make sure that we block their tunnels so they cannot come back.

Remember the stuff that [[Korgran]] asked about? Explosive sticks--his recipe. I have brought enough to shake a mountain! More than enough for the kobolds.

Help me show these kobolds that we will fight for what is ours so they will never come back!
