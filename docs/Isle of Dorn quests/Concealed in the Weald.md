==Objectives==
Eliminate Shadowsilk forces at the Skolzgal Mill.
*Eliminate [[Shadowsilk]] forces at the [[Skolzgal Mill]] (0/100%)
*Meet Peacekeeper Leif at the north end of Skolzgal Mill.

==Description==
The [[nerubian]]s seem to be in league with the [[Arathi]]. Many of them are guarding [[Skolzgal Mill|the mill]], but I am sure there are more than we can see.

We cannot allow such a large enemy force to operate unimpeded this close to [[Rambleshire]].

The nerubians attacked and destroyed large sections of [[Dornogal]] not too long ago. The [[Order of Night]] Arathi are abducting and enslaving our people.

We must eliminate as many of them as we can. Preferably all of them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The more enemies we eliminate, the safer we will all be.

==Completion==
That should disrupt their operation. Let us hope it is enough for now.

==Notes==
