You will also receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 5,800 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
I am glad to see you all back safely from your journey.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Come, Anduin. Dornogal awaits.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|We'll meet you there, <name>.}}

Consider taking the portal to Dornogal near the inn, which drops players off at {{co|63.6|52.2|Dornogal}} in the [[Fissure]].

Catch up with Moira, [[Merrix]], [[Magni Bronzebeard]], [[Anduin Wrynn]], and Alleria Windrunner south of the [[Coreway]] in southwestern Dornogal:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Alleria, Anduin! Good tae see ye back.}}
 
Alleria has gossip:

{{Dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|Xal'atath remains a threat that must be eliminated. But I see now that my single-minded drive to vanquish her was... misguided.

My sense of guilt and my thirst for vengeance warped my perspective. I blamed myself for what happened, and thought that I alone had to make things right.

I'm not the only one who seeks to bring Xal'atath to justice. We'll face her together, as one.}}
