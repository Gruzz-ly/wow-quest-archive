Rescue the Dalaran Custodians from the Twilight's Blade Cultists:
:{{Text|Say|Arator|The Twilight's Blade--they must be the threat from my aunt's vision.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|These cultists resemble the [[Twilight's Hammer]]. Looks like they found a new doomsday to chase.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Given their name, I think it's obvious that these fanatics now serve [[Xal'atath]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|No matter what their goals are, the Twilight's Blade must be stopped.}}

Vereesa has new gossip after completion:
{{dialogue|Don't worry about me. I'll be okay... in a moment.

Please... help Arator. This feels far too... personal.}}
