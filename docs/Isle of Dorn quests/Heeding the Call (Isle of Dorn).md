==Objectives==
Help 8 Stranded Pilgrims on [[Dhar Oztan|the mountain]].
*[[Stranded Pilgrim|Stranded Earthen]] helped (8)

==Description==
Earthen from across the island have been drawn to this place. Kind of a strange coincidence you'd show up now too.

Maybe it's because Baelgrim's gone or... a new Stormward's coming. Or it could just be barometric pressure...

Bah! There's time enough to spin wild theories later. Right now, we need to assist the pilgrims that have foolishly attempted the summit unprepared. We can't be worrying about them while we try to summon the stormrooks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
These earthen pilgrims seem intent on reaching the peak. I hope we can keep them safe.

==Completion==
If the storm summoned these earthen here, does that mean they have a role to play in what comes next? 

We've directed them to hole up in the cave near the peak for now. I'm not sure what's next for them--or any of us.
