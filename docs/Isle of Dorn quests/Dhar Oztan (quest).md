==Objectives==
Travel to [[Dhar Oztan]].

==Description==
I love the [[stormrook]]s. Taking care of them was my directive, so they're all I've ever known. But even so, there are questions about them that even I don't have answers to.

[[Baelgrim]]--Stormward Baelgrim--he was the expert. I'd pester him about them at every opportunity. And he shared what he could.

He told me once about summoning rooks at Dhar Oztan. It's an old [[Stormriders|Stormrider]] outpost that predates the [[Stormperch]]. If you want to know more about stormrooks, that's where we need to go.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So Baelgrim is gone. And now others have come. You mean to summon more rooks, don't you?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|[[Thrall]]|An ancient Stormrider outpost... Meet us there, <name>.}}

Thrall and Lufsela have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Thrall|I sense a strong connection to the elements in this earthen Lufsela. Her time as tender has engendered a strong bond with all of the rooks, not just Shraubendre. She will be a great help in any effort to summon more.}}

{{dialogue|title=Rooktender Lufsela|When I saw you two coming, I just had this feeling. And when you mentioned the stormrooks, I was afraid you wanted to take Shraubendre. I don't know what I'd do without her.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Tell me, how is it that you were given a rook if you're not a Stormrider?}}
:{{text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|Shraubendre doesn't belong to anyone. But she chose me.}}
:{{text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|Besides, nobody else could handle her. She has this tendency to corkscrew unexpectedly.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|It seems you were meant for each other. This bodes well.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|You have a bond with the rooks. Even those returned to the storm. I can sense it.}}
:{{text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|Shraubendre may be all that's left. We... we lost so many.}}

Head southwest to [[Dhar Oztan]], not far from the [[Dalaran]] crash site:
:{{Text|say|Olbarig|Hold, outlanders. This place is off limits to all but Stormward Baelgrim.}}
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|You... didn't hear? Baelgrim... he's gone.}}

All three have gossip:

{{Dialogue|title=Olbarig|I can't quite process it. Baelgrim is gone? It doesn't seem possible. He is the very embodiment of the Stormriders. Without him, what's become of the rest?

{{gossip|You worked with Baelgrim?}}

Yes. I was his first Stormguard. I was at his side from the very beginning.

We... had a falling out over the binding of the rooks. I had hoped that time would eventually bring us back together. It is hard to believe that opportunity will never come.

{{gossip|Who are all these other earthen here?}}

I am not certain. I learned of earthen congregating here and came to investigate.

They seem to include Oathsworn and Unbound. The only commonality among them is a compulsion to come to this place. I have not seen or heard of anything like it in all my years.}}

{{dialogue|title=Rooktender Lufsela|I've never been here before, but Baelgrim would tell me stories of this place. Before Storm's Watch was built, this was the historical home of the Stormriders. Just think of the legends born in this place. Oh, to have been here back then...}}

{{dialogue|title=Thrall|This place... the mountain and the storm. Ancient forces align between the land and the sky. I can see now why the rooks were summoned here. This place is as close to the elemental plane as almost any I've known on Azeroth.}}

==Progression==
{{Ties That Bind}}
