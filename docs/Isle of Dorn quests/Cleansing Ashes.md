==Objectives==
Collect 6 ashenfold flowers near [[Restless Estuary]].
*[[Ashenfold]] (6)

==Description==
The [[Unbound]] have a symbolic ceremony of cleansing. We perform it before a shutdown.

It is a symbolic process of purification. For it, we need to gather ashenfold, a flower that grows around [[Isle of Dorn|the isle]]. We waft the smoke of the burned flowers through the fissures and cracks in our bodies to symbolically remove impurities.

We are then ready to embrace our final moments.
