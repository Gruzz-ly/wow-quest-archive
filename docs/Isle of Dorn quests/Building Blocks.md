==Objectives==
Collect 20 Glittering Ore in [[Orecreg|The Orecreg]].
* [[Glittering Ore]] (20)

==Description==
The quarry is overrun with [[fungarian]]s, all of the mining tunnels are collapsed, and we do not have time to clear them out and rebuild!

However, I did spy a good amount of ore on the ground on the way here. It would be a start at repairing the [[Coreway]] but...

<[[Baelgrim]] sighs and grimly looks at the injured [[Unbound]] [[earthen]].>

I am needed here. With Adelgonn's people. My people. Will you gather the ore in my stead?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Collect as much ore as you can. The Coreway is still my priority, but these injured need immediate help.

==Completion==
It is not much, but this ore should help stabilize the Coreway.

With Adelgonn's help, we will be able to reclaim the quarry and its mines and establish a supply line with Dornogal.

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Outlander, you gather the ore. Adelgonn... how can I help?}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|That's the first time you've asked that question.}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|But... you can start by helping the injured.}}
:''Baelgrim walks over to [[Treagor]] and [[Findorn]].''

Pick up [[A Natural Remedy]] before heading out.

Two injured earthen near Baelgrim have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Findorn|<Findorn's face is a mass of webs. Pale, dull eyes peek out... but they blink once slowly at you.>}}

{{dialogue|title=Treagorn|<Treagor's body is crisscrossed with cracks and nerubian poison has almost corroded away his hands and feet.

However, fresh and thick mud paste holds him together.>}}

At the [[Orecreg]], look for large [[Unsorted Ore Pile]]s and small [[Ore Fragment]] gems all over the area. Also, inside one of the buildings, some [[Discarded Botanist Notes]] at {{co|31.9|83.6|Isle of Dorn}} inside a building starts [[Concerning Fungarians]].
