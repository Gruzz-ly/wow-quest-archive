==Objectives==
Use cinderbrew to repel the [[nerubian]] attack in the [[Proscenium]].
* [[Cinderbrew Keg]] picked up
* Cinderbrew thrown into burrow
* Nerubian burrows collapsed (3)
*Regroup with Wenbrandt in the upper stands of The Proscenium.

==Description==
Who are you? But of course, another outlander! I'm [[Wenbrandt]], tamer of cinderbees and creator of cinderbrew.

<Wenbrandt squares himself up as if you should be impressed.>

I had brought barrels of cinderbrew to help the injured. I thought drinking it would ease their pain, but for most it just caused more... burning... pain...

I refuse to let my brew go to waste. Maybe it can be weaponized. The nerubians are just bugs after all--organic and flameable{{sic}}.

This burrow here is a perfect test subject.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Go drop a few on the nerubians. Let's see what happens.

==Completion==
Mountains fall on me, that was incredible! And to think that we've been drinking the stuff...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Wenbrandt|Pick up that cinderbrew keg. I have an idea.}}

[[File:Fire in the Hole.jpg|thumb|Put fires in holes]]
Pick up [[The Cavalry is Here]] before heading out, then pick up the barrel:
:{{text|say|Wenbrandt|Now toss it in there!}}

Use the extra action button on the marked burrow a few yards away from Wenbrandt:
:{{abilities|Bottle of Cinderbrew|Toss a bottle of highly explosive mead.|range=30|cd=5 sec|notes=Instant|id=435504|icon=inv_10_alchemy_bottle_shape1_orange}}
:{{text|say|Wenbrandt|Hah! I knew it would work! Let's light them up!}}

The three burrows are marked on the minimap. Destroy the westernmost hole, where [[Anduin Wrynn]] is facing off:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Hold on! Help is on the way!}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Find cover, quickly!}}
:''Anduin and three [[Earthen Denizen]]s run away.''

==Progression==
{{Earthen Fissures}}

==Beta version==
;Description
There you are, outsider! I'm Wenbrandt--tamer of the great cinderbees and creator of cinderbrew.

<Wenbrandt squares himself up as if you should be impressed.>

I was distributing cinderbrew to the injured when an idea came to me.

I don't advertise this, but aside from the fiery kick that only the earthen can tolerate, cinderbew kegs need to be handled with an, um, steady hand.

You might try, to er, pick one up and drop it in a nerubian burrow...
