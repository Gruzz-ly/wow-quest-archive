==Objectives==
Help Cenderragg collect 8 Opal Ore from the [[Opalcreg]].
* [[Opal Ore]] (8)
*Meet Cenderragg near the entrance of the mine

==Description==
I'll be direct with you. We have a goal here and those opals are the center of it.

No one will leave until we get the job done, the opals are too important. If you could gather enough ore, we could convince them to leave.

But be careful, those [[nerubian]]s are dangerous.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Why did the nerubians have to show up? We were almost complete.

==Completion==
We collected much. I worry that it still won't be enough.

==Notes==
Upon accept of both quests:
:{{text|say|Cenderragg|Clear the path for me! I'll see you closer to the entrance to discuss how to shut this operation down.}}

==Beta version==
;Progress
We almost got everything we needed.
