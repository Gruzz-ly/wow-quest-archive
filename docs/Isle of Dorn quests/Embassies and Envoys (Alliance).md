On accept:
:{{text|say|Merrix|Seek out my steward, <name>. He is waiting to assist you.}}

Alleria has a <Stay awhile and listen.> gossip option:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Jaina, Thrall. When we last spoke, I... was in a dark place.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|My grief and rage were deafening. I thought the only way to silence them...}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|...was to hunt down those responsible.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I know what that's like. To survive an atrocity, and feel like vengeance is all you have left.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Or to think you could have stopped what happened, if you had just seen what was right in front of you.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|That pain, that guilt... I felt it twisting me into someone I'm not.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|But I assure you... I have found my way back from the edge. And I am here, with you, to the end.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|It's good to have you with us, Alleria.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|We're all in this together.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|That we are. The time will come when I must face Xal'atath again.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|But when I do... It will be for the right reasons.}}

Head north to the [[Coreway]]. On the northwest wall is the [[Alliance Embassy]], where a [[Dornogal Steward]] is waiting:
{{dialogue|Welcome, <race>.

Long ago, Councilward Merrix appointed me as the decorator of Dornogal. 

It is my solemn duty to maintain the aesthetic harmony of our city. With each passing cycle, I diligently weave style and beauty into the fabric of Dornogal's streets, imbuing them with a subtle elegance and functional allure that befits our esteemed heritage. 

As the appointed decorator, I pledge to uphold the legacy of Merrix and ensure that Dornogal remains a beacon of beauty and wonder for cycles to come.

How can I help you?

{{gossip|quest=|I'm here to help prepare the embassy.}}}}
:{{text|say|Dornogal Steward|Directive confirmed. Let us begin with banners then.}}
:{{text|say|Dornogal Steward|I am certain you will find this design to your taste.}}

Mount the two Alliance banners nearby, then follow the steward inside:
:{{text|say|Dornogal Steward|Very good. Let us continue inside.}}
:{{text|say|Dornogal Steward|I have prepared everything you might need.}}
:{{text|say|Dornogal Steward|Once your task is complete, please let me know.}}

Inside, place two [[Large Alliance Banner]]s on either side of the fire, an [[Alliance Weapon Rack]] and some crates and barrels of [[Supplies]] in the corner, and a [[Small Alliance Banner]] on the north wall. Once done:
:{{text|say|Dornogal Steward|Well done. All I need now is your signature.}}

{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|You wanted me to sign something?}}

Ah yes, please sign this and I will be on my way.

<The steward extends his hand, offering the document for your signature with a practiced efficiency.>

I hereby certify that the embassy building has been meticulously inspected and prepared in strict adherence to the established standards and regulations, ensuring its suitability for diplomatic operations.

Signed

{{dialogue|title=Kurdran Wildhammer|Yes, this will do nicely.}}

Head back out to the Coreway to spot [[Magni Bronzebeard]], [[Moira Thaurissan]], [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]], [[Thrall]], [[Merrix]], [[Lady Liadrin]], [[High Exarch Turalyon]], and [[Alleria Windrunner]] gathered:

{{dialogue|title=Magni Bronzebeard|Well, I'm nae a thraegar anymore--if I ever was. Am I still Azeroth's Speaker?

No way tae know until I'm called again, I suppose.

When I think o' the energy Azeroth had locked inside o' me, an' how long it took me tae come here an' use it...

Tae think freein' and healin' these people--an' meself--was what I was meant tae do all along...

I needa moment to think an' breathe. 

An' Let the wind blow through me beard!}}

{{dialogue|title=Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Greetings, champion.}}

{{dialogue|title=Thrall|Greetings, champion.}}

{{dialogue|title=Merrix|Greetings, outlander.}}

Turalyon has new gossip after turning in the quest:

{{dialogue|title=High Exarch Turalyon|Alleria and I didn't have a chance to speak before she departed for Dalaran. 

To know what she went through...

:{{Text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|Alleria. When I heard about Dalaran, I...}}
:{{Text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|I would have come sooner. I wanted to. But the state of the world right now... the Radiant Song...}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|It's alright, Turalyon. You don't. We each have our responsibilities to bear.}}
:{{Text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Truth be told, if you had seen me as I was... what I had started to become...}}
:{{Text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|I should have been there for you.}}
