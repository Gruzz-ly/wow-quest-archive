==Objectives==
Confront the [[Arathi]] shipwright.
* [[Shipwright Isaebela]] confronted
* [[Shipwright Bodyguard]]s slain (2)
* [[Lamplighter Kaerter]] rescued
*Meet Peacekeeper Leif north of Skolzgal Mill.

==Description==
Where is Kaerter now? Did he go off on his own again?

<Leif sighs.>

We've rescued the [[earthen]] and eliminated many hostile forces, but our task is not yet complete.

Shortly before you arrived, we spotted a group of Arathi traveling up this hill. One of them was identified as the Arathi shipwright.

The shipwright is the leader here. Losing her will cripple their efforts to utilize the mill.

Head up the hill and find her before she can escape.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 5,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Kaerter is injured. He will not be an effective fighter until he heals.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|I will escort these earthen to safety. Then I will search for Kaerter before regrouping with you.}}

Go to the [[Nightshade Hideout]] cave where [[Shipwright Isaebela]] is holding Lamplighter Kaerter captive and confront her. The adventurer is caught in a nerubian web made by [[Shadowspinner Azarak]] when trying to do so:

:{{text|say|Shipwright Isaebela|Well, it seems we have more uninvited guests.}}
:{{text|say|Shipwright Isaebela|You have been quite a thorn in my side, but you have only delayed the inevitable.}}
:{{text|say|Shipwright Isaebela|The [[Order of Night]] will have our airships. With them, we will enact the Harbinger's will!}}
:{{text|say|Shipwright Isaebela|Fortunately for you, you will not live to see us bring about Renilash.}}
:''Two [[Shipwright Bodyguard]]s appear.''
:{{text|say|Shipwright Isaebela|Take care of this refuse.}}

Kill the bodyguards and interact with Kaerter's web. Upon freeing Kaerter from the web:
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|Ugh... I don't feel so good...}}

Leif appears in the cave:
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|<Name>? Kaerter?}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|Kaerter, are you fully functional?}}
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|Leif? What...  what happened? I was tailing a bunch of cultists and then...}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|You were captured and almost executed. You are fortunate that <name> arrived in time.}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|Come. Let us leave this place before more enemies arrive.}}

Upon catching up with Leif and Kaerter:
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|You were badly beaten during your confinement.}}
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|Messed up my outfit too... Order don't like Lamplighters much...}}
