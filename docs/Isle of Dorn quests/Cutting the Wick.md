==Objectives==
Find and slay the [[kobold]] workmasters.
*[[Hairless the Menace]] slain {{co|64.7|42.5|Isle of Dorn}}
*[[Workmaster Earwax]] slain {{co|64.3|44.1|Isle of Dorn}}
*[[Workmaster Nast]] slain {{co|63.3|45.0|Isle of Dorn}}

==Description==
Knowing kobolds, they will have several workmasters, or leaders, running this raid.

Find and eliminate these so-called "workmasters." The rest of them will get disorganized, forget why they are here, and hopefully leave us alone.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to slay all three of them? Their deaths will strike a significant blow to this kobold operation.

==Completion==
Eliminating the minds behind this operation will only buy us more time if and when the kobolds decide to do this again.

Unfortunately, there is still one more kobold brain that we have missed. Until now.

==Notes==
Slay the three workmasters. Upon engaging Hairless the Menace:
:{{text|say|Hairless the Menace|My Candles! Mine!}}
When slain:
:{{text|say|Hairless the Menace|Candles, all yours...}}

Upon engaging Workmaster Nast:
:{{text|say|Workmaster Nast|I burn your wick!}}
When slain:
:{{text|say|Workmaster Nast|My candle extinguished.}}

Upon engaging Workmaster Earwax, and his mole companion [[Wicktor]]:
:{{text|say|Workmaster Earwax|Can't hear, can't see, candle find!}}
When slain:
:{{text|say|Workmaster Earwax|I am all out of candles.}}

Near Earwax there are two more dead earthen, their [[Mourning Rise Epitaph|epitaths]] read:
{{book|content=
I, Caretaker Dorgad, wish to join my fused, Caretaker Nattar, in my final shutdown. I could not bear the thought of a life renewed and reassigned if I awakened again someday from within the machine.

May the empty chasm you left in my chest be filled now that we are together in oblivion.

May this act be known to be my choice to pursue true freedom and release from the cycle that was forced on us by our titan overlords.

Mourn my passing but rise to freedom.

{{book|content=
I, Caretaker Nattar, Unbound, wish to follow Kriegval's path to unshackle the bonds given to me by the titans.

Here will be my rest, my place of final shutdown. This is my choice, my last stand.

May you remember me as I was and for what we can become.

Mourn my passing but rise to freedom.
