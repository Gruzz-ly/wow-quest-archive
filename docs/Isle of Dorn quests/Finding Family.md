Where's my mama? My papa?

Ellie?

<[[Maggie Wiltshire|Maggie]] looks around with tears in her eyes.>

I was followin' [[Walker Gresham|Mr. Gresham]] and [[Clarabelle]] when we saw the bandits. He grabbed me up and we ran here.

I don't know where Mama and Papa and Ellie are.

Can you find them for us? Clarabelle is starting to get worried...

<Maggie sniffles.>

Ellie must be so scared!

==Completion==
You found them! You found them! Thank you so much!

<Maggie hugs Ellie tightly.>

==Notes==
Accept this quest and [[Torches and Tar]]. On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Walker Gresham|Why now? Why us? What do they want?}}

The first [[Defias Brotherhood]] enemy killed drops an [[Unfamiliar Emblem]], which starts [[Emblematic of Things to Come]].

[[Sharon Wiltshire]] has her hands bound behind her back in the nearest house:
:{{Text|Say|Sharon Wiltshire|They... they looked like Defias. But what would they be doing here?}}

Find [[Marshall Wiltshire]] inside the barn to the west, with his hands bound behind his back:
:{{Text|Say|Marshall Wiltshire|They called themselves the Red Dawn. They wanted me to join them!}}

[[Ellie (quest item)]] the [[elekk]] stuffie is found inside another farmhouse just northwest of Marshall.

On return:
:{{Text|Say|Maggie Wiltshire|Daddy! Mummy!}}
:{{Text|Say|Sharon Wiltshire|Oh! Maggie! You're all right.}}
:{{Text|Say|Marshall Wiltshire|My lord, who are the Red Dawn?}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Danath Trollbane]]|I... do not know.}}

The rescuees have gossip:

{{Dialogue|title=Marshall Wiltshire|Thank you for saving my family, <name>. Buildings and objects can be replaced, but my family can't.

I'm glad Danath is back. Maybe we'll finally find some peace in the Highlands.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Sharon Wiltshire|My cousin in [[Westfall]] said the Defias broke up into factions. Some of them have even given up banditry and are helping the people now.

That's clearly not true of the hooligans who attacked us. What are they doing up here?}}
