==Objectives==
Wait for [[Korgran]] and then regroup with Urtago outside at [[Fallside Outpost]].

==Description==
This lantern is perfect.

Enough of this. It is time! I can feel my memory clouding. We have to get going. Urtago is waiting for us. They will join us on my final journey to Mourning Rise, where we will conduct a ceremony.

<Korgran forces a smile.>

It is nothing fancy, I promise. As I said, it is more symbolic than anything else.

My head feels heavy. What was I doing again? Hmm, oh, right! Meeting Urtago!

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
*{{Cost|17|55}}
*7,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>, we have to find Korgran! If he keeps on exerting himself, he will shutdown in the middle of nowhere.

And it's not safe for him to be out in his condition. He would be easy prey for [[Wolf|stormfangs]] and even [[kobold]]s.
