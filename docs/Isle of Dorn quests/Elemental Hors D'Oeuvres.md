==Objectives==
Gather 10 Electric Eels.
* [[Electric Eel]] (10)

==Description==
The [[cloudrook]]s cannot possibly circle forever, and I cannot bear more of them being lost. But maybe they'd roost if we tempted them with their favorite food?

The [[eel]]s that swim in these waters carry a small electrical charge not unlike the [[mosswool]] favored by their faster, stronger cousins the [[stormrook]]s. I once reasoned that cloudrooks might enjoy the eels for similar reasons.

And I confess... I've been feeding them the eels ever since.

Gather some up and give it a go.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The eels may not pack quite the punch of Rambleshire mosswool, but the cloudrooks seem to prefer it that way.

==Completion==
These should do.

Hope you didn't get any nasty shocks gathering them up.

We can restore some energy to the cloudrooks and show them that it's safe to land.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Olbarig|If we can gather enough electric eels, the rooks may just come down for a bite.}}
:{{Text|say|Olbarig|I baited some fishing lines down by the shore to catch them. But... mind the [[crab]]s.}}

Eels can be looted from the beach, off of [[Angry Sandsnapper]]s, or obtained by interacting with the Fishing Rods along the coast.
Interacting with the fishing rods can lead to one of three following lines:
:{{Text|bossemote|You got one!}}
:{{Text|bossemote|The line broke!}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Oops! You snagged an angry crab!}}

;Upon approach after completion
:{{Text|say|Olbarig|That'll do.}}
