'''Boss of the Bosk''' concludes the optional Spores of Dread chapter of the [[Isle of Dorn storyline]], required for [[Sojourner of Isle of Dorn]].

==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Rotbark the Unfelled.png|Rotbark the Unfelled|Rotbark was created to protect the land, then was left to fend for itself until it forgot itself and rotted. As was its maker.}}

Defeat Rotbark the Unfelled in [[Boskroot Basin]].
* Rotbark purified (Optional)
* [[Rotbark the Unfelled]] slain
* [[Freydrin's Shillelagh#Boss of the Bosk]] (provided)

==Description==
There is one final thing I must ask of you.

There is a great monster that roams these woods. I am certain you've sensed it. It must be felled.

Rotbark was [[Woldkeeper Freydrin|Freydrin]]'s final means to control this basin, but even this was too great for any individual earthen. Ours is not to control, but to tend to its needs.

Use the staff once more and bring an end to Rotbark's reign.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Sporefused Hood]]
* [[Sporefused Cowl]]
* [[Sporefused Chainmail]]
* [[Sporefused Greaves]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|56|18}}
*13,000 [[XP]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+500 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) (first time) or 25x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
If we are to restore this place, we must do so a different way. We must carve a new path.

==Completion==
Rotbark's demise will mark the ending of this basin's deterioration.

Thank you, <race>. Your assistance has been most invaluable.

==Notes==
Rotbark is patrolling the basin:
:{{text|say|Rotbark the Unfelled|Rotten! Destroy the rotten!}}
:{{text|say|Rotbark the Unfelled|I... Waited... So long...}}

On complete:

:{{text|say|Woldtender Igris|As must you. As must we all.}}
