==Objectives==
Meet Merrix at the Councilward's Rise in [[Dornogal]].
* Meet [[Merrix]] at the [[Councilward's Rise]]

==Description==
Councilward Merrix requests your presence in his office.

He received the documents you left and would like to discuss the [[Steelvein]] situation with you further.

<Saradi regards you as if she is unimpressed. She also seems to be an earthen of few words.>

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I am pleased you made it. The suspense was eroding me away.

==Completion==
Steelvein is a paradox in a city founded upon order and rules.

Perhaps this presents an opportunity.

==Notes==
This quest becomes available after completing [[Pomp and Dire Circumstance]].

Upon accept, Saridi bows and vanishes.

Talking to Merrix in his office:
{{Dialogue|Well, if it isn't the bane of Dornogal smugglers! 

Excellent work. The city is no doubt safer because of you.

{{Gossip|quest=|Peacekeeper Kragad asked I bring these receipts to you.}} 

{{Dialogue-child|Ah, yes. Steelvein. 

He has made quite the name for himself in my city.

His name is whispered with reverence in the streets.

Many under my authority do not approve of an unknown entity bending the Edicts for... well, whatever it is he does.

And yet, Steelvein remains at large, evading capture. Curious, is it not?
