==Objectives==
Return to [[Moira Thaurissan]] in [[Dornogal]].

==Description==
This will be long process. Longer, I fear, than [[Dagran Thaurissan II|Dagran]] can stay here in the Isles.

But perhaps...

There are many [[titan]] relics I can use as "keys" to unlocking information in the mainframe or to repair it. That may make the process go more quickly.

Only time will tell.

You have helped us enough, <name>. Go back to Moira and tell her what we have discovered.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well, I know where to find Dagran if I'm missin' him.

It's good tae see him so happy an' in his element. He's done me proud.

Thank ye for helpin' him along the way.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|This will take some time. Dagran and I can handle it from here.}}
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Right. Let's do this! Tell Ma' not to wait up.}}

Take the [[Waygate the Upper Floor]]{{sic}} to return to the [[Archive]] and approach [[Moira Thaurissan]]:
:{{Text|say|Moira Thaurissan|There ye are. What was all this fuss about in the Archive now?}}

Upon completion, [[Archives: The First Disc]] can now be completed.

Magni has a new <Stay awhile and listen.> gossip option:
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Moira, can I speak with you?}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Don't worry, Father. I have everything under control.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I can see that. Better than I would have done with these... machines.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I just wanted to say... I'm proud of you.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|You're what? Well, I never thought I'd hear you say that. Are you in a bad way, then?}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|No, and I deserve that. I've done some things I'm not proud of.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|But in spite of me, you've grown up to have a keen mind for governing and the heart to let Dagran be the man he'll be.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|I've half a mind to tell you again what I think of what you did to me as a lass... and to Dagran's father.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|But the older I get, the older Dagran gets, and the more I learn about leadership...}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|I can't fully forgive you, but I can understand you.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I only wanted to protect ye. And I've not done a good job of it. We're in grave danger even now.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|But you don't need me anymore. And it does me good to see how strong you are.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|And that when I'm gone, you'll carry on and rule with a grace and strength I could only dream about.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Thank you, Father. Let's hope that time doesn't come soon.}}
