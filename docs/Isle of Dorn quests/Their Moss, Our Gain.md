==Objectives==
Harvest moss from [[Rambleshire Mosswool]]s and feed it to [[Durzan]].
* [[Electrified Mosswool]] (8)
* Durzan fed

==Description==
You say [[nerubian]]s had him? Not sure what they wanted with old Durzan, but he looks weakened by the ordeal. We can't have that if he's to challenge his brother [[Belzt]] on the mountain.

The moss harvested from our flocks gives the storm rooks a kick, so Durzan might benefit from it as well. Collect a bushel's worth and make an offering.

And if the [[mosswool]]s get ornery, be sure to put them in their place.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|21|6|75}}
*7,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
That moss captures and contains the power of the storm. It ought to give Durzan the boost he needs to get back up on that mountain.

==Completion==
That seemed to do the trick. I think he's ready to return to his brother on Thunderhead Peak.

Innteract with Rambleshire Mosswools. Some will fight back. Then put the Harvested Mosswool on the ground in front of Durzan.
