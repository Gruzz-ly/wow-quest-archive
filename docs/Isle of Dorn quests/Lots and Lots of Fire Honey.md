==Objectives==
Find a lot of Fire Honey.
*[[Enormous Glob of Fire Honey]]

==Description==
If [[Harmot]] wants to patch this sleeping boulder up and get him out of my pond, I'm all for it.

Unfortunately, we used the last of my store of fire honey on [[Shalehoof]]'s wound. I haven't had time to harvest any from the [[Cinderwold]] with all these [[elemental]]s running amok.

Head on down to the wold's edge and bring us some honey. You're going to need a lot.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Mind yourself in my forest. Cinderbees are dangerous, but we rely on them for the honey they produce for our mead.

==Completion==
You found this off of WHAT? A living honey e--

<Farnee stops her sentence before lowering her voice.>

Let's keep all mention of living fire honey between us. Harmot might get distracted and run off into danger if we tell him...

==Notes==
Upon accept of both quests:
:{{text|say|Harvester Farnee|Mind yourself in the Cinderwold, <name>. The cinderbees don't take too kindly to disturbances.}}
:{{text|say|Harmot|They may be temperamental, but like all elemental creatures on the island, they're vital in the role they play!}}

Slay the [[Coalesced Living Honey]] and loot [[Enormous Glob of Fire Honey]] from it.
