==Objectives==
Collect 10 Pure Fire Honey from the Overladden Drones in [[Cinderwold]].
* [[Pure Fire Honey]] (10)
* [[Overladen Drone]] slain (60)
* [[Honey Drone Vac]] (provided)

==Description==
Crafting with flame demands a fuel that burns pure and has sustainable power. Among these, the honey created by Cinderwold [[Cinderbee|bees]] stands out! A source of elemental fire, organic and untainted.

I've longed for a supply of this honey, yet never had the chance to procure it.

Take my harvesting device and gather a quantity for our purpose. We shall infuse it into your tinderbox. Exercise caution, for some of the Earthen revere these bees as sacred creatures.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you acquired the honey?

==Completion==
So sweet and the flame jumps from it even now. This should make an excellent fuel for your tinderbox!

==Progression==
{{The Flame Within}}
