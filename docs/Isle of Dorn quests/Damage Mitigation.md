==Objectives==
Tear down 8 Seditious Posters in [[Dornogal]].
* [[Seditious Poster]]s torn down (8)

==Description==
[[Obstorn]] has confirmed that [[Overseer Ardgrin|Ardgrin]], the overseer in charge of my supply line that runs from the [[Ringing Deeps|Deeps]] into Dornogal, is the one who tipped off my peacekeepers.

It is therefore also my opinion that Ardgrin is the one who penned this sedition. He must have sent his workers upstairs to post them around the city.

It is imperative that we remove them before these rumors spread further. Tear them down for me.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
*{{cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I would not have these rumors spreading any farther than they already have.

==Completion==
Very good.

That will help stem some of the damage Ardgrin is trying to do to my reputation--both of my reputations.

==Notes==
Upon accept of both quests:
:{{text|say|Obstorn|Ardgrin's behind this. I'd wager he thinks Steelvein paid you to keep me here--not that I am working with you.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|His reaction is unsurprising. But there was no way to inform him of your new station without arousing suspicion.}}
:{{text|say|Obstorn|I know, but... I regret not talking him down before it all erupted.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|This can still be solved peacefully. I am confident of that.}}

Merrix has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|I would have this issue dealt with quickly and quietly.}}

Go around [[Stoneshaper's Atrium]] and teard down the posters you see.

==Progression==
{{Merrix and Steelvein}}
