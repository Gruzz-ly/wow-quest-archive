==Objectives==
Collect valuable items from the [[Breathing Pit]].
*[[Antonidas' Introduction to Arcane Magic]] collected {{co|35.6|51.3|Azj-Kahet}}
*[[Medivh's Karazhan Schematics]] collected {{co|35.0|51.2|Azj-Kahet}}
*[[Thalen Songweaver's Notes]] collected {{co|36.2|52.5|Azj-Kahet}}

==Description==
The larger threat has been contained, <name>, but I believe there are still other artifacts important to our legacy--good and bad--here in [[Azj-Kahet]].

While they are still dangerous, their knowledge may benefit us in the long run. And, we must not allow the [[nerubian]]s to profit from what they and [[Xal'atath]] did to [[Dalaran]].

Leave no dark corners here in the Breathing Pit unexplored, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
We must reclaim what we can of the [[Kirin Tor]]'s legacy.

==Completion==
What have you found?

[[Thalen Songweaver]]'s notes.

The rest will be kept safe, but these notes...

I will see to their destruction myself.

Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|This bomb should not have been built. [[Council of Six|Kirin Tor leadership]] is to blame. But we are all complicit and must atone for it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I will dispose of the bomb. Destroy the other artifacts and meet me in the [[Tranquil Strand]].}}

Collect [[Antonidas' Introduction to Arcane Magic]], [[Medivh's Karazhan Schematics]], and [[Thalen Songweaver's Notes]]. They are marked on the minimap alongside the objects for the other quest.

After interacting with all six objects, meet up with Jaina in the Tranquil Strand. She is found with [[Archmage Khadgar]], [[Archmage Aethas Sunreaver]], [[Kalecgos]], the [[Kirin Tor Survivor]]s, the [[Sunreaver Battlemage]]s, and the [[Silver Covenant Spellcaster]]s.
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|More [[mage]]s have arrived in our absence, <name>. That is... heartening to see.}}
