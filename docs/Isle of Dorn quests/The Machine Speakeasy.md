==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Obstorn.png|Obstorn|Merrix believes this feud can be solved peacefully and without conflict.}}
Enter the speakeasy in the tunnels below [[Dornogal]] then confront Obstorn.
* Meet [[Merrix]] in the tunnels
* Speakeasy opened
* [[Obstorn]] confronted

==Description==
[[Machine Speakers]] are odd and secretive units, some prone to paranoia.

Even so, the grievance they have against [[Steelvein]] must be smoothed over.

As you have seen in the [[Forgegrounds]], their quarrel with a single smuggler has put the entire city at risk. As [[Councilward]], I will not stand for it.

Let us go talk to [[Overseer Ardgrin|Ardgrin]]'s employee, Obstorn, and see if he can deliver a diplomatic message to his overseer in the Deeps.

I will meet you in the tunnels.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 13,000 [[XP]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+1000 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) and 360x [[Resonance Crystals]] (first time) or X [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
I would have us exchange words, not blows.

==Completion==
I abhor violence, <name>.

Dissent. Desperation. Distrust. These are the consequences of ruling through fear.

<Merrix frowns for a moment before glancing down at Obstorn.>

But, sometimes, violence brings about clarity--and with it, revelations.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{Text|say|Merrix|Now that we have the passrune, let's pay a visit to Ardgrin's employee and have a chat with him, shall we? Meet me in the tunnels below.}}

After meeting with Merrix inside the [[Corridors]]:
:{{Text|say|Merrix|The High Speaker petitioned for this space a long time ago. In all my years as Councilward, I have never entered it.}}
:{{Text|say|Merrix|Trace the passrune on the golem. Then, we shall make our introductions inside.}}

A [[Speakeasy Runeguard]] stands guard at the entrance:
{{Dialogue|<The golem stands unmoving in front of a doorway. Faint markings are etched into its heavy chassis.>

{{Gossip|quest=|<Trace the passrune onto the golem.>}} 
}}

:{{Text|say|Speakeasy Runeguard| PASSRUNE ACCEPTED. YOU MAY PROCEED.}}
:{{Text|say|Merrix|Machine Speakers... always so secretive with their possessions.}}
:''[[Rugnug]] walks out as you enter.''
:{{Text|say|Rugnug|Hey, uh, Obstorn? I've got to, uh, strip some cams! Titans keep ya!}}

Confront Obstorn:
{{Dialogue|<Obstorn narrows his eyes at you.>

So! The Councilward doesn't just have Steelvein in his pocket, but the outlanders too?

I should've guessed.

{{Gossip|quest=|Hear him out. Merrix just wants you to relay a message to Ardgrin.}}
}}

:{{Text|yell|Obstorn|I'm not hearing anyone out! You and Merrix are in league with Steelvein!}}
:{{Text|say|Merrix|You Machine Speakers and your ridiculous conspiracies...}}
:{{Text|say|Obstorn|Ridiculous? How else would you have known to come here? Steelvein's in your pocket--or worse...}}
:{{Text|say|Obstorn|You're in his!}}
:{{text|emote|Merrix smiles.}}

When defeated:
:{{Text|say|Obstorn|Hold your weapon! I've had enough. You win, Councilward...}}

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Merrix|Now that you have come to your senses and are willing to listen, let me be clear. I am not in league with Steelvein.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|I am Steelvein.}}
:{{text|emote|Obstorn shakes his head at the Councilward, scoffing in disbelief.}}
:{{text|say|Obstorn|You, the Councilward? Dornogal's most notorious smuggler?}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|Precisely. And now that you know that, you have two options. You can bring this news to Ardgrin, or... you can join me in fixing this.}}
:{{text|say|Obstorn|Why would I do that?}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|Because if you reveal this truth to Ardgrin, your operation, my network... They both collapse.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|Oathsworn and Machine Speaker alike will suffer as they go without, more of them leaving Gundargaz and Dornogal.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|Talk to Ardgrin. He sought to wound Steelvein, not all earthen. Only you can avert the crisis this rift will cause.}}
:{{text|emote|Obstorn hesitates for a moment, then sighs heavily.}}
:{{text|say|Obstorn|You're right. Ardgrin just wanted to get back at Steelvein, er, you. He won't be swayed easily but... I can try.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|Excellent! I told you this would be settled amicably, <name>.}}
