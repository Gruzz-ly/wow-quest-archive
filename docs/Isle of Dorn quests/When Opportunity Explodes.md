:{{Text|bossemote|[[Laslo Overbite]]|Undermine deserves better.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Laslo Overbite|[[Gallywix]] has got to go.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Laslo Overbite|Who's with me?}}
:''Gallywix and his bodyguard [[Ug]] comes in and the bodyguard opens the doors as Laslo Overbite, [[Nikki the Fixer]], [[Marin Noggenfogger]], and [[Baron Revilgaz]] are having a meeting and they all gasped. Jastor proceeds into the meeting room.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|All right.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|I'm busy.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Meaning, if I'm here with you,}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Something more lucrative isn't being done.}}
:''Ug pulls up Jastor's chair.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|So...}}
:''Jastor sits on the chairs and sighs.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|...what is it you want?}}
:''Laslo gulped and speaks.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Laslo Overbite|I'll tell you what we want, Gallywix.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Laslo Overbite|We've had enough of your meddlin',}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Laslo Overbite|and you as boss.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Laslo Overbite|We want a new deal.}}

:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Hear that, Ug?}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|"A new deal"}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|And you all feel the same way, huh?}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|You, Revilgaz?}}
:''Revilgaz stayed silent.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Nikki?}}

:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Noggenfogger?}}
:''Marin still stays silent. But Laslo sighs.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Laslo Overbite|Marin...}}
:''Marin looks at Laslo.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|No?}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|So, really, it's just...}}

:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|you.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Laslo Overbite.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Just a little guy from my former operation,}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|a long time ago.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Gazlowe put you up to this?}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|That dirty, stinkin' rat!}}
:''Jastor slams his cane to the table and pulls it up.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|I'd ask you to stick around, but we got real business.}}
:''Jastor leaves his chair as he continues.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|You understand.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Ug, show our guest...}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|out.}}
:''Ug pulls out his gun with everyone staring in shock. Laslo gasps in horror as the weapon turns him to ash. Everyone gasps and screams as they ran away. Ug leaves the meeting room and clsoes the doors leaving only Jastor who chuckles.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Meeting adjourned.}}
:''The voidy mists comes in as Jastor starts walking but he was stopped by the Harbinger [[Xal'atath]].''
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|I see you are already making good use of the Black Blood.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Um...Xal'atath.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Nice to see ya.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|What brings you here?}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|It has been some time.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Is everything proceeding as planned?}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|The repairs have been more challenging than expected.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|The costs alone...}}
:''Xal'atath appears from behind.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|...are irrelevant.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Of course.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|I, uh...}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|I just need more time.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Do not disappoint me.}}
:''Xal'atath vanishes into the voidy mists leaving Jastor alone.''
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|Don't you worry.}}
:{{Text|bossemote|Jastor Gallywix|I won't.}}

On approach, where [[Renzik]] is with [[Alleria Windrunner]], [[Khadgar]], [[Gazlowe]], and [[Orweyna]]:
:{{text|say|Renzik "The Shiv"|Hey, you remember [[Bat Versus World|that suspicious wall]] down in the Ringing Deeps? Someone just blasted it to pieces.}}

{{dialogue|title=Monte Gazlowe|If somethin' is happening out along that wall, we gotta get on it! That's where Orweyna felt the problems were brewin'.}}

{{dialogue|title=Renzik "The Shiv"|Workin' with Gazlowe again brings back lots o' good times.

And some bad.}}

Renzik offers a skip for alts who have already done the Undermine questchain. 
:{{gossip|I have already heard this tale before. {{text|red|<Skip the "Undermined" campaign campaign up to the Homecoming chapter.>}}}}

On accept:
:''Gazlowe and Renzik leave for the Ringing Deeps.''
:{{text|say|Orweyna|My visions led me to that wall. I would go with you to see what is behind it.}}
:''Orweyna turns into a bat and also leaves for the Ringing Deeps.''

Head to Opportunity Point where Renzik, Gazlowe, and Orweyna are there.
:{{text|say|Renzik  "The Shiv"|This tollbooth has to be brand new.}}
:{{text|say|Monte Gazlowe|Ha ha. I gotta reward the effort, look at them.}}

Several characters at the toll booth have gossip:

{{dialogue|title=Renzik "The Shiv"|There's way too many goblins here for this to be as innocent as a tollbooth. We've stumbled on a big operation.}}

{{dialogue|title=Orweyna|I go where my visions guide me.

{{gossip|I noticed you aren't hiding as much.}}

I try to honor my people's tradition, but the visions and stopping the Black Blood come first.

{{gossip|Understood.}}}}

{{dialogue|title=Biff|You no pay toll, I make your head roll.

{{gossip|Who uses the Gallywix Priority Lane?}}

Lane isn't for Gallywix, just named good. Lane named after Gallywix so he no shut us down. He like his name on things.

{{gossip|Nevermind.}}}}

{{dialogue|title=Tollbooth Entrepreneur|There's lots of business heading to the north Venture mining camps lately. That's big bucks for us.

You wanna go in, you pay the toll. Simple!

{{gossip|Why are you letting some of those goblins in without paying?}}

Oh, they've got Darkfuse work badges. We don't upset Darkfuse Enforcement!

Blackwater's got a good thing going on here. If the boss-man ain't picking on us, we ain't gonna upset that apple cart.

{{gossip|Got it.}}}}

{{dialogue|title=Tollbooth Assistant|You don't wanna be shot, ya pay the toll.}}

{{dialogue|title=Netted Cheapskate|I shouldn't have tried to skip the toll. Those Blackwater mean business!}}
