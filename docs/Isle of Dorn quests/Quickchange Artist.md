==Objectives==
Receive tips from [[Wendeline]] in the [[Proscenium]].

==Description==
You seem to have the programming of a great actor within you, <name>!

I know it because I have that fire myself--no matter what the rest of these so-called "actors" say.

I'm very impressed with how fast you change costumes. I am a master of the quickchange artist's ways myself, you know.

You're very close to figuring it out. You just need a few pointers from an expert--like me!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
See, character is as much in the costume as it is you. 

Practicing getting in and out of costume fast is just as important as practicing lines.

Now you can switch roles quickly and be a virtuoso of versatility!

==Notes==
This quest is a criterion of [[A Star of Dorn]].
