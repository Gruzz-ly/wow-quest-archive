==Objectives==
Rescue 6 [[earthen]] workers in the Opalcreg.
* [[Opalcreg]] miners saved (6)
*Meet Cenderragg near the entrance of the mine

==Description==
So, Foreman [[Alvegar]] sent you? That explains it.

The situation is not great. This place is crawling with [[nerubian]]s and they're showing us no mercy. They forced us to mine and took our hard-earned opals.

When you disobey, they web you up.

I was barely able to escape them when they came. The others... Well, that's where you come in.

With you here distracting them, I can go rally the webbed earthen.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What in the machine is going on?

==Completion==
Thank the machine! They're free!

==Notes==
Upon accept of both quests:
:{{text|say|Cenderragg|Clear the path for me! I'll see you closer to the entrance to discuss how to shut this operation down.}}

When free, the miner says:
*{{text|say|Opalcreg Worker|I'd better get back to it...}}
*{{text|say|Opalcreg Worker|My precious opal!}}
*{{text|say|Opalcreg Worker|Nerubians thought they could stop me!}}
*{{text|say|Opalcreg Worker|They stole my opals!}}
*{{text|say|Opalcreg Worker|What could the nerubians have wanted?}}

==Progression==
