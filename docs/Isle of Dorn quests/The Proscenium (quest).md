==Objectives==
Journey to the [[Proscenium]] in the [[Isle of Dorn]].

==Description==
The [[nerubian]]s are attackin' the [[earthen]] again. We must follow that swarm!

I fear we are outnumbered, but if the earthen can come together and stand with us...

We may just have a chance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The wounded! The nerubians are kickin' the earthen when they're down.

<Moira suddenly points to the center of the battlefield.>

There! In the middle... Is that [[Queensguard Zirix|Zirix]]? Again? And..{{sic}} [[Alleria]]?

Oh, mountain's strength be with me... We've got tae help them, <name>!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Adelgonn]]|Take one of the [[Moss-Draped Ramolith|rams]], Baelgrim. It's no [[stormrook]], but it's faster than going on foot.}}
:{{text|say|[[Baelgrim]]|I have never ridden one. But how difficult can it--}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Whoa there!}}
:''They all hop on [[Moss-Draped Ramolith]]s and take off to the north.''
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|I'll bring the [[Unbound]] to the [[Coreway]]. We'll meet you in Dornogal!}}

At the [[Proscenium]], just southeast of [[Dornogal]], the [[nerubian]]s have attacked!
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|These damn bugs! They're attacking our injured!}}

Baelgrim has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
There you are. I am glad you have arrived in one piece.

I am not so lucky. That ram beast Adelgonn gave me... those creatures should've never been tamed, let alone ridden!

I will be glad when [[Zarein]] returns.

==Progression==
{{Earthen Fissures}}

==Beta version==
;Completion
There you are. I am glad you have arrived uninjured.

I am not so lucky. That beast Adelgonn gave me...

I will be glad when Zarein returns.
