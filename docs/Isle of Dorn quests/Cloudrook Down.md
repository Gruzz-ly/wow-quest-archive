==Objectives==
Cull the riled elementals from the central Shield.
* [[Elemental]]s slain (12)

==Description==
You see that flock in the distance? Wild [[cloudrook]]s.

They've lived on these islands peacefully for ages. But recent events have stirred other elementals from the earth and sea. One of the cloudrooks was attacked, and it was... disincorporated.

Now the flock circles endlessly. Surely they will tire soon. If they get too tired...

Perhaps if we cleared the hostile elementals from this island, they will return and take their rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This is the cloudrooks' habitat. Your crash and our war with the nerubians is what caused the other elementals to come.

We should set this right.

==Completion==
Many thanks for your help, outlander. Though the cloudrooks do not seem any more inclined to return to land.

If this is some kind of mourning, I worry it could drive the rooks to exhaustion and their own disincorporation. 

We must try something else.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Olbarig|Never have I witnessed such behavior, but I've also never known the cloudrooks to lose one of their own.}}
:{{Text|say|Olbarig|Let's hope clearing those elementals will give them peace of mind to mourn.}}<br>

Kill [[Riled Dirtdiver]]s, [[Riled Kelpcoil]]s, [[Riled Rockwalker]]s, and [[Riled Sandtwister]]s.
