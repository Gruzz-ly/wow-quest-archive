==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Frostfire Elemental.jpg|[[Frostfire Elemental]]|Frostfire elementals roam in confusion through the wasteland of Dalaran's ruins, confused by the lingering magic.}}

Help [[Aethas Sunreaver]] gather reagents required for a protective spell in the [[Tranquil Strand]].
*[[Arcane Dust (quest item)]] (10)
*[[Radiant Prism Crystals]] (4)
*[[Frostfire Essence]] {{co|28.9|51.9|Isle of Dorn}}

==Description==
[[Kirin Tor]] survivors have been hesitant to return to this area. A great deal of energy was dispelled before and after [[Dalaran]]'s crash. An invisible yet tangible miasma lingers in the area for those who are sensitive to it.

It is unclear if the site is hazardous or if other more corporeal dangers still lurk here.

I can protect us, but I expended all my reagents at the [[Proscenium]]. Will you aid me in procuring more?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
The last few days have been... difficult.

==Completion==
Yes, these will do. Thank you, <name>.

Despite the shards and elementals roaming there, it seems the ruins are not immediately dangerous. But, if we are to spend any time here, an arcane barrier is wise.

We don't know the long-term effects of exposure of this kind.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Aethas Sunreaver|This area is dangerous. We must act to protect ourselves while we are here.}}
 
Collect [[Radiant Prism Crystals]] by interacting with the Radiant Prism Crystals and slaying the [[Shard of Dalaran]] and [[Arcane Dust (quest item)]] by slaying the [[Mana Fragment]], [[Lingering Spark]], and [[Shard of Dalaran]] and collect the [[Frostfire Essence]] from a [[Frostfire Elemental]]. 

On return:
:{{Text|Say|Aethas Sunreaver|I hesitate to scavenge reagents from Dalaran, but we need a barrier if we are to remain here.}}
