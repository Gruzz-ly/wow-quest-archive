==Objectives==
Collect 6 Earthen Fire Opals from the [[Opalcreg]] in the [[Isle of Dorn]].
*[[Loose Opal Mound|Opals]] Collected (6)

==Description==
I did nae think the Opalcreg would be under attack! I'm sure [[Speaker Brinthe|Brinthe]] did nae either.

[[Peacekeeper Hektare]] will nae let me fight, but maybe she will let you.

I'll stay here an' tend to this earthen. I know a trick or two after bein' in [[Dornogal]].

Oh, but... Brinthe really needed those opals...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm sure I can make a poultice for this earthen. Oh, 'tis a shame I cannae get any opals.

==Completion==
Fire Opals? You found some?

Brinthe'll be so pleased!

This earthen seems to be feeling better as well. A win-win all around!

==Notes==
Upon approach:
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|A nerubian attack? Here?}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Hektare|Stay back, small one! We will do what we can!}}

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Hektare|Go. We can take it from here. You have my thanks.}}
:{{text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Good luck, Hektare!}}
