==Objectives==
Round up the stray recruits.
* Stray recruits found (3)

==Description==
[[Kurdran Wildhammer]] has come to train the new [[Stormriders]] in aerial maneuvers. [[Thrall]] says his clan rides [[gryphon]]s--much like the Stormriders ride [[stormrook]]s--so he should be of great help to us.

Unfortunately, a few of our new recruits seem to have, uh, wandered off with their stormrooks. I wanted them to have a chance to bond, but it's time to come home.

Would you mind rounding them up? Thrall and I are putting together something special for these "rookies" lessons.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 6,100 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
You found those stray rookies yet?

==Completion==
Right then! Good on ye for roundin' everyone up. We're lookin' tae start formal flight trainin' and we wouldn't want any stragglers, now would we? 

I'm eager to see what these stormrooks--and the [[earthen]]--can do.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|Unfortunately, a few of our new recruits have wandered off with their rooks.}}
:{{text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|I wanted them to have a chance to bond, but it's probably time to round them up.}}
:{{text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|I would have asked Olbarig, but he has wandered off too.}}

Lufsela has gossip too:
{{dialogue|I'm not sure where those recruits have flown off to with their rooks, but they shouldn't have gone far. They probably just lost track of time.}}

Head to the southwestern shore at {{co|23.7|67.1|Isle of Dorn}} to find [[Stormrider Gurnot]] and [[Veytar]] looking at the corpses of three [[Tidal Guardian (Isle of Dorn)|Tidal Guardians]]:
:{{text|say|Stormrider Gurnot|That appears to be the last of them--for now. But we should stay vigilant, Veytar.}}

{{dialogue|title=Stormrider Gurnot|Together we now stand guard against all threats from ground, sea, and sky.

{{gossip|quest=|You're needed back at Dhar Oztan.}}}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Gurnot|Yes, of course. The mission must always come first. Up, boy. Let's fly!}}

Up next is to the northeast at {{co|31.5|56.4|Isle of Dorn}} by the Dalaran crash site on the [[Tranquil Strand]]:
:{{text|say|Stormrider Kothilde|A magical city traveling the world. Just think of all the places it saw before it fell here.}}

{{dialogue|title=Stormrider Kothilde|Just think of all the places we could see and explore. The sky truly is the limit.

{{gossip|quest=|You're needed back at Dhar Oztan.}}}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Kothilde|Apologies. We seem to both enjoy exploring. Let's go, Troumer!}}

Finally, back to the northwest at {{co|23.5|51.1|Isle of Dorn}} near the northern tip of the peninusla:
:{{text|say|Stormrider Adalar|That had better be a victualler with a ready drink.}}

{{dialogue|title=Stormrider Adalar|I am really quite absorbed in the moment, just now. Whatever this is, can't it wait?

{{gossip|quest=|You're needed back at Dhar Oztan.}}}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Adalar|It seems our absence has been felt, Phawa. Best not to keep our admirers waiting any longer.}}

On return:
:{{text|say|Kurdran Wildhammer|I'm sorry, Lufsela. We cannae wait for this Olbarig any longer.}}

New gossip from the recruits here:
{{dialogue|title=Stormrider Gurnot|Veytar and I are ready to serve.}}

{{dialogue|title=Stormrider Kothilde|I think Troumer would like to see what's next. And so would I!}}

{{dialogue|title=Stormrider Adalar|Let's go be fabulous, Phawa.}}
