==Objectives==
Disperse 6 Murmuring Peacekeepers in [[Dornogal]].
* [[Murmuring Peacekeeper]]s dispersed (6)

==Description==
Many of my peacekeepers have already caught wind of [[Overseer Ardgrin|Ardgrin]]'s sedition.

I am told some are losing faith in my integrity as Councilward, believing that I have been taking bribes from smugglers to bolster my own coffers.

I can provide proof that no such transactions have taken place--clearly--but we need to stop them from murmuring amongst themselves and giving the rumors power. Lies become truths through repetition.

If you find any discussing the matter, kindly disperse them.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I can assuage their fears later.

For now, we just need to prevent the situation from worsening.

==Completion==
I am pleased to hear that most of them were reasonable.

==Notes==
Try assuaging the [[Murmuring Peacekeeper]]s around [[Stoneshaper's Atrium]]. 

Some disperse peacefully:
*{{text|say|Murmuring Peacekeeper|Listen, you cannot blame us for being concerned.}}
*{{text|say|Murmuring Peacekeeper|I guess the rumors do sound a little absurd...}}
*{{text|say|Murmuring Peacekeeper|You are right. Merrix does not seem like he would take bribes.}}
*{{Text|say|Murmuring Peacekeeper|We will just have to trust Merrix--for now.}}

Others become hostile, in which case they have to be defeated before they calm down:
*{{text|say|Murmuring Peacekeeper|Who are you, one of Steelvein's lapdogs?}}
*{{text|say|Murmuring Peacekeeper|Mind your own business!}}
*{{Text|say|Murmuring Peacekeeper|I don't answer to you, outlander!}}

==Progression==
{{Merrix and Steelvein}}
