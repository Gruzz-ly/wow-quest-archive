==Objectives==
Meet [[Peacekeeper Leif]] outside [[Freywold Village]].

==Description==
[[Lamplighter Kaerter|This Lamplighter]] is looking for his fellow [[Arathi]]. The foreman says he directed an [[Shipwright Isaebela|Arathi shipwright]] to Freywold Village.

My superiors insist that [[Peacekeepers]] do not leave [[Dornogal]]... but per their orders, I must assist [[Kaerter]]. And to do that, I have no choice but to leave the city.

<Leif quickly hides a smile.>

It is decided then. If you are willing, please meet us at Freywold Village. Your continued aid would be appreciated.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It seems the locals have taken issue with our foreign companion. I am attempting to defuse the situation as best I can.

But we have more pressing problems.

==Notes==
Lamplighter Kaerter has gossip:

{{Dialogue|You'd think it'd be easier to get information from these earthen. It's like talking to a bunch of rocks!

...what?

{{Gossip|What is your mission?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
A bunch of Arathi made their way up here a while back. Their leader was a shipwright by the name of Isaebela.

Not too long ago, we stopped hearing from her. To make things worse, we think the [[Order of Night]] is involved.

Now Isaebela is one of the best shipwrights in all [[Hallowfall]]. A technical genius. And the [[Arathi Armada]] doesn't want her falling into the wrong hands.

My mission is to make sure that doesn't happen. One way or another. You got it?

{{Gossip|I have another question.}}
}}
{{Gossip|What is a [[Lamplighter]]?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Lamplighters are the folks down in Hallowfall that keep the dawntowers lit and keep the people outside [[Beledar]]'s light safe. Basically we help those most in need.

We're also really good at rooting out Order of Night cultists. And I'm one of the best at it -- I know what to look for and I don't trust anyone.

<Kaerter eyes you suspiciously.>

You're not a cultist are you?

{{Gossip|I have another question.}}
}}
{{Gossip|Who are the Order of Night?}}
{{Dialogue-child|The Order of Night are cultists that listen to crazy whispers from Beledar's Shadow. Their only goal is to bring about the end of the world. We obviously don't want that.

They like to hide in the shadows and stay out of sight when they can. But that's not going to work with me. I have a lot of experience dealing with the likes of them.

<Kaerter instantly conjures a flame in his hand and dismisses it just as quickly.>

{{Gossip|I have another question.}}
