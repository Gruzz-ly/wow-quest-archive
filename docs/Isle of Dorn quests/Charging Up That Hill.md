==Objectives==
Charge the conduit with [[elemental]] energy.
* Conduit charged (0/100%)

==Description==
Before we use the conduit to summon the [[stormrook]]s, we need to recharge it. There are other, gentler ways to do this but... we have to work with what's on hand.

The way to the peak is overrun with hostile elementals cast off from the storm. If we send them back to their plane, we can capture their residual energy and re-energize the conduit.

While you work on recharging the conduit, we will go ahead and prepare for the ritual at the peak.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Have you finished charging the conduit?

==Completion==
The conduit! Do you feel that? It's humming--no, it's practically singing with power.

I've heard this song before, late at night in the Stormperch's rookery. When the storms would come and lightning flashed across the bay, the rooks would answer just like this.

You can't hear it?
