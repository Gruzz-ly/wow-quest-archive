==Description==
I am now the caretaker of [[Mourning Rise]].

Please, help me complete one final task, and then I will be ready.

Meet me back at Fallside Outpost.

==Progress==
One more task, and then I shall truly be the caretaker.

==Completion==
You brought [[Korgran]] peace in his final moments, and now you have helped me fill his absence.

Your aid will not be forgotten.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Urtago|With Korgran's shutdown, I am the caretaker of Mourning Rise. The Unbound will look to me to protect their legacies.}}
:{{text|say|Urtago|It is a duty I must uphold alone. But before you go, please help me just one more time. Meet me back at Fallside Outpost.}}
:''Urtago walks away.''

Catch up with Urtago back at [[Fallside Outpost]]:
{{Dialogue|There is one last task I must execute to formally become the new caretaker. I would appreciate your help.

Please take one of our new memorial placards and heat it in the forge.

You can quench it in the oil basin outside to temper it.

Afterward, my name must be inscribed on the placard. It is an ancient tradition, one that I intend to uphold.

{{Gossip|quest=|I'm ready to help.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Urtago|Before, I told you I had mostly assumed Korgran's directives. But now I see that is not true.}}

Collect a [[New Placard]] and heat it with [[Forge Tongs]]:
:{{text|say|Urtago|I did the work but never bore the burden. That was Korgran. I thought his strength was part of his directive. But now I know it is something I must learn.}}

Quench the placard in the [[Quenching Oil]] outside:
:{{text|say|Urtago|Korgran went into stasis "young" for our standards. I wonder if it was because the duty weighed upon him? I may need an assistant soon as well.}}

Carve the placard on the table:
:{{text|say|Urtago|It is an honor to be a caretaker, but also a dutiful burden. This memento is a reminder of what our work means--of what we truly preserve.}}
:''[[Carved Placard]] is obtained.''

Urtago has new gossip upon completion:
{{Dialogue|It is good to see you, <name>. It is nice of you to visit me.

I appreciate Korgran so much more now that I am the caretaker. There is so much work to do. I have to get myself an apprentice one of these days.
}}

Completing this quest awards the "Remember Me, Earthen" criterion of [[Sojourner of Isle of Dorn]].
