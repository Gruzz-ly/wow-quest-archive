'''Prairie Fever''' begins an optional chapter of the [[Isle of Dorn storyline]] started in [[Freywold Village]].

==Objectives==
Examine and then deliver [[Hreka]]'s pottery jars to [[Kodun]] in [[Freywold Village]].
* [[Pottery Jar|Pottery]] acquired (3)
* Pottery delivered

==Description==
I was supposed to see Kodun earlier, but I'm as petrified as unliving stone. The attack on the village was... paralyzing.

<Hreka takes a deep breath and focuses on the shape of another jar.>

Could you do me a favor and deliver those jars to Kodun? He's a stone's throw away in the village pottery shop. I must finish this piece before the clay dries.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are you one of the newcomers from the beach crash?

==Completion==
<Kodun turns the pottery over carefully.>

Perfectly rounded, no cracks, a smooth lip... Hreka's done it again. She's our best crafter in town.

==Notes==
Hreka has gossip:
{{Dialogue|If you're interested in pottery, you can visit the shop in town. Everything here is still a work in progress.}}

Three pottery jars light up on the next table over.

{{dialogue|A tall clay vase with symmetrical handles. Its center is scored by a braided pattern, a hallmark of earthen work.

{{gossip|quest=|<Pick up the jar.>}}}}

{{dialogue|A pot of perfectly medium size, versatile for storage or display. A gem-like pattern encircles it.

{{gossip|quest=|<Pick up the jar.>}}}}

{{dialogue|A shallow and heavier bowl, with geometric edges. No pattern adorns this incredibly functional piece.

{{gossip|quest=|<Pick up the jar.>}}}}

After picking up the third:
:{{text|say|Hreka|I tried to design something new, but as you can see...}}
:{{text|say|Hreka|...Maybe this one will be different.}}

Find [[Kodun]] inside a building near village center:
{{dialogue|Welcome to Freywold Village, outsider.

We Unbound dedicate our lives to the pursuit of craftsmanship, production, and innovation.

The last is what many chase but few find, ever.

{{gossip|quest=|<Hand over the pottery.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Kodun|You met Hreka, then? She has avoided coming into town.}}
:{{text|say|Kodun|I grow worried. Something happened recently, but there's nothing we can do about it.}}

==Progression==
{{Hope, An Anomaly}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.0.2|note=Added.}}
