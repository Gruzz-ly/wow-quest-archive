==Objectives==
Complete a Delve in the Isle of Dorn and a Delve in Azj-Kahet.
*Complete a delve in [[Isle of Dorn]].
*Complete a delve in [[Azj-Kahet]].

==Description==
I'm hearin' there's trouble all over Khaz Algar right now. Delve critters are getting all feisty. We should go handle it! Top tae bottom, show them that gettin' aggressive is not in their best interests!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 18,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
That's a... remarkably literal interpretation of my earlier comments, <name>.

But still, we showed them the dangers of gettin' too aggressive--aggression right back at 'em!
