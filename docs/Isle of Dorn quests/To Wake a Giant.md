==Objectives==
Apply [[elemental]] salve to the mountain giant for [[Harmot]].
*Elemental Salve applied to [[Slumbering Mountain Giant|Mountain Giant]]

==Description==
By the [[Coreway]], this stuff packs a punch!

Combining healing silt with the molten fusion properties of fire honey has given us a salve that could wake a whole mountain!

Which is exactly what you'll do. Take the mixture over to our wounded friend in [[Harvester Farnee|Farnee]]'s pond and slap it on his hide!

It should be enough to wake him up and alleviate any soreness.

Hopefully, any ways.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,400 [[XP]]
*[[Earthmender's Signet]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+500 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) (first time) or 25x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
This will either wake the giant and patch him up good as new or...

Well, let's not talk about the other possibility. Have some faith in the process!

==Completion==
Well, would you look at that!

Thousands of years slumbering at the base of a waterfall and he wakes up without even a roar or a foot-stomp.

Hah! And Farnee was worried!

You did great with making that salve, <name>. Both Farnee and I owe you a big thanks.

Our new friend looks thankful too!

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Harmot|The tremor stones will maintain enough tension on the water to support you, <name>!}}
:{{text|say|Harvester Farnee|Are you sure this is going to work, Harmot? What if it wakes up and is still hurt?}}
:{{text|say|Harmot|In theory, it should work. This remedy works on earthen and ramoliths, so why not a [[mountain giant]]? Be curious, Farnee!}}

The player character has the Water Tension buff. Apply healing salve to the sleeping mountain giant:
:{{text|yell|Harvester Farnee|Oi, watch out <name>! It's moving!}}
:{{text|yell|Harmot|Hah, it worked! It's awake!}}
:{{text|say|Harmot|By the shapers...}}
:{{text|say|Harmot|He's... magnificent!}}
:{{text|emote|Harvester Farnee stares wide-eyed in stunned silence.}}

The Slumbering Mountain Giant becomes the Awakened Mountain Giant and faces the earthen.

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Awakened Mountain Giant|Pain... no... more? Little... stones... help?}}
:{{text|say|Harvester Farnee|Wait, hold your honeycomb... Mountain giants can talk?}}
:{{text|say|Harmot|Of course they can talk, Farnee! They're just like you and I!}}
:{{text|say|Harmot|And yes, we helped! Fire and earth made the pain go away!}}
:{{text|emote|The mountain giant rumbles as he looks between you and the earthen.}}
:{{text|say|Harmot|It was mostly <name> who helped! Speaking of which, do you have a name big fella?}}
:{{text|say|Awakened Mountain Giant|Name? I... forget... sleeping... long time...}}
:{{text|say|Harvester Farnee|Oh, do we know the feeling.}}
:{{text|say|Harmot|Well, I'm Harmot! And this Farnee.}}
:{{text|say|Awakened Mountain Giant|Harm... ee... and... Far... mot.}}
:{{text|say|Harvester Farnee|Far--oh, forget it. Close enough.}}
:{{text|say|Harmot|This is so exciting. I've got a quarry full of questions to ask. Let's head up the path and chat!}}
:{{text|say|Harvester Farnee|Harmot! Don't you dare lead him to my farm. If he tramples Shalehoof or steps on my hut...}}
:{{text|yell|Harmot|Follow me, big fella! Farmot's got a nice spot up that hill!}}
:{{text|emote|The mountain giant offers a slow nod of thanks towards you before following the earthen up the hill.}}

You can go back to [[Durgaz Cabin]] and talk to Harmot who is standing next to the giant and has new gossip:

{{Dialogue|Can you believe it, <name>? The first awakened mountain giant we've seen in... well, eons!

Long ago, there were many of them across this land--or so the stories go.

I can't help but wonder if there are other mountain giants just waiting to awaken.

{{Gossip|Why are you so fascinated by mountain giants?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Why are you NOT fascinated? Have you ever seen such interesting creatures?

According to records that predate the Archive, there use to be many mountain giants in these lands. As our cycles passed, mention of them became increasingly less frequent and eventually they became mere words in the Archive.

Some of the records held by the Archivists back in Dornogal indicate that it was giants like this one who helped carve out the region upon which the city was built, though no one quite remembers that far back so we've never been able to ever confirm it.
}}
{{Gossip|How exactly did a giant end up in Farnee's pond?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Haven't you felt the tremors as of late? I think it's those blasted nerubians and their tunneling to the surface. Or maybe there's earthquakes happening underneath us...

Either way, I assume the giant had been slumbering further in the cliff and the tremors must have dislodged him from the waterfall.

Don't ask me how he didn't wake up from the tremors though! I'm guessing they can sleep through a lot.
