==Objectives==
[[File:Maybe You Shouldn't Touch That.jpg|thumb|upright|Kalecgos and the Emerald Necklace]]
Investigate the Emerald Necklace in [[Mourning Rise]].
*[[Emerald Necklace]] inspected

==Description==
This necklace...

It is clearly full of powerful [[magic]], but... it is elusive--as if it is hiding its origin from me.

You take another look. Maybe there's something obvious I'm missing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
It was foolish of me to let my guard down. Do not be alarmed, <name>, but this appears to be a... [[pocket dimension]].

If the [[kobold]]s that met their demise here are any indication, it may be difficult to return to the [[Isle of Dorn]].

==Notes==
On accept, Kalecgos holds the Emerald Necklace in his left hand:
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|I can feel faint traces of spells I haven't seen used in years...}}

Interact with the Emerald Necklace:
{{Dialogue|<This magical emerald necklace pulses with arcane power, its proximity giving you a tingling sensation.>

{{gossip|quest=|<Reach out and gently touch the necklace.>}}}}

The Emerald Necklace traps the adventurer and Kalecgos.
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|Argh, a curse! Hold on, <name>!}}

The adventurer and Kalecgos are teleported to a [[Pocket Dimension (Emerald Necklace)|Pocket Dimension]].
