==Objectives==
Help Merrix disguise himself as [[Steelvein]].
* Cloak handed to [[Merrix]]
* Gloves handed to Merrix
* Weapons handed to Merrix
* Titan Device brought to Merrix

==Description==
I do not know if [[Overseer Ardgrin|Ardgrin]] merely intended to sabotage me or if he wanted to force a confrontation. Either way, a confrontation he will have.

I believe this situation can be rectified peacefully, but I cannot do it as the [[Councilward]]. Steelvein has never appeared in the stone, but he must now. I will parlay with Ardgrin in the [[Ringing Deeps|Deeps]] and this situation will be concluded.

I would have you accompany me, but there are some things I want you to know before that. Help me prepare and I will speak with you.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I will have this solved peacefully.

Though if Ardgrin asks for violence, we will answer.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Merrix|My purpose is to protect all earthen. It is the Edict I follow above all others.}}

Pick up a nearby [[Bundled Cloak]] and hand it to Merrix:
:{{text|say|Merrix|When the earthen split into the Unbound and the Oathsworn--those who leave the Edicts behind and those who follow them--I was caught in a paradox.}}

Pick up a pair of gloves from a nearby [[Accessory Chest]] and hand them to Merrix:
:{{text|say|Merrix|If I helped those who had abandoned Dornogal, that would break the Edicts. But if I did not help them, that would break them just the same.}}

Pick up a pair of [[Gilded Knuckles|fist weapons]] from [[Saradi]] and hand them to Merrix:
:{{text|say|Merrix|And so I bent them instead. I felt my programming... bifurcate, I suppose. Merrix and Steelvein. Image and essence. Facade and machinery.}}

Pick up a nearby [[Titan Device (Dornogal)|Titan Device]] and hand it to Merrix:
:{{text|say|Steelvein|The earthen need both, and would suffer in the absence of either. But some problems require Steelvein's... unique touch.}}

==Progression==
