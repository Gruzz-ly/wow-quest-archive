==Objectives==
Collect 10 Fungarian Chunks in [[Orecreg|the Orecreg]].
* [[Fungarian Chunks]] (10)

==Description==
We stabilized most of the injured. But many of the [[earthen]] you saved need more help. [[Nerubian]]s often fight with corrosive poisons that eats away even our stone bodies.

[[Fungarian]] flesh has long been used by our healers for its medicinal powers. The fungarian takeover of the quarry is one unexpected boon to our situation, one we will adapt to.

<[[Adelgonn]] looks grimly proud.>

One we will adapt to. As the [[Unbound]] always do.

But I can't leave Ebona's side. Will you help me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Please, hurry. The nerubian poison will deal irreversible damage given enough time. If it erodes enough of their frame or seeps into their memory gem... Then we may not be able to save them.

==Completion==
You brought back more than I expected. Thank you. Now, I will make the poultice.

==Notes==
[[File:A Natural Remedy.jpg|thumb|Fungarians at the Orecreg]]
Pick up [[Building Blocks]] before heading out.

At the [[Orecreg]], kill everything that moves, including the rare [[fungarian]] [[Rustul Titancap]], the King Mushroom. Also, inside one of the buildings, some [[Discarded Botanist Notes]] at {{co|31.9|83.6|Isle of Dorn}} inside a building starts [[Concerning Fungarians]].

==Progression==
{{Earthen Fissures}}

==Alpha version==

;Description
We have stabilized most of the injured here. But many of the earthen you returned to us have very serious injuries.

Nerubians often fight with corrosive poisons that penetrate even our stone skin. Our pools here are inadequate to treat their wounds.

However... fungarian flesh has long been used by our healers for its medicinal powers--which makes their take over of our quarry almost convenient instead of a nuisance. 

Go there and bring back any fungarian you kill.

;Progress
Please hurry. Some of the injured need immediate care.

;Completion
Now we can make healing poultices...
