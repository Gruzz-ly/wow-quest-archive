==Objectives==
Recover 7 titan artifacts.
*[[Titan Artifact (Isle of Dorn)]] (7)

==Description==
As ya know, we are here to collect some [[titan]] shinies, artifacts, whatever!

And [[Rannan Korren|Rannan]] thinks the more shinies--er, you know what I mean--the better chance we have figurin' out something about the titans.

That'll make Rannan happy, but it'll also ensure I have some extras to take to my store back home.

My wife, [[Perisimona]], is waiting for 'em back in [[Loamm]]. I can't go back empty handed!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You get some good shinies yet?

==Completion==
<Tuberros looks at the titan artifacts.>

This one smells very acidic--and it's broken. I can take it to the store... Rannan would like to see that one... Oh yeah, these are great. Thank you for bringing them to me.

==Notes==
;Tuberros' gossip
{{Dialogue|
This island is dangerous, but I can smell the shinies. Boss calls them "titan artifacts."

But they fetch a high price, so I still call 'em shinies.

Not the only smell around here. It stinks of those gorlocs. They smell wet, humid, and a bit like dead fish.

But like the boss says, we're here to find shinies, er, titan artifacts, and we gotta do what we gotta do.
