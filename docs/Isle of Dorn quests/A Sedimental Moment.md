==Objectives==
Help [[Cenderrag]] inspire the earthen workers in the [[Opalcreg]].
*[[Earthen]] Inspired (4)

==Description==
Some have started to evacuate, but there's a stubborn few that just won't let go. 

Could you say something? 

Maybe an outsider's perspective will get them moving.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Why must these few be so stubborn?

==Completion==
It worked! Thank you.

Any earthen saved is a great moment for us all. No matter how long we have left.

==Notes==
Cenderragg has gossip:

{{Dialogue|Since you're here, perhaps you can help out?

{{Gossip|Why are these opals worth risking your life?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Outlander, how much have you seen of the isle? Have you seen the state of our society?

There is a dysfunction.

These opals have the potential of renewing crucial technology that can change this. If there's a chance to fix our society, every one of us is willing to lay down our existence.
}}
{{Gossip|What do the [[nerubian]]s want from you?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Only the [[titan]]s may know. The nerubians showed up only a few cycles after we arrived.

They were vicious, killing and imprisoning those that did not listen to them.

So we did what we earthen know. We fell in line.
}}
}}

After accepting the quest, talk to [[Opalcreg Worker]]s:
{{Dialogue|This could be our last chance, we can't give up yet.}}
{{Dialogue|I have risked everything for this. I need just a little more.}}

Pick an answer, it doesn't matter which one you pick:
:{{Gossip|quest=|There's still a whole lot of nerubians out there. Good luck.}}
:{{Gossip|quest=|We grabbed so much more. Don't worry.}}
:{{Gossip|quest=|The [[Stormriders]] will be here at any moment!}}
:{{Gossip|quest=|Then all my sacrifice... was for nothing?}}

After saying something to them they say:
*{{text|say|Opalcreg Worker|Cogs bless you.}}
*{{text|say|Opalcreg Worker|Thank you for working to restore the mine.}}
*{{text|say|Opalcreg Worker|Thank you, <class>. I will not forget this.}}
