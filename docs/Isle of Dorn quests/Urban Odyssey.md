'''Urban Odyssey''' concludes the first chapter of the max-level [[The War Within (achievement)]] campaign. The storyline continues immediately with [[After the Storm]] from [[Alleria Windrunner]].

==Objectives==
Ask around [[Dornogal]] for pledges of support in the coming conflict.
* [[Delver's Headquarters]] found {{co|47.4|44.4|Dornogal}}
* Keepers of Renown found {{co|39.1|24.2|Dornogal}}
* Item upgrades and crest exchange vendors found {{co|52.1|42.2|Dornogal}}

==Description==
Did ye hear, <name>?

A lot of folks from the city are eager to lend a hand an' support our attack on the [[nerubian]]s and [[Xal'atath]]. I think it's worth reachin' out tae them tae see how they could pitch in.

The more support we gather, the better.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I am glad to see you return, <name>.

==Completion==
Thank ye, <name>. The more people we get on board with helpin', the more successful we'll be.

But we won't get anywhere if we dunnae have a large enough fightin' force.

The earthen are nae in good shape. But I think Alleria may be helpin' with that.

==Notes==
Check in with [[Brann Bronzebeard]] at [[Delver's Headquarters]]:
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Plenty of treasure around here. And I'm betting we can use it tae take the fight tae Xal'atath!}}

Speak with him:
{{dialogue|Ah, the adventure of exploring the unknown! 

There's nothin' like it, eh <name>?

{{gossip|What are delves and the Delver's Headquarters?}}

This place is where we're gathering all the things we've found explorin' the delves of Khaz Algar.

Oh, right! Delves are areas that contain precious treasures along with dangerous foes. 

I'll help ye explore any that ye find. Ye can bring a few of your friends if you want, or it can just be the two of us! We'll work together tae get some treasure.

{{gossip|Thanks, Brann. Let's talk about something else.}}}}

Brann also starts [[Bountiful Delves (quest)]], which eventually awards the [[Delver's Dirigible]] customizable mount.

Just across the way, [[Cuzolth]] and [[Vaskarn]] have set up shop in [[Mythic Aspirations]], reprising their item upgrade roles from {{g|Dragonflight}}.

Speak with Vaskarn:

{{dialogue|Greetings, friend!

Cuzolth and I recently arrived here in Dornogal. It's really good that we did, too. These Valorstones and Harbinger Crests are fascinating little artifacts. He's already developed a way to use them to upgrade your latest adventuring gear. Me? I'm still experimenting with Crest transmutation.

As usual.

Oh, I'm not complaining. I like being useful to you and the other adventurers. I would... rather stay behind here, myself. I'm not much of a fighter.

{{gossip|How do I acquire Valorstones and Harbinger Crests?}}

Valorstones are located all around and beneath Khaz Algar. They can be obtained by opening outdoor treasures, completing world quests, and by participating in weekly events, dungeons, and raids.

Harbinger Crests can be acquired in similar fashion. There are four tiers of crests. The more dangerous the adventure you overcome, the more powerful the crests you will find.

{{gossip|Tell me about upgrading gear using Valorstones and Harbinger Crests.}}

Upgrades all require some Valorstones, so it's a good idea to be on the lookout for them.

Upgrading gear labeled as Adventurer, Veteran, Champion, Hero, or Myth usually requires the addition of Harbinger Crests. You will need fifteen Crests of the appropriate power level for each upgrade. Cuzolth or another upgrade vendor will let you know which kind of Crest you need for each upgrade.

If you bring us a piece of equipment less powerful than another piece of gear you've already earned for the same slot, it will only cost half the usual amount of Valorstones and won't require any crests at all. So, for example, if you have a powerful cloak already, but you find a new cloak you want to empower up to that level, it'll be much cheaper.

{{buy|Show me your Crest transmutation options.}}}}

Atop the stairs in [[Foundation Hall]], check in with [[Auditor Balwurz]], the Council of Dornogal Renown quartermaster.
