==Objectives==
Help [[Kurdran]] train recruits in aerial targeting.
* Targets hit (15)

==Description==
Dunnae think I had nae noticed those rooks spittin' lightnin'. Sure beats tossin' hammers. But it won't mean nothin' if the Stormriders can't hit what they're fightin'.

Let's test their aim. Got some gnomish contraptions here that'll project easy targets for practice. Take [[Shraubendre]] back out there an' show them how it's done!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Flyin' takes a firm hand. An' boy do these earthen have that!

==Completion==
Now, that's the stuff! Did a real number on those projectors. But what we really need is a movin' target.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Kurdran Wildhammer|Take Shraubendre back out there and blast some targets!}}

Speak with Shraubendre again:
{{dialogue|<Shraubendre looks ready to launch herself into the air.>

{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Skyriding)}} Follow my lead, Shraubendre.}}<br>
{{gossip|I'm just along for the ride, Shraubendre.}}}}

Same as before, fly manually or not. Use [[Skyward Ascent]] to launch bolts forward to hit projected targets.

:{{text|say|Stormrider Kothilde|But... how?}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Gurnot|Urge your rook upward. They discharge as they gain altitude.}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Adalar|This would make for quite the show. Anyone fancy putting together an aerial act?}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Gurnot|Only if it's an act of war.}}
:{{text|say|Kurdran Wildhammer|Not bad. But not bad is nae nearly good enough.}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Kothilde|You process that this is a new directive for us, right?}}
:{{text|say|Kurdran Wildhammer|Hah! You think the nerubians care?}}
:{{text|say|Kurdran Wildhammer|Looks like ye can handle hittin' stationary targets. Let's see how ye do with a movin' one!}}

Kurdran has landed far to the southeast by [[Golgrin's Reach]]:
:{{text|say|Kurdran Wildhammer|Now that was some fine shootin'.}}
