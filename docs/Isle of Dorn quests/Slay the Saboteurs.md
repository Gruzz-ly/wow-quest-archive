==Objectives==
Kill 12 nerubians.
*[[Nerubian]]s slain (12)

==Description==
The nerubians are everywhere, <name>.

There are too many for all of them to be solely crash survivors. I've seen others burrowing up from the ground.

This [[Queensguard Zirix]] was laying in wait here to overwhelm us.

Let them know we are not easy prey. Cut them down!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We need to thin their numbers if we are to survive this.

==Completion==
Good work. And we've made progress as well. Perhaps now we can press forward.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Urgent Recovery]] from [[Thrall]] before heading out. After picking up both:
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|We have to push forward, or we'll be slaughtered!}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Rescue who you can along the way!}}

Valid targets for this quest include [[Nerubian Saboteur]]s and [[Nerubian Webspinner]]s. After the first kill:
:{{text|yell|[[Queensguard Zirix]]|The queen rewards her chosen soldiers! Destroy them!}}

After the twelfth kill:
:{{text|yell|Queensguard Zirix|Drag them screaming into the depths!}}

On completion of all three:
:''Anduin Wrynn runs up.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Jaina! Thrall! We need help! Magni is in trouble.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Anduin! You're alive!}}

==Progression==
