==Objectives==
Meet [[Alvegar]] at the third entrance of the [[Opalcreg]].

==Description==
I got cut off from the rest of the crew. We did not expect to be attacked by [[nerubian]]s. Though I can't imagine the rest quitting.

Our duty is too important to give up just yet.

Barging right into the mine could cause the nerubians to frenzy and hurt the others. So, I found a third way to get in earlier. Though undetected will still be tough.

Follow me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 5,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You made it undetected, good. Time to surprise these Nerubians!
