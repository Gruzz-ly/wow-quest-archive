;Alliance players who have completed [[The Purification of Quel'Delar]], as well as Horde players who have done so, but not played the [[Purge of Dalaran]]:
{{Dialogue|Thank you for coming, Restorer of [[Quel'Delar]]. It is an honor to have you here.

The Radiant Song has been singing to me. It's... her visions come and go, but they're vague. Destruction, screaming. death.

Since we came here, the visions have become stronger and more painful. I can manage.

Come, we have much to discuss and not much time. I fear.}}

;Alliance players who have not completed Quel'Delar:

{{Dialogue|
Hello, 'Champion'. I never forget a face. I remember what you did at Dalaran [[Purge of Dalaran|during the Dominance Offensive]].

The Radiant Song has been singing to me. It's... her visions come and go, but they're vague. Destruction, screaming, death.

Since we came here, the visions have become stronger and more painful. I can manage.

For now, we will accept your aid. We have much to discuss and not much time, I fear.
