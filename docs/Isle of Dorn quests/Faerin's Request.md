'''Faerin's Request''' is an optional breadcrumb to the [[Rise of the Red Dawn]] storyline added in [[patch 11.1.7]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Faerin Lothar]] in [[Dornogal]].

==Description==
<Name>,

[[Geya'rah]] and [[Danath Trollbane|Danath]] have arrived in Dornogal. They both seem upset about rising tensions in the [[Arathi Highlands]]. It sounds serious.

Can you come to Dornogal? I believe your presence can help the situation.

Faerin

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>! Thank you for coming.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Your people have broken their word, Trollbane.}}
:{{text|say|Danath Trollbane|I understand your frustration, Geya'rah. But do not rush to conclusions.}}

Danath and Geya'rah have gossip:

{{dialogue|title=Danath Trollbane|The Arathi Highlands have always been a hotbed of tensions. Let's just hope it's not as bad as these reports make it sound.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Overlord Geya'rah|The [[Mag'har orc|Mag'har]] left [[Draenor (alternate universe)|Draenor]] to escape [[War between the Lightbound and the Mag'har|war and persecution]]. We only want peace. If the humans continue to test us, our patience will eventually run out.

We will not start a conflict, but rest assured we will finish it.}}

==Progression==
{{Rise of the Red Dawn}}
