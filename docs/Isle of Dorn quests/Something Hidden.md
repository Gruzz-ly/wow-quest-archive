==Objectives==
Smash 3 [[False-Bottomed Crate]]s and gather any hidden evidence you find inside.
* Crates smashed (3)
* Evidence gathered (4)

==Description==
So, they have built extra compartments in the crates to hide extra items, eh? That explains how they have been smuggling goods into and out of [[Dornogal]] without our auditors knowing.

Excellent work, <name>! But now the fun part of our job: those crates will have to be broken open and the smuggled goods taken into evidence.

Smash the bottoms out of the crates and bring anything you find back to me.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Better luck this time, I hope?

==Completion==
<Kragad frowns as he looks over the goods you found.>

Some of these goods are from [[Azj-Kahet]]... We are specifically forbidden from trading with the nerubians in any capacity. We cannot risk any resources falling into the hands of our enemies.

The Councilward must be informed.
