==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Overseer Ardgrin.png|Overseer Ardgrin|If Ardgrin continues sowing discord in Dornogal, all earthen will suffer.}}
Meet Steelvein in the Ringing Deeps near [[Hallowfall Gate]], then confront Overseer Ardgrin.
* Regroup with [[Steelvein]] in the [[Ringing Deeps]]
* [[Overseer Ardgrin]] confronted

==Description==
I have not been to the Deeps since their machines shut down. [[Obstorn]] will have to guide us to Ardgrin's depot.

Once there, I will attempt a conversation. If Ardgrin is not amenable, which I suspect will be the case, we will respond with equal force. Our goal is to bring him back into the fold, not to beat him into submission. Ruling by fear only breeds resentment.

We will meet you in the Deeps. Come swiftly--and, of course, speak of this to no one.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 13,000 [[XP]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+500 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) and 180x [[Resonance Crystals]] (first time) or 205x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Completion==
Now that Ardgrin is willing to talk, we will talk. And all of this will be settled.

You have my gratitude, <name>.

{{Gossip|quest=|Steelvein is here to speak with you.}}
}}

:{{text|say|Overseer Ardgrin|Steelvein? Well, look at that. You've finally found some bravery.}}
:{{text|say|Steelvein|I just want to talk, Ardgrin. If we can come to an agreement, I have no quarrel with you.}}

:{{text|say|Obstorn|Ardgrin, I joined Steelvein on my own. I had to do something to keep goods flowing and earthen from suffering.}}
:{{text|say|Steelvein|Ardgrin, trust us. The situation in Dornogal has improved. I will get you the ore. Obstorn will make sure of it--as my new auditor.}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Ardgrin|I-- Fine. If you can get the ore...  But now you have the Councilward on your trail.}}
:{{text|say|Steelvein|I believe I can keep the Councilward out of this. Not to worry.}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Ardgrin|Good. I can't stand that smug bastard.}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Ardgrin|Let's go talk business... And put this to bedrock.}}
