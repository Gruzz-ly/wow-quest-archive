==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Queensguard Zirix.jpg|Queensguard Zirix|If Zirix is slain here, the [[Coreway]] should be safe from a second attack.}}
Hold off the [[nerubian]]s at the [[Cinderbrew Meadery]] until [[Queensguard Zirix]] appears.
* Defenses placed (6)
* Speak to [[Baelgrim]] to begin the defense
* Nerubians slain (0/100%)
*Baelgrim's plan witnessed

==Description==
The nerubians will strike out in anger and pride--which is exactly what we want.

They will swarm the meadery soon, seeking to punish us for attacking their burrow. We will hold them here on the ground while you take to the skies. When Zirix appears to command his army, we will light the fuses.

Wenbrandt scrounged together some supplies we can use to corral the nerubians. Set them up quickly, and then we will get you on a stormrook. Go!

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Mead-Speckled Pantaloons]]
*[[Mead-Speckled Vest]]
*[[Mead-Speckled Legguards]]
*[[Mead-Speckled Full Helm]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|56|18}}
*13,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Zirix is dead. We did it. It is over. Baelgrim did it.

<She repeats the last phrase to herself over and over more quietly each time as if unable to process the event.>

==Notes==
[[File:Bring the Thunder.jpg|thumb|Moments before the attack]]

On accept:
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|The nerubians will soon start swarming from the north.}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Place our defenses in their path. The honey will slow them down, and the mead and pollen will help us tear through them.}}

Players enter the vehicle interface, which has the following abilities:
# {{abilities|Place Sticky Ciderhoney|Spill a puddle of cinderhoney on the ground that will root the first 5 enemies to walk over it.}}
# {{abilities|Place Boiling Cinderbrew|Place a vat of boiling cinderbrew nearby. Attacking the vat splashes volatile mead onto nearby enemies, causing all attacks against them to be critical strikes.}}
# {{abilities|Place Explosive Pollen|Place a basket of cinderbee pollen nearby. Attacking the basket causes the pollen to explode, dealing heavy damage to nearby enemies.}}
# &nbsp;
# {{abilities|Remove Defense|Remove all defenses in the targeted area}}
# {{abilities|Pause Preparations|Stop preparing your defenses. This will reset any defenses you have already placed.}}

Four sets of arrows appear on the ground, showing the path the the invading nerubians will take. Treat this like a tower defense minigame and place resources effectively to slow down attackers so they can be finished off later. Players only get six defenses!

After placing the sixth:
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|We are out of time. Come, <name>. Let us get you on a stormrook!}}

If you use [[Pause Preparations]] and speak to Baelgrim again:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|I need to set up our defenses again.}}}}

Speak with Baelgrim:
{{dialogue|The nerubians will swarm this place soon enough.

Finish your preparations quickly.

{{gossip|quest=|I have finished setting up our defenses.}}
}}
Speaking with Baelgrim puts the player on a hovering stormrook with a good perspective of the arena. Players have access to three mounted abilities:
# {{abilities|Lightning Bolt|Launch a bolt of lightning at the targeted location.|range=500|cd=1.5 sec|notes=Instant}}
# {{abilities|Storm Axe|Hurl a weapon made of pure lightning at a targeted location, dealing heavy damage to all enemies nearby.|range=500|cd=10 sec|notes=Instant}}
# {{abilities|Static Pulse|Release a burst of static electricity, dealing damage to any flying enemies nearby.|range=500|cd=1.5 sec|notes=1.2 sec cast}}

:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Prepare yourselves! They are coming.}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|We will keep them gathered by the kegs. Thin out the swarm and stop them from getting past us!}}
:{{text|say|Wenbrandt|And from wrecking my meadery before we do!}}

If you [[Dismount Stormrook]], you can speak to Baelgrim again:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|Get me back up in the air!}}}}

Nerubians start streaming in, so fill the bar by killing:
*Large units (5-6%)
*Small units (3%)
*Fliers (1%)

Spam the #1 ability (which will one-shot small ground units) and use #2 (for groups or large units) on cooldown. [[Swarming Skyterror]]s will fly up to harass the player, so use the #3 ability to fend them off:
:{{text|bossemote|Use {{text|red|[Static Pulse]}} to get the nerubians away from your stormrook!}}

At 55%:
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|Baelgrim! They're chewing through the fuses!}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|We still have two fuses left! Keep fighting! Keep drawing them in!}}

At 80%:
:{{text|say|Wenbrandt|No! They severed all of the fuses!}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Stay focused! These monsters cannot leave here alive!}}

At 100%:
:{{text|say|Queensguard Zirix|Stubborn earthen! You will not impede my Ascension!}}
:''Queensgard Zirix emerges from underground in the center of the arena!''
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Outlander, leave this to me!}}

An [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays, Baelgrim and Zirix:

{{#ev:youtube|s1gPVPeI7NM}}

''From the adventurer on the stormrook still floating above the arena, the camera tilts down to show nerubians closing in on Baelgrim, still astride Zaerin, his stormrook. He wields his stormhammer and blasts them away.''

{{text|bossemote|Adelgonn|The fuses! We can't ignite the kegs!}}

{{text|bossemote|Baelgrim|I must fulfill my edict.}}

{{text|bossemote|Adelgonn|What? Forget the Edicts!}}

{{text|bossemote|Baelgrim|I cannot. This is why it must be me. You must guide the earthen.}}

{{text|bossemote|Adelgonn|Baelgrim!}}

''Baelgrim has his stormrook take flight. It takes off and levels off a few hundred yards up. Baelgrim reaches forward to pet it.''

{{text|bossemote|Baelgrim|One last ride. Then you are free.}}

''The rook circles around the arena.''

{{text|bossemote|Baelgrim|Zirix!}}

''Queensguard Zirix hisses as he looks up at Baelgrim.''

{{text|bossemote|Baelgrim|My directive is to protect this isle--and the earthen. All the earthen.}}

''Zirix hisses angrily at this. Baelgrim raises his stormhammer and jumps off!''

{{text|bossemote|Baelgrim|Glory to the titans! Long live the earthen!}}

''Baelgrim smashes into the ground, timing his hammer strike to land at the same instant. The force of the impact kills Zirix. The lightning spreads along the ground, setting the cinderbrew barrels aflame, which all explode, whiting out the screen.''

''As the explosion fades, the camera pulls back from the devestation, dead nerubians, and destroyed barrels to show Adelgonn, Wenbrandt, the adventurer, and Zaerin.''

After the cutscene, the player is back near the [[Cinderbrew Meadery]] instance line with [[Adelgonn]] and [[Wenbrandt]]:
:{{text|say|Wenbrandt|Baelgrim... Oh, twisting paths...}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|He's gone. We did it, but he's... gone.}}

On complete:
:{{text|emote|Zarein lets out a screech of anguish before flying away.}}
