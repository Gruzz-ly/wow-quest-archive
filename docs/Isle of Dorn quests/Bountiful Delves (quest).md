==Objectives==
Review the Delver's Guide, then recover a key from [[Rowdy Rubble]] to complete a [[bountiful delve]].
* [[Delver's Guide]] reviewed within the [[Delver's Headquarters]]

==Description==
We're going tae need lots of resources to fight off [[Xal'atath]]. Lucky for you, we've uncovered a source!

Some delves we've found are "bountiful" on account of the baddies there hoardin' more treasure. This treasure can only be unlocked with special keys found throughout [[Khaz Algar]].

Keys and key fragments can be found all about the world. Hunt them down and dive into a bountiful delve!

==Rewards==
The end of this quest line rewards: [[Delver's Dirigible]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|46|80}}
*15,250 [[XP]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+500 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) and 15 [[Valorstones]] (first time) or 25x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
Did ye find the key yet?

==Completion==
That was quite the haul! Up for a little more fun?

==Notes==
A bountiful delve is not needed for the criteria as completing a normal delve will still count. It is unclear if this was intended.

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2024-08-27|bluenote=
**Fixed an issue where players who had already acquired a [[Restored Coffer Key]] before starting the quest were still being asked to acquire a key for the first step. Brann has eased up on things and will now count that for the quest step.
**Now, the entirety of the quest will auto-complete if a player has already opened a bountiful chest in a Delve before starting the quest.}}
*{{Patch 11.0.2|note=Added.}}
