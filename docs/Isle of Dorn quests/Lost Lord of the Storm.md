==Objectives==
Find Durzan near [[Rambleshire]].
* Ranchers questioned (3) (Optional)
* [[Durzan]] found
*[[Nerubian Webbing|Webbing]] removed (4)

==Description==
Listen well, stranger. Once a year, the great ram Durzan, Lord of the Southern Storm, crosses the isle to meet his brother [[Belzt]] on [[Thunderhead Peak]]. The clash of their horns heralds the storm and brings prosperity for another year.

But something is wrong. Durzan has not come and the skies have cleared. The Stormrider may not believe, but I sense you have seen wilder things.

Ask around if you still have doubts. Just please help us find Durzan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Pray Durzan is still with us. If the brothers don't meet at the summit, the storm and our livelihoods will be lost.

==Completion==
You found him! But why hasn't he gone to the mountain? And why does he look so forlorn?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|You really believe two rams make the storm?}}
:{{Text|say|Head Rancher Stenspor|Here and at Dhar Oztan, yes. But if their horns don't clash, the storms abate.}}
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|You've seen this? With your own eyes?}}
:{{Text|say|Head Rancher Stenspor|Heard more than seen. And felt more than heard.}}

The listed questionable ranchers are able to be questioned with the option {{gossip|<Ask about Durzan.>}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Rancher Buhisan]]|
They say he avoids Dhar Khazad when he comes, as that's his brother's territory. Just as Belzt avoids entering Dhar Oztan when they meet in the south.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Rancher Fuoleim]]|
Once heard a miner working the causeway say she saw old Durzan leap from the top of Thul Medran to Thunderhead Peak in a single bound.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Rancher Kiespuch]]|
Storms always seem to blow in from Dornogal to Thunderhead Peak. Reckon Durzan follows with.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Rancher Kinnisant]]|
I once heard Durzan carved a canyon with a single charge on his way to meet his brother on the mountain. Does that help?
}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Rancher Langan]]|
I imagine if he crossed by land, we'd have found massive hoofprints in the fields. Maybe he can fly?
}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Rancher Silbarspra]]|
The old tales say he draws strength from the sea while his brother Belzt draws upon the sky, and then they meet in the space between, atop Thunderhead Peak.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Rancher Tofstrun]]|
Some wonder why we don't see him cross the fields. I suspect he rolls in beneath the cover of fog.
}}

Approach Durzan below the bridge west of Rambleshire surrounded by the [[Shadow Vanguard]]:
:{{Text|emote|The great beast's eyes flutter as he senses help has come.}}

;Upon freeing Durzan
:{{Text|emote|Durzan inclines his head in thanks.}}

Return to Rambleshire to find Durzan Exhausted.
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|That is one big ram.}}
:{{Text|say|Rancher Kiespuch|Ayuh.}}

Luftesa has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|I still can't believe he's real.}}
