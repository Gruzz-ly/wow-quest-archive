'''Frayed Legacy''' is an optional breadcrumb to the optional Spores of Dread chapter of the [[Isle of Dorn storyline]]. This breadcrumb starts in [[Freywold Village]], but the next quest, [[Mycomayhem]], can be picked up at [[Boskroot Basin]] without any prerequisites.

==Objectives==
Meet [[Woldtender Igris|Igris]] at the [[Boskroot Basin]] on the [[Isle of Dorn]].

==Description==
Keep true, <race>.

We of the Woldguard uphold an ancient promise to [[Freya]] to tend to these lands. Our edict is older than those wielded by the demagogues in [[Dornogal]]. Older than Dornogal itself.

However, not all lands have been tended equally. The leader of our order was to care for the basin nearby but we've not heard from them in many cycles.

I have sent a novice to investigate. Aid them and my order will be in your favor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|34}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This is not as this basin should be. We have much work to do.

==Progression==
{{Spores of Dread}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.0.2|note=Added.}}
