==Objectives==
Offer 8 Electric Eels to Wild Cloudrooks.
* [[Wild Cloudrook]]s fed (8)
* [[Electric Eel]]

==Description==
Now that we have the [[eel]]s, we can try to lure the [[cloudrook]]s back to land.

Head over to the neighboring island. Get as close as you can and make an offering to the rooks.

With luck, they'll cease their circling and come down for a nourishing meal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

You will receive one from:
*[[Olbarig's Old Wristwraps]]
*[[Olbarig's Old Bracers]]
*[[Olbarig's Old Cuffs]]
*[[Olbarig's Old Vambraces]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+500 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) (first time) or 25x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
Nothing better than electric eels to sate a tired and hungry cloudrook.

==Completion==
Now I understand. This is how the rooks bring their own over from the elemental plane. They weren't mourning so much as calling out to their departed kin.

Thank you for your help, outlander. You've helped me better understand these beautiful creatures.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Olbarig]]|If those rooks don't come down for this, I'm not sure how to help them.}}

Throw the eels at the cloudrooks on the westernmost shield isle by using the Feed Cloudrook extra action button, which summons Tornado and Cloudrook Tornado. When done, a [[Reborn Cloudrook]] appears and all the other cloudrooks land in the ground around it.

;Upon turn in
:{{Text|say|Olbarig|Well, I'll be. Can't say for certain, but I do believe that's the very same rook that was lost to those elementals.}}
:{{Text|say|Olbarig|All this time, I thought I was looking out for them. They were looking out for each other.}}
