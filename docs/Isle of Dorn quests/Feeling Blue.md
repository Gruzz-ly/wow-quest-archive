==Objectives==
[[File:Feeling Blue.jpg|thumb|Kalecgos and the Bag of Helpful Goods]]
Build the [[Kirin Tor]] outpost in the [[Tranquil Strand]].
* Speak with [[Kalecgos]]
* [[Bag of Helpful Goods (Isle of Dorn)|Bag of Helpful Goods]] collected
* Bag of Helpful Goods searched
* Items placed in the outpost (6)

==Description==
I fear... that it may just be me that remains, <name>. Or that the others are too far away to receive my missive.

It may be up to us to build an outpost here and see to the cleansing of the crash site.

So be it. It is just as well...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
It's hard to describe what I feel right now.

==Completion==
Well done. That bag is quite useful, isn't it? I'm glad I thought to bring it with me.

Now, on to the task at hand...

==Notes==
On accept, Kalecgos swoops in:
:{{Text|Say|Aethas Sunreaver|I doubt if we can do all of this alone--what? What is that on the horizon?}}
:Kalecgos enters the barrier shifting to his visage form.
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|You are not alone, friends.}}
:{{Text|Say|Aethas Sunreaver|Kalecgos! Ha! You got my message.}}

Speak with Kalecgos:

{{Dialogue|I was already on my way after hearing about [[Dalaran]]'s demise.

I am glad that I found you here.

[[Khaz Algar]] wasn't easy to reach. All the arcane energy that is being ceaselessly released from Dalaran's ruins must interfere with long-range [[teleportation]] spells.

I wonder how many others tried to respond to your missive but couldn't? 

{{gossip|quest=|We could use your help building an outpost.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|I can definitely help with that. Here, take this bag and start setting up camp.}}

{{dialogue|title=Kalecgos|It's good to see you, <name>. Though... I wish we weren't always meeting each other under circumstances like these.}}

{{dialogue|title=Aethas Sunreaver|A bag like that... such an extravagance.

An item like that suits Kalecgos. But... I do wish I had one for myself.}}

Interact with the Bag of Helpful Goods that appears by Kalecgos's feet, then use the extra action button to Search Bag of Helpful Goods to make the materials appear.
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|Now, excuse me... I need a moment with Aethas.}}
:''Kalecgos walks to Aethas Sunreaver.''
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|Aethas, I brought mana potions, but it's obvious what you really need is rest.}}
:{{Text|Say|Aethas Sunreaver|Rest? No. I am afraid to close my eyes, Kalecgos.}}

Place all six items in the outpost: Flying Carpet, Kirin Tor Banner, Cabinet Display, Enchanted Anvil, Tent, and Mailbox. The mailbox and anvil serve their usual purposes, and the flying carpet is a flight master.

When placing the Flying carpet, it has gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Flying Carpet|<A flying carpet hovers in the air, its fringes trembling with irritation and its threads rippling with discontent.>

{{gossip|quest=|<Gently direct the carpet to an unoccupied spot.>}}}}
