==Objectives==
Clear out [[nerubian]] stragglers.
* [[Faithful of Zirix]] slain (8)

==Description==
Please excuse my absence. It was never my intention to turn my back on the [[Stormriders]], then or now. But I needed to come here and pay my respects to [[Baelgrim]].

Unfortunately, these blasted nerubians are still lingering. I think they're searching for something, but I don't know what. Whatever their reasons, I cannot abide them lurking where Baelgrim fell.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I don't know who or what these nerubians are searching for, but they defile this place with their presence. Clear them out.

==Completion==
This is a gift. Baelgrim may be gone, but [[Zarein|his stormrook]] seems ready to carry on his fight. It's been a long time since I've felt such a connection. Such purpose. I don't intend to turn my back a second time.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Olbarig|How often did we have the same argument about our stormrooks, Baelgrim?}}
:{{text|say|Olbarig|And how often did that blasted titan machine wipe away the memory of it?}}
:''Olbarig walks off.''

Kill the requisite number of [[Faithful of Zirix]], then find Olbarig at the overlook to the north, where he's beset by nerubians. Out of nowhere, Zarein flies in and blasts the nerubians, killing them!
:{{text|say|Olbarig|It's... Zarein! Baelgrim's stormrook!}}
:{{text|say|Olbarig|Zarein! You stayed? Even with Baelgrim gone.}}
:{{text|say|Olbarig|But you're free now. Go! Fly!}}

==Progression==
