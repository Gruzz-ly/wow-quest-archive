[[File:Frontline Farmers.jpg|thumb|Frontline [[Pearl Farmer]]s waiting for weapons]]

==Objectives==
Distribute 3 weapon crates to the pearl farmers at [[Glimmering Shore]].
* Distribute weapon crates (3)

==Description==
Most of the [[farmer]]s are already out in the field, defending their positions. I have trained them as best I could given the circumstances, but they are still wielding farming tools. 

I need you to distribute the weapons you gathered to those on the frontlines. While it may not markedly improve their combat ability, at least it will boost their confidence that they are not alone in this fight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Excellent. As long as they fight together and for each other, I believe we will be victorious.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|What do we do now?}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|There are so many gorlocs!}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|It's all over! We can't win!}}
:{{text|say|Aggartha|Steady now! Trust in your training. And in each other.}}

Pick up [[Pilfered Pearls]] before heading out.

Ghost Weapons Crate locations are marked on the minimap. Interact with one and Pearl Farmers will run up to collect a weapon while named characters have something to say.

North:
:{{text|say|Kaldrinn|So you just want to eat the pearls to live as long as you can?}}
:{{text|say|Eiggard|That's right! Why would you just give yours away if it can extend your lifespan? The end is coming sooner or later!}}
:{{text|say|Kaldrinn|Well if it comes to that, I would much rather give her the pearls to extend her life, not mine.}}

East:
:{{text|say|Merrimack|But why farm pearls at all? Soon there will be no one left to enjoy them.}}
:{{text|say|Dorbund|We do not value the pearls as much as the process. In farming, we work together and spend time with each other towards a common goal.}}
:{{text|say|Dorbund|It is our enjoyment and enrichment of today that we value. Not tomorrow.}}

West:
:{{text|say|Bertola|I am collecting items that I enjoy so that I can leave something of myself when I am gone.}}
:{{text|say|Bertola|Perhaps one day someone else will find and treasure them. In this way I can live on.}}
:{{text|say|Garrak|Preposterous! All our efforts must be focused on restoring the machines that sustain us! Anything else is wasted effort!}}

Just east of the east crate, watch out for the rare gorloc [[Gar'loc]]!

On return after completing both objectives, Aggartha and four Pearl Farmers have relocated slightly and have just fended off a wave of gorlocs:
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|Take that gorlocs!}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|Are we winning?}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|Of course we are!}}

Aggartha has new gossip:
{{dialogue|The farmers have acquitted themselves well. I am proud to fight alongside them.

However, this is not yet over.}}
