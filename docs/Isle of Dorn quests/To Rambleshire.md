'''To Rambleshire''' begins the optional Lost Lord of the Storm chapter of the [[Isle of Dorn storyline]], required for [[Sojourner of Isle of Dorn]].

==Objectives==
Meet Lufsela in Rambleshire.
*Search for [[Lufsela]] at [[Rambleshire]]

==Description==
There's word of troubles in the village of Rambleshire, at the base of [[Thunderhead Peak]].

Can't abide the place myself. Always wet and rumbling.

But Rooktender Lufsela thought it worth a look, however, seeing as how the birds fancy the moss that the village produces. She's still green though, and might just need a hand.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|7|2|25}}
*2,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Rooktender Otwin|Otwin]] sent you? Probably misses my help brushing out the [[Stormrook|rooks]]. But there's something amiss here in Rambleshire.

There should be a storm overhead. Been visible from [[Dornogal]] for as long as I can remember. Without that storm. I fear the local [[mosswool]] operation is in trouble.

==Notes==
Upon entering [[Golgoth]]'s inn:
:{{Text|say|Golgoth|I heard there's a strange rider out by the gates. Do ya mind takin' a look, <race>? See if they need help.}}

Lufsela's gossip:
{{Dialogue|
Clear skies are usually a blessing.
