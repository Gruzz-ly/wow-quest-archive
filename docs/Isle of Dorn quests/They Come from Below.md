==Objectives==
Mount the [[stormrook]] Lokren and slay nerubians in [[Dornogal]].

Most services in Dornogal will be unavailable during this quest.

*[[Lokren]] mounted
*[[Nerubian]] invaders slain (0/100%)
*Regroup with [[Baelgrim]]

==Description==
I do not yet know why you have come here, outlander. But you seem... efficient in killing nerubians.

As are we, the [[Stormriders]], vanguards of this isle.

The nerubians are an ancient enemy. I would not be surprised if this [[Queensguard Zirix|Zirix]] knows and fears me, the Stormward.

Even so, we could use your skill to help us protect Dornogal.

I have a stormrook for you to ride. Mount up and help us rid our city of these insects!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|56|18}}
*13,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I do not know why the nerubians have returned...

Or why they would attack Dornogal.

For now I must focus on assessing the damage to the [[Coreway]].

Our brethren the [[Machine Speakers]] may need our aid, and it is the titans' will that the way to the center of Azeroth be kept open.

==Notes==

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Baelgrim|Even with a novice rider, this stormrook will reduce those spiders to ash.}}

Hop on to start a bombing run:
[[File:They Come from Below.jpg|thumb|A bombing run in [[Dornogal]]]]
:{{Text|say|Baelgrim|Drive back the nerubians around the Coreway. I will handle the ones farther into the city.}}

Use the vehicle abilities to destroy the nerubians:
#{{abilities|Lightning Bolt|Launch a bolt of lightning at the targeted location.|range=500|cd=1.5 sec|notes=Instant}}
#{{abilities|Storm Blast|Blast the targeted location with a burst of storm energy, dealing heavy damage.|range=500|cd=5 sec|notes=Instant.}}

At 100% the bombing run ends and [[Lokren]] flies players down to the Coreway:
:{{Text|say|Baelgrim|They are retreating! Well executed, outlander. Now, I believe you and your friends have much to discuss.}}

The characters nearby have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Moira Thaurissan|I dunnae disagree with Dagran's assessment that this city is a wonder, but...

Though nerubians have done their damage, it seems tae me some cracks were already there--some old enough for ivy and wildflowers to grow through.

This isle may have a military--an' a general in that man Baelgrim. But who is fixin' their potholes?

Somethin' is deeply awry. Keep your eyes open, <name>.}}
{{dialogue|title=Dagran Thaurissan II|To think... we're the first dwarves tae set foot in this city. An earthen city. An earthen civilization!

An' the Coreway! A pathway to the world's core. What a mindblowin' undertakin'. I wish I had seen if before the attack{{Sic|No dot}}

I don't know what we're doin<nowiki>''</nowiki>{{Sic}} next, but I'll be takin' notes all the way!}}
{{dialogue|title=Magni Bronzebeard|The battle that started on [[Dalaran]] is far from over, <name>! An' here I am already sidelined by me injuries--for now. 

I'm lucky ye came to me aid when ye did! An' that the earthen showed up.

Not sure I trust 'em. Especially that Baelgrim. He seems uppity to me. No respect for me or Moira...

<Magni winces in pain.>

But if they will help us with the nerubians... we have tae give them a chance.}}
{{dialogue|title=Thrall|The fight is far from over. 

We must take it to [[Xal'atath]].}}
{{dialogue|title=Anduin Wrynn|Destruction yet again... it's as if it follows me.

Magni is more injured than he's letting on. There must be an inn in this city where we can rest and get our bearings.
}}
{{dialogue|title=Lady Jaina Proudmoore|The earthen are still bringing our wounded to the city.

I am thankful for their aid. I just wish we could have saved more...}}
{{dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|I could find no clues as to Xal'atath's location amongst the wreckage.

We cannot tarry. Xal'atath must pay for what she has done.}}
{{dialogue|title=Stormrider Meirand|Outlander, you are welcome in Dornogal because Baelgrim wills it so.

One wrong move, and I will personally ensure you suffer the full measure of a stormrook's fury.}}
