'''Violent Impact''' begins the [[Isle of Dorn storyline]], starting [[The War Within campaign]] properly. [[Dalaran]] has fallen on the [[Tranquil Strand]] of the [[Isle of Dorn]], so pick up the pieces and move forward.

==Objectives==
Climb out of the rubble and find your surviving leaders.
*Escape the rubble
*Find <Jaina/Thrall> at the [[Tranquil Strand]].

==Description==
<Your vision swims as you slowly regain consciousness. Distant shouts and screams echo in your ringing ears.

The last thing you remember is [[Dalaran]], the great, floating city of [[magic]], plummeting to the earth--then nothing but darkness.

Mixed in with sounds of shouting and battle, you hear a strange, [[insectoid]] chittering.

The [[nerubian]]s were waiting for you.

You must rejoin the fight, but first you need to free yourself from the crushing weight of the rubble piled atop you.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>! You survived!

Good.

Keep your weapons at the ready. This battle is just beginning.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''After a fade to black, the [[adventurer]] is trapped under a Pile of Rubble just offshore of the [[Tranquil Strand]].''
:{{Text|say|[[Kirin Tor Mage (Isle of Dorn)|Kirin Tor Mage]]|Lady Proudmoore! Over here! I found <name>!}}
:{{Text|say|Kirin Tor Mage|I'll get these rocks off you. Just let me--Ahhh!}}
:''A [[Nerubian Ambusher]] pops out of the ground and immediately kills the mage before disappearing.''

Interact with the [[Pile of Rubble (Isle of Dorn)|Pile of Rubble]] three times to clear off rocks and escape, or simply wait five minutes.

While in the area, players remain debuffed with:
:{{abilities|Dangerous Skies|The nerubians swarm the skies, making it too dangerous to fly.|id=456486|icon=spell_nature_insect_swarm2}}

Head on shore to spot [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]] and [[Thrall]] fending off [[Burrowing Saboteur]]s. One of them will call out:
:{{Alliance}} {{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|<Name>, to me!}}
:{{Horde}} {{Text|say|Thrall|<Name>, to me!}}

Should players somehow abandon the quest, interact with the Pile of Rubble to pick the quest back up.
