==Objectives==
Help Architect Brokfor clean up the [[Proscenium]].
* Speak to [[Architect Brokfor|Brokfor]]
* [[Bushy Weeds]] pulled (6)

==Description==
When I wanted the [[Unbound]] to bring their plays to [[Dornogal]], I didn't know what I would be up against. Or that my "help" would get in the way.

My old friend Brokfor keeps interrupting us with his perfectionism. We try to build a set, but he stops everyone to inspect each nail. We try to paint, he complains the colors do not exactly match... you get the idea.

I think Brokfor needs his own project. Maybe... cleaning up the Proscenium? Go ask him to help and keep him occupied.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you helped Brokfor straighten up?

==Completion==
Excellent! Now we can perform our tasks without his perfectionism getting in the way.

==Notes==
Upon accept talk to [[Architect Brokfor]]:
{{dialogue|Huberta wants you to tell me to stop, doesn't she? I can't let her keep working in a place like this.

Have you seen these vines? Someone is going to break a leg!

{{gossip|quest=|Huberta wants me to help you.}} }}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Architect Brokfor|What? Huberta wants the Proscenium put back in order? Finally!}}
:{{text|say|Architect Brokfor|Get those bushy weeds pulled out. This is just the directive I needed.}}

Upon completing the task:
:{{text|say|Architect Brokfor|That's looking better! Tell Huberta I'll get the rest in order. And tell her and those actors to not move an inch!}}

At this point, Brokfor has new gossip:
{{dialogue|Watch your step! This venue violates dozens of directives.

If Huberta wasn't my friend, I'd have carted her to the other side of the Isle for continuing on in a place like this.

It's completely unacceptable.
}}

Upon completion, one can see the Proscenium cleared up:
:{{text|say|Stage Manager Huberta|I must say, Brokfor was right. The Proscenium has never looked better.}}

Also Brokfor has new gossip:
{{dialogue|Whew! How does it look? Thank you for getting me underway.

I never thought Huberta would stop preparing plays long enough to check safety regulations. Guess even your oldest friends can surprise you.}}
