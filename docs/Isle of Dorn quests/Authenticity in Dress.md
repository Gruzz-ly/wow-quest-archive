==Objectives==
Speak with [[Rabaan]] in the [[Proscenium]].

==Description==
You've done very well as an actor on stage, <name>.

But as an actor in a troupe, there are other directives we must carry out. One directive is to preserve our costumes for use in future plays. Many costumes we use more than once.

I think we can trust you with using and preserving the troupes' costumes, don't you think? It would mean you could practice with us more frequently...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|80|90}}
*1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Excellent. I cherish every barrier I can remove between an actor and their directive.

Treat the costumes with care. We will be using them in future plays, remember.

Good luck! And don't forget you're part of the troupe now!

==Progression==
{{The Proscenium}}
