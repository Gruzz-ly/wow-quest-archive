==Objectives==
Destroy 5 Damaged Arcane Relics.
*[[Damaged Arcane Relic]]s destroyed (5)
*Return to Jaina at the Tranquil Strand.
*[[Scroll of Shattering]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Dalaran]] housed many precious and powerful relics. Many of them were damaged in the crash and are now malfunctioning.

They must be destroyed!

Take this scroll. I have stored a shattering spell within it. Read the words aloud and its [[magic]] will be unleashed.

Report what you have done to [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]] when you are through. She will understand.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It pains me, but we have to destroy the malfunctioning relics!

==Completion==
Destroying more of Dalaran seems unconscionable.

But you and Aethas did the right thing.

They were unstable, and we could not risk their power being used against us.

==Notes==
After recovering Aetha's mana in [[Urgent Recovery]], he starts this quest.

On accept:
:{{Text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|Use this scroll. These relics must be destroyed before they overload!}}

On completion of all three:
:''Anduin Wrynn runs up.''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Jaina! Thrall! We need help! Magni is in trouble.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Anduin! You're alive!}}

==Progression==
