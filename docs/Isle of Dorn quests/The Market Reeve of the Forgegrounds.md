==Description==
I've heard liquid opal tastes remarkable but no matter how often I peruse the auctions here, it's never for sale. It's quite rare.

Luckily for you, there is one person who can find the stuff. Vokgret, the market reeve of the [[Forgegrounds]]. Nothing circulates in the city's flow of trade without her knowledge.

I don't often try to do business with one as... connected as her. But you'll have no qualms about it, I'm sure!

At this hour, you'll find her over by the inn.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Vokgret speaks without looking up from her paperwork.>

The city certainly is a busy place.

==Completion==
Each corner of the Forgeground works in unison with each other like cogs in a machine.

All it takes is a single piece to fail to bring it all down.

But despite the disruptions, you have proven yourself resourceful.

Keep this up and the right people will begin to notice.

If they have not already.

<Vokgret peers at you over her spectacles and smiles.>

==Notes==
Upon meeting with [[Vokgret]] near [[Stonelight Rest]] inn:
:{{Text|say|Vokgret|Another outlander come to do business. Be a dear and grab me a mug first.}}

{{Dialogue|Whatever business you're here for will have to wait, dear.

It's been a terribly long day and I've yet to have my first mug of cinderbrew.

I don't do business until I have had a taste of its sweet fire.

{{Gossip|quest=|Here's your cinderbrew. Now, can we do business?}}

{{Dialogue-child|My, that was quick!

Thank you, dear.

You must need something very urgently.

I am Vokgret, reeve of the Forgeground and markets. How may I serve?

{{Gossip|quest=|I am looking for liquid opal. I am told you have the resources to acquire some.}}
}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Vokgret|I can acquire liquid opal, but in return I require a favor. My auditor, Loldren, is late with this week's records. Fetch them for me.}}

{{Dialogue|<Vokgret takes a sip of her cinderbrew before looking up at you.>

Finding your liquid opal will take time, my precious little pebble.

So while my moles around the market sniff out what you seek, I would appreciate if we put your resourcefulness to use.
}}

Go to [[Loldren]] in the [[Inscription]] shop in the [[Forgegrounds]]:
{{Dialogue|<The earthen doesn't acknowledge you as he pores over the stacks of scrolls and paperwork around him.>

{{Gossip|quest=|Vokgret sent me to collect some paperwork.}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Loldren|Vokgret sent you? Well, if she wants her paperwork, then you're helping me with mine. Start with that open manifest and fill in the blanks!}}

Interact with [[Auditor's Manifest]] nearby:
{{Dialogue|<The Auditor's Manifest is covered in checklists and spaces to note details of recent transactions.

Several categories and sections remain blank, evidently left unfilled by a merchant who had hastily filled it out.>

{{Gossip|quest=|<Begin filling out the blank sections on the form.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|<The first section of the audit was filled out by a famous earthen author. They seemed to have forgotten to record the title of their most popular book. Fill in the blank!>

:{{Text|say|Loldren|There. That is most of what she needs. Except... you will need to get this work order signed by Nernabel next door.}}

Go to [[Nernabel]] in the [[Jewelcrafting]] store nearby:
{{Dialogue|Task... interrupted? I'm a little busy at the moment.

If you are here to make an order, please see Uthaga outside!

{{Gossip|quest=|Loldren requires your signature on this document.}}
{{Dialogue-child|Loldren should know the chaos here in the city has backed up our supply lines!

My order of magma cores from the Deeps never materialized. I cannot complete this work order, much less sign a form stating I have.

{{Gossip|quest=|Where can I find a magma core for you?}}
}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Nernabel|In the Forgegrounds furnace. Depleted magma cores are used to keep the forges hot.}}

Go acquire the [[Sizzling Magma Core]] from the center of the Forgegrounds. When picked up, a [[Enraged Magma Fury]] appears. After defeating the elemental, return to Nernabel:
{{Dialogue|The magma core is the last reagent for this repair.

It is an old heirloom for someone out in the--well, it is an old heirloom. That is all that matters.

{{Gossip|quest=|I've brought you a magma core. An elemental attacked me for my trouble.}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Nernabel|Another magma elemental in the forge? I am sorry. Hopefully my signature is compensation for your trouble.}}
:{{Text|say|Nernabel|I will have this fitted before the courier arrives. Thanks again!}}

Return to Vokgret:
{{Dialogue|<Vokgret's attention remains on the paperwork in front of her.>}}
