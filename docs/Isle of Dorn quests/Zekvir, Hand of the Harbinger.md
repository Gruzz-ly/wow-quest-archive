==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Zekvir.jpg|Zekvir, Hand of the Harbinger|A monstrous creature hunting adventurers in delve.}}
Defeat [[Zekvir]], the Hand of the Harbinger within his own delve.
* Zekvir slain within the delve, [[Zekvir's Lair]]

==Description==
We'll have tae watch out for Zekvir as we go exploring into delves. I don't think we're strong enough tae take him on just yet, but we will be!

Let's keep explorin' and gettin' treasure until we're tough enough tae track down his lair and defeat him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]
*[[Toxic Victory]]

==Progress==
Make sure tae keep an eye out for Zekvir!

==Completion==
We did it! We made this place safe for all adventurers.

This should put [[Xal'atath]] in a tough spot, now that she's missing one of her most powerful toadies.

==Notes==
See [[Zekvir]] for abilities and the strategy.

==Progression==
{{Delves Season 1}}

*{{Hotfix|date=2024-09-13|bluenote=No longer requires that you complete the Delve seasonal journey.}}
