==Objectives==
Find a Cheery Bomb, hidden inside a Dastardly prop. Smack it before it blows up.
* Kick a Cheery Bomb

==Description==
Goblins love bombs, I get that. But does EVERYTHING have to blow up?

Do me a favor: In the next [[Dastardly Duos]] match you enter, find a cheery bomb inside one of the wooden tree and planter props.

After you find the bomb, but before it  "blows up"... smack it for me. Don't worry, they're cowards.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 2x [[Bullhorn of Calling]]
* 5x [[Master Key (Dastardly Duos)]]

==Progress==
Those cheery bombs are asking for it, <name>. Find one in a Dastardly Duos match and smack it!

==Completion==
Way to go, <name>. You have to show those bombs who's boss, you know?

==Notes==
While clearing trash, also damage the props in the area. One of them will pop out a Cheery Bomb. Kick it!
