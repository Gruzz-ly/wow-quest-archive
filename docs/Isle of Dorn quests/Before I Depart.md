==Objectives==
Meet [[Urtago]] at the [[Mourning Rise]] memorial site.

==Description==
I can feel my energy reserves depleting.

I will soon not be able to execute my duties. That is why I have Urtago here to take over.

Before my systems grind to a halt, I must make sure Mourning Rise is free of [[kobold]]s. They have invaded the memorial site I tend and plunder the [[Unbound]] shrines and bodies that are there.

Maybe it is good you are here. You may have the strength to help us.

Please, help Urtago rid the site of kobolds.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Korgran still calls himself the caretaker, but I'm the one who has been taking care of Mourning Rise for some time.

I don't mind. Korgran is very kind. 

But the situation here has gotten away from me. We have some work ahead of us.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Korgran|It is my duty as caretaker. I have to do it before I shutdown.}}
:{{text|say|Urtago|No, let me take care of the kobolds. It is the least I can do for you.}}

They both have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Korgran|Huh? Do I know you?

No? Good. My memory isn't what it used to be.

I am Korgran, caretaker of Mourning Rise, a place for Unbound who are ready for their final shutdown.

Those who come here for their final moments do so to break the [[titan]]s' cycle and to be remembered as the Unbound they chose to be.

Unless your kind experiences stasis lock as we do, I'm not sure what help I can give you.}}

{{dialogue|title=Urtago|The titans are not coming back, this we Unbound are sure of.

This outpost is a dedicated location to prepare Unbound, like us, for their shutdown.

Caretaker Korgran have been doing this for a long time, and soon it will be my turn to take over. 

It is up to me to prepare Korgran for his upcoming shutdown. 

It is an honor, but I am anxious. I... am not looking forward to it.}}

Inside the house is a letter:
{{book|[[Korgran's Request]]|content=Urtago,

These written words are my memoir indicating my will and wish to follow the path of Kriegyvald like many Unbound have done before. This is my request for a final shutdown.

It is my choice, my decision, and the last chain I shatter to become truly free of the titans' grasp. I know that when time comes you will honor it and grant me that final moment of peace.

I do have one wish that is outside of our traditional course for a final shutdown. I wish to be left by the shore in the place I travel to when I need some time for myself. I am aware that it is not what we do, but I implore you to consider it when the time comes.

Do not worry when it does. Mourning Rise would be in good hands--your hands.

May you forge your path well,

Korgran.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Korgran|Do you have the explosives?}}
:{{text|say|Urtago|Don't worry Korgran, I have more than enough.}}
:{{text|say|Korgran|I just don't want you to return cracked and chipped.}}
:{{text|say|Urtago|I'll be careful. I wouldn't want to leave you alone with no one to take care of you.}}
:''Urtago walks off.''

Catch up with Urtago at Mourning Rise, overrun by kobolds:
{{dialogue|title=Urtago|Look at what these kobolds have done!

<Urtago sighs heavily.>

I am happy that Korgran hasn't seen this. He needs to rest and conserve his energy. That may stave off his shutdown a little longer. At least until we're finished here!}}
