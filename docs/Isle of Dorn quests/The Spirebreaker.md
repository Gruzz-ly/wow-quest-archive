==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Anub'esska.png||Anub'esska prefers to ambush her prey from below. A tactic that's well known by now, but highly effective.}}
Slay Anub'esska on the road near [[Rambleshire]] in the [[Isle of Dorn]].
* [[Anub'esska]] slain

==Description==
We are no strangers to [[nerubian]] attacks. The [[Kirin Tor]] is well equipped to handle such a threat. [[Dalaran]]...

Was equipped. I cannot fend all of this town's foes, but you might be able to. I spotted an ambush near the road on the way here. An all too familiar tactic of an all too familiar foe. Go spring the trap and slay the monster that lurks below.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 13,000 [[XP]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+100 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) (first time) or 5x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
Are they safe now?

==Completion==
Thank goodness. With your aid, we may be able to make a difference... this time.

These people deserve safety.
