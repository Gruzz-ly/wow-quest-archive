'''Survivor's Guilt''' begins the Fate of the Kirin Tor storyline, unlocked the week of 7 January 2025 during the [[Siren Isle campaign]]. This storyline awards the [[Fate of the Kirin Tor]] achievement. Find [[Khadgar]] in the [[Foundation Hall]] of [[Dornogal]] to begin.

==Objectives==
Find [[Aethas Sunreaver]] in the [[Tranquil Strand]].

==Description==
We have all suffered from [[Xal'atath]]'s deeds, some more than others.

I am glad to be alive, even if I now feel as old as I look.

<[[Khadgar]] tries to laugh but coughs instead. He waves off your worry.>

Don't worry about me. But Aethas...

I've heard he went back to [[Dalaran]]'s crash site. And that he hasn't slept or eaten since we arrived.

He wants my help, but I haven't been able to bring myself to visit the crash site.

Will you go in my stead?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
<Aethas's posture is etched with the exhaustion of sleepless nights and days without food. His tattered clothes hang loosely on his emaciated frame, and his every movement seems fatigued.>

I see. I knew Khadgar was gravely injured but... it did not occur to me that his wounds were more than physical.

I respect his choice not to come here.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Archmage Khadgar|We all grieve Dalaran, but Aethas may need help processing its loss.}}

Head to the Tranquil Strand to meet up with Aethas. On approach:
:{{Text|Say|Aethas Sunreaver|No, that's... not quite right.}}

==Progression==
