==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Kix'arak.jpg|Kix'arak|A  monstrous foe with even more monstrous intentions.}}
Defeat Kix'arak outside of the [[Opalcreg Mine]].
* [[Kix'arak]] slain

==Description==
To make sure no other earthen gets harmed we're going to have to eliminate their leader.

You know the saying, rid yourself of the foreman and the whole line collapses.

Either way, to get to safety we're going to have to go through them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 13,000 [[XP]]

You will receive one from:
*[[Belt of Kix'arak's Bane]]
*[[Shoulders of Kix'arak's Bane]]
*[[Boots of Kix'arak's Bane]]
*[[Gauntlets of Kix'arak's Bane]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+100 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) (first time) or 25x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Completion==
You made it back, I was beginning to think all hope was destroyed.

[[Alvegar]] filled me in with the issue. I'm just glad all our people are safe, and we got the opal too.

A small win, but a win.

==Notes==
Upon engaging Kix'arak:
:{{text|say|Kix'arak|For The Queen!}}

Upon defeat:
:{{text|say|Kix'arak|All... Our... Plans...}}

After defeating Kix'arak go back to Germira in [[Freywold Village]], she has gossip:
{{Dialogue|We will build a new energy source. Just a matter of figuring it out.}}

==Progression==
{{Opalcreg}}
