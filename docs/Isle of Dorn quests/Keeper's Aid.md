==Objectives==
Use Freydrin's Shilelagh to purify [[Boskroot Basin]].
* Infected Wildlife cleansed (4)
* Stone Ward destroyed (4)
* [[Freydrin's Shillelagh#Keeper's Aid]] (provided)

==Description==
Magical staff? Wards? What were you doing, [[Woldkeeper Freydrin|Freydrin]]?

<[[Wildtender Igris|Igris]] ruminates briefly, her brow crinkling and eyes aglow. After a moment, she turns to you with a smile carved into her face.>

I've got it! 

The life energy in this staff should overcome any mycotic corruptions in the wildlife here. Then you return them to the natural cycle and the land will heal on its own in time.

And if you see any wards, take them down. Take her memory gem just in case. It may yield more information yet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There is much latent magic buried within this staff. It may be our only hope to bring these fungarians to heel.

==Completion==
Simply fascinating.

==Notes==
[[Ancient Stone Ward]]s are marked on the minimap:
:{{text|say|Woldkeeper Freydrin|First offering: These wards will protect the bosk while I undergo restoration. They're no replacement, but they'll hold for short periods.}}
:{{text|say|Woldkeeper Freydrin|Second offering: What would They say if they returned and saw me reliant on wards to fulfill my edicts? I just don't have it in me anymore. Soon...}}
:{{text|say|Woldkeeper Freydrin|Third offering: I have awakened Gladebark. It will keep this place while I keep watch for Their return.}}
:{{text|say|Woldkeeper Freydrin|Fourth offering: Even Gladebark begins to rot. Is this to be all our destiny? How long...}}

Near one of the wards is a [[Long-Forgotten Earthen]] near which you gain an ability [[Witness Final Moments]], allowing you to see their death.

Use the provided [[Freydrin's Shillelagh#Keeper's Aid]] on [[Elder Shalehorn]]s, [[Infected Peafowl]] and [[Mycotic Shalehorn]]s.
