'''Farewell, City of Magic''' concludes the [[Fate of the Kirin Tor]] storyline.

==Objectives==
Place mementos brought by [[Dalaran]] survivors on the boats in the [[Tranquil Strand]].
* Mementos placed on boats (3)
* Speak with [[Jaina]]

==Description==
Not all the [[Kirin Tor]]'s issues can be solved in one day.

But one way we can act is to honor those who have fallen. After speaking with everyone here, we have cobbled together a ceremony to send off those we have lost... and Dalaran.

We would be honored if you would join us and participate in remembering our fallen comrades in the Kirin Tor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* [[Fate of the Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
One thing I am sure of is that the Kirin Tor's future is not another floating fortress in the sky.

No, whatever path the Kirin Tor chooses, it will be firmly rooted here, on Azeroth, among the people it serves.

==Completion==
I will stay here with all of you and help however I can.

==Notes==
[[File:Farewell City of Magic mementos.jpg|thumb|[[Kel'Thuzad's Emerald Necklace]], [[Shattered Dalaran Crystals]], and [[Thalen Songweaver's Notes]]]]
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|[[Kalecgos]]|Everyone brought a memento of someone we lost to commit to the ocean.}}

Three objects light up on the table between Kalecgos and Aethas: [[Kel'Thuzad's Emerald Necklace]], some [[Shattered Dalaran Crystals]], and [[Thalen Songweaver's Notes]]. Place each object in one of the empty boats.

[[Kel'Thuzad's Emerald Necklace]]:
:{{Text|Say|[[Archmage Khadgar]]|No matter how painful, we must embrace change as we honor those we have lost.}}

[[Shattered Dalaran Crystals]]:
:{{Text|Say|[[Archmage Aethas Sunreaver]]|As we send them off, we let go of the past to face the future and become stronger.}}

[[Thalen Songweaver's Notes]]:
:{{Text|Say|[[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]]|We must acknowledge our past errors and correct our course.}}

Speak with Jaina:
{{Dialogue|Closure is finding peace in saying goodbye.

{{Gossip|quest=|Let's begin.}}}}

An [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cutscene]] starts playing:
{{#ev:youtube|lsJmgJxvUVg|Farewell, City of Magic}}
:''Jaina sends the boats off and she lifts them all into the sky. The adventurer, Khadgar, Kalecgos, and the mages use their magic and destroy the boats with the artifacts.''

After the cutscene, Jaina has new gossip:
{{dialogue|I am grateful for what you and Aethas have done here.

Our fallen comrades deserved this--and more.

We will grieve them and Dalaran still, but now...

Now, we can make plans for the future.}}

On completion:
:''The unnamed characters teleport away one by one.''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|So... what now?}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|We rebuild. But not just brick and mortar. We need changes to our foundation--to us.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Agreed. We must move forward with intention. And learn from the mistakes we were too prideful to before.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|I admit I was blinded by the ivory towers of Dalaran... I believed the Kirin Tor's wisdom was nigh infallible.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Let us pledge then that the new Kirin Tor will be different. No more councils, no more floating cities, and no more meddling in world affairs.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Then we are all in agreement. We will start anew. For the Kirin Tor. For all of us.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Good. Because this old man is tired. I will go to Dornogal to rest. And then start rebuilding the connections we have lost.}}
:''Khadgar teleports away. The remaining three start walking to the south.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Are you going to stay, Kalecgos?}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|The Dragon Isles can endure a little longer without me. We have much work to do.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|More mages are arriving to lend their strength. We need to start planning how we want to spend our resources.}}

In [[Foundation Hall]], Khadgar has new gossip:
{{dialogue|There is much to reflect on, <name>.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:''Jaina Proudmoore appears out of a portal and walks up to Khadgar and Alleria.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Jaina, I thought you were staying to help in the Tranquil Strand.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I was. But we should speak about the future of the Kirin Tor sooner rather than later.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I'm afraid the news from outside is bleak. We lost all but a few after amassing at Dalaran.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Then... our new Kirin Tor is over before it began.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|No, the mages who have answered the call... We have an opportunity. No council. No rank.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Like starting over? Returning to study and research?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|But we have a duty to protect the Alliance--and Azeroth.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|We can still fulfill that mission by investigating. Training. Advising.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|It would keep us mobile and decentralized. A tragedy like Dalaran would not happen again.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Safety is a benefit, yes.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Study and passing on my knowledge appeals to me. But I have to think about the ramifications of such a drastic change.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|And that is why it should be you who starts putting the pieces back together.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Khadgar...}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I need rest, Jaina. But... I promise I won't stay away for long.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Meryl can assist me. Aethas should have a key role as well. I will go back and speak to them.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Thank you, Jaina. And good luck.}}
:''Jaina creates a portal and takes it.''

Back at the new Tranquil Strand camp, several characters have new gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Kalecgos|That was beautiful, <name>.

I... well, I don't have any words. Well done.}}
{{dialogue|title=Apprentice M'ila|Gotta keep training for whatever lies ahead!}}
{{dialogue|title=Meryl Felstorm|For Dalaran.

For the Kirin Tor.

Now, let's get to work.}}

===Tranquil Strand gossip===
Before completing the quest, all of the unnamed characters have unique gossip on the Tranquil Strand:
{{dialogue|title=Kirin Tor Survivor (before quest pick-up)|Is this really all that's left?

No, it can't be. There were still mages in the field. Like in the Dragon Isles.

Though... I feel I had heard their efforts were winding down.

What about the council? Khadgar is here... Jaina... Aethas, of course.

I wonder... I wonder what my rank is now?

I'm sorry. I shouldn't be thinking about that, should I. It's all so sudden. I'm very out of sorts.}}
{{dialogue|title=Kirin Tor Survivor (after quest pick-up)|I still cannot believe Dalaran is gone.

And I was there when it crashed!}}

{{dialogue|title=Kirin Tor Survivor|I... do not recognize anyone here...

Save Khadgar, Jaina, and Kalecgos. I cannot say I even know Aethas well...

Many of my peers I will never know what befell them--whether they died in the crash or in the fighting thereafter.

I am unsure how to mourn them. How do I mourn what I cannot quantify?}}
{{dialogue|title=Kirin Tor Survivor|<This Kirin Tor survivor looks at you and crosses their arms tightly, quickly looking away.>

Yes, yes. I am in mourning as well.

<Seeing your puzzled look, the survivor sighs and lets their guard down.>

I'm not one for people, okay? I have less friends than I have fingers on one hand--and none of them were on Dalaran when it crashed.

I miss my favorite quiet spot more than I do anything else. Don't tell anyone, please? I still want to be here for... whoever. I don't know.}}
{{dialogue|title=Sunreaver Battlemage|I am relieved to see that some of my brethren survived the crash--and the battle for Khaz Algar.

But there are so many we have lost.}}
{{dialogue|title=Sunreaver Battlemage|My clothes still stink of the foul nerubians' ichor.

I have already mourned my comrades' passing--by taking down a foe for each of them and then some.

I do not need any quaint ceremony... 

But I will stand with Aethas no matter my feelings.}}
{{dialogue|title=Silver Covenant Spellcaster|I understand the need to mourn, but do we really have time for this?

Should we not be instead thinking ahead about plans and reprisals?

Dalaran's ruins are at our feet. Should we not be marching ahead to root out the evil that cast it down?}}
{{dialogue|title=Silver Covenant Spellcaster|If I had not taken leave to help care for my sister and her newborn, they would be mourning me here as well.

The rest of my regiment--save my second, standing in the back--did not survive the crash.

I am glad still others of the Silver Covenant have survived, but I must do what I can to honor those who lost their lives under my command--and others who lost their lives on Dalaran... no matter their affiliation.}}
{{dialogue|title=Silver Covenant Spellcaster|We must treat this occasion with the solemnity that it deserves. 

Do you not agree, <race>?}}
{{dialogue|title=Sunreaver Battlemage|Now I know my sister...

I had hoped she was just... lost. 

But she did not heed Aethas's call.}}
{{dialogue|title=Kirin Tor Survivor|I still cannot believe Dalaran is gone.

And I was there when it crashed!}}
{{dialogue|title=Silver Covenant Spellcaster|I am heartened that everyone is putting aside their differences at least for now...}}
{{dialogue|title=Kirin Tor Survivor|<This Kirin Tor mage has obviously been crying for some time.>

I'm... trying not to cry.}}
{{dialogue|title=Sunreaver Battlemage|The sacrifices the Sunreavers have made...

I am proud to call myself one of them.}}
{{dialogue|title=Kirin Tor Survivor|Seeing Jaina, Aethas, Kalecgos, and Khadgar here is... comforting.}}
{{dialogue|title=Silver Covenant Spellcaster|<This spellcaster is clutching a small, woven-silver bracelet set with a fiery, red stone. 

It looks to be of dwarven design. 

Her head is bowed, and her eyes are tightly shut.>}}
{{dialogue|title=Sunreaver Battlemage|Hm?

I am not in the mood to chat, <race>.}}
{{dialogue|title=Silver Covenant Spellcaster|I should not be here.

And I am... afraid to face my commander now that she has returned because of why.

In her absence, I was tiring of command. So, I feigned illness for the day.

Make no mistake, when Dalaran was attacked, I immediately joined the battle.

But because I was not there when the nerubians first attacked, I survived.

I... do not know how to deal with this shame.}}
{{dialogue|title=Sunreaver Battlemage|<This battlemage seems to be somewhere far away.

He does not register your approach.>}}


One unnamed character has different gossip after quest turn-in, in the short time before he teleports away.
{{dialogue|title=Kirin Tor Survivor|While the boats disappeared in the air, I thought of all those I held dear and wished them well... wherever they are.

I hope that I can find them again--either on Azeroth or beyond.

If I cannot mourn them, at least I can let go of the worry and be at peace.}}
