==Objectives==
Hear [[Vereesa Windrunner]]'s tale.
*Listen to [[Vereesa Windrunner]]'s tale.
*Speak with Vereesa Windrunner overlooking the northern cliff on Oztan Isle.

==Description==
We came here so Vereesa could get closer to the source of her visions. Unfortunately, it has only made them stronger, not clearer.

But this is her story. She should be the one to tell it.

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
*[["Raising Your Eyes" Painting]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|11|70}}

==Completion==
This seems a fitting place to honor my late husband, Rhonin.

We should get on with the ceremony.

==Notes==
Speak with Vereesa
{{dialogue|Thank you for coming, Restorer of [[Quel'Delar]]. It is an honor to have you here.

The Radiant Song has been singing to me. It's... her visions come and go, but they're vague. Destruction, screaming. death.

Since we came here, the visions have become stronger and more painful. I can manage.

Come, we have much to discuss and not much time, I fear.

:{{Text|Say|Vereesa Windrunner|As he did you, Arator. Come. That cliff to the north looks like a good place.}}
:''Vereesa and Arator mount up.''

Follow them to the northern cliff on Oztan Isle.
:{{Text|Say|Vereesa Windrunner|This will do nicely.}}

Arator has a gossip:
{{dialogue|I'm worried about my aunt, <name>. These visions are getting worse and I'm afraid of what they'll do to her.}}
