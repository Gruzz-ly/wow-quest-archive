'''Thunderhead Butt''' concludes the optional Lost Lord of the Storm chapter of the [[Isle of Dorn storyline]], required for [[Sojourner of Isle of Dorn]].

==Objectives==
Accompany [[Durzan]] to [[Belzt]] on [[Thunderhead Peak]].
*Durzan and Belzt reunited

==Description==
Durzan looks hale and hearty again. That moss packs a real punch.

I have a sense that he's ready to go. I just wish we had more time. I have so many questions. But the greatest of those questions will be answered when he reaches the peak.

We shouldn't send him up there alone. But I think he trusts you to take him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]
*180x [[Resonance Crystals]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+500 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) (first time) or 205x[[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
We'll be watching from here. I truly hope Belzt is up there waiting.

==Completion==
The legends were true. The storms, the rooks, and these rams. They're all connected.

I have so much more to learn. But thank you for setting me on this path.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''Stenspor and Lufsela slightly move away.''
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|Good luck to you!}}

Senspor has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|Durzan and Belzt were here long before us. Some even say they witnessed Freya pass as she first walked the land.}}

Follow Durzan. He attacks hostile beasts and the [[Shadow Vanguard]] nerubians on the way through [[Thunderhead Peak]]. Then the two ramoliths are reunited, they jump up the mountain. Above, ghostly images of them run at each other, performing the headbutt that begins the storm. [[File:Thunderhead_Butt.png|thumb|Belzt and Durzan headbutt each other over Thunderhead Peak]]

:{{Text|say|Head Rancher Stenspor|What's next for you, Stormrider?}}
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|Not a Stormrider. Just a Rooktender. But I'd stay on a bit, if I could.}}
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|I can feel some kind of connection here...}}
:{{Text|say|Head Rancher Stenspor|To the storm.}}
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|Perhaps. If the storms are where the rooks first came from, then I need to know more.}}

;Upon turn in (After Ties That Bind questline)
:{{Text|say|Head Rancher Stenspor|What's next for you, Stormrider?}}
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|Stormward, actually, and still getting used to it. But I'd stay on a bit, if I could.}}
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|I can feel some kind of connection here...}}
:{{Text|say|Head Rancher Stenspor|To the storm.}}
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|We know the storms are where the rooks come from, but I'd like to know more.}}

Lufsela and Stenspor have new gossip after:
{{Dialogue|title=Lufsela|
I can feel something in the storm. Is it a sense of gratitude?

I still have a lot to more to learn, it seems. About the rooks and the storms from which they are born.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Stenspor |
The storm permeates all around us, including our flocks. We'd be lost without it.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Kiespuch|
<Rancher Kiespuch nods in thanks.}}
