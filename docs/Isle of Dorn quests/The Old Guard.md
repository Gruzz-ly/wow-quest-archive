==Objectives==
Follow the signal and witness a second memory
* Investigate Collapsed Tunnel
* Use the Titan Emitter
*[[Manifested Protocol]] slain
* [[Titan Emitter]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Dornic]]... [[Galan]]... I've heard those names at the [[Proscenium]]!

But who was speakin'? They were nae happy with Galan. All those [[earthen]] bodies...

Repurposed... like reprogrammed? Tae protect what?

Let's chase the other signal. Looks like it leads up ahead intae the hills.

I'm goin' to stay here with [[Brinthe]] an' investigate this tower further. You take the device.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|56|18}}
*13,000 [[XP]]
*[[Reconstructed Ledger]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+500 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) and 180x [[Resonance Crystals]] (first time) or 360x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
I'll stay here with Brinthe. I dunnae want anythin' to happen tae her.

==Completion==
You saw another memory? And it attacked ye?

That's awe--I mean, I'm so glad ye are okay.

While ye were tracin' the signal, I found more notes. I put 'em together for ye to read. It's more about Dornic and Galan.

But it looks like we know where Galan ended up at least without 'em--buried under tons o' rock. But what was she guardin'?

What was so important that she was repurposed tae safeguard it for thousands of years?

Argh! We have more questions than answers. I dunnae like it.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Speaker Brinthe|The voice seems to indicate that perhaps something else is here.}}
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Did ye nae say there was another signal? We should track it!}}
:{{Text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Affirmative. But I would exercise caution. There could be unknown dangers locked away here.}}

Find the artifact near a collapsed tunnel entrance. Use the Archaic Revelation extra action button to summon a [[Manifested Protocol]]:
:{{Text|say|Manifested Protocol|Vault breach! Structural integrity failure.}}
Upon reaching 50% health:

:{{Text|say|Manifested Protocol|Collapse protocol active.}}

Upon defeat:
:{{Text|say|Manifested Protocol|Must protect the... must protect the... must... protecttt...}}
:''The watcher projection teleports.''

The arm of a [[Buried Guardian]], presumably [[Galan]], can be seen popping out of the rubble in the tunnel.

;Upon return after killing the [[Manifested Protocol]]
:{{Text|say|Speaker Brinthe|The pain... It's gone. I can think clearly...}}

;Upon turn in
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|I have so many questions now. More than I have answers.}}
:{{Text|say|Speaker Brinthe|Yes. But at least now we know what questions to ask.}}
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|True. Like who was that voice, a keeper? What was Galan reprogrammed to protect?}}
:{{Text|say|Speaker Brinthe|I have questions as well... But I am sure we will learn the answers in time.}}
