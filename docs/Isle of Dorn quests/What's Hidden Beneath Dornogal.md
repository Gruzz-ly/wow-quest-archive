==Objectives==
Restart the central mainframe in the [[Vault of Memory (Isle of Dorn)|Vault of Memory]] in [[Dornogal]].
* Restart the central console

==Description==
Strange. The mechanism and console here is{{sic}} receiving power, but I cannot initialize the reboot sequence.

[[Dagran Thaurissan II|Dagran]]'s query may have to wait.

I have been able to ascertain the facility's designation: the "Vault of Memory." This leads me to believe that my original theory was correct. It is connected to the [[Archive]] in Dornogal.

Perhaps since both of you are familiar with this type of [[titan]] installation you may have a better chance bringing it fully online.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Take your time. It has been here for millennia. I am sure it is not going anywhere.

==Completion==
I now have access to the mainframe here in the Vault of Memory. 

There is a lot here but... it is fragmented. It will take time to recompile it.

And some data, I'm afraid, may be damaged and need repair.

==Notes==
[[File:What's Hidden Beneath Dornogal - Rewire the mainframe circuit board.jpg|thumb|There are three puzzles that increase in difficulty. Here two are already completed, signified by illuminated glyphs.]]

On accept:
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Go on then, <name>. Have a go. I'll help ye if I can.}}

The [[Central Archives Console]] lights up. Interact with it:

{{Dialogue|<The Console's surface is adorned with shifting patterns and pulsating jewels. Encased in time-worn stone, its mechanism--a labyrinth of arcane gears and glyphs--lies dormant, unable to automatically restart.>

{{gossip|quest=|<Attempt restarting the console.>}}}}
:''The player is prompted with a wire untangling puzzle, as to "Rewire the mainframe circuit board"''

Complete the puzzle:
:{{Text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|It's reinitializing... I now have access. But...}}
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|But? But what?}}

Now active, the description of the console has been updated.
{{Dialogue|<Alive with swirling patterns and vibrant jewels pulsating with arcane energy, the Console is encased in a shimmering aura of power, its mechanism--a symphony of whirring gears and dancing glyphs--thrums with life.>}}

Dagran has a new <Stay awhile and listen.> gossip option:
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|I feel the earthen have come a long way since last we were here in the Archive.}}
:{{Text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|A factual statement. When I first answered your queries, the Archive was lost to us. As were the Stonevault and Awakening Machine.}}
:{{Text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|But now we have a future. And slowly we will also have our past. Largely we have you and your "clan" to thank for it.}}
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Ye needn't mention it, High Speaker. I'm just glad ye'll be around for... as long as ye were meant to be.}}
:{{Text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|Thank you. I will admit that I approach that prospect with some trepidation.}}
:{{Text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|The earthen that are emerging from the Stonevault will take our culture to the ends of Azeroth but...}}
:{{Text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|Who knows what lurks here in our past? What will we uncover about our purpose and the titans?}}
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|I hadna thought o' that. Well, come what may, I'll be here to help ye.}}
:{{Text|say|High Speaker Brinthe|Your continued assistance is appreciated. I feel... you have made me feel as though I am part of your "clan".}}
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|To properly be part o' my clan ye'd have to marry my Gran'da or the like. But that would nae work for many reasons.}}
:{{Text|emote|Brinthe looks puzzled.}}
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|That was a joke, Brinthe. Ye'll always be part o' my clan--blood, water, or stone.}}
