==Objectives==
Free 8 Abducted Lumberjacks.
* [[Abducted Lumberjack]] freed (8)
*Meet Peacekeeper Leif at the north end of Skolzgal Mill.

==Description==
While I do enjoy beating the black blood out of [[nerubian]]s, we must save the [[earthen]] [[prisoner]]s first.

I saw they're being held by [[Arathi]] ball and chain. Someone like you should be able to shatter them pretty quick. Just... do that thing you do!

Oh, and we should split up to cover more ground. Yeah [[Peacekeeper Leif|Leif]]'s gonna complain, but he's always complaining anyway.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}

==Progress==
C'mon, there's no time to waste!

==Completion==
Well done. I will lead the few I was able to rescue to safety.

==Notes==
Upon accept of both quests:
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|I am surprised at how much you care for the earthen.}}
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|Like I said, it's part of my faith to help those in need, no matter who they are.}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|So you are required to follow these tenets? It is an edict for you?}}
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|I'm not required to, Leif. I choose to. Even when I don't want to, I choose to. Because I know it makes the world a little bit brighter.}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif| ... I would like to learn more about your faith, Kaerter.}}

Freed the earthen by interacting with [[Lumberjack Restraints]]. They say:
:{{text|say|Abducted Lumberjack|You have my gratitude friend!}}
:{{text|say|Abducted Lumberjack|[[Shipwright Isaebela|The shipwright]]! She is the mastermind!}}
:{{text|say|Abducted Lumberjack|This lumber is for their airships!}}
:{{text|say|Abducted Lumberjack|The Arathi aren't friendly at all!}}
:{{text|say|Abducted Lumberjack|The nerubians and Arathi are working together!}}
:{{Text|say|Abducted Lumberjack|The Arathi took me from my home!}}

Freeing them also summons [[Shadowsilk Jailer]]s.

Upon meeting back with Leif who is talking to some [[Freed Lumberjack]]s:
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif| Have you seen Kaerter? I cannot find him.}}

{{Dialogue|
Kaerter... where coulg he be?
