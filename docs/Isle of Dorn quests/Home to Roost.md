==Objectives==
Return to [[Dhar Oztan]].

==Description==
You've already done us a great service here, <name>. We will carry on by the example you have set.

You should return to Dhar Oztan and see to these new [[Stormriders]] you've recruited. They will undoubtedly benefit from the same diligence you have shown here.

And, you can get away from these two and their posturing. I envy you, <name>...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It's good to have you back. Did all go well with the ground forces?

We're just about ready to start flight training here.

==Notes==
On accept if Alliance:
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|You would do well to remember what you've witnessed here, orc.}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Oh, I won't soon forget.}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|Go, champion. Spare yourself.}}

On accept if Horde:
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Do you see the strength of the Horde, Exarch?}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|I see more than you know.}}
:{{text|say|Adelgonn|Go, champion. Spare yourself.}}

Before leaving, all three have new gossip:

{{dialogue|title=Adelgonn|It is good to see that some of you outlanders can work with those you have previously considered enemies. The divisions between the Oathsworn and the Unbound were never so volatile, but we could still learn a lot from your example.}}

Gossip if Alliance:
{{dialogue|title=Overlord Geya'rah|Hmph. The Alliance may be mostly sniveling dogs, but you are different. Go now, in peace, but the Horde will be watching.}}

{{dialogue|title=High Exarch Turalyon|You are a true paragon of the Alliance. These earthen are fortunate to have seen you in action. But your talents are needed elsewhere now, hero. Go with my thanks.}}

Gossip if Horde:
{{dialogue|title=Overlord Geya'rah|I would expect no less than a champion of the Horde. Go now, and crush our enemies. For the Horde!}}

{{dialogue|title=High Exarch Turalyon|Though I cannot abide your methods at times, I cannot argue with results. The Horde has been wise to put its faith in you, and the Alliance takes note.}}

Return to Lufsela:
:{{text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|You're back! And [[Kurdran Wildhammer|Kurdran]] is here with the Wildhammers now, too!}}

More gossip:
{{dialogue|title=[[Thrall]]|I understand that Turalyon represents the Alliance forces at the shore. His prowess and valor are known well to the Horde, though we may sometimes use different words.  I'm sure the earthen ground forces are in good hands with him and Geya'rah.}}

{{dialogue|title=Kurdran Wildhammer|These stormrooks are truly a sight to behold! They're like the sky made manifest. Flight incarnate!

Heavens, I hope [[Sky'reen]] isn't jealous, hearing me go on like this.}}
