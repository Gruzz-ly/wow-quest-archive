A [[The War Within in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "Vereesa's Vision" plays:
:''Vereesa takes the locket and throws it in the waters.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Vereesa Windrunner|Rhonin--}}
:''Suddenly, Vereesa groans in pain as the visions began showing brief flashes of [[Lady Liadrin]], [[Lothraxion]], and [[Turalyon]]. She collapses to her knees.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|Vereesa!}}
:''Vereesa was still seeing visions as glimpses of [[Grand Magister Rommath]] and [[Lor'themar Theron]] and [[Alleria Windrunner]] were shown. Vereesa gasps and she is in the vision.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Vereesa Windrunner|Arator...?!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Vereesa Windrunner|Where are you?}}
:''Glimpses of the sin'dorei getting destroyed by the void monstrosities.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Vereesa Windrunner|No!}}
:''Vereesa cried panickily.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Vereesa Windrunner|The screams...}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Vereesa Windrunner|The horror...}}
:''Vereesa looks up and sees Turalyon, Liadrin, and Lothraxion getting burnt.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Vereesa Windrunner|Stop!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Vereesa Windrunner|It's too much!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Vereesa Windrunner|I cannot bear to see this!}}
:''The vision shifts to [[Magister Umbric]] battling Rommath but Umbric overwhelms Rommath and kills him and laughs maniacally turning into a demon.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Vereesa Windrunner|Stop! Stop!}}
:''The Vision ends with Alleria, Lor'themar, Arator, and the adventurer drowned in the void.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Vereesa Windrunner|NOOOO!!!}}
:''Vereesa fainted mirroring [[Sylvanas Windrunner]] after she collapsed in Oribos.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|[[Thalassian|Shal'na]]! Come back to us.}}
:''Suddenly the Void forces appear and Arator and the adventurer begin to confront them.''

On the other side of the cutscene, Arator brings out his sword as Vereesa is pained by a vision.
:{{Text|Yell|[[Voidbringer Aqu'lir]]|Devout of the Twilight's Blade! Kill the Windrunners!}}

Arator has gossip:
{{dialogue|That must have been Silvermoon in Vereesa's vision. I hope it's wrong.

But if not, we must prepare the city's defenses.}}
