==Objectives==
Use Flashfire Thuribles to reveal [[Order of Night]] forces in [[Rambleshire]], eliminate them, and search them for clues.
* Use a Flashfire Thurible to reveal a Nightshade Abductor
* [[Nightshade Abductor]] slain (6)
* [[Nightshade Letter]]
* [[Flashfire Thurible]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm certain there are still Order folks sneaking around here. Now they might be carrying messages on them, just like the clues you found in [[Freywold]].

You and I are gonna find out.

Here, take these thuribles. They might look like tiny incense burners, but I've enchanted them with [[Sacred Flame]].

Just throw one down and you'll get a big bang with a bright flash! Should be enough to stun anyone sneaking around. 

Just don't throw one at me! Got it?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Alright, I'll admit it, the little Pebble is pretty useful. He knows more about the [[earthen]] and the surface than I ever will. 

Anyway, did you find anything?

==Completion==
"New friends" huh?

Guess I'm not the only one...

<Kaerter freezes when he realizes what he's just said and suddenly points a finger at you.>

You didn't hear me say nothing, got it?

==Notes==
Before starting the quest Leif has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|I am surprised at how genuinely Kaerter cares about the missing earthen. They are not his people but he is willing to make their rescue the top priority.

He mentioned his behavior is driven by some sort of Lamplighter creed.

Curious.

Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|Alright, time to flush out some cultists.}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|What is that? I've never seen that before! How are you doing that?}}
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|You've never seen magic before? This is just my orb of sacred flame and righteous fury that I like to slam in the face of cultists.}}
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|Know what I mean?}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|... I do not. Please explain.}}
:{{text|emote|Lamplighter Kaerter sighs.}}

Friendly NPCs have the {{Abilities|Unnerved|id=457018||icon=ability_druid_cower}} debuff. Use the [[Flashfire Thurible]] to find and kill [[Nightshade Abductor]]s. Nightshade letter is looted on the last one. It reads:
{{Book|Nightshade Letter|content=
... production is moving along steadily, but slowly. The [[Shipwright Isaebela|shipwright]] requires more earthen to operate the mill.

The deal with our new friends is working out well. With the [[Coreway]] inaccessible, our friends are the only way we can transport large amounts of lumber to Hallowfall.

All they ask for in return is for our help to destroy Mereldar...
