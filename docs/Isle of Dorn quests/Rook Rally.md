==Objectives==
Safeguard the summoning ritual.
* Ritual safeguarded (0/100%) {{co|24.9|58.6|Isle of Dorn}}
* Lufsela encouraged

==Description==
Now that we've got the conduit all charged, I suppose it's time we joined everyone on the peak. 

[[Thrall]] talked me through what to expect, but also said summoning the [[stormrook]]s will require me to trust my feelings and instincts.

An [[earthen]] trusting their feelings and instincts. That's... a challenge.

You will help me, right? I'm not a fighter, and it looks dangerous up there.

If anything happens to me, make sure [[Shraubendre]] makes it out safe. Please.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Lightning-Scarred Cowl]]
* [[Lightning-Scarred Vest]]
* [[Lightning-Scarred Coif]]
* [[Lightning-Scarred Legguards]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 15,250 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Well done. It seems the rooks of [[Skywall]] haven't just answered the call.

They were reaching out to us, and they have chosen their own riders for this new generation.

I am honored to have played a role in the ritual.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|Here we go. Stay close.}}
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|I can do this. I can do this. I can do this.}}

Before Lufsela runs off, she has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=[[Lufsela]]|I'm not sure I'm cut out for this.}}

Follow Lufsela up the hill. Up top, Thrall and Olbarig are fighting off [[Rampant Thunder Elemental]]s, [[Rampant Air Elemental]]s, and [[Rampant Lightning Elemental]]s. Help kill them.

Interacting with Lufsela here, she has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=[[Lufsela]]|Can't talk. Need to concentrate!}}

As more elementals are killed, the dialogue progresses:
:{{Text|say|Olbarig|<Name>, help us hold these elementals at bay!}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Reach out through the storm, Lufsela! As we discussed.}}
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|All right! Here goes...}}
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|Stormrooks, hear me! We need your help!}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Good. Open your mind and your heart to them!}}
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|I don't think it's working! They're not listening!}}
:{{Text|say|Olbarig|Hold, Lufsela! You must believe!}}

At 100%:
:{{Text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|It's... it's too much... Shraubendre...}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Go to her, champion! Lend her your strength!}}

{{Dialogue|title=[[Lufsela]]|It's too much! I can't do it!

{{gossip|Offer your strength.}}}}

A [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|PWi-n7zXrTI|Rook Rally}}

''Exterior, [[Dhar Oztan]] peak. [[Rooktender Lufsela]] is still atop the altar, channeling into the Conduit of the Southern Storm.''

{{text|bossemote|Rooktender Lufsela|I can't do this. The titans--}}

''Olbarig lands a blow, defeating another elemental.''

{{text|bossemote|Olbarig|Baelgrim summoned the stormrooks on his own. If he defied the titans, so can you!}}

''Thrall also defeats another elemental before turning to Lufsela.''

{{text|bossemote|Thrall|Lufsela, the stormrooks know your intentions. Focus.}}

''Lufsela closes her eyes.''

{{text|bossemote|Thrall|Call them, and they will answer.}}

''The wings of a stormrook pass by overhead, and the adventurer turns to look up at it, before returning their focus back to Lufsela. As the sound of her channel increases, stormrooks dive onto nearby elementals with a blast of lightning. Attack averted, several earthen who were taking refuge in a nearby cave emerge, and the stormrooks all turn to look at them.''

{{text|bossemote|Thrall|Well done. The stormrooks have heeded your call.}}

{{text|bossemote|Rooktender Lufsela|Not just mine. Theirs.}}

''The stormrooks walk over to the approaching earthen.''

{{text|bossemote|Rooktender Lufsela|They chose to help us of their own free will.}}

''Lufsela hops off of the altar as Shraubendre walks up to her.''

{{text|bossemote|Olbarig|What now, Lufsela?}}

{{text|bossemote|Rooktender Lufsela|We have a lot of work to do.}}

''Everyone starts walking back down the mountain.''

After the cutscene, the player is back at the base of the path of Dhar Otzan. The pilgrims are all looking at the summoned Stormrooks:

*{{text|say|Pilgrim|This is why we were called.}}
*{{text|say|Pilgrim|We must wait our turn to be chosen.}}
*{{text|say|Pilgrim|Will we all get a rook?}}
*{{text|say|Pilgrim|Will more rooks be summoned?}}
*{{text|say|Pilgrim|I cannot wait for one to choose me.}}
*{{text|say|Pilgrim|They are beautiful.}}
*{{text|say|Pilgrim|I hope I am next.}}
*{{text|say|Pilgrim|So we will all become Stormriders?}}

:{{Text|say|Thrall|The rooks have chosen their riders. A true bond has been forged.}}

{{dialogue|title=Olbarig|It has been a long time since a stormrook was summoned here. And for what may be the first time, they were not bound into service. Lufsela has an outlook unlike Baelgrim, or most any other Stormrider. I don't know that there's anyone else who could have done what she's done here.

{{gossip|No new rook for you?}}

I would only have one that would have me. We are no longer binding the rooks into service, so the choice is now up to them.

I suspect the rooks remember my complicity in the mistakes of the past. If my punishment is to never know the skies again, then so be it.}}

{{dialogue|title=Rooktender Lufsela|Isn't it wonderful? The rooks are back!

And these pilgrims, called here to the storm. It's like the rooks reached out to them. It's like they knew we'd be coming and would ask this service of them once again. 

And so they found their perfect matches from among the earthen.

{{gossip|What about the rest of the pilgrims?}}

We have only just begun. I believe each earthen here was called because there is a rook waiting for them on the elemental plane.

We will continue summoning more rooks later.}}

{{dialogue|title=Thrall|It pleases me to walk among the elements once again. To see the stormrooks stand together as brothers and sisters to these earthen. And the bond they share will only grow stronger with time.}}
