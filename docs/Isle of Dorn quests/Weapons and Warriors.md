'''Weapons and Warriors''' is an optional side quest in the [[Freywold Village]] that starts the Seven Soldiers chapter of the [[Isle of Dorn storyline]] required for [[Sojourner of Isle of Dorn]].

==Objectives==
Collect 3 weapon crates and recruit 5 warriors from [[Freywold Village]] and [[Dhar Durgaz]].
* Warriors recruited (5)
* [[Weapons Crate|Weapon crates]] acquired (3)
*Meet [[Aggartha]] on the [[Glimmering Shore]].

==Description==
[[Gorloc]] raiders have been slaughtering these farmers and stealing their pearls. They seek our protection, but we may not be enough.

I know of others nearby who can help. Seek them out and request their aid. If they are hesitant, offer them the promise of pearls as payment.

We will also need to arm these farmers so they can defend themselves. Search for spare weapons and equipment that they might be able to use.

I will go with the farmers and train them as best I can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|14|4|50}}
*5,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good work. I'm glad you were able to recruit some fighters. It is worse than I expected and we will need every one we have.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|[[Pearl Farmer]]|Help us, we beg you!}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|The gorlocs are taking everything from us!}}
:{{text|say|Aggartha|I alone cannot battle an entire [[tribe]] of gorlocs. We need more.}}

Aggartha has gossip:
{{Dialogue|
The earthen who live outside [[Dornogal]] are ill equipped to deal with hostile threats. They are workers, artisans, miners, [[farmer]]s - not soldiers.

{{Gossip|Who are you?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I was once a [[Commander (rank)|commander]] of [[peacekeepers]] in Dornogal. The peacekeepers are not as well versed in warfare as the [[Stormriders]], but we are still trained and armed to protect the citizens of the city.

While the [[Oathsworn]] are well protected behind the walls of Dornogal, the Unbound were left to fend for themselves against [[gorloc]]s, [[fungarian]]s, [[kobold]]s, even [[nerubian]]s.

Over time, I realized that in order to carry out my charge of protecting the earthen, I would have to leave the city. Since then I have journeyed across the Isle of Dorn, helping any and all earthen I come across.

Such is my way.

:{{text|say|Aggartha|Fear not, we will help you.}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|Time preserve us!}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|Thank bedrock!}}
:{{text|say|[[Dorbund]]|You do us a great kindness.}}
:{{text|say|Aggartha|While my friend gathers more weapons and warriors, I will teach you how to fight. Take me to the others.}}

Warriors and weapon crates are all over the village and up on [[Dhar Durgaz]].

[[Kaldrinn]]:
:{{text|say|Kaldrinn|Maybe a gem? She likes shiny objects...}}
{{dialogue|Oh hello! I'm looking for a gift to give to a dear friend of mine. We've spent more and more time together and I've become very fond of her.

Do you think this gem is a good gift?

{{gossip|quest=|<Explain the farmers' situation and their offer of pearls as a reward.>}}
}}
:{{text|say|Kaldrinn|A pearl would be perfect! I'm sure she will love it!}}

[[Garrak]]:
:{{text|say|Garrak|No, not that. What about this? No that doesn't work either!}}
{{dialogue|What do you want? I'm experimenting with various substances that might assist with my work within the [[Ringing Deeps]].

I was hoping to find something on the surface that could help.

{{gossip|quest=|<Explain the farmers' situation and their offer of pearls as a reward.>}}
}}
:{{text|say|Garrak|Pearls? How could that -- actually, yes, yes, that might work! Very well, I shall assist you.}}

Flight master crate:
:{{text|say|[[Iridi (earthen)|Iridi]]|We Unbound aren't fighters. Those weapons have sat there a long time.}}

[[Velkura]]'s crate:
:{{text|say|[[Apprentice Blacksmith]]|Shame what is happening to those farmers. I hope those weapons can help!}}

[[Tower Quartermaster]] (Dhar Durgaz):
:{{text|say|Tower Quartermaster|You're going to teach farmers to fight? Ha, good luck with that!}}

[[Eiggard]] and [[Bertola]]:
:{{text|say|Bertola|Don't you think about the legacy you will leave behind?}}
:{{text|say|Eiggard|Ha, not me! I'm going to live forever!}}

{{dialogue|title=Eiggard|All this doom and gloom about the earthen all shutting down. Not me! I'll find a way to stay operating if it's the last thing I do!

Which I guess it would be if I can't figure something out.

{{gossip|quest=|<Explain the farmers' situation and their offer of pearls as a reward.>}}
}}
:{{text|say|Eiggard|Ha, genius! I'm sure eating pearls will keep me from shutting down!}}

{{dialogue|title=Bertola|Each of us will inevitably shut down one way or another. What matters is what we leave behind afterward.

As for me, I'm compiling a collection of interesting items for whomever comes after me.

{{gossip|quest=|<Explain the farmers' situation and their offer of pearls as a reward.>}}
}}
:{{text|say|Bertola|A rare pearl would be the perfect addition to my collection!}}

[[Merrimack]]:
:{{text|say|Merrimack|What is my purpose?}}
{{dialogue|If all things will end, what is the point of today?

Why should I take any action at all?

{{gossip|quest=|<Explain the farmers' situation and their offer of pearls as a reward.>}}
}}
:{{text|say|Merrimack|A pearl? Why are they valued so? Perhaps I should find out.}}

At the [[Glimmering Shore]], the gathered characters have caught up with [[Aggartha]]. On approach:
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|This is all?}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|Why so few?}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|We needed an army!}}

Aggartha has new gossip:
{{dialogue|Gorlocs are not to be underestimated. I have fought them before but none so organized as this tribe.

We must remain focused.
}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Aggartha|You all have your assignments. Move out!}}
:''The gathered warriors take off.''
