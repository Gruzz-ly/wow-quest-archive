==Objectives==
Distribute smuggled goods around [[Dornogal]].
* Spa Supplies delivered
* Country Supplies delivered
* Care Package delivered
* Speak to [[Trader Harthan|Harthan]]
*Meet Merrix in the Keepers Terrace.

==Description==
You are in a unique position, <name>. A position to learn.

You met those who would bring this "bender of Edicts" to justice, but what of the people of Dornogal? What do the [[earthen]] think of this [[Steelvein]] fellow?

Humor me. Take the smuggled goods you intercepted and bring them to their intended recipients. Tell them the items are a gift from a "mutual friend."

You might be surprised to learn who benefits from these... illicit deeds.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Harthan mentioned [[Overseer Ardgrin|Ardgrin]], you say?

He is a trade overseer from the [[Ringing Deeps]]. If he quarreled with Steelvein, that certainly concerns me.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Merrix| Once you have delivered this contraband, meet me just outside of the Foundation Hall. I could use a bit of a stroll.}}

Merrix has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|If you are worried that this is a ploy, do not be.

I only wish to share some interesting insights with you. Nothing more.
}}

Go to the [[Steam Vent]] and talk to [[Aufta]]:
{{Dialogue|If you are here for leisure, you will need to book an appointment with the bath matron.

But you may need to wait. We are awfully busy right now and in short supply of, well, everything.

{{Gossip|quest=|I have a shipment from a mutual friend for you.}} 
}}
:{{text|say|Aufta|My underclay! There is no better healing salve, but it's hard to come by. This will further my healing directive!}}

{{Dialogue|What would we do without Steelvein?

He always manages to get what we need.

He bends the Edicts so we don't have to.
}}

Next go to [[Gostrof]] in the [[Forgegrounds]]:
{{Dialogue|Titans preserve you, outlander.

If you need supplies taken out of Dornogal or into it, then I'm your quarry!

My directive is delivering supplies and trade goods. No matter the recipient.

{{Gossip|quest=|I've brought a gift from a mutual friend.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Gostrof|Nerubian silk rope! Makes hauling ore easy. Very illegal, but Steelvein always provides.}}

{{Dialogue|<Gostrof smiles.>

Steelvein never forgets anyone. Not even the Unbound outside the city.

I'll make sure the right people get this, don't you worry.
}}

Next is [[Trader Harthan]], also in the Forgegrounds:
{{Dialogue|You again? Listen, I do not want any trouble.

Whatever happened with the peacekeepers yesterday was not what it seemed.

{{Gossip|quest=|I've brought a gift from a mutual friend.}} 

{{Dialogue-child|Well, crack my chassis and call me a Keeper. I knew Steelvein had connections around the city, but not like this!

I'm glad someone around here can get around the Edicts to get what we need... Not that I have anything against the Edicts. It's just... Well, never you mind.

Say, while you're here, can you pass along a message to our "mutual friend" for me?

{{Gossip|quest=|I'm listening.}}}}
}}
:{{text|say|Trader Harthan|Steelvein is not on greased gears with Ardgrin's crew--the ones who run his shipments from the Deeps. Give him the message, will you?}}

{{Dialogue|Steelvein takes care of those who help him. My crew worked hard to earn his trust.}}

Upon returning to Merrix:
{{Dialogue-child|As Councilward, it is my duty to know everything that happens in my city.

Disputes among earthen are not uncommon, but rarely do they topple as many stones as this incident has.
}}
