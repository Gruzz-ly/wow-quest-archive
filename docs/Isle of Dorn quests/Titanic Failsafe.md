'''Titanic Failsafe''' concludes the second chapter of the max-level [[The War Within (achievement)]] campaign. The storyline continues immediately with [[Gathering Intel]].

==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Colossal Titan Construct.jpg|Colossal Titan Construct|This ancient titan machine of war has risen from the depths of the ocean to eradicate the disobedient earthen of Dorn.}}
Defeat the colossal titan construct.
* [[Shraubendre]] mounted
* [[Colossal Titan Construct]] slain {{co|59.1|74.5|Isle of Dorn}}

==Description==
So the [[titan]]s send their ancient machines against [[Earthen|their disobedient children]].

Would our creators have us protect the [[Coreway]] at the expense of all else? At the expense of [[Azeroth]] herself? Are we meant to preside over a road untraveled, leading to the world's dead heart?

No, today we are all [[Unbound]], and we will fight for our freedom. For Azeroth!

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of:
* [[Stormrider's Cuffs]]
* [[Stormrider's Bindings]]
* [[Stormrider's Bracers]]
* [[Stormrider's Armplates]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 15,250 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Valorstones]]
* +500 reputation with [[Council of Dornogal]] or 25x [[Resonance Crystals]]

==Progress==
None on this isle will be safe until that titan construct is dealt with. Go!

==Completion==
It was a trial by fire, but you've proven that the [[earthen]] of The Isle of [[Dorn]] are ready for the war to come. Where once there was discord, there is now unity of purpose. They are no longer [[Oathsworn]] or Unbound. They are united, just as we should be, against this darkness.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I will go ahead and see if I can slow it down.}}
:{{text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|<Name>, take Shraubendre! She trusts you. And I trust you to keep the Stormriders safe from the titans' machines.}}
:''Jaina teleports away as Lufsela walks over to Shaubendre.''

Merrix has new gossip:
{{dialogue|Titans... So this is what we are to them.}}

Hop on Shaubendre once more and the three earthen stormriders mount up and take off as well. 
{{dialogue|<Shraubendre looks ready to launch herself into the air.>

{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Skyriding)}} Follow my lead, Shraubendre.}}<br>
{{gossip|I'm just along for the ride, Shraubendre.}}}}

On the flight south:
:{{text|say|Stormrider Kothilde|Anyone else concerned we're out of our depth here?}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Gurnot|Remember your training, Kothilde.}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Kothilde|That won't be hard considering how recent it was!}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Gurnot|Look at the size of that thing...}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Adalar|Aren't you supposed to be the stalwart one? Now I'm nervous.}}

Jaina has rooted the Colossal Titan Construct just east of [[Golgrin's Reach]] on the shoreline. The construct has two abilities:
* {{abilities|Titantic Plasma Bolt|notes=Randomly fired shots, hits for ~500k health.}}
* {{abilities|Scorching Beam|A concentrated emission of coherent energy hotter than the sun.|notes=Winds up a cast on the adventurer that ticks 5 times for ~150k health.}}

As before, Shaubendre has three abilities that fire off when normal skyriding abilities are used:
# {{abilities|Surge Forward|Flap forward. Surge Forward evades Scalechillers, Scalechargers, and other obstacles encountered in time trials and races.|cd=1.5 sec|notes=Instant. Also applies a 2-second Lightning Sheath that absorbs damage.}}
#* {{abilities|Lightning Sheath|The stormrook protects itself and its rider from all damage for 2 sec.}}
# {{abilities|Skyward Ascent|Flap upward.|cd=1.5 sec|notes=Instant. Also fires bolts of lightning forward that hit the construct for ~740k HP each.}}
# {{abilities|Whirling Surge|Spiral forward a great distance, increasing speed. Whirling Surge evades Wingshredders and dismounts airborne enemy players.|cd=30 sec|notes=Also fully-heals the player.}}

Surge Forward while the bomb debuff is ticking down over the adventurer's head to bubble off the (otherwise unavoidable) beam attack ticks. Spam Skyward Ascent on approach to the construct to damage it, and use Whirling Surge to heal. Plenty of vigor orbs are in the area to help speed vigor recharge.

:{{text|bossemote|USE WHIRLING SURGE TO HEAL}}
:{{text|bossemote|SURGE FORWARD TO SHIELD}}

At 50%:
:{{text|say|Olbarig|Room in these skies for one more?}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Kothilde|Olbarig is back! And he has a rook!}}
:{{text|say|Olbarig|Zarein and I are ready to finish what Baelgrim started.}}

Finish it off:
:{{text|say|Stormrider Kothilde|Task complete! We did it!}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Adalar|And in style too.}}
:{{text|say|Stormrider Gurnot|We have made the isle safe!}}
:{{text|say|Olbarig|Good work, Stormriders. Take a victory lap and let our people know their shores are safe again.}}

Fly back to the Coreway in Dornogal to turn in to Alleria. In the area, several characters have gossip:

{{dialogue|title=Rooktender Lufsela|I don't know what to say, except to thank you, outlander. I would have never imagined myself doing of any of this. But you gave me the strength to discover what I am truly capable of. What we all are capable of.

The stormrooks may be here because of me, but I am only here because of you. So, thank you.}}

{{dialogue|title=Olbarig|It's been a long time since I've been back to Dornogal. I think I prefer my island, truth be told. But as much as I'd like to go home, I abandoned the Stormriders once before, and I don't intend to do so again.}}

{{dialogue|title=Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Excellent work, champion. And thank you for watching over Thrall. I think this experience has helped him. In his heart, I believe he has always been a teacher. With Lufsela, he's found a capable pupil.}}

{{dialogue|title=Thrall|I am grateful to have served the Stormriders and helped mentor Lufsela. It has been good to hear the song of the elements in the wingbeats of the rooks and the crash of their lightning.

There is still much to be done to prepare for the battles ahead, but I believe the Stormriders have proven they are ready.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|It seems the Stormriders have proven themselves once more. As have you, <name>.}}

After completing the quest, Merrix walks over to Lufsela, Olbarig, Moira, Jaina, and Thrall:

{{dialogue|title=Merrix|There is but one matter left to be resolved. The Stormriders are not complete without a Stormward to lead them.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|I see Zarein has returned. Does he bring our new Stormward with him?}}
:{{text|say|Olbarig|No, our new Stormward has been right here all along.}}
:{{text|say|Olbarig|Lufsela has done what Baelgrim and I failed to do for thousands of years.}}
:{{text|say|Olbarig|She's brought the stormrooks to wing as equal partners, with compassion and understanding.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|Quite so. But will she accept the burden of becoming Stormward Lufsela?}}
:{{text|say|Rooktender Lufsela|If it means keeping the stormrooks and their riders safe, then yes. Without hesitation.}}

Merrix has new gossip after the script event:
{{dialogue|Stormward Baelgrim will be missed. But now that Adelgonn has returned, Lufsela is now Stormward, and Brinthe has become High Speaker, the Council is again whole. 

I think Baelgrim would have been pleased.}}

==Progression==
{{Ties That Bind}}

==Alpha version==

;Completion
Where once there was discord, there is now unity of purpose. No longer Oathsworn or Unbound, just as we can no longer be Horde or Alliance. We are all in this together as one.
