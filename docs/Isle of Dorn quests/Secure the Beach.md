{{questportrait|Queensguard Zirix.jpg|Queensguard Zirix|If Zirix's onslaught is not stopped, the survivors of [[Dalaran]] will be wiped out.}}

==Objectives==
Find Magni and defeat Queensguard Zirix.
*Regroup with [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]]
*Hold off [[Queensguard Zirix]]
*Stand against Zirix's swarm

==Description==
Queensguard Zirix emerged from the ground and surprised Magni.

He's near the farthest edge of the wreckage fighting off his swarm.

[[Moira]] and I were trying to help, but we couldn't draw them away.

Come with me. Magni needs our help!

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
:{{abilities|Skyriding|Unlocks access to Skyriding in Khaz Algar.|id=459188|icon=ability_dragonriding_upwardflap01}}

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]
*[[Remembrance of the Fallen City]]

==Completion==
You may not be trespassers, but you are not our allies either, outlander.

If you are to blame for the [[nerubian]]s emerging, then you are responsible for the attack on [[Dornogal]] as well.

:''Anduin, Jaina, and Thrall run into the battlefield and attack [[Zirixi Swarmclaw]]s.''
:{{Text|say|Thrall|We'll hold the line! <Name>! Help Magni!}}

Let Magni tank and attack Queensguard Zirix:

:{{Text|say|Queensguard Zirix|Swarms of Azj-Kahet, rise and devour them!}}

Get Zirix to 85% and a [[The War Within in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] plays, The [[Stormriders]] arrive, [[Baelgrim]] with [[Oathsworn Stormrider]]s:
{{#ev:youtube|qWhR2zTYTL8|The Stormriders Arrive}}

''Zirix takes a big swing at Magni, knocking the dwarf back. He lands next to the adventurer. Anduin, Jaina, and Thrall are still guarding the rear.''

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|We cannae hold 'em!}}

''Dagran and Moira look on as Zirix walks to close the gap with Magni. The shadows of mounted [[stormrook]]s cross the ground.''

{{text|bossemote|Queensguard Zirix|Stormriders!}}

''The mounted earthen launch storm bolts, instantly killing the nerubians in the path of the beams. Baelgrim winds up an attack with his stormhammer and prepares to launch it at Zirix. As Baelgrim lets loose, Zirix calls a hasty retreat.''

{{text|bossemote|Queensguard Zirix|To ground, my soldiers!}}

''Zirix submerges before the stormhammer connects.''

''Four stormrooks land as the collected heroes (and the adventurer) look at Baelgrim's stormhammer. He lands on the other side of his hammer, facing them.''

{{text|bossemote|Baelgrim|Trespassers. My directive is to protect the Isle of Dorn. Leave at once.}}

{{text|bossemote|Moira Thaurissan|Trespassers? You saw us fall from the sky an' fight for our lives! We need aid!}}

''The camera pans across the battlefield as the surviving fighters are all trying to catch their breaths.''

{{text|bossemote|Baelgrim|What you need matters not. Your presence is not authorized by the titans.}}

''Baelgrim, stormhammer in hand, continues to follow his programming.''

{{text|bossemote|Dagran Thaurissan II|The titans?}}

''Incensed, Magni takes a few steps forward.''

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|Now don't ye be talkin' to me daughter like that, ye great stone--}}

{{text|bossemote|Baelgrim|An earthen hardened like a diamond--a [[thraegar]]!}}

''Baelgrim puts his stormhammer away and drops to one knee.''

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|You've... seen others akin to me?}}

{{text|bossemote|Baelgrim|I have only heard stories of their heroics... It is a sign from the titans!}}

''Baelgrim walks up to get a closer look at Magni.''

{{text|bossemote|Magni|Laddie, it weren't titan magic tha--}}

{{text|bossemote|Moira Thaurissan|Er, what he means to say is... Yes, of course! And we'd be honored to...}}

''The sound of a large explosion from offscreen startles everybody. Unnamed members of the Sunreavers and Silver Covenant run in the direction to see a great deal of smoke off in the distance from [[Dornogal]].''

{{text|bossemote|Baelgrim|Dornogal! What disaster have you brought to our city, outlanders?}}

''Baelgrim runs to his stormrook, mounts it, and prepares to take off, walking through Magni and Anduin, who dodge out of the way.''

{{text|bossemote|Baelgrim|New directive: we must return to the city. All of us.}}

[[File:Secure the Beach - after.jpg|thumb|After combat]]
After the cutscene, the phase has changed and [[Tranquil Strand]] is no longer under active attack.

Completing the quest, players lose the Dangerous Skies debuff and can [[skyride]] freely. But first, everyone has new dialogue.

{{dialogue|title=[[Magni Bronzebeard]]|I dunnae need help, <name>.

<Magni winces in pain. He is clearly winded and injured.>

Maybe... just a wee leg up on tae a gryphon or whatever these birds be...}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Moira Thaurissan]]|O' course we get stranded here an' the first thing me da' goes an' does is get himself injured.

Always got tae play the hero.

I hope Dagran does nae get any ideas.

But who am I kiddin'? Whisked away tae a far off place an' stranded? Meetin' a tall, [[dark dwarf]] when I get there?

I can talk me way out o' this.

Bring it on, [[Khaz Algar]].}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Dagran Thaurissan II]]|I've got all me books an' scrolls but...

Look at all we've lost. All the knowledge stored in Dalaran. All o' the people...

I hope these [[earthen]] find more survivors.

An' I hope that granda' bein' a "thraegar" can help us be friends with them.

Maybe they'll have a library too. Wouldn't that be grand?}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]]|I am glad that the earthen found us when they did.

But I fear that we may need more than their help if we wish to mount an offensive against the nerubians and [[Xal'atath]].}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Thrall]]|Xal'atath must be stopped.

Let us hope that these earthen do not hinder us.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Anduin Wrynn]]|Death... and destruction. Everywhere.

At every turn, I lose more friends. More family.

[[Khadgar]]. [[Alleria]]...

Will it end with Xal'atath? When will it end?}}
