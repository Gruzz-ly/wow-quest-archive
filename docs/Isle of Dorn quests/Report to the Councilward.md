==Objectives==
Take [[Steelvein]]'s receipts to [[Merrix]] at the Councilward's Rise in [[Dornogal]].
* Find Merrix at the [[Councilward's Rise]]
* Merrix's desk approached

==Description==
Those receipts you found... Steelvein is a known smuggler that we've been chasing for a long time. The [[Councilward]] will be pleased to finally have solid evidence on his activities, and maybe even on his whereabouts.

Bring these receipts to Merrix immediately. He will want to study them in detail. He said he was heading back to his office, so you should be able to find him at the Councilward's Rise.

I'll package up the rest of the evidence to be brought to him later. Good work today.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+500 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) (first time) or 180x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Completion==
<Seems like there is nothing else to do but leave the receipts on Merrix's desk.>

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Kragad|Due to suspected ties with the smuggler Steelvein, this depot is hereby closed indefinitely.}}
:{{text|say|Trader Harthan|You cannot do this! My directive...}}

When arriving at the [[Councilward's Rise]]:
:{{text|say|Oathsworn Councilguard|The Councilward has stepped away. If your directive is to make a delivery, leave it on his desk.}}

Interacting with the open ledger in Merrix's desk:
{{Dialogue|<The office is indeed unoccupied.

A pile of letters is scattered haphazardly over what you assume is Merrix's desk. It appears that he left in a hurry.

The topmost letter is open and unfolded.>


There has been a situation.<br>
Expect delays.
