'''The Fleet Arrives''' begins the max-level storyline of [[The War Within (achievement)]]. This quest becomes available after completing the leveling campaign and reaching Renown level 4 with the [[Council of Dornogal]], [[Assembly of the Deeps]], [[Hallowfall Arathi]], and [[Severed Threads]].

Level 80 [[alt]]s of players who've previously completed the leveling campaign can pick up [[A Time to Come Together]], which skips the leveling campaign and leads directly into The Fleet Arrives.

==Objectives==
Scout the harbor for ships arriving from the [[Horde]] and [[Alliance]] fleet.
*[[Telescope (Dornogal)|Telescope]] used {{co|35.1|80.3|Dornogal}}
*Report back to [[Moira Thaurissan|Moira]]

==Description==
From the moment we crashed on this isle, it were clear as crystal we'd be needin' allies if we hoped to face [[Xal'atath]].

[[Jaina]] and [[Thrall]] took off tae muster reinforcements, an' you and I set tae work seein' what could be done here with the [[earthen]].

An' I have to say we've done well on our own, haven't we?

<Moira smiles at you proudly.>

But it looks like our reinforcements may have finally arrived. [[Peacekeepers]] spied ships comin' this way. Go take a look an' confirm the good news!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 5,800 [[XP]]
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
I'm glad to see you are well, <name>.

The journey took longer than anticipated. The capricious sea had its own plans it seems.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Stormrider scouts spotted our ships in the distance. They should arrive soon!}}

The telescope to the west lights up. Interact with it to start an [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays of Alliance and Horde warships arriving to the Isle of Dorn:

{{#ev:youtube|tHxeZuIFGCI|The Fleet Arrives}}

''Exterior, Dornogal. The adventurer is looking through the scope facing west into the bay. From behind the mountain, ships from the Kul Tirian and Horde fleets are sailing into view. The adventurer pulls back from the scope.''

''On one of the Kul Tiran vessels, [[Aysa Cloudsinger]], [[Danath Trollbane]], and [[Turalyon]] are on deck. Below deck, [[Jaina Proudmoore]] and [[Kurdran Wildhammer]] are walking to the stairs to head up topside.''

''On a Horde vessel, [[Overlord Geya'rah]] walks up to [[Thrall]], who is sitting in a throne, and she gives him an unvoiced message. He nods in response. Topside, [[Lady Liadrin]] and [[Gorgonna]] are speaking with a grunt.''

After the cutscene, report to Moira:
{{Dialogue|{{gossip|Alliance and Horde arrived.}}}}
:{{Text|say|Moira Thaurissan|And here they come now.}}
:''Of the Horde, [[Thrall]], [[Overlord Geya'rah]], [[Lady Liadrin]], and [[Gorgonna]], along with two [[Horde Grunt (Dornogal)|Horde Grunts]], teleport to the overhang next to the other characters. Of the Alliance, [[Danath Trollbane]], [[Jaina Proudmoore]], [[Kurdran Wildhammer]], [[Turalyon]], one [[Stromgarde Footman (Dornogal)|Stromgarde Footman]], and one [[Wildhammer Skyfighter]] teleport along with them.''
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Lok'tar, everyone.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|...and apologies for the delay.}}

Turalyon has gossip:
{{dialogue|It took time for us to assemble the fleets. The armistice between the Alliance and the Horde is more fragile than most realize.

As for me... I must speak to Alleria, but there is much to be done. Our duties come first.

<Turalyon presses his lips into a thin line.>

And so, once again, the words we want to share will have to wait.}}

;Description
From the moment we crashed on these lands, it were clear as crystal we'd be needin' allies. [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]] and Thrall took off to muster reinforcements, showin' their faith in us to stand against the invaders.

The Stormrider patrol's spied a fleet sailing towards [[Dornogal Bay]]. Go ahead and bring me the good news.
