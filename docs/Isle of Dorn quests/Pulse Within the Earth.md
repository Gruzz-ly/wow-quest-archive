==Objectives==
Place 4 Tremor Stones around the pond.
*[[Tremor Stone]] Placed (4)
*Talk to [[Harmot]]

==Description==
Before we go and wake up a slumbering [[mountain giant]], it's probably best we get an idea for how deeply asleep he is. 

Though, if the nerubians burrowing up didn't wake him up, I'm not sure what will.

Take these earth shards and plant them on the waterfalls and hills around the lake. 

Once we've got them set up, I'll be able to get a reading on the giant's health.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Once you've got the shards set up, I can drop the final one here to get a proper read.

==Completion==
The mountain giant's got a weak heartbeat.

Poor lad's likely been disturbed from a deep slumber with all of these elementals breaking off from the falls.

Fortunately, the pair of us are experts in healing elemental and elemental-adjacent's life forms, aren't we?

If the salve can work on earthen and rock rams, it can work on mountain giants!

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Harmot|Meet us on the bank of the pond down the hill, <name>! Just across that bridge.}}
:{{text|say|Harvester Farnee|Wait, we're not getting closer to that thing, are we?}}
:{{text|say|Harmot|And miss out on learning about mountain giants? Not a chance, Farnee!}}

Go to the nearby waterfall and place the Tremor Stones. Placing a stone summons a [[Seismic Rumbler]], also be careful of the nearby [[Living Water Fall]]s.

Next go talk to Harmot:
{{Dialogue|Once you place the tremor stones, I'll be able to read the signals they send through the earth. They should allow me to get a feel for what condition that fella is in before we go waking it up.

And by we, I of course mean you!

{{Gossip|quest=|I have placed the tremor stones.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Harmot|Oh... oh no. Can you both feel it? The giant's pulse... the poor's lad wounded, I think.}}
:{{text|say|Harvester Farnee|Wounded? Well, that calms my bees! Let's just hope it passes quickly and quietly, right?}}
:{{text|say|Harmot|Passes quickly? We haven't seen mountain giants in eons and you want the first one we find to pass quickly?}}

==Progression==
