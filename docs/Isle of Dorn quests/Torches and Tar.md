==Objectives==
Retrieve 10 Stolen Torches from [[Defias Brotherhood|Defias bandits]] and 10 Barrels of Tar from [[Newstead|Newstead Farm]].
*[[Barrel of Tar]] retrieved (10)
*[[Stolen Torches]] retrieved (10)

==Description==
We've been attacked before. But this time...

<Walker shudders.>

This was different.

They didn't want livestock, grain, or money. They took torches and some barrels of tar we use to fix our roofs.

I don't know what they're going to do with it, but... I can guess. They're going to burn something down.

You need to stop them before they do another homestead harm!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
I hope whatever they're planning doesn't involve my neighbors. Or [[Stromgarde]]!

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

Hopefully this "snuffs out" what they were planning.

==Notes==

Accept this quest and [[Finding Family]]. On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Walker Gresham|Why now? Why us? What do they want?}}

All over [[Newstead]], slay the [[Defias Brotherhood|Defias]] bandits, lookouts, and ringleaders. They drop [[Stolen Torches]], and [[Barrel of Tar|Barrels of Tar]] are all over the farm. The first Defias slain also drops the [[Unfamiliar Emblem]], starting [[Emblematic of Things to Come]].

On return:
:{{Text|Say|Maggie Wiltshire|Daddy! Mummy!}}
:{{Text|Say|Sharon Wiltshire|Oh! Maggie! You're all right.}}
:{{Text|Say|Marshall Wiltshire|My lord, who are the Red Dawn?}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Danath Trollbane]]|I... do not know.}}
