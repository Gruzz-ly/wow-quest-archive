'''Attention-Getter''' becomes available after reaching Renown 10 with [[Council of Dornogal]].

==Objectives==
Receive tips from [[Elma]] in the [[Proscenium]].

==Description==
My, <name>, it seems you have drawn the attention of a particular audience member.

This fan letter was mistakenly included in my fan mail. I'm not surprised. Sorting my copious fan mail must be a difficult chore...

Here, take it. It belongs to you, of course.

I'm sure this is very new for you. I have a few pieces of wisdom for greeting eager fans, if you would like to hear it...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We must be careful with fans. We must be gentle with their feelings but also discourage unwanted behaviors.

Kind and gracious acknowledgement of their gratitude is key. A simple thank you note in return is optimal. And if you see them here, it is acceptable to nod and wave. We want our audience to be happy, of course.

And, in the event they bring flowers... I can graciously take that burden from you.

==Notes==
This quest is a criterion of [[A Star of Dorn]].
