'''A Helping Hand''' begins the second half of the [[Fate of the Kirin Tor]] storyline.

==Objectives==
[[File:Unstable Portal.jpg|thumb|Unstable Portal]]
Help mages exit their portals on the [[Isle of Dorn]].
*[[Mage]]s extracted from portals (3)

==Description==
[[Kalecgos]]'s hypothesis that [[Dalaran]]'s debris interferes with long-range [[teleportation]] seems correct.

Mage portals have appeared along the shore, but no one has stepped through them. There are likely mages trapped within the portals.

Or, something mana hungry--like [[felhunter]]s--may be being lured here by the release of Dalaran's power.

We must investigate. Mages of the [[Kirin Tor]] may be in danger. The felhunters are an acceptable risk.

Let us not waste anymore time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
*10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
I'm glad to see the scattered mages of the Kirin Tor answering [[Aethas]]'s call.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|Have you spoken to Aethas at the outpost?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Not yet. I thought I was ready to see Dalaran's ruins again, but I arrived and just... froze.}}
:{{Text|Say|Kalecgos|That's... understandable. Come, we'll go together.}}
:''The two walk away to the south''

Interact with the blue unstable portals and pull at least three yards away to yank out a mage. Interact with the purple unstable portal to pull out a [[Mana-Craving Felhunter]]. 

[[Lyrandor Nightveil]], [[Apprentice Mijala Firehex]], and [[Turi Flickerflame]] each have something to say once they're pulled out:
:{{Text|Say|Lyrandor Nightveil|Thank you, <race>. I do not know what would have happened when I ran out of mana.}}
:{{Text|Say|Apprentice Mijala Firehex|I never had a portal trap me that way. You saved my life, my friend.}}
:{{Text|Say|Turi Flickerflame|Thanks! I saw the letter. I'm here to help!}}

Meet up with Kalecgos, Jaina Proudmoore and [[Aethas Sunreaver]] in the outpost.
:{{Text|Say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Grief heals slowly, Aethas. Be patient, and more will answer your missives in time.}}

The mages appearing the the outpost are [[Steria Duskgrove]], [[Callisto Windsor]], and [[Meryl Felstorm]], as well as Turi, Mijala, and Lyrandor.

{{Dialogue|title=Steria Duskgrove|Out of all this tragedy, I am glad to see Callisto is safe!

But I can't help but think of all the people--and animals--that are not.

We must all work together to rebuild and help others who have survived!}}
{{Dialogue|title=Callisto Windsor|To think that if I hadn't requested another field assignment because it would look good on my transcript I may not be here right now.

I wonder if my transcript even exists now. Did someone think to grab the Kirin Tor scholastic archives before they left? Oh no...

Wait, what a silly thing to worry about. 

I'm safe, Steria is safe, and there are people here to help. For Dalaran!}}

{{Dialogue|title=Turi Flickerflame|Uh... Hello, there. Watch your head, okay? Arcane-infused matter is far denser than it appears. Getting clipped by the energies whizzing around here would be an unpleasant experience.

{{gossip|Why did you answer Aethas's call?}}

Why? Honestly, I'm not entirely sure myself. 

When I got the message, I don't know... All I could think about was Theramore--and how alone I felt in the days and months that followed.

After that, my legs just sort of started moving on their own. The next thing I knew, I was here.

I'm just a washed-up apprentice. I'm definitely no archmage or hero or whatever. 

But I had to do something. Nobody should ever have to feel this kind of hurt alone.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Lyrandor Nightveil|I am humbled to work on an errand of such great importance alongside Kalecgos... even if it is one of his mirror images.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Apprentice Mijala Firehex|I'm just an apprentice.

What can I do ta help?

Aethas, he say anythin' an' everythin' help. Even de small things.

I hope so. 'Cause small be all I got!}}

{{Dialogue|title=Meryl Felstorm|I have seen ages of tragedies.

It does not make it any easier, even for me.

But I am here to help where I can.}}
