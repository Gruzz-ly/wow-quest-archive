==Objectives==
Regroup with Arator in [[Tazavesh, the Veiled Market]], on [[K'aresh]].
*Speak with Arator (Optional)
*Take the Portal to K'aresh (Optional)
*Regroup with Arator in Tazavesh on K'aresh

==Description==
It's imperative we seek [[Alleria|my mother]]'s counsel. But before we can do that, we'll have to find her.

Last I heard, she was out hunting in the Great Dark Beyond on a world known as K'aresh.

Lucky for us, I thought ahead and asked [[Khadgar]] for a portal scroll to go directly there. I'll meet you on the other side.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}

==Completion==
Thank you for coming with me, <name>. I know I have much to learn. I'm just trying to live up to the family name.

Now all we have to do is find my mother on this shattered world.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Despite her hesitance to discuss it, my mother is Azeroth's foremost expert with the Void.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|She has yet to return from K'aresh. So we will have to seek her out.}}

Speak with Arator:
{{dialogue|That must have been Silvermoon in Vereesa's vision. I hope it's wrong.

But if not, we must prepare the city's defenses.

:{{Text|Say|[[Vereesa Windrunner]]|My visions are still difficult to parse. But it's clear that they are a warning: Xal'atath intends to lay siege to Azeroth.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|We must tell my mother. No one has more experience fighting Xal'atath than she does.}}
:{{Text|Say|Vereesa Windrunner|That is precisely why she will not return. Alleria prefers to chase her quarry to the ends of existence.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|And if Silvermoon comes under attack?}}
:{{Text|Say|Vereesa Windrunner|Then she would have even more reason to stay away. Her link to the Void makes her a danger to the Sunwell.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Then... what about [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]]?}}
:{{Text|Say|Vereesa Windrunner|Though few agree with me, I believe Sylvanas would do everything in her power to defend our home.}}
:{{Text|Say|Vereesa Windrunner|But she has been [[Penance and Renewal|condemned]] to the [[Maw]] until her penance is complete.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I can't just stand idle and wait for Xal'atath to strike. I have to at least speak with my mother.}}
:{{Text|Say|Vereesa Windrunner|I know, Arator. I will wait for you in [[Dornogal]]. We can journey to Silvermoon after you find Alleria.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Thank you, Aunt Vereesa. I'll return as soon as I can.}}
:{{Text|Say|Vereesa Windrunner|That may be sooner than you like. But... I do hope you succeed.}}

Take the portal to Tazavesh:
:{{Text|Say|Arator|This place, this world... The Void seems to permeate everything.}}
