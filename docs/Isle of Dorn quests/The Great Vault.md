==Objectives==
Obtain a piece of loot from the [[Great Vault]].
*[[Pristine Council's Seal]]

==Description==
Many of [[Dornogal]]'s systems have been dormant for millennia and are now back online. One that you might find useful, <race>, is the Great Vault.

Once, this cache of armor and weapons would have supported the [[earthen]] in their [[Oathsworn]] duty to protect Dornogal. Now it is extended to you with the expectation that you use what you find there to aid others along your quest.

The Vault is housed here in Dornogal within the [[Council's Treasury]]. The Councilward has granted you full access to its contents.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The vault is yours to peruse, <name>.

==Completion==
So you've found some beneficial equipment within the vault, have you?

Good. There are many more pieces stored within. Take a look regularly. You never know what you might find.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.0.2|note=Added.}}
