==Objectives==
Meet with various [[earthen]] citizens in [[Dornogal]].
* Ask a guard about profession trainers
* Speak to Flight Master [[Breem]]
* Speak to Innkeeper [[Ronesh]]
* Speak to [[Brann Bronzebeard]]
* Speak to [[Auditor Balwurz]]
*Return to Merrix in Foundation Hall in Dornogal.
*[[Councilward's Signet]] (provided)

==Description==
I am [[Merrix]], Councilward of Dornogal.

I appreciate your aid--especially in light of the fraught nature of your arrival. You must forgive Stormward [[Baelgrim]]. Being suspicious is part of his directive.

A formal discussion of our situation is warranted. If you wish to strike back at the [[nerubian]]s, as we do, meet us at the [[Foundation Hall]]. Baelgrim and I need to review the data so far.

In the meantime, you are my guest. Take my ring. It will allow you to access Dornogal's amenities.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The attack seems concentrated on the Coreway. The rest of the city is secure, but we should ready ourselves for anything.

==Completion==
Baelgrim's vigilance has kept us safe all these years, but today we need help.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Merrix|Welcome to Dornogal. You are the first outlander to visit in years!}}
:''Merrix and Baelgrim walk outside, then mount up and fly across the [[Coreway]] in the direction of the [[Forgegrounds]].''

This quest serves as the tour of [[Dornogal]]. Northwest of the Forgegrounds on the rise, [[Breem]], the flight master, is speaking with [[Stormrider Meirand]].
:{{text|say|Breem|--the entire isle is under attack. Praise the titans you are safe, Meirand.}}

Breem has gossip:
{{dialogue|I have heard of nerubian attacks all over the island from [[Golgrin's Reach]] to [[Unbound]] territory.

What does it all mean?

{{gossip|quest=|<Introduce yourself with Councilward's Signet.>}}
}}
:{{text|say|Breem|Were it not for the Stormriders, the city may have fallen. We need the Council's direction.}}

Meirand has gossip too:
{{dialogue|I have served Stormward Baelgrim for many cycles, but this is our first under attack.

Speaker Brinthe even says that she has no written record of an attack, but of course our only records are from after we lost access to the Archive.

But we Stormriders have prepared for this very moment, every moment, of our time online. We will not lose any more ground to the nerubians.}}

[[File:Stones of Dornogal - inn.jpg|thumb|[[Ronesh]], [[Anduin Wrynn]], and [[Magni Bronzebeard]] in Stonelight Rest]]
Immediately north is [[Stonelight Rest]], and [[Ronesh]], the innkeeper, is inside. Speak with him:

{{dialogue|Another outlander from the the beach, are you? A few of your sector, Anduin and Magni, arrived earlier. They are downstairs.

News of your aid to us has traveled through the city. I welcome you and your allies, and will help you as best I can.

Although... if you share the same food requirements as your compatriots, your choices are limited. What we consume is upalatable{{Sic}} to you--gems, ore, and [[cinderbrew]].

This inn was created because we did have [[Arathi|travelers]] like you once come from [[Hallowfall|below]].

But, I can see what I have.

{{gossip|quest=|<Introduce yourself with Councilward's Signet.>}}
}}
:{{text|say|Ronesh|Beds are scarce. We have resorted to using the [[Proscenium]] as a field hospital.}}

Inside, [[Anduin Wrynn]] and [[Magni Bronzebeard]] are at a table with some food on it:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|So many injured...}}

[[File:Stones of Dornogal - Magni and Anduin.jpg|thumb|Magni and Anduin]]

Anduin has gossip:
{{dialogue|We're lucky to find respite here.

From what the earthen have said, the nerubians have been their enemy for millennia--but haven't come to the Isle of Dorn as far back as any of them can remember.

The nerubians have caught all of us unprepared.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Magni, how are you feeling?}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|How I look, to be honest. The shine has worn off of me. And of this speaker nonsense.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Nonsense? I thought... Being the speaker was...}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|An honor? Aye, until it wasn't. [[Radiant Song|A song everywhere]] and nary a peep for me...}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|And now, dragged to the ends of the earth... and my family too!}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I... can't offer you any comfort. I admit that I...}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|You're in the same boat, aren't you, lad? But the Light seems a fairer master... I doubt it has left you truly, Anduin.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I could say the same of you and Azeroth. I don't think it's you... I think there is much we don't know.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|That may be. But if I were you, I'd enjoy my break from being a king and savior of the world. Figure yourself out. Rest.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|My relationship with the Light is not like yours to Azeroth. But... I can see what you mean.}}

As does Magni:
{{dialogue|The battle that started on Dalaran is far from over, <name>! An' here I am already sidelined by me injuries--for now.

I'm lucky ye came to me aid when ye did! An' that the earthen showed up.

Not sure I trust 'em. Especially that Baelgrim. He seems uppity to me. No respect for me or Moira...

<Magni winces in pain.>

But if they will help us with the nerubians... we have tae give them a chance.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|These earthen. They're a funny lot. Odd traditions. Superstitions.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|What... do you mean?}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Titans, Edicts... [[Thraegar]]...}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Some of them have been calling me [[Arathi]]. Like the [[Arathor|ancient human empire]]. I... wonder how they know of it.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Aye. I heard that too.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I don't know what to make o' it. The earthen are also an ancient people. They might just be rememberin' ghosts.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|But it seems like the Arathi were here--recently. Why would the earthen have an inn with proper food and beds if they don't need them?}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Do ye think the Arathi are here somewhere in Khaz Algar?}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I don't see how. But... it bears investigating.}}

[[File:Delver's Headquarters.jpg|thumb|[[Brann Bronzebeard]] and [[Sir Finley Mrrgglton]] at [[Delver's Headquarters]]]]
Outside, [[Rannida]] starts [[Crossroads Plaza (quest)]]. Just northeast, [[Brann Bronzebeard]] has taken over what's now [[Delver's Headquarters]] with [[Sir Finley Mrrgglton]], [[Reno Jackson]], and a number of [[Reliquary Researcher]]s and [[Expedition Scout]]s. Speak with Brann:

{{dialogue|Ah, the adventure of exploring the unknown! 

There's nothin' like it, eh <name>?

{{gossip|quest=|You made it, Brann! What's going on here?}}}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|I'm not about tae leave the Isle of Dorn unexplored! I have a reputation tae uphold.}}

Head north into [[Foundation Hall]], and speak with [[Auditor Balwurz]] past the four thrones.

During development, Baelgrim and Merrix are having a conversation on their thrones:
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Attacks continue across the isle. We cannot respond to them all.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|Nor can we rebuild the Coreway without help. The Unbound--}}
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|They broke their oaths. We do not need them.}}
