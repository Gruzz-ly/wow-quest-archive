==Objectives==
Interrogate 5 Line Workers to gather information on the shipments.
* [[Line Worker]]s interrogated (5)

==Description==
There has to be something we're missing. The tip we received was from a very reliable source. We have no reason to believe we were being misled.

The councilward will want us to get to the bottom of this, and I refuse to disappoint him.

We haven't been able to get any additional information out of the workers, but maybe you'll have more luck.

Speak to the ones we have detained here, and see if you can learn anything.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Someone here has to know something.

==Completion==
Ah-ha! False bottoms in the crates? Very clever.

That could be enough proof by itself to shut down this depot for good. But for the Councilward's records, we will need a full report of any smuggled goods we find.

==Notes==
Upon accept, [[Merrix]] appears with two [[Oathsworn Councilguard]]s:
:{{text|say|Merrix|I was told this depot was closed for an investigation. Is that so, Kragad?}}
:{{text|say|[[Peacekeeper Kragad]]|Councilward! Yes, we received word that this supply line was being used for smuggling.}}
:{{text|say|Merrix|I see. And have you found proof of these activities?}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Kragad|I, uh... Not yet, sir. But <name> is helping us get to the bottom of it!}}

Interrogate the workers:
:{{text|say|Line Worker|I do not know anything, I swear on the Edicts. My directive is just moving crates.}}
:{{text|say|Line Worker|[[Trader Harthan|Harthan]] abides by his directives precisely! This is an honest operation!}}
:{{text|say|Line Worker|Who are you? We [[Oathsworn]] owe no outlanders any explanations!}}
:{{text|say|Line Worker|I have no idea what Kragad is talking about!}}
:{{text|say|Line Worker|Fine, fine! The crates have false bottoms for hiding goods. But we do not know what is in them!}}
:{{text|say|Trader Harthan|I--I swear to the [[titan]]s, I did not know about this!}}
