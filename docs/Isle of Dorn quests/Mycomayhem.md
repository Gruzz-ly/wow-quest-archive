'''Mycomayhem''' begins the optional Spores of Dread chapter of the [[Isle of Dorn storyline]], required for [[Sojourner of Isle of Dorn]].

==Objectives==
Collect 30 Boskroot Spores from [[fungarian]]s in [[Boskroot Basin]].
* [[Boskroot Spores]] (30)

==Description==
[[Woldkeeper Freydrin|Freydrin]] was the leader of my order. I was sent here to assist them. I was too late.

There is a darkness that haunts these woods, <race>.

These woods were Freydrin's home. It was her charge to tend to them, so given by [[Freya|the Keeper]] herself. And now she is gone and her woods run amok.

Bring me the spores of these mayhemic menaces. Perhaps there is a way to cleanse this land yet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have them all?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I will take a close look at them. The fungarians of these woods pose a greater danger than any of us anticipated.

We must be prevent their spread.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Woldtender Igris|Aggh! Not like this, Woldkeeper! You were meant to guide us.}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Woldtender Igris|The fungarians must be stopped before they spread to every forest on the Isle of Dorn.}}
