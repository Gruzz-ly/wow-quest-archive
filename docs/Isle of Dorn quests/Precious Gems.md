==Objectives==
Meet [[Natalia Pearce|Natalia]] by [[Basalteous]]'s cave.
* Meet Natalia outside the cave {{co|29.3|87.3|Isle of Dorn}}

==Description==
So, all they gave us was a location and a garbled riddle...

But I guess we know where to start.

I can picture it now. Once I have Basalteous's  knowledge, I will have nobles and [[merchant]]s lining up outside my house. No, my mansion!

The [[earthen]] did say southwest, right? I will find the cave and meet you there. Quickly now!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|34}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Look at the walls of this cave. Look at all these gems! I can't believe it. The story must be real! 

I am going to be so, so rich. And influential. And powerful.

I need to sit down for a moment and catch my breath.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Natalia Pearce|I can't wait. Soon everyone will know my name and reputation. I will meet you there.}}

Head southwest to find Natalia outside a small unnamed, but gem-filled cave on the coast:

{{dialogue|What took you so long? Those raging elementals could have killed me! 

I mean, luckily they didn't see me, but you could have gotten here a bit faster!

<Natalia lets out an annoyed sigh.>

Let me know when you are ready to enter the cave.

{{gossip|quest=|After you.}}

:{{text|say|Natalia Pearce|Come on! Let's go!}}
:{{text|say|Natalia Pearce|Look at this place...}}
:{{text|say|Natalia Pearce|Are these the standing stones?}}

The four [[Standing Stone]]s, clockwise from the north, read:
{{book|content=<This standing stone depicts a carving of a figure standing tall and proud, pointing at a mountain. Many kneel under the cover of their shadow.>}}
{{book|content=<This standing stone depicts the carvings of a figure surrounded by mirrors. The person is adorned with many gems, more than they can carry, more than they will ever need. While the reflections are smiling, the person is frowning.>}}
{{book|content=<This standing stone depicts a carving of a figure with large eyes looking at a large rock creature. The creature has gems embedded within them and around them.>}}
{{book|content=<This standing stone depicts a carving of a figure with many gems behind them. The figure's unusually long arms are reaching for more gems.>}}
