==Objectives==
[[Rannan Korren|Rannan]] wants you to kill 12 gorlocs.
*[[Gorloc]]s slain (12)

==Description==
[[Tharessa Sunstrand|Tharessa]] has done some reconnaissance for us and found the gorlocs are digging up artifacts and... cuddling with them.

I think it means that the artifacts emit heat? Maybe that means some artifacts are still functioning?

Imagine--the [[titan]]s created [[technology]] to shape [[Planet|worlds]], and now a fish uses it to warm their fins. Hah!

The gorlocs won't give them up, and I don't want to be a Rannan-kabob either. I hate to ask because they just want to be warm, but could you do something about them?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you get them? I thought I saw one sneak by a moment ago...

==Completion==
Wonderful! Now we can focus our attention on what really matters--the artifacts. I wonder what we will discover?

==Notes==
;Rannan's gossip
{{Dialogue|
Just so you know, my expedition this time is officially sanctioned. I got my own expedition! Can you believe it?

I guess my rogue spelunking in [[Zaralek Cavern]] was a risk worth taking! I got promoted, and I met the new dragon Aspect!

Okay, okay, crashing was a setback, and yes, all my gadgets are at the bottom of the ocean and the [[gorloc]]s are probably going to find them...

But! Think how many discoveries in this titan-test-site playground are just waiting to be dug out by professionals like us!

;Tharessa's gossip
{{Dialogue|
On the way here, [[Tuberros]] told me about his adventures with Rannan. Some of it sounds made up. 

He said that Rannan is a famous "gadgeteer," but he lost all of his gadgets in the crash. Yeah, okay. Likely story.

Rannan sensed I thought Tuberros was lying and started telling me about how he used to be a mage in training. 

He claimed the headmasters let him go because he was "just too good." Right.

Who assigned me to this guy? And, question, why is the [[niffen]] here?

:{{Text|say|Tuberros|Don't worry. If there were somethin' fishy around here, I'd smell it.}}
:{{Text|say|Rannan Korren|Yeah, we know what we are doing. Tubes and I are professionals.}}

Kill [[Shimmerfin Mender]]s, [[Shimmerfin Oracle]]s, and [[Shimmerfin Scrapper]]s.
