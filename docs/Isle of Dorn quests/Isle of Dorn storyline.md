# Isle of Dorn storyline

[[File:VZ-Isle of Dorn.jpg|thumb|[[Isle of Dorn]] zone map]]

The '''Isle of Dorn storyline''' begins [[The War Within campaign]] on the [[Isle of Dorn]].

==Intro: Visions of Azeroth==
[[Magni Bronzebeard]], the Speaker of [[Azeroth]], attempted to commune with her to interpret the meaning of the [[Radiant Song]]. During the attempt, he lost consciousness. When he awoke, he informed Azeroth's champions that Azeroth had been trying to warn them that [[Khaz Algar]], a titan installation, was in danger. In response, Azeroth's champions assisted in preparing [[Dalaran]] for transportation to the island. Once the city was teleported, [[Archmage Drenden]]—who had mysteriously reappeared after years of absence—revealed himself to be [[Xal'atath]], the Harbinger of the Void. Xal'atath launched an assault on the city with an army of [[nerubian]]s under her command. While Khadgar engaged Xal'atath in battle, the champions and their allies descended to the [[Isle of Dorn]]. Despite Khadgar's efforts, Xal'atath emerged victorious. She then used the [[Dark Heart]] to destroy Dalaran, reducing the floating city to rubble.

==Campaign==
The three-chapter campaign is tracked in [[The Isle of Dorn (achievement)]].

===Breaking Point===
[[File:Violent Impact.jpg|thumb|After the fall]]
After Dalaran's crash on the Isle of Dorn, the city's survivors defended themselves against nerubian forces commanded by [[Queensguard Zirix]]. During the battle, the [[earthen]] [[Stormward Baelgrim]] and his [[Stormriders]] arrived to aid them. Soon afterward, an explosion went off in [[Dornogal]], the earthen capital. Baelgrim—who remained wary of the survivors—led them there to investigate. Together, they repelled the nerubian attackers, but discovered that the [[Coreway]], an earthen-forged passage leading toward Azeroth's core, had been sabotaged during the assault. In response, [[Jaina Proudmoore]] returned to [[Stormwind]] to request reinforcements, while [[Thrall]] traveled to [[Orgrimmar]] to do the same. [[Alleria Windrunner]] departed to pursue Xal'atath, leaving the remaining survivors in Dornogal to assist the earthen.

===Earthen Fissures===
[[File:Hypocenter.jpg|thumb|Dead nerubians and trapped earthen]]

In Dornogal, the [[Alliance]] and [[Horde]] assisted the earthen in clearing rubble and rescuing survivors, gaining access to the [[Archive]]. Inside, they met two additional members of the [[Council of Dornogal]]: Speaker [[Brinthe]] and [[Councilward Merrix]]. The Council determined that the Coreway could not be rebuilt without the aid of the [[Unbound]], the original architects of Dornogal who had departed the city many years earlier. Councilward Merrix requested that [[Moira Thaurissan]] and Baelgrim seek out [[Adelgonn]], the Unbound's leader and a former Stoneward of the Council, in [[Freywold Village]]. Adelgonn was reluctant to assist Baelgrim, but the outsiders earned her trust by rescuing her people from the [[Delves|delve]] [[Earthcrawl Mines]]. With Baelgrim's support, Adelgonn pledged the Unbound's assistance in restoring the Coreway. Soon after, a nerubian swarm was sighted advancing toward the [[Proscenium]], where many wounded earthen were being housed. At the site, Alleria Windrunner engaged Queensguard Zirix. Zirix ultimately retreated, with Alleria giving chase. The outsiders and Baelgrim repelled the nerubian assault, securing the Proscenium and protecting the wounded.

===The First Blow===

With Adelgonn's return to the Council of Dornogal, the Unbound and [[Oathsworn]] began working together once more. At Councilward Merrix's direction, the Unbound commenced repairs on the Coreway. To safeguard the effort, Baelgrim sought to rally the Stormriders at the Stormperch. Upon arrival, Baelgrim discovered that his second-in-command, Stormguard Gorren, had corrupted the [[Rookery]] with a dark influence, leaving the Stormriders nearly destroyed. The outsiders aided Baelgrim in defeating a [[Voidstone Monstrosity|corrupted beast]] within the Rookery's depths, but with his forces depleted, Baelgrim devised a new plan to counter the nerubian threat. At the [[Cinderbrew Meadery]], Baelgrim prepared a trap to lure the nerubians inside and ignite the [[cinderbrew]] kegs to destroy them. The outsiders assisted in setting the trap, but during the ensuing battle, the nerubians overwhelmed them and sabotaged the fuses. As Queensguard Zirix led his swarm into the meadery, Baelgrim detonated the stores himself, sacrificing his life to ensure the nerubians' destruction. Adelgonn, [[Wenbrandt]], and the outsiders returned to Dornogal to report Baelgrim's death.
