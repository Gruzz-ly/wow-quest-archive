==Objectives==
Help [[Aethas Sunreaver]] send a message to the surviving [[mage]]s of [[Kirin Tor]].
* Letter to the survivors written

==Description==
<Aethas sighs heavily, his voice tinged with sorrow.>

[[Dalaran]]... once a symbol of unity and [[arcane]] mastery, now reduced to rubble and ash. Again.

So much loss and so much pain. Friends and comrades gone in an instant, their voices silenced by [[Xal'atath]].

<He takes a deep breath, steeling himself against the overwhelming grief.>

But now is not the time for tears. We must find other survivors, regroup, and offer them solace in this time of darkness.

However, the right words do not come easily.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}

==Progress==
What does one say in times like these?

==Completion==
We have taken the first step at least.

Now, we wait.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Aethas Sunreaver|I've been struggling to find the right words to pen this letter.}}
 
Three Letter banners in front of Aethas light up. From left to right, they read:

{{dialogue|The loss of Dalaran and of much of our fellowship is a great tragedy.

I think we would all benefit from coming together to meet informally as comrades to discuss the fate of the Kirin Tor going forward.

Our most pressing agenda would be how to preserve and also make safe the crash site of Dalaran.

I understand if returning (or seeing it destroyed for the first time) may be too much, but those of you who can, please make your way to the Isle of Dorn.

I would benefit from seeing you and do need your help.

{{gossip|quest=|Select this letter.}}}}

{{dialogue|Dalaran has fallen, but we, the Kirin Tor, have not been vanquished.

The time to act is upon us. Our order must rise from the ashes and once again fulfil our duties not only as defenders of Azeroth but as the curators and custodians of magic.

Join me on the Isle of Dorn to pick up the pieces of our legacy and the mantle of our responsibility.

Join me in rebuilding the Kirin Tor!

{{dialogue|We, those who remain of the Kirin Tor, have much to mourn.

Many of us have lost colleagues, friends, and loved ones in the wake of Dalaran's crash.

But to do right by those who we lost, we must look forward to the future and make sure their sacrifice was meaningful.

Find me in the Isle of Dorn, and we will bring closure to this fateful chapter of the Kirin Tor.

{{gossip|quest=|Select this letter.}}}}

Pick any, and Aethas will turn the letter into an arcane orb and fire it off in the distance.
