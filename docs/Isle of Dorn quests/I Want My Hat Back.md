Ye may have noticed a change in me fashion. 

Some goblin went and took me hat! And all the treasures we had collected so far!

I'll tell ye how it all went down.

*[[Delver's Gob-Trotter]]
*{{cost|23|40}}

==Completion==
And now ye know the whole story. 

But at least I swiped the button for the buggers ride. 

You take it! I got bigger things to handle.

==Notes==
Speak with Brann again:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|What happened to your hat and all of our treasures?}}}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|The story began one day while I was explorin' Earthcrawl Mines...}}

This starts a small scenario, set in the [[Earthcrawl Mines]] at Tier 11 with [[Johnny Awesome]] serving as the adventurer, but having already suffered 22 deaths before managing to kill the first Nerubian Lord:
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|I think it's about time we take a break, Johnny.}}
:{{text|say|Johnny Awesome|But we just defeated the first group! Perhaps you could lead on from here?}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|...Alright lad. Just keep an eye out for those webs.}}

The UI calls Johnny out for this:
:{{abilities|Tier 11|icon=achievement_legionpvp2tier5|Johnny Awesome has no right dragging Brann into this difficulty. Don't be like Johnny.|id=472931}}

Brann has three abilities:
# {{Abilities|Get Out Of There!|Shout for your fellow delver to get out of the way. Why are they always standing in the way of something bad?|icon=ability_warrior_battleshout|id=472365}}
# {{Abilities|Don't Stand In Those Webs|Alert your fellow delvers about the dangers of standing in nerubian webbing.|icon=inv_ability_web_nova|id=472366}}
# {{Abilities|Pause Story|Stop listening to Brann's story.|icon=ability_revendreth_demonhunter|id=472380}}

Brann's #1 and #2 abilities will do as warned! Loot the dead nerubian lord to pick up [[Johnny's Share of the Spoils]], which might cover Johnny's repair cost, and a [[Giant Pile of Gold]]:
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Here's your take of the spoils!}}

In the second room, the floor is carpeted with dead nerubians:
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|That's a lot of dead nerubians. Who did all of this?}}
:{{text|say|Johnny Awesome|I'll keep an eye out for any treasures while you dig through those corpses.}}

Interact with the [[Crispy Nerubian]] on the minecart tracks:
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Hrm... somethin' isn't right here. Looks like some traps took out these nerubians.}}
:{{text|say|Johnny Awesome|No need to be cautious Brann. I see some treasure over there!}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Don't step there-}}
:''Johnny runs over a landmine, knocking him out, stunning Brann, and blasting Brann's hat clean off his head! The Underpin runs up on his mech.''
:{{text|say|The Underpin|Gotcha! More trespassers. I own all the underground... including all these curios ya found in it!}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Ye blasted... give me back those curios!}}
:{{text|say|The Underpin|And I'll take that hat too! Ya gotta learn ALL the delves belong to the Underpin now!}}
:''The Underpin picks up Brann's hat, then runs away.''
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Ye can take me treasures... me curios... but nobody gets away with takin' me hat!}}

After the scenario ends, Brann continues:
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|And that's how some overpowered goblin stole me hat! Oh and all of the treasures we earned.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Not tae worry. I swiped the device for his "Gob-Trotter." Yours for the takin'.}}
