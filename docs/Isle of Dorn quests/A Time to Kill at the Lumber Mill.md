==Objectives==
Meet [[Lamplighter Kaerter]] outside of [[Skolzgal Mill]].

==Description==
Alright, let me see if I get all of this. [[Shipwright Isaebela|The shipwright]] brings an entourage up here to get [[lumber]] for [[Arathi airship|airships]].

But the shipwright is actually [[Order of Night]], along with most of her group. So they murder the loyal [[Arathi]], kidnap [[earthen]], and force them to run the [[lumber mill]] up here.

And now we gotta deal with the Order AND whoever their new friends are.

<Kaerter swears and shakes his head.>

C'mon, let's head to the mill. We got a lot of bad guys to kill and time's wastin'.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Nerubian]]s. Lots and lots of nerubians.

By [[Beledar]]'s [[Light]] do I hate nerubians.

==Notes==
Before starting the quest, Leif has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|I did not know the [[Lamplighters]] could call forth such powers! Kaerter insists he is not special and surmises that I too could learn such powers with practice and patience.

There is much about these Lamplighters that intrigues me. Not the least of which is their creed that Kaerter has summarized as "defend the weak, help the troubled, and don't die."

<Leif nods approvingly.>
