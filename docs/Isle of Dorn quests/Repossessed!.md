==Objectives==
Recover Brann's lost gear.
*[[Writ of Repossession]] examined

*Search for clues in [[Tazavesh]] (Optional) {{co|62.3|89.7|Tazavesh||1}}

==Description==
I think ye may have guessed what my problem is by now, <name>. 

My clothes, my tools, my curios! Everything but my boots and hat, which I'm nae giving up again. 

All repossessed by some cartel thug who said I was delinquent on my void storage payments, if ye can believe it. 

Would ye be willing to help Ol' Brann out of this pickle? I'm sure if ye just explain that this is all some sort of mistake, they'll give back all my hard earned gear. 

Or at least me britches.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*1,200 [[XP]]
*[[Delver's Mana-Skimmer]]

==Progress==
Has it always been this breezy in Dornogal?

==Completion==
I can't believe it was a ruse all along.

A shame about the curios, but at least ye got me britches back!

==Notes==
Interact with the purple [[Writ of Repossession]] on the table in front of Brann:
{{book|Writ of Repossession|content=Valued customer,

An unpaid balance on your void storage rental has forced us to place your account into arrears.

As part of proceedings, please turn over any enchanted items, magical artifacts, powerful weapons, and delve curios that might be in your possession to the recovery agent presenting this writ.

Failure to do so may result in the forfeiture of your stored materials.


Thank you for your compliance,

- F. Akename and Sons Void Storage, Tazavesh}}
:{{Text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Tazavesh, ye say? That does sound like a good place to start looking for this F. Akename character.}}
:{{Text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Maybe ye should go ahead, though. I'm not exactly at my most presentable.}}

If the Spatial Rift to [[K'aresh]] is not already unlocked, complete [[A Shadowy Invitation]] and start [[Return to the Veiled Market]] as part of the [[Ghosts of K'aresh campaign]] to open the portal in [[Foundation Hall]] in the northeast corner.

In Tazavesh, speak with the [[Retired Void Storage Agent]] just north of the portal:
{{dialogue|No, I can't get you access to your junk...I mean valuable possessions.

I'm retired.

{{gossip|quest=|<Ask about F. Akename and Sons void storage.>}}

What are you talking about? That's clearly not-

Wait, I have seen someone that matches your description. On the other side of the city, near the inn.

Try there.}}

Find [[F.Akename]] in [[Astral Getaways]] at the northern end of Tazavesh, near the portals to bountiful delves:
:{{text|say|F.Akename|How many hats could one dwarf need? Well, one more for the fire.}}

Speak with her:
{{dialogue|Valued customer! How unexpected.

If you are here to discuss the accounts of one Brann Bronzebeard, I am afraid the situation has not improved.

I am unable to return his impounded items until the account is fully settled.

Perhaps if you were to turn over your arms and armor, we could open a dialogue on the matter?

{{gossip|quest=|Drop the act! This ends here.}}}}
:{{text|say|F.Akename|Honestly, I'm surprised it worked as well as it did.}}
:''F.Akename drops her disguise and stuns the player, revealing herself as [[Nexus-Princess Ky'veza]]!''
:{{text|say|Nexus-Princess Ky'veza|Someone with deep pockets has it out for you, my dear little delver, and I intend to collect.}}
:{{text|say|Nexus-Princess Ky'veza|I'll see you in the shadows.}}
:''Ky'veza teleports away.''

At Ky'veza's feet are two crates, one containing [[Brann's Repossessed Gear]], and another holding [[Brann's Impounded Curios]]. The gear is easily collected, however the curios crate was trapped and explodes, knocking the player away!

Take the handy [[Delver's Headquarters]] portal behind [[Ba'kel]] to quickly return to Brann. Complete the quest to earn [[This Machine Flies?! Don't Care I Got It!]]
