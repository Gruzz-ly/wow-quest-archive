==Objectives==
Complete one Theater Troupe event in The [[Proscenium]].
* [[Theater Troupe]] event completed

==Description==
The Proscenium is looking amazing! Are you ready to get on stage?

Give us a hand as part of the crew, and we'll give you a chance to act.

Will you accept this directive?

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+500 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) (first time) or 25x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
I haven't seen you on stage yet, <name>. You won't win any fans by standing around!
