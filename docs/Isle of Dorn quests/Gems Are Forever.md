==Objectives==
Lure out Basalteous by placing a core by each standing stone.
* First core placed
* Second core placed
* Third core placed
* Fourth core placed
* Defeat [[Basalteous]]

==Description==
I am so close, I can feel it in my bones.

Place the [[Igneous Core|cores]] next to each standing stone. It is time to summon Basalteous.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]
*[[Design: Solid Amber]]

==Progress==
This is it. I can feel it.

==Completion==
That was almost effortless! For me, at least.

Can you imagine what I can do with this knowledge? Can you imagine my name spoken in [[Stormwind]]? [[Gilneas]]? Maybe even [[Orgrimmar]]!

I will be able to do and achieve everything I wanted. Everyone will finally look up to me. I will have all the gold for all I can find and create!

==Notes==
Place the first core:
:{{text|yell|Mysterious Grindy Voice|A king of old, blinded by pride, he thought he could rule more than just his mortal subjects.}}
:{{text|say|Natalia Pearce|Did you hear that? It must be Basalteous! We got its attention.}}

The second:
:{{text|yell|Mysterious Grindy Voice|The curse of never-ending desire brings mortals and creators alike to their knees.}}
:{{text|say|Natalia Pearce|Haven't you heard? Greed is good, you old grouch. Let's keep going.}}

The third:
:{{text|yell|Mysterious Grindy Voice|The self-consumed love for one's appearance hides the inner gem from sight.}}
:{{text|say|Natalia Pearce|What does that even mean?}}

And the fourth:
:{{text|yell|Mysterious Grindy Voice|Coveting others' natural talents leads to stagnancy and self-ruin.}}
:{{text|say|Natalia Pearce|I didn't come here for a lecture. I just want --}}
:''Basalteous pops out of the ground!''
:{{text|say|Natalia Pearce|Basalteous! Quick, <name>, subdue it!}}
:{{text|say|Basalteous|I do not wish to fight you mortal.}}
:{{text|say|Basalteous|I am here to grant you your heart's desire.}}
:{{text|say|Natalia Pearce|What? Really? That was easier than I thought!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Natalia Pearce|I am ready, creature! Give me your knowledge!}}
:{{text|say|Basalteous|As... you... wish.}}
:{{text|say|Natalia Pearce|What is happening? No!}}
:''Basalteous encases Natalia in a Standing Stone of her own.''
:{{text|say|Basalteous|To know the gem, one must learn humility, patience, and nurturing--like the high mountains and deep caves that harbor gems.}}
:{{text|say|Basalteous|You will remain in this form for many eons until your inner silent screams cease and the calmness of your mind guide your heart to the task.}}
:{{text|say|Basalteous|Only after thousands of years of this stillness will you learn the truth of the perfect gem as I do. You will wait patiently. Like the others before you.}}
:{{text|emote|Basalteous' gaze falls upon you as it returns to the earth.}}
:''Basalteous dissapears.''

Her Standing Stone reads:
{{dialogue|<Its carvings fresh and deep, this standing stone depicts a human woman. Her hand is outstretched as if trying to command Basalteous. Beside her is another figure resembling you.>}}
