==Objectives==
Report to [[Merrix]] and [[Adelgonn]].
* Report to Merrix

==Description==
Merrix and Adelgonn will be expecting an update. On my way here, I heard that they're all heading to the [[Proscenium]] to commit to the war officially. You should go and brief them on the readiness of the [[Stormriders]].

I'd like a moment with [[Zarein]] here. But we'll be along soon. And we'll be bringing [[Baelgrim]]'s spirit with us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This is a critical moment for all [[earthen]].

==Completion==
[[Titan]]s... what have they done?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Olbarig|I see now... We were both right, Baelgrim. Stormrooks can be free but choose to serve. Would you fly with me?}}
:{{text|say|Olbarig|Thank you, Zarein. We will honor Baelgrim together.}}

Before leaving, Olbarig has gossip:
{{dialogue|I came here to say goodbye to an old friend. I did not expect to be reunited with another. To see Zarein here like this is to feel Baelgrim at my side again.}}

At the [[Proscenium]], [[Merrix]] and [[Adelgonn]] have gathered a number of [[Oathsworn]] and [[Unbound]] earthen:
:{{text|yell|Merrix|Oathsworn! Unbound! It is time for us to come together as one!}}

Many characters have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Rooktender Lufsela|I never dreamed I'd be standing up here for such a moment. My head is spinning. I'm just a rooktender after all. How did I even get involved in this?

But if I hadn't, we would have no Stormriders. And no stormrooks for me to tend.}}

{{dialogue|title=Adelgonn|It is long past time we broke from the Edicts. I am glad the Oathsworn are finally willing to embrace the freedom that the Unbound have known for so long.}}

{{dialogue|title=Overlord Geya'rah|Too much standing around for my taste. If the earthen are going to fight, then let them fight. I do not understand the purpose of this gathering.}}

{{dialogue|title=Thrall|The Horde and the Alliance have done what they can. But the most important step can only be taken by the earthen themselves. They must do this of their own free will.}}

{{dialogue|title=Lady Jaina Proudmoore|So this is where the earthen spoke with the titans? If only they would speak with us now. But what might they say?}}

{{dialogue|title=Moira Thaurissan|I wish Dagran were here to witness this. Where has that boy run off to now?}}

{{dialogue|title=Kurdran Wildhammer|We sure I'm needed down here for this? Perhaps we could use a celebratory aerial flyover?}}

{{dialogue|title=High Exarch Turalyon|I must commend the earthen for their commitment to their duty, but it is high time they broke from these ancient strictures and redefined their priorities.}}

{{dialogue|title=Stormrider Adalar|Let's go be fabulous, Phawa.}}

{{dialogue|title=Stormrider Kothilde|I think Troumer would like to see what's next. And so would I!}}

{{dialogue|title=Stormrider Gurnot|Veytar and I are ready to serve.}}

Speak with Merrix:

{{dialogue|title=Merrix|The time has come. We earthen are ready to commit ourselves to this fight. That is, of course, if the Stormriders are ready?

{{gossip|quest=|Reporting in.}}}}

An [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|6PAYeOL-dEs|The Edicts}}

''Exterior, the Proscenium. [[Merrix]] is facing [[Adelgonn]] and [[Rooktender Lufsela]] on the edge of the platform. In the background are [[Overlord Geya'rah]], [[Thrall]], [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]], the adventurer, [[Moira Thaurissan]], [[Kurdran Wildhammer]], [[High Exarch Turalyon]], [[Alleria Windrunner]], [[Stormrider Adalar]] with [[Phawa]], [[Stormrider Kothilde]] with [[Troumer]], [[Stormrider Gurnot]] with [[Veytar]], and [[Shraubendre]].''

{{text|bossemote|Merrix|So... we are in agreement?}}

{{text|bossemote|Adelgonn|Yes. We must assist our new allies. And to do that we must renounce the edicts--forever.}}

{{text|bossemote|Merrix|It is fitting then, that we do so here--where it all began... Where the Edicts were written. Who would like to do the honors?}}

''Adelgonn raises her hammer and climbs upon the titan console. Merrix turns to face the earthen in the stage area below.''

{{text|bossemote|Merrix|I, the Councilward of Dornogal, declare that we are all... Unbound!}}

''With a grunt, Adelgonn swings her hammer down on the titan console, destroying it. As chunks scatter out into the audience, the ground rumbles. Everyone looks around as wildlife all fly or run inland. From a dock on the shoreline, an earthen is startled by a colossal titan construct rising from the sea, stomping ashore.''

After the cutscene, everybody has gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Rooktender Lufsela|How could the titans do this? They... they have to be stopped!

Please, outlander, lead the Stormriders in my stead. Just promise me that you will all come home safe.}}

{{dialogue|title=Adelgonn|The titans would never condone their creations standing on their own two feet. But we choose to go to war, and if that means we must also war with them, then so be it.}}

{{dialogue|title=Overlord Geya'rah|I smell a battle. We'll be ready when it comes. But you should go meet it head on.}}

{{dialogue|title=Thrall|That machine will lay waste to the isle. Go, champion! Lead the Stormriders into battle and let them to meet their destiny.

They are ready, as are you.}}

{{dialogue|title=Lady Jaina Proudmoore|How could the titans do such a thing? Would they raze the isle simply out of spite? Well, they will have to go through the Horde and the Alliance to do so.}}

{{dialogue|title=Moira Thaurissan|What madness is this? The titans would truly eradicate the earthen rather than see them follow their own paths?}}

{{dialogue|title=Kurdran Wildhammer|So the titans have fielded a giant slow-moving machine made of metal, wading across a large body of water? If that wasn't tailor made for the stormrooks, I'll eat me beard. Show 'em what our new recruits are made of. Lightning!}}

{{dialogue|title=High Exarch Turalyon|Trouble comes, but we will be ready to do our part. Go now, and do yours, hero.}}
