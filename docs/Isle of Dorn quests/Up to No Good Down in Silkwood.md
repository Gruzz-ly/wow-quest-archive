==Objectives==
Collect Silkwood Explosive Barrels, then destroy the [[nerubian]] tunnel at [[Silkwood Grotto]].
* [[Silkwood Explosive Barrel]]s collected (3)
* Silkwood tunnel collapsed
*Meet Lamplighter Kaerter outside Silkwood Grotto.

==Description==
The [[Order of Night|Order]] is moving the wood through the nerubians. [[Peacekeeper Leif|Leif]] said he saw [[Shipwright Isaebela|the shipwright]] leave the cave and head down to the beach.

The nerubian tunnel must be down there. You're going to have to seal that Flameforsaken passage.

While slinking around, I noticed the Order brought explosive barrels with them. Find a few and use them to blow the tunnel.

Get going <name>. I'll be right behind you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 13,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you take out the tunnel?

==Completion==
Good stuff <name>. That should put a dent in their plans!

With that tunnel gone, ain't no way for them to send that wood to Hallowfall now. That makes the mill all but worthless.

Phew! Order stopped, earthen saved, nerubians killed. Job well done if you ask me!

I don't know 'bout you, but I could use a vacation.

==Notes==
Colelct the three barrels inside the grotto and place them at the Pile of Explosive Barrels.
