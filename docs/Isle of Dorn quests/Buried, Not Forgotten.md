==Objectives==
Find Modhina and her belongings in [[Gemvein Tunnels]].
*Modhina's belongings (3)
*[[Modhina]] found

==Description==
Several suns ago, my friend Modhina ventured into [[Orecreg|the quarry]] cave. She wanted to find rare [[ore]] for [[Hreka]], to help her craftsmanship. Modhina was excited, I remember. A rare feeling for [[earthen]].

She hasn't returned. The [[fungarian]]s prevent us from searching the area.

It would mean a great deal to us if you could look for her. I didn't know it was possible to spend so much of the day thinking about what if's.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Be careful. I fear more sinister things lurk in these tunnels.

==Completion==
You've returned! Did you find Modhina...? What is all that you are carrying?

==Notes==
Find [[Modhina's Notes]], [[Modhina's Bag of Ore]], and [[Memory Gem Fragment]] on the corpses of [[Acute Blightspore]]s and [[Festering Sporemass]]es in the [[Gemvein Tunnels]].

Modhina herself has succumbed to the fungal infection and is near the [[Ashen Stonestalker]]:

{{dialogue|<Chunks of stone are missing from the earthen body, and the remains are streaked with mud.

Tiny pale mushrooms sprout densely all over the corpse. Larger, bulbous growth protrudes from the earthen's mouth and ears. A broken memory gem sits crushed within the body.

This must be Modhina.>}}
