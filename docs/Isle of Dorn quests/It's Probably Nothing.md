==Objectives==
Interact with the titan orb.
*Interact with the [[Titan Orb (object)|titan orb]]

==Description==
You found a buzz orb!

...Er, that's what the [[niffen]] call it. I just kind of went with it.

It's still in a good condition. Still buzzing, humming, and warm to the touch! I haven't seen one since we were in [[Zaralek Cavern]]!

<Name>, you should see if we can get it to work. I will stand back here, just in case it is, um, not friendly.

Nothing to worry about, I'm sure.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+500 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) and 180x [[Resonance Crystals]] (first time) or 205x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Progress==
Yes, yes! It will be very exciting to hear what you have discovered.

==Completion==
Alpha site? Defense grid?

I don't like the sound of that.

We should get going. I don't want to be here if its friends come back with it.

That's not a reunion party I want to be a part of.

Hopefully it won't hone in on Tharessa... Nah, probably not. Anyway, we should get going. Like now.

Catch you later, <name>. Thanks for your... um, help? I guess?
