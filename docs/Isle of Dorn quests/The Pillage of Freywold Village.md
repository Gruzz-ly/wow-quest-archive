==Objectives==
Search for clues as to where the [[Arathi]] went.
* First clue collected
* Second clue collected
* Third clue collected

==Description==
The [[Shipwright Isaebela|Arathi shipwright]] was here but has moved on with most of her entourage. She had left a few Arathi behind but...

Soon after the shipwright left, [[earthen]] started disappearing. The villagers suspected the Arathi but had no proof. Then one day, the remaining Arathi left town in the middle of the night.

The locals said the Arathi stayed at the [[inn]]. Can you look there for any clues as to where the Arathi are now?

Given the villagers' hostility, [[Lamplighter Kaerter|the Lamplighter]] and I shall remain here for the moment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I am attempting to convince the villagers that the Lamplighter is not involved in these disappearances.

Did you find anything useful?

==Completion==
If I understand correctly, the Arathi are abducting earthen?

And they are also killing each other?

What madness is this?

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|Alright, let me help you. Give me the names of the missing, their physical descriptions, and where they were last seen.}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|I am curious. Why do you prioritize finding these missing earthen over your own people? They are not your concern.}}
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|I'm a Lamplighter. It's part of my creed to help anyone who needs it--no matter how annoying they are.}}

[[Freywold Constable]] has gossip:
{{Dialogue|Our people started going missing when the Arathi first arrived. At first we thought our neighbors had simply gone out of town but more and more started disappearing.

We questioned the Arathi but they denied any wrongdoing. Then, one morning, we discovered the Arathi had left in the night.

We have been combing the countryside searching for them and our people, to no avail.
}}

For the first clue go to the [[Freywold Village]] inn:
:{{text|say|[[Findorn]]|I found this Arathi book in one of the rooms. Can you take it to the Constable?}}

Inspect the nearby [[Arathi Journal|journal]]:
{{Dialogue|... the earthen on the surface have resources in abundance that we severely lack in Hallowfall.

Many years ago, the earthen exported these resources for use in Arathi airships. However, ever since trade was suspended, we have had to rely on our reserves for these resources.

The Order of Night has control of some of these reserves, but not enough. We need more.

{{Gossip|quest=|<Take the journal.>}}
}}

:{{text|say|Findorn|You're looking for clues? The Arathi might have left something else in the rooms. You should go back there and check them out.}}

Go in one of the rooms in the inn where you find a [[Conspicuous Arathi Candle]]:
{{Dialogue|<A badly burnt letter fragment has escaped the flame of the candle.>

... kill the lapdogs of the emperor. Dispose of them in the hills above the village.

... capture the earthen as covertly as possible ...

{{Gossip|quest=|<Take the burnt letter fragment.>}}
}}

The last clue can be found outside [[Freywold Village]], in the east, where you find the body of a dead [[Arathi Soldier]]:
{{Dialogue|<You find a scribbled note in the pocket of the dead Arathi. Blood covers most of the note but some parts remain legible.>

... Order of Night has infiltrated ...

... are abducting the earthen ...

... require more workers to harvest ...

... send reinforcements immediately ... 

<It seems he was killed before he could deliver this message.>

{{Gossip|quest=|<Take the note.>}}
}}

After collecting all the clues, one gets ambushed by two [[Nightshade Ambusher]]s:
:{{text|say|Nightshade Ambusher|I'll be taking that!}}
:{{text|say|Nightshade Ambusher|The Lamplighter will be next!}}

Upon returning to Leif:
:{{text|say|Lamplighter Kaerter|Thanks for standing up for me. But that don't mean we're partners, got it?}}
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Leif|I have it. But my orders are to assist you and find the Arathi. I cannot just leave you.}}
