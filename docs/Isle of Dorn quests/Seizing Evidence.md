==Objectives==
Collect 3 Seized Shipments.
* [[Seized Shipment]] (3)
* [[High-Quality Coal]]
* [[Moleskin Apron]]
* [[Assorted Chisels]]

==Description==
[[Merrix|Councilward Merrix]] has authorized trade goods from the [[Ringing Deeps|Deeps]] to be transported through this depot. However, we have received a tip that more than crafting materials are being sent and received here.

[[Dornogal]] observes strict rules about what we trade and with whom. All commerce must serve the Edicts, not the interests of individuals. We do not abide unsanctioned trading.

We have started going through the crates here to find smuggled goods, but we haven't found anything--yet. Help us take a look.

==Rewards==
This quest line is part of unlocking:
:Earthen Allied Race

You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The tip we received was from a highly reliable source. There must be something here.

==Completion==
That is odd... These are very normal trading goods. There is nothing illicit here.

This is all you found?

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Peacekeeper Kragad|Go through those crates, <name>. I want to see anything you find.}}
:{{text|say|Trader Harthan|It's just crafting supplies from the Deeps, sir. Nothing else!}}

Open the nearby [[Shipment Crate]]s to loot [[High-Quality Coal]], [[Moleskin Apron]], and [[Assorted Chisels]].
