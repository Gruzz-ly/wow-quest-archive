'''Heart of a Hero''' concludes the Seven Soldiers optional chapter of the [[Isle of Dorn storyline]], one of several required for [[Sojourner of Isle of Dorn]].

==Objectives==
Defeat the three [[gorloc]] shaman leaders.
* [[Burgle-gurgle]] slain {{co|51.7|82.8|Isle of Dorn}}
* [[Murgle-whurgle]] slain {{co|51.1|84.7|Isle of Dorn}}
* [[Purgle-lurgle]] slain {{co|49.3|83.9|Isle of Dorn}}

==Description==
It seems the gorlocs have been bolstering their forces with summoned elementals. That explains how they were able to overrun the farmers so easily.

It will take all of our strength to hold off the colossi already in the field. I need you to stop any new elementals from being created.

Elementals of this size and power can only be created by the most powerful of gorloc shaman. Seek them out behind enemy lines and eliminate them.

This should end the gorloc threat to the farmers once and for all.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Luminescent Pearl Band]]
* [[Sparkling Pearl Ring]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|56|18}}
*13,000 [[XP]]

One-time warband bonus:
*[[Council of Dornogal Commendation]] (+500 [[reputation]] with [[Council of Dornogal]]) (first time) or 25x [[Resonance Crystals]] (alts)

==Completion==
Thank you for your aid stranger. Without you, none of this would have been possible. You have given us back our livelihood today, and our hope.

Take this as a small token of our gratitude. It is not enough, but it is all we can offer. Know that you will always be welcome among our people.

Let us now turn our attention to Aggartha.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Aggartha|With me, my friends! I ask you to follow me one last time! Once more to battle!}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|Charge!}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|For Aggartha!}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|AGGARTHA IS INVINCIBLE!}}
:''They all charge south into the field.''

The three gorloc leaders are on the southern end of the [[Glimmering Shore]], each channeling a [[Burgeoning Seaborne Clossus]].

On return, Aggartha gave her all in a heroic last stand:
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|Aggartha...}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|She gave everything for us...}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|But how could she fall?}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Dorbund|When we had no one to turn to, Aggartha chose to help us. Not out of reward or obligation, but simply a sense of duty to her fellow earthen.}}
:{{text|say|Dorbund|As we fought the colossi, these gorlocs here attempted to flank us. With no one available, Aggartha split off alone to intercept them.}}
:{{text|say|Dorbund|Though vastly outnumbered, Aggartha held the line and defeated these foes before you. But her injuries were too grave and she succumbed to her wounds.}}
:{{text|say|Dorbund|Even in death, she has refused to fall. Aggartha has made an impact on all of us. She shall live on, in our minds and memories. She will be remembered.}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|She will be remembered.}}
:{{text|say|Merrimack|She will be remembered.}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|She will be remembered.}}
:{{text|say|Garrak|She will be remembered.}}
:{{text|say|Bertola|She will be remembered.}}
:{{text|say|Kaldrinn|She will be remembered.}}
:{{text|say|Eiggard|She will be remembered.}}
:{{text|say|Pearl Farmer|She will be remembered.}}

All named characters have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Dorbund|The gorlocs have been beaten back for now, but clearly they are a greater danger than any of us ever realized.

Aggartha may be gone, but her legacy lives on. We pearl farmers now have the weapons and training to defend ourselves from further attacks.

It is our responsibility to carry forward her spirit of courage, generosity, and perseverance.

Such was her way. And now, it is our way as well.}}
{{dialogue|title=Bertola|I have been building a collection of items I enjoy so that when I am gone, I can live on through my collection. But perhaps there is a better way.

I have decided to give away the items in my collection to people who will value them most. I will not try to live on through trinkets and items.

Instead I will live on in the memories of my friends and the happiness I share with them.}}
{{dialogue|title=Eiggard|Don't get me wrong, I'm still planning to live forever!

But Aggartha showed me it has to be a life worth living. And I'll have to work on that.}}
{{dialogue|title=Kaldrinn|I've been searching for the perfect gift for my dear friend. But what I've learned is that the gift itself is unimportant.

She will love whatever gift I give because she cares about me. And in the end, the greatest gift we can give to each other is our presence in each other's lives.}}
{{dialogue|title=Garrak|The farmers have agreed to furnish me with all the pearls I will need for my experiments. I still believe we should focus our efforts on restoring the machines so that our race has a future.

However, since that outcome is not guaranteed, perhaps we can allow for some time to enjoy the present -- while we still have it.}}
{{dialogue|title=Merrimack|I came here to find out why pearls are so valued. But instead I learned why life is so valued.

All things will end. Given infinite time, this is inevitable. But the focus must be on the journey, not the destination.

This moment of my life is priceless because once it is experienced, it will never come again. And we do not know when the journey will end.

Simply put, the purpose of life... is to live.}}
