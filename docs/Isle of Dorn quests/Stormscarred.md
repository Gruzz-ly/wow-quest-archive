* [[Stormscar]] slain

==Description==
Take a look around this beautiful town. What do you see? Ranchers 'n' their [[mosswool]]s. But where is this rancher's flock? In the guts of a beast, they are. Stormscar they call 'im.

Stormscar, whose howl is as the thunder. Whose bite is lightning. Whose belly is full of my life's work.

I came here to buy weapons and all we have is ranching equipment. You look strong. Would you put an end to Stormscar's reign in our pastures?

==Progress==
