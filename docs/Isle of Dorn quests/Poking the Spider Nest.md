==Objectives==
Throw a Keg of Cinderbrew Mead into the [[nerubian]] burrow and then return to the [[Meadyard]].
* [[Keg of Cinderbrew Mead]] taken {{co|74.5|41.0|Isle of Dorn}}
* Nerubian burrow disturbed {{co|75.1|38.9|Isle of Dorn}}

==Description==
[[Cinderbrew Meadery|The meadery]] is evacuated and the explosives are primed. It is time to bait the nerubians into our trap.

[[Alleria Windrunner|Your compatriot]] is by the nerubian burrow north of here. She told me her directive is to keep watch over it in case the nerubians make a move before we are ready.

So far they have not made a move and may now need... coaxing. Take a keg of cinderbrew to the burrow. Tossing it in should stir their "nest."

Rendezvous with us back at the Meadyard--quickly--after.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The nerubian swarm is on its way.

Prepare yourself.

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|Baelgrim|Set off the keg and hurry back to the meadyard. Then we will finish our preparations.}}

Head to the north end of the [[Meadyard]], pick up a keg, then run northeast to Alleria, who is staring down a webbed-over cave entrance:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Over here, <name>. Let's burn some nerubians to cinders.}}

Use the Throw Keg extra action button to toss it in:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Return to the Meadery! I'll lead them into the trap!}}

==Progression==
