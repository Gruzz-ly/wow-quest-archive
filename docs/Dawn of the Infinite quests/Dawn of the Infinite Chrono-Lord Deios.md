==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Chrono-Lord Deios (Dawn of the Infinite).jpg|Chrono-Lord Deios|Though Deios now commands the infinites, his ambition is to ensure the rise of [[Murozond]], their true leader.}}
Defeat [[Chrono-Lord Deios]].
*Slay [[Chrono-Lord Deios (Dawn of the Infinite)|Chrono-Lord Deios]]

==Description==
Chrono-Lord Deios must be behind this all. As the leader of the [[Infinite dragonflight|infinites]], he's sure to have led this invasion. I bet [[Morchie]] is working for him too.

Let's head into the [[Bronze Temple]]! We need to stop Deios before he ruins the true timeline.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|112|36}}
* 19,050 [[XP]]
* [[Stasis Sand]]
* 15x [[Flightstones]]
*[[Chromie's Certificate of Temporal Tidiness]] (if Stasis Sand had already been obtained)

==Completion==
It is all thanks to you, <name>. You have saved us from the infinite's terrible dawn.

But, even more so, you have saved me from a fate that I thought was all but inevitable. You have my eternal gratitude.
