==Objectives==
Capture [[Morchie]] and question her.
* Find Morchie {{Co|61.3|77.0|Thaldraszus}}
* Accuse the real Morchie {{co|61.3|76.8|Thaldraszus}}
*Meet with Chromie and Nozdormu by the Bronze Temple in Thaldraszus.

==Description==
Morchie didn't just teleport herself away, she took all the other Chromies with her! I have a bad feeling about why...

We have to follow and capture her. And question her! I want to know what she's up to.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|14|4|50}}
*4,750 [[XP]]
*10 [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
We can't give up now! There's still time to save the temple and beat those infinites once and for all. We can't let them control the true timeline.

And I certainly will not let them turn [[Nozdormu]] into that nasty [[Murozond]].

==Notes==
Upon accept, Chromie runs out of the chamber, casts Chronoport, and disappears.

Head to the high platform north of the [[Temporal Conflux]] and south of the [[Sand-Lost Sanctum]]:
:{{text|say|Chromie|I know Morchie's here, but I can't tell which one she is! We have to figure it out.}}

Chromie's sitting on a rock, and clockwise around the island are [[Chronormoo]], [[Ol' Chrome]], [[Chro-normie]], [[CHROME-E]], and [[Crowmie]]. Speak with them:
;Chronormoo: So I chose to be a [[gnome]] in this timeline? How strange.

:{{gossip|quest=|You're actually Morchie in disguise!}}
:{{text|say|Chronormoo|Why, I never! Why don't you moo-ve on!}}
:''Chronormoo enters a time portal.''
:{{Gossip|Who are you?}}
::I have chosen to protect the balance of time through the form of a tauren. As you know, dragons choose their visage based on their own desires and experiences. I find it hard to imagine myself making any other choice.

::I am curious why the Chromie of this timeline chose the visage of a gnome. Perhaps there will be time later to speak of such things.

::{{Gossip|I understand. Thank you.}}

;Ol' Chrome: Looks like this timeline ain't big enough for all of us!

:{{gossip|quest=|You're actually Morchie in disguise!}}
:{{text|say|Ol' Chrome|Whoa there, partner. Me? Morchie? You're more addled than a time-lost [[critter]]!!}}
:''Ol' Chrome enters a time portal.''
:{{Gossip|Who are you?}}
::Well there partner, ain't that a question? There's so much I could say. My past, my present, my hopes of the future. Why such a quandary could take your lifetime to answer.

::But you ain't got time for all that right now! Just know I'm a straight shooter, through and through. I would never do a darn thing to harm the timeline, you hear?

::{{Gossip|I understand. Thank you.}}

;CHROME-E: The gears of time crank ever forward.

:{{gossip|quest=|You're actually Morchie in disguise!}}
:{{text|say|CHROME-E|Your accusation is improbable. And, more so, very rude.}}
:''CHROME-E enters a time portal.''
:{{Gossip|Who are you?}}
::I am CHROME-E. In the context of your understanding, you may surmise that I am much like the Chromie you have befriended. However, I have chosen the perfected form of a mechagnome.

::More information would breach timeline inquiry protocols. Your compliance on this matter is appreciated.

::{{Gossip|I understand. Thank you.}}

;Crowmie: The past shall be nevermore! Well, unless you have time powers like me.

:{{gossip|quest=|You're actually Morchie in disguise!}}
:{{text|say|Crowmie|Are you caw-razy? There's no way I'm Morchie!}}
:''Crowmie enters a time portal.''
:{{Gossip|Who are you?}}
::Nosy, nosy. Does the Chromie of this timeline allow you to ask such questions? Have you not considered what havoc such knowledge could cause?

::Just know that I am not your enemy, <name>. But she does stand {{wp|Among Us|among us}}.

::{{Gossip|I understand. Thank you.}}

;[[Bridgette Holdug]]
:Oy! This is my spot!

:Find your own rock!

:{{gossip|quest=|You're actually Morchie in disguise!}}
::What? Morchie?

::I have no idea what you're talking about, but could you take this little party elsewhere? I'm minding my mining here.

[[File:Who's That Chromie - Morchie and Chromie.jpg|thumb|Morchie and Chromie]]
;Chro-normie: Who, me? I'm just you{{sic}} super sweet, definitely normal friend Chromie!

:{{gossip|quest=|You're actually Morchie in disguise!}}
:''Chro-normie sheds her Regular Chromie disguise and reveals herself as Morchie. Chromie blasts Morchie with Chromiestasis.''
:{{text|say|Morchie|Oh sure, you can interrogate me. Or you could go save your precious [[Bronze Temple]].}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|The temple...? What are the infinites planning?}}
:{{text|say|Morchie|We shall ensure the rise of our master, Murozond! And the longer you stand here talking to me, well...}}
:{{text|emote|Morchie cackles.}}
:''Morchie uses Chronoport and teleports away.''
:{{text|say|Chromie|We have to go. Nozdormu needs us! If he becomes Murozond, then... We can't lose him!}}
:''Chromie runs to the southern edge of the platform, shifts to her dragon form, and flies to the [[Temporal Conflux]].''

:{{Gossip|Who are you?}}
::Oh, well, you know everything you know about Chromie? Pretty much the same goes for me! Only I'm even more normal than her. Even sweeter! Even more of a good person who would never trick or harm a living soul!

::And protecting the timeline? Why, that's my middle name! Makes signing documents quite a chore! But I'll do anything for the greater good.

::{{Gossip|I understand. Thank you.}}

[[File:Who's That Chromie - Nozdormu and Chromie.jpg|thumb|Nozdormu and Chromie]]
Catch up with Chromie and Nozdormu outside the new [[Meeting Stone]] at the Temporal Conflux:
:{{text|say|Chromie|We're here, Nozdormu!}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Too late for me, I am afraid. The [[infinite dragonflight]] has already entered the temple.}}
:{{text|say|Chromie|It's never too late! We can still stop them. We're not giving up on you.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Ever the optimist, Chronormu. Yes, we must try.}}
