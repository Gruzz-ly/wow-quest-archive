'''Rewind and Reconcile''' concludes the [[Dawn of the Infinite]] storyline. Check in with [[Nozdormu]], [[Alexstrasza]], and [[Chromie]] at the [[Temporal Conflux]] after leaving the instance.

==Objectives==
Give the Time Relic to Nozdormu at [[Temporal Conflux]] in [[Thaldraszus]].
*Speak to [[Nozdormu]]
*[[Mysterious Time Relic]] (provided)

==Description==
<You sense powerful [[time]] energy emanating from the relic you retrieved after your fight with [[Chrono-Lord Deios]]. It appears to have an engraving of two arrows pointing to the left. You should show it to Nozdormu.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|84|27}}
* 14,300 [[XP]]
*30x [[Whelpling's Dreaming Crest]]
* [[Bronze Archive Stone]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

{{Rfg-section|patch=10.2.0}}
*2x [[Wyrm's Shadowflame Crest]]

==Progress==
I sense you have a powerful relic in your possession. Would you allow me to examine it?

==Completion==
[[Chronormu]] mentioned that she found a time relic after your fight with [[Morchie]]. That device forced time to move quickly forward.

It seems this relic is of a similar power, only it can rewind the threads of time, returning one to an earlier point.

I shall safeguard it, <name>. We would not want such a device to fall into the wrong hands.

==Notes==
Speak with Nozdormu:
{{Dialogue|
Have you a moment, <name>? We would like to have a word with you.

;Speaking with Nozdormu again
{{Dialogue|
I have finally confronted a fear that had haunted me for so long. Too long. Murozond can now be left in the past. 

And I am ready to face the future with open eyes.
