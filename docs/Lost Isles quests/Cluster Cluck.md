==Objectives==
Capture 10 Wild Cluckers by attaching remote control fireworks to them.
*[[Wild Clucker]]s captured x10
*[[Remote Control Fireworks]] (provided)

==Description==
Ridiculous! The greatest goblin mind of his time reduced to food detail?!

<Hobart practically turns a deeper shade of green as his blood pressure rises.>

Do I look like I should be rounding up escaped cluckers? No, my friend, not I. Bamm most definitely, though he's too lazy. Your station in life has recently taken a turn for the worse. You do it!

Take these remote control fireworks and attach them to the cluckers, and be quick about it!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Broken Plunger|Whamo Kablamo}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost||2|25}}
*[[Empty Town-In-A-Box]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

==Progress==
Not enough cluckers, <name>. We'll all starve.

==Completion==
Success! Was there every any doubt?

Greely, fire up the poultryizer!

==Notes==
[[File:Cluster Cluck.jpg|thumb|[[:Remote Control Fireworks]] on a [[Wild Clucker]].]]
There are plenty of cluckers just outside town. Right-click on one to attach the remote-control fireworks and watch the journey it takes all over the town before landing by the poultryizer.
