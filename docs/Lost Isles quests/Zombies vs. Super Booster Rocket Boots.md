==Objectives==
Use the Super Booster Rocket Boots to slay 50 Goblin Zombies.
*[[Goblin Zombie]]s slain (50)
*[[Super Booster Rocket Boots]] (provided)

==Description==
Those zombies that got past us are nothing compared to the mob waiting just through the pass. If we don't deal with them soon, the [[pygmy]] witch doctors are going to send them against [[Town-In-A-Box (Lost Isles)|the town]], and even [[B.C. Eliminator|the cannons]] down there won't be able to handle that many!

I managed to bring a couple of shredder boots along. [[Assistant Greely|Greely]] here managed to mod them and now they're Super Booster Rocket Boots!

Use the boots to incinerate the zombies in the Oostan villages to the east.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|S.B.R.B. Prototype 1|S.B.R.B. Prototype 2|S.B.R.B. Prototype 3|S.B.R.B. Prototype 4}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost||3}}
*600 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
You still have a few goblin zombies to deal with, <name>! Look sharp, superstar!

==Completion==
You did it! No more zombies to worry about. Let's pause a moment in silence for the stinky departed.

Okay, done.

==Notes==
The boots have a ~10 yard radius, so it's not necessary to run over the goblins. Simply getting close to them is enough. Remember that the boots do not work on the headhunters or the named pygmies! Run over goblins heading to the three towns and then back to base camp. Don't bother trying to get all 100 before hitting the first town.

==Progression==
{{Pygmy mayhem}}
