== Objectives ==
Make your way up top on the upper deck of the ''[[Vengeance Wake]]'' off the shore of the [[Lost Isles]] and speak with {{NPC||Thrall}}.

== Description ==
I never thought that I would be a prisoner of the Alliance again. I cannot begin to express my gratitude to you... <name>, is it?

I will meet you up top and from there we will deal with them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*70 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]
*+10 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Completion ==
My mission is too critical to let these meddlers continue to dog us. It's up to you and I to put an end to this once and for all!

== Notes ==
Accepting the quest advances the phase. Thrall runs up top. Before the player gets there, he sets the other ships' sails on fire!

;On accept
