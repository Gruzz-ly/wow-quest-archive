== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Assistant Greely}} inside the [[Gallywix Labor Mine]] on the [[Lost Isles]].

== Description ==
We barely escaped with our hides intact!

The Trade Prince has a whole bunch of us enslaved and performing manual labor inside the cavern.

Greely helped the seven of us to get out, but she was recaptured in the process.

<name>, you're the only one crazy enough to walk into an exploding volcano! The assistant will be able to help you free the others.

Hurry! This place is about to blow for good!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Greely's Spare Dagger|Gallywix Laborer's Gloves}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost||2}}
*100 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Completion ==
<The assistant looks confused.>

Huh... what? Who?

== Notes ==
All of the class trainers are nearby. Take advantage of this opportunity!

Head in to the mine and kill [[Brute Overseer]]s on the way. Take the first right, jump off the right side of the ramp and head to the southwest to find Greely hidden in a corner.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Slinky Sharpshiv|Okay. We're going to move away from the exploding volcano and try to hook up with the orcs for the final assault on the Trade Prince. See you on the other side... I hope.}}
