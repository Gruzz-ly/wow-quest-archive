== Objectives ==
Rescue 6 Goblin Survivors.
*{{NPC||Goblin Survivor}} Rescued x6

== Description ==
<name>, I'm sorry. I thought you were dead!

This is just crazy. We sailed into a fight between the [[Alliance]] and [[Horde]]!

You know, our brothers and sisters still need to be rescued.

<He points out all of the escape pods around you.>

I think I'm going to sit here a while longer and catch my breath. Can you swim around and let them out? Take my pair of thermohydratic flippers so you can get around faster.

Let Sassy know that I'll swim in shortly.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|75}}
*480 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

== Progress ==
I still see some out there! Please, <name>, go get them before they drown!

== Completion ==
Oh thank heavens that you survived, <name>! I thought for sure that you'd drowned when I saw you go over the side!

<Sassy's eyes fill up with tears as she hugs you.>

Look at all of these folks you saved!

== Notes ==
There are Goblin Escape Pods everywhere.

;On accept
:{{text|say|Geargrinder Gizmo|Yeah, there's tons of people still trapped in the escape pods,  boss. Oh, wait. I guess you're not the boss anymore. Anyways, they're all probably going to drown if you don't get them out.}}

The first goblin the player rescues will always be Gallywix.
*{{text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Hello there, <name>. So nice of you to rescue me. No hard feelings, right?}}
*{{text|say|Goblin Survivor|Thanks, <name>. You still owe me that money, <man/lady>!}}
*{{text|say|Goblin Survivor|Blowing open my escape pod. I like your style, <name>!}}
*{{text|say|Goblin Survivor|What were those Alliance ships doing firing at us?! Did I see a Horde ship, too?}}
*{{text|say|Goblin Survivor|<name>? I heard you were dead.}}
*{{text|say|Goblin Survivor|<name>, it's you! Thanks, <man/sweetie>!}}
*{{text|say|Goblin Survivor|What, are you crazy?! Trying to blow me to smithereens like that!}}
*{{text|say|Goblin Survivor|<name>! Please tell me that monster, the Trade Prince, didn't survive?!}}
*{{text|say|Goblin Survivor|Couldn't you have just used a crowbar?}}
