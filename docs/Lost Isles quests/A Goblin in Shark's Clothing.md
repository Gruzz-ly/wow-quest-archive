==Objectives==

*Use the Mechashark X-Steam Controller
*[[The Hammer]] slain

==Description==
Combining the remains of the [[Mechachicken]] with these shark parts, we've assembled the greatest fighting submersible of all time: The Mechashark X-Steam!

[[Hobart Grapplehammer|Hobart]] and I want you to pilot, <name>. Go west into the water. You must kill The Hammer if we're to have any hope of exploiting the natural resources of the [[Dire Strait]] to their fullest extent!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|The Hammer (quest reward)|Leftover Mechachicken Legs}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost||6}}
*775 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
That monstrously humongous shark is not dead yet! Do I have to do everything myself?

==Completion==
Excellent work, my <boy/girl>! The [[Town-In-A-Box (Lost Isles)|Town-In-A-Box]] is saved thanks to my overwhelmingly unbelievable intellect and engineering know-how.

==Notes and trivia==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|<name>, get to the Mechashark X-Steam Controller. Rid us of the Hammer menace!}}

The controller is on the beach. It gives you access to three abilities:
#{{abilities|Freakin' Laser Beam|range=50|Inflicts 190 to 210 Fire damage each second upon The Hammer, for until cancelled. Every shark neads a freakin' laser beam!|notes=Instant}}
#{{abilities|Egg-splosive Barrage|range=50|Lob a deadly barrage of explosive eggs at The Hammer, doing 285 to 365 fire damage. Weapon system provided by the Mechachicken.|notes=Instant|cd=5 sec}}
#{{abilities|Repair|Repair the Mechashark X-Steam for 200. You're going to need to use this!|cd=10 sec}}

Use the Egg-splosive Barrage, and run away from The Hammer, spamming Egg-splosive everytime it's off cooldown.  Use the Repair if you get hit by the shark.  Don't bother with Freakin' Laser Beam, as this will cause you to get bitten by the shark, which hurts a lot since Patch 5.0.4

*During the beta, the shark was seemingly named "Mechashark X-Stream".
