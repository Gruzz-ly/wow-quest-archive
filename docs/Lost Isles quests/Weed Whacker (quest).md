Now is the time for creative solutions. Pull something out of that belt and get to work!

<Thinking about the situation for a moment, an idea comes to your mind and it's just crazy enough to work!>

==Progress==
There are still too many for us to get through.

Have faith in yourself, <name>. Let your true warrior heart shine through.

==Completion==
I saw it with my own eyes, and I still do not believe it!

You have our thanks and the debt of our lives, little goblin. I hope that soon we can repay you the honor.

May I ask a small favor of you while my scouts and I move on?
