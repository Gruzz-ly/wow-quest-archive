== Objectives ==
Recover the Biggest Egg Ever.
*[[The Biggest Egg Ever]]

== Description ==
{{NPC||Bamm Megabomb}}? Who does he think he is? His so-called spiny raptor eggs are no match for what we are about to recover.

As you well eknow, each [[Town-In-A-Box]] is equipped with a mechachicken for just a dietary emergency. Luckily for us, my keen intellect was able to deduce the location that our prodigious, pre-programmed poultry ran off to.

Head north to the [[Scorched Gully]], but beward, its circuit boards are fried and it won't give up its egg without a fight!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Fryer Gloves
|Mechachicken Feather Cloak
|Best. Bracers. Ever.
|Chicken Chopper
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||1|10}}
* 250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Just think about the accolades that will rain down upon me... us, when the Biggest Egg Ever is returned!

== Completion ==
Eureka! My genius saves the day yet again! Take that Bamm Megabomb!

And now, to reap the benefits!
