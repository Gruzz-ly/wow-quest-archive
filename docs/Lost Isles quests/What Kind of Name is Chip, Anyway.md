== Objectives ==
Slay Chip Endale.
*[[Chip Endale]] slain

== Description ==
<Dude/Girl>! You're never going to guess who's out on the [[KTC Oil Platform|oil platform]] to the north.

<Ace shakes head in disbelief.>

Chip's out there, and he's working for the {{NPC||Trade Prince Gallywix||Trade Prince}}. That traitor's now working for the other team. But worse, I heard he's going out with your ex-girlfriend, {{NPC||Candy Cane}}!

I don't know about you, but if he was going out with my ex, I'd do something about it.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Ex-Stealer's Gloves|Fickle Belt|Jealousy's Edge}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||10}}
*900 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Are you going to do something about him? You can't just let this stand.

== Completion ==
There's no two ways about it... he got just what he deserved.

== Notes ==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Ace|I never liked that guy. He stole your girlfriend. I say, good riddance!}}

Pick up [[Release the Valves]] before heading out. Hop on the oil platform, take the first left and go straight. Chip's inside the building at {{coords|49.8|13.9|Lost Isles}}.

;On aggro
:{{text|say|Chip Endale|I can't believe you'd do this to me!}}

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Lookout}}
