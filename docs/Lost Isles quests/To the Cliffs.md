==Objectives==
Speak with {{NPC||Scout Brax}} on the path down the cliffs north of the [[Savage Glen]] on the [[Lost Isles]].

==Description==
I sent Scout Brax along the road to the cliffs overlooking the beach.

I am going to put you onto {{NPC||Bastia}}. Travel down the path and let Brax know that we are going to take a different route.

We'll see you at the attack on the [[Alliance Beachhead|Alliance beachhead]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*70 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]
*+10 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
Hello, little <race>. Bastia is fast, no?

We have something very important that needs doing. Can you help us?

==Notes==
Accepting the quest will automatically put players on Bastia. She will stop just north of the Alliance Beachhead, next to Scout Brax.
