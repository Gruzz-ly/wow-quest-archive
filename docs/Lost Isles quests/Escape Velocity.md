==Objectives==
Use the Single-Stage Booster Rockets to launch the cages of 10 [[Kezan Citizen]]s or [[Goblin Survivor]]s.
*Cages launched (10)
*[[Single-Stage Booster Rockets]] (provided)

==Description==
We really don't have time to rescue those that are incompetent enough to get themselves captured over and over. Still, since I have some rockets leftover from loading up your "ultimate" footbomb uniform, we can take care of the problem with ease.

Take these single-stage booster rockets down into the [[Slave Pits]] to the north and affix them to the cages. That will get those idiots out of their cages in a hurry.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Rocket-Fuel Soaked Bracers
|Orbital Leggings
|Orbital Greaves
|Cage-Launcher's Plate
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
You still have more cages to liberate from their [[Azeroth|Azerothian]] bonds.

==Completion==
Oops. Well, what goes up must eventually come down.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Booster rockets for cages. What will I think of next? I am a genius!}}
So, the pirates drop [[Slave Pits Cage Key]]s, but they don't appear to be necessary. In the middle of the slave pits at {{coords|39.7|27.9|Lost Isles}} is the class and profession trainers.

;On launching:
:{{text|say|What are these rockets for?!}}
:{{text|say|3... 2... 1...}}
:{{text|say|The pirates have keys!}}
:{{text|say|Mommy!}}
:{{text|say|<Name>, you and Hobart are going to be the death of me!}}
:{{text|say|Um... you do realize that there's a bottom to this cage?!}}
:{{text|say|Just open the door... oh no!}}
