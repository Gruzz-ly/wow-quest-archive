== Objectives ==
Use a {{NPC||B.C. Eliminator}} to defeat 30 Oomlot Warriors.
*[[Oomlot Warrior]] defeated x30

== Description ==
<Name>, you have to defend us!

I had the eggheads deploy the town's cannon defenses, but it seems like there's an unlimited supply of these [[Oomlot tribe|Oomlot]] warriors!

Get your behind into one of those B.C. Eliminators and eliminate the threat to the town!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Town-In-A-Box Lid Fragment|Mini B.C. Eliminator}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||2|25}}
*525 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
That's not enough, hon. Can you take care of more of them?

== Completion ==
Okay, I think that's good enough for now, but they took a bunch of the townsfolk captive.

We're going to have to take the fight to them!

== Notes ==
Hop in the cannons and spam the #1 key.
