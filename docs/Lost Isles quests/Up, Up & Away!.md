== Objectives ==
Survive the Rocket Sling shot across the [[Dire Strait]].
*Rocket Slig Trip Survived

== Description ==
While you were rescuing {{NPC||Thrall||the Warchief}} and saving us all from the [[Alliance]], {{NPC||Foreman Dampwick}} built this rocket-sling to shoot us over the shark-infested strait to the bigger island.

Luckly for us, the foreman managed to salvage a [[Town-In-A-Box]] from the shipwreck. Once you get it setup, we'll have a town of our own. I can't wait to sleep in a bed again.

Dampwick's down there at the [[Landing Site]], waiting for you. Why don't you take the next rocket over?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*70 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
<Name>!

== Completion ==
<Name>, I sure am glad you survived the trip... not everyone did!
