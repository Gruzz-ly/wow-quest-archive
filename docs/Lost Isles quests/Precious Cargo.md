==Objectives==
Locate the precious cargo below deck on the Alliance ship, ''[[Vengeance Wake]]'', off the shore of the [[Lost Isles]].
*Precious Cargo located

==Description==
They said that their "precious cargo", whatever that is, is being held on the Alliance ship, the ''Vengeance Wake''.

There's only one thing to do... fly this thing out there and retrieve it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|10}}
*350 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]
*+75 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Perhaps you can help me to get out of this arcane cage?

==Completion==
If not for you, I would surely be on my way back to [[Stormwind]] to be paraded as a trophy and a slave.

The Alliance dogs found me unconscious on the shore and put me in this arcane cage. It was keeping me from connecting with the elements.

No longer!

==Notes==
Accepting the quest will automatically put the player on the gyrochoppa, which will fly out to the Vengeance Wake and blow up as it reaches the deck. Head astern and below deck to the captain's quarters.
