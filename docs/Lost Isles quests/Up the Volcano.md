==Objectives==
Speak with [[Coach Crosscheck]] at the [[Lost Peak]] on the [[Lost Isles]].

==Description==
A whole bunch of our people headed up to the top of the volcano to mount a counter-offensive. There's something horrible brewing up there on the Lost Peak.

They're waiting for you before they make any moves against the [[Pygmy|pygmies]]. Those evil little things turned a lot of us into zombies!

<Name>, save us!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*80 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Completion==
My star player has arrived!

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|Say|Sassy Hardwrench|Those zombies are slow. You don't have to run right through them. Don't let them eat your brains, <name>!}}

Follow the zombies to the north. Stay off the path, though, as the zombies will actually turn to attack. They move slowly, thankfully.

==Progression==
{{Pygmy mayhem}}
