== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Izzy}} at [[Oomlot Village]] on the [[Lost Isles]].

== Description ==
The [[pygmy|pygmies]] took most of our people back to their village. Who knows what evil they're up to?

<Name>, you have to go up there and free all of the captives before the pygmies work their voodoo on them!

Izzy's already up near Oomlot Village to the southeast. She'll give you the heads-up on what's going down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*70 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Completion ==
I'm glad that they sent you up here. I thought for sure they were going to send that jerk, {{NPC||Hobart Grapplehammer||Grapplehammer}} and his {{NPC||Assistant Greely||ego-enabling assistant}}.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Sassy Hardwrench|You're going to have to take the fight to them, <name>. Look for Izzy just outside their village.}}

Head back up the path and take a left to head to Oomlot Village. Izzy is just outside town on the right.
