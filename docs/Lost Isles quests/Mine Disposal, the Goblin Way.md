==Objectives==
Detonate 12 Land Mines.
*Land Mines detonated
*[[Satchel of Grenades]] (provided)

==Description==
Those no good [[gnome]]s have given the [[dwarf|dwarven]] paratroopers land mines to lay down on the beach!

<Sassy mutters to herself about gnomes trying their hands at explosives.>

{{NPC||Thrall||The Warchief}} asked me if there's anything we can do about that. I told him, 'You bet we can!'. I was thinking maybe you could take this satchel of grenades and detonate the land mines from a safe distance.

It's how we do things, right?!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3|50}}
*625 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

==Progress==
Boss, do you think you could go back down there and detonate a few more?

Thanks!

==Completion==
Score one for the goblins! Stupid dwarves and gnomes.

==Notes==

:{{text|say|Sassy Hardwrench|Goblin grenades versus gnomish land mines. SHow them who's better, <name>!}}
Pick up [[Repel the Paratroopers]] and [[The Heads of the SI:7]] before heading out. Plenty of mines along the beach.
