==Objectives==
Destroy [[Blastshadow the Brutemaster]]'s soulstone.
*[[Blastshadow's Soulstone]] destroyed

==Description==
This nightmare will never be over with Blastshadow the Brutemaster still breathes. There are a couple of problems, though.

One, being a [[warlock]], he's got a [[succubus]] named [[Delicia Whipsnaps]]. If you kill Blastshadow quickly, the [[demon]] will be returned to whence it was summoned.

The second problem, being that Blastshadow is a warlock, he has a [[:soulstone]] that will allow him to resurrect. You have to get his soulstone and destroy it so that he'll be dead forever!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Delicia's Tights|Soulstone Breaker Wristbands|Soulstone Breaker Bracers}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost||55}}
*200 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
The soulstone is the key, <name>!

==Completion==
Your soulstone has expired, Blastshadow!

==Notes==
Target and focus Blastshadow. The succubus will die when he does. Then, loot the Soulstone and throw it on his corpse to shatter it.

On success:
