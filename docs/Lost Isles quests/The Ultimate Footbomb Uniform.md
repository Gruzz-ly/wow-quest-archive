Look, kid, I'm here to see to it that you've got a fighting chance at the end game. Thrall's going to need your help in the fight against the [[Trade Prince Gallywix|Trade Prince]].

[[Assistant Greely|Greely]], [[Hobart Grapplehammer|Hobart]] and [[Coach Crosscheck|I]] have a plan to put together the ultimate footbomb uniform for you so that you can win the game, but I'm going to need some things first.

Lucky for us, this lumber yard is sick with spare shredder parts. Now get out there and give me 110%.

You will receive:
*{{cost||4}}
*650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let's see what you have there, <name>.

==Completion==
Yeah, these will do nicely. You did good, kid. I'll see to it that you get the best footbomb uniform ever made.

In the meantime, you've got other bombs to drop on the Trade Prince's lackeys.
