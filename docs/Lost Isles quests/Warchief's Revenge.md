== Objectives ==
Use the powers of the Cyclone of the Elements to slay 50 Alliance Sailors.

Once this is done, you will be flown to the [[Wild Overlook]].
*[[Alliance Sailor (Lost Isles)|Alliance Sailor]] slain (50)

== Description ==
Brothers of Earth and Fire, hear me! Sisters of the Water and Air, heed my call!

Azeroth stands on the brink, its existence near an end! Lend me your power as in times past with my ancient ancestors. Allow me to channel your will through this child of [[Kezan]].

Let us put an end to those who would keep us from healing the world!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Cyclone Staff|Whirling Axe}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost||4|50}}
*700 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]
*+350 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Completion ==
You have done what few others could have, <name>. Our world owes you a debt larger than you can possibly understand.

== Notes ==
Accepting the quest will buff players with "Cyclone of the Elements" and turn them into a tornado. Use the Lightning Strike ability to kill Alliance sailors.

;Thrall
Thrall is channeling his magic. The human sailors run around in fear as torrential rain falls down and as Thrall summons lightning bouncing between their ships, setting them on fire. The few who try to escape via row boats are exterminated by you.
