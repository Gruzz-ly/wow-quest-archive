== Objectives ==
Deal with the leader of the naga at the [[Ruins of Vashj'elan]].
*[[Faceless of the Deep|Leader of the naga]] dealt with

== Description ==
<Name>, you and Ace need to march those naga hatchlings down there and use them as leverage to convince the leader of the naga to surrender to us.

Ace knows where to go on the south side of the ruins... just follow him.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Hatchling Gloves
|Hatchling Prodder
|Hatchling Handlers
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||1|10}}
* 250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
What's wrong?

== Completion ==
A [[Faceless of the Deep]]? What's that? That does NOT sound like a naga!

Well, you killed it, whatever it was. It doesn't matter now. We have other fish to fry....

== Notes ==
Follow Ace down to the south end of the ruins. The naga are merely unfriendly instead of actively hostile.
:{{text|say|Ace|I got these little hellions on a short leash, <name>. The naga won't attack us while we have their hatchlings.}}
:{{text|say|Ace|You ready to make their leader surrender, buddy? Okay, here we go.}}
:''Ace, with a banner on his back, leads the hatchlings through the ruins while shouting any of the following.''
*{{text|yell|Ace|We're planning on having a special naga appreciation sale after your surrender is all wrapped up! Thirty percent off most goods we have in stock. Red light savings on [[Kaldorei]] artifacts today only!}}
*{{text|yell|Ace|You naga keep your distance. We're not kidding around here!}}
*{{text|yell|Ace|We've got your hatchlings. You better not attack us if you know what's good for you!}}
*{{text|yell|Ace|Prepare to surrender to the Bilgewater Cartel!}}
:''The party reaches the southern island.''
:{{text|yell|Ace|Alright, naga leader, come on out from hiding and surrender in the name of <name> and the [[Bilgewater Cartel]]!}}
:''A [[faceless one]] appears from below!''
:{{text|yell|Faceless of the Deep|WHO DARES?!}}
:{{text|yell|Faceless of the Deep|Little [[goblin]]s? I remember when your race was created.}}
:{{text|yell|Faceless of the Deep|I care nothing for your threats or these naga. Prepare to be removed from existence.}}
:{{text|say|Ace|Um, dude, this does not look good. I'm out of here!}}
:''Ace runs off.''
:{{text|yell|Faceless of the Deep|Now, young <name>, you will die!}}
:''The faceless one stops hovering and attacks the player on land.''
