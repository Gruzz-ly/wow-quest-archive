*{{Mob|SI:7 Assassin (Lost Isles)||SI:7 Assassin}} slain x10
*[[Infrared Heat Focals]] (provided)

==Description==
Keep your voice down. The [[Savage Glen|glen]] north and west of [[Wild Overlook|here]] is crawling with Alliance assassins.

Unfortunately we haven't been able to spot them. The cowards! They hide and won't fight face-to-face.

You goblins are known for your wondrous goggles. Surely you have a pair that will allow you to see them?

I need you to team up with one of my scouts and kill any of the SI:7 assassins that you spot.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Spy Choker Cord|Spy Strangler Gloves|Spy Poker}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||2|25}}
*525 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
You got them all?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>, well done. We'll make an orc of you yet.

Time to move on. We'd better hurry.

==Notes==
Put on the goggles to go into infrared mode. Everything moving has a glowing aura coming off it due to body heat. Also, the SI:7 Assassins show up on the minimap thanks to the goggles' built-in humanoid tracking. This is the only way to see the assassins before they come out of stealth. Be warned that they are always in pairs.
