==Objectives==
Using your KTC Snapflash, capture images of the three cave paintings and the pygmy altar.
*Cave Painting 1 Captured
*Cave Painting 2 Captured
*Cave Painting 3 Captured
*Pygmy Altar Captured
*[[KTC Snapflash]] (provided)

==Description==
Strange cave paintings and other artifacts abound within the [[Kaja'mite Cavern|cavern]].

Use your [[Goblin All-In-1-Der Belt|belt]]-mounted KTC Snapflash to capture images at the designated spots. In the back of the cavern, snap a photo of the altar.

Hand the intel over to [[Sassy Hardwrench]] on [[Shipwreck Shore]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|75}}
* 480 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

==Progress==
<Name>, you look like you've been spelunking.

==Completion==
What are these?

<Sassy examines the pictures while listening to your tale from the Kaja'mite cavern.>

Clearly that [[Pygmy Witchdoctor|pygmy witchdoctor]] is from some new race never seen before. Maybe we should call them <name>-ians?

They must be the ones that painted all of that stuff in the cavern. I'm not sure that I like what you're describing.

It sounds to me like they're paintings of them and us on an island with an exploding volcano!

==Notes==
While escorting the [[Frightened Miner (Lost Isles)|Frightened Miner]] in [[Miner Troubles]], players enter the [[Kaja'mite Cavern]] and pass a cave painting. Passing the cave painting will automatically start the quest. Look for a wireframe camera icon in front of each objective. The second one is up high!

Reaching the first cave painting:
:{{text|say|Frightened Miner|Whoa! What's with all of the cave paintings? Ack, do I hear monkeys?!}}
The miner will say something random at the second and third ore deposits and cave paintings.

Final ore deposit and pygmy altar:
:{{text|say|Frightened Miner|That's good enough for now. I'll make my way out on my own. Thanks for the escort, <name>!}}

Also at the pygmy altar are the [[Pygmy Witchdoctor]] and the [[Dead Orc Scout]]. The dead scout offers [[Orcs Can Write?]], the lead-in to the goblins joining the Horde.
