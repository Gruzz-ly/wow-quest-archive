Rip the Fickle Heart out of {{NPC||Candy Cane}}'s chest.
*[[Fickle Heart]]

== Description ==
Oh, sweetie! You're never going to guess who's down there in the [[Slave Pits|slave pits]] to the north.

<Sassy shakes her head sadly at you.>

Candy's down there, and she's working for the {{NPC||Trade Prince Gallywix||Trade Prince}}. She dropped you like a bad habit and now she's working for the other team, but it gets worse. Since you [[What Kind of Name is Chip, Anyway?|"dealt"]] with {{NPC||Chip Endale||Chip}}, she's dating the Trade Prince!

I don't know about you, but if she were my ex, I'd rip her fickle heart out of her chest.

== Progress ==
What did you decide to do, hon?

== Completion ==
I'm sure she deserved it, <name>. She should never have betrayed you like that.

It gives me the shivers to think that she might have kissed that monster!
