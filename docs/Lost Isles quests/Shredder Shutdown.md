==Objectives==
Slay 10 Steamwheedle Sharks.
*[[Steamwheedle Shark]] slain (10)

==Description==
That no-good [[Trade Prince Gallywix]] managed somehow to stow the whole Steamwheedle Sharks footbomb team away on the yacht. I didn't even see any of them!

Now he has them doing his dirty work here at the lumber yard. <name>, you're the <guy/gal> who [[Fourth and Goal|won the championship]] for us back home on [[Kezan]]. You've got to get rid of them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||4}}
*650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Looks like you might need to tackle one or two more of those sharks.

==Completion==
I can't say that I was ever much of a footbomb fan, but you're giving me an appreciation for the game!
