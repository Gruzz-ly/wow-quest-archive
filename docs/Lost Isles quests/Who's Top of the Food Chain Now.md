== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Shark Parts.
*[[Shark Parts]]

== Description ==
Fine, fine, perhaps the whole egg thing didn't quite work out. Who's up for some shark meat?

Only one little problem. Well, a big problem, actually. A really BIG problem: [[The Hammer]]!

Of course, I have a brilliant idea. Swim out into the [[Dire Strait]] to the west and get us some shark pelts. Give them to my assistant, {{NPC||Assistant Greely||Greely}}. I'm too important to get my hands dirty with the small details.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||2|25}}
*525 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

== Progress ==
<Name>, take it easy on {{NPC||Hobart Grapplehammer||Grapplehammer}}. He's a genius, but he's got a fragile ego.

== Completion ==
These will do very nicely! We're going to combine the shark parts and the robotic remains of the {{NPC||Mechachicken}} into a submerisble that should allow you to rid us of that nuisance, The Hammer!

== Notes ==
There are plenty of sharks in the strait. Stay well clear of The Hammer.
