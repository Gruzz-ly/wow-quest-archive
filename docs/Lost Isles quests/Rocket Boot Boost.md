== Objectives ==
Use the Rockin' Powder Infused Rocket Boots and deliver them to {{NPC||Hobart Grapplehammer}}.
*Rockin' Powder Infused Rocket Boots Used
*[[Rockin' Powder Infused Rocket Boots]] (provided)

== Description ==
You need to get these boots down into the caldera to Hobart Grapplehammer.

Now that they're infused with the leftover rockin' powder, they should have enough thrust to get you all the way there in one shot.

When you're ready, activate the boots. Don't worry, they're automatically set to land you safely.

I think.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*80 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Well there you are!

== Completion ==
There's no time to waste, <boy/girl>!

What's wrong with the actuator on the left boot?!

== Notes ==
Use the item to take a free trip to Hobart in the crater.

==Progression==
{{Pygmy mayhem}}
