The ''Pride of Kezan'' is a goblin bomber, using the vehicle UI:
#{{abilities|Machine Gun|range=100|Fire machine guns at enemy stealth fighters for 438 to 562 damage out to a range of 100 yards.|cd=0.5 sec|notes=Instant}}
#{{abilities|Wild Weasel Rockets|range=100|Does 985 to 1265 Fire damage to the nearest Gnomeregan stealth fighter and the range is 100 yards.|cd=5 sec|notes=Instant}}

Fly around and go nuts. A few hits of the machine gun or a rocket round and a single machine gun hit will down the opposing flying machines.

If you find yourself unable to aim the bomber up or down, press Space - the game mistakenly thinks the bomber is on the ground, and pressing space makes it "take off".
