== Objectives ==
Use the Bootzooka to slay Volcanoth.
*[[Volcanoth]] slain
*[[Bootzooka]] (provided)

== Description ==
It took a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, but the Bootzooka, patent-pending, is ready for use!

These no-good [[pygmy|pygmies]] have been feeding our people to their "god", Volcanoth, and they're about to unleash it on our town!

You have to get into that cave and kill that thing before it's too late!

Just be careful with the Bootzooka... it may fire some extra missiles from time to time.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Rescue Ladder Waistband
|Rescue Ladder Cord
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||1|10}}
* 250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Completion ==
I managed to get everyone else safely back to town.

Jump in, we gotta get out of here before the volcano blows for good!!!

== Notes ==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|I've set the Bootzooka to fire several rockets per shot. I'm fairly certain that I perfectly calibrated the targeting.}}
Head in to the cave. The Bootzooka has a very long range, which is great, because getting too close will get goblins killed. Volcanoth will cast Volcanic Breath, a 100-yd range spell that does 150 damage, but respects line of sight. Thankfully there is a big outcrop of rock in front of Volcanoth that can be used to duck behind when Volcanoth is winding up its breath attack.

Killing Volcanoth will advance the phase by getting the volcano ready to explode!

;On victory
:{{text|yell|Sassy Hardwrench|<Name>, come on! Get over here!!!}}
