==Objectives==
Collect 10 Fire Glands.
*[[Fire Gland]] (10)

==Description==
[[Volcanoth]] is the turtle god in the cave that [[pygmy|these primitives]] worship.

It's not really a god.

<Hobart rolls his eyes.>

But it is tough enough that I'm going to have to devise a new weapon for you from the only functioning boot we have left.

I think that the age-old motto of "fight fire with fire" applies here. Plus, I like fire!

Let's get some fire glands from [[Child of Volcanoth|Volcanoth's children]]. That should give me some time to modify the rocket boot into something more fitting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3}}
*600 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
No time like the present to be done with the simple task I put before you, <name>. Wouldn't you agree?

==Completion==
Careful with those glands, <name>, careful!

<Grapplehammer's eyes light up at the sight of the fiery organs.>

And now to load them into the refashioned shredder boot. I'm certain that you'll be amazed by my genius invention.

==Notes==

Plenty of turtles nearby.
