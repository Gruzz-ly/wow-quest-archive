== Objectives ==
Slay Gaahl, Malmo, and Teloch.
*[[Gaahl]] slain {{coords|59.6|40.2|Lost Isles}}
*[[Malmo]] slain {{coords|58.8|47.2|Lost Isles}}
*[[Teloch]] slain {{coords|63.6|52.8|Lost Isles}}

== Description ==
Look, I think it's great and all that we're destroying all of those [[Goblin Zombie|zombies]], even though they're our friends and family. But don't you think we should be taking care of the [[pygmy|pygmies]] that are creating them as well?

At the three [[Oostan]] villages: [[Oostan Nord|Nord]], [[Oostan Sor|Sor]] and [[Oostan Ost|Ost]], there are witch doctors: Gaahl, Malmo, and Teloch.

Maybe you could take care of them? I don't want to be turned into a [[Goblin Zombie|zombie]]!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Witchdoctor Legwraps
|Witchdoctor Leggings
|Oystein Bracers
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Um, boss, look. I don't know how to say this, but you might have missed one or two of those pygmy witch doctors.

I'm just saying.

== Completion ==
I gotta tell you, that's a load off of my mind. That is, I won't have to worry about no new zombies coming after my brains!

== Notes ==
Nord is north, Sor is in the middle, Ost is to the south. The named pygmies hit hard, so be careful!

==Trivia== 
It's an obvious reference to the {{wplink|Three Little Pigs}}.

==Progression==
{{Pygmy mayhem}}
