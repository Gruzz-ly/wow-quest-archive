Retrieve the Gyrochoppa Keys.
*[[Gyrochoppa Keys]]

==Description==
The [[Alliance]] have stolen something of vital importance to the [[Horde]]. It is being held out on their ships.

At the other end of the beach is a [[gyrochoppa]]. Our [[Orc Battlesworn|battlesworn]] will cover your approach.

Go retrieve the keys to the [[flying machine]] from one of their operatives.

Fly out to their flagship, the ''[[Vengeance Wake]]'', and retrieve our precious cargo!

==Progress==
Hmm... looks like overly-complicated [[Gnome Engineering|gnomish engineering]] with lost of unnecessary instrumentation and safety precautions.

==Completion==
Hmm, where the heck is the ignition?

It'll be a wonder if it flies without doing something weird, like [[Gnomish Poultryizer|turning]] into a chicken or [[World Enlarger|shrinking down]] to the size of an ant.

Hey look, someone left their loose change in the ashtray! What else is in there?

==Notes==
The keys can drop from any SI:7 Operative. The machine is guarded by a [[Gyrochoppa Pilot]].
