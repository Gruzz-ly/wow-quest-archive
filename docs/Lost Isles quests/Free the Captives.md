== Objectives ==
Free 6 Goblin Captives.
*{{NPC||Goblin Captive}}s freed x6

== Description ==
They've got a bunch of our people in there. I know that they're doing strange rituals to them. It looks like they're sucking the life force right out of them!

You have to go into the village and free the captives before it's too late!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||2|25}}
*525 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

== Progress ==
Can you free a few more, please?

== Completion ==
Great job, but that's not even half of the hostages that they took from town.

Darn it all! They must have taken the rest of the captives to their other villages up in the volcano!

==Notes==
