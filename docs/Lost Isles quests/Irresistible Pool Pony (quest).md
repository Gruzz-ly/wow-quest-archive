==Objectives==
Use the Irresistible Pool Pony to lure 12 Naga Hatchlings.
*[[Naga Hatchling]] lured x12
*[[Irresistible Pool Pony]] (provided)

==Description==
I've got a plan and you're the only one that I know crazy enough to even try it, let alone pull it off!

I need you to take this irresistible pool pony. Yes, I thought maybe I'd use it to swim with the naga.

Anyway, take the pool pony to the [[Vashj'elan Spawning Pool]] and inflate it. Then swim around their hatchlings with it on. I'll be anything that the hatchlings will be lured away and follow you around.

Bring them back here and we'll proceed with the next phase of the plan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||2|25}}
*525 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
That's not enough hatchlings.

==Completion==
Oh, they're so cute! I wish that we could turn them into little plush toys and sell them for a gazillion macaroons!

==Notes==

Head southeast, get in the water and use the float. Thankfully, it provides waterbreathing. Head down and find hatchlings. They're in groups of three guarded by a Siren. When you get close, a talk icon should appear over the naga hatchling. Right click to collect them. Collect 12 and head back.
