== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Sassy Hardwrench}} at the [[Town-In-A-Box (Lost Isles)|Town-In-A-Box]] on the [[Lost Isles]].

== Description ==
We were wrong. It wasn't the naga that were preparing to attack... it was the nearby [[Oomlot tribe]].

<Name>, you need to get back to the Town-In-A-Box. The [[pygmy|pygmies]] are already attacking!

Here, take this. We bought it off of a pygmy who said it used to belong to some great leader of theirs. Someone whose name translates as Dark Tan Helmet.

It should fool them so that they don't attack you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*70 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

== Completion ==
<Name>! We're saved!

Who am I kidding? We're all going to die!!!

The Town-In-A-Box is under attack from [[Oomlot Warrior]]s. [[Megs Dreadshredder]] gives the player the [[Dark Tan Helmet]] as disguise, leaving them unmolested on their journey back. The Dark Tan Helmet itself is likely a verbal and visual reference to the character Dark Helmet from the film Spaceballs.
