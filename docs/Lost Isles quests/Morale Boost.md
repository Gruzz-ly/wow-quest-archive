== Objectives ==
Use [[:Kaja'Cola Zero-One]] to free Ace, Izzy, Gobber, and 6 [[Goblin Survivor]]s or [[Kezan Citizen]]s.
*[[Ace]]'s mind freed
*[[Izzy]]'s mind fried
*[[Gobber]]'s mind freed
*Other goblin's minds freed (6)

== Description ==
You've got to get all the Kaja'Cola Zero-One that you can and make the [[goblin]]s drink it to boost their morale and free them!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||4}}
* 650 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Increase their morale, <name>, so that they will run to freedom!

== Completion ==
I hate the Trade Prince, but you can't argue with the results of his methods. Kaja'Cola Zero-One is a huge improvement over regular old Kaja'Cola at half the calories and twice the ideas!

== Notes ==
Loot objects as before. Also, Brute Overseers carry them too.
