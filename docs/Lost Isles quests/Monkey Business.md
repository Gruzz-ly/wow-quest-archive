==Objectives==
Feed 10 Bomb-Throwing Monkeys by passing Nitro-Potassium Bananas to them.
*[[Bomb-Throwing Monkey]]s Fed (10)
*[[Nitro-Potassium Bananas]] (provided)

==Description==
We've got major problems with the monkeys in the jungle to the east. They've stolen all of our explosives, and now they're going around throwing them.

Sometimes at us!

I had [[Fizz Lighter]] take some of his nitro and put it in these bananas. No monkey can resist a bunch of bananas!

All you have to do is go out there and feed them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:

You will also receive:

* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Did it work?

==Completion==
They launched up into the air when they ate the bananas?! That is hilarious!

I think I'm going to take a bunch out there and feed them myself!
