== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Kilag Gorefang]] at the [[Tranquil Coast]] on the [[Lost Isles]].

== Description ==
Head back down to the coast and tell Kilag that I'd like for you to borrow {{NPC||Bastia}}. The [[panther]] knows the way to where your friends are being held captive.

Go now. I will see you again before we make our move against the {{NPC||Trade Prince Gallywix||Trade Prince}}.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 90 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]
* +10 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Completion ==
Of course you can borrow Bastia. That is, if she'll take you.

<Kilag winks.>

== Notes ==
Kilag is down the first ramp to the north, still fighting off paratroopers.

==Progression==
