==Objectives==
Inform [[Aggra]] at the [[Horde Base Camp]] on the [[Lost Isles]] of all that has transpired.

==Description==
Return to the Horde Base Camp and let Aggra know that we still live, <name>.

Tell her that I am moving on to the [[Wild Overlook]] and that we will all meet up on the west side of the island. I expect to see you there.

We will track down the Alliance and slay them to the last!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*70 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]
*+10 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Completion==
<Aggra gives you the eye as if she doesn't quite believe what you are telling her.>

I am not easily impressed, but if what you are telling me is true, then I have never before heard of such a thing.

Now that you have helped them move through [[Vicious Vale|that deathtrap]], [[Kilag Gorefang|Kilag]] will take his scouts further down the trail. We will hunt down those Alliance cowards and put an end to them!

You have my thanks, <name>.
