== Objectives ==
Take the Field Journal to {{NPC||Sassy Hardwrench}} at [[Shipwreck Shore]] on the [[Lost Isles]].
*[[Field Journal]] (provided)

== Description ==
Looking through the {{NPC||Dead Orc Scout||dead orc's}} belongings, you find a field journal. Though it is heavily water damaged, the writing is still legible, if barely.

Flipping through the pages, an interesting story unfolds. Good thing you decided to study [[Orcish (language)|Orcish]].

Like the {{NPC||Trade Prince Gallywix||Trade Prince's}} yacht, the [[orc]]s were fired upon by [[Alliance]] [[warship]]s. You do remember an orc warship you passed right before the Alliance opened fire. Maybe they were firing on the orcs instead of your ship?

Stupid orcs! They got you sunk!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*65 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
<Name>, find anything interesting in the cavern?

== Completion ==
Orcs?! They were sunk and stranded too? And now the Alliance are on the island? Do you think they're going to kill us?

<Sassy looks thoughtul.>

I think it's time for a little sitdown with these orcs.

==Progression==
{{Lost Isles first island}}
