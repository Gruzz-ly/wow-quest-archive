== Objectives ==
Release Valves #1 - 4.
*Valve #1 released
*Valve #2 released
*Valve #3 released
*Valve #4 released

== Description ==
We have to stop {{NPC||Trade Prince Gallywix||Trade Prince Gallywix's}} oil supply and bring his machines to a grinding halt.

We're going to need you to go out to the [[KTC Oil Platform]] and release the valves to overload the coolant system. After you do that, head to the platform control panel and set it to blow.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||5}}
*675 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
You have not yet released all four of the valves. The coolant to the platform is still functioning within normal operating parameters.

== Completion ==
All of the lights and indicators on the control panel are going crazy!

== Notes ==

:{{text|say|Assistant Greely|It's time for a little sabotage!}}
Pick up [[What Kind of Name is Chip, Anyway?]]/[[The Fastest Way to His Heart]] before heading out. The first two valves are on deck, while valves 3 and 4 are accessible after jumping into the water. The control panel is back on deck on the west side.
