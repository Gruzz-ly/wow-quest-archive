==Objectives==
Collect 5 scoops of Rockin' Powder.
*[[Rockin' Powder]] (5)

==Description==
I'll give those [[pygmy|pygmies]] one thing... they sure know how to party! But they're not so clever. I think I've discovered the source of their rockin' powers: Rockin' Powder!

It just so turns out that this stuff, which turns them into world-class rockers, is also highly explosive. We must have it!

So, while you're in there at [[Oostan]] to the east, make sure that you pickup a whole bunch of the stuff. Trust me, you're going to need it for what's coming up!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3}}
*600 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

==Progress==
Hmm, let me see how much you've got.

==Completion==
This will do. In fact, it's more than we need. I devised an ingenious idea for a weapon that the boots will be turned into once you get them to Hobart.

Hand the powder over and I'll load it into the [[:Super Booster Rocket Boots]].

==Notes==
There's dirt piles everywhere. Pick areas near zombies only, kill the zombies with the boots, then pick up the dirt once there's nothing active nearby.

==Progression==
{{Pygmy mayhem}}
