==Progress==
Are you having second thoughts?

==Completion==
Serves her right for running off with Chip in the first place.

==Notes==
Prior to patch 11.2.0, this quest was only available to characters with body type 2. The counterpart quest for characters with body type 1 was [[She_Loves_Me,_She_Loves_Me_NOT!]]. These are the only quests in WoW dependent on body type. The two quests cross-complete. After the patch [[It's All in the Image]] lets players choose their partner.
