==Objectives==
Escort the [[Frightened Miner (Lost Isles)|Frightened Miner]] through the [[Kaja'mite Cavern]].
*Kaja'mite Ore mining a success!

==Description==
[[Smart Mining Monkey]]s!

They're all over the inside of the cavern, mining... with picks! It's just not nature and I'm sure it's because of the [[Kaja'mite]]!

None of my miners have come back out. I don't have many left! You can see my predicament, <name>.

<The foreman lowers his voice.>

These guys are nowhere near as good as my old group of jungle trolls. Ah, those were the days.

Maybe you can escort my last miner here through the cavern and keep those monkeys off of him? We need that Kaja'mite!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Dampwick's "Best" Robes
|Miner's Vest
|Miner's Overcoat
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
How did it go? How much Kaja'mite were you able to get?

==Completion==
We've hit the mother lode!!!

Now, what's all this about a [[Pygmy Witchdoctor|pygmy witchdoctor]] in charge of the monkeys? Is he dead? Because if he's dead, then legally I can stake my claim... not that I wasn't going to do that anyway. By goblin law, all Kaja'mite belongs to us!
