== Objectives ==
Slay Yngwie.
*[[Yngwie]] slain

== Description ==
The [[Oomlot tribe|Oomlot]] leader, Yngwie, is too powerful to be left alive. He's barking nonsense from the raised west side of the village, across the rope bridge.

Go up there and slay him before he sends the rest of the village against us.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Yngwie's Vest|Pygmy Cloak|Oomlot Staff|Yngwie's Tunic}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||55}}
*200 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
<Name>, I still hear Yngwie yelling!

== Completion ==
Nice work, bud! Hope he wasn't too tough.

== Notes ==
Yngwie is on the southeast side of the village. Either head along the south of the town and circle around from the east or head up the ramp on the west side and cross the bridge to reach him. Yngwie will leap to start the fight, and he spawns a Voodoo Illusion at 50% health.

==Progression==
{{Pygmy mayhem}}
