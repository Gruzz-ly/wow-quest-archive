==Objectives==
Gather 6 Spiny Raptor Eggs.
*[[Spiny Raptor Egg]] x6
*[[Wild Clucker Eggs]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Hobart Grapplehammer|Hobart]] thinks he's going to feed us on those tiny clucker eggs? bah! We're going to get some real eggs!

I've already set up some traps on the [[Raptor Rise]] up the path to the east. Take this bunch of wild clucker eggs and lay them in the traps. The spiny raptors will go right after the clucker eggs, and then you'll get to trade up to their larger eggs.

Genius!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||2|25}}
*350 [[XP]]
*+525 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
How many did you get? I can just taste the massive omelette we're going to cook up now!

==Completion==
Nice! Look at the size of those things!

There's no way that Grapplehammer's going to be able to top those!

==Notes==
Head up to the east and look for the big raptor traps. Stand on top of one and place an egg in it. Loot the egg dropped by the raptor who comes and gets trapped.
