== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Sassy Hardwrench}} at the [[Wild Overlook]] on the [[Lost Isles]].

== Description ==
Our destinies are forever intertwined. There are events taking place that are reshaping our world and ultimately will destroy it. We must put an end to them before it is too late.

Know that you can always count on me, <brother/sister>! We will meet again on the larger island. May you find peace until then, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*70 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Completion ==
Wow, oh wow! Is that who I think it is?

You rescued {{NPC||Thrall}}, Warchief of the Horde?!!!

<Sassy gives you an appraising look.>

Wel, let's see about getting over to that larger island. I sure as heck don't want to swim [[Dire Strait|the strait]] with all of those sharks down there.

==Notes==
Everyone is waiting to get on the rocket ship.

I saw Dampwick ride across on that thing. I'd rather use a Slow Fall spell, but I don't know that one yet.

Sounds like you've had quite the adventure, <name>. There must have been plenty of [[moolah]] on those Alliance creeps.

{{Dialogue|
I've been patient up to this point, but if they don't get that rocket sling working soon, I'm going to shadow bolt someone!

*{{text|say|Evol Fingers|That rocket looks unsafe even by our standards!}}
*{{text|say|Evol Fingers|Why are we rocketing over to an island that has a volcano? Didn't we barely survive this scenario on Kezan?}}
*{{text|say|Evol Fingers|I swear this line's not moving!}}
*{{text|say|Evol Fingers|Is that a volcano over on that other island?}}
*{{text|say|Evol Fingers|Time is money, friend!}}
*{{text|say|Evol Fingers|By the looks of that thing I might take my chances swimming with the sharks!}}
