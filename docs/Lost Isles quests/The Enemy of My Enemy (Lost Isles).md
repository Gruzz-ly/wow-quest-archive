==Objectives==
Deliver the Field Journal to [[Aggra]] at the [[Horde Base Camp]] on the [[Lost Isles]].
*[[Field Journal]] (provided)

==Description==
I hate to ask you to do this, but I guess it's why they pay you the big bucks. Can you deliver that [[Dead Orc Scout|dead orc]]'s journal to whoever is in charge up at their camp?

Based on the writing in the book, they should be located at the top of the island, up the incline past the [[Kaja'mite Cavern]] to the southeast.

Good luck, <name>. I always liked you.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Salvaged Bracers
|Sailor's Leggings
|Orcish Scout Boots
|Sailor's Legguards
}}

You will also receive:
* 30 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]
* +10 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
<The [[orc]] narrows her eyes at you.>

You must have been on that [[goblin]] slave ship that was sunk. What's that you have in your hand?

==Completion==
<The orc makes a move to grab the field journal from you, but then stops herself, exhaling deeply.>

I apologize, it has been a very rough couple of days for all of us.

I am Aggra. All of us here are what remains of the crew of the ''[[Draka's Fury]]''.

Perhaps we can work together. We have a common enemy in the [[Alliance]]. Their [[SI:7]] assassins are all over this island and they're not going to stop until we're all dead.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Sassy Hardwrench|We need some new friends if we're going to survive all of this. Hopefully, the orcs won't just kill you on sight.}}
