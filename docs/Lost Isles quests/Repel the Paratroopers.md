== Objectives ==
Slay 15 Alliance Paratroopers
*[[Alliance Paratrooper]] slain x15

== Description ==
The Alliance have caught back up with us at just the wrong moment, my friend. We took care of their ships, but they still have planes that are dropping their vaunted 127th Paratroopers onto the coast below.

It's all that the battlesworn and scouts can do to hold the two ramps against their overwhelming numbers. I'm certain that if you were to aid them, the tide would be quickly turned.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3|50}}
* 625 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]
* +250 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Progress ==
There are yet more Alliance paratroopers that need to be dispatched if we're to get about the business of escaping from this island, <name>.

== Completion ==
I've not seen a finer display of <class> prowess.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Heads of the SI:7]] and [[Mine Disposal, the Goblin Way]] before heading out.

==Progression==
