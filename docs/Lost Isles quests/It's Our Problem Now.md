==Objectives==
Slay 6 Teraptor Hatchlings.
*[[Teraptor Hatchling]] slain (6)

==Description==
Looks like [[Bomb-Throwing Monkey|those monkeys]] will steal anything! Those thieving little monsters have driven the [[Teraptor Matriarch|teraptor matriarch]] into a frenzy by stealing her eggs. Worse yet, the eggs have started to hatch! We've got hungry teraptor hatchlings running around all over the place, looking to make a quick meal out of us!

We didn't start this, but it's our problem now. You'll have to head into the jungle and kill those hungry teraptor hatchlings before they kill us all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|75}}
*480 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
What are you gonna do when Maxx Avalanche comes down on you, <name>?! How's the hatchling hunting coming?

==Completion==
Let's just hope we don't have to deal with their mommy later. That would be very bad.
