Find {{NPC||Kilag Gorefang}} and his scouts at the [[Wild Overlook]] on the [[Lost Isles]].

Kilag should be in position by now. It is time for you to move forward to the Wild Overlook. The rest of us will pack up here and move out soon.

Just follow the path north through the [[Vicious Vale]]. Not so vicious any longer thanks to you, eh?

Kilag and his scouts will be keeping themselves hidden just off the path, but the [[SI:7]] assassins are sure to spot them soon, so hurry!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*70 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]
*+10 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Completion ==
Throm-Ka, <name>. We have a problem.

== Notes ==
Follow the path through the Vicious Vale up to the Savage Glen and the Wild Overlook.
