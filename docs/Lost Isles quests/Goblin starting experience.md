# Goblin starting experience

The '''goblin starting experience''' takes place on the instanced isle of [[Kezan (starting zone)|Kezan]] and later the [[Lost Isles]]. 

After [[Victory!]], players leave the instance and report to [[Garrosh Hellscream]] in [[Orgrimmar]] before being sent to [[Azshara]] to start the [[Azshara storyline]].

==Kezan==
[[File:WorldMap-Kezan.jpg|thumb|Kezan zone map]]
In [[Kezan (starting zone)|Kezan]], [[Goblin (playable)|goblin players]] begin the quest chain as they have been promoted within the [[Kajaro Trading Company]] and are hosting a party to celebrate that promotion. Before the party can get under way, however, they have some last-minute preparations to take care of, ranging from [[Trouble in the Mines|improving the morale of their lazy workers]] to [[The New You|buying a snazzy outfit for the party]]. Just before the party starts, at the end of [[Fourth and Goal]], the monstrous [[Black Dragon|dragon]] [[Deathwing]] attacks Kezan and starts the eruption of the volcano on the island. In [[Pirate Party Crashers]], the infamous [[Trade Prince Gallywix]] crashes the player's promotion party and informs them that the island is going to be destroyed. He offers them a place on his yacht for the low price of a gazillion macaroons. The remainder of the quest chain is spent collecting macaroons from various sources, culminating in the destruction of the [[KTC Headquarters]] to [[447|collect on the insurance]]. However upon reaching the yacht, Gallywix reveals his true plan - he has caged all the Goblins of Kezan and is planning to sell them as slaves!
{{Kezan quests}}

==Lost Isles==
As Gallywix's yacht is sailing for [[Kalimdor]], where he will sell his Goblin prisoners, it enters into a firefight between an [[Alliance]] fleet and a lone [[Horde]] ship. To eliminate any witnesses, the Alliance fleet opens fire on the yacht, sinking it and releasing the Goblin prisoners in the process.

===First Island===
[[File:WorldMap-TheLostIsles.jpg|thumb|Lost Isles zone map]]
The surviving Goblins wash up on the [[Lost Isles]] and players immediately set about rescuing Goblins and setting up a camp on the islands. Monkeys attack the survivors and the Goblins [[Orcs Can Write?|soon discover]] that they are not alone on the island - the survivors of the Horde ship were also washed up here. Players venture into the jungle in search of the Horde survivors and find an [[Orc]] encampment led by [[Aggra]]. After helping Aggra, she asks players to help her Orcs retrieve some "precious cargo" that is onboard the Alliance ships. In the quest [[Precious Cargo]], players learn that the cargo in question is in fact the former warchief [[Thrall]]. Rescuing him, he calls on the elements to destroy the Alliance fleet and reunites players with the rest of the Goblins, who have decided to move camp.

===Town-In-A-Box===
[[File:WorldMap-TheLostIsles_terrain1.jpg|thumb|After "It's A Town-In-A-Box"]]
The Goblins' new camp is on the larger Island within the Lost Isles. While players were rescuing Thrall, the Goblins found a Town-in-a-Box in the remains of their yacht and they set it up in [[It's a Town-In-A-Box]]. After helping [[Hobart Grapplehammer]] collect food for the town, players are redirected to [[Megs Dreadshredder]] who has found a new threat to the Goblins in the nearby [[Ruins of Vashj'elan]]. These ruins are infested by [[Naga]] and players are given various tasks to try to eliminate the Naga threat. However it is soon revealed that the Naga are being controlled by a [[Faceless One]] known as the [[Faceless of the Deep]] and once players defeat him, the Naga become neutral to the Goblins.

===Pygmy mayhem===
[[File:WorldMap-TheLostIsles_terrain2.jpg|thumb|After "Volcanoth!"]]
On returning to the Town-in-a-Box, it is embroiled in a war with hundreds of small dwarf-like creatures known as [[Pygmy|Pygmies]]. The Pygmies are attacking the town and taking Goblins back to [[Oomlot Village]]. After repelling the attack, players are sent to Oomlot Village to rescue as many prisoners as possible, and to kill the Pygmy Chief [[Yngwie]]. After taking him out, players discover that the Pygmies are transforming Goblins into zombies up on top of the volcano, and players go up there and eliminate the zombie Goblins as well as the pygmy shamans conducting the rituals. Finally players travel into the volcano itself to destroy the Pygmies' god [[Volcanoth]], causing yet another volcanic eruption. Luckily [[Sassy Hardwrench]] saves them just in time and brings them to [[Warchief's Lookout]].

===Warchief's Lookout===
In Warchief's Lookout, players are reunited with Thrall and Aggra who are at war with the remaining Alliance forces. After eliminating these forces, Thrall informs players that the remaining Goblins were recaptured by Trade Prince Gallywix and put to work in a new facility known as the [[Gallywix Labor Mine]]. Players head out and rescue the Goblins from the mine, then they work together with Thrall's forces to launch an assault on Trade Prince Gallywix's base at the [[Gallywix Docks]]. After defeating Trade Prince Gallywix in [[Final Confrontation]], Thrall forces Gallywix to ally the Bilgewater Cartel with the Horde and sends players to Orgrimmar to meet with the warchief.
{{Warchief's Lookout}}

From that point on, goblin players are pointed to the [[Azshara storyline]].
