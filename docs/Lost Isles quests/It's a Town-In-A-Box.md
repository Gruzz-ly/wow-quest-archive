== Objectives ==
Climb to the top of the mountain of explosives and use the [[Town-In-A-Box]] Plunger.
*Town-In-A-Box Set Off!

== Description ==
The trade prince had an entire town-in-a-box in the ship's hold! I managed to recover it while you were out saving all of our skins.

Do you want to do the honors? All you have to do is climb to the top of that huge pile of explosives and push the plunger, and whamo kablamo, instant town!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*70 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

== Completion ==
<cough, cough!>

Hey! Where's the dock?! Someone stole the [[Gallywix Docks|dock]] and the [[KTC Oil Platform|oil refinery]] from our town-in-a-box!

Who would do such a thing?

Where's the Trade Prince?

== Notes ==
Set off the pile of explosives and get launched a good mile or two up in the air. Thankfully, a parachute will save the player from sudden deceleration-induced liquification.
