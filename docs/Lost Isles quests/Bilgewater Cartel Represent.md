==Objectives==
Destroy 12 Naga Banners, replacing them with Bilgewater Cartel Banners.
*[[Naga Banner]]s Replaced (12)

==Description==
Looks like the naga down there in [[Ruins of Vashj'elan|the ruins]] are preparing to invade our [[Town-In-A-Box (Lost Isles)|Town-In-A-Box]]. I have lots of dead scouts here as proof.

I don't know about you, but I'm not about to let them try. Let's get the jump on them!

Could you lay down the foundation for our new coastal holdings by replacing their banners with our own? That's some prime real estate down there!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Snake Plate Belt|Banner Cloak}}

You also will receive:
*{{cost||2|25}}
* 525 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
There are still some naga banners down there that need to be 'sploded and replaced!

==Completion==
I wish I could have seen the looks on their scaly faces when you blew up their banners and replaced them with our own.

On second thought, I don't want to be close enough to see their snarls.

==Notes==

:{{Text|yell|Megs Dreadshredder|You hear that, naga? <name> is on <his/her> way to settle our "negotiations"!}}

There are plenty on the other side of the ruins closer to the water.
