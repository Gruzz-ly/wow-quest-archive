==Objectives==
Rip the Still-Beating Heart from out of [[Chip Endale]]'s chest.
* [[Still-Beating Heart]]

==Description==
Oh, <man/girl>! You're never going to guess who's out on the [[KTC Oil Platform|oil platform]] to the north.

<Izzy shakes her head sadly at you.>

Chip's out there, and he's working for the [[Trade Prince Gallywix|Trade Prince]]. That cold-hearted snake dropped you like a bad habit and now he's working for the other team. I even heard he's even got something goin' on with [[Candy Cane]]!

I don't know about you, but if he was my former definitely-real boyfriend, I'd rip his still-beating heart out of his chest.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Cardio-Extractor Handguards
|Chip's Cloak
|Cardio-Extractor Gloves
|Heartache Dagger
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||1|10}}
* 250 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
What did you decide? Death or forgiveness?

==Completion==
He got just what he deserved. There, there, don't cry. You'll find someone else that'll help you grow your brand. 

Here, let me take that... we wouldn't want people to think that you're crazy.

==Progression==
{{Warchief's Lookout}}

==Trivia==
The title of the quest is a play on the old adage "The fastest way to a man's heart is through his stomach"(i.e.: feed a person to earn their affection). More humorous or cynical works often amend it to the far more literal "...through the rib cage". Whether your character ever tried the first way with Chip is unknown, but in this case she certainly chooses the latter.

==Patch changes==
