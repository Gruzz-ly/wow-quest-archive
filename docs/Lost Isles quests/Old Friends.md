== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Thrall}} at the [[Warchief's Lookout]] on the Lost Isles.

== Description ==
Alright, then, grab onto the ladder. We gotta get outa here!

We'll make a flyby of [[Town-In-A-Box (Lost Isles)|the town]], and then I'm gonna get you to some old friends!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*85 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]
*+10 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Completion ==
I told you we would meet again, <name>.

<The Warchief gives you an appraising look.>

Unfortunate that it's under such dire circumstances.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|yell|Sassy Hardwrench|Hang on, <name>! We have to get you out of here, NOW!}}
:''Sassy flies out of the big lava tube toward [[Oomlot]]. Suddenly, the volcano starts exploding!''
:{{text|yell|Sassy Hardwrench|OH MY GOSH! BEHIND YOU!!!}}
:{{text|yell|Sassy Hardwrench|WE'RE ON FIRE!}}
:''Reaching the mouth of the lava tube''
:{{text|yell|Sassy Hardwrench|YEEEEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAAAA!!!}}
:''Later...''
:{{text|yell|Sassy Hardwrench|We're coming up on the Town-In-A-Box now...}}
:''The town is destroyed -- taken out by a lava flow. Sassy loops around over the Dire Strait to make another pass over town''
:{{text|yell|Sassy Hardwrench|Get in the back seat. We're getting out of here. I know where our old friends, the orcs, are!}}
:''Flying over the path the player used to get up in to the caldera, which is now a massive lava field:''
:{{text|yell|Sassy Hardwrench|First Kezan and now here. We are toast if we don't find a way off of this island soon!}}

Thrall, before concluding the quest, says:
:Your friends were all taken prisoner by {{NPC||Trade Prince Gallywix}} while the volcano was exploding.
:We are going to have to deal with the Alliance quickly if we're to rescue them and get off of this island.
