== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Megs Dreadshredder}} at the western entrance to the [[Ruins of Vashj'elan]] on the [[Lost Isles]].

== Description ==
Your work here is done for now, but there's no rest for the wicked, eh?

You remember Megs Darkshredder, our old marketing rep? She's taken some others over the hills to the southeast, just past the [[Raptor Rise]]. If you follow the path east out of town and follow it south at the fork, you can't miss her.

Apparently there's some trouble or other brewing with the [[naga|snake-men]] at the ruins on the shore. Go see if you can't sort it all out, would you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 70 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Completion ==
Boss, we gotta problem.

== Notes ==

:{{text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|The marketing research Megs has conducted suggests that a [[naga]] invasion is imminent!}}

;Ace
:Heya, <name>. I'm sure glad that you're here. This is turning into a mess.

;Brett
:I'm glad you're out here with us, <name>. It's not easy getting stuff from [[naga]]!
