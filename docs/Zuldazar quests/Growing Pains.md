==Objectives==
Feed the Direhorn Growth Hormone to your [[Direhorn Hatchling|hatchling]].
* Hatchling Fed DGH
* [[Direhorn Growth Hormone]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Zandalari troll|These trolls]] are missing a real opportunity here! They complain about not having enough beasts to go around, yet have they really tried to mass produce them? Nope!

With my Direhorn Growth Hormone, they'll be able to fill these pens to overflowing! Sure, the overcrowding might lead to disease and excess waste issues, but I'm sure those are solvable.

Ha ha ha this is gonna be great!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|98|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well? Did your hatchling try the DGH yet?

==Completion==
Wow! That worked even better than I thought! I'm gonna make a fortune!
