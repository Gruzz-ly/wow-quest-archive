==Objectives==
Recover 6 Naval Records from Zandalari and Mogu.
* [[Naval Records]] (6)
* [[Kelsey's Jump Boots]] (provided)

==Description==
We've got [[mogu]] and [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] working together on the [[Breath of Pa'ku]]. They've got records on the [[Golden Fleet|Zandalari fleet's]] ships.

We've been making educated guesses regarding the Zandalari fleet. It's time to upgrade our intel.

Go in there and get the naval records from anyone on board that ship.

Oh, and take these jet boots. You'll need them to reach the boat if you're planting bombs on the hull.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Did you get those naval records? We'll need them to better plan against the Zandalari.

==Completion==
Perfect! I'll get these documents back to [[Halford Wyrmbane|Halford]]. We'll be able to coordinate future attacks with this.

==Progression==
{{The Strike on Zuldazar}}

==Patch changes==
