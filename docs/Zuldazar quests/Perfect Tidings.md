==Objectives==
Use the attuned Scroll of the Missing to track and find the lost explorers.
* [[Tortollan Traveling Pack|Clue 1]] found
* [[Tortollan Scroll (object)|Clue 2]] found
* [[Tortollan Scroll Case|Clue 3]] found
* [[Scroll of Seeking]] (provided)

==Description==
Your timing is most convenient, <class>.

Our team had a check-in planned for this place, two days past. None have yet returned. 

I did not want to be brash and send word to the city too soon. However, I cannot leave this place empty, nor can I abandon young [[Koba]]. 

Take this scroll. See who, or what, you can find. Bring back those you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Completion==
Well met, neighbor! Batu must have faced such a conundrum when we did not return.

==Notes==
