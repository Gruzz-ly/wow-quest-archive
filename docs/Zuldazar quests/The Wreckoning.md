==Objectives==
Kill 10 Shipwrecked [[7th Legion]].
* 7th Legion [[Sailor]] slain (10)

==Description==
I can't believe any of them survived the wreck. We were told to prevent any survivors from gaining a foothold.

There are far more of them than expected. We need to weaken their forces.

Well? What are you waiting for? An engraved invitation?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
We have an infestation of Alliance. We've done what we can. I will need to message for reinforcements.

==Notes==
*Kill: [[7th Legion Sailor (Zuldazar)|7th Legion Sailors]], [[7th Legion Windfinder]]s, and [[Injured Shipwrecked Sailor]]s.

==Progression==
