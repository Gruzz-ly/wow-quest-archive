* Speak to [[Pa'ku]]
* Hope For Rescue

==Description==
Ahhh, it is good to see you, <name>.

How is de defective one? Still pleased to be at your side?

I have given this some thought. Fear may still be what holds your not-so-little one back, but your love is what enables him to thrive without his wings. Perhaps that love will be what restores him to de skies.

I am asking you to trust me. I wish to try something.

If I am correct then de two of you will find yourselves airborne as nature intended!

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Flying Unlocked: Kua'fon]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Trust me on this, <name>.

==Completion==
What did I tell you, child?

All he needed was de right motivation. Haha!

==Notes==
This quest will be available when [[Battle for Azeroth Pathfinder, Part Two]] has been achieved.

;Speaking with Pa'ku
:Are you prepared to place your faith in my wing-claws?

:<Pa'ku grins menacingly down at you.>

:{{Gossip|I trust you.}}
:{{Text|say|Pa'ku|You will not regret it, tiny wingless one!}}
:{{Gossip|I guess?}}
:{{Text|say|Pa'ku|Smile, it will all be over very soon. Haha!}}
:{{Gossip|Well, here goes nothing.}}
:{{Text|say|Pa'ku|Just relax and enjoy de flight!}}

Choosing any option starts a cutscene. Pa'ku throws the player from a cliff, and Kua'fon lunges to your rescue. Slowly, Kua'fon, flying, goes up with the player on his back, cheering. You are crying.

On completion, Kua'fon dives one more into the air and flies away.
