==Objectives==
Plant 4 Remote-Detonation Deathbombs beneath the [[Breath of Pa'ku]].
* [[Remote-Detonation Deathbomb|Remote-detonation deathbomb]] planted (4)

==Description==
Our first job is to plant some bombs along these ships. I'll take care of the smaller ships, you deal with the Breath of Pa'ku.

Whatever that means.

[[Kelsey Steelspark|Kelsey]] says these bombs are the latest in [[gnome technology]]. We plant 'em and she can detonate them at any time.

Let's get moving, and remember, this whole plan works as long as they don't see us plantin' these bombs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Completion==
All the bombs are planted on my end. Still wish we could blow 'em up now. 

Guess we'll have to just wait until the time is right to blow these things sky high.
