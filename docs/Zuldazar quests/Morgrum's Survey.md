==Objectives==
Check on [[Excavator Morgrum Emberflint]]'s survey equipment in the Ruins of Xibala.
* Outer ruins survey completed
* Inner ruins survey completed
* "The Foot" survey completed

==Description==
Oi. Since yer hands are already dirty, what do ye say we make a deal?

To give it to ye straight, there's a relic here called the [[:Breath of Xibala]]. I don't know who [[Xibala (devilsaur)|Xibala]] is or why the [[Alliance]] wants its breath, but there's a hefty sum of [[gold]] in it fer me if we deliver.

That means there's somethin' in it for you, too, if ye get my meanin'.

I started a survey with me equipment but haven't got me results yet. Go on out into the ruins an' give the boxes you see a little kick to hurry things along.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
I'll be countin' me own gold if ye don't want to lend a hand.

==Completion==
Don't ask questions ye don't want the answer to, <name>.

But ye did well, an' now I got what I need to track down the Breath.
