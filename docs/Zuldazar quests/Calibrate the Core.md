==Objectives==
Calibrate the [[Embiggifier]]'s core by using it on dead things within [[Bilgewater Bonanza]].
* Embiggifier Core calibrated (10)
* [[Embiggifier Core]] (provided)

==Description==
The Embiggifier is nearly ready! All that's left to do is calibrate its core.

The best way to do that without catastrophic results is to use it on things that are already dead.

This should be a simple task!

I have a hunch you excel at making things dead.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* [[Glowing Azerite]] (350x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you calibrated the core yet?

==Completion==
The calibration is complete? Splendid!

==Notes==
As the bodies will become much bigger, try to not stack the bodies all in one spot, as it will become difficult to target the ones under the enlarged corpses.

If you want, you can also click on a [[Void Tear (Zuldazar)|Void Tear]] to summon a [[void elf]] that will attack the mobs nearby and make killing a little easier.
