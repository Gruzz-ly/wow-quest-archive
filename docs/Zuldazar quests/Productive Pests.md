==Objectives==
Gather 5 bugs
* Bugs collected  (5)

==Description==
This jungle is a whole new habitat for creatures and critters. A shame we're here to deal with [[Alliance]] driftwood.

I've got an idea and I think it's genius. Two words: Poison bugs.

First, I need some bugs. Crawling and flying ones, just to be thorough for our test.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
These are going to be great!

==Notes==
*Kill: [[Mosquito]] and [[Sand Borer]]s.
