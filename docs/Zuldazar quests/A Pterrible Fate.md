==Objectives==
Ask [[Pa'ku]] for help.

==Description==
<[[Kua'fon]] peers longingly toward the horizon and gives a keening cry.

You can take the [[pterrordax]] from the sky, but not the sky from the pterrordax. It's time to do something.

Perhaps Pa'ku could offer some advice.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,790 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is good that you came to me. I was considering throwing the thing off the roost again.

Perhaps there is another way.
