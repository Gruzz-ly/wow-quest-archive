==Objectives==
Help [[Jazz Mokkitz|Jazz]] tinker with his shrink ray and kaja'mite.
* Toss Jazz [[Worn Spanner|his spanner]]
* Toss Jazz some [[Scattered Bolt|bolts]] (3)
* Bring Jazz [[Refined Kaja'mite Crystal|a Kaja'mite Crystal]]
* Bring Jazz his spanner
* Hold [[Jazz's Shrink Ray|the Shrink Ray]]

==Description==
Alright, <name>, time for this to get serious. You got the crystals, and I've got our parts to work with!

Kaja'mite is good for containin' volatile energy. I think we can do better than Darkfuse weaponry, but first, we need a proof of concept.

I've got this old, glitchy, junk shrink ray. The kaja'mite should stabilize it. If it does, we've got a potential breakthrough!

I need an extra set of hands to tinker on this thing. Just follow my instructions and you'll stay in one piece. Probably.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Completion==
Well, we're both still intact. The shrink ray isn't destroyed. I'm calling this a wild success!

Imagine it, <name>, this shrink ray could help pack supplies more efficiently into vehicles. We could transport more people in the same amount of space as before! I can't wait to tell my wife.

<Jazz coughs.>

Sorry, I got carried away. Ya did great, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Alrighty, time to crack this thing open and gut it!}}
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Pass me that spanner?}}

Jazz also has new gossip:
{{dialogue|That hunk o' rock had one wicked uppercut, <name>. I'm honestly impressed. 

Maybe I should take notes. How does a rocket drill-shredder hybrid sound?}}

Toss the [[Worn Spanner]] to him:
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Alright, let's see what I can do...}}
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Oh blast--I should've known it'd go haywire once I pulled it apart!}}
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Quick, toss me those bolts!}}

Balls of lightning start flying out, and seven [[Scattered Bolt]]s light up. Toss three of them:
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Now bring over that crystal, we can contain this!}}

On the hill above him is a [[Refined Kaja'mite Crystal]]. Walk it to him:
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Almost there! Bring my spanner over!}}

The Worn Spanner lights up again. Walk it back too:
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Hold the shrink ray down while I lock the kaja'mite in place.}}

Interact with [[:Jazz's Shrink Ray]]:
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Done! Phew--that was a doozy.}}
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Got any name ideas, <name>? Something catchy.}}
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|The "Kaja'compactor?" Too many syllables. I'll workshop it.}}
