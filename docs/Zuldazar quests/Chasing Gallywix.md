==Objectives==
Find and chase [[Jastor Gallywix|Trade Prince Gallywix]].
* Gallywix found {{co|40.4|44.0|Zuldazar}}
* [[Gallywix's Personal Teleporter]] used

==Description==
Look at this... The [[goblin]]s are looting ancient ornamentation like they're hoarding food at a buffet. What a disgrace.

But we do not have time to get bogged down in everything happening here. Gallywix will soon know that we have arrived.

We should not hesitate in ascending these stairs and locating Gallywix. I am certain that he will be wherever the thieves are carrying their treasure.

Oh, and please do take care. The [[Zandalari]] do not typically leave places like this unguarded.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Completion==
A "[[Gallywix Pleasure Palace|pleasure palace]]?" What sort of selfish leader fritters away his people's lives and fortunes in this way?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Magister Umbric|The Alliance is counting on the void elves. We will not disappoint.}}

Kill a path south, upstairs. Gallywix is standing atop a chest made of gold:
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|I want all this gold back to the palace ASAP and then-}}
:{{text|yell|Trade Prince Gallywix|Outta my way! The Alliance is here!}}
:{{text|yell|Trade Prince Gallywix|No delays! No excuses! No promotions!}}
:''Jastor and [[Gallywix's Hobgoblin]] take the teleporter to [[Gallywix Pleasure Palace]] in [[Azshara]].''

Follow them.
