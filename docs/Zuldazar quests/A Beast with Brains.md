==Objectives==
Find [[Grong]] within [[Gorilla Gorge]].

==Description==
For optimal results, the [[Embiggifier]] should be used on someone with substantial intellect.

Good thing our partner is as smart as they come.

He and his kind have been empowered by [[kaja'mite]], granting them exceptional intelligence!

Head up to the gorge and let Grong know we're ready to begin the embiggifying!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,930 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So the time has finally come!

I have been awaiting this day--the day my ideas would be brought to life!

But first, I must see that the gorge will be safe after my departure.
