==Objectives==
Accompany Grong to Xibala.
* Accompany [[Grong]] to [[Xibala]]

==Description==
Ever since the [[kaja'mite]] began bubbling around the gorge, I have been searching for meaning. Why was I burdened with intelligence? What is my purpose?

I have found my answers in the [[Embiggifier]].

I was meant to help the [[Alliance]] defeat the [[Horde]].

If I can save lives by volunteering, then my choice is clear.

The needs of the many outweigh the needs of one.

I am ready, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* [[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (500x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Have you found Grong yet?

==Completion==
You don't disappoint, <name>. [[Grong]] is the answer to all our problems.

I'll just need him to sign a few dozen documents before we get started. All standard stuff, I assure you.

==Notes==

:{{text|say|Da'kani Highbrow|For Grong!}}
: ''He runs out of the grotto and stuns any [[goblin]]s in his path. He talks while leaping down ledges.''
:{{text|say|Grong|I know what you must be thinking. Why would any otherwise intelligent beast choose this path for himself?}}
:{{text|say|Grong|When I heard the gnomes were planning a move against the Horde, I knew I needed to lend my aid.}}
:{{text|say|Grong|Their device was rudimentary at first, barely able to double the target's size.}}
:{{text|say|Grong|With my help, the embiggifier now converts intelligence into brute strength.}}
:{{text|say|Grong|Being the smartest of my kind, it made sense to be the volunteer.}}
:{{text|say|Grong|It is not without risk, however.}}
:{{text|say|Grong|The likelihood that my sharp wit will lose its edge is high.}}
:{{text|say|Grong|But as long as I keep this handsome face, should I really care?}}
:{{text|say|Grong|I use humor to mask my anxiety.}}
:{{text|say|Grong|Between friends, I am a little nervous.}}
:{{text|say|Grong|Mostly I worry I won't be good enough.}}
:{{text|say|Grong|I want to exceed everyone's expectations.}}
:{{text|say|Grong|But we're in this together, <name>, right? You won't let me fail.}}
:{{text|say|Grong|I want to become so colossal that the Horde trembles in fear at the sight of me!}}
:{{text|say|Grong|Whatever the cost, it will be worth it to see the Horde pay for what they have done.}}
:{{text|say|Grong|I know the risks, <name>. And I accept them.}}
:{{text|say|Grong|I am ready to become a weapon of the Alliance.}}

At Xibala you are dismounted but Grong has gossip you can peruse.

: This is my destiny, <name>.

* {{gossip|Are you sure you want to do this?}}
:: As sure as I've ever been about anything.

:: If I can help, I must help.

:: Don't waste your worry on me. I am prepared for what will come.

:: You should prepare yourself, too.

* {{gossip|What is kaja'mite?}}
:: Plainly speaking, kaja'mite is an ore with remarkable properties and a sordid history.

:: When first discovered, it was used upon test subjects to determine its usefulness.

:: The results of these questionable studies showed a steady increase in intelligence when consumed, followed by a marked decline when removed from the diet.
