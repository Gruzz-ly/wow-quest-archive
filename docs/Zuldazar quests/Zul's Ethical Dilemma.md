==Objectives==
Free 9 Mindslaves.
* Mindslaves freed (9)
* [[Mindbreaker Chant]] (provided)

==Description==
Hm.

De [[Gurubashi tribe|Gurubashi]] have earned a reputation for betrayal and weakness. Their activities in [[Zul'Gurub]] will be a stain on our records for generations to come.

On de other hand...

De [[Zandalari]] are above de use of [[slave]]s. We are strong, capable. De very existence of mindslaves in [[Zuldazar|dis great city]] is insulting.

Dere is a chant dat will free their minds. Use it near de mindslaves to free dem.

Or you can simply kill dem. It makes no difference to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
Weakness or pride... I think often on the Zandalari's priorities.

==Notes==
Either kill or use the quest item on [[Mindslaved Gurubashi]] and [[Mindslaved Berserker]]s.
