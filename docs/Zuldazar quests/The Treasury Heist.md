==Objectives==
Retrieve the Abyssal Scepter from the Zandalari Treasury.
* Speak with [[Jaina Proudmoore]]
* Lady Jaina Proudmoore slain
* Retrieve the [[:Abyssal Scepter]] from the [[Zandalari Treasury]].

==Description==
The Abyssal Scepter is a powerful [[tidesage]] artifact and a serious threat to the [[fleet]]. The [[Horde]] stole it, but it is being held by the [[Zandalari]] in their treasury.

The [[Storm's Wake]] has crafted a fake Scepter. Your first job is to obtain the real one without alerting suspicion.

Speak to me when you are ready to go over the plan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 26,800 [[XP]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Core]] (750x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Were you successful?

==Completion==
Mission accomplished on all fronts, it seems. I will ensure that the [[Gelbin Mekkatorque|High Tinker]] gets the data you collected.

I remember hearing stories of the Abyssal Scepter when I was young. Aside from being a tactical victory, it is good to have this relic back in our hands. Thank you.

==Criteria of==
*[[Tides of Vengeance (achievement)]]

==Notes==
;Speaking with Jaina
{{Gossip|What's the plan, Lord Admiral?}}

:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|The treasury is well protected, but Magister Umbric and I have a way to get the team inside without setting off any alarms.}}
:{{Text|say|Magister Umbric|We can call upon the [[Void]] to conceal the [[magic]] Lady Jaina will use to open the portal. We believe we have eliminated any potential... side effects.}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|By "side effects," do you mean the shadowy [[tentacle]]s or the descent into madness? Asking for a friend.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|This is a serious mission, Fairwind.}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|I am being serious. Have you met my friends? Madness might be an improvement. And the tentacles, in some cases.}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Say, are we allowed to make any additional withdrawals from the treasury?}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Captain Fairwind--}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Magister, I think we're ready to get underway.}}
:{{Text|say|Magister Umbric|Give me a moment to shroud our actions from their wards... I have it.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|It will take a moment to find the path through....Ah, there it is. Good luck!}}
:''The [[Entrance Portal]] is opened. Mathias and Flynn enter it.''

Click on the portal to start the scenario.

===Scenario: The Treasury Heist===
====Stage 1 – A Simple Plan====
*Description: Secure the exit.
*Golem destroyed

The player, Mathias and Flynn are transported into the Zandalari Treasury.

:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|We proceed quickly and quietly. Emphasis on quietly.}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|You won't even know I'm here.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|And we don't. Touch. Anything. Do you understand, Captain?}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|You're coming in loud and clear, mate. How about- Wait...}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Did.. Did that golem just move?}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|I think you might be right, Captain. <Name>, we should check it out.}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Yep! Definitely moving!}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Take it down!}}

Kill the [[Treasury Protector]].

====Stage 2 – Mission: Probable====
*Description: Proceed further into the treasury.
*Traps disabled (3)
*End of the hall reached

:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|So much for quietly.}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Well, this is going to be an exciting trip.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|This area is secure... for now. We should move quickly.}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Look at this obviously safe room. We should just run right in!}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|There is lightning on the floor and fire in the hallway after this, Fairwind.}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Sarcasm? What's that?}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|There's probably a control switch.  <Name>, can you see one?}}

Unlock the [[Security Door]] and avoid the lightning on the ground. Reach the [[Control Switch]].

:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|That creepy-looking gold mask looks like it might trap-related, <name>.}}

After activating the switch, Mathias and Flynn continue, and [[Baleful Guardian Spirit]]s attack you.

:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Behind you!}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|We've got your back, <name>!}}

Interact with the next Security Door.

:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|There's probably another switch on the other side of this room.}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|I hope you're right, mate. I can't see a blasted thing from here.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|<Name> see if you can find the control. Captain Flynn and I will watch your back.}}

Continue down the hall and avoid Flame Jets. Disable another Control Switch.

:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Who the blazes designs this stuff, anyway?}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Don't get me wrong, they're getting points for style, but isn't this a bit complicated?}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Imagine having to navigate flaming doom every time you wanted to grab some [[Anchor Weed|anchor weed]] from your deposit box.}}

Flynn and Mathias join you. Click on the next Security Door and continue. Avoid the Zandalari statue and interact with the last Control Switch, deactivating the statue. Proceed through the Security Door.

====Stage 3 – Take the Shortcut====
*Description: Head towards the central chamber.
*Head towards the central chamber.

Two Treasury Protectors and a [[Furious Guardian Spirit]] and a [[Mighty Guardian Spirit]] attack.

:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Hmm... Two exits from this room.}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Hang on a second, we should head through this way.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Towards the piles of gold and obvious riches just pouring into the treasury?}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Well, yeah! If the Scepter is that valuable, it'd be in there, right? Let's go!}}

Continue with Mathias and Fairwind to another Security Door and kill another Treasury Protectors, after which open the Security Door.

====Stage 4 – Nevermind====
*Description: Return to the outer hallway.
*Return to outer hallway

:''As the group proceeds to the center of the treasury, Opulence appears there.''
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|STOP!}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|What are you- Oh... That's... Not something I expected.}}

Return back.

====Stage 5 – The Bigger They Are...====
*Description: Defeat the Treasury Sentinel.
*[[Treasury Sentinel]] defeated

:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Well that's a big problem.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Quit the chatter and help us take it down, Fairwind!}}

====Stage 6 – The Search Continues====
*Description: Proceed further into the treasury.
*Traps disabled

Open the Security Door.

:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Right. The floor is lightning.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Fewer quips, more focus, Captain.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|<Name>, I think I see another control switch across the way.}}

Avoid traps and interact with Control Switch.

:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Lovely! More fire. I guess they're not keeping any flammable valuables in those vaults.}}

Proceed with the same procedure.

:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Security is starting to get a wee bit serious. Almost as serious as Master Shaw is.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|<Sigh> <name>, I wouldn't touch those beams. They're probably deadly.}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|I think there are two of those animated statues, but none of those creepy floating masks. At least not yet.}}

Do the same thing but avoid the lasers as they instantly kill you.

====Stage 7 – Masking For Trouble====
*Description: Defeat the Treasury Guardians.
*Spirits defeated (5)

A Furious Guardian Spirit and a Mighty Guardian Spirit appear, followed by Baleful Guardian Spirits.

====Stage 8 – More Traps? Seriously?====
*Description: Run the gauntlet.
*Disable the gauntlet

Avoid the statue hits and lasers. New obstacle involves a [[Pa'ku]] statue casting wind. At the end of the hall, interact with the Control Switch.

====Stage 9 – Protection Detail====
*Description: Protect Shaw while he disables the traps.
*Shaw protected

;Speaking with Shaw
We need to move quickly and quietly.

{{Gossip|You get rid of those security features, we'll watch your back.}}

:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Hold them off while I work.}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Don't worry, you can count on us!}}

Treasury Protectors appear.

:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|How's it going back there? Almost done?}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|It's a complicated mechanism. Disabling it requires patience and finesse.}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Finesse a bit faster!}}

Baleful Guardian Spirits appear.

:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|You need any help? Tips? I've disabled a few traps before.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Are a few mystical masks too much for the infamous Flynn Fairwind?}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|While your concern is touching, it'll take more than a few creepy masks and angry stone golems to get the best of me.}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Come to think of it, an angry stone golem sounds like my last ex.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Can we stay focused? I'm almost done with the last set of traps.}}

Furious Guardian Spirits and a [[Treasury Defender]] appear.

====Final Stage – Make the Swap.====
*Description: Consult with Mathias Shaw.
*Speak with Mathias Shaw

:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|One more... Got it! The last trap is disarmed. Hmmm. Passable work, Fairwind.}}

;Speaking with Mathias
I have the fake scepter here. I think you should be the one to do the honors. Flynn and I will cover your back this time.

{{Gossip|<Take the fake scepter to make the swap.}}

A scene plays.

:The player takes the scepter and swaps it with the fake one.
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Careful...}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Don't worry. They've got this.}}
:Opulence appears and chases the group as they jump through the [[Exit Portal]].
:{{Text|say|Master Mathias Shaw|Now do we worry?}}
:{{Text|say|Flynn Fairwind|Nope, nope. Now, we run.}}

You are back in Xibala. Turn in with Jaina.
