*{{text|say|Scrollsage Nola|Splendid job! You know, if this adventuring business doesn't work out, you'd make an excellent school teacher.}}

==Notes==
Nola appears in one of six locations, and asks you to draw a shape on the ground. The specific shape depends on the location and the player's faction.

{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|
Before a young tortollan can inscribe their first scroll, they need to practice their basic shapes. Can you show these little ones how it's done?

*{{Gossip|I am ready.}}
*{{Gossip|Let me try again.}} ''(If you fail at first)''
*{{Gossip|I'll come back later.}}
}}

*Circle: [[Vigil Hill]] in [[Tiragarde Sound]] or [[Zo'bal Ruins]] in [[Nazmir]]
*Square: [[Fallhaven]] in [[Drustvar]] or [[Terrace of the Devoted]] in [[Vol'dun]]
*Triangle: [[Fort Daelin]] in [[Stormsong Valley]] or [[Mugambala|The Mugambala]] in [[Zuldazar]]

An outline will be shown on the ground for a brief moment, and you must run along the outline as close as possible to complete the shape.

If you fail:
*{{text|say|Scrollsage Nola|Hmm. I've seen worse... but I'm sure you can do better.}}
*{{text|say|Scrollsage Nola|Oh, no no no. That's not setting a good example for the young ones!}}

Speak to Nola again and ask to try again.
