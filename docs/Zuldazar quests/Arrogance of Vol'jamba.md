* [[Eyes of Vol'jamba]] blinded
* [[Spite of Vol'jamba]] thwarted

==Description==
Vol'jamba thinks his [[Sight]] has surpassed mine. I warned against such arrogance many years ago, but we see how well he listened.

<Zul chuckles.>

No doubt he will attempt to deter us as we encroach upon his sanctum. Listen if you like, but remember dat he is desperate to save himself. His truth is distorted by fear.

Destroy his masks and we will walk unharmed through dis passage.

As I said, his truth is distorted by fear.
