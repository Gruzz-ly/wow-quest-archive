==Objectives==
Collect 50 Xibalan fossil fragments.
* [[Xibalan Fossil Fragment]] (50)
* [[Sweeper Beacon]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Tae'shara Bloodwatcher|Miss Tae'shara]] and I share a passion for uncovering hidden secrets and a deep, abiding respect for this ancient land.

That said! If we were to continue at the pace to which she is accustomed, the [[Alliance]] would overtake us before we could make a single discovery.

It is time to expedite our survey.

The ruins hide many fossils. Take a beacon and use it to summon one of my sweepers. It will clear away the topsoil and allow you to collect samples.

Gather what you can- we can assemble them later.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
I simply see no reason to dirty our hands, <name>.

==Completion==
Hm. These are a little... broken, don't you think?

Ah, well, nothing a little magic cannot fix.

==Notes==
Use the quest item near the [[Dirt Pile]]s to summon a [[Carefully Calibrated Sweeper]] that exposes [[Xibalan Fossil]]s.

==Progression==
{{Xibala Horde}}
