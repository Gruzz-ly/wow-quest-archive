==Objectives==
Slay Summoner Siavass and the Whispering Horror.
* [[Summoner Siavass]] slain
* [[Whispering Horror]] slain

==Description==
Those witches dare! In my temple? 

Siavass is stretching past the realm of that which she can comprehend. There is a darkness seeking them, and they call to it! Her kind will become no more than a hollow tool to those who may answer.

I feel it moving beneath us, around us. I feel it like a tremor through my being. 

There is a pressure there, it has a weight greater than that of the deepest ocean. 

We must stop them. They are not welcome here!

(Summoner Slavass: An opportunist with dark ambitions.)
