==Objectives==
Meet [[Bladeguard Sonji]] at [[Sandscar Breach]].

==Description==
I heard some mutterings about sand and [[snake]]s.

The plea comes from a tiny [[village]] on the very fringes of [[Zuldazar]]- hardly more than a few farms. Dol-something I think it was called. Don't know what they be calling it now. Go see what the fuss is about.

Bladeguard Sonji was sent ahead some time ago. She should be able to get you up to speed on that... situation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Completion==
[[Rastakhan]] finally sent someone!

I hope you not be afraid of snakes, mon.

==Progression==
