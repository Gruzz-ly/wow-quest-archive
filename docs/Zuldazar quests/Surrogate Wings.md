==Objectives==
Acquire a Huge Dragon Kite.
* [[Huge Dragon Kite]]

==Description==
It is not my way to coddle the young of my brood. But I think I will make an exception for your little one.

After all, I have seen you tend to him. It would be cruel to let your... efforts... go to waste.

Venture into [[Zuldazar]] city proper and find something that can act as a surrogate wing for your young one.

[[Wingminder Goja]] will know what to do next. Speak to him once you have it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
Did [[Pa'ku]] offer any useful advice?

==Completion==
What is this?

<Wingminder Goja looks between you and the pterrordax and grins.>

Oh, I get it!

==Notes==
Huge Dragon Kite is bought by [[Elly Fraze]] in [[Grand Bazaar]].

==Progression==
{{How to Ptrain Your Pterrordax}}
