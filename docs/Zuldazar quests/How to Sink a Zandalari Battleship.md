==Objectives==
Go over the plan to weaken the [[Golden Fleet|Zandalari naval fleet]] with [[Halford Wyrmbane|Halford]].
* Plan discussed

==Description==
Let's go over our plan of attack, but remember above all things, the [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] cannot know our full forces are here.

If they were to discover an [[Alliance]] base within the shadow of their [[Zandalari Empire|empire]]... we would be wiped out in an instant.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,790 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let's go over the plan.

==Completion==
You know the plan, <name>. Stay hidden and weaken the Zandalari fleet. If we accomplish those two goals, we'll walk out of here alive.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Halford
{{Gossip|Let's discuss our plan to weaken the Zandalari fleet.}}
:''Halford, [[Magister Umbric]], [[Kelsey Steelspark]], [[Shandris Feathermoon]], [[John J. Keeshan]], [[Falstad Wildhammer]] (with [[Swiftwing]]) are standing in a circle.'' 
:{{Text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Let's get this out of the way. The Alliance needs our support to prepare for a full invasion of [[Zuldazar]].}}
:{{Text|say|Magister Umbric|I do not mean offense, Halford, but what you propose is a suicidal task. The Zandalari wiped out the last fleet that breached their shores.}}
:{{Text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|I agree. Shandris, Falstad and I have proposed a plan that was approved by [[Anduin Wrynn|King Wrynn]]. If we succeed, then our forces will stand a chance.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|The Zandalari are powerful, but not invincible. We are going to sabotage key locations of their harbor defenses with remote detonated bombs.}}
:{{Text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|If we get the job done right, the Zandalari won't know that we've rigged their defenses to explode.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Ah... then we wait to detonate them until the moment our [[fleet]]s arrive. The city would be in chaos, allowing us to make landfall!}}
:{{Text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Correct. <Name>, you will be our operative weakening the Zandalari's harbor defenses. Kelsey, Falstad, and Keeshan will help you with the first target.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Umbric and I will move ahead and make preparations for a stealth strike at the [[Warport Rastari|warport]].}}
:{{Text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Remember, our main goal is to hinder their defenses and keep our forces here hidden. If we are discovered, all is lost. For the Alliance!}}
:{{Text|say|Magister Umbric|I suppose this task isn't as suicidal as I once thought.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Don't let your guard down, Umbric. This is an ambitious plan. If any one thing goes wrong, many lives will be lost.}}
