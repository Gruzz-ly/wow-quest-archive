==Objectives==
Find and slay Mista Nice.
* Track down [[Scamp Nest|Lair of the Scamps]] (1)
* [[Mista Nice]] slain

==Description==
I am normally not a violent [[tortollan]], but if there is one thing I cannot abide, it is a scoundrel using [[child]]ren for his own profit.

The street scamps appear to be working at the behest of a ring leader. I do believe they call him "Mista Nice" though I suspect the name to be sarcastic in nature.

I have a scroll here that can let you move among the scamps and see if they lead you back to Mista Nice. If they do, slay him and I shall pay you a bounty.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|80|}}
* 20,550 [[XP]]
*75x [[Azerite (resource)]]
* +150 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]
* +150 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
Have you found the dastardly mastermind Mista Nice yet?

==Completion==
Excellent. One less evil troll on the streets. Of course, you can assume they will organize again soon. They always do.

==Notes==
In case you lost the disguise, return to Scrollsage Rooka.

{{Gossip|I have lost my disguise. Do you have another scroll?}}

==Progression==
{{Tortollan}}
