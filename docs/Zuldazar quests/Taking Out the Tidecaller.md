==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Tidecaller Nezara.jpg|Tidecaller Nezara|Leader of the [[Nazeshi]] [[naga]] that are invading the shores of [[Zuldazar]].}}
Kill [[Tidecaller Nezara]].
*Tidecaller Nezara slain

==Description==
Nezara's shield might be down, but that doesn't mean she's defenseless.

There's a [[Naga brute|brute]] by her side that may cause trouble. I'll take a stab at him so you can take down the Tidecaller.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|46|80}}

==Completion==
You do good work, <name>. Always a pleasure.

==Notes==
[[File:Nisha vs Nazeshi Tidebreaker.jpg|thumb|Nisha fighting the tidebreaker]]
On accept, Nisha equips a pair of [[naga]] daggers and starts following the player around.
:{{Text|say|Nisha|Let's slay that slimy [[sea witch]] and end this invasion!}}

Tidecaller Nezara can be found alongside a [[Nazeshi Tidebreaker]] in a pavilion in the southeastern part of the shallows. As soon as you engage Nezara, Nisha will jump up on the tidebreaker and start stabbing it repeatedly, allowing you to focus on the Tidecaller.
:{{Text|yell|Nisha|This one's mine! Taste my blades, tidebreaker!}}

Before long, Nisha will kill the brute and join you in finishing off Nezara.
:{{Text|say|Nisha|Who knew killing naga could be so fun?}}

Once Nezara is dead as well, talk to Nisha again to turn in.
