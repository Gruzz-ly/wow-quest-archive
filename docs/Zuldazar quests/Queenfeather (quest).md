==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Queenfeather.jpg|Queenfeather|Matriarch of the Savagemane Ravasaurs. She has been known to hunt unsuspecting handlers from Warbeast Kraal.}}
Slay [[Queenfeather]] and claim one of her feathers.
* [[Queenfeather's Plume]]

==Description==
Ah, so you are de one who inherited [[Handler Bazkoji|Bazkoji]]'s herd. What is left of it, anyway.

I know what killed him, and I tried to warn him. Queenfeather is a vicious [[ravasaur]], bigger than de rest and smarter as well. Most of de eggs around here are hers.

Usually I praise de strength of such a beast, but she has become a nuisance.

You will find her guarding her nests in de feeding grounds. Kill her and bring back one of her head feathers as proof dat de deed is done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|39|60|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
Does Queenfeather still stalk us?

==Completion==
Good. Now dat de bloodthirsty matriarch is gone, maybe we can plant one of ours back into de brood as a replacement... Hmmm.

==Progression==
{{Warbeast Kraal}}

==Patch changes==
