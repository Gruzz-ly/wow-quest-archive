==Objectives==
Get the key from [[Quartermaster Garza]].
*[[Brig Key]]

==Description==
You can tell a lot about a [[troll]] by what they do when they learn who [[Zul]] truly is. 

That Garza is a mutinous, foul-tusked, [[ship]] stealin' traitor. She is the kind of zealot dat will follow de heretic into the maw of an [[Old God]]. 

I am more de type to rip out her tusks and beat her with dem. 

I'd settle for ya taking her key and getting our [[Wavemaster Lanfa|wavemaster]] and crew free!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Zul Adherent's Band]]
* {{cost|38|80}}
* 20,550 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]
*[[Small Azerite Shard]] (100x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Did ya relieve her of de key?

==Completion==
Garza was lost long ago. It sounds that [[Bo'tzun Maset|Maset]] is as feisty as ever. We will get out to de ships!
