==Objectives==
Fly to [[Gral's Call]] on [[Swiftwing]].
* Ride Swiftwing to Gral's Call

==Description==
[[Kelsey Steelspark|Kelsey]] brought back the records you retrieved on the [[Isle of Fangs]], but it was too late.

What you see before you is Gral's Call, the missing Zandalari flagship, and they've spotted us.

If they make it back to port, we will have the full fury of the Zandalari empire brought down upon us.

We must board the ship and eliminate every Zandalari on board.

[[Falstad Wildhammer|Falstad]] will get us there. Let's move.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Completion==
We're here, and the fighting has begun. Let's hurry.
