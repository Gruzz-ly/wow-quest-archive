==Objectives==
Place 3 Scrying Vessels in [[Xibala]].
* Outer ruins scrying completed
* Inner ruins scrying completed
* "The Foot" scrying completed

==Description==
On behalf of the [[Horde]] we seek a relic called the [[Eye of Xibala]].

The locals have been no help whatsoever and [[Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher‎|Miss Tae'shara]] insists that we use her survey equipment.

I abhor guesswork. Instead we shall use a more direct method: scrying.

I will mark three locations on your map. I would like you to place a scrying vessel at each of them. I will use their measurements to isolate the relic's location and we will be on our way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
How fares the search?

==Completion==
Excellent work. Allow me to review the results and we will be on our way.

==Notes==
In the ruins find and click on Essence Collector.

;Outer ruins scrying
:{{Text|say|[[Image of Apprentice Telemancer Astrandis]]|Well this reading is not very promising.}}

;Inner ruins scrying
:{{Text|say|Image of Apprentice Telemancer Astrandis|I detect a faint [[arcane]] signature! We are getting closer.}}

;At The Foot
:{{Text|say|Image of Apprentice Telemancer Astrandis|Fascinating. I think we are onto something, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Apprentice Telemancer Astrandis|I shall combine the readings while you return to camp. I can practically smell the Eye!}}
