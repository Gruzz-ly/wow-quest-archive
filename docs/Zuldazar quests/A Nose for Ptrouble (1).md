*Kua'fon rescued (1)

==Description==
Ah, yes, I was wondering when you would come to check on your little one.

As you have likely noticed, he is not here. Little ones are very curious and often seek to leave the nest before they are ready. It is often the brooding mother's job to keep them from wandering.

What, did you think I was going to stop him?

<Wingminder Goja laughs.>

I heard some screeching to de west. Best hurry, or you may not have a hatchling to look after!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Kua'fon makes a soft sound deep in his throat. He seems very pleased with himself.>

==Notes==
*Kill [[Territorial Razorwing]].
