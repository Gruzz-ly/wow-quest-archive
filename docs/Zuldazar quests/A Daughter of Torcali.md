==Objectives==
Find the Child of Torcali in the <[[Slough]] / [[Savagelands]]> and rescue her from danger.
*[[Child of Torcali (NPC)|Child of Torcali]] rescued

==Description==
It has long been remarked upon that a [[direhorn]] is de bravest [[beast]] in de jungle. That is why they are chosen as [[mount]]s for our [[warrior]]s.

In this case, that bravery may not be in your favor. De little one has run off and I do not think she is hungry this time.

Best find her before she gets hurt.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The Child of Torcali holds her head high.>

==Notes==
*When in the Slough, kill a [[Territorial Razorwing]]. When in the [[Savagelands]], kill a [[Hungry Savagelands Juvenile]].

==Progression==
...

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.2.0|note=Added.}}
