==Objectives==
Help [[Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher]] recover a Xibalan fossil.
*Fossil Revealed (0/100%)

==Description==
Greetings, <name>.

I have been sent on behalf of my father, [[High Examiner Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher]], to oversee the extraction of all fossils, relics, and artifacts from this area.

My sources inform me that an object that could advance the [[Horde]]'s cause may be buried beneath [[Xibala|this very site]].

I will require your help extracting it. You see, these [[nightborne]] are not precisely good with their hands. Nor do they enjoy getting dirty.

Could you be a dear and set a good example?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
By all means, let us assist young Tae'shara. Such enthusiasm is to be rewarded.

==Completion==
You used your hands! How quaint. The nightborne have devised a number of ways to avoid such petty labors.

==Notes==
You can interact with [[Dirt Pile]]s several times...

;First sweep
:{{Text|say|Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher|Very good. Keep a steady hand, now.}}
:{{Text|say|Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher|Try not to damage the fossil... Excellent.}}
:{{Text|say|Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher|Aaahhhh, wonderful. Isn't that satisfying?}}
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Telemancer Astrandis|Satisfying? Madame we shall be here all year at this pace.}}
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Telemancer Astrandis|My friend, please feel free expedite things. This device will be of service.}}
:{{Text|say|Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher|Wait!}}

...or click on the [[Carefully Calibrated Sweeper]] to do the job quickly.

;Fossil revealed
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Telemancer Astrandis|Really, was that so bad?}}
:{{Text|say|Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher|The scuff marks... the uneven dirt removal... oh, how will we display it now?!}}
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Telemancer Astrandis|No need to be so dramatic.}}
