==Objectives==
Help collect baseline stats for Grong's speed, intelligence, and strength.
* Speak to [[Morton Cogswald|Morton Cogswalt]]{{sic}}
* Reach the marker
* Speak to [[Grong]]
* [[Xibalan Ravasaur]] slain

==Description==
We'll need to collect some baseline statistics before we use the [[Embiggifier]].

Grong will be asked to perform basic tasks pertaining to speed, intelligence, and strength. 

This will help us measure the increase once he's been embiggified.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Quite impressive, really! Grong's in superb condition.

==Notes==
;Speak to Morton Cogswalt{{sic}}
{{Dialogue|
You'll serve as proctor during these tests.

Plus, it's never a bad idea to have someone close in case something goes wrong... but that won't happen.

Let me know when you're ready to begin.

{{gossip|I am ready.}}

You are once again placed on Grong's shoulders, only this time you're in control. He has four abilities: Leap, for quicker travel, Roar and Smash as attacks, and Speak.

;Reach the marker
:{{text|say|Morton Cogswald|The [[Alliance]] salutes your commitment to science!}}
:{{text|say|Megs|We'll measure Grong's speed first.}}
:{{text|say|Morton Cogswald|There's a marker south of here. See how quickly Grong can reach it.}}

;Speak to Grong
:{{text|say|Megs|Nicely done! Next we'll measure intelligence.}}
:{{text|say|Morton Cogswald|Converse with Grong. We'll monitor speech patterns and vocabulary.}}
Use Speak.
:{{text|say|Grong|I am proud to play my part in this scientific endeavor that will ultimately be the undoing of the [[Horde]].}}
:{{text|say|Morton Cogswald|Was that a run-on sentence?}}
:{{text|say|Megs|t's fine, Morton. He knows more words than you do.}}
:{{text|say|Morton Cogswald|Impertinent! Think he knows that one?}}
:{{text|say|Megs|Moving on... We need to make note of Grong's strength.}}

;Xibalan Ravasaur slain
Near the marker, there should be plenty of targets to chose from.
:{{text|say|Morton Cogswald|Testing complete!}}
:{{text|say|Megs|We'll review the results back at camp.}}
On reaching the gnomes you're automatically dismounted.
