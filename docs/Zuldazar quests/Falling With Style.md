==Objectives==
Take [[Kua'fon]] on another flight on the [[:Huge Dragon Kite]].
* Ride the [[Huge Dragon Kite (NPC)|Kite]]
* Build Kua'fon's confidence (0/100%)

==Description==
<Kua'fon looks to the kite, then back at you. He looks to the kite again, poking his head forward deliberately. He slowly pans his gaze back to you.>

Skree.

<nowiki><Time for another flight!></nowiki>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There is a method to Pa'ku's madness.

==Completion==
Another successful flight! I only hope it helps Kua'fon learn that de sky is his home, in time.

Do not worry, he will get back up to de nest on his own.

==Notes==
The objective is to fly through the rings of clouds. Avoid little gusts of air, which propel you backward and give the Trust Issues debuff.
