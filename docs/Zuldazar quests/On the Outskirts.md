==Objectives==
Find [[Nisha]] on the southern coast of [[Zuldazar]].

==Description==
If things are settled for [[Commander Dresh|the Commander]], you should check in on Nisha.

I'm sure she could use your help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
[[Bladeguard Sonji|Sonji]] was right to be worried.

The [[naga]] are planning an attack, but I've got a plan to stop them in their tracks.

We need to work fast, though.

==Notes==
Nisha can be found surrounded by [[Nazeshi]] corpses on the border between [[Covescale Rise]] and the [[Dreadpearl Shallows]]. On approach:
