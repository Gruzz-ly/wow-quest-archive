==Notes==
'''Speaking with SI:7 Infiltrator'''

You are going to execute the operation? Good. They told me they were sending the bust, but I was not expecting you!

My orders are to provide support. I can hide you from all but the most prying eyes. Sneak into their camp and take out the target.

I can also give you one more smoke bomb for getting out once you have completed the mission. Use it to make your escape!

{{Gossip|I am ready.}}
:''The player receives the Infiltrating buff.''

In Warbeast Kraal, you can also use [[Conveniently Empty Basket]]s. Avoid [[Watchful Lookout]]s.

After the target is killed, you can use the extra button to return to the infiltrator.
