==Objectives==
Use the Portal Orb on 6 [[Horde]] [[Ambassador|Emissaries]].
* [[Horde Emissary|Horde emissaries]] thrown in [[void]] rift (6)
* [[Portal Orb]] (provided)

==Description==
The Horde have sent emissaries to help with their potential alliance with the [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]]. 

These emissaries are also sharing secrets that the Horde have regarding the [[Alliance]]. We need to put a stop to this.

Take this orb. It will create a void [[portal]] above the target and pull them... somewhere else.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Be careful with that orb, <name>.

==Completion==
Good work, this should cripple both the Horde and the Zandalari in their fight against the Alliance.

==Progression==
{{The Strike on Zuldazar}}

==Patch changes==
