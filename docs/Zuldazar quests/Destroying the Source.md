==Objectives==
Destroy 3 [[Nazeshi Powercell]]s within [[Dreadpearl Shallows]].
*Nazeshi Powercells destroyed (3)

==Description==
[[Tidecaller Nezara]] is running the show. If we take her out, the remaining [[naga]] will break rank, but getting to her won't be easy. She's protected by a magical barrier that's drawing power from powercells nearby.

If we can destroy the source, we can destroy Nezara.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}

==Progress==
Did you take out the powercells?

==Completion==
Tidecaller Nezara can't hide behind her barrier now!

==Notes==
