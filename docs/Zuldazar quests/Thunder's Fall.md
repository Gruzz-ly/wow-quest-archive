==Objectives==
Kill Warlord Kao.
* [[Warlord Kao]] slain

==Description==
Warlord Kao commands de [[mogu]] from dis [[warship]]. It is time to put an end to dis incursion.

I should be able to hold off any stragglers dat may come to Kao's aid, but I can only maintain dis barrier for so long.

Be careful. Kao was one of de [[Thunder King]]'s top [[General (rank)|generals]]. He will not fall without a fight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Without Kao at their head, de mogu will fall easily.

==Completion==
De [[Rastakhan|king]] is in danger!
