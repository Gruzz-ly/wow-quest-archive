==Description==
I know [[Rastakhan]] is furious dat dey claimed his [[ship]], of all de vessels in our [[Golden Fleet|navy]].

But dere is a better question to ask. Why did dey bring it here?

[[Zeb'ahari]] is a small fishing [[village]]. Dere are no [[warrior]]s here, no powerful supporters of de king. Dere must be another reason.

Board de ship and have a good look around. See if you can find out why dey brought dat beast of a boat way out here.
