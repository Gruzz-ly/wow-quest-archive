==Progress==
The Alliance dares to assault us in Zuldazar?! We must crush these fools so cruelly and so swiftly that they never consider this again.

==Completion==
Attacking Zuldazar was unusually arrogant, even for the Alliance.

Thank you for personally showing them how poor of a choice that was. Our [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari allies]] will be reassured of our commitment to them, and inspired by our show of force in their defense.

==Notes==
;Quest accept
: {{text|say|[[High Warlord Cromush]]|Protecting Zuldazar is our top priority. We cannot allow the Alliance to encroach upon the city. Push them back to their boats!}}

;Alliance assaults repelled
: {{text|say|High Warlord Cromush|Well done. You've bought us enough time to deal with that airship and its cowardly bombs. Take it down}}

Go to [[Warbeast Kraal]] to ride a Trained Pterrordax, that brings you to an [[Alliance Airship]].

;On arrival
: {{text|say|[[Lady Liadrin]]|An airship can be felled just as any other foe: strike at a critical target and hold nothing back.}}
: {{text|say|[[Captain Townsworth]]|Repel boarders!}}

;Freeing prisoners
: {{text|say|[[Horde Prisoner]]|Some goblin ingenuity, and a lot of explosives, we could take this ship down!}}
: {{text|say|Horde Prisoner|I'm free!}}
: {{text|say|Horde Prisoner|You are full of suprise.}}
: {{text|say|Horde Prisoner|I owe you!}}
: {{text|say|Horde Prisoner|Many thanks!}}
: {{text|say|Horde Prisoner|Nice work <name>}}

;Sabotaging the fuel
: {{text|say|Horde Prisoner|This contraption is all wood. Find the fuel and we'll light it up!}}

;Destroying the airship
: {{text|say|Lady Liadrin|Our soldiers can handle the rest from here. Take a moment for yourself before your next assignment, <class>. You have earned it.}}
