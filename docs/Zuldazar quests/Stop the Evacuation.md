==Objectives==
Stop the Alliance evacuation efforts.
* [[Inconspicuous Seaforium Bomb|Seaforium Bomb Placed]]
* [[Captain Sarai Naut]] slain
* [[Alliance Boat]] slain

==Description==
This is a complete disaster. The intelligence you gathered seems to indicate that they already have footholds on this island and this is just another one.

They have a boat and we need to stall them. Here's some [[seaforium]]. Plant it on their boat and sabotage their hopes of escape. If possible, take out their Captain leading the evacuation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==

==Completion==
Finally something goes our way. We've stopped them escaping, for now.
