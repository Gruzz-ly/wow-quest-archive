==Notes==
;King Rastakhan

:[[Zul]]'s treachery cuts deeper than I realized. With his rebellion, he practically depleted my army.

:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|Champion, look for any civilians still in de Zocalo and send dem to us. We will follow as we are able.}}

Talanji joins Warguard Rakera, [[Bladeguard Kaja]], [[Meerah]], and [[Pa'kura Warbow]]s. [[Akunda]] is fighting outside.

;Akunda
:See to your city, hero. I will hold the Northern road from these vile sethrak.

;Bladeguard Kaja
:I never thought I would see the streets of [[Zuldazar]] overrun by any enemy...

;Warguard Rakera
:Where are de defenses? Has Zuldazar grown so weak from Zul's betrayal it cannot defend itself?

:I had Meerah rush us to get here in time to warn de [[Rastari|royal guards]], but dere are so few left. It will fall to us to defend what remains.

;Meerah
:You wouldn't believe the route we had to take to get here before the sethrak. If your friends didn't have my help they never would have made it over those mountains in time.

:Oh, and we brought Akunda and Kimbul. Akunda is covering our backs and I don't know where Kimbul went but he said something about "rending the enemy" or something.

:All I know is that we saw a LOT of sethrak coming this way. A LOT OF!

Going through the Zocalo, Talajni conjures Loa's Prayer: Regeneration. Rescue ten from [[Rakle the Wretched]], [[Chronicler Bah'Kini]], [[Madam Konawla]], [[Vessel Iluna]], [[Vessel Zetoa]], [[No'ci the Scribe]], [[Trader Haw'li]], [[Old Tella]], [[Toko]], [[Bri'tani]], [[Headhunter Lani]], [[Moj'ito]], and [[B'wizati]].

;Civilian gossip
:Blood [[cultist]]s, sethrak, [[mogu]], and even our own Zul? I miss de simple days when [[War against the Zandalari|we were just trying to take over]] de [[Azeroth|world]].

:{{Gossip|Make for Princess Talanji and Warguard Rakera.}}

;Vendor gossip
:I swear, if I survive dis, I promise not to swindle my customers for at least two... maybe three weeks.

;Chronicler Bah'Kini
:I stood in the wake of the [[scourge]] when it stormed across [[Zul'Drak]], and yet this attack on my homeland by those we trusted as friends....

:Well, I am normally not a violent troll, but I do believe I may need to kill someone for dis.

;Old Tella
:This is nothing. During de [[Third War|third war]] I witnessed de great bone dance of de [[Rootway]]. It was de most scarousing ting I ever seen.

;Toko
:Invasions, coups, rise of the [[Old God|old gods]], bah! I am lot leaving this Zocalo until Old Tella here pays me back.

The civilians all run to the group and get a sword and shield. A dead [[Caravan Brutosaur]] bars the path.

====Stage 6 - Follow the pack====

:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|Champion, de loa and I will hold off Mythrax for as long as possible. Find my father and put an end to Zul!}}

Sethrak and another Mythrax stand at the end of the bridge. Approaching Mythrax at the end of the bridge causes Noxious Rot. Dead [[Rastari Defender]]s are laying next to King Rastakhan.

;Kimbul
:We will not be able to hold Mythrax for long. Slay Zul while there is still time.

Continue to Rastakhan.

====Final Stage - Reach Zul====
*Assault Dazar'alor to reach Zul before he can destroy the pyramid.
*Reach Zul

:{{Text|say|King Rastakhan|Too many sided with Zul. Dere is only one path forward...}}
:{{Text|say|King Rastakhan|Bwonsamdi, show yourself!}}
:''Bwonsamdi appears.''
:{{Text|say|Bwonsamdi|Easy now, ya Majesty. Bwonsamdi are{{sic}} always helping friend...}}
:{{Text|say|Bwonsamdi|Rise... rise! Don't be lazy now! Take up ya spears again and FIGHT!}}
:''Bwonsamdi rises [[Rastari Spirit]]s from nearby bodies.''

The [[ghost]]s attack [[Warlord Kara-na]] and his soldiers blocking the way.

:{{Text|say|Warlord Kara-na|You will never reach the precipice in time!}} <!-- may have been beta-only. -->
:{{Text|say|Warlord Kara-na|Zul has foreseen this day. By fighting to change destiny, you only prove its inevitable truth!}}
:{{Text|say|Warlord Kara-na|Zul... never said... I would lose...}}

Continue along the way to the top, killing [[Kao-Tien Render]]s and [[Zanchuli Betrayer]]s.

*{{Text|say|Zanchuli Betrayer|Ya can't kill us all...}}
*{{Text|say|Zanchuli Betrayer|My death... be changin'... nothin'...}}

On the upper level, the bodies of [[Torcali Ironhide]]s can be seen. Attack [[Ma'da Renkala]]. In the background, Mythrax has changed its size for bigger and is fighting against Gonk, Pa'ku, and Kimbul.

:{{Text|say|Ma'da Renkala|Your soul for me master! Your soul for G'huun!}}

Upon her death, a cinematic plays.

:''Zul laughs.''
:'''Zul''': {{text|bossemote|You are too late, Rastakhan. Rise. Rise Mythrax. Rise.}}
:'''Rastakhan''': {{text|bossemote|Bwonsamdi! We had a deal. Grant me your power!}}
:''Bwonsamdi empowers Rastakhan. Rastakhan and Zul fight.''
:'''Zul''': {{text|bossemote|Mythrax, do it now! Destroy the seal!}}
:''Zul observes Mythrax as he charges a blast, and drops his weapon. Rastakhan charges and stabs Zul. The blast hits the seal.''
:''Zul laughs.''
:'''Zul''': {{text|bossemote|Fool. Long may you reign... over your empire of ash.}}
:''Rastakhan punches Zul. He falls into violet fire.''
:''Bwonsamdi chuckles.''
:'''Bwonsamdi''': {{text|bossemote|Look at this. Congratulations, Your Majesty. The kingdom... is ours.}}
