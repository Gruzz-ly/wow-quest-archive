==Objectives==
Collect 10 Steaming Fresh Carrion.
*[[Steaming Fresh Carrion]] (10)

==Description==
Nice little [[Direhorn Hatchling|critter]] you got there. Seems a tad too small to be much more than a nuisance though. 

Wanna help a friend make a profit? There's an abundance of opportunity here, but [[Zandalari troll|these trolls]] won't listen to me!

Tell you what, I can make a supplement of sorts that'll make hair grow on your chest! Er, your hatchling's chest! 

I know [[direhorn]] are vegetarians and all, but there's a reason all the biggest predators eat meat!

Rapid growth requires protein. LOTS of protein.

You interested?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
So? Did you get everything I need?

==Completion==
Meat is pretty miraculous stuff, you know!

Er, you might want to keep the details about this to yourself for the time being.

==Progression==
{{Warbeast Kraal}}
