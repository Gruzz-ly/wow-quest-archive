==Objectives==
Gather chunks of [[naga]] flesh as an [[Offering to Gral|offering]] to [[Gral]].
* [[Chunk of Naga Flesh]] (12)

==Description==
You see the sinking [[ruins]] to the east? They were, not long ago, a temple to the [[shark]] [[loa]], Gral.

The naga tore down his temple and now are stealing his secrets. If it is for something good, I'll be a rock's uncle.

It would be wise to let Gral know what's going on here. I do not think he would approve.

Gral was quite powerful, and when it came to his knowledge of the sea, none could compare. It never hurts to have a fellow like that on your side.

Some fresh, bloody naga meat may just lure him out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
<There is a feeling of anticipation emanating from the bowl.>

==Completion==
Now this! This is an offering worthy of my attention!

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|Say|Trader Kro|Find Gral. Let him know what transpires here. We do not think he will approve. His sharp, pointy teeth could come in handy.}}

;On completion
:{{Text|Say|[[Shrine of Gral]]|The deliciously sharp scent of naga rage-infused blood... the sweet tender morsels... I will attend for this.}}
