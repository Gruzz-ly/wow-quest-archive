==Description==
Your [[hunter]] king, Nesingwary, is a mighty fine bit of prey here. I even thought of hunting him myself.

But someone else is on his trail now. And dat hunter, he is a dangerous one.

If you wish to save your hunter king, you best start tracking quickly. If he made camp, you may be too late already. You cannot paint a target and wonder why you were shot!

I believe he was last seen heading west...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ye shouldn't have come.

==Notes==
;Nesingwary's Campfire
<This campfire is still going strong. Nesingwary must have been here recently.

;Dwarf Trap
<This trap appears to be designed specifically for dwarven legs.>

;Nesingwary's Favorite Rifle
<You notice the gentle bend in the grass beneath this polished rifle. It appears to have been recently dropped.

It seems to be pointing north east, toward a nearby hut.>
