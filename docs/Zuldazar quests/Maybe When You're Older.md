==Objectives==
Return to the nest at [[Pterror Rise]].
*[[Child of Pa'ku|Return to the Nest]]

==Description==
<[[Pa'ku]] squints down at the [[Kua'fon|young pterrordax]].>

Well, I am out of ideas. My son will take you back to the nest. Do not worry, this one can fly.

YOUR little one will need to get back on his own. It builds character.

Maybe he will grow out of this absurd deficiency in time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,790 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How did it go?

==Completion==
Pa'ku is Lord of Wind. Naturally she expects young of her brood to take the same joy in flight.

Your little one will come around. Some just take longer than others.
