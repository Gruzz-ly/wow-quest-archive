==Objectives==
Place Volatile Explosives on [[naga]] Harpoon Launchers, and then detonate them to create a distraction.
*Explosives placed (8)
*Explosives detonated

==Description==
The area surrounding [[Tidecaller Nezara]] is heavily guarded, so I'll need you to create a distraction.

Take these explosives. Plant them on the naga's harpoon launchers. Once they've been detonated, the blast should be more than enough to send the guards running! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}

==Progress==
A fiery distraction is just what we need!

==Completion==
You sure do excel at blowing things up!

==Notes==
Upon accepting Explosions Always Work, [[We'll Use Their Weapons]], and [[Destroying the Source]]:
:{{Text|say|Nisha|If we wanna stop the naga, we need to take down their leader's shield. I'm counting on you!}}

Look for the harpoon launchers stationed around the area. Two Volatile Explosives can be placed on the base of each one. Once all 8 are in place, a new action button appears, allowing you to blow them all up at once:
