==Objectives==
Locate [[Getry Sellswill]] at the [[Kaja'Coast]] in [[Zandalar]].
*Getry found near Kaja'Coast
*Getry's Body investigated

==Description==
If you're reading this, I'm out scavenging for reagents along the Kaja'Coast.

If you're here to collect on a debt, you are TRESPASSING and must disregard this note.

-Getry

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Sewer Wanderer's Belt]]
*[[Sewer Wanderer's Bracers]]
*[[Sewer Wanderer's Gloves]]
*[[Sewer Wanderer's Shoulderpads]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|17|55}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
The pack has largely escaped damage. A well-worn book is visible from underneath the open flap.

==Completion==
<There must be Redberries growing somewhere in the area.>

==Notes==
Travel to [[Kaja'Coast]] by going to [[Slam Central Station]]. Then look for [[Getry Sellswill]]. However, he looks to have been killed:
{{Dialogue|Getry's body has been crushed.

Splinters of kaja'mite protrude from the wound.}}

Interact with [[Getry's Pack]]:
{{Dialogue|<Getry's pack lies next to his crushed form. It's largely escaped damage.

The well-worn spine of a book peeks out of the open top.>

{{gossip|quest=| <Flip through its pages.>}}

<You find a newly-inked page toward the back of the book.>

Still workshopping this new concoction. Alls it does is turn a customer into a rat! Not sure how to market this just yet. I paid a poor sap to try out what I thought was a one-way transformation. But then the little rat got into some redberries from the Kaja'Coast and changed himself back! Naturally, I charged the little thief double what I paid him before and kicked him out.

Let no one say that Getry Sellswill ever gave someone a free ride. It's bad for business!}}

==Progression==
{{Oh, Rats!}}
