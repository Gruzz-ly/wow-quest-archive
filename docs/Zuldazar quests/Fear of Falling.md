==Objectives==
Find your hatchling and convince it to return to the nest.
*[[Kua'fon|Hatchling]] found
*[[Shimmerfin Flesh]] (8)

==Description==
Some young find their wings sooner than others. At least yours had the sense to keep them open.

I would not worry too much about its safety- little ones tend to bounce.

As for this failure... the young must keep trying, and they must learn not to fear falling. It is now your task to teach it.

<The [[Pa'ku|loa]] smiles at you, all teeth.>

If it is reluctant to learn, you might consider bribery.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
<Kua'fon quivers in fear and chirps at you in distress.

Perhaps a treat could soothe your hatchling?>

==Completion==
<The hatchling inspects your hands warily.>
