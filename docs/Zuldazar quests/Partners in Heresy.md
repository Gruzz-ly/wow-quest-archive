;Description
Zanchuli scum! These traitors killed my brother and wounded my King on Zul's orders.

To add insult to injury, they called the mogu to fight beside them. Now they hunt us even in this sacred place, interrogating our priests with dark magic.

I cannot leave my King's side, so I charge you with the task of slaying the mogu who have answered Zul's call.

;Completion
Good. It is not vengeance, but it is a start.
