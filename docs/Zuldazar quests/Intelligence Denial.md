==Objectives==
Kill Spymaster Stormhorn, Spymaster Bloodsnarl, and Spymaster Bilespreader.
* [[Spymaster Stormhorn]] slain
* [[Spymaster Bloodsnarl]] slain
* [[Spymaster Bilespreader]] slain

==Description==
There are three [[Horde]] [[spymaster]]s stationed within [[Warport Rastari]]. They are giving the [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] information on the [[Alliance navy|Alliance fleet]].

We need these targets killed. We cannot allow the Zandalari to get any advantageous information on our fleet.

Luckily for us, your [[blood troll]] disguise means any witnesses will believe this to be a bold attack by the blood trolls.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Have you taken care of those [[Spy|spies]]?

==Completion==
You've prevented the zandalari from getting crucial information regarding our naval forces. Well done.

==Progression==
{{The Strike on Zuldazar}}

==Patch changes==
