==Objectives==
Retrieve Xal'atath and find the Makeshift Altar.

* [[Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|Xal'atath]] acquired
* Makeshift Altar found
* Xal'atath placed

==Description==
This medallion is inscribed with orders commanding the [[naga]] to invade our shores and seize artifacts of power.

<[[Collector Kojo|Kojo]] studies you thoughtfully.>

I've heard tales of [[Adventurer#Broken Isles|a priest]] who used a horrifying dagger to fight the [[Burning Legion]]. It is said this blade... Xal'atath... whispers secrets of the deep. It might be our best chance of uncovering what the naga seek.

I recently came upon a makeshift naga altar in [[Atal'Gral]]. If you take Xal'atath there, the dagger may reveal crucial information.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<You feel a familiar sensation as Xal'atath reaches out to your mind.

A beguiling blend of dread... and delight.>

==Progression==
{{The Azsharan Medallion}}
