* Speak with Jazz on the Kaja'Coast

==Description==
<This listing is new, posted by the [[Bilgewater Cartel]].>

Do you like [[kaja'mite]]? Are ya ready to get your intellectual fix under some tropical sun? Want to develop cutting-edge tools that will only explode when we tell them to? Hop on a rocket drill to the Kaja'Coast!

No prior experience required. Combat capabilities extremely welcome. Contractors are liable for their own safety. Compensation and working hours negotiable on-site. 

Please seek Jazz Mokkitz on the Kaja'Coast for more information.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Research takes guts, sure, but I would like to keep mine intact.

==Completion==
<Jazz dusts himself off, looking exhausted.>

Ya wouldn't believe how many times that's happened today--that was the biggest one yet, too.

Hope you're ready to get your hands dirty, <name>. We've got work to do!

==Notes==
Take the rocket drill at [[Slam Central Station]] to the [[Kaja'Coast]] of [[Zuldazar]], then speak with [[Jazz Mokkitz]]:
{{dialogue|<Jazz eyes you warily.>

I'm here on cartel business, not leisure. Unless you're here for the research gig, ya better scram before you... uh, I dunno. Get eaten by a pterodax?{{sic}}

{{gossip|quest=|I'm here for the research job.}}}}
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Really? Great! I'm surprised a <class> like you came all this way.}}
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Now, I dunno how much you know about kaja'mite, but--wait.}}
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Can ya hear that? Oh blast, not again!}}
:''The ground shakes and a Raging Kaja'mite Gemsplitter elemental pops out of the ground.''
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Ow... That hunk o' rock got me right in the noggin.}}

After completing the quest, Jazz has gossip:
{{dialogue|Ugh, my head's still spinnin' a bit. Not in the fun way either. This is nothin' like makin' components for the Slam Central rockets! Ah, blast it. Complainin's gonna get us nowhere. 

Bilgewater's a good bunch to work for. I can trust 'em to send my paychecks on time, and to keep my family safe back in Undermine. Can't ask for much more than that.

{{gossip|What's kaja'mite?}}

{{dialogue-child|Ah, you're not familiar, are ya? 

Those yellow hunks o' crystal right there? That's raw kaja'mite. The stuff's been around for ages--mostly as a brain booster, y'know? 

Folks use it to clear their mind, make their thoughts easier to comb through. "Kaja'cola, it gives you ideas," as the drink slogan goes. Even the Zandalari use kaja'mite!

However, as you may have noticed, it's also useful to do other things--namely, stabilizing volatile energy. Maybe that's why it worked to clear people's heads? 

I dunno, I'm a rocket scientist, not a doctor!

{{gossip|Why are you researching it?}}

We know kaja'mite's got potential, more than we originally thought. The Darkfuse used it to bottle up the Black Blood and weaponize the stuff. 

Bilgewater HQ figured we better run our own tests and learn what it's capable of, before we got our behinds handed to us again.

But I am NEVER drinking Kaja'cola again. If kaja'mite can hold onto Old God guck, I don't wanna find out what else it'd snag along for me to drink.}}
{{gossip|You're a rocket scientist?}}

{{dialogue-child|What engineer isn't? HA! Just kidding.

I specialize in transport rockets. Ya know Slam Central? The fuel components in those are my pride and joy! Makin' things explode only when we want 'em to is my whole shtick.

And before ya ask, I took this job because I'm supportin' a family o' four back home in Undermine. 

I don't like the idea of making kaja'mite weaponry, but a job's a job, and Gazlowe's good people. If I gotta make weapons for anyone, he's the one guy I'd work for.  

The gig won't stop me from dreamin' of a better Undermine, though. We just gotta build it, and that's the one thing us goblins are good at!}}
