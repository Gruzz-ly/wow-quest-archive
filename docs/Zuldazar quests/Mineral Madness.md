==Objectives==
Clear out aggressive Kaja'mite elementals and collect 12 Raw Kaja'mite Chunks from them.
* [[Raw Kaja'mite Chunk]] (12)

==Description==
With all these elementals wreakin' havoc, it's impossible to work out here! How are we supposed to gather raw material when they're swingin' at us with the stuff?

<Jazz stops, eyes lighting up.>

<Name>, those elementals ARE our raw material. Smashin' 'em up is our best bet--though, you'll have to do that for me. 

Now, keep it movin'! Time is money, and I ain't one to waste perfectly good research funding.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Who knew this place was so elementally active? No wonder the Darkfuse needed all hands on deck out here.

==Completion==
I'm gonna have to get some shamans out here to calm the rest of those rocks down. 

I don't blame 'em for being mad and all, but the mountain's already been blown to bits. Not much we can do about that.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Thanks for saving me the bruises, <name>. My wife doesn't like me takin' risks like that.}}
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|I've got somethin' special for us to work on when you're done. I'll get our parts and meet you by the mines!}}
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|I just gotta let the world stop spinning first.}}

Valid targets include [[Agitated Kaja'mental]]s and [[Jittery Shardling]]s.

On return:
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Hey! Over here!}}

==Progression==
{{Kaja'Curiosity}}
