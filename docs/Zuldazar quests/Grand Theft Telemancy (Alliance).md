Slay Third Telemancer Syranel and recover the Breath of Xibala.
* [[Third Telemancer Syranel]] slain
* [[Breath of Xibala]]

==Description==
I'm not opposed to honest competition, <name>.

But teleportin' it right out from under our noses leaves me feelin' dirty.

Go teach that thievin' [[nightborne|elf]] what it means t'steal from the [[Alliance]]. If they're fightin' dirty, then so will we.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Ye get the Breath of Xibala back?

==Completion==
I'm a [[dwarf]] of me word, <name>.

Here's yer cut. I'll see to it that this here... pot... is delivered to the Alliance with my praise for yer actions.

It's a little underwhelming, isn't it?
