Our next target is a ship docked in a place across from here, the Warport Rastari.

Let's get going!

* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Completion==
Glad you could make it, <name>. We've got a lot to do within Warport Rastari.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Let's go! The submarine should already be deployed.}}
:''Kelsey and [[John J. Keeshan|John]] run towards the submarine.''

;On boarding
:{{Text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Sit back and relax, I'll get us to the warport in no time flat!}}
:{{Text|say|John J. Keeshan|Kelsey, why didn't we just take this submarine over to the [[Isle of Fangs]]?}}
:{{Text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Oh! Ha ha... well, the miniaturized containment field wasn't really working so well ten minutes ago.}}
:{{Text|say|John J. Keeshan|I see, it's good that you've fixed it.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Yep, it's definitely fixed! Hey! Why don't we review those records that <name> found?}}
:{{Text|say|John J. Keeshan|Let's see. It seems like [[Halford Wyrmbane|Halford's]] intel was right about the location of most ships, as well as their sailing routes. Although...}}
:{{Text|say|John J. Keeshan|We have a problem. There's a ship that we didn't account for. Maybe it was one that was stationed in [[Pandaria]].}}
:{{Text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|One ship? Doesn't sound too bad.}}
:{{Text|say|John J. Keeshan|It's bad when you consider its route takes it within eyesight of our outpost in [[Xibala]].}}
:{{Text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|We'll need to warn Halford right away after we drop <name> off.}}

;On approach
:''Shandris and Umbric are hiding behind a tree.''
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|The amount of guards in this port is astounding. They must be preparing to move out the fleet.}}
:{{Text|say|Magister Umbric|My people and I will not allow the [[Alliance]] to be destroyed by these monstrous trolls. You have my word.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|You sound like you've had experience with the Zandalari in the past.}}
:{{Text|say|Magister Umbric|You and I have both lived long lives, Shandris. I know many who have been affected by the Zandalari's barbarism.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|And you do not seem hesitant to use your [[Void]] powers against them.}}
:{{Text|say|Magister Umbric|The Void can be used to protect, as long as you do not succumb to its power.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Used to protect? Interesting, Umbric.}}
:{{Text|say|Magister Umbric|You sound surprised. Did you imagine my people simply used void magic as if it were a toy?}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Like you said, Umbric, I have lived a long life. I have seen power corrupt the most noble of [[race]]s... restraint has been uncommon.}}
:{{Text|say|Magister Umbric|My people will not make the same mistake when using the Void, I promise.}}
