Seek out [[Hexlord Raal]].

==Description==
<[[Kua'fon]] wheezes and quivers, exhausted.>

It's not going anywhere. Maybe it's time to seek someone without wings for advice.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,790 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I heard de screeching. Glad to see you still be in one piece.

==Notes==
Return to Kua'fon's nest. The Hexlord, accompanied by [[Ata the Winglord]], is there.
