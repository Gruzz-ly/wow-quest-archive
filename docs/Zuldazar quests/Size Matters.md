==Objectives==
Administer the 'voodoo'-ed Aggression Formula to [[Gentle Ben'jin|Ben'jin]].
* [[Voodoo'ed Aggression Formula]] administered
* Travel to [[Gloomtail's Den|Gloomtail's Cave]]
* [[Gloomtail's Head]]
* [[Voodoo'ed Aggression Formula]] (provided)

==Description==
So the unintended side-effect of Gentle Ben'jin being, shall we say 'fun-sized' is that he is now small enough to get into the cave where the alpha wind serpent is! 

The beast is called [[Gloomtail]] and if Ben'jin defeats it, he will feel like this territory is his and will want to fill it with little [[brutosaur]]s. So he will seek out a mate. If [[Irritable Maka'fon|Maka'fon]] is receptive, everyone wins! 

Go give him another hit of the formula!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
Size isn't all dat matters. Ben'jin can get to more places if he's small... and fight dere!

==Completion==
Dat was incredible! I could hear da snorting and stomping from here. 

Well done, <name>.
