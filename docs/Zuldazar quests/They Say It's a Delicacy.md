Obtain 25 Partially Digested Pods from the bellies of nearby [[diemetradon]]s.
* [[Partially Digested Pod]] (25)

==Description==
A romantic meal is de way to set up an evening for love. Dis is true for us, so why not for [[Irritable Maka'fon|Maka'fon]]? Bring her something rare and pleasing to her palate.

Diemetrodons near de water eat hard seed pods and partially digest them. With a little [[voodoo]], something magical can happen to de pods. It may be disgusting to you and I, but de [[brutosaur]]s consider it a rare delicacy. Such is life. 

Dere are plenty of diemetradons, so some must die dat de brutosaurs might live. Such is de purpose of death.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
De pods we need become edible only in de belly of de diemetradons. Watch your fingers in dere... de scales be sharp.

==Completion==
De pods may be unpleasant to us, but de brutosaurs like dem just fine.
