==Objectives==
Speak with [[Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth]] to sail to [[Zuldazar]].
* Speak with Jes-Tereth to sail to Zuldazar

==Description==
This is it, <name>. We've weakened the [[Horde]] enough to make a daring strike on Zuldazar itself.

Our forces in Zuldazar still remain hidden, thanks to the help of the [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron dwarves]]. That gives us our chance to strike.

Set sail to Zuldazar. We will be gathering our forces there for a coordinated strike to weaken their harbor defenses.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,790 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We're all gathered. Let's begin, we cannot afford to lose any more time.

==Progression==
{{The Strike on Zuldazar}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
