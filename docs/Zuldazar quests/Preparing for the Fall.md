==Objectives==
Destroy 8 Jambani stockpiles.
* [[Jambani Stockpile|Jambani stockpiles]] destroyed (8)

==Description==
<A large quantity of supplies are scattered throughout the temple grounds, much of it under heavy guard. The [[Jambani]] appear to be preparing for a siege or another significant event.

Zul would likely think it wise to stymie their efforts.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
Good. I did not need to tell you to do this thing.

The Jambani prepare for the fall of [[Zuldazar]] as foretold by [[Vol'jamba]]. This will not happen, but destroying their stockpiles will make them easier to eradicate once [[Rastakhan]] decides to deal with this situation.
