==Objectives==
Meet [[Apprentice Telemancer Astrandis|Assistant Telemancer Astrandis]] in western [[Xibala]] and aid him in his search for the [[Eye of Xibala]].
* Speak to Astrandis in the western ruins
* [[Essence Collector|First scrying vessel]] placed
* First scrying completed
* Second scrying vessel placed
* Second scrying completed
* Third scrying vessel placed
* Third scrying completed

==Description==
I have it! The readings from the ruins are unmistakable. Somewhere to the south and west of the ah... "foot", as it were, is a source of great magical energy.

It can be nothing but the Eye of Xibala!

We will need to place a few more scrying vessels to pinpoint the Eye's exact location.

Meet me deeper in the ruins. I will personally oversee this effort.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Completion==
I seem to have overestimated the ah... accuracy... of my scrying.

And thus, our enemies have located the Eye first.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Telemancer Astrandis|The readings are unmistakable! We go west!}}
:''Astrandis teleports away.''
:{{Text|say|[[Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher]]|Try to bring the relic back in one piece, <name>. Astrandis is... a tad enthusiastic.}}

Head to the west and speak with the telemancer.
:We are very close now, <name>.

:Just say the word and I will begin the scrying.

:Oh, I failed to mention. Our adversaries have set up camp just across the way, along the beach. I would keep a close watch on your surroundings in case we are ambushed.

:I trust you will defend me if we are accosted!

:{{Gossip|Let's begin.}}
:''Astrandis runs toward the location of the Essence Collector.''
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Telemancer Astrandis|Right this way! Once I begin my scrying, all of my attention will be focused upon it.}}
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Telemancer Astrandis|I trust you can handle any interruptions, yes?}}

Placing a collector causes a [[Dark Iron Saboteur (Zuldazar)|Dark Iron Saboteur]] to appear and slowly approach in stealth.

After the first scrying is complete, Astrandis runs toward the second location.
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Telemancer Astrandis|I must try again. You did well, though I had imagined our enemies to be somewhat taller.}}

;Second scrying complete
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Telemancer Astrandis|These results are so confusing. If only these-- what would you call them? Beardlings?-- would let me concentrate!}}

;Third scrying complete
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Telemancer Astrandis|No, no, this cannot be right. By my calculations it should be--!!}}
:{{Text|yell|[[Urda Direflame]]|We've got it, lads! Move out!}}
:{{Text|say|Apprentice Telemancer Astrandis|Taken from under our very noses! The nerve!}}
