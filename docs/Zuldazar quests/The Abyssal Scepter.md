==Objectives==
Meet with [[Jaina Proudmoore]] in [[Xibala]] in [[Zuldazar]].

==Description==
The Lord Admiral has proposed our next move. It's something we don't think the [[Horde]] will expect, but it's dangerous: We're going to steal back the [[:Abyssal Scepter]].

Your name came up as someone who could see it through, if you're willing to take the chance.

Meet Lady Jaina at our base in Xibala. She'll have more information for you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 4,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Jaina looks up from her consultation with [[Magister Umbric]] as you approach.>

This mission will be dangerous, but it's necessary to ensure our victory here in [[Zandalar]].

==Notes==
In Xibala, Jaina is accompanied by Umbric, Mathias Shaw, and Flynn Fairwind.

==Progression==
{{Mischief Managed}}
