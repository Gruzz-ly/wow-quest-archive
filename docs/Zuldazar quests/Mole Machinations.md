==Objectives==
Free 4 [[Dark Iron Earthbreaker]]s from [[mole machine]]s in [[Xibala]].
*[[Dark Iron Mole Machine (Zuldazar)|Dark Iron Mole Machine]] (4)

==Description==
Seems the enemy's anticipated our moves. While we developed our refinin' techniques for [[:Azerite]], the [[goblin]]s 'ave done the same.

It wasn't five minutes after we established ourselves here that the [[Horde]] arrived to disrupt our progress.

We've got several [[shaman]] of great import waitin' impatiently in the mole machines on that beach.

You can take the key and clear the way so they arrive safely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Ain't my fault those lads seem to hate small spaces.

==Completion==
If they didn't wanna cook in a mole machine, they shoulda chose a different profession!
