==Objectives==
Gather 7 lumps of [[crab]] meat from the [[Derelict Hexopod]]s.
* [[Large Lump of Crab Meat]] (7)

==Description==
The [[Forsaken]] didn't bring any food with them. I think they might be [[cannibal]]s. At the very least, they don't need to eat!

[[Teekay Treadlebobbin|Teekay]] and I are going to starve out here! <name>, if you're not too busy, could you bring us something to eat?

Maybe some fresh crab?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
My stomach is rumbling already.

==Completion==
This will do nicely. Now all we need is some butter. And maybe some lemon.
