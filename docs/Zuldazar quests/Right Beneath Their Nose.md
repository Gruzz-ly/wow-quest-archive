==Objectives==
Plant 3 Remote-Detonation Deathbombs within the main warship in [[Warport Rastari]].
* [[Remote-Detonation Deathbomb|Remote-detonation deathbomb]] planted (3)

==Description==
We must continue with our primary goal, plant bombs on major [[Zandalari Empire|Zandalari]] [[Boat|ships]]. There is one docked within the Warport.

You know what to do. Get beneath the boat, plant the [[bomb]]s, and ensure no one sees... a [[blood troll]] using bombs.

My invisibility flask will give you the stealth you need, and [[Magister Umbric|Umbric]] believes the ritual will give you some other power to tap into.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Good luck, <name>, and stay safe.

==Completion==
Good work. The [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] will be in for a rude awakening when we blow up their flagships moments before our first naval incursion.

==Notes==
*The player receives the Flask of Invisibility and Void Dash extra action buttons.
