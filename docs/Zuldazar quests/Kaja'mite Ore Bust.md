==Objectives==
Scan Kaja'mite Steam Vents in [[Gorilla Gorge]].
* [[Kaja'mite Steam Vent]] scanned (5)

==Description==
[[Kaja'mite]]! Just saying the name gives my big beautiful ears a buzz. 

These [[Zandalari]] were sitting on a huge deposit of it all these years. And they abandoned it just because of a few talking [[gorilla]]s. By [[goblin]] law it's ours for the taking!

Let's see how concentrated a deposit we're talking about. Get a good peek at those vents that are steaming out kaja'mite vapors.

Go into the gorge and plant my scanners on those steam vents. They'll do the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
You headed into that gorge yet pal? How rich am I about to be?

==Completion==
Thank you chump! I mean chum.

There's enough kaja'mite there to get us started. Too bad about all the talking gorillas in the way.
