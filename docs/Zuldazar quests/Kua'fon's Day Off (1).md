==Objectives==
Stop Kua'fon from being a nuisance in the [[Port of Zandalar]].
* [[Kua'fon]] deterred

==Description==
You know, I think Kua'fon might be lonely when you are not here.

What makes me say that? Well, I got a very angry scroll from a [[Tortollan]] indicating he was stealing shiny things from their stalls, but that could mean anything.

You should probably stop him before he damages your reputation, hm?

<[[Wingminder Goja]] cackles.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Kua'fon apologetically headbutts you.>

Skree.

==Notes==
He can appear in or near [[Spirits Be With You]], western [[Grand Bazaar]], [[Taste of Zandalar]], or [[Little Tortolla]].
