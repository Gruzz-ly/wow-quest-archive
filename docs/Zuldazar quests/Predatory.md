<Tied to her ankle you notice a length of rope that has been cleanly sliced through.

She was pierced through the heart, but you can see no trace of a weapon.

There seem to be no tracks leading to, or from, the body.>

<You see the teeth of a brutal trap dug into the fallen hunter's leg.

There seem to be darts piercing his armor.

You see the shocked look frozen on his face. He never saw what killed him.>
