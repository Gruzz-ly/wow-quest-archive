Listen, stranger. I don't have a lot of time left.

I was in de village when [[Zolani]] brought [[Rastakhan|de king]] to us. Said to keep it a secret, or else [[Zul]] would find us.

Look around. [[Atal'zul|Dey]] found us!

But I know... I know it was not de prophet's doing. Our loa-speaker gave Zolani her pretty words, said she would help, then turned around and sold us out.

It is Kihara's fault dat we are dying now. She brought dis upon us!

Kill her... Make her pay!
