==Objectives==
Collect the redberry reagents and return to Humphrey.
*[[Redberry|Redberries]] collected (8)

==Description==
<You surmise that collecting enough redberries and returning them to Humphrey should allow Alice to turn back into her usual goblin self.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Any luck with that antidote, <name>?

==Completion==
Thanks again for the antidote. We'll hang onto it for later.

Turns out Alice is a much better cook than she ever was before and wants to keep this success story rolling!

==Notes==
All over [[Kaja'Coast]] collect the redberries from the redberry plants. Once all eight of them are collected, return to the [[Vatworks]] and turn in to Humphrey Shortswig:
:{{Text|Say|Humphrey Shortswig|<Name>, you're back! So we may not need that antidote just yet, but I'll hang onto it for now.}}

==Progression==
{{Oh, Rats!}}
