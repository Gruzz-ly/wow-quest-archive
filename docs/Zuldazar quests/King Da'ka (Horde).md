==Objectives==
{{questportrait|King Da'ka.jpg|King Da'ka|The "Big Mon" of Gorilla Gorge. Highly intelligent and dangerous.}}
Slay King Da'ka.
*[[King Da'ka]] slain

==Description==
These [[Zandalari]] won't go near [[Gorilla Gorge]]. All because they're afraid!

It's just a few talking [[gorilla]]s. And one 'big mon' in particular as the Zandalari call him. 

All we need to do is take out King Da'ka and the villagers will probably throw us a parade! Or at least let us mine that [[kaja'mite]].

Think you can handle one big gorilla, chum?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
I love the smell of kaja'mite in the morning.

==Completion==
Good. One less mook to deal with. That kaja'mite is as good as ours!
