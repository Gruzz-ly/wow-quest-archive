==Objectives==
Slay 7 Dark Iron dwarves.
*[[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron dwarves]] slain (7)

==Description==
Their red eyes... flaming beards... dark, dusky skin. These can only be [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron dwarves]]. I have never seen one before this day.

It is my understanding that they have been sent here on an errand for the [[Alliance]]. Given [[Nightborne|my people's]] allegiance, I believe we are now placed in a position to better demonstrate our loyalty to the [[Horde]].

The Dark Iron must die. See that they do not claim so much as an inch more of this beach.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
I can think of no better way to demonstrate our profound loyalty, <name>.

==Completion==
Let there be no confusion on where we stand, <name>.

==Notes==
Kill [[Dark Iron Grenadier]]s and [[Dark Iron Earthbreaker]]s.

==Progression==
{{Xibala Horde}}

==Patch changes==
