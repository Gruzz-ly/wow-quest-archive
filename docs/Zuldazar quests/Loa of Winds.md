==Objectives==
Take [[Azala]] to Pterror Rise in [[Zuldazar]]. Make sure to call for her if she is not present when you get there.
* Visit [[Pterror Rise]]
* [[Casteless Zandalari Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
I heard dat [[Pa'ku]] lives somewhere in Zuldazar. Her [[priest]]s tell stories about her when dey come to de [[Hall of Castes]].

She's a pretty popular [[loa]]. I mean, she's in charge of de sky AND de sea! Dat's a lot of blue, and blue is my favorite color!

Maybe I could be one of her followers?

* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
Do you think dat I'll get wings if I follow Pa'ku?

==Completion==
I don't know about dis, <name>. De [[Wild Pterrorchick|pterrorchicks]] are pretty cute, but I'm not sure how I feel about heights.

==Notes==
Arriving at Pterror Rise:
:{{Text|say|Azala|Whoa... watch your step, <name>!}}
:{{Text|say|Azala|Look, dere's Pa'ku! She's bigger dan I imagined!}}
:{{Text|say|Azala|Dey say dat Pa'ku is de loa of de winds and de sea and de sky. Dey say dat she brings change!}}
:{{Text|say|Azala|But I also heard dat she is quick to anger. Let's not bother her.}}
:''Azala tags a [[Wild Pterrorchick]], they all scatter about as Azala runs around.''
:{{Text|say|Azala|Let's play with de chicks instead! Tag, you're it!}}
