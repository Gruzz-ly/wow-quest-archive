==Objectives==
Speak with [[Magister Umbric]] to be disguised as a [[blood troll]].
* Blood troll disguise complete

==Description==
We need you to kill several targets within [[Warport Rastari]], but we also cannot reveal that the [[Alliance]] is here.

Umbric has uncovered a ritual from [[Nazmir]] that will grant you a blood troll disguise. It is grim, but it must be done.

You will go through with the ritual, then use my invisibility flask to sneak into the Warport. 

If discovered, the [[Zandalari]] and [[Horde]] will think it's a bold attack from the blood trolls... and not from the Alliance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,790 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I know this is unpleasant, but it must be done.

==Completion==
I have to admit, this disguise is uncanny. Let's hope the zandalari believe they are dealing with a bold blood troll and not the Alliance.

==Notes==
