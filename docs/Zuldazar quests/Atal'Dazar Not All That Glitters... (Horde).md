==Objectives==
Travel to [[Atal'Dazar]] and find a replacement for the broken jewel.
* [[Eye of Dazar]]
* [[Yazma (tactics)|Yazma]] slain

==Description==
<You reference your notes on the shrine and discover that these jewels came from a "golden sanctuary".

Given your location, that can only mean Atal'Dazar. Perhaps you could find a replacement from that ancient city.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|93|60|}}
* 35,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<When you're done replacing the central gem, you think you might still be able to sell the old one.>

==Completion==
<Returning to the shrine, you begin to pluck the old gem from its holding place. As you do, the gem cracks again and shatters in your hands.

Apparently these gems are much more fragile than you originally thought.

Very carefully, you replace the gem you obtained into the slot.

Once affixed, the familiar pulse radiates once more from the shrine and the glow emanating from it confirms its restoration.>

==Notes==
Go up the first flight of stairs leading to Yazma's area; the quest item will be prominently in front of you. Grab it and continue on.

==Progression==
