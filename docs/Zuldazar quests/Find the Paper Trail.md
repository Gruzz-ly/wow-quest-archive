==Objectives==
Collect Orders From [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]].
* [[Orders from Gallywix]] {{co|35.3|66.7|Zuldazar}}

==Description==
The [[Halford Wyrmbane|High Commander's]] intelligence was confident that Trade Prince Gallywix is currently in [[Zuldazar]], but [[Void Tracker|my trackers]] could not locate him within the [[Bilgewater cartel|Bilgewater]] camp. He's most likely somewhere nearby.

[[Goblin]]s do not work for free. Someone is bound to be bossing around the rest of those miners. Locate whoever is in charge, eliminate them, and search for anything that might tell us where Gallywix is.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,310 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Did you find anything useful?

==Completion==
<[[Magister Umbric]] reads the orders you hand him and smiles.>

Gallywix is close!

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Dark Iron Grenadier|Ye wee elves be needin' some help with yer mission? Dark Irons can take care of it!}}

:{{text|say|Void Assassin|We have everything under control. Relax and enjoy your ale.}}
:{{text|say|Dark Iron Grenadier|Don't mind if I do.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Magister Umbric|I should've known that a goblin like Gallywix wouldn't be able to resist looting a city literally made of gold.}}
