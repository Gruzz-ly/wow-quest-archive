==Notes==
;Speaking with Magister Umbric
{{Dialogue|
Ah, <name>. Good. I am testing a hypothesis and have need of a... resilient... adventurer such as yourself to help.

We are experimenting with animating the fallen friends of the{{sic}} [[Zandalar]].

It is not a [[mana]] efficient method of combat, but I believe the psychological trauma on our enemy will make up for the cost. You see, the Zandalari have weak stomachs when it comes to animated corpses.

I need you to collect more materials for me to work with, but you can take two of my early voidcrafted tests to see how they work. Enjoy!

{{Gossip|Ready to test.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
''The player receives the Company of the Void buff and two [[Voidcrafted Ravasaur]]s as guardians.''
