==Objectives==
"Improve" 2 concoctions prepared by the Atal'Jamba [[acolyte]]s.
* Concoctions "Improved" (2)

==Description==
I am here primarily to deal with my [[Vol'jamba|wayward student]]. His followers, however, I will leave to you.

I have seen a possible future dat is... concerning. Rivers running red with poison, dead filling de streets. And dese... "[[Jambani]]" asserting themselves as de new rulers of [[Zuldazar]]. Dis cannot come to pass.

Fortunately for you, I know how to avoid dat fate. I think you will find their cauldrons are missing one key ingredient.

<He stares at you.>

Something to give it a little body, perhaps?

{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Spirit Twister's Band

We would not want dem to forego a crucial ingredient, would we?

Fight fire with fire, they say. Or in this case, poison with idiots who chew the ankles of their betters.
