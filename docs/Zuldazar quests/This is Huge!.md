==Objectives==
Listen to Megs and Morton's plan.
* Listen to [[Megs]] and [[Morton Cogswald|Morton]]'s plan

==Description==
<Name>, allow me to introduce Megs and Morton, the [[gnome]]s who are going to shake things up for the [[Alliance]] in a big way!

They've been perfecting a device that can take any ordinary [[animal]] and turn it into a humongous, unstoppable [[beast]] that we can then unleash on our enemies!

I'll let Megs and Morton fill you in on the specifics, but I promise you, this tech is a game changer!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Wait until you hear their big plan. It's perfect!

==Completion==
All up to speed, then?

==Notes==
