==Objectives==
Destroy 4 Sethrak Spires.
* [[Sethrak Spire (Zuldazar)|Sethrak Spire]] destroyed (4)

==Description==
It is good you have come. [[Dol'watha]] be under attack by these [[Sethrak|snake men]].

Soon as they arrived they started pulling these weird spire-things out de ground. I seen a bunch of snake-mons with feathers in their caps getting zapped by them, but they not be dying.

If it not be bad for them, that means it's good for them. And that be bad for us.

Destroy those spires. Hopefully whatever boon they be getting will go away and they will be easier to kill.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}} - {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 - 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
<Bladeguard Sonji shades her eyes as she peers toward the sky>

==Completion==
Not so much static in de air now. That's good. Means we did something right.
