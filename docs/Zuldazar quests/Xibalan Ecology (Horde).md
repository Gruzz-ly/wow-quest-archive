==Objectives==
Slay 8 Xibalan predators.
* [[Xibala]]n predator slain  (8)

==Description==
I had really hoped this area would be more hospitable.

The [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] have been no help whatsoever in clearing this space for archaeological exploration. Before we can even begin to uncover Xibala's secrets, we must make it safe for those less combat savvy to do their work.

You will find the ruins ahead infested with all manner of carnivorous [[beast]]s. The few intrepid [[Explorer (disambiguation)|explorers]] who ventured within have all failed to return.

Local ecology will not stand in the way of progress, <name>. Understand?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
How is it going? Are you whole?

==Completion==
I hear this region is very supportive of such life. Their numbers will recover... elsewhere.

==Notes==
Kill [[Xibalan Apex]]es, [[Xibalan Ravasaur]]s, and [[Young Xibalan Apex]]es.

==Progression==
{{Xibala Horde}}

==Patch changes==
