==Trivia==
*This quest is likely a reference to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language) Logo programming language], which was designed to teach children programming concepts. Its most famous application is commanding a turtle to move around and draw onscreen, which Loh himself does with his water trails.
