==Description==
I've looked over the readings my little boxes gave an' I think I know where to look next. The [[Ashes of Xibala]] are practically mine.

Ye'll want to meet me in the middle of the ruins, under that big ol' leerin' skull on the mountainside, to continue my survey.

Readin' these contraptions is hard work, an' I don't think we'll be alone up there.

Think ye can watch me back?

;Speaking with Morgrum
:The survey pointed to these ruins. The Horde camp is just down the hill to the northeast, so we best get in an' out as quick as we can.

:We'll get the Breath of Xibala before they can, I guarantee it.

:Speak when ye be ready to start surveying.
