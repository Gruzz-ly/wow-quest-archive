==Objectives==
Slay 6 [[Gilgoblin|Gilblins]] at the [[Scavenger's Strand]].
*[[Brackfin]] Gilbins slain (6)
*Speak with [[Trader Kro]].

==Description==
The [[naga]] sent their tiny, foul, muck-smelling minions into our camp. They are quite bothersome. 

If we do nothing, and their numbers continue to grow, they could pose a threat.

You look quick and handy. Could you perhaps expunge a few for us?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Hmm?

==Completion==
Maybe, some day, they will learn to think for themselves. Or at least choose a master more wisely.

==Notes==
*Eligible mobs are [[Brackfin Scavenger]]s and [[Brackfin Binder]]s.
