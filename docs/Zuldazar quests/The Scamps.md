==Objectives==
Stop 5 Street Scamps from stealing.
* [[Street Scamp]] stopped (5)

==Description==
You there! You have legs and a need for money? I wish to hire you.

Confounded, despicable, parentless [[child]]ren have been stealing my scrolls again. Those scrolls are dangerous in the wrong hands.

What is worse, I believe these junior vagabonds to be organized.

Find these street scamps and relieve them of their bounty, and I shall pay you for it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
It pains me to pay you for something I could have done myself when I was younger, but these legs do not move as swiftly as they once did.

==Progression==
