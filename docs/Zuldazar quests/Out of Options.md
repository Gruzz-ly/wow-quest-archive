==Objectives==
Kill 12 [[Bilgewater Cartel|Bilgewater]] [[goblin]]s within [[Gorilla Gorge]].
* Bilgewater [[Poacher]] slain  (12)

==Description==
My kind are hunted like [[animal]]s.

We've tried to reach a resolution through civil discourse, but these poachers recoil from rational thought. They revel in brutality.

I ask you, <name>: Who are the real animals?

It pains me to descend to their level, but I fear I've exhausted all other options.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* [[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (500x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
It pains me to descend to their level, but I fear I've exhausted all other options.

==Completion==
It's a shame we had to resort to violence, but I believe this was the only way.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Bilgewater Poacher]]s and [[Bilgewater Beastrider]]s. On the ground are [[Steel Trap (Zuldazar)|Steel Traps]]. Collect them (but be careful not to trap yourself in them) and use the extra button on the goblins to stun them.
