==Objectives==
Place the [[:Pterrordax Egg]] at the empty nest and wait for it to hatch.
* Egg placed in a suitable nest
* Egg hatched

==Description==
Hm. This egg does not belong to one of my brood, and I have no broodlings that need another sibling.

<[[Pa'ku]] might be smiling or snarling. She is showing an awful lot of teeth.>

You will care for this little one. And you had better hurry.

It will hatch very soon.

Oh, and a little advice. If you want the little one to like you, you had better be the first thing it sees upon hatching.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,930 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Completion==
<The tiny [[Pterrordax]] stares adoringly at you.>

Skreeeee.
