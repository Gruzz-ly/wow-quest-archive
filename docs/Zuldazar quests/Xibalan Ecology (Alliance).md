==Objectives==
Slay 12 Xibalan predators.
* [[Xibala]]n predator slain  (12)

==Description==
I want to take me boys out and really dig our picks in, but every [[scout]] I've sent into the ruins just came back half mauled to death.

Some didn't come back at all.

From what I can tell, the ruins are home to more'n just these spiky grass-eaters. Do you think you could be a peach an' thin their numbers a bit?

I'd caution ye against tamperin' with the local ecology an' all, but in the interest of not gettin' eaten I think I'll let ye make the call.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
How goes the hunt? Is it safe to enter the ruins yet?

==Completion==
Glad it weren't me, but here's a nice little reward for yer trouble!

==Notes==
*Kill [[Xibalan Apex]]es, [[Xibalan Ravasaur]]s, and [[Young Xibalan Apex]]es.

==Progression==
{{Xibala Alliance}}
