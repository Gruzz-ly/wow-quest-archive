==Objectives==
Rescue Gonk.
*[[Gonk]] rescued

==Description==
Gonk is in danger. I can hear his call.

My [[loa]] has saved my life so many times, it is about time I return de favor.

Come, join me at de [[Lair of Gonk]] on de west side of de [[Garden of the Loa]], and we will save a [[god]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
These zealots who follow Yazma do not fight like normal priests or traitors. Dey have dark magics, and have been planning this for a long time.

==Completion==
They seek to kill us. They seek to break us.

All they have done is unite us in what will be the greatest hunt the [[Zandalari]] have ever known.
