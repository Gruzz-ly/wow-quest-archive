==Objectives==
Board the [[:Huge Dragon Kite]] and take [[Kua'fon|your pterrordax]] on a flight to build his confidence.
* Ride the [[Huge Dragon Kite (NPC)|kite]]
* Confidence Built

==Description==
I just want you to know how unusual this is for [[Pa'ku]]. She prefers to teach on the fly.

What? It's true.

This method might work. Sometimes when young [[pterrordax]] are not eager to fly, their mother will drag them from the nest and hold them in her claws until they are comfortable enough to spread their wings.

Seeing as this little one has no mother, you will use the kite to act as one.

Pa'ku has placed a trail for you to follow.

Go and glide carefully- you may frighten your pterrordax more!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Completion==
<Pa'ku eyes your hatchling sourly.>

Are you sure we can't just throw him next time?

==Notes==
The objective is to fly through the rings of clouds. Avoid little gusts of air, which propel you backward and give the Trust Issues debuff.

;Fail
