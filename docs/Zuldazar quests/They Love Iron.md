;Kaz the Shrieker
:Dark Iron dwarves managed to rapid deploy a base nearby, cutting off a supply route. The fools think their iron mole machines will save them.

:The dwarves love their iron, almost as much as [["Tamed" Goren|my little acid mouthed friends]] here love iron.

:Take some of my friends here to feed on those mole machines.
