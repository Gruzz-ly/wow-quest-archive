[[File:Orders from Azshara - Makeshift Altar.jpg|thumb|The Makeshift Altar]]

==Objectives==
Take the Dagger to the Makeshift Altar.

* [[Ominous Whispering Dagger|Collect the whispering dagger]]
* Makeshift Altar found
* [[Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire (quest item)|Xal'atath]] placed

==Description==
<[[Collector Kojo|Kojo]] studies the medallion and grimaces.>

Ugh... [[naga]].

This medallion is inscribed with orders. Looks like naga have been commanded to invade our shores and seize artifacts of great power.

You know, I recently came upon one such object. See that dagger over there? Nasty thing. Gives me the willies. I swear I hear it whispering to me.

I found it nearby at [[Atal'Gral]], on a makeshift altar. Maybe if you take it there, you'll get an idea of how the naga intended to use it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<As you place the dagger upon the altar, it seems to shudder and blink at you.>

==Completion==
<You are filled with a sense of dread and foreboding.

This is probably a very bad idea.>

==Progression==
{{The Azsharan Medallion}}
