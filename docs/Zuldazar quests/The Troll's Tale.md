==Objectives==
Speak with the Captured Zandalari Troll to find out how the [[Alliance]] fleet was sunk.
* Speak with [[Captured Zandalari Troll]]

==Description==
You've arrived at an... interesting time, <class>. All of my ships have been destroyed. Half of my men are feeding the fishes, and the rest aren't doing much better. We're as good as doomed.

And still, the Alliance prevails.

These [[Zandalari troll]]s are to blame for this carnage. I need to know how they did it before we kill them all and escape from this [[Light]]-forsaken island.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Thom sneers at the Zandalari troll kneeling before him.>

Talk, you filthy brute!

==Completion==
Princess... [[Talanji]], you say? I see.

[[Anduin Wrynn|King Wrynn]] will be told about this. This Zandalari princess will learn what it means to make an enemy of the Alliance.

==Notes==
Speak with the [[Captured Zandalari Troll]]:
:You want to hear my story?

:I was on the flagship. I saw everyt'ing.

:Fine. I'll tell ya what happened. Better for ya to know. Better for ya to feel de fear.

:{{gossip|Tell us everything, Zandalari.}}

:{{text|bossemote|Zul the Prophet|Good, good. Our journey is almost over.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Nathanos Blightcaller|I hope the Warchief's faith is well-placed.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Zul the Prophet|She seems very powerful. Certain. In control.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Nathanos Blightcaller|It is an honor to serve my queen.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Zul the Prophet|My princess is also strong willed and sure of herself. Our king has always found her to be... challenging.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Princess Talanji|Oh mighty Rezan...as always, you come when I ask your aid.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Rezan|Speak and I will listen.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Talanji|I have sought the aid of the Horde, but my father may not agree with my actions. Advise! You are the loa of kings.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Rezan|My eyes see much... They see your boldness, your power, and enemies who fear both. And those who seek your demise are here!}}
:''The Alliance fleet is closing in on the Horde ship. Talanji walks out onto the top of the deck and casts a mighty spell, summoning Rezan! The dinosaur then charges towards the Alliance fleet, mowing them down. As the ship moves closer towards the shores of Zandalar, the Zandalari fleet can be sighted in the distance and Talanji gives the signal for the fleet to open fire on the Alliance.''
