==Objectives==
Rescue [[tortollan]]s captured by the [[Nazeshi]].
* [[Kono]] freed
* [[Rauloo the Hardened|Rauloo]] freed
* [[Akru]] freed
* [[Crosh]] freed
*Meet [[Deyon]] on the northeastern side of [[Covescale Rise]].

==Description==
[[Tidemistress Nazesh]] has been channeling on a rock they found in one of the pools above. She has been trying for days. They grow desperate.

The rest of my team was taken and locked up in cages. They want secrets from us that we do not know.

When they realize we tortollan cannot be coerced, I expect the [[naga]] will do something most dire.

Release the [[Tortollan Seekers|Seekers]]. We will thwart the naga plans together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Completion==
As long as my friends are safe, I can continue without worry. Many thanks, <class>.

;Kono freed
:{{Text|say|Kono|The naga are looking for something here. It will be for Azshara. We must stop them, or obfuscate their goal.}}

;Rauloo freed
:{{Text|say|Rauloo the Hardened|Back in the day, I could have handled a swarm of these slithering worms. They came at me in the dark. I was overrun! Their orders seem to be seem, boiled down, "Hurry, Azshara wants her prize!"}}

;Akru freed
:{{Text|say|Akru|These naga are afraid. Something else is driving them. This is not merely loyalty to Queen Azshara.}}

;Crosh freed
:{{Text|say|Crosh|It was just little murlocs here, then there was a storm, then naga streaming up the beach. They took me first, and I am rather embarrassed.}}
