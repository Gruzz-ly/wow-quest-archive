:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|Zandalar is beset by enemies, both within and without. Dis is why I went seeking de Horde... and why I call upon you, one of its greatest heroes.}}
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|[[Blood troll]]s surge across our northern border. Dey drag our people off to de swamps of Nazmir, never to be seen again.}}
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|Meanwhile, de [[Zanchuli Council]], scheming politicians and decrepit old tusks, dismisses dis threat. Dey convince [[Rastakhan|my father]] dat nothing need be done.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Casteless Zandalari]]|Talanji! Talanji!}}

:''The pair arrive at the foot of stairs in the city, guarded by [[General Jakra'zet]], [[Zanchuli Bladeguard]]s, [[Screaming Pterrordax]], and the [[Enforcer's Pterrordax]].''
:{{Text|say|General Jakra'zet|Princess.}}
