==Objectives==
Meet [[Kelsey Steelspark]] in Zuldazar.
* Speak to [[Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth]] to sail to [[Zuldazar]]

==Description==
I've received a report from Kelsey Steelspark. She claims to have discovered something that will aid our war effort.

She's refused to go into specifics, citing a need for secrecy with such sensitive intel.

It looks like you'll need to speak to her in person.

She's expecting you in [[Xibala]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Take a moment to prepare yourself. I've got huge news!

==Notes==
;Approach
: {{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Good, you're here. Let's not waste any time.}}

;Accept
: {{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Do not delay. Whatever Kelsey has discovered could be key to gaining a tactical advantage in this war.}}

At Xibala, Kelsey is standing with two other gnomes by a gnome table, on which appears to be a [[Gnomish Mind Control Cap]].
