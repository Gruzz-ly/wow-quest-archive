==Objectives==
Find and rescue Kua'fon in the [[Slough]].
* [[Kua'fon]] rescued

==Description==
Ah, there you are.

Kua'fon ran off into de jungle. I saw him head down de western path out of the [[Warbeast Kraal|Kraal]] but beyond that I could not say where he may have gone.

This kind of thing happens with the young. Our winged companions have a keen sense of adventure!

It would be helpful if yours could fly, but it is not yet time. I would check any reasonably high place that he could climb to, as a start.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Kua'fon seems mighty pleased with himself.>

Skree.

==Notes==
He can spawn at various points in the targeted area. Sometimes, it is enough to approach him, on other days, you need to click on [[Long Stick]]s.

==Progression==
