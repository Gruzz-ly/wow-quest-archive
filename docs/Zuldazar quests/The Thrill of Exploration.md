==Objectives==
Help [[Acadia Chistlestone]] recover a Xibalan fossil.
*Fossil Revealed (100%)

==Description==
Name's Acadia, Acadia Chistlestone!

I represent the interests of the [[Explorer's League]] at this site. Where there's dirt to be turned, we're happy to do the digging!

<Acadia's smile falters.>

These [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron]], though, they're keen on delving deeper and faster than I'm comfortable with. Since you're a strong, capable member of the [[Alliance]], do you think you could ah... lead by example?

Go on, there's a fresh fossil here that could use some attention.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Acadia tells me you're in charge, now. We'll see about that.

==Completion==
We both know ye didn't really want all that dirt under yer nails.

Yer welcome.

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Acadia Chistlestone|To think the trolls were squattin' on the archaeological find of the century!}}
:{{Text|say|Excavator Morgrum Emberflint|Keep yer bones. There's power here, I can taste it. We'll take it right out from under the Horde's nose.}}

Interact with [[Dirt Pile]]s.

:{{Text|say|Acadia Chistlestone|Mind yer hands, now. Slow and steady.}}
:{{Text|say|Acadia Chistlestone|Try not to damage it. Aye, like that...}}
:{{Text|say|Acadia Chistlestone|Aaaahhh... now look at that. Ye'll make a proper archaeologist yet!}}
:{{Text|say|Excavator Morgrum Emberflint|Really? Ye mean to do it all with yer hands?}}
:{{Text|say|Excavator Morgrum Emberflint|Go on and give me elemental a tap. It'll get this done for ye.}}
:{{Text|say|Acadia Chistlestone|Wait!}}

Now you can interact with the [[Excavation Elemental]] to finish up the bar.

:{{Text|say|Excavator Morgrum Emberflint|Good. Now, on to the real work.}}
:{{Text|say|Acadia Chistlestone|You scratched it! We can't display it in this state!}}
:{{Text|say|Excavator Morgrum Emberflint|Aye, lass, it's not that bad.}}

==Progression==
