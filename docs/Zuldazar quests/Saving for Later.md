==Objectives==
Conceal the antiquities of [[Gral]].
* [[Fetishes of Gral]] disguised
* [[Chest of Pearls]] disguised
* [[Cask of Blessed Water]] disguised
* [[Gral's Tooth]] disguised
* [[Voice of the Ocean]] disguised
* [[Scroll of Illusion]] (provided)

==Description==
We need time to recover the artifacts from this place. Time the [[naga]] will not let us have.

However, we do have a plan.

We simply hide what we don't want them to find, and then come back in a decade or two. They will have forgotten about this place by then.

Take this illusion scroll and use it to conceal the notable artifacts of power.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
How is that scroll working out?

==Completion==
Naga may be long lived, but their attention spans are not what they once were.

These antiquities should remain safe and preserved until we return.

==Notes==
