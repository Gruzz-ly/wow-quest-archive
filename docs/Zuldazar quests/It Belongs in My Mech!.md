==Objectives==
Recover [[:Azerite]] from Azerite slimes using the Azerite Vacuumizer.
*Azerite pack fueled
*[[Azerite Vacuumizer]] (provided)

==Description==
Check this out! It's my latest creation that someone else came up with and built, [[G.M.O.D|Gallywix's Mech of Death]]!

I got it fueled with all that Azerite you found, but I still need more of the stuff to give it that extra kick.

I was SUPPOSED to have the stuff from our operations here, but there's some sorta Azerite goop causin' a mess!

My guy [[Patch (goblin)|Patch]] made an Azerite vacuum device. I want you to suck the Azerite outta these [[Ooze|slimes]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
*[[Glowing Azerite Crystal]] (250x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
You done yet?

==Completion==
That's what I'm talkin' about! This bad boy is gonna be fueled up in no time.

==Notes==
Use the quest item at the [[Azerite Muck]]s.
