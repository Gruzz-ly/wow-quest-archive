{{questportrait|Urda Direflame.png|Urda Direflame|The one responsible for stealing the Eye of Xibala right out from under your nose. The nerve.}}
==Objectives==
Slay Urda Direflame and then place a telemancy beacon near the [[Eye of Xibala]].
* [[Urda Direflame]] slain
* [[Telemancy Beacon (Zuldazar)|Telemancy beacon]] placed

==Description==
They must not keep the Eye, <name>.

Fortunately I am more than an archaeologist. I am a [[telemancer]]. [[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]] himself trained the woman who trained my master. I can retrieve the relic with these arts.

All you need to do is place a telemancy beacon near the Eye. I can then retrieve both it AND you safely back to camp. The [[Alliance]] will find themselves empty-handed.

While you're at it, do deliver my "thanks" to the individual responsible for snatching the Eye out from under us.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Reliquary Explorer's Drape
|Rastari Treads
|Zanchuli Footwraps
|Torcalin Treads
|Jambani Treads
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
Did you find the source of the disruption?

==Completion==
Ahhh... it must be so disheartening to be at the mercy of such magics. Well done.
