==Objectives==
Put some [[voodoo]] on [[Cala Cruzpot|Cala]]'s formula using [[Witch Doctor Jangalar|Witchdoctor Jangalar]]'s [[Voodoo Cauldron|cauldron]].
* [[Voodoo'ed Aggression Formula]]
* [[Aggression Formula]] (provided)

==Description==
Well, I admit that I feel a little better about this. If Witch Doctor Jangalar's voodoo can make [[Gentle Ben'jin|Ben'jin]] react correctly, as the science says he should, then what do we have to lose?

Bless my formula or hex it or whatever they call it with Jangalar's voodoo cauldron.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
Will voodoo make it smell funny? Nevermind, idle musings.

==Completion==
The consistency is the same... does it seem a little carbonated to you now?

Can't wait to see if this works better than the original formula which, I feel like I need to say, SHOULD have worked fine.
