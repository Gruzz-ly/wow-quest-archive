* [[Pack of Pterrordax Snacks]]
* [[Hungry Pterrordax]] Ridden

==Description==
<As you approach, the blind [[Zandalari]] motions at you impatiently.>

It sounds like ya be headed somewhere in a hurry, little weed!

Sit down and share a tale with an old troll before ya head out on ya next adventa.

I went on many adventas with my pterrordax when I was young. Explored dis whole valley!

My pterrordax died many years ago, but...

<Blind Tra'wala smiles mischievously.>

Sometimes at night, I steal da guards' snacks to trick dese old pterrordaxes into lettin' me ride again. Ha!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
<A hungry pterrordax will happily carry anyone who feeds it.>

==Completion==
<As long as you have snacks to offer, these hungry pterrordaxes will carry you in and out of the city anytime!>

== Notes ==
;Hungry Pterrordax Ridden
<The pterrordax sniffs the air and waits for your next action.>

{{gossip|<Offer a snack to the pterrordax and climb into its saddle.>}}

Just up the steps nearby is guard room or small barracks with sleeping [[Off-Duty Guard]]s. Walk in and simply take the bag of snacks from the table. Ride the pterrordax and the quest is complete. You will be 'marked' as having completed the quest and can go for a ride at anytime.

You will be flown up to the [[Terrace of the Chosen]] and dropped off at {{coords|49.58|14.94|Dazar'alor}}. You can safely go down into the [[Altar of Akunda]] and possibly find a chest inside. When you're done looking around, just ride the pterrordax back down to [[The Sliver]].
