==Objectives==
Recover 9 Firelands Slag from the beach in [[Xibala]].
* [[Firelands Slag]] (9)

==Description==
With me [[shaman]] still in their conveyances, a vital component o' our upcomin' ritual remains scattered among the supplies.

I can only hope the [[Horde]] haven't taken 'em. They're rare an' precious...

If you see any glowin' objects out there, recover 'em. They're o' tremendous value.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I wasn't worried about 'em bein' broken. A little fire'd never hurt those rocks.

==Completion==
Couple o' scorch marks here an' there, but nothin' out o' the ordinary. These'll do nicely.

==Notes==
On return:
:{{text|say|[[Thaelin Darkanvil]]|Careful what ye summon, Anvil-Thane.}}
:{{text|say|Anvil-Thane Thurgaden|Calm yer quaverin' beard, Thaelin. I'm not as foolish as [[Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan]] was.}}
:{{text|say|Anvil-Thane Thurgaden|We're drawin' power from the [[Firelands]], but nothin' dangerous will heed this call.}}
