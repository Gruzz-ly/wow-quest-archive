==Objectives==
Slay 8 Venomous Diemetradons.
* [[Venomous Diemetradon]] slain (8)

==Description==
We are competing, you and I and these other savages.

I find this... amusing.

South of here you will find a number of [[diemetradon]]s. I challenge you, <class>, to slay more of these creatures than I.

Do you accept my wager?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<It does not seem as though Tracker Burke was prepared for what befell him. He appears to be covered in small punctures and lacerations.

Fortunately for you, he appears to have stashed his wager in his hat.>
