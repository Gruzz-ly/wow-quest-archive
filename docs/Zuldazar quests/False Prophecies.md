==Objectives==
Return to [[King Rastakhan]] at [[Dazar'alor]].

==Description==
Now dat dis nuisance is out of de way, I can return my focus to de city. [[Zuldazar]] has languished while I was away.

You should return to Rastakhan. Let de king know dat his will has been carried out and dat dis false prophet is no more.

You might think to share [[Vol'jamba]]'s prophecy with him, if you feel it worth his notice. I cannot say it will change anything at all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
