==Objectives==
Meet [[Shandris Feathermoon]] on the deck of [[Gral's Call]].
* Travel to Gral's Call upper deck
* Assess situation with Shandris Feathermoon
*Tell [[Halford Wyrmbane|Halford]] to blow up the ship
*Report back to King [[Anduin Wrynn]] in [[Stormwind City]].

==Description==
Let's return to the upper decks and see what our current status is. Shandris should be there by now.

I know Shandris and [[Falstad Wildhammer|Falstad]] well enough that they will be there with the [[Captain Zalkran|captain]] of this ship, dead or alive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,310 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Core]] (800x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
What is it?

==Completion==
<Name>! I only just received the message of your success in [[Zandalar]]. Well done.

I'm sorry for everything that you've been put through on behalf of [[Fourth War|this war]]. We have only one option if we want to stop the [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] from aiding the [[Horde]].

When the time is right, we will send [[Alliance navy|our fleets]] to Zandalar. Your hard work will ensure we have a breach in their defenses to begin our invasion.

Thank you once more, <name>. We owe a great debt to you and your allies.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Shandris
{{Gossip|Shandris, can you give me a status report?}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Captain Zalkran was attempting to flee to [[Zuldazar]], but Falstad and I subdued him.}}
:{{Text|say|Captain Zalkran|[[Alliance]] dogs! Kill me now and be done with it!}}
:{{Text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|No. There has been enough killing today, captain. We're taking you [[prisoner]], back to [[Stormwind City|Stormwind]].}}
:{{Text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|You can either fight us the entire way or cooperate with us, the choice is yours.}}
:{{Text|say|Captain Zalkran|My people will free me from your jails, just as [[Horde|they]] [[The Stormwind Extraction|did]] Princess [[Talanji]] and [[Zul]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|I would love to see them try. Now, towards other matters.}}
:{{Text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|We need this ship destroyed. Shandris, help our remaining forces prepare to leave.}}
:{{Text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Understood.}}
:{{Text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|[[Magister Umbric|Umbric]], we'll need one last [[void]] rift to get all our forces out of here.}}
:{{Text|say|Magister Umbric|We will make it back safely... including the prisoner.}}
:{{Text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|[[John J. Keeshan|Keeshan]], [[Kelsey Steelspark|Kelsey]], rig the ship to explode once everyone is out.}}
:{{Text|say|John J. Keeshan|Now we're at my favorite part.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Now we're at my favorite part!}}
:{{Text|say|John J. Keeshan|... You and I need to talk about our shared interests after this.}}
:{{Text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|<Name>, give the word when you're ready for us to begin preparations to blow this ship up. Afterwards, I want you to report our success to [[Anduin Wrynn|King Wrynn]].}}
:{{Text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|The rest of us will meet you there when this is all done to help with any debriefing that is necessary.}}

;Speaking with Halford
{{Gossip|Halford, let's begin the process to blow up this ship.}}
:''A cutscene shows the Alliance forces on the beach as they look at the burning ship.''

;On completion
:''Kelsey, John, Halford, Shandris, Umbric, and Falstad appear in front of King Wrynn in [[Stormwind Keep]].''
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Champion, you have spearheaded a long campaign against a relentless foe. What's more, you have faced the Horde with courage... and honor.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I wish I could say our work was done, but there remains much more ahead of us. I fear the days shall grow darker... before they can grow brighter.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|The Alliance must ask even more of you, <name>. It is clear that we cannot hope to end the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|warchief's]] reign until we sever her ties to the Zandalari. That day will come... soon.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|But for now, at least, know that you serve as an inspiration to those around you. And for that, hero, you have my thanks.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|For the Alliance!}}
:''All but Shandris turn and go away.''
