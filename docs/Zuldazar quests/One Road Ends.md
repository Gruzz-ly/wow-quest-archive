==Objectives==
Restore the southern wayshrine and assist any travelers you come across.
* [[Wanderer's Wayshrine|Southern Wayshrine]] restored
* Speak to [[Koo'li]]
* [[Spinethrash]] slain

==Description==
<A warm voice enters your mind.>

There is one more wayshrine in this region that requires your attention.

Follow this road until you near its end at the [[Port of Zandalar]].

It is there, at the start and end of so many journeys, that one of my most trafficked shrines was established. Restore it and see that any weary travelers have my blessing.

We will speak again when you are finished.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Roo'li... Oh, Roo'li....

==Completion==
I should have protected him, but he stood his ground. Fierce little thing.

<Koo'li pats [[Roo'li]]'s head.>

==Notes==
;Interacting with the shrine

:{{Text|emote|The Child of Torcali gently noses Roo'li.}}

;Speaking with Koo'li
:<Koo'li wipes at her eyes.>
:I should have known better than to walk so close to de river. He tried to warn me, he tried to stop it...
:Koo'li sobs quietly.>

:{{Gossip|What happened?}}
:Roo'li is is dead and I failed to protect him. But maybe...
:<Koo'li looks to your direhorn comapnion.>
:You can prevent this from happening again. Kill de beast known as Spinethrash. Work together. Let no one else suffer as my poor Roo'li suffered.

:{{Gossip|I'll handle this.}}
