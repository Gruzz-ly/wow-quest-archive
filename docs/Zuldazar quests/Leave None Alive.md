==Objectives==
Kill 10 Zandalari soldiers on board the [[Gral's Call]].
* [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] slain (10)

==Description==
Our initial assault was a success. The [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron dwarves]] are holding the line. Now it's our turn.

You and I must cleave a path through these Zandalari and eliminate them. Our forces will handle any that remain.

Our goal is to weaken their forces and find two important targets: the ship's captain and its advisor.

Let's go, <name>. If we fail here, all of our efforts will be thwarted.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
We don't have time to talk!

==Completion==
Good work, that should be enough for the others to handle. We have one final target.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Zandalari Honorguard]]s and [[Zandalari Hexxer]]s.

==Progression==
{{The Strike on Zuldazar}}
