==Description==
Your [[Horde]] has grown powerful, eclipsing some of de [[troll]] empires in its magnitude.

For saving [[Talanji|my daughter]], you have earned de right to a presence in [[Zuldazar|my city]].

Since my daughter has taken such a fondness to you, you may join her in de [[Great Seal]] beneath us. De servants there will answer to you now.

[[Zolani]] can show you a way down dat does not involve falling.

*[[Welcome to Zandalar]]

==Progress==
We have much to do. Let us not waste any time.

==Completion==
My father believes he is indulging me. He has ruled for two hundred years, many lifetimes of trolls. In his mind, de threats dat face our kingdom are minor.

I have seen too much to believe dat.

So since my father and his advisors would not help, I turned to someone who would.

[[Sylvanas Windrunner|Your warchief]] needs our fleet, and I need her champions. I have a battle plan here on what to do.

Choose your first move. If de Horde helps my people, den I will help de Horde.

==Notes==
Rastakhan has unique gossip text:
:My daughter believes de threats in [[Nazmir]] are so great dat we must throw our entire army at our northern border.
:She is young and impatient. She does not understand dat de [[blood troll]]s have pestered our people for generations.
:If she believes de Horde can help her, den I look forward to seeing what you will accomplish. She could use experience in dealing with foreign powers.
:If she comes to harm, know dat I will burn your Horde to ash and turn dat pitiful collection of rowboats you call a fleet to floating debris.
:Good luck.

Get to Zolani, nearby:
:{{Text|say|Zolani|Follow me. I can lead you to de easiest way down.}}
:''She walks inside and stops before an elevator.''
:{{Text|say|Zolani|Dis will take you to de chamber below where Princess Talanji is waiting for you. Mind de step.}}

Downstairs:
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|I was able to arrange for your companions to be flown here without [[General Jakra'zet]] interfering. You need only signal dem.}}

Head outside and plant the Horde Banner. [[Nathanos Blightcaller]] and a small squad arrive. Return to Talanji:
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|Come, hero. Let me show you around.}}
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|It is said de Great Seal is one of de only things still standing dat is older than de [[Zandalari Empire]].}}
:{{Text|say|Brillin the Beauty|Need to bind your Hearthstone?}}
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|My father keeps many of his treasures here in de royal vault.}}
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|You can find your [[nightborne]] friend in de [[Hall of Ancient Paths]]. Come see me when you are done looking around.}}

Head down the ramp to the right to enter the [[Royal Treasury]], a full-service bank. [[Natal'hakata]] is standing here and has a unique gossip text:
:Hmm, a lowly <class>. Know dat I am Natal'hakata. THE Natal'hakata.

:I am de Voice of the King, deliverer of de royal will, keeper of de grand schedule, and wall against de peasantry dat constantly tries to interfere with my lord's patience.

:My time is precious, so speak quickly.

Cross to the left to find [[Thalyssra]] channeling a portal in the Hall of Ancient Paths:
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Princess Talanji was kind enough to inform us of an old portal network we might be able to tap into.}}
:''[[Baine Bloodhoof]] and [[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]] pop out.''
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|For the Horde!}}
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Why hello.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Oculeth, see what you can do with the portal system here. We will need supply lines to the Horde capitals.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Champion, you seem to be on the right track for gaining the trust of the [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]]. I must attend to my other duties. Good luck.}}
:''Thalyssra teleports away.''

Speak with [[Brillin the Beauty]] if you want to complete the optional objective:
:{{Gossip icon|inn|quest=|Make this inn your home.}}

Find Princess Talanji upstairs to continue.

Upon completion, the [[Scouting Map]] becomes available to offer:
;[[Zuldazar (quest)]]
:Earn the trust of King Rastakhan and the [[Zanchuli Council]].
;[[Nazmir (quest)]]
:Journey with Princess Talanji to the dark swamps of Nazmir to put an end to the threat of the blood trolls.
;[[Vol'dun (quest)]]
:General Jakra'zet's secrets lie somewhere in the sands. Head into the dunes and recover proof that will help remove him from power.

Choosing and completing one of the quests also makes [[The War Campaign (Horde)]] available.
