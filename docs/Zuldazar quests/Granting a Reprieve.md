==Objectives==
Slay 8 [[Forsaken]] and 8 [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] in [[Talanji's Rebuke]].
* Forsaken slain (8)
* Zandalari slain (8)

==Description==
Now, on to more pressing matters.

The Forsaken have shown up and are preventing us from saving our people. All my soldiers are either injured, exhausted, or in no shape for fighting.

It seems these trollish natives have joined them as well. I am spread too thin.

Kill the [[Horde]]. Kill the Zandalari. Kill them all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
A bit of a breather. Let's hope it's enough.

==Completion==
A few less cretins to worry about.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Forsaken Deathguard (Zuldazar)|Forsaken Deathguards]], [[Bleak Conjurer]], [[Zandalari Quickblade]]s, and [[Zandalari Axe Thrower]]s.

On completion of all five:

;Objectives
*Slay 15 Forsaken

;Description
Finally! Reinforcements!

This is a complete disaster. It's bad enough that the prisoners got away. It's even worse that our ship was destroyed and we have no way back to Stormwind. And I don't even know what that GHOST DINOSAUR thing was!

Now the Forsaken have shown up and ate preventing us from saving our people. All my soldiers are either injured, exhausted, or in no shape for fighting.

Kill the Horde and push them back.
