==Objectives==
Ride with [[Gonk]] to the [[Temple of the Prophet]].
* Ride with the [[Warpack]]

==Description==
[[Zul]] began a coup, but he did not secure de pyramid for himself. Nor has he done anything to rally more to his banner outside of those who were already conspiring with him.

Dis concerns me more than if he had carved his face into [[Dazar'alor]] itself.

We must learn what he is up to. Join de disciples of Gonk and ride ahead to de Temple of the Prophet. Look to Wardruid Loti for further orders when you arrive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Completion==
Blood calls out for blood.

==Notes==
Upon accept, [[Wardruid Loti]] comes and turns into the raptor.
:{{Text|Come, hero. For dis, you will want to hold on tight!}}

Interact with Loti and hop on her.
