==Description==
Something is wrong, <name>.

My [[Rastakhan|king]] is blessed by de [[loa]] in ways your kind cannot imagine. He has been given long life, swift healing, and strength beyond most [[troll]]s. But still, he lingers on death's door. I can practically hear [[Bwonsamdi]] laughing.

Two of his most trusted menders are with him. Go and find out what is taking so long.

I will make sure dey are not interrupted.
