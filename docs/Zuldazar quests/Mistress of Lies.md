{{questportrait|Vol'kaal.jpg|Vol'kaal|Formerly of the Zanchuli Council.}}
Defeat Yazma and Vol'kaal in the [[Garden of the Loa]].
* [[Vol'kaal]] defeated
* [[Yazma]] defeated

==Description==
If you are done dealing with dese peasant [[loa]], den perhaps you can help with my own loa: [[Shadra]].

My "high" priestess, Yazma, is behind all of dis. If she is having her minions slay other loa, den I can only guess she is also trying to sacrifice my own loa as well.

Shadra's shrine is on de northwest side of de Garden of the Loa. You must stop her from slaying de Mistress of Spies.

You will also receive:

==Completion==
Shadra was... consumed? I have heard of such heresies in [[Zul'Drak]], but to hear of it in [[Zuldazar]]...

==Notes==
Accept:

[[Acolyte Mali]]run to the edge of the cliff and then transform and fly away.

By the time you arrive, Shadra has been subdued by Yazma and cannot be moved.
