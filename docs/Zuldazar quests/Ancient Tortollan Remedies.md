==Objectives==
Collect an envenomed puffer spine, a [[brutosaur]] scale, and aged [[crab]] foam for [[Jol the Ancient]].
* [[Envenomed Puffer Spine]]
* [[Brutosaur Scale]]
* [[Aged Crab Foam]]

==Description==
Ah, yes, the situation is urgent. We must act quickly, but not hastily.

There is a way to save [[Rastakhan]], but it will require three very specific ingredients. Listen well, young one.

The first, foam bubbling from the mouth of a crab. The older, the better.

The second, the spine of a [[puffer fish]]. Venomous!

The third, a brutosaur scale.

Why? These are the secrets of my people, <name>. Longevity is cultivated like the rarest of flowers... carefully, and with much practice.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
The quality of the healing depends very much on the quality of the ingredients.

==Completion==
They are satisfactory. I will explain in due time what they are for.
