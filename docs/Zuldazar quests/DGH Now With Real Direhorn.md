==Objectives==
Collect 8 Partially-Digested Direhorn Flesh.
*[[Partially Digested Direhorn Flesh]] (8)

==Description==
...Listen, <name>. I need one more thing to finish making this supplement of mine.

[[Direhorn Growth Hormone]] can't exactly be made without, you know, actual [[direhorn]]. But I floated the idea of harvesting a few of their beasts and all of a sudden I got a bunch of spears pointed at me.

So I came up with another plan.

Those flying beasts eat direhorns, right? The big green flappy ones. I'm sure if you kill a few of them you'll find all the direhorn bits I need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
We'll keep this between you and me, okay?

==Completion==
Let's not talk about this ever again. Deal?
