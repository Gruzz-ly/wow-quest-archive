==Objectives==
Collect all of [[Koba]]'s treasures.
* [[Amphibious Lab Enclosure]]
* [[Hatchling's First Alchemy Stone]]
* [[Spitzy (quest item)]]

==Description==
My adults are in the field doing some research. So I stay here, patiently waiting, as they told me to do.

These monsters came and took my special treasures! They took my best friend in the whole world, my slug, Spitzy!

They took them all. They ran far. I do not move fast...

Could you please get them back, and find my family?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Spitzy (toy)]]
* {{cost|17|60|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
My hatchling... if they laid a finger on him...

==Completion==
Koba's favorite things! I do hope he stayed put. He is filled with such haste.

Thank you, <race>, my boy and I will be reunited soon.

Also, Spitzy asks that you take this little sluglet with you on all your adventures.
