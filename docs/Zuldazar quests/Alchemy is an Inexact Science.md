* [[Incandescent Dustwing]] slain (8)
* [[Dustwing Incandescence]] (8)

==Description==
Hey, look.

[[Direhorn Growth Hormone|It]] worked, right? Mostly. I mean, it DID get bigger. Don't look at me like that! So there are some... weird side effects going on. When has that ever gotten in the way of science before?

Okay, okay, okay!

I have an idea. Go and get me everything on this list. And be quick about it! I think these [[Zandalari]] might do something to me if you-- if WE-- don't fix this.

<Alexxi hastily pens a list of ingredients and hands it to you.>

Do me a solid, eh?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Those claws look really sharp, <name>. Do you have what I need?

==Completion==
Whew! Maybe this will calm them down.
