==Objectives==
Kill 12 [[Bilgewater Cartel|Bilgewater]] [[goblin]]s and open Void Tears to summon [[void elf]] allies.
* Bilgewater goblin slain (12)
* [[Void Tear (Zuldazar)|Void Tear]] opened (optional)

==Description==
I have met very few goblins that I respect, but I must give them universal credit for one thing: they are persistent.

The Bilgewater Cartel, [[Jastor Gallywix|Trade Prince Gallywix's]] gang, has already sent a full set of replacement miners to extract [[:Azerite]] from the beach site nearby.

I am certain the Alliance will be pleased if you interrupt their mining operations again.

My regiment is available to aid you, but our combat tactics are unconventional. When you wish our help, call into the Void and we will answer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
The Bilgewater Cartel has squandered much on their lust and greed.

==Completion==
I do not doubt that those goblins will be replaced, like the ones you previously dealt with.

But we have at least set back their progress and given our allies here additional breathing room.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Dark Iron Grenadier|Ye wee elves be needin' some help with yer mission? Dark Irons can take care of it!}}
:{{text|say|Void Assassin|Thank you, my dirt-stained friend, but we move more quickly on our own.}}
:{{text|say|Void Assassin|We have everything under control. Relax and enjoy your ale.}}
:{{text|say|Dark Iron Grenadier|Don't mind if I do.}}

Eligible mobs are [[Bilgewater Driller]]s, [[Bilgewater Boomer]]s, and [[Bilgewater Hauler]]s.

;Void Tear activated
:''A [[Void Assassin]], [[Void Speaker]], or a [[Void Tracker]] with a [[Voidstalker (Zuldazar)‎|Voidstalker]] emerges.''
*{{Text|say|Void Speaker|They'll cower before the [[Void]].}}
*{{Text|say|Void Tracker|I've seen them through the veil. Follow me.}}
*{{Text|say|Void Assassin|Come here, little goblins...}}
