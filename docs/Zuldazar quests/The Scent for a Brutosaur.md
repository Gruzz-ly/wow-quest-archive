Mood is everything for love, and Maka'fon is not in de mood.

Certain fragrant rushes work best, and de jungle will provide. 

[[Zandalari]] rushes grow near de waters here. Get a good amount for me and I will make an incense bundle big enough to set de mood.

* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

Well done! I will weave dese rushes into incense bundles and cast my best spells upon dem.
