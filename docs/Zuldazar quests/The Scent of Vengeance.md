==Objectives==
Gather 12 Traitor's Blood from [[Zul]]'s followers in [[Zeb'ahari]].
*[[Traitor's Blood]] (12)

==Description==
I know [[Rastakhan|my king]], and I know he is not weak willed. His [[ghost|spirit]] struggles under de weight of dis betrayal, and confusion roots his spirit too close to death for my comfort.

We will need to remind him of his purpose. His anger.

I have heard shouts of terror from de [[village]] below. Zul's [[Atal'zul|followers]] torment Zeb'ahari while dey hunt for him. Slay those who would harm his people and bring me their blood.

Perhaps de scent of vengeance can revive de [[devilsaur]] inside ol' Rastakhan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
I hope we are not too late, <name>.

==Completion==
De scent of blood is a reliable way to wake a devilsaur. De blood of traitorous wretches, even moreso.
