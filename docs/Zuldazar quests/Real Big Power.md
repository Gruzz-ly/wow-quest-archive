==Objectives==
Test the Embiggifier on a Kul Tiran Clucker.
* [[Embiggifier]] tested
* [[Kul Tiran Clucker]] slain
* [[Embiggifier Core]] (provided)

==Description==
We're still building a harness for the Embiggifier, but we need to test its core first. That's where the real power is!

This [[technology]] is years ahead of the [[Horde]]'s, but it's so easy to use that even an [[orc]] could do it!

Just point and click!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
*[[Small Azerite Shard]] (115x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
I love this part! When we get to see all our hard work pay off in a big way!

==Completion==
I thought that might happen. 

That poor clucker's mind wasn't strong enough to withstand the Embiggifier, but otherwise, it's working as intended!

==Notes==
Aiming the core at a nearby chicken, an electrical beam is focused on it. It grows bigger and attacks you but is easily killed.

==Progression==
{{The Sleeper Agent}}
