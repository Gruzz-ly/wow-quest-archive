==Objectives==
Speak to [[Torcali]].

==Description==
I have seen such fervor only once before.

In times of peril, Torcali may call upon her children to defend her and those she looks after.

It is likely she called your beast away. Go to her and see how you can help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Torcali's voice enters your mind.>

I have called and you have come once again, <name>. We have little time to waste.

==Progression==
{{Child of Torcali}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.2.0|note=Added.}}
