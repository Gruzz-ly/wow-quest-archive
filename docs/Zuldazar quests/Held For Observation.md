==Objectives==
Administer the remedy to [[Direhorn Juvenile|your direhorn]].
* [[Trader Alexxi Cruzpot|Alexxi]]'s remedy administered
* [[Alexxi's Foolproof Remedy]] (provided)

==Description==
<Trader Alexxi hurriedly combines the ingredients.>

That should do it. Go on and get this down your [[direhorn]]'s gullet.

Don't worry, nothing could possibly go wrong with a concoction made under any kind of duress. Also, do I seem like the kind of [[goblin]] who would give you something dangerous?

On purpose?

... Don't answer that. Hurry, before they stab me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,790 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<The direhorn hiccoughs in distress.>

==Completion==
<[[Beastlord L'kala]] peers mistrustfully at Alexxi, then back at you.>

None of this was necessary. Go. I need time to determine what is to be done about your direhorn.
