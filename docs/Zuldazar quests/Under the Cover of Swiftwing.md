Easy, right?

==Notes==
;Mounting Swiftwing
:''[[John J. Keeshan|Keeshan]], [[Kelsey Steelspark|Kelsey]], and [[Falstad Wildhammer|Falstad]] hop on the gryphon with you.''
:{{Text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|Hold on tight, we gotta get REAL high to avoid detection!}}
:{{Text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|There! This should be high enough to avoid the Zandalari spottin' us.}}
:{{Text|say|John J. Keeshan|That [[Alliance]] camp stands out like a sore thumb. We need to be ready for when the Zandalari discover us.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Why do you think Halford is moving so fast? He knows we're doomed if the Zandalari catch us in their home.}}
:{{Text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|Aye. Finding a small number, like <name> over here, is one thing. But if they see the whole bleedin' camp?}}
:{{Text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|They'd feed us to their pet [[dinosaur]]s. We'd be chewed to tiny little pieces.}}
:{{Text|say|John J. Keeshan|I was almost [[Darkblaze|eaten]] once. I don't recommend it.}}
:{{Text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|Ye don't have te tell me twice. I be droppin' ye all off on the Isle of Fangs. It be far enough from the [[Zuldazar|city]] that ye can act with some impunity against them Zandalari.}}
:{{Text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|Ye just need te make sure they don't see ye plantin' those bombs at the base of their ships.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|I'll be working on a device to help <name> get across the water for the next part of this plan.}}
:{{Text|say|John J. Keeshan|And I'll be helping <name> by planting Kelsey's bombs on the smaller ships... and gutting any Zandalari that see me.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|You're a man after my own heart, Keeshan. We'll have to compare knife collections after this.}}
:{{Text|say|John J. Keeshan|You have a knife collection?}}
:{{Text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|A? No no no, I have SEVERAL knife collections.}}
:{{Text|say|John J. Keeshan|...  This might be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.}}

:''You, John, and Kelsey are dropped.''
:{{Text|say|Falstad Wildhammer|This be yer stop. Be careful and remember, plant the bombs and don't let 'em alert the mainland about yer presence!}}
