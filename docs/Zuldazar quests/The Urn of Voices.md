==Objectives==
Collect 30 Ounces of Soul from enemies within [[Tal'gurub]].
* [[Ounces of Soul]] (30)

==Description==
[[Vol'jamba]] does possess de [[Sight]], and so even now he is taking precautions against us.

Regrettably his vision is incomplete. You will help me prepare for his demise and deal with his [[Jambani|followers]] simultaneously. De tool you will use is called de [[Urn of Voices]].

Take it and venture into Tal'gurub. Slay his followers, destroy their golems and masks. Their [[ghost|spirits]], once released, will fill de urn.

Oh, and try not to die while holding it. De Urn of Voices is not discerning.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
Vol'jamba will pay for his transgressions.

==Completion==
All according to plan. Do not worry for them- this was always their fate.

==Notes==
Kill [[Jambani Spirit Twister]]s and [[Howling Voodoo Mask]]s.
