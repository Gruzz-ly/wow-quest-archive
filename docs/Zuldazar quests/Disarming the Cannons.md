==Objectives==
Disable the [[cannon]]s on the [[Horde]] [[ship]].
* [[Cannon (Zuldazar)|Cannons]] destroyed (3)

==Description==
With your arrival, our salvation may have arrived. Your [[rowboat]]s will serve as a way for us to evacuate the most critically injured.

Unfortunately, the Horde have brought in a ship, and there's no way we can get our boats past their blockade.

While the rest of us load our injured on the boats, we need you to infiltrate their ship and disable those cannons.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What's the status on those cannons?

==Completion==
Now we can get our wounded to safety.

==Notes==
To get on the ship, you can click on the [[Rappelling Rope]].

On complete of this and [[Granting a Reprieve]] & [[Disarming the Cannons]]:
