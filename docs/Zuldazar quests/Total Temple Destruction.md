==Objectives==
Command [[Grong]] to defeat the [[Horde]] at [[Temple of the Prophet]].
* [[Magister Umbric|Umbric]]'s [[Void Portal|portal]] used
*Temple forces destroyed

==Description==
Grong is our greatest achievement, and he's ready to be unleashed!

The Horde is staging its troops at a temple to the north.

Magister Umbric's portal will get you there fast. Then Grong can get to work!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (500x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Completion==
I'm not sure how I feel, <name>. 

The [[Embiggifier]] worked, but Grong won't ever be the same.

I suppose it's what he wanted, and what we need if we hope to win [[Fourth War|this war]].

==Notes==
*Kill [[Zandalari War Priest]]s, [[Skykiller Ballista]]e, [[Royal Guardian]]s, [[Horde Grunt (Zuldazar)|Horde Grunts]], and [[Horde Conspirator]]s.
