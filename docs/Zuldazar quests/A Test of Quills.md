==Objectives==
Speak with [[Miju]] to begin your final trial and collect the knowledge to craft your quill.

* Speak with Miju
* [[Avatar of the Bloodguard]] slain
* [[Avatar of Sacrifice]] slain
* [[Avatar of Bloodshed]] slain
* [[Avatar of Oblivion]] slain

==Description==
The recipe you're after, young one, is that of the [[:Sanguine Feather Quill of Lana'thel]]. I...

<Miju motions to a pile of stuff.>

Am the only other person I know of who has one... err... somewhere. But be warned, this trial may be your undoing!

I shall have to invoke all four contracts against you. You must defeat each of the creatures, and from each one learn the rune needed to carve into your quill.

Once you've learned all four runes, your trial shall be completed.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[:Design: Sanguine Feather Quill of Lana'thel]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I was but a young shell at the brisk age of 2372 when I took on this trial.

I hope the time you've lived has prepared you enough to defeat it as well.

==Completion==
Well done, young scribe. Well done, indeed!

You have the knowledge now. It's up in there.

<Miju tries to poke you in the head but you back away just in time.>

You're quick, probably how you succeeded in the trial. And now I present you with the final knowledge you need to craft your quill.

Ok, goodbye.

==Notes==

::{{Text|say|Miju|Alright, follow me.}}

::{{Text|say|Miju|As soon as all four runes have been activated, the trial will begin and you may choose the order in which to defeat each avatar. Good luck, young one.}}

:{{Text|say|Miju|Now that you have a means to invoke those contracts, there's one last thing to know.}}
:''Miju begins walking back to his hut.''
:{{Text|say|Miju|You can only have one of them active at any given time. Invoking more than that would probably kill you.}}
