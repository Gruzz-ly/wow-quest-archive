==Objectives==
Meet [[Halford Wyrmbane]] at [[Xibala]] in [[Zuldazar]].

==Description==
Our task is finished. You've planted the bombs on two of the [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari's]] major flagships, and [[John J. Keeshan|Keeshan]] has helped with the remainder.

Let's return to Halford, the sooner we're done here, the better. It's far too risky for us to be at the Zandalari's doorstep.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,790 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>, good timing. We have to move.

We've been discovered.
