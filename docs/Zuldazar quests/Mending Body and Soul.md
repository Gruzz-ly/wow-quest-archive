==Description==
Good. You have brought me the last ingredients I will need to concoct a solution to close the king's wounds.

You are not a moment too soon. He is fading.

I am not comfortable working at an elevated pace, but the situation requires it. You must be my hands, for I am very slow.

Bring me what I need, and let [[Jamil Abul'housin|Jamil]] and I worry about the rest.

Speak to me when you are ready to begin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
Stay on your toes. You have more of them than I do.

==Completion==
<Jol wheezes.>

That did not... work how I imagined it would.

==Notes==

;Speak to Jol the Ancient

These ingredients are tricky. They will require my full attention. 
You must be my hands to complete this concoction. Remember,
the king's life hangs in the balance.
Are you ready to begin?

{{Gossip|I am ready. Jol.}}

;At every step, Jol will remind you

Stay sharp.<name>，I shall give directions as I am ready for more ingredients.

Jol the Ancient says: Jamil will tend to his spirit while I close the wound. You must move quickly where I cannot.

Jamil Abul'housin says: An offering of blood is sure to rouse de king's temper. 

Jol the Ancient says: <name>，bring me my spices. I portioned them out earlier. 

Jamil Abul'housin says: Breathe deep, Highness... 

Jol the Ancient says: Now the brine. Check the pantry. 

Jamil Abul'housin says: Nothing? Jol, you better hurry with dat medicine... 

Jol the Ancient says: Thank you. I am mixing as fast as I can. Patience.

Jol the Ancient says: Was it one or two pinches? …<name>, bring me my scroll. 

Jamil Abul'housin says: You forgot de recipe?! 

Jol the Ancient says: It has been seven hundred years since I have made it. I should like to see you remember something older than your grandfather's grandfather.

:{{text|emote|Jamil Abul'housin starts to chant a prayer under his breath.}}

Jol the Ancient says: Right, THREE pinches. 

Jol the Ancient says: <name> give my stew a stir or it will burn.

Jol the Ancient says:Done! Now I will administer the potion.

:{{text|emote|Jamil Abul'housin's chanting grows louder,more desperate.}}

Jol the Ancient says: His bleeding will not stop. Quickly,<name>， bring me the clotting powder at once!

Jol the Ancient says: There...the king should wake, now.

Jol the Ancient says: Any second.

Jol the Ancient says:..Jamil?

:{{text|emote|Jamil Abul'housin cowers in terror!}}

Jol the Ancient says:Well.This is...a little outside my skill set,I'm afraid.

Jamil Abul'housin says:Dis is beyond all of us,my friend. De loa of death has him!
