==Objectives==
Collect the 3 [[Tortollan]] Scrolls.
* [[Waves of Power]]
* [[Scroll of Purify]]
* [[Edicts of Gral]]
*Speak with [[Scrollsage Goji]].

==Description==
These [[Gilgoblin|gilblins]] are ridiculous! They are like a swarm of angry bees, buzzing around.

Hmm, maybe not bees. [[Bee]]s are useful, and make honey, and don't steal things.

They ransacked our scrolls. Most were unusable, but there were three that are quite... potent. 

It would be most unfortunate if those made it back to their masters, the [[naga]]. Please clean up their mess and bring back our scrolls.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Ah, <race>. I was always fascinated by your native language.

==Completion==
These scrolls must be kept safe.

I dare not think how the naga could have used the secrets within, should they have deciphered them.

==Notes==
