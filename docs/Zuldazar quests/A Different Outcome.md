==Objectives==
Find [[Rokor]] near [[Atal'Gral]], to the north.
* Take Boat Service to Atal'gral (Horde-only)
*Speak to Rokor.

==Description==
There is no way to know when these orders were sent, or received. Rokor took some Seekers north some time ago. They must be in that region by now. If the temple still stands, warn [[Gral]] and his followers. If it is lost, we must do what we can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Completion==
I fear those orders were found too late to help those that served here... about five years too late.

==Progression==
{{Tortollan}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
