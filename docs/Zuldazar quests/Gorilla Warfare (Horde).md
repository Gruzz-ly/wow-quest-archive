==Objectives==
Rescue 6 Pacifist Gorillas.
*[[Peace-Loving Gorilla]]s released (6)

==Description==
Your timing is most fortuitous, stranger. I thank you for your assistance.

Things are not peaceful in [[Gorilla Gorge]]. The [[kaja'mite]] has given us great intelligence and wit. With intelligence has come war. 

My brethren are those who do not wish to fight. Neither the [[Zandalari troll]]s nor each other. But for our passivity we have been persecuted.

Please free my comrades. They will be in [[Cage (Zuldazar)|cage]]s all throughout the gorge and under guard. Make haste!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==

==Completion==
Thank you my friend! I saw the bravery with which you granted freedom to my comrades. We shall speak more anon.
