==Objectives==
Kill Advisor Ko'jan.
* [[Advisor Ko'jan]] slain

==Description==
The [[Gral's Call|ship's]] [[Captain Zalkran|captain]] is nowhere to be found. [[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris]] and [[Falstad Wildhammer|Falstad]] will handle locating him.

We must go after the ship's advisor. [[Kelsey Steelspark|Kelsey's]] logs indicate her name is Ko'jan. 

She may have methods to reach out to the mainland. We have to move before she tries to use any of them.

(Slay Ko'jan before she can send word of the Alliance's location!)

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,310 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Let's get moving.

==Completion==
It sounds like fighting up above has stopped. I trust Falstad and Shandris have the ship's captain.

Let's see if they managed to capture him alive.
