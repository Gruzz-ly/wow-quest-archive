==Objectives==
Take the key from [[Sli'thrus]].
* [[Nazeshi Cage Key]]
* [[Jailer Cage|Cage]] opened

==Description==
Oh, hello, friend. 

It seems there is more here than for what we prepared. 

We sought. We found. We studied... and then we were taken. There are [[naga]] here. We did not expect this.

There is a nasty fellow in this cave. If you could get the key from him, it would help us greatly.

No need to fret, we'll wait here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|46|80}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Were we asking too much?

==Completion==
We best get moving. I do not believe we can wait for the naga to move on, this time.

==Progression==
{{Tortollan}}
