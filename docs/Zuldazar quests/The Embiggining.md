==Objectives==
Test Grong's stats while embiggified.
* Speak to [[Megs]]
* Embiggify [[Grong]]
* Reach the marker
* Speak to Grong
* Embiggify Grong

==Description==
I'll give you the quick rundown before we get started.

The [[Embiggifier]] is remotely controlled.

See this big red button?

<Megs gestures to the device in her hand.>

This jolts the wearer with a surge of power, making them bigger.

For safety reasons, you should remain here at camp.

I think that's it! Are you ready to science?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (500x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Let's see what Grong can do once he's been embiggified!

==Completion==
Grong exceeded all our expectations. I'd say this is a resounding success.

==Notes==
;Speak to Megs
All our hard work is about to pay off, <name>.

Let me know when you're ready to make history!

{{gossip|I am ready.}}
:{{text|say|Megs|Let's see what an embiggified Grong can do!}}

;Embiggify Grong
: ''Grong get significantly bigger.''
:{{text|say|Morton Cogswald|Would you look at that! What a beast!}}
:{{text|say|Megs|Definitely bigger, yes. But we still need to monitor his other stats.}}

;Reach the marker
* (Using Speak) {{text|say|Grong|I am Grong. I am helping.}}
:{{text|say|Megs|Certainly faster than before. How's his intellect holding up?}}
Use Speak.
:{{text|say|Grong|Me want bigger! Me can handle it.}}
:{{text|say|Megs|We can't recommend that.}}
:{{text|say|Morton Cogswald|But we won't stop you either!}}

;Embiggify Grong
: ''Grong gets even bigger.''
:{{text|yell|Grong|Grong strong!}}
:{{text|yell|Grong|Moar big! Bigger! MOAR! GROOONG!}}
:{{text|say|Megs|Deteriorating mental state, noted.}}
:{{text|say|Morton Cogswald|Direct him back to camp, <name>. It's time to test his strength!}}
* (Using Speak) {{text|yell|Grong|Grong strong! STROOONG GRONG!}}

You can try Grong's gossip once again.

: Me Grong!

* {{gossip|Are you sure you want to do this?}}
:: Grong strong! STROOONG GRONG!

* {{gossip|What is [[kaja'mite]]?}}
:: Moar big! Bigger! MOAR! GROOONG!
