==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Tidemistress Nazesh.png|Tidemistress Nazesh|Desperate, but powerful.}}
Defeat [[Tidemistress Nazesh]] and discover why the [[naga]] were sent here.
* [[Orders from Nazjatar]]
* [[Stone Fragment]]
* [[Scroll of Storm Control]] (provided)

==Description==
Tidemistress Nazesh is right up this hill, <name>.

There is something there. Something [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] wants very badly.

The naga must not succeed. If you can get a little piece of [[Azerite|that stone]], though, bring it back for us.

Take this scroll with you, it will help you in your fight.

It is time we push her forces, back into the waves for good.

==Progress==
What have you found?

==Completion==
Well fought, adventurer. Well fought, indeed! 

Whatever this stone is those naga were after, they did not get it this day!

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|Say|Deyon|Nazesh has been quite rude. Your lesson in manners will have to be rather firm... and permanent, I'm afraid. Use the scroll now, it will help!}}

The quest item provides the Stormstruck extra button.

;On completion
:{{Text|Say|Deyon|Impressive work, to be sure! The specularity on this rock is stunning. I feel like it has an energy...}}
:{{Text|Say|Deyon|And this scroll... this is the seal for the [[Zanchuli Council]]... and Queen Azshara? I am unable to read the text, but if anyone can decipher it, it will be [[Akru]].}}
