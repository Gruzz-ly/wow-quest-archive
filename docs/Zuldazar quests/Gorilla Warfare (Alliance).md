==Objectives==
Rescue 6 Pacifist Gorillas.
* [[Peace-Loving Gorilla]]s released (6)

==Description==
Your timing is most fortuitous, stranger. I thank you for your assistance.

Things are not peaceful in [[Gorilla Gorge]]. The [[kaja'mite]] has given us great intelligence and wit. With intelligence has come war.

My brethren are those who do not wish to fight. But for our passivity we have been persecuted.

Please free my comrades. They will be in cages all throughout the gorge and under guard. Make haste!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Have you freed my peaceful brethren?

==Completion==
Thank you my friend! I saw the bravery with which you granted freedom to my comrades. We shall speak more anon.
