==Objectives==
Warn [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]] of the betrayal.

==Description==
This was all perpetrated by someone on the [[Zanchuli Council]]. 

They sacrificed their own people, [[Gral]]'s followers, for [[Azshara]]. That is unconscionable!

They weaken the foundation, so the [[Zandalari Empire|kingdom]] will fall.

One of [[Horde|your people]] must have direct access to the [[Rastakhan|king]]. Anyone else could be the traitor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|1|94}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It was wise of you to bring this to me, <name>.

==Notes==
;On completion

:{{Text|Say|Baine Bloodhoof|If we are to have any hope of bringing the Zandalari into the Horde, we must keep each other strong.}}
