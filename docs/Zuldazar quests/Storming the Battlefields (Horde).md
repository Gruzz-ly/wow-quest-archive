<nowiki>*</nowiki>Only classes with a [[Healer (role)|healer]] and a [[tank]] specialization will have all three item choices. Classes with one but not the other will have two choices, while [[Damage (role)|DPS]]-only classes will simply receive the appropriate item. Items not chosen when completing this quest can be purchased for 5 [[Mark of Honor]] from [[Xander Silberman]] instead.

==Progress==

==Completion==
If we keep up the pressure there is no way the [[Alliance]] will succeed.
