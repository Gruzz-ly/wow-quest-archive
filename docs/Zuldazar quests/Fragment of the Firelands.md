==Objectives==
Stabilize the [[Unstable Magma (Zuldazar)|Unstable Magma]] then use the [[Magma giant|Magma Elemental]] to defeat 200 Bilgewater Goblins.
* [[Bilgewater Goblin]] slain (200)
* [[Stabilize Magma Elemental]] (provided)

==Description==
The rumors o' yer capabilities seemed overblown, but it appears yer indeed a competent one, aren't ye?

I underestimated ye, <name>. For that, I apologize. Don't tell [[Thaelin Darkanvil|Thaelin]].

The components for the ritual are now prepared. All ye need to do is add the [[:Firelands Slag]] to the Unstable Magma an' a great bein' from the [[Firelands]] will heed our call.

You'll gain control o' it and can eliminate the nearby goblin threat with nigh invincibility.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Me [[shaman]] are gettin' better at this, aye? First couple o' summons and we had a hot fight on our hands.

==Completion==
Ah haha haaaaaaaaaaaa! Wow! I gotta admit, I'm a bit jealous I let ye take 'er out for a spin before I could. Those goblins never saw ye comin'!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Anvil-Thane Thurgaden|<class>, place some o' that slag on the unstable magma there. And prepare yerself.}}

Hop in:
:{{text|say|Anvil-Thane Thurgaden|A mighty fine summon, lads. You have control o' it, <name>. Show that batch o' [[Horde]] what happens when they meddle with the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron]]!}}

While controlling the elemental, players have access to two abilities:
#{{abilities|Raise Hell|cd=2 sec|Calls forth flames from the Firelands.|notes=Instant|id=264275}}
#{{abilities|Wave of Fire|cd=7 sec|Cast forth a wave of fire.|notes=Instant|id=264282}}

In mechanics that seem oddly reminiscent of [[Gnomebliteration]] back in Uldum, head to the beach, then further west along the beach. Use the #6 ability to return to camp instantly after killing 200.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Thaelin Darkanvil|That was right terrifyin'!}}
:{{text|say|Anvil-Thane Thurgaden|All in a day's work!}}
:''Thurgaden leaves for a male machine.''

==Progression==
{{Zuldazar Foothold}}

==Bugs==
The elemental seems to have a large delay on both its abilities and drawing aggro, making completion of this quest difficult. However, going to the far left side of the beach (in and around the Azerite deposit) makes it work properly again.
