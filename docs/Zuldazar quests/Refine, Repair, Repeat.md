==Objectives==
Repair 6 broken Kaja'mite Refiners on the [[Kaja'Coast|Kaja Coast]].
* [[Kaja'mite Refiner]]s repaired (6)

==Description==
<[[Jazz Mokkitz|Jazz]] holds up a well-polished crystal of [[kaja'mit]]e.>

Most materials aren't ready to use straight outta the ground--kaja'mite included. I've got a few refined crystals to tinker with, but I'll need more.

I rigged up some refiners on the slope, but halfway through the cycle elementals started beatin' on 'em pretty hard. 

Could you see if you could get 'em goin' again? You look like you could handle those angry rocks, and my wife likes it when I come home without injuries.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Valorstones]]

==Progress==
Were they salvageable? I had to make those custom for this job.

==Completion==
I wasn't sure how those refiners would hold up under stress. I'm glad you fixed 'em!

<Jazz casually flips a small kaja'mite crystal between his fingers.>

Do you think I could patent and license the schematics? The royalties could keep me outta the field if I charge enough.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Thanks for saving me the bruises, <name>. My wife doesn't like me takin' risks like that.}}
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|I've got somethin' special for us to work on when you're done. I'll get our parts and meet you by the mines!}}
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|I just gotta let the world stop spinning first.}}

Interact with [[Kaja'mite Refiner]]s to repair them.

On return:
:{{text|say|Jazz Mokkitz|Hey! Over here!}}

==Progression==
