==Objectives==
Slay 8 Horde forces on the eastern shores of [[Xibala]].
* [[Horde]] forces slain  (8)

==Description==
Ye know, <name>, these [[Nightborne|elves]] might be purple, but they're no' with the [[Alliance]].

Leastwise, they're a lot more aggressive than this ol' Dark Iron is comfortable with.

On the off chance it'll piss off the Horde, ye mind killin' a few of them?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
All elves look alike t'me. I'll let ye make the call.

==Completion==
I'm guessin' they weren't friendly. Well, that's a weight off me mind.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Nightborne Envoy]]s and [[Zandalari Drudge]]s.

==Progression==
{{Xibala Alliance}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
