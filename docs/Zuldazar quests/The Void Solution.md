==Objectives==
Use [[Magister Umbric|Magister Umbric's]] Void Shard to destroy 4 Bilgewater Frackers.
* [[Bilgewater Fracker]] destroyed (4)
*[[Magister Umbric's Void Shard]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Bilgewater Cartel]] are serious about protecting their investment at the mining site. My trackers have reported a heavy presence of large mech suits used for breaking rocks and suppressing attackers.

I am certain that you could deal with the mechs yourself, but you need not waste your time doing so.

Take this void shard and use it to cast the large mechs into the [[Void]], where they won't be able to bother anyone again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Every second saved puts us one step closer to Gallywix.

==Completion==
The power of the Void is endless, <name>, if you can control it.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Dark Iron Grenadier|Ye wee elves be needin' some help with yer mission? Dark Irons can take care of it!}}
:{{text|say|Void Assassin|Thank you, my dirt-stained friend, but we move more quickly on our own.}}
:{{text|say|Void Assassin|We have everything under control. Relax and enjoy your ale.}}
:{{text|say|Dark Iron Grenadier|Don't mind if I do.}}

The quest item has a 100-yard range, so go nuts.

==Progression==
{{A Golden Opportunity}}
