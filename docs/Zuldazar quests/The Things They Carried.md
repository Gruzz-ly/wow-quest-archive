==Objectives==
Acquire intelligence from the [[Alliance]].
* [[Unsent Letter]]
* [[Scouting Map (item)]]
* [[Ship's Manifest]]

==Description==
We need to know more about these [[sailor]]s before we report back.

Ideally, we would invade their [[camp]] but there are too many for our small group to take on. Lucky for us, they are focused on their salvage operation over safety. See if you can find any intelligence on their leaders who are scavenging the derelicts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
What have you found?

==Completion==
Intelligence isn't always gathered from the most obvious things.

==Progression==
{{Talanji's Rebuke}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
