Retrieve the Direhorn Saddle in [[Warbeast Kraal]].

==Description==
I believe [[Torcali|my loa]] will agree with me when I say that you have proven yourself worthy of this one's companionship.

She is large enough now that she can bear you wherever it is that you wish to go.

I had de [[Beastlord L'kala|Beastlord]] craft a saddle for you. Go and get it and I will help you put it on your new steed's back.

Congratulations, <name>.

You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Li'zal rubs her head and groans.>

==Completion==
I could not stop her. She rammed de gate...

Like a thing possessed...
