==Objectives==
Use the Elemental Summoning Stone to expose Xibalan fossils. Bring 50 Xibalan Fossil Fragments to [[Acadia Chistlestone]].
* [[Xibalan Fossil Fragment]] (50)
* [[Elemental Summoning Stone]] (provided)

==Description==
Suppose I owe the lass her bones if I'm tae be monopolizin' yer time. And I will be.

Go on out into the ruins an' use this here stone to call one of my rumbly [[elemental]] friends. They'll blast away any dirt 'tween you an' the fossils.

We could go about this the ol' fashion way, but do you really want to spend all day digging? Course ye don't.

Acadia will see that a little efficiency gets everyone what they want.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
<Acadia eyes [[Excavator Morgrum Emberflint|Morgrum]] sourly.>

I don't think he cares one lick about our expedition, <name>.

==Completion==
<Acadia stares at the fragments, dismayed.>

I'll just... clean these up... See what we can salvage.

Thanks?
