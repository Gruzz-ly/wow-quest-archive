==Objectives==
Use the [[Magister Umbric|Magister Umbric's]] Void Portal to join him in [[Atal'Dazar]].
* Use Void Portal in [[Xibala]] (Optional) {{co|40.5|70.6|Zuldazar}}
* Meet Umbric in Atal'Dazar

==Description==
The [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] have many powerful and ancient artifacts tucked away on [[Zandalar|this island]], hidden from view.

But some of their treasures are more... conspicuous.

It is no surprise that [[Jastor Gallywix|Trade Prince Gallywix]] was unable to resist the allure of Atal'Dazar, a massive city made entirely of gold.

Come with me and we will hunt him down together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,930 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Gallywix has no respect for culture or history. Only money.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Magister Umbric|Gallywix is slippery. He won't stay out in the open for long.}}
:{{text|say|Magister Umbric|We can travel through the [[Void]] to save time. Follow me.}}

Take the [[Void Portal]]. On the other side, Umbric and the player arrive near the center of Atal'Dazar, where a few [[Bilgewater Treasure Thief|Bilgewater Treasure Thieves]] are startled by the arrival:
:{{text|say|Bilgewater Treasure Thief|Holy gold! Where'd the elf come from?!}}
:{{text|say|Bilgewater Treasure Thief|Scram! It's the Alliance!}}
:{{text|yell|Bilgewater Treasure Thief|Gallywiiiiix!}}

==Progression==
{{A Golden Opportunity}}
