==Objectives==
Administer the Aggression Formula to [[Gentle Ben'jin]].
* Aggression Formula administered
* [[Aggression Formula]] (provided)

==Description==
The Aggression Formula is ready and I need you to inject Ben'jin with it.

Let's show the [[Azeroth|world]], and the [[Witch Doctor Jangalar|witch doctor]], that well researched, dramatically overpowered, double-blind, peer-reviewed, super [[goblin]] science is the right way to do, uh, pretty much anything!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
This is exciting, isn't it?

==Completion==
I spent several moments working out that formula! It should have worked! The reason these [[brutosaur]]s are endangered is clearly their unreasonable resistance to science!

==Notes==
