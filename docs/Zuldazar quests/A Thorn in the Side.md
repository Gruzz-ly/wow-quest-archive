==Objectives==
Slay 12 Ankylodons in the [[Preserve]].
* [[Ankylodon]]s slain (12)
*Find [[Erak the Aloof]].

==Description==
You fools speak of "big game" hunting like it is a thing of wonder. Bah!

None know big game hunting like my kin. Mastery of the hunt, passed down from parent to child, for generations.

I am here to prove it.

I wager that you could not slay more than eleven of the ankylodon beasts that wander this region.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you done what I've asked or have you returned in failure and shame?

==Completion==
<The fresh corpse of Erak appears to have been slain from behind by darts and is disturbingly missing some pieces. Conveniently, the prize money of his wager still adorns the body.>

==Notes==
*Kill [[Ankylodon Bull]]s and [[Ankylodon (Zuldazar)|Ankylodons]].

==Progression==
{{Nesingwary's Trek}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
