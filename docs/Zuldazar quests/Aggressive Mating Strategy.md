==Objectives==
Harvest 8 Bile Sacs from [[Invasive Razorwing]]s.
* [[Razorwing Bile Sac]] (8)

==Description==
Aggression is good. I agree with [[Witch Doctor Jangalar|Jangalar]] that [[Gentle Ben'jin|Ben'jin]] needs to be a lot less passive to succeed and I can prove science is the way to do it by making an injection for him.

Alchemy tells us that, for this type of beast, aggression comes from a substance in their bile sacs. The local razorwings are invasive and, as such, have more than enough aggression for our purposes.

Harvest some of their bile sacs and I'll make a treatment that will have our big boy ready to go again in no time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
Did you get all of the bile sacs I need yet? Science is not supposed to be safe...

==Completion==
Just what I needed! Boy do they smell! 

With these bile sacs, I can make enough [[Aggression Formula]] for a creature as big as a [[brutosaur]].
