==Objectives==
Collect 5 Seeker scrolls.
* [[Tortollan Scroll]] (5)
*Meet [[Deyon]] on the northeastern side of [[Covescale Rise]].

==Description==
When they captured us, they took everything we had - including our wonderful scrolls!

Those [[naga]] witches are building storms. They try to hide what they do here, and seek power for their [[Queen Azshara|queen]]. 

We see past their madness, they are driven for a purpose.

Retrieve our work from the [[Nazeshi Tempest-Wielder]]s, else they may use them for nefarious gains.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
I really need to invest in some more scroll cases...

==Completion==
Looks like everything is here, and with little damage done! Very impressive!

What do we have in here? Let's see...
