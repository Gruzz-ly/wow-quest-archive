==Objectives==
Collect 12 Azerite Infused Ore.
* [[Azerite Infused Ore]] (12)

==Description==
[[Grong]] is already impressively large. In fact, I don't think our [[Embiggifier]] is going to fit around his noggin without some modification. 

I'll require an ample supply of ore to make the necessary adjustments, but we're in luck. The [[goblin]]s nearby have already done the work of mining it; we just need to take it off their hands!

Secure an ample amount of [[:Azerite]]-infused [[ore]], and we'll be back in business!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you acquired the ore?

==Completion==
This should help ensure the Embiggifier is a perfect fit!

== Notes ==
Single pieces liter the sand, but you can go for Crate of Ore that are sitting around which are worth around five pieces.

==Progression==
{{The Sleeper Agent}}
