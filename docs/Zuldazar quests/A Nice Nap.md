==Objectives==
Use the Tranquilizer Dart on Grong.
* [[Grong]] tranquilized
* [[Tranquilizer Dart (BfA)]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm not sure how much longer those chains will hold.

Grong's going to have to take a little nap until he's ready to be deployed.

Use this dart. It's been double-dipped in something potent enough to take down a [[direhorn]], so it should do the trick.

Grong would want you to be the one to do it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Go ahead, use the dart on Grong. He won't feel a thing. I promise.

==Completion==
Grong will go down in history as a true hero of the [[Alliance]].
