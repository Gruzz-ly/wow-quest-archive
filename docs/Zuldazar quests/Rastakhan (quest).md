==Description==
You stand before [[General Jakra'zet]], lord of de armies of [[Zandalar]], enforcer of her seas and bringer of war.

And I do not like you.

It took years to earn my place here after your Horde laid waste to my people. You will not undo what I have built.

I will see you kneel before King [[Rastakhan]]. I will watch you beg as he lets me take your head for a trophy. I will fling your corpse into de wastes of [[Vol'dun]].

Her "Highness" may object... but she is not queen yet.

Come. Let us fly to your fate.

==Progress==
Welcome, Champion of de Horde. I am King Rastakhan, lord of Zandalar and her peoples.

==Completion==
Your deeds have reached my ears before your feet ever set foot in my land. It is time we spoke.

==Notes==
Hop on the pterrordax, and Talanji will hop on as well:
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|Know dis... Father is set in his ways, but he is most observant. I would wager he already knows of your role in freeing me from Stormwind.}}
:{{Text|say|Princess Talanji|Just show respect and let him do de talking... and hopefully he will not throw you off de pyramid.}}

Speak with Talanji:
