==Objectives==
Rescue 6 Uninsured [[Goblin]] Workers.
* [[Uninsured Goblin Worker]] healed (6)

==Description==
Yo, <name>! I leave the [[A.M.O.D]] for two seconds to deal with old [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] and now I'm knee-deep in [[:Azerite]] goo!

Listen, here's the deal. I need ya to rescue some of these goblins from these monsters.

I'll be honest, I skimped on the money that covers their insurance in the event of Azerite-monster-related injuries.

What? Who knew that these [[Ooze|slimes]] would appear and attack these guys!

Do me a solid and get these goblins outta there!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*17,850 [[XP]]
*[[Comprehensive Goblin Insurance Package]]

==Progress==
Ya help those guys?

==Completion==
You're a real life saver! Well, life for them, gold for me.

If anyone asks, we never talked about this. Ya catching my drift?

==Notes==
After interacting with Uninsured Goblin Workers, they turn into [[Placated Goblin Worker]]s.
