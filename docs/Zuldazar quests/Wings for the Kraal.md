==Objectives==
Collect 8 Nearly-hatchling Pterrordax Eggs.
*[[Nearly-hatching Pterrordax Egg]] (8)

==Description==
It seems your [[Direhorn Hatchling|little one]] needs a moment to rest after dat adventure. I will look after it.

If you want to make yourself useful while you wait, I heard de [[pterrordax]]es to de north have been laying lots of eggs recently. Go collect de ones dat are wiggling and making noises. Dey are about to hatch.

Our beasts breed well, but we always need more wings for de [[Warbeast Kraal|kraal]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
Do you have de eggs I asked for?

==Completion==
I will get dese to a handler. We should be de first thing dey see if we want to keep dem.
