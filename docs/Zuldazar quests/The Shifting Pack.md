==Objectives==
Take [[Azala]] to the Lair of Gonk at the [[Garden of the Loa]] in [[Zuldazar]]. Make sure to call for her if she is not present when you get there.
* Visit [[Lair of Gonk]]
* [[Casteless Zandalari Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
Dere's one [[loa]] I'm extra interested in seeing: [[Gonk]]! I've heard de [[priest]]s say dat he's de most welcoming of de loa. He even lets his followers worship other loa as well!

But de best thing about him is dat he and his followers can change into many forms. I want to do dat!

Will you take me to meet him?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
Gonk's followers can turn into lots of different things. I think dey're pretty great.

==Completion==
Did you see how Gonk changed me into all dose shapes?

Maybe one day I can do dat by myself!

==Notes==
Arriving at the Lair of Gonk:
:{{text|say|Azala|Gonk really shows de bad guys who's boss, doesn't he?}}
:{{text|say|Azala|I've heard Gonk is pretty nice. Let's go see if he's home.}}
:''Azala walks into Gonk's lair.''
:{{text|say|Gonk|Ah, a little one. Tell me, what brings you to my den?}}
:{{text|say|Azala|I heard you are de most generous loa, dat you allow your followers to follow other loa as well.}}
:{{text|say|Azala|You are de loa of de pack, but what I wanna know about most is your mastery of shapes!}}
:{{text|say|Azala|I've seen your worshippers in Zuldazar change into many things. If I follow you, can I do dat too?}}
:{{text|say|Gonk|I am the master of shapes, little one. If you choose to honor me, I will grant you this power as well.}}
:''Azala is transformed to baby dinosaurs as Gonk speaks: a [[raptor]], a [[brutosaur]], a [[platysaur]], and then a [[direhorn]].''
:{{text|say|Gonk|My followers come from all walks of life. They may also follow other loa, but all are part of my pack.}}
:{{text|say|Gonk|Though if you wish to change shapes, you must be loyal to me. Will that be a problem for you, child?}}
:{{text|say|Azala|Me? Of course not, I don't have a loa! Maybe I'll pick you!}}
:''Gonk roars.''
:{{text|say|Gonk|Perhaps you will.}}
