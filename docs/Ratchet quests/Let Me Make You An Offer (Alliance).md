==Objectives==
Take the Arms Shipment to [[Master Wood]] in [[Stormwind City]].
*[[Arms Shipment]] (provided)

==Description==
The first run's all packed up, <name>. Take this to Stormwind and get it in front of the higher-ups. Someone who can sign today!

==Progress==
A delivery from [[Ratchet]]? I didn't order anything from Ratchet.

==Completion==
An arms supplier in Ratchet? Well... the [[Alliance]] does need all the supplies we can get. And we don't want the [[Horde]] signing a deal. We should act fast.
