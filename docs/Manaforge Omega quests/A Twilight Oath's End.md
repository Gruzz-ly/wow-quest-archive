'''A Twilight Oath's End''' starts from the [[Mark of the Twilight Oath]], a guaranteed drop from [[Dimensius (tactics)|Dimensius]] in Heroic [[Manaforge Omega]] until the release of {{g|mid}}.

==Objectives==
Bring the Mark of the Twilight Oath to [[Ve'nari]] in the [[Oasis]] on [[K'aresh]].
*[[Mark of the Twilight Oath]] (provided)

==Description==
<The ancient runes on the page seem to twist under your gaze. Their power seems to be rapidly fading.>

<Ve'nari would be interested in this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|280|80}}
*[[Reins of the Royal Voidwing]]

==Completion==
[[Salhadaar]] cheated death to revive [[Dimensius]], and cheated death again by escaping your wrath.

<Ve'nari pauses for a moment.>

A pity he escaped, but the All-Devouring has perished. Thank you.
