==Objectives==
Report to [[Zo'turu]] at [[Shadow Point]].

==Description==
My friend, we've finished working on some new tools to ensure you'll do some real damage to the [[Shadowguard]]. Come by and let's sort it out together.

==Rewards==
You will learn:
*{{Abilities|Behind Enemy Lines|id=1237915|The Vandals infuse your weapons with arcane energy, increasing your damage dealt and healing done while inside Manaforge Omega.|icon=inv_-firearm_2h_outdoorethereal_c_01}}

ou will also receive:
*[[Shadowguard Translocator]]

==Completion==
My friend! Thanks to our informants inside the [[Manaforge Omega|Manaforge]], we've uncovered some [[technology]] that can help you bring it down. This translocator has been calibrated to project your soul back here for a few moments, allowing you to access whatever you may need--but be warned. The pull of Omega's energy fields are strong, and will rip your essence back to your body's position in short order. I'm told it's... quite painful. Still, any advantage is a good advantage. Make haste!
