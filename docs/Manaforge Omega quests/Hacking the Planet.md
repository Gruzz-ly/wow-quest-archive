'''Hacking the Planet''' becomes available after reaching Renown 11 with [[Manaforge Vandals]].

==Objectives==
Report to [[Zo'ropo]] at [[Shadow Point]].

==Description==
Hero... we're in. We have full control of [[Manaforge Omega]]'s security. I'll brief you on your next trip back.

==Rewards==
You will learn: {{Abilities|Trash Hacking III|id=1243367|Assume direct control of all Manaforge consoles, allowing you unlimited weekly access and extending their reach further to enemies nearby Nexus-King Salhadaar and Dimensius.|icon=ability_racial_etherealconnection}}

==Completion==
Manaforge Omega's security systems are under our direct control. Thanks to the damage you've done in there, we can get you access to consoles extending all the way to [[Salhadaar]], and whatever lies beyond. We've also ensured you can use every console you come across. That's all I can do for you. Get in there and finish the fight.
