'''Manaforge Omega: A Walking Shadow''' is the [[raid skip]] quest for [[Manaforge Omega]], made available after reaching Renown 5 with the [[Manaforge Vandals]]. After completing this quest, either the teleporter inside the raid before [[Plexus Sentinel]], or the flight master [[Lossain]] at [[Shadow Point]] outside the raid will allow players to skip directly to Salhadaar.

While in the raid, players will automatically be offered the quest in the vicinity of [[Fractillus]]. [[Zo'turu]] offers it outside the raid as a backup.

==Objectives==
Defeat Nexus-King Salhadaar within Manaforge Omega on <Normal/Heroic/Mythic> difficulty.
*[[Nexus-King Salhadaar (tactics)|Nexus-King Salhadaar]] slain

==Description==
Hero, can you hear me? There's a translocator the Shadowguard uses to send cargo to their reserves that can carry you directly to their post beneath the Manaforge. An ambush they'll never see coming!

There is of course, a catch. We do not have clearance to use their supply lines... so we need you to procure some for us. Take down the highest-ranking member of the Shadowguard you can find, return with identification, and we'll forge you a one-way ticket to the front lines.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 15,250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found credentials we can use to enter the translocator?

==Completion==
That certainly qualifies as high-ranking, <name>! After I work my magic, that translocator is as good as ours. Next stop, enemy territory!

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 11.2.0|added=}}
