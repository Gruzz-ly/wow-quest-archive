'''Head Hunting: The Soul Hunters''' becomes available after reaching Renown 9 with the [[Manaforge Vandals]].

==Objectives==
Defeat [[The Soul Hunters]] within [[Manaforge Omega]] on any [[Instance difficulty|difficulty]].

==Description==
Careful in the wastes, my friend. [[Scout]]s report that a trio of [[Demon hunter|Demon Hunters]] are training south of the Manaforge - with [[Adarus Duskblaze|one]] of them exhibiting power like we've never seen. You can avoid their path if you wish, but ignoring them could open you up to being flanked should they decide to engage. I recommend taking them out if you can, as well as providing us some samples of their newfound strength.

==Rewards==
You will also learn: {{Abilities|Head Hunting: The Soul Hunters|id=1243675|The Soul Hunters have a chance to drop three additional Soulgorged Augment Runes when defeated.|icon=inv_112_achievement_raid_dhcouncil}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 15,250 [[XP]]
*3x [[Soulgorged Augment Rune]]

==Progress==
How fares your battle with the interlopers?

==Completion==
[[Soul]] energy like I've never seen it. While we cannot return them to the way they were, I believe you can use these runes to empower yourself even *through* death. Take them with you, and use them wisely.
