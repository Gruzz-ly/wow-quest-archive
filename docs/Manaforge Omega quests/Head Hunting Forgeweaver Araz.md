'''Head Hunting: Forgeweaver Araz''' becomes available after reaching Renown 8 with [[Manaforge Vandals]].

==Objectives==
Defeat [[Forgeweaver Araz]] inside [[Manaforge Omega]] on any [[Instance difficulty|difficulty]].

==Description==
My friend, I hope your assault is going well. It's time for you to dispatch the Forgeweaver; using his mastery of [[technomancy]] he oversees both the Manaforge's production pipelines... as well as the ritual to return [[Dimensius]] to this plane. His workshop will be further in and heavily guarded, but cutting him down should stop their plans of resurrection for good.

==Rewards==
You will also learn: {{Abilities|Head Hunting: Forgeweaver Araz|id=1243677|Forgeweaver Araz has a chance to drop additional Manaforged Instruments when defeated.|icon=inv_112_achievement_raid_engineer}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|46|80}}
*15,250 [[XP]]
*[[Manaforged Instrument]]

==Progress==
Does the Forgeweaver yet live?

==Completion==
<Name>... I should have seen that coming. His devotion to Dimensius knew no bounds, and he certainly had contingencies in place to make sure the ritual would be completed. We'll have to attack from another angle. We found some debris from his inner sanctum that made its way here - if you have the skill, we can teach you how to use it for your own ends.
