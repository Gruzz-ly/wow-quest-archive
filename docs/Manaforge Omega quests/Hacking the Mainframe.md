'''Hacking the Mainframe''' becomes available after reaching Renown 3 with [[Manaforge Vandals]].

==Objectives==
Report to [[Zo'ropo]] at [[Shadow Point]].

==Description==
Our saboteurs have made great progress on hacking [[Manaforge Omega|Omega]]'s security systems; swing by and let me tell you about what we've learned.

==Rewards==
You will learn: {{Abilities|Trash Hacking I|id=1243365|Gain access to consoles near Loom'ithar and Soulbinder Naazindrhi{{sic}}, allowing you to significantly weaken non-boss enemies nearby.|icon=ability_racial_etherealconnection}}

==Completion==
There are consoles inside the Manaforge that keep the flow of energy running smoothly within the facility. We've cracked security on the first set of them, allowing you to turn the tables on enemies near [[Loom'ithar]] and [[Soulbinder Naazindhri|Soulbinder Naazindrhi]]{{sic}}. You'll only be able to use one, but sabotaging them should allow you an edge in battle. Good luck in there.
