'''The Deadliest Trap Ever Laid''' pits a suggested group of three [[Aldor]]-affiliated players against waves of [[Dragonmaw Clan|Dragonmaw]] Skybreakers at the [[Altar of Sha'tar]] once a day, then tricking the Dragonmaw commander with a false report. This quest is available at {{reputation|revered}} reputation with [[Netherwing]] after completing [[Commander Arcus (quest)]]. The [[Scryers]] version of this quest is [[The Deadliest Trap Ever Laid (Scryers)]].

==Objectives==
Assist [[Commander Arcus]] and the [[Aldor]] in defending the [[Altar of Sha'tar]]. Once all of the [[Dragonmaw Clan|Dragonmaw]] forces have been defeated, return to [[Overlord Mor'ghor]] at [[Dragonmaw Base Camp]] with the Aldor Medals.
* Dragonmaw Forces Defeated
* [[Aldor Medals]] (provided)
* Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
Take these Aldor medals. Mor'ghor will need proof of "victory" once this is over. He will recognize them as coming from the corpses of fallen Aldor soldiers.

Now all that remains is to use the signal flare to alert the Dragonmaw raiders. We will crush them when you are ready. Just give me the word.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28}}
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Netherwing]]

==Progress==
Did you crush them under your boot, commander?

==Completion==
<Mor'ghor laughs.>

HAH! I knew you wouldn't let me down, commander! I want you to lead a raid on the Altar of Sha'tar at least once per day. They will have no choice but to leave Shadowmoon!

==Notes==
This is an endurance quest, but can be soloed relatively easily (depending on class, spec, and gear) as the graveyard is seconds away from the fight and the Commander has a large amount of health.
