Part of a quest line that ends with [[Quenching the Blade]].  This quest must be done after [[Additional Materials]].  It opens along with [[The Lexicon Demonica]].  Once both are done, [[Tear of the Earthmother (quest)]] and [[Underworld Loam]] open up.

==Objectives==
[[David Wayne]] at Wayne's Retreat wants you to bring him an Overcharged Manacell.
*[[Overcharged Manacell]]

==Description==
Working with the ingots you brought is going to require a lot of heat—rather more than a conventional forge can supply.

I'm going to need a supplemental heat source for the forge and there are very few things in Outland that can supply that kind of power.

The [[Mechanar]] area of [[Tempest Keep]] turns out manacells containing an incredible amount of power. Find one of the overcharged manacells from the stacks around [[Mechano-Lord Capacitus]] and bring it back here.

==Progress==
Were you able to smuggle a manacell out of the Mechanar.

==Completion==
This is even more potent than I expected! With this much power, I could forge a dozen blades!

==Progression==
{{Illidari-Bane Shard}}

==Patch changes==
