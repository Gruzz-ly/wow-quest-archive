==Objectives==
Speak with Overlord Mor'ghor at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.

The Overlord has called for you, grunt. A new rank awaits, no doubt.

I have been following your activities closely, <name>. You have proven to be an invaluable asset to Dragonmaw. With that said, I am going to promote you to Overseer. With that rank comes new responsibilities that you must fulfill.

Rise, Overseer <name>! Rise and seek out those that need your assistance at the base camp.

*{{Cost|4|40}}
