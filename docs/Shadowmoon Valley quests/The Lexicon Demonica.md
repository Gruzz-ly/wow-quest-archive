'''The Lexicon Demonica''' is part of a quest line to obtain some anti-Demon weapons.

==Objectives==
Obtain the Lexicon Demonica from [[Grandmaster Vorpil]] and bring it to [[David Wayne]] at [[Wayne's Refuge]].
* [[Lexicon Demonica]]

==Description==
Recreating the enchantments on the blade requires several spells to be spoken in demonic.

It's not something I was taught during my training as an apprentice, but there's no way around it. There's a book, called the Lexicon Demonica, that will provide most of the words I need, but it's in the hands of a powerful [[Shadow Council]] [[warlock]].

Deep in the halls of [[Auchindoun]]'s [[Shadow Labyrinth]], it is held by Grandmaster Vorpil. Do whatever you must to secure the book and bring it to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10}}
*24600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you retrieved the book?

==Completion==
<David leafs through the book's pages, shuddering.>

This is not something to be trifled with, <name>. After the weapon is created, I will destroy it. There is enough demonic power about in the world without this text out in the open.

==Trivia==
