==Objectives==
[[Smith Hauthaa]] needs you to produce 5 Cleansed Ata'mal Metal. Do so by breaking down {{item|Ata'mal Armament|Ata'mal Armaments}} on her anvil at the [[Sun's Reach Armory]] on the [[Isle of Quel'Danas]].
*[[Cleansed Ata'mal Metal]] (5)

==Description==
The [[Ata'mal Terrace]] in eastern [[Shadowmoon Valley]] is holy to the [[draenei]], but is now overrun by [[fel orc]]s. They have dug up the special ore from that place and created corrupted weapons and armor.

I need the armaments to form an alloy with the [[naga]] ore. Our anchorites have blessed my anvil with the ability to cleanse them.

Retrieve the armaments from the Shadowmoon chosen, slayers and darkweavers. Return them here, breaking down and purifying them upon my anvil, and then hand me the cleansed results.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Blessed Weapon Coating|Righteous Weapon Coating}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|80}}

==Progress==
I need all of the cleansed Ata'mal metal that I can get my hands on, <class>.

==Completion==
Thank you, my friend. Now I will be able to fashion more of the special alloy that is going into the creation of some of our forces' weapons and armor.

And, I have some leftover extract from the process, which you'll likely find handy for use on your weapons. Please, take your pick of whichever will serve your purposes.

Return to me again on the morrow. No doubt I will need more armaments.

==Notes==
[[Shadowmoon Chosen]], [[Shadowmoon Darkweaver]]s, [[Shadowmoon Slayer]]s all drop {{item|Ata'mal Armament|Ata'mal Armaments}}. Kill enough until you get 5, then head back to the [[Sun's Reach Armory]] and use them on the Anvil to create [[Cleansed Ata'mal Metal]].

[[Smith Gorlunk]] works at a forge near these Shadowmoon mobs, and drops the [[Primed Key Mold]] which starts the quest chain to create the [[Shattered Halls Key]].
