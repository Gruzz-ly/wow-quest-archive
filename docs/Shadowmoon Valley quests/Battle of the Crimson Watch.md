==Objectives==
Battle the forces of [[Illidan]] at [[Crimson Watch]] and survive!

Return to [[A'dal]] at [[Shattrath City]] should you emerge the victor.

*[[Crimson Sigil]] Forces Annihilated
*Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
They are probably searching for you on the [[Path of Conquest]] as we speak.  You must make your escape, <race>!

Leave me, I'm done for...  They...  I think I hear them coming.  It's now or never!  Get out!  If you choose to stay, you will have to fight!

If you fight and somehow manage to survive, take what you have learned here and deliver that knowledge to A'dal in Shattrath City.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Acrobat's Mark of the Sha'tar
|Aggressor's Mark of the Sha'tar
|Mage's Mark of the Sha'tar
|Spiritualist's Mark of the Sha'tar
}}

{{itembox|You will also receive: {{cost|13|20}}
|Green Trophy Tabard of the Illidari
|Purple Trophy Tabard of the Illidari
}}

==Progression==
<A'dal greets you.>

==Completion==
This Crimson Sigil will be investigated.  They pose a threat to all life on [[Draenor]].  I foresee a day when their dark master has to answer for his crimes.  Perhaps it will be you who brings him to justice, hero.

==Notes==
This fight involves waves of enemies.

Wave 1: Dreadlord, Felguards and blood elves. The demons can be banished, the humanoids can be sheeped/feared.

Wave 2: Two "Beholders", called Illidari mind-breakers. The mind-breakers have two spells: A [[Mind Blast]] that causes 4000 damage, and a drain spell that does 500 damage per second.

Wave 3: Four Illidari highlords (more blood elves). They use Flamestrike and a debuff that increases Fire damage you take by 50%. It is recommended that the tank move these around in a circle to avoid the Flamestrikes.

Wave 4: The boss, [[Torloth the Magnificent]]. He has an AoE Shadowfury that does 1500 damage and knocks players back. Beyond that, he can be simply tanked down.  If a player is casting a heal and is knocked back by his Shadowfury, the heal will heal about 50% of his health, so have your healer move away when he casts Shadowfury.
