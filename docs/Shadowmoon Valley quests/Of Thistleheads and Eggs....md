==Objectives==
Find a Rotten Arakkoa Egg and deliver it to [[Tobias the Filth Gorger]] in [[Shattrath City]].
*[[Rotten Arakkoa Egg]]

==Description==
I'd have given up had I not noticed...  He's a Thistlehead.  I couldn't place it at first but the signs are all there...

Now if we could get our hands on some [[:bloodthistle]], we'd be in business.

In my travels, I met a shady [[Broken]] in Shattrath named Tobias.

Tobias made a business of trading bloodthistle to [[Blood elf|blood elves]] for rotten [[arakkoa]] eggs.

Directly west of here are arakkoa ruins.  Search them for an egg and head to the [[Lower City|lower city]] of Shattrath.  That's where you'll find Tobias.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|59}}
*12650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Tobias raises an eyebrow.>

Bloodthistle?  Never heard of it...  Are you a [[Shattrath City Peacekeeper|peacekeeper]]?  You know you'd have to tell me if you were...  I've got rights!

==Completion==
You've got a rotten arakkoa egg?  Well why didn't you say so!  I think we can do business.

<Tobias smiles, exposing a mouthful of decay and filth.>
