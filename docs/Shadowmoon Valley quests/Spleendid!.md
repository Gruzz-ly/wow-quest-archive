==Objectives==
Gnomus at [[Wildhammer Stronghold]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to recover 8 Felfire Spleens.
*[[Felfire Spleen]] (8)

==Description==
Have you ever heard of food that cooks itself and stays hot forever? Dare to dream, I say!

But maybe it's not a dream at all! Outside the fortress, near the lava pools and streams, you can find beasts that thrive in the sizzling heat. They're called felfire diemetradons.

The dwarves around here tell me that those diemetradons have the tastiest spleens ever and that the spleens practically come pre-cooked! Bring me those spleens and I'll give you some coin.

Start your search directly east of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Spleens! I need spleens!

==Completion==
<Gnomus hungrily grabs at the spleens.>

Here's your coin as promised. I'll call for you if I need more spleens.

So delicious... I dare say that they are 'spleendid!'
