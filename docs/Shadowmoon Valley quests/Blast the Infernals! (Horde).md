==Objectives==
Use the Fel Bomb while standing on the green glyph in Legion Hold to destroy the [[infernals]], then report to Blood Guard Gulmok at [[Shadowmoon Village]].
*Destroy Legion Hold Infernals
*[[Fel Bomb]] (provided)

==Description==
The device we've assembled won't win any beauty contests, but it should be capable of destroying the infernals amassed at [[Legion Hold]]. Judging from what the fel reaver power core's energy did to the Fetid Pool, it holds a respectable amount of explosive power.

If you set the device off in the middle of the green glyph at the hold, it should be in range to hit all of the infernals.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Bloodforged Guard|Crimson Mail Hauberk|Mooncrest Headdress|Soothsayer's Kilt}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|10}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Have you found a way to destroy the Legion's infernal stockpile?

==Completion==
<Gulmok nods grimly.>

This is no time for celebration, <name>. We're not out of the fire yet. I've got new orders for you.

==Progression==
{{Besieged!}}
