This quest is part of a chain that starts with [[Bring Down the Warbringer!]]

==Objectives==
Report to [[Plexi]] at [[Invasion Point: Cataclysm]].

==Description==
Now that we have access to the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s base at Invasion Point: Cataclysm, we need to figure out a way to shut down their operations there. [[Wildhammer Stronghold]] won't be safe until the Legion's presence is erased from [[Shadowmoon Valley]].

I've sent an advance party up to the invasion point to help you formulate a plan to destroy the Legion's supplies. Go back to [[Legion Hold]] and step into the teleporter with the green crystals above it. Plexi will meet you at your destination.

==Completion==
Pleased to meet you, <name>. Name's Plexi.

I won't bore you with formalities. We both know why we're here. Now, let's get to work.
