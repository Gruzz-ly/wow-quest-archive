==Objectives==
Researcher Tiorus at [[Shadowmoon Village]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to travel to the lava flow near the [[Ruins of Baa'ri]] and use the [[Arcano Control Unit]] to control an [[Arcano-Scorp]], swim in the lava with the Arcano-Scorp, and tag 8 Greater Felfire Diemetradons.
*[[Greater Felfire Diemetradon]] Tagged (8)

==Description==
We must study these creatures further.

Far to the east - near the huge lava flow beneath the ruins of Baa'ri - you will find arcano control units. These controllers were crafted by a genius named {{NPC||Gnomus}} for the sole purpose of exploring lava via mechanical scorpion.

He has long since lost his mind and is now only interested in eating the hottest food known to [[gnome]]-kind.

<Tiorus gives you a funny look.>

I want you to use the control and tag the diemetradons of the lava flow for further study.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|11|48|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Listen, I do not have the time nor the inclination to explain what any of this means. Just tag those diemetradons.

==Completion==
Listen, there is no time to spare. I've been watching the tagged diemetradons and have discovered that they all report to a gigantic, nay, ENORMOUS, diemetradon named [[Felspine the Greater]].
