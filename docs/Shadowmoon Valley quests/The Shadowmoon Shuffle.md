==Objectives==
Recover 6 pieces of Eclipsion Armor.
*[[Eclipsion Armor]] (6)

==Description==
<[[Borak, Son of Oronok|Borak]] looks you up and down.>

This is going to be tricky, but I think I can make it work.

I can disguise you as one of these [[Illidari]] [[blood elf|blood elves]], <name>. What I need first, though, are several pieces of their armor. It is imperative that the armor be clean. No blood stains! We want to avoid suspicion.

Bring me the gear and I'll take care of the rest of the disguise.

Once the disguise is assembled, you're going to deliver the message to the [[Grand Commander Ruusk|Grand Commander]] - in person.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|7|59}}
*12650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It's far too complicated, <class>. You wouldn't understand.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. I hope you are a good actor. The next step in my grand plan is going to require some theatrics!

==Progression==
{{Hand of Gul'dan}}
