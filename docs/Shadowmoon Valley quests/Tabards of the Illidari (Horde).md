==Objectives==
Collect 10 Illidari Tabards and then use the [[:Kor'kron Flare Gun]] to signal another [[Kor'kron Wind Rider]].

Speak with [[Overlord Or'barokh]] at [[Shadowmoon Village]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] should you lose your Kor'kron Flare Gun and require a replacement. 
*[[Illidari Tabard]] (10)

==Description==
The wind riders must return to [[Shadowmoon Village]] to prepare for the next phase of our assault. What I need from you now are the tabards that these blood elves wear.

When you have collected enough tabards, call for a wind rider using the Kor'kron flare gun. Prepare yourself for a bit of espionage, &lt;race&gt;!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you to report, soldier?

==Completion==
Ah-ha! These will do quite nicely.
