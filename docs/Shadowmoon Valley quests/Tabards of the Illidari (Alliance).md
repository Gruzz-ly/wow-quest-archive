==Objectives==
Collect 10 Illidari Tabards and then use the [[:Wildhammer Flare Gun]] to signal another [[Wildhammer Gryphon Rider]].

*[[Illidari Tabard]] (10)

==  Description ==
The gryphon riders must return to [[Wildhammer Stronghold]] to prepare for the next phase of our assault. What I need from you now are the tabards that these blood elves wear.

When you have collected enough tabards, call for a gryphon rider using the Wildhammer flare gun. Prepare yourself for a bit of espionage, &lt;race&gt;!

==Rewards ==
You will receive:
*4,300 [[XP]]

==  Progress ==
What have you to report, soldier?

==  Completion ==
Ah-ha! These will do quite nicely.
