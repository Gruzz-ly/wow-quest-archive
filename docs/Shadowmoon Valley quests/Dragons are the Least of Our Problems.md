'''Dragons are the Least of Our Problems''' is a once-daily quest tasking players to kill 15 Nethermine Flayers and 5 Nethermine Ravagers inside the [[Netherwing Mines]]. This quest is available starting at {{reputation|friendly}} reputation after completing [[The Netherwing Mines]].

==Objectives==
The [[Dragonmaw Foreman]] at the [[Netherwing Mines]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to kill 15 Nethermine Flayers and 5 Nethermine Ravagers.
*[[Nethermine Flayer]] slain (15)
*[[Nethermine Ravager]] slain (5)

==Description==
That dragon waking up riled up a host of other nasty creatures in these mines. Two types are proving to be a thorn in the side of the Dragonmaw: Nethermine flayers and Nethermine ravagers. You must help us by killing them off. All I ask is your involvement once per day.

Get in there and kill as many as you can!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|11|99}}

==Progress==
How's that flayer infestation problem coming along?

==Completion==
That'll be enough for today, overseer. Come back tomorrow for another round of clean up.

==Notes==
Ravagers are much more rare than Flayers and path throughout the flayer area.

There are two important things to remember:
*Work with others. You'll get more ravagers and less aggrivation if you're in a group doing the same quest. Though you might not get as many Netherwing Crystals.
*Be Patient. This quest brings out the inner jerk in people. The ravagers will respawn. Do not steal kills, as it might carry the same social effects as ninja looting.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.1.0|note=Added.}}
