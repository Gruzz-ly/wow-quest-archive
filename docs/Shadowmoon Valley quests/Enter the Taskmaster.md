'''Enter the Taskmaster''' is the followup to [[In Service of the Illidari]], part of the post-{{reputation|neutral}} [[Netherwing]] storyline quests. After completing this quest, all of the other quests at {{reputation|neutral}} become available.

==Objectives==
Speak with Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath at Dragonmaw Base Camp.

==Description==
<Mor'ghor crumples up the service letter and tosses it aside.>

Alright grunt, first things first. If you're gonna join my beloved Dragonmaw army, you'll need to work. Everyone works up here on the ledge. Get a job and don't screw it up and I'll see if there might be something more interesting for you to do later.

Go talk to Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath. He's standin' in the middle of town. He'll assess your skills and assign work as he sees fit.

Now get out of my face!

==Completion==
Varkule gonna set you up right, [[grunt]]. You get your choice of one job best suited to your skills and Netherwing crystal collection. You'll be required to fill your work orders once per day.

Yeah, it's a bunch of crap jobs but even the [[Dragonmaw Ascendant|ascendants]] started out as [[peon]]s.

==Progression==
# [[Blood Oath of the Netherwing]]
