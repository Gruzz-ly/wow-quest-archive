==Description==
The fortress of [[Legion Hold]] is nigh impregnable, and to be completely honest, I can't spare the forces for an assault. Our hopes are riding on you, <name>.

What little information we've been able to gather indicates that the Legion stocks and prepares its infernals at the hold. With the help of a disguise I'll give you, you must sneak into Legion Hold and learn about the their plans. Your best hope is to intercept or overhear communication between their commanders. Good luck, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38}} at level 70)

==Progress==
What did you discover?

==Completion==
<Wing Commander Nuainn listens to your report, growing more alarmed with each sentence.>

So you're saying they have more than enough [[infernal]]s to intensify the bombardment? If we don't stop them before they can put the next phase of their plan into motion, Wildhammer Stronghold is finished.

==Progression==
{{Besieged!}}
