'''Your Friend On The Inside''' is [[Yarzill the Merc]]'s introduction quest, available after completing [[Enter the Taskmaster]] at {{reputation|neutral}} reputation with [[Netherwing]].

Didn't think we'd leave you to face the fel orc army by yourself, did you?

<Yarzill's eyes flicker a translucent blue.>

Aye, we are here with you, <name>. For every service you perform for the fel orcs in your quest to reclaim Netherwing lands, we'll be at your side to make sure that they [[Merely a setback|suffer a sufficient setback]].

You'll need to keep a low profile so as not to draw any unwanted attention to yourself during your sabotage missions.
