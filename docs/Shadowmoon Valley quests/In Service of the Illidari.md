'''In Service of the Illidari''' is a [[Netherwing]] quest. Players deceive a [[Dragonmaw Clan|Dragonmaw]] Overlord into thinking that they are a recruit to his labor force, in order to better subvert the goals of the orc clan. Players must complete [[Blood Oath of the Netherwing]] before accepting this quest. After completing the follow up to this quest, [[Enter the Taskmaster]], all of the quests at {{reputation|neutral}} with [[Netherwing]] are available.

==Objectives==
Travel to [[Netherwing Ledge]] and deliver the Illidari Service Papers to [[Overlord Mor'ghor]] at [[Dragonmaw Base Camp]].
*[[Illidari Service Papers]] (provided)

==Description==
Netherwing Ledge... What was once a bastion of sanctuary for the [[Netherwing]] is now home to the Dragonmaw. While the [[Fel orc|orcs]] may have control of our territory, our magic there is still strong. Strong enough to cloak your true identity and allow you to infiltrate the ranks of Dragonmaw.

I have prepared this letter for you to present to their leader, Overlord Mor'ghor. Fly headlong into the maw of our enemy and seek out Dragonmaw Base Camp to start your new life as a fel orc of Illidan Stormrage.

==Progress==
<Mor'ghor grunts.>

You're late...

==Completion==
<Mor'ghor reads the letter and laughs.>

A [[Death knight (Old Horde)|death knight]]? You couldn't shine the boots of a death knight, maggot.

<Mor'ghor looks you over.>

But yes... You might be able to work your way up to peon. At the worst, I'll toss you into the pit and leave you to die...

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|whisper|Mordenai|Beware the Dragonmaw Skybreakers and ascendants as they are not fooled by our magic! Always keep your distance from those entities!}}

As players approach the [[Dragonmaw Fortress]], [[Dragonmaw Skyway]] or [[Netherwing Ledge]], they will automatically become disguised as a [[Dragonmaw Clan|Dragonmaw]] [[fel orc]].
