This quest is part of a chain that starts with [[Bring Down the Warbringer!]]

==Objectives==
Bring a Legion Teleporter Control to [[Wing Commander Nuainn]] at [[Wildhammer Stronghold]]. The [[Mo'arg Weaponsmith]]s at [[Legion Hold]] are known to carry the devices.
*[[Legion Teleporter Control]]

==Description==
According to [[Razuun's Orders|Razuun's orders]], the massive [[infernal]] staging area is called [[Invasion Point: Cataclysm]] and it's nestled in the northern mountains. The only way to reach it is by using a teleporter located at Legion Hold.

Certain members of the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] host carry devices allowing them to activate the teleporters. You must capture one of these devices to win access to the teleporter. Slaughter all of the [[demon]]s if you must, but you can't afford to return empty-handed.

==Progression==
We must find a way to destroy the rest of those infernals, <name>. We've come far, but failure could still cost us everything.

==Completion==
Let me see if I can find out how this works...

==Progression==
