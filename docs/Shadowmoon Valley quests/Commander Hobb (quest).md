'''Arcanist Thelis''' directs [[Scryers]]-affiliated players outside to [[Commander Hobb]]. This quest is available at {{reputation|revered}} reputation with [[Netherwing]] after completing [[Kill Them All! (Scryers)]]

==Objectives==
Give the Dragonmaw Flare to [[Commander Hobb]] at the [[Sanctum of the Stars]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]].
*[[Dragonmaw Flare Gun]] (provided)

==Description==
The Dragonmaw only dare attack us when our guard is down. They would face certain defeat if they were to attack us while we were prepared.

I want you to let them come, <name>.

<Thelis nods.>

Yes... a trap. Take this flare that their overlord gave you and deliver it to Commander Hobb. He is standing guard right outside this building.

==Progress==
<Hobb nods.>

==Completion==
<Hobb grins.>

The deadliest trap ever laid...
