==Objectives==
Report to [[Stormer Ewan Wildwing]] at the [[Deathforge Tower]].

==Description==
From your findings at [[Legion Hold]], we know that the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s [[Shadow Council]] allies are producing [[infernal]]s in the [[Deathforge]]. I've dispatched a small scouting party to keep watch over the area, but they're not able to accomplish everything we need.

If the Deathforge is left alone to operate, they'll rebuild the infernal stockpile that you destroyed at Legion Hold.

I want you to meet up with Stormer Ewan Wildwing, at the Deathforge Tower, to the northwest, overlooking the Deathforge itself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1250 [[XP]] (or {{cost||75}} at level 70)

==Completion==
<The [[dwarf]] nods.>

It'll be good to have the backup. We've gathered some preliminary information on what the Shadow Council is up to in there, but I'll feel better once we're able to start taking action against them.

==Progression==
{{Besieged!}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
