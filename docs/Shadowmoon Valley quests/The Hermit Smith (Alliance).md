==Objectives==
Bring the Box of Ingots to [[David Wayne]] at Wayne's Refuge in [[Terokkar Forest]].
*[[Box of Ingots]] (provided)

==Description==
<Ordinn examines the results from his attempt at smithing the metal and shakes his head.>

This is beyond my ability, but that's not to say the weapon can't be recreated for your use.

There was a talented smith who accompanied the Sons of Lothar to Draenor, [[David Wayne]]. He was a remarkable blacksmith, but chose to leave the expedition. These days, he lives in a small camp on a peninsula east of Firewing Point in [[Terokkar Forest]]. Take the ingots to him and see if he can help you with the weapon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1250 [[XP]] (or {{cost||75|}} at max level)

==Progress==
What brings you here, <class>? I don't get many visitors.

==Completion==
Ordinn sent you with these?

<The smith examines the ingots.>

He was right. Most of the magic is gone, but I can still sense traces of it. With some work and a few 'exotic' resources, I can forge you a powerful anti-demon sword from this metal.
