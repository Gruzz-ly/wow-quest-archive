The last quest of this line will grant you '''Neutral''' faction with the Netherwing Drakes.

==Objectives==
Seek out [[Neltharaku]], patron of the [[Netherwing]] Dragonflight.

==Description==
Their patron soars high above, <name>. Perhaps the kindness that you showed his children has moved his heart. Seek Neltharaku out and enlist his aid. Together, you may be able to solve the plight of the Netherwing drakes.

<Mordenai points to the sky.>

Fly high, friend...

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|89}}

==Completion==
My children have told me of your heroic deeds, <race>. There is more that you can do.

== Notes ==
Neltharaku is hard to talk to.  He's in the air, and occasionally moves around.  Two ways successful means of talking to him:
* Enable "Click to Move", and click on Neltharaku.
* Fly directly underneath Neltharaku.  You may need to anticipate his flight.

Reports have listed Neltharaku at {{coords|57|55|Shadowmoon Valley}} and travelling between there and {{coords|68|66|Shadowmoon Valley}}.
