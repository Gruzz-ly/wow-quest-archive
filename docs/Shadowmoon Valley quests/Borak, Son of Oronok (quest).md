==Objectives==
Find [[Borak, Son of Oronok|Borak]] hiding near [[Eclipse Point]], far to the south. He watches from the shadows of the bridge.

==Description==
While [[Ar'tor, Son of Oronok|Ar'tor]] was off hunting and [[Grom'tor, Son of Oronok|Grom'tor]] was off fighting, Borak studied. Eventually he took up a vocation as a scholar and left for the wilds of [[Draenor]]. He returned home a few years ago a changed [[orc]].

His heightened sense of awareness and mental acuity had forged a silent [[assassin]].

Now a confident and powerful orc, he has taken to recovering the most guarded piece of the cipher.

Find Borak hiding near Eclipse Point, far to the south. He watches from the shadows of the bridge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|89|}}
*3,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Borak is silent for a moment.>

I've been watching these [[blood elf|blood elves]] for weeks now, trying to get a lock on where they've hidden the [[Third Fragment of the Cipher of Damnation|third part]] of [[:the Cipher of Damnation]].

Thus far, I've been unsuccessful in gathering any clues. The only thing I do know is that [[Illidan Stormrage|Illidan]] sends an envoy from the [[Black Temple]] here once a day.

This envoy is untouchable. I've shadowed him for a week, trying to figure out how to separate him from his bodyguard. Unfortunately, the bodyguard never leaves his side.
