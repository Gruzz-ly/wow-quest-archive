'''Earning Your Wings...''' is an introduction quest offered by [[Ja'y Nosliw]] at {{reputation|honored}} reputation with [[Netherwing]].

==Completion==
So you wanna join the Skybreakers, eh? You've certainly proven yourself an able Dragonmaw but that means nothing in the skies of Outland. The question has to be answered: CAN YOU FLY?

And I don't just mean being able to mount up on a nether drake and delivering a shipment of crystals to the fort like those transporter scrubs. I'm talking about being the best... The top orc...

Over to the west there are six riders. Defeat them all and I will grant you Skybreaker wings.

== Notes ==
This quest is a prerequisite to the race quests.  There are no objectives, you just talk to him and click complete and then you will be able to start the first race.
