'''Lord Illidan Stormrage''' is the second of the three {{reputation|exalted}} storyline quests, available starting at {{reputation|exalted}} reputation with [[Netherwing]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Illidan Stormrage]]. Seek out [[Barthamus]] in the [[Lower City]] of [[Shattrath]] should you survive.
*Meeting with Illidan Stormrage
*Return to Barthamus at Shattrath in Terrokar Forest.

==Description==
Come, highlord <name>. Illidan himself awaits us!

==Progress==
You've had quite an adventure, <name>.

==Completion==
I was the first, you know. The abandoned child of a monster...

<Barthamus shakes his head.>

We owe you everything, <name>. You have single-handedly shattered the Dragonmaw empire and gathered enough information to keep my brethren occupied for ten lifetimes.

It is not much but there is something that we can offer... My kin have each offered to join you on your mission in Outland. Simply ask and they will bond with you.

==Notes==
*At the end of the sequence, the trip back to Shattrath is slow, as Yarzill flies at about walking speed. It is advised to have the necessary time before triggering this quest. It takes 15 minutes to return to Shattrath.
*For hunters (and possibly warlocks) when the script runs its course and the player gets the debuff, this buff isn't transferred to the pet as well, making every guard in the vicinity kill the pet. To avoid this, dismiss the pet.
