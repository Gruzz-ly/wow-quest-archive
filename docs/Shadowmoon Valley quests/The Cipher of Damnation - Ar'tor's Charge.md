==Objectives==
The [[Spirit of Ar'tor]] at [[Illidari Point]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to recover the Second Fragment of the Cipher of Damnation from [[Veneratus the Many]].

Creatures attacked or damaged by the Spirit Hunter will not yield loot or experience.
*[[Second Fragment of the Cipher of Damnation]]

==Description==
At last, we are ready. I will bestow a piece of my spirit upon you, hero. It will guard you and help you in your battle against evil.

You must then travel south of here towards the back of Illidari Point. Hidden in the ether is a vile creature known as Veneratus the Many. My spirit hunter will call him out when he is near.

Destroy Veneratus and take from his corpse the second part of [[:the Cipher of Damnation]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|48|}}
* 15,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The cipher must be recovered!

==Completion==
<Ar'tor fades in and out of existence.>

It would seem that my time is nearly at an end, hero.

==Notes==
Creatures attacked or damaged by the Spirit Hunter will not yield loot or experience.

The spirit hunter acts like a hunter's pet; if you fly, it follows you along the ground and aggros everything along the way. With a little care, it is possible to avoid things. 

When you get close to the location, red lightning hits the ground and [[Veneratus the Many]] appears. Spend a little time clearing out the area before you get to the point where he summons and you won't aggro too many demons.
