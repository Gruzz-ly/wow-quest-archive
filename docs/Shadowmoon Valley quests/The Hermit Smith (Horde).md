==Objectives==
Bring the Box of Ingots to [[David Wayne]] at [[Wayne's Refuge]] in [[Terokkar Forest]].
*[[Box of Ingots]] (provided)

==Description==
<The orc shakes his head at his failure.>

This is beyond my ability, but that's not to say the weapon can't be recreated.

It pains me to suggest this, but your only hope may be a human smith by the name of David Wayne. It's true he was once a member of the Alliance's expedition, but that was a long time ago and he has since left the [[Sons of Lothar]]. These days, he lives in a small camp on a peninsula east of [[Firewing Point]] in Terokkar Forest. Take the ingots to him and see if he can help you.

==Progress==
What brings you here, <class>? I don't get many visitors.

==Completion==
<The smith frowns and examines the ingots.>

I'll be frank with you, <class>. I'm a relic of an age when cooperation with the Horde was unthinkable.

I am not so blind as to see that we do not have common enemies. I will help you to reforge the anti-demon weapon but it's going to take a lot of hard work and a few 'exotic' resources.
