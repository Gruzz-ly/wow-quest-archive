==Objectives==
Obtain a Fel Reaver Power Core and a Fel Reaver Armor Plate, then bring them to Blood Guard Gulmok at [[Shadowmoon Village]].
*[[Fel Reaver Power Core]]
*[[Fel Reaver Armor Plate]]

==Description==
We can't allow the [[Legion]] to trample us on their march to [[Black Temple]].

Find a way to destroy the infernals they intend to use against us. That's not a request, <name>; it's an order.

[[The Fetid Pool]] near Legion Hold holds an old [[fel reaver]] power core you could use as the basis for a kind of fel bomb. Search the other wreckage near the fel reaver for a section of armor plating. You should be able to make a bomb powerful enough to take out those [[infernals]] and give the hold a nice shake!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38}} at level 70)

==Progress==
<You hand the materials to Gulmok.>

==Completion==
<Gulmok slips the power core inside of the casing, then seals it.>

That should do the trick. I wouldn't want to be in the hold when that thing goes off.

==Progression==
{{Besieged!}}

==Notes and trivia==
*The armor plate is not near the Fetid Pool as the quest text may imply.  Search north of Legion Hold for what looks like a small Fel Reaver being assembled.
*The name of this quest could be a reference to the phrase "Someone set us up the bomb", which is part of the opening scene to the 1980s video game ''Zero Wing''. The game became infamous for the ''"All your base are belong to us"'' phenomenon.
