==Objectives==

*[[Morgroron's Glaive]]
*[[Makazradon's Glaive]]
Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
With a larger supply of this material, we might be able to forge a weapon for you to use.

The two pit lords at Legion Hold, Makazradon and Morgroron, have already been equipped with these anti-demon weapons. We have no way of knowing how many more the Legion intends to produce, but if we can capture these prototypes, there should be enough for our project.

<Ordinn grins.>

There's a certain amount of satisfaction in using the Legion's own 'secret weapons' against them, don't you think?

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Ashwalker's Footwraps|Azurestrike Shoulders|Darkhunter's Cinch|Singed Vambraces}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you capture those prototypes?

==Completion==
These should work nicely. Now, let's forge them into a more useful form.
