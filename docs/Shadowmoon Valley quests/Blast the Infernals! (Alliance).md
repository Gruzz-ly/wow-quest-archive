==Objectives==
Use the Fel Bomb while standing on the green glyph in [[Legion Hold]], then report to [[Wing Commander Nuainn]] at [[Wildhammer Stronghold]].
*Destroy Legion Hold Infernals
*[[Fel Bomb]] (provided)

==Description==
The device we've assembled won't win any beauty contests, but it should be capable of destroying the [[infernal]]s amassed at Legion Hold. Judging from what the fel reaver power core's energy did to the [[Fetid Pool]], it holds a respectable amount of explosive power.

If you set the device off in the middle of the green glyph at the hold, it should be in range to hit all of the infernals.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Bloodforged Guard|Crimson Mail Hauberk|Mooncrest Headdress|Soothsayer's Kilt}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|10}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Have you found a way to destroy the Legion's infernal stockpile?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>! I wish I could say that the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] would give up after a setback like this, but you and I know better than that. The [[Deathforge]] that you learned about during your reconnaissance mission will be our next target.

==Progression==
{{Besieged!}}
