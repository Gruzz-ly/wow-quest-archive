==Objectives==
[[Zorus the Judicator]] at [[Wildhammer Stronghold]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to find the [[Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit]].

If you lose your Spectrecles, Zorus the Judicator can make you a new pair.
*[[Spectrecles]] (provided)

==Description==
Stories abound about the life of [[Teron Gorefiend]], but most are just that - stories. We do not know what happened to Gorefiend after he returned to [[Draenor]].

The only thing we are certain of is that he has already died once.

I have heard the scouts here speaking of an ancient orc spirit that resides at the [[Altar of Shadows]], far to the east, across the [[Netherwing Fields]] and through [[Netherwing Pass]]. Take the Spectrecles and track this orc down. He will surely have more information on Gorefiend.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*6250 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|75|}} at max level)

==Completion==
Gorefiend? Why, I have not heard that name in ages!

After the [[Second War]], Gorefiend returned here, along with his [[death knight]]s. Unable to cope with the terrible nature of his new form and without the support of his beloved leader, [[Gul'dan]], Gorefiend killed himself.

If he walks these lands now as a spirit, it is news to me. Yet, perhaps I can divine such knowledge with your assistance.
