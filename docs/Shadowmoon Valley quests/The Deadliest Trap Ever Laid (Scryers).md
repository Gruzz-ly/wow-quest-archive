'''The Deadliest Trap Ever Laid''' pits a suggested group of three [[Scryers]]-affiliated players against waves of [[Dragonmaw Clan|Dragonmaw]] Skybreakers at the [[Sanctum of the Stars]] once a day. This quest is available at {{reputation|revered}} reputation with [[Netherwing]] after completing [[Commander Hobb (quest)]]. The [[Aldor]] version of this quest is [[The Deadliest Trap Ever Laid (Aldor)]].

==Objectives==
Assist [[Commander Hobb]] and the [[Scryers]] in defending the [[Sanctum of the Stars]]. Once all of the [[Dragonmaw Clan|Dragonmaw]] forces have been defeated, return to [[Overlord Mor'ghor]] at [[Dragonmaw Base Camp]] with the Scryer Medals.
*Dragonmaw Forces Defeated
*[[Scryer Medals]] (provided)

Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
Take these Scryer medals. Mor'ghor will need proof of "victory" once this is over. He will recognize them as coming from the corpses of fallen Scryer soldiers.

Now all that remains is to use the signal flare to alert the Dragonmaw raiders. We will crush them when you are ready. Just give me the word.

==Progress==
Did you crush them under your boot, commander?

==Completion==
<Mor'ghor laughs.>

HAH! I knew you wouldn't let me down, commander! I want you to lead a raid on the Sanctum of the Stars at least once per day. They will have no choice but to leave Shadowmoon!

==Notes==
This is an endurance quest. The amount of damage done by the mobs pretty much means that it cannot be soloed by non-healing classes, even though the graveyard is seconds away from the fight and Commander has lots of health.
