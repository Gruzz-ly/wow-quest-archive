'''Oronu the Elder''' sends the player off to intercept some orders sent from [[Akama]] to one of his subordinates.

==Objectives==
Anchorite Ceyla at the Altar of Sha'tar wants you to obtain the Orders from Akama from Oronu the Elder at the Ruins of Baa'ri.

Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease. 
*[[Orders From Akama]]

==Description==
According to the tablets, an artifact known as a Medallion of Karabor was kept at Baa'ri. Only the highest-ranking draenei priests were granted these, as they allowed unfettered access into the Temple of Karabor.

We must find out whether the Ashtongue have recovered the medallion that was kept at Baa'ri yet. Its power would provide great aid in our fight against Illidan.

Akama's lieutenant at Baa'ri, Oronu the Elder, receives written orders from him daily. Obtain them and bring them to me.  

==Progress==
Any news yet, <name>?  Time is not on our side.

==Completion==
Akama's very own handwriting.  It is truly sad to think of what became of one as wise and beloved as he.

==Notes==
*Oronu can be found on a balcony at the Ruins of Baa'ri.{{Coords|57|32|Shadowmoon Valley}}.
