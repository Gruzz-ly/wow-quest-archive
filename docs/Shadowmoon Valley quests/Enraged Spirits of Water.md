==Objectives==
[[Earthmender Torlok]] at the [[Altar of Damnation]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to use the Totem of Spirits to capture 5 Watery Souls.
*[[Totem of Spirits]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Illidari]] naga of the region have taken control of the only clean water supply that exists in Shadowmoon Valley.

Directly north of here you will find the lair of the naga: [[Coilskar Point|Coilskar]]. Around Coilskar are pockets of agitated water that howl to the land in anguish. It is at those pockets that the enraged spirits of water now wander.

Travel to Coilskar and use to totem of spirits to capture watery souls. You will find the largest concentration of these spirits near [[Coilskar Cistern]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 12650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Wherever you find naga you will almost certainly find tortured water spirits.

==Completion==
Only air remains, <name>.

==Notes==
You are given a totem which you must drop before the Enraged Water Spirit is killed. Once it is killed within range of the totem, your questlog will mark off one more soul captured. Multiple spirits can be killed using the same totem (about three at the maximum before it dies), but the totems are unlimited, and don't have a long cooldown for placement, so this is somewhat necessary. These elementals are found to the north, in the pools by [[Coilskar Point]] and [[Coilskar Cistern]].
