==Objectives==
[[Oronok Torn-heart]] at [[Oronok's Farm]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to recover 10 Shadowmoon Tubers from the [[Shattered Plains]].

He also wants Oronok's Boar Whistle back when you're done.
*[[Shadowmoon Tuber]] (10)
*[[Oronok's Boar Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
I've been a lot of things, stranger, but what I once was isn't what's important. What I am now is what matters and what I am now is a farmer.

I use trained [[felboar]]s to dig up tubers from the hardened earth of the Shattered Plains. Recently, though, [[rock flayer|flayers]] from a nest to the northeast have been attacking my animals, preventing me from gathering tubers.

Would you go to the area north of here and gather tubers for me? Use this whistle while standing on a tuber mound and a boar will come dig one up!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12650 [[XP]]

{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Oronok's Tuber of Healing|Oronok's Tuber of Agility
|Oronok's Tuber of Strength|Oronok's Tuber of Spell Power
}}

==Progress==
Get me those tubers!

==Completion==
You say there were a lot more of those flayers than you expected? Looks like it's time to take out the trash.

==Notes==
This quest involves finding a tuber with a boar nearby, blowing the whistle and then digging it up.  This is complicated by the fact that the boars are often dead or busy fighting the ravenous flayers which infest the same area. When blowing the whistle, be sure that the boar is close enough.
