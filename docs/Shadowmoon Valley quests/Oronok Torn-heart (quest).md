==Objectives==
Seek out [[Oronok Torn-heart]] on the [[Shattered Plains|Shattered Shelf]]{{Sic}} - north of [[Coilskar Cistern]].

==Description==
I do not know how we can acquire the spell that the spirits mentioned, <name>. Truth be told, I don't even know where we would start such a search.

<[[Earthmender Torlok|Torlok]] stares off in the distance, lost in thought.>

Hrm... It is a long shot but it might be our only chance. There is an [[orc]] that I have seen visit this area before. I spoke to him briefly once. He is a hermit that claims to live above Coilskar Cistern to the northeast. Seek out this orc, Oronok Torn-heart.

As I said, it is a long shot.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||75|}}
* 1,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Words of damnation? Never heard of 'em. Take my advice: Let the dead rest.

But since you've already come all this way, I could use some help with a few other matters. What do you say?

==Notes==
The area is on a small promontory which is actually more east that north of Coilskar Cistern. It is easily accessible using a flying mount, but one can also get there on the ground.

==Progression==
