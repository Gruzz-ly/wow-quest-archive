'''Anchorite Ceyla''' directs [[Aldor]]-affiliated players outside to [[Commander Arcus]]. This quest is available at {{reputation|revered}} reputation with [[Netherwing]] after completing [[Kill Them All! (Aldor)]].

==Objectives==
Give the Dragonmaw Flare to [[Commander Arcus]] at the [[Altar of Sha'tar]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]].
*[[Dragonmaw Flare Gun]] (provided)

==Description==
The Dragonmaw only dare attack us when our guard is down. They would face certain defeat if they were to attack us while we were prepared.

I want you to let them come, <name>.

<Ceyla nods.>

Yes... a trap. Take this flare that their overlord gave you and deliver it to Commander Arcus. He is standing guard right outside this building.

==Progress==
<Arcus nods.>

==Completion==
<Arcus grins.>

The deadliest trap ever laid...
