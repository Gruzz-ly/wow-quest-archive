'''Dragonmaw Race: Wing Commander Mulverick''' is the fifth of six race quests, available at {{reputation|honored}} reputation with [[Netherwing]].

==Objectives==
Follow [[Wing Commander Mulverick]] while attempting to stay on your [[flying mount]]. Should you defeat Wing Commander Mulverick, report your victory to [[Ja'y Nosliw]] at the [[Dragonmaw Base Camp]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]].
*Wing Commander Mulverick Defeated
*Return to Ja'y Nosliw at [[Netherwing Ledge]] in Shadowmoon Valley.

==Description==
Three years of blood, sweat and [[Vial of Tears|tears]]. Mostly [[Tear Stained Handkerchief|tears]]... The amount of crying that a [[Frostwolf Clan|hardened soldier]] does when it comes down to [[Alterac Valley|all-out war]] is amazing!

"They're jumping into our [[Dun Baldar North Bunker|tower]] with their horses!" "Why is [[Dun Baldar|their base]] so well defended?" "They're taking our [[Frostwolf Relief Hut|relief hut]], I'm going [[AFK|A.W.O.L.]]!"

Wimps...

I took the first train out of "[[Alterac Valley|cry-town]]" the minute the [[Dark Portal]] opened. Now I'm a top gun for the [[Dragonmaw Clan|Dragonmaw]]. If you want to be top orc, you'll have to defeat me.

We go when you are ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|80}}
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Netherwing]]

==Progress==
Mulverick is the most gifted rider I've ever seen. The only thing holding him back from the top orc spot is his recklessness.

==Completion==
Well it looks like it's just you and the captain now, grunt. Good luck! You're gonna need it!

==Notes==
There seems to be some kind of bug that causes players to dismount during the race like if they were hit by a lighting bolt (you see a lighting animation around you; like if you were hit) when actually they weren't. This happens during random series of barrages during the race. (can someone clarify this for me?) another point to this race is that at points in the race the commander will move around in a small section of the air, shooting his bolts around while he flies for about a yard or two in three random directions most of the time. after discussion with a Game master it has been confirmed this is not a bug, but part of the race. There also seems to be either a bug or just confusion between the attacks and the npc if you fly well enough where he will actually get caught by his own weapon, causing you to lose sight of him for a split second, then when you're getting your bearing back, he's already far ahead.

Compared to the previous four quests, Mulverick is quite difficult. In the last quarter of the race, he can seriously confuse players when he dips down below the dock and shoots his lightning balls all around. He also briefly does a similar trick right before the end of the race when he returns to the runway. If you beat him, know that he and Skyshatter are equally difficult, which is to say, if you can beat Mulverick, you can beat Skyshatter.

The race is not required to obtain the [[Netherwing drake mounts|Nether Drake]] mount.

;Win
:{{text|say|Wing Commander Mulverick|You're the best I've ever seen. I can't believe I'm saying this but you might have a chance against [[Captain Skyshatter|Skyshatter]]. And hey, if that doesn't go so well you can be my wing man...}}
