==Objectives==
Use The Cipher of Damnation at [[The Altar of Damnation]] to summon Cyrukh the Firelord.

Destroy Cyrukh the Firelord and then speak to [[Earthmender Torlok]], also found at The Altar of Damnation.
*[[Cyrukh the Firelord]] slain
*[[The Cipher of Damnation]] (provided)
*Suggested players: 5

==Description==
How many times has this spell been used in the history of our worlds? Undoubtedly, its power for destruction is unparalleled.

What you must do now is take the cipher, now made whole, and read it from [[The Altar of Damnation]] - where the memory of [[Gul'dan]] stands.

What you will see once the words are uttered are the memories left imprinted upon the land. Stand your ground and await the coming of [[Cyrukh the Firelord|Cyrukh]].

You must be victorious, <Name>. This land can not withstand another shattering.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
[[File:Symbol-in-the-sky.jpg|thumb|The mark of [[Kael'thas]]...]]
<[[Earthmender Torlok]] takes [[The Cipher of Damnation]] from you.>

You have done as the elements asked. For that, we are grateful. While you will be rewarded, trouble still looms. The spirits of fire are in turmoil. A claim has been made. [[The Cipher of Damnation]] is known by another.

It is cryptic, I know, but that is all the spirits would have me know. That and this symbol...

<[[Earthmender Torlok]] turns around and points into the sky.>

What could it mean?

==Notes==
*This is a 5 player group quest.
*After completing this quest, you should receive a [[Letter from Shattrath]] in the mail.

;Speaking with Oronok
We will fight when you are ready, <name>.

{{Gossip|I am ready, Oronok. Let us destroy Cyrukh and free the elements!}}

;When the player finishes the summoning
:{{text|emote|A flaming vortex takes shape.}}
:''Cyrukh the Firelord appears.''
:{{text|yell|Cyrukh the Firelord|You will suffer eternally!}}
:''Oronok Torn-heart and his two still-living sons comes flying on [[wyvern]]s.''
:{{text|yell|Oronok Torn-heart|You do not fight alone, <name>! Together, we will banish this spawn of hellfire!}}
:''Oronok and his two sons land a bit behind Gul'dan.''
:{{text|say|Oronok Torn-heart|We will fight when you are ready.}}
;When Oronok and his sons are running to face Cyrukh
:{{text|yell|Oronok Torn-heart|We will set the elements free of your grasp by force!}}
:{{text|yell|Cyrukh the Firelord|Little creature made of flesh, your wish is granted! Death comes for you!}}
;When Cyrukh is defeated
:{{text|say|Oronok Torn-heart|What say the elements, Torlok? I only hear silence.}}
:{{text|say|Earthmender Torlok|I hear what you hear, brother. Look behind you...}}
:''Four elementals, each representing an element, appear: [[Redeemed Spirit of Earth]], [[Redeemed Spirit of Fire]], [[Redeemed Spirit of Air]], [[Redeemed Spirit of Water]]''
:{{text|say|Oronok Torn-heart|They are redeemed! Then we have won?}}
:{{text|say|Redeemed Spirit of Earth|It is now as it should be, shaman. You have done well.}}
:{{text|say|Redeemed Spirit of Fire|Yes... Well enough for the elements that are here, but the cipher is known to another... The spirits of fire are in turmoil... If this force is not stopped, the world where these mortals came from will cease.}}
:{{text|say|Redeemed Spirit of Earth|Farewell, mortals... The earthmender knows what fire feels...}}
:''The elementals disappear.''
:{{text|say|Oronok Torn-heart|We leave, Torlok. I have only one request...}}
