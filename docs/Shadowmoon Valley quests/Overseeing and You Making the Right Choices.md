'''Overseeing and You: Making the Right Choices''' is a collection quest, having players collect 10 [[Knothide Leather]] and the [[Hardened Hide of Tyrantus]] from [[Tyrantus (Netherstorm)|Tyrantus]] in [[Eco-Dome Farfield]] in [[Netherstorm]]. Available at {{reputation|friendly}} reputation with [[Netherwing]] after completing [[Rise, Overseer!]]

==Objectives==
[[Chief Overseer Mudlump]] at the [[Dragonmaw Base Camp]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to bring him 10 pieces of Knothide Leather and 1 Hardened Hide of Tyrantus.
*[[Knothide Leather]] (10)
*[[Hardened Hide of Tyrantus]]

==Description==
So you're the new overseer, eh? Well there's one thing any good overseer needs and that's the proper disciplinary weapon. Before you can go out there and knock some sense into these peons you need to have your "piece". Each overseer has to gather the materials required to make their own "piece" and you'll be no different.

I'll need knothide leather and the hardened hide of Tyrantus. You'll find Tyrantus in Eco-Dome Farfield, located in the northern reaches of Netherstorm.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|40}}

==Progress==
There's peons to be disciplined, <name>! Hurry it up!

==Completion==
ARRR! You might make it as an overseer after all. That oversized lizard has been the bane of many an orc!

<Chief Overseer Mudlump begins to fashion the weapon.>

==Notes==
[[Tyrantus (Netherstorm)|Tyrantus]] is a [[devilsaur]] and is easily soloable, roughly 10,000 HP. It'll take most players longer to get to him from the [[Dragonmaw Base Camp|base camp]] than to kill him.
