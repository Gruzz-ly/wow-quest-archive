==Objectives==
Researcher Tiorus at [[Shadowmoon Village]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to recover 8 Felfire Spleens.
*[[Felfire Spleen]] (8)

==Description==
I am interested in learning more about the strange reptiles that mill about the lava flows of [[Shadowmoon Valley]]. Never have I seen beasts able to withstand the searing heat of molten lava!

Outside of [[Shadowmoon Village]], where the ground has ruptured and lava flows through the cracks, you will find [[Felfire Diemetradon|felfire diemetradons]]. Slay them and bring me their spleens. From their spleens I will be able to begin preliminary analysis of their resistance to heat.

Begin your search to the southeast.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Spleens! I need spleens!

==Completion==
<Researcher Tiorus takes the spleens and starts his examination.>

This may take a while. Take these coins for your hard work.
