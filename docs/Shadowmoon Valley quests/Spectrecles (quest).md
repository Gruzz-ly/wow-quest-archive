==Objectives==
Chief Apothecary Hildagard at [[Shadowmoon Village]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to slay 12 Shadowmoon Zealots. 
*[[Shadowmoon Zealot]] slain (12)
*[[Spectrecles]] (provided)

==Description==
I call them "Spectrecles." Clever, no? When you equip these goggles, you will be able to see the spirits of [[Shadowmoon Valley]].

Before I let you have them, though, you must promise me that you will help us clear out the ghosts at the village.

Take the goggles and destroy any and all spirits that you see wandering about [[Shadowmoon Village]]. Hopefully, destroying these spirits will force any that remain to move elsewhere. 

==Reward==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
If you lose your goggles, let me know and I will craft another pair. 

==Completion==
Gorefiend? T... Teron Gorefiend? But... How?

How could Gorefiend be here? This is impossible!

The legend of [[Teron Gorefiend]] is one that causes even the [[Forsaken]] to tremble in fear. By all accounts, Gorefiend was a [[warlock]] of [[Gul'dan]] - extremely powerful in his own right. When Gorefiend was slain by [[Orgrim Doomhammer]], Gul'dan took the soul of the fallen warlock and placed it inside the broken shell of a slain [[Brotherhood of the Horse|knight of Stormwind]]. And so was born the first [[Death knight (Old Horde)|death knight]] of the [[Old Horde|Horde]].

==Notes==
In case you need another glasses, speak with Hildagard:
:{{Gossip|Hildagard, I need a new pair of goggles.}}
