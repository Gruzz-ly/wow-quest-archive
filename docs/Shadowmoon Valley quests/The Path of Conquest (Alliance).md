*The Path of Conquest Discovered
*[[Wildhammer Flare Gun]](Provided)

==Description==
My gryphon riders have come back with a bit of news! The Eclipsion blood elves are planning something big. They've begun forming their armies at the Path of Conquest, located east of here - adjacent to Eclipse Point.

I want you to travel to the Path of Conquest and assess the situation. Once you've done so, use this flare gun to signal a gryphon rider. One will swoop down from the sky to meet you. Tell 'em what you've discovered and they'll give you the next set of orders.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9500 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|70|}} at max level)

==Progress==
What have you to report, soldier?

==Completion==
Indeed, these troublesome whelps are up to something insidious. We must investigate further...
