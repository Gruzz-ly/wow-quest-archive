'''Dragonmaw Race: Wing Commander Ichman''' is the fourth of six race quests, available at {{reputation|honored}} reputation with [[Netherwing]].

==Objectives==
Follow [[Wing Commander Ichman]] while attempting to stay on your [[flying mount]]. Should you defeat Wing Commander Ichman, report your victory to [[Ja'y Nosliw]] at the [[Dragonmaw Base Camp]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]].
*Wing Commander Ichman Defeated
*Return to Ja'y Nosliw at [[Netherwing Ledge]] in Shadowmoon Valley.

==Description==
Three years I spent in that [[Alterac Valley|hell hole]]. Three years a prisoner of war to the damnable [[Frostwolf Clan]]. Made to sit in their [[West Frostwolf Tower|tower]] and listen to them endlessly whine about the bridge to [[Dun Baldar]]. About how it's "unfair" that blah, blah, blah, blah... War isn't fair! To hell with 'em all!

The minute I was freed I left that place forever and came here to start a new life. Now [[Wing Commander Mulverick|Mulv]] and I are vying for the top orc spot. If you want it, you're gonna have to go through me, scrub.

We go when you're ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|8|80}}
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Netherwing]]

==Progress==
He might look like a human but that Ichman has spent more time with orcs than most orcs!

==Completion==
I don't believe it! Mulverick is your next challenge. There's no way you'll survive that match.

==Notes==
