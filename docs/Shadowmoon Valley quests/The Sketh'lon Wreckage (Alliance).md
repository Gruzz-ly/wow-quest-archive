==Objectives==
Recover the Skethlon Commander's Journal Page 1, Skethlon Commander's Journal Page 2, and Skethlon Commander's Journal Page 3 from the [[Dark Conclave]] [[arakkoa]] at the [[Sketh'lon Wreckage]] to [[Gryphonrider Kieran]].
*[[Sketh'lon Commander's Journal - Page 1]]
*[[Sketh'lon Commander's Journal - Page 2]]
*[[Sketh'lon Commander's Journal - Page 3]]

==Description==
Our scouts have brought back disturbing reports from the ruined arakkoa encampments in the area.

The ghosts of powerful arakkoa magicians wield powers we never thought they possessed. They seem to be organizing, as though preparing for something, but our knowledge is limited. We cannot afford to remain ignorant!

Travel north to the Sketh'lon Wreckage, to the northwest of the [[Deathforge]] and search for signs of their motives.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|g=4|s=10}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|g=7|s=38}} at max level)

==Progress==
What have you discovered?

==Completion==
<Kieran leafs through the journal pages.>

Much of this is unintelligible, but I can make out bits here and there about preparations for a spell gone awry, casualties, and a deteriorating situation. There's also a curious note here about a 'deserter.'

==Progression==
{{Thwart the Dark Conclave}}
