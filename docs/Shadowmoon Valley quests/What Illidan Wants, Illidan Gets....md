==Objectives==
[[Borak, Son of Oronok]] at the bridge near [[Eclipse Point]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to Deliver Illidan's Message to [[Grand Commander Ruusk]] at Eclipse Point.
*[[Illidan]]'s Message Delivered
*[[Blood Elf Disguise]] (provided)

==Description==
Take this disguise and enter Eclipse Point. Once inside, use the disguise to cloak yourself. The Eclipsion [[Blood elf|blood elves]] will be unable to see through the disguise, thereby granting you safe passage to Grand Commander Ruusk.

Once you find Ruusk, tell him where next to move the cipher. You're going to have to act your heart out, <name>. Play it off as if you are his superior, delivering a message from his lord. That should do it!

Oh - watch out for the [[dragonhawk]]s as they see through the disguise.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|5|70}}
*9500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The disguise is delicate. Almost any action, aside from walking, will disrupt the magic holding it together.

==Completion==
Now all you need to do is go get the cipher. Easy, right?

==Notes==
Once you put on the disguise, you may mount up ONCE and then dismount ONCE. Trying to mount up again will break it. Of course, flying will make it much easier to avoid the dragonhawks. Once you finish the conversation, there is a clear spot not far away in front of Ruusk where you should be able to mount up.

Disguised as an [[Illidari]] blood elf, the player has the following conversation with the Grand Commander:

:Who dares interrupt the Grand Commander?

{{gossip|I bring word from Lord [[Illidan]].}}

:I'm listening.

{{gossip|The cipher fragment is to be moved. Have it delivered to [[Zuluhed]].}}

:Oh? Of course you have papers documenting this request.

{{gossip|Perhaps you did not hear me, Ruusk. I am giving you an order from Illidan himself!}}

:Listen to me, peon. We have a process for the delivery and safekeeping of the cipher fragment. The envoy delivers the missive, which is sealed by Lord Illidan. No missive, no transfer.

:<The Illidari Slayer moves in behind you with his axe at the ready.>

{{gossip|Very well. I will return to the [[Black Temple]] and notify Lord Illidan of your unwillingness to carry out his wishes. I suggest you make arrangements with your subordinates and let them know that you will soon be leaving this world.}}

:<Ruusk swallows hard.>

:I... what do you mean?

{{gossip|Do I need to go into all the gory details? I think we are both well aware of what Lord Illidan does with those that would oppose his word. Now, I must be going! Farewell, Ruusk! Forever...}}

:''(As the text window comes up, the Illidari Slayer moves back to his post.)''

:Wait. Where are you going? You needed a transfer, correct? Let's just get it done and over with, ok? Zuluhed at [[Dragonmaw Fortress|Dragonmaw]]? It will be done. Please let Lord Illidan know that his orders were carried out with the full cooperation of the Eclipsion.

:I will dispatch [[Ruul the Darkener]] to personally deliver the fragment!

:You heard me right - Ruul...

{{gossip|Ah, good of you to come around, Ruusk. Thank you and farewell.}}
