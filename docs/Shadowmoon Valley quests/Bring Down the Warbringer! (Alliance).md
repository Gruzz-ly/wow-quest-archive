==Objectives==
Defeat Warbringer Razuun, recover Razuun's Orders, and report to [[Wing Commander Nuainn]] at [[Wildhammer Stronghold]].
*[[Warbringer Razuun]] slain
*[[Razuun's Orders]]
*[[Deathforge Key]] (provided)

==Description==
We've made a lot of progress against the [[Shadow Council]]'s operations at the [[Deathforge]], but if we're to truly be triumphant, we'll need to defeat the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s overseer there.

I found a key among the items in [[Flanis Swiftwing|Flanis]]'s pack. I'm certain it will prove useful in tracking down this Warbringer Razuun you observed at [[Legion Hold]].

After you've hunted down and dealt with Warbringer Razuun, report directly to Wing Commander Nuainn. He'll want to know immediately!

==Progress==
What news do you bring from the Deathforge?

==Completion==
<You make your report to the wing commander and hand over the captured orders.>

Defeating Warbringer Razuun should've meant the end of our troubles with the Legion, but these orders outline a much larger plan that I had anticipated. I fear that more remains to be done.

==Notes==
The upper (right) entrance into the Deathforge is the one you must go through. Continue past the bridge, hug the left wall and use your key on the gate in the room filled with tinkerers and weaponsmiths. Coordinates for entrance are located at 40,38.

==Progression==
