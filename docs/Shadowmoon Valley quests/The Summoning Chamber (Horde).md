==Objectives==
Obtain an Elemental Displacer from a [[Deathforge Smith]] or [[Deathforge Tinkerer]] and use it to disrupt the ritual in the summoning chamber. Report to [[Scout Zagran]] at Slag Watch when you've completed your task.
*End Infernal Summoning Ritual
*[[Elemental Displacer]]

==Description==
In order to churn out infernals as quickly as the [[Deathforge]] seems to, they must have an area dedicated to summoning the [[elemental]]s that form the core of the [[infernals]]

The summoning chamber is likely to be found below ground, near a pool of fouled water or lava. Locate the summoning chamber within the Deathforge and find a way to end their summoning ritual. The [[mo'arg]] involved in making the infernals may carry a tool that will help disrupt the summoner's magics.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at max level)

==Progress==
We cannot afford to let their production continue. Have you put an end to the summoning ritual?

==Completion==
Good, we're making progress. That puts us one step closer to shutting down this facility and returning safely to [[Shadowmoon Village]].
