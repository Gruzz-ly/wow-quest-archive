==Objectives==

*Murg "Oldie" Muckjaw Defeated

==Description==
Don't let the gray hair fool you, grunt. I'm still ten times the rider that you are! And don't go thinking that this old dog doesn't have any tricks up his sleeve.

Now all you gotta do is follow me and try not to get knocked down off your mount. If you can do that, Oldie will admit defeat.

We'll lift off as soon as you're ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|40}}
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Netherwing]]

==Completion==
Pumpkins? Oh how the mighty have fallen... I am certain the other riders will prove to be much more challenging.

==Notes==
Place a raid target icon on him, and fly above him. Do not get too far away otherwise the quest will fail. If it does, simply abandon and retake when he respawns.
