==Objectives==
[[Zorus the Judicator]] at [[Wildhammer Stronghold]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to slay 12 Shadowmoon Harbingers.
*[[Shadowmoon Harbinger]] slain (12)
*[[Spectrecles]] (provided)

==Description==
Let it be known that Zorus does have a sense of humor.

Enough small talk. Don the Spectrecles so that you are able to see the Shadowmoon orc spirits that wander this stronghold. Do not be frightened as we are truly the invaders here. Alas, they must be destroyed, for their time has long since passed.

Destroy the Shadowmoon harbingers infesting Wildhammer Stronghold and return to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at max level)

==Progress==
If you lose your goggles, let me know and I will craft another pair.

==Completion==
You claim to have heard the ghosts whisper to you? And they mentioned [[Teron Gorefiend]]?

<Zorus shudders.>

Yes... I know Teron Gorefiend. Rather, I knew of him. He has long been thought dead. What could these ghosts be speaking of?
