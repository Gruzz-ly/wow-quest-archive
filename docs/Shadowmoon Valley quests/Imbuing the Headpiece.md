==Objectives==
Equip the Unfinished Headpiece, travel to the [[Altar of Damnation]], and use it while standing near [[Gul'dan]]. When the headpiece is energized, return to [[Parshah]] in the [[Magma Fields]].
*[[Energized Headpiece]]
*[[Unfinished Headpiece]] (provided)

==Description==
The staff is nearly finished!

All that remains is to imbue the headpiece with power flowing from the echoes of Gul'dan in this accursed place. To the east, near the [[Fel Pits]] and south of the [[Deathforge]], is the Altar of Damnation.

There, fragments of Gul'dan's past are trapped. When you carry the unfinished headpiece of the staff into the area around the altar, don't be surprised if some of the entities react to it. You will be carrying a dangerous object with strong connections to the cataclysm.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Have you returned with the imbued headpiece?

==Completion==
<Parshah accepts the headpiece, handing it gingerly.>

This holds the power that we'll need to disrupt the [[Dark Conclave|dark conclave]]'s efforts in the [[Sketh'lon Base Camp]].

==Progression==
{{Thwart the Dark Conclave}}
