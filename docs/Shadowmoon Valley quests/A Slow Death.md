'''A Slow Death''' is a once-[[daily quest|daily]] collection quest, available starting at {{reputation|neutral}} reputation with [[Netherwing]] after completing [[Your Friend On The Inside]].

==Objectives==
[[Yarzill the Merc]] at [[Dragonmaw Base Camp]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to use Yarzill's Mutton in conjunction with Fel Glands to poison 12 Dragonmaw Peon Camps.
*[[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]] [[Peon]] Camp Poisoned (12)
*[[Yarzill's Mutton]] (provided)

==Description==
The Dragonmaw have peons stationed at nearly every crystal formation up here. While the outright slaying of them would draw far too much unwanted attention to you, there is a way that we can thin their numbers and remain below the suspicious eyes of [[Mor'ghor]].

Venture into the wilds of Shadowmoon Valley and slay the tainted wildlife. Take from them their corrupt fel glands. Use those fel glands with this mutton that I'll give you near the peons. They'll take one bite and fall deathly ill!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3,450 [[XP]]
*+250 reputation with [[Netherwing]]
*{{cost|7|92|50}}

==Progress==
It is dirty work, <name>.

==Completion==
<Yarzill speaks in a low whisper.>

Excellent work, <name>. Lay low for now. Come back to me tomorrow and we can do it again.

==Notes==
*A total of 12 {{item|Fel Gland|s}} are required to complete this quest. The glands drop from all wildlife in [[Shadowmoon Valley]], excluding the creatures on the [[Netherwing Ledge]].
*This quest can be completed in a group as long as all players are in range of the camp being poisoned when the mutton is dropped.
*The Dragonmaw Peon camps on [[Netherwing Ledge]] can bug out on occasion. Be certain to only use the mutton near camps where at least 2 non-[[Disobedient Dragonmaw Peon|disobedient]] peons are actively mining.
*The quest objective tracks [[Dragonmaw Peon]] ''camps'', not individuals. Thus, killing multiple peons from the same group doesn't grant additional credit.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.1.0|note=Added.}}
