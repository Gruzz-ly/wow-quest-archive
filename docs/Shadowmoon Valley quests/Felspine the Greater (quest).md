==Objectives==
Researcher Tiorus at [[Shadowmoon Village]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to kill [[Felspine the Greater]] and recover Felspine's Hide.
*[[Felspine's Hide]]

==Description==
[[Gnomus]] knows about the massive diemetradon and plans to eat it! He must have been able to see what I could see through the eyes of his [[Arcano-Scorp|arcano-scorp]]. Look, there's no time to explain. He's crazy and that craziness is going to cost us the closest thing we've got to a fireproof jumpsuit.

Get back to the lava flow near [[Ruins of Baa'ri|Baa'ri]] and track down Felspine the Greater. Once you find it, kill it and bring me back its hide.

Don't try and reason with me, <name>. I'm well past that point.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|8|80|}}
*12650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|16|39|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Snap to it! That [[gnome]]'s appetite knows no limit!

==Completion==
At last! Total protection against lava is mine! Of course you get a cut of this technology too, <name>. You've earned it!
