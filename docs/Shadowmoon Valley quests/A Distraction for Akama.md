This is the final quest for attunement to the [[Black Temple]].

==Objectives==
Ensure that [[Akama]] and [[Maiev]] enter the [[Black Temple]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] after [[Xi'ri]]'s forces create a distraction.
* Help Akama and Maiev enter the Black Temple.

==Description==
<Xi'ri pulses with lights as the [[Aldor]] and [[Scryers|Scryer]] forces around him respond to his orders. Xi'ri's army is ready to push [[Illidan]]'s forces back and create a distraction for Akama. The [[naaru]] awaits your request to begin the attack.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 4,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Sha'tar|The Sha'tar]]
*[[Medallion of Karabor]]

==Progress==
<Xi'ri acknowledges your presence.>

==Completion==
<Xi'ri pulses with energy as you feel an object materialize in your hands.  It is the medallion you gave to A'dal on Akama's behalf, its power augmented by the naaru's magic.  The [[Sha'tar]] have entrusted you with the Medallion of Karabor, and with it access to the Black Temple.> 

== Notes ==
:[[File:GossipGossipIcon.png]] ''I am ready to join your forces in battle, Xi'ri.''
:{{text|emote|[[Xi'ri]] falls silent and a quiet tension falls over nearby [[Sha'tar]] forces as Xi'ri makes his decision.}}
:{{text|emote|Xi'ri begins channeling the powers of the light.}}
Xi'ri takes 20 seconds to charge up:
:{{Abilities|Light of the Naaru|Charging the air with the power of the light.|id=39828|icon=spell_holy_purifyingpower}}
and then applies:
:{{Abilities|Light of the Naaru|Dealing Holy damage while attacking.|id=39831|icon=spell_holy_improvedresistanceauras}}
to the Sha'tar forces and the player which lasts for 10 minutes.

The assault begins...
:{{text|yell|[[Fyra Dawnstar]]|Onward, [[Scryers]]!  Show [[Illidan]]'s lackeys the temper of our steel!}}
The [[Seasoned Magister]]s will comment at random as they attack:
* {{text|say|Come closer, demon!  Death awaits!}}
* {{text|say|Illidan's lapdogs!  Destroy them all!}}
* {{text|say|I've a message for your master, scum!}}
:{{text|yell|[[Vagath]]|Pitiful wretches.  You dared invade Illidan's temple?  Very well, I shall make it your death bed!}}

[[Akama]], [[Maiev Shadowsong]] and his [[Ashtongue Deathsworn]] approach the entrance to the Black Temple.
:{{text|yell|Akama|Now is the time, Maiev!  Unleash your wrath!}}
Maiev leads the allies towards the Dreadlords without fear...
:{{text|yell|Maiev Shadowsong|I've waited for this moment for years.  Illidan and his lapdogs will be destroyed!}}
:{{text|yell|Akama|Slay all who see us!  Word must not get back to Illidan.}}
Maiev is ahead of everyone else if you went with her.
:{{text|say|Maiev Shadowsong|Meet your end, demon!}}

The party runs at the Dreadlords and kill them all.  Vagath addresses Akama with his last breath.
:{{text|yell|Vagath|You've sealed you fate, Akama.  The Master will learn from your betrayal!}}
:{{text|say|Akama|Akama has no master, not anymore.}}
:{{text|say|Akama|Our plans are in danger already.  It appears Maiev's decided to do things her own way.}}
:{{text|emote|Akama's attention shifts to a crack along the temple's southern wall.}}
:{{text|say|Akama|We must carry on with or without Maiev.  Inside!  Quickly!}}
Akama ushers his Ashtongue through the crack, then follows them in.

==Progression==
{{The Fall of the Betrayer}}
