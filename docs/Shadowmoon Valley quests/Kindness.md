The start of the [[Ally of the Netherwing quest chain]].  The last quest of this line will grant you {{rep|Neutral}} reputation with the Netherwing Drakes. [[Mordenai]] wanders around [[Netherwing Fields]] and is often fighting flayers. When he is in combat, the {{Queststart}} icon will not be visisble, making it harder to find him. To get the quest sooner, just assist him in defeating his enemies quickly to bring him out of combat.

Completing this quest chain will complicate your ability to farm [[Nether Dragonscales]] (for Draconic leatherworking), and your ability to complete the quest chain that starts with "[[A Not-So-Modest Proposal]]".

==Objectives==
[[Mordenai]] at [[Netherwing Fields]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to feed 8 [[Mature Netherwing Drake]]s.
*Mature Netherwing Drake fed (8)

==Description==
Something has them spooked, <race>.

<Mordenai points to the nether drakes flying overhead.>

They won't even come down to feed. I have seen several fall to the earth, dead from exhaustion before their bodies hit the ground.

We must save them! The Rocknail flayers that are found near the crystals are their natural prey. Kill flayers and take their carcasses. Place a carcass in the field and stand extremely still. As long as you do not make any aggressive motions, they will not attack you.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*12650 [[XP]] ({{cost|7|59}} at max level)

==Progress==
I cannot save them by myself, <name>!

==Completion==
You are a kind and compassionate <race>, friend.

== Notes ==
The Rocknail Flayers drop [[Rocknail Flayer Carcass]]. The Rocknail Rippers drop [[Rocknail Flayer Giblets]]. You can mash 5 giblets into one "carcass" for the purposes of this quest.

Other precautions:
* Do not have Lightning Shield going.
* Classes with pets should make sure that their pets will not attack the dragon while it lands.

Completing this quest line will complicate your ability to complete select
other quests.  See the {{questchain|Ally of the Netherwing}} quest chain.

The [[Rocknail Flayer Carcass]] has a 30 second cooldown, so it is best to use them as soon as possible every time rather than letting them stack up, alternating between killing more flayers and feeding the drakes. Unfortunately, the cooldown is shared with certain other quest items including the [[Totem of Spirits]] used for [[Spirits of Air]], making the quests conflict with each other somewhat despite being completed in the same area.
