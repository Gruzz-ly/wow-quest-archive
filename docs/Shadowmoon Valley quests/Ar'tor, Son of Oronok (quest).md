==Objectives==
Find Ar'tor, Son of Oronok at [[Illidari Point]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]].

==Description==
My youngest son, Ar'tor, left to search Illidari Point - far to the southwest, nestled between [[Legion Hold]] and [[Wildhammer Stronghold]].

While Ar'tor is a hunter of remarkable skill and an expert tracker, I fear that he may be in over his head this time. Illidari Point is the proving grounds for [[Illidan]]'s demons. These are demons that left the [[Burning Legion]] to join the Betrayer!

Travel to Illidari Point and find Ar'tor, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*6,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ar'tor's body lies limp, suspended in mid-air. You have no idea how long he has been dead but your heart aches for Oronok.

Perhaps you should try and get him down and take his corpse back to his father.

==Notes==
*Ar'tor can be found at {{coords|29.5|50.5|Shadowmoon Valley}} in the middle of Illidari Point, dead, suspended in midair within a demonic crystal circle. The succubi periodically perform some sort of ritual involving his corpse.

==Progression==
