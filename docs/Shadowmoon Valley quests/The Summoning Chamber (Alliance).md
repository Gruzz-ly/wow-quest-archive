==Objectives==
Obtain an Elemental Displacer from a [[Deathforge Smith]] or [[Deathforge Tinkerer]] and use it to disrupt the ritual in the summoning chamber. Report to [[Stormer Ewan Wildwing]] at the [[Deathforge Tower]] when you've completed your task.
*End Infernal Summoning Ritual
*[[Elemental Displacer]]

==Description==
In order for the [[Shadow Council]] to construct [[infernal]]s as quickly as they're being used, they must have an area dedicated to summoning the corrupted elementals that serve as the souls of the creatures.

The summoning chamber is likely to be found below ground, near a pool of fouled water or lava. Locate the summoning chamber within the [[Deathforge]] and find a way to end their summoning ritual. The [[mo'arg]] involved in making the infernals may carry a tool that will help disrupt the summoner's magics.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at max level)

==Progress==
We cannot afford to let their production continue. Have you put an end to the summoning ritual?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Disrupting the Shadow Council's summoning puts us one step closer to shutting down the Deathforge.
