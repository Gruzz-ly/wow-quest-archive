==Objectives==
[[Chief Apothecary Hildagard]] at [[Shadowmoon Village]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to bring her 15 Ever-burning Ash samples.
* [[Ever-Burning Ash]] (15)

==Description==
Have you felt the cold chill? Perhaps what you thought was a hand on your shoulder? That was not your mind playing tricks on you, <race>. The land is haunted. [[Ghost]]s litter the landscape, stuck here for all eternity.

Would you like to see them? Are you sure about that? These types of things tend to change a person - and not for the better.

Very well, I will need you to collect for me the ever-burning ash that is found near any of the fel lava pools of western Shadowmoon. Anywhere near green lava...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|4|10}}
* 12300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What do you mean? I'm going to make something out of the ash - obviously.

==Completion==
Your world is about to change, <name>.

<Hildagard begins crafting something out of the ash.>
