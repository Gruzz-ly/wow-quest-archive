'''Dragonmaw Race: Captain Skyshatter''' is the sixth of six race quests, available at {{reputation|honored}} reputation with [[Netherwing]]. Winning the challenge itself will award the [[achievement]] [[Skyshattered]].

==Objectives==
Follow [[Captain Skyshatter]] while attempting to stay on your [[flying mount]]. Should you defeat Captain Skyshatter, report your victory to [[Ja'y Nosliw]] at the [[Dragonmaw Base Camp]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]].
*Captain Skyshatter Defeated
*Return to Ja'y Nosliw at [[Netherwing Ledge]] in Shadowmoon Valley.

==Description==
You dare challenge Skyshatter? The world around you will fall into darkness as the heavens are torn asunder by my meteors.

You stand no chance, soldier. Yet it is your desire to die...

I will entertain this morbid obsession if only to prove a point to any that might foolishly dream of making the same mistake.

We ride when you are ready!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|60}}
*+1000 [[reputation]] with [[Netherwing]]
*[[Skybreaker Whip]]

==Progress==
Second place isn't that bad, <name>. You can take [[Wing Commander Mulverick|Mulverick's]] spot on the line-up...

==Completion==
I never dreamed any would be skilled enough to defeat Skyshatter. You do know what this means, right? You are now the top orc! You must defend your title.

==Notes==
6/6. He's tough. Compared to the other 5, you need to remain very close to him, otherwise you will fail the quest. Dodging the metors is difficult.

# Buy a bunch of Noggenfogger Elixirs and use them until you turn small for ten minutes.  When you are smaller it makes dodging much easier.
# To keep within range of Skyshatter, because he flies faster than you, a very good idea is to fly ahead of him, to the side of him, above him or perhaps all three. The way to do that is to learn his route by heart and then beat him into the turns. It takes a few tries to get it down, but its worth it.
# Keep an eye on Skyshatter. At various points throughout his route he will pause briefly (actually two 180° turns back to back). He can also be hit by his own meteors, which will stop him for a bit. If you're in front of him, be ready to stop or double back closer to him so you don't end up too far ahead.
# Flight trinkets can be helpful and can be used to get the extra edge; [[Carrot on a Stick]], [[Riding Crop]] or the Paladin's [[Crusader Aura]] (note that none of these effects stack with each other).
# Druids with [[Swift Flight Form]] also have an additional edge. Map your [[Swift Flight Form]] to a key, and if you get hit, quickly shift back into form.

''Note: Whilst this quest is useful for the reputation gain, it is not required to get the Netherwing mount.''
