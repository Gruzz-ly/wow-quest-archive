==Objectives==
[[File:Painmistress Gabrissa.jpg|thumb|Painmistress Gabrissa]]
Seek out and slay [[Painmistress Gabrissa]] at [[Illidari Point]] and return to the corpse of [[Ar'tor, Son of Oronok]] with the Crystalline Key.
*[[Crystalline Key]]

==Description==
From assessing the scene, you note that Ar'tor is being held in place by energy beams emanating from the crystals hovering around the rune. Try as you might, Ar'tor is unmovable.

You note that the crystals have an empty slot at their base - perhaps for a key. It also seems as if [[Sayaad|succubi]] periodically perform some sort of ritual at the site.

Search Illidari Point for their leader. Perhaps she holds the key to releasing Ar'tor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|5|70|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Ar'tor hovers lifelessly before you.

==Completion==
You slide the crystalline key into the slots at the base of each of the [[demon]]ic crystals.

==Notes==
Painmistress Gabrissa is located just up the steps to the west of Ar'tor's body {{coords|28|47|Shadowmoon Valley}}.

==Progression==
{{Hand of Gul'dan}}
