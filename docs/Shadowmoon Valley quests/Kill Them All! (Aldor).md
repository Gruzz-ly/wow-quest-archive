'''Kill Them All!''' is an introduction quest directing [[Aldor]]-affiliated players to the [[Altar of Sha'tar]]. The [[Scryers]] version of this quest can be found at [[Kill Them All! (Scryers)]]. This quest is available at {{reputation|revered}} reputation with [[Netherwing]] after completing [[Hail, Commander!]]

==Objectives==
Deliver news of your mission along with the Dragonmaw Flare Gun to [[Anchorite Ceyla]] at the [[Altar of Sha'tar]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]].
*[[Dragonmaw Flare Gun]] (provided)

==Description==
Commander <name>, stand at attention! You are to take a battalion of Skybreakers and sack the Aldor outpost located northwest of our beloved Black Temple. With the Altar of Sha'tar destroyed, our lines of communication to our posts at Coilskar will once more be open.

Go now! Use this flare gun to signal the Skybreakers for the attack!

==Progress==
Settle down, child.

==Completion==
It is good that you came to us. Perhaps we can use this attack to our advantage and turn the tables on the Dragonmaw.

==Trivia==
The name of this quest is probably a reference to [[Wikipedia: Metallica|Metallica's]] first album [[Wikipedia: Kill 'Em All|Kill 'Em All]].
