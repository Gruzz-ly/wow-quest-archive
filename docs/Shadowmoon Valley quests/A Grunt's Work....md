==Objectives==
[[Overlord Or'barokh]] at [[Shadowmoon Village]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to kill 20 Shadowmoon Valley Wildlife.

These creatures include [[Felboar (mob)|Felboars]], [[Vilewing Chimaera]], and [[Scorchshell Pincer]]. Any combination will be sufficient.
*Shadowmoon Valley Wildlife slain (20)

==Description==
All [[Horde]] forces in this region have been dispatched to handle the attacks from the [[Burning Legion]]. This means that we are short-handed for grunt work.

Our supply caravans are in constant danger from the wildlife of the region. We can't veer 15 feet off the road without running into a [[chimaera]], [[felboar]], or abnormally large [[scorpion]].

Get out there and clear [[Shadowmoon Valley]] of its sadistic wildlife! Just kill 'em all!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3,450 [[XP]]
*{{cost|23|77|50}}

==Progress==
Return to me when the wilds are safe for our caravans to traverse.

==Completion==
Fantastic! Should I have any other grunt work that needs to be done, I'll find you.

==Notes==
*Despite not being listed in the objective text, [[Shadow Serpent (snake)|Shadow Serpents]] also count toward this quest.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
