*[[The Doctor's Key]]

==Description==
The best way to destroy the rest of the Legion's supplies is to use their own weapons against them. I've been working on a rig that will let you take control of one of those Fel Reaver Sentinels below.

There are a couple things I need to work out, yet. For that, I'll need the manual that Doctor Gutrick keeps locked in a chest at the bottom of the ramp. He probably won't give up the key without a fight, so you'll need to capture it. Bring the fel reaver manual back to me and I'll do the rest!

==Progression==
Did you get that manual?

==Completion==
Ah, this is exactly what we'll need. I'd never accuse the Legion of producing anything resembling literature, but it gets the job done.

==Notes==
This quest seems to be a tribute to "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values," a 1974 novel by Robert M. Pirsig.

==Progression==
