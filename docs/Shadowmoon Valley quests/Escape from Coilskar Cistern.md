Escort [[Earthmender Wilda]] out of [[Coilskar Cistern]] and then seek out [[Earthmender Torlok]] at the [[Altar of Damnation]], found at the western outskirts of the [[Hand of Gul'dan (subzone)|Hand of Gul'dan]].
*Earthmender Wilda Escorted to Safety

==Description==
Thank the [[Earthmother]]! I parted ways with the others several days ago. I was intent on discovering the source of the disturbance that the spirits of water were feeling. My search led me to Coilskar where I discovered that the [[naga]] were befouling the water supply of [[Shadowmoon Valley]].

Unfortunately, I was discovered and taken prisoner. There's no telling what ghastly things they had in store for me.

We must leave this place! Help me escape and then seek out Torlok at the Altar of Damnation.
