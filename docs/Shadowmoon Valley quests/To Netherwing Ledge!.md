'''To Netherwing Ledge!''' is a collection quest, having players recover 12 {{loot|common|Nethervine Crystal|Nethervine Crystals}} from [[Netherwing Ledge]]. The Crystals are world spawns, typically guarded by [[Dragonmaw Peon]] camps.

This is part of the {{questchain|Ally of the Netherwing}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
[[Neltharaku]], flying high above [[Netherwing Fields]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]], wants you to collect 12 Nethervine Crystals from [[Netherwing Ledge]].
*[[Nethervine Crystal]] (12)

==Description==
I believe that I can imbue nethervine crystals with my own essence. The power contained within these imbued crystals should be sufficient to free enslaved drakes of their masters' grasps.

Travel to Netherwing Ledge, an island located off the broken shelf of Shadowmoon Valley, to the southeast. It is on Netherwing Ledge that you will find nethervine crystals. Return to me when you have collected enough crystals to fill your packs.

And <name>, Beware the Dragonmaw that now inhabit the island.

==Progress==
I require nethervine crystals.

==Completion==
<Neltharaku takes the crystals from you.>

I will prepare the crystals for you now.

==Notes==
[[Nethervine Crystal]]s are world-spawns like herbs or minerals on the [[Netherwing Ledge]]. Crystals are often guarded by camps of [[Dragonmaw Clan|Dragonmaw]] Peons.

These crystals can be found using the [[Find Minerals]] skill until you have the number of nethervine crystals that are needed to complete the quest.

If you have a friend who is doing the [[A Slow Death]] daily quest, this becomes quite easy.  Find a mining camp with nethervine crystals, poison the peons, collect the crystal.
