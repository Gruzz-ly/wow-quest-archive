==Objectives==
[[Grom'tor, Son of Oronok]] at [[Coilskar Point]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to recover the First Fragment of the Cipher of Damnation.
*[[First Fragment of the Cipher of Damnation]]

==Description==
This [[naga]] filth is the sixth one I've interrogated today. He's got the fancy armor so I figured he knew something. Those other ones were useless.

<Grom'tor points to the corpses of the naga around him.>

I only had to beat him once and he told me everything.

The first part of the cipher is hidden in a [[Coilskar Chest|naga chest]] at Coilskar Point or [[Coilskar Cistern]], east of here. He says naga carry the keys. Kill 'em, take their [[Coilskar Chest Key|keys]] and use them to open the Coilskar chests. Return to me when you find the cipher.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*15800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Any luck?

==Completion==
This must be taken back to father at once.

==Notes==
*The other five naga mentioned can be found south of Grom'Tor; two [[Coilskar Siren]], two [[Coilskar Defender]]s and a [[Coilskar Screamer]].

==Progression==
{{Hand of Gul'dan}}
