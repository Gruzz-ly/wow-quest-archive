'''The Great Netherwing Egg Hunt''' is a collection quest, having players collect a single [[Netherwing Egg]]. This quest is available at a {{reputation|neutral}} reputation with [[Netherwing]] after completing [[Your Friend On The Inside]]. Completing this quest opens up the repeatable quest [[Accepting All Eggs]].

==Objectives==
[[Yarzill the Merc]] at [[Dragonmaw Base Camp]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to recover a Netherwing Egg.
*[[Netherwing Egg]]

==Description==
Should you discover any Netherwing eggs while exploring, bring them to me.

Be warned, a Netherwing egg is a rare discovery. Do not become frustrated if you cannot locate one. These Dragonmaw have been very thorough in collecting most of them and shipping them off to parts unknown.

Eggs might be found on creatures of the island, near crystal formations, in the mines, or even inside a nethercite node or netherdust bush.

Keep a low profile. We don't need Mor'ghor catching wind of your actions.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|80}}

==Progress==
How goes the egg hunt?

==Completion==
Neltharaku will be most pleased, <name>. Well done.

==Notes==
[[Netherwing Egg]]s are uncommon world spawns on the [[Netherwing Ledge]] and the [[Dragonmaw Fortress]]. They can also be found as drops from creatures, from herb gathering, and ore spawns in the same area.
