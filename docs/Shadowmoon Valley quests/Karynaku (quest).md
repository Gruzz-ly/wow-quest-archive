This quest is part of the {{questchain|Ally of the Netherwing}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Seek out [[Karynaku]] at [[Dragonmaw Fortress]].
*Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
It shames me to ask for your assistance once more, <name>, but you are my flight's only hope. Without my mate, the [[netherwing]] brood may die out completely.

Make your way to the top of Dragonmaw Fortress and find Karynaku.

We will be flying overhead. Should a break appear in their defenses, the might of the netherwing will swoop down to assist you.

==Completion==
It is the chains. They sap my power. The only way is to get the key from Zuluhed and unbind me.

==Notes==
*Though this quest is marked as a 5-man group quest, it is quite soloable. Just fly to the platform where Karynaku lies and finish the quest.
*Upon starting the next quest however, the level 72 elite boss will spawn, thus this is marked as being a 5-man quest.

==Progression==
{{Ally of the Netherwing}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
