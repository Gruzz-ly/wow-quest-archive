'''Additional Materials''' is a collection quest, having players collect several trade goods and a quest item from [[Fantei]] in the [[Lower City]] in [[Shattrath City]].

==Objectives==
[[David Wayne]] at [[Wayne's Refuge]] wants you to bring him an Adamantite Frame, 4 Heavy Knothide Leather, and a Demon Warding Totem.
*[[Adamantite Frame]]
*[[Heavy Knothide Leather]] (4)
*[[Demon Warding Totem]]

==Description==
The ingots that you brought contain most of the metal I'll need to forge the sword's blade, but I'll need a variety of things to create other parts of the weapon.

Let's see, among the things I don't have here are an adamantite frame, some heavy knothide leather, and a demon warding totem. Skilled crafters should be able to produce the first two, but the third is only sold by the reagent vendor in Shattrath's Lower City, Fantei. You'll find him with the other tradesmen.

==Progress==
Did you get those materials?

==Completion==
<The smith accepts the materials, nodding approvingly.>

These will suffice. The remainder of the materials I'll need won't be quite so easy to come by.

==Progression==
{{Illidari-Bane Shard}}
