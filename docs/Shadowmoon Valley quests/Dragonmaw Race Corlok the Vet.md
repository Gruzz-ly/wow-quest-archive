==Description==
You are challenging ME? Don't make me laugh!

You're serious? Very well then! All you need to do is not die. You can manage to not die, right?? Even if I'm hurling skulls at you and flying circles around your pathetic riding skills?

Just let me know when you're ready and we'll lift off.

You will receive:
*{{cost|8|80}}
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Netherwing]]

==Progress==
Corlok must be taken seriously if you are to win this match.

==Completion==
The next two riders were the two top pilots that the dwarves and orcs of Azeroth had to offer. You stand no chance!
