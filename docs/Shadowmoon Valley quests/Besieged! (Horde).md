==Objectives==
Blood Guard Gulmok outside of Shadowmoon Village, wants you to kill 10 Infernal Attackers.
*[[Infernal Attacker]] slain (10)

==Description==
<Gulmok looks to the sky.>

Our scouts are putting up a good fight, but the infernals keep coming!

From their base of [[Legion Hold]] to the southwest, the [[demon]]s bombard us with impunity! Even the elite Kor'kron guard cannot hold them off forever.

I'm drafting every able-bodied <race> to do their part in defense of Shadowmoon Village. This is no game, <class>. The survival of the village is at stake. Do your duty to the Horde, and join the fray!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Have you tired already, <class>? 

==Completion==
I'm impressed that you managed to survive the carnage. You just might be the person we need for a dangerous mission.

==Progression==
{{Besieged!}}
