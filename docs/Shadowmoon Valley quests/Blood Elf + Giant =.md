==Objectives==
Slay [[Chancellor Bloodleaf]] and [[Corok the Mighty]] and recover Illidan's Command. Use the [[Wildhammer Flare Gun]] to signal another [[Wildhammer Gryphon Rider]] once you have accomplished this task.
Speak with [[Thane Yoregar]] at [[Wildhammer Stronghold]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] should you lose your Wildhammer Flare Gun and require a replacement.
*[[Corok the Mighty]] slain
*[[Chancellor Bloodleaf]] slain
*[[Illidan's Command]]

==Description==
At the southern end of the Path of Conquest, near a stationary caravan, I discovered what looked like a meeting between a giant and a blood elf chancellor. What are giants even doing here? Something is just not right about all of this, grunt.

I want you to fight your way to this meeting and break up the party. Recover whatever you can from the scene and then call for one of us with the flare gun.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*15800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|9|48|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
What have you to report, soldier?

==Completion==
So they are attempting to gain the favor of the giants, eh? I have a plan that could serve to sever this unholy union.

==Progression==
