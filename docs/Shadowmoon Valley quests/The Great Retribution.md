==Objectives==
[[Varen the Reclaimer]] wants you to slay 8 Shadowmoon Slayers, 8 Shadowmoon Chosen and 4 Shadowmoon Darkweavers.

Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.
*[[Shadowmoon Slayer]] slain (8)
*[[Shadowmoon Chosen]] slain (8)
*[[Shadowmoon Darkweaver]] slain (4)

==Description==
You did well against the [[Ashtongue]] [[Broken]], <name>. I have another challenge for you, should you be up to it.

Not too long ago, the Sanctum of the Stars suffered a tremendous attack by [[Illidan]]'s [[fel orc]]s.

We've determined it was perpetrated by the Shadowmoon orcs who occupy the [[Ata'mal Terrace]].

Show them that the Scryers are not to be trifled with.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Aged Leather Bindings|Ash-Covered Helm|Ata'mal Crown|Blackened Chain Greaves}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|40|}}
*12,650 [[XP]]
*-275 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*+250 reputation with [[The Scryers]]

==Progress==
Hail, <name>. What news do you bring?

==Completion==
You've gained my utmost respect today, <name>.

Slaying one fel orc is not an easy task. &nbsp;Massacring a score of them is, well... heroic.
