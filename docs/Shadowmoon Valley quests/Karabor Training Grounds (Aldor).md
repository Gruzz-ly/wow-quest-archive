'''Karabor Training Grounds''' sends the players to the [[Ruins of Karabor]] to investigate the increasing numbers of Sunfury blood elves.

==Objectives==
Exarch Onaala at the Altar of Sha'tar wants you to obtain 8 Sunfury Glaives from Demon Hunter Supplicants and Demon Hunter Initiates at the Ruins of Karabor, southeast of the Altar of Sha'tar.

Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.
*8x [[Sunfury Glaive]]

==Description==
Our scouts have reported a massive influx of Sunfury blood elf recruits heading to the Ruins of Karabor. Normally this would represent a purely military threat, however we believe something else is amiss.

Descriptions of their attire and fighting style are suspiciously close to that of Illidan himself. I do not want to become alarmed without good reason, so I would like you to go there and bring me back their weapons. We will then determine whether my fears are unfounded or not. 

==Progress==
Have you completed the task I asked of you, <name>? 

==Completion==
Let's take a closer look at these weapons, <name>.  Hmmm... this is rather unsettling. .

== Notes ==
The Supplicants and Initiates are all on the southern side of the Black Temple complex. Upon entering the stairs to the right when given the choice, you may notice that all the blood elves can see through stealth, thus, classes that will use stealth for combat should take the left stairs. If you don't have a flying mount, you go go in the main entrance and take the first path to the south up a long stairway. Be careful not to miss the turn and go too far into the Black Temple or you will run into [[Doomwalker]], a [[fel reaver]] [[World raid encounters|world boss]].
