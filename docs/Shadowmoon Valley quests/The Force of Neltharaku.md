This quest is part of the {{questchain|Ally of the Netherwing}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
[[Neltharaku]], flying high above [[Netherwing Fields]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]], wants you to free 5 Enslaved Netherwing Drakes.{{coords|68.9|61.4|Shadowmoon Valley}}
*[[Enslaved Netherwing Drake]] freed (5)
*[[Enchanted Nethervine Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
Take this enchanted nethervine crystal and make your way back to [[Dragonmaw Fortress]]. Once there, seek out the enslaved drakes and invoke the magic of the nethervine crystal. My own energies will pour forth, causing the drakes to break free from the bond of their captors. When you see that the drake has broken free, help it defeat its captor! It will most assuredly be weak from the imprisonment.

Release all that you can find and return to me, <name>.

==Progress==
Waste no time, we have much work to do!

==Completion==
<Neltharaku laughs.>

The [[orc]]s must have been shocked to see the drakes turn on them in such a manner. Well done, <name>. Perhaps you truly are the hero of our flight.

==Notes==
Do not engage the orc handler before the drake that you targeted becomes friendly. Aggroing them early will cancel the effect and causing the drake to attack you as well.
