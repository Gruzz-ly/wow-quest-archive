==Objectives==
Obtain Lianthe's Key from any of the [[blood elf|blood elves]] at [[Eclipse Point]] and use it to open [[Lianthe's Strongbox]] and claim the Rod of Lianthe. Return the rod to [[Parshah]] in the [[Magma Fields]].
*[[Lianthe's Key]]
*[[Rod of Lianthe]]

==Description==
The totem alone is not strong enough to counteract the sinister magics of the dark conclave.

We can combine it with other objects of power, forming a staff to focus the energies. We cannot rescue my brethren from the depths of their depravity, but we can stop them.

One of the items I need for the staff is the Rod of Lianthe, held by the blood elves at Eclipse Point to the southeast. It is kept in a pavilion on the top tier of the ruins and will be heavily guarded. Use caution, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Did you manage to get the rod?

==Completion==
Well done. Such a treasure deserves better than to be shut away in a dark chest. We shall see it used for a worthy purpose.

==Progression==
{{Thwart the Dark Conclave}}
