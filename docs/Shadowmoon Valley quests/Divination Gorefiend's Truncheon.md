==Objectives==
The [[Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit]] at the [[Altar of Shadows]] in southeast [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to recover Gorefiend's Truncheon.
*[[Gorefiend's Truncheon]]

==Description==
One by one they knelt before him, offering their lives as a show of allegiance. [[Teron Gorefiend|Gorefiend]] hoisted his sickle and cut clean their heads. Shortly after this slaughter, Gorefiend took his own life.

But this was no act of contrition! No, Gorefiend sought immortality! From the corpses of the fallen death knights rose the [[Ghostriders of Karabor]].

They now ride the roads encircling the [[Hand of Gul'dan (subzone)|Hand of Gul'dan]], awaiting the day that their master returns. It is they who hold the truncheon of Gorefiend. Retrieve it...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|59|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
You must use the Spectrecles if you wish to see the spirits of Shadowmoon.

==Completion==
Only with all three united may I divine the secrets you so desperately seek!
