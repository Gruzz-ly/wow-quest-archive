This quest is part of a chain that starts with [[Kroghan's Report]].

==Objectives==
Return to [[Shadowmoon Village]] and speak with Overlord Or'barokh.

==Description==
You must bring word of our success to Overlord Or'barokh immediately! Now that we've crushed the [[Legion]] and obliterated their presence in Shadowmoon Valley, the overlord can turn his attention to our other foes.

Although the [[Kor'kron]] guard will never admit it, they'll be glad we're no longer fighting on two fronts.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Band of Anguish|Gloves of the High Magus}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|40|}}
*15800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|9|48}} at level 70)

==Completion==
<The overlord listens to your report.>

Excellent news! Holding the line against the Legion's [[infernals]] was taking too many resources. Not that I expected my men to break, but they were greatly strained.

You have proven your worth to the [[Horde]] this day. The Kor'kron guard would be honored to fight by your side anytime.

==Progression==
{{Besieged!}}
