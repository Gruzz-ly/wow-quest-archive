'''Blood Oath of the Netherwing''' is the continuation of the [[Netherwing]] quest line to obtain the [[nether drake]] [[flying mount]]. Players must be {{reputation|neutral}} with [[Netherwing]] (by completing the [[Ally of the Netherwing quest chain]]) to accept this quest. Upon completing this quest, players will now transform into a [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw fel orc]] and their mount will change to a [[Dragonmaw Nether Drake (mount)]] in the [[Dragonmaw Fortress]] and the [[Netherwing Ledge]].

==Completion==
Our lands are lost. Our children stolen in the night, forced into slavery - or worse...

<Mordenai's voice tenses.>

The time is now, my ally. The time to retake what was once ours has come! You have proven yourself a capable combatant and compassionate soul.

Will you swear to assist the Netherwing Dragonflight in retaking our lands and rebuilding our homes? Will you swear to watch over the flight and allow the bloodline to be born anew? Swear this and let us battle for our home and our loved ones!
