==Objectives==
[[Borak, Son of Oronok]] at the bridge near [[Eclipse Point]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to recover the Third Part of the Cipher of Damnation from [[Ruul the Darkener]].

This mission will require a group.
*[[Third Fragment of the Cipher of Damnation]]
*Suggested Players [4]

==Description==
That Cipher fragment will never reach [[Zuluhed the Whacked|Zuluhed]]. You're going to ambush Ruul the Darkener and his transport before it has a chance to make the delivery.

The [[Dragonmaw Fortress]] is directly east of here, across the [[Netherwing Fields]]. Somewhere between Dragonmaw Fortress and the [[Sanctum of the Stars]] is where you'll find Ruul. Strike hard and strike fast! And <name>, from the sound of it, this Ruul is going to be tough. Keep your guard up.

Return the Cipher to me should you succeed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|7|59}}
*12650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You must act quickly!

==Completion==
Finally! The cipher fragment is ours!

<Borak places the fragment into a box.>
