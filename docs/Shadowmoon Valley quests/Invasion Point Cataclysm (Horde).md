This quest is part of a chain that starts with [[Bring Down the Warbringer!]].

==Objectives==
Report to Nakansi at [[Invasion Point: Cataclysm]].

==Description==
Now that we have access to the Legion's base at Invasion Point: Cataclysm, we need to figure out a way to shut down their operations there. [[Shadowmoon Village]] won't be safe until the Legion's presence is erased from the valley.

I've sent an advance party up to the invasion point to help you formulate a plan to destroy the Legion's supplies. Go back to [[Legion Hold]] and step into the teleporter with the green crystals above it. Nakansi will meet you at your destination.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1250 [[XP]] (or {{cost||75}} at level 70)

==Completion==
You must be the <race> Blood Guard Gulmok told me to expect. I have a plan in mind, but I'll need your help to complete the preparations.

==Progression==
{{Besieged!}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
