'''The Great Murkblood Revolt''' begins by looting the [[Murkblood Escape Plans]] from a [[Sludge-Covered Object]] off of a Black Blood of Draenor or Draenor Blood Terror in the [[Netherwing Mines]] after achieving {{reputation|friendly}} [[reputation]] with [[Netherwing]] and completing [[The Netherwing Mines]].

==Objectives==
Take the Murkblood Escape Plans to the [[Mistress of the Mines]].
*[[Murkblood Escape Plans]] (provided)

==Description==
This document outlines a revolt planned by the Murkblood broken. It seems that the dragon was to be used as a diversion to draw attention away from their escape. Looking at all of the corpses littering the mine, it would be safe to assume that their plans failed.

Return the escape plans to the Mistress of the Mines.

==Progress==
What's this? 

==Completion==
Excellent work, overseer. Mor'ghor will hear of your outstanding service to the Dragonmaw.

Now back to these Murkblood dogs. They plan an escape, eh? Dare they defy the one true lord of Outland? Their masters will pay for this!

==Notes==
To start this quest, kill Black Blood of Draenors or Draenor Blood Terrors after achieving {{reputation|friendly}} [[reputation]] with [[Netherwing]] and completing [[The Netherwing Mines]]. The drop rate is fairly high to start the quest.
