'''The Warden's Cage''' sends the player off to find and talk to [[Sanoru]].

==Objectives==
Arcanist Thelis wants you to enter the Warden's Cage, south of the Ruins of Baa'ri and interrogate [[Sanoru]] on Akama's whereabouts.

Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation to decrease.

==Description==
The fragments you obtained are only half of the medallion. The Ashtongue leader, Akama, must have kept the other half.

I dread to ask this of you, as Akama is both evil and cunning.

He and the Ashtongue Deathsworn - the vilest and most brutal of the tribe - are rumored to run a torture chamber inside the Warden's Cage.

I want you to find that dreaded prison, and find the whereabouts of Akama. His second in command at the location is a Broken known as Sanoru - interrogate him if you have to.

==Completion==
We've been expecting you, <name>.  Akama said you would arrive sooner or later.

==Notes==
[[File:StairwayToSanoru-WardensCage.jpg|thumb|The Warden's Cage from above with a red arrow marking the stairwell to Sanoru.]]
*Sanoru is in an underground chamber below the Warden's Cage.  There is a small stairwell leading down into the chamber at coordinates 57,49. If you have a flying mount, you can just fly up to the top and defeat one demon to get to the stairwell.
