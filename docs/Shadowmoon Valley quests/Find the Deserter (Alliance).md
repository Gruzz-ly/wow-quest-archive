==Objectives==
Locate [[Parshah]] in the Magma Fields and speak to him.

==Description==
I get the feeling that all the pieces are here, but I just can't put them together in a way that makes sense.

I think our best lead is to attempt to locate this deserter. If he left his comrades at the camp, there's a chance you might be able to persuade him to help us understand what the dark conclave arakkoa are planning.

Start your search for him along the road in Magma Fields to the northwest. It seems a likely place for him to take refuge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1250 [[XP]] (or {{cost||75|}} at max level)

==Completion==
<The arakkoa cackles.>

Yes, I am the deserter mentioned in the commander's journal. I have been waiting for the day when others might recognize the threat posed by those I once called brothers.

==Progression==
