'''Reclaiming Holy Grounds''' is the last part of a two-part quest that takes place in [[Shadowmoon Valley]]. It is an [[Aldor]] Quest, and will cause your [[Scryers]] Reputation to decrease.

[[Vindicator Aluumen]] wants you to slay 8 Shadowmoon Slayers, 8 Shadowmoon Chosen and 4 Shadowmoon Darkweaver.

Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.
*[[Shadowmoon Slayer]] slain (8)
*[[Shadowmoon Chosen]] slain (8)
*[[Shadowmoon Darkweaver]] slain (4)

==Description==
You did well against the Broken in Baa'ri, <name>. Let's see how well you do against Illidan's most feared army.

The fel orcs of the Shadowmoon Clan occupy the Ata'mal Terrace, once a very holy site where ata'mal crystals were used in spiritual ceremonies.

We had reason to believe they were hiding an actual ata'mal crystal in the vicinity, but our scrying has revealed nothing. Nevertheless, the fel orcs are on draenei holy ground and their presence must be dealt with.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Hail, <name>. What news do you bring?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <class>.  May the Light continue to protect you.

==Notes==
The quest's zone is found on the north west side of the Black Temple. It is accessible by path just north of where the Lightsworn Vindicators stand. Pulls begin with three Shadowmoon Slayers who protect the entrance.
