'''The Ashtongue Corruptors''' sends the player off to defeat four Corruptors, [[Broken]] [[shaman]] who now corrupt the elements they were entrusted to protect.

==Objectives==
Obtain the four medallion fragments from [[Haalum]], [[Eykenen]], [[Lakaan]] and [[Uylaru]] and return to Anchorite Ceyla at the Altar of Sha'tar in Shadowmoon Valley.

Performing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.  
*1 x [[Eykenen's Medallion Fragment]]
*1 x [[Haalum's Medallion Fragment]]
*1 x [[Lakaan's Medallion Fragment]]
*1 x [[Uylaru's Medallion Fragment]]

==Description==
According to Akama's letter, four fragments of the medallion were unearthed and given to the Ashtongue Corruptors. These dreaded Broken were once powerful shaman who now defile the very elements they revered.

Haalum, Corruptor of Air, can be found at Netherwing Pass. Eykenen and Uylaru, Corruptors of Earth and Fire, were last seen at the Fel Pits near the Hand of Gul'dan. Lakaan, Corruptor of Water, is rumored to be near Coilskar Point.

Find them and obtain the medallion fragments.

==Progress==
Have you obtained the four medallion fragments, <name>?

==Completion==
Yes!  The four fragments of the medallion.  Now to put them together...

==Notes==
Each Corruptor is channeling 3 totems surrounding him that must be destroyed before he can be attacked.  The Totems have about 500 health each. When each totem is destroyed, two or three small elementals will spawn, each of which also has about 500 health, and is of the element that corresponds with its Corrupter. When the final totem is destroyed, you will have to deal with both the Corrupter and the spawned elementals.

Sometimes it appears that the Corrupter will attack before all or any totems are destroyed. What this means is that someone came along, destroyed one or more totems, but did not kill the Corrupter. The totems eventually respawn but this "instance" of the Corruptor is no longer channeling those totems.

*Haalum can be found in [[Netherwing Pass]] at corrdinates 57,73.
*Eykenen can be found in the [[Fel Pits]] at corrdinates 51,53.
*Uylaru can be found in the [[Fel Pits]] at corrdinates 48,39.
*Lakaan can be found near [[Coilskar Point]] at corrdinates 49,23.
