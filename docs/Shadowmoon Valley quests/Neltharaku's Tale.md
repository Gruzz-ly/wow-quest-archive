{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|I am listening, dragon.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
In the eastern reaches of the [[Netherwing Fields]] lies [[Dragonmaw Fortress]]. It is there that the cruel [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw orc clan]] tortures the [[drake]]s that they capture in an attempt to bend them to their will. Many have given up hope, choosing instead to do the bidding of Dragonmaw. The others... They refuse to land for fear of Dragonmaw war parties capturing them and taking them back to the fortress.

{{Gossip|But you are dragons! How could orcs do this to you?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I... We are powerless. [[Illidan]] found and delivered unto the Dragonmaw their leader - [[Zuluhed]]. This orc was the one responsible for the capture and incarceration of [[Alexstrasza]]. How could we fight against such power? He captured an [[Dragon Aspects|Aspect]]!

And just as easily, he took my mate.

{{Gossip|Your mate?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
<Neltharaku nods.>

[[Karynaku]]... She is held prisoner atop Dragonmaw Fortress. I have made many attempts to free her. All have failed... You have battled these beasts before, have you not?

{{Gossip|I have battled many beasts, dragon. I will help you.}}
