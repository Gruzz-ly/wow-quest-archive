==Objectives==
Obtain a Fel Reaver Power Core and a Fel Reaver Armor Plate and bring them to [[Wing Commander Nuainn]] at [[Wildhammer Stronghold]].
*[[Fel Reaver Power Core]]
*[[Fel Reaver Armor Plate]]

==Description==
We cannot permit the Legion to carry out its plan to destroy [[Wildhammer Stronghold]] on their march to the [[Black Temple]].

There's only one way to stop them, <name>. You must create an explosive large enough to destroy the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s entire stockpile of [[infernal]]s at the hold.

[[The Fetid Pool]] near [[Legion Hold]] holds an old [[fel reaver]] power core you could use as the base of your device. Search the other wreckage near the fel reaver for armor plating we might be able to make a casing from.

==Progress==
<You hand the materials to the wing commander.>

==Completion==
<The wing commander inserts the power core into the armor plates and seals the device shut, nodding.>

This should do the trick. Should make quite an explosion too, if I do say so m'self.

==Trivia==
The name of this quest could be a reference to the phrase "Someone set us up the bomb", which is part of the opening scene to the 1980s video game ''Zero Wing''. The game became infamous for the ''"All your base are belong to us"'' phenomenon.

==Progression==
