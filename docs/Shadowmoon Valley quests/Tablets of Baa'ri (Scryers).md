'''Tablets of Baa'ri''' is the start of a long quest chain which involves the [[Broken]] clan known as the [[Ashtongue Deathsworn]]. 

==Objectives==
Arcanist Thelis at the Sanctum of the Stars wants you to collect 12 Baa'ri Tablets from the ground and from Ashtongue Workers at the Ruins of Baa'ri.

Completing quests with the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.
*[[Baa'ri Tablet Fragment]] (12)

==Description==
The Ashtongue Broken have been ordered by Illidan to excavate the Ruins of Baa'ri, to the far north. They're in search of draenei artifacts, no doubt - Baa'ri was home to many Baa'ri relics before Gul'dan buried the town under a volcanic explosion. We must use this opportunity to recover the Tablets of Baa'ri, an ancient text rumored to hold the secrets of the Temple of Karabor... a place you might know as the Black Temple.

==Progress==
Have you found the tablets yet, <name>?

==Completion==
The Baa'ri tablets!  Yes, this might provide us with very useful information.

==Notes==
*The Ruins of Baa'ri are at coordinates 55,35 in Shadowmoon Valley. The tablets can be found on the ground as well as drop off the Ashtongue Workers.
