==Description==
He hides in my thoughts, mortal. He waits for me to break... for me to bend to his will.

And this will be his undoing. I will call for him. I will tell him that I will do as he asks. When he appears, kill him and take the key!

Know this: Zuluhed is an ancient orc with unknown powers. He has surely been empowered further by Illidan. You risk your life for me in doing as I ask. Are you certain you wish to make such a sacrifice?

==Progress==
You must... free... my children...

==Completion==
I am free! You have saved us, <name>!
