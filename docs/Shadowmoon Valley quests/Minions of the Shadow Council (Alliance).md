==Objectives==
[[Stormer Ewan Wildwing]] at the [[Deathforge Tower]] wants you to kill 10 Deathforge Guardians and 5 Deathforge Summoners.
*[[Deathforge Guardian]] slain (10)
*[[Deathforge Summoner]] slain (5)

==Description==
<Ewan listens to you recount the events at [[Legion Hold]], nodding.>

That puts our observations into perspective. We've caught glimpses of them launching [[infernal]]s in the direction of the hold, but haven't been able to find much more than that.

The [[Shadow Council]] has the [[Deathforge]] sealed tighter than a new keg o' thunderbrew. The first thing you'll need to do is crack some skulls so you can get in there and poke around. Start eliminating the Shadow Council guarding the entrance to the Deathforge!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38}} at max level)

==Progress==
Have you cleared a way into the Deathforge yet?

==Completion==
I wish I could've been out there with you! I've been itching to put my hammer to use, but my mission is to observe, not to kill.

Now that you've punched a hole in their defenses, let's get to work on shutting down production in the Deathforge.
