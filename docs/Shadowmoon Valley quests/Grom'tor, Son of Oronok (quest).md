==Objectives==
Find [[Grom'tor, Son of Oronok]] at [[Coilskar Point]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]].

==Description==
My first born, Grom'tor, left to search Coilskar Point - directly southwest of here.

He's the warrior in the family - ill-tempered and blood-thirsty... Traits he inherited from his mother. Search along the outskirts of Coilskar Point. If you see naga corpses, Grom'tor is sure to be close.

When you find him, tell him this: "We spill blood for just cause." It will let him know that you are a friend to Torn-heart and prevent your premature death.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||75|}}
* 1,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Grom'tor grunts.>

It's good you came. This maggot just spilled its guts. We've got them now!

==Progression==
