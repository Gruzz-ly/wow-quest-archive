==Objectives==
[[Wing Commander Nuainn]], outside of [[Wildhammer Stronghold]], wants you to kill 10 Infernal Attackers.
*[[Infernal Attacker]] slain (10)

==Description==
Don't let your guard down, <race>. We're under constant assault from the [[Burning Legion]].

From their base of [[Legion Hold]] to the northwest, the [[demon]]s rain down a ceaseless stream of [[infernal]]s. As quickly as we can kill them, the new meteors impact and begin a new wave of attacks.

My men are ragged and exhausted. I don't know how much longer they'll hold out. Please, <name>, lend your help to our defenses. Take your place on the line and halt the advance of the infernals!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Have you tired already, <class>? 

==Completion==
Thank you for relieving my men, <name>. With your help, and that of others, we may yet hold out. Unfortunately, merely holding out is not enough. We must go on the offensive.

==Progression==
