'''Stand Tall, Captain!''' is a reward quest for achieving {{reputation|honored}} reputation with [[Netherwing]] and is an implicit prerequisite for all newly-available quests at honored.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Overlord Mor'ghor]] at [[Dragonmaw Base Camp]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]].

==Description==
Well, well, well... still alive I see. That's good, because Mor'ghor has requested your presence in his tower at once. Get a move on!

==Reward==
You will receive: [[Captain's Badge]]
{{clrl}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|40}}

==Completion==
<Mor'ghor nods.>

That's right, I said captain. You've earned another promotion, <name>.

You certainly don't work like any fel orc I've ever seen. Keep this up and you might make overlord some day.

Now get out there and take command. I would suggest you try and earn your Skybreaker wings.
