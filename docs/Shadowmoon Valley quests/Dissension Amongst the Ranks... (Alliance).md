==Objectives==
Slay 5 [[Crazed Colossus]] while in disguise as an agent of Illidan and return to [[Thane Yoregar]] at [[Wildhammer Stronghold]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]]. He will also want his Wildhammer Flare Gun returned.
*Crazed Colossus slain while in disguise (5)
*[[Enchanted Illidari Tabard]] (provided)
*[[Wildhammer Flare Gun]]

==Description==
Gnomus was kind enough to put this concoction together for the final strike. I merely pour it upon this tabard that you have provided for me and the item is imbued with the essence of the Illidari filth.

Take the enchanted tabard and travel to the Eclipsion Fields, southwest of Eclipse Point. Once there, use the tabard to transform into an agent of Illidan. While in disguise, slay the crazed colossi that wander the field. They will think it an attack by the Eclipsion and sever all ties!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Evoker's Mark of the Redemption|Spellsword's Mark of the Redemption|Slayer's Mark of the Redemption|Protector's Mark of the Redemption}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|20|}}
*19000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|11|40|}} at max level)

==Progress==
You have returned!

==Completion==
Well, well, well... If it isn't the soldier I sent out into the field. You're back and in one piece.

<Yoregar nods.>

I knew you wouldn't let me down, soldier. You've stopped a major Illidari advance and, in doing so, earned yourself a little reward.
