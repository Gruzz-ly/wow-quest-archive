==Objectives==
Grokom Deatheye at [[Shadowmoon Village]] wants you to bring him Makazradon's Glaive and Morgroron's Glaive.
*[[Morgroron's Glaive]]
*[[Makazradon's Glaive]]

==Description==
With a larger supply of this material, I can forge a weapon suitable for you.

The two pit lords at Legion Hold, [[Makazradon]] and [[Morgroron]], have already been equipped with these anti-demon weapons. Capturing those two weapons should provide us with enough material to make your weapon, and then some.

I can't wait to bring the battle to the enemy using these weapons. That'll teach the Legion to trifle with anti-demon magics.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Ashwalker's Footwraps|Azurestrike Shoulders|Darkhunter's Cinch|Singed Vambraces}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you capture those prototypes?

==Completion==
These should work nicely. Now, let's forge them into a more useful form.

==Notes==
Upon completing the quest, Grokom Deatheye will go to a nearby anvil to work on the weapons. After a few seconds, he will say:
*{{text|say|No, this isn't right. What happened here?}}
*{{text|say|The metal has lost its magic. I could make a weapon from it, but it would be no different from a mundane blade.}}
