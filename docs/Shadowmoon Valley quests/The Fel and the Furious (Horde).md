This quest is part of a chain that starts with [[Kroghan's Report]].

==Objectives==
Use a [[Fel Reaver Control Console]] to take control of a [[Fel Reaver Sentinel]]. Destroy 60 Deathforged Infernals before your [[fel reaver]] fails. When your mission is complete, report to Nakansi at [[Invasion Point: Cataclysm]].
*[[Deathforged Infernal]] destroyed (60)

==Description==
<Nakansi leafs through the manual.>

All the information is here, but be warned. These things weren't built to be controlled remotely.

We can modify one for you to use for a short time, but you'll have to work fast, or there's no telling what might happen! I wouldn't be surprised if your little stunt with the fel reaver catches the attention of the [[Legion]] scum, either. Try to keep yourself safe, but remember, the mission and the safety of [[Shadowmoon Village]] come first!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*15400 [[experience]] (or {{cost|9|24}} at max level)

==Progress==
You're back, so I'll assume the operation went well. What've you got to report?

==Completion==
I'll admit it, <name>. I'm impressed by all you've managed to accomplish. Destroying the Legion's ability to make war in Shadowmoon will give us the opportunity to turn the tide elsewhere.

==Notes and trivia==
