==Objectives==
The [[Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit]] at the [[Altar of Shadows]] in southeast [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to recover Gorefiend's Cloak.
*[[Gorefiend's Cloak]]

==Description==
Many a cruel act he committed but none so cold as the slaughter of the clerics of [[Karabor]].

After [[Gul'dan]]'s [[Old Horde|Horde]] defeated the [[draenei]] of Karabor, the surviving clerics of Karabor were marched out, told that they were to be taken to [[Hellfire Citadel]] as prisoners of war.

[[Gorefiend]], not yet a [[death knight]], murdered each and every last one of them in cold blood. They now roam in front of the [[Black Temple]] with vengeance in their hearts.

It is the clerics of Karabor that hold the cloak of Gorefiend.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|59|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
You must use the [[Spectrecles]] if you wish to see the spirits of Shadowmoon.

==Completion==
When I have all three of the pieces in my possession, I will be able to divine the whereabouts of Gorefiend.
