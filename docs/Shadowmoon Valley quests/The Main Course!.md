==Objectives==
Gnomus at [[Wildhammer Stronghold]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to recover Felspine's Hide.
*[[Felspine's Hide]]

==Description==
Long story short, I used to work with a [[blood elf]] named [[Tiorus]]. My partnership with Tiorus dissolved once I got into gourmet living. He decided to take it upon himself to continue our research using MY inventions. Anyhow, he had some of his [[Horde]] goons using my [[Arcano-Scorp|arcano-scorp]] probes at the [[Ruins of Baa'ri]] lava flow and discovered the mother of all [[diemetradon]]s!

I need you to get there before he does and kill the diemetradon, [[Felspine the Greater|Felspine]], and bring his hide back to me.

Hurry up!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|8|80|}}
*12650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|59|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Special of the day: Felspine's hide.

==Completion==
I'll need some alone time now, <name>. Thanks for all the help!
