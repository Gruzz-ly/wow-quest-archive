'''Altruis''' sends the players to [[Nagrand]] in search of a [[Demon Hunter]] that is not allied with [[Illidan]].

==Objectives==
Travel to western Nagrand and find [[Altruis the Sufferer]].

Completing quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease. 

==Description==
It is rare in this day and age to hear of those who follow the path of the demon hunter. It is rarer still to find someone who does and has no allegiance to Illidan.

There are rumors of one such individual here in Outland. One name is said to be feared in the Legion fields of Nagrand more than any army of Aldor vindicators. That name is Altruis.

Go to western Nagrand and find him. He might be willing to shed some light on these new demon hunter training grounds.

==Completion==
You've come a long way, stranger.  I'm surprised whoever sent you has heard of me.  

==Notes==
;Upon completion
:{{text|say|Altruis the Sufferer|The information you seek... I cannot give you that freely. You will have to prove that your enemies are the same as mine.}} 
The three next separate quests in the chain are done by the player for proving that this is the case.

==Progression==
