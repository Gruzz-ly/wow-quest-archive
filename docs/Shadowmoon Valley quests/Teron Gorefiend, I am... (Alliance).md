==Objectives==
The [[Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit]] has used you as a pawn! Now that you have collected the items he required, he has revealed himself to be [[Teron Gorefiend]]. To break free of his possession, you must do his bidding and slay Karsius the Ancient Watcher.

If you succeed, return to [[Zorus the Judicator]] at [[Wildhammer Stronghold]].
*[[Karsius the Ancient Watcher]] slain

==Description==
With Gorefiend's items restored, there is but one last piece to this puzzle: A host.

<The ancient shadowmoon spirit's lips curl up to form a wicked grin.>

Surely you did not believe the fairy tale that I told you. The [[Altar of Shadows]] is my prison. Without your help, I would have been stuck here for all eternity. Now, I will take over your body and you will destroy my captors and break these bonds. Refuse and we will both be stuck here forever.

[[Teron Gorefiend]] will be free!

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of the following rewards:
*[[Evoker's Helmet of Second Sight]]
*[[Druidic Helmet of Second Sight]]
*[[Stealther's Helmet of Second Sight]]
*[[Shamanistic Helmet of Second Sight]]
*[[Stalker's Helmet of Second Sight]]
*[[Overlord's Helmet of Second Sight]]

You will also receive:
*19,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What's that you say?

==Completion==
You did what? FOOL!

You must right this wrong. After all, it is your fault. Take one of these helmets. They are each infused with the [[Ever-Burning Ash|ever-burning ash]] that you retrieved for me. More importantly, they will allow you to see the ghosts of Shadowmoon, including Teron Gorefiend.

Should you ever find Teron Gorefiend, destroy him.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit|Your body is mine! Our fates are forever intertwined.}}

The spirit turns into Teron Gorefiend, and the player is automatically put in control of him, while the player's own character turns into a static [[wisp]] nearby.
:{{Abilities|Teron Gorefiend|id=37748|Possessed by Teron Gorefiend.|icon=spell_shadow_coneofsilence}}

[[Karsius the Ancient Watcher]] and a number of [[Chain of Shadows|Chains of Shadows]] appear.
:{{Text|say|Karsius the Ancient Watcher|Your pathetic attempt to escape will be short lived, Gorefiend. Let the <boy/girl> go and submit! Even with your armor and weapons, you cannot defeat the ancients!}}
:{{Text|whisper|The Voice of Gorefiend|Waste no time, fool! Use our power to kill those that stand in our way! Destroy Karsius before you are subdued!}}

As Gorefiend, the player has the following abilities, all based on [[Death Knight (Warcraft II)#Spells|death knight spells]] from ''[[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness|Warcraft II]]''.
#{{Abilities|Unholy Armor|id=37729|Absorbs X Physical damage. Lasts 15 sec.|icon=spell_shadow_nethercloak|notes=Instant. 1 sec cooldown.}}
#{{Abilities|Touch of Darkness|id=37727|Steals X life from target enemy.|icon=ability_creature_cursed_03|notes=Instant. 20 yd range.}}
#{{Abilities|Death and Decay|id=37788|X shadow damage inflicted every 2 sec to all targets in the affected area.|icon=spell_shadow_deathanddecay|notes=2 sec cast. 30 yd range. 30 sec cooldown.}}
#{{Abilities|Haste|id=37728|Increases your haste by X.|icon=spell_nature_invisibilty}}

Karsius uses only melee attacks, while the Chains of Shadows periodically damage Gorefiend by casting Enforced Submission. If Gorefiend is killed, the player character gets ejected and resumes control of their own character. If Gorefiend for whatever reason loses aggro, such as through entering combat by attacking one of the Chains of Shadows instead of Karsius, Karsius will attack the player character instead. Upon dealing enough damage to the latter, the player gets ejected from Gorefiend, and the battle ends. In either case, the player will need to abandon and re-accept the quest.
:{{Text|yell|Karsius the Ancient Watcher|Let this be a lesson to those that would do evil to our lands!}}

Use Gorefiend's abilities as often as possible to kill the watcher.
:{{Text|yell|Karsius the Ancient Watcher|What ... have you done...}}

The player immediately returns to their own body, which turns back to normal, and the Chains of Shadows despawn. Gorefiend mounts up on a skeletal horse.
:{{Text|say|Teron Gorefiend|We will [[Teron Gorefiend (tactics)|meet again]]... Someday.}}
:{{Text|yell|Teron Gorefiend|Death incarnate has been released upon the world once more! Teron Gorefiend has returned...}}

He rides off to the northeast, despawning at the southern edge of [[Netherwing Pass]].
