'''Altruis''' sends the players to [[Nagrand]] in search of a [[Demon Hunter]] that is not allied with [[Illidan]].

==Objectives==
Travel to western Nagrand and find [[Altruis the Sufferer]].

Completing quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.  

==Description==
You don't see many demon hunters nowawdays. They're viewed with suspicion by their own people and it's very rare to find one that doesn't have some sort of allegiance to Illidan.

There are rumors of one such demon hunter out in Nagrand. His name is Altruis. He hates all demons with a passion and will help us if you can convince him that you share his goals.

Go to western Nagrand and find him. He might be willing to shed some light on these new demon hunter training grounds. 

==Completion==
You've come a long way, stranger.  I'm surprised whoever sent you has heard of me.  

==Notes==
Upon completing this quest, Altruis will say the following:
*{{text|say|The information you seek... I cannot give you that freely. You will have to prove that your enemies are the same as mine.}} 
The three next separate quests in the chain are done by the player for proving that this is the case.

==Progression==
{{Karabor Training Grounds}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
