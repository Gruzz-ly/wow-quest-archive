This quest is part of a chain that starts with [[Bring Down the Warbringer!]].

==Objectives==
Bring a Legion Teleporter Control to Blood Guard Gulmok at [[Shadowmoon Village]]. The [[Mo'arg]] Weaponsmiths at [[Legion Hold]] are known to carry the devices.
*[[Legion Teleporter Control]]

==Description==
According to Razuun's orders, the massive [[infernal]] staging area is called [[Invasion Point: Cataclysm]] and it's located in the mountains behind our village! The only way to reach it is by using a teleporter at Legion Hold.

Certain [[Legion]] minions carry a device allowing them to use the teleporter. You must capture one of these devices to win access to the teleporter. Slaughter all of the [[demon]]s if you must, but you can't afford to return empty-handed. Do not delay; the enemy is perilously close.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38}} at level 70)

==Progression==
A Legion presence in our midst is intolerable! We must find a way to deal with it before they can renew their assault.

==Completion==
At last, we have a means with which to drive the Legion from Shadowmoon!

==Progression==
{{Besieged!}}
