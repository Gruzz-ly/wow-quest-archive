==Objectives==
Slay the Dark Conclave Ritualists and use the Staff of [[Parshah]] to end the [[Dark Conclave]]'s summoning ritual, then return to [[Parshah]] in the Magma Fields.
*End Dark Conclave Summoning Ritual
*[[Staff of Parshah]] (provided)

==Description==
The spirits of the dark conclave seek to summon an [[Summoned Old God|ancient and powerful evil]] through a ritual conducted at the lava pits to the south of the Sketh'lon Base Camp.

Gul'dan's magic mingled with their own, empowering them to aid this creature in manifesting in our world! We must not allow this to happen, <name>. The death and destruction it would bring are unimaginable!

Carry the staff with you to the site of the summoning and use its magics to stop the dark conclave once and for all!

==Reward==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Sketh'lon Survivor's Tunic|Ash Tempered Legguards|Crown of Cinders|Runed Sketh'lon Legplates}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*15400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|9|24|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Is it done, <name>? Have you stopped the dark conclave from completing their ritual?

==Completion==
I have sought a way to stop the dark conclave for years, and you have succeeded where I failed. The conclave's dark rituals will threaten us no more.

I often feel guilty for abandoning my fellows all those years ago, but now I finally know that I made the right decision. If not for my wavering conscience then, I might have ended up as a shade among them.

==Trivia==
The monster they seem to be summoning is a smaller version of [[C'Thun]].
