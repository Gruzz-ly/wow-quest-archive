==Objectives==
Gnomus at [[Wildhammer Stronghold]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to recover 1 Overdeveloped Felfire Gizzard.
*[[Overdeveloped Felfire Gizzard]]

==Description==
I remember seeing larger diemetradons east of the Hand of Gul'dan, near the lava flows around the Ruins of Baa'ri. What I want you to get for me now is one overdeveloped felfire gizzard from the beasts around that area. You might have to kill several to find a gizzard like the one I described. Keep at it! One of them is bound to have my next meal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Special of the day: Gizzard.

==Completion==
This is fantastic but I just received some incredible news!
