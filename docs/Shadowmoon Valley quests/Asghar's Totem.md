==Objectives==
Bring the Sketh'lon War Totem to [[Parshah]] in the [[Magma Fields]].
*[[Sketh'lon War Totem]]

==Description==
What you read in the commander's journal is true. While the orcish [[Horde]] massed under [[Gul'dan]], my people sought to defend ourselves from the threat by striking against him. Gul'dan learned of their intentions and cast a mighty spell that destroyed our camps and twisted the spirits of my brothers.

They must be stopped before they unleash a greater evil. In the Sketh'lon Wreckage to the north, seek out Asghar and bring me the totem he carries. With it, we can begin to thwart the dark conclave's plans.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Have you recovered the totem from [[Asghar]]?

==Completion==
<Parshah examines the totem.>

Good. This old totem hasn't lost its power over the years, but it alone is not enough to stop the dark conclave.

==Progression==
{{Thwart the Dark Conclave}}
