This quest is part of the {{questchain|Ally of the Netherwing}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
[[Neltharaku]], flying high above [[Netherwing Fields]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]], wants you to slay 15 Dragonmaw Orcs.

Any Dragonmaw Orc in Dragonmaw Fortress will suffice.
*Dragonmaw Orc slain (15)

==Description==
I require time so that I may devise a plan to save my children and mate. You will buy me this time, mortal.

Venture into [[Dragonmaw Fortress]], located on the eastern edge of the [[Netherwing Fields]], and lay waste to all Dragonmaw orcs that you find. The ensuing chaos and confusion should have a considerable impact on their plans.

Be warned, some of my kin are too far gone - their minds corrupted by the Dragonmaw. For them, the only resolution is death. You have my permission to end their lives as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|59}}

==Progress==
Is it done? I can only hope that it is not too late...

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. I have discovered a way in which we can free the enslaved drakes that are being held at Dragonmaw Fortress.

==Progression==
{{Ally of the Netherwing}}
