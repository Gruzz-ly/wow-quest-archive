'''Kill Them All!''' is an introduction quest directing [[Scryers]]-affiliated players to the [[Sanctum of the Stars]]. The [[Aldor]] version of this quest can be found at [[Kill Them All! (Aldor)]]. This quest is available at {{reputation|revered}} reputation with [[Netherwing]] after completing [[Hail, Commander!]]

==Objectives==
Deliver news of your mission along with the Dragonmaw Flare Gun to [[Arcanist Thelis]] at the [[Sanctum of the Stars]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]].
*[[Dragonmaw Flare Gun]] (provided)

==Description==
Commander <name>, stand at attention! You are to take a battalion of Skybreakers and sack the Scryers' outpost located at the foot of the Netherwing Fields. With the Sanctum of the Stars destroyed, our lines of communication to our posts at Eclipse Point and Illidari Point will once more be open.

Go now! Use this flare gun to signal the Skybreakers for the attack!

==Progress==
Settle down, child.

==Completion==
It is good that you came to us. Perhaps we can use this attack to our advantage and turn the tables on the Dragonmaw.

==Trivia==
Name of this quest is probably a reference to [[Wikipedia: Metallica|Metallica's]] first album [[Wikipedia: Kill 'Em All|Kill 'Em All]].
