==Objectives==
Bring the Illidari-Bane Shard to [[Ordinn Thunderfist]] at [[Wildhammer Stronghold]].
*[[Illidari-Bane Shard]] (provided)

==Description==
The shard appears to be a piece of a larger weapon. Sharp-looking runes etched into the metal glow with a menacing light.

The weapon's intended purpose isn't clear to you, but it's hard to ignore. Most of the [[mo'arg]] at [[Legion Hold]] seem to be working with fragments of the same metal you hold in your hand. Perhaps one of the weaponsmiths at [[Wildhammer Stronghold]] might be able to tell you more about it.

==Reward==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*9250 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|55|}} at max level)

==Progress==
What have you got there?

==Completion==
<Ordinn accepts the weapon fragment from you.>

I haven't seen something like this in a long time. Sure, it's made from a rare ore, but this is destined for no mundane weapon, <name>. It's infused with a magic intended to destroy demons. If you obtained this from the Legion, it must be some kind of 'secret weapon' they're planning to deploy against Illidan. What a find!
