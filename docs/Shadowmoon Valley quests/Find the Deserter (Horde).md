==Objectives==
Locate [[Parshah]] in the [[Magma Fields]] and speak to him.

==Description==
There's nothing here that would explain why the spirits of these [[arakkoa]] have remained in this world or how they came into thirst for the blood of orcs.

I think our best lead is to try to find the deserter mentioned in the journal. If he left his comrades at the camp, there's a chance you might be able to persuade him to help us understand what the dark conclave arakkoa are planning.

Start your search for him on the road through the [[Magma Fields]] to the southeast.

==Completion==
<The arakkoa cackles.>

Yes, I am the deserter mentioned in the commander's journal. I have been waiting for the day when others might recognize the threat posed by those I once called brothers.
