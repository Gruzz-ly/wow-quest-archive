'''Netherdust Pollen''' is one of three profession specific [[Daily quest|Daily Quests]] offered by [[Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath]].

==Objectives==
[[Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath]] at [[Dragonmaw Base Camp]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to bring him 40 Netherdust Pollen.
*[[Netherdust Pollen]] (40)

==Description==
A flower picker?! Hilarious... Unfortunately, our mages and shaman need your services. The netherdust bushes that grow on this ledge have special pollen that is apparently very useful in their magical dealings. Bring me that stuff and I'll consider your work order complete.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|40}} (or {{cost|7|59}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Netherwing]]

==Progress==
Like I said, netherdust pollen is used by our spell casters.

==Completion==
You're done for today, kid. Come back tomorrow if you're still alive.

==Notes==
The other profession quests he offers are:
* [[Nethermine Flayer Hide (quest)]] (Skill level of 350 in [[Skinning]] required)
* [[Nethercite Ore (quest)]] (Skill level of 350 in [[Mining]] required)

''Even if you have multiple gathering professions you still can only complete one of these per day.''

==Patch changes==
