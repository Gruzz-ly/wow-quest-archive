==Description==
Word has come from my wind riders, &lt;name&gt;. The Eclipsion blood elves are planning something big. They have begun forming their armies at the Path of Conquest, far to the southeast - adjacent to Eclipse Point.

I want you to travel to the Path of Conquest and assess the situation. Once you have done so, use this flare gun to signal a wind rider. One will swoop down from the sky to meet you. Inform them of what you have discovered and they will give you your next set of orders. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9500 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|70|}} at max level)

==Progress==
What have you to report, soldier?

==Completion==
Indeed, these troublesome whelps are up to something insidious. We must investigate further...
