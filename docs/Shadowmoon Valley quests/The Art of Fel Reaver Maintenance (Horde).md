This quest is part of a chain that starts with [[Bring Down the Warbringer!]].

==Objectives==
Kill [[Doctor Maleficus]] and obtain the Doctor's Key. Use the key to open the [[Doctor's Strongbox]] to retrieve The Art of Fel Reaver Maintenance and deliver the book to Nakansi at [[Invasion Point: Cataclysm|Invasion Point Cataclysm]].
*[[The Art of Fel Reaver Maintenance]]
*[[The Doctor's Key]]

==Description==
The best way to destroy the rest of the Legion's supplies is to use their own weapons against them. I've been working on a rig that will let you take control of one of those [[Fel Reaver Sentinel]]s below.

There are a couple things I need to work out, yet. For that, I'll need the manual that Doctor Maleficus keeps locked in a chest near the bottom of the ramp. He probably won't give up the key without a fight, so you'll need to capture it. Bring the fel reaver manual back to me and I'll do the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Did you get that manual?

==Completion==
This has the information I'm looking for. Just a couple more tweaks, and we'll have you taking control of a fel reaver in no time.

==Notes==
This quest seems to be a tribute to "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values," a 1974 novel by Robert M. Pirsig.

==Progression==
{{Besieged!}}
