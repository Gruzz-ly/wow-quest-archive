==Objectives==
[[Earthmender Torlok]] at the [[Altar of Damnation]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to use the Totem of Spirits to capture 8 Earthen Souls and 8 Fiery Souls.
*Earthen Soul Captured (8)
*Fiery Soul Captured (8)
*[[Totem of Spirits]] (provided)

==Description==
We must try and make amends. We must commune with the elements of this region and see if anything can be done!

I grant you the totem of spirits, <race>. If you slay an enraged elemental spirit in close proximity of the totem, it will consume the elemental's soul. You must use the totem to consume many souls before you may return to me.

Do this for the spirits of fire and earth first. Return to me when the totem is full.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I fear that this land may be without hope.

==Completion==
When all of the elemental souls of this region have been placed inside the totem, we will commune with them and find out if anything can be done for Shadowmoon Valley.

==Notes==
You are given a totem which you must drop before the Enraged Fire/Earth Spirit is killed.  Once it is killed within range of the totem, your questlog will mark off one more soul captured.  Multiple spirits can be killed using the same totem (about three at the maximum before it dies), but the totems are unlimited, and don't have a long cooldown for placement, so this is somewhat unnecessary.  These two types of elementals are generally found in the same location; one location is 44,47.
