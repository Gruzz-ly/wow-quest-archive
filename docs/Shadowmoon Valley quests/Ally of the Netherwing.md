This is the final quest in the {{questchain|Ally of the Netherwing}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Let [[Karynaku]] return you to [[Mordenai]] in the [[Netherwing Fields]].

==Description==
Allow me to return you to Mordenai. I am certain that he wishes to see you once more.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of the following|Claw of the Netherwing Flight|Netherwing Defender's Shield|Netherwing Protector's Shield|Netherwing Sorcerer's Charm|Netherwing Spiritualist's Charm}}

==Completion==
You have proven yourself as an ally of the Netherwing. My mother is free and my brothers and sisters are saved!

Perhaps someday, we will call for you again. When that day comes, know that you will be welcomed with open arms - a brother to the Netherwing Dragonflight.

==Notes==
On accept, the adventurer is automatically taken on dragonback and slowly flies to Netherwing Fields where Neltharaku awaits on the ground.

:''Karynaku lands next to Neltharaku. Mordenai approaches and kneels.''
