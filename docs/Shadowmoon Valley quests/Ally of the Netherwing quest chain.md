# Ally of the Netherwing quest chain

This quest chain introduces the player to the [[Netherwing]] [[faction]].

Only the last quest in the chain actually affects your standing with this
faction, but it advances you directly to Neutral.

As one of the quest-giving NPCs is perpetually in flight, a flying mount is
required to complete the quests in this chain.

== Ally of the Netherwing ==

;[[Kindness]]
:Wandering the wilds of [[Shadowmoon Valley]], you come across [[Mordenai]] in the [[Netherwing Fields]].  Mordenai pleads that you help him feed the Netherdrakes, who have been disturbed by something.
::''You will find out later that Mordenai, who poses as a High Elf, is the son of [[Karynaku]] and [[Neltharaku]].''

;[[Seek Out Neltharaku]]
:After cutting down any number of {{mob|Rocknail Flayer|level=69}}s and {{mob|Rocknail Ripper||Ripper|level=68-69}}s, and feeding the drakes, Mordenai suggests that perhaps {{NPC|Neutral|Neltharaku|level=72+|icon=DragonNether}}, the patron of the [[Netherwing dragonflight]], can help you discover what the problem is.  This does require a flying mount, and a search of the skies over [[Netherwing Fields]].

;[[Neltharaku's Tale]]
:Neltharaku asks you to hear its tale.

;[[Infiltrating Dragonmaw Fortress]]
:You are moved by his tale and offer to help.
:Now that he has hope, Neltharaku first asks that you stir up trouble with the [[Dragonmaw Fortress]],  to buy time for him to come up with a plan. You descend upon the fortress and slaughter a few of the orcs there.

;[[To Netherwing Ledge!]]
:Returning, you find that Neltharaku has indeed come up with a plan.  To the southeast lies [[Netherwing Ledge]], a location abounding with {{loot|common|Nethervine Crystal}}s. He believes that he can infuse these with enough of his own essence to break the control of the Dragonmaw.
:You fly down to [[Netherwing Ledge]].  Despite the strong Dragonmaw presence, you collect a number of these crystals.

;[[The Force of Neltharaku]]
:Neltharaku eagerly enchants these, and passes you the result: an {{loot|common|Enchanted Nethervine Crystal}}.
:You use this crystal on the {{mob|Enslaved Netherwing Drake|level=69-71|icon=DrakeNether}}s at [[Dragonmaw Fortress]], and in turn help newly freed drakes against their former captors.

;[[Karynaku (quest)]]
:Neltharaku then asks that you find and free his mate.  Unlike the lesser drakes, [[Karynaku]] lies chained at the top of Dragonmaw Fortress.
:You reach the bailey of Dragonmaw Fortress, and ... arrange... a few moments to speak with Karynaku.  She tells you that the chains themselves are sapping her power, keeping her there.

;[[Zuluhed the Whacked (quest)]]
:The one who holds the {{loot|common|Zuluhed's Key|key}}, she tells you, is [[Zuluhed the Whacked]], Chieftain of the Dragonmaw Clan.
:You challenge Zuluhed and defeat him, no mean feat.  Grabbing the key from the body, you strip the chains from Karynaku.

;[[Ally of the Netherwing]]
:Karynaku offers to return you to [[Mordenai]].  You are f&ecirc;ted again, and declared an Ally of the Netherwing!
