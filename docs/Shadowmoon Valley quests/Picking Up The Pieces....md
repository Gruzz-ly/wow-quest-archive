'''Picking Up The Pieces...''' is a once-daily collection quest, having players recover 15 [[Nethermine Cargo]] crates. This quest is the followup to [[The Netherwing Mines]], available at {{reputation|friendly}} reputation with [[Netherwing]].

==Objectives==
The [[Mistress of the Mines]] at the [[Netherwing Mines]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] wants you to recover 15 Nethermine Cargo crates.
*[[Nethermine Cargo]] (15)

==Description==
Much of our hard work lies scattered about in these mines. Carts full of cargo are littered across every inch of this mine! We just can't get to any of it with the current infestation.

That's where you come in, <name>. Your daily duty here at this mine is to collect the cargo left behind by the miners and deep mine workers.

Gather the nethermine cargo and return it to me or my sister.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|18|28}} ({{cost|8|80}} + converted XP)

==Progress==
Have you gathered the cargo?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Return tomorrow for another mission into the depths of the mine.

==Notes==
Nethermine Cargo is a ground spawn, like herbs and minerals, that appears commonly in the mines.
