'''Seeker of Truth''' is the followup to [[The Great Murkblood Revolt]]. Players are asked to retrieve information and a [[Hand of the Overseer]] from a [[Murkblood Overseer]] in the [[Netherwing Mines]].

==Objectives==
Find a [[Murkblood Overseer]] and interrogate him. Return to the [[Mistress of the Mines]] with the Murkblood information and the [[Hand of the Overseer]].
*Murkblood Information Gathered
*[[Hand of the Overseer]]

==Description==
These miners are far too stupid to concoct any type of escape plan. We must find and punish the source. Venture into the depths of the mine and seek out the Murkblood overseers. If they have not been overcome by the denizens of the mine, they will undoubtedly be hiding.

Once you locate one, interrogate him until he reveals the true mastermind behind the escape. Return to me with the identity of this traitor and the hand of the overseer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|40}}
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Netherwing]]

==Progress==
Well? What's taking so long?

==Completion==
Nothing to say? Perhaps as he lies bleeding to death on the floor of this cursed mine he will remember... Remember what it means to cross the forces of Illidan!

==Notes==
[[Murkblood Overseer]]s are in the flayer area of the [[Netherwing Mines]]. Pay attention to the Overseer's gossip text while interrogating him.

;Conversation with the Murkblood Overseer

:<The Murkblood overseer grunts.>

:{{Gossip|I am here for you, overseer.}}

::They sent you to kill me, eh?  So predictable... Creatures ruled by terror are all the same.

::But you... You are not one of them...

::{{Gossip|How dare you question an overseer of the Dragonmaw!}}

:::Overseer?

:::You are no more an overseer than I am the king of Stormwind.  Yes... You are the one they speak of.

:::{{Gossip|Who speaks of me?  What are you talking about, broken?}}

::::The [[Netherwing]].  They speak to us.  They offered us peace and protection.  Something the broken have never truly felt.  We accepted their offer and assisted [[Toranaku]] in rousing the creatures of this mine - at great personal cost to us.  Many of my brothers gave their lives for this offensive.  We were attempting to make the mine uninhabitable, forcing the Dragonmaw to relocate and ultimately move off of this island.

::::{{Gossip|Continue please.}}

::::The [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]] are corrupt.  They are strip-mining this island of all natural resources and using those resources to supply [[Illidan]]'s armies out of the [[Black Temple]].  They take much for themselves, however, and sell whatever they have hidden away to the highest bidder.

::::{{Gossip|Who are these bidders?}}

:::::We do not know.  We believe that the [[Black dragonflight]] is involved as are some independent third parties.  That is why you are here, <race>.  You will unravel this mystery from the inside and bring redemption to Netherwing.

:::::And now... I can only assume she asked you to bring back my hand.

:::::{{Gossip|Well... yes.}}

::::::I gladly make such a sacrifice if it means the downfall of the Dragonmaw.
