==Objectives==
Slay 20 Eclipsion Soldiers, 10 Eclipsion Cavaliers, and 10 Eclipsion Spellbinders and then use the [[:Kor'kron Flare Gun]] to signal another [[Kor'kron Wind Rider]] to report your task complete.

Speak with [[Overlord Or'barokh]] at [[Shadowmoon Village]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]] should you lose your Kor'kron Flare Gun and require a replacement.
*[[Eclipsion Soldier]] slain (20)
*[[Eclipsion Spellbinder]] slain (10)
*[[Eclipsion Cavalier]] slain (10)

==Description==
We're going to need more time, <race>. I'm going to fly further ahead with some of the other wind riders. Hopefully, we can gather some more information. What I need from you now is to clear a path and more importantly, keep their arrows pointed away from us!

Call for a wind rider with the Kor'kron flare gun once you have thinned their numbers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*15800 [[XP]] (or {{cost|9|48|}} at max level)

==Progress==
What have you to report, soldier?

==Completion==
You won't believe this, [[grunt]].

==Progression==
{{The Path of Conquest}}
