==Objectives==
Defeat Warbringer Razuun, recover Razuun's Orders, and report to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village.
*[[Warbringer Razuun]] slain
*[[Razuun's Orders]]
*[[Deathforge Key]] (provided)

==Description==
We've made a lot of progress against the [[Shadow Council]] here at the Deathforge, but now it's time to finish the job.

I found a key among the items in [[Kagrosh]]'s pack. At least he accomplished something before they got to him.

The key should help you to track down this Warbringer Razuun you observed at [[Legion Hold]].

After you've hunted down and dealt with Warbringer Razuun, report directly to Blood Guard Gulmok. We must not keep him waiting.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38}} at level 70)

==Progress==
What news do you bring from the Deathforge?

==Completion==
<You make your report to the blood guard and hand over the captured orders.>

Good work, <name>, but don't go thinking you'll be getting any ribbons for it. Let the night elves decorate their pretty little uniforms if they wish. Real warriors share tales of battle over a mug of ale.

==Notes==
The upper (right) entrance into the Deathforge is the one you must go through. Continue past the bridge, hug the left wall and use your key on the gate in the room filled with tinkerers and weaponsmiths. Coordinates for entrance are located at 40,38.
