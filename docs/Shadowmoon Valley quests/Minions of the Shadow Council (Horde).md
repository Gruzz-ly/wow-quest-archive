==Objectives==
Scout Zagran at Slag Watch wants you to kill 10 Deathforge Guardians and 5 Deathforge Summoners.
*[[Deathforge Guardian]] slain (10)
*[[Deathforge Summoner]] slain (5)

==Description==
<Zagran listens to you recount the events at [[Legion Hold]], nodding.>

That fills in the gaps we've seen. We've caught glimpses of them launching [[infernal]]s in the direction of the hold, but haven't been able to find much more than that.

The [[Shadow Council]] has the forge pretty much locked down. Looks like you're going to need to fight your way in. Start eliminating the Shadow Council guarding the entrance to the [[Deathforge]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38}} at max level)

==Progress==
Have you cleared a way into the Deathforge yet?

==Completion==
I'd've been down there cracking skulls myself, but I'm under strict orders not to engage the enemy.

<The scout grumbles, doing a fair imitation of Blood Guard Gulmok's voice.>

Let's get to work on shutting down production in there.
