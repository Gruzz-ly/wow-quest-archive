==Description==
The [[Ashtongue]] tribe is feared among all [[Broken]]. It consists of the most vicious and bloodthirsty individuals, handpicked by [[Akama]] himself. They are as fierce and ruthless as any naga, demon or blood elf in [[Illidan]]'s army and they have been deployed in large numbers at the Ruins of Baa'ri, to the north. Go there and put a dent in their numbers before they get a chance to mount an attack on us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12,650 [[XP]]
*-275 [[reputation]] with [[The Aldor]]
*+250 reputation with [[The Scryers]]

==Progress==
Have you completed the task I requested of you, <name>?

==Completion==
Glory to the Scryers, <name>. You've done the Seer's bidding by defeating those who follow Illidan.
