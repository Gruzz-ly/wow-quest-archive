==Objectives==
Scout Zagran at Slag Watch wants you to search the Deathforge for Kagrosh and recover Kagrosh's Pack. 
*[[Kagrosh's Pack]]

==Description==
The scouting party originally had three members. Unfortunately, [[Kagrosh]] decided he wanted to be a hero.

He descended into the [[Deathforge]] and we haven't heard from him since.

In all likelihood, the fool's gone and gotten himself killed. [[The Shadow Council]] members aren't idiots and Kagrosh wasn't exactly strong in the subtlety department, if you know what I mean. Keep an eye out for him in the Deathforge and recover any information or items he might have collected. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|10|}}
*12300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|38|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Did you find any sign of Kagrosh in the Deathforge?

==Completion==
<Zagran shakes his head as he accepts the pack from you>

I told you he was a fool. I hope there's something in here that justifies the time you spent searching for him.

==Notes==
;Interacting with the corpse

The orc's corpse has been casually tossed aside so as not to litter the walkway.
