This quest is part of a chain that starts with [[Bring Down the Warbringer!]]

==Objectives==
Return to [[Wildhammer Stronghold]] and speak with [[Kurdran Wildhammer]].

==Description==
You must bring word of our success to Kurdran Wildhammer immediately! His men, under Wing Commander Nuainn, have fought nonstop to keep Wildhammer Stronghold safe and your return will surely bolster their spirits. With the threat from the Legion out of the way, Kurdran can finally turn his attention to dealing with the forces of Illidan. Our place here is far from secure, but we've won a major victory this day.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Band of Anguish
|Gloves of the High Magus
}}

*You will also receive: {{cost|4|40|}}
*15800 [[XP]] (or a {{cost|9|48}} compensation at level 70)

==Completion==
<Kurdran listens to your report.>

That is good news, indeed! Mere days ago, I wouldn't have dreamt that we could break the Legion's siege on the stronghold.

Not only have you halted their offensive, but you've broken the back of their war machine as well! You have the gratitude of the Wildhammer clan for your valor, <name>.
