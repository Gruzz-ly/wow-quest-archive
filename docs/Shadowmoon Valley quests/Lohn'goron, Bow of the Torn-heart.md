*[[Lohn'goron, Bow of the Torn-Heart (quest item)]]

==Description==
It is a sign, <name>. Even in death, I cannot be stopped. Recovering a part of the Cipher of Damnation is my destiny. With your help, that destiny will be fulfilled.

Before we embark on that journey, I must have my longbow, Lohn'goron. It is a family heirloom that has been handed down from Torn-heart to Torn-heart for generations.

My instinct tells me that a demon stole it from my corpse. Kill the demons here until you find my bow.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|59|}}
* 12,650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Fear not, hero. When the time is right, I will assist you...

==Completion==

It means "hero's sojourn" in my native tongue. It rings true even now - in this era where our heroes have all died...

It seems as though one always rises.
