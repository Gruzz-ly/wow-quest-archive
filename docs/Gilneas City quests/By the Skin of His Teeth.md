Hold back the [[worgen]] atop the [[Stoneward Prison|Gilneas City Prison]] for 2 minutes.
*Survive while holding back the worgen for 2 minutes.
*Speak to [[Lord Darius Crowley]] at the top of [[Stoneward Prison]] in [[Gilneas City]].

==Description==
One of those mangy fleabags got {{NPC||Sean Dempsey||Dempsey}} real good. We cannot move him until we stabilize his bleeding.

Give us a hand holding back these mongrels. A couple of minutes is all we need, <brother/sister>!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Darius' Sash
|Dempsey's Gloves
|Bracers of the Queen's Gate
|Darius' Handguards
}}
You will also receive: {{cost|||75}}

==Progress==
Getting there! Careful or we'll lose him!

==Completion==
We did it, <name>. Thanks to you a good man has survived.

== Notes ==
Starting the quest will spawn in a large number of {{NPC||Worgen Runt||worgen runts}} and {{NPC||Bloodfang Bloodletter||Bloodfang Bloodletters}}, then {{NPC||Worgen Alpha||alphas}}. Also, players will be buffed with "By the Skin of His Teeth", a 2-minute timer buff so players can keep track of the situation. The buff appears to have a passive aggro effect, so stay by Crowley and let him do his thing to keep everyone alive. Once the buff fades the attack will stop. None of the quest-spawned mobs reward XP.
