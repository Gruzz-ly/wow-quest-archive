==Objectives==
Defeat 6 Bloodfang Lurkers.
*[[Bloodfang Lurker]] slain (6)
*[[Gilnean Mastiff Collar]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Josiah Avery|He]] turned into one of [[worgen|them]].... didn't he? How do we even begin to fight an enemy that can do this to us?

[[Darius Crowley|My father]]'s arsenal's certainly a good start, I suppose.

Worgen are hiding in the alleys ahead. Take one of [[Gilnean Mastiff|my mastiffs]] to find them more easily.

We're going to need to clear the way ahead if we're going to move these cannons above ground.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Mastiff Trainer's Wand|Alarmbringer's Mace|Houndmaster's Crossbow}}
{{Itembox|You will also receive: {{cost|||75}}
|Timeworn Staff}}

==Progress==
Is it done yet, <name>?

==Completion==
Excellent, I'll start rounding up some help to get these cannons positioned.

==Notes==
The mastiff has an "Attack Lurker" command, with a 30 yd range that can detect and attack the nearest Bloodfang Lurker. The command will cause the mastiff to "Heroic Leap" to the nearest lurker. Sending the mastiff in isn't strictly necessary, as the lurkers are merely stealthed. Wandering into them is also entirely possible.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Lorna Crowley|This mastiff will help you find the hidden worgen.}}
