==Objectives==
Speak to [[Genn Greymane|King Genn Greymane]] in the [[Military District]].

==Description==
It's time, <name>. We'll take it from here.

Tell King Greymane that [[Darius Crowley|my father's]] arsenal will be at his disposal. There's more than enough firepower to blow the worgen from here to the north sea.

==Completion==
I knew Crowley would come through. His weapons will be more than useful to us.

==Notes==
Head back up to street level, then take the southern street. Greymane's at a barricade trying to fend off worgen.

==Progression==
