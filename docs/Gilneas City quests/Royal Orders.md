==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Gwen Armstead}} in the [[Military District]] to the southeast.

==Description==
It's time for you to leave, <name>. Go to the Military District with the other civilians.

Check in with Gwen Armstead when you cross the bridge to the southeast... see if everyone's okay.

I will stay here with the guards and cover the civilians' retreat.

Go now. That is an order!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||50}}

==Completion==
We're all fine here. A little shaken... but alive.

== Notes ==
Phase 3. The Military District is southeast of the [[Merchant Square]]. Gwen has relocated to the south side of the bridge with a few {{NPC||Gilnean Survivor}}s and {{NPC||Marie Allen}}, a general goods vendor. The class trainers are further south of her.
