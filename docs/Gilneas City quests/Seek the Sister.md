==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Sister Almyra}} in the [[Military District]].

==Description==
Most of us made it here alive... but there are [[worgen]] on this side of the city as well.

We're going to continue heading south once everyone's accounted for.

That reminds me, someone was asking about you. A member of the [[Church of the Holy Light|clergy]], Sister Almyra, said that you were in great peril and needed the [[Light]]'s protection.

You should go talk to her. She seemed very concerned.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||35}}
*170 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Completion==
The Light is with you, <name>. It's still quite a relief to see you.

==Notes==
Priest-only.
