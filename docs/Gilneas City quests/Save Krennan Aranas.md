==Objectives==
Rescue Krennan Aranas.
*{{NPC||Krennan Aranas}} rescued

==Description==
All these years after the war and {{NPC||Darius Crowley||Crowley}} and was still hiding enough firepower in that cellar to level half the district.

It might have to come to that, unfortunately.

We can't open fire just yet, there is a civilian trapped on the other side of the prison.

Not just any civilian, either. Krennan Aranas is one of the most brilliant alchemists this world has known.

One of his potions saved my daughter, {{NPC||Tess Greymane||Tess}}, from dying soon after being born.

Take [[King Greymane's Horse|my horse]] and rescue him. Krennan must live.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||35}}

==Progress==
The king must be mad. Risking all our lives for just one lousy alchemist. Regardless, orders are orders.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. We'll make sure Krennan makes it out of the city alive.

== Notes ==
Accepting the quest puts the player on {{NPC||King Greymane's Horse||Greymane's mount}}. It will automatically start running to the other side of the district. The mount will jump, then land underneath a tree where Krennan is hanging. Once the horse stops moving, use the horse's ability, Rescue Krennan, to pick him up. The horse will then sprint back to safety. Completing the quest starts phase 5.
