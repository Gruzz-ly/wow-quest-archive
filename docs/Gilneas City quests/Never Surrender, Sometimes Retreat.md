==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Darius Crowley||Lord Darius Crowley}} inside the [[Light's Dawn Cathedral]].

==Description==
We had enough ammunition to carry on the [[Northgate Rebellion|civil war]] for another month. Yet the [[worgen|worgen's]] numbers are such that we're nearly spent.

We don't want to be caught out here in the open when that happens. Fall back inside the cathedral and report to the boss. I'm sure old Crowley will know what to do next.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||50}}

==Completion==
We've given them everything we have... yet still they come. Do not worry, <name>. We'll slay many more before today is over.

==Notes==
Completing this quest starts phase 6. {{NPC||Frenzied Stalker}}s are now in the cathedral and {{NPC||Northgate Rebel}}s are trying to fend them off.

==Progression==
