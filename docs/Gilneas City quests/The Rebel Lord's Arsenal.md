==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Josiah Avery}} at the [[Military District]] in [[Gilneas City (starting zone)|Gilneas City]].

==Description==
The arsenal {{NPC||Darius Crowley||Crowley}} speaks of is in the cellar of a building just west of here.

It is unnerving that artillery was smuggled inside the city by my enemies, yet it might end up saving [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilnean]] lives today.

Find Josiah Avery and requisition the rebel artillery. We will put the weapons to good use.

==Completion==
Don't look at me! Leave me alone!

== Notes ==
There's a glowing cellar door not far away from where the question mark appears on the minimap. Use it.

Completing the quest will put the player into phase 4. At that instant, Avery transforms into a worgen, attacks and knocks away the player, then gets shot and killed by [[Lorna Crowley]]. A warning appears:
*{{text|bossemote|You've been [[Worgen curse|bitten by a worgen]]. It's probably nothing, but it sure stings a little.}}

... and the player gains the following debuff:
*{{Abilities|Worgen Bite|You were bitten by a worgen.  The wound looks minor... maybe it'll go away with time?|id=72870|icon=inv misc monsterfang 02}}
