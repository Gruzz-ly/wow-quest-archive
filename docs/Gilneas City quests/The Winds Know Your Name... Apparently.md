==Objectives==
Speak to [[Celestine of the Harvest]] in the [[Military District]].

==Description==
Most of us made it here alive... but there are [[worgen]] on this side of the city as well.

We're going to continue heading south once everyone's accounted for.

That reminds me, someone was asking about you. It was that harvest-witch, Celestine; she said the winds spoke your name.

You'd best hurry, <name>. We're going to need you to get back to the worgen-smashing once you're done conversing with nature.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||35}}
*170 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Completion==
We have been blessed today!  You are alive and well!
