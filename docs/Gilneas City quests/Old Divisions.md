==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Captain Broderick}} inside [[Stoneward Prison]] in [[Gilneas City (starting zone)|Gilneas City]].

==Description==
{{NPC||Darius Crowley||Lord Darius Crowley}} has been called many things. Rebel. Traitor. Terrorist.

Before the [[Northgate Rebellion|civil war]] I called him... friend.

I never blamed him for leading an insurrection against me. His land and people were separated from [[Gilneas peninsula|Gilneas]] by a stone wall... but we had no choice.

Regardless... Crowley is exactly the type of person we need now.

Enter Stoneward Prison and ask Captain Broderick about Crowley's whereabouts. I'd send my own men, but there's still bad blood.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||7}}

==Completion==
{{NPC||Genn Greymane||Greymane}} wants to save Crowley? Has he gone mad?

==Notes==
Pick up [[While You're At It]] before heading in. The courtyard is opposite the assembled party to the east. Enter the door to your left where Broderick is at the staircase.
