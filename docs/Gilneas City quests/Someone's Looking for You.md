==Objectives==
Speak to [[Loren the Fence]] in the [[Military District]].

==Description==
Most of us made it here alive... but there are [[worgen]] on this side of the city as well.

We're going to continue heading south once everyone's accounted for.

That reminds me, someone was asking about you. A woman named Loren... she seemed a little disappointed when I told her you were all right.

I think she mentioned she owes you money.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||35}}
*170 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Completion==
Oh, hey! There you are!

==Notes==
This is a quest for only [[Worgen]] [[rogues]].
