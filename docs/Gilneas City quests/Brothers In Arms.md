==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Genn Greymane||King Genn Greymane}} at the [[Military District]] in [[Gilneas City]].

==Description==
Listen, <name>. For the first time since the [[Northgate Rebellion|civil war]] I agree with Greymane. Now is the time to put aside our quarrel.

It sure doesn't look like [[worgen|these beasts]] care much whether you're a rebel or a royal.

Send word back to Greymane. My men will join his.

There's a safehouse not far from here, in {{NPC||Josiah Avery||Josiah}}'s cellar. My lads stashed some heavy artillery there.

Tell our king that my arsenals are now at his disposal.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||5}}

==Completion==
Rebel arsenals? In my own city?

What in the bloody hell was {{NPC||Darius Crowley||Crowley}} up to?

==Notes==
*Either jump down or keep moving around the upper parapet. There's another stairway leading down.
