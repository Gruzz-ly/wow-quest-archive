==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Darius Crowley}} upstairs in the [[Stoneward Prison]] in [[Gilneas City]].

==Description==
I don't understand why the king wants to waste time saving his hide, but if you want to risk your life, then be my guest.

Crowley and his men are holed up upstairs, probably plotting against the king as we speak!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||5}}

==Completion==
{{NPC||Genn Greymane||Greymane}}'s right. [[Worgen|These beasts]] do not give a damn about our politics.

Gilneas needs to stand together.

== Notes ==
Head up the steps. Up top circle around to the north. Darius is in the middle with {{NPC||Tobias Mistmantle}}, {{NPC||Sean Dempsey}} and {{NPC||Vincent Hersham}}.
