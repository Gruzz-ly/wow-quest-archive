==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Myriam Spellwaker}} in the [[Military District]].

==Description==
Most of us made it here alive... but there are worgen on this side of the city as well.

We're going to continue heading south once everyone's accounted for.

That reminds me, someone was asking about you. It was a [[mage]] named Myriam. She mentioned something about you being "ready."

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||35}}
*170 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Completion==
A disciple of the arcane always finds a way forward. I'm glad to see you, <name>.

==Notes==
Head south, take a right down the steps to find Myriam and Cleese. This is only for [[Worgen]] [[Mages]].
