'''Lockdown!''' is the first quest of any Worgen player. It is located directly in front of the worgen when you create it, and you will automatically accept it when you speak to [[Prince Liam Greymane]]. In the quest, Liam Greymane sends you to [[Lieutenant Walden]] in order to evacuate the citizens to safety from a Worgen invasion.

==Objectives==
Find {{NPC||Lieutenant Walden}} in the northwestern end of the [[Merchant Square]].

==Description==
What are you still doing here, citizen? Haven't you heard? The city's under complete lockdown.

Go see Lieutenant Walden -- he'll give you further directions for evacuation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||c=15}}
*80 [[XP]]
*250 reputation with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Completion==
Deep claw marks run through the man's corpse.

==Notes==
Before starting the quest, Liam says random statements to psyche up the guards:
*{{text|say|I want the perimeter secured and the gates manned by two guards at all times. No one gets in, no one gets out.}}
*{{text|say|We protected Gilneas from the Scourge. We protected Gilneas during the Northgate rebellion. We will protect Gilneas from whatever this new threat may be.}}
*{{text|say|Stand ready, guards! We don't know how many intruders we're dealing with, but the Headlands are overrun and we're cut off from the harbor towns. Expect to be outnumbered.}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Panicked Citizen|What... what are those things on the rooftops?}}

To complete the quest, find the yellow question mark on your minimap north-west of you. Lieutenant Walden is just around two corners near a fence there.
Completing this quest starts phase 2.
