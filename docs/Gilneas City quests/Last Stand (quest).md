==Objectives==
Kill 8 Frenzied Stalkers.
*[[Frenzied Stalker]] slain x8

==Description==
We've got a good chokepoint [[Light's Dawn Cathedral|here]], <name>. Feel free to say a prayer if that's your sort of thing.

Take courage and let's kill [[worgen|these mutts]].

== Rewards ==
You will learn: [[Darkflight]]

You will also receive: {{cost||3}}

==Progress==
We can do this, <name>.

==Completion==
They... they've stopped coming.

No, <name>. That's not a good thing.

==Notes==
* Do '''''not''''' use your [[Hearthstone]] between accepting and completing this quest. Thanks to an oversight, it will teleport you to an area from where you will not be able to come back.
* On completion a cinematic begins. Worgen leap through the chapel's windows and attack, infecting the player in the process. You turn and attack your former comrades, then escape into the woods until you are trapped and captured. Locked into a cage, you are approached by Lord Godfrey:... 
:<narrated by [[Vincent Godfrey|Lord Godfrey]]>:
:{{text|bossemote|Look at what you've become. Those cursed beasts...they've left you nothing more than just another wretched mongrel. Do you even remember what you did to your friends? Your kind...haunting the wilds unchecked...until ''we'' found you. They've kept you alive, because they still believe you can be saved. To which I must ask: Is there even a shred of humanity left within you? Perhaps...we will find out, soon enough.}}
