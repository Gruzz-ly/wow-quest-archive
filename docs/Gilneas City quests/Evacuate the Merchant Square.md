'''Evacuate the Merchant Square''' is a quest that requires you to bring some [[Frightened Citizen|citizens]] of Gilneas to safety from the rampaging Worgen that are pillaging the homes.

==Objectives==
Evacuate 4 Civilian Homes.
*Market Homes Evacuated (4)

==Description==
The [[Frightened Citizen|civilians]] aren't safe here anymore. Not even inside their homes.

We're doing our best to stop the [[worgen]] from getting indoors, but their numbers are too great.

Help us by evacuating the civilian homes. [[Genn Greymane|My father]]'s army in the [[Military District|prison district]] will be able to better protect them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||c=65}}
*220 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Progress==
Have you succeeded, <name>?

==Completion==
Good job, <name>. Thanks to you, many [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilneans]] will live to see another day.

==Notes==
Look for Merchant Square Doors. Open them. A [[Frightened Citizen]] will come out, often followed by a [[Rampaging Worgen]]. Peel off the worgen. The citizens will say any of the following:
*{{text|say|Protect me, please!}}
*{{text|say|It's coming right for me!}}
*{{text|say|What in the world? Let's get out of here!}}
*{{text|say|Help!}}
*{{text|say|Help me, please!}}
*{{text|say|Worgen! Worgen everywhere!}}
*{{text|say|Flee! They're everywhere!}}
