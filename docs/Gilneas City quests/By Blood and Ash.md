==Objectives==
Slay 80 Bloodfang Stalkers using the [[Rebel Cannon]]s.
*[[Bloodfang Stalker (Gilneas)|Bloodfang Stalker]] slain (80)

==Description==
The time has come, <name>. If we're going to put a dent in their numbers, the time is now.

We have the position.

We have the firepower.

All that remains is to be seen is whether we have the courage... and I sure don't see a coward standing in front of me.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Steadfast Greaves
|Steadfast Boots
|Cannoneer's Leggings
}}
You will also receive: {{cost||1}}

==Progress==
We must take out as many of them as we can, <name>.

==Completion==
You've done well, <name>. You've done more than could be asked of any [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilnean]].

We're running low on ammunition. It's time to regroup inside now.

==Notes==
Get on one of the cannons, take aim, and start spamming #1.
