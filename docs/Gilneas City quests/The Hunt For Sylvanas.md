==Objectives==
Follow {{NPC||Tobias Mistmantle}} in the Hunt for Sylvanas.

==Description==
It's true then? [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilneas]] has lost her favorite son.

We will mourn when this is all over but not a day sooner.

We will not allow ourselves the luxury of grief while the enemy still breathes Gilnean air.

{{NPC||Darius Crowley||My father}}'s men are ready to strike while we still have the {{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||Banshee Queen}}'s trail. Just say the word if you're ready. {{NPC||Liam Greymane||Liam}} deserves swift vengeance.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||8}}

==Progress==
Did you find her, <name>?

==Completion==
The Plague? Something so heinous that not even the [[orc]]s condone its use? I'd say this warrants notifying {{NPC||Genn Greymane||King Greymane}}.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Tobias Mistmantle|Let us go at once. We will track Sylvanas down. For Gilneas!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Follow Tobias Mistmantle into the Cathedral District.}}
:''Tobias runs out the front door and around to the canal separating Greymane Court and the Cathedral District.'' ({{co|36.5|54.0|Gilneas City}})
:{{text|say|Tobias Mistmantle|Let's do our best not to be seen, <name>.}}
:''Tobias jumps across the canal then runs to the wall to the northeast to eavesdrop.'' ({{co|40.0|31.0|Gilneas City}})
:{{text|yell|Forsaken General|Make sure everything is ready.  The orcs' emissary is ready to meet Sylvanas inside the Cathedral.}}
:{{text|say|Tobias Mistmantle|Did you hear that, <name>? [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] is headed to the cathedral. Let's hurry!}}
:''Tobias runs into the cathedral and jumps into the water on the south side of the room.'' ({{co|44.6|51.6|Gilneas City}})
:{{text|say|Tobias Mistmantle|Quick! Hide in the water!}}
:''Tobias and the character leap into the water on the southwest side of the cathedral.''
:''Sylvanas, [[High Executor Crenshaw|Crenshaw]] and [[General Warhowl|Warhowl]] all walk into the cathedral.''
:{{text|say|[[General Warhowl]]|It appears as if you're losing control of Gilneas, Sylvanas. {{NPC||Garrosh Hellscream||Garrosh}} fears he's going to have to carry out this invasion himself.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|You can assure Garrosh that this is a minor setback. Our victory in Gilneas will be absolute.}}
:{{text|say|General Warhowl|You sound very confident, your Majesty. I seriously hope you do not plan to use the Plague. Garrosh has explicitly forbidden it.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|You'd do well to watch your tone, General. Neither you nor Garrosh have anything to worry about. We've ceased all production of the Plague, as he ordered. We'd never deploy it without his permission.}}
:{{text|say|General Warhowl|I will deliver my report to our leader, then. By your leave, my lady.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Go with honor, General.}}
:''Warhowl exits the cathedral.''
:{{text|say|[[High Executor Crenshaw]]|My Lady! Should I order my men to stop development of the Plague? Or are we to continue as planned?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|What kind of question is that? Of course we're deploying the Plague as planned! Let the Gilneans enjoy their small victory. Not even their bones will remain by tomorrow.}}
:{{text|say|High Executor Crenshaw|As you wish!}}
:''Sylvanas and Crenshaw exit the cathedral.''

Run back to Lorna.
