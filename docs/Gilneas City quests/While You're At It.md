==Objectives==
Kill 5 Bloodfang Worgen.
*[[Bloodfang Worgen]] slain x5

==Description==
Fine by me if {{NPC||Genn Greymane||King Greymane}} wants you to [[Old Divisions|risk your life]] to rescue a {{NPC||Darius Crowley||known traitor}}.

Do me a favor and do something useful while you're out there and kill these cursed fleabags.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Armstead Bracers
|Merchant's Chestguard
|Armstead Bindings
}}
You will also receive: {{cost|||40}}

==Progress==
What is it then, <name>?

==Completion==
If I hadn't seen you kill a few of the mangy things with my own eyes, I'd think you did not complete the task I asked of you.

It looks like we're hardly putting a dent in their numbers.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lord Godfrey|We ought to leave Crowley in prison with those beasts!}}
:{{text|say|King Genn Greymane|Enough! I've made up my mind. We need Crowley on our side.}}
