For '''All Hell Breaks Loose''', [[Prince Liam Greymane|prince Liam Greymane]] asks you to help killing the worgen in an effort to protect the city and its denizens.

==Objectives==
[[Prince Liam Greymane]] wants you to slay 6 Rampaging Worgen.
*[[Rampaging Worgen]] slain (6)

==Description==
[[Worgen]]! [[Genn Greymane|My father]] had warned me that [[Archmage Arugal|Archmage Arugal]]'s creations had run amok.

But where are they coming from?

I suppose it doesn't matter. Help us make quick work of them. We'll show them what we [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilneans]] are made of!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Wolf Fur Coat]] and {{cost|||c=65}}
*220 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Progress==
Have the worgen been dealt with?

==Completion==
It's no use, <name>! They're not letting up.

==Notes==
The [[Rampaging Worgen]] are all over the [[Merchant Square]] of [[Gilneas City]]. These Worgen hit quite hard, but you will make good use of the fast health regeneration when out of combat, at this level.
You can also do the other two available quests while doing this one: [[Evacuate the Merchant Square]] and [[Salvage the Supplies]].

Prince Liam will yell the following during this quest:
*{{text|yell|Stand your ground men!}}
*{{text|yell|Defeat these foul beasts!}}
*{{text|yell|Protect the Civilians!}}
*{{text|yell|Push them back!}}
*{{text|yell|Take heart men, we must protect our city!}}

==Progression==
{{Gilneas City quests}}

==Patch changes==
