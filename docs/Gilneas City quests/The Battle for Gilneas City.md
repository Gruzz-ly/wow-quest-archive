==Objectives==
Achieve victory in the [[Battle for Gilneas City]].
*Battle for Gilneas City complete
*[[Rapier of the Gilnean Patriots]] (provided)

==Description==
The time has come, <name>. We've rallied and armed every available Gilnean.

It is time to meet the enemy head on. Time to settle the score with [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] and her [[Forsaken]] dogs once and for all.

[[Liam Greymane|Liam]] is heading the assault from this gate. [[Genn Greymane|King Greymane]] and [[Darius Crowley|my father]] are leading the assault on the other districts.

You have a crucial role to play in this as well. Take this rapier. Use it to inspire our men and women in combat. Speak to [[Krennan Aranas]] to take part in the battle for [[Gilneas City]].

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Marshalling Point|Rallying Charge|Gilnean Shield|Cloak of the Clarion Call|Mace of the Blood Price}}
You will also receive: {{cost||13}}

==Progress==
No...

==Completion==
We've driven the Forsaken back. We hold three out of the four districts.

But at what cost...

==Notes==
Being near a leader of the battle, Liam, Genn or Darius, will buff players with "[[Soldier of the Battle for Gilneas City]]", improving morale and restoring 73-74 health a tick.

On accept:
:{{text|yell|Krennan Aranas|It's time to join the fray, <name>! With you on our side the scales will surely tip in our favor!}}

Talk to Krennan:
:The time to take back Gilneas City is at hand.
:{{gossip|''Let us take back our city!''}}

The event starts when the first player talks to Krennan. Like most phased battles (such as [[The Battle For The Undercity (Alliance)]] / [[The Battle For The Undercity (Horde)|(Horde)]], [[Operation: Gnomeregan]], [[Zalazane's Fall]]), Liam gives other players a few minutes to start the quest before he will leave the area to start the fight. Should players accept the quest after the event has already started and the combat has begun, talk to Krennan for a free teleport to the party's location.

:{{text|yell|Prince Liam Greymane|The Forsaken think we're weak. A broken people. They think we'll roll over like a scared dog.}}
:{{text|yell|Prince Liam Greymane|How wrong they are. We will fight them in the fields until the last trench collapses and the last cannon is silenced.}}
:{{text|yell|Prince Liam Greymane|We will fight them on the streets until the last shot is fired. And when there's no more ammunition, we'll crush their skulls with the stones that pave our city.}}
:{{text|yell|Prince Liam Greymane|We will fight them in the alleys, until our knuckles are skinned and bloody and our rapiers lay in the ground shattered.}}
:{{text|yell|Prince Liam Greymane|And if we find ourselves surrounded and disarmed... wounded and without hope... we will lift our heads in defiance and spit in their faces.}}
:{{text|yell|Prince Liam Greymane|But we will... NEVER SURRENDER!!!!!}}
:{{text|yell|Prince Liam Greymane|FOR GILNEAS!!!}}
:''Liam leads the charge over the bridge into the merchant district, swarmed with [[Forsaken Infantry]] and [[Forsaken Crossbowman (Gilneas)|Bowmen]]. Clearing the district will spawn the [[Dark Ranger Elite]]. The party then heads toward the military district.''
:{{text|say|Prince Liam Greymane|Abominations are blocking the way toward the military district! This won't be easy.}}
:''Lorna and the Emberstone villagers roll in some cannons from around the corner.''
:{{text|say|Lorna Crowley|The villagers were thankful to have Emberstone back. They brought us a little something to help against the Forsaken.}}
:{{text|yell|Prince Liam Greymane|You're a sight for sore eyes, Lorna. Let's get those cannons manned. The rest of you, lure the abominations into the open.}}
:''Get in the cannon and blow up the [[abomination]]s. Once the path is cleared, head to the jail.''
:''Lorna says, "There's no way in hell I'm staying out of this fight! Let's Go!
:{{text|yell|Prince Liam Greymane|Crowley's troops are up ahead! Press on!}}
:{{text|yell|Gorerot|Gorerot crush puny worgen!!}}
:''At the jail, Darius Crowley and his worgen run in to meet [[Gorerot]], a [[mutated abomination]] boss with 90,000 health. Hop in the catapults to deal immense damage, but they're on fire and won't last long, so make the shots count.''
:{{text|yell|Lord Darius Crowley|He's too strong! Use the catapults to bring him down!}}
:''Gorerot dies.''
:{{text|yell|Lord Darius Crowley|Let us join your father's force, Liam. They'll need our help against Sylvanas.}}
:''Run to Greymane square, where Sylvanas and some elite [[banshee]]s await. Sylvanas has 27,600 HP.''
:{{text|yell|King Genn Greymane|Block their retreat, Liam! We've got them right where we want them!}}
:{{text|yell|King Genn Greymane|SYLVANAS!!}}
:''Genn heroic leaps at her. Clear the trash around her and the two banshees, then focus on Sylvanas. Once she gets down to 25% health, she'll do a massive knockback and stun everybody (Banshee Queen's Wail).''
:{{text|yell|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Enough!}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Let's see how brave Gilneas gets on without its stubborn leader!}}
:{{text|yell|Prince Liam Greymane|FATHER!!!}}
:''Liam jumps in front of the bowshot, protecting his father from certain doom.''
:{{text|say|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner|Such a waste. That arrow's poison was not meant to be wasted on your whelp. We will meet again!}}
:{{text|yell|King Genn Greymane|LIAM!! NO!!!}}
:''Sylvanas runs off. The stun fades and Genn runs over to Liam, cradling him in his arms.''
:{{text|say|Prince Liam Greymane|We did it, father...}}
:{{text|say|Prince Liam Greymane|We took back our city... we took back...}}
:''Liam dies.''
Head inside the building to the north of the courtyard where the fight took place to find Lorna, in shock.
