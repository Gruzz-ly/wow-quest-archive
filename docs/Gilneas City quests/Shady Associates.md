==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Vitus Darkwalker}} in the [[Military District]].

==Description==
Most of us made it here alive... but there's worgen on this side of the city as well.

We're going to continue heading south once everyone's accounted for.

That reminds me, someone was asking about you. A strange fellow named Vitus... he was really giving me the creeps.

He kept talking about some "forbidden knowledge" he'd uncovered.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||35}}
*170 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Completion==
A darkness has descended over our lands. And not our kind of darkness, if you know what I mean.

==Notes==
Warlocks only.

==Progression==

==Patch changes==
