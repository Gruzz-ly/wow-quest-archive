==Objectives==
Find another Fractured Spark of Omens.
* [[Fractured Spark of Omens]]

==Description==
By the [[titan]]s! Observe this item, <class>.

<Custodian Khubon shows you something resembling a fractured gem.>

This is a fractured spark of omens. In the hands of a skilled crafter, a reagent such as this can be infused into other materials to vastly improve the final product.

However, this is merely a fragment. If you chance upon another in your adventures, bring it to me. I will combine this one with yours and grant you a complete spark of your own.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]
*2x [[Fractured Spark of Omens]]

==Progress==
Ah, <name>. What is the progress of your search for another fractured spark of omens?

==Completion==
Excellent. If you acquire more fractured sparks, you can combine them yourself for use in your own crafting efforts.

==Patch changes==
