==Objectives==
Use the Shabby Arakkoa Disguise to obtain the Adversarial Bloodlines from [[Sahaak]] and return to [[Hazzik]].
*[[Adversarial Bloodlines]]
*[[Shabby Arakkoa Disguise]] (provided)

==Description==
Open the package, <name>. It is a disguise. It doesn't look very convincing, does it?

I craft them for ethereal smugglers in search of rare books. There is an [[arakkoa]] scribe who dwells in the central island in [[Skettis]], Terokk's Rest; his name is [[Sahaak]]. He is old and nearly blind.

Use the disguise to speak with him and obtain the book known as the Adversarial Bloodlines. Be careful, <name>. The disguise won't fool the other arakkoa.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9500 [[XP]] ({{cost|5|70}} at 70)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]

==Progress==
The book, <name>.  Have you obtained it?

==Completion==
Excellent! This book catalogs the descendants of Terokk's ancient enemies. It is prophesied that their demise will be followed by Terokk's return.

==Notes==
A simple matter of don the disguise, walk up to the scribe (at {{co|67|80|Terokkar Forest}}), and talk to him to buy the quest item for {{cost|3}}.  You can sell other stuff to him and he has a random Rank 5 scroll for sale as well.

Sahaak won't attack you even if you don't have the disguise, but he won't sell you the book unless you're wearing it.

[[Anchorite Ahuurn]] of [[Zangarmarsh]] did a better, if more complicated, Arakkoa disguise in the form of [[Ahuurn's Elixir|an elixir]].  {{AlsoSee|[[Messenger to the Feralfen]]}}

==Progression==
