==Objectives==
Obtain [[Hazzik's Package]] at his dwelling in eastern [[Skettis]] and return to him with it.

==Description==
Do not draw attention to our conversation. Adaris would not approve.

I belong to the lowest caste of [[arakkoa]], <name>. During [[Terokk]]'s rule I would've been sacrificed to the dark powers worshipped by his talonpriests. If what you say is true and the talonpriests are seeking Terokk's return, then you must prevent them from succeeding - regardless of what your leader says!

I've something to offer you that you'll find useful. There is a package at my old dwelling in [[Upper Veil Shil'ak]]. Bring it to me!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 6250 [[XP]] ({{cost|3|75}} at 70)
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]

==Progress==
You've returned, <name>. I was beginning to think you'd given up on me.

==Completion==
Excellent, <name>. You will see that I'm true to my word.

==Notes==
Hazzik's Package is located inside a small hut on the ground, at 75,80. There is a timer on the box; if someone has picked it up recently, you may have to wait a few minutes.

==Progression==
{{Terokk's Downfall}}
