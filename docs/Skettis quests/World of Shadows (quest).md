'''World of Shadows''' introduces the player to the time-lost plateau of Skettis.  Once completed, the quest [[More Shadow Dust]] is available to obtain more
[[Elixir of Shadows]].

This quest enables [[Secrets of the Talonpriests]].

[[Elixir of Shadows]] is needed to acquire items for several other quests.

==Objectives==
[[Severin]] wants you to venture into [[Skettis]] and retrieve 6 [[Shadow Dust (Outland)]] from the [[arakkoa]] that dwell there.

==Description==
[[Sky Commander Adaris]] was seriously injured during a [[Skettis]] incursion. He's been in and out of consciousness since.

I fear he has succumbed to a feverish delirium. During brief lucid moments he demands that I prepare an elixir made from shadow dust carried by the arakkoa. He seems to believe it will allow him to see into a "world of shadows" where the arakkoa's true leaders dwell.

I do not believe this nonsense for a second, but I fear he won't rest until I obtain such an elixir. Will you help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|99}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]
*[[Elixir of Shadows]]

==Progress==
Have you obtained the dust, <name>?

==Completion==
I thank you, <name>. I will administer a small amount to the commander... to humor him. You can keep the rest, perhaps you'll find a use for it.

==Notes==
The Shadow Dust drops about 20% of the time from Wing Guards, about 27% of the time from Talonites and Windwalkers, and 32% of the time from Soulcallers.

On completion:
:{{text|say|Sky Commander Adaris|The elixir... give it to me, Severin!}}
:Adaris stands up.
:{{text|say|Sky Commander Adaris|I see them now... assassins from Skettis!}}
:Adaris runs forward and swinging his polearm, kills something invisible. A [[Skettis Assassin]] appears out of nowhere as it dies and falls dead to the ground.
:{{text|yell|Severin|Adaris!}}
:Adaris kills a second assassin, which also falls dead.
:{{text|say|Sky Commander Adaris|The arakkoa can send all the assassins they have... they will meet the same fate as these!}}
:Adaris returns to his spot and sits down again.
