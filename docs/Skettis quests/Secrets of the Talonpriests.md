[[Elixir of Shadows]] is needed to interact with the Talonpriests for this quest, although not for credit for kills.

[[Talonpriest Ishaal]], one of the assassination targets for this mission, drops a book that starts another quest: [[Ishaal's Almanac]].

==Objectives==
Obtain an [[Elixir of Shadows]] from [[Severin]] and use it to find and slay Talonpriest Ishaal, Talonpriest Skizzik and Talonpriest Zellek in [[Skettis]]. Return to [[Sky Commander Adaris|Commander Adaris]] after completing this task.
* [[Talonpriest Ishaal]] slain
* [[Talonpriest Skizzik]] slain
* [[Talonpriest Zellek]] slain

==Description==
Thank you for paying heed to my fevered rants. All along we had been trying to identify and destroy the Skettis chain of command; we had learned of three clerics known as the talonpriests, but we'd never seen them with our own two eyes. Now we know why.

Talk to Severin to obtain more of the elixir he discovered. Use the elixir to find and kill the three talonpriests: Ishaal, Skizzik and Zellek. They're rumored to dwell in [[Veil Ala'rak]], near the eastern shore of [[Blackwind Lake]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]

==Progress==
Is the deed done, <name>? I'd kill those blasted birdmen myself if it weren't for my injuries.

==Completion==
You've done well, <name>. You've dealt a tremendous blow to the enemy by slaying the talonpriests.

==Notes==
When preparing to attack the Talonpriests on the platforms, you will want to kill any Monsterous Kaliri that are nearby, as well as the live arakkoa on the platform, before making use of the Elixir.  The bridges have fewer time-lost on them, but are more subject to bird attacks.  Forewarned is forearmed.

In general...  do not be directly on the tree-house platform when taking the [[Elixir of Shadows]].  Even if you have cleared all the living mobs from the platform, when you take the elixir, you suddenly be exposed to all the time-lost mobs.  Fewer of the time-lost are on the bridges, so that is a much better place to take the elixir when preparing to attack.

You need to be under the influence of the [[Elixir of Shadows]] in order to see and interact with the Talonpriests. The elixir persists through death.

However, if you are in a group with someone killing the Talonpriests, you need not have the elixir effect on you in order to get credit for the kill... but you will be unable to affect the Talonpriest itself.  (You can still heal and buff your party, though, so you won't be entirely useless.)

[[Talonpriest Ishaal]] drops a book, [[Ishaal's Almanac]], that starts the [[Ishaal's Almanac (quest)|quest of the same name]].

Save any [[Time-Lost Scroll]]s you find; you will need them later.
