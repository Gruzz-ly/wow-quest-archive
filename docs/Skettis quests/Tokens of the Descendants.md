'''Tokens of the Descendants''' is the repeatable version of [[Adversarial Blood]]. This quest allows a player to get more [[Time-Lost Offering]]s to summon and defeat [[Terokk]] for [[Terokk's Downfall]].

== Objectives ==
Collect Time-Lost Scrolls from the time-lost arakkoa in Skettis and bring them to a Skull Pile inside a summoning circle in Skettis. Summon and defeat the descendants of Terokk's adversaries and return to Hakkiz with Akkarai's Talon, Garokk's Spine, Vekkaz's Scale and Gezzarak's Claw.
* [[Akkarai's Talons]]
* [[Karrog's Spine]]
* [[Gezzarak's Claws]]
* [[Vakkiz's Scale]]

== Description ==
I require a token from each of the descendants of [[Terokk]]'s greatest adversaries. Only then will we be ready to summon Terokk.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
* [[Time-Lost Offering]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]

== Completion ==
Excellent! Take this. I've prepared this bundle with the items you obtained. They will allow you to summon Terokk.

Beware, <name>. He is the most powerful [[arakkoa]] to ever exist. Do not underestimate him!

== Notes ==
If you keep the tokens dropped during Adversarial Blood, you can turn them in after finishing that quest right away, essentially gaining a 'free' offering.

==Progression==
{{Terokk's Downfall}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 2.4.0|note=Tokens now only used for Tokens of the Descendants, and not Adversarial Blood.}}
*{{Patch 2.1.0|note=Added.}}
