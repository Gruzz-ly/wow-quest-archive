The first quest in a series, starting from [[Ishaal's Almanac]] which is dropped by [[Talonpriest Ishaal]].

== Objectives ==
Bring [[Ishaal's Almanac]] to [[Sky Commander Adaris]] north of [[Skettis]].

== Description ==
This mysterious tome was on [[Talonpriest Ishaal]]'s body. It contains arcane symbols and charts of celestial bodies beyond your comprehension.

All writing is in a language you don't understand; likely an ancient version of the [[arakkoa]] written tongue. Perhaps you should bring this to [[Sky Commander Adaris]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]

== Completion ==
What have you brought to me? I can't make out the writing on this tome, <name>... my loss of blood... must've blurred my vision.

== Notes ==
You must have completed the [[World of Shadows]] quest and have the [[Elixir of Shadows]] buff active to be able to see the talonpriest. [[Talonpriest Ishaal]] is located at 69,77 on one of the platformed buildings.

==Progression==
{{Terokk's Downfall}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.1.0|note=Added.}}
