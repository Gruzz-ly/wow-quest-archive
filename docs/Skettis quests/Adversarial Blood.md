... in which you summon four of the descendants of Terokk's enemies and slay them.

==Objectives==
Find the Skull Piles in the middle of the summoning circles of [[Skettis]]. Summon and defeat each of the descendants by using 10 [[Time-Lost Scroll]]s at the Skull Pile. Return to [[Hazzik]] at [[Blackwind Landing]].
* [[Darkscreecher Akkarai]] slain
* [[Karrog]] slain
* [[Gezzarak the Huntress]] slain
* [[Vakkiz the Windrager]] slain

==Description==
The descendants held prisoner by the [[Skettis]] talonpriests are listed in this book: [[Gezzarak the Huntress]], [[Karrog|Karrog the crystal giant]], the [[heretic]] known as [[Darkscreecher Akkarai]] and [[Vakkiz the Windrager]]. They will all need to be slain before [[Terokk]] returns to this world.

You will need the scrolls carried by the time-lost arakkoa to call them forth at the summoning circles in Skettis. These are powerful beings you will be facing; you would do well to bring friends.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|48}} at 70
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]
* [[Time-Lost Offering]]
* +100 rep for each descendant killed, for an additional total of +400 Sha'tari Skyguard reputation

==Progress==
Have you completed your task, <name>?

==Completion==
Excellent! Take this. I've prepared this bundle with items symbolizing the foes you've defeated. They will allow you to summon [[Terokk]].

Beware, <name>. He is the most powerful arakkoa to ever exist. Do not underestimate him!

==Notes==
For each of the 4 summonings:
* You will need 10 [[Time-Lost Scroll]]s.
* Every member of the party receives credit for the kill.

Any skull pile, except for the ancient skull pile, will allow you to summon any one of the 4 mini-bosses.  (You are given a choice of which to summon.)  You will need to wait for the skulls to reset before summoning another at that circle.

This quest was changed in [[patch 2.4]], though no mention was made in the patch notes.  The change removed the requirement to loot trophy tokens from each of the four mini-bosses, and replaced it with a kill requirement instead.  This allows all members of the party to gain credit for the quest with a single summon of each boss.  The change is especially beneficial because it allows a party to gain five [[Time-Lost Offering|time-lost offerings]] (and by extension, five chances to summon and kill [[Terokk]]) from a single collection of 40 scrolls.  However, this change also means it is no longer possible to gather the offerings via auction or other means of trade as a shortcut to completing the quest.

The use of the trophy tokens was recycled into a repeatable quest, [[Tokens of the Descendants]], which allows a player to get more [[Time-Lost Offering]]s as needed.  If you keep the tokens from this quest, you can essentially get a 'free' offering.

On a final note, if you still have the pre-patch version of the quest in your log, you will need to abandon it and return to [[Hazzik]] to pick up the new version.
