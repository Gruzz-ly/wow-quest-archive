==Objectives==
Return to [[Sky Commander Adaris]] with the news about [[Terokk]]'s return.

==Description==
This almanac presages the return of Terokk, the most powerful and terrible [[Skettis]] king in [[arakkoa]] history.

I always believed this to be the mere legend, <name>. The return of the talonpriests and your recovery of this tome indicate otherwise.

With each day, Terokk comes closer to returning to full strength. Your only chance is to bring him to our world prematurely. Return to Skettis and speak to Adaris about this. Let us hope he has the wisdom to do the right thing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 6250 [[XP]] ({{cost|3|75}} at 70)
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]

==Completion==
The arakkoa seek to bring Terokk back beyond the veil of time and Rilak... wants to find a way to accelerate the process? Is he out of his mind?

<Adaris lays back down as his strength fades.>

You've done your duty, <name>. It is time you let my men take over from here. This has become a purely military matter.

==Progression==
