==Objectives==
Take the Explosives Package to [[Sky Sergeant Doryn]] at [[Blackwind Landing]] outside [[Skettis]].
*[[Explosives Package]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Barrier Hills]] are only one of the fronts where we've been deployed. A less immediate but far more dangerous threat looms from beyond the [[Skethyl Mountains]], from within the [[arakkoa]] city of [[Skettis]].

A few months ago our scouts detected a huge increase in arakkoa activity there. Several attacks against [[Shattrath]] followed. We've stationed forces outside of their city since.

Take these explosives to [[Sky Sergeant Doryn|Sergeant Doryn]] at [[Blackwind Landing]], just outside [[Skettis]]. Tell him you're a new recruit.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]

==Progress==
You've something for me, <lad/lass>?

==Completion==
Thanks for the supplies; we'll put them to good use! A new recruit? Well, let's see what you're made of.

==Notes==
This quest enables the character to take the daily repeatable quest [[Fires Over Skettis]], and several other quests at Skettis.

Blackwing Landing is at (64, 66) in Terokkar Forest.
