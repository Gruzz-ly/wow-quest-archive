==Description==
Hail, <name>. I thank you for coming to my aid.

Let's get out of here, while we can.

*{{Cost|9|10}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]

==Progress==
Yes, <name>?

The {{NPC||Skyguard Prisoner}} is a [[broken]] locked in a cage in one of three veils in [[Skettis]], each with a similar layout. Once you release him from the cage, he starts walking slowly towards a bridge.  He crosses the bridge to the other platform, and then heads down the ramp to the ground. That's it, that's the whole quest. You can expect to see 1-2 mobs at the start, a patroller on the bridge, 1-2 mobs on the second platform, and 2 at the bottom of the ramp. Those can be cleared before starting the quest. While halfway down the ramp, 2 more will spawn out of thin air and attack.

One strategy that works well is to check the General channel for others looking for the quest and form a party of at least three. Then have one person camp the each of the three spots where he might appear. When he does appear, everyone comes to that location and triggers the quest. This way is very easy since three people can easily handle the mobs and patrols, and every one gets credit for the quest rather than competing for the same mob.

At some point during the escort, a pair of [[Skettis Wing Guard]]s will spawn and attack the prisoner regardless if the route has been cleared or not. Each pair spawns at a static point depending on which prisoner you are escorting:

*{{Raidicon|Star}} Spawns on the second treehouse at midway between the connecting bridge and the downwards ramp while the Skyguard Prisoner nears the end of the bridge.
*{{Raidicon|Cross}} Spawns at the end of the connecting bridge while the Skyguard Prisoner is at the center of the bridge.
*{{Raidicon|Circle}} Spawns midway up the exit ramp while the Skyguard Prisoner is near the top.

With this in mind, it's possible to prepare for the spawns, usually by setting traps.
