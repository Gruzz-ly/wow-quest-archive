'''Terokk's Downfall''' is the final quest in a long quest chain to destroy [[Terokk]], the god of [[Skettis]].

==Objectives==
Take the [[Time-Lost Offering]] prepared by [[Hazzik]] to the Skull Pile at the center of [[Skettis]] and summon and defeat [[Terokk]]. Return to [[Sky Commander Adaris]] when you've completed this task.
* Terokk slain

==Description==
I... I've turned a blind eye to your dealings with the arakkoa prisoner, <name>. It looks like your instincts to cooperate with him were right.

You must understand... I would've faced a mutiny in my current state if I endorsed your efforts to bring Terokk to this world.

Take the items that Hazzik prepared for you and go ahead with your plan. I will command my men to back you up when the time comes. I recommend that you bring a force of your own as well. I fear you'll only get one chance at this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|13|20}}
* +1000 [[reputation]] with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]

==Progress==
Is it done, <name>? Has Terokk been defeated?

==Completion==
You've made us all very proud, <name>. I'll send word of your deeds back to Shattrath. The Skyguard will be forever in your debt.

==Notes==
Terokk is summoned at the skull pile on [[Terokk's Rest]], the island in [[Blackwind Lake]] in the center of [[Skettis]].

The precursor to this quest, [[Adversarial Blood]], gives you a [[Time-Lost Offering]], required to complete this quest.  You can repeat [[Adversarial Blood]], allowing you to attempt this quest again if you fail, or simply work to gain additional Skyguard reputation.
