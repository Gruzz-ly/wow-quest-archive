==Objectives==
Speak with [[Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth]] and travel to [[Vol'dun]].
* Speak with Jes-Tereth to sail to Vol'dun

==Description==
Reconnaissance reports that the [[Horde]] has made inroads into the desert of Vol'dun.

We can't allow the Horde to continue to work there unchecked, so we're preparing an expedition to establish a beachhead.

<name>, as one of our most accomplished soldiers I'd appreciate if you joined us. Your help will be essential for the success of our mission.

Wrap up your affairs here in the harbor and report to Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth. We will set sail when you're ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I hope the trip didn't make you seasick, <name>. Our mission is only just getting started.

==Notes==
Speak with Jes-Tereth:
{{Dialogue|
This ship is yours to command, <name>. I have the crew prepared for any eventuality.
