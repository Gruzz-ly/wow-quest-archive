==Objectives==
Administer the Antivenom to [[Serrik]].
* Restorative Balm applied
*[[Antivenom]] (provided)

==Description==
The salve is ready.

I work fast. Hopefully faster than the [[scorpid]] poison.

Take this antivenom to your friend and see that he swallows every last drop.

You should know within moments if it's been effective.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|9|70}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
Thank you for saving my life. I'm afraid we don't have time for formal introductions.

==Notes==
Upon using the Antivenom on Serrik, he is instantly healed to full health and rises to a standing position.
