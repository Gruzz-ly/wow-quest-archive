==Objectives==
Use Vorrik's Staff to drain power from 6 [[Faithless]] Suppression Spires.
* [[Suppression Spire]] drained (6)
* [[Vorrik's Staff]] (provided)

==Description==
May I entrust you with my staff, <name>? I do not offer this lightly, so do not accept it lightly either.

We will need every advantage when we face [[Emperor Korthek]], and I've identified an opportunity to increase the power at our disposal.

The Faithless maintain a series of suppression spires on the ridge above us to subjugate the [[pterrordax]]. My staff can drain power from the spires to bolster its own potency.

Meanwhile, I will recruit a much-needed ally for the next stage of our mission.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Do not lose my staff, <name>. It was given to me by [[Sethraliss]] herself.

==Completion==
<Vorrik smiles as he takes the staff back from you.>

Thank you, <name>. I must confess I was anxious for your return. It's been many years since this staff has left my side.

My trust in you was well placed, however. The staff is practically rippling with power.

==Notes and trivia==
Pick up [[Don't Drop It... Yet]] before leaving. Upon accepting both:
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|Take my staff, and charge it by draining power from the Faithless' suppression spires.}}
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|I will travel to the top of the mountain and ensure that [[Rakjan the Unbroken|Rakjan]] has not forgotten me after all these years.}}

Head out of [[Vorrik's Sanctum]] and up onto the [[Crackling Ridge]], where you'll find the spires. Upon finishing your objectives, find Vorrik and Rakjan the Unbroken at [[Rakjan's Peak]] at the top of the ridge.
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|I can tell that age has only sharpened your ferocity and wisdom, Rakjan. We will punish these Faithless for how they have treated you and your kin.}}

You can also pick up [[Forced Grounding]] from the nearby [[Faithless Trapper's Spear]].
