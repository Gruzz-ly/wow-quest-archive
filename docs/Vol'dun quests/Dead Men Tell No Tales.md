==Objectives==
Kill the remaining members of Randall's expedition party.
*[[Gunner Erikson]] slain
*[[Boatswain Hendricks]] slain
*[[First Mate Perry]] slain

==Description==
I'm an employee of the [[Ashvane Trading Company]]. We're number one in the [[:Azerite]] trade.

When I took the job, no one told me it would be a one-way trip!

I'd do just about anything to escape these dunes, including working with you.

Maybe we can help each other out?

I'd be willing to part with the code to [[Captain Hartford|the captain]]'s [[Captain Hartford's lockbox|lockbox]], if you're willing to help me escape this [[Vol'dun|wretched desert]].

For my plan to succeed, my expedition party needs to die. Can't have them telling anyone I'm missing...

==Progress==
It's every man for himself out here.

==Completion==
So it's done then? I never really liked Hendricks, anyway.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both Dead Men Tell No Tales and [[Seafaring Necessities]], Randall runs off to the south:
