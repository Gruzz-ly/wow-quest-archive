==Objectives==
Slay 6 Jungleweb Crawlers and 30 Jungleweb Hatchlings.
*[[Jungleweb Crawler]] slain (6)
*[[Jungleweb Hatchling|Hatchlings]] squished (30)

==Description==
The walls of [[Temple of Kimbul|the temple]] could provide us with vital protection against the [[naga]], but the temple is overrun with jungle [[spider]]s.

We'll need to clear out the infestation before [[Tortaka tribe|the tribe]] can take refuge at the temple.

Venture into the lower ruins and lay waste to the spiders that have nested there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Has the infestation been taken care of?

==Completion==
Now that the spider infestation has been removed, we can safely relocate the rest of our tribe to the temple. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[All Webbed Up]] and [[Blessing of Kimbul]] before heading out. Jungleweb Crawlers and Jungleweb Hatchlings are found all over the [[Terrace of the Fang]]. While Crawlers have to be killed manually, Hatchlings can be killed simply by running over them. The [[Jungleweb Hunter]] [[vignette]] also counts as a Jungleweb Crawler for the purposes of this objective.

==Progression==
{{Tortaka Refuge}}
