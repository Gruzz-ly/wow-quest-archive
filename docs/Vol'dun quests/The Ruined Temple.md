==Objectives==
Speak with [[Teekcha]].

==Description==
The [[loa]] may be our only hope against the [[naga]], but the [[Temple of Kimbul|temple]] lies abandoned and broken.

Two of [[Tortaka tribe|my tribe]] have gone ahead to scout the ruins. They may be able to help you make contact with [[Kimbul|Eraka no Kimbul]].

If the spirit of the loa remains at the temple, we must find a way for him to hear our plight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|1|94}}
*1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I am afraid that we haven't had much success contacting the loa. The entrance to the temple is sealed and the rest of the ruins are overrun with jungle [[spider]]s.

==Progression==
{{Tortaka Refuge}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
