==Objectives==
Meet Vorrik at [[Bwoljin's Fall]].

==Description==
[[Emperor Korthek|Korthek]] has grown spiteful and arrogant over the years, but I realize now that he has grown mad as well.

[[Mythrax]] will kill all of us if he is released.

For too long, I've held out hope that I could convince Korthek peacefully to abandon his heresy. I was wrong.

All of [[Zandalar]] is at risk while Korthek and his allies hold even one key to [[Atul'Aman|Mythrax's prison]].

Meet me outside his fortress in the north. We will confront my old friend "Emperor" Korthek and end this together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|9|70}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
We are surrounded by [[Faithless]] out here, <name>. We must move quickly.

==Notes==
On accept, Vorrik turns to [[Bladeguard Kaja]] and [[Warguard Rakera]]:
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|Korthek has gone too far. I must deal with this personally. Protect the keys while I am away.}}
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|We will defend your people as our own.}}
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|Meet me at Bwoljin's Fall as soon as you can, <name>. We shall sneak into Korthek's fortress together.}}

Vorrik runs out the door, mounts his [[pterrordax]], sets out north, and disappears. Travel northeast to find him mounted on a [[krolusk]] at {{Coords|42.8|35.8|Vol'dun}}. On the way to Bwoljin's Fall, you'll likely pass through the [[Forward Camp]], where [[Izarn]] and [[Seriah]] offer side quests to deal with the Faithless at the [[Temple Incursion]].

==Progression==
{{Storming the Spire}}
