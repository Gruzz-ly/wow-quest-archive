==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|Everybody get ready. Our first guest of the day. Dis is so exciting! Don't kill dem!}}
:{{Text|yell|Bladeguard Tarkaj|Hello? Is anyone dere?}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Tarkaj|Please, I'm injured... Have mercy on a fellow [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Tarkaj|<Name>...?}}

Head outside the inn to find none other than Bladeguard Tarkaj, the companion of [[Bladeguard Kaja]] who went missing at the start of the main [[Vol'dun storyline]], lying injured on the sand. Interact with him to resuscitate him and get him back on his feet:
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Tarkaj|What you doing out here, <name>? I thought you were dead!}}

When talked to, he has the following to say:
:The [[sethrak]] have been chasing me for days. These dunes are death.
:I thought you were killed [[Into the Dunes|when we crashed]]... Did anyone else survive?

Lead Tarkaj into the inn and interact with the various objects around the cave to help him recover.

Interact with [[Oasis Water]] to offer water:
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Tarkaj|My first drink in Vol'dun. I've been lost in da dunes since we were attacked!}}

Use the [[Box of Slightly Used Bandages]] to offer bandages:
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Tarkaj|Da [[Faithless]] chased me across da desert, through wild beasts and monsters. I barely survived.}}

Interact with [[Sandy Tortillas]] to offer food:
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Tarkaj|You helped dese exiles set up an inn way out here in da middle of nowhere?}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Tarkaj|I'd say you're crazy, but you just saved my life. So, thanks.}}

Finally, interact with the [[Very Uncomfortable Bed]] to allow Tarkaj to rest:
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Tarkaj|I can't believe I found you again, <name>. But I'm exhausted...}}
:''Tarkaj lies down.''
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Tarkaj|Think I might stay here awhile. Help out where I can.}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Tarkaj|Thanks for saving me...}}
:''Tarkaj falls asleep.''

Speak to Rhan'ka to turn in. On completion, Rhan'ka becomes an [[innkeeper]], allowing the player to bind their [[Hearthstone]] to the inn. Similarly, [[Grenja]] becomes a repair vendor and [[Man'zul]] becomes a [[stable master]].
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|De Goldtusk Inn is officially open for business!}}
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|Ya always welcome here, <name>. Ya a member of de Goldtusk Gang for life.}}

This concludes the Goldtusk Inn questline. Rhan'ka offers [[Ruins-Level Marketing]], a breadcrumb quest to the [[Court of Zak'rajan]].
