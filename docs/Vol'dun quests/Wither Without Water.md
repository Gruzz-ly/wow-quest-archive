==Objectives==
Use [[Ranah's Watering Can]] to water 10 Withered Thistlevines.
* [[Withered Thistlevine]]s watered (10)

==Description==
The flora in this area weren't always so aggressive.

Without water, the thistlevines wither and waste until they become something unrecognizable and angry.

Take my watering can and wet the withering thistlevines to prevent them from becoming carnivorous.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
These poor plants will wither away without water.

==Completion==
Look how happy those plants are! You made that happen.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Let it Flow]] and [[We Can Salvage the Seeds]] before embarking. Use the watering can on [[Withered Thistlevine]]s across the terrace to restore them.

==Progression==
