==Notes==
Talk to Meerah to embark on the journey.
:[[Dolly]] and [[Dot (alpaca)|Dot]] are strong and dependable. They'll get us where we need to go.
:{{Gossip|We're ready to leave.}}

The caravan sets off to the southwest, with Meerah and Kaja in the front seat of the wagon and the player in the back seat.
:{{Text|say|[[Kiro]]|Be safe, Meerah. Our wagons don't always do well on the ancient troll roads.}}
:{{Text|yell|Meerah|I always am!}}
:{{Text|say|Meerah|Kiro's got no reason to worry. I've had plenty of practice! But you might want to hold on, just in case.}}
:{{Text|say|Meerah|You keep an eye out for your friend. I'll keep my eyes on the road.}}
:{{Text|say|Meerah|[[Port of Zem'lan|Zem'lan's port]] is to the south. Ships haven't sailed into its dockyard for years, but it's still our best chance at getting what Kiro and [[Nisha]] need for their attack on the [[sethrak]].}}
:{{Text|say|Meerah|Can you believe this wasteland was once the jewel of the troll empire? A jungle teeming with life... now whatever's left is buried beneath the sands.}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|How could Rakera survive in such a place?}}
:{{Text|say|Meerah|I doubt she could. Most of your kind can't. Well, not anymore.}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|I will find her, or die trying.}}

At the [[Withering Gulch]], something catches Kaja's attention:
:{{Text|yell|Bladeguard Kaja|Meerah, stop de caravan! I see something up ahead!}}

The caravan disembarks. Kaja runs over to [[Jorak]], who is kneeling next to a wagon surrounded by dead [[Zandalari Exile]]s.
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|Dis is Rakera's shield... Where is she? What have you done to her?}}
:''Kaja picks up and equips the shield.''
:{{Text|yell|Jorak|[[General Jakra'zet|Jakra'zet]]'s to blame for dis, not me. Rakera's de only reason I'm still alive.}}

Talk to Jorak to turn in the quest.
