==Objectives==
Help Ranah determine the cause of the malfunctioning fountain within the [[Withering Gulch|Withering Terrace]]{{sic}}.
* Reservoir inspected
* [[Colossal Water Cobra]] slain

==Description==
I checked my work twice when working on this fountain. I made no mistakes.

There must be something wrong at the source.

The fountain draws water from a modest reservoir above the terrace.

Would you mind checking it out?

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Scorching Sands Grips
|Exiled Veteran's Handguards
|Lastwind Grips
|Resilient Outcast's Gloves
|Deserted Divining Rod
|Scorched Plateau Defender
}}

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
There's no good reason why this fountain should be malfunctioning.

==Completion==
Well then, snakes! That explains it. I'm glad you cleared up that clog. The gulch looks greener already!

==Notes==
Head south from Ranah's position, then turn east and finally north up the cliffs to the [[Verdant Plateau]], where a [[Loose Boulder]] is lying in a shallow pool of water. Upon interacting with the boulder to move it, a [[Colossal Water Cobra]] bursts out of the ground! Avoid its frontal Frost Breath attacks and kill it, then return to Ranah below, where the fountain is now functioning properly and large amounts of vegetation have sprung up around it.

Upon completion:
:{{Text|say|Ranah|Looks like our work here is done! Be safe out there, <name>.}}

Ranah walks over to her [[Ranah's Mount|hyena mount]] and mounts it before riding a short distance west and despawning.

==Progression==
{{Ranah's Wrench}}
