==Objectives==
Collect 6 Volatile Lightning Bombs from [[Faithless]].
* [[Volatile Lightning Bomb]] (6)

==Description==
The Faithless are training [[pterrordax]]es as mounts so that they can rain down death from the skies.

Their [[skycaller]]s have developed a means of storing volatile lightning magic into fragile crystals. Lightning bombs, in the simplest sense. The magic behind it is quite brilliant, really.

The bombs will be exceptionally useful if we can secure the aid of [[Rakjan the Unbroken|Rakjan]], the powerful and fierce pterrordax at the top of this mountain.

Acquire as many as you can carry, while I will do my best to recruit Rakjan.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
There are{{sic}} no end to the Faithless, so grab as many as you can carry.

==Completion==
Excellent! Rakjan appears willing to aid us, so we will certainly make good use of these.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Diplomacy and Dominance]] before leaving. Upon accepting both:
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|Take my staff, and charge it by draining power from the Faithless' suppression spires.}}
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|I will travel to the top of the mountain and ensure that Rakjan has not forgotten me after all these years.}}

Head out of [[Vorrik's Sanctum]] and up onto the [[Crackling Ridge]]. Volatile Lightning Bombs can drop from any of the Faithless mobs in the area. Upon finishing your objectives, find Vorrik and Rakjan the Unbroken at [[Rakjan's Peak]] at the top of the ridge.
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|I can tell that age has only sharpened your ferocity and wisdom, Rakjan. We will punish these Faithless for how they have treated you and your kin.}}

You can also pick up [[Forced Grounding]] from the nearby [[Faithless Trapper's Spear]].

==Progression==
{{Storming the Spire}}
