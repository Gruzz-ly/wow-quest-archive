==Objectives==
Harvest 8 Prickly Pear Roots in [[Bonetrail Gulch]].
* [[Prickly Pear Root]] (8)

==Description==
I was shadowing those [[sethrak]] when I saw [[Vorrik|this one]] left for dead beside the trail. I don't think he's like the others. Looks like they roughed him up pretty bad.

I made contact and before he passed out he said he knew where [[Private James|our man]] was being taken!

We need to find out what this thing knows!

I'll need to make a salve for these wounds. There's some cactus I saw growing around here that should make a good base for it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Got the cactus for the salve?

==Completion==
Those will do the trick!

==Progression==
