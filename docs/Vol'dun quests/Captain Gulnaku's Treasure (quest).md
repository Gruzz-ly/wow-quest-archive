==Objectives==
Search for [[Captain Gulnaku]]'s treasure chest.
*Buried treasure found
*[[Captain Gulnaku's Key]]
*Open Captain Gulnaku's treasure chest.

==Description==
<This map is poorly drawn and covered in stains, but appears to identify three possible locations where a pirate captain may have buried treasure around the [[Port of Zem'lan]]. The treasure could be at any of the three locations.

At the bottom of the map, someone scrawled an order: Set traps!>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Captain Gulnaku's Treasure]]
*{{Cost|38|80}}
*20,560 [[XP]]
*+150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
<It's firmly locked. You'll need the captain's key to open this.>

==Completion==
<The chest is filled with shiny treasure.>

==Notes==
The three locations around the Port of Zem'lan indicated by the quest consists of a pile of [[Freshly Dug Sand]] at {{Coords|35|81.6|Vol'dun}} (which is dug at by a [[Shackled Beetle]] and contains the {{rep|hostile}} skeleton [[Zenanju]]), a pile of Freshly Dug Sand next to some [[Slaughtered Vulpera]] at {{Coords|34.4|76.4|Vol'dun}} (which is guarded by [[Captain Zhonga]] and [[First Mate Kiffa]] and contains a [[Broken Bottle (item)]]) and [[Captain Gulnaku's Treasure (object)|Captain Gulnaku's Treasure]] at {{Coords|31.6|79.2|Vol'dun}}. The latter is the only object that is necessary for the quest. The chest is guarded by the namesake [[Captain Gulnaku]], who drops [[Captain Gulnaku's Key]], allowing the player to interact with the chest and complete the quest.

==Progression==
{{Port of Zem'lan}}
