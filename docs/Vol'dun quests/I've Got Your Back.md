On accept:
:{{Text|say|Razgaji|We'll proceed when you're ready.}}

Talk to Razgaji:
:[[Vol'dun]] may be a treacherous wasteland, but it's da only home I've got.
:{{Gossip|I'm ready. Let's go.}}

Razgaji walks down into the [[Scorched Sands Arena]], where Mojambo is now waiting with a group of four [[Zandalari Exile]]s.
:{{Text|say|Razgaji|Be on your guard. Mojambo can't be trusted...}}

Razgaji stops a short distance in front of Mojambo.
:{{Text|say|Mojambo|Well, if it isn't Razgaji! I told you we'd find him here...}}
:{{Text|say|Mojambo|You weren't hiding from your old friends were you?{{sic}}}}
:{{Text|say|Zandalari Exile|Hehehe...}}
:{{Text|say|Razgaji|I'm done Mojambo.{{sic}} I be tired of killing and stealing to survive. I'll be going my own way now...}}
:{{Text|say|Mojambo|Done? I be de one that decides when you're done! You know what happens to deserters!}}
:{{Text|say|Razgaji|I'm not going back wit' you. Do you really think your petty thugs can handle my friend here? Don't start a fight you can't win.}}
:{{Text|say|Zandalari Exile|I can take de <race>, boss! No problem!}}
:{{Text|say|Mojambo|No! We gonna let him have it his way. We'll leave for now... but when we come back we won't be so generous!}}
:{{Text|say|Mojambo|Enjoy your last day alive Razgaji.{{sic}} De next we meet... it gonna be your last!}}

Mojambo and his exiles turn around and walk out of the arena to the north, while Razgaji heads back to the southern edge of the arena.
