==Objectives==
Capture [[Shatterstone Harbor]].
* [[Landing Craft (Vol'dun)|Landing craft]] boarded
* [[Sethrak]] forces slain (15)

==Description==
We're going to need a [[harbor]] for our base of operations. Those ruins across the way should be perfect for our needs.

Unfortunately, it looks to be occupied by a hostile force so I'm sending the [[marine]]s to secure the shore. As the most experienced [[soldier]] here I want you to go with them.

I don't want to see a single hostile remain when our [[engineer]]s arrive.

Now, go take that harbor in the name of the [[Alliance]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank the Light you came with us! [[Private Leonard]] didn't make it and [[Private James]] got captured by those damn [[snake]]-men! 

The important thing is I think the rest of 'em got scared off once you started raining death down on 'em.

Small victories, right?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Take one of the ropes down to the landing craft, <name>. And good luck.}}
:''Umbric ports in.''
:{{text|say|[[Magister Umbric]]|I'm here as you requested, Wyrmbane.}}
:{{text|say|Magister Umbric|A desert? How... quaint.}}

Interact with the [[Rope Coil]] to hop on a landing craft:
:{{text|say|[[Sergeant Ermey]]|Alright marines, listen up! When we hit the beach I want <name> to take point. Use that pretty little flare gun to light up anything that moves.}}
:{{text|say|Sergeant Ermey|The rest of you follow me, we're going to maneuver around their flank.}}
:{{text|yell|Sergeant Ermey|GO! GO! GO!}}
:{{text|yell|Private James|For the Alliance!}}

As Ermey mentioned, players have a bonus ability:
*{{Abilities|Flare Gun|range=20|Marks the designated area for an artillery strike.|cd=6 sec|notes=Instant|id=268951|icon=inv_musket_04}}

Round up a few enemies, then target the ground beneath them. There's a few seconds of travel time so make sure to keep the sethrak in the targeted area before they get utterly obliterated by the Cannon Blasts. Eligible mobs are [[Sethrak Battle Rider]]s, [[Sethrak Mender]]s, [[Krolusk Packbeast]]s, [[Krolusk Warcrawler]]s, and [[Sethrak Raider]]s.

Random yells on Flare Gun use:
*{{text|yell|Halford Wyrmbane|There's the target! Fire!}}
*{{text|yell|Halford Wyrmbane|Give it to em, lads!}}
*{{text|yell|Halford Wyrmbane|Target acquired! Fire!}}
*{{text|yell|Halford Wyrmbane|Unleash it on 'em, lads!}}
*{{text|yell|Halford Wyrmbane|Fire at will!}}

Once done, head in the direction of Ermey. Things did not go so well:
:{{text|yell|Sergeant Ermey|<Name>! We need you, pronto!}}
:{{text|yell|Sergeant Ermey|Damn it, Leonard, I did not give you permission to check out!}}
