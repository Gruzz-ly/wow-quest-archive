Shouldn't be long now!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Guzbert and Kelsey should be here any moment now.}}
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Hey boss! You hear that boom? I think I might've launched a goblin into low orbit.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Welcome back, Miss Steelspark.}}
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Am I the first one back? Where's Guzzy?}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Hmm... yes, where is Guzbert? He should be coming around that corner any moment now.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|<Name>, there's a telescope on the west side of camp. Why don't you go look out for him?}}

Head west and interact with the [[7th Legion Spyglass]].
:''Guzbert appears over a wall and hops down, walking in the direction of camp. Suddenly, a [[san'layn]] appears, snags Guzbert, sucks him dry, and drops his skeleton on the sand before disappearing.''

On complete:
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|G-Guzzy's dead?}}
:''Kelsey starts crying, and Shandris kneels besides her. After few seconds, Shandris stealths and goes away, Kelsey goes to the Flying Machine.''
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|What you're describing sounds like one of the san'layn... a blood prince.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Is the Horde really employing those vampiric elves? How far they've fallen.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|King Anduin must be informed at once. Our task is complete here, but our mission has only just begun.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|I'll call for you again when you are needed. For the Alliance.}}
