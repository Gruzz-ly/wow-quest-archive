==Objectives==
Meet with [[Kimbul|Eraka no Kimbul]].
*Offering delivered

==Description==
The time has come for you to make contact with the great [[loa]] Eraka no Kimbul.

I can only imagine what it will be like to be in the presence of such an ancient and powerful deity. You have earned the [[:Ring of Tides]], so it must be you that addresses the loa.

Please present the loa with this offering from our tribe. Tell him of our plight against the [[naga]].

Eraka no Kimbul is our only hope of survival now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|9|70}}
*8,230 [[XP]]
*+10 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
You must meet with the loa. Are you ready?

==Completion==
It has been many years since I've had a visitor to my temple and been found worthy{{sic}} to wear the Ring of Tides.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Teekcha|You must meet with the loa. Are you ready?}}

The magical barrier blocking entry into the [[Temple of Kimbul]] has disappeared, allowing the player to head inside and meet with Kimbul in the heart of the temple. Talk to the loa:
:You are the first mortal to enter my temple in many years. It is good to once again have followers among the living.
:{{Gossip|Great loa, this is{{sic}} offering is from the [[Tortaka tribe]].}}
:{{Text|say|Kimbul|I sympathize with the Tortaka and their plight against the naga, but I cannot protect them.}}
:{{Text|say|Kimbul|Centuries ago, this temple was attacked by the naga. I arrived too late to save my followers from death.}}
:{{Text|say|Kimbul|I hunted the remaining naga down to the last. None escaped my wrath...}}
:{{Text|say|Kimbul|But just as my fangs pierced the heart of [[Summoner Mepjila|their leader]], she cursed the souls of my followers to unending torment.}}
:{{Text|say|Kimbul|Until their souls are freed, I cannot accept new followers. Honor will not allow it.}}

==Progression==
{{Tortaka Refuge}}
