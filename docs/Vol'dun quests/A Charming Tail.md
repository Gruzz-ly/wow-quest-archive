==Objectives==
Send 15 [[serpent|cobras]] to [[Jenoh]].
*Strand Cobra sent home (15)
*[[Charming Flute#A Charming Tail]] (provided)

==Description==
I think they would make great guardians, when they get older... with the proper training.

However, it seems some of my trainees have wandered off. There are so many things nearby that could harm them!

Between the walking sandstorms and angry plants... it's been safer to hide out here and look at night.

I'm so exhausted!

Could you take this flute with you and play them a little tune? It will remind them to come back to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Did you find all of them?

==Completion==
Yes! Thanks, <name>! They are so much happier now!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Just a Nip]] before leaving. Look for [[Strand Cobra Hatchling]]s and use the [[Charming Flute#A Charming Tail]] to send them slithering back to Jenoh. The flute can be used while mounted.

==Progression==
