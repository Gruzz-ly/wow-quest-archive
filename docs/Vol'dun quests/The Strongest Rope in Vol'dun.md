==Objectives==
Collect 6 Sandspinner Silks.
*[[Sandspinner Silk]] (6)

==Description==
You ever tried tying up a [[sethrak]] with [[vulture]] string? Won't hold 'em for long.

When you really gotta keep something, or someone, tied down, you need sandspinner silk.

Thick, pliable, and not as sticky as you'd think.

This isn't a [[tailoring]] lesson. [[Omi]]'s scouting report showed a lot of sandspinners inside the ruin courtyard. Get their silk and bring it back to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Don't even bother trying to tear it. You can't do it.

==Completion==
Not every treasure is gold, <name>. We [[vulpera]] have learned to recognize value wherever it hides in [[Vol'dun]].

==Notes==
Pick up [[An Army's Arsenal]] and [[Siphoning Souls]] before heading out. Sandspinner Silks drop from [[Sandspinner Hunter]]s, [[Sandspinner Spiderling]]s, [[Sandspinner Stalker]]s, and [[Sandspinner Weaver]]s around the [[Court of Zak'rajan]].

==Progression==
{{Court of Zak'rajan}}
