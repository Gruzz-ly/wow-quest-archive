==Notes==
Head toward Jakra'zet in the eastern chamber of the [[Blood Font]]. Doing so will trigger Jakra'zet to stop his channeling and sacrifice his [[Sandfury Troll]] followers, instantly killing all of them. [[Bladeguard Kaja]], [[Warguard Rakera]], and [[Vorrik]] automatically run into the chamber alongside the player and stop a short distance behind the general, who is still unattackable due to his [https://www.wowhead.com/spell=266230/blood-shield Blood Shield] buff.
:{{Text|say|General Jakra'zet|De ritual of blood is nearly complete!}}
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|It's over, Jakra'zet. Your plan has failed!}}
:{{Text|say|General Jakra'zet|Failed? No...}}
:{{Text|say|General Jakra'zet|I will complete de ritual... with your blood!}}

Jakra'zet turns around to face the group and becomes attackable. In battle, the general uses several abilities:
*{{Abilities|Blood Bolt|id=274992|Blast the target with corrupted blood, inflicting Shadow damage.|icon=ability_ironmaidens_whirlofblood|notes=Interruptible.}}
*{{Abilities|Bloody Ravager|id=274314|Throws the caster's scythe at the target's location, leaving behind a mirror image of it. This copy inflicts Physical damage to all nearby enemies every 1 sec.|icon=inv_polearm_2h_pvpdraenors2_d_01|notes=Uninterruptible.}}
*{{Abilities|Plasma Lightning|id=274302|Strikes all enemies within 60 yards, knocking them back and inflicting Shadow damage.|icon=spell_fire_moltenblood|notes=Interruptible.}}
*{{Abilities|Sanguine Ward|id=274288|Summons a sanguine ward, which reduced damage taken by its summoner by 50%.|icon=spell_nature_agitatingtotem|notes=Uninterruptible.}}

While it's possible to [[interrupt]] Blood Bolt, it is more useful to save interrupt abilities for Plasma Lightning. Avoid standing in Bloody Ravagers and kill [[Sanguine Ward]]s as quickly as possible to remove their damage reduction.

At certain points during the fight, Jakra'zet will also cast Blood Drain, stunning one of the player's companions. At roughly 65% health, he stuns Bladeguard Kaja with [https://www.wowhead.com/spell=274278/ Blood Drain]:
:{{Text|yell|General Jakra'zet|I will complete de ritual... with your blood!}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|My strength... what... is dis?}}
:{{Text|yell|General Jakra'zet|More blood! Dis thirst must be quenched!}}

Around 45-40% health, Vorrik becomes incapacitated by [https://www.wowhead.com/spell=274279/blood-drain Blood Drain] as well:
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|I can't move... help... me...}}
:{{Text|yell|General Jakra'zet|Did you really think you could stand against a god and live? DIE!}}

Finally, at roughly 30% health, Jakra'zet uses [https://www.wowhead.com/spell=274277/blood-drain Blood Drain] on Rakera, leaving the player to fight the general on their own:
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|My body... I can't... Arghh!}}
:{{Text|yell|General Jakra'zet|Your blood empowers me!}}

The battle ends as soon as the player manages to reduce Jakra'zet to 1% health, at which point a cutscene begins:
:''Jakra'zet stumbles across the blood-splattered floor, coughing violently and holding his throat, eventually falling to his knees near the great pit in the center of the chamber, all while Vorrik, the player, Warguard Rakera, and Bladeguard Kaja look on.''
:{{Text|say|General Jakra'zet|<Jakra'zet groans.>}}
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|Dis ends here, General. De plots. De lies. De murders.}}
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|You will not escape your crimes any longer.}}
:''The camera zooms in on Rakera's face.''
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|Dis. Ends. Now.}}
:''Rakera turns to Kaja.''
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|Give him a clean death. We have seen enough suffering for one day.}}
:''Kaja begins walking up behind Jakra'zet with her sword drawn. Jakra'zet, however, begins laughing.''
:{{Text|say|General Jakra'zet|Suffering? You have not seen true suffering. Not yet...}}
:''Suddenly, before Kaja can reach him, Jakra'zet gets to his feet, rushes forward, and jumps into the pit!''
:{{Text|say|General Jakra'zet|But you will!}}
:''Jakra'zet vanishes into the depths of the pit, the last sign of him being a great splatter of blood. Kaja glances back toward Vorrik, the player, and Rakera, until the chamber suddenly begins to rumble and shake. Something immense begins rising out of the pit. Kaja quickly backs off.''
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|No... It cannot be!}}
:''Vorrik turns and runs. Rakera does the same, followed by Kaja and finally the player, as the monstrous creature fully emerges from the pit.''
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|He was de final sacrifice... We have failed.}}
:''Fully awakened, Mythrax the Unraveler roars at the camera before the screen fades to black.''

The player finds themselves back at the [[Sanctuary of the Devoted]] with Kaja, Vorrik, and Rakera. Talk to the latter to turn in. Completing this quest rewards "Atul'Aman", the final portion of [[Secrets in the Sands]], and concludes the main [[Vol'dun storyline]]. Vorrik offers the dungeon quest [[Temple of Sethraliss: Avatar of the Loa]], while Rakera offers [[Informing the Horde]], a breadcrumb back to [[Dazar'alor]].

==Progression==
{{Atul'Aman}}

==Trivia==
*In the beta version of this quest, [[Sethraliss]] saved the player and their companions from Mythrax.{{fact|Footage or other concrete information about the beta version of the quest would be helpful.}} This did not make it to the live version of the game, but Warguard Rakera still attributes the group's escape to Sethraliss' grace metaphorically in [[Informing the Horde]].
