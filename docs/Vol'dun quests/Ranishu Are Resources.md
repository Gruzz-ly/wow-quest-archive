==Objectives==
Collect 25 Intact [[Ranishu]] Stomachs.
*[[Ranishu Stomach]] (25)

==Description==
We can't afford to waste resources out here.

Over time, we've learned to take anything that looks even remotely useful, and be creative using what we have. I've turned a skull into a boat and a [[sethrak]] into a tent flap.

I can't spit dust when it comes to [[magic]], but I can mix poisons and potions with the best of 'em.

Ranishu stomach acid makes wicked poison, but it's nasty to collect. Don't try to bottle it. Just bring me their stomachs whole and intact. No leaks!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
It looks like you've still got all your fingers. That's good.

==Completion==
Can't say I've seen someone carry that many stomachs at once.

I don't know if I'm impressed or disgusted.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Omi|Ranishu have multiple stomachs, so don't stop digging after you find the first.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Tacha]]|Filthy little monsters.}}

Pick up [[Inconvenient Spirits]] and [[They've Got Golems]] before heading out. Ranishu Stomachs can drop from [[Ranishu Nibbler]]s and [[Ranishu Ravager]]s around the [[Bone Pit]] to the southeast. Multiple stomachs can drop from a single ranishu.

==Progression==
{{Court of Zak'rajan}}

==Trivia==
*During the early builds of the ''[[Battle for Azeroth]]'' beta, this quest was named '''Vulperan War Supplies'''.

==Patch changes==
