==Objectives==
Speak to Private James and uncover the significance of [[Vorrik's Keystone|Vorrik's Stone]].
* Speak to [[Private James]] {{co|27.6|52.6|Vol'dun}}
* Follow [[Vorrik]] {{co|27.1|52.6|Vol'dun}}

==Description==
It's good to see that your companion is back unharmed.

But more importantly, let's see if he still has my stone hidden in his pockets.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The [[Faithless]] will never stop their siege, but your efforts have bought us time.

==Notes==
Speak with James:
:I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you and the sarge. Thanks again.

:{{gossip|Is there anything in your pockets?}}
:{{text|say|Private James|Oh! There's some sort of stone in there.}}
:{{text|say|Vorrik|That's not just a stone, it's a key. It is one of a set used to contain a great and terrible power.}}
:{{text|say|Vorrik|Follow me, if you would.}}
:{{text|say|Vorrik|Long ago, before the sands began to spread, a monstrous [[C'Thrax]]xi [[Mythrax|warbringer]] descended upon our lands. He began to slaughter all in his path, [[Zandalari troll|troll]] and [[sethrak]] alike.}}
:{{text|say|Vorrik|It was only through the intervention of our [[loa]] that we were spared. [[Sethraliss]] sacrificed herself to subdue the C'Thrax, but not before it was able to destroy an ancient pyramid that stood in the center of this land.}}
:{{text|say|Vorrik|The power unleashed from the destruction was immense. Our land was forever altered.}}
:{{text|say|Vorrik|The great [[sage]] [[Sulthis]] enlisted the aid of [[Emperor Korthek|Korthek]] and I to raise a [[magic]]al barrier to seal away the fallen C'Thrax. We swore that we would never allow such terror to be unleashed again.}}
:{{text|say|Vorrik|Korthek grew tired of peace. He turned his back upon the sacrifice of Sethraliss and foolishly seeks to combine the keys and unleash the C'Thrax upon his foes.}}
:{{text|say|Vorrik|Korthek is insane! He must be stopped!}}
:{{text|say|Sergeant Ermey|This is dire news. We better go report this to the [[Halford Wyrmbane|High Commander]].}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Sergeant Ermey|It's time we get headed back. Wyrmbane's going to want a full report.}}
