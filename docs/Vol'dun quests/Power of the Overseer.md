==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Overseer Nerzet.jpg|Overseer Nerzet|Cruel and driven.}}
Kill [[Overseer Nerzet]] and take her power rock.
*[[Azerite Shard (item)]] obtained

==Description==
Overseer Nerzet is very cruel, and oh so very easy to provoke!

It makes her very angry when things go missing, or move, or change... my crew and I are having a yip of a time! That you got [[Scepter of Prescience|this device]] to work was certainly a bonus!

It will be much easier for us to finish up what we need to do here, with her out of the way.

Um, and maybe go ahead and grab that neat power rock she carries. It could come in handy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Small Azerite Fragment]] (75 [[Azerite (resource)]])
*{{Cost|38|80}}
*20,560 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Were you able to end her reign?

==Completion==
Hmmm. I am tempted to sell this stone, it must be quite valuable.

However, with what you have shown us today, I think there may be more value in having it with us.

==Notes==
Nerzet is located at the upper level of [[Zul'Ahjin]], at {{Coords|48.6|76.8|Vol'dun}}. On aggro:
:{{Text|say|Overseer Nerzet|The key is ours, <class>! The other [[Keepers (sethrak)|Keepers]] failed in their task! For [[Emperor Korthek|Korthek]], I will not!}}

On death:
:{{Text|say|Overseer Nerzet|May the desert take your soul.}}

==Progression==
{{A City of Secrets}}
