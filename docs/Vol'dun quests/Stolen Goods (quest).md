==Objectives==
Recover 6 stolen supplies.
*Stolen supplies (6)

==Description==
It was brought to my attention recently dat many of our supplies went missing overnight.

I suspected dat [[Tongo]]'s crew was behind de theft, but we didn't have de strength or numbers needed to confront dem.

I want you to search de hideout for signs of our missing supplies. If dere's anything left when you arrive, bring it back here and I'll make sure you're compensated.

If we're going to survive [[Mojambo]]'s assault we're going to need those stolen supplies back as soon as possible.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
De supplies must be recovered.

==Completion==
You've located de supplies and dey appear mostly intact! You have done a great service for our tribe, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Bandit Blades]] and [[Tongo (quest)]] before heading to [[Exiles' Enclave]]. There is no specific item called "stolen supplies"; instead, you have to gather the following specific items from around the enclave:
