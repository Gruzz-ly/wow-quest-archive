==Objectives==
Report to [[Halford Wyrmbane]] in [[Vol'dun]].

==Description==
Our work here is done. Halford and [[Explosioneer Zoidfuse|Zoidfuse]] should be further down the coast, to the east.

If you don't mind, I'll meet you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Arlethal Sunwatcher|Arlethal]] is already dead?

That's good, I suppose... though it does take some of the fun out of my plan.

==Progression==
{{Blood on the Sand}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
