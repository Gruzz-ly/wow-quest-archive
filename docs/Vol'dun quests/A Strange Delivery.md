==Objectives==
Deliver the pineapple to [[Rhan'ka]] in the [[Whistlebloom Oasis]].
*[[Juicy Pineapple]] (provided)

==Description==
The last time our caravan rolled through the Whistlebloom Oasis, we found an odd [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] living in a cave. We traded a few things and he paid me upfront to bring him a pineapple. I don't know why.

It took me a long time to find one, but a [[vulpera]] holds up her end of the trade.

I was planning to stop by and drop it off after we finished here. But, thanks to your help, we've got a lot more treasure hunting to do here at [[Port of Zem'lan|the port]].

If you have time, would you deliver it for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|1|94}}
*1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Rhan'ka closely inspects the pineapple.>

This... is... the perfect pineapple!

==Notes==
Travel north to the Whistlebloom Oasis and enter the [[Goldtusk Inn]] to find Rhan'ka. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|No, [[Grenja]], I won't buy ya a golden drum! Stop askin' or I be takin' away ya fancy new hat!}}
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|Everyone be quiet! We have a guest.}}

==Progression==
{{Goldtusk Inn}}
