==Objectives==
Deliver the offering to [[Akunda the Exalted]] at the [[Temple of Akunda]].
*[[Jorak's Offering]] (provided)

==Description==
Dis offering is all dat I have to my name, but it wouldn't be right for me to use it for myself when I know [[Warguard Rakera|your friend]] is in danger.

She saved my life, now I can save hers.

Take de offering. Don't make me ask twice.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|1|94}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you come bearing gifts to our [[loa]]?

==Completion==
Dis is a generous offering, but a gift alone isn't enough to enter our temple.

Redemption can't be bought, it must be earned.

Lucky for you, dere is much work to be done.

==Notes==
On accept, [[Bladeguard Kaja]] runs up the stairs to the temple entrance.
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|If Rakera is within dis temple, we will find her.}}

Akunda the Exalted is waiting in front of the doorway.
:{{Text|say|Akunda the Exalted|Do you seek redemption? [[Akunda]] welcomes all.}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|We're looking for an exile named Rakera. We think she may be within dis temple.}}
:{{Text|say|Akunda the Exalted|You'll only find Akunda here. Those who share his name are the only ones permitted to enter his hall.}}

==Progression==
