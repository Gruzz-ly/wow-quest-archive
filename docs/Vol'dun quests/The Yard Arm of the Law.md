==Notes==
Pick up [[My Last Day Alive]] before heading out. On accept:
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|It ain't a mutiny with just two of us, <name>. Recruit some others!}}

[[Quartermaster Tulmac]] is strapped to a wall inside a large alcove at {{Coords|36.8|78.2|Vol'dun}}. Upon being freed:
:{{Text|say|Quartermaster Tulmac|I be gladly joinin' ya mutiny, ya swab. Pirate-King Zem'lan gonna pay for crossin' me.}}

[[Gunner Bosanya]] is hanging from a line at {{Coords|35.2|78|Vol'dun}}. Upon being freed:
:{{Text|say|Gunner Bosanya|I never met a mutiny I didn't like. I'm in.}}

[[Jukanga the Snitch]] is tied up over [[Witchdoctor Yoksa]]'s cauldron inside a building at {{Coords|34.6|77|Vol'dun}}. Upon being freed:
:{{Text|say|Jukanga the Snitch|Scuttle me bones! Of course I be ready to mutiny. I been hangin' here for weeks!}}

Head back to Jamboya on the southern dock. Bosanya is standing guard with her bow drawn, while Jukanga is standing next to Jamboya and Tulmac is sitting on the edge of the dock. On approach:
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|We be of an accord, den?}}
:{{Text|say|Quartermaster Tulmac|Aye. Zem'lan be a tyrant, not a captain. Mutiny be da only way.}}
:{{Text|say|Gunner Bosanya|Aye.}}
:{{Text|say|Jukanga the Snitch|Aye.}}
