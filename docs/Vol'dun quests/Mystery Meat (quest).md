[[Mojambo]]'s gang may be coming to kill us, but we've still got to eat. And when you live in a harsh wasteland, you make do with what you've got.

Sometimes fresh meat is hard to find.

Dat's how I came up with de idea for my famous mystery meat pie.

De secret ingredient is dung beetle, but with enough seasoning you can't even tell!

Our food supplies are dangerously low right now. I need someone to go beetle hunting as soon as possible!

You will receive:
*[[Dung Beetle Surprise]] x5
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have de "mystery ingredient" for de mystery meat pie?

==Completion==
Just look at all dese juicy intestines! We'll have enough pies to feed de entire camp!

==Notes==
Dung Beetle Innards are looted from [[Vol'duni Dunecrawler]]s in and north of the [[Exiles' Enclave]] to the west.

After completing this quest, [[Dung Beetle Surprise]] becomes available for purchase from Sezahjin.
