==Objectives==
Recover the journal's missing pages.
* [[Rakera's Journal Page|Journal Pages]] recovered

==Description==
I found this journal buried in the sand.

[[Kiro]] tried to toss it in the fire.

"Our wagon has no space for a diary, Meerah. What practical use does it have?"

Don't tell him I said so, but I think it's fascinating! Can you imagine what kinds of secrets it holds?

Quite a few pages are missing, but I bet you can recover them out on the dunes!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|Rakera's Journal
}}

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
What have you found?

==Completion==
Dis is [[Warguard Rakera|Rakera]]'s handwriting. I'd know it anywhere.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Knickknack Takeback]] and [[Searching for Survivors]] before heading out. [[Rakera's Journal Page]]s can be found at {{Coords|52.8|41.6|Vol'dun}}, {{Coords|56.2|43.8|Vol'dun}}, {{Coords|52.8|46.2|Vol'dun}}, and {{Coords|55.8|48.6|Vol'dun}}. While on the quests, be sure to also pick up [[A Meal for Birds]] and [[Aided Escape]] from [[Neri]] and [[Mekaru]] at the wagon west of the [[Brine Basin]].

First page:
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|I write dis as I sit in a cage with a dozen other exiles, traveling to de sands where we will live out our days, however numbered dey may be. De air, heavy with heat, tells me we are close.}}

Second page:
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|De sun has set across de dunes, providing some relief from de heat dat has made many delirious. In a sun-stricken stupor, one among us began rambling about a [[Temple of Akunda|temple to de south]] dat welcomes exiles. I doubt he will make it through de night.}}

Third page:
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|Assassins, sent by [[General Jakra'zet|Jakra'zet]], attacked our camp in de middle of de night. Unarmed and befuddled by sleep, we were unable to defend ourselves. I fought off de traitors, but it was too late. De survivors had scattered, each now forced to navigate dis unforgiving terrain alone.}}

Fourth page:
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|I won't survive much longer without food or water. After traveling in circles for most of de day, I decided my only option was to follow de advice of a rambling madman and head south toward de promise of shelter.}}

On completion of Knickknack Takeback, Searching for Survivors, and Secrets in the Sand:
:{{Text|say|Kiro|Meerah, ready the wagon and be prepared to pick up supplies at the port. Our new allies can ride along and continue their search.}}
:{{Text|say|KIro|It's time to put [[Nisha]]'s plan into action. The sethrak will never see us coming.}}
