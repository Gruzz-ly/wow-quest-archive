==Objectives==
Steal the [[Battle Krolusk]] mount and return to [[Meerah]].
* Battle Krolusk stolen
* Return to [[Vorrik's Sanctum]].

==Description==
One thing I've learned during my time in [[Vol'dun]] is to not stay in one place for too long. And doubly so when the [[Faithless]] are involved.

We've done our damage here. Let's move before we get caught.

I procured a mount to take us back to Meerah and the others in Vorrik's Sanctum quickly. Don't worry, [[Faithless Wrangler|this Faithless]] won't be needing it anymore.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|70}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
I'll have some of the [[vulpera]] stable that krolusk outside, in case we need to use it again.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Kiro|Hop on the krolusk and let's get out of here before the Faithless send reinforcements!}}

Mount the [[Battle Krolusk]] just down the path behind Kiro and ride it back to Vorrik's Sanctum. The krolusk has a single ability:
:{{Abilities|Rampaging Charge|id=272732|Rushes forward, trampling anything in front of the caster.|icon=ability_heroicleap}}

Upon arriving at the sanctum, Kiro runs inside to stand next to Meerah.
:{{Text|say|Kiro|That was... surprisingly fun!}}
:{{Text|say|Meerah|Kiro! I'm so happy you're back! Was it scary out there? How'd you get one of their krolusks? Did you name it? Can I name it? Is it nice?}}
:{{Text|say|Kiro|I'll tell you the stories later, Meerah. Let's get our people out of here safely first.}}

Afterward, the Battle Krolusk can be found stabled outside the sanctum and can be mounted whenever the player wishes.

==Progression==
{{Storming the Spire}}
