==Objectives==
Loot [[Captain Hartford]]'s cache.

==Description==
Well, I'm sure you've figured it out by now, eh?

I never was fixing to abandon the crew, I just wanted to move up the ranks. You've helped me out a great deal in that respect.

Speaking of respect, I believe there's the matter of Captain Hartford's lockbox...

Here's the code, courtesy of the fallen captain. Just as I promised. It's all yours!

Now, don't go telling anyone about our little arrangement, okay? I wouldn't want something like that to spoil such a profitable partnership!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Small Azerite Fragment]] (75 [[Azerite (resource)]])
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The chest creaks open.>

==Notes==
Interact with [[Captain Hartford's lockbox]] to turn in. On completion:
