==Objectives==
Choose a weapon for Nisha.
* Weapon chosen

==Description==
You must be special if the [[sethrak]] didn't kill you right away.

Either that, or you'd fetch a good price at the slave market.

Don't worry though. We're getting out of here.

I have a wagon at the entrance, but no weapon to fight with.

Luckily, it seems the sethrak have plenty.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
I'm good with whatever you pick, but let's hurry.

==Completion==
Using their own weapons against them. I like it.

==Notes==
Pick from the [[Sethrak Scimitar]], the [[Sethrak Scythe]], or the [[Sethrak Staff]] on the weapon rack next to Nisha. Regardless of choice, they all elicit the same response:
:{{Text|say|Nisha|Nice choice. I can work with that.}}

On completion, Nisha begins following the player around:
:{{Text|say|Nisha|I'm ready. Let's hunt some sethrak.}}

==Progression==
