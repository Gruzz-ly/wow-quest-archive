Look for clues within Unwanted Memories.

==Description==
De memories of [[Akunda]]'s followers rest within [[Valley of Sorrows|dis valley]].

Most are best left forgotten, but dey may be our only chance to find out what happened to Akunda.

Look back upon de memories here. See if you can find any clues about what happened to our [[loa]].

Be warned. Dis is not a task for de weak. What you witness in dese memories can't be unseen.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Peer into de memories. See what you can find.

==Completion==
It is as I feared. De loa's own memories have been taken from him.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Shattered and Broken]] before heading out. Unwanted Memories are urns located all over the valley. Some merely spawn [[Fractured Memory|Fractured Memories]] when interacted with, but the first, third, fifth, and eighth urns will trigger special cutscenes.

First memory (first urn):
:''[[Warguard Rakera]] is conversing with [[Bladeguard Kaja]].
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|[[General Jakra'zet|Jakra'zet]] is a traitor, but [[Rastakhan|de king]] won't act without proof.}}
:''Kaja falls to her knees, begging Rakera not to leave.
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|Please, Rakera. Don't do dis! You'll get yourself killed!}}
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|You know I must, Kaja. Duty before all else.}}

Second memory (third urn):
:''A lone [[gazelle]] approaches the [[Eternal Spring]] and begins drinking from the waterhole. [[Akunda the Exalted]] appears and approaches the water. He kneels down and begins pouring what appears to be poison into the spring. The gazelle suddenly dies.''

Third memory (fifth urn):
:''Akunda drinks from the poisoned spring and quickly collapses on the ground.''

Fourth and final memory (eighth urn):
:''Akunda's body hangs suspended in the air inside the [[Temple of Akunda]] while Akunda the Exalted is seemingly draining power from the loa.''
