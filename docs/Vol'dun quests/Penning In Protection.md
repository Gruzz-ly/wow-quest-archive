==Objectives==
Collect bones from [[Zem'lan]] pirates and mill them into a fine powder. Mix the powder with your blood to create a Vial of Ossien{{sic}} Ink. Then sign the [[Bloodguard Chronicles]].
* [[Zem'lan Pirate Bone]] (15)
* Mill the bones into dust and make a [[Vial of Ossein Ink]]
* Sign the [[Bloodguard Chronicles]]

==Description==
<As you open the book, you turn each page and see portraits of champions standing alongside a large beast.

Eventually you come to a blank portrait, and touch the page. Runes begin to appear in an ancient language, and quickly translate into words you can read.>

"The creature within, a guardian of men,
A mixture of blood
and of bone inked with pen.
The blood from the scribe,
the bone from the land,
Milled to perfection,
and signed by the hand."

==Rewards==
You will learn how to create : [[:Blood Contract: Bloodguard]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You would think with all the blood you have to give up for these trials, that you would be white as a ghost at the end of them.

Or maybe just passed out for a week.

==Completion==
You've been accepted, it appears.

<[[Veriss]] motions to the book. You glance over and see an image of yourself posed alongside a great beast. Your signature glistening at the top of the page.>

You may now invoke the Contract of the Bloodguard.

Be mindful of the guardian's life though. If it gets too low, it may look at you as potential fuel.

==Notes==
Fly to the [[Scorched Sands Outpost]], then travel west to reach the Port of Zem'lan.

==Progression==
{{Drawing Blood}}
