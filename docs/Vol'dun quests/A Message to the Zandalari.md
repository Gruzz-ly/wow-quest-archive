==Objectives==
Slay 12 Zandalari Exiles.

I know we're here to hunt the [[Horde]], but this is an opportunity.

Exiles or not, these are [[Zandalari troll]]s, and the Zandalari have all but put in their lot with the Horde.

Let's show them what we do to friends of the Horde.

* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

What are you waiting for?

I hope you left a few alive.

They need to learn to fear us.
