* [[Goblin "Mind Enhancer"]]
* [[Gryzix's Toolbox]]

==Description==
Okay, <name>. We got almost everything we need. Almost.

You see, I lost my toolbox. I must have dropped it while running from the [[sethrak]] a couple days ago. Can ya fetch it for me? I'm not a very good engineer without my tools!

And take a mech with ya. I've spied some mysterious [[Dwarf|dwarven]] and [[Troll|troll]] figures lurking around... better not be the [[Venture Company|Venture Co.]] One whiff of the schematic being here and we got trouble.

You'll need the mind enhancer for it to follow you. Just put it on and you'll be good to go!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Gryzix appears to be dead.>

==Completion==
<You place the toolbox on the ground, next to his corpse.>
