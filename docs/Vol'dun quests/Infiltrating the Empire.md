==Objectives==
Accompany Vorrik to [[Vorrik's Sanctum|his sanctum]].

==Description==
The heart of the [[Faithless]] empire rests just beyond this ridge. We will need to move swiftly and quietly to avoid detection once inside.

Thankfully, my former dwelling is nearby. I know a passage that should allow us to advance into the fortress with minimal resistance. When you are ready, speak with me and I will show you the way.

<Vorrik looks around suspiciously.>

I expected the Faithless to patrol this area... Keep your eyes open for anything suspicious along the path.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|9|70}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
It's unconventional, but I believe [[Sethraliss]] would be pleased to see her shrine used to protect innocents in need.

And if these [[vulpera]] are fighting the Faithless, they will be useful allies.

==Notes==
On accept, Vorrik begins heading north and then turning east towards the sanctum. Follow him.

:{{Text|say|Vorrik|It is a cruel nest of rock and dirt, swarming with [[sethrak]] who have forsaken our [[loa]].}}
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|I lived here too once, long ago. Before [[Emperor Korthek|Korthek]] betrayed our people for power and madness.}}
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|In those days, Korthek and I led all sethrak in our worship of Sethraliss.}}
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|My personal sanctum was hidden away in the hills. A small shrine to Sethraliss, where I could meditate.}}
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|It has been abandoned for years, but it will be an ideal place to launch our--}}
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|Wait... what are vulpera doing here?}}

Upon approaching the sanctum, it becomes clear that it is filled with vulpera, with vulpera banners hanging outside the entrance. Vorrik dismounts and heads inside, where [[Meerah]] is sheltering a group of [[Rescued Slave (Vol'dun)|Rescued Slaves]].
:{{Text|say|Meerah|Everyone, stay calm. This is one of the good ones.}}
:{{Text|say|Meerah|Hot sands, am I glad to see you, <name>! I'm in way over my head, here...}}
