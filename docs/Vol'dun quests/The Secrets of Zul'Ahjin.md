==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Crumbling Statue|statue]].

==Description==
You're not the only one who came to [[Zul'Ahjin]] looking for answers. The place is crawling with looters and assassins, all searching for something...

So far, they've come up empty handed, but that's because they don't know where to look.

I do.

Investigate the statue at the center of the ruins. It is the key to uncovering the city's ancient secrets.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive this item:
|Small Azerite Shard
}}

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
<The ancient stones hum with magic.>

==Notes==
The [[Crumbling Statue]] is located in the central ruins at {{Coords|48.8|74.4|Vol'dun}}. On your way there, you can also visit a [[vulpera]]-occupied building and complete [[Magic Decoder Device]], which is followed up by [[Rescue the Relics]], [[Expedite the Excavation]], and optionally [[Exterminate the Vermin]], leading to [[Power of the Overseer]].

==Progression==
{{A City of Secrets}}
