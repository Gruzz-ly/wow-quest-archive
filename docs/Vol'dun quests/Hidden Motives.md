==Objectives==
Locate the [[naga]] invasion plans.
*[[Invasion Plans]]

==Description==
I do not understand why the naga would bother attacking a small fishing village.

Why waste their time on our simple tribe? The naga seek power and we have none. It makes no sense!

They must be after something else entirely...

Search [[Darkwood Shoal]] and learn of their plans. Whatever the naga are after, it must be quite powerful.

Perhaps if we find it first, we can use it against them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Small Azerite Shard]] (125x [[Azerite (resource)]])
*{{Cost|38|80}}
*20,560 [[XP]]
*+150 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Have you uncovered their plans?

==Completion==
According to the invasion plans, the naga are after an ancient relic of extraordinary power known as the [[:Ring of Tides]]. Apparently, it was lost hundreds of years ago in a battle not far from here...

==Notes==
Pick up [[They Came From The Sea]] and [[Crab Trapping]] before heading out. On accept:
:{{Text|say|Torka|We must find out what the naga are searching for...}}

The Invasion Plans drop from [[Overseer Zarjish]] at {{Coords|64.8|22.6|Vol'dun}}.

==Progression==
{{Tortaka Refuge}}
