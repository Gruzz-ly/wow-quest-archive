==Objectives==
Retrieve [[:Tongo's Head]].
*[[Tongo's Head]]

==Description==
If [[Mojambo]] hired [[Tongo]]'s gang as reinforcements, we're in even more trouble than we first thought.

Tongo is a cruel and sadistic marauder who takes great delight in suffering. His gang is notorious for torturing their prey.

We won't be able to defend ourselves against both gangs at once. Our only chance of survival now is to strike first.

If you take out Tongo before de ambush, Mojambo will be expecting reinforcements dat never arrive. We may be able to use dat to our advantage...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Small Azerite Shard]] (100x [[Azerite (resource)]])
*{{Cost|38|80}}
*20,560 [[XP]]
*+150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Has Tongo been defeated?

==Completion==
With Tongo out of de way, all we have to worry about now is Mojambo...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Bandit Blades]] and [[Stolen Goods (quest)]] before leaving. Tongo is sitting in [[Tongo's Hideout]]{{Coords|40.4|76|Vol'dun}} at [[Exiles' Enclave]] to the west with his two [[hyena]]s [[Gnarl (hyena)|Gnarl]] and [[Snarl (hyena)|Snarl]].
