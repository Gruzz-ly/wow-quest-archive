==Objectives==
Collect Lumpy Crab Meat from [[Sand Scuttler]]s.
*[[Lumpy Crab Meat]] (8)

==Description==
Shouldn't you be in [[Redrock Mines|the mines]]? Look, I won't tell [[Overseer Morrison|Morrison]] if you won't. I wouldn't want to be stuck in those mines, either.

We could use a hand out here, though. The crew is getting crabby. We've been eating nothing but slop and the occasional [[rat]] for weeks.

I hear one of the deckhands makes a marvelous [[crab]] stew. Can I count on you to secure the meat?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It'll be nice to eat something other than rat for a change.

==Completion==
You've done good, <name>. We'll be eatin' like kings tonight!

==Notes==
Sand Scuttlers are found all over the beach.

==Progression==
{{Ashvane Encampment}}

==Patch changes==
