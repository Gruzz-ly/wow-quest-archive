==Objectives==
Find the statue's missing gems.
* [[Glittering Sapphire]] (2)

==Description==
<Carved into the ancient statue are two eye sockets that look like they once held gems.

Perhaps the missing gems can be found within the ruins?>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
<Carved into the ancient statue are two eye sockets that look like they once held gems.>

==Completion==
<The gems slot perfectly into place.>

==Notes==
The Glittering Sapphires are looted from two objects, one located at {{Coords|49.8|73|Vol'dun}}, the other at {{Coords|51|72.2|Vol'dun}}.

On completion, the sapphires appear in the statue's eye sockets, which shoot out a pair of laser beams that converge at a single point, conjuring a projection of [[Sulthis]].
:{{Text|say|Sulthis|[[Vorrik]], if you are receiving this message, then I fear I was too late. [[Emperor Korthek|Korthek]] has betrayed our people, and plans to break the barrier we placed on [[Atul'Aman|the tomb]] long ago.}}

An [[Ancient Reliquary]] appears in front of Sulthis.
:{{Text|say|Sulthis|I can only hope I've hidden my key well enough so that you are the only one to find it.}}

The image of Sulthis disappears.

{{A City of Secrets}}
