Collect a Seafaring Hat, Nautical Map, and Weathered Spyglass.
*[[Seafaring Hat]]
*[[Nautical Map (Vol'dun)]]
*[[Weathered Spyglass]]

==Description==
She might not be much to look at, but this boat will take me back to [[Boralus]].

Before my voyage can begin, I'll need a few seafaring necessities.

Luckily, everything I need can be found in the [[Ashvane Encampment|Ashvane encampment]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you had any luck securing those items I asked for?

==Completion==
This should all help me get to where I need to go.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both Seafaring Necessities and [[Dead Men Tell No Tales]], Randall runs off to the south:
:{{Text|say|Randall Redmond|Meet me in [[Redrock Harbor]] when the job is done.}}
:{{Text|say|Randall Redmond|With you on my side, I'll be one step closer to getting out of this blasted desert!}}

The [[Nautical Map (Vol'dun)]] is lying on a table near [[Boatswain Hendricks]].{{Coords|47.8|87|Vol'dun}} The [[Weathered Spyglass]] is sitting on the table in front of [[Gunner Erikson]].{{Coords|46.8|87.2|Vol'dun}} The [[Seafaring Hat]] is worn by [[Expedition Leader Augustus]], who is sleeping next to a tent on the west side of the encampment.{{Coords|46.2|86.4|Vol'dun}} If the player is disguised using [[Ashvane Garb]], they can simply interact with Augustus to steal the hat from him while he's sleeping; otherwise, he can also simply be killed and drop the hat upon death.

After collecting the items, meet up with Randall at the cliffs on the north side of Redrock Harbor, where he is looking off towards ''[[Siren's Call|The Siren's Call]]'' through a spyglass.
