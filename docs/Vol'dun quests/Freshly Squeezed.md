==Objectives==
Collect 8 Pricklevine Juice.
* [[Pricklevine Juice (quest item)]] (8)

==Description==
Is [[Bladeguard Kaja|this troll]] a friend of yours? I'm so glad [[Kiro]] let me keep her.

He's a bit wary of outsiders, but he's a great [[healer]].

She'll wake up, I promise. And when she does, she'll be thirsty.

The sands are short on water, but you're in luck. The grove that surrounds [[Vulpera Hideaway|this camp]] is filled with pricklevines.

You wouldn't want to eat the flesh, but the liquid inside can quench any thirst.

Just give them a good squeeze to collect their juice.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Do you have the juice? Your friend will be thirsty when she wakes.

==Completion==
That's a lot of juice!

==Notes==
The juice is obtained by interacting with [[Vibrant Pricklevine]]s in the [[Prickly Grove]] just to the southwest. Pick up [[Restorative Venom]] before heading out, and pick up [[Missing Business]] while in the grove.

==Progression==
{{Dangers in the Desert}}

==Patch changes==
