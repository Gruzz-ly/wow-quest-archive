==Objectives==
Collect 10 [[:Scavenged Supplies]].
*[[Scavenged Supplies]] (10)

==Description==
<The leather has become dry and cracked in the sun, but the supplies inside are mostly intact.

It's unknown what gruesome death befell the backpack's former owner, but supplies like these are in high demand among the outcasts.

The desert has claimed many lives... perhaps there are more supplies to be found among the dunes.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
What do you have for me?

==Completion==
I see you made a scavenging run and came back alive!

We will put these supplies to good use among the tribe. You have my thanks.

==Notes==
[[Scavenged Supplies]] are looted from [[Backpack (Vol'dun)|Backpacks]] and [[Supply Pouch]]es around the nearby area.
