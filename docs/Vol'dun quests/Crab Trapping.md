==Objectives==
Catch 8 Clampclaw Clackers.
*[[Clampclaw Clacker]]s (8)
*[[Crab Trap]] (provided)

==Description==
We are trapped here with little in the way of food and supplies.

The territorial [[sethrak]] control the land to the west, and the spiteful [[naga]] the waters to the east. We are caught between a barren desert and a hostile ocean.

If you are headed to [[Darkwood Shoal|the lagoon]] to face the naga, will you bring us back some [[crab]]s to eat?

I fear that our tribe will soon perish without food...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Do you have a case of crabs?

==Completion==
You've arrived just in time, our supplies were getting dangerously low. The [[Tortaka tribe]] thanks you, traveler.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Hidden Motives]] and [[They Came From The Sea]] before heading out. On accept:
:{{Text|say|Churka|I fear that our tribe will soon perish without food...}}

[[Clampclaw Clacker]]s roam [[Darkwood Shoal]]. Use the [[Crab Trap]] to capture and automatically collect them.

==Progression==
{{Tortaka Refuge}}
