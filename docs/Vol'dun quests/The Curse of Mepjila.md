==Objectives==
Defeat the spirit of Mepjila.
*Spirit Mask worn
*[[Summoner Mepjila]] slain
*[[Spirit Mask]] (provided)

==Description==
Centuries ago, the sea witch Mepjila attacked my temple with an army of [[naga]] invaders.

My followers fought bravely, but I arrived too late to save them.

I defeated the naga army with ease. But as I closed my jaws around Mepjila, she placed a curse upon the spirits of my followers, locking them in an eternal battle they can never win.

This mask will give you the power to enter the spirit realm and end their nightmare.

Defeat the spirit of Mepjila and the curse will be broken.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|38|80}}
*20,560 [[XP]]
*+150 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
You must break the curse and free the captive souls of my followers.

==Completion==
At long last, my ancient followers have found peace. You have served well, <name>.

==Notes==
Use the [[Spirit Mask]] to enter a spirit realm version of the [[Temple of Kimbul]]. Here, Kimbul is missing, and ghostly [[Temple Defender (Zandalari troll)|Temple Defenders]] are either standing guard or rushing out of the temple and down the stairs to the [[Terrace of the Fang]]. Upon heading down from the temple to the uppermost terrace:
:{{Text|say|Temple Defender|De temple is under attack! We must summon de [[loa]]!}}

Heading another level down:
:{{Text|say|Temple Defender|Where is Eraka no Kimbul? De temple is being overrun!}}
:{{Text|say|Kimbul|The spirits of my followers are caught in an unending battle.}}
:{{Text|say|Kimbul|The only way to break the curse is to slay the spirit of Mepjila.}}
:{{Text|say|Temple Defender|De naga are too strong! We cannot hold dem off much longer!}}

Finally, head down another level, where Temple Defenders are engaged in battle with [[Naga Invader]]s. [[Summoner Mepjila]] is standing a short distance away at {{Coords|60.6|13.2|Vol'dun}}, surrounded by several dead Temple Defenders and accompanied by a [[Greater Tide Elemental]]. Mepjila is immune to [[crowd control]]. After killing her, remove the Spirit Mask buff to return to the world of the living and run back up the stairs to the Temple of Kimbul, which is now filled with [[Ancient Spirit (Vol'dun)|Ancient Spirits]]. Talk to Kimbul to turn in.

:{{Text|say|Temple Defender|You have done it! De temple is saved!}}
:{{Text|say|Temple Defender|Mepjila has been defeated! We are saved!}}
:{{Text|say|Temple Defender|Rejoice! De sea witch Mepjila is defeated!}}

On completion:
:{{Text|say|Kimbul|You have broken the curse of Mepjila and brought peace to the souls of my ancient followers.}}
:{{Text|say|Kimbul|However, one task yet remains. Speak with me when you are ready to confront the [[Stormcoil]] army.}}
