==Objectives==
Kill sethrak in the [[Abandoned Burrows]].
* [[Sethrak]] slain (12)

==Description==
The sethrak's attacks on our burrows cannot go unanswered.

They need to learn that not all within the desert will give up so easily.

The only thing the sethrak understand is blood, so that's the language we'll use to teach them.

<Nisha pauses and looks at you, skeptical that you understood her.>

I'm saying we need to kill the sethrak here. All of them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
The sethrak will answer for what they have done.

==Completion==
Their blood flows down the dunes back to [[Skycallers' Spire|their fortress]]. The sethrak will think twice before attacking our burrows again.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Dressed for Battle]] before heading out.

Upon exiting the [[Shrouded Hollow]] into the Abandoned Burrows:
:{{Text|say|Nisha|Look what the sethrak have done to our home...}}

[[Sethrak Aggressor]]s, [[Sethrak Sandscout]]s, [[Sethrak Skycaller]]s, [[Sethrak Ravager]]s, [[Sethrak Warden]]s, and [[Sethrak Warbringer]]s can be found all over the burrows. While killing them, Nisha will occasionally have more to say:
:{{Text|say|Nisha|We weren't prepared for their attack. The sethrak slaughter and enslave without remose.}}
:{{Text|say|Nisha|The vulpera are mostly a passive people. We travel in caravans, scavenging for supplies, and trading where we can.}}
:{{Text|say|Nisha|I warned [[Kiro]] that the sethrak would come for us soon enough. We could have been prepared... Maybe now he'll finally listen.}}
:{{Text|say|Nisha|I hope the others made it to safety.}}

==Progression==
{{Unlikely Allies}}
