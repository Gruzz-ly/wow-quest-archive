==Objectives==
Plant 12 [[Vulpera]] [[Banner]]s into dead [[Faithless]].
* [[Vulpera Banner]]s planted (12)
* [[Vulpera Banners]] (provided)

==Description==
I carry this banner into every battle because I want the Faithless to fear it. To fear my people.

If I die in the battlefield, surrounded by Faithless, I will die happy.

On that day, I will not need a burial or prayers. But I will need someone to pick up my banner and carry it into the next battle.

If you are of the same mind, plant these banners into the corpse of every Faithless you slay. Let the survivors know who's coming for them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
It's more fun when they run.

==Completion==
And that's just the start! Now the Faithless know who's coming for 'em.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Ready to Riot]] before heading into the [[Crater of Conquerors]]. Kill Faithless around the crater, then use the banners on their corpses.

On completion:
:{{Text|yell|Nisha|Tremble under the shadow of the vulpera banner, Faithless scum!}}
