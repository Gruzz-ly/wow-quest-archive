==Objectives==
Find Vorrik and free him from his captors.
* [[Vorrik]] rescued

==Description==
It appears the [[Faithless]] broke through our defenses while I was away.

They must be after Vorrik's key. It's the only reason they would have taken him alive.

Please, <name>. You must secure our leader's safe return.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Devoted Defender's Cloak
|Devoted Defender's Band
}}

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
I owe you my life, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Break Their Ranks]] and [[Push Them Back!]] from [[Zissiah]] before heading out. While in the field, you can also kill [[Warlord Zothix]] and pick up [[A Lost Flute]]. Vorrik is in a cage at {{Coords|30|52.6|Vol'dun}}. Upon being freed:
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|I owe you my life, <name>. Meet inside the temple. It's not safe here.}}

Return to the bottom level of the [[Sanctuary of the Devoted]] and speak to Vorrik to turn in.
