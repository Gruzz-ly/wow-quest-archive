==Objectives==
Find [[Zulsan]] in [[Dead Man's Pass]].
*[[Zulsan's Cracked Skull]]

==Description==
When you head up to Dead Man's Pass, be sure to say hello to Zulsan.

He's my best friend, even if he doesn't want to be near me most of de time. Ha!

Seriously, though, he's been up on de cliffs for days. If you find him, convince him to come back down to [[Goldtusk Inn|de inn]]. We need him to restock our breakfast buffet.

Oh, and a completely unrelated question dat has nothing to do with you not being able to find Zulsan and my needing to replace him: How wide is ya head?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Small Azerite Shard]] (100 [[Azerite (resource)]])
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Did you find Zulsan yet?

==Completion==
Thank de spirits you found Zulsan. [[Farraki tribe|Sandfury trolls]] kidnapped de rest of de gang!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|Dead Man's Pass be easy to spot. Just look for de dark, ominous rock formations to de northwest. It gonna be fun!}}

Pick up [[Dirty Work for Dirty Drinks]] before heading to the pass. Zulsan's skull is found inside a small cave in the eastern part of the pass. After looting the skull, Rhan'ka appears outside the cave, holding a banana.
:{{Text|yell|Rhan'ka|Help! You still in dere, <name>? Don't go back to de inn! De Sandfury found us!}}

Upon turning in the quest, Rhan'ka begins wearing Zulsan's skull on his head.
