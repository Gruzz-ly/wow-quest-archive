==Objectives==
Travel with [[Meerah's Caravan]] in search of [[Warguard Rakera]].
* Speak to [[Meerah]]
* Ride Meerah's Caravan

==Description==
Jorak's wounds have healed enough for him to travel.

He has agreed to guide us to de temple.

De sooner we leave, de better. Rakera won't survive in dis desert for long.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|9|70}}
* 8,250 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
Dis temple is not quite what I expected it to be.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|Let's keep moving. Rakera won't survive dis desert for long.}}

Talk to Meerah to resume the voyage:
:[[Dolly]] and [[Dot (alpaca)|Dot]] are strong and dependable. They'll get us where we need to go.
:{{Gossip|We're ready to leave.}}

The caravan sets off southwest again, this time with Kaja, Meerah, and Jorak in the front seat and the player in the back seat.
:{{Text|say|Jorak|We should head south. De temple is somewhere within those hills.}}

After leaving the Withering Gulch, the caravan turns east up the more mountainous road rather than continuing straight south through the [[Valley of Sorrows]].
:{{Text|say|Meerah|Hold on if you can. It's about to get real bumpy!}}
:{{Text|say|Jorak|Dis cannot be de only road we can take...}}
:{{Text|say|Meerah|Oh, it's not. But you don't want to travel through the canyon. It's filled with nightmares.}}
:{{Text|say|Jorak|Those only exist in de mind, not de dunes.}}
:{{Text|say|Meerah|I promise, they're very real. And very dangerous. Not even the [[sethrak]] step foot in the canyon.}}
:''Meerah starts singing.''
:{{Text|say|Meerah|Dolly and Dot are my best friends. They pull my wagon through dunes of sand! They have small teeth and they love to eat...}}
:{{Text|say|Jorak|What is dat screeching coming from your mouth?}}
:{{Text|say|Meerah|Dot and Dolly like it when I sing. It's soothing.}}
:{{Text|say|Jorak|Well, it makes me want to go back to my old ways.}}
:{{Text|say|Meerah|Fine then.}} ''(resumes singing)'' {{Text|say|Dolly and Dot are my best friends. They pull my wagon through dunes of sand!}}

The caravan eventually approaches the [[Temple of Akunda]].
:{{Text|say|Jorak|Dis must be de place. I can see a structure ahead.}}

The wagon heads up to the main terrace of the temple, and the passengers disembark.
