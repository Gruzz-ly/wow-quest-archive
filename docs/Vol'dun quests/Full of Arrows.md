Slay Arlethal Sunwatcher with Shandris.
* [[Arlethal Sunwatcher]] slain {{co|28.7|75.7|Vol'dun}}

==Description==
There's no need for Halford's overly-complicated desert explosion operation. We can take care of Arlethal Sunwatcher right here and now.

He's right over there. We can just... kill him.

You engage him. I'll join in when he least expects it. You ready?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Whenever you're ready, <name>.

==Completion==
Won't Halford be happy to find out that we've done his work for him?

==Notes==
Aggro:
:{{text|yell|Arlethal Sunwatcher|Alliance? Here in Zandalar?}}

At ~50% health, Shandris will finally drop out of stealth and Rapid Fire him full of arrows.

Death:
:{{text|say|Arlethal Sunwatcher|The Reliquary will avenge me...}}
