==Objectives==
Fill that [[ranishu]]'s belly.
*Use the [[Lectric Frequency Modulator]]
*Feed [[lasher]]s to the ranishu

==Description==
[[Captive Ranishu|These little fellas]] are ravenous whirlwinds of devouring destruction. When they get going, they consume anything in their path, without even stopping! When sated, they discharge power from them little 'lectric zingers on their heads!

Then they nap.

Lucky for us, we found just the right frequency to control their tiny bug brains. Hit that device, and you can take your own little zapper out for a spin... literally!

Make sure ya bring it back full, so we can keep our rigs charged!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
All juiced up?

==Completion==
Hey! Not bad for your first time! They're so ugly they're cute, aren't they?

==Notes==
Interacting with the [[Lectric Frequency Modulator]] next to Rozzy puts the player in control of a [[Voracious Ranishu]], which has the following two abilities:
*{{Abilities|Roll Dash|id=274584|Expel electrical energy to dash forward through the air.|icon=ability_thunderking_lightningwhip}}
*{{Abilities|Shock Launch|id=274579|A powerful electrical discharge launches the ranishu into the air.|icon=spell_nature_unrelentingstorm}}

The [[Carapace Ridge]] area becomes phased to become inhabited by [[Cracked Pricklevine]]s and [[Ridge Lasher]]s, as well as tornadoes, [[Caromzar Cactus|Caromzar Cacti]], and [[Big Mama]]. Consume Pricklevines and Lashers by rolling past them to fill up the quest's progress bar (Ridge Lashers grant 3% progress, while Cracked Pricklevines grant around 5%) and avoid the cacti and Big Mama, which knock the player backwards or throws them a significant distance, respectively. The static tornadoes around the ridge launch the ranishu in specific directions, some of which allow the ranishu to reach the outcroppings above the ridge. Should the player find their way to one of the higher outcroppings through use of the tornadoes and their Roll Dash and Shock Launch abilities, they can find the [[Golden Lash]], a lasher that instantly grants 50% quest progress all on its own when consumed.

If the player tries to leave the Carapace Ridge area before completing the quest objective, the ranishu will instantly be teleported back in. Upon completely filling the objective bar, the ranishu automatically travels back into the ranishu enclose next to Rozzy, ejects the player, and then despawns.

==Trivia==
During the beta, this quest was named '''Ranishu Romp'''.
