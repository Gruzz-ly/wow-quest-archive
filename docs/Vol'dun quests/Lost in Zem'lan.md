==Objectives==
Find [[Meeki]].
*Find Meeki in the [[Port of Zem'lan]].

==Description==
Legends say that a mountain of treasure sits deep inside the Port of Zem'lan, pillaged from every corner of [[Azeroth]]. But it's guarded by unkillable, eternal monsters.

No [[vulpera]] or exile has ever stolen treasure from the Port of Zem'lan and made it out alive.

My [[caravan]] was going to be the first. Our [[scout]], Meeki snuck in to figure out a route, but he never came back.

It would be wisest for you to leave here and never return. But, if you go into the port, please find Meeki.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|1|94}}
*1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Meeki has been stabbed multiple times. He is clearly dead.>

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|[[Vigori]]|T-t-thank you, <name>. M-m-meeki is a good friend.}}
:{{Text|say|Norah|If you find treasure along the way, bring that back too. We can make it worth your trouble.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Ahna]]|Everybody hush. Meeki's fine and I'm trying to sleep back here.}}

Head to the southernmost pier in the Port of Zem'lan to find Meeki lying dead in a puddle of blood.{{Coords|35.4|83.4|Vol'dun}} [[First Mate Jamboya]] is strung up on a nearby pillar.

On completion:
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|Ya friend's dead, <name>. Dis be no place for mortals.}}
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|Death be de only mercy dat Zem'lan has to offer. And even dat be denied to most.}}

Talk to Jamboya for the next quest.
