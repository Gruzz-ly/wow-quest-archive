==Objectives==
Kill Grozztok within [[Atul'Aman]].
* [[Grozztok the Blackheart]] slain

==Description==
A group of us were dropped off here and left to die.

Our first night at camp, I was jolted from sleep by de gurgling cries of my fellow exiles. [[General Jakra'zet|Jakra'zet]] sent [[assassin]]s to our camp, looking for [[Warguard Rakera|Rakera]].

Their leader, Grozztok, came for me, but Rakera intervened.

She chased him into de dunes, but dat was days ago.

If you cross paths with Grozztok, don't hesitate to drive a blade into his black heart.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|38|80}}
* 28,550 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Jorak may be our key to finding Rakera.

==Completion==
You saw Jakra'zet? What would he be doing trying to break into de old pyramid?

Whatever de reason, it can't be good.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Stolen Satchels]] before heading out. On accept:
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|If what dis exile says is true, den you must investigate. But use caution. Jakra'zet may still be near.}}

Head west to Atul'Aman and climb the stairs to find General Jakra'zet and Grozztok the Blackheart in front of the pyramid's magically sealed entrance.
:{{Text|say|Grozztok the Blackheart|We can't get in. The door is sealed with magic we've never seen before.}}
:{{Text|say|General Jakra'zet|Silence! We are not alone...}}
:''Jakra'zet stuns the player for 6 seconds with some kind of spell.''
:{{Text|say|Grozztok the Blackheart|You made a mistake coming to dese dunes. [[Princess Talanji|De princess]] can't save you now.}}
:{{Text|say|General Jakra'zet|Grozztok, deal with dese trespassers! Do not fail me again.}}

The stun wears off, Jakra'zet teleports away, and Grozztok attacks the player. Upon killing the Blackheart:
:{{Text|say|Grozztok the Blackheart|You are no better than me. My blood... is on your hands.}}

While in Atul'Aman, you can pick up the side quest [[Ranah's Wrench (quest)]]. After finishing with Atul'Aman, head back to the Withering Gulch, where Kaja and Jorak are now standing next to [[Meerah's Caravan]]. Completing both Grozztok the Blackheart and Stolen Satchels rewards the "Dangers in the Desert" portion of [[Secrets in the Sands]].
