==Objectives==
Obtain [[:Morrison's Master Key]] and use it to free 8 [[Vulpera Captive]]s.
*[[Morrison's Master Key]]
*Vulpera Captives freed (8)

==Description==
None of the keys you found were the right fit! We're going to need another plan...

I've heard that [[Overseer Morrison]] has a master key that can open any lock in the compound. It's dangerous, but I need you to get that key for me!

You'll find her running the mining operation inside the cave. Once you get the key, make sure you rescue any [[vulpera]] captives that you find.

Once you've rescued my friends, meet me back here and release me. Good luck!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|38|80}}
*20,560 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
You keep your end of the bargain, and I'll keep mine.

==Completion==
Sure am glad to see you again, <name>. A reliable rescuer has been hard to come by.

I'll pay you as promised, I but{{sic}} won't be sticking around for long!

==Notes==
Head into the [[Redrock Mines]] and find Overseer Morrison in the northeast part of the mine.{{Coords|49.6|88.2|Vol'dun}} After killing her and taking the key, use it to free [[Vulpera Captive]]s around the mine. Upon being freed, they may say one of the following:
*{{Text|say|Don't know who you are or what you want, but thanks.}}
*{{Text|say|I owe you one, stranger.}}
*{{Text|say|I sure am happy to see you.}}
*{{Text|say|I will repay this debt. You have my word.}}
*{{Text|say|No time for introductions. I'm not spending another minute in this mine.}}
*{{Text|say|You're a lifesaver, really. I would have died down here!}}

While in the mines, you can also take the opportunity to kill the [[vignette]] [[Azer'tor]].

After freeing the captives, head back to Keerin outside. Upon completion, the door to his cage swings open.
:{{Text|say|Keerin|Let's hope I can outrun these outlaws!}}
He then immediately runs off a short distance northeast before permanently despawning.
