==Objectives==
Torch the slave auction sites in [[Slithering Gulch]].
* West slave market burned
* Central slave market burned
* East slave market burned
* [[Kiro's Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
Don't mistake my caution for hesitance, <name>. I will defend the [[vulpera]] with my dying breath... I'd just prefer to avoid taking that breath today.

While [[Nisha]] rushes to the front line, I work behind them to ensure our success.

Meet me at the [[Faithless]] beast pens if you'd like to help.

Oh, and take this torch. You'll be going through their marketplace, where they auction off slaves.

Starting a few well-placed and metaphorically poignant fires along your route will make things easier for all of us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
The fires are spreading quickly. Let's hurry, while the Faithless are distracted.

==Notes==
On accept, Kiro enters [[Stealth]], moves up the ramp, and disappears.
:{{Text|say|Kiro|I'll sabotage their cannons on the upper levels while you burn the gulch. Meet me at their best pens when you're done.}}

Head down east through the Slithering Gulch, throwing the torch at the [[Jar of Oil|Jars of Oil]] in the three slave markets along the way. You can also find a [[Tattered Note (Vol'dun)|Tattered Note]] at {{Coords|54.2|34.2|Vol'dun}}, which offers [[Tattered Note (quest)]].

When you're done, meet with Kiro on the ramp leading up to the [[Feeding Pits (Vol'dun)|Feeding Pits]] in the east. On complete:
:{{Text|say|Kiro|The Faithless keep wild beasts penned in nearby. Looks like a good opportunity to me.}}
