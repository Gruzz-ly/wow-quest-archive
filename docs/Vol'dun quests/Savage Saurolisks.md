==Objectives==
Slay 8 [[Scaleclaw Saurolisk]]s in the [[Arid Basin]].
*[[Scaleclaw Saurolisk]] slain (8)

==Description==
Please, help me! I'm trapped in dis box and I can't make it out alone!

I came here to collect eggs. I knew it was a bad idea, but I thought I could sneak around and grab de eggs before de [[saurolisk]]s noticed.

I was wrong...

I hid underneath dis crate to avoid being eaten!

Can you clear out de saurolisks and tell me when it's safe to come out?

Please, don't leave me here!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Are de saurolisks gone yet?

==Completion==
De saurolisks are all gone and it's safe to come out? Thank you so much! I never thought I'd make it out of here alive!

==Notes==
Scaleclaw Saurolisks are found all over the Arid Basin. The [[vignette]] [[Scaleclaw Broodmother]] also counts as a Scaleclaw Saurolisk for the purposes of this objective.

Upon completion of both Savage Saurolisks and [[They Might Be Delicious]], Junji emerges from his crate...
:{{Text|say|Junji|I'm free! I can't believe it!}}
:{{Text|say|Junji|I'll make sure to tell everyone at the camp how you saved me!}}
...and runs up the stairs to the [[Scorched Sands Outpost]] to stand next to [[Sezahjin]].
