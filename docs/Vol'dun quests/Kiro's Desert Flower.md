==Completion==
:{{Text|say|Kiro| ... Right, I made a note here about the red ones. I even circled it. In red. Thank you for your help. That may not have ended well, otherwise.}}

==Notes==
In the [[Verdant Plateau]], speak with Kiro
:This a rare sight in this part of the world. The leaves of the red lasher are said to have mystical healing properties.

:I wish to collect some, but removing them will release the plant's scent into the air. It will surely attract attention from the local fauna.

:Protect me while I harvest it. I will reward you accordingly.

:{{Gossip|I am ready.}}
:''Kiro walks towards the lasher.''
:{{Text|say|Kiro|This may take some time. Removing the leaves is a delicate process.}}

[[Sandstinger Collector]]s and then a [[Sandstinger Drone]] appear.

:{{Text|say|Kiro|Hmm, these leaves are a bit more stubborn than anticipated... but I think I'm making progress.}}

Combinations of the sandstingers attack.

:{{Text|say|Kiro|I've nearly got the sample I need! Just a bit more time...}}

:''Crimson Gnarlvine wakes up, and Kiro moves away.''
:{{Text|yell|Kiro|Look out!}}
