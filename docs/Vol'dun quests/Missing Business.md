==Objectives==
Rescue 7 Sable Polecats.
*[[Sable Polecat]] revived (7)
*[[Sandstinger Remedy]] (provided)

==Description==
Poor little [[Coda]] has been in quite the tizzy since his friends vanished.

I found him here, out cold, after a sting from one of those [[Venomous Sandstinger|awful wasps]]. Just a tiny bit of our sandstinger remedy got Coda right up, though!

Take some with you, and keep an eye out for other little ones out there.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|Poda
}}
You will also receive:
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Did you find them all?

==Completion==
Oh thank goodness! We'll have to keep these little guys away from anything with a big mean stinger out here. Man, I'm going to be busy.

If you could protect Coda's little brother, that would help us out a lot!

This is Poda!

==Notes==
Sable Polecats are found around the [[Prickly Grove]], mostly on top of rocks around the edges of the grove. Upon using the remedy on them, they get back on their feet and run off.

On completion, Vivi and Coda run back towards the [[Vulpera Hideaway]]. Vivi briefly stops, turns around, and waves at the player before continuing.
