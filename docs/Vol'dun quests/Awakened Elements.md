==Objectives==
Investigate the disturbance.
*Disturbance to the north investigated
*[[Enraged Azermental]] slain

==Description==
It seems that all of this infernal blasting and hammering has stirred up... something.

I heard some screaming from over in that direction.

<He gestures vaguely to the North.>

If you could go take care of the situation, that would be most appreciated.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|38|80}}
*20,560 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you remove the impediment?

==Completion==
That's better. Not sure how we were going to turn a profit if we had to keep replacing workers.

==Notes==
Head to {{Coords|25.6|64.8|Vol'dun}} to find the [[Enraged Azermental]] submerged in the ground, with a Blue Sandstorm raging above it. On approach, the Azermental emerges from the ground and attacks the player. During combat, avoid or destroy the [[Azerite Shard]]s that the creature creates. After killing it, return to Nerin to turn in.

==Progression==
{{The Cracked Coast}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
