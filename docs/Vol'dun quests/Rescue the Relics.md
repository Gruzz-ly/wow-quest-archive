==Objectives==
Collect 8 Ahjani Relics in [[Zul'Ahjin]].
* [[Relic of the Keepers]] (8)

==Description==
According to the information you brought us, we should be adding those relics to our collection.

Explore the ruins and see if you can find any of these "tokens of affection" the [[sethrak]] may have left for their [[Keepers (sethrak)|Keepers]].

Better we find hands that will cherish them, than ones that will destroy.

Plus, add a little time, and anything becomes interesting... to the right people.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Did you find the relics?

==Completion==
Perfect. The power of nostalgia is fascinating. These relics will hold great sentimental value. The monetary value won't be bad, either.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Expedite the Excavation]] before heading out. While in the ruins you can also pick up [[Exterminate the Vermin]], but doing so requires you to be in Avatar of the Desert form, so interact with the [[Scepter of Prescience]] before leaving.

==Progression==
{{A City of Secrets}}

==Patch changes==
