==Objectives==
Bury 8 Remote-Detonation Deathbombs.
* [[Remote-Detonation Deathbomb]] buried (8)

==Description==
While we can handle the assassination portion on our own, I suppose there's no harm in distributing these [[Gnome|gnomish]] bombs around the enemy's digsite.

They're designed to be detonated remotely, so try to bury them in the sand where they won't be noticed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
I hope you left them somewhere inconspicuous.

==Completion==
It's done? Good. Let's get a move on.
