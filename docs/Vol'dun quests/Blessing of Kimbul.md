==Objectives==
Acquire the [[Ring of Tides (quest item)|Ring of Tides]].
*Trial of Wisdom completed
*[[Ring of Tides (quest item)]]

==Description==
The entrance to [[Temple of Kimbul|the temple]] is sealed by a magical barrier.

According to my scrolls, the barrier can only be lowered by one who has gained the Ring of Tides.

There is a statue somewhere in the temple grounds with the power to bestow the ring, but the ruins are overrun with jungle [[spider]]s. [[Tulu]] and I are not strong enough to explore the lower ruins ourselves.

If you can gain the Ring of Tides and enter the temple, we may finally be able to face the [[naga]] head on!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Ring of Tides]]
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
The statue is somewhere within the temple ruins.

==Completion==
Now that you have the Ring of Tides, you'll be able to enter the temple and make contact with the [[loa]].

Pick up [[All Webbed Up]] and [[Jungleweb Infestation]] before heading out. On accept:
:{{Text|say|Teekcha|The statue is somewhere within the temple ruins...}}

Head to {{Coords|61.2|15|Vol'dun}} to find the [[Statue of Eraka No Kimbul]] inside a building, along with three wall [[Tablet]]s each telling of a different lesson of [[Kimbul]]. To pass the Trial of Wisdom and acquire the Ring of Tides, the player must correctly answer a series of five questions posed by the statue. Each question has six possible answers, of which only one is correct. The correct answers can be gleaned from the texts of the three Tablets.

;Northeast Tablet
:Thus it was heard:
:On one occasion the great loa addressed a group of his followers and spake thus:
:'Just as the jaguar stalks her prey for days at a time, even so the wise one acts with patience in all matters. The foolish are dragged through life by craving and emotion, but fools do not survive long in the jungle.
:Just as the jungle bestows the gift of life, even so does it bestow the touch of death. Those with vision see that nature does not belong to them, but they to it. These are they who respect the natural order and take only what is required to live.'
:Upon hearing these words, the followers of Eraka no Kimbul were filled with patience and respect.

;Southeast Tablet
:Thus it was heard:
:On one occasion the great loa addressed a group of his followers and spake thus:
:'Just as a tiger leaps across rock and chasm while engaged in the hunt, even so the courageous one wastes no time cowering in the face of fear. Act with courage in all matters and you will not lose sight of your prey.
:Just as decay devours the blossoms of the jungle, age devours the strength of youth. The source of power is not strength, but an indomitable will that age cannot destroy.'
:Upon hearing these words, the followers of Eraka no Kimbul were filled with courage and conviction.

;Southwest Tablet
:Thus it was heard:
:On one occasion the great loa addressed a group of his followers and spake thus:
:'Just as a king does not trade away his greatest treasure for a mere handful of dirt, even so the honorable one does not barter his integrity for wealth or fame. Live a life of honor, and it will be a life well-lived.
:Just as canyons are carved by the constant flow of water, so too are all great deeds born of perseverance. Live with unyielding determination and failure will never defeat you.'
:Upon hearing these words, the followers of Eraka no Kimbul were filled with virtue and dedication.

;Questions

Should the player correctly answer all five questions, the statue will state:
:<A mysterious voice echoes within your mind.>
:'You have been judged worthy.
:Receive the blessing of Eraka no Kimbul. The Loa of Tigers awaits you.'

The [[Ring of Tides (quest item)]] will then appear, floating above the basin at the bottom of the statue. Loot it and return to Teekcha.
