On accept:
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|I boiled de blood and stingers ya collected and mixed dem in our ceremonial Goldtusk goblet... It's a pineapple. Don't eat it. We only have one.}}

Upon drinking from the Boiled Scorpid Blood, the player falls under the effects of Goldtusk Visions for 20 seconds, making them [[tipsy]] and temporarily giving them a spectral appearance. Rhan'ka walks over to the center of the inn as the ghosts of [[Grenja]], [[Man'zul]], [[Volni]], and [[Zulsan]] become visible and float toward the player.
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|Ah, de blood tastes sweet... Drink it and see what I see, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|See ya new brothas and sistas of de Goldtusk Gang!}}

The ghosts gather around the player and salute them, before floating back to their individual places around the inn.
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|[[Zuldazar]] betrayed us. Exiled us like outsiders. But we never betrayed each other. Goldtusks stay true.}}

For that brief moment, the ghosts have the following gossip text:
:Welcome to the gang, <name>.

When the Goldtusk Visions effect wears off, the player vomits and returns to being sober.
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|Heh, first time's always tough drinkin' de ritual scorpid blood. Let it out. It be goin' down easier next time.}}

On completion:
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|Welcome to de gang, <name>. We in dis together.}}

Man'zul, Volni, and Zulsan now each offer various quests to help out around the inn.
