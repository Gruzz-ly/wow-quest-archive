==Objectives==
Seek out [[Miju]] in southern [[Zuldazar]] to begin your final trial.

==Description==
It appears you are finished here, <name>. Thank you again for getting my book back.

But between you and I, this was the easy part. Just wait till you meet the grandmaster.

If you haven't noticed already, you'll need a special quill to invoke those contracts. And he'll be the one who shows you how to craft it.

His name is Miju and he lives out on an island off the southern coast of Zuldazar. Good luck, <name>!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What's this then? Another novice come to learn the ways of blood-scribing?

Very well, for which contract do you need a quill?

<You explain to Miju that you've learned all four contracts and need a quill to invoke all of them.>

ALL FOUR?! Oh my, it's been... let's see here...

<Miju beings mumbling to himself.>

Too long I suppose. But yes. I still know the recipe. Your trial awaits you then.
