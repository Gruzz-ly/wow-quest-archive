==Objectives==
Fly to the [[Sanctuary of the Devoted]].
* [[Serrik's Pterrordax|Pterrordax]] mounted

==Description==
I believe this is one of the [[Keepers (sethrak)|Keepers]]' keys! Only [[Vorrik]] would know for sure.

We need to head to the temple at once.

My [[pterrordax]] can take us there when you're ready, but we need to hurry.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|9|70}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
We cannot let the [[Faithless]] take this temple!

==Notes==
When the player mounts Serrik's Pterrordax, it immediately sets off northwest with the player and Serrik on its back. [[Bladeguard Kaja]] and [[Warguard Rakera]] follow just behind on their own pterrordaxes. On the journey to the Sanctuary, Serrik offers some more information:
:{{Text|say|Serrik|Our temple is the last bastion against the Faithless.}}
:{{Text|say|Serrik|Long ago, we lived as one, as [[Sethraliss|our loa]] would have wanted.}}
:{{Text|say|Serrik|Since [[Emperor Korthek|Korthek]]'s betrayal, the Faithless have brought war upon these lands.}}
:{{Text|say|Serrik|He leads them in their fight, searching for the remaining keys that will allow him to break the barrier around [[Atul'Aman]], and use [[Mythrax|what's within]] to conquer all of [[Zuldazar]].}}
:{{Text|say|Serrik|We will do whatever it takes to stop him.}}

When the group arrives at the southern part of the [[Terrace of the Devoted]] and dismounts, [[Zissiah]] runs out of the temple to greet them.
:{{Text|yell|Zissiah|Serrik, it's good that you have returned! The Faithless have taken Vorrik!}}

Talk to Serrik to turn in.
