==Description==
Before de curse, we were a loyal crew to a good captain. But de curse corrupted [[Pirate-King Zem'lan]], made him cruel and controlling.

Now, he treats us more like slaves than crewmates. Forced to fight and die for his gain, no treasure for ourselves. No speakin' up without punishment.

Well, us four, we ain't gonna be his slaves no more.

A few of de crew hold onto de idols dat Zem'lan used to curse us. Kill dem and take de idols. I wanna see if we can break dem. Just for fun.
