==Objectives==
Ride [[First Mate Jamboya|Jamboya]]'s [[Jamboya's Boat|boat]] to the shore and lead the pirates to [[Camp Lastwind]].
*Jamboya's boat ridden

==Description==
[[Pirate-King Zem'lan]] was right about one thing: he won't stay dead for long.

We gotta take our treasure and get out of here while we got de chance.

We can take de boat, but we'll need a place to hide out for awhile. Are your [[vulpera]] friends open to housin' a few stowaways?

<First Mate Jamboya motions to the piles of treasure in his boat.>

Clearly, we can pay dem for their trouble.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|9|70}}
*8,230 [[XP]]
*+10 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
What have you gotten us into, <name>? We asked you to find [[Meeki|our friend]], not bring monsters into our camp.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|All right, crew. Grab de treasure and get in de boat!}}

Interact with the boat to set sail from the [[Golden Isle]] back to shore with Jamboya, [[Gunner Bosanya|Bosanya]], [[Jukanga the Snitch|Jukanga]], and [[Quartermaster Tulmac|Tulmac]].
:{{Text|say|Quartermaster Tulmac|All hand hoy! Double speed to da coast!}}
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|We done it, me hearties. We finally be free of Zem'lan!}}
:{{Text|say|Jukanga the Snitch|Free to sail da open seas.}}
:{{Text|say|Gunner Bosanya|Free to pillage where we please.}}
:{{Text|say|Quartermaster Tulmac|Free to keep our treasure for ourselves.}}
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|Aye. But we gonna need to hide out for a little while first.}}
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|Zem'lan's lackeys gonna be lookin' for us on de seas.}}
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|<Name> knows where a vulpera crew be nearby. I say we join dem for now, 'til dis blows over.}}
:{{Text|say|Quartermaster Tulmac|Ya got us dis far. We be followin' ya.}}

The boat stops at a shallow inlet on the southeastern side of the [[Port of Zem'lan]]. The crew disembarks and begin following the player around with treasure chests in their arms.
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|Lead de way to de vulpera camp, <name>. We'll haul de treasure.}}

Head back to [[Camp Lastwind]]. Upon entering the camp, [[Vigori]] runs up behind [[Norah]], cowering in fear:
:{{Text|say|Vigori|S-s-skeletons! N-n-norah, kill them!}}
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|Belay dat! We come to parley peace with ya.}}
:{{Text|say|Norah|I'm listening...}}

Talk to Norah to turn in. Upon completion:
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|De Pirate-King Zem'lan killed ya friend. We mutineed against Zem'lan and stole his treasure.}}
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|We be lookin' for a new crew to join. If you be havin' us, we'll share our treasure with ya.}}
:{{Text|say|Jukanga the Snitch|Only problem be dat da treasure be cursed.}}
:{{Text|say|Norah|A little curse never kept the vulpera from a worthy treasure... You got more of that somewhere?}}
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|Aye. Dere be a whole island of it off de coast. More treasure than you can count.}}
:{{Text|say|Norah|Well then...}}
:{{Text|say|Norah|Welcome to the caravan!}}
:{{Text|say|Norah|Rest and enjoy camp tonight. Tomorrow, we'll plan out how we're gonna get the rest of that treasure.}}
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|Aye, aye, captain.}}

Jamboya and the pirates move to the northern corner of the camp and can afterward be found standing or sitting around their pile of treasure. This concludes the Port of Zem'lan side chain. Norah offers [[A Strange Delivery]], a breadcrumb to [[Whistlebloom Oasis]].
