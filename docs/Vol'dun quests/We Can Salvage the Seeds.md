==Objectives==
Plant 8 Thistlevine Seeds in [[Fertile Soil (Vol'dun)|Fertile Soil]] within the [[Withering Gulch|Withering Terrace]]{{sic}}.
* [[Thistlevine Seeds]] planted (8)

==Description==
I've studied the flora within the terrace extensively. Once a thistlevine completely dries out, it's too late for the plant to be saved.

Its seeds are still viable, however. Under the right conditions, they can be used to cultivate new, healthy thistlevines.

Salvage seeds from the carnivorous thistlevines that can no longer be saved, and plant them within the fertile mounds of dirt.

The thistlevine plant is extremely quick to sprout, so the terrace should be filled with seedlings in no time!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Thistlevine seeds need three things to thrive: water, fertile soil, and lots of sunshine.

==Completion==
Look how much you've helped bring this place to life! You've got quite the green thumb.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Let it Flow]] and [[Wither Without Water]] before embarking. Kill [[Carnivorous Thistlevine]]s and [[Carnivorous Seedling]]s and loot them for their Thistlevine Seeds, then plant those in piles of [[Fertile Soil (Vol'dun)|Fertile Soil]] across the terrace, causing [[Thistlevine Seedling]]s to spring up.
