A deal's a deal. You got the stingers for me, so here's that big batch of honey I promised.

De drinks are almost ready and dey really add the{{sic}} perfect flavor.

==Notes==
Head back to Rhan'ka at the inn. The inn has been trashed by the Sandfury, and when the player arrives, Rhan'ka is cowering inside a cauldron in a corner of the cave.
:{{Text|yell|Rhan'ka|No need to come in here, Sandfury! Nothin' here but us bananas.}}
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|Oh, is dat you, <name>? De Sandfury didn't follow you, did dey?}}

After turning in [[The Great Cranium Caper]], [[Gozda'kun the Slaver (quest)]], and Unconventional Aromatics, Rhan'ka emerges from the cauldron, walks over to a corner of the inn, and places a cup of [[Boiled Scorpid Blood]] on a rock.
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|It be safe to come out now?}}
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|[[Grenja]]! [[Volni]]! [[Man'zul]]! You be back! De gang's all here!}}
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|You're right! It be time to we brought <name> into de gang officially. Prepare de ritual!}}
