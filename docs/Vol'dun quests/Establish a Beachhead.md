==Objectives==
Plant the [[Alliance]] [[banner]] and establish your base in [[Vol'dun]].
* Plant the [[Alliance Banner (Vol'dun)|Alliance Banner]] {{co|37.5|35.3|Vol'dun}}

==Description==
I won't allow [[Private Leonard]]'s sacrifice to be in vain. Let's get our men out here and fortify this place up before those... "[[sethrak]]" decide to come back.

Here, plant this banner somewhere visible so the [[Wind's Redemption|ship]] knows its{{sic}} safe. That platform over next to the dock should do the trick.

==Completion==
The crew's setting up our camp in record time! Good work securing the beachhead.

Now, about [[Sergeant Ermey]]...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Sergeant Ermey|I'll be out hunting for leads on [[Private James|James]] while you're calling in the ship. I'm not going to let him stay in the clutches of those slippery bastards.}}

Leaving the building, the sethrak enemies are now dead. Plant the banner at {{co|37.56|35.32|Vol'dun}} and a short cutscene plays as the ship pulls into berth and the Alliance forces disembark. The cutscene may sometimes not play out.

==Progression==
{{Vol'dun Foothold}}
