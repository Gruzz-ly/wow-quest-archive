==Objectives==
Speak to Vorrik and uncover the significance of [[Sulthis' Stone]].
* Speak to [[Vorrik]]

==Description==
[[Serrik]] mentioned you might have uncovered something of significance at [[Zul'Ahjin]]?

We don't have much time, I'm afraid.

What is it you have found?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
Thanks to you, we now have two of the keys. [[Emperor Korthek|Korthek]] still holds the third.

If we can get our hands on that key, then [[Mythrax]] will remain sealed in his tomb forever.

==Notes==
Speak to Vorrik:
:The [[Faithless]] will not take this temple.
:{{Gossip|<Give Vorrik Sulthis' Stone.>}}

A cutscene begins:
:''Vorrik is conversing with [[Bladeguard Kaja]], the player, and [[Warguard Rakera]] in the [[Sanctuary of the Devoted]].
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|This key belongs to the first [[Keepers (sethrak)|Keeper]]. His name was [[Sulthis]], and he died at the hands of Korthek.}}
:''The camera shifts away from the sanctuary to instead show Mythrax the Unraveler invading ancient Vol'dun. He kills a group of [[sethrak]] with his shadow magic before roaring ferociously.
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|Long ago, Mythrax the Unraveler descended upon our lands. He slaughtered all in his path, [[troll]] and sethrak alike.}}
:''The scene changes to a sand-filled chamber below [[Atul'Aman]]. [[Sethraliss]] strikes the killing blow against Mythrax with her scimitar, but is crushed when the creature's corpse falls on top of her. The camera zooms in on the disc in the back wall, which has sustained large cracks.
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|Our [[loa]] sacrificed herself to save us from that monstrosity. She struck the [[C'Thrax]] down, but not before it was able to destroy the disc at the heart of Atul'Aman.}}
:''The scene returns to the Sanctuary of the Devoted.
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|After witnessing his destruction firsthand, we knew that something must be done to prevent anyone from raising Mythrax again.}}
:''Vorrik, Sulthis, and Korthek are seen creating the magical barrier at Atul'Aman's entrance.
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|Although immensely powerful, Sulthis could not create the barrier alone. Korthek and I lent him our aid, and together, we sealed Mythrax within the great pyramid.}}
:''Vorrik begins walking to the western part of the sanctuary. Kaja, the player, and Rakera walk with him.
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|As the sands continued to spread, Korthek grew hungry for war. He plotted to unearth the C'Thrax and use him as a weapon to conquer the continent.}}
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|A weapon... dis must be what [[General Jakra'zet|Jakra'zet]] is after! A C'Thrax...}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|We need to warn [[Princess Talanji|de princess]].}}
:''Vorrik, Kaja, Rakera, and the player walk into the topmost chamber of the sanctuary.
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|Korthek raised an army of like-minded sethrak, and they began to slaughter those who opposed them... Sulthis was the first to fall, but not before safeguarding his key.}}
:''Vorrik places [[Sulthis' Keystone]] above the chamber's central altar, next to [[Vorrik's Keystone|his own]].
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|Those of us still loyal to Sethraliss were forced out of our home and into hiding. We have been fighting the Faithless ever since.}}
