Mojambo is sitting on a [[krolusk]] in the center of the [[Scorched Sands Arena]]. He is initially unattackable, but throwing [[Tongo's Head]] at him will cause him to become {{rep|hostile}} and attackable.
:{{Text|say|Mojambo|Tongo... killed by an outsider? I must have overestimated him!}}
:{{Text|yell|Mojambo|I'll have to murder you myself along with the rest of your foolish friends!}}

Upon killing Mojambo:
:{{Text|say|Mojambo|Not like this... no... argghh...}}

As soon as Mojambo dies, the [[Zandalari Exile]]s in the arena flee north. The [[Scorched Sands Outcast]]s chase after them for a short distance before runing back. Return to Razgaji to turn in.
