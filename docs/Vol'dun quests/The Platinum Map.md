==Objectives==
Find the Platinum Map's maker in [[Vol'dun]].
* [[Platinum Map]]

==Description==
Nestled within the fissures of the deposit, you find a small disc of pure platinum.

Dusting it off, you see etchings in its surface and recognize it as a map of Vol'dun. You also notice what appears to be a small cave in the south west that has been circled.

Whoever left this apparently has a wealth of knowledge of the metal and wants to be found.

==Completion==
It is good to meet you. My name is Ta'mil. Please, take a seat, we have much to discuss.

A long time ago, I used to be a [[miner]] and a [[shaman]].

I would tell de [[Elemental spirit|spirits]] what metals I needed and why I needed it, and ask them for what dey could spare. Dey would bring what dey could to de surface for me.

<The warmth from his voice leaves as his face turns somber.>

Now de spirits tell me I am not long for [[Azeroth|dis world]]. Even in dis desert, I feel de cold creeping into my bones.
