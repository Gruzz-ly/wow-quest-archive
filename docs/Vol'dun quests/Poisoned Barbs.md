==Objectives==
Collect 8 Saltspine Barbs in [[Bonetrail Gulch]].
* [[Saltspine Barb]] (8)

==Description==
I'm surprised [[Vorrik|this snake-man]] is alive, let alone able to speak. Look at this! 

<[[Sergeant Ermey|Ermey]] holds up a needle-like barb.>

It looks like it came from one of those giant insects wandering about in the bottom of the gulch. I'll bet my stripes it's poisoned.

You know what they say, that which kills can also cure.

Go get a few more of these barbs. I bet if I mix it in with that cactus he's wanting we will get a good antivenom to treat his wounds.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Got those barbs for me?

==Completion==
That's the stuff! Hope you didn't get stung too.
