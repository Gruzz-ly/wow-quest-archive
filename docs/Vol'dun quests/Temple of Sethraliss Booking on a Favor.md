==Objectives==
Recover the Tome of Oblivion from the [[Temple of Sethraliss]].

* [[Tome of Oblivion]]
* Restore the [[Avatar of Sethraliss]]

==Description==
When the [[Faithless]] came to power, we [[Devoted]] fled our sacred temple and took shelter here.

However, in the midst of our exodus, many of us were forced to abandon some of our belongings.

I myself left a tome that is used to learn the Oblivion contract. If you wish to proceed with the trials, you must retrieve that book for me, <name>.

I trust you won't disappoint me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|93|60|}}
* 35,700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'll admit, I'm a bit embarrassed to have left it behind. An oversight that I still regret to this day.

==Completion==
I'm relieved you were able to retrieve it. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
The quest item is located in the room before the final boss encounter of the dungeon, on the right side.
