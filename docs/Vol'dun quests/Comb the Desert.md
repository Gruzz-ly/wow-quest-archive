On accept:
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Kelsey, you're our eyes in the sky. Report back if you see anything.}}
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|10-4, High Commander! Let's ride!}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Shandris, keep a low profile. Stay in the shadows... if you can find any.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|I won't be far.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|<Name>, let's move.}}

On the move:
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|It's tempting to overlook Sunwatcher and the Reliquary. I mean really... they are archaeologists, after all.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|But that would be a mistake. Those scoundrels are notorious for digging up powerful artifacts and unleashing them against their enemies.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|What they can't use, they sell, which funds the Horde's war efforts.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Light willing, we'll put a stop to that.}}

At the target:
