Take [[Azala]] to the Terrace of the Devoted in [[Vol'dun]]. Make sure to call for her if she is not present when you get there.
* Visit [[Terrace of the Devoted]]
* [[Casteless Zandalari Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
De caretakers are always talking about how de [[sethrak]] attack [[caravan]]s... but dey say dat de sethrak and de [[Zandalari]] used to be friends!

I heard dat dere are some sethrak who still want to be friends, and dat dey have a [[loa]] who wants peace more dan anything!

Can you take me to meet de sethrak and deir loa? I want to meet dem for myself!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]

==Progress==
Do you think de sethrak queen is pretty? Do you think she has shinies?

==Completion==
[[Sethraliss]] seems wise... but very scary, too.

...Are you sure we can't go back for de shiny?

==Notes==
;Arriving at the top of [[Sanctuary of the Devoted]]:
:{{text|say|Azala|<name>, look at dat!}}
:''Azala runs toward the [[Vorrik's Keystone|keystone]].''
:{{text|say|Azala|Can you give me a boost? I just want to touch it...}}
:''Vorrik runs from behind, yelling.''
:{{text|yell|Vorrik|Child! Get away from the keystone!}}
:{{text|yell|Azala|Ahh! I wasn't going to take it, I swear!}}
:{{text|say|Vorrik|That keystone is a powerful artifact, and it is important to my people. You shall not lay a hand on it.}}
:''An [[Avatar of Sethraliss]] spawns on the keystone.''
:{{text|say|Avatar of Sethraliss|Vorrik, do not scare the child.}}
:{{text|say|Vorrik|Sethraliss! You must conserve your strength. I can handle this pilferer!}}
:{{text|say|Avatar of Sethraliss|Have I not taught you to keep a steady hand, my follower? To not launch yourself headfirst into violence?}}
:{{text|say|Avatar of Sethraliss|Young Zandalari, you may be used to getting away with whatever you please, as you skulk through the streets of your home.}}
:{{text|say|Avatar of Sethraliss|But be careful when you are dealing with powerful artifacts. Dishonesty under my gaze is not taken lightly.}}
:{{text|say|Avatar of Sethraliss|Beware falling on the wrong side of a loa, Azala.}}
:{{text|say|Vorrik|<name>. Please escort this nuisance out of our terrace.}}
