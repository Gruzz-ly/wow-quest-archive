==Objectives==
Speak with [[Explosioneer Zoidfuse]] to initiate the [[Vol'dun]] Explosion Protocol.
* Initiate the Vol'dun Explosion Protocol

==Description==
Still, we've placed all those explosives, and there's nothing stopping us from detonating them and laying waste to the [[Horde]]'s excavations.

Speak with Zoidfuse when you're ready, and we'll get this explosive gnome tech going!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
Whenever you're ready.

==Completion==
Ha ha! That should set the [[Reliquary]] back a few months.

==Notes==
Speak with Zoidfuse:
{{Dialogue|
It's IMPERATIVE that we send the ignition commands from a position with line-of-sight on all explosion locations. Unfortunately, I need to manually verify all parameters are correctly set, and that cannot be done from anywhere but here.

The short version: we need you to get in the flying machine and press the big red button when I tell you to.

{{gossip|Push the big red button when you tell me to. Got it.}}

:{{text|say|Explosioneer Zoidfuse|Um, is this thing on? Hello? Ok.}}
:{{text|say|Explosioneer Zoidfuse|Radio check. This is Alpha 1. Address group, alpha squadron. Do you read me? Over.}}

Hit the "Calibrate Comm Channel" button:
:{{text|say|Explosioneer Zoidfuse|Roger! Yes! Calibration complete. All of you must orient the instruments in very specific locations. Contact me when they're in place. Over.}}

Hit the second button:
:{{text|say|Explosioneer Zoidfuse|Authentication code is one-niner-niner. Instrument alignment is outside acceptable parameters... Belay that... I can make this work. Sit tight, over.}}
:{{text|say|Explosioneer Zoidfuse|Execute to follow. See that big red button? Yeah, get clear of the area and DO press the big red button. Execute when ready. Over.}}

Hit the big red button:
:{{text|say|Explosioneer Zoidfuse|Hah! Confirmed. Mission success. Perfection incarnate! I love it when a plan comes together. Over and out.}}
