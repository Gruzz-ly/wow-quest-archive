==Objectives==
Free [[Hakasi]] and [[Kipp]] from within [[Serpent's Maw|The Serpent's Maw]].
* Hakasi rescued
* Kipp rescued

==Description==
The [[sethrak]] may be strong, but we're quick. Well, at least [[Mekaru]] and I are.

We just barely made it back to the wagon with our tails attached.

The others weren't so lucky, I guess. We've been waiting a while, and still no sign of them.

If you're headed into the thick of it, would you mind looking for our friends?

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Exiled Veteran's Treads
|Lastwind Sandals
|Resilient Outcast's Boots
|Scorching Sands Footpads

|Scorching Sands Belt
}}

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
We abandoned our scavenging as soon as the sethrak showed up. Not all of us made it to safety...

==Completion==
Thanks, <name>. We owe you our lives.
