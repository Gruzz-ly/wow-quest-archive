==Objectives==
Collect 6 Knickknacks from [[sethrak]] within [[Serpent's Maw|The Serpent's Maw]].
* [[Knickknacks]] collected (6)

==Description==
[[Nisha]] told me you came here in search of an exile. One named [[Warguard Rakera|Rakera]]?

We don't know her, but we might be able to help you find her.

You help us, and we help you. Deal?

We survive by scavenging. We trade what we find, but the sethrak that raided our burrows made away with many of our knickknacks.

I always knew they were ruthless, but never imagined they'd be so greedy.

Take back what the sethrak have taken, and I'll see that you are provided safe passage through the dunes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
You help us, and we help you. Deal?

==Completion==
You're more resourceful than you look.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Searching for Survivors]] and [[Secrets in the Sand]] before heading out. [[Knickknacks]] can drop from any of the sethrak mobs in the Serpent's Maw in the form of various items such as [[Chipped Statuette]], [[Crystalline Dagger]], [[Thundering Idol]], or [[Torn Painting]]. While on the quests, be sure to also pick up [[A Meal for Birds]] and [[Aided Escape]] from [[Neri]] and [[Mekaru]] at the wagon west of the [[Brine Basin]].

On completion of Knickknack Takeback, Searching for Survivors, and Secrets in the Sand:
:{{Text|say|Kiro|[[Meerah]], ready the wagon and be prepared to pick up supplies at the port. Our new allies can ride along and continue their search.}}
:{{Text|say|KIro|It's time to put [[Nisha]]'s plan into action. The sethrak will never see us coming.}}

==Progression==
{{Dangers in the Desert}}
