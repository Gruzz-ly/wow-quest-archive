==Objectives==
Kill 6 [[Sethrak]] [[Skycaller]]s at the [[Temple Incursion]].
* [[Faithless Skycaller]] slain (6)

==Description==
Some among the [[faithless]]{{sic}} are gifted with the ability to command the storm. They call themselves skycallers, and they use their magic to summon great spires that turn the earth into sand.

Skycallers are the only ones capable of summoning these spires. If you kill the skycallers, you also kill the sethrak's ability to expand their warcamps.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
The faithless cannot summon their sand spires without their skycallers.

==Completion==
Without their skycallers, the faithless' incursion will falter.

==Notes==
*Pick up [[Building Our Arsenal]] and [[Risky Rescue]] before leaving. Faithless Skycallers are found around the Temple Incursion.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
