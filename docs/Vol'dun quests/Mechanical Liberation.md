==Objectives==
Free [[Mecha-Golem]]s in the [[Scalefang Outpost]].

* Mechs liberated (5)

==Description==
Since you successfully interrupted my nap, my defenses are obviously lacking to say the least. 

That's because the [[sethrak]], in addition to stealing my gadgets and gizmos, stole my mechs! Those morons don't even have the keys!

<[[Dataguru Gryzix|Gryzix]] laughs>

Here, take my keys and get my mechs back.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Ah, yes. I feel much safer now.

==Completion==
Ah, yes. My mechs!

A little muscle goes a long way it seems...

==Notes==
Scalefang Outpost is located slightly northwest of the [[Port of Zem'lan]].
