==Objectives==
Round up 6 [[Alpaca]]s.
*Alpacas herded (6)
*[[Alpaca Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
Our herd of [[alpaca]]s escaped dis morning. Dey're out dere wandering de dunes as we speak.

Probably for de best, if you ask me. We'll all be dead soon once [[Mojambo]] comes back.

Since you seem to care so much, take dis alpaca whistle and use it to round dem up. I blow de whistle every day at feeding time, so de alpacas should come running home when dey hear de sound.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Did you round up de missing alpacas?

==Completion==
Looks like you recovered most of de herd. Good work... even though Mojambo and his henchmons will probably murder us in our sleep and take de alpacas for demselves...

==Notes==
[[Lost Alpaca]]s roam the dunes in a large area northwest of [[Exiles' Enclave]] to the west. Use the [[Alpaca Whistle]] near a Lost Alpaca to cause it to run back to Mugjabu. Some alpacas run back immediately, while others turn {{rep|hostile}} and have to be damaged by the player before they comply.

Upon reurning to Mugjabu, his stable is now populated by [[Alpaca (NPC)|Alpacas]] as a testament to the player's actions.
