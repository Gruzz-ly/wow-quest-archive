{{questportrait|Akunda the Exalted.jpg|Akunda the Exalted|Exile and usurper who has been siphoning the [[loa]]'s power.}}
Defeat [[Akunda the Exalted]].
* Akunda the Exalted slain

==Description==
Akunda the Exalted is not who he seems. He poisoned the [[Eternal Spring|eternal spring]], sickening all who drank from it. Even I was not immune to his abhorrent [[alchemy]].

Now he drains my power, abusing my gift to wipe the minds of all who might try to stop him.

We will not let him succeed.

What little power I have left, I will lend to you.

Use it to call the storm and end the madness that has taken over my temple.

==Completion==
You wield my gift well, <name>.

Now that my power has returned, I can heal the minds of my children.

==Notes==
Travel back south to the [[Temple of Akunda]]. On arrival:
:{{Text|say|Akunda|Call the storm, <name>. Unseat this usurper!}}

You also receive an extra action button to help you kill Akunda the Exalted:
:{{Abilities|Tempest|id=272331|Shocks your enemy target with the might of Akunda, inflicting damage and causing them to take 50% increased damage for 12 seconds.|icon=spell_nature_lightning}}

Akunda the Exalted is standing inside the temple, still channeling power from the loa. On aggro:
:{{Text|say|Akunda the Exalted|Fool! You should have run away when you had de chance! De power of Akunda will be mine!}}

When you strike the killing blow against the traitor, a brief cutscene begins, showing Akunda the Exalted collapsing on the ground while Akunda escapes his bonds and lands on the floor of the temple with a crash of lightning. Afterward:
:{{Text|say|Akunda|At last, I am free! Thank you, Akunda the <Courageous/Nimble/Serene>.}}

Talk to Akunda to turn in.
