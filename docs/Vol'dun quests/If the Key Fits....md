==Objectives==
Collect 6 Ashvane Trader Keys.
*[[Ashvane Trader Key]] (6)

==Description==
These [[Ashvane Trading Company|Ashvane]] are unreasonable. I've tried to bargain for my release, but they refuse any offer I bring to the table.

All they want is whatever's bubbling up in [[Redrock Mines|that mine]]. [[Vulpera|My kind]] know better than to go near [[Azerite|that stuff]]. It's volatile.

There are prisoners in the mine being forced to extract it. Us in the cages? We're back up. When someone dies in the mines, they just send another in.

If you release me, I'll make sure you're rewarded! We just need to find the right key for this cage...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
We need to find the right key to open this cage.

==Completion==
None of these keys work! We're going to have to find another way...

==Notes and trivia==
*Ashvane Trader Keys drop from most of the Ashvane forces around the [[Ashvane Encampment]] area.
*During the ''Battle for Azeroth'' beta, this quest was named '''Docking Fee'''.
