==Objectives==
Free the [[Scion of Rakjan]] and lead him to [[Rakjan the Unbroken]].
*Scion of Rakjan freed
*Scion of Rakjan escorted

==Description==
<[[Beastbreaker Hakid]]'s crystal-encrusted key looks like it will open the [[Beastbreaker Cage|large cage]] nearby.

The [[pterrordax]] inside that cage, Scion of Rakjan, is stronger than the other hatchlings you've seen in the [[Crackling Ridge]]. He holds his head high and doesn't seem bothered by the myriad scars and fresh wounds that cover his body.

If you release him, he'll likely want to return to Rakjan the Unbroken at the top peak of Crackling Ridge.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|38|80}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
<Rakjan lowers his head in respect.>

==Notes==
Interact with the Beastbreaker Cage to unlock it and free the Scion of Rakjan, who proceeds to follow the player around. Upon reaching [[Rakjan's Peak]] at the top of the ridge, the Scion takes his place atop some bones next to Rakjan, where he then permanently remains after the quest's completion.

==Progression==
{{Storming the Spire}}
