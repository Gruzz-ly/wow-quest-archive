Kaja and Rakera continue accompanying the player during this quest. Head directly north into Zul'Ahjin. Next to a large hollow with two dead [[Scorpashi Venomtail]]s outside it, [[Meerah]] has caught up with and tied down [[Dolly]] and [[Dot (alpaca)|Dot]].
:{{Text|say|Meerah|Thank the sands you're safe!}}

Head inside, where Julwaba is waiting along with some unexpected visitors: the gravely wounded [[sethrak]] Serrik and [[Serrik's Pterrordax|his pterrordax]], as well as [[Kiro]] and [[Nisha]].
