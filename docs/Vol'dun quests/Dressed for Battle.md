==Objectives==
Help Nisha find a war banner, a helmet, and explosives.
* Banner found
* Helmet found
* Explosives found

==Description==
[[Kiro]]'s the leader of my caravan. He's always been far too passive.

I warned him we needed to make a preemptive strike against the [[sethrak]], but he insisted that we keep our heads down and continue to quietly do business.

Look where that got us.

Our caravan was completely unprepared for their attack.

Now I'm ready to fight for what's ours, but I'm not exactly dressed for battle.

Help me scavenge some suitable equipment among our enemies. We will use their own tools against them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Lastwind Bands
|Exiled Veteran's Armguards
|Resilient Outcast's Vambraces
|Scorching Sands Wristwraps
|Resilient Outcast's Gauntlets

|Exiled Veteran's Crushers
|Scorching Sands Handwraps
}}

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Killing an enemy with their own sword is an even bigger insult, no?

==Completion==
Now we are ready for a real challenge!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Answering Their Attacks]] before heading out.

Upon exiting the [[Shrouded Hollow]] into the Abandoned Burrows:
:{{Text|say|Nisha|Look what the sethrak have done to our home...}}

Find the [[Stolen Vulpera Banner]] at a crashed wagon just north of the Shrouded Hollow:
:{{Text|say|Nisha|Now the sethrak will know to fear the vulpera!}}

Head further north and interact with the [[Sethrak Skull]]:
:{{Text|say|Nisha|The vulpera are anything but weak. They will fear us!}}

Finally, head southwest to find the [[Explosives (Vol'dun)|Explosives]] lying in a crate:
:{{Text|say|Nisha|These sethrak will pay for what they've done to our home.}}
