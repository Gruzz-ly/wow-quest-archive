==Objectives==
Recover Nisha's Attack Plans from [[Fangcaller Sraka]].
* [[Nisha's Attack Plans]]

==Description==
Before we were attacked, I had a plan to take the fight to the [[sethrak]].

It was devised with flawless intel. I know, because I gathered the information myself. I surveyed their entire compound and created a map based on my findings.

My plan relies on that map, but it's now in the hands of Fangcaller Sraka, the brute who's leading this assault on my home.

Help me kill her so I can take back what's mine!

("Fangcaller Sraka: Leader of the attack on the [[Abandoned Burrows]].")

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|38|80}}
* 20,550 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
My plan for attack is both detailed and dangerous.

==Completion==
These plans will be our key to taking the fight to the sethrak.

==Notes==
Fangcaller Sraka is found at {{Coords|61.2|32.6|Vol'dun}}.
