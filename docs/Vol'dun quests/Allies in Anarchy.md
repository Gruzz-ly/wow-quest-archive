==Objectives==
Speak with [[Nisha]].
* Speak with Nisha on the nearby ridge.

==Description==
Even after all these years, I can feel the ancient power of [[Sethraliss]] in [[Vorrik's Sanctum|this place]]. My [[loa]] endures.

Our task ahead is great and I will need a clear, focused mind to accomplish it. Allow me a few moments to meditate here, like I did in ages past.

In the meantime, you should help the [[vulpera]] stir up trouble however you can. They seem to know you, and a large enough disturbance will distract the [[Faithless]] from our mission.

Meet me back here when you're done and we'll proceed together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|1|94}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>?! We gotta stop meeting in places like this.

Actually, let's ALWAYS meet in places like this!

You up for killing some Faithless?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|[[Meerah]]|Nisha will be so happy to see you! She's out at the crater killing sethrak... Like she always is.}}
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|I will stay here to prepare for our assault while you sow chaos among the Faithless.}}
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|Return soon. We must strike at [[Emperor Korthek]] without delay.}}

Before heading out, pick up [[The Little Ones]] from Meerah. Head out of the sanctum and down the ramp leading into the [[Crater of Conquerors]] to find Nisha and [[Kiro]].
:{{Text|say|Kiro|This is risky, Nisha. The Faithless will know we're up here.}}
:{{Text|say|Nisha|Good. They should know who's gonna kill them.}}
:{{Text|say|Nisha|And our people shackled in chains down there should know we haven't abandoned them.}}

==Progression==
{{Storming the Spire}}
