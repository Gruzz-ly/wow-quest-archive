Head up to the southwestern end of the isle with Jamboya to find the [[Gong of Zem'lan]]. Upon ringing the gong, a large pirate ship captained by Pirate-King Zem'lan appears and docks next to the island.
:{{Text|yell|Pirate-King Zem'lan|Ho! What bilgesuckers be darin' to challenge me?}}
:''Zem'lan jumps off his boat onto the island.''
:{{Text|yell|Pirate-King Zem'lan|A mutiny by me own first mate?! I'll keelhaul ya!}}

Zem'lan quickly aggros onto the player and Jamboya:
:{{Text|say|Pirate-King Zem'lan|Da [[Port of Zem'lan]] be mine!}}

At around 65% health:
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|Ya be a cruel captain, Zem'lan. De crew deserves better!}}
:{{Text|say|Pirate-King Zem'lan|What could be better than an eternity of pillagin' and plunderin'?}}
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|An eternity of pillagin' and plunderin'... without you!}}

Upon killing Zem'lan:

:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|Smartly now! Meet me back at de boat. I'll make sure de crew has it loaded with treasure.}}

Jamboya heads back to the boat on the northeast side of the isle. Head there to find the boat filled with treasure.
