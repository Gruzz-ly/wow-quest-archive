==Objectives==
Place the idols on the altar and try to destroy them.
*Idols placed on altar
*[[Idol of Binding (object)|Idol of Binding]] attacked

==Description==
Dis be it. Where [[Pirate-King Zem'lan|Zem'lan]] cursed us all.

It began with me death. De first of countless deaths I've had since. Each of dem spent fighting and dying for Pirate-King Zem'lan and his selfish treasure hoard.

I don't know if de idols he used to curse us can even be destroyed, but we gotta try. Let's take dem to de altar where de ritual occurred and try to smash one.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
I've forgotten how many times I've died since den...

==Completion==
I guess de idols can't be destroyed... even by a mortal. Curses be fickle things.

I was de first Zem'lan cursed, and I did nothin' to stop him from cursin' de rest of de crew.

I regret it every day...

But enough livin' in de past. It's time to be free.

==Notes==
On accept, Jamboya begins following the player around.

Head southwest to the [[Cursed Altar of Zem'lan]] and interact with it to place the idols on top. Upon interacting with the center one, the [[Idol of Binding (object)|Idol of Binding]], it is not, however, destroyed. Instead, an explosion of shadowy energy erupts from the altar, knocking the player back a short distance and conjuring another vision of the past.
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|Avast! De idols can't be destroyed, but dey released an old memory... One I've tried to forget.}}
