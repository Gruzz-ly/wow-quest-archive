==Objectives==
Collect 15 Sandstinger Venom Glands.
* [[Sandstinger Venom Gland]] (15)

==Description==
[[Meerah]] here found [[Bladeguard Kaja|your friend]] in the dunes. The lightning strike nearly killed her. It might still, without treatment.

The [[wasp]]s within the grove have a painful sting, but their venom also has restorative properties.

I can extract what I need from their glands.

With an ample amount of venom, we should be able to soothe your friend's wounds.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Have you brought the glands? We can't heal your friend without them.

==Completion==
<Kiro quickly inspects the glands.>

These should work well.

==Notes==
The glands drop from [[Venomous Sandstinger]]s and [[Sandstinger Drone]]s in the [[Prickly Grove]] just to the southwest. Pick up [[Freshly Squeezed]] before heading out, and pick up [[Missing Business]] while in the grove.

==Progression==
