==Objectives==
Use Vorrik's Bulwark to defeat 75 [[Faithless]] within the [[Sacred Sands]].
* Faithless purged (75)

==Description==
It seems I underestimated [[Emperor Korthek|Korthek]]'s cowardice. I expected him to be behind the barrier, ready to ambush us. Yet, still he hides.

That allows us a few moments to prepare. We musn't waste them.

While I siphon power off of these immense crystals, you must thin the numbers of the Faithless here. I will grant you a powerful boon to speed you in your task.

When Korthek arrives, he will require our full attention.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Go! We must hurry.

==Completion==
Excellent. Now we may focus on Emperor Korthek without distractions.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|I will grant you a portion of my power, <name>. My bulwark will expunge any Faithless who challenge you.}}

You are granted the "Vorrik's Bulwark" buff, which effectively allows you to kill Faithless by simply running near them. Killing [[Faithless Acolyte]]s, [[Faithless Eradicator]]s, [[Faithless Scrollkeeper]]s, [[Faithless Spireguard]]s, and [[Korthek's Student]]s counts towards the objective.
:{{Abilities|Vorrik's Bulwark|id=267347|Instantly kills nearby Faithless. Increases movement speed by 70%. Run over lightning orbs to recharge its power.|icon=spell_shaman_staticshock}}

The Bulwark's remaining charge is indicated by a "Bulwark Power" bar at the bottom of your screen. Aside from being recharged by picking up [[Lightning Orb|lightning orbs]] around the spire area, the Bulwark also gradually recharges on its own over time, even while in combat. While killing Faithless, also gather the quest items needed for [[Relics of Sethraliss]].

Upon completing both Relics of Sethraliss and Infuriating the Emperor, Vorrik stops his channeling.
