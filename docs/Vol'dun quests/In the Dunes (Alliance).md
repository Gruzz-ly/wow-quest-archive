==Objectives==
Find [[Dataguru Gryzix]] at The [[Forgotten Marsh]] in [[Vol'dun]].
* [[Encrypted Ub3r-Spanner Schematic (1)]] (provided)

==Description==
This schematic you found is encrypted. My tools are no good on it, not without risking the integrity of the data.

However, I do know a guy who can definitely crack this cookie: Mr. Dataguru Gryzix.

If I remember correctly, he's been vacationing on a beach in Vol'dun since the [[Fourth War|war]] broke out. Something about not getting the recognition he deserves.

Anyways, I am sure you can convince him to help you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ugh, what do you want?

==Progression==
{{It's Scrap Work...}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.1.5|note=Added.}}
