==Notes==
[[File:Sezahjin hatless.jpg|thumb|Sezahjin after having his hat stolen.]]
This quest is offered by Jani at the [[Mysterious Trashpile]] in the northwest corner of the [[Scorched Sands Arena]].{{Coords|42.2|72|Vol'dun}} Like Jani's other tasks throughout [[Zandalar]], the quest can only be accessed by player characters who have completed the prerequisite quests for [[Get Hek'd]].

On accept, the player is afflicted with the "Curse of Jani" buff, transforming them into a saurid and placing them in a phased version of the Scorched Sands Arena populated by dead [[Sethrak Invader]]s as well as {{Rep|hostile}} [[Scorpashi Venomtail]]s and [[Starving Buzzard (Vol'dun)|Starving Buzzards]].
:{{Text|say|Jani|Go, my minion.{{Sic}}Take his hat and earn de favor of Jani. But be careful not to let that hungry predators be seein' you...}}

While transformed, the player has the following abilities (Summon Swarm is initially grayed out and unusable):
*{{Abilities|Sprint|id=274034|Movement speed increased by 120% for 6 sec.|notes=10 sec cooldown.|icon=spell_fire_burningspeed}}
*{{Abilities|Summon Swarm|id=266476|Summons a swarm of Jani's children to Sezahjin's location.|notes=12 sec cooldown.|icon=ability_mount_raptor_black}}

Begin making your way across the arena while avoiding the Venomtails and Buzzards. If the player takes damage from a mob at any point, they are instantly teleported back to the Trashpile while Jani berates them:
:{{Text|say|Jani|Silly saurid, ya be dead again.}}

Furthermore, the Curse of Jani buff will instantly be removed should the player leave the Scorched Sands Arena or Scorched Sands Outpost subzones, forcing them to return to the Trashpile and talk to Jani again for a new disguise:
:Greetin's, richmon. What brings ya to dis Shrine of Scavengers?
*{{Gossip|Release me.}}
*{{Gossip|I need a new disguise.}}

Successfully navigating around the mobs in the arena will allow the player to eventually reach the Scorched Sands Outpost, where all of the NPCs have turned {{Rep|unfriendly}}. Run over to Sezahjin and use the now available Summon Swarm ability to cause a pack of [[Child of Jani|Children of Jani]] to appear and scurry around the area, causing Sezahjin to cower in fear.
:{{Text|say|Sezahjin|Ahh! What be happenin'?! Help!}}

While Sezahjin is distracted, the player can interact with him to steal his chef's hat and put it on their own head. Waiting around long enough will cause the Children to despawn and things to return to normal, allowing the player to use Summon Swarm to trigger the event again if they so choose.

Run back through the arena to the Mysterious Trashpile, where Jani will laugh at the player's accomplishment:
:{{Text|say|Jani|Hek hek hek hek!}}

Interact with the Trashpile and talk to Jani again to remove the Curse of Jani and turn in the quest.
