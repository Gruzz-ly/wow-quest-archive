==Objectives==
Collect 12 Bilewing Stingers.
*[[Bilewing Stinger]] (12)

==Description==
I don't know what [[Rhan'ka]]'s doing down in [[Whistlebloom Oasis|that oasis]] with all of the honey he's bought from me. Frankly, I suspect I don't even want to know.

But whatever his reasons, Rhan'ka is my best customer.

So even though my supply's getting low, because Rhan'ka sent you, I'll give you a special deal.

The [[wasp]]s here keep all their honey stored in their stingers. Bring some to me, so I can drain them for honey and I'll give you a big batch of the sticky stuff to take back to Rhan'ka.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Don't fret if some sand gets mixed in. It'll taste the same either way.

==Completion==
It'll just take me a moment to get the honey out of these.

==Notes==
Bilewing Stingers can drop from any of the Bilewing wasps around the [[Four Stingers]].

==Progression==
{{Goldtusk Inn}}
