==Objectives==
Enter the [[Temple of Sethraliss]] and heal the avatar of the [[loa]].
*[[Avatar of Sethraliss]] healed

==Description==
We cannot let [[Mythrax]] bring his destruction upon this world once more.

We need our loa now more than ever, but she has yet to return to us.

The time of her rebirth has passed. Someone, or something, must be preventing her awakening.

Enter her resting place and see what you can uncover.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (600x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* {{Cost|77|60}}
* 32,900 [[XP]]
* +500 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
We cannot let Mythrax bring his destruction upon this world once more.

==Completion==
Behold, <name>. [[Sethraliss]] has returned.

==Notes==
This quest requires the player to enter the [[Temple of Sethraliss]] dungeon and complete the [[Avatar of Sethraliss]] boss encounter.

After the player has done so and returns to the upper chamber of the [[Sanctuary of the Devoted]], a large projection of the Avatar of Sethraliss is now located in the center of the room.
