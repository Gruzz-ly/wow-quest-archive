==Objectives==
Collect 20 Sethrak Weapons from within the [[Temple Incursion]].
* [[Sethrak Weapon]] (20)

==Description==
Our fight against the [[faithless]]{{sic}} is an uphill battle we're bound to lose. We are outnumbered and out armed.

What few weapons we have aren't enough to outfit the entire [[Sanctuary of the Devoted|temple]].

With a few more spears and daggers, we might stand a chance fighting them off until [[Sethraliss|our loa]] can be returned to us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
We need weapons, <name>.

==Completion==
You've brought enough to put a weapon in the hands of everyone willing and able to fight.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Risky Rescue]] and [[Skycaller Slaughter]] before leaving. Sethrak Weapons are looted from objects of the same name around the [[Temple Incursion]]. The weapons are leaned up against weapon racks, with each rack holding multiple lootable weapons.

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
