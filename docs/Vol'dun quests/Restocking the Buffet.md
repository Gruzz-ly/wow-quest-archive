An all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet, of course!

Bring me some, and I'll give you lifetime access to de buffet.

Dis buffet is going to be a disaster if we don't get dat fruit!

Breakfast is served!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Zulsan|While you get us some fruit, I'll make scorpid breakfast kebabs!}}

Whistlebloom Juicy Fruit can be found across the Whistlebloom Oasis outside the inn. On completion, Zulsan floats over to the west corner of the inn and the [[All-You-Can-Eat Breakfast Buffet]] sitting on the rocks:
:{{Text|say|Zulsan|Mmm, this fruit looks delicious! Let's get it on the buffet table.}}
:{{Text|yell|Zulsan|Breakfast is served!}}
...before floating back to his cauldron next to the eastern wall.
