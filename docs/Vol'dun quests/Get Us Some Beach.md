==Objectives==
Collect 20 piles of sand.
*[[Pile of Sand]] (20)

==Description==
[[Abrasive Reconfigulator 8000|These guys]] are running out of "ammo" faster than we can replace it!

I tells 'em, we're on a beach, you're in a sandblaster, suck it up!

They says it's against the cleaner driver rules for their local chapter.

I'm not buyin' it.

Grab us some more sand. Them [[sandstorm elemental|sand monsters]] have gotta be full of the stuff!

We'll make it worth your time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Ya get us the dirt yet?

==Completion==
That should fill us up a few more bags. If they run out again, I'll make 'em break out the pickaxes.

I bet then a little self-fueling won't sound so bad!

Ungrateful sons of bellybutton lint...

==Notes==
Piles of Sand drop from [[Siroccan]]s and [[Sirocite]]s around the [[Cracked Coast]] area.

==Progression==
{{The Cracked Coast}}
