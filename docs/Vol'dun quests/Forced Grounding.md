==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Fangcaller Hrillik.jpg|Fangcaller Hrillik|[[Sethrak]] commander riding a large pterrordax in the sky.}}
Use the Faithless Trapper's Spear to pull [[Fangcaller Hrillik]]'s [[Hrillik's Pterrordax|pterrordax]] down from the sky above you, and kill him.
*Fangcaller Hrillik slain
*[[Faithless Trapper's Spear (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<This is one of the spears that [[Faithless]] trappers use to pull [[pterrordax]]es to the ground. It has a long chain attached to its base.

With good aim, you could use it to pull a Faithless pterrordax rider to the ground so you could fight them.>

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Faithless Skyrider's Focus
|Faithless Skyrider's Shield
}}

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|38|80}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
<Rakjan lifts his head proudly.>

==Completion==
<Rakjan nods in approval. That's one less Fangcaller to worry about.>

==Notes==
[[Hrillik's Pterrordax]] is circling high above [[Rakjan's Peak]]. Use the [[Faithless Trapper's Spear (item)]] to pull it to the ground and kill it, then dispatch [[Fangcaller Hrillik]] after he dismounts and becomes attackable after his mount's death. Talk to [[Rakjan the Unbroken]] nearby to turn in.

==Progression==
