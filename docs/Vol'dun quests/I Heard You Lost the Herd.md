Speak with [[Mugjabu]].

Our herd of [[alpaca]]s went missing dis morning.

It may seem like we have more pressing matters to worry about, but de meat and milk de alpacas provide are essential to our survival.

Those alpacas won't survive long on de dunes. Speak with Mugjabu and help him find de alpacas before it's too late!

==Completion==
Razgaji sent you? I'm not sure why he cares so much. When [[Mojambo]] and his gang come back, we'll all be dead anyway...
