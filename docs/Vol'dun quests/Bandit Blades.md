Retrieve 8 [[Sandworn Blade]]s.
*[[Sandworn Blade]] (8)

==Description==
We only have enough weapons to arm half of de tribe against [[Mojambo]]'s gang.

We're going to need more weapons if we are going to survive de approaching battle.

[[Tongo]]'s crew is sure to have a ready supply of weapons at their hideout.

Search de hideout for any weapons you can find and bring dem back to [[Scorched Sands Arena|de arena]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Do you have de weapons?

==Completion==
Dese ancient blades may not be in de best condition, but dey are finely forged. I am sure dey will hold up in battle just fine.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Stolen Goods (quest)]] and [[Tongo (quest)]] before heading to [[Exiles' Enclave]]. [[Sandworn Blade]]s are scattered around [[Exiles' Enclave]] and can also be looted from the [[Zandalari Exile]]s in the area.
