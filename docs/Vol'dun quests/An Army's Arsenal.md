==Objectives==
Kill the [[Troll spectre|specters]] of [[Specter of Mugabu|Mugabu]] and [[Specter of Jam'jen|Jam'jen]], so [[Omi]] can ransack the storehouses.
*Specter of Jam'jen slain
*Specter of Mugabu slain

==Description==
It's my job to scout out [[Court of Zak'rajan|the ruins]] to identify threats and figure out the best way in.

Two storehouses contain the majority of the valuable weaponry in the ruins.

Unfortunately, they're guarded by spectres, powerful [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] spirits bound to this place.

I... we need those weapons. Take out the specters so I... we can get to them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|38|80}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
We make a good team, <name>.

==Completion==
You and I make a good team, <name>.

Have a little extra reward, on me.

==Notes==
On accept, Omi enters [[Stealth]] and sneaks off in the direction of the ruins before despawning.
:{{Text|say|Omi|I'll sneak ahead to scout the area. Clear out those specters and I'll grab the supplies.}}

Pick up [[Siphoning Souls]] and [[The Strongest Rope in Vol'dun]] before heading into the court.

The Specter of Mugabu is found in a storehouse in the northwestern part of the ruins,{{Coords|46|43.2|Vol'dun}} performing some kind of magic on an inanimate golem in front of an altar. Upon killing him, Omi runs into the building and inspects some crates in front of the altar.
:{{Text|say|Omi|Alright, let's see which of this magic stuff is worth carrying.}}
:{{Text|say|Omi|Cursed idols! [[Tacha]] loves these... and look at all these reagents.}}
:''Omi heads over to the golem.''
:{{Text|say|Omi|Oh, and can't forget the soul-filled golem eye! Tacha turns these into hilarious little bombs.}}
:{{Text|say|Omi|And maybe a couple little trinkets for my trouble.}}
:''Omi enters Stealth and runs out of the storehouse.''

The Specter of Jam'jen is located in a building in the eastern ruins{{Coords|47.8|44.4|Vol'dun}} among several [[sethrak]] corpses and a few weapon racks. Upon killing him, Omi enters and inspects one of the racks.
:{{Text|say|Omi|Nice fighting. Now let's see what all{{sic}} they've got stockpiled in here.}}
:''Omi heads over to the other rack.''
:{{Text|say|Omi|Mostly standard Zandalari weapons here... Ooo, those look enchanted!}}
:{{Text|say|Omi|This is a good haul, <name>. I'll take the best of these for the group, of course.}}
:''Omi enters Stealth and leaves the building.''

Turn in to Omi back at the wagon west of the ruins.
