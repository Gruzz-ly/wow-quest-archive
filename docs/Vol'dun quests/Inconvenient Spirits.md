==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Tortured Spirit (Vol'dun)|Tortured Spirits]].
*Tortured Spirit slain (8)

==Description==
The [[sethrak]] have oppressed [[vulpera]] like me for countless generations.

You can't fight 'em. Trust me, <race>. My caravan tried.

I took that beating as a lesson, and then I found a new pack to run with.

Here, we keep our distance from the sethrak and scavenge ruins like this one for anything valuable we can use or trade.

You want in? We could use a fourth. [[Court of Zak'rajan|This one]]'s protected by nasty spirits that keep harassing us.

Take them out and you're in.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
I've never met a spirit that made my day better.

==Completion==
Well, you're good at killing. I could tell that even from back here. Welcome to the crew.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Ranishu Are Resources]] and [[They've Got Golems]] before heading out. Tortured Spirits are found around the [[Bone Pit]] area to the southeast, often near [[Lifeless Golem]]s.

==Progression==
{{Court of Zak'rajan}}
