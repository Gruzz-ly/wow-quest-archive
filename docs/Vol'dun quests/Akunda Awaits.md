Investigate the [[Temple of Akunda]].
* Investigate the Temple of Akunda

==Description==
I've spoken to every [[Zandalari troll|troll]] out here, asking if they've seen [[Warguard Rakera|Rakera]]. As you might have guessed, [[Akunda]] is de only name dey know.

Let's hope someone within de temple will be able to tell us something useful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|9|70}}
* 8,250 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
Dis is Rakera. I have no doubt. But for some reason, she does not remember me... or herself, it would seem...

==Notes==
On accept, Kaja begins following the player around.
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|Someone in dis strange temple must know something.}}

Upon heading into the temple, Kaja immediately notices [[Warguard Rakera|Akunda the Forlorn]] in the east corner of the temple....
:{{Text|yell|Bladeguard Kaja|Rakera!}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|She's here. She's alive! Rakera!}}

...and runs over to her.
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|Rakera?}}
:{{Text|say|Akunda the Forlorn|We are all Akunda.}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|What have dey done to you...}}

On completion:
:{{Text|whisper|[[Zenjibo|Akunda the Sensible]]|You! Yes, you. Approach quietly. Do not draw attention to yourself.}}

Speak to him for the next quest.
