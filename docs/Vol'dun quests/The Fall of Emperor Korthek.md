==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Emperor Korthek.jpg||Slay Emperor Korthek and retrieve the key to prevent Mythrax's summoning!}}
Defeat [[Emperor Korthek]].
* Speak with Vorrik

==Description==
Korthek finally approaches.

It's been many years since I've faced him in battle. When he first rose to power, I failed my people. I will not falter again.

I am prepared to do what must be done. What I should have done long ago.

We must kill Korthek and take his key to prevent him, [[General Jakra'zet|Jakra'zet]], or anyone else from ever resurrecting [[Mythrax]].

When you are prepared, we will face him together.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Korthek's Greatstaff
|Skycaller's Ceremonial Mace
|Sethraliss-Blessed Shortblade
|Spireguard's Greatbow
|Korthek's Staff

|Sethraliss-Blessed Greatblade
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|58|20}}
* 24,680 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
Do not waste time mourning my old friend now. His foolish crusade has left us a larger problem that demands our full, immediate attention.

==Notes==
Talk to Vorrik:
:Let us end this together.
:{{Gossip|Vorrik, I'm ready to face Emperor Korthek.}}

A short cutscene begins, showing Korthek appearing in front of the entrance into the [[Temple of Sethraliss]] in a flash of lightning.
:{{Text|say|Emperor Korthek|You face the might of Korthek, the Eternal Emperor!}}

As soon as the cutscene ends, [[Nisha]] and Vorrik immediately run forward and begin fighting Korthek.
:{{Text|say|Emperor Korthek|I am the true power of the [[sethrak]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|No. You are our failure. [[Sethraliss]] sacrificed herself so we could live in peace.}}
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|We will keep Mythrax's prison sealed, and I will unite our people.}}

In battle, Korthek uses Cascade (which summons a damaging ball of lightning that lands at a target location and then bounces forward two times), Shock (which deals direct Nature damage), and Windwall (which summons a rotating wall of tornadoes that deal Nature damage to anyone standing in them). Interrupt Shock when possible and avoid being hit by Cascade and Windwall.

Around 75% health:
:{{Text|say|Emperor Korthek|I wonder, Vorrik... If you're here, who's guarding the keys in [[Sanctuary of the Devoted|your temple]]?}}
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|What have you done, Korthek?}}
:{{Text|say|Emperor Korthek|Ensured my victory no matter what happens here. General Jakra'zet already has my key, and by now... I suppose he has yours, as well.}}
:{{Text|say|Emperor Korthek|He will raise Mythrax, and we will conquer all of [[Azeroth]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|You fool! Mythrax cannot be controlled!}}

At 1% health, the wounded emperor becomes unattackable.
:{{Text|say|Emperor Korthek|I did not force anyone to follow me, Vorrik... Our people are conquerors...}}
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|No, old friend. Our people are dead, because of you.}}
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|And now, you must join them. Sethraliss forgive you.}}
:''Vorrik strikes the final blow against Korthek, killing him.''

Vorrik and Nisha go to stand a short distance south. Talk to Vorrik to turn in.

Completing this quest rewards the "Storming the Spire" portion of [[Secrets in the Sands]]. Vorrik offers the followup [[Sanctuary Under Siege]], which leads to the final chapter of the [[Vol'dun storyline]].
