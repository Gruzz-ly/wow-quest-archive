==Objectives==
Collect 12 Cursed Treasures of Zem'lan.
*[[Cursed Treasure of Zem'lan]] (12)

==Description==
Dis treasure belongs to de crew! We've fought every battle for [[Pirate-King Zem'lan|Zem'lan]], but he hoards all de booty for himself.

And if ya try to take some for yourself, he turns ya into one of his [[goldslave]]s. Those be de mindless drones ya see tendin' to de treasure out here.

We ain't leavin' here empty-handed after de mutiny. Collect all de treasure ya can!

Beware de cursed bits. It don't hurt us, but I'm guessin' it'll hurt you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
More treasure!

==Completion==
I suppose dis little amount of gold won't be cursin' ya for too long. I'll carry de rest.

==Notes==
Cursed Treasures of Zem'lan can be looted from [[Goldslave]]s and [[Animated Treasure]] as well as from [[Cursed Treasure]] objects across the isle. Occasionally, looting a Cursed Treasure of Zem'lan will inflict one of two curses on the player for 60 seconds. These effects can both be active at the same time, effectively cancelling each other out.
