==Objectives==
Administer the Antivenom to [[Vorrik]].
* Antidote Salve applied
*[[Antidote Salve]] (provided)

==Description==
The antidote's ready. 

It smells like death and tastes worse, but it should be potent enough. Let's hope that we're not too late for it to do any good.

Here, administer the salve to his wounds. It should work nearly instantly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I can feel life returning to my limbs. Thank you, stranger!

I'm afraid we don't have the time for more of an introduction. [[Private James|Your friend]] is held captive by the [[Faithless]].

Don't worry, my people will be happy to aid you in return for your kindness to me.

==Notes==
Use the venom:
