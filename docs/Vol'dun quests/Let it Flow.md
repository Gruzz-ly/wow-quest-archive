==Objectives==
Repair the fountains within [[Withering Gulch]].
* North fountain fixed
* South fountain fixed

==Description==
The fountains here have seen better days. They're currently incapable of holding water, but we can fix that!

You can use my spare tools to repair the cracks.

With a little luck and elbow grease, the fountains will be flowing again in no time!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Getting the fountains working again is my top priority.

==Completion==
Hrm, this fountain in front of me still isn't functioning? But my work was impeccable!

==Notes==
Pick up [[We Can Salvage the Seeds]] and [[Wither Without Water]] before embarking. The [[Terrace Fountain]]s are located at the northern and southern ends of the terrace.

==Progression==
{{Ranah's Wrench}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
