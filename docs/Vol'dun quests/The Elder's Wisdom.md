==Objectives==
Deliver the [[:Invasion Plans]] to [[Elder Kuppaka]].
*Plans delivered

==Description==
The [[naga]] are searching for a powerful artifact called the [[:Ring of Tides]].

According to the invasion plans, the ring was lost long ago in a battle with [[Kimbul|Eraka no Kimbul]], the great [[tiger]] [[loa]].

The [[Temple of Kimbul|temple]] of Eraka no Kimbul is just to the north. If the loa was strong enough to defeat the naga before, maybe he can do it again!

We must let the tribe know what we've found!

Take the invasion plans to Elder Kuppaka. He is the oldest, and wisest member of our tribe. He will know what to do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|1|94}}
*1,650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Elder Kuppaka will know what to do.

==Completion==
The temple is not far away, but it lies in ruin... abandoned and overgrown.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Torka|We must let the tribe know what we've found!}}

Talk to Elder Kuppaka:
:I have lived many years and seen many things. The [[Tortaka tribe]] survived long before I was born and it will survive long after I am dead.
:{{Gossip|Torka asked me to deliver this to you.}}
:{{Text|say|Elder Kuppaka|I have never heard of the Ring of Tides, but it must be powerful if [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] is sending an army to retrieve it.}}
:{{Text|say|Elder Kuppaka|We will not be safe here much longer.}}
:{{Text|say|Elder Kuppaka|The temple is in ruins, but we may find safety there if the loa will take us in...}}

Talk to Kuppaka again to turn in.

==Progression==
{{Tortaka Refuge}}
