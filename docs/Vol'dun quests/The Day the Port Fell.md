Use First Mate Jamboya's Medallion to view a vision of his past.
*Jamboya's memory witnessed
*[[First Mate Jamboya's Medallion]] (provided)

==Description==
Dis be a cursed land, <race>. Feel it in your bones: de cold chill of death... and [[undead|undeath]].

De [[Pirate-King Zem'lan]] rules [[Port of Zem'lan|dis port]], with his crew of de eternal damned.

If you be lookin' for honor or noble adventure, you won't find it here. But if you can settle for vengeance and treasure, I got an offer for you.

But you should know who you be allying with. My hands are not clean in dis.

Take de medallion from my cloak and use it to reveal a vision of my past at de end of de dock.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|9|70}}
*8,230 [[XP]]
*+10 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
Dat was where it all began. I could've stopped Zem'lan right dere... I could've prevented dis fate for de crew.

Instead, I led dem straight into it.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|Me medallion gonna reveal de vision of me past when ya be ready.}}
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|De day dat da Port of Zem'lan was cursed... so long ago.}}

Head to the southern end of the pier, where a group of [[Souldrained Refugee]] corpses lay strewn about the ground. Using [[First Mate Jamboya's Medallion]] causes two groups of visions of the past to appear. Using the item elsewhere triggers the warning: "Requires Port of Zem'lan Docks".

:''On one side, Visions of [[Vision of Jumash|Jumash]], [[Vision of Jumju|Jumju]], [[Vision of Kejina|Kejina]], [[Vision of Muzingi|Muzingi]], [[Vision of Taiani|Taiani]], and [[Vision of Vulnullu|Vulnullu]] are standing in the same positions as the present-day Souldrained Refugee corpses. On the other side, Visions of [[Vision of Shredder Ungalra|Shredder Ungalra]], [[Vision of Ronaku|Ronaku]], and [[Vision of Vor'sul|Vor'sul]] are facing the refugees with hostility, with Visions of [[Vision of Pirate-King Zem'lan|Pirate-King Zem'lan]] and [[Vision of First Mate Jamboya|First Mate Jamboya]] standing behind them.
:{{Text|say|Vision of First Mate Jamboya|To de side, refugees! Pirates get on de boat first!}}
:{{Text|say|Vision of First Mate Jamboya|We gonna take whoever we can with de extra space.}}
:{{Text|say|Vision of Vulnullu|Please, Zem'lan. Let us on de boats! De [[sethrak]] gonna kill us!}}
:{{Text|say|Vision of Muzingi|If ya don't let us on de boats, we all gonna be dead!}}
:{{Text|say|Vision of Pirate-King Zem'lan|Then be dead, ya fruitless scraps.}}
:''Zem'lan pulls out a pistol and shoots Muzingi, Taiani, and Vulnullu, killing them. Jumju and Kejina cower in fear while Jumash cries.''
:{{Text|say|Vision of Pirate-King Zem'lan|Ain't none a ya steppin' foot on me boats, 'cept those who be payin' me gold.}}
:{{Text|say|Vision of Pirate-King Zem'lan|And since none a ya got nothin' but ya crusty clothes, ya already be dead to me.}}
:{{Text|say|Vision of Pirate-King Zem'lan|So get outta me port! Go die in da dunes where ya belong.}}
:''The visions disappear.''

Head back to Jamboya. On completion:
:{{Text|say|First Mate Jamboya|Ya gonna have to help me down. Dey tied me up tight after me last escape.}}
