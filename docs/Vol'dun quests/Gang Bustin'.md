==Objectives==
Confront 8 [[Shady Deckhand]]s.
*Shady Deckhands confronted (8)

==Description==
It's difficult to run a tight ship when you're so far from home. The crew has a tendency to get restless when they've been landlocked for too long.

I've heard reports of deckhands sneakin' around and stealin' supplies. If the crew thinks they can steal from our employer on my watch, they've got another thing comin'!

I need someone to crack down on these shady deals and send a message to the crew.

Thievin' won't be tolerated!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We murder mutineers 'round here.

==Completion==
Glad I can count on you to keep things from gettin' out of hand.

==Notes==
[[Shady Deckhand]]s are found all over [[Redrock Harbor]], both down near the beach and up in the buildings among the cliffs, as well as onboard ''[[Siren's Call|The Siren's Call]]''. To confront them for the quest, the player needs to be disguised using [[Ashvane Garb]], as the deckhands will otherwise be {{rep|hostile}} like all of the other Ashvane forces.

When talked to, the Deckhands will say one of the following:
*Keep on walkin', crewman. Nothin' to see here...
*What're you looking at, crewman?
*You lookin' for a beating? Mind yer business!

In all cases, the player has the following dialogue option:
:{{Gossip|I know you've been stealing from [[Ashvane Trading Company|the company]]. I'm here to make sure it doesn't happen again...}}

In response, the deckhands may either say one of the following before walking off:
*{{Text|say|Don't kill me please! I'll never steal again!}}
*{{Text|say|I only stole to fill an empty heart that has never known love!}}
*{{Text|say|I won't do it again, I promise!}}
*{{Text|say|I'm done stealing! No more!}}
*{{Text|say|It was my poor upbringing that made me do it!}}
*{{Text|say|That salty dog Harrington{{sic}} called in the muscle!}}

...or turn {{rep|hostile}} and attack the player. Note that the quest only requires the player to speak to the deckhands; it is not necessary to kill the ones that turn hostile to get quest credit for them.
