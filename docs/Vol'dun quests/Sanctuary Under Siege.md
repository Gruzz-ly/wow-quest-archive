==Objectives==
Meet [[Vorrik]] at the [[Sanctuary of the Devoted]].

==Description==
I fear that [[Emperor Korthek]] was not lying when he boasted of his foolish plan.

If [[General Jakra'zet]] attacked the Sanctuary of the Devoted while we were away, there is a good chance that he now has everything needed to resurrect [[Mythrax]].

We must hurry to the Sanctuary and stop Jakra'zet. Mythrax must not be reborn!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|9|70}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
We're too late. The keys are gone.

[[Sethraliss]]... What have I done?

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|We must hurry back to the Sanctuary of the Devoted and stop General Jakra'zet from releasing Mythrax!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Nisha]]|Winds at your back, friends. But my fight is here, alongside the [[vulpera]].}}

Vorrik and Nisha run to the southern end of [[Skycallers' Spire|the terrace]]. Vorrik mounts a white [[pterrordax]] and flies off in the direction of the Sanctuary of the Devoted, while Nisha mounts a black [[hyena]] and continues south a short distance before despawning.

Head back to the Sanctuary of the Devoted to find Vorrik in the upper chamber of the temple. Dead [[Sandfury Assassin]]s and [[Temple Defender]]s line the floor, along with the corpse of [[Serrik]]. The [[Sulthis' Keystone|two]] [[Vorrik's Keystone|keystones]] have disappeared, as have [[Bladeguard Kaja]] and [[Warguard Rakera]]. Talk to Vorrik to turn in.
