:{{Text|say|High Warlord Cromush|Well done, soldier. You honor your ancestors with this victory.}}

==Notes==
*Location: [[Bonetrail Gulch]], [[Vol'dun]] during the [[Faction Assaults]].
*To fill up the bar:
**kill [[7th Legion Incinerator]]s, [[7th Legion Despoiler]]s, [[7th Legion Sandwalker]]s, and [[7th Legion Ascendant]]s.
**pick up the [[Vulpera Banner]]s that grant the Voldunai Banner buff and Inspiring Charge ability to inspire [[Hired Caravan Guardian]]s and [[Hired Courier (Vol'dun)|Hired Couriers]].
**click on burning [[Vulpera Caravan]]s to extinguish the fire.
**free [[Shackled Vulpera]].

[[Nisha]] can be found protecting a burning caravan near the southern end of the gulch. Upon speaking with her:
:Look at this destruction, <name>!
:The only thing these [[caravan]]s were guilty of was accepting a good-paying job to transport supplies.
:We [[vulpera]] have been free [[merchant]]s and traders for countless generations. What makes the Alliance think they can bully us into refusing work from [[Horde|people they don't like]]?
:They're no better than the [[sethrak]]... and you know how I deal with sethrak.
:You in? I've got plenty of useful goodies here that you can use to fight like a vulpera!
:{{Gossip|Give me the supplies. I'll defend the vulpera!}}
:{{Text|say|Nisha|This is one of [[Tacha]]'s backpacks. She always keeps them packed with useful stuff!}}
:{{Text|say|Nisha|I'll keep this area safe for fleeing vulpera. Get in that gulch and take down anything attacking my people!}}

This will equip you with the Vulpera for a Day buff, causing [[Caravan Guardian]]s to sometimes appear and aid you.
:{{Abilities|Vulpera for a Day|id=287932|Your attacks and spells have a chance to summon a vulpera to your side for 20 sec.|icon=inv_tabard_vulpera}}

Talking to Nisha again will simply cause her to say:
:They'll die like the sethrak... and anybody else who tries to oppress the vulpera!
