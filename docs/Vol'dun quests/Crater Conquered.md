==Objectives==
Return to [[Vorrik]].

==Description==
I can take it from here, <name>. I'll rally these [[vulpera]] and march through the trenches creating chaos. [[Emperor Korthek|Korthek]] and [[Faithless|his armies]] will be forced to deal with us!

If you and Vorrik are going to make a move, you should do it now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|1|94}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I can hear the vulpera battle cries from here. It seems your friends have given us a window of opportunity. We musn't waste it.

I have a plan.

==Progression==
{{Storming the Spire}}
