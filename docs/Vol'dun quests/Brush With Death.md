==Objectives==
Pick up the quill and begin your trial.

* Use the quill
* First rune drawn
* Second rune drawn
* Third rune drawn

==Description==
<As you open the book, a sudden chill comes over you. You shake the sensation off as you read the verse.>

"A fatal bargain, in blood is struck,<br />
One inks their pledge,<br />
with strokes of luck.<br />
Stay true your lines,<br />
keep still your breath,<br />
Lest you stray too far,<br />
and summon death."

<As you finish reading the incantation, a quill appears next to the book.>

==Rewards==
You will learn how to create: [[:Blood Contract: Oblivion]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|5|85|}}
* 4,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hope you didn't use too much "ink" to sign the book, if you know what I mean.

==Completion==
Well done, young blood scribe.

You can now invoke the Oblivion Contract. It lets you summon a creature that, well let's just say, his bite is bigger than his bark.

He likes to prey on creatures that are on the verge of death, yourself included if you're not too careful.

==Notes==
To make it easier to draw the runes, zoom your camera in and keep the white tip of the quill in the center between the lines.

==Progression==
{{Drawing Blood}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 8.1.5|note=Added.}}
