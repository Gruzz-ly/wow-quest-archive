==Objectives==
Free and arm 8 [[Vulpera Slave]]s in cages.
* Slaves Armed (8)

==Description==
Do you remember [[Into the Dunes|how we met]], <name>? You were trapped in a [[Faithless]] cage, just like the ones in [[Crater of Conquerors|the crater]] below.

Together, we slaughtered Faithless and earned your freedom in blood.

The [[vulpera]] trapped in shackles below can do the same. They just need to be given the chance.

Steal Faithless weapons and give them to the vulpera slaves below. They'll rise up and help you fight the Faithless.

We're going to start a revolt right under their arrogant noses.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 50x [[War Resources]]
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
The vulpera are strong. We just need an opportunity to prove it.

==Completion==
Look at my people fighting! The Faithless don't stand a chance!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|yell|Nisha|Death is at your door, Faithless!}}
:{{Text|yell|Nisha|The fury of the vulpera rises from the sands to demand vengeance. And I will have it!}}

Pick up [[Make Them Fear Us]] before heading into the crater. Loot [[Faithless Weapon Rack]]s around the area for [[Faithless Scimitar]], then talk to Vulpera Slaves around the crater or click the item to give them the weapons, receiving the [https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267489/armed Armed] buff, and free them:
*All I need is a weapon.
*Break these chains, friend. Vulpera were meant to be free.
*Did Nisha send you? Whatever she's got planned, I'm in.
*Free me, <race>, and I'll help you kill the Faithless.
*Give me a weapon and I'll give you ten dead Faithless.
*Just get me a weapon, friend, and I'll take care of the rest.
*No mercy for the Faithless. Not after what they've done.
:{{Gossip|<Free the slave and give them a weapon to fight with.>}}
*{{Text|say|Vulpera Slave|I'll put this sword to good use!}}
*{{Text|say|Vulpera Slave|It feels good to hold a weapon again.}}
*{{Text|say|Vulpera Slave|Kill 'em like Nisha would!}}
*{{Text|say|Vulpera Slave|Let's burn this place to the ground!}}
*{{Text|say|Vulpera Slave|Let's steal some weapons before we go.}}
*{{Text|say|Vulpera Slave|The next Faithless is mine!}}
*{{Text|say|Vulpera Slave|They'll fear the vulpera!}}
*{{Text|say|Vulpera Slave|We vulpera ain't gonna take this any longer!}}

If you don't have the weapon and interact with them, they respond:

:{{Gossip|I'll return when I find a weapon for you.}}
:Look for weapon racks nearby. The Faithless keep them everywhere around here.
:I'll keep my head down until you come back.

After being armed, the slaves run off and begin fighting Faithless around the crater, which can aid in completing [[Make Them Fear Us]].
