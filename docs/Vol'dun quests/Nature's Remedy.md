==Objectives==
Harvest 6 [[Prickly Plum]] in [[Zul'Ahjin]].
* [[Prickly Plum Cactus]] (6)

==Description==
[[Serrik|Your friend]] doesn't have much time left. The [[scorpid]] venom is likely rotting his veins right now.

He will certainly meet death without a cure.

I will help.

The first ingredient I'll need is the root of the prickly plum cactus. Its natural healing properties will make a suitable base for the salve.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Do you have the prickly plum for the salve?

==Completion==
These cactus roots will do nicely.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|[[Warguard Rakera]]|Go. Gather what is needed to heal dis snakeman. I will fill in [[Julwaba]] on what we know.}}

Pick up [[Creeping Death]] before leaving. Prickly Plums are found around Zul'Ahjin.

==Progression==
{{A City of Secrets}}
