==Completion==
It's clear dat [[General Jakra'zet|Jakra'zet]] won't stop until I'm dead.

==Notes==
On accept, Rakera and [[Bladeguard Kaja]] begin following the player around. Talk to Meerah:
:[[Dolly]] and [[Dot (alpaca)|Dot]] have built up quite an appetite. Pulling a cartload of [[Zandalari troll|trolls]] isn't easy work!
:{{Gossip|We're ready to leave.}}

The caravan embarks from the temple, with Kaja, Meerah, and Rakera in the front seat and (as usual) the player in the back seat.
:{{Text|say|Meerah|The ruins are on the way to [[Port of Zem'lan|Zem'lan]]. I'm happy to take you there! Dolly and Dot are great company, but it's nice to have friends to talk to.}}
:{{Text|say|Meerah|We're friends, right?}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|We wouldn't have found Rakera without you, little one.}}

After the wagon passes into the [[Redrock Lowlands]], the journey is interrupted when three [[Sandfury Assassin]]s appear on the road in front of the caravan:
:{{Text|say|Meerah|I don't think those trolls up ahead are friends of yours.}}
:{{Text|yell|Bladeguard Kaja|Those are Jakra'zet's troops!}}

The assassins set fire to the wagon!
:{{Text|yell|Meerah|This isn't good. Not at all. Everybody, out of the wagon! Quick!}}

Everyone jumps off the caravan. Dolly and Dot run off in the direction of Zul'Ahjin and Meerah pursues them:
:{{Text|yell|Meerah|Dolly! Dot! Wait! It's not safe down there!}}

Meanwhile, the three assassins attack Kaja, Rakera, and the player. Dispatch them and then talk to Rakera to turn in.
