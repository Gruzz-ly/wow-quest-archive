}}

==Progress==
The [[vulpera]] appreciate the [[Horde]]'s protection here. I didn't realize the Alliance could be so... relentless.

==Completion==
On behalf of all the denizens of Vol'dun, thank you for your help in pushing back the Alliance invaders.

The people here have suffered enough threats without the Alliance adding to the list.

We will not forget the Horde's sacrifice here, nor yours.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[High Warlord Cromush]]|We did not expect the [[Alliance]] to push into [[Vol'dun]]. Contain their soldiers before they spread too far. Then we'll deal with the root of the problem.}}

;After completing the world quests
:{{Text|say|High Warlord Cromush|Lok-narash! The Alliance has brought in an airship to reinforce their encampment on the northern shore. Bring it down!}}

;Meet up with Lasan
:{{Text|say|[[Lasan Skyhorn]]|When you are ready, champion, [[Aviash]] will carry you to meet this threat.}}
:{{Text|say|Lasan Skyhorn|Be calm, Aviash. <Name> is one of our allies.}}
:{{Text|say|Lasan Skyhorn|There's the airship, just ahead! I'll rain death from above while you tear it apart from the inside!}}

To fill up the bar,
*interact with technological parts and gyrocopters
*kill [[Barnil Blackbarrel]], [[Valrisa Windcoil]], [[7th Legion Marine]]s, [[7th Legion Battlemage (Faction Assaults)|7th Legion Battlemages]], [[Airship Engineer (gnome)|Airship Engineers]], [[Airship Crewman|Airship Crewmen]], and [[Steelbore Cannoneer]]s.

;After blowing up the [[Alliance Airship]]
:{{Text|say|Lasan Skyhorn|The Alliance will think twice before launching their next air raid. The skies belong to the Horde!}}

==PTR version==
{{rfptr-section}}
*[[7th Legion Frostguard]]s also counted.
