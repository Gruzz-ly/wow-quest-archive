==Objectives==
Recover the Skull of the First Skycaller, Rebirth Creed, Sethraliss Sight Stone, and Blood of the Fallen Loa.
* [[Rebirth Creed]]
* [[Skull of the First Skycaller]]
* [[Sethraliss Sight Stone]]
* [[Blood of the Fallen Loa]]

==Description==
It may surprise you to learn that the [[Faithless]] hoard ancient relics of [[Sethraliss]]. I assure you that they do not do so out of reverence or respect, as is proper.

[[Emperor Korthek|Korthek]]'s brood is driven only by greed and an insatiable lust for power. They rip whatever magic they can from the relics, even if it means destroying them in the process.

Rescue the ancient artifacts of Sethraliss in the [[Sacred Sands]] nearby. We will honor and preserve them in the [[Sanctuary of the Devoted]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Do you have the artifacts?

==Completion==
Incredible! I remember when some of these were first found...

You've done all followers of Sethraliss a kindness this day, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|yell|Vorrik|Are you so afraid, old friend, that you hide while your people suffer? Come and end this, Korthek!}}

Pick up [[Infuriating the Emperor]] before heading out. The Vorrik's Bulwark buff granted during that quest greatly helps with collecting the relics, as it instantly kills the large numbers of Faithless mobs surrounding the [[Rebirth Creed]],{{Coords|49.8|28.4|Vol'dun}} [[Skull of the First Skycaller]],{{Coords|50.4|26.6|Vol'dun}} [[Sethraliss Sight Stone]],{{Coords|48.2|26|Vol'dun}} and [[Blood of the Fallen Loa]].{{Coords|49.2|24.2|Vol'dun}}

Upon completing both Relics of Sethraliss and Infuriating the Emperor, Vorrik stops his channeling.
:{{Text|yell|Vorrik|Raagh! Come forward and answer for your crimes, Korthek!}}
