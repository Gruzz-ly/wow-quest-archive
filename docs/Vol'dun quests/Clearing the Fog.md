==Objectives==
Follow [[Warguard Rakera]].

==Description==
Did you lead [[Bladeguard Kaja|Kaja]] here? I told her not to come after me. It isn't safe...

My mind remains fogged, but de memories are slowly returning. [[General Jakra'zet|Jakra'zet]]... [[Mythrax|de weapon]]...

Come, let us find some fresh air. I will tell you what I've discovered.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 50x [[War Resources]]

* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Voldunai]]

[[Princess Talanji|Talanji]] was right not to trust de general. If he succeeds in finding de weapon, our [[Zuldazar|great city]] will fall.

==Notes==
On accept, Rakera and Kaja begin walking out of the [[Temple of Akunda]] down to [[Meerah's Caravan]].
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|It is as I suspected. General Jakra'zet has troops in de desert, unbeknownst to [[Rastakhan|de king]].}}
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|They scour de dunes, searching for a weapon dat can destroy de city, killing any who get in their way.}}
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|I have no idea what dis weapon is, or where to find it, but it can't be good if Jakra'zet is hiding its existence from de king.}}
