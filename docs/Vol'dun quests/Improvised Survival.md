==Objectives==
Gather 15 Zandalari Water Jugs and 15 Zandalari Rations.
* [[Zandalari Dunemelon]] (15)
* [[Zandalari Water Jug]] (15)

==Description==
The entirety of our copter's hold was reserved for bombs. There's actually still a lot of bombs left inside. Unfortunately, that meant that we weren't able to pack sufficient water and rations for our survival.

Desert natives hoard supplies efficiently. I'm certain the [[Zandalari troll]]s up ahead wouldn't miss a few lost supplies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[7th Legion (faction)|7th Legion]]

==Progress==
<Halford nods sternly at you.>

==Completion==
Excellent reconnaissance. Well-done.

<Halford begins distributing water and rations to the others in your group.>

==Progression==
{{Blood on the Sand}}

==Patch changes==
