==Objectives==
Collect Faithless Lightning Rods in the [[Scalefang Outpost]].
* [[Faithless Lightning Rod]] (7)

==Description==
Let me see [[Encrypted Ub3r-Spanner Schematic (1)|the schematic]]...

Yeah, yeah, alright. I can help you.

I am going to need a few things to power my decoder.

I need a way to channel electricity from the air around us. What better than to steal...I mean borrow some lightning rods from the [[sethrak]] that have been trying to steal my tech for weeks now!

I'm sure you'll have to do some "convincing", but you seem like a pretty convincing <race>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I need those rods to do my work, <name>.

==Completion==
Perfect, this should be enough to power my decoder.

Now we're cooking with lightning!

==Notes==
Scalefang Outpost is located slightly northwest of the [[Port of Zem'lan]]. The lightning rods can be dropped by any sethrak mob in that area, as well as contained in [[Faithless Cache]]s.

==Progression==
{{It's Scrap Work...}}
