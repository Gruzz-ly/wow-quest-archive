==Objectives==
Deliver Jorak's Note to B'wizati in [[Zuldazar]].
*[[Sealed Scroll]] (provided)

==Description==
Dis is where we part ways, <name>.

I'm going to take de name [[Akunda]], and start a new life here.

When you find [[Warguard Rakera|Rakera]], and I know you will, give her my thanks.

She saved my life, and I'm going to make sure to live a life dat was worth saving.

If you find yourself back in de city, could you deliver dis note for me? I trust you not to open it, though I doubt you could read my scrawls anyway.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 8,250 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
What is dis?

==Completion==
<B'wizati reads the note and wipes a tear from her eye.>

He may choose to forget, but I choose to remember, no matter what pain it brings me.

At least he is safe. [[Loa]] watch over him.

==Notes==
*B'wizati is located at the [[Zocalo]] in [[Dazar'alor]].{{Coords|54.8|35.4|Zuldazar}}
*If you have already completed [[Clearing the Fog]] when you accept this quest, the text will be slightly different. Instead of "When you find Rakera, and I know you will, give her my thanks. She saved my life," Jorak simply says "Rakera saved my life".

==Progression==
