==Objectives==
Slay 12 [[Sethrak]] in the [[Zul'Ahjin|Ruins]].
* Sethrak slain (12)

==Description==
Everywhere we go, there they are. Sethrak. And it's never the ones you want to see.

It seems they are looking for some key. With this new information, I do not think they are looking in the right place.

Really, as entertaining as it is to confound them, we need to wrap up our work here and move on.

If you could remove some of them, it would greatly help our crew!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
I need to mark this down.

How many sethrak have you killed?

==Completion==
Well done! They must be so irritated. This is great fun!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Rescue the Relics]] before heading out. While in the ruins you can also pick up [[Exterminate the Vermin]], but doing so requires you to be in Avatar of the Desert form, so interact with the [[Scepter of Prescience]] before leaving.

Eligible mobs are [[Sethrak Relic Hunter]]s, [[Sethrak Site Guardian]]s, and [[Foreman Jethek]].

==Progression==
