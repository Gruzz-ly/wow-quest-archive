==Objectives==
Meet [[Vorrik]] at [[Atul'Aman]].

==Description==
[[General Jakra'zet|Jakra'zet]] and his troops attacked while we were away.

[[Serrik]] fought well, but it wasn't enough. The keys are gone, and it's only a matter of time before the barrier is broken.

Your friends have already given chase.

Jakra'zet must not be allowed to resurrect [[Mythrax|Mythrax the Unraveler]]. He must be stopped before it's too late!

We don't have much time.

Meet me at Atul'Aman! We must catch up with [[Bladeguard Kaja|Kaja]] and [[Warguard Rakera|Rakera]] and stop the ritual!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
We must hurry. Your friends are already inside!

==Notes==
On accept, Vorrik runs out the door, mounts his [[pterrordax]], and flies off toward Atul'Aman.

Travel to the entrance of the [[Abandoned Passage]]{{Coords|43|68.2|Vol'dun}} southwest of Atul'Aman proper. The passage is normally blocked by a magical barrier similar to the one on the pyramid itself, but now it has been opened. Vorrik is waiting outside.
