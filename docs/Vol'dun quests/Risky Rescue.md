==Objectives==
Free 4 [[Temple Defender]]s.
* Temple Defenders rescued (4)

==Description==
The [[Faithless]] [[Temple Incursion|incursion]] is just up ahead.

We tried to get ahead of the siege by attacking their camp in the dead of night, but they knew we were coming.

Our troops were quickly overwhelmed.

We called for a retreat, but only a few of us made it out. The fate of those that didn't is unknown...

We don't have the numbers to attempt a rescue ourselves. We can't afford to lose any more fighters.

You're their only hope.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]
*[[Small Azerite Shard]] (100x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Our captive fighters need your help.

==Completion==
We are in your debt, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Building Our Arsenal]] and [[Skycaller Slaughter]] before leaving. Temple Defenders are found locked in [[Sethrak Cage]]s around the [[Temple Incursion]]. Upon being freed:
*{{Text|say|Temple Defender|Avenge those of us who could not be saved.}}
*{{Text|say|Temple Defender|I should be able to make my way to safety.}}
*{{Text|say|Temple Defender|Thank you. I will find my own way out of here.}}
*{{Text|say|Temple Defender|The Faithless must be stopped!}}
*{{Text|say|Temple Defender|You have no idea what they've put us through...}}
