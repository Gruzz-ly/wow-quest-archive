==Objectives==
Collect the Goblin "Mind Enhancer" from [[Warlord Surgios]] in the [[Scalefang Outpost]].
*[[Goblin "Mind Enhancer"]]

==Description==
Okay, I am going to need one more thing from you.

The [[sethrak]] leader, Warlord Surgios, has been a real pain for me.

He stole my mind enhancer. I can't do my work without it. It will make me be able to think much more clearly, and make less...deadly mistakes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have my mind enhancer?

==Completion==
Haha! Take that Surgios! 

Look how cool this thing is! You can see why its{{sic}} so precious now.

==Notes==
Scalefang Outpost is located slightly northwest of the [[Port of Zem'lan]]. Interrupt Surgios' casts and avoid the Reconfigured Perimeter Sentry.
