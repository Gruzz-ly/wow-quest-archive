==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Captain Hartford.jpg|Captain Hartford|Commander of The Siren's Call.}}
Slay Captain Hartford.
*[[Captain Hartford]] slain

==Description==
I'm almost ready to leave [[Vol'dun]] once and for all. There's just one thing left to be done...

We need to murder the captain of the ship.

If Captain Hartford finds out I've deserted, I won't be safe in [[Boralus]] or anywhere else. He'll hunt me to the [[Eastern Kingdoms]] and back if he has to!

This will be dangerous. So you'll want to [[Ashvane Garb|disguise yourself]] before boarding [[Siren's Call|The Siren's Call]].

This will be our last job together. Do it and I'll give you the code to the captain's lockbox. A pirate's bounty!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|38|80}}
*20,560 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A toast to the former captain of The Siren's Call. He was a good man, but good men don't live long around here!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|First Mate Redmond|I'll meet you in the captain's quarters once Hartford is dead. Don't worry about the lockbox; everything inside will be yours!}}

It is best to follow Randall's advice and collect an [[Ashvane Garb]] disguise before heading onto ''The Siren's Call'' to avoid having to fight through the ship's crew members. Captain Hartford is found alone belowdecks at the back of the ship.{{Coords|43.2|90.6|Vol'dun}} After killing him, head outside, upstairs, and into the captain's quarters to find Randall, now wearing a pirate hat and referred to as "Captain Redmond". On completion:
:{{Text|say|Captain Redmond|I'm a man of my word, <class>. The captain's lockbox is all yours!}}
