:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|Settle down, everyone! <Name> gonna come around to each of ya and say hello.}}

This quest requires the player to interact with each of the three skulls around the three corners of the inn. Each skull has multiple dialogue options, each of which elicits a different response from Rhan'ka, but selecting any of them will count as progress toward the quest objective.

;Grenja
:<Grenja looks surprisingly happy for a skull.>
*{{Gossip|Well met!}}
::{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|Grenja be our resident [[bard]]. She'll play any song ya ask her... as long as it's drums. She likes smashing things. Hopefully not ya face, ha! She won't, she won't... she might.}}
*{{Gossip|I bet you'd make a great doorstop.}}
::{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|Good eye, <name>! Back in [[Zuldazar]], Grenja got us outta a lot of sticky situations. She held open, and knocked down, a lot of doors for us... people too, actually.}}

*{{Gossip|<Introduce yourself politely.>}}
::{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|Hold on, she can't hear ya over de incessant pounding of her drum. Take a break, Grenja! <Name> is trying to greet ya. Grenja's our bard, but sometimes she be forgettin' people need to talk in here.}}

;Volni
:<Volni looks like she's stuck in a perpetual state of screaming.>
*{{Gossip|Umm... Hello?}}
::{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|Ha! Volni, be nice. Dey mighta gotten dressed in de dark... Ya not wrong, though!}}

:<Man'zul's eyepatch twitches with magic.>
*{{Gossip|Your eyepatch is very fearsome.}}
::{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|Yes, I heard what <name> said, Man'zul. I still think ya eyepatch be uglier than a [[saurolisk]]'s backside.}}
