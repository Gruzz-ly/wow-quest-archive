*[[Caustic Scorpid Blood]] (20)

==Description==
Guests gotta earn their keep at de [[Goldtusk Inn]]. What say you help me clear out some scorpids at one of our off-site excursion locations? De delightful Dead Man's Pass!

Normally, you'd need to purchase our Warlord Package to be allowed access, but I'll make an exception dis time.

I'll even throw in our Scorpid King Package. Unlimited scorpid blood drinks all day, every day!

Dere's one catch: we're out of scorpid blood. Bring some back and I'll whip up a batch of drinks for us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
My scorpid blood drinks are famous in de [[Goldtusk Gang]]!

==Completion==
I'll hold onto dis blood until we can get back to de inn to make de drinks.

Don't worry, I won't let you miss out on dem. I know you're excited to try my famous scorpid blood drinks!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Rhan'ka's Lost Friend]] before heading to the pass. Caustic Scorpid Blood can drop from any of the deathsnap scorpids in the area.
