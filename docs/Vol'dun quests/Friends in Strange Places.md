==Objectives==
Fly to the [[Sanctuary of the Devoted]].
* [[Tamed Pterrordax|Pterrordax]] mounted {{co|39.1|43.1|Vol'dun}}
* Fly to the Sanctuary of the Devoted

==Description==
I saw a [[Private James|creature]] like [[Sergeant Ermey|your friend here]]. We both were being held captive by my ruthless kin, the [[Faithless]].

Before I was cast aside I gave him something to protect, something most precious. Naturally, I would also like to see your friend's safe return.

My people will lend you their aid. Come, I will call for my pterrordax to take us. Together we shall find where your soldier friend was taken.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh no! The Faithless are attacking the temple!

==Notes==
Upon accept, Vorrik whistles, and a [[Tamed Pterrordax]] flies in. Hop on it:
:{{text|say|Vorrik|Our temple is the last bastion against the Faithless.}}
:{{text|say|Vorrik|Long ago, we three--[[Emperor Korthek|Korthek]], [[Sulthis]], and I--ruled as one. We were entrusted by our [[loa]] to protect three keys which sealed away an ancient and evil power beneath the sands.}}
:{{text|say|Vorrik|But Korthek betrayed us, and Sulthis was slain. Now Korthek and his followers, the Faithless, hunt for me and my key.}}
:{{text|say|Vorrik|The fools! They captured me and searched me, but I had already secretly hidden it somewhere they would not expect.}}
:{{text|say|Vorrik|I snuck it into the pocket of a [[prisoner]] they had just captured. I believe he called himself, "James".}}
:{{text|say|Vorrik|It's imperative for us all that the key remain out of Korthek's hands. Come, our temple is ahead.}}
