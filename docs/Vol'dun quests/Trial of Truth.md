==Objectives==
Speak your name to [[Akunda the Exalted]].

==Description==
Those within [[Temple of Akunda|our temple]] have left their past lives behind. They devote themselves entirely to [[Akunda]].

Dis final test is perhaps de most important.

Dis is de moment of truth.

You will speak your name, as you will be known from dis day forth.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|9|70}}
* 8,250 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
You have proven worthy of entering our temple, Akunda.

==Notes==
Speak to Akunda the Exalted:
:You have lived your life without meaning up until now.
:What you have done and who you have been must be forgotten.
:Speak your true name for all to hear!
* {{Gossip|My name is Akunda the Nimble.}}
* {{Gossip|My name is Akunda the Serene.}}
* {{Gossip|My name is Akunda the Courageous.}}
* {{Gossip|My name remains unchanged.}}
* {{Gossip|I defeated the [[Burning Legion]]. Seriously? You don't know who I am?}}
* {{Gossip|The tales of my triumph over the [[Lich King]] didn't reach your shores?}}
* {{Gossip|I slayed [[Deathwing]]. Surely you've heard of me?}}

Of the reply options, only the first three are valid. Choosing any of the latter four will elicit a negative response from Akunda the Exalted:
:{{Gossip|My name remains unchanged.}}
::It would be wise to rethink your answer.
:{{Gossip|I defeated the Burning Legion. Seriously? You don't know who I am?}}
::I only know Akunda.
:{{Gossip|The tales of my triumph over the Lich King didn't reach your shores?}}
::I ask your name, yet you tell stories?
:{{Gossip|I slayed Deathwing. Surely you've heard of me?}}
::Deathwing? What kind of feeble creature has such a name?
In all four cases, the player has the option to go back and try again:
:{{Gossip|On second thought...}}

Choosing one of the first three will complete the quest objective and cause the player to be granted the "Akunda" buff, which simply states "You are Akunda." and causes the player's character name to be displayed as "Akunda the Courageous", "Akunda the Nimble", or "Akunda the Serene" whenever they visit the Temple of Akunda for the rest of the questline until [[Ending the Madness]]. Beyond this, the player's choice between Courageous, Nimble, and Serene has no impact on gameplay. For now:
:{{Text|say|Akunda the Exalted|Welcome, Akunda de <Courageous/Nimble/Serene>.}}

On completion, the lightning barrier preventing entry in to the temple proper disappears. Akunda the Exalted turns around and walks into the temple.
:{{Text|say|Akunda the Exalted|You are ready to hear Akunda's words, though it must be done alone. Head to de altar and pray when you are ready.}}
