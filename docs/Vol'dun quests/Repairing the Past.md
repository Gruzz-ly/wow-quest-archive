==Objectives==
Protect Meijani while she repairs Akunda's mind.
* Meijani protected

==Description==
Dis explains why de [[loa]] has been silent. Akunda himself has forgotten who he is!

Someone or something must be abusing his power.

We won't know how to help without speaking to de loa.

I can perform a ritual dat may repair Akunda's mind, but it is not without risk.

You will receive:
* {{Cost|38|80}}
* 20,550 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
I seek your help, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept, Meijani begins walking a short distance southwest into the [[Forgotten Hollow]].
:{{Text|say|Meijani|I will do my best to repair Akunda's mind, but you need to be prepared to subdue any memories dat might be awakened.}}

Once in the hollow, Meijani begins the ritual, periodically spawning [[Fractured Memory|Fractured Memories]]. After killing two of them in sequence:
:{{Text|say|Meijani|It's almost done! I can hear Akunda's voice entering my mind.}}

After the player dispatches a third Fractured Memory, a [[Distorted Memory]] spawns. After killing it, a projection of Akunda appears, and Meijani kneels down before him.
:{{Text|say|Akunda|My dear child. At last you can hear me. [[Akunda the Exalted|A traitor]] lurks within [[Temple of Akunda|our temple]].}}

Speak to Akunda to turn in.
