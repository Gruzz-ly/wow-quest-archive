==Objectives==
Collect 8 Roasted Buzzard.
*[[Roasted Buzzard]] (8)
*[[Sezahjin's Trusty Vulture Bow]] (provided)

==Description==
Have you ever tried my delicious Vol'duni fried chicken?

Me neither! Probably because dere aren't any [[chicken]]s in [[Vol'dun]].

Dere are plenty of [[vulture]]s, though. Why don't you see if you can find some tasty vulture meat?

De secret to delicious fried chicken is to roast de meat before you fry it, but it only works if de meat is fresh.

I've soaked dese arrows in [[alpaca]] fat. If you ignite de arrows and shoot down de birds, dey'll start cooking before dey're even dead!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Uncle Sezahjin's Fried Chicken]] x2
*[[Small Azerite Fragment]] (75x [[Azerite (resource)]])
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Do you have de buzzard meat?

==Completion==
It may not be chicken, but it's food! With enough seasoning nobody will know de difference.

Everything tastes like chicken, right?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Sezahjin|The desert is a desolate place, but there's food to be found if you know where to look!}}

[[Fattened Buzzard]]s are found around the [[Scorched Sands Arena]]. Use [[Sezahjin's Trusty Vulture Bow]] to set them on fire, then kill them and loot [[Roasted Buzzard]] from them.

On completion:
:{{Text|say|Sezahjin|These may not be the most delicious ingredients, but they keep us fed.}}

After completing this quest, [[Uncle Sezahjin's Fried Chicken]] becomes available for purchase from Sezahjin.
