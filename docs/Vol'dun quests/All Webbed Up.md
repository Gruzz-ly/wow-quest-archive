==Objectives==
Free 8 [[Tortaka Tribesman]].{{sic}}
*Tortaka freed (8)

==Description==
The lower ruins of [[Temple of Kimbul|the temple]] are covered in thick webs and spider egg sacs.

Some of our tribesman{{sic}} went down to the lower ruins to clear out the spiders, but they haven't come back.

I fear for their safety.

Please head into the lower ruins and free our brethren before it's too late.

You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Please rescue our tribesmen before it's too late.

==Completion==
Thank you for rescuing our trapped tribesman.{{sic}} We'll be more careful in dealing with the infestation in the future.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Blessing of Kimbul]] and [[Jungleweb Infestation]] before heading out. On accept:
:{{Text|say|Tulu|We need to clear out the spiders before our tribe can take refuge here.}}

[[Jungleweb Victim]]s are found across the [[Terrace of the Fang]]. Destroy the webs to free the victims inside. Sometimes this will take the form of a {{rep|hostile}} [[Ashvane Smuggler]] or [[Sethrak Fangstalker]] that attack the player as soon as they are freed. When the victim is a [[Tortaka Tribesman]], they'll say one of the following before running off:
*{{Text|say|I can breathe again! Thanks!}}
*{{Text|say|Sneaky spiders!}}
*{{Text|say|Thanks! That was a close one...}}
*{{Text|say|Thanks, <name>! I owe you my life.}}

==Progression==
{{Tortaka Refuge}}
