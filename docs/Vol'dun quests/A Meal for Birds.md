==Objectives==
Kill wildlife within [[Brine Basin|The Brine Basin]] so Mekaru's [[buzzard]]s can eat.
* Buzzards fed (8)

==Description==
I don't know why I agreed to this. We weren't supposed to be scavenging.

[[Kiro]] gave me specific instructions to head to the basin and feed the buzzards.

I can't go back to [[Vulpera Hideaway|camp]] until they eat, but I'm not heading into that basin while the [[sethrak]] are still swarming.

Have you ever fed a buzzard? It's easy, I promise.

You kill it, they eat it. That simple.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|Small Azerite Shard
}}

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
They still look hungry to me.

==Completion==
I don't think I've ever seen these buzzards so satiated. How much did you feed them exactly?

Doesn't matter. You saved my tail, for sure.

==Notes==
On accept, the player immediately starts being accompanied by two [[Ravenous Buzzard]]s. Killing any combination of [[Saltspine Krolusk]]s, [[Brine Beetle]]s, [[Krolusk Dunemite]]s, or [[Bonebeak Vulture]]s in or around the Brine Basin will automatically feed them. After being fed 8 times, the buzzards fly away and despawn. Return to Mekaru to turn in the quest.
