==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Crawg Tamer Traskniss.jpg|Crawg Tamer Traskniss|Kill Crawg Tamer Traskniss to unleash a horde of crawgs!}}
Kill Tamer Traskniss to release the [[crawg]]s.
* [[Crawg Tamer Traskniss]] slain

==Description==
The [[Faithless]] are arrogant hoarders, capturing people and beasts that can never be truly tamed. All to fuel their endless lust for war.

I've even seen their slavers dragging [[blood troll]]s and other dark monsters from the swamps of [[Nazmir]].

I heard terrible noises coming out of a cave while I was scouting the feeding pits up ahead.

Whatever monsters they are hiding in there, find a way to free them and let them exact revenge on the Faithless.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive one of the following rewards:
|Cracked Crawg Shackles
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|38|80}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Crawgs are nasty beasts. Don't get too close.

==Completion==
Crawgs are violent, filty things... Yet another reason to avoid Nazmir.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Untame Slaughter]] before heading into the pits. Traskniss is found inside a cave (that is oddly labeled as part of the [[Serpent's Maw]] subzone) at {{Coords|55.4|30.8|Vol'dun}} along with a large pack of [[Suppressed Crawg]]s. Upon killing Traskniss, the crawgs become [[Released Crawg]]s and stampede out of the cave and away from the Feeding Pits, killing any Faithless that happen to be in their way.

==Progression==
