Meet [[Xal'atath]] at the [[Precipice of Oblivion]].
* Xal'atath found

* [[Trident of Deep Ocean (quest item)]] placed
* [[Tempest Caller (item)]] placed
* [[Gift of N'Zoth|Gift]] received
* Tell [[Brother Pike]] of what transpired here.

==Description==
The relics are ours... as it was meant to be.

There is but one more step needed for the great truths to be revealed.

The [[naga]] sought to summon their storm from a place that echoes with ancient power. Though this site has had countless names over the ages, you mortals know it as the [[Precipice of Oblivion]].

I will go on ahead and begin preparations. Join me there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We are so close now... to the end.

==Completion==
<[[Brother Pike]] listens to your tale of Xal'atath and [[N'Zoth]].>

Dark tidings indeed, <name>.

I could sense something stirring beneath the waves. If the [[Old God]] is on the rise, we must make ready.

==Notes==
[[File:Twist the Knife.jpg|thumb|Xal'atath at the Precipice of Oblivion.]]
Xal'atath waits outside the entrance to the [[Crucible of Storms]] raid. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath|Here we are. Do not be afraid. This was always meant to be.}}
:''She disappears.''

[[File:Twist the Knife - Tendril of Corruption.jpg|thumb|Xal'atath and N'Zoth's closed eye in the Tendril of Corruption.]]
Run through the instance portal to enter a phased version of the [[Tendril of Corruption]] in the [[Crucible of Storms]], where Xal'atath waits in front of [[N'Zoth]]'s closed eye. The way back is blocked by a Void barrier. Interact with the ghost images that appear one after the other to place the relics.

;Void Stone placed
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath|A stone to call forth the darkness...}}

;Trident of Deep Ocean placed
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath|A weapon forged in the depths...}}

;Tempest Caller placed
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath|A crown for the ruler of all worlds...}}

[[File:Twist the Knife - Xal'atath and dagger.jpg|thumb|''"The blade must remain to serve my will."'']]
An [[Battle for Azeroth in-game cinematics|in-game cinematic]] plays:
:''Xal'atath and the [[adventurer]] (with the blade in hand) approach N'Zoth's eye as she speaks.''
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath|Hear me, God of the Deep! I have brought you the Opener... the Bringer of Truths... the Torch That Lights the Way!}}
:''The adventurer looks over at Xal'atath at the mention of "the Opener". Dark energies take control of the adventurer and lifts them into the air, the blade being dropped in the process. Xal'atath walks up further.''
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath|Honor our bargain... free me to find my own fate!}}
:{{Text|say|N'Zoth|Go... but the blade must remain... to serve my will.}}
:''Xal'atath glances back at her old vessel, then to N'Zoth.''
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath|A fair exchange. Shadows guide you, my dear friend.}}
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath|We will meet again... I am certain of it.}}
:''Xal'atath departs through a [[Void]] portal.''
:{{Text|say|N'Zoth|I have dreamed your destiny, mortal.}}
:''The large, closed eye opens.''
:{{Text|say|N'Zoth|The hour is close at hand.}}
:{{Text|say|N'Zoth|That which was [[Nazjatar|sunken]] shall rise.}}
:{{Text|say|N'Zoth|All that were [[Ny'alotha|sleeping]]... shall be awakened.}}
:''Another, smaller Void portal opens in midair. Tendrils are seen writhing from it.''
:{{Text|say|N'Zoth|Receive my gift and see all truths before you.}}
:''A single, larger tendril than the rest stabs the adventurer's head. The latter reappears outside the Crucible... with the [[Gift of N'Zoth]] encircled around their head.''

{{dialogue|
{{Gossip|I have been given a "gift". Do you know how to remove it?}}

Something dark is growing within you, <name>.

I can sense the tendrils of N'Zoth burrowing into your mind and soul.

{{Gossip|Is that why I can see N'Zoth's eye on so many people?}}

You see eyes everywhere?!? This is more dire than I expected.

Do not trust what you are seeing. These "eyes" are surely just N'Zoth's influence within your mind, deceiving you.}}
