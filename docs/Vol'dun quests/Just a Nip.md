==Objectives==
Collect 10 samples of Atrivax Gel.
*[[Atrivax Gel Sample]] (10)

==Description==
My tough-guys-in-training are quick learners!

They do seem to get a bit... bitey... when they're grouchy, though. Too many, and I start to get a little light-headed.

The nearby atrivax plants have a medicinal gel. It is great to treat fresh wounds and nullify venom.

They don't like sharing it. Could you harvest a bit for me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
How goes the juicing?

==Completion==
Thanks, <name>! That should do the trick!

At least it will tide me over until they realize we're on the same side.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Charming Tail]] before leaving. On accept:
:{{Text|say|Jenoh|I'll wait here in case any find their way home!}}
:''Jenoh lies down on the ground and falls asleep.''

[[Atrivax Gel Sample]] drops from the nearby [[Atrivax Lasher]]s and [[Atrivax Lashlet]]s.
