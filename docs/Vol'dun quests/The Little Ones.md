==Objectives==
Kill [[Appraiser Versik]] and lead the [[vulpera]] kids back to Meerah.
* Appraiser Versik slain
* Lead the [[Vulpera Kid]]s back to Meerah.

==Description==
Just when I thought the [[Faithless]] couldn't get any worse, I find out that they're keeping vulpera [[child]]ren trapped down in [[Crater of Conquerors|that crater]]!

The other vulpera we rescued told me that a big [[sethrak]], Appraiser Versik, is inspecting them on the central platform to determine what he can sell them for.

Selling vulpera kids! Oooh, those Faithless make me so angry!

Please, <name>. I'm no fighter. I can't rescue those kids. But if you bring them up here to me, I promise I'll get them out of here safely.

==Progress==
The Faithless are heartless!

==Completion==
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

These children have already experienced more hate and pain than anyone ever should. I'll make sure they feel love in equal measure.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Meerah|The kids are being held in the crater below. Please be careful!}}

Before delving into the [[Crater of Conquerors]] and killing Versik, complete [[Allies in Anarchy]] and accept [[Make Them Fear Us]] and [[Ready to Riot]] from [[Nisha]] so you can work on multiple objectives at the same time in the crater.

Versik is located atop the platform in the eastern end of the crater{{Coords|48.6|32.4|Vol'dun}} with a group of four Vulpera Kids cowering in front of him. Upon killing Versik, the children begin following the player around.
:{{Text|say|Vulpera Kid|I told you Meerah wouldn't forget about us! She's the best!}}

Lead them back to Meerah at [[Vorrik's Sanctum]] to turn in. After completion of the quest, [[Rescued Kid]]s appear in the sanctum, a testament to the player's actions.
:{{Text|say|Rescued Kid|Mom! Meerah and <name> saved us!}}
