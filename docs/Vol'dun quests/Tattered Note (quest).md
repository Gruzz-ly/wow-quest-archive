==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Shath'kar.jpg|Shath'kar|[[Sethrak]] trapper who enjoys watching prisoners suffer.}}
Slay Shath'kar in the [[Slithering Gulch]].
* [[Shath'kar]] slain

==Description==
<The short, hand-written note is scrawled in blood.>

They captured me soon after I was exiled. I was too weak to be a [[slave]] and too starved to be food for the [[beast]]s.

They were going to kill me, but one called Shath'kar intervened. He said it would be amusing to watch me starve to death among his [[prisoner]]s.

I have not lived a good life. I deserve nothing. But, to any fellow [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] who finds this, I have one request...

Stick a blade in Shath'kar's belly and twist it until the snake is dead!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|38|80}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
If you find any other [[vulpera]] in trouble, send them my way.

==Completion==
I've heard the other vulpera whisper Shath'kar's name in fear. Thank you for ridding us of him.

==Notes==
Shath'kar is located at {{Coords|54.4|33.2|Vol'dun}}, torturing some [[Vulpera Slave]]s and/or [[Zandalari Exile]]s. Aggroing him will also aggro his pet [[Gutgut]].

After killing Shath'kar, head to [[Vorrik's Sanctum]]{{Coords|48|36.4|Vol'dun}} and turn in to [[Meerah]].

==Progression==
{{Storming the Spire}}
