==Objectives==
Search for survivors near the crash site.
* [[Bladeguard Tarkaj|Tarkaj]] found
* [[Bladeguard Jorana|Jorana]] found

==Description==
It is good to see you are safe, but what of de others? Have dey been lost to de sands?

You need to head back to de crash site and see if de others survived.

I will ask around and see if these [[Vulpera|fox people]] can tell us anything about [[Warguard Rakera|Rakera]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
We all knew de risk in coming to de desert...

==Completion==
Jorana knew de risks when she agreed to enter de sands, but I still can't help but feel responsible for her death.

I can only hope dat Tarkaj somehow made his way to safety.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Knickknack Takeback]] and [[Secrets in the Sand]] before heading out. While on the quests, be sure to also pick up [[A Meal for Birds]] and [[Aided Escape]] from [[Neri]] and [[Mekaru]] at the wagon west of the [[Brine Basin]].

Heading to the [[Serpent's Maw]] reveals a dead [[pterrordax]] mount lying near the mouth of a cave. Inside the cave, there are three dead [[sethrak]], one of which has [[Tarkaj's Warblade]]{{Coords|54.6|39.2|Vol'dun}} lodged in its neck. Interact with the blade:
:Covered with fresh blood, this blade has seen recent battle.
:With no corpse nearby, it appears whomever wielded it managed to escape.

Bladeguard Jorana's corpse is found next to her dead pterrordax at {{Coords|57.4|40.6|Vol'dun}} in the Brine Basin. Interact with the body to check her pulse:
:{{Text|bossemote|Bladeguard Jorana is unresponsive.}}

On completion of Knickknack Takeback, Searching for Survivors, and Secrets in the Sand:
:{{Text|say|[[Kiro]]|[[Meerah]], ready the wagon and be prepared to pick up supplies at the port. Our new allies can ride along and continue their search.}}
:{{Text|say|KIro|It's time to put [[Nisha]]'s plan into action. The sethrak will never see us coming.}}
