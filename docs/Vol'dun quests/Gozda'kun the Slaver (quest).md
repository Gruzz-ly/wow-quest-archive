==Notes==
Upon accepting all three of Gozda'kun the Slaver, [[The Great Cranium Caper]], and [[The Best Honey In Vol'dun]], Rhan'ka mounts up on a white [[hyena]].
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|Go get 'em, <name>! Me and [[Zulsan]] gonna meet you back at de inn.}}

He then immediately rides off back to the Goldtusk Inn. Along the way, he passes by [[Rikati]] at the [[Four Stingers]].
:{{Text|yell|Rhan'ka|No time to talk, Rikati! De sandfury{{sic}} be on a rampage! Hide ya honey!}}
:{{Text|yell|Rikati|Okay, buddy. Will do! Thanks!}}
:{{Text|emote|Rikati rolls his eyes.}}
:{{Text|say|Rikati|That troll's crazier than a bag of [[ranishu]].}}

Gozda'kun is found in the center of the Sandfury Hideout,{{Coords|47|58.6|Vol'dun}} amusing himself by throwing spears at [[Kidnapped Mind Slave]]s.

After completing all three quest objectives, head back to Rhan'ka at the inn. The inn has been trashed by the Sandfury, and when the player arrives, Rhan'ka is cowering inside a cauldron in a corner of the cave.
:{{Text|yell|Rhan'ka|No need to come in here, Sandfury! Nothin' here but us bananas.}}
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|Oh, is dat you, <name>? De Sandfury didn't follow you, did dey?}}

After turning in The Great Cranium Caper, Gozda'kun the Slaver, and [[Unconventional Aromatics]], Rhan'ka emerges from the cauldron, walks over to a corner of the inn, and places a cup of [[Boiled Scorpid Blood]] on a rock.
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|It be safe to come out now?}}
:{{Text|say|Rhan'ka|[[Grenja]]! [[Volni]]! [[Man'zul]]! You be back! De gang's all here!}}
