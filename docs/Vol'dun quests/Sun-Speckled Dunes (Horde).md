==Objectives==
Go to the location on your map where you believe these gems to be and recover 8 of them. Polish and shape them when you've collected enough.

* [[Polished Fire Spinel]] (8)

==Description==
<Looking at your notes, the [[earthen]] mentions coming across dunes sprinkled with orange gems. He said it reminded him of the soft sunlight in this area.

Checking your notes, it appears that these dunes were located south of your current location.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<These gems have a very strong structure. Time, in addition to the winds, must have also taken its toll on them.>

==Completion==
<You carefully remove the old, weathered gems from the shrine and replace your polished gems in their place.

As you place the final gem, a similar pulse of energy radiates from the shrine as the light in the area seems to draw into it. A strange glow now emanating from the shrine leads you to believe it is once again active.>

==Notes==
The [[Rough Fire Spinel]] can be found at the [[Bone Pit]]. Look for burning-orange specks in the sand, while being careful to avoid [[Sandscout Vesarik]].

==Progression==
{{A Rocky Start (Horde)}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 8.1.5|note=Added.}}
