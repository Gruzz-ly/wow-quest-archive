==Objectives==
Ride [[Rakjan the Unbroken]] and kill [[Faithless]].
* Rakjan the Unbroken mounted
* Faithless slain (60)
* [[Electric Wall|Spire barrier]] destroyed

==Description==
[[Emperor Korthek]] hides deep in his stolen temple below ground. We must create such chaos that he has no choice but to emerge to face us.

The [[vulpera]] riot is a good start, but it will not be enough. Alone, they are no match for the Faithless army.

Thankfully, they are not alone.

We will ride the mighty Rakjan through the skies. While you throw lightning bombs, I'll use my charged staff to blast the Faithless armies below.

Let us hope that is enough to lure out Korthek. I am eager to finish this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|38|80}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
Emperor Korthek is certainly on his way to us by now. We must prepare quickly.

==Notes==
Upon interacting with Rakjan, both the player and Vorrik jump up on the back of the [[pterrordax]], who flies down from [[Rakjan's Peak]] to swoop over the [[Crater of Conquerors]] and the [[Slithering Gulch]], both of which are filled with Faithless. The player has access to the following abilities, as well as the option to return to Rakjan's Peak.
* {{Abilities|Lightning Bomb|id=272301|Lob a lightning bomb at the target location, inflicting heavy damage to all enemies within 14 yards of the impact.|icon=inv_jewelcrafting_dragonseye04}}
* {{Abilities|Vorrik's Barrage|id=265551|Order Vorrik to unleash the power of his staff to destroy the Faithless Barrier. Requires Vorrik to be ready and Rakjan to be positioned in front of the barrier.|icon=spell_shaman_maelstromweapon}}

Vorrik's Barrage is initially unavailable. Throw Lightning Bombs at [[Faithless Oppressor]]s, [[Faithless Ravager]]s, and [[Faithless Slaver]]s below. Upon killing the required 60, Rakjan automatically flies over to near the [[Skycallers' Spire]], where the [[Electric Wall]] blocks the way to the temple.
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|The Faithless are blocking the way to Emperor Korthek. We must destroy that barrier!}}

Use the now available Vorrik's Barrage to have Vorrik dispel the barrier.
:{{Text|yell|Vorrik|FOR [[Sethraliss|SETHRALISS]]!}}

Rakjan drops Vorrik and the player off just past the entrance to the Skycallers' Spire. Armed [[Vulpera Slave]]s can be found nearby, guarding the area and tending to their wounded. [[Nisha]] is standing just to the west. Talk to Vorrik, who is now channeling on the large, jagged crystal in the center of the terrace.
