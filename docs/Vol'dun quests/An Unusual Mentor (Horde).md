==Objectives==
Find [[Patu]] in [[Vol'dun]].

==Description==
You have done well so far, <name>, but dere is still much more for you to learn. I think it is time for you to meet an old '[[Patu|friend]]'.

Dere is no better person I know of to teach you about [[Akunda's Bite|akunda's bite]], as his knowledge and respect for de plant is unrivaled.

Head North beyond the desert of Vol'dun. Dere you will find a [[tortollan]] who will teach you more about de desert flower.

==Completion==
You seek knowledge on akunda's bite? Marvelous plant, but surprisingly delicate given the harsh environment. Only the strongest will survive...

Hmmm... Yes, you'll do nicely.  If you assist me in my work, I would be willing to provide you with some insights.
