==Objectives==
Fly into the deserts of [[Vol'dun]] and search for [[Warguard Rakera]].
*[[Pterrordax (Zandalar)|Pterrordax]] mounted

==Description==
Whatever Rakera uncovered, it was important enough to earn her a death sentence to de sands.

We must head into Vol'dun to find her.

We cannot let whatever she knows about [[General Jakra'zet|Jakra'zet]] die with her in de dunes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
These snakemen will pay for what they've done to my home.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|We'll ride when you're ready, but let's not waste time. Rakera won't last long in de sands.}}
Interact with Kaja's pterrordax to mount it alongside the Bladeguard. The beast immediately sets off north alongside [[Bladeguard Jorana]] and [[Bladeguard Tarkaj]].
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|We'll need to travel through [[Nazmir|de swamp]]. As long as we stay in de air and out of sight, we shouldn't have too much trouble.}}
While flying over the [[Fallen Outpost]]:
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Jorana|Kaja, beneath us! What are those things?}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|Let's keep flying and hope we don't find out.}}
While passing over the [[Shoaljai Tar Pits]] and approaching the [[Prisoners' Pass]]:
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|Up ahead! I see de pass! Fly low, and keep an eye out for any sign of Rakera.}}
After passing into Vol'dun, the [[Temple of Sethraliss]] becomes visible in the distance:
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Tarkaj|Kaja, we should adjust course. We're nearing de [[sethrak]] [[Faithless|empire]].}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|De serpent men? I thought dey hid mostly beneath de dunes...}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Tarkaj|It appears their presence has grown.}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|So it has... Let's head west and avoid any unnecessary conflict.}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Tarkaj|It might be too late for dat.}}
Above the [[Brine Basin]], a cutscene begins.

:''General Jakra'zet and [[Emperor Korthek]] are walking up a broken bridge. Their pterrordax and [[krolusk]] mounts can be seen in the background.''
:{{Text|say|General Jakra'zet|We need ta speed things up. [[Rastakhan|Da King]] has [[Horde|nosey visitors]]... dat could pose a problem.}}
:{{Text|say|Emperor Korthek|You do your part, General, and I will do mine.}}
:''Jakra'zet and Korthek stop at the end of the bridge to observe a force of sethrak soldiers. Jakra'zet notices the pterrordax trio passing overhead.''
:{{Text|say|General Jakra'zet|Trespassers!}}
:{{Text|say|Emperor Korthek|You will die in these dunes...}}
:''Korthek conjures a ball of lightning in his hands and hurls it at Bladeguard Jorana's pterrordax, blasting it out of the sky.''
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|Everyone, break ranks! Make your way to safety! Get as far from dese snakes as you can!}}
:''The pterrordax ridden by Kaja and the player is struck by lightning, and the beast plummets to the ground.''

After a black screen, the player finds themselves in a sethrak cage in the [[Shrouded Hollow]]. Two sethrak are discussing what to do with them while the player is stunned.
:{{Text|say|[[Sethrak Aggressor]]|We have orders to kill this one.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Sethrak Ravager]]|Let us make it suffer.}}

Suddenly, [[Nisha]] appears and kills the sethrak.
:{{Text|yell|Nisha|Not today, snakemen!}}
:{{Text|say|Nisha|You still alive in there? Any good with that weapon of yours?}}
:{{Text|say|Nisha|I'm all out of potions and there's a whole lot of sethrak between me and my wagon.}}
Nisha opens the player's cage.
:{{Text|say|Nisha|If you're willing to fight, I could sure use some help.}}
