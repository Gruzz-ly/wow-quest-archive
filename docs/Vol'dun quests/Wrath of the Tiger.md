[[File:Avatar of Kimbul.jpg|thumb|Avatar of Kimbul]]
;Talk to Kimbul
:{{Gossip|Send me to the battlefield.}}

The player is transformed into a magical [[wisp]] that flies out of the [[Temple of Kimbul]], over the [[Terrace of the Fang]], and down onto the [[Shrouded Shore]], where an army of [[Stormcoil Berserker]]s, [[Stormcoil Dragoon]]s, and [[Stormcoil Tide-Hunter]]s are invading from the sea. Berserkers are attacking the walls of the terrace directly while Dragoons slither up the stairs and Tide-Hunters hurl spears at the walls from a distance.

Upon landing on the shore, the player is automatically transformed into a powerful Avatar of Kimbul with the following abilities:
*{{Abilities|Swipe|id=267206|Swipe nearby enemies, inflicting Physical damage across multiple targets.|icon=inv_misc_monsterclaw_03|notes=8 yd range. 1 sec cooldown.}}
*{{Abilities|Claw|id=267480|Claw nearby enemies, inflicting Physical damage across multiple targets.|icon=artifactability_feraldruid_ashamanesbite|notes=8 yd range. 3 sec cooldown.}}
*{{Abilities|Dash|id=267210|Increases movement speed by 40%.|icon=ability_druid_dash_orange|notes=30 sec cooldown.}}
*{{Abilities|Frenzied Regeneration|id=267208|Heals you for 40% of maximum health over 10 sec.|icon=ability_physical_taunt|notes=1 min cooldown.}}

If the player leaves the Shrouded Shore subzone, they are informed that:
:{{Text|bossemote|You are leaving the designated area and will be removed from your vehicle.}}
...and shortly transformed back into their regular form. If they re-enter the Shrouded Shore, they can turn back into the Avatar of Kimbul using the extra action button Tiger's Wrath:
:{{Abilities|Tiger's Wrath|id=267188|Transform into the avatar of Eraka no Kimbul.|icon=ability_druid_tigersroar}}

As the Avatar of Kimbul, the player can make quick work of the Stormcoil army, as most of the naga will instantly die from only one or a handful of the avatar's abilities. While the player is killing naga, the off-screen [[Stormcoil Commander]] will yell various commands, starting after the player kills their first naga:
:{{Text|say|Stormcoil Commander|Destroy the temple! Leave no stone unbroken, no statue standing! All shall kneel before our queen!}}

Around 30 kills:
:{{Text|say|Stormcoil Commander|Fools! How can you die to the [[loa]] of a ruined temple with no followers?! Kill him!}}

As soon as the player kills 45 naga, they're transformed back into a wisp that flies back to the Temple of Kimbul.
:{{Text|say|Stormcoil Commander|The loa is too powerful! Retreat to the safety of the ocean! The battle is lost!}}

Back at the temple, Kimbul has now been joined by numerous [[Tortaka Refugee]]s and [[Tortaka Tribesman|Tortaka Tribesmen]]. Talk to the tiger loa to turn in.

;On completion
:{{Text|say|Kimbul|You have faced the naga as my avatar and brought an end to the assault on my temple.}}
:{{Text|say|Kimbul|I can now accept the Tortaka as followers. This temple will forever be a place of refuge for their tribe.}}

==Progression==
