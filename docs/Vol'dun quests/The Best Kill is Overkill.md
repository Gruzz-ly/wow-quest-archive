==Objectives==
Kill 15 predators in the [[Whistlebloom Oasis]].
*Whistlebloom predators slain (15)

==Description==
I watched you kill those [[Farraki tribe|Sandfury]] earlier, <name>. You have blood instinct. I like dat.

I bet de others have you hunting frivolous luxuries for the inn. I'll give you an assignment worth your talents.

Dis oasis is full of dangerous beasts dat'll scare away guests and harrass{{sic}} my [[pterrordax]]es flying in and out.

Kill dem.

Once de skies are clear, my pterrordaxes can fly you wherever you want.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Are de skies clear?

==Completion==
Dere are still plenty of things for our guests to kill for recreation. At least now, dey won't be hunted on their way in.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Watch out for [[saurolisk]]s lurking on the ridge above... they like to pounce.}}

Kill 15 of the [[wasp]]s ([[Whistlebloom Harvester]]s, [[Whistlebloom Impaler]]s, [[Whistlebloom Sentry|Whistlebloom Sentries]], or [[Whistlebloom Drone]]s) or [[saurolisk]]s ([[Whistlebloom Hunter]]s or [[Whistlebloom Hatchling]]s) around the oasis to complete this objective.

Completing this quest turns Volni into a [[flight master]] and unlocks the Goldtusk Inn flight point.
