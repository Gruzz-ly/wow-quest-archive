==Objectives==
Question Enforcers within [[Dazar'alor]].
*Enforcers questioned (3)
*Find someone willing to talk

==Description==
[[General Jakra'zet]] cannot be trusted.

He is up to something, but I do not know what.

Any who question his actions earn demselves a trip to [[Vol'dun|de sands]].

As long as he remains in power, [[Zuldazar|my city]] will never be safe.

Speak to his guards. See what you can find out, but be discreet. We do not want to alert Jakra'zet to our actions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70}}
*1,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It is not safe to ask questions about de general around here.

==Completion==
You are going to make more enemies than allies asking questions like dat around here.

==Notes==
Question the three Enforcers [[Enforcer Dakanji|Dakanji]]{{Coords|54.4|36|Dazar'alor}}, [[Enforcer Gortok|Gortok]]{{Coords|52.2|37.8|Dazar'alor}}, and [[Enforcer Sekal|Sekal]]{{Coords|50|37.4|Dazar'alor}} around Dazar'alor. Each one has a different response when talked to:

Enforcer Dakanji:
:Out with it, <name>. I don't get paid to chat.
:{{Gossip|What can you tell me about General Jakra'zet?}}
:{{Text|say|I do not ask questions. I follow orders. It would be wise for you to do de same.}}

Enforcer Gortok:
:I have little time for idle chatter.
:{{Gossip|What can you tell me about General Jakra'zet?}}
:{{Text|say|Why do you ask such questions? Are you trying to get sent to de sands?}}

Enforcer Sekal:
:Whatever you need, make it quick.
:{{Gossip|What can you tell me about General Jakra'zet?}}
:{{Text|say|Do you have a death wish? De general has eyes and ears everywhere.}}

At certain points during the quest, the player will also be ambushed by Jakra'zet's [[Sandfury Assassin]]s.
*{{Text|say|Sandfury Assassin|Jakra'zet sends his regards!}}
*{{Text|say|Sandfury Assassin|Jakra'zet wants dis one dead!}}
*{{Text|say|Sandfury Assassin|Dere is a price on your head!}}

After questioning all of the enforcers, head to near the northeastern stairs to find [[Bladeguard Kaja]] and turn in the quest. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|Hey you! Yes, you. Are you de one dat's been asking around about de general?}}
