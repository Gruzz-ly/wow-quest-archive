==Objectives==
Collect 5 Weathered Satchels from [[Sandfury Assassin]]s.
* [[Weathered Satchel]] (5)

==Description==
One within our group spoke of a [[Temple of Akunda|temple in de mountains]] dat welcomes exiles, though none are permitted to enter without an offering to [[Akunda|their loa]].

I would have given anything to find some solace in dis wasteland, but now I have nothing, thanks to those thieving assassins.

Each of us had a satchel dat carried de last of our possessions. We didn't have much, but it was more than one troll would need.

If you search de dunes looking for [[Warguard Rakera|your friend]], could you keep an eye out for our satchels?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Exiled Veteran's Wargreaves
|Lastwind Trousers
|Resilient Outcast's Greaves
|Scorching Sands Breeches
|Lastwind Wristguards

|Exiled Veteran's Armbands
}}

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered our belongings?

==Completion==
<Jorak quickly digs through the satchels.>

Much is missing, but hopefully dere's enough here for a worthy offering.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Grozztok the Blackheart (quest)]] before heading out. Sandfury Assassins are found all over [[Atul'Aman]] to the west.

While in Atul'Aman, you can pick up the side quest [[Ranah's Wrench (quest)]]. After finishing with Atul'Aman, head back to the Withering Gulch, where [[Bladeguard Kaja]] and Jorak are now standing next to [[Meerah's Caravan]]. Completing both Grozztok the Blackheart and Stolen Satchels rewards the "Dangers in the Desert" portion of [[Secrets in the Sands]].
