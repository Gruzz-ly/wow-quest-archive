==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Faithless]] within the [[Feeding Pits (Vol'dun)|Feeding Pits]].
* Faithless slain (8)

==Description==
The [[Faithless]] rely on their [[krolusk]]s for everything. They are mounts, battle companions, beasts of burden, and often even food to fuel the [[sethrak]] empire.

If we can disrupt their krolusks, we'll disrupt their whole empire. One broken wheel stops the caravan, eh?

Take out as many of their krolusk tamers as you can. That'll have a longer impact than just killing the krolusks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Do you need another excuse to kill the Faithless?

==Completion==
The Faithless will be nursing that wound for awhile. Well done.

==Notes==
*Eligible mobs are [[Faithless Beastlord]]s, [[Faithless Deadeye]]s, [[Faithless Suppressor]]s, and [[Faithless Tamer]]s.

==Progression==
{{Storming the Spire}}

==Patch changes==
