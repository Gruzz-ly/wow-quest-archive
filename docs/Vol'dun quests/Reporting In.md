==Objectives==
Report to [[Halford Wyrmbane|High Commander Halford Wyrmbane]].

==Description==
I can't believe what we got ourselves in the middle of here. Keystones, [[C'Thrax]]xi, there's even a [[Sethrak|snake-man]] civil war going on!

All I know is Wyrmbane is going to want a full report and if there's anything I hate more than inept privates getting themselves captured it's paperwork.

Let's get going.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Wyrmbane listens to your report.>

The news of this C'Thraxxi is troubling, but you did well in befriending the local population. This likely won't be the last time we'll have to depend upon them.

Well done, <name>.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''Ermey and James walk downstairs.''
:{{text|say|Sergeant Ermey|Let's get moving!}}
:{{text|say|Private James|Sergeant... thanks for coming after me... sir.}}
:{{text|say|Sergeant Ermey|Private James, didn't your parents give you enough attention as a child? Why are you wasting my time in chasing your butt all over lands unknown?}}
:{{text|say|Private James|Sir, I... I'll do better, sir.}}
:{{text|say|Sergeant Ermey|You better square yourself away, private.}}

Ermey and James make their way to the flight master and hop on [[gryphon]]s back to [[Shatterstone Harbor]]. Follow in their good example to save some time.
