==Objectives==
Find [[Bladeguard Kaja]] and [[Warguard Rakera]] in [[Atul'Aman]].
* Speak with [[Vorrik]]
* Kaja found
* Rakera found

==Description==
[[Sethrak|My people]] have known about [[Abandoned Passage|this ancient passageway]] for generations, but none have dared enter before now.

The tunnel leads to the tomb of [[Mythrax|Mythrax the Unraveler]] and it is said that his power still radiates within the cavern. Who knows what horrors await us inside...

It appears that your friends have already gone inside to face [[General Jakra'zet|Jakra'zet]] and stop him from raising Mythrax from the dead.

We don't have time to waste. We must find Kaja and Rakera before they confront Jakra'zet on their own!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
Jakra'zet has already begun the ritual. We must stop him before it's too late!

==Notes==
Talk to Vorrik:
:We do not have time to waste. Your friends are already inside Atul'Aman...
:{{Gossip|I'm ready. Let's go find the others.}}

Vorrik begins following the player around. Head into the passage...
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|There is a dark presence here. We should be on our guard...}}

...and enter the [[Fetid Crypt]], a large, fungus-filled chamber inhabited by [[Faceless Tendril]]s and [[N'raqi Eradicator]]s.
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|Even in death, Mythrax's essence remains strong here. I fear for what will become of [[Azeroth|our world]] should he rise once more...}}

Kaja is standing in the southwest corner of the crypt, rooted by [[Entangling Tendrils]]. Interact with them to free her.
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|Ungh... my head... what are dese things?}}
:{{Text|say|Bladeguard Kaja|We need to hurry and find Rakera!}}

Kaja runs off through the northern tunnel to the second part of the crypt. Follow her.
:{{Text|say|Vorrik|[[Sethraliss]] gave her own life to save our world. If Mythrax returns, her valiant sacrifice will have been for naught...}}

Rakera is is similarly ensnared in the eastern corner of the Fetid Crypt's second chamber. Upon freeing her:
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|I told Kaja to keep moving. We need to stop Jakra'zet before it's too late.}}
:{{Text|say|Warguard Rakera|We need to catch up with her. Let's go!}}

Rakera heads north, deeper into the pyramid. Follow her to reach the [[Blood Font]], which is divided into a western and eastern chamber. Kaja, Rakera, and Vorrik are standing at the threshold between the two. Off in the eastern chamber, Jakra'zet (unattackable due to a Blood Shield buff) is performing a blood ritual in front of a large triangular pit while a crowd of [[Sandfury Troll]]s observe. Talk to Rakera to turn in.
