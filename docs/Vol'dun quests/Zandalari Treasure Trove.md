==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Zak'rajan the Undying.jpg|Zak'rajan the Undying|The specter of a long-dead [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] ruler, protected by the [[soul]]s he's enslaved.}}
Kill [[Zak'rajan the Undying]] in his throne room.
*Zak'rajan the Undying slain

==Description==
We've looted some quality goods already, but the real reward is still ahead. The big chamber in the back of [[Court of Zak'rajan|the ruins]] is filled with powerful artifacts.

A treasure trove like that is the sort of thing that can save lives and sell for a fortune out here in [[Vol'dun]].

But those [[troll spectre|specters]] you killed weren't lying. Their master or king or whatever is very well-protected in here.

We'll have to take this one down as a group. Let me know when you're ready to head up to the chamber.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Mugabu's Soulwand
|Zak'rajan's Hexmace
|Soulwrenching Shortblade
|Jam'jen's Shortbow
|Trapped Soul Warstaff
|Soulwrenching Claws
|Soul-Cursed Skullcracker
|Soul-Cursed Warglaive
|Soul-Cursed Warmaul
|Trapped Soul Warmace
}}

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|38|80}}
*20,560 [[XP]]
*+150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
With Zak'rajan out of the way, we've got first claim on all the treasure he's been hoarding here!

You get your fair share, of course. A worker's worth his wage.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|[[Tacha]]|I've got everything we need to take out Zak'rajan's barrier. Just show me where he is.}}
:{{Text|say|Omi|I'll lead the way. Stay close.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Kenzou]]|Once Zak'rajan is taken care of, it's free for all looting. Whatever you grab, you keep.}}

The [[vulpera]] trio enter [[Stealth]] and head out northeast toward the ruins, despawning a short distance away. Head to the top of the ruins to find Zak'rajan inside his throne room,{{Coords|47.2|41.6|Vol'dun}} protected by his impenetrable Spirit Shield. As soon as the player enters the building, Kenzou, Omi, and Tacha appear and run inside as well.
:{{Text|say|Tacha|There he is! I'll take care of that pesky spirit shield.}}
:{{Text|say|Tacha|This is why I keep old totems stuffed with angry spirits, <name>...}}

Tacha places a soulcatcher totem on the ground, immediately causing a barrage of spirits to erupt from the totem and assault Zak'rajan's barrier.
:{{Text|yell|Zak'rajan the Undying|Get back in your golems, spirits! You belong to me!}}

The attack quickly causes Zak'rajan's shield to dissipate, opening him up to attack.
:{{Text|say|Tacha|His shield is down. Strike now!}}
:{{Text|say|Zak'rajan the Undying|Filthy scavengers! I rule here!}}

Aid the vulpera in killing Zak'rajan. Upon death:
:{{Text|say|Zak'rajan the Undying|Let me die this time, [[Bwonsamdi]]... Please...}}

The vulpera trio immediately fan out across the room to inspect the artifacts scattered around the building.
:{{Text|say|Kenzou|Good work, team! Grab what you can while you can.}}
:{{Text|say|Tacha|Look at all these artifacts! I need a bigger bag!}}
:{{Text|say|Omi|Whoo! It's lootin' time!}}

After a short time, the vulpera run out of the building back toward the wagon.
:{{Text|say|Kenzou|See you back at the wagon, <name>!}}

Return to the wagon and turn in to Omi. Upon completion:
:{{Text|say|Kenzou|Thanks, <name>. We couldn't have done this without you. Take your share.}}
:{{Text|say|Kenzou|And now, Tacha and Omi... We're going to pick this place clean of anything worth taking.}}
:{{Text|say|Omi|Way ahead of you, Kenzou.}}
