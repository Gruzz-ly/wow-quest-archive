==Objectives==
Collect 7 Scorpashi Stingers in [[Zul'Ahjin]].
* [[Scorpashi Stinger]] (7)

==Description==
Scorposhi{{sic}} venom usually induces a slow, creeping death.

It's remarkable that your friend has survived this long.

As with most antivenoms, the thing that kills is also the thing that heals.

I'll need to extract the venom from several scorpashi stingers to craft the cure.

When the extracted poison is mixed with cactus root salve, we will have the antivenom we need to treat his wounds.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Do you have the scorpashi stingers?

==Completion==
Be gentle with the scorpashi stingers, it will only complicate matters worse if one of us become poisoned. The venom of the scorpashi is highly toxic.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Nature's Remedy]] before leaving. The stingers drop from [[Scorpashi Direclaw]]s and [[Scorpashi Venomtail]]s across Zul'Ahjin.

==Progression==
{{A City of Secrets}}

==Patch changes==
