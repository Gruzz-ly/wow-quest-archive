==Progress==
Have you found de ancient bones?

==Notes==
Pick up [[Powerful Conductors]] and [[Vile Infestation]] before heading out to the [[Redrock Mesa]]. Accepting all three quests prompts:
:{{Text|say|Akunda the Exalted|Gathering de reagents needed for your communion is de first step towards redemption.}}

At this point, [[Jorak]] also offers a new quest in the form of [[Fond Farewells]], requiring a brief trip back to [[Zuldazar]].

Sacred Remains can be found around the Redrock Mesa and [[Redrock Cavern]]. Looting Sacred Remains automatically grants a non-stacking "Sacred Power" buff which increases [[Agility]], [[Intellect]], and [[Strength]] by 10 for 1 minute.
