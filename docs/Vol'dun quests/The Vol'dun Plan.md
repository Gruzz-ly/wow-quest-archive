==Objectives==
Discuss strategy with [[Halford Wyrmbane]] and [[Shandris Feathermoon]].
* Discuss Halford's strategy
* Discuss Shandris's strategy

==Description==
Our target: [[Arlethal Sunwatcher]], High Examiner of the [[Reliquary]].

Before we charge off blindly into the dunes, however, I'd like to hold a quick strategy meeting with you and the others.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let's talk strategy, <name>.

==Completion==
I admire Shandris's... directness.

We will proceed with both plans. Let's move.

==Notes==
Wyrmbane:
{{Dialogue|
The 7th Legion represents the best that Azeroth has to offer.

For the Alliance!

{{gossip|What's your plan, High Commander?}}

:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Sunwatcher is, as a member of the Reliquary, here on an archaeological mission.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Archaeology?}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Yes. Our intel suggests at least three excavations.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|I'd like to execute a synchronized incendiary attack on all of their excavation sites.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|You want to... set off a bunch of bombs at once.}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|Affirmative! Consequently, I've enlisted a crack team of commandos with the technical expertise to do so.}}
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Hey hey!}}
:{{text|say|Halford Wyrmbane|The Gnomeregan Covert Ops team will plant bombs to draw out Sunwatcher, and then we will assault him in the confusion.}}

Shandris:
{{Dialogue|
<Shandris's keen eyes scan the horizon. She nods at you in acknowledgement.>

{{gossip|What is your strategy, Shandris?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|My strategy?}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|Find Sunwatcher, then fill him with arrows.}}
