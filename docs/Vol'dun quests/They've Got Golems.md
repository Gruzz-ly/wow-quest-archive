==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Malfunctioning Golem.jpg|Malfunctioning Golem|Powerful golems guard the Court of Zak'rajan.}}
Find a [[Malfunctioning Golem]] and discover its power source.
*Golem power source revealed

==Description==
I've sacked countless ruins across [[Vol'dun]]. Everything from [[saurolisk]]-infested dens to the cursed [[Port of Zem'lan]].

I don't say this to brag. I want you to understand that I know what I'm doing.

I've survived this long because I take my time, avoid risks, and only take what I need.

That's that we'll be doing here today.

[[Omi]] reported heavy [[Zandalari golem|golem]] activity on her first scouting trip into [[Court of Zak'rajan|the ruins]]. [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] golems are formidable. We need to learn what's powering them before we head in.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Golem Socket Band
|Vindictive Golem Core
}}

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|38|80}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
Did you discover the golems' power source?

==Completion==
The golems are powered by souls? Hmm...

We're dealing with a very powerful enemy. We should take extra precautions.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Inconvenient Spirits]] and [[Ranishu Are Resources]] before heading out. The Malfunctioning Golem is found in the eastern part of the [[Bone Pit]],{{Coords|46.8|50.4|Vol'dun}} running erratically around a shallow pool of water. Upon killing it, a group of [[Released Spirit]]s emerge from the construct and, shortly after, fade from view.
