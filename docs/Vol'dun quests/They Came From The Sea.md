==Objectives==
Question 8 [[Naga]] [[Ghost|Spirits]].
*Spirits interrogated (8)
*[[Soulcaller Scroll]] (provided)

==Description==
You are free to rest your weary legs in our camp, but I'm afraid we have little more to offer you.

Naga have driven us from our village by the sea. We can no longer fish or hunt crabs. I fear we may not survive long if we cannot take back our lagoon.

But taking back the lagoon will not be enough. We must find out why the naga attacked us. What is it they are looking for?

Take this ancient scroll and use it to summon the spirits of the naga.

They will only speak truth while under its spell.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
What have you discovered?

==Completion==
Thanks to your efforts, [[Darkwood Shoal]] is much safer now. Still, I fear that the naga will return in force to search for this [[:Ring of Tides]].

We must find a more permanent solution to this problem...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Hidden Motives]] and [[Crab Trapping]] before heading out. Kill [[Stormcoil]] naga in Darkwood Shoal and use the [[Soulcaller Scroll]] on their corpses to conjure a spirit version that says one of the following before disappearing:
*{{Text|say|None shall stand in the way of our Queen!}}
*{{Text|say|[[Queen Azshara]] demands the Ring of Tides!}}
*{{Text|say|The Ring of Tides is our birthright!}}
*{{Text|say|The Ring of Tides shall be ours! Queen Azshara demands it!}}
*{{Text|say|The Ring of Tides was lost nearby. The queen must have it back!}}
*{{Text|say|The ring will be ours!}}
*{{Text|say|We will not stop until the ring is ours!}}
*{{Text|say|Where is the Ring of Tides? Do not hide it from us!}}

Note that the Scroll cannot be used on [[Overseer Zarjish]], [[Songstress Nahjeen]], or [[Stormcoil Berserker]]s.

==Progression==
{{Tortaka Refuge}}
