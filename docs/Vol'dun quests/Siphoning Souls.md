==Objectives==
Kill 5 [[Soul-Trapped Guardian]]s and use the Soulcatcher Totem to siphon their souls from their corpse.
*Golem souls siphoned (5)
*[[Salvaged Soulcatcher Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
<Tacha rummages through her sack of scavenged supplies.>

So these [[Zandalari golem|golems]] are powered by [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] [[soul]]s?

No problem... I've had to deal with that before... I've got just the tool for it.

<Tacha pulls out an eerie Zandalari totem.>

Here it is! Found this ol' soulcatcher totem in one of the southern ruins years ago. It's gotten us out of a few jams.

Disable the golems and throw down this totem next to it. It'll siphon off the souls.

Keep the totem. We'll need it later.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|38|80}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Progress==
If you're standing here, I assume it worked.

==Completion==
See? I told you that the soulcatcher totem would make it easy. A tool for every problem, I say.

==Notes==
Pick up [[An Army's Arsenal]] and [[The Strongest Rope in Vol'dun]] before heading into the court. Kill [[Soul-Trapped Guardian]]s around the ruins, then place the Salvaged Soulcatcher Totem on the ground to give the guardians the [https://www.wowhead.com/spell=256665/ Soulless Husk] debuff and get quest credit. Killing a guardian will also cause a [[Released Spirit]] to emerge from it.

After siphoning five, turn in to Tacha back at the wagon west of the ruins.

==Progression==
{{Court of Zak'rajan}}
