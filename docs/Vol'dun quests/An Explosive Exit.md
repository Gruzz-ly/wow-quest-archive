==Progress==
Let's get out of here while we still can.

==Completion==
This is the [[Zandalari troll|troll]] you flew in with, is it not? She lives, for now.

==Notes==
Head a short distance southwest to find [[Nisha's Wagon]] and the two accompanying [[Alpaca (NPC)|Alpacas]].
:{{Text|say|Nisha|Right where I left it!}}

Interact with the wagon to board it. Nisha appears in the driver's seat while the player is in the back seat.
:{{Text|say|Nisha|Hang on! This is gonna be a wild ride!}}

The player is granted an extra action button:
:{{Abilities|Volatile Potion|id=268494|Blasts the target with volatile liquid, dealing fire damage.|icon=inv_potion_33}}

As the wagon sets out away from the [[Abandoned Burrows]] and across the [[Brine Basin]], hordes of [[Sethrak Ambusher]]s appear and begin rushing after the wagon. Throw Volatile Potions at them to kill them and prevent them from reaching the wagon.
:{{Text|say|Nisha|Looks like we have company. Light 'em up, <name>!}}

After successfully defending the wagon:
:{{Text|say|Nisha|Looks like we're in the clear. Great work back there.}}
:{{Text|say|Nisha|The hideaway should be up ahead. We'll be safe there. For a while, at least.}}

Before long, the wagon reaches the Vulpera Hideaway, where a wounded [[Bladeguard Kaja]] is lying on a carpet next to [[Kiro]] and [[Meerah]].

:{{Text|say|Kiro|Nisha, thank the sands you're safe!}}
:''Nisha jumps off the wagon and walks over to Kiro.''
:{{Text|say|Nisha|I always find a way. Is this another survivor?}}
:{{Text|say|Kiro|She may not survive for long. Her wounds are severe.}}

Completing this quest rewards the "Unlikely Allies" portion of [[Secrets in the Sands]].
