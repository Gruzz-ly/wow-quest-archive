==Objectives==
Rescue 3 captive excavators.
* [[Ahjani Excavator|Excavator]] freed (3)

==Description==
On top of the fury of [[Overseer Nerzet|the overseer]], and this "key" not being here, we have a pest problem.

Sneaky little [[vulpera]]n thieves keep ransacking our site. We have taken some prisoner.

We have them working around the upper level of the dig site, working off their misdeeds. However, I believe a more permanent solution would be preferred.

Please, oh mighty [[serpent|cobra]], give us the honor of getting rid of our prisoners with your most potent venom!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Voldunai]]

==Completion==
Well played on the rescue. I can't decide if you're clever, or they're stupid. I like your odds, though!

==Notes==
Picking up this quest requires you to be in the form of an Avatar of the Desert by interacting with the [[Scepter of Prescience]], since Jethek is normally hostile to players.

Captive Ahjani Excavators are found across the southeastern parts of Zul'Ahjin. On approach, they may say:
* {{Text|say|Ahjani Excavator|Ack!}}
* {{Text|say|Ahjani Excavator|Eek!}}

Interact with their shackles to break them open with the Avatar's cobra spit. After being freed, the Excavators go into [[Stealth]] and run off.
* {{Text|say|Ahjani Excavator|I'm going to make sure the sethrak don't even have their own loot when they leave here.}}
* {{Text|say|Ahjani Excavator|That's it, I'm taking twice as much now.}}

Return to Amre to turn in the quest.

==Progression==
{{A City of Secrets}}
