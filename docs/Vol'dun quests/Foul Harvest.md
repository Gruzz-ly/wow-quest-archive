==Objectives==
Collect 12 Digested Akunda's Bite Seeds.
*[[Digested Akunda's Bite Seed]] (12)

==Description==
You have traveled far to find knowledge, but you have found me instead. I am curious though, how much further you would travel for it. I will teach you, if you do something for me first.

Iron sharpens iron, as they say, so too does adversity strengthen the seed.

Go out and find seeds, ones that have been consumed by the wild beasts and have returned to the earth unscathed.

Only those seeds will be strong enough to survive the desert sands of [[Vol'dun]].

==Progress==
Were you able to get the seeds?

==Completion==
Hmmm... This seems like a good harvest. There is a quiet dignity in their resilience.

But dignity is not enough. They must be more than quiet, they must quake with thunder.

==Progression==
{{An Unusual Mentor}}
