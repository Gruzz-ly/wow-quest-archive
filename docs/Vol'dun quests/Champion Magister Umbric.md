I was skeptical when [[Halford Wyrmbane|High Commander Wyrmbane]] asked me to accompany him to this [[Vol'dun|vast desert]]. I did not believe there would be much of interest here.

My assumptions, pleasantly, were unfounded. The [[sethrak]] who populate this region command powerful [[magic]] and wield it with unconventional techniques.

I'm eager to study their accouterments to further unlock their power, but my first priority is to aid you and the High Commander in whatever task you have need of me.

Please, do not hesitate to call on me.

I swear, sometimes I don't know how I end up in these situations!

Firstly, there is nothing of interest to me here. Secondly, the heat is absolutely sweltering. I would have understood if I was requested to study the stone that the sethrak held... but alas.

Would you take me out of here and let me get back to doing work of actual import?
