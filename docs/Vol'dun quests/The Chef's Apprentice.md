==Objectives==
Locate [[Junji]].

==Description==
<Sezahjin rummages through his cooking ingredients in frustration.>

Where is Junji? I sent him to scavenge for [[vulture]] eggs, but he hasn't returned.

<Sezahjin pauses for a moment.>

He was just going on about de size of [[saurolisk]] eggs, but those oversized lizards are far too dangerous for a boy! He can't possibly be so foolish...

If he has gone to de saurolisk breeding grounds... he may already be dead. Please find him before it's too late!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|1|94}}
*1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You can't fool me, saurolisk! I know you're out dere waiting to eat me! Oh wait... you're a grown up! Please, get me out of here! Help!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Sezahjin|Junji be always getting himself up to no good. It'll be bad news for him if de lizards find him before you do!}}

Head due south and enter the chamber at {{Coords|43.4|79.2|Vol'dun}} to find Junji hiding in a large basket from the nearby [[Scaleclaw Saurolisk]]s.
