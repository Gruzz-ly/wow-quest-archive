==Description==
<As you near the statue, a somber voice fills your mind.>

"You must resist the shadow's pull. Come to me, brothers and sisters. Be whole within the [[Light]].

Let Arkhaan show you the way home."

<The rest of the message is garbled, though the nearby Broken seem to be gnawing on pieces of the statue.>

You will also receive: {{cost|4|85|}}

==Progress==
Did you find anything interesting?

==Completion==
