==Objectives==
Secure the missing key fragments from the [[ethereal]]s around the [[Seat of the Triumvirate]].

* [[Armory Key Fragment]] (10)

==Description==
The fragment you found is only one part of the key. I fear the other pieces have fallen into the hands of these ethereal beings you speak of... the [[Shadowguard]].

We must recover them all. The Shadowguard leaders and lieutenants in and around the Seat of the Triumvirate may well have the fragments in their possession.

Get those key fragments, <name>... any way you have to.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|19|40|}}
|Emblazoned Shadowguard Insignia
}}

==Progress==
Did you find all the fragments?

==Completion==
Nice work, <class title>. Those ethereals stood no chance against you.

Now that we have the fragments, I can prepare them for reforging.

==Gains==
* +250 reputation with [[Argussian Reach]]
