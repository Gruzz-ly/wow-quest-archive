==Objectives==
* Participate in a Jed'hin Match

==Description==
:{{Text|say|[[Grand Artificer Romuul]]|So many draenei traditions were lost during our long journey. The spirits of Eredath have not forgotten. They practice the ritual combat of Jed'hin even now. Perhaps they will welcome a new challenger!}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Completion==
:{{Text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|It brings me great joy to see the old ways honored like this. Thank you.}}

==Notes==
The world quest occurs at the [[Circle of Aspirants]]. Interact with one of the friendly [[Jed'hin Novice]]s (in the eastern circle), [[Jed'hin Adept]]s (in the western circle), or [[Jed'hin Master]]s (in the central circle) to control him as a vehicle and enter a match. The Jed'hin Masters (which can be controlled at any time) are for PvP matches and need to both be controlled by players in order to start a match, whereas the Novices and Adepts (which can only be controlled during this world quest) allow the player to fight an opposing NPC. All three play identically with the following vehicle abilities:

#{{Abilities|Shove|id=253675|Shoves the target, dealing X damage. Generates 10 energy.|icon=spell_nature_strength}}
#{{Abilities|Grapple|id=249274|Deals X damage and increases damage dealt by your next Grapple by 150%.|icon=spell_nature_shamanrage}}
#{{Abilities|Block|id=249278|Blocks all incoming damage and generates 8 energy per second. Channeled.|icon=ability_warrior_defensivestance}}
#{{Abilities|Counter|id=249279|Counter the target's movements, interrupting Block and placing it on a 10 second cooldown. Only usable on targets who are Blocking.|icon=ability_warstomp}}
#{{Abilities|Start Match|id=249862|Start the match!|icon=ability_warrior_battleshout}}

Use Start Match to begin. As soon as either combatant reaches 1% health, the match ends, with both eredar bowing and the player automatically getting ejected from the one they control. The quest only requires ''participating'', not winning, so losing a match will still complete the quest.
