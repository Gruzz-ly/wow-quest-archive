==Completion==
:{{Text|say|Archmage Y'mera|I will not waste this opportunity to learn from my former peers. Thank you for your help.}}

==Notes==
;Talk to Y'mera at the [[Conservatory of the Arcane]]
: Thank you for coming. I have my suspicions about these spirits here, but I will need some of their essence to learn the truth.

: Take this attuning crystal and use it near any spirits that seem more solid than others.

: Be careful, though-- they may become angered by the attuning.

{{Gossip|<Take the Attuning Crystal.>}}

Use [[Y'mera's Attuning Crystal]] on [[Resonating Augari Novitiate]]s and [[Resonating Augari Summoner]]s.
