==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Nhal'athoth.jpg|Nhal'athoth|Though only a demi-god, Nhal'athoth's presence haunts the dark corners of Eredath.}}
Defeat Nhal'athoth and collect his heart.

* Enter the [[Void Tear]]
* Defeat [[Nhal'athoth]]
* [[Heart of Nhal'athoth]]

==Description==
After some consideration, I have decided to allow [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] another opportunity to pursue her destiny.

I suppose you want to know what that means, mortal.

<[[Locus-Walker]] laughs.>

Meet us deep in the Shadowguard camp ahead. My brethren are preparing a summons that will provide adequate energy for Windrunner to begin again.

Witness what happens when you harness the [[Void]]'s power.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
* [[Discarded Remnant of the Void]]
* {{cost|19|40}}
* 150 [[Veiled Argunite]]

==Progress==
I see the path clearly, <name>.

==Completion==
<Alleria takes the heart in her hands.>

This is the next step, <name>. Thank you for bringing me to this point.
