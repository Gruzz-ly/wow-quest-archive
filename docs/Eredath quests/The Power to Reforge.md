==Objectives==
Obtain a stockpile of Dendrite Clusters.

* [[Dendrite Cluster]] (15)

==Description==
I forged the key using a pristine [[argunite]] crystal. Unfortunately, the only ones remaining are used by the [[Army of the Light]]'s defenses.

Hmm... dendrite clusters might be an alternative. They were used by the elite of [[Eredath]] to power simple devices. If enough of the city ruins are still intact, I'd wager the fallen magi or the [[broken]] may still have some in their possession.

Of course, I would need a great many clusters to reforge the key. It seems you have your work cut out for you.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|19|40|}}
|Dendrite Flux
}}

==Progress==
Were you able to find enough clusters?

==Completion==
Ah, yes. Combined, these clusters should provide just enough power for me to fuse the key fragments back together.

==Gains==
* +250 reputation with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Progression==
