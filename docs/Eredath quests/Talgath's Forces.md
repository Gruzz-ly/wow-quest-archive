==Objectives==
Slay 12 of [[Talgath]]'s forces.
* Talgath's forces slain (12)

==Description==
I must continue to seek the [[:Crest of Knowledge]], my friend. Nothing short of the whole [[:Crown of the Triumvirate]] can turn the tide in the battle we face.

Talgath's forces stand between us and that goal. I will need you to clear a path.

We can let nothing stand in our way. Not even Talgath.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Progress==
We cannot know peace while Talgath hunts us.

==Completion==
<Velen does not seem to notice your presence.>

==Notes==
On accept of both "[[Flanking Maneuvers]]" and "Talgath's Forces":
:{{text|say|[[High Exarch Turalyon]]|We will escort Velen safely to the Crest.}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|If you cover our retreat, we may just see this through.}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|Lead the way, Prophet.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Make haste, my friends. Something dark and terrible stirs... and it is not Talgath.}}
:''Turalyon, Velen, and the Army lieutenants head out.''

;First demon kill
:{{text|yell|Talgath|Yes! They flee to the [[Kil'jaeden's Terrace|Terrace]]! We have them right where we want them!}}

;Destroy all portals
:{{text|yell|Talgath|Your screams will echo through [[Antorus, the Burning Throne|Antorus]] if they escape!}}

{{War of Light and Shadow}}
