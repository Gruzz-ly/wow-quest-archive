==Objectives==
Witness [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]]'s memories in [[Eredath]].
* Memories observed (3)
* Memories confronted (3)

==Description==
These apparitions before us. I believe they're... memories. My memories. Is this [[Xal'atath|the Harbinger]]'s doing? Or mine?

We need to explore. Discover why we were led here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Suddenly, this all feels rather personal. The Harbinger must have a grievance against me. Or at least an... interest. Hm.

==Completion==
We're finding the Harbinger and leaving this place. Now.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Why show me these memories? What is the Harbinger's plan?}}

Alleria has new gossip:

{{gossip|Can you tell more about Eredath?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Once, Eredath was the capital of [[Argus]] and home to the [[eredar]]. But it fell to the [[Burning Legion]], and was twisted by their demonic magic into something... profane.

It was on Argus that we finally defeated the Legion. A hard won battle with many sacrifices...

{{Gossip|Tell me about something else.}}
}}}}

Six spots light up. [[Eradication (eredar)|Eradication]] is with a [[Legion Hound (Eredath)|Legion Hound]] and [[Legion Felguard (Eredath)|Legion Felguard]]:
:{{text|say|Eradication|I will have your souls as baubles around my neck!}}

A vision of [[Arator]] {{title|Son of Alleria}} as a child is standing before Alleria's statue in Stormwind and [[Xe'ra]]. Use the Witness Memory extra action button:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|This is the last time I saw my son as a boy. My Arator. I was so thankful for that day.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Xe'ra helped me to reach out to him. Yet the Light's power wasn't enough to defeat the Legion.}}

A group of [[Amani Berserker (Eredath)|Amani Berserkers]], [[Amani Shadowspeaker]]s, and [[Amani Cavalry]] are just north:
:{{text|say|Amani Cavalry|Silvermoon must fall! This land belongs to the Amani!}}

In the center, a vision of Alleria, [[Vereesa Windrunner|Vereesa]], [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]], [[Lirath Windrunner|Lirath]], and their [[Lireesa Windrunner|mother]] and [[Verath Windrunner|father]]. Use the extra action button again:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Rejecting the role of Ranger-General was not an easy choice. For me or my family.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Yet leaving them behind... I failed to protect them. Or at least, to die with them.}}

Northeast are some Fists of Doomhammer standing over the burning corpses of [[Sunreaver Lieutenant (Eredath)|Sunreaver Lieutenants]], a memory of the Second War:
:{{text|say|[[Fist of Doomhammer]]|For the Horde!}}
:{{text|say|Fist of Doomhammer|We will burn Quel'Thalas to the ground!}}

Southeast are a vision of Alleria and [[L'ura]], corrupted by the [[void]]:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Embracing the Void... I don't regret that choice.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I left my world, my son, to protect them. And leaving the Army of the Light was just the same.}}

==Trivia==
Xe'ra uses her patch 7.2.0 naaru model rather than her unique model from 7.3.
