==Objectives==
Activate the [[Vindicaar Beacon]].
* Vindicaar Beacon

==Description==
Hail, friend!

[[Captain Fareeya]] sent us ahead to secure this area. We were just about to call down a beacon and report back to the [[Vindicaar]].

We would be honored if you would help us complete our mission.

The signal beacon just needs a light touch. The Grand Artificer will do the rest.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[Lightforged Beacon: City Center]]

You will also receive: {{cost|4|85|}}

==Progress==
[[Grand Artificer Romuul]] is a reliable soul. We would be lost on this planet without him.

==Completion==
The beacon will be added to the [[Navigation Console]].

A contingent of the [[Army of the Light]] will remain to hold this location for future use.

==Notes==
While you can go out of your way to do this after completing [[The Path Forward]], the teleport point will be automatically learned anyway after turning in [[The Sigil of Awakening]].

==Progression==
