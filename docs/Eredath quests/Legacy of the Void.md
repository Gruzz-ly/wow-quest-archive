==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Triad's Conservatory]] in [[Eredath]].
* Use the [[Void Portal to Eredath|void portal to Eredath]]

==Description==
Make no mistake, <name>. I know this is a trap. But if there's any chance this leads us to the Harbinger, we must take that risk.

Be at the ready. We venture forth.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|80|90}}
* 5x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
The Harbinger calls. And we must answer.

==Completion==
Eredath. I never thought I would return here. Not after the Legion was finally defeated. Not after....

Why would the Harbinger bring us here?

==Notes==
Take the Void Portal to Eredath to drop off at the [[Triad's Conservatory]], just inside the instance line to the [[Seat of the Triumvirate (instance)|Seat of the Triumvirate]] dungeon. The [[Translocator]] can be used to enter and exit the area if necessary. Approach Alleria:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|This is... Eredath.}}
