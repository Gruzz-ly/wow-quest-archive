==Objectives==
Stabilize 8 [[Erratic Power Conduit]]s.
*Power Conduits stabilized (8)
*[[Y'mera's Arcanocrystal]] (provided)

==Description==
I have an idea. This construct will be of use to us. We simply need to jolt it awake.

We once stored great quantities of energy in conduits throughout the [[Conservatory of the Arcane|Conservatory]]. They are still functional, but only just.

Take this.

<Y'mera hands you a brightly glowing crystal.>

It will provide a small burst of magic that should help stabilize an erratic conduit. I think I have enough stored for eight or so.

Stabilizing a few should allow us to access the whole network.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]
*[[Partially Charged Conduit]]

==Progress==
Did it work? I am curious if that crystal holds enough power to accomplish our goals.

==Completion==
Yes, excellent. The conduits are back online.

The construct however is proving a little more difficult to awaken than I had hoped.

==Notes==
On approach after dealing with the erratic power conduits. The vigilant is now surrounded by pulsing crystals but is still unpowered:
