==Objectives==
Slay 15 Shadowguard Ethereals.

* Shadowguard ethereals slain (15)

==Description==
As you have surely gathered by now, a certain subset of [[ethereal|my people]] have tragically succumbed to the call of the [[Void]].

I had hoped to find more who possess the necessary strength of mind. I am disappointed to find such an utter lack of resistance.

It cannot be helped. To advance your cause, and mine, we will need to eradicate these weak-willed beings. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|14|60|va=100}}

==Progress==
Walking the razor's edge does have risks, <name>.

==Completion==
It is good to know we can share a common goal. Perhaps I will find some use for your kind yet.

==Progression==
{{War of Light and Shadow}}
