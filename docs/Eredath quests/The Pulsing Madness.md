==Objectives==
Dispel 5 Void Manifestations.

* [[Void Manifestation]]s cleansed (5)
* [[Hallowed Prayer Effigy]] (provided)

==Description==
This [[Broken]] still retains some of his sanity, though not all of it.

I can sense some [[Void]] influence nearby, but it is isolated to small pockets. Dispelling these manifestations should help our friend here clear his mind.

Perhaps we can use the prayer fragments you found, as they still contain some [[Light]] energy.

I will try and make sense of his chattering in the meantime. Maybe we can learn something about what is happening here. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|9|70|va=50}}
|Sanctified Prayer Effigy
}}

==Progress==
His presence raises more questions than it answers.

==Completion==
I can feel the Void's influence retreating. Perhaps now we can find out what happened here.
