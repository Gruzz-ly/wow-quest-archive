==Objectives==
Meet [[Archmage Y'mera]] at the [[Conservatory of the Arcane]].

==Description==
Now we may begin our search for the [[Crown of the Triumvirate]]. We will start with the fragment [[Archimonde]] carried: the [[:Sigil of Awakening]].

To the east and north you will find all that remains of the greatest school of magic on [[Argus]]. It was there that Archimonde gained his mastery of the [[arcane]]. I can think of no other place he would stow his treasures.

It will be guarded, no doubt. We will leverage the expertise of [[Captain Fareeya|Fareeya]]'s forces here to follow this trail.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|85|}}
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Completion==
This place has its share of secrets. Thankfully, I know enough of them to get us started.

==Notes==
Archmage Y'mera is located northeast from [[Triumvirate's End]].
