*[[Household Vigilant]] activated (3)

==Description==
:{{text|say|[[Prophet Velen]]|The [[Burning Legion|Legion's]] forces occupy the estates of [[Eredath]]. Activate the nobles' [[vigilant]]s to help with the battle. No doubt their power crystals have been stolen by the [[eredar]].}}

==Completion==
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|The activated constructs will serve as an excellent distraction. My thanks!}}

==Notes==
The {{item|Vigilant Power Crystal|s}} needed drop from practically any mob in the quest zone, and not just eredar. Once activated, a version of the vigilant will spawn as a temporary combat pet for a short while.
