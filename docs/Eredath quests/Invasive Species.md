==Objectives==
Collect 30 Partially Digested Arcana.
*[[Partially Digested Arcana]] (30)

==Description==
We should seek out an alternate source of energy just in case I am wrong about the conduits.

Luckily enough, I think I know where we can find one.

The [[panthara]] native to [[Argus]] are solitary creatures, but it seems whatever magic the [[Wakeners]] possessed has drawn them here in great numbers.

This is no time to be gentle with the environment- panthara devour energy to survive.

Slay them and see if you cannot reclaim some of the power they have consumed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Progress==
There is always room for a backup plan. Did you find what we seek?

==Completion==
I had not imagined the final product to be so... sticky.

<[[Archmage Y'mera|Y'mera]] wipes her hands on her robes.>

It will do.

==Progression==
{{A Floating Ruin}}
