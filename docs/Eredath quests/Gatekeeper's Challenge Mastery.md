==Objectives==
Defeat Grand Vizier Jarasum, Arc-Consul Velara, and High Wakener Aargon.
*[[Grand Vizier Jarasum]] defeated
*[[Arc-Consul Velara]] defeated
*[[High Wakener Aargon]] defeated

==Description==
[[Archimonde]] was an individual consumed by the pursuit of power. Only those who could match his lust would fare well under his tutelage.

You will fight what remains of Archimonde's greatest pupils. These three once held such power in their own disciplines that the [[Conservatory of the Arcane|Conservatory]] remembers them now.

Their echoes will try to kill you.

Best all three with all your limbs intact and I will recognize your strength.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Progress==
Not afraid of a little magic, are you?

==Completion==
I must admit, I am impressed.

:{{text|say|[[Vigilant Quoram]]|You, Y'mera, will have no part in this. But I will not deny you the opportunity to watch <name> fail.}}
: ''Y'mera sasses him back.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Y'mera|So generous of you.}}
:{{text|whisper|Archmage Y'mera|I may not be able to assist you directly, but I have information that could be of interest.}}

Speak with Y'mera:
{{dialogue|
I know who you will be fighting.

[[Archimonde]] gave them each a title to acknowledge their substantial knowledge of their craft.

Sadly, all of them sided with the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]. This is a rare opportunity to see them as they once were.

{{gossip|Tell me about [[Grand Vizier Jarasum]].}}
{{dialogue-child|
Ah, the Grand Vizier.

He acted as the Arc-Consul's second and oversaw much of the day to day operations in the [[Conservatory of the Arcane|Conservatory]].

When discipline was needed, it was often his voice that would ring out. He was not well liked, but he was respected nonetheless.

It is my understanding that he changed his name to [[Lord Jaraxxus|Jaraxxus]] when he took the Legion's [[fel]] magics for his own.

Beyond that, I know nothing of his fate.

{{gossip|Tell me about [[Arc-Consul Velara]].}}
{{dialogue-child|
Arc-Consul Velara answered only to Archimonde himself.

She was a focused and quiet individual, as I recall. Parallel to the [[Wakeners|Wakener's guild]], she led the [[Consulate]] in the pursuit of the powers of creation.

Under her tutelage we vastly expanded our ability to summon creatures of the [[arcane]]. The familiars that linger here still bear marks of her expertise. She was also largely responsible for cultivating the shield technology that we use even now.

She took the name [[Arch Magus Velysra|Velysra]] and the title of Archmage when she joined the Legion.

I hope you shall never meet her, <name>.

{{gossip|Tell me about [[High Wakener Aargon]].}}
{{dialogue-child|
High Wakener Aargon. Where to start?

He ascended to his position only after his predecessor [[Thal'kiel]] was banished. That is a story for another time, if you are not familiar with it. 

Needless to say he was... an opportunist.

Under his influence we delved deeply into the mysteries of soulbinding. The [[Vigilant|constructs]] that roam these streets are his doing. They represent but a fraction of what the Wakeners could do.

Under the Legion he became [[Aargoss]].

To the [[Army of the Light]] he was known as the Soulcleaver. Where [[soul engine]]s operated, Aargoss was never far away.

;Grand Vizier Jarasum
{{dialogue|
Speak, stranger.

{{gossip|I challenge you to a duel.}}
}}

:{{text|say|Grand Vizier Jarasum|You face Jarasum, Grand Vizier of the Conservatory!}}
:{{text|say|Grand Vizier Jarasum|Your arrogance will be your undoing.}}
:{{text|say|Grand Vizier Jarasum|I am unimpressed.}}
:{{text|say|Grand Vizier Jarasum|Hmph. It is finished then.}}
:''Jarasum bows.''

;Arc-Consul Velara
{{dialogue|
<Velara looks over you impassively.>

Yes?

{{gossip|I challenge you to a duel.}}
}}

:{{text|say|Arc-Consul Velara|I will not restrain myself.}}
:{{text|say|Arc-Consul Velara|Bear in mind that your performance reflects upon all of us.}}
:{{text|say|Arc-Consul Velara|You could stand to do better.}}
:{{text|say|Arc-Consul Velara|Enough. You have proven your worth.}}
:''Velara bows.''

;High Wakener Aargon
{{dialogue|
You will bow when addressing the High Wakener.

{{gossip|I challenge you to a duel.}}
}}

:{{text|say|High Wakener Aargon|A fool's errand, but I will indulge you.}}
:{{text|say|High Wakener Aargon|Your efforts thus far are... lacking.}}
:{{text|say|High Wakener Aargon|Continue like this and you may well scrape by.}}
:{{text|say|High Wakener Aargon|I suppose that qualifies as a victory.}}
:''Aargon bows.''
