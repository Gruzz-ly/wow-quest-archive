==Objectives==
Call down a [[Lightforged beacon|Lightforged Beacon]].
*Call Down a Lightforged Beacon

==Description==
<[[Velen]] stares beyond the arena for a time.>

We must continue on, but I feel [[Eredath]] is far from finished with us. We should take advantage of this relative safety while we still can.

I will place a signal beacon that will allow the [[Vindicaar]] to lock onto our location. [[Grand Artificer Romuul|Romuul]] will send us our means of returning to the Vindicaar if there is a need.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[Lightforged Beacon: Triumvirate's End]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Progress==
Much remains to be seen, <name>. [[Argus]] has not forgotten us.

==Completion==
The way forward is clear, and we have the [[Army of the Light]] at our side.
