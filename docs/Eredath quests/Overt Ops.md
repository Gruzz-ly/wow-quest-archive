==Objectives==
Locate [[Baraat the Longshot]], [[Grand Vindicator Sorvos]], and [[Blademaster Telaamon]].
*Orders given to Baraat
*Orders given to Sorvos
*Orders given to Telaamon

==Description==
My soldiers are out there, <name>.

I need you to find Baraat, Sorvos, and Telaamon. They were in the process of securing this area for [[Prophet Velen|Velen]] when the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] came down on top of our heads.

Inform them that their orders are to regroup with the Prophet at once.

The time for subtlety has passed. There is a small army between us and them. Do what you must.

[[Light]] keep you safe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
What is it?

==Completion==
[[Captain Fareeya|Fareeya]]'s forces are the best the [[Army of the Light]] has to offer. Our mission is that much more likely to succeed with them at our side.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Non-Prophet Organization]] and [[Wrath of the High Exarch]] from [[High Exarch Turalyon]] before heading out.

Speak to Baraat:
{{Dialogue|
I was looking for higher ground to scout a path for Velen when the Legion descended upon us.

I covered his retreat but I was separated from the others.

Do you bring news?
