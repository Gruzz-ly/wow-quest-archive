==Objectives==
Meet [[Turalyon]] at the [[Conservatory of the Arcane]].
* Travel to the Conservatory of the Arcane

==Description==
We have a problem, <name>. The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] has come to [[Eredath]].

When you claimed the [[Sigil of Awakening|Sigil]] it was as if we announced our presence to all of [[Argus]]. The eyes of [[Antorus, the Burning Throne|Antorus]] are firmly upon us.

Just wait. It gets worse.

[[Velen]] took [[Captain Fareeya]] and her forces into the [[Arinor Gardens]] area to search for the [[:Crest of Knowledge]]. To my knowledge, they are all now behind enemy lines.

Come with me to the Conservatory. We need to bring Velen and the others back before it is too late.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|85|}}

== Progress ==
Stay focused. We cannot fail now.

==Completion==
There is no room for error here, <name>.

==Notes==
Interact with the [[Navigation Console]] and teleport to the [[Lightforged beacon]] at the Conservatory.
