==Objectives==
Wake the Gatekeeper.
* Wake the [[Deactivated Conservatory Vigilant|Gatekeeper]]
* Speak to [[Vigilant Quoram]]

==Description==
It was a good thing we sought two sources of energy. Even with the conduits active, the construct has not stirred.

It has likely been inactive a long while. Perhaps as long as [[Eredath]] has floated above [[Argus]].

What a long, lonely vigil it must have been.

<Y'mera is silent for a moment as she peers at the construct.>

Go ahead and jostle it a little. That combined with one last burst of magic ought to do the trick.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Completion==
Prepare yourself, stranger.

: ''Y'mera nearly groans; this is not someone she would have preferred to be dealing with.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Y'mera|Oh no... I know that voice.}}
: ''If he still had a nose, Quoram would be looking down it at Y'mera in disapproval with a raised eyebrow. He speaks in a "naturally, I am better than you" tone.''

:{{text|say|Archmage Y'mera|We need to--}}
:{{text|say|Vigilant Quoram|[[Conservatory of the Arcane|Conservatory]] resources are not ''available'' to one of your... status.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Y'mera|Of all people to become Gatekeeper... <name>, perhaps you had better do the talking.}}

;Vigilant Quoram
:State your purpose or remove yourself from the premises.

''{{gossip|I seek the [[:Sigil of Awakening]].}}''

::{{text|say|Vigilant Quoram|The Sigil is the Conservatory's highest honor. Only [[Archimonde]]'s chosen may pursue this accolade.}}
