==Objectives==
Disrupt the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] forces in [[Arinor Gardens]].

==Description==
Where the Legion is concerned, violence is always the answer.

<[[Turalyon]] hefts his [[Great Royal Sword|blade]] with a grim expression.>

They are between us and [[Prophet Velen|Velen]]. Nothing will stop them from finding him unless we act. Now is not the time to hold back.

Together we will sow chaos among their ranks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
There can be no other way to deal with the Legion.

==Completion==
If I have learned anything about the Legion, it is that we have no other option but to fight back.

It was a pleasure to have you at my side.

==Notes==
*Turalyon will join your side after you have picked up both [[A Non-Prophet Organization]] and "Wrath of the High Exarch".
*Eligible mobs are [[Antoran Drudge]]s, [[Antoran Fiendmaster]]s, [[Vilefiend Tracker]]s, [[Demonfly Acidmaw]]s, [[Acidmaw Larva]]e, and [[Antoran Despoiler]]s.

==Progression==
