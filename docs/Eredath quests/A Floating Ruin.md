==Objectives==
Travel to [[Eredath]].
* Use the [[Navigation Console]] to go to Eredath

==Description==
We knew the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] to be a formidable foe, but recent events demonstrate that we do not possess the necessary strength to continue. We have come too far to fail at this critical moment.

I know of a relic on Eredath, my ancient home, that may be our salvation. We must take the [[Vindicaar]] beyond the surface of [[Argus]], to the floating ruin suspended above us.

Perhaps there we will find the salvation we so desperately need.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|85|}}

==Completion==
<[[Prophet Velen|Velen]]'s gaze is drawn to the ruins spread out before him.>

I am home.

==Notes==
;Quest accept
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|I have given our plight much thought. As it currently stands, we will be destroyed if we challenge [[Antorus, the Burning Throne|Antorus]].}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|There is one hope, one treasure that may give us the edge we need.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|We called it the [[Crown of the Triumvirate]].}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|A lifetime ago, my brothers and I crafted a relic designed to bring prosperity to all.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|I still possess a third of the whole. I carry it with me always. This is the [[Eye of Prophecy (lore)|Eye of Prophecy]].}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|The remaining fragments may still be here, on Argus. We must go to Mac'Aree where my brothers and I once ruled.}}

;Arrive at Eredath
: ''Velen is stunned and dismayed.''
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Mac'Aree... this is all that is left.}}

;Speak with Velen again
: It has been so very long since I have laid eyes on this place. The memories... overwhelm me.

''{{gossip|What happened here, Prophet?}}''

:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Eredath was once the pinnacle of [[eredar]] civilization.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|A beacon of progress... that drew the [[Sargeras|malevolence of the universe]] to our very gates.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|The last time I laid eyes upon this place, I could think of nothing but escape. [[Talgath]], my most trusted advisor, had betrayed me.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|I told him of my plan to leave [[Argus]]. I asked him to bring my family and join me. Instead, he went to [[Kil'jaeden]].}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|The rest, you know.}}
