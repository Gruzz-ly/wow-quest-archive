==Objectives==
Seek the [[:Crest of Knowledge]].

* Go with [[Velen]]
* Listen to [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]]'s Tale

==Description==
Even with the [[:Sigil of Awakening]] in hand, the [[Crown of the Triumvirate|Crown]] cannot save us until it is whole.

That is why we must enter the [[Seat of the Triumvirate]], even knowing that [[L'ura]] awaits us there.

This is a dire task, one that I would not ask if it were not completely necessary.

We will descend together. Come.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|85|}}

==Progress==
Such a task I cannot undertake alone. Your help is greatly appreciated, <name>.

==Completion==
This is grave news indeed. It would be wise to follow Alleria's lead from here.
