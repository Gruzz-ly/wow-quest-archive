==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Talgath Argus.jpg|Talgath|Acting as [[Kil'jaeden]]'s unseen, unspoken master of the hunt, Talgath pursued the [[draenei]] across the stars.}}
Defeat Talgath.
*Talk to [[Velen]]
*[[Talgath]] defeated

==Description==
Talgath. There was a time I called him an ally, a friend.

I put my trust in him when it came time to leave [[Argus]]. I asked him to call out to the others who would join me.

I gave him all that he needed to betray me and slaughter my followers.

I do not know what brought this hatred to lurk in his heart, but his machinations repeatedly forced my people to flee world after world. He made it his mission to hunt us across the [[Great Dark Beyond|universe]].

This must end, <name>. Talgath must die.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|38|80}}
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Completion==
It is done. This one wrong, of many, is finally set to rights.
