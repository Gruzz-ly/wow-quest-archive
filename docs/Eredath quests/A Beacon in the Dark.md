==Objectives==
Take the Remnant of Nhal'athoth to [[Velen]] on the [[Vindicaar]].

* Return to the Vindicaar
* [[Remnant of Nhal'athoth]] (provided)

==Description==
That was... an intense experience.

<Alleria rubs her forehead.>

It is difficult to focus. I need you to return to Velen. Give him this.

<She places something cold and dense in your palm.>

I feel as though he should have it, though I am not sure why.

Tell him all that we have learned. I am sure [[Grand Artificer Romuul|Romuul]] will have been watching our progress. With any luck, a beacon is already headed our way. 

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[Lightforged Beacon: Shadowguard Incursion]]

You will also receive: {{cost|9|70|va=50}}

==Progress==
What is this? Such darkness...

==Completion==
What is it you bring, <name>?

<Velen peers down upon the cold, dense object.>

Intriguing...
