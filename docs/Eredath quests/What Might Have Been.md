==Objectives==
Witness [[Velen]]'s memory.

* Talk to Velen

==Description==
<Velen continues to stare at the statue as he speaks.>

Thousands of years ago, when I was young, I made a choice.

A choice that allowed [[Argus|my world]] to fall to ruin. A choice that made my people [[Draenei|exiles]]. A choice that forever separated me from my beloved brothers.

<Velen shakes his head.>

I cannot leave, not yet. Not until I have had a chance to reflect.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
* +75 reputation with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Progress==
Memory roots me in place, more surely than the heaviest stone.

==Completion==
<Prophet Velen peers solemnly at you.>

Thank you.

==Notes==
;Velen
:Let me show you what I have done. Perhaps, then, I can make peace with it at long last.
:{{gossip|Show me.}}

;Cinematic
:''At [[Kil'jaeden's Terrace]] thousands years ago, [[Sargeras]] appears in his uncorrupted form to [[Archimonde]], Velen, and [[Kil'jaeden]].''
:{{text|say|Sargeras|Swear loyalty to me, pledge the hearts of [[Eredar|your people]] to my cause.}}
:{{text|say|Sargeras|I will transform you, granting knowledge beyond imagining and might beyond measure.}}
:''The view shifts to show Velen turn his head to look at Archimonde, already nodding and smiling. Velen then looks at an expressionless Kil'jaeden. The view shifts back to Sargeras.''
:{{text|say|Sargeras|Together, we will become [[Burning Legion|Legion]], and defeat the hungering [[void]] that would consume us all.}}
:''With the meeting concluded, the three walk together to discuss the matter.''
:{{text|say|Archimonde|It is little enough to ask, for what he offers us.}}
:{{text|say|Kil'jaeden|Such power... And he speaks the truth.}}
:''Velen stops walking, but the other two continue on without noticing.''
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|I had hoped the others would sense the darkness behind Sargeras's words.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|But they were blinded by their vanity... their hunger for power.}}
:''The scene changes to show Velen communing with a bright crystal.''
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|The [[Ata'mal crystal|ata'mal crystal]] soon showed me the horrible truth of what would come to pass if we accepted the [[titan]]'s offer.}}
:''The view shifts to show images of Kil'jaeden and Archimonde.''
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|We would be transformed not into wise leaders, but into hateful monsters.}}
:''The images of Kil'jaeden and Archimonde warp into their [[Fel|fel-corrupted]] forms. It's at this point that the memory ends.''

;Quest completion
:''A Legion portal appears at the front of the Terrace, and a familiar face shows himself.''
:{{text|yell|[[Talgath]]|Make way. I will deal with this myself.}}
:{{text|say|[[High Exarch Turalyon]]|He's here.}}
