==Objectives==
Speak with the [[krokul]] beneath [[Ruins of Oronaar|Oranaar]].

==Description==
The krokul we found beneath Oranaar did not wish to leave. Could you speak with him, <name>? Convince him to board the [[Vindicaar]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Completion==
I told the others; I will not abandon my people. I must remain here, but maybe you can help? I have discovered a way to purge the [[shadow]] from the [[void]]-addled.

==Notes==
Use the [[Navigation Console]] to teleport to the City Center point in [[Eredath]]. Travel southwest past the {{questfinish}} mark, go ''down'' the stairs, then circle back towards the indicated point. Nabiru will be located at the back of the cave in [[Oronaar Collapse]].
