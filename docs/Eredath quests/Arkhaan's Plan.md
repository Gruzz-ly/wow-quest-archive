;Quest accept
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|This way. Arkhaan has a plan.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Could you elaborate? Even a little?}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Perhaps with some idea of what you hope to achieve?}}
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|We will stop the whispers. Pointy-ears should know.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I must confess, Arkhaan, that does not put me at ease.}}
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|Look. The way is closed. How will we go to Isolon now?}}

;Talk to Arkhaan
:Can you hear them? Chewing, gnashing, wailing...

:<Arkhaan shudders.>

:Isolon is lost.

:{{gossip|We should keep going.}}

::They will hunt us. The shadows know we resist them. Turn back, turn back!

::{{gossip|Alleria and I will protect you.}}

;Escort Arkhaan
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Are all these creatures...}}
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|My people. Once.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|How is it that you do not share their fate?}}
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|Arkhaan forgets.}}
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|Wait. There is a voice...}}
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|We still hear their prayers. Rest, brothers. Rest.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|At least their suffering is over.}}
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|Quiet, quiet! Arkhaan listens...}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Where are these things coming from?}}
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|They want Arkhaan. He promised to save them.}}
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|Who calls to Arkhaan? Name yourself!}}
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|Arkhaan remembers. Isolon calls to us! Isolon will look to the stars again!}}
:''Arkhaan opens a void portal.''
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|That is not Isolon calling to you! Wait!}}
:''Arkhaan crosses through the portal.''
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|He is still there. He crossed over into the [[Void]]. We may still be able to save him if we hurry.}}
