==Objectives==
*[[Crystallized Memory]] (30)

==Description==
:{{text|say|[[Grand Artificer Romuul]]|We have many unanswered questions about my brethren's fall to madness here in [[Eredath]]. Bring me any memory crystals you find and I will continue my research.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Completion==
:''Romuul's tone is subdued and solemn.''
:{{text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|It is grim work, reliving the last sane moments of their troubled lives. But it is the best and only way to honor them. Thank you for your help.}}

==Notes==
There are single crystals all over, and the krokul mobs will each drop one. The most efficient way thought is to find [[Preserved Crystal Collection]]s, wide bowls of crystals, in the ruins of the eredar homes. Just be aware that it will also likely be the most popular method.

==Patch changes==
