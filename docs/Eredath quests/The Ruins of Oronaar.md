==Objectives==
Use the [[Scouting Map]] and complete the mission, "[[Inches from Madness]]."

==Description==
Many [[krokul]] wander the city below, shrouded in shadow. I will not accept that they are all beyond redemption.

[[Arkhaan]] was a leader, once. Some among his followers may still reside in the [[Ruins of Oronaar|ruins of Oranaar]], straddling the thin divide between reason and oblivion. Enlist the aid of [[Class Hall|your order]]. Scour the ruins for any that can be saved.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[Eredath Equipment]]

==Progress==
Yes, <name>?

==Completion==
Your champions discovered someone living in a cave beneath Oranaar. He is hiding from the Void-Touched, and he appears lucid.
