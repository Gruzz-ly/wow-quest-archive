==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Umbra Hollows]] with [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] and [[Locus-Walker]].
* Meet Alleria in Umbra Hollows
* Enter the [[Void Tear]]
* [[Dismantled Portal]] examined
* [[Image of Saprish]] examined
* Voidforge examined
* Meet Alleria and Locus-Walker

==Description==
That was Locus-Walker. He taught me all that I know about the [[Void]], and he still has more to teach me.

If he is here, then the [[ethereal]]s' presence only intrigues me further. I had thought him the only one of his kind, but now that I have seen another tangling with the Void...

Come, we must play his game if we want to learn what he knows. He appears to have gone toward the Umbra Hollows to the north. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|70|va=50}}

==Progress==
Move quickly, or we may lose him.

==Completion==
<Alleria seems momentarily speechless.>

==Notes==
;Quest accept
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|This way.}}

;Meet at Umbra Hollows
:{{text|say|Locus-Walker|I have something I want to show you, but we mustn't be seen. Follow.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Explain yourself first.}}
:{{text|say|Locus-Walker|Such impatience. I believe you will find the answers you seek on the other side.}}
:''The Locus-Walker enters the void tear, soon after followed by Alleria.''

;Dismantled Portal examined
:{{text|yell|[[Shadowguard Voidcaster]]|There is plenty material for the harvest, here. Let none of it go to waste!}}

;First catch-up with Alleria and Locus-Walker
:{{text|say|Locus-Walker|How industriously they work. A pity they will be overtaken.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I sense a little disappointment. Was I really your best student?}}

;Image of Saprish examined
:{{text|say|Image of Saprish|I will not give Locus-Walker the satisfaction of disrupting our efforts. Capture him at all costs.}}
:{{text|say|Image of Saprish|Do what you like with the fleshling and her ally. They are of no concern.}}

;Second catch-up
:{{text|say|Locus-Walker|I had hoped to find at least one promising soul on this rock.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I have not turned away from that path. You know why I resisted.}}

;Voidforge examined
:{{text|yell|Shadowguard Voidcaster|Our work is nearly complete. Soon, all of [[Argus]] will fall to darkness!}}

;Third catch-up
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I need to finish what I started, Locus-Walker.}}
:{{text|say|Locus-Walker|Can you, though? With your... attachments?}}
:''The group leaves the void tear.''
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|What are you talking about?}}
:{{text|say|Locus-Walker|Why, [[Turalyon|your mate]] of course. How does he feel about your choices?}}

;Random mob conversations
*{{text|say|[[Shadowguard Ethereal]]|I hear the [[Viceroy Nezhar|Viceroy]] finally took care of [[Arkhaan|that meddling priest]].}}
:{{text|say|Shadowguard Ethereal|A pity he did not kill the [[Alleria Windrunner|elf]] and her [[Adventurer|ally]], too.}}

*{{text|say|Shadowguard Ethereal|What was that?}}

==Trivia==
*This quest's name is a reference to the slang term "{{Wp|Throw shade|throwing shade}}”, meaning to subtly insult someone.
