==Objectives==
Slay 15 [[Shadowguard]] [[Ethereal]]s.
* Shadowguard Ethereals slain  (15)

==Description==
As you have surely gathered by now, a certain subset of my people have tragically succumbed to the call of the [[Void]].

I had hoped to find more who possess the necessary strength of mind. I am disappointed to find such an utter lack of resistance.

It cannot be helped. To advance your cause, and mine, we will need to eradicate these weak-willed beings.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|60|}}

{{itembox||q1=100|Veiled Argunite
}}

==Completion==
It is good to know we can share a common goal. Perhaps I will find some use for your kind yet.

==Progression==
