==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Echo of Khazaduum.jpg|Echo of Khazaduum|Khazaduum was the first to undergo a horrific transformation, granting him strength unlike any known to the [[Eredar]] at the time.}}

Retrieve the Argunite Keystone from the [[Echo of Khazaduum]].

* [[Argunite Keystone]]

==Description==
The [[Argunite Matrix]] that powered this part of [[Eredath]] was shattered by a hulking beast. We had never seen another like him.

He was called [[Khazaduum]] and he was a most faithful servant of the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]. He volunteered to undergo an experimental transformation to become the first of his kind. His arrival was the end of this battle.

As a prize he took the Argunite Keystone from the shattered matrix. Take it back and we can finally end this bloodshed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Progress==
Please, they should not be made to suffer any longer.

==Completion==
I cannot right every wrong that happened here, but this is a comfort nonetheless.

Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept of both [[Defenseless and Afraid]] and "Khazaduum, First of His Name":
:{{text|say|[[Prophet Velen]]|So many were left behind... They linger, forced to relive their final moments over and over again.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Perhaps the only way to end their torment is to finish what I started so very long ago.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|We must let these spirits finally realize their escape.}}

On aggro:
:{{text|say|Echo of Khazaduum|You will not bow? Then die!}}

On kill:
:{{text|say|Echo of Kahazaduum|I am not the last. The [[eredar]]... will rise...}}

On completion of both quests:
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|This is the turning point. If we can activate the arena's defenses, this battle will be finished.}}

==Progression==
{{A Floating Ruin}}
