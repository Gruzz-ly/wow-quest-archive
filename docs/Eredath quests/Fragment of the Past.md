==Objectives==
Take the [[:Glowing Key Fragment]] to [[Captain Fareeya]].

==Description==
<Your eye is drawn to the faint glow of the crystalline fragment. Examining the piece, you trace the partial pattern of a rune that had been inscribed upon its surface.

The fragment appears similar to the [[argunite]] crystals used by the [[Army of the Light]] to power their armaments. Could this crystal have belonged to the [[eredar]] who fought to escape [[Argus]] so long ago?

Perhaps Captain Fareeya would be able to tell you more about the crystal.>

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|70|}}

==Completion==
<Fareeya examines the crystal fragment.>

This is old... very old. It is a piece of an elaborate key, the sort my people use to secure our most prized and sacred places.

I wonder...

==Gains==
* +75 reputation with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Notes==
Turn the quest in to Captain Fareeya aboard the ''[[Vindicaar]]'' in [[Eredath]].
