== Objectives ==
* [[Clotted Void Crystal]] (100)

== Description ==
: {{text|say|[[Alleria Windrunner]]|This place is churning out darkness, manifesting into crystals of pure [[void]]. The [[Shadowguard]] covets this resource. We must claim it before they do.}}

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
* +150 reputation with [[Argussian Reach]]

== Completion ==
: {{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|That is one less arrow in their quiver. Perhaps I can find a use for these crystals that will benefit our cause.}}

== Notes ==
Triggers at [[Umbra Hollows]] in [[Eredath]]. The best source is to directly loot the [[Congealed Void Crystal]]s, but you will likely have to kill some mobs to complete the quest.

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 8.1.0|note=''[[Legion]]'' World Quests for the [[Highmountain Tribe]], [[Nightfallen (faction)|Nightfallen]], [[Army of the Light]], and [[Argussian Reach]] now reward increased reputation.}}
* {{Patch 7.3.0|note=Added.}}
