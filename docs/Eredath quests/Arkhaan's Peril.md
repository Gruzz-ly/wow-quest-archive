==Objectives==
Enter the [[Void Tear]] and deal with [[Arkhaan]].

* Cross into the [[Void]]
* Deal with Arkhaan

==Description==
Whatever called to him, it cannot have good intentions. We need to go in after him.

Before we step through this portal, <name>... ensure you are prepared to fight. The Void's influence is rarely peaceful. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|14|60|va=100}}

==Progress==
We must address this threat.

==Completion==
As I said, the Void's influence is rarely peaceful. We must press on.

==Notes==
;Cross over into Void
:''[[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] and the [[adventurer]] enter a fragment of the Void realm. In front of them is a rough circle of deceased [[Isolon Devout]]s, with Arkhaan in the middle and kneeling before a floating [[ethereal]].''
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Who is that?}}

;On approach
*{{text|whisper|Xal'atath|Watch now as a weak mind gives way to darkness.}} ''(Priests wielding [[Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire]])''
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|Show us, please... please...}}
:{{text|say|[[Viceroy Nezhar]]|Let me satisfy your curiosity.}}
:''Viceroy Nezhar channels void energies into Arkhaan, then fades out once done.''
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|Thank you! Thank you!}}
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|Arkhaan finally understands...}}
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|It will all be undone! There is nothing... but the Void.}}
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|You must know the truth!}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Resist their call, Arkhaan!}}
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|Arkhaan will make you understand!}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|No! What you have seen is a lie!}}
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|Whispers... too... loud! Aaargghhh!}}
:''Arkhaan's body is warped by the Void.''
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|We are losing him!}}
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|Why... they not... listen?}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|He cannot hear us! We must end his suffering.}}
:{{text|say|Arkhaan|What has Arkhaan... done?}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I am sorry that you had to learn this way. Rest now.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Do you feel that? Something is pulling us back...}}
*{{text|whisper|Xal'atath|He flaunts his defiance of the shadows. Arrogance will be his undoing.}}

;Quest completion
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|[[Locus-Walker]]?}}
:{{text|say|Locus-Walker|I see you've met the viceroy.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|What are your people doing here?}}
:{{text|say|Locus-Walker|I am here to find out. Follow, if you can.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Wait!}}
