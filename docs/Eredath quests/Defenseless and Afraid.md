==Objectives==
Collect Stolen Pylon Cores from enemies in [[Triumvirate's End]] and use them to activate 3 Ancient Pylons.
*[[Ancient Pylon]]s activated (3)

==Description==
This is the battle that raged while I awaited the [[Genedar]]. So many ran to join me, but [[Kil'jaeden]] inspired still more to stand in their way.

My people were slaughtered without mercy.

To cover our retreat I ordered for this arena's defenses to be activated. It is clear that they were unable.

To turn the tide in this battle, to give these spirits rest, we must do what they could not. Find a way to activate the pylons.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]
*[[Depleted Pylon Core]]

==Progress==
I will hold this position. The spirits may be only echoes of their former selves, but they do not know that.

==Completion==
The tide is turning. We must press forward.

==Notes==
On accept of both "Defenseless and Afraid" and [[Khazaduum, First of His Name]]:
:{{text|say|[[Prophet Velen]]|So many were left behind... They linger, forced to relive their final moments over and over again.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Perhaps the only way to end their torment is to finish what I started so very long ago.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|We must let these spirits finally realize their escape.}}

In order to activate the pylons, you need to kill the [[Zealous Echo]]es in the area until a [[Stolen Pylon Core]] drops. Only then can you interact with an ancient pylon, and you will need a core for each pylon.

On completion of both quests:
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|This is the turning point. If we can activate the arena's defenses, this battle will be finished.}}

==Progression==
{{A Floating Ruin}}
