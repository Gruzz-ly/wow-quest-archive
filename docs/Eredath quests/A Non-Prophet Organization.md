==Objectives==
Locate [[Prophet Velen|Velen]].
* Find Velen

==Description==
I have complete faith that Velen is nearby. We would know if he had been captured.

All the same, we must not delay. The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] has a vested interest in finding him after all he has done to resist them. I shudder to think what they might do, given the chance.

That is why I am going with you.

We will find Velen and help him track down the [[:Crest of Knowledge]]. We must have faith in his mission or all will be lost.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]
*[[Draenic Bookcase]]

==Completion==
You came upon me in a moment of reflection.

<Velen peers at you with a tired expression.>

There is no time for such sentiment. We must press on.

==Notes==
Turalyon will join your side after you have picked up both "A Non-Prophet Organization" and [[Wrath of the High Exarch]].

;Find Velen
:''Velen is kneeling next to what appears to be a long-abandoned child's bed. Turalyon stops just inside the entrance.''
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|Velen?}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Forgive me, [[Rakeesh|my son]].}}
: ''Turalyon walks toward him.''
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|Are you hurt?}}
:''Velen stands and closes the distance to Turalyon.''
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|I am unharmed.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Your arrival is timely. We must find the Crest of Knowledge before [[Talgath]] takes it beyond our reach.}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|So he is here, then. I was afraid of this.}}

Copies of Turalyon who follow other players are seen under the [[generic name]] "Lightforged Vindicator".
