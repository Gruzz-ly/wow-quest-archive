==Objectives==
*[[Antoran Infiltrator]] slain

==Description==
:{{text|say|[[Prophet Velen]]|Strange... Spirits have congregated to hear Kil'jaeden speak, yet all is not as it seems. I sense a demonic presence. Find it among the crowd before it can stage an ambush.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Completion==
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|An unusual tactic, to be certain. The Legion cannot be allowed to use these defenseless spirits for their machinations.}}

==Notes==
*The world quest happens in [[Kil'jaeden's Terrace]] on [[Eredath]].
*During the world quest, Kil'jaeden gives a speech.
:{{text|yell|[[Echo of Kil'jaeden]]|My people, I have called you here to share a revelation.}}
:{{text|yell|Echo of Kil'jaeden|For so long, we eredar have been alone in the universe.}}
:{{text|yell|Echo of Kil'jaeden|The beacon of our civilization shining bright... upon what we feared was an empty void.}}
:{{text|yell|Echo of Kil'jaeden|We need not endure this solitude any longer.}}
:{{text|yell|Echo of Kil'jaeden|The Triumvirate has received a visitor from another world!}}
:{{text|yell|Echo of Kil'jaeden|He has shown us the path to a new future.}}
:{{text|yell|Echo of Kil'jaeden|He offers us power unlike any we have known before.}}
:{{text|yell|Echo of Kil'jaeden|In partnership with our new ally, the light of the eredar will shine bright across the cosmos!}}
:{{text|yell|Echo of Kil'jaeden|I ask you, now, to raise your voices in praise. Praise Sargeras!}}

*Among the gathered eredar are: [[Echo of Valok]], [[Echo of Restalaan]], [[Echo of Crystalsmith Netrius]], [[Echo of Hatuun]], [[Echo of Talgath]], [[Echo of Maatparm]], [[Echo of Archimonde]], [[Echo of Velen]], [[Echo of Rakeesh]], [[Echo of Nuuri]], [[Echo of Arkhaan]], [[Ancient Citizen]]s, [[Augari Novitiate]]s, and [[Forgotten Denizen]]s.
