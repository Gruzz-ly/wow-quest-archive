==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Archimonde Mac'Aree.jpg|Archimonde|Archimonde did not know he would become the Defiler, but his pursuit of power did not start when [[Sargeras]] arrived.}}
Defeat Archimonde and retrieve the Sigil of Awakening.
*[[Archimonde (echo)|Archimonde]] defeated
*[[Sigil of Awakening]]

==Description==
It seems you are not so easily deterred. Very well.

Your deeds qualify you to seek the Sigil. To be clear, I am only permitting you to move on. This does not guarantee your success.

The greatest of your challenges lies before you.

You must go to the [[Praetorium]] and face Archimonde himself. Only by defeating the master of the [[Conservatory of the Arcane|Conservatory]] will you be worthy of the Sigil.

Few have overcome this obstacle. I hope he does not make too much of a mess of you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|38|80}}
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]
*[[Ruined Conservatory Emblem]]

==Progress==
Archimonde himself... what have we gotten ourselves into?

==Completion==
I have never felt power like this before...

<[[Archmage Y'mera|Y'mera]] handles the shard cautiously.>

We should get this to [[Velen]] as soon as we can.

==Notes==
The Praetorium overlooks the Conservatory in the northeast.
