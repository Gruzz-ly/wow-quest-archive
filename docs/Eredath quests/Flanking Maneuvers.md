==Objectives==
Close 3 Legion Portals.
*Legion portals closed (3)

==Description==
I will take command of [[Captain Fareeya|Fareeya]]'s lieutenants and we will escort [[Velen]] to the [[:Crest of Knowledge]]. His mission must not fail.

We face an old foe-- one the [[Army of the Light]] has encountered on numerous occasions. [[Talgath]] will try to block us in and prevent our retreat.

You must not let that happen. Find out how he is bringing in his forces and cut them off. All we need is time to get in and get out.

We are counting on you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
'{{cost|19|40}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
It must be close. [[Kil'jaeden]] knew I would come for it.

==Completion==
<Velen stares at the shattered statue before him and says nothing.>

==Notes==
On accept of both "Flanking Maneuvers" and [[Talgath's Forces]]:
:{{text|say|[[High Exarch Turalyon]]|We will escort Velen safely to the Crest.}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|If you cover our retreat, we may just see this through.}}
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|Lead the way, Prophet.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Make haste, my friends. Something dark and terrible stirs... and it is not Talgath.}}
:''Turalyon, Velen, and the Army lieutenants head out.''

;Entering quest zone
:{{text|yell|Talgath|Yes! They flee to the [[Kil'jaeden's Terrace|Terrace]]! We have them right where we want them!}}

;Destroy all portals
:{{text|yell|Talgath|Your screams will echo through [[Antorus, the Burning Throne|Antorus]] if they escape!}}

;On approach
:{{text|emote|[[Grand Vindicator Sorvos]] nods to you.}}
:''Further ahead, the [[Echo of Kil'jaeden]] is speaking to the [[Echo of Talgath]] while Turalyon and Velen look on.''
:{{text|say|Echo of Kil'jaeden|Worthless. The Crest alone is powerless.}}
:{{text|say|Echo of Kil'jaeden|This relic's time has passed. Throw it in the temple with the [[L'ura|naaru]]. Let them rot together.}}
:''The echoes walk away and dissipate.''
:{{text|say|High Exarch Turalyon|At least we know where it is.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|It is hidden in the [[Seat of the Triumvirate]], then. I sense only darkness within.}}

==Progression==
{{War of Light and Shadow}}
