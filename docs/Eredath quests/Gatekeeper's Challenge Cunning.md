==Objectives==
Collect a Fragment of Acuity, Wit, and Guile and combine them into a [[:Mark of Cunning]].
*Inspect the [[Well-Preserved Tome]]
*[[Fragment of Acuity]]
*[[Fragment of Wit]]
*[[Fragment of Guile]]

==Description==
[[Archimonde]] expected greatness from his pupils. Only the most imaginative minds, the most adroit of intellects, could ever truly fathom the deepest reaches of our magic.

I doubt you can relate.

The path to the left will take you to a set of three statues. Use them to collect a Mark of Cunning.

To preserve the integrity of this trial, I will not be able to provide hints. If you do, by some miracle, happen to succeed, I will formally recognize your... brilliance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Progress==
Display the Mark of Cunning or leave me alone.

==Completion==
Oh. You were successful.

Surprising.

==Notes==
Each ancient sculpture displays one of the three primary colors. Interacting with a statue will grant you its color, with the color changing if you obtain more than one blessing (ex. yellow and blue creates green). In order to access the fragments, you need to match the color of the marker as indicated by the building. Make sure you always have exactly two blessings active (click a statue a second time to remove its blessing if necessary), and cycle through all three possible combinations of two blessings.

* [[Fragment of Guile]]: [[Ancient Scholar Scripture]] + [[Ancient Consul Sculpture]]. Go inside building on far left from the statues.
* [[Fragment of Wit]]: Ancient Scholar Scripture + [[Ancient Wakener Sculpture]]. Go inside building straight ahead from the statues.
* [[Fragment of Acuity]]: Ancient Consul Sculpture + Ancient Wakener Sculpture. Go a short distance east and loot chest among the ruins of a building.

==Progression==
