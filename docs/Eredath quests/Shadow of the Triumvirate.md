==Objectives==
Return to the [[Vindicaar]].
*Return to the Vindicaar

==Description==
[[Talgath]]'s words carry more gravity than I think he knew. In an attempt to hurt me one final time, he has given us the answer.

The [[:Crest of Knowledge]] is hidden away in the [[Seat of the Triumvirate]], and it is not unguarded.

If my suspicions are correct, we may be facing a greater threat than any of us dared imagine.

A [[Naaru#Biology|dark naaru]].

Let us return to the Vindicaar. We will plan our next steps there.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
*{{Abilities|Kil'jaeden's Terrace World Quests|id=252755|icon=achievement_dungeon_auchindoun}}
*[[Lightforged Beacon: Prophet's Reflection]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*[[Light-Smote Skullplate]]
*+75 reputation with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Completion==
I worried for [[L'ura]], but this is... unthinkable.

How she must have suffered...

==Notes==
Follow the group to the [[Light-Forged Beacon]].

;On board
: ''Teleporting back to the ship, the NPCs teleport in with you as a group. As everyone exits the room, the Army lieutenants [[Baraat the Longshot]], [[Grand Vindicator Sorvos]], and [[Blademaster Telaamon]] walk off to port side to report in to [[Captain Fareeya]]. Turalyon follows Velen to stand by the edge of the rear wall overlooking the bridge.
