==Objectives==
Raise 6 Champions to 925 Item Level.
*Raise 6 Followers to 925 Item Level

==Description==
I failed [[Arkhaan]]. I won't fail again.

If there is to be any hope of freeing the [[krokul]], the [[ethereal]] threat must be removed from [[Eredath]]. [[L'ura]] has been vanquished, but the [[void]] clings heavily near the [[Shadowguard Incursion]].

Before we commence, ensure your forces are protected from the shadow. Your champions should seek ancient [[eredar]] armaments in the nearby ruins.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Army of the Light]]

==Progress==
Yes, <name>?

==Completion==
The voidcallers roaming the Shadowguard Incursion must be extinguished. Your people are sufficiently armed for the coming encounter.

==Progression==
...
