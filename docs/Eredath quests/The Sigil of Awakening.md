==Objectives==
Return to the [[Vindicaar]] and secure the Sigil of Awakening.
*Return to the Vindicaar
*[[Sigil of Awakening]] secured

==Description==
This relic is too powerful to keep it out in the open.

We must return to the Vindicaar at once. The Prophet will know what to do.

I did want to thank you, <name>. Without you this would not be possible. [[Vigilant Quoram|Quoram]] would have ensured I never got near the Sigil. Perhaps some day I will share that story with you.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you: [[Shroud of Arcane Echoes]]

You will learn the following:
*{{Abilities|Eredath World Quests|id=252632|icon=inv_misc_tournaments_symbol_draenei}}
*[[Lightforged Beacon: Conservatory of the Arcane]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Progress==
Did you recover the Sigil of Awakening?

==Completion==
We are that much closer to restoring the [[:Crown of the Triumvirate]] to its former glory.

==Notes==
;Quest accept
:{{text|emote|[[Archmage Y'mera]] waves for you to follow her.}}
:''Y'mera leaves via the Lightforged Beacon.''

;Quest completion
: ''Velen walks up to look at the sigil.''
:{{text|say|[[Prophet Velen]]|[[Archimonde]] was disdainful of the Sigil's limitations. Without the rest of the Crown, it gave him little power. And power was all he ever craved.}}
: ''He turns around and heads back to the navigation console.''
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|This disdain is what allowed us to recover the Sigil. Had he anticipated its value to us, heh, he most certainly would have destroyed it.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|I do wonder what he hoped to prove with his trials. Was the Sigil itself the test, perhaps?}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|We are one step closer to unlocking the Vindicaar's true potential. All that remains is the [[:Crest of Knowledge]]. Then the Crown will once more be whole.}}
