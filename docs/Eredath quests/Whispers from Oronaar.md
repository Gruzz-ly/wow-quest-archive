==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Ruins of Oronaar]].

* Investigate the Ruins of Oronaar
* [[Discarded Naaru Figurine|Naaru figurine]] inspected
* [[Abandoned Altar|Abandoned altar]] inspected
* [[Frantic Wall Scrawlings|Wall scrawlings]] inspected

==Description==
[[Ethereal]]s, the [[Void]], a Dark [[Naaru]]... I feel they are all connected.

I explored the ruins below while you and [[Velen]] were seeking the [[Crown of the Triumvirate|Crown]]. There are survivors, <name>.

[[Broken]] wander the cluster of buildings to our west- I cannot understand much of what they say but I suspect that their minds are not their own.

If the Void is to blame, we will need to start our investigation there.

I will conduct my own search in the meantime.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|85|}}

==Progress==
We must get to the bottom of this.

==Completion==
Something is very wrong here.

==Notes==
Use the [[Navigation Console]] to travel to [[Triumvirate's End]], then head northwest to the ruins.

On quest accept:
:{{text|say|[[Alleria Windrunner]]|I will meet you in the ruins below, <name>. We will begin where the darkness ends.}}
:''She runs to the navigation console and teleports out.''

Upon entering the ruins:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|It is as I thought. The Void's corruption has reached them here.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I am certain it had help. Take a look around. Call for me if you find anything of interest.}}

Go to the nearby Prayer Effigy and pick up [[Arkhaan's Prayers]].

Inside a nearby building, you'll find an abandoned altar:
:{{text|say|[[Echo of Arkhaan]]|You must hold fast to your resolve. Temptation weakens the mind and spirit.}}

In the east area of [[Ruins of Oronaar]], you'll find a [[Frantic Wall Scrawling]] on a wall:
:{{text|say|Echo of Arkhaan|Do not let the long, dark night break you. Accept its gift.}}

From there, travel north to find a [[Discarded Naaru Figurine]]:
:{{text|say|Echo of Arkhaan|Look to the heavens above. See the million points of brilliance in the [[Great Dark Beyond|great dark beyond]].}}
:{{text|say|Echo of Arkhaan|Know you are not alone. Our salvation is out there, somewhere.}}

Once you have accomplished your goals in the ruins, Alleria will get your attention:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|I found a survivor. Come to me.}}

==Progression==
{{War of Light and Shadow}}
