==Objectives==
Repair the Argunite Matrix beneath [[Triumvirate's End]].
*[[Argunite Matrix]] restored

==Description==
We have everything we need.

In the alcove below you will find the shattered remains of the Argunite Matrix. Replacing the Keystone will restore it to full capacity.

The pylons you activated will then be able to repel those who still hunt my people. At long last this battle will be over.

I hope it brings them peace.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Argussian Reach]]

==Progress==
Hurry <name>, we cannot let this continue any longer.

==Completion==
<[[Velen]] peers at you, troubled.>

==Notes==
The entrance to the bunker is located down the stairs and to the left.
:''The [[adventurer]] heads back up after repairing the Argunite Matrix, to see that the [[Zealous Echo]]es are gone, and Velen standing where the [[Echo of L'ura]] once was.''
