:''Velen uses the teleport system to leave the ''[[Vindicaar]]''.

;Grand Artificer Romuul
:Eredath... it looks just like how I remember it. The forests, the hills, the herds of [[talbuk]]...

:I wonder if my old workshop is still down there. Do you think if you had a moment, you could...?

:Forgive me. You have much more important things to do. Let me know when you are ready to go to the surface.

''{{gossip|I am ready, Romuul.}}''

:''You are teleported down at the right side of Velen.''

;Velen
:<Velen stares straight ahead. He doesn't seem to notice you have arrived.>

''{{gossip|Shall we continue?}}''

;Cutscene
:''Velen's memory of the day that he and his followers fled from Argus plays out...''
:{{text|say|[[Hatuun]]|[[Talgath]] has turned against us!}}
: ''Standing beside Velen, Hatuun points out Talgath down the slope in the distance, leading an army of [[man'ari eredar]] towards them.''
:{{text|say|Velen|No...}}
:{{text|say|Hatuun|It cannot end like this. Take the others and go, Prophet. We will buy you time.}}
: ''Hatuun leaps down as Velen protests in alarm.''
:{{text|say|Velen|Hatuun! You do not have to do this!}}
: ''Hatuun lands with four armored guards. He stands and looks back up over his left shoulder to Velen.''
:{{text|say|Hatuun|Please... keep my family safe.}}
:''While Hatuun and the guards keep the eredar forces at bay, Velen brings out a crystal.''
:{{text|say|Velen|[[K'ure]]! Help us!}}
:''A dimensional ship, the ''[[Genedar]]'', appears in the sky. Velen and the rest of his followers are pulled to it as the eredar forces eventually catch up. [[Kil'jaeden]], newly turned ''man'ari'', walks to the front and looks up at Velen.''
:{{text|say|Kil'jaeden|I will hunt you across the stars, traitor! Even if it takes a thousand years!}}

:''The memory ends, and Velen speaks up.''
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Wait... something stirs.}}
:''[[Echo of Argus (Eredath)|Echoes]] begin appearing. Velen begins walking quickly, while continuing to speak.''
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Spirits... of all those who died that day.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|I can still hear the [[naaru]]'s song of war. There was one who held the way open for us.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|She fell behind. I can feel her presence even now... but her song is bitter, distorted.}}
:''Velen stops at the stairs of [[Triumvirate's End]]. He begins to channel a holy sphere shield that kills any ''manari'' echo that touches it.''
