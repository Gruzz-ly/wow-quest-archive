==Objectives==
Acquire 3 Stacks of Letters from [[Nightborne Courier]]s using the Nightborne Spellblade.
*[[Stack of Letters]] (3)
*[[Nightborne Spellblade]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Verene]]'s child has gone missing. I can guess what happened, but I need to be sure.

Most guardsmen use couriers to relay delicate information. In this, magic is strictly the province of high ranking officials.

Take this blade. Do not touch the cutting edge. Use it to silently waylay the couriers and collect any correspondence they carry.

With any luck, the missives will tell us exactly where to find the girl.

We guards know everything, after all.

<Silgryn offers you a winning smile.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]
*{{cost|20|60}}
*16,870 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
Were you successful?

==Completion==
Fine work. I will read these over.
