==Objectives==
Examine the Leyline Feed in [[Shal'Aran]] with [[Arcanist Valtrois]].
*Leyline Feed examined

==Description==
With leyline energy feeding in from [[Ley Station Anora|Anora]], this chamber can begin to awaken.

It will be a slow process, and we must take care to mask this activity from our enemies, a process which itself requires enormous effort and focus.

Furthermore, there is the conundrum of actually consuming the mana in this form. A stream too weak is not enough to provide sustenance - too powerful and it would vaporize us.

There is much work to be done yet. For now, let us examine the feed.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you: [[Shal'Aran Leyline Feed]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*8,230 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
I will call upon you again, I am sure.

==Notes==
Upon first entering [[Shal'Aran]] upon completing [[Power Grid]], you will walk in on a conversation in progress between [[Arcanist Valtrois]] and [[First Arcanist Thalyssra]].
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|...and bring the outlander with you.}}
: ''Valtrois is a little reluctant.''
: {{text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|If... you insist.}}

On accept:
: ''Valtrois starts walking downstairs, but Thalyssra stops her for a moment.''
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|And Valtrois?}}
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|You would be wise not to turn your nose up at the outsiders. ''None'' of us would be here without their help.}}
: ''Valtrois continues on.''
: {{text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Of course, First Arcanist.}}
: {{text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Come, we can examine the feed from down here.}}
: {{text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Do you have much experience with leyline energy? I should think not.}}
: {{text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Allow me to educate you on the fundamentals.}}
: ''Valtrois stops before the aperture, which now has a thin beam of 'moonlight' coming up from it.  The ring and its base on top of the pedestal beside her - representing [[Ley Station Anora]] - flows with energy.''
: {{text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Far below us, rivers of raw arcane power course throughout the land. The leylines are eternal, primal, and impossible to control.}}
: {{text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|However, just as one pulls thread from cotton, so too can we draw power from the leylines.}}
: {{text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|See here. This is the feed from Anora. And there are many others still lying dormant.}}
: {{text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Restore them, and help us create a new locus of power here in Shal'Aran!}}
