==Objectives==
Use Khadgar's Wand to find Arcane Echoes and track down [[First Arcanist Thalyssra]]. 
* Faint Arcane Echo revealed
* Blinking Arcane Echo revealed
* Pulsing Arcane Echo revealed
* [[Erasmus Moonblade]] slain
* First Arcanist Thalyssra found
* [[Khadgar's Wand]] (provided)

==Description==
The nightborne could prove powerful allies against the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].  We must aid this Thalyssra if we can.

We should be able to find her by tracking her magical echoes, the same way I found her distress call.

I can teleport you near the location where she recorded that message.  From there, you must search for ripples in the very fabric of the [[arcane]] itself.

My wand should do the trick.  Follow the sparks it creates--they should lead you to places where Thalyssra used her magic.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16450 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
An outlander...

You received my message?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Be careful, champion. The land of Suramar has been wild for ten thousand years.}}

Enter the portal Khadgar opens. You will appear in the wilds of [[Meredil]] in [[Suramar]].

:{{Text|bossemote|Khadgar’s wand crackles to life.}}

Two [[Nightborne Scion]]s are patrolling the road.

:{{Text|say|Nightborne Scion|She must have come this way. Keep looking!}}
: ''The other scion walks off to search.''

Feel free to kill both, or just attack the first one and go around the other.

On revealing the Faint Arcane Echo, click on it to decipher it.

:{{Text|say|Echo of First Arcanist Thalyssra|Make haste to Suramar. You may be our last hope.}}
:{{Text|say|Echo of First Arcanist Thalyssra|Ith'nala kanesh!}}
:{{Text|say|Echo of First Arcanist Thalyssra|I hope someone out there is listening...}}
:{{Text|emote|Echo of First Arcanist Thalyssra winces in pain and holds her side.}}
: ''She goes down on one knee, but gets back up.''
:{{Text|say|Echo of First Arcanist Thalyssra|Ngh... need to keep moving.}}

Keep moving between echoes, fighting your way through Nightborne Scions  There is one kneeling down to inspect a dead withered.

Upon revealing the Blinking Arcane Echo:

:{{Text|say|Echo of First Arcanist Thalyssra|Rath!}}
: ''Having spoken a spell word, the attack fires at the corpse's location, revealing the cause of its death.''
:{{Text|say|Echo of First Arcanist Thalyssra|Withered... I must be getting close.}}
: ''She heads northwest to the stairs, casting a double shot spell that killed two more.''
:{{Text|say|Echo of First Arcanist Thalyssra|Rath-domaas!}}

The Pulsing Arcane Echo shows the echo of Thalyssra running to where, in the present moment, {{Mob|Erasmus Moonblade|Second Blade of Elisande}} is hanging suspended in the air in a magic bubble.

:{{Text|say|Echo of First Arcanist Thalyssra|Stand down, Erasmus! Can you not see that Elisande has forsaken us?!}}
:{{Text|say|Echo of First Arcanist Thalyssra|An'ah!}}
:''Thalyssra casts something, the Time Stop spell that put Erasmus into his present predicament in the first place.''
:{{Text|say|Echo of First Arcanist Thalyssra|That will buy me some time...}}

On attack, Erasmus is suddenly 'thrown' forward, completing an interrupted leap, to where Thalyssra was standing as he shouts.

:{{Text|yell|Erasmus Moonblade|Die!}}
:{{Text|say|Erasmus Moonblade|Gah! A time stop spell... She will pay for that!}}
:''Erasmus attacks you.''
:{{Text|say|Erasmus Moonblade|This is not your business, outlander. Thalyssra has betrayed the Grand Magistrix and must be put down!}}

;Casting Nether Suppression
:{{text|say|Erasmus Moonblade|Witness the power of the Nightborne!}}

After killing Erasmus:
:{{Text|say|Erasmus Moonblade|Who... are you?}}

Thalyssra is found farther down the road, projecting a defensive Arcane Barrier around herself to fend off the withered attacking her.
