==Objectives==
Activate all of the leyline feeds in [[Suramar]], then speak with [[Valtrois]].
*[[Elor'shan]]
*[[Kel'balor]]
*[[Ley Station Moonfall]]
*[[Ley Station Aethenar]]
*[[Falanaar Arcway]]
*[[Falanaar Depths]]
*[[Halls of the Eclipse]]
*Ask Valtrois to amplify the feed

==Description==
The [[arcan'dor]] is drawing incredible amounts of energy.

Even with the leyline feed at full capacity, we may not have the power.

Let us first ensure that all potential leyline conduits connecting to [[Shal'Aran]] are active.

Then I can attempt to amplify the output and hopefully satisfy this insufferable plant.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Free Floating Ley Spark]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
We must activate all of the leyline feeds in Suramar before attempting the spell.

==Completion==
We must take drastic measures.

==Notes==
Activating all the leyline feeds grants the achievement [[Leyline Bling]].

Once you have done so, or if you have done it already,

{{Gossip|''All conduits are active. Can you amplify the feed?''}}

: ''Valtrois works on the feed, an invisible, focused casting, and as she does so [[Valewalker Farodin]] and [[Thalyssra]] come down the south and north staircases respectively to the aperture.'' 
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Every leyline feed is active and at full power!}}
: ''Farodin voices grave concern.''
:{{Text|say|Valewalker Farodin|It is not enough...}}
: ''Valtrois turns away from the aperture to Thalyssra when she's addressed.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Valtrois, can you think of any way to draw more power? Even briefly?}}
: ''Valtrois walks as she thinks out loud. Thalyssra trails after her, and Farodin walks towards them...''
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Hmm... The main conduit beneath [[Suramar City|Suramar city]] pulls ten times what we have here.}}
: ''...and the three end up in front of the large conduit marker for Suramar City.  Thalyssra turns to Valtrois.''
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|If that leyline were to flare up, the surge could theoretically reach all the way back to Shal'Aran.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|What could make the leyline flare up?}}
: ''[[Oculeth]] [[teleport]]s down to join the discussion.''
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|A [[manastorm]] might do the trick.}}
: ''Valtrois turns to him.''
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|A manastorm, are you insane?}}
: ''Valtrois is skeptical, but Oculeth is being realistic.''
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Yes. But it could work! We create a localized warp field, then-}}
: ''Before he can get too carried away, Thalyssra quickly interrupts him.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Spare us the details, just make it happen. I am counting on you.}}
: ''Valtrois briefly turns to Thalyssra as she and Oculeth acknowledge their assignments.''
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Yes, ma'am!}}
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Right away.}}
: ''Farodin returns upstairs.''
