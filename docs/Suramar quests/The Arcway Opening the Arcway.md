==Objectives==
Slay Advisor Vandros in [[the Arcway]].
*[[Advisor Vandros]] slain

==Description==
Deep beneath [[Suramar]] is a defunct set of tunnels known as the Arcway.  They were abandoned when a disaster disrupted the [[mana]] collectors operating there.

I know not what awaits you down there, but I do know one thing.

We are not the only ones interested in this place.  Make enough noise and one of the advisors with whom I served under [[Elisande]] is sure to appear.

His name is Vandros.  Slay him, if you can.

His death will be our victory, as we deprive Elisande of one more weapon in her arsenal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|82|40}}
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Tome of Dimensional Awareness]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
Thank you.  It is one thing I no longer need to think about.

==Progression==
{{Statecraft}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
