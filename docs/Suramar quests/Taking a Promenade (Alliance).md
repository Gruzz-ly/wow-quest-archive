==Objectives==
Locate the scouts in the [[Grand Promenade (Suramar)|Promenade]].
* [[Sentinel Moonshade]] found
* [[Magus Sendath]] found

==Description==
[[Nightborne|These people]] are foreign to us, despite our common heritage. They have changed much in the years they have been cloistered away.

We need to learn more about them, what they are capable of. We dispatched one of our scouts to infiltrate the Promenade and assess the defenses. The [[Blood elf|blood elves]] did the same, although I doubt their ability to be discreet.

Both are long past due for reporting back to us. Find them and make sure they are safe or at least did not die in vain.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find them?

==Completion==
It is good to know that they are alive. Their knowledge will be valuable in the coming siege.

==Notes==
Upon finding Moonshade:

:{{Text|say|Magus Sendath|Over here, <race>. Try not to alert all the guards approach.}}
