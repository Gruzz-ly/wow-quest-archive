==Objectives==
Collect 5 Crystallized Bark.
*[[Crystallized Bark (Suramar)]] (5)
*Return to the [[Temple of Fal'adora]]
 
==Description==
In the hall beyond rests the bones of the failed [[arcan'dor]].

I will take fragments of the crystallized tree and attempt to read them.  We must discover the root cause of this destruction.

Only then do we have any hope of preventing this disaster from repeating itself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
Do you have the shards?

==Completion==
I will study these carefully. If we are fortunate, there will be answers.

==Notes==
