==Objectives==
Organize the camp.
* Tidy the Ransacked Crate
* Correct Toppled Bench
* Collect the Spilled Grain
* Right the Fallen Wagon

==Description==
Greetings, stranger.

<Mayruna bows to you.>

We arrived from [[Val'sharah|Val'Sharah]]{{sic}} a short time ago with hopes of settling here. Our journey was not easy and we are weary.

These [[owlcat]]s have made a mess of our camp, as you can surely see. Would you be so kind as to assist us with cleaning up?

Then perhaps you can help us establish a new [[moonwell]]!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|1|94}}
|Enchanted Nightborne Coin}}

==Progress==
Is everything in its proper place?

==Completion==
All is in its proper place. We are that much closer to being settled.

==Notes==
Tidying the Ransacked Crate:
:{{Text|say|Mayruna Moonwing|I fled Val'Sharah{{sic}} during [[Ysera]]'s attack on [[Temple of Elune (Val'sharah)|the temple]]. I was lucky enough to find [[Mythandros Irongrove|Mythandros]] on the road.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Mardranel Forestheart]]|We came from a village just outside [[Shala'nir]]. It was a narrow escape, I will admit.}}

Correcting Toppled Bench:
: ''[[Solendra Featherdown]] turns to you.''
:{{Text|say|Solendra Featherdown|The [[Emerald Nightmare|Nightmare]] followed us wherever we went. It was not until we crossed into [[Suramar]] that we escaped it.}}

Collecting the Spilled Grain:
: {{text|say|Val'sharah Refugee|There were more of us when we set out.  I would have died, if it were not for Mayruna's arrival.}}

Righting the Fallen Wagon:
:{{Text|say|Val'sharah Refugee|We owe our lives to Mythandros and his [[druid]] companions. We can call Suramar home, thanks to him.}}
: ''Mythandros Irongrove turns to you.''
:{{Text|say|Mythandros Irongrove|Thank you for your help, stranger. It means more than you know.}}
