==Objectives==
Return to [[Thalyssra]]

==Description==
There will be consequences for what has transpired this day.

For now, you should return to Thalyssra.  Tell her that we have avenged [[Margaux]] and that the [[Nightfallen (faction)|Dusk Lily]] has announced itself to all of [[Suramar]].

There will be many more deaths before this is over, rest assured, but this is a death that will teach others like [[Overseer Durant|Durant]] to tread more carefully in the future.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Completion==
It is a relief, if a small one. You have done well - rest for now.

==Notes==
This concludes the questline Blood and Wine of [[Good Suramaritan]]. The next questline, Statecraft, will be unlocked at 8,000 {{rep|Friendly}} [[reputation]].

==Progression==
{{Blood and Wine}}
