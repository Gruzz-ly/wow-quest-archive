==Objectives==
Locate Katarine, Fjolrik, and Stokalfr in [[Muddledeep Cavern]].
*[[Katarine]] rescued
*[[Fjolrik]] rescued
*[[Stokalfr]] rescued

==Description==
You are the one that [[Toryl]] was bellowing about? Perhaps you can help me.

When I set out to search for [[Jarl Throndyr|Throndyr]], I was not alone. Three [[vrykul]] loyal to Throndyr also accompanied me. As you can plainly see, I now stand alone.

Find my kin, <name>.

I cannot bear to think that they also share Throndyr's fate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Brand of a Blood Brother]]
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I must know what has befallen my kin.

==Completion==
My kin are safe. Let us see to these serpents!

==Notes==
===Katarine===
:''Katarine is locked in a cage by the naga.''
;Approach cage
: {{text|say|Katarine|I see that you are no ally to these naga, <race>!  Get me out of this cage!}}

;Freed
: {{text|say|Katarine|I must find Jarl Throndyr!}}

===Fjolrik===
:''Fjolrik lies in front of several cages.''
<The vrykul seems to be unconscious.>

{{gossip|Try to rouse the vrykul.}}
: ''The player gives Fjolrik a swift kick.''
: {{text|say|Fjolrik|Why did you kick me, you mongrel of Fenrir?}}
: {{text|say|Fjolrik|You are no naga!  Where is Brandolf?}}
: ''Fjolrik runs off.''

===Stokalfr===
;Approach
:''Stokalfir is free but cornered, surrounded by naga corpses.'' 
: {{text|yell|Stokalfr|Come closer if you want to die, naga!}}

: By the horns on my head, I will kill every last one of these naga!
''{{gossip|I am no naga, Stokalfr!  I come on behalf of Brandolf!}}''
: {{text|say|Stokalfr|Brandolf's alive!  I must go to him!}}


* Fjolrik's reference to "Fenrir" is likely meant to be for [[Fenryr]], who is based off on Fenrir from norse mythology.
