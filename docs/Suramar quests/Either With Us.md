==Objectives==
Speak to Lady [[Aurore]].

==Description==
[[Thalyssra]] asks much of me, but our cause is worth the risks.

The title of advisor would grant us enormous influence.  Information.  Access.

I could change [[Nightfallen rebellion|this rebellion]].  I could save so many lives.

I will need strong endorsement to ascend, though.  There are many houses who stand with me by virtue of my family's name.  Some are more hesitant.

Lady Aurore of House Astravar is the most prominent of these.  Seek her out.  Offer your aid in my stead.

Earn her trust and the rest will follow.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
I love [[Ly'leth Lunastre|Lady Lunastre]] like a sister, but I am afraid my hands are tied.

==Progression==
{{Statecraft}}

==Patch changes==
