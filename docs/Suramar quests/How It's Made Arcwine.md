==Notes==
: ''Margaux walks south towards a small building.''
: {{text|say|Margaux|The building we approach now is called the Aging Chamber.}}
: {{text|say|Margaux|If you are at all familiar with the wine crafting process, you know that it is necessary to allow the juice to ferment.}}
: ''She stops in front of it and turns to you.''
: {{text|say|Margaux|We prefer to shorten the process using time magic.  Such power is our birthright!}}


: <Margaux glances around anxiously before leaning in close to whisper to you.>

: [[Thalyssra]] must be alive, if others are moving in the shadows.  Who else but the First Arcanist could inspire such action?

: Tell me- how is she?

''{{gossip|She is surviving, but not easily.}}''

: I am so relieved to hear that.  Let us move on, though.

''{{gossip|After you, Margaux.}}''


: ''Margaux walks onward to the east.''
: {{text|say|Margaux|To my left you will see one of our orchards.}}
: ''She approaches an area of fruit trees floating above a shallow pool, vines hanging downward with a single fruit on the ends.  [[Moonglow Locust]]s around the trees are being preyed upon by [[Shadescale Flyeater]]s.
: {{text|say|Margaux|This one houses a species of tree that produces ''extra'' sweet fruit, which you tasted in the Infusion.}}
: ''She walks to the edge of the pool and turns to you.''


: Now... why exactly did you come here?  This is certainly one of the least safe places for members of [[Nightfallen (faction)|the resistance]].

''{{gossip|Thalyssra said you had a unique way of dealing with insects.  What is it?}}''

: Insects?  Do you have an insect problem?

: <Margaux eyes you curiously for a moment.>

: No matter.  The answer, you see, is in front of you.  [[Mana wyrm]]s prey on the insects that prey on our trees.  They keep our precious plants whole and they eat very well.

: I will be sure to make time in our tour to allow you to gather some.

''{{gossip|Thank you!  I am ready to move on now.}}''


: ''Margaux walks on to the southeast as she speaks.
: {{text|say|Margaux|The buildings before you house our bottling facilities.}}
: {{text|say|Margaux|Each bottle is sealed with magic to prevent any of the [[Nightwell]]'s essence from fading.}}
: ''She heads to pass on the right side of the building.''
: {{text|say|Margaux|A cask of arcwine from our vineyard can be safely stored for hundreds of years!}}
: {{text|say|Margaux|Ahead you will see our distribution facility.}}
: ''She stops at the entrance point and turns to you, beyond which massive barrels line the sides.''
: {{text|say|Margaux|Here we arrange to send hundreds of barrels and casks of arcwine out to the city.}}
: ''A female [[Vineyard Enforcer]] approaches a Vineyard Laborer who's standing still.  Margaux turns back to look toward the facility.''
: {{text|say|Margaux|The Magistrix monitors these activities very-}}
: ''She gasps in horror: the enforcer is confronting the laborer.''
: {{text|say|Vineyard Enforcer|You there!  Back to work!}}
: {{text|say|Vineyard Laborer|I was just resting.  I-}}
: {{text|say|Vineyard Enforcer|I will hear none of your excuses.  Back to work!}}
: ''The guard begins to viciously beat the man.  Margaux immediately runs over to intervene.''
: {{text|say|Margaux|''Don't hurt him!''}}
: {{text|say|Vineyard Laborer|Agh!}}
: ''The enforcer stops and turns to Margaux, who grovels an apology for her cowering staff member.''
: {{text|say|Margaux|I am so sorry- please forgive this mistake.  I will personally ensure it does not happen again.}}
: {{text|say|Vineyard Enforcer|[[Overseer Durant|The Overseer]] will hear of this.  Mark my words, Margaux.}}
: ''Margaux walks out of the distribution facility and the enforcer also turns away.  Margaux heads to a quiet corner of the building.


: They just -  I hate them!  We serve at their pleasure or we face exile and death.  But I can do nothing while the [[Elisande|Grand Magistrix]] seeks to keep this area secure.

: Surely you must have a vast network to have made your way here.  Is the resistance growing?  Can it truly stand against Elisande?

''{{gossip|Hope is not lost.  We are making progress every day.}}''

: <Margaux sighs.>

: The odds are stacked against us.  We are beaten and exiled at every turn.  But you and the First Arcanist still stand with us.  I can believe in this.

: I believe in the Dusk Lily.

: But enough of this.  Are you ready to finish our tour?

''{{gossip|I am ready.}}''


: {{text|say|Margaux|Where were we?}}
: ''Margaux walks back out around the front of the building and heads north to a bridge, across which is the other side of the small orchard earlier shown.''
: {{text|say|Margaux|Across this bridge is the most crucial part of our winemaking process.}}
: {{text|say|Margaux|It is here that we instill our wine with Nightwell essence, which gives it the restorative properties our people enjoy.}}
: ''She stops by the waiting [[Sylverin]] at the infusion station and turns to you.''
: {{text|say|Margaux|And this is where I leave you.  I must prepare the next activity.}}
: {{text|say|Margaux|I will meet you at the next station.  My assistant Sylverin will be happy to show you how the infusion process works.}}
: ''Margaux walks away over the bridge.''
