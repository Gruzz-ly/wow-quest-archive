==Objectives==
Feed the Fruit of the Arcan'dor to a [[Suramar Refugee]] in [[Shal'Aran]].
*Suramar Refugee cured
*[[Fruit of the Arcan'dor]] (provided)

==Description==
Given the events at the [[Waning Crescent]], the refugees here are more eager than ever to receive the gift of the [[arcan'dor]] and be free of the [[Nightwell]] forever.

Fortunately, the tree has borne more fruit.  Again, I ask that you honor us by giving this fruit to anyone here in Shal'Aran.

When you are finished, we shall discuss further developments within the city. [[Silgryn]] reports that [[Arluelle]] has proven a fine student, and the two are making progress in evacuating citizens.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
No matter what crises come up, we must stay the course and free my people from their [[Magic addiction|addiction]].

We take it one day at a time.

==Completion==
Good, now to set our attention to those still suffering within the city.

==Notes==
Offering the fruit to a [[Suramar Refugee]] or [[Suramar Orphan]] will prompt a random chat message.
