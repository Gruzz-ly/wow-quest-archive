'''Kel'danath's Legacy''' will complete the Arcanist Kel'danath portion of [[Nightfallen But Not Forgotten]].

==Objectives==
Use the [[Spellstone of Kel'danath]] to charm 5 [[withered]] and send them to [[Shal'Aran]].
* Withered charmed (5)

==Description==
[[Arcanist Kel'danath|Kel'danath]] discovered something incredible - the power to subdue and even control the withered.

I will pick up where my old friend left off. We shall see to it that he did not die in vain.

Perhaps in the end we can even find peace for the wretches who have been left to a fate worse than death.

I will need more subjects. Take Kel'danath's spellstone and use it to subdue more withered.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|Enchanted Nightborne Coin
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
We will need more subjects if we are to continue Kel'danath's research.

==Completion==
Fascinating.

Let us hope the spell holds.

==Notes==
''Accept:''
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|I shall prepare a holding area for the subjects while you are away.}}

At this point, if you haven't already, you should go back and finish the [[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]] storyline, starting with [[Oculeth's Workshop (quest)]].  The result of that questline will complement the next questline this quest leads into.

==Progression==
{{Arcanist Kel'danath}}
