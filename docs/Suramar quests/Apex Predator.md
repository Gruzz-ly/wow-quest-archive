==Objectives==
Find and slay the [[Nightborne]] keeping [[Su'esh]] obedient.
* [[Graedis Oenthar]] slain

==Description==
I have good news and bad news, <race>.

The bad news is that they somehow managed to capture and train a [[Devilsaur]].

The good news is that it doesn't seem to have a collar and is tame. I imagine it must think that one of the Nightborne in there is its master. Find the pack leader and take him out, and we will set quite a beast upon them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=|Enchanted Nightborne Coin

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find the alpha?

==Completion==
I saw everything from out here. That was... messy.

==Progression==
