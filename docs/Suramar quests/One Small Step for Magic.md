==Objectives==
Speak to [[Kyrtos]] and assist him with his ritual.
* Ritual completed

==Description==
It is time to embrace the future.

I have mastered every [[magic]] known to our kind. I will master this one.

By applying the principles of [[arcane]] magic it is fairly trivial to control the primitive [[fel]] energies within the material you have given me. I need to move to live prey next.

Let us start with a small summoning. Defeat the creature for me and watch how a true [[scholar]] works!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=|Scavenged Felstone
}}

==Completion==
Yes...

This power is... different. Brutal, blunt, powerful.

I can control it. I can master it!

==Progression==
{{Kyrtos' magic}}
