==Objectives==
Use [[Satyr Horn]]s to destroy 3 [[Darkfiend Totem]]s.
*Destroy Darkfiend Totems (3)

==Description==
I cannot, will not, accept what is happening here. My body resists me, but I will stop this.

<He looks at you.> You will stop this.

Here is a root of the corrupted [[World Tree]] [[Shaladrassil]]. It has somehow found its way out of the ground to this untouched place and already the Darkfiend [[satyr]]s are hard at work corrupting [[Suramar]].

Stop them. Kill the satyrs, take their horns, drive their points through the totems.

Only then can we have any hope of reversing this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Purified Satyr Totem]]

==Progress==
Have you stalled their efforts, <race>?

==Completion==
I am relieved, though there remains more we must do.

==Progression==
