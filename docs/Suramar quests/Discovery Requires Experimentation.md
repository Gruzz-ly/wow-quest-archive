==Objectives==
Collect 8 Felfire Spines from [[Felfire Basilisk]]s.
* [[Felfire Spine]] (8)

==Description==
I can sense residues of [[magic]] all over you. You will be useful.

I must study how the [[demon]] bodies can handle the [[fel]] energies in such large quantities. I have plenty of flesh to sample, but there must be something...

Go retrieve some spines from the nearby [[basilisk]]s so that I may analyze their magical residues. No sense in both of us getting our hands dirty, is there?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|19|40|}}

==Progress==
I hope you brought enough. I will require more energy before my studies are complete.

==Completion==
Fel magic is... strange. Almost slippery like an oil, and it burns long and hot. Maybe there's a connection...

==Gains==
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progression==
{{Kyrtos' magic}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
