==Objectives==
Feed the Fruit of the [[Arcan'dor]] to a [[Suramar Refugee]] in [[Shal'Aran]].
*Suramar Refugee cured
*[[Fruit of the Arcan'dor]] (provided)

==Description==
The arcan'dor bears fruit once again. Just in time, too - [[Ly'leth]] has sent us a message, and it seems she may have a lead on [[Vanthir]]. He is long overdue for this gift, assuming we manage to find him.

Give a fruit to another citizen here in Shal'Aran while I finish decrypting Ly'leth's message.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The message is almost ready.

==Completion==
There. I certainly hope Ly'leth has good news...

==Progression==
{{Waxing Crescent}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.1.0|note=Added.}}
