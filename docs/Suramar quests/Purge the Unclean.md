==Objectives==
Defeat the corruption in the [[Azurefall Guardian]].
*Cleanse the Corruption
*[[Cleansing Ritual Focus]] (provided)

==Description==
Do you feel it in the air, <race>? The stage is set for us to make things right.

While you were busy I was able to track down the elder [[elemental]] that rules these waters. Its name is the Azurefall Guardian and it resides within the channels below [[Tel'anor]].

Take the ritual focus, it should help you during the battle.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=|Azurefall Essence
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is done. Already I can feel the corrupting presence washing away.

Thank you, <name>. You have done this place a great service.

==Notes==
Attack the mob until the quest item is usable, then kill [[Congealed Corruption]]. The water elemental cannot be killed.
