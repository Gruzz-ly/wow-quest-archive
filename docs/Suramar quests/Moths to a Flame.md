==Objectives==
Collect 4 [[Underglow Locust]]s.
*Locusts Collected (4)

==Description==
No doubt you have noticed our guests.

I have watched them for a time and seen how they are attracted to the tree.  I do not know if they are harmful to our sapling, but we cannot take that chance.

Collect a handful of the insects and bring them to me.  I will examine them and determine if they are to be left alone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|20|60}}
*16,870 [[XP]]
*+20 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
Have you acquired a sufficient sampling?

==Completion==
Hmm, yes. It is as I suspected.
