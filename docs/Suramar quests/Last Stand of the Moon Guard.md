==Objectives==
Leave [[Moon Guard Stronghold]] with [[Thalrenus Rivertree|Thalrenus]], [[Lothrius Mooncaller|Lothrius]], and [[Syrana Starweaver|Syrana]].
* Abandon the Stronghold

==Description==
This is all that remains of the [[Moon Guard]].

Take a good look.

We are but a shadow of our former selves, and we have the [[Nightborne]] to thank for our demise.

For now there is nothing more we can do.  If we want to live, we must leave immediately.

Retribution can wait.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Moon Guard Power Gem]]

== Progress ==
What happened to the Moon Guard?

==Completion==
I called them here.  I will see that they are taken care of after the horrors my people put them through.

==Notes==
Before taking or completing the quest, go to the [[Unpowered Telemancy Beacon]] and complete [[Moon Guard Teleporter Online!]]  This will be your only opportunity to conveniently get it.


Let's get out of here!
