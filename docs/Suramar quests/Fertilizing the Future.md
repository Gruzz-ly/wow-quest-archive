==Objectives==
Plant 5 [[Lush Grass Seed]]s in piles of Rich Soil.
* Lush Grass Seeds Planted (5)

==Description==
Like most herbivores, our antlered friends will eat anything green enough to chew.

However I have noticed that they seek these patches of dark grass, given their preference. I believe we can begin to earn their favor if we aid the forest in producing more of this most nutritious of stag food.

I will provide you with the seeds- all you must do is locate suitable growing soil and plant them. Our magic will do the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How goes the planting?

==Completion==
They are looking better fed already!
