==Objectives==
Retrieve 6 Arcane Glowlamps.
*[[Arcane Glowlamp]] (6)

==Description==
Now that the shield is down, the older settlements outside [[Suramar City|the city]] have been on my mind.

Did you know that I helped create the filigree on the [[arcane]] lamps that are used throughout the city? A simple task, one of my first...

No matter. Nostalgia is the enemy of progress. The lamps are made of material better used in my new works.

Those wretched [[harpy|harpies]] probably have several decorating their nests. Bring back any you find.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=|Everburning Arcane Glowlamp
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Can you imagine, a Lespin original hiding under a pile of leaves? What a waste.

==Completion==
Excellent. I shall have these melted down and turned into ingots for my next batch of commissions.

==Progression==
{{An Artisan's Mark}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
