==Objectives==
Send champions on missions to investigate the hunt.
* [[List of Invited Nobles]]
* [[Fox Hunt Invitation]]
* [[First Half of the Map]]
* [[Second Half of the Map]]

==Description==
The invitation appears to be for an exclusive [[fox]] hunt. They plan to hunt [[Volpin]], a rare, elusive fox somewhere in the [[Broken Isles]]. Perhaps we can take advantage of this?

We need to gather more information about this hunt, but we should do so without alerting the [[Nightborne]] to your plans. Your champions can act in your stead and further investigate where the hunt will be.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have your champions discovered anything about the fox hunt?

==Completion==
Yes, its all here, the location of the hunt for Volpin. 

I'm sure there are better uses for a wonderful creature such as he than a pelt on some Noble's shoulders, don't you agree?

==Notes==
The items are obtained from four successive missions:
#[[On the Hunt (mission)]] - [[List of Invited Nobles]]
#[[Securing an Invitation]] - [[Fox Hunt Invitation]]
#[[All Dressed Up]] - [[First Half of the Map]]
#[[Just in Time (mission)]] - [[Second Half of the Map]]

==Progression==
*[[A "Noble" Event]]
**[[Volpin the Elusive (quest)]]
