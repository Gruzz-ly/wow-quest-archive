==Objectives==
Purchase a [[:Shal'dorei Mannequin]] from [[Leyweaver Mithrogane]], then craft an entire set of silkweave armor and place them on the mannequin.
* [[Silkweave Set]]

==Description==
While [[Leyweaver Tytallo‎|Tytallo]] is busy exacting [[withered]] genocide, it falls on me to take care of the more mundane aspects of training.

We're going to need to see how talented you are.

Craft an entire set of silkweave armor for me. Leyweaver Mithrogane can provide you with a proper mannequin for displaying it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If you wish to learn what we're about to teach you, you need a solid foundation.

==Completion==
Your stitching is still a little rough, but you've already mastered all of the basics.

Well done.

I don't say that very often. Savor it.
