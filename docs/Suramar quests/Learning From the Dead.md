==Objectives==
Recover 5 Books of Tactics from [[Black Rook Hold]] in [[Val'sharah]].
*[[Book of Tactics]] (5)

==Description==
I heard you were traveling to Black Rook Hold.

It was once home to the legendary [[Kur'talos Ravencrest|Lord Ravencrest]], a brilliant tactician. His knowledge may be exactly what we need to give us an edge against the Duskwatch.

While you are at the Rook, keep your eyes peeled for any books that might have survived the ages that outline the Ravencrest's strategems.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
How goes the search?

==Completion==
Excellent. The knowledge in these books should prove very useful in the days to come.

==Notes==
Pick up all three available quests, then mount [[Dusktalon]] to fly directly to the outdoor Black Rook Hold area. They do not involve entering the instance.

The books have different titles, but any 5, including duplicates, will reward a [[Book of Tactics]]. Some possible titles of the objects include:
{{columns|2|
*''[[Jungle Warfare: The Troll Problem]]''
*''[[The Raven's Prey]]''
*''[[The Rook's Gambit]]''
*''[[Spellbreaking, the Art of Shieldbashing]]''
*''[[Voodoo, Geomancy, and the Magic of Peasants]]''
*''[[Zandalari - The True Enemy]]''
}}

==Progression==
{{Crafting War}}
