==Objectives==
Collect 8 Sashj'tar Fangs from [[Sashj'tar]] [[naga]] in [[Azuregale Bay]].
*[[Sashj'tar Fang]] (8)

==Description==
If I had been by [[Jarl Throndyr|Throndyr]]'s side when he fought the naga, he might still be alive.

These serpents will regret the day that they decided to slither from their watery hole!

Killing them is not enough. No! I will honor Throndyr with a necklace of naga fangs!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We will slay them all!

==Completion==
I will wear this in honor of Throndyr!

==Progression==
{{Jandvik's Jarl}}
