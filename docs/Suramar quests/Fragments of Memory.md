While on the quest [[Tools of the Trade]] you can find [[Shattered Burial Urn]] to start this side-quest.

==Objectives==
Retrieve 15 Tel'anor Mementos.
*[[Tel'anor Memento]] (15)

==Description==
<The beautiful [[night elf|elven]] burial urn is shattered carelessly on the ground. It was clearly handled roughly, but not scratched by the talons of the [[harpies]].>

<You find a trail of shards leading towards a cave. Those responsible are certainly within. Thaedris would be interested in the relics and their safe return.>

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=|Tel'anor Ancestral Tablet
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What do you have there?

==Completion==
These relics are tokens and mementos of the former lives of those interred here. They like to be remembered and these offerings keep them in their eternal peace.

The spirits of the fallen will be at rest now. You have my gratitude.
