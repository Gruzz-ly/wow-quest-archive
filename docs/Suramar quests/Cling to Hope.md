==Objectives==
Deliver a letter to Absolon's Wife, [[Noressa]].

* [[Absolon's Letter]] (provided)

==Description==
Your kindness has inspired me, friend.

I thought I would wander forever among the empty husks of the [[Withered]], but [[First Arcanist Thalyssra|Thalyssra]] invited me in.

I have chosen to remain here with my people and together we will take back [[Suramar]].

For now I have but one request.

Take this letter to my wife. She should know that I still live, among other things.

Give her the hope that you gave me.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
<Noressa eyes you suspiciously.> 

==Completion==
[[Absolon]]... is alive? 

==Gains==
* +150 reputation with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Notes==
Noressa can be found in front of a bench on the outskirts of [[Suramar City]], near the main gate to the city.
