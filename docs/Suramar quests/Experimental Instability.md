==Objectives==
Gather the Telemancy Notes and 1 Discarded Orbs from [[Oculeth's Test Chamber]].
*Take the Portal to Oculeth's Test Chamber
*Telemancy Notes
*Discarded Orbs (4)
*Take the Portal to [[Shal'Aran]]

==Description==
In order to advance our studies I must ask you to recover a few particular items from my long-forgotten chambers.

I assure you it is... mostly safe there, aside from a few unstable elements.

Make your way to my workshop and locate the teleporter. I'll disable it's cloaking device when you arrive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Entangled Telemancy Orb]]

==Progress==
Scavenging going well? Not too dangerous I hope.

==Completion==
Wonderful! Now the fun begins. You should speak with [[First Arcanist Thalyssra|Thalyssra]]. I believe she is ready for more... testing.

==Notes==
Take the teleporter to the [[Ruins of Elune'eth]] and head east to [[Oculeth's Workshop]], where you first met [[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]]. There will be an active teleporter pad inside the ruined main building.

The orbs can be found laying around on the ground or short tables, while the Telemancy Notes are inside an open chest filled with books. Once you have picked up everything, there is a portal back to Shal'Aran past those books on your right.
