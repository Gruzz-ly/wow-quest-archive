==Objectives==
Find the Broken Leydar Dish and repair the leyline feed.
* [[Broken Leydar Dish]]
* Collect: [[Ancient Mana]] (200)

==Description==
<This leyline feed appears to be damaged. The large collector at the top is broken.

The broken piece must be around here somewhere. There are rough scuff marks on the floor that appear to be made by something larger than the creatures inside.

Much, much larger.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Ancient Workshop Focusing Crystal]]

==Progress==
<The feed pulses softly.>

==Completion==
<As you place the broken piece onto the pillar and begin infusing it with mana, arcane energy begins to repair the break. It slowly begins to turn as the leyline is activated.>

==Notes==
*Despite the quest text, there are no obvious scuff marks on the floor leading to the required [[Broken Leydar Dish]]. The quest guidance on the minimap highlights the leyline feed location, so it may not be obvious at first that the large creature is outside the ley station entirely. Once outdoors again, the quest guidance is more clear where to find the creature that took the dish, who turns out to be [[Thudchop Trunksmasher]], an elite [[ettin]].
*This activates the leyline feed at [[Ley Station Moonfall]]. Activating all of these feeds is required for [[Giving It All We've Got]] and for the [[Leyline Bling]] achievement.

==Progression==
