==Objectives==
Collect 6 Fresh Fel-Flesh.
* [[Fresh Fel-Flesh]] (6)

==Description==
This crater is infested with [[Felfire Basilisk|felfire basilisks]].

They may not be the most cunning of creatures, but they are as vile and dangerous as any [[demon]].

However, they may yet prove useful to us. Slay the basilisks, but return to me with chunks of their fel-infused flesh.

I have plans to make use of their freshly carved flesh...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the Fresh Fel-Flesh I require?

==Completion==
I see that you have returned with the freshly carved remains of the fel basilisks.

Listen closely, and I will explain the purpose behind retrieving them...

==Progression==
{{Breaking The Lightbreaker‎}}

==Patch changes==
