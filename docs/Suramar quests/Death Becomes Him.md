==Objectives==
Slay Ruven Duskmere.
*[[Ruven]] slain

==Description==
There are two houses that pose a threat to [[Ly'leth]]'s rise, but we concern ourselves with only one of them now.

[[House Duskmere]] commands respect through fear and that fear is not unfounded.  Few can boast of magical talent equal to that of Ruven Duskmere.

Without this charming specimen, however, their house is nothing.

I know you may find my methods distasteful.  Know that there were demons in [[Suramar City|Suramar]] long before the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].

This one has lived long enough.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Corrupted Duskmere Crest]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
It seemed as though you had that well in hand. I did not want to... interrupt.

That is one less power hoarding noble to worry about. Well done, <name>.

==Progression==
{{Statecraft}}
