==Objectives==
Assist [[Kyrtos]] with his ritual.
* Ritual Complete
* Report to [[Thalyssra]]

==Description==
I have had it with these small fry, assistant. Time to go straight to the top.

The tome is the key! The key to unlocking the potential within our people.

Do not worry, young one. I have enough power to complete the task at hand. Let us harness [[fel]] magic and change the future.

Follow me and witness the redemption of the [[shal'dorei]]!

You reek of [[demon]]s, <name>.  What happened?

Kyrtos, you old fool! You should have known the risks...

* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Notes==
: ''The other end of the portal is an exposed, isolated platform which is the bottom/rear portion of the ''[[Lightbreaker]]'', the command [[Legion ship]] of [[Felsoul Hold]].''
: {{text|say|Kyrtos|Ah, you are here.  All is ready.}}

''{{gossip|I am ready to begin the ritual.}}''
: ''Kyrtos begins hovering.''
: {{text|say|Kyrtos|Be ready, assistant.  I shall begin drawing power from the ship's stores.}}
: ''As he rises to be about level with the three gems in the walls, a beam of fel energy is pulled directly into him from the one behind him.''
: ''After a few moments, he begins drawing energy from the gem to his right.  As it strikes him, the extra is thrown off in a shower of fel.  He speaks with drunken exhilaration.''
: {{text|say|Kyrtos|So much power!  I can handle it!  I can take more!}}
: ''He begins drawing energy from the gem to his left.  A shield of molten fel forms around him.  One by one, the beams disengage.''
: {{text|say|Kyrtos|Ah, so that is the key.  MORE!  ''MORE!''}}
: ''The shield dissipates, reveling Kyrtos as a [[Felborne]].  He returns to the floor.''
: {{text|say|Kyrtos|Ahh, much better.  I have all the power I could want.}}
: ''Kyrtos speaks with a deeper, almost growling demonic tone.  He then suddenly attacks without warning.''
: {{text|say|Kyrtos|Yet I still crave more.  Your soul will do nicely!}}
: ''Once Kyrtos is killed, a Legion Portal opens up at the center of the platform, leading back to the [[Den of the Demented]].''
