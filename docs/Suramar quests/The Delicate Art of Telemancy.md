==Objectives==
Collect the Weathered Telemancy Beacon and Cracked Warpsleeve from [[Oculeth's Workshop]]. 
*Use teleporter at Oculeth's Workshop
*[[Weathered Telemancy Beacon]]
*[[Cracked Warpsleeve]]

==Description==
I hadn't the time to gather my instruments before fleeing the palace.  I came here to salvage some equipment.

This old workshop is actually several rooms connected by teleporter pads.

[[Elisande]]'s goons are already scouring the place looking for me, but from here I can alter the teleporter network and keep them moving in circles.

You go in. I'll monitor your position and ensure the teleporters work normally for you.

Find these two parts and bring them back!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:|Enchanted Nightborne Coin}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
Salvaging the equipment here is necessary if I am to develop a teleporter network for [[Thalyssra]].

==Completion==
These are in rough shape, but they will suffice.

==Notes==
[[File:The-Delicate-Art-of-Telemancy.svg|thumb|teleporter connectivity]]
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|The teleporter is just outside. Activate it first, then step on the pad.}}

Each teleporter consists of a circular floor with one or more small labeled towers around the perimeter, which, when interacted with, project a beam to the central pad. Stepping on the pad while the beam is active will then teleport you to the location labeled.

Upon activating the first teleporter:
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|All of the teleporters work the same way. Use them to find that equipment.}}

The two items can be acquired in any order. The network of teleporters needed is:

* Garden
** Warp Lab ([[Cracked Warpsleeve]])
** Fountain
*** Telemetry Lab ([[Weathered Telemancy Beacon]])

If you try to teleport yourself to the Library, you'll end up in [[The Drift]]:
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Something is wrong... I have lost your position...}}
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Wherever you are, it is unstable. The telemancy will not hold long.}}
:''You get teleported back to the Workshop.''
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|A curious discovery, but you will not find the equipment we need in there.}}

If you try to teleport yourself to the Breakfast Nook, you'll end up at [[The Gilded Market]]{{coords|55.29|64.15|Suramar}} in [[Suramar City]]: only hundreds of feet above it!  Fortunately, Oculeth is quick on the draw.
: {{text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Strange.  It should not have sent you there!  Hang on, I am recalling you.}}
: ''You are plucked out of the sky mid-fall and teleported back to the Garden.''
: {{text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Someone else is tampering with the network...  Telemancy is a delicate art, there is no room for amateurs!}}

Upon collecting both items:
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Good work. Bring them back to me at the workshop!}}
