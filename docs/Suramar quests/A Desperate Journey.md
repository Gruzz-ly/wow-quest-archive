*First area scouted
*Second area scouted
*Find Astoril

==Description==
The [[Suramar City|city]]'s entrances are under heavy guard. He must have another way.

Thanks to this wine I am strong enough to make the journey to him. I fear that I will not be able to defend or run if I come under attack.

You will accompany me, <race>. You and this Astoril are my only chance at surviving now. 

I remember when I was leaving the city that there were lamps guiding me here. We should be able to retrace our steps by following them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Iadreth's Enchanted Birthstone]]

==Progress==
I was worried something had happened to you in the forest. I am glad that I was wrong.

==Completion==
Excellent. Your part here is done.

Rest assured knowing that you have done me a great service.

Here, take this payment. It is a small token for your service.
