Collect the Shard of Kozak.
* [[Shard of Kozak (quest item)]]

==Description==
The [[demon]] leading the operation in [[Felsoul Hold]] is an [[eredar]] named [[Azoran]]. In order to get to him, we will need to open a portal to the [[Burning Legion]] [[command ship]].

Azoran has a demon [[Jailer (demon)|jailer]] in his service known as [[Kozak the Afflictor]].

Kozak the Afflictor holds one of the key shards necessary to open a portal to the ship. He can be found in the prison quarters known as the [[Halls of the Eclipse]] in the lower portion of Felsoul Hold.

Slay Kozak and place his key shard next to the portal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|38|80|}}
*20,560 [[XP]]
*[[Shard of Kozak]]

==Progress==
<The Shard of Kozak tugs as if it wants to fly into place.>

==Completion==
<The Shard of Kozak locks into position next to the portal. You can feel the dark writhing of [[fel]] energy surround you as it collects near the portal.>

==Notes==
''Both shards placed:''
: ''The Legion Portal spawns and so does Lyana just inside the room.  She walks up to it.''
: {{text|say|Lyana Darksorrow|Now that the portal has been opened, the path to Azoran is clear.}}
