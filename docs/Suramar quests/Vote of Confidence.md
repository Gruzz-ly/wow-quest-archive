==Objectives==
Return to [[Ly'leth Lunastre|Ly'leth]] at the [[Waning Crescent]].

==Description==
I will endeavor to protect [[Ailen Astravar|my son]] until the votes are cast.

[[Coryn|Coryn Stelleris]] is a predator even among the nobility.  It does not surprise me that he should stoop to such depths to ensure his own success.

Tell Ly'leth that she has my support.  Unequivocally.

You may also choose to tell her that Coryn Stelleris will hurt her, if she gives him a chance.

Be careful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
I know of Coryn. We will not underestimate his venom, rest assured.

Thank you for helping [[Aurore]]. She is a dear friend of mine.

==Progression==
