==Objectives==
Defend [[Arluin]]'s stash from the city guards.
*Grapple to the stash location
*[[Auditor Yvenne]] slain

==Description==
With the [[demon]]s and guards so agitated, I'm running out of safe places to store contraband.  The guards have caught on to one of my favorite havens and will be making off with my goods any minute now.

Head to my stash and discourage their curiosity.  You will need to use a [[Stormforged Grapple Launcher|grappling hook]] to access it- just look for something to latch onto along the ledge.

I will make sure there is something in it for you when you are done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|20|60}}
*16,870 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[['Borrowed' Highborne Magi's Chalice]]

==Progress==
Did you deter them yet?

==Completion==
You're becoming quite the dependable associate.

==Notes==
