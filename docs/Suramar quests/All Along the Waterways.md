==Objectives==
Slay 3 Duskwatch Orbitists.
*[[Duskwatch Orbitist]] slain (3)

==Description==
I've noticed some wandering eyes, lately.

I am more than happy to continue delivering the goods to [[Vanthir]], but it is getting increasingly dangerous to do so.

The [[Duskwatch]] that walk the bazaar are by far the most observant.

Find and slay the Orbitists so that I may deliver the goods safely.

I will follow behind with the shipment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Key to the Bazaar]]
*{{cost|20|60}}
*16,870 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
What of Deline?

==Completion==
Deline was able to deliver the goods safely, thanks to you.

==Notes==
: ''On returning to Vanthir, there is a queue of citizens that he is doling out portions of arcwine to, from the trio stack of casks beside him.  He kindly offers his encouragement.''
