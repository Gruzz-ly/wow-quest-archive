==Objectives==
Meet with [[Khadgar]] in [[Suramar]].
* Meet with Khadgar in Suramar.

==Description==
I am glad you are here, <name>.

This... Khadgar, the archmage who found my message, has called a meeting.

He wishes to meet us by the entrance to the city as soon as possible.

Will you accompany me? I have the strangest feeling that he will not be alone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*12,340 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Hello again, champion. I see we are all here now.

==Notes==
In [[Meredil]], near the [[Suramar City]] border, Khadgar has newly arrived with [[Kirin Tor Peacekeeper]]s. On the eastern side of the road, [[Tyrande Whisperwind]] is present, accompanied by [[Vereesa Windrunner]] plus [[Sentinel]]s and [[Silver Covenant]] forces. On the western side, [[Lady Liadrin]] is accompanied by [[Grand Magister Rommath]] and [[Blood Knight]] forces.

;Tyrande Whisperwind
When I let you take the [[Tears of Elune]], I assumed the next time we would see each other would be at the final battle with the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].

I did not expect to see you in the company of mana addicts at the footsteps of the city of my birth.

Speak quickly, <race>. I am not in the mood for Thalyssra's petitions.

;Vereesa Windrunner
For the record, I counseled against trusting any [[Horde]] in this campaign. I have lost a [[Rhonin|husband]] and a [[Varian Wrynn|King]] to the treachery of the Horde.

I see no reason to trust you now or ever.

;Horde leaders
;Lady Liadrin
Few understand the plight of the [[Nightfallen]] better than the Sin'dorei. My heart goes out to them.

But Thalyssra must understand that there is a difference between an insurrection and a war.

Until now, her rebels have got by with a few skirmishes here and there. But they have not been hardened by battle as we [[Blood elf|blood elves]] have.

;Grand Magister Rommath
The [[Nightwell]]. An unimaginable font of arcane power. What would have happened to the sin'dorei if we had such a source?...

No matter. We have forged our own destiny. Our glory is our own, and we are no longer slaves to our hungers.

This siege is a momentous occasion, <name>. We stand with long-lost kin, our enemies, against some of the most powerful magi in the [[Azeroth|world]]. Our actions will determine the future of all elf-kind.

:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|I understand the struggles of the Nightfallen echo our own, First Arcanist. Addiction.... [[Kael'thas Sunstrider|betrayal]]...}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|There is a cure for our addiction, but it will take time to administer it to all of our people. First we must depose [[Elisande]] and cleanse Suramar of the Legion's filth.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|Cleanse it we shall. The sin'dorei bring righteous fury upon our enemies.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|And the [[shal'dorei]] are stronger than you expect. When the time comes, we will fight beside you.}}
:{{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Thalyssra, your knowledge of the enemy will be crucial in the battle ahead. We shall call on you as needed.}}
