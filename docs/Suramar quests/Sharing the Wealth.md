'''Sharing the Wealth''' is a rare [[World Quest]] in [[Suramar]].

==Objectives==
{{item|Bottle of Arcwine|Bottles of Arcwine}} Delivered to [[Deline]] (20)

==Description==
: ''[[Vanthir]] sighs.''
: {{text|say|Vanthir|Without more [[arcwine]], many citizens will [[Withered|wither]] right here in the city.  Find what you can and I will see that they are cared for.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,650 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
: {{text|say|Vanthir|I can save a lot of people with this arcwine.  For many it makes all the difference.}}

==Notes==
Bottles and casks of arcwine are scattered all over [[Evermoon Bazaar]]. Each cask is worth 10 bottles for quest credit, but you need to deliver it to the gondola on your back; it slows down your movement and makes you unable to mount while you're carrying it, so watch out for guards!

Gathered bottles count right away and do not need to be turned in.

Note that if you have the Legionfall buff to interact with things while mounted, that will prevent you from getting a cask buff, and the cask in question will be wasted.

If you like, you can also grab ten bottles and then a cask for one turn in.

Whenever you inform [[Deline]] that you have a cask:

''{{gossip|I found a cask of wine!}}''
: {{text|say|Deline|Ah! This cask contains a large amount of arcwine. Go ahead and put it into the gondola.}}

Even if it is a world quest, it still has the following description in [[Wowhead]]: 
: Lately there have been a disturbing array of changes involving our most precious resource, [[Arcwine]]. I imagine [[Thalyssra]] has thoroughly educated you about what happens when a [[Nightborne]] does not have access to a source of power like Arcwine. With the presence of the [[demon]]s came rationing. There are many who do not have enough to sustain themselves. Bring me as much Arcwine as you can carry. I will see that it gets to the right people.
