==Objectives==
Deliver plans to [[Vereesa Windrunner]], [[Lady Liadrin]] and [[Tyrande Whisperwind]].
* Speak to Vereesa Windrunner
* Speak to Tyrande Whisperwind
* Speak to Lady Liadrin

==Description==
Thanks to your efforts and a lot of effort on the part of our new army, the [[Nightfallen]] are prepared for battle.

What is more, we have managed to evacuate nearly all of the civilians between here and [[Astravar Harbor]].

I have drafted plans that can lead our combined forces through the city and take the harbor.

Can you deliver these plans to Vereesa, Tyrande and Liadrin?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
So many different types of elves. Each of us changed in some way by the magic we wield. It is very, enlightening.

==Completion==
Well, with these plans and a little luck, we might be able to get through this with far less collateral damage than I would have expected.

==Notes==
Each of three leaders will have a new dialogue option:

:{{Gossip|Plans from [[Thalyssra]].}}
:{{Text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|Good. We do not have the numbers to hold this place for long. The sooner we press on the better.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|So the time has come to march an army upon the city of my birth. May [[Elune]] grant us a quick end to this conflict.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|The rebels are ready for battle? Impressive. Let us see what they can do.}}

==Progression==
{{March on Suramar}}
