==Objectives==
Slay 8 Suramar Snarlers and Gloomfang.
*[[Suramar Snarler]] slain (8)
*[[Gloomfang]] slain

==Description==
Now, <name>, do not mistake me- I am a [[druid]]. I understand that nature has a balance.

Predators must feed, and others will be hunted. I also understand that tampering with such balance has consequences.

That is why I have taken upon myself to walk this land and perform some... ah... calculations.

Slay only a small number of the wolves you find, and one alpha. That should reduce their number enough to allow the Sablehorn to thrive without disrupting the flow of things here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Crystallized Sablehorn Antler]]

==Progress==
Are you being gentle with your pruning?

==Completion==
In the end, they will all thrive- for with more Sablehorn, the wolves will eat better in the years to come.
