==Objectives==
Speak with [[Arcanist Valtrois]] in [[Shal'Aran]].

==Description==
We have rescued many refugees, as you can see. Unfortunately this has revealed a new problem.

The [[arcan'dor]] fruit is our salvation, but it does not bear enough fruit right now to cure everyone. We must rely on mana a little longer to tide the refugees over.

Valtrois thinks that she may have a solution. Please go speak with her and see what she plans to do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is good to see you. I could use a helping hand.

==Notes==
Downstairs, [[Oculeth]] has joined with Valtrois.

==Progression==
{{Crafting War}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.1.0|note=Added.}}
