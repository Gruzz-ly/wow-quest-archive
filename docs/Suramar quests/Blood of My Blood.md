==Objectives==
Defeat [[Anarys Lunastre]] and deliver <him/her> to [[Ly'leth Lunastre]].
*[[Lunastre Memorial]] inspected
*Anarys Lunastre defeated
*Anarys delivered to Ly'leth

==Description==
As my darling <brother/sister> has demonstrated, [[Elisande]]'s decision to bring down the shield has sown unrest among the [[nightborne]].

Loyalists and demons march together in the streets. Fear and distrust grip our hearts. Family turns against family.

I will help [[Thalyssra]] stir a new rebellion, but first we must deal with Anarys.

I do not wish to spill the blood of my blood - only to help <him/her> see reason.

Anarys is likely brooding over our father's memorial. Bring <him/her> to me alive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Mark of Lunastre]]

==Progress==
Anarys could halt our efforts before they begin.

==Completion==
Thank you. Now our work can begin.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Ly'leth Lunastre|Our father's memorial is just around the corner. I am sure you will find Anarys nearby.}}

The [[Lunastre Memorial]] says:

{{Book|content=[[Ran'thos Lunastre]]

Head of House Lunastre. Father of Ly'leth and Anarys.

Died in honorable service to Grand Magistrix Elisande.}}

Upon inspecting it, Anarys attacks.
:{{Text|yell|Anarys Lunastre|Get away from there!}}
:{{Text|yell|Anarys Lunastre|You have come to help Ly'leth destroy our family! Be gone!}}

Upon defeating Anarys:
:{{Text|say|Anarys Lunastre|Ngh! Who ARE you?!}}

Talk to Anarys.

:Just... finish me off.
{{Gossip|''Come with me. Ly'leth wants to speak with you.}}
:{{Text|say|Anarys Lunastre|She wants to preach her traitorous ideals to me further? Fine. Let us go.}}

Upon delivering Anarys to Ly'leth:
:{{Text|say|Ly'leth Lunastre|An'anora!}}
:''Ly'leth encases Anarys in magical chains.''
:{{Text|say|Anarys Lunastre|Hmph... Someone will notice I am missing! They will come looking for me!}}
:{{Text|say|Ly'leth Lunastre|True. You will have to make an appearance.}}
