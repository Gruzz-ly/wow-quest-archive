==Objectives==
Give the First Arcanist's Token to [[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]].
*Token shown to Oculeth
*[[First Arcanist's Token]] (provided)

==Description==
We need to make contact with Chief Telemancer Oculeth, the man who developed [[Suramar]]'s teleportation network.

Oculeth had a workshop in old Suramar, from the age before the [[Great Sundering|Sundering]].  He may be taking refuge there.

<Thalyssra presses a small coin into your palm.>

If you find him, show him this.  Hopefully you see him before he sees you...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16450 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
You may deliver me to [[Thalyssra]] once my work here is complete.

==Notes==
You will likely have to skirt the northern edges of [[Suramar City]] to get to Oculeth's workshop, along the border of the [[Grand Promenade]]. Avoid the guards!

Upon entering the quest location, you are suspended in the air in an arcane bubble, slowly drifting upwards.

:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|That is far enough.}}
:''Oculeth emerges from the side room and approaches you.''
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Well, you are not from the [[Nighthold|palace]]... and you are no demon, at least not entirely.}}
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Identify yourself, before I teleport you to the depths of the [[Great Sea]].}}

The extra action button's cooldown passes, allowing you to use the [[First Arcanist's Token]]. If you wait about 15 seconds without using the extra action button, Oculeth will in fact teleport you to the bottom of the sea at the city outskirts, so best do as he asks and show the token to him!

Being teleported to the sea:
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|I did warn you. Tel'vasha!}}

Using the token:
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|What is this? A coin...}}
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|The sign of the dusk lily... This is the [[First Arcanist Thalyssra|First Arcanist]]'s seal! Is she alive?!}}
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Then there is still a chance... Come quickly! I need your help.}}
:''Oculeth hurries away, but quickly returns.''
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Right. The trap.}}
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|N'eth ana!}}

Oculeth dispels the trap. Turn in the quest to him.
