==Objectives==
Speak with [[Victoire]] in [[Meredil]].

==Description==
The [[Nightfallen rebellion]] is growing in number, but they have not fought a real war in ages.

[[Victoire]] and [[Silgryn]] are doing their best to train the new arrivals, but could use an experienced hand.

Go to them and show them some of the skills in battle you have picked up in your travels. I want those Nightfallen ready for battle when the time comes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
Every member of the [[Duskwatch]] has had centuries to perfect their fighting techniques. We do not have that much time to get these rebels in to{{Sic}} fighting shape.

==Progression==
{{Crafting War}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.1.0|note=Added.}}
