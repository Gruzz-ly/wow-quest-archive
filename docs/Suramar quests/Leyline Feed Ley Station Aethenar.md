==Objectives==
Collect 6 Leyline Feed Fragments and infuse the feed with ancient mana.
* [[Leyline Feed Fragment]] (6)
* Collect: [[Ancient Mana]] (200)

==Description==
<This [[leyline]] appears to be damaged and needs repair.

Several large chunks of the main column are missing and [[arcane]] energy is crackling in the gaps.

The [[elemental]]s nearby seem to pick up debris and absorb it into their bodies as they move around. Maybe they have the missing pieces...>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
<The leyline feed crackles as wild energy escapes the gaps in the column.>

==Completion==
<As you insert the fragments back into the pillar the arcane energy begins repairing the cracks. You infuse the feed with ancient mana and the structure stirs to life.>

==Progression==
...

==Patch changes==
