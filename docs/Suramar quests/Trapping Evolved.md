==Objectives==
Collect 4 Arcane Traps for [[Lilryia Dawnwind|Lilryia]].
* [[Arcane Trap (quest item)]] (4)

==Description==
The [[Nightborne]] are using [[magic]] for everything, even trapping.

[[Nighteyes]] saw them at work, laying down magical snares to capture prey rather than the kind our people use. 

Bring me their traps so that I may study their make.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|19|40|}}
|Arcane Trap Power Core
}}

==Progress==
Do you have the snares, <race>?

==Completion==
These devices are peculiar. They are like the traps our [[hunter]]s use, but can magically attract and trap nearby beasts.

==Gains==
* 16,450 [[XP]]
