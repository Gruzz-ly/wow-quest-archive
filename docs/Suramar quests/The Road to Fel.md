==Objectives==
Gather 10 Fel-Infused Plates for [[Kyrtos]].
* [[Fel-Infused Plate]] (10)

==Description==
An early step to understanding how [[magic]] works is to understand and study materials made using that magic. That was how I made my breakthrough on [[warlock]] soul crystals, after all. 

The [[wyrmtongue]] minions in this pit hammer plates into their structures for support and maintenance. Those will be a good starting point. Fetch me some, my faithful assistant!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|19|40|}}
|Enchanted Nightborne Coin

==Progress==
I can practically feel the buildings hum with power.

==Completion==
Excellent. By studying these materials I can better understand how they imbue magic into their machinery and architecture.

==Gains==
