==Objectives==
Find the smuggler. 
*Find the [[Astoril|smuggler]]

==Description==
I must get back into [[Suramar City|Suramar]].

I was exiled unfairly!  I cannot live out here like this.  I need the [[Nightwell]]'s energies...

I saw a message carved into a wall a few days ago.  There is someone in the Water Gardens who can smuggle people into the city.

It said "We shall drink of the Well again."

I cannot survive a confrontation with the guards again.  Will you go in my stead? Once I am back in the city I can repay you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Who are you to seek passage into Suramar?

==Completion==
I hope for both of our sakes that you were not followed.  We must work quickly, considering how close I am.

==Notes==
Astoril is inside a house facing the entrance to the [[Sanctum of Order]].


: <The Nightborne regards you with suspicion.>

: If you are here for a fight, you are most foolish..  Leave now before I call the patrols and the might of Suramar puts an end to you!
