==Objectives==
Speak with [[Thalyssra]].

==Description==
You have used the [[Spellstone of Kel'danath|spellstone]] of [[Arcanist Kel'danath|Kel'danath]] to soothe countless withered.  Yet it contains merely a shade of the [[arcan'dor]]'s power, drawn from its slumbering seed.

<Thalyssra holds aloft a gleaming white branch.>

This fell from the tree.  Though it is severed, it is not dead - invisible threads of magic bind all pieces of the arcan'dor together.

I have enchanted this branch with a new iteration of Kel'danath's charm spell.  With it, you can mend the arcane essence of even more withered.  Use it well.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|The following will be cast on you:
|Branch of the Arcan'dor
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I never imagined I would spend my time in exile studying withered. Through them, I have learned a great deal about my own people, and the nature of our relationship with the [[Nightwell]].

==Progression==
