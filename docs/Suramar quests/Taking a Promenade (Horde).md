==Objectives==
Locate the scouts in the Promenade.
* [[Sentinel Moonshade]] found
* [[Magus Sendath]] found

==Description==
We must learn much about our long-lost kin if we are to fight them.

We dispatched one of our scouts to infiltrate the Promenade and gather intelligence. The [[Sentinels]] sent their own scout as well, hopefully she is smart enough to not get herself killed before reporting in.

They have not returned in some time, and we must suspect the worst.

Find them and we shall see what we are up against.

==Progress==
Those scouts will have valuable information. We must obtain it.

==Completion==
They are alive? That is good news. Their knowledge of the defenses will be invaluable. 

==Notes==
Don't forget to pick up and complete the quests offered by the scouts.

:{{Text|say|Sentinel Moonshade|They did not see me coming. A single blade striking from the shadows goes unnoticed, and a single crack in their defense opens.}}

;Find Sendath
:{{Text|say|Magus Sendath|Ah, reinforcements! Over here, there is much I have to tell you.}}
