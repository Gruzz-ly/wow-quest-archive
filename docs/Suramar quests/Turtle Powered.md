==Objectives==
Collect 7 Shimmering Snapper Scales.
*[[Shimmering Snapper Scale]] (7)

==Description==
In order to locate and purify the source of the corruption I am going to need an [[elemental]] focus.

The [[turtle]]s around here have developed scales that can focus and amplify their innate [[magic]]s. Bring back some snapper scales and we will have these waters purified in no time!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=|Empowered Half-Shell
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Remember, the scales need to be whole to be of any use as a focus.

==Completion==
These will do nicely.
