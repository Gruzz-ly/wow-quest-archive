'''First Contact''' will complete the Masquerade portion of [[Nightfallen But Not Forgotten]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Vanthir]] in [[The Grand Promenade]].
*Speak with Vanthir
*[[Corked Bottle]] (provided)

==Description==
Time to put your new disguise to the test.

Your first contact is Vanthir, a merchant from the common district. He is in the Grand Promenade today visiting one of his suppliers.

Tell Vanthir to pay me a visit regarding a shipment of dusk lily bulbs. He will understand.

Beyond that, we will need time to prepare. You should return to [[Thalyssra]].

<[[Ly'leth Lunastre|Ly'leth]] hands you a corked bottle of faintly glowing fluid.>

Give her this, with my regards. We will call upon you soon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
Have you made contact with our sympathizers?

==Completion==
The Lunastre family is well-connected. They will be of great help to us when the time comes.

==Notes==
Cast [[Masquerade]] immediately so you can move safely through [[Suramar City]], but beware of guards that can dispel your disguise. They are indicated by an icon above their heads.

Upon talking to [[Vanthir]]:

: <Vanthir halts his conversation abruptly as you approach and eyes you suspiciously.>

: [[Anarys Lunastre|Anarys]]. What do you want? Are there no more demon boots left for you to lick?
{{Gossip|''Ly'leth would like you to visit her regarding a shipment of dusk lily pods.''}}
: {{Text|say|Vanthir|Dusk lily pods? I see...}}
: {{Text|say|Vanthir|Please excuse me. I must address this immediately.}}

You will likely notice the quest icon for the nearby telemancy beacon inside the [[Sanctum of Order]]. Go activate it, but there is at least one guard right in your path, and a patrol that you can wait to pass by.

Return to [[Shal'Aran]] and turn in the quest to Thalyssra. While not listed in the quest, you will receive the bottle back as a reward in the form of [[Half-Full Bottle of Arcwine]].
