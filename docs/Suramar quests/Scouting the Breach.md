==Objectives==
Aid [[Valtrois]] underneath the [[Sanctum of Order]] in [[Suramar City]].
* (Optional) Take the Sanctum of Order Teleporter
* Meet with Valtrois below the Sanctum of Order
* Clear a path to the barrier beneath the Sanctum of Order
* Wait with Valtrois while she examines the barrier

==Description==
If [[Ly'leth]]'s information is accurate, there is a breach in the Sanctum of Order that could be our only way into the [[Nighthold]].

No doubt they have magically sealed it - take [[Valtrois]] and protect her while she examines the seal. She is an exceptional talent, and I have total faith in her ability to break whatever enchantment they have cooked up.

Valtrois has her own methods of getting into the city and will meet you inside the [[Sanctum of Order]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Completion==
It appears Ly'leth was correct. This is an entrance to the [[Nightwell]] - and it is well protected. Nothing is impenetrable though.

Let us have a look at the ley lines powering that shield, shall we?

==Notes==
Valtrois is inside the Sanctum of Order just behind the [[Arcway]] [[Meeting Stone]].

: {{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Over here! I sense energies converging below, but aggressive guardians bar my way. I need you to clear a path.}}

Enter the breach in the wall, then go down the narrow corridor, fighting your way through the guards. Valtrois will follow you there.

: {{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Very efficient! Let us get a closer look... Say, this is impressive spellwork.}}
: {{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|A mana bore, perhaps? Hmm... nothing. This requires a great deal of power to maintain.}}
: {{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|It is not attached to the Nightwell, but to the [[ley line]]s. Yet we control them, so how can she... Ah, yes, I see!}}
