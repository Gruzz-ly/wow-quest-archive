==Objectives==
Speak to [[Nomi]].

==Description==
As you might have noticed, [[Vintner Iltheux]] is very particular about his wine making process, but his ancient recipe was crafted with only the [[Nightborne]] in mind.

We need something different to please the diverse palates of the [[Horde]]!

Talk to Nomi and see what he has in mind to spice things up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
Good to see you again, <name>. I've already made improvements to the vintner's recipe.

==Notes==
Head back to where you left [[Boss Mida]] to find [[Micah Broadhoof|Micah]] stomping the fruit in the [[Nightborne Vat]] while Nomi watches. Unsurprisingly, Nomi has somehow managed to set the fruit on fire.

==Progression==
