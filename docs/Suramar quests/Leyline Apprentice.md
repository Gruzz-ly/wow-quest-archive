==Objectives==
Speak with [[Arcanist Valtrois]].

==Description==
Good work finding those additional [[Ley line|leyline]] feeds.

You seem rather competent - for an outlander.

Allow me to share with you a few secrets about the power of the leylines.  This should help you in scavenging more [[Ancient Mana|ancient mana]] from the creatures around [[Suramar]].  A grisly task, I know - which is why I leave it to you!

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you: [[Ancient Mana Scavenging]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*8,230 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
Now listen closely.

==Notes==
This quest will appear after three leyline feeds are activated.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
