==Objectives==
Slay 25 [[withered]] within [[Suramar]].
* Suramar Withered slain (25)

==Description==
<[[Leyweaver Tytallo|Tytallo]] listens as you recount what happened with [[Lyndras]].>

I see. You sound almost... sympathetic to the wretch.

The [[nightfallen]] are liars and thieves. ALL of them. Lyndras included.

I will not tolerate a student that has any respect or sympathy for those... things. And have you witnessed what they turn into at the depths of their depravity?

If you want to get on my good side, do not return until you are covered in the blood of the withered.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If you wish to earn my tutelage, you must first prove that you are on our side.

==Completion==
Hmm.

Very well. We may continue.
