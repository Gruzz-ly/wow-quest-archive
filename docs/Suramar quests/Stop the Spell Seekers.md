==Objectives==
Close 3 Spell Seeker Portals.
* Portals Closed (3)

==Description==
The [[Nightborne]] are here in force. As if that were not worrying enough, they now bring reinforcements.

I have seen them opening large portals to [[Suramar]].

Through these portals they have called in their constructs. They are immune to much of my magic and so represent something of a stumbling block to rejoining the others.

Find the portals and close as many as you can. That should buy us some time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Yes! I can feel their spells receding. Soon I will be able to rejoin [[Thalrenus Rivertree|Thalrenus]]!

==Progression==
{{Moon Guard Stronghold}}
