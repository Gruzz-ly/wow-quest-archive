==Objectives==
Meet with [[First Arcanist Thalyssra]] in [[Shal'Aran]].

==Description==
Refugees are flooding in to Shal'Aran, and many are willing to fight for Thalyssra's rebel army.

They need weapons, training and help from anyone who can provide it.

Go to Shal'Aran and lend your assistance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
*1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This is an unexpected problem, but we have more soldiers than food or weapons.

==Notes==
If you do not get this automatically, you can take it from the Adventure Guide (accessed by SHIFT-J). If however, you've already done the quest [[Noressa (quest)]], you will not be eligible for this quest.

==Progression==
