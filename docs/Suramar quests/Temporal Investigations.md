==Objectives==
Investigate [[Elisande]]'s time spell with [[Khadgar]].
* Help Khadgar investigate the time lock.

==Description==
I knew the [[shal'dorei]] dabbled in time magic, but this is simply incredible...

Elisande stopped time on our entire army!

Come, let us investigate. Perhaps there is a way to break the spell - or at least discover how it is being maintained.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
*1,650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Nightfallen]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
Doing that again will not work. We will need another approach.

==Completion==
We got lucky that time, but trying again could risk all our lives for nothing. We must find another way.

: {{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Our allies have suffered the brunt of the enchantment. I can protect us from the residual energies for a time.}}
: ''Khadgar runs downstairs towards the frozen army.''
: {{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|This temporal magic rivals that of the [[bronze dragonflight]]! I must concentrate on maintaining our defenses.}}
: ''He raises his right fist and channels a spell with it, then joins your party.''
: {{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Take care! Hostile entities have been drawn to this disruption of time! Alright, lead the way.}}

While he is with your party, it is possible to run out of Khadgar's spell circle, especially if you suddenly change direction and he has to turn around to catch up, so keep that in mind.

Kill the [[Minor Pulsauron]]s and groups of [[Lesser Chaotid]]s until you reach...

: {{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|<Tyrande/Liadrin>! I will attempt to pull her out, but doing so will require total focus. Be on your guard, <name>.}}

Defend Khadgar while he breaks the time lock around [[Tyrande]] (if Alliance) or [[Liadrin]] (if Horde).

: {{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|That was close! I nearly shattered the flow of time itself.. but I think it's better now. Are you alright?}}
* {{Alliance}} {{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|I... I am well. What has happened?}}
* {{Horde}} {{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|I couldn't get my shield up in time. What happened?}}
: {{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|No time for that now. Let me get you somewhere safe!}}
: ''Khadgar teleports Tyrande/Liadrin away.''
: {{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I can't maintain our protection any longer! We need to go.}}
: ''Khadgar teleports himself and you back to the overlook.''

On complete:
: ''Oculeth is shocked and flabbergasted, while Valtrois is puzzled.''
: {{Text|say|[[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]]|What Elisande has done... it should have been impossible! The energies required--}}
: {{Text|say|[[Arcanist Valtrois]]|And why didn't [[Ly'leth]] warn us about this? Surely, as one of Elisande's advisors, she would have heard something!}}
: {{Text|say|[[First Arcanist Thalyssra]]|There has been no word from her in some time. This cannot be a coincidence.}}
: {{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|<Name>, we need to find out what happened to Ly'leth. You can still move freely about the city, correct?}}
