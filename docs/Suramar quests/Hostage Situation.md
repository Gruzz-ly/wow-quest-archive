==Objectives==
Go to [[Astravar Harbor]] and join a group of captives being taken to [[Felsoul Hold]]. 
* Join Group of Captives
* Find the Staging Area

==Description==
Our own people, sacrificed to the Legion!

We need to intercept a transport if we intend to put an end to this trade. I'm afraid this does mean you will be playing the part of a captive, my friend.

Before voicing your concerns, try to have a little faith.

We will follow behind in one of [[Deline]]'s boats and break you out once we know where they are going.

Go to the harbor and find a group of captives. Stand among them. Allow yourself to be taken.

We will not be far.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*8230 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Please try to trust me. We will allow no harm to come to you.

==Completion==
Thank you for taking this risk. Let us put an end to this now!

==Notes==
Go to Astravar Harbor and click on a line of chained prisoners to join them. A [[Soul Engine Jailer]] then appears.

:{{Text|yell|Soul Engine Jailer|Line them up!}}
:{{Text|say|Soul Engine Jailer|Ah, look, another prisoner!}}
: ''The player is chained up to the others.''
:{{Text|say|Soul Engine Jailer|Just in time for the next ferry. It's off to the Soul Engine with you!}}

A cutscene plays, showing the jailers sail away on the boat with the prisoners on board. Deline sails after it from a distance with [[Silgryn]], [[Arluelle]] and [[Victoire]] aboard her gondola. Upon arriving at [[Felsoul Advance]], the fighters leap to the beach and ambush the demons, freeing you.
