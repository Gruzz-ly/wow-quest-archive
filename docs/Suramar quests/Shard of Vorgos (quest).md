Collect the Shard of Vorgos.
* [[Shard of Vorgos (quest item)]]

==Description==
According to the [[wyrmtongue]] servant, there is a portal that will take you into the [[Burning Legion]] [[command ship]]. However, the portal is locked to those without the keys.

The first key shard is held by an [[Ered'ruin]] known as [[Vorgos]]. He resides within the [[Fel Breach]], which is at the end of the [[Arcway]].

Slay Vorgos and place the key shard into its position next to the portal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|38|80|}}
*20,560 [[XP]]
*[[Shard of Vorgos]]

==Progress==
<The Shard of Vargos pulses in your hand.>

==Completion==
<The Shard of Vorgos locks into position next to the portal. Swirling [[fel]] energy collects around the shard, filling the room with an ominous, dark presence.>

== Notes ==
To do this easily, do the questline that starts with [[A Way Back In]] first.

''Both shards placed:''
: ''The Legion Portal spawns and so does Lyana just inside the room.  She walks up to it.''
: {{text|say|Lyana Darksorrow|Now that the portal has been opened, the path to Azoran is clear.}}
