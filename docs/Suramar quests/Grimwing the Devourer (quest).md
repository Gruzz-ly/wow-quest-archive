==Objectives==
Slay [[Grimwing the Devourer]].
*[[Grimwing's Head]]
*[[Fresh Mound of Flesh]] (provided)

==Description==
You have my thanks for rescuing me from captivity, <class>.

However, [[Azoran]] is no mere [[demon]]. He is a powerful [[eredar]] who commands great rank within the [[Burning Legion]].

If you wish to continue with me, I need proof of your strength.

Grimwing the Devourer is the strongest of the [[felbat]]s and a suitable test of skill. Place the [[basilisk]] flesh upon the altar to the north and slay Grimwing when she appears.

Return to me with her head and I will not doubt your ability.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|38|80}}
*20,560 [[XP]]
*[[Petrified Fel-Heart]]

==Progress==
What news do you bring of Grimwing the Devourer?

==Completion==
Grimwing was a formidable demon... I must say I am impressed with your skill, <name>.

There are many more demons here to kill. It is good to have someone capable at my side.

Inside the building, Lyana has the [[Servant of Azoran]], a [[wyrmtongue]], at her mercy.  She threatens it with an almost casual tone.  Behind it is an [[Image of Azoran]].
