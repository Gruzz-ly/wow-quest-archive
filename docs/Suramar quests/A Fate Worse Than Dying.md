==Objectives==
Open 8 Soul Engine Cages.
*[[Felsoul Captive]]s saved (8)

==Description==
When the [[Burning Legion]] takes a prisoner, it is not an act of mercy.

While death is the destruction of the mortal body... if you are captured by the Legion, they will seek to destroy your [[soul]].

The Burning Legion uses sacrificial souls to power their [[demon]]ic machinations of war. The [[soul engine]] is where the harvested souls are collected and stored.

Though countless have already perished in the soul engine, you may yet save those still alive inside.

Hurry and release them before it is too late!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have the soul engine cages been opened?

==Completion==
The destruction of the soul is a fate far worse than death. You have done a great service to those you saved.
