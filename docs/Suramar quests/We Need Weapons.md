==Objectives==
Recover 3 Weapon Caches at [[Black Rook Hold]] in [[Val'sharah]].
* Telemancy Beacons placed (3)

==Description==
So many of the rebels want to help in the coming battle. Our people have the will, they lack only the means.

They need weapons.

From what [[Khadgar]] has told me, the fortress of Black Rook has plenty of munitions we could use.

Travel to the fortress and place these beacons on some weapon caches there. Once placed, I can teleport them back.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Blessed Ravencrest Blades]]

==Progress==
How goes the search?

==Completion==
These weapons should prove quite useful in the coming conflict. Well done, hero.

==Notes==
Pick up all three available quests, then mount [[Dusktalon]] to fly directly to the outdoor Black Rook Hold area. They do not involve entering the instance.

Weapons caches are highlighted and have siege machines near them. At each cache, click on the silhouette of the telemancy beacon to place it.
