==Objectives==
Find [[Meerah]] within [[Suramar]]'s [[Twilight Vineyards]].

==Description==
It appears we're making good progress.

Would you meet up with Meerah?

I want to be sure she's found her way to the vintner in Suramar.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
[[Vintner Iltheux]] has some serious staffing issues.

==Notes==
Upon entering the Twilight Vineyards, you enter a phase where most of the hostile NPCs disappear. Meerah, [[Dolly]], and [[Dot (alpaca)|Dot]]—along with their wagon—can be found not far from the vineyards' entrance. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Meerah|Thank the sands you're here. There's nothing quite right about this at all!}}
