==Objectives==
Help [[Thalyssra]] collect 3 of [[Vanthir]]'s Arcane Essences.
*Promenade Essence
*Shimmershade Garden Essence
*Evermoon Bazaar Essence

==Description==
Vanthir... an example! That certainly explains why [[Elisande]] chose to hold him this long.

We need to move quickly. I can track him, but I will need to find places where his Arcane Essence is strongest.

This will not be an easy feat, not in a city this old, but with any luck there are a few places important enough to him that he left a little bit of himself behind.

We should start in the promenade- he often visited it for business.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
Did you find them?

==Completion==
All that remains is to focus on his essence to isolate his location. Good work.

==Notes==
On accept:

: ''Thalyssra casts Arcanist's Invisibility on herself and joins the party.''
:{{Text|say|[[First Arcanist Thalyssra]]|I will find him. Preferably without being seen.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Ly'leth Lunastre]]|Be safe, Thalyssra. I must return to the palace.}}

If you see another player with a Thalyssra following them on this quest, the duplicate Thalyssra will be shown under the [[generic name]] "Nightborne Rebel Arcanist".

After finding each essence, which manifests as ghostly images of Vanthir and his surroundings, click on it to proceed. Thalyssra will cast a spell on the essence and move on.

;Shimmershade Garden Essence
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|This garden likely gave him many hours of respite. His essence is strong and bright, here.}}
: ''She collects the Essences.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|I can feel him! He is still alive, at least.}}

;Promenade Essence
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|This must be where he took many meals...}}
: ''She collects the Essences.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|There it is. We are coming, Vanthir.}}

;Evermoon Bazaar Essence
: ''Inside a standalone building across from the Evermoon Terrace tower, it appears that [[arcwine]] and other drinks are sold here.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|One of his suppliers must have served him here. Reminders of a simpler time.}}
: ''She collects the Essences.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Perfect. This will be enough to find him.}}

Head to [[Evermoon Terrace]], as the quest directions suggest. Thalyssra will be there.

:{{Text|say|[[Silgryn]]|Thalyssra?!}}
: ''Thalyssra is pleased.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Keep your voice down, Silgryn. It is good to see you too.}}
