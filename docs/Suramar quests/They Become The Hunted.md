==Objectives==
Slay 6 Nightborne Trappers.
* [[Nightborne Trapper]]s slain (6)

==Description==
The [[Trapper Rodoon|trapper]] you slew was but one of many.

The [[Nightborne]] are subjugating the local creatures, creating a sort of pleasurable exhibit.  I think we can strike them in two places at once.

Descend upon these trappers, <race>.  Let us teach them a lesson in respecting their prey.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
With the number of trappers thinned, their ability to scout into [[Suramar]] will be sorely hampered.

==Completion==
Excellent work.  They do not respect the hunt, so they must be reminded of their place.
