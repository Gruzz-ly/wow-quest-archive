==Description==
We are as ready as we will ever be. Once we put [[Arcanist Valtrois|Valtrois]]' plan into action, we can attack the [[Sanctum of Order]] and put an end to [[Andaris Narassin|Andaris]]. She will never expect us to have trained our withered against [[fel]] magic, and her hubris will be her downfall.

Come, let us feed the people one last time.
