==Objectives==
Use the Dusk Lily Sigil on [[Duskwatch Subjugator]]s to identify 5 Deserters. 
*Deserters Identified (5)
*[[Dusk Lily Sigil]] (provided)

==Description==
Greetings, Outlander.

I am [[Victoire]]. I served [[Elisande]] while she maintained peace in the city. I fought beside demons and worse for the greater good.

The massacre at the [[Waning Crescent]] made it clear that she no longer serves the [[Nightborne]]. She serves only herself.

There are others who feel as I do. They simply need proof that there is another way.

The Dusk Lily is not unknown to us- try showing it to those now guarding [[Astravar Harbor]]. They have seen the worst of Elisande's cruelty.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16450 [[XP]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
Did you find more like me?

==Completion==
Hopefully more will follow their example.

Thank you for showing them another way to serve the Nightborne.

==Notes==
If a [[Duskwatch Subjugator]] fails to be persuaded by the sigil, they attack:
* {{Text|say|Duskwatch Subjugator|You dare show yourself here!? Die, fiend!}}
* {{Text|say|Duskwatch Subjugator|Rebel! I will end you!}}
* {{Text|say|Duskwatch Subjugator|You are one of them! Die, interloper!}}
* {{Text|say|Duskwatch Subjugator|Elisande will praise me for killing you!}}

If a Subjugator defects, they say one of these lines:
* {{Text|say|Duskwatch Subjugator|Elisande must be stopped!}}
* {{Text|say|Duskwatch Subjugator|This is too much... If I must be labeled a traitor then so be it!}}
* {{Text|say|Duskwatch Subjugator|I cannot believe what Elisande is doing to her own people. I must fight back!}}
* {{Text|say|Duskwatch Subjugator|I thought I was the only one... I stand with the Dusk Lily!}}
* {{Text|say|Duskwatch Subjugator|I knew there were others! I will no longer bloody my hands for Elisande!}}
* {{Text|say|Duskwatch Subjugator|I kept quiet when the demons came, but this... this is unspeakable.}}
