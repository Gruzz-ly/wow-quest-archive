==Objectives==
Speak to [[Arluin]].

*Ask Arluin for Help
*Arluin Paid

==Description==
If [[Ly'leth]] is to achieve the role of advisor to the [[Grand Magistrix Elisande|Grand Magistrix]] we will need to open a path for her.

It is true she will have some supporters but they alone cannot grant her the title.

There are other houses that Ly'leth must contend with.  Fear and coercion are their tools.  None dare stand against them openly, and we cannot win them over with favors and oaths.

Seek out Arluin.  I trust he will have some ideas of how to proceed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
Yes, I know why you are here.  Yes, I can get the job done.  No, it will not be free.

==Completion==
Very well. Let us talk strategy.

==Notes==
:{{gossip|We need your help 'persuading' some noble houses to support Ly'leth's bid for advisor. Are you in?}}
:{{Text|say|Arluin|Is that what she's up to? Brave girl. I'd be delighted to help, but...}}

:{{gossip|Offer: 1200x [[Ancient Mana]]}}
: ''This action will remove 1200 Ancient Mana.  Do you want to continue?''
: (Accept/Cancel)

On completion:
:{{Text|say|Arluin|Always a pleasure. Do things my way and she'll be advisor before dinner.}}
