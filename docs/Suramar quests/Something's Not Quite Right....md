==Objectives==
Remove the disguise of 5 Nightborne Infiltrators.
*[[Shal'dorei Infiltrator]] discovered (5)
*[[Dispelling Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
Something is troubling me, champion.

Beyond these simple japes, the [[Kirin Tor]] has had to break up a few fights between the elves. I am worried something - or someone - might be influencing them.

Your disguise was made by the [[nightborne]], yes? It is not unreasonable to assume they can do something similar.

Fortunately, [[Thalyssra]] has told me much about how the illusion works, and I believe this crystal can remove their disguise.

Why don't you check the camps, just to be safe?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Overcharged Infiltrator's Mask]]
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find the instigators?

==Completion==
It is as I feared. Hopefully they will think twice before sending more spies.

==Notes==
Sweet, sweet revenge!

On accept, you will get a five-minute "Detector" buff that shows an icon over your head (the same one shown over [[Suramar City]] guards that see through [[Masquerade]]) and a dark glow around infiltrators. When you get close to them, use the quest item to remove the disguise, which will cast a disguise-removing aura around you, again similar to the one used by the city guards.

Shouting "Something's not quite right!", "An illusion! What are you hiding?" or "Who goes there?" is optional.

If you lose the buff, you can ask Khadgar to reapply it, however you can simply just click on the NPCs and see if they have the Masquerade buff.

''{{gossip|I am having difficulty spotting the infiltrators, Khadgar. Can you help me detect them?}}''

Note that the quest gives credit for discovering the infiltrators, not killing them. You can simply let the Kirin Tor Peacekeepers take care of them once you remove their disguise.
