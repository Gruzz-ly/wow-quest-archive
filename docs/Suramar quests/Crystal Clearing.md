==Objectives==
Destroy 4 Portal Crystals.
*[[Portal Crystal]]s destroyed (4)

==Description==
This portal is a problem. With it they can summon countless reserves.

The crystals nearby seem to be powering the gate. If we destroy those, we can set them back significantly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
Each crystal destroyed makes it that much harder to open the portal again.

==Completion==
Nice work. They will not be opening that portal again any time soon.

==Progression==
{{An Elven Problem}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.1.0|note=Added.}}
