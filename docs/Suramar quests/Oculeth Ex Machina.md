==Objectives==
Speak with [[Oculeth]] and teleport to [[Azsuna]].
*Speak with Oculeth

==Description==
I have a plan to feed [[Shal'Aran]].

Now that I am no longer starving for mana I have had time to study [[ley line]]s in new regions. I detected an eddy of mana in the ley lines of Azsuna. I have plenty of magic at my disposal, but we must visit the ley line in person in order to properly redirect the energy to Shal'Aran.

Oculeth has graciously offered to teleport us there, but I could use an assistant. Care to join me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*8,230 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
That was a little terrifying. Sometimes I am not entirely sure that Oculeth knows what he is doing.

==Notes==
Talk to Oculeth.

:Ready to go, <name>? I always love teleporting to a new place!

:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|There we are! I am more or less locked on to the location you requested. Off you go!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Arcanist Valtrois]]|Wait... What are you--}}

You and Valtrois appear inside a cave in the [[Ley-Ruins of Zarkhenar]].

On complete, an old friend approaches!
