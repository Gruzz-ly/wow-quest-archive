==Objectives==
Recover 6 stashed supplies.
* [[Stashed Supplies (item)]] (6)

==Description==
We will need supplies for our trip into [[Suramar City|Suramar]].  We cannot exactly stop for refreshments at the gate with you two in tow, can we?

The water gardens were a place to socialize and relax.  Before the patrols arrived it was rather trivial to hide some [[Arcwine|mana wine]] for later retrieval.

That's where you come in.  Fetch some supplies and bring them to your friend, then meet me at the ruins north of the city.  We will be ready to depart soon.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|19|40|}}
|Enchanted Nightborne Coin
}}

==Progress==
Did you find the smuggler?  What did they say?

==Completion==
Is that mana wine?  For me?

<[[Iadreth]] hungrily gulps down the bottle.>

You and this [[Astoril]] have my thanks.  I would surely have perished out here.
