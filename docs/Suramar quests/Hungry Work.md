==Objectives==
Use [[Ancient Mana]] to feed [[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]].
*Chief Telemancer Oculeth fed

==Description==
We must get Chief Telemancer Oculeth back on his feet as soon as possible.

Find ancient mana, any way you can, and feed it to him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
<Oculeth shivers uncontrollably.>

==Completion==
Ah, I am feeling much better. Thank you!

Now let us get to work.

==Notes==
To complete this one, you will need to complete the daily quest [[Feed Oculeth]] that Oculeth offers. As it did with Thalyssra, it costs 50 [[Ancient Mana]].

Upon feeding Oculeth he will say one of his many recovery quotes, such as:
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Blech. How did we live before the [[Nightwell]]?}}

==Progression==
{{Chief Telemancer Oculeth}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2025-10-10|bluenote=Fixed an issue where players sometimes could not complete the quest because Oculeth didn't feel like eating.}}
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
