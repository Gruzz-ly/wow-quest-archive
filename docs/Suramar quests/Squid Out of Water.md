==Objectives==
Destroy 5 Willbreaker Incubators in the [[Sashj'tar Ruins]].
*[[Willbreaker Incubator]]s destroyed (5)

==Description==
[[Toryl]] told me about those [[Merciless one|squid creatures]] that are controlling my brothers.

I have never seen anything like them before around [[Jandvik]]. The [[naga]] must have brought them from wherever they came.

I do not want any more of [[Vrykul|my kin]] to suffer the fate of being controlled by the naga.

Find out where those squids come from and stop them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I cannot think of a worse fate than to be controlled by another.

==Completion==
The naga will not be taking any more of my kin!

==Progression==
{{Jandvik's Jarl}}
