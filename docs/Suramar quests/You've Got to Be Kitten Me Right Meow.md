==Objectives==
"Herd" 7 [[Lost Feathermane Kitten]]s back home.
*Lost Feathermane Kittens Herded (7)

==Description==
While you were dealing with the stray [[Owlkitten]], I took a look around.

It seems these curious creatures have a habit of escaping their parents' watchful eyes - some are trapped across the road by a wandering [[Ettin]].

He appears to have been... ahem... eating them.

We can earn [[Yowlon]]'s blessing by bringing his children home.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|Lurking Owl Kitten
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
Have you managed to rescue any?

==Completion==
They look so happy to be home. Excellent work.

==Notes==
On complete:
