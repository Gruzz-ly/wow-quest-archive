==Objectives==
* Assault on [[Felborne Outpost]]

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Silgryn]]|The [[Duskwatch]] have taken outposts in the [[Crimson Thicket]]. Unleash the [[Withered]] at your command and drive them out!}}

==Completion==
: {{text|say|Silgryn|The Duskwatch presume to push beyond their borders in the midst of a revolution. You repaid them for their arrogance!}}

== Gains ==
* +250 reputation with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

== Notes ==
Contrary to what the quest says, you do not get any Withered to use. Just kill mobs and burn Marching Orders. On foot, it would probably be easiest to use the [[Twilight Vineyards]] portal.
