==Objectives==
Pick the [[Fruit of the Arcan'dor]] and share it with [[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]], [[Arcanist Valtrois]], and [[First Arcanist Thalyssra]].
*Share Fruit with Oculeth
*Share Fruit with Valtrois
*Share Fruit with Thalyssra

==Description==
Thousands of years ago, as the [[Quel'dorei]] were just beginning to unravel the mysteries of the [[arcane]], a small enclave of [[druid]]s met with the first of the elven [[magi]].

In the pale moonlight, they formed an order that would seek to bring the arcane into balance - using nature itself as a vessel.  Thus the [[arcan'dor]] were created.

My masters who belonged to this order have long since faded away.  Yet their legacy remains.

Their gift will mend the spirit of the [[shal'dorei]].  Let them eat, and be made whole.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Arcfruit]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
The shal'dorei must eat the fruit of the arcan'dor.  It is the only way to free them.

==Completion==
At last... we are free.

==Notes==
''Accept:''
:{{text|say|Valewalker Farodin|Behold.  The gift of the ancient magi.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|This tree came at a high cost...  You are sure it can sustain us?}}
:{{Text|say|Valewalker Farodin|The arcan'dor will not merely sustain you.  By the fruit of its bough, you will be made whole again.}}

;Oculeth
I will be the first to taste this experiment of ours.  Let any ill effects fall to me.

{{gossip|<Offer Fruit of the Arcan'dor.>}}
: ''He bites into the fruit.''
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Hmm... A little tart, with a hint of- oh my... there it is.}}
: ''Rings of arcane on the floor surround Oculeth and his body absorbs them.''
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Astounding.}}

;Valtrois
I will have what Oculeth is having.

{{gossip|<Offer Fruit of the Arcan'dor.>}}
: ''She bites into the fruit.''
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Perhaps there is a new path for us after all...}}
: ''Her body absorbs the arcane.''
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|You have my thanks, outlander.}}

;Thalyssra
I am ready to shed this hunger and lead my people to salvation.

{{gossip|<Offer Fruit of the Arcan'dor.>}}
: ''She bites into the fruit and her body absorbs the arcane.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|We are on the brink of a new age for the [[Nightborne]].}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Without you, none of this would have been possible.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|For now, we shall gather our strength. When the time comes, I trust we can call upon you to help us liberate [[Suramar]].}}

After completing this quest, the three resistance leaders will no longer need to be fed with [[Ancient Mana]], so [[Feed Thalyssra]], [[Feed Oculeth]] and [[Feed Valtrois]] will become unavailable. However, as you are already {{Reputation|exalted}} with The Nightfallen at this point, they would provide no benefit anyway.
