== Notes ==
This is generally considered very difficult to complete without flying, let alone solo.  There are illusion breaker mobs everywhere in the area, including the patrol mobs.  Most group finder parties will actually be players that can fly, while earlier in the expansion, a full party would work their way through the mobs to reach the 'bosses'.

If you can't fly, it is possible to glide to one of the targets from the [[Twilight Vineyards]].  While there, flying party members will likely be taking down one of the other targets, which you may get kill credit for.

This cannot be done in a raid group.
