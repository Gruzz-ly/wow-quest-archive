==Objectives==
Slay 6 Shardmaidens in the [[Shattered Locus]].
*[[Shardmaiden]] slain (6)

==Description==
Long have I walked this land and I have seen many forms of corruption.

The creatures that wander this hall are twisted by the magics unleashed by the failed [[arcan'dor]]. 

These [[dryads]] have lost their way, and cannot be saved.

You must destroy them. End their suffering.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
Death is the only kindness we can give them now.

==Completion==
Thank you. This place will never recover, but their madness need not harm others.

==Progression==
{{A Growing Crisis}}
