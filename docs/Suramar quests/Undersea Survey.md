Completing [[Fisherman's Tonic]] will permanently buff you with [[Draught of Seawalking]] when you're in Azuregale Bay. It is also important to have finished [[Jandvik's Last Hope]] or to not have it in your quest log, as you will be in a different phase.

Activating pylons will spawn three [[Entropic Leyfiend]]s that will attack you.

For help against mobs, you can kill an [[Azuregale Zapper]] for Energized Jolt, a one-off AOE attack. The charge will last for five minutes.
