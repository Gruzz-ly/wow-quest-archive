==Objectives==
Obtain a Mana Focus from the [[Mana Devourer]] within [[Return to Karazhan|Karazhan]]

* [[Mana Focus]]

==Description==
Drat! The [[Ancient Mana|ancient mana]] doesn't seem to be working. I need to think the problem through, focus and...

Wait, that's it! Focus! We need to focus the energy of the ancient mana to activate the cube.

I've heard tell of a [[mana wyrm]] in Karazhan with the means to focus its powers. Might be just what we need!

Watch out, though. My sources tell me this wyrm is humongous!

==Completion==
You've done it! Was the wyrm truly gargantuan? Oh, nevermind, size is relative...

Let us get this focus into the cube and see what it does!
