==Objectives==
Explore [[Moonshade Sanctum]].
*Explore Moonshade Sanctum

==Description==
I do not know what [[Theryn]] found, but I know where he found it.

Moonshade Sanctum, to the west.  Beyond the [[Temple of Fal'adora]].

Whatever power altered Theryn's arcane essence...  Whatever power allowed [[Arcanist Kel'danath|Kel'danath]] to create a spell to soothe the withered...  Its source rests there.

I know this as surely as if I had been there myself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*8,230 [[XP]]
*10 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
<You recognize the relic from Thalyssra's vision.>

==Notes==
Do not jump down, not yet. The relic is above ground.

Upon approaching [[Moonshade Sanctum]]:

:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Arcane communion forms a bond that transcends physical space.}}
:{{Text|say|Theryn|Ngahh...}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|I shall do my best to keep Theryn off the line...}}
