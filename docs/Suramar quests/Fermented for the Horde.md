==Objectives==
Collect the needed ingredients to create a wine worthy of the [[Horde]].
*[[Silkwing Fibers]] (20)
*[[Fermented Firebloom]] (10)

==Description==
[[Vintner Iltheux]]'s recipe doesn't need much improvement.

Some unique ingredients and slight modifications to the winemaking process is all that's needed.

I'm thinking adding fermented firebloom should do the trick. Then, filter it through a special cloth made from silkwing fibers.

There are plenty of silkwings roaming [[Twilight Vineyards|the vineyard]], and I have no doubt that [[Boss Mida]] can acquire flowers, for a price.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|29|25}}

==Process==
Together, we will make a wine worthy of the Horde.

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. This will do just the trick.

==Notes==
[[File:Fermented for the Horde.jpg|thumb|Mida and Kazit]]
Boss Mida and [[Kazit]] can now be found in the building where [[Micah Broadhoof|Micah]] previously stood. Mida sells all the same supplies as [[Kul Tiras]] and [[Zandalar]] trade supplies vendors, as well as [[Fermented Firebloom]] for {{Cost|1|25}} each.

;Speaking with Mida
:Whatever ya need, we got it.
:{{Buy|I wish to browse your wares.}}

After buying 10 Firebloom, head southeast to the orchard to kill [[Tattered Silkwing]]s for their [[Silkwing Fibers]]. Return to Nomi to turn in.
