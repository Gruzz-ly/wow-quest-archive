'''Meeting their Quota''' is a rare [[World Quest]] in [[Suramar]].

==Objectives==
*Speak with [[Vintner Iltheux]]
*Unfortified [[Arcwine]] produced

==Description==
:{{text|say|[[Vanthir]]|If the [[Twilight Vineyards|Vineyard's]] production quotas are not met, the citizens are the first to suffer. Help them reach their goals so arcwine rations continue to flow.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
:{{text|say|Vanthir|You are going to be quite the accomplished vintner! Rations leave the vineyard once more.}}

==Notes==
*There is nothing quite like the smell of fresh wine, ready for the barrel. Try making some for yourself, and you'll see!
*Another connoisseur? Perhaps you'd like to help me prepare the unfortified wine?
*Ahh... have you come to learn more about the ancient art of wine making?

''{{gossip|Yes, I am ready to help make arcwine.}}''

:{{text|say|Vintner Iltheux|Let's begin then. I'll call out what you need to do, just follow my instructions.}}

===Directions===
;Silver Jasmine
:{{text|say|Vintner Iltheux|Toss in something floral for a bit of class.}}

;Shadefruit
:{{text|say|Vintner Iltheux|The batch needs something sour... something shady.}}

;Purified Water
:{{text|say|Vintner Iltheux|You need to add a bit of moisture or you'll back up the taps!}}

;Stomping
:{{text|say|Vintner Iltheux|Get into the vat and jump on the fruit!}}

;Next instruction
*{{text|say|Vintner Iltheux|You're a natural! What does the recipe call for next...}}
*{{text|say|Vintner Iltheux|Yes, just like that! Hmm... what does this batch need now?}}
*{{text|say|Vintner Iltheux|Excellent! Now, what next...}}

===Fail===
:{{text|bossemote|The arcwine has soured... you must start over!}}
*{{text|say|Vintner Iltheux|No, this simply won't do. We'll have to start over from scratch.}}
*{{text|say|Vintner Iltheux|Perhaps you had a glass or three before coming here? We'll have to throw out this batch...}}
*{{text|say|Vintner Iltheux|No, that won't do at all. Start over, and this time, please pay attention!}}

===Success===
:{{text|say|Vintner Iltheux|That's it! A great batch, for an amateur. I'll have it bottled at once!}}
