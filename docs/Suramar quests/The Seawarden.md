==Objectives==
Kill Seawarden Largush in [[Azuregale Bay]].
*[[Seawarden Largush]] slain

==Description==
The Seawarden made a deal with the [[Tidemistress Sashj'tar|Tidemistress]]. She handed us over to him like cattle.

I despise that [[sea giant]]! If I were not trapped in this bubble, I would choke the life out of him with my own two hands.

If you cross his path before I get out of here, make him regret ever making a deal with the [[naga]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[The Seawarden's Beacon]]

==Progress==
Have you slain the Seawarden?

==Completion==
I only wish that I had the chance to get to him first.

Bah! His body can rot in these waters for all I care.
