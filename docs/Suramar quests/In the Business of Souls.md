==Objectives==
Slay Aargoss in [[Felsoul Advance]].
*[[Aargoss]] slain

==Description==
We will hold our position here while you find and slay the demon responsible for this camp.

Ending [[Aargoss]] will not permanently stop this smuggling operation, but it may slow them down long enough for us to find another way to help these people.

Go quickly. He is somewhere atop this ridge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16450 [[XP]]
*[[Mark of the Soulcleaver]]

==Progress==
Have you dealt with Aargoss?

==Completion==
Well done. Let us leave before they call in reinforcements.

==Notes==
Pick up the quest [[Smuggled!]] from [[Maribeth]] nearby before heading off.
