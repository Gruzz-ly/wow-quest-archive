==Objectives==
Test the [[withered]]'s resistance against fel magic at [[Felsoul Hold]].
*Destroy [[Felsoul Shard]]s (3)
*[[Experimental Targeting Orb]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Andaris Narassin|Andaris]]'s control over the withered poses a real threat. If we are to increase the withered's resistance against these effects, we must do so in an environment built from this very magic.

Head for Felsoul Hold at once. When you arrive, I will send withered to aide in your efforts. It is of the utmost importance you do not leave until you are certain the experiments yield the appropriate results. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Making progress, I assume?

==Completion==
The withered seem to be adapting quite well.

==Notes==
Do not take the teleporter to [[Felsoul Hold]]. The shards are above-aground, so you would be wasting time fighting your way through all the demons to reach the outdoors. Instead, head southwest from [[Meredil]] and -- carefully -- fall into the subzone.

;Enter Felsoul Hold
:{{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|The [[fel crystal]]s anchor the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s power here. We should see what the Withered can do against them.}}

;Quest completion
:{{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|I've seen enough. I believe I can dampen the effect of fel magic on the Withered. Go to the Soul Engine and I will send new subjects your way.}}

==Progression==
{{As Strong As Our Will}}
