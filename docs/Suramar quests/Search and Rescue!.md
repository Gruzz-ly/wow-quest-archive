==Objectives==
Find [[Brambley Morrison]].
* [[Angus Stormbrew]] [[Reinforced Cage|released]]
* Enter the [[Halls of the Eclipse]]
* Find Brambley's [[Opened Cage|Cage]]
* [[Felsoul Cage Key]]
* [[Nightfallen]] Prisoner [[Locked Cage|released]]

==Description==
We've got to find Brambley before it's too late!

Ol' Brambley an' I have been fightin' side by side since the [[Third War]]. When the [[Burning Legion|Burnin' Legion]] invaded, we didn't think twice about coming to the [[Broken Isles]].

Fightin' is what we do best!

During the battle ol' Brambley got caught too deep an' got himself captured. Now we've got to rescue him!

Last I saw, the [[demon]]s were keeping him in a prison cell not far from here... let's go!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|19|40|}}
|Starsong's Bauble
}}

You will also gain:
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found the key yet?

==Completion==
It's good to finally be free from this dreadful cage. As thanks, I will keep my word to you and your grotesquely hairy friend.

== Notes ==
Open the Reinforced Cage and Angus jumps out.

: {{text|say|Angus Stormbrew|We gotta get to Brambley, before it's too late!}}

In the Halls of the Eclipse, find the Opened Cage and interact with it.

: ''From the cage beside it, the nightfallen [[Selthaes Starsong]] speaks up.''
: {{text|say|Selthaes Starsong|Your [[human]] friend was taken by the demons.  Grant me my freedom and I will tell you where he was taken!}}
: {{text|say|Angus Stormbrew|Aye, let's get him the key... but be on your guard.  This place is crawling with demons.}}

The Felsoul Keyring is just hanging on the wall downstairs.  Open the Locked Cage and turn in to Selthaes.

* One thing you can do is ''not'' turn in the quest, but just work up to Find Brambley's Cage, but not getting the Felsoul Cage Key.  That way every time you enter Felsoul Hold, Angus will spawn and help you kill mobs you're attacking.  Once you're done with quests in the Halls of the Eclipse, feel free to complete the quest.

''Complete:''
: ''Selthaes jumps out.''
: {{text|say|Selthaes Starsong| Your friend was taken to the [[felstalker]] pits beneath the great [[Lightbreaker|Burning Legion command ship]].}}
: ''He runs off.''
: {{text|say|Selthaes Starsong|Sadly, it's probably too late for him... don't foolishly throw your lives away for a dead man!}}
