==Objectives==

* [[Nightborne Wretch]]es fed (8)

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Vanthir]]|I have enough arcwine to spare for the needy around the city.  Find those who cannot travel to my tavern and see that they drink their fill.}}

==Rewards==
* +200 reputation with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

{{wqr|Legion}}

==Completion==
: {{text|say|Vanthir|Something so simple as feeding the needy, made perilous by [[Elisande]].  Your bravery is all that stands between them and a terrible fate.}}

== Notes ==
;Obtain Arcwine from Ciele
* I only hope it's enough.  Too many people around the city are on the brink...
* It's getting harder to find Arcwine going spare... but what we get, we share with the poorest among us.
''{{gossip|I will take your Arcwine and share it with the needy.}}''
: {{text|say|It's good to see you back again.  Vanthir procured more Arcwine for you to distribute.}}

Feeding wretches also introduces the Empathy buff: for each NPC, your maximum health is increased by 10%, up to five NPCs for 50%, for 30 minutes in the [[Broken Isles]].  At any time you can find one and give them five [[Ancient Mana]] instead.  Each time you do, your timer and stacks will also be reset to full.

If the NPC is standing, it will take a moment for the buff to be applied so you will have to stay beside them until they do.  For those lying down, it is instant.

;Nightborne Wretch
* Please... even a few drops of arcwine might spare my mind from madness...
* You look strong... clearly you have arcwine to spare!
* I feel my mind... slipping... need arcwine...

''{{gossip|I've brought you some arcwine... drink up!}}''

* {{text|say|Nightborne Wretch|So generous!  Thank you, I owe you my life!}}
* {{text|say|Nightborne Wretch|Such potency... I am saved!  Thank you!}}
