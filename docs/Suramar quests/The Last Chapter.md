==Objectives==
Find the Encyclopedia Botanica.
*[[Encyclopedia Botanica]]

==Description==
The next step of my journey requires a tome, but I find that I am still unable to idly sit by as this place continues to fall into disrepair.

I will tidy up the memorials while you go fetch me the tome. It is called the Encyclopedia Botanica and you can find it in the library near the main plaza.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=|Enchanted Nightborne Coin

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the tome, <race>?

==Completion==
Hmph. I suppose if you're assisting me with my task, I should learn your name.

<Thaedris reaches into the book and pulls out an unfamiliar, dried plant.>

Thank you for fetching me another one of the ingredients. Your assistance is... welcome, <name>.
