==Objectives==
Inspect 6 pages of [[Kel'danath's Notes]].
*Kel'danath's Notes read (6)

==Description==
<As your fingers trace the elegant symbols on the page, a voice dictates the words in your mind.

It seems the [[nightborne]] have elevated even simple note-taking to a sorcerous art.

[[Arcanist Kel'danath]] was definitely working in this area.  There must be more of his notes scattered around.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
<A bag containing countless pages of technical notes. Flipping through them, you find Kel'danath's last journal entry.>

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Kel'danath|Day 5: Wards prove effective at deterring the [[withered]], but do nothing for the cacophony of critters and beasts outside. The nights are so loud out here.}}
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Kel'danath|I relish what little sleep I can manage. Tomorrow I begin looking for subjects.}}

First note:
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Kel'danath|Day 9: Still no luck communicating with the withered. I must regard this failure not as a measure of ability, but a measure of progress.}}

Second note:
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Kel'danath|Day 14: The new subject, number 16, is special. His arcane essence is touched by some mysterious power. I have named him [[Theryn]].}}

Third note:
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Kel'danath|Day 16: Breakthrough! Using Theryn's essence as the base, I have crafted a spell that calms the withered. At least, it works sometimes...}}

Fourth note:
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Kel'danath|Day 24: Awoke to [[Valewalker Farodin|a night elf's]] blade at my neck. He asked what I was doing to the withered. "Searching for a cure," I replied. He merely grunted, and disappeared into the woods.}}

Fifth note:
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Kel'danath|Day 33: Low on [[Arcwine|arc-wine]]. Theryn making excellent progress. Shal'an remains stubborn. Crystals becoming harder to find.}}

Sixth note:
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Kel'danath|Day 40: A massive [[ettin]] trampled through my workshop at [[Koralune Manor]]. Scared him away with magic. Have a feeling he will be back...}}

On complete:
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Kel'danath|Day 50: The sky... has turned black. Demons... everywhere. And this hunger... this endless hunger...}}
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Kel'danath|Subjects released... I can no longer protect them...}}
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Kel'danath|My spellstone... someone please... use it to carry on my work...}}

==Progression==
