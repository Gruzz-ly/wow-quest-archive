==Objectives==
Enter the [[Grand Promenade]] and slay 15 defenders.
* Suramar defenders slain (15)

==Description==
First things first, <name>: we must set up our camp.

We do not have the time or resources for a prolonged siege. It is not like we can starve them out. No, we must be swift and sure as an arrow, piercing their heart in one strike.

They are drawing up their battle lines within the city, but could attack us while we are setting up our defenses.

Venture forth and show them what the kaldorei have learned from thousands of years of war. Discover their weaknesses so that we may exploit them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Blessed Kaldorei Banner]]

==Progress==
Have you eliminated the threat?

==Completion==
Any regret I had for these people vanished when they went under that shield.
