==Objectives==
Collect 7 Moon Guard Sigils.
* [[Moon Guard Sigil]] (Provided) (7)

==Description==
The smooth square sigil weighs a fair amount more than its appearance would suggest. Handling it results in an intense tingling sensation in your palm- this is an object of focused, pure power. Such an advantage should not be so easily surrendered to the [[Nightborne]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
What is this?

==Completion==
You were wise to keep these out of our enemies hands, <class>. I believe you can be trusted.

==Progression==
{{Moon Guard Stronghold}}
