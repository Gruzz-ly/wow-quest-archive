==Objectives==
Feed [[Theryn]] 300 [[Ancient Mana]].
*Theryn fed

==Description==
All of [[Arcanist Kel'danath|Kel'danath]]'s experiments to connect with the withered failed, and some even made them more dangerous.

Until he found Theryn.

His arcane essence - the very soul of the [[shal'dorei]] - had been touched by something special.  But what?

By weaving my arcane essence together with Theryn's, I can create an empathic bond.  This communion will bare his soul to us all - or what's left of it.

We need only to feed him mana, and lots of it, in order to begin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
Feed Theryn as much as he will take.

==Completion==
Good. Let us see what we can learn.

==Notes==
On accept:

:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|We should be planning our attack on [[Suramar]]!}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|That is precisely what I am doing.}}
