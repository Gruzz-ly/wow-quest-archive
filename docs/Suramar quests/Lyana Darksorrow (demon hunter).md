Destroy the Soul Harvester.
*Soul Harvester destroyed

==Description==
<Your fellow [[Illidari]], [[Lyana Darksorrow]], floats captive in stasis in front of you; her soul slowly draining into the harvester crystal.>

<In order to release her from stasis, you will need to destroy the soul harvester.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|83|50}}
*1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>, you are a sight for sore eyes. You have my gratitude for releasing me.

I do not know how long I have been held captive... but I sense an overwhelming number of [[demon]]s nearby.

I have much to do here. Care to join me?
