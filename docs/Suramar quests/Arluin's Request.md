==Objectives==
Locate [[Arluelle]] and give her a piece of the Arcan'dor Fruit.
*Locate Arluelle
*Share Arcan'dor Fruit with Arluelle

==Description==
I never thought I would need to read this...

<[[Vanthir]] hefts a scroll in his hand.>

[[Arluin]] made... plans... in the event he fell.  It is not much, but I would like to honor his last request.

<Vanthir hands you the scroll.>

Go to the location marked on this map. Take this Arcan'dor Fruit and give it to a woman named Arluelle.  Arluin was very specific that all rewards for his work be directed to her.

I think he may have known what his sacrifice meant.  I was wrong about him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
Where is Arluin?

==Completion==
I am not hungry any more. I can think- I will live! Oh, Arluin...

==Notes==
Arluelle is in a room below the bridge, near the canals. {{coords|47.7|66.5|Suramar}}

Upon approaching Arluelle:
: ''Arluelle is laying on the floor among the Huddled Vagrants.''
: {{Text|say|Arluelle|Who is there?}}
: ''She gets to her feet.''
: {{Text|say|Arluelle|<Cough.>  Arluin, is that you?  It is so dark...}}

Upon talking to her:
: Is Arluin coming? I haven't seen him in days...
{{Gossip|''Arluin is not coming, I'm afraid. He died to ensure we could bring this to you.'' <Offer Arcan'dor Fruit.>}}
: {{Text|say|Arluelle|I understand... He never could stay out of trouble...}}
: ''Arluelle eats the fruit.''
: {{Text|say|Arluelle|Thank you... I will remember this.}}
