==Objectives==
Plant rumors among members of [[House Duskmere]].
*Rumors Planted (3)
*Return to [[Ly'leth]] at the [[Waning Crescent]].

==Description==
[[Coryn Stelleris]] and [[Ruven Duskmere]] were close friends, but one always overshadowed the other.  Now the [[House Stelleris|Stelleris]] family stands to gain from lord Ruven's death.  Handsomely.

House Duskmere will soon learn of their loss.  I want you to be the one to redirect their anger and grief.

A handful of well placed rumors should do the trick.

I won't be lingering in this part of the city for long, and Ly'leth will want to know of your efforts.

Return to her when you are finished.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|38|80}}
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
How is my campaign faring, <name>?

==Completion==
The city is buzzing with very interesting gossip, <name>. Victory is that much closer.

==Notes==
;[[Distraught Noble]]
: Oh my dear Ruven...

: He was such a brash child, so full of pride.  I always knew he would take great power for his own some day.

: But not this... I did not see this coming.  Oh my child...

{{gossip|''There is talk in the streets that they found a silver crescent near his corpse- is that true?''}}

:{{Text|say|Distraught Noble|That is the symbol of House Stelleris... but that could not be.  Coryn was Ruven's dearest friend...}}
:{{Text|say|Distraught Noble|No, that's simply impossible...}}

;[[Disgruntled Servant]]
: I was personal attendant to lord Ruven himself.  Now I am reduced to delivering wine and sweets to petulant, coddled nobles with no real power or influence.

: Pathetic.

{{gossip|''I heard that Coryn Stelleris has begun to purchase the remaining Duskmere attendants - is that true?''}}
:{{Text|say|Disgruntled Servant|Absolutely NOT!  Why would he do such a thing?  Has he no honor?!}}
:{{Text|say|Disgruntled Servant|... Why WOULD he do such a thing...?}}

;[[Shamed Noble]]
: My lord Ruven promised such power, if he were to ascend to the palace.  I believed him!  I made plans!

: Now he is dead, and I cannot show my face without drawing stares.  I am ashamed.

: How could one such as he fall so low?

{{gossip|''I overheard a rather crude joke at poor Ruven's expense while visiting the Stelleris family.  I can't imagine you would want to hear it...''}}

:{{Text|say|Shamed Noble|Preposterous!  A joke at my lord's expense?  Only a madman would attempt it!}}
:{{Text|say|Shamed Noble|... But if anyone would laugh, it would be THEM.}}
