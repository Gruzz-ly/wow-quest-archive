==Objectives==
Speak with Ly'leth to begin the encounter.
*Talk to Ly'leth
*[[Coryn]] slain

==Description==
[[Tal'ashar]] is an honor duel.

If I lose, then I must forfeit my title to Coryn Stelleris.

<Ly'leth smiles gently.>

That is why you are going to fight for me.

I will grant you a more powerful disguise for this task, and together we will put Coryn in his place.

Speak to me when you are ready to battle on my behalf.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Moonglow Idol]]
*{{cost|38|80}}
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
I know you will defend my honor, <name>.

==Completion==
We made great strides today. I will not forget this.

All is going as planned. You do not need to worry.
