==Objectives==
Meet with [[Vanthir]] in [[Suramar City]].

==Description==
It is time for you to enter the city proper, <name>.

I am sending you to my loyal friend Vanthir. I do hope you remember him- I can guarantee that he remembers you.

I will not be able to accompany you, but I must stress that the disguise I have granted you is not impervious. Tread carefully, and avoid those who stare too long.

Farewell for now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
Glad you could make it. Your help is sorely needed here.
