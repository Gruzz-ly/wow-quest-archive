* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
:''Vanthir is alarmed, then relived.''
:{{text|say|Vanthir|He has been informing on us! We should feel fortunate we found him... the less the [[Elisande|Grand Magistrix]] knows the better.}}

==Notes==
Go to the building in [[Artisan's Gallery]] and head upstairs for the quest trigger. If the trigger isn't there, logging out and in should fix it.

;Hide at the Rendezvous location
:''The spy is followed inside by a female [[Nightborne Sergeant]] who walks in further and turns to face him.''
:{{text|say|Nightborne Sergeant|A list of traitors? You will have to get this to Lieutenant Piet at once.}}
:{{text|say|Nightborne Spy|As you wish. I will meet the Lieutenant where we met last. Send word for her to expect me.}}
:''The sergeant walks out first and up the stairs to the noble rooftop area, while the spy steps outside and activates his awareness circle.''

;Follow the Nightborne Spy
:''The spy heads east into [[Evermoon Commons]] and makes a stop by a group of guards.''
:{{text|say|Nightborne Spy|Keep an eye out for rebels. You can't be too careful.}}
:''He heads south towards [[Evermoon Bazaar]] and makes a detour to a group of Nightborne civilians.''
:{{text|say|Nightborne Spy|If you see someone stealing arcwine, report them at once!}}
:''He continues on route into the bazaar and heads for [[Lunar Lapidaries]]. (Be careful of [[Duskwatch Orbitist]]s.) Inside, Lieutenant Piet is waiting in the corner.''

;Too far
:{{text|bossemote|You are too far away! Move back in range before he gets away!}}

;Fail
:{{text|say|Nightborne Spy|Stop following me!}}

;Kill Lieutenant Piet
:''A moment after walking inside, Piet notices you and angrily kills the spy.''
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Piet|You fool, you were followed! To arms!}}
