==Objectives==
Speak with 8 [[Masqued Reveler]]s while in costume, then speak with [[Ly'leth Lunastre]].
*[[Enchanted Party Mask]]
*Wear the Enchanted Party Mask
*Speak with Masqued Revelers (8)
*Meet Ly'leth Lunastre

==Description==
Many [[nightborne]] had pinned their hopes on [[Thalyssra]] deposing the [[Elisande|Grand Magistrix]]. Since she disappeared, dissenting voices have grown silent.

We must spread the word, discreetly, among the populace. Ly'leth Lunastre will be a perfect ally in this. She is a socialite with many connections, and she is no friend of the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].

Ly'leth hosts a masquerade party at her estate where rumors are traded like coin - and brandished like daggers.

Let us invite ourselves in.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

==Completion==
That mask suits you.

In Suramar, it can be quite advantageous to be someone else for a time...

==Notes==
On accept:

:{{Text|say|Silgryn|We shall use the garden entrance.}}
:''Silgryn leads you to two tables with masks lying on them.''
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|Enchanted masks. Simply don the mask, and a magical costume will envelop your body.}}
: ''Silgryn activates a mask as he proceeds up the path, gaining a moth costume.''
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|It should be enough to fool the other guests, but stay clear of the guards.}}
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|I will find Ly'leth. You stay out of trouble.}}
: ''Silgryn starts running.''
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|Just enjoy the party for a bit. You know... mingle.}}

Walk around the [[Lunastre Estate]] and talk to 8 [[Masqued Reveler]]s. As instructed, stay clear of guards. If you walk within certain range of a guard, they will shout a warning and cast a spell that will dispel your disguise if you stay in the spell's radius (shown as a circle around the guard), after which the guards will become hostile and attack.

If you lose your disguise, reach a safe spot and reapply it.

You '''should''' have already completed [[Survey Says...]] to finish the [[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]] questline. In that case, don't forget to activate the nearby telemancy beacon, so you will have a permanent two-way portal to [[Shal'Aran]]!

;Meet Ly'leth Lunastre
: Ah, you must be the outlander Silgryn has told me about.

''{{gossip| Pleased to meet you, Lady Ly'leth.}}

: Well, aren't you charming?

After talking to eight revelers, approach Ly'leth, who Silgryn has found. You will walk in on her talking to her sibling, [[Anarys Lunastre]].

:{{Text|say|Ly'leth Lunastre|This is not up for debate, Anarys. You are either with us, or against us. Choose wisely.}}
:{{Text|say|Anarys Lunastre|I will hear no more of your scheming! You endanger everything [[Ran'thos Lunastre|our father]] worked for!}}
:''Anarys turns around and leaves.''
:{{Text|say|Ly'leth Lunastre|<sigh> Dear child... Do you not realize what he died for?}}
