'''The Perfect Opportunity''' is unlocked at 8,000 {{rep|Friendly}} [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Ly'leth Lunastre]] at the [[Waning Crescent]].
*Meet Ly'leth at the Waning Crescent

==Description==
I have heard whispers from [[Suramar City]].

Recent unrest in the city has prompted the nobles to seek another advisor to fill [[Elisande]]'s council.  Such positions are rarely offered and hotly contested.

This is the perfect opportunity and Ly'leth is the perfect candidate.  Fate smiles upon our cause!

I know she has historically chosen to avoid such politics and maneuvering, but we must now ask her to join the fray.

Seek her out at the Waning Crescent and ensure her victory.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
[[Thalyssra]] asks much of me.

==Completion==
Ahh, <name>.

So good to see you once again. I trust you are ready to assist me with my campaign.
