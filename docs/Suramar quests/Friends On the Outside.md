==Objectives==
Activate the teleporter pad and bring [[Vanthir]]'s gift to [[Thalyssra]].
* Activate Telemancy Beacon
* Deliver Vanthir's Gift to Thalyssra
* [[Gift-Wrapped Bottle of Arcwine]] (provided)

==Description==
You have done well for us here, but it is time for you to return to Thalyssra.

There is a teleporter pad nearby that has gone unused in recent years. See if you can reroute it and return to her that way.

Oh, and before you go:

<Vanthir hands you a wrapped bottle of [[Arcwine]].>

Take this to her, with my thanks for sending you. Let her know that your efforts helped replenish our Arcwine supplies and reunited a mother and child.

We are grateful beyond measure. Farewell for now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
A gift?  For me?

==Completion==
Vanthir is a very pleasant fellow.

==Notes==
Upon activating the beacon, it opens a permanent portal to [[Shal'Aran]].

:{{Text|say|[[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]]|The network is responding to a new beacon. Ah, hello again!}}
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Give me a moment- I am locking in your location now.}}

Upon returning to Shal'Aran, there are new faces about who have arrived from the new portal: [[Nightborne Rebel]]s, [[Nightfallen Rebel]]s, [[Suramar Refugee]]s, and [[Suramar Orphan]]s. [[Waning Crescent Porter]]s travel between the two locations in threes to transport supplies and practical creature comforts for the rebellion.  If you've done his quest line, [[Thaedris Feathersong]] is helping with cleaning.  [[Verene]] and [[Korine]] have also taken refuge here. Talk to Thalyssra.

: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|A gift, for me?}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|I will see that it is not wasted.  Well done, my friend.}}

Completing the quest also unlocks the ability to purchase the buffs [[Ward of the First Arcanist]], [[Warpwalking]], and [[Leyline Mastery]] at any time.
