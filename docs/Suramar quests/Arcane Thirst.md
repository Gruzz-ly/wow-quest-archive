==Objectives==
Enter [[Shal'Aran]] and find something to sate [[Thalyssra]]'s thirst. 
* Search Shal'Aran
* [[Keeper Selentia]] slain
* [[Crystallized Ancient Mana]] (6)

==Description==
My people have subsisted on the [[Nightwell]] for millennia.  [[Ancient Mana|Ancient mana]] is our lifeblood - without it, we become... well, you saw them out there.

<Thalyssra holds her flask aloft, gently shaking free the last precious drops.>

I'm afraid I have been rather reckless today.

Already, my senses are dulling.  Without magic to feed upon, I will turn.

Please... find me something to feed upon... anything...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16450 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Cloak of the Everliving Keeper]]
*[[Ancient Keeper's Brooch]]

==Progress==
<Thalyssra's eyes have dulled and her body is shaking uncontrollably.>

==Completion==
<Thalyssra takes the crystals with a trembling hand.>

==Notes==
The six crystals are around the broken column on the central platform of Shal'Aran. Upon approaching it, [[Keeper Selentia]] spawns. She is initially invulnerable, so don't bother attacking her right away. Instead, kill the two [[Arcane Tether]]s that are channeling energy beams into her.

Periodically she will summon [[Ancient Keeper]]s. You can mostly ignore them and go straight for Selentia.

:{{Text|bossemote|Selentia wails, calling forth ancient keepers!}}

Upon killing both Arcane Tethers:
:{{Text|bossemote|The tethers have broken. Selentia is vulnerable!}}

Now you can kill her normally, even as a melee class, although she appears to be flying high in the air.

Completing this quest awards the "Nightfall" criterion of [[Nightfallen But Not Forgotten]].
