==Objectives==
Remove insulting items from the elven war camps.
* Insults removed (5)

==Description==
My army is disciplined, and they will follow my order not to engage the [[kaldorei]] in combat unless I give the command.

However, it is with some level of shame that I must admit both armies have been attempting to harass the other with pranks, littering our respective camps with insults.

Please, <name>, we need someone both armies respects to collect these items before fighting breaks out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]
*+250 reputation with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
We elves are long lived, but not as long lived as our prejudices it would seem.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Hopefully, since our forces saw you performing this task they will come to their senses and stop this harassment.

==Notes==
The five offending items are split between both elven camps.

;Insults
*''"We found your mounts..."'': A crate with a few eggs and a chicken, in reference to the blood elves' [[hawkstrider]] mounts.
*''Replacement Sunwell'': See [[Sunwell]].
*''"Didn't want you to get the shakes..."'': A mana potion, both of which reference the [[Blood elf|blood elves]]' addiction to magic.
*''"Just wanted you to feel at home, mon."'': A [[troll]] tiki. Probably a reference to the long history of conflict between the two races, particularly over land.
*''"Your Ancestors"'': A small statue of a [[witch doctor]], in reference to the night elves being of troll descent (as are ''all'' elves, given that they're descended from night elves, but night elves most directly).
