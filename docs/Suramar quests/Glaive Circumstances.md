==Objectives==
Retrieve [[Lyana Darksorrow]]'s [[glaive]]s.
*[[Lyana's Wrathful Warglaive]]
*[[Lyana's Vengeful Warglaive]]

==Description==
I came here on a mission to slay the [[demon]] [[eredar]], [[Azoran]]. During my infiltration, I was shot down from my [[felbat]] and captured.

I'm not going to mince words, <name>. Azoran plans to use the [[Burning Legion]] [[command ship]] to destroy [[Dalaran]].

To stop him, I will need my [[warglaive]]s that were lost during my fall from the sky. I would retrieve them myself, but I'm still weakened from my imprisonment.

Search for the warglaives on the northern side of the crater, where I was shot down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
Do you have my glaives, <race>?

==Completion==
Thank you. Now that my warglaives are returned, I will bring ruin upon [[Felsoul Hold]].

My wrath is unending and my vengeance swift.

==Progression==
{{Breaking The Lightbreaker‎}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
