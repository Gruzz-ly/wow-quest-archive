==Objectives==
Use the Advanced Telemancy Beacon to survey Evermoon Commons, Evermoon Bazaar, and Siren's Vigil in [[Suramar City]]. 
* [[Evermoon Commons]] surveyed (100)
* [[Evermoon Bazaar]] surveyed (100)
* [[Siren's Vigil]] surveyed (100)
* [[Advanced Telemancy Beacon]] (provided)

==Description==
The conduit we need is in the [[Arcway]], and security in the Arcway has doubled [[The Arcway: Opening the Arcway|since your]] [[The Arcway: Long Buried Knowledge|last visit]].

Our only reasonable option is to teleport your strike team directly in.

This is a long-range teleport to a non-anchored destination.  In other words, it will be hard.

Take this beacon and survey the commons in Suramar City, then return the beacon to me so I can analyze the results.

This will help me teleport you as close as possible to the conduit!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|Enchanted Nightborne Coin
}}

==Progress==
Imagine firing an arrow at the sky in hopes of hitting an acorn at the far end of the forest.

This teleport will be a little harder, but I think I can do it.

==Completion==
Excellent. With this, the chances of me teleporting you all to the bottom of the sea are much lower!

==Gains==
* +100 reputation with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Notes==
The quickest way is to use the Waning Crescent portal in [[Shal'Aran]]. After that, simply use the beacon at the three locations marked on the map, like on Oculeth's previous quests.

For the Commons and the Bazaar, the safest way is to grapple up the north building beside [[Deline]]'s gondola dock, which stands in the middle of both areas, and use the beacon on the roof.
