==Objectives==
Use the Advanced Telemancy Beacon to survey the [[Terrace of Order]] in [[Suramar City]].
*Terrace of Order surveyed (100)
*[[Advanced Telemancy Beacon]] (provided)

==Description==
Never a dull moment! Well... perhaps this is not entirely true.

I'm afraid I must ask you once more to return to the city to gather information. But this is not just any information - this is information extraction!

I require specific coordinates to allow me to focus my teleportations with extreme accuracy. It will, unfortunately, take a bit of time to dig through the information once retrieved, but no matter. We have plenty else to do in the meantime. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*1,650 [[XP]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
Let's hope this survey is our last. I grow quite tired watching you run around all day.

==Completion==
I will begin analyzing this data at once.

For now, let us turn our attention to more... <Oculeth touches his fingertips together in succession.>

...interesting technological advances.

==Notes==
Take the teleporter to the [[Sanctum of Order]]. Exit the room and take the stairs going up on the left. Turn left once you reach the top of the stairs and continue straight ahead through the hall. Go either left or right at the end (doesn't matter which) and enter the outdoors area.

Using the [[Advanced Telemancy Beacon]] will remove your [[Masquerade]] disguise, so pick a spot where you won't be attacked by patrolling groups of mobs. An excellent place to do this is the fountain right in front of you already, up against the side of the statue opposite from [[Thoramir]].

You will need to use the beacon 10 times since you gain 10 "units" per use. It may be helpful if you temporarily [[hotkey]] the beacon to your action bar to ease its use.

If you have somehow done the survey but are unable to complete the quest, you need to go into the Terrace of Order to trigger Oculeth's dialogue (which is a hidden quest requirement).

;Reach the terrace
:{{text|say|[[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]]|Excellent. Begin when ready. Use the surveyor and follow the alignment indicator. Uh... the light. Just follow the light!}}

;Surveying completed
:{{text|say|Chief Telemance Oculeth|That shall suffice for now. This positional data will enhance-- Oh, nevermind. You did a fine job.}}
