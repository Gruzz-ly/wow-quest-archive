==Objectives==
Obtain the Charged Arcshaper Staff and a Volatile Construct Core for [[Magus Sendath|Sendath]].
*[[Volatile Construct Core]]
*[[Charged Arcshaper Staff]]

==Description==
The magus in charge of the defenses here is powerful. Perhaps too strong, even for the both of us.

Fortunately, the [[sin'dorei]] know a thing or two about magic. The mage's barrier is strong, but we are clever.

He has somehow channeled enough energy into his staff to power another set of defense portals, but he has left it out of his sight. Bring me the staff and an energy source from one of those constructs. I should be able to create just the thing we need to take that shield out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
It is really child's play when you consider the magical weaves. I can see the flaws with just a few minutes of study.

==Completion==
Excellent work. The weapon will provide the proper housing, and the magical signatures on the core will let me bypass...

==Notes==
The staff is an object, picked up where the map shows it. The core drops from any arcane construct in the general area around the staff.
