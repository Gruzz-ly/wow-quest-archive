==Objectives==
Speak to [[Vanthir]].

==Description==
This is just... unspeakable.

[[Margaux]] risked everything to get these [[mana wyrm]]s to us.  I cannot let it end this way.

I need you to find someone who can make this right.  Someone who will do whatever it takes to see [[Overseer Durant]] slain.

Speak with Vanthir.  I am certain he will know exactly who we need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
Steel yourself, <name>.

Margaux's loss is regrettable, but not likely to be the last in this effort. Far from it, I fear.

==Progression==
{{Blood and Wine}}

==Patch changes==
