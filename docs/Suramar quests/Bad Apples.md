==Objectives==
Gather 8 Shadowbloom.
* [[Shadowbloom]] (8)

==Description==
That fruit over there? That's a pale imitation to what I can grow.

But that accursed [[Daglir]] somehow manages to gain the favor of the courts, so we must dine on mediocrity!

We must teach Daglir a lesson for stealing my crop, but we must be discreet.

Outside the shield grows a purple flower called Shadowbloom. Fetch some for me and we'll make sure that he pays dearly for his insolence!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|19|40|}}
|Token of a Master Cultivator

==Progress==
I would avoid eating any food until you've washed your hands.

==Completion==
Excellent. This will be enough for my purposes.

==Gains==
* 16,450 [[XP]]

#* [[Bad Apples]]
#* [[Blast of Spice Fish]]
