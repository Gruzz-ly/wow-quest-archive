==Objectives==
* [[Loyalist Sycophant]]s slain (20)
* [[Telemancy Orbs (world quest)]] (provided)

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]]|My preparations are complete. Let us see how the ''nobles'' of Suramar react to the warp-delivery of ''Withered!''}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
: {{text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|What delicious irony! Chaos erupts among the nobles as those they cast out are warped onto their very doorsteps!}}

==Notes==
Without flying, you can go to {{coords|57|65|Suramar}} at [[Moonlit Landing]] and go into the two-story building by the harbor (if you've done [[Court of Stars]], it's the very first one you enter at the beginning from the gondola). The ground floor has two Sycophants. Go to the other entrance upstairs, with another Sycophant on the bed, and outside there are groups of Sycophants. Once you've used your Telemancy Orbs to spawn enough whithered in the room to your liking, you can aggro the groups as you like, pulling them back towards the room. Once you get close, the whithered will run out to attack the target and any other aggroed mobs.
