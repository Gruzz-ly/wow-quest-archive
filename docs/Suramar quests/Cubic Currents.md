==Objectives==
Obtain 300 Ancient Mana from [[Suramar]]

* [[Ancient Mana]] (300)

==Description==
To determine this [[Mysterious Cube|cube]]'s purpose, we need to power it up. Hmm, I have an idea...

The [[Nightborne]] covet a substance you are no doubt familiar with called ancient mana. Should be just the thing for a relic this old. Gather a sufficient quantity and we'll attempt to get it working.

Be careful in Suramar! It would be a shame if this curious cube were lost and became a memory once more.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you: [[Mana Infusion]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
I trust you obtained all the ancient mana we need to infuse the cube?
