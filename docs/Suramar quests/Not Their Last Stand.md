==Objectives==
Dissuade 5 Lingering [[Moonfall Hippogryph]]s
*Hippogryphs Sent Away (5)

==Description==
I've been watching you- you are not with them. <[[Ivanel Meadowsong|Ivanel]] coughs quietly.> I am not long for this world, but there is one thing I would have you do while you are here. The [[hippogryph]]s here still fight bitterly to defend their home and their companions in the [[Moon Guard]]. They have not accepted that the Guard is no more. Please... send them away. Let them know there is nothing left for them to fight for here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you. I feel better knowing they will not continue to sacrifice themselves for us.
