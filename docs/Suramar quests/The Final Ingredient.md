==Objectives==
Find [[Latara]]'s bow.
*[[Latara's Bow]]

==Description==
The potion is complete, <name>. Soon our journey will be over. There is one last thing I would have you do for me, then you shall have your reward.

My wife's bow was kept here, but I have not been able to find it after searching everywhere. There is potent [[magic]] in it.

I fear one of the restless [[ghost|spirits]] may have taken it, but it would take a powerful force to pick up an item such as this. Be careful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
What was that? I heard a familiar voice... it couldn't be.

==Completion==
You saw Latara? What happened?

... I see. I am so sorry I failed you, my love.

==Notes==
To the east, Latara has risen as a [[banshee]].
