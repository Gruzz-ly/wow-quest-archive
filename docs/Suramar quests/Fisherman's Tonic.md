==Objectives==

*[[Axetail Eyeball]] (4)
*[[Sashj'tar Air Bladder]]
*[[Siren Blood]]

==Description==
If you detest these serpents as much as we do, I ask that you continue the fight against them.

That will mean fighting them in their watery domain. I don't see any gills on you, so we're going to have to concoct an old tonic used by [[vrykul]] fishermen.

The ingredients are plentiful around here, taken that you do not mind picking through entrails.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Draught of Seawalking|id=196344|Grants water breathing and increases sea floor movement speed by 80% while in the Azuregale Bay.|icon=inv_elemental_primal_water}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
I will help you collect what we need.

==Completion==
<Brandolf mixes the concoction together.>

Well, I never said that it would taste good. Bottom's up.
