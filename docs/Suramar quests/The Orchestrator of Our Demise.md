==Objectives==
Slay Conjurer Thalerian and acquire the Astromancer's Keystone.
* [[Conjurer Thalerian]] slain
* [[Astromancer's Keystone]]

==Description==
Conjurer Thalerian must be stopped.

He immediately sought out my father's private study when he arrived and he has not yet emerged.  I worry that he may have found a very dangerous item.

It is called the Astromancer's Keystone.  It is used to manipulate the [[Moon Guard Stronghold|stronghold]]'s defenses.

Such [[magic]] was meant to protect the [[Moon Guard]]- used for any other purpose and it becomes unspeakably destructive.

Retrieve the Keystone.  Slay Conjurer Thalerian to get it, if you must.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Astromancer's Compass]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
They had no right to this power. Thank you.

== Notes ==
Use [[Overwhelming Distraction]] to get to Thalerian. The stairs to go further up and find Syrana are nearby him.

==Progression==
{{Moon Guard Stronghold}}
