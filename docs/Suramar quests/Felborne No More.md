==Objectives==
Slay 8 Felborne and their leader, Valthis Ama'ran, at the [[Felborne Outpost]] in [[Crimson Thicket]].
*[[Valthis Ama'ran]] slain
*Felborne slain (8)
*[[Experimental Telemancy Orb]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Felborne]] have begun to expand their grasp beyond the [[Suramar City|city]]'s reach. A camp to the east in the Crimson Thicket is of a particular interest to us. Their outpost leader, Valthis Ama'ran, serves [[Andaris Narassin|Andaris]] directly.

Now is the time to put our withered training and [[Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Oculeth]]'s device to the test. We cannot allow them to advance any further, <name>.

Head for the camp and use the orb to sever the head of the beast. The time has come to begin our advance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Fel-Dipped Blade]]

==Progress==
Has the threat been removed?

==Completion==
Our efforts have proven quite successful. I believe we are just about ready to make our stand.

==Criteria of==
*[[Insurrection]]

==Notes==
Kill: [[Felborne Energist]], [[Felborne Collaborator]], [[Felblade Protector]], [[Felborne Magus]], and [[Felborne Marauder]].

Take the portal to [[Twilight Vineyards]] and head northeast to Felborne Outpost. Throwing the orb will summon three [[Resistant Withered]] to temporarily assist you. Once done with your business at the outpost, return to the nearby vineyards and use the portal to [[Shal'Aran]].
