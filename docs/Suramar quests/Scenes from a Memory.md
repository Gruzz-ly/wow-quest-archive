==Objectives==
Help [[Thalyssra]] complete the arcane communion with [[Theryn]].
*Complete the Arcane Communion

==Description==
Theryn is at the mercy of his own mind.  Whatever we find in there, it may be difficult to control.

I will need your help to sort through the visions, so be ready for anything.

With any luck, we will discover what makes Theryn special.  And... whether there is anything left of who he used to be.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|Enchanted Nightborne Coin
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
The [[withered]]... Not only do they suffer a burning thirst for the [[Nightwell]], but their own memories torture them as well.

Truly a fate worse than death...

==Notes==
Click on ghostly images that spawn around Thalyssra and Theryn during the communion to dismiss them and proceed with the quest.

: ''Thalyssra leads Theryn away from the aperture to the space near the outer wall, where there is plenty of room.''

:''Thalyssra channels a purple beam into Theryn.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|I feel them. His memories.}}
: ''The nightborne now known as Theryn talks with a woman with a little girl.  They are interrupted by guards, two women and a man, all armed, that confront Theryn.  The woman, perhaps his wife, kneels to comfort the crying girl.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|The day he was exiled...}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Dismiss these memories so we can proceed.}}
:''Images of three saber cats advancing on nightfallen Theryn appear.  He backs up in fear and shakes from hunger.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|This hunger... this fear...}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|I, too have felt it...}}

:''Withered Theryn runs about aimlessly, mindlessly.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Such confusion... such ''rage''...}}
: ''Five more withered appear and start doing the same, while Thalyssra becomes strained and distressed.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|I am losing control...}}
: ''Arcane lighting starts to fire from above.  The first memory appears, then saber cats circling the space along with nightfallen, then multiple withered and the figures keep on multiplying.  Thalyssra is in pain and close to breaking.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Agh!! Make them stop! ''Please'' make them stop!}}
: ''Though you dismiss as many and as fast as possible, there is no way to keep up.  Straining, Thalyssra screams in pain.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|AAIGHH!!}}
: ''Straining, she manages to gather her strength and with a shout, uses an Arcane Explosion-like spell to clear all the memories, breaking the channel.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Nnngh- ENOUGH!!}}
:''An image appears of Theryn finding a [[Moonshade Relic|mysterious relic]] on a pedestal.  Thalyssra turns to look at it.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|There... you found something, didn't you?}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Something which gave you peace...}}
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|A peace we so desperately need for ourselves.}}
: ''As Theryn's memory walks away from the pedestal and Theryn himself returns to the aperture, Thalyssra kneels in fatigue.  Concerned, Valtrois runs over.''
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Thalyssra! Are you alright?}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|I... I am fine.}}
: ''She sounds tired, but stands nonetheless.  They walk back to the aperture.''
