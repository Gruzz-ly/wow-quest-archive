==Objectives==
Search [[Estate of the First Arcanist|Thalyssra's estate]] and collect 3 [[Amplifier Fragment]]s. Combine them into an Arcane Amplifier.
*[[Arcane Amplifier (item)]]

==Description==
While you were busy in the city I reached a roadblock in my [[withered]] research.

I feel I am close to overcoming this barrier, but I'm afraid I cannot do so without some more advanced tools.

I hid among my possessions an item called an Arcane Amplifier.  It does precisely what its name entails.

It is more than likely that [[Elisande|the Magistrix]] ordered my estate dismantled.  If the Amplifier remains, it will be in fragments.

Recover the whole, if you can.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Arcane Amplification|id=226862|Increase the maximum amount of Ancient Mana you can carry by 200.|icon=inv_drink_22}}

You will also receive:
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]
*{{cost|20|60}}
* 16,870 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
Did you find it?

==Completion==
How lucky we are that it could be recovered... thank you.

==Notes==
Go to the [[Estate of the First Arcanist]] ­at sea level at the very eastern edge of Suramar City.

Upon assembling the Arcane Amplifier:

:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|You've done it! Guard it well until you can return to me.}}

Upon returning to Shal'Aran with this quest ready for turn-in, a cutscene plays. The [[arcan'dor]] is growing!
