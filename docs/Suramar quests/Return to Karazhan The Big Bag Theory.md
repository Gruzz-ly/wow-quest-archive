==Objectives==
Recover a Bag of a Thousand Pockets and a Fel Sinew Bag from [[Return to Karazhan|Karazhan]].
* [[Bag of a Thousand Pockets]]
* [[Fel Sinew Bag]]

==Description==
I'm sure you've heard, <name>, that a bigger bag is always better. I disagree. I believe it's the quality of the bag that makes all the difference.

Just look at those tattered things around your person. They make you look... well, quite plain.

I'll prove it to you. Allegedly there are some bags in [[Karazhan]] that hold an almost infinite amount of items, but the materials required to make such bags are... well, you'll see.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Imbued Silkweave Bag]]

==Progress==
After this lesson, I trust I won't have to prove anything further to you.

==Completion==
Now, look closely.

<Tytallo goes into a lengthy explanation concerning the thread count, weaving techniques, and other miscellaneous details that, to a tailor, are fascinating.>

You still seem confused. Here, take the pattern and see for yourself. Perhaps then you'll learn a thing or two.

==Notes==
*[[Leyweaver Tytallo]] is in [[Suramar]], on the [[Grand Promenade (Suramar)|Grand Promenade]] in the building where you craft [[Imbued Silkweave]] items.
*[[Bag of a Thousand Pockets]] drops from [[Moroes (Return to Karazhan tactics)|Moroes]], the last boss in [[Return to Karazhan|Lower Karazhan]] (''Legion'' dungeon).
*[[Fel Sinew Bag]] drops from [[Viz'aduum the Watcher]], the last boss in Upper Karazhan.
