[[File:Volpin.jpg|thumb|[[Volpin]] the Fox.]]
Head to [[Suramar]] and confront [[Herald Gevedaun]] near the [[Feathermane Hunting Grounds]].{{Co|17.42|31.56|Suramar}} On aggro:
:{{Text|Say|Herald Gevedaun|How did you get this invitation? Never mind, the hunt's already started!}}

On death:
:{{Text|Say|Herald Gevedaun|Fine, fine! They went that way. Not that it matters, you will never catch up...}}

Next, the player needs to find Volpin, who is located at the base of a tree at {{Co|30.07|35.58|Suramar}}. He is not targetable and his specific location is not marked on the minimap, only the general area he's in, making him harder to find than most quest objectives. As soon as the player approaches him, an event occurs.
:{{Text|bossemote|<Volpin quivers with fear>}}

Four [[Nightborne Fox Hunter]]s spawn nearby. Kill them, then interact with Volpin who has now turned friendly and interactable.
:{{Text|bossemote|<Volpin leaps with joy>}}

The quest completes automatically, granting the player the [[Reins of the Llothien Prowler|Llothien Prowler]] mount and causing Volpin to despawn.
