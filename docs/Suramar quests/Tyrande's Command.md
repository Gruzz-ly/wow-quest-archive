==Objectives==
Speak with [[Tyrande Whisperwind]] in [[Meredil]].

==Description==
[[Shal'Aran|Shal'aran]] is bursting at the seams with refugees and rebels. We practically have an army now but not enough weapons or mana to keep everyone armed and un-[[withered]].

And in all of this, Tyrande has a battery of requests I simply do not have the time to deal with.

Will you go to her? Her growing army is hard to miss in Meredil.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The Nightfallen insisted on being a part in this conflict. There is more work to be done than people we have.

==Progression==
{{Crafting War}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.1.0|note=Added.}}
