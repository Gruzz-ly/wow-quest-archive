==Objectives==
Attack the [[Elisande|Magistrix]]'s [[arcwine]] shipment and bring [[Arluin]] his cut of the stolen goods.
*[[Thousand-Year Arcwine]] stolen

==Description==
I'm not rich in anything but information, but maybe that can be of use to someone with your skills.  You helped me, now you can help yourself.

The Magistrix receives a daily shipment of arcwine, which travels to the palace with a heavy escort.  I can share the location, provided you leave me a cut of the goods.

One of my men has infiltrated the group and will hold up the delivery long enough for you to strike.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|20|60}}
*16,870 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
Where's my cut?

==Completion==
Pleasure doing business with you.

==Notes==
: ''At the [[Twilight Vineyards]], Arluin's man is disguised as one of the four [[Vineyard Porter]]s, carrying a cask under each arm.  [[Spellsinger Quiris]] leads two [[Magisterial Escort]]s.  They are confronting Arluin's man, who has "accidently" dropped his casks, one of which is leaking arcwine onto the ground.''
: {{text|say|Spellsinger Quiris|This shipment is worth more than you are!  How dare you treat it so carelessly!}}
: {{text|say|Vineyard Porter|My hand slipped!  Forgive me!}}

: {{text|say|Vineyard Porter|Flee!  The Magistrix will kill us for failing her!}}
: ''They abandon their casks and run off, and Arluin's man stays.''
: {{text|say|Vineyard Porter|Thank you.}}
: ''He stands and runs off in the same direction.''
: {{text|say|Vineyard Porter|Take the arcwine.  I am getting out of here.}}
