==Objectives==
Speak with Lady Liadrin in Meredil.

==Description==
[[Shal'Aran]] is bursting at the seams with refugees and rebels. We practically have an army now but not enough weapons or mana to keep everyone armed and un-withered.

And in all of this, [[Lady Liadrin]] has a battery of requests I simply do not have the time to deal with.

Will you go to her? Her growing army is hard to miss in [[Meredil]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I can relate to [[First Arcanist Thalyssra|Thalyssra]]'s frustration.

I remember when I launched my first offensive. I swear I didn't eat or sleep for a week.

==Notes==
Lady Liadrin is located at the blood elf encampment southeast of [[Shal'Aran]], under a canopy.

==Progression==
{{Crafting War}}

==Patch changes==
