==Objectives==
Speak with [[Arcanist Valtrois]].

==Description==
Our [[Ley line|leyline]] feed grows stronger.

The more powerful our feed becomes, the more I learn about [[Ancient Mana|ancient mana]] itself.

Of course, as my apprentice, you may reap the benefits of my discoveries.  Listen well, and I will teach you how to extract power from your enemies more reliably.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you: [[Ancient Mana Scavenging]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*8,230 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
Do your best to pick this up the first time - I do hate repeating myself.

==Notes==
This quest will appear after five leyline feeds are activated.
