==Objectives==
Imbue the inert waters with the ritual bundle, then witness the well's creation.
*Inert Waters Imbued
*Ritual Completed
*[[Ritual Bundle]] (provided)

==Description==
You have done very well, <race>.

All that is left is to combine their blessings into the ritual bundle and imbue the [[Moonwell]]. Once that is done, Mayruna will add a little water from a purified Moonwell and this land will be protected so long as we inhabit it.

This is a momentous occasion, my friend. You bear witness to a sacred rite not often performed in the company of strangers.

I will let you do the honors- simply place the ritual bundle into the sacred waters and we will do the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|38|80}}
*20,560 [[XP]]
*[[Enchanted Moonwell Waters]]

==Progress==
You witness history, <race>.

==Completion==
Your assistance made this all possible. Thank you.

==Notes==
Upon completing the ritual:

: ''Mayruna, Mythandros, Solendra and Mardranel step up to the well and channel their powers.  A large flash of druidic magic flares in the well, along with a large moonbeam that encompasses it.  The [[Val'sharah Refugee]]s celebrate as [[Starflutter]] happily flies up circles briefly above it.
:{{Text|say|Mayruna Moonwing|It is done!}}
:{{Text|say|Mythandros Irongrove|This moonwell will nourish and protect everything around it. We can finally call this place home.}}
: ''Solendra and Mardranel bow as they speak in turn.''
:{{Text|say|Solendra Featherdown|Thank you!}}
:{{Text|say|Mardranel Forestheart|Thank you.}}

If you go check on the underground chamber back in [[Shal'Aran]], several Val'sharah Refugees have moved in, growing new plant life and making the area a druid's haven.
