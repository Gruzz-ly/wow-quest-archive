==Objectives==
Complete the "All In" scenario.

[[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]] can begin the scenario.

* [[Nightflow Conduit]] sabotaged
* Check on [[Arluin]]
* Enter [[Shal'Aran]]

==Description==
It is time to put our plan into action.

Oculeth will send you, Arluin and myself into the [[Arcway]], where we shall trigger a manastorm in the Nightflow Conduit.

[[Valtrois]] will stay here and prepare Shal'Aran for a massive jolt of arcane power - hopefully enough to satisfy the [[arcan'dor]].

<Name>...  We have a saying...  "To lead is to stand alone." It means only those who bear the weight of leadership can truly appreciate it.

Thank you for standing beside me. In truth, I do not feel alone.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|Residual Manastorm Energy
}}

* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
Behold. The redemption of the Nightfallen.

==Notes==
[[File:VZ-Arcway-t1.jpg|thumb|[[Arcway]] map]]
Upon returning to turn in the previous three quests:

: ''Arluin is sitting in the smallest archway, with his back against the wall.  He gets up and walks to the top part of the stairs, addressing the other Nightborne.''
:{{Text|say|Arluin|I heard about this crazy job you guys are planning. You weren't thinking of leaving me out, were you?}}
:{{Text|say|[[First Arcanist Thalyssra]]|I thought you were only interested in lining your pockets.}}
: ''Arluin walks down and onto the map of [[Suramar City]] as he speaks.''
:{{Text|say|Arluin|Look, I am not blind. I see what is happening in Suramar.}}
: ''He turns and steps over to properly face the others.''
:{{Text|say|Arluin|I am not sitting this one out. The stakes are too high. So I am ''in'', you got that?}}
:{{Text|say|Arluin|Oh and don't worry about my usual fee - you can pay me when the job is done.}}

On accept:

:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|I will teleport you in past the main defenses. When you are ready to leave, activate this beacon so I can locate you and pull you back.}}
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Now this is important - once the manastorm gets going, there will be too much interference for me to teleport anyone. You must get out before the storm!}}
:{{Text|say|Arluin|Get in, plant the device, get out before it goes off. Not the most complicated job I have been on.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|But the most important, by far. If we fail, Suramar is doomed.}}
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Alright everybody, gather in close. Do not be shy now. Group hug.}}

Oculeth teleports you, Thalyssra and Arluin into a phased version of the [[Arcway]], beginning the scenario.

===Stage 1: Hitting the Books===
: ''Slay the Duskwatch Archivists to escape the [[Forgotten Library]].''
* [[Duskwatch Archivist]] slain (3)

:{{Text|say|Arluin|This is not looking real conduit-y. You sure the old man knows his stuff?}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Yes. We are close.}}

===Stage 2: The Nightflow Conduit===
: ''Reach the door to the [[Nightflow Conduit]].''
* Reach the door to the Nightflow Conduit.

Follow Thalyssra and Arluin. Soon you will run into the bane of all adventurers: a locked door.

===Stage 3: Knock Knock===
: ''Defend Arluin while he opens the door to the Nightflow Conduit.''
* Defend Arluin while he opens the door to the Nightflow Conduit.

:{{Text|say|Arluin|I never met a lock I could not open.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Look out!}}
:{{Text|say|Arluin|Just give me one moment.}}

The enemies come in waves, filling the progress bar as they are defeated. Thalyssra will assist you in defending the door while Arluin is opening it.

===Stage 4: E.M.P.===
: ''Place the Ephemeral Manastorm Projector in the Nightflow Conduit.''
* Place the E.M.P.

:{{Text|say|Arluin|Whatever you gotta do, do it quick! Lots of guards heading our way.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|There! Place the manastorm generator near the conduit.}}

===Final Stage: Weather the Storm===
: ''Survive the manastorm.''
* Survive the manastorm.

:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Something is wrong... The temporal warp sequencer-}}
:{{Text|say|Arluin|Small words, please.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|The fuse is broken. We must trigger the manastorm manually.}}
:{{Text|say|Arluin|Wait, aren't we supposed to leave BEFORE the storm starts?}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|We have no choice. This must be done.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Rath, anu'telar!}}
:''Thalyssra erects an energy barrier.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|We just need to hold out until the storm is over!}}
:{{Text|say|Arluin|Easier said than done...}}

Again, defeat waves of enemies assaulting the barrier. Thankfully, they get damaged when trying to cross it.

At 96% progress:

:{{Text|say|Arluin|The manastorm is only getting stronger! We need to shut that thing down!}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|It is too dangerous! The arcane torrents would tear us apart!}}
:{{Text|say|Arluin|Damn it...}}
:{{Text|say|Arluin|You guys owe me...}}
:''Arluin runs out of the barrier, towards the projector.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|What are you doing?!}}
:{{Text|yell|Arluin|Hhghh-AAAHHHH!!!}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Arluin! NO!!}}
:''Arluin disables the projector, and the manastorm subsides. Thalyssra dispels her barrier and runs to kneel over the unconscious Arluin.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|''Oculeth, get us out of here!''}}

You are teleported back to [[Meredil]], ending the scenario.

:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Where is Arluin?!}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Oh no...}}
:''Thalyssra rushes across the stream to a wounded Arluin lying just outside the entrance to [[Shal'Aran]].''
:{{Text|say|Arluin|<cough> Nghh...}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Do not speak. You are wounded-}}
:{{Text|say|Arluin|We pulled it off... <wheeze> didn't we?}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Yes. You saved us. Please... try to rest.}}
:{{Text|say|Arluin|Hey... <cough> Tell [[Vanthir]] I said... thanks... for every...}}
:''Arluin dies.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|He is gone.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Come... Let us check on the others.}}

Upon entering Shal'Aran, a short cutscene is played. The arcan'dor is now fully grown, its bough covering almost the entire ceiling, with vines hanging down from its branches.
