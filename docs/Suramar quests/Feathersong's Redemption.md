This is the final quest of Thaedris's questline.

==Objectives==
Slay the Cliffclutch Matriarch.
* [[Cliffclutch Matriarch]] slain
* [[Thaedris's Elixir]] (provided)

==Description==
I must confess I was not entirely honest with you, <name>. I meant to drink the potion and join [[Latara|my wife]].

And even she was taken from her rest... I cannot fail her again. I must live and do what I can to stop this coming storm to be worthy of joining her.

Come, young one. Let us take care of the [[harpy]] matriarch and restore [[Tel'anor]] to its former glory. We cannot let this poison go to waste, eh?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Love-Laced Arrow]]

== Progress ==
It will take time, but Tel'anor will flourish again.  I swear it on my life.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. You have given me clarity of purpose and a reason to live again. Together we will save [[Suramar]] and atone for the sins of [[Nightborne|my people]].
