==Description==
I am, and always will be, a student of robemaking and dressmaking. You can keep your gloves, belts, and cloaks. Nothing beats a good robe.

I'll share my pattern for an imbued silkweave robe with you if you can teach me some of the robe and dress patterns you've learned along your tailoring journey.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Imbued Silkweave Robe]] pattern

You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I never turn down the opportunity to learn a new robe pattern.

==Completion==
Not quite what I'd expected, but it was an interesting history lesson, at least. You can keep the robes, I've learned all I need just by watching you work.

Now, as promised, I shall show you what I know.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Leyweaver Mithrogane|Your hemming is impressive. This pattern, though... I could take it or leave it.}}

;Spiritmend Robe
:{{Text|say|Leyweaver Mithrogane|I really enjoy this pattern, <name>. It has a classic feel to it, but the embroidery is so intriguing and unique.}}
