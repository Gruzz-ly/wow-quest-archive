==Objectives==
* East Beacon Activated
* West Beacon Activated
* [[Duskwatch]] Attackers slain (8)

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[First Arcanist Thalyssra]]|We are ready to begin the offensive in [[Suramar]]. Place beacons along the city's outskirts and draw the [[withered]] down upon the [[Elisande|Magistrix's]] forces!}}

==Completion==
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|The enemy breaks before the scores of withered we have unleashed! Keep training them, for the withered will prove invaluable in the days to come.}}

== Gains ==
* +250 reputation with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

== Notes ==
On foot, it would probably easiest to use the [[Twilight Vineyards]] portal. Go to the northwest and toward the border of the shield, where Duskwatch are fighting [[Withered Swarmer]]s. The [[Leypulse Beacon]]s are in the woods.

Be careful of using AOE attacks or trap-like abilities that you can't control; there are Heartwood deer that wander the area, and you could easily aggro a group by accident.
