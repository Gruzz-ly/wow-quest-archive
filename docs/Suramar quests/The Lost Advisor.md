Both [[The Lost Advisor]] and [[An Ancient Recipe]] are available at the beginning.

==Objectives==
Collect 8 Cliffthorn.
*Gather [[Cliffthorn]] (8)

==Description==
You may as well assist me while you are here. I require a potion to be made, one that will set things right.

I must conserve my energy until my task is finished, lest I become like these miserable wretches scrabbling at the cobblestones. There is coin in it for you, since I will not be needing it soon.

The [[harpy|harpies]] around here cannot resist cliffthorn. It is what drew them to [[Tel'anor]] in the first place. 

You should find plenty just outside this building.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Thaedris seems lost in thought as he gazes towards the [[Suramar City|city of Suramar]].>

==Completion==
<Thaedris stirs from his thoughts as you approach.>

These will be sufficient, <race>.

Cliffthorn is a deadly poison, and will be perfect for my needs.

==Notes==
