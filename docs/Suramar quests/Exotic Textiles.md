==Objectives==
Obtain the Fel Inscribed Shroud.
* [[Fel Inscribed Shroud]]

==Description==
I'm risking my life and career to be here, tailor.

I've been curious about [[demon]]ic cloth, and my attempts to obtain some through approved means have been met with resistance.

I simply must see this cloth for myself.

I don't wish to disrupt [[Leyweaver Azayna|Azayna]]'s pact with the demons, but you - you can attack the demons without drawing attention to our guild.

I'm particularly interested in a particular demon's set of robes. Bring me a scrap, and I'll teach you what I know.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Imbued Silkweave Gloves]] pattern

You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Probably better that you fight the thing, anyhow. I'm useless with a weapon.

==Completion==
Excellent work. I will get to studying this fabric right away. As promised, I will teach you what I know. Are you acquainted with our patterns for gloves?
