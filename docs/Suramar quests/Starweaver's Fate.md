==Objectives==
Locate [[Syrana Starweaver]]

==Description==
I will take these tomes to [[Thalrenus Rivertree|Thalrenus]].

There is one thing that weighs heavily on my mind, and I would like for you to attend to it in my stead.

My wife and life partner, Syrana Starweaver, resides in the [[Starweaver's Sanctum]] across the bridge.  It fell shortly after the [[Nightborne]] entered the [[Moon Guard Stronghold|Stronghold]].

If she still lives she will need to know of our efforts.  Her power is sorely needed.

Give her my best- I will be along shortly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Lothrius Mooncaller|Lothrius]] and Thalrenus live, then. There may be some hope yet. Thank you for braving the bridge, stranger.

==Notes==
;On accept:
:{{text|say|Lothrius Mooncaller|I have laid out a safe path for you.  Touching the crystals will summon my guardians to you.  Make good use of it and go swiftly!}}

In a building, Syrana is channeling a Frozen In Time spell.  She is with a [[Moonfall Defender]] and a [[Moonfall Acolyte]].  Opposite of them having charged in, are three [[Imperial Conjurer]]s.
: {{text|say|Syrana Starweaver|There!}}
: ''Seeing that help has arrived for further attacks, Syrana releases the spell and the conjurers die.''
: {{text|say|Syrana Starweaver|Lothrius' magic called to me.  He must still be alive!  Quickly- you can help us rejoin the others.}}

==Progression==
