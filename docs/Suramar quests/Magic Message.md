==Objectives==
Examine the [[Arcane Anomaly]] in [[Dalaran]]. 
* Arcane Anomaly examined

==Description==
For the last 10,000 years, the elven city of [[Suramar]] has been sealed in an arcane barrier, much like Dalaran once was.

That barrier has come down.

Since then, waves of magical energy have been emanating from the city like ripples in a pond. It was in these waves that I sensed a pattern.

A spell, encrypted among the chaos.

I have recreated the spell here. It's not dangerous, but beyond that... I have no idea what it does!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|85|}}
* 4110 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Go ahead and take a look.

==Completion==
A magical message in a bottle, slipped right beneath the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s nose... Clever.

==Notes==
On accept:
: {{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Any disturbance should catalyze the sequence. Just, uh, give it a poke or something.}}

Interact with the floating sphere. The [[Echo of First Arcanist Thalyssra]] will appear.
: {{Text|say|Echo of First Arcanist Thalyssra|Ith'el kanesh!}}
: {{Text|say|Echo of First Arcanist Thalyssra|I am [[Thalyssra]] of the shal'dorei... the [[Nightborne]]. First Arcanist in the court of Suramar.}}
: {{Text|say|Echo of First Arcanist Thalyssra|My people have made a dire pact. One that spells doom for this world.}}
: {{Text|say|Echo of First Arcanist Thalyssra|Time is short. If you have found this message, you are capable of finding me as well.}}
: {{Text|say|Echo of First Arcanist Thalyssra|Make haste for Suramar. You may be our last hope.}}
: {{Text|say|Echo of First Arcanist Thalyssra|Ith'nala kanesh!}}

The Echo disappears.

==Progression==
{{Nightfall}}
