'''Lifelines''' is a rare [[World Quest]] in [[Suramar]].

==Objectives==
*[[Arcwine]] distribution defended

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Silgryn]]|[[Elisande|The Magistrix's]] [[Duskwatch|thugs]] are impeding [[Deline]]'s efforts to distribute arcwine.  Find her in the canals and protect her as she feeds our people.}}

== Rewards==
*+250 reputation with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
: {{text|say|Silgryn|Even as we suffer under the heel of the Magistrix, our people must be nourished.  They are the backbone of our rebellion.}}

== Notes ==
Meet up with Deline's gondola just northwest of where you first met her, where she is tossing bottles to [[Withering Citizen]]s. You must protect the defenseless citizens from the [[Duskwatch Auditor]]s and [[Duskwatch Veteran]]s that will try to murder them. [[Captain Ilessa]] can also spawn for the quest. Progress is measured in both Duskwatch killed and citizens successfully receiving a bottle. Depending on your class you may want to grab a quick group to do this one.

The mobs will also count for [[Forces of Oppression]].
