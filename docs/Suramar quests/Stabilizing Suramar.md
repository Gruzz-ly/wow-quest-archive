==Objectives==
Complete 10 [[world quest]]s in [[Suramar]].
* Complete 10 world quests in Suramar (10)

==Description==
[[Elisande]]'s plan has backfired. She thought to stamp out our rebellion by making an example of The [[Waning Crescent]].

Instead, she ignited the flame of the [[shal'dorei]] better than I ever could.

We must maintain a cohesive campaign against Elisande and the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] by fighting them in every corner of Suramar.

Show the people that there is still hope - that there are still heroes willing to fight for them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
Now is the time for action!

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Every day we come closer to freedom for Suramar.

==Notes==
Any 10 world quests in Suramar will do, including Kirin Tor and Warden quests.

==Progression==
{{Waxing Crescent}}
