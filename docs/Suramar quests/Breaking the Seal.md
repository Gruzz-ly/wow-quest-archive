==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Thalyssra.jpg|First Arcanist Thalyssra}}
Break the Seal of the Tides, Seal of the Earth and Seal of the Sky.
*Seal of the Tides broken
*Seal of the Earth broken
*Seal of the Sky broken

==Description==
<As you behold the relic, [[Thalyssra]]'s voice echoes in your mind.>

You found it!  But it is sealed away tight.

Search the room for a way to break those seals.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
<As the magical barrier begins to fade, you hear the rustling of leaves and the clattering of mandibles just outside.>

==Notes==
This quest works similarly to [[Power Grid]]. There are two beams, a tall blue one and a short purple one. When you '''focus both beams on the same seal''' by rotating the arcane coils, that seal can be broken by interacting with it.

With each seal broken, a [[Moonfall Stalker]] will drop down from the webbing at the ceiling to attack.

After completing the quest, a cinematic plays, showing droves of [[Fal'dorei|mutated spider elves]] crawling from the pit towards the Moonshade Sanctum entrance.
