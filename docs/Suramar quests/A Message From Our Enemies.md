==Objectives==
Listen to Andaris's Message in [[Shal'Aran]].
*Listen to Andaris's Message

==Description==
<Name>! The messages from [[Ly'leth Lunastre|Ly'leth]] we traced throughout the [[Terrace of Enlightenment|Terrace]] - we could not have known at the time, but somebody was watching.

This crystal was delivered by a courier early this morning. <Pointing to the crystal by her side.>

I am afraid the message contained within is not for the faint of heart. It has not been shown to anyone else, but you deserve to see it for all you have done for us. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
*1,650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We have no time to waste.

==Completion==
I do not know what lies in store for us, but we cannot sit idly while Ly'leth is missing.

We must act now!

==Notes==
Click on the [[Mysterious Crystal]] on the table in front of [[First Arcanist Thalyssra]] to play the message.

;Message
:''An image of a [[nightborne]] woman appears above the crystal, smug and condescending.''
:{{text|say|[[Andaris Narassin]]|Poor Thalyssra... you try so hard to save your people, yet you cut them off from [[Nightwell|the one thing]] that can restore them! I fear Ly'leth shall pay the price for your arrogance.}}
:{{text|say|Andaris Narassin|Let us test the mettle of your [[Nightfallen (faction)|rebellion]]! Send your best to face me at Ly'leth's [[Lunastre Estate|estate]]... before I bring in more citizens for... questioning!}}
