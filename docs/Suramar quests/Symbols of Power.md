==Objectives==
Collect 8 Legion Emblems.
* [[Legion Emblem]] (8)

==Description==
This [[Servant of Azoran|demon]] has information that could lead us to those in charge.

Unfortunately, he is more fearful of his master than he is of us. We need to change his mind about that.

The most powerful [[Burning Legion]] soldiers often carry an emblem of their rank and status within the demon army.

Seek out the stronger demons in [[Felsoul Hold]], slay them, and return to me with their emblems.

We will show this [[wyrmtongue]] servant who it is he should fear...

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|Enchanted Nightborne Coin
}}

==Progress==
Do you have the Legion Emblems?

==Completion==
I see you have returned with the emblems. Excellent.

Let's see how this wyrmtongue reacts when we show him what we've made of his comrades.
