==Objectives==
Collect Toad Gizzards for [[Keelay Moongrow|Keelay]].
*[[Toad Gizzard]] (4)

==Description==
I have an ingredient that will make my fruit irresistible.

Not many remember the delicacy of manatrout liquor. Its pungent aroma, the unctuous mouthfeel...

The [[toad]]s near the northern river concentrate this additive in their gizzards. Fetch some stomachs for me, and we will have plenty.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
[[Daglir]] is young and foolish!

==Completion==
Manatrout was completely fished out of our harbors. Since the shield was raised all we have had of the liquor is memories on our palates.

==Progression==
#* [[Bad Apples]]
#* [[Blast of Spice Fish]]
# [[Fruit of the Doom]]
