==Objectives==
Speak with [[Thaedris Feathersong]] in [[Tel'anor]].
*Speak with Thaedris Feathersong

==Description==
[[Suramar City|Suramar]] is lost.

Our leaders struck a dark bargain, accepting the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] as our allies. We were meant to be heroes, guardians - the people resting here. We are not like them any more. I cannot live with them.

But cut off from the [[Nightwell]], we wither and devolve into a mindless existence. An existence without release or dignity, as you can see even here...

I rejected both of these options and found myself here. I will find a third way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Why do you seek to dissuade me?

==Completion==
Honeyed words from a stranger. While comforting, they do not shake my resolve. Come, at this rate I will wither before we are through.

==Notes==
;Diaolgue
Look at the city, <race>. It is beautiful, and it is tragic.

We were cowards to hide beneath that shield. Azeroth was in our care, and we chose to abandon her. We failed our sacred duty to protect the world, and our shame is too great.

''{{gossip|There is another way, Thaedris. We have a refuge not far from here.  [[Thalyssra]] is there.}}''

: Thalyssra escaped? She always was one of the more rational ones. I am glad that she did not stay and join the [[Elisande|Grand Magistrix]] in her road to damnation.

: Still, it is hopeless. Our allies are few and scattered, and our enemy has gained a powerful one. We cannot possibly stop their combined forces.

: Come now. There is much to be done if you would earn my coin.

''{{gossip|Very well.}}''
