Slay [[Grimwing the Devourer]].

==Description==
You have my thanks for rescuing me from captivity, <name>.

However, [[Azoran]] is no mere [[demon]]. He is a powerful [[eredar]] who commands great rank within the [[Burning Legion]].

Before we can get to him, there is another that must be destroyed.

[[Grimwing the Devourer]] is the strongest of the [[felbat]]s. Place the [[basilisk]] flesh upon the altar to the north and slay Grimwing when she appears.

Then, return to me with her head. My thirst for vengeance must be quenched.
