==Objectives==
Evacuate survivors in the [[Waning Crescent]] and [[Siren's Vigil]].
*[[Master Devlyn]] Evacuated
*[[Eneas]]' Family Evacuated
*[[Scarleth]]'s Girls Evacuated
*[[Thorvos]] and [[Valanth]] Evacuated

==Description==
[[Elisande]]'s purge of the Waning Crescent came so swiftly that few could react. Many of my people are dead or taken.

Some may have endured this atrocity. We need to make sure they are not left behind.

I need you to search the houses nearby for any survivors. See that they flee before they are discovered. Reassure them that there is no reason to stay.

Not here, not while Elisande's insanity reigns.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16450 [[XP]]
*[[Aoire's Crook]]

==Progress==
Did you find anyone?

==Completion==
I see you managed to find some survivors. Good, that is a weight off my mind.

==Notes==
Upon approaching [[Master Devlyn]]:

: {{Text|say|Master Devlyn|Where is it? The master's vase?}}

Click on the [[Master's Vase]] lying in the corner of the room.

: {{Text|say|Master Devlyn|Oh, thank you! This masterpiece is worth my life a hundred times over.}}

Upon talking to [[Eneas]]:

: T-they gave us no warning. [[Lunette]]- my children! Ugh...
{{Gossip|''You need to get out of here. It isn't safe!''}}
: I cannot leave without my children! They must be hiding...
: Please, find them!

The two children, [[Brigitte]] and [[Emille]], are upstairs.

Brigitte:

: M-mother told me t-to hide.
{{Gossip|''Your father is waiting for you downstairs- hurry!''}}
: {{Text|say|Brigitte|I'm going!}}

Emille:

: I heard screaming! I'm scared!
{{Gossip|''Your father will help you get to safety. Go downstairs now!''}}
: {{Text|say|Emille|Father!!}}

Return to Eneas:

{{Gossip|''Eneas, you need to go now.''}}
: {{Text|say|Eneas|Praise all that is good... you are both safe. Come, let us get out of here!}}

Upon approaching [[Scarleth]]:

: {{Text|emote|Scarleth spits on the corpse of the demon.}}
: {{Text|say|Scarleth|I told him not to take one step closer.}}

Upon talking to Scarleth:

: Disgusting demonic filth will not lay a hand on my girls.
{{Gossip|''It looks like you have things handled, Scarleth. You and your girls should leave while you have a chance.''}}
: {{Text|say|Scarleth|I know where to find [[Shal'Aran]]. Come, ladies. We are no longer safe in the city.}}

Scarleth and her girls run out.

Upon approaching [[Thorvos]]:
: {{Text|say|Thorvos|Get up! We must leave!}}

Upon talking to Thorvos:

: My son was injured in the chaos... I have not been able to move him. Please, help us!
{{Gossip|''I will protect you both. Let's go!}}
: {{Text|say|Thorvos|Behind you!}}

A [[Duskwatch Punisher]] enters the house and attacks.

: {{Text|say|Duskwatch Punisher|You think you can hide from [[Elisande]]? Die, traitors!}}

Upon killing the Duskwatch Punisher:
: {{Text|say|Valanth|F-father... Run...}}
