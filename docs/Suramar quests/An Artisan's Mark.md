==Objectives==
Obtain [[Lespin Silverleaf|Lespin's]] Signet Ring.
*[[Bloodspattered Signet Ring]]

==Description==
You there! Do you have a moment?

I need you to meet with my friend in the Promenade and retrieve a signet ring. I would send my oaf of an apprentice, but he is not finished with the simple task I gave him.

I am expecting a guest at any moment and I simply must have it before he arrives. Can you help me, friend?

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
Do you have it?

==Completion==
Oh, thank the [[Elisande|Magistrix]]! I was worried it was lost forever.

I see that this ring has seen some... use. I do hope it doesn't belong to anyone important. Or... vocal.
