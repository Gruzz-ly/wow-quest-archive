==Objectives==
Reach Revered with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]].
* {{rep|Revered}} The Nightfallen

==Description==
[[Magic]] has long been a vice of the [[elves]].  It [[Well of Eternity|shaped us, and lifted us out of the darkness]] - but without balance, it also threatens to unmake us.

The [[shal'dorei]] are too proud to admit it, but they are the product of indulgence.  They live without harmony.

But I sense potential among the [[Nightfallen]].  Losing everything has humbled them.  It has made them stronger.

Stay the course, <name>.  Help the Nightfallen rise up.
