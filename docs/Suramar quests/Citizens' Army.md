==Objectives==
Defeat 20 of Ravencrest's forces at [[Black Rook Hold]] in [[Val'sharah]].
*Black Rook forces slain (20)

==Description==
I can barely get these civilians to stand in a straight line.

They are untrained, undisciplined, and underarmed.

Still, they need to be ready for the real battle.

[[Khadgar]] suggested we try some field training at the ruins of Black Rook Hold in Val'sharah. The risen forces of [[Lord Ravencrest]] apparently remember how to fight.

Go, hero, and I will send some trainees to support you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
How is the training going?

==Completion==
The trainees you helped cannot seem to stop talking about your fighting prowess. Already they are passing along what you taught them.

I appreciate your help in this.

==Notes==
Pick up all three available quests, then mount [[Dusktalon]] to fly directly to the outdoor Black Rook Hold area. They do not involve entering the instance.

==Progression==
{{Crafting War}}
