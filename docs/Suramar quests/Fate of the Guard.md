==Objectives==
Find the corpses of Nyellus Starweaver, Galar'thus Rivertree, and Kailea Windfeather and perform funereal rites for them.
* [[Nyellus Starweaver]]'s Rite Performed
* [[Galar'thus Rivertree]]'s Rite Performed
* [[Kailea Windfeather]]'s Rite Performed

==Description==
<Thalrenus looks you over.>

You are not one of them.

The [[Nightborne]] came to our gates hours after the shield over [[Suramar City|Suramar]] fell. We thought them friends, despite our long separation.

We were wrong.

They poured into [[Moon Guard Stronghold|our stronghold]] and began the slaughter. We were unprepared. Though we fought, we were beaten.

The keep is lost. Our leaders have perished and their corpses lay in the streets.

Find them, give them their final rites.

While you search, look for survivors. Help them if you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Moon Guard Focusing Stone]]

==Progress==
Are you here to fight the Nightborne?

==Completion==
I thought the [[Moon Guard]] could endure anything...

==Notes==
There are four [[Nightborne Eradicator]]s standing guard at the foot of the steps.

''Approach:''
: {{text|say|Nightborne Eradicator|Who goes there?}}
: ''Suddenly a [[highborne]] mage appears among them and casts a powerful arcane AOE to wipe them out.''
: {{text|say|[[Thalrenus Rivertree]]|Thank you for that welcome distraction.}}
: ''He kneels, as if to rest from casting the spell.''

;Accept
:{{text|say|Thalrenus Rivertree|I will take this opportunity to lay traps for the intruders. I am certain we will meet again!}}
