==Objectives==
Take Commander Domitille's Helm to [[Lothrius Mooncaller]].
*[[Commander Domitille's Helm]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Commander Domitille]] represents the very essence of the [[Nightborne]]'s corruption. Abhorrent of power not their own, enamoured with their [[Elisande|Grand Magistrix]] to the point of zealotry, and focused utterly on the destruction of the [[Moon Guard]].

Take her helm to Lothrius as proof of her demise.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|41|20}}
*21,090 [[XP]]
*[[Insignia of the Nightborne Commander]]

==Completion==
I was wondering why she had suddenly gone silent.  It is a small comfort to my heart, but a great blow to the remaining forces of the Nightborne.  Well done, <name>.

==Progression==
