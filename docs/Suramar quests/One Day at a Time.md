==Objectives==
Feed the Fruit of the Arcan'dor to a [[Suramar Refugee]] in [[Shal'Aran]].
*[[Fruit of the Arcan'dor]] (provided)

==Description==
Thank you for coming, outlander.  It is good to see you again.

I have a situation in [[Suramar City|the city]] that needs your attention, but first...

Let us talk of hope.

<[[Thalyssra]] gestures toward the [[arcan'dor]].>

The fruit of the arcan'dor can truly free my people from the [[Nightwell]].  However, it only grows so fast.  It will take time to distribute this cure.

I think it only right that you help me pass out the fruit as it is ready.  Please take this, and give it to anyone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
In time, all of the [[shal'dorei]] will be free.

==Completion==
I will ask this of you again, as more fruit is ready.

For now, we have some disturbing news to discuss.

==Notes==
Go to Shal'Aran to find Thalyssra, Oculeth and Valtrois all restored to healthy nightborne forms. Things are finally looking up, right?

...Right?
