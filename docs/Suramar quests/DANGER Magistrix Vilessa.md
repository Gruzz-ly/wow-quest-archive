:{{text|say|Sira Moonwarden|''[[Sira Moonwarden#On completion|Random ending quote.]]''}}

==Notes==
Vilessa is located on a guarded rooftop terrace that normally has partying nobles and numerous guards. The stairs going up to that level is across the street from the building where [[A Spy in Our Midst]] starts. The easiest way to get there though is by gliding to it from [[Lunastre Estate]].

There are four [[Duskwatch Moonscythe]]s in a line in front of her. It would be best to try to avoid them or take them out first.
