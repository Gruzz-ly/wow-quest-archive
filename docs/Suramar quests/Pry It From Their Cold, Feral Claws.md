==Objectives==
Retrieve 8 Harpy Necklaces for [[Lespin Silverleaf|Lespin]].
*[[Harpy Necklace]] (8)

==Description==
The shield being lowered presents a unique opportunity for new styles.

Feathers, bone and other primitive materials are suddenly fashionable again. Who would have thought they could grow tired of my masterpieces?

Venture out of the city and collect necklaces from the [[harpy|harpies]] on the southern cliffs. Etching my mark into them should net me a tidy profit.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have my necklaces? They are of no use to me on the necks of those... creatures.

==Completion==
Those wretched creatures are a scourge on our beautiful lands. At least they had good taste in their accessories.

Or maybe they just like shiny things.
