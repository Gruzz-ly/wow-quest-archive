==Objectives==
Retrieve burial objects for [[Thaedris Feathersong|Thaedris]].
* {{item|Flask of Sacred Oil|Sacred Oil}}
* {{item|Bundle of Preserving Incense|Preserving Incense}}
* [[Chest of Shrouds]]

==Description==
I used to visit here before the barrier was raised. While the ruling council and the [[Elisande|Grand Magistrix]] argued and politicked I watched the caretakers perform their rituals and venerate the dead.

I would honor the [[ghost|spirits]] here one last time. I am headed to the tombs. If some of the sacred oils, burial shrouds, or incense survived the ages then bring them to me.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
Did you find anything?

==Completion==
Truly a testament to our preservation techniques. I had lost hope that anything would have survived looting and the sands of time.

The ancestors will be pleased with this.
