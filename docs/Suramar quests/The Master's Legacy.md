==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Gemcutter's Tomb]].
*[[Gemcutter's Tome]]
*Slay [[Lespin Silverleaf|Lespin]]

==Description==
You work for a murderer and a thief.

That design he wants? It is called the magistrix cut, and it was perfected by my husband. He was killed by Lespin for his secret.

I had him entombed in a small cave north of the city, for we could not make the trip to [[Tel'anor]]. Buried with him is a tome that contains the secrets of the design.

Retrieve the design and keep it out of his hands!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Master Jeweler's Gem]]

==Progress==
Where is the master?

==Completion==
Well well, looks like that old fool finally met his match?

It looks like the Promenade is in need of a new jeweler, and I think I have learned all I could from my former master.

Here is something for your efforts.

==Notes==
After opening the [[Overlooked Crate]], [[Lespin Silverleaf]] will appear with two [[Nightborne Accomplice]]s.

Kill Lespin:
:{{Text|Say|Lespin Silverleaf|My work will shine for eternity...}}

;On completion
:{{Text|Say|Apprentice Ardrias|You have done everyone a great service, friend. Give cousin Ly'leth my regards.}}
