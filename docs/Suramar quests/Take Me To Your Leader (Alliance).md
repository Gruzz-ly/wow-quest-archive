==Objectives==
Meet with [[Khadgar]] in [[Suramar]].
*Meet with Khadgar in Suramar.

==Description==
I am glad you are here, <name>.

This... Khadgar, the archmage who found my message, has called a meeting.

He wishes to meet us by the entrance to the city as soon as possible.

Will you accompany me? I have the strangest feeling that he will not be alone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*12,340 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Hello again, champion. I see we are all here now.

==Notes==
In [[Meredil]], near the [[Suramar City]] border, Khadgar has newly arrived with [[Kirin Tor Peacekeeper]]s. On the eastern side of the road, [[Tyrande Whisperwind]] is present with [[Ash'alah]], accompanied by [[Vereesa Windrunner]] plus [[Sentinel]]s and [[Silver Covenant]] forces. On the western side, [[Lady Liadrin]] is accompanied by [[Grand Magister Rommath]] and [[Blood Knight]] forces.

;Alliance leaders
;Tyrande Whisperwind
I am glad to see a friendly face on this battlefield, <name>.

It is... hard... for me to once again walk in Suramar. Ten thousand years have passed since my feet last felt the grass of this land.

Back then, we were fleeing the [[Burning Legion]].

I never believed I would return to the place of my birth to wrest it from the grasp of those I once believed were my people.

;Vereesa Windrunner
I never thought I would share a camp with the kaldorei. But, desperate times, desperate measures.

;Horde leaders
;Lady Liadrin
Your leaders need to get their heads in the game.

Vereesa is so obsessed with her [[Jaina Proudmoore: Tides of War|desire for revenge]] against the [[Horde]] that we cannot trust our flank to her.

Tyrande is a sentinel. She knows little of war on this type of battlefield. While her scouting is useful she should recuse the [[Kal'dorei]] from the main assault.

My blood knights are the only ones prepared to carry the weight of this conflict.

;Grand Magister Rommath
Hmph. Your armies are chaotic and unorderly. Fortunately our blood knights and magisters will form the core of this assault, striking true into the heart of the city.
