==Objectives==
*Withered Exposed to Volatile Fel (9)
*[[Withered Targeting Orb]] (provided)

==Description==
:{{text|say|[[First Arcanist Thalyssra]]|The [[Withered]] must be made ready for our assault on the [[Nighthold]]. Their resistance to [[fel]] can be bolstered in [[Felsoul Hold]].}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
:{{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|More of our Withered are now able to withstand the fel. Our revolution will not be stopped!}}

==Notes==
The quest area is only the south side of Felsoul Hold. Methods to get there:
* Flight point at [[Felblaze Ingress]], in [[Azsuna]]. Head past the [[Den of the Demented]] to follow the path down to the south and east. Several demons to dodge or outrun.
* Felsoul Hold portal inside the [[Fel Breach]]. This may seem the simple and easiest option, but it is inside, which means you cannot mount, and you will have to kill [[Djin'zal]] among others to get out. It is also a little difficult to get back inside.
* [[Lunastre Estate]] portal. Head east and get around the [[harpies]] as best you can, then jump off the cliff with a glider. This is also the simplest route if you can fly.

You will get up to three [[Fel-Vulnerable Withered]] due to the Withered Trainer buff. You must find orbs of [[Volatile Fel]] floating above fel lava. When you have three withered, use the targeting orb (no actual targeting needed) and they will drain the fel into themselves. Take no action while they're casting as it will be interrupted and the fel will be used up.

For faster summoning, just cancel the buff and the withered will respawn immediately.
