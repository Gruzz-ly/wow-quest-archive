==Objectives==
Use a [[Greater Legion Portal Stone|Greater Portal Stone]] to summon [[Vizuul the Twisted]] at the [[Altar of End Times]] in [[Faronaar]] and collect his runebindings.
* [[Twisted Runebindings]]
* Suggested players: 5

==Description==
It is time we put our work to the test by infusing the most potent source of power I know of - [[fel]] [[magic]].

Rarely, the Legion's minions will carry fragments of the greater portal stones used to usher in their [[eredar]] masters. If you gather enough to form a complete stone, you can use it in [[Faronaar]] to call forth the eredar lord [[Vizuul the Twisted]] at the [[Altar of End Times]].

The bindings Vizuul wears to augment his power should push the Heart to its very limit.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|19|40}}

==Progress==
Do you have the bindings?

==Completion==
Now, let's see what happens if we use the Heart to drain the power from them.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Syrana Starweaver]]|Our numbers may be few, but the Legion will learn to fear the Guard.}}
On completion:
:{{Text|say|Syrana Starweaver|Perfect. Shall we put our incantation to the test?}}

You're looking for five {{item|Legion Portal Fragment}}s looted off any of the demons in the area.

==Progression==
{{Balance of Power}}
