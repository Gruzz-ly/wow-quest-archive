==Objectives==
Investigate the [[ley line]] device at [[Kel'balor]] in the [[Crimson Thicket]].
* Meet [[Valtrois]] in Kel'balor
* Protect Valtrois while she investigates the ley line device

==Description==
The [[Nightwell]] is so overloaded that they could not spare anything for this seal. Instead, they are borrowing power from the ley lines.

I have traced one of their power sources to Kel'balor. We should head there immediately so I can determine how best to disable this barrier.

Yes of course I said "we." Surely you do not expect me to go without my bodyguard, do you?

I shall meet you there!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Nightfallen]]
*[[Ley-Syphoner's Focus]]

==Completion==
Valtrois told me everything. She is hard at work on a plan for bringing down that barrier.

I am afraid all we can do for now is wait. Thank you for your help.

==Notes==
You must have already been to Kel'balor when completing the [[Leyline Bling]] achievement. In case you forgot, it is an underground ruin whose entrance is close to the [[Crimson Thicket]] flight point.

Upon reaching the meeting point in Kel'balor, Valtrois teleports in.

: {{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Ah, you have arrived. I expected to find something here but...}}
: {{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|This ley line is being leeched, but I cannot see... wait! I have an idea.}}
: {{Text|emote|Arcanist Valtrois motions for you to follow.}}

Follow Valtrois to the leyline feed.

: {{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|A clever cloaking spell, but what is this device? Keep watch.}}
: ''Valtrois channels a spell into the transmission tower next to the leyline feed.''

Two [[Ley Line Channeler]]s spawn and attack. Kill them.

: {{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Hmm... they are redirecting a portion of the ley line's power directly to the [[Sanctum of Order]].}}
: ''She stops channeling and steps away from the feed.''
: {{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|I'm hesitant to take any action at this point. I'll return to [[Shal'Aran]] and continue my research.}}
: ''She teleports away.''
