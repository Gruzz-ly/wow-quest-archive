==Objectives==
Meet [[Ambassador Blackguard]] at the [[Orgrimmar Embassy]].

==Description==
After ages standing alone, we are once again poised to become part of something greater. Our alliance with the [[Horde]] affords us a fresh start, a unique chance that must not be squandered.

The [[Sylvanas Windrunner|warchief's]] ambassador awaits you in [[Orgrimmar]], <name>. From there, you will set out on a journey across [[Azeroth]]. Fight to defend this land, and claim a place for the [[shal'dorei]] within it.

Show the world who we are, <class>. Bring honor to the Horde, for in so doing, you will bring honor to [[Suramar]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|25}}
* 395 [[XP]]

Are you the new one? I'm supposed to welcome you. Here, take this letter.

<Blackguard lets out an exasperated sigh.>
