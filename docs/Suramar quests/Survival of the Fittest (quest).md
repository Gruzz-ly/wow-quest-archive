==Objectives==
Free 12 exhibits from the [[Menagerie (Suramar)|Menagerie]].
* Creatures Freed (12)
* [[Overloaded Collar]] (provided)

==Description==
The collar you took from the trapper is simple, but effective. Affixing the collar to a target will make them complacent and obedient to their [[Nightborne]] masters. [[Lilryia Dawnwind|Lilryia]] was able to reverse the spell using the traps you found.

The [[magic]]s in the collar can now be used to cancel out the other collars.

How about giving the Nightborne a reminder that nature always finds a way?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Completion==
I could hear their cries and see the carnage from here! That will teach the Nightborne to enslave creatures. Have they fallen so far during all those years under the shield?
