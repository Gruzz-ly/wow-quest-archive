==Objectives==
Lead the elven army to [[Astravar Harbor]].
* March on [[Suramar City]]

==Description==
[[Thalyssra]] managed to get all 3 to agree to the same thing? I am impressed with her skills of negotiation.

Alright hero, [[Liadrin]] is already marching on Suramar. Join her forces.

[[Tyrande]] will flank the city defenders and meet you deeper in.

The [[Nightborne]] will bring up the rear and hold the territory for us.

[[Oculeth]] and I will move the [[Kirin Tor]] forces to Astravar Harbor. With luck, we shall see you on the other side.

==Progress==
All this running is exhausting.

==Completion==
The telemancy traps you placed prior to the battle are doing wonders for reducing our losses.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|yell|Archmage Khadgar|[[Sin'dorei]] and [[shal'dorei]], take the promenade and hold it against our foes. Once we have that, the [[kaldorei]] ride ahead and take the Concourse.}}

The rebel army will head towards [[Suramar City]]. Follow them to begin the scenario.

===Stage 1: Secure the Promenade===
* Defeat the Promenade defenders
* Defeat the Promenade vanguard

Simply follow your allies and kill everything that attacks. After some time, [[Lady Liadrin]] will exclaim:
:{{Text|yell|Lady Liadrin|Champion, come, join my sin'dorei as we crush this vanguard.}}

===Stage 2: Defeat the Ancient Shieldguard===
* Defeat the [[Ancient Shieldguard]]

The [[Ancient Shieldguard]], a large arcane construct, will spawn once all the regular guards are defeated.

===Stage 3: Secure the Concourse of Destiny===
* Defeat Concourse defenders.

Once the Ancient Shieldguard is destroyed, [[Tyrande Whisperwind]] rides ahead with her [[Darnassus Sentinel (Suramar)|Darnassus Sentinels]].

:{{Text|yell|Tyrande Whisperwind|Time is short. Champion, mount and ride with us to the concourse before the [[Nightborne]] can reinforce their position.}}

===Final Stage: Trigger the Telemancy Trap===
* Telemancy Trap placed.

Push on ahead, to the other end of the circular platform. Oculeth and Khadgar are already there.

:{{Text|say|[[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]]|I have an idea! A mass teleport... but I need help casting it.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Archmage Khadgar]]|Won't their wards block your telemancy?}}
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Not to worry. They've ignored my advice to upgrade those wards for centuries now...}}

After placing the telemancy trap, Oculeth and Khadgar can be found at the entrance to the upper level of [[Astravar Harbor]].

:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|An [[Dalaran|entire city]], you say? [[In the Blink of an Eye|In one teleport]]?}}
:{{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Well, to be fair... I had help.}}
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Fascinating. I would love to compare notes when this is all over.}}
:{{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Come, champion. The [[Kirin Tor]] and [[Nightfallen (faction)|Dusk Lily rebels]] have secured this floor of the harbor.}}

==Progression==
{{March on Suramar}}
