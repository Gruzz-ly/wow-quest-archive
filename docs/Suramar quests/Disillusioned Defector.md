==Objectives==
Meet [[Silgryn]] at [[Evermoon Terrace]].

==Description==
The atmosphere in [[Suramar City|the city]] has improved little, but we may find this to our advantage today.

Silgryn asks for you at the Terrace. It seems even [[Elisande]]'s forces are fleeing before her insanity.

A defector has risen from the ranks and seeks to join our cause.

See that this individual is well received, <name>. We need all the friends we can get during these dark times.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*8230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Glad you could make it.

==Notes==
