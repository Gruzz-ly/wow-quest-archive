==Objectives==
Use the Arcane Nullifier to defeat Arcshaper Thorendis.
*[[Arcshaper Thorendis]] slain
*[[Arcane Nullifier]] (provided)

==Description==
There you have it, one arcane nullifier! Using their weapon and magical signatures to cloak the spell, it should tear apart the shield as good as any [[spellbreaker]] would.

Go teach that amateur spellslinger what it means to wage war against the [[sin'dorei]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Arcshaper's Barrier]]

==Progress==
The nullifier should do most of the work for you. Just watch out for his offensive magic!

==Completion==
Good. With him out of the way we will be able to establish a stronger foothold once the main force arrives.
