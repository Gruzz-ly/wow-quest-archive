==Objectives==
Remove [[Writhing Willbreaker]]s from 6 Possessed Vrykul in [[Azuregale Bay]].
*[[Possessed Vrykul]] saved (6)

==Description==
When the [[naga]] brought me down here, I saw many of my [[vrykul]] mining the sea floor. They had... [[Merciless one|squids]]... attached to their faces.

Whatever those things are, they must be controlling my kin and forcing them to work for the naga.

I do not know what will happen if you remove the squids, but I would rather my vrykul die than be slaves to the naga.

See me in [[Jandvik]] when the deed is done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
My vrykul deserve an honorable death.  They will not be slaves to the [[Sashj'tar]].

==Completion==
I must express gratitude for the vrykul you have saved this day.

==Progression==
{{Jandvik's Jarl}}
