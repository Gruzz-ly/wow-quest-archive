==Objectives==
Find a Fel Deconstructor for [[Kyrtos]].
* [[Fel Deconstructor]]

==Description==
I need you to fetch me something.

I think I might be on the verge of a breakthrough of a new source of [[magic]], but I require tools. 

I can no longer access my workshop, but I have seen the smaller [[demon]]s below using tools. Bring me one of their tools and I can save our people.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|19|40|}}
|Enchanted Nightborne Coin
}}

==Progress==
Did you find anything? I did not exactly get a chance to pack my things before I was exiled.

==Completion==
This was all you could find? I suppose it will have to do, although it is a primitive instrument.

==Gains==
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progression==
{{Kyrtos' magic}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
