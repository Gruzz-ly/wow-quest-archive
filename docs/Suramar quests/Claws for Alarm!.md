==Objectives==
* Locate [[Murky's Egg]]
* [[Sashj'tar Culinarian]] slain
* Assault the [[Sashj'tar Ruins]]

==Description==
:{{text|say|Murky|Mrglglg! Mrg grgl grrrrglmrg!}}

== Rewards ==
* +250 reputation with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
:{{text|say|Murky|Mrg! Mrgrglgrgl gr mrglglrlr!}}

== Notes ==
This quest will not ''automatically'' turn you into Murky, but rather you must mindmeld with his egg first. Kill any of the [[naga]] ([[Sashj'tar Myrmidon]], [[Sashj'tar Enforcer]], [[Sashj'tar Siren]]) but you may want to mostly focus on enforcers simply because they're worth 10% each.

There is one building which [[Tidemistress Sashj'tar]] and a whole bunch of [[Sashj'tar Scaleguard]]s are in; these do not count, and attcking them is more than likely to get Murky killed.
