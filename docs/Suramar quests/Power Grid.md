==Objectives==
Charge the Moon Seal, Star Seal, Beast Seal and Elven Seal in [[Ley Station Anora|Ley Station: Tel'Anor]]{{sic}}.
* Moon Seal charged
* Star Seal charged
* Beast Seal charged
* Elven Seal charged

==Description==
This station has fallen into disrepair. The circuit is broken, and to mend it we must recharge the seals in the central chamber.

Both a high potency current and low potency current are needed for each seal. Direct the currents to point at the same seal, then engage the seal.

Me? I shall supervise. You are the help, after all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Partially Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Completion==
I must admit I am impressed. You may actually be of some use to us.

==Notes==
This quest requires solving a small puzzle.

The arcane coil next to Valtrois, near the entrance, emits a blue current (energy beam) from its top, flowing into the central chamber with the four seals. At the far end of the ley station, there is another arcane coil, which emits a purple current, flowing at a lower height than the blue current.

To charge a seal, you need to click on it '''when both currents flow into the same seal'''.

To redirect the currents between seals, you can rotate both the high potency coil (blue beam generator) and the low potency coil (purple beam generator), as well as switches in the central chamber. Each of the current-generating coils can face two different directions, and you will need to go through all four possible combinations of their directions to power the four seals.

On accept:
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|This coil projects a high-potency current. You will find a low-potency coil at the far end of the facility.}}
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Both currents feed into the central chamber. Use the coils and switches to direct the currents and power all four seals in the central chamber!}}

Upon focusing both currents on the same seal:
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|The currents are aligned - now engage the seal!}}

Upon charging the first seal:
: ''The upper and lower current receptacles of the seal rotate to create one channel that the energy flows through.''
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Fine work. Three more to go.}}

Upon charging all four seals:
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|It is done! The station is back online.}}
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Refined leyline energy will flow from here to [[Shal'Aran]].}}

On complete:
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|You are dismissed. I will make my own way to Shal'Aran.}}

Before you leave the area, find the zigzag path to the left of the entrance and go up to [[Tel'anor]] to grab the telemancy beacon there.  In the other direction is the [[Enchanted Burial Urn]], by the sarcophagus of [[Latara Feathersong]].

Return to Shal'Aran to pick up the next quest, [[Feeding Shal'Aran]].
