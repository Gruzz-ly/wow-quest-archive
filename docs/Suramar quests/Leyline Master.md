==Objectives==
Speak with [[Arcanist Valtrois]].

==Description==
You surprise me, outlander.  During our first lesson about the ancient [[Ley line|leylines]], I half-expected you to be lost in daydreams of adventure, or treasure or... some such nonsense.

But you have proven an apt student.

Our leyline feed has grown extremely powerful.  Watching it grow has taught me a great deal about the [[arcane]], and the nature of [[mana]].

I have one final lesson that will help you find even more [[Ancient Mana|ancient mana]].

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you: [[Ancient Mana Scavenging]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*8,230 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
Perhaps there is hope for outlanders after all.

==Notes==
This quest will appear after seven leyline feeds are activated.

==Progression==
