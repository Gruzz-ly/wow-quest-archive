==Objectives==
Defeat the Arm of the Magistrix.
*[[Arm of the Magistrix]] slain
*Suggested players: 3

==Description==
The insurgents you marshaled gave me some bad news, <name>.

The arcanists loyal to [[Elisande]] have reactivated the [[Arm of the Magistrix]]. The most powerful [[Nightborne construct|construct]] ever attempted, it raged out of control and decimated an entire district before it was disabled. Truly they must be desperate to turn it against us.

The scouts have spotted it in the [[Crimson Thicket]] to the north. We cannot allow it to reach full power if we are to succeed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Charged Construct's Finger]]

==Progress==
We must destroy the Arm!

==Completion==
We almost lost the invasion before we could begin. Good work.

==Progression==
{{An Elven Problem}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.1.0|note=Added.}}
