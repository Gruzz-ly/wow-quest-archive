==Objectives==
Locate [[Kalendros Irongrove]].

==Description==
As we retreated from [[Val'sharah|Val'Sharah]]{{sic}}, our company was briefly separated by a conflict with some [[satyr]]s at the border.

One of our own did not make it here- Mythandros' brother, Kalendros.  I would like you to try and find him if you could.

Search the woods just before the bridge back into Val'Sharah.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
How good of Mayruna to send help. I had nearly lost hope.

==Progression==
{{Eminent Grow-main}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
