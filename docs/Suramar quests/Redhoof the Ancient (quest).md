==Objectives==
Locate [[Mythandros Irongrove|Mythandros]] and [[Redhoof the Ancient]].

==Description==
While you were busy assisting the Owlcats across the river, Mythandros and Solendra ventured further to the east.

I believe Mythandros may have found the next creature that may offer us its blessing.

There is a secluded glade along the river's bend to the Northeast. There you may find our new ally, an elderly stag named Redhoof.

==Completion==
This fine gentleman was just telling me how dearly he loves his forest. Let us assist him!
