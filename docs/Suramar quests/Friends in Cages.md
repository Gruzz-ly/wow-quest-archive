Release 3 Nightborne Citizens from their captivity.
*Prisoners freed (3)

==Description==
<Korine stomps her foot and refuses to move.>

They put my friends in cages!

Make the bad men stop hurting them! They take them out the garden and they never come back!

<Korine gestures stubbornly toward the door.>

I am not going home until they do!

*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
Did you let them out?

==Completion==
You let them go? I'm glad. I didn't like being in a cage either...

==Notes==
Go to the [[Terrace of Order]], kill [[Duskwatch Scion]]s for [[Control Orb]]s, then use them to release the prisoners.
