==Objectives==
Speak to [[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]].

==Description==
There is a troubling silence from [[Suramar City]] this day.

Oculeth just informed me that the teleporter to the [[Waning Crescent]] has gone dark. He is not able to reach [[Vanthir]], nor am I.

While I am hesitant to believe something dire has happened, I do feel this warrants investigation.

Speak with Oculeth and see if he can transport you to the Waning Crescent. We need to find out what happened.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Something is amiss. I can feel it in my bones.

==Progression==
{{Lockdown}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.1.0|note=Added.}}
