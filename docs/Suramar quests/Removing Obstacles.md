==Objectives==
Kill Calder and Eynar in [[Jandvik]].
*[[Calder (vrykul)|Calder]] slain
*[[Eynar]] slain

==Description==
<Class>! Interested in earning some coin?

The jarl of Jandvik is missing and two headstrong whelps are vying to take over leadership. I should be the next jarl, not them!

I want you to enter Jandvik and defeat Calder and Eynar in mortal combat.

I would not normally put my trust in an outsider, but this situation requires the aid of someone like you. Jandvik would condemn me if I were caught with their blood on my hands.

Meet me in the center of Jandvik when the deed is done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Trident of Sashj'tar]]

==Progress==
Do not underestimate Calder and Eynar.

==Completion==
With my adversaries gone, I can claim leadership of Jandvik unopposed.
