Follow [[Felsmith Nal'ryssa]]'s instructions to craft Leystone Boots.

What, were you trained by a [[tauren]] or something?

Hurry up, then. We probably have a few minutes before the [[demon]]s attack again. Here's a pattern - show me your work.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Recipe: Leystone Boots]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|9|87}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Watch your step out here on the front lines. This isn't your [[Dalaran|peaceful floating city]]'s blacksmithing shop.

==Completion==
Not bad, <class>. You know how to swing a hammer.
