==Objectives==
Collect 4 Warp-Resistant Plating from [[Chronarch Defender]]s.
*[[Warp-Resistant Plating]] (4)

==Description==
[[Oculeth]]'s theory is sound.  Reckless, but sound.

A small warp-field could trap and excite ambient mana in the conduit, thus creating a manastorm similar to when the [[arcan'dor]] fell out of balance.

I can build a device to generate the warp-field, but I need materials.

Specifically, warp-resistant alloys - such as the armor plating of high-end security constructs in the noble district.

Those constructs are deadly.  If anyone owes you a favor, now is the time to call it in.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Mana-Injected Chronarch Power Core]]

==Progress==
Without those plates, the E.M.P. would rip itself apart in seconds.

==Completion==
These will do nicely.

==Notes==
If the timing is right, you can use the world quest [[Sick of the Sycophants]] to gradually eliminate a single Chronarch Defender as it respawns over and over.  As you'll have to wait for respawn, try to do this with plenty of time left on the world quest.
