==Objectives==
Collect 50 Harpoon Parts from [[Sashj'tar Harpooner]]s in [[Azuregale Bay]].
*[[Harpoon Parts]] (50)

==Description==
You did well against [[Tidemistress Sashj'tar|that]] [[sea witch]], but not well enough.

Her power far surpasses any creature that I have ever fought. To defeat her, we will need something formidable. Something that she will not expect...

<[[Toryl]] grins wryly.>

Something of their own design... 

Salvage as many parts from their harpoon launchers as you can carry and meet me back in [[Jandvik]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
The Tidemistress is a dangerous foe. We must be just as cunning to defeat her.

==Completion==
You have all the parts that you will need... two in some cases.

==Progression==
{{Jandvik's Jarl}}
