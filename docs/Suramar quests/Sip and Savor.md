I think we're making wine, <name>!

Let's see if the vintner approves of our vintage.

Take a sample to Iltheux and see what he thinks.

I hope he likes the wine.

==Completion==
I think our work here is done!

==Notes==
Interact with the [[Nightborne Vat]] that [[Micah Broadhoof|Micah]] is getting scorched in to loot [[Nomi's Wine]], then head back to Iltheux:
:I hope you're here to help. Things are in such a state! We'll never meet our quota without some serious changes.

:{{Text|emote|Vintner Iltheux holds the glass up to the light and swirls it around.}}
:{{Text|say|Vintner Iltheux|Hmm. A decent color. And it has legs.}}
:{{Text|emote|Vintner Iltheux sticks his nose into the glass and inhales deeply.}}
:{{Text|say|Vintner Iltheux|Such a fragrant bouquet!}}
:{{Text|emote|Vintner Iltheux sips the wine.}}
:{{Text|say|Vintner Iltheux|Exquisite! I couldn't have done better myself.}}
