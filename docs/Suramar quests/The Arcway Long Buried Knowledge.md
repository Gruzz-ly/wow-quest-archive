Acquire the Suramar Leyline Map from [[the Arcway]].

==Description==
Beneath [[Suramar City]] is an ancient network of tunnels known as the Arcway.

They were abandoned some time ago as part of the cavern became unstable.  Since then, who knows?

Regardless of what is currently down there, I believe you will find something essential to our continued success.

Long ago my people took a thorough survey of the [[ley line]]s in and around [[Suramar]].  This they would have stored in the library in the Arcway.

Find this map for me.
