==Objectives==
Speak to [[Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Oculeth]] and meet [[First Arcanist Thalyssra|Thalyssra]] in the [[Nighthold]].
*Talk to Oculeth
*Learn the fate of the Nightborne

==Description==
Shortly after your victorious return from the Nighthold, urgent business took Thalyssra back to the palace.

She has requested that you meet her there.

Speak to me when you are prepared to join her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Arcanist's Manasaber]]

==Progress==
Thank you for coming.

==Completion==
Thank you for being here, <name>.

Ultimately the [[Nightborne]] must shape their own destiny, regardless of the help we have received from Outlanders like yourself.

It is no easy burden we bear, but [[Elisande]] has shown us that we must stand alone, without the [[Nightwell]], to properly rejoin the world.

Thank you for all you have done for us.

==Notes==
Speaking to Occuleth to teleport:
:{{Gossip|I am ready, Oculeth.}}
:''Occuleth casts Teleport: The Nighthold

:''Arriving in the [[Nightspire]], with Valtrois to Thalyssra's left and Oculeth to her right, the Nightborne walk up to the Nightwell. [[Lady Liadrin]] and [[Tyrande Whisperwind]] remain behind them at a distance.''
:{{text|say|[[First Arcanist Thalyssra]]|The Nightwell...}}
:{{text|say|[[Arcanist Valtrois]]|I thought I would never see it again!}}
:''Oculeth speaks solemnly.''
:{{text|say|[[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]]|It is dying. Without the [[Eye of Aman'thul]]{{sic}}, the Nightwell has become unstable.}}
:''Valtrois turns to Thalyssra as she speaks.''
:{{text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|We could stabilize it! We no longer need the Nightwell to sustain us, but we can still harness its power...}}
:''Oculeth turns to Thalyssra.''
:{{text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Thalyssra? It is your call...}}
:''Thalyssra is silent for a few moments, then speaks firmly and without regret.''
:{{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Let it die.}}
:{{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|We must put the Nightwell behind us. We must take responsibility for our failings, and repay our debt to the people of [[Azeroth]].}}
:''The trio return to where they were first standing.''

After the event:
{{Dialogue|title=First Arcanist Thalyssra|
It had to be this way. We no longer need the Nightwell, nor its power.

We must forge our own destiny.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Chief Telemancer Oculeth|
This is the right decision.

The power here is too great, the responsibility too heavy. Even Elisande was destroyed by it. We must let it go.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Arcanist Valtrois|
I will always wonder what might have been, had we chosen to save the Nightwell. What are we without its power?

In the end I trust in Thalyssra's judgment. Under her leadership I know the Nightborne will forge a new path.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Lady Liadrin|
I am impressed. Letting go of the Nightwell was no easy task.

Its power and allure will fade with time. As it was with [[Blood elf|us]], they will find their own way in this world.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Tyrande Whisperwind|
The Nightwell is no more.

These Nightborne will learn to survive without its corrupting power, or they will perish. Let us hope it is the former.
