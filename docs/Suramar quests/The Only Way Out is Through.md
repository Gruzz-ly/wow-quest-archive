==Objectives==
Escort [[Thalyssra]] to safety. 
* Thalyssra escorted to shelter

==Description==
I have much to tell you, but it is not safe to speak here.  I cannot hold this barrier forever.

<Thalyssra lifts a delicate flask to her lips.  Her eyes shimmer as she takes a sip.>

If we push through, we may find shelter up ahead.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
There is no turning back.

==Completion==
You fight well.

Perhaps it is time for a proper introduction.

==Notes==
On accept, Thalyssra drops the barrier.

:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Rath-anu'tanos!}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|We must take care. The [[withered]] ones prowl this area, ravenous in their hunger for magic and flesh alike.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Such is the fate of [[nightborne]] who cannot drink of the [[Nightwell]].}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|This is my fate as well.. unless...}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Look out!}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|E'rath omnas!}}

A group of Withered appears and assaults the barrier. There is no need to go out and kill them &mdash; just target the ones that are actively interfering with the barrier, which will damage the ones that launch themselves at it.

;Barrier assaulted
*{{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Get them off the barrier!}}
*{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|The barrier is being drained!}}

After the Withered die, Thalyssra moves on, still projecting her barrier. Follow her and stay inside.

:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|My strength is fading... we must find shelter...}}

Eventually, she stops again.

:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|<cough> I... need a moment...}}

Keep the Withered off the barrier, like the first time.

:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|There are so many...}}

Thalyssra passes across the stream to an entrance leading underground &mdash; to [[Shal'Aran]]. The Withered stop on the other side.

:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Strange. Why do they not follow?}}

Thalyssra kills the remaining Withered with arcane blasts, then runs inside and kneels down.

:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|<cough>... I need to rest...}}

Leaving the area before finishing the objective will cause Thalyssra to go back to the starting point, where she can be spoken to:
{{dialogue|
I hope my comrades have fared better than me.

{{gossip|Let's get going!}}
