==Objectives==
Rescue [[Ailen Astravar]].
*Rescue Ailen

==Description==
How could I let this happen?

<Aurore wrings her hands.>

Yesterday [[Coryn]] Stelleris approached me about the appointment.  He sought my support, but I did not offer it.

He said my son's life would continue as normal... if I gave him my vote.

This morning my son was gone.

I can only think of the terrible things he may be suffering.  You know what this family is capable of!

You want my support, but I can do nothing while my son is in danger.  Nothing.

Please... save him!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Titan-Forged Locket]]

==Progress==
Did you find my son?

==Completion==
He is unharmed! I owe you- and [[Ly'leth]]- a great debt.

==Notes==
Upon freeing Ailen:
:{{Text|say|Ailen Astravar|I think they meant to kill me! I am getting off this infernal ship! I will return to my mother at once.}}

On completion:
:{{Text|say|Aurore|You are not leaving my sight until an advisor is appointed. Promise me!}}
:{{Text|say|Ailen|Yes, mother.}}
: ''Aurore turns to you.''
:{{Text|say|Aurore|Thank you. Do let Ly'leth know that I stand with her.}}
