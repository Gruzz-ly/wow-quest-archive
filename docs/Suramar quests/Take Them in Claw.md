==Objectives==
Attract 3 [[Wild Moonfall Hippogryph]]s to deal with the [[Nightborne]] at [[Moonfall Roost]].
* Hippogryphs Attracted (3)
* [[Vial of Hippogryph Pheromones]] (provided)

==Description==
We should have seen this coming.  My [[Kailea Windfeather|sister]] is dead, my friends are wounded and we will likely die here.

I want revenge.

<Lyrea hands you a vial full of growing green liquid.>

We cannot beat them, but we can turn the [[Moon Guard Stronghold|Stronghold]] against them.

Wild [[hippogryph]]s are attracted to the scent in this bottle.  Wild hippogryphs are also notoriously violent when the object of their attraction is not a hippogryph.

Use it to clear a path deeper into the stronghold.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

== Progress ==
I thought I was alone here.  Are you here to continue the fight?

==Completion==
I heard screams, and I was gratified that they belonged to the Nightborne.  Well done.

: {{text|say|Serena Windfeather|Ignore him.  I need you to find [[Lothrius Mooncaller|Lothrius]].  We were separated in the attack- I think he is still holding out at the [[Athenaeum (Suramar)|Athenaeum]].}}
