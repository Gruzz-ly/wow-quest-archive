:'''First Arcanist Thalyssra (narrating):''' {{text|bossemote|10,000 years ago... My city was radiant... The Jewel of the [[Kaldorei Empire|Night Elf Empire]]. [[Suramar City|Suramar]]. Our people prospered for centuries ... Until the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] came. Entranced by the power they offered, [[Queen Azshara|our queen]] betrayed us ... to the [[Great Sundering|ruin of the world]]. As destruction drew ever closer, a desperate choice was made ... To conjure a powerful shield that would save our beloved city. It worked. Centuries passed. Without moonlight. Without sunlight. To survive, we turned to the [[Nightwell]], a font of great power at the city's heart. Slowly ... it [[Nightborne|changed us]] and ultimately drew the Legion once more to our gates. They offered us a trade. The Nightwell for our lives. As the Elders planned their surrender, some of us ... rebelled. We failed. Now the Devils have taken Suramar. And by the curse of the Nightwell, I am damned to [[Withered|Wither]] away ... as my ... City ... Burns.}}
