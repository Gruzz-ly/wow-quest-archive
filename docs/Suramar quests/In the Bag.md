==Objectives==
Witness [[Ly'leth Lunastre]]'s ascension to advisor.
*Witness Ly'leth's Ascension

==Description==
Already the city is abuzz with outrage.

I will not lie to you- it pleases me greatly that one such as [[Coryn]] is made a fool.

The other houses have sent their endorsements.  It is done, and nothing remains but a formal ceremony to grant me the title of advisor.

Meet me there.  You deserve to share in this success.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
I am prepared.  It is nearly time.

==Completion==
This may not end as cleanly as I would have preferred.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Ly'leth Lunastre|Meet me within the [[Sanctum of Order]]. I must prepare for the ceremony.}}
: ''Ly'leth heads out with her attendant while [[Arluin]] turns to you.''
:{{Text|say|Arluin|I... will go home. I have no business among such esteemed individuals.}}
:{{Text|say|Arluin|I accept your gratitude, by the way!}}

From the beacon, you will see two citizens looking through a window to the right.  Follow the wall in that direction and you'll find the stairs to the central platform where Ly'leth awaits.

: ''Ly'leth addresses the crowd. On either side in the high-ranking balconies are House Astravar and House Stelleris.  [[Grand Magistrix Elisande]] stands at the highest point of honor, in the middle.''
:{{Text|say|Ly'leth Lunastre|I humbly accept this appointment.  It is an honor beyond words.}}
:{{Text|say|Coryn|Filthy backstabbing cretin!  That title should have been mine!}}
: ''Coryn Stelleris teleports down from his entourage as he speaks to confront Ly'leth.''
:{{Text|say|Coryn|You impinge upon my honor!  You besmirch my name with baseless accusations!}}
:{{Text|say|Ly'leth Lunastre|My lord, you have lost your sense of decorum.  It is already decided.}}

On completion:
:{{Text|say|Coryn|I will reclaim my honor! I invoke the ancient rite- [[Tal'ashar]]!}}
