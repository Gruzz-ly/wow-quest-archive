==Objectives==
Acquire a Legion Missive from [[demon]]s in [[Astravar Harbor]].
*[[Legion Communicator (item)]]

==Description==
Our new friend brings us some disturbing information.

She claims to have seen a large number of citizens dragged from [[Starcaller Retreat]] in chains. Their destination appears to be Astravar Harbor.

Those taken to the harbor have yet to return, however. Worse yet, the area is now overrun with demons.

I need you to find out where these people went. Infiltrate the harbor and gather any information you can.

Start with the Legion filth- their corpses may point us in the right direction.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you learned where the captives have been taken?

==Completion==
<Silgryn stares grimly at the communicator.>

==Notes==
The Legion Communicator has a random chance to drop off any demon in Astravar Harbor.

Upon looting it:

:{{Text|say|[[Aargoss]]|Tichar! Your attention!}}
:{{Text|say|Aargoss|The [[Nightborne]] have agreed to cast off their unwanted.}}
:{{Text|say|Aargoss|The passage to [[Felsoul Hold]] is open. See that our prisoners reach their destination.}}
:{{Text|say|Aargoss|The Soul Engine will consume! Kar Dan'Ashj!}}

Upon completing the quest:

:{{Text|say|[[Silgryn]]|Felsoul Hold... of all the ways she has betrayed us, this is surely the worst.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Victoire]]|This should shock me, but it does not. Not after the [[Waning Crescent]].}}
:{{Text|say|[[Arluelle]]|We must put an end to this.}}
