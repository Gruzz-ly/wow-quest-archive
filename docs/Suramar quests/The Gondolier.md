==Objectives==
Make contact with the Gondolier.
*Make Contact with the Gondolier

==Description==
I need your help.

The wine you so graciously distributed to the needy was the last of my reserves. Without more, these people here will risk succumbing to their thirst, and eventually becoming [[withered]].

I am dedicated to preventing this for as long as possible.

There is a woman by the name of [[Deline]] who owns and operates a small delivery service out of her gondola.

Find her, identify yourself as my messenger, and offer your aid in acquiring the next shipment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
Unless you want a ride, you should keep moving.

==Completion==
Let's get started, shall we?

==Notes==
Deline stands by her gondola at the [[Gondola Go-Go]] dock attached to [[Evermoon Bazaar]], in [[Evermoon Commons]]. Talk to her:
