==Objectives==
Explore [[Anora Hollow]] and find the Ley Station there.
* Explore Anora Hollow
* Step on Ancient Switch
* Speak with [[Arcanist Valtrois]]

==Description==
The arcways were built to tap into the magical [[leyline]]s beneath [[Suramar]]. As we learned to subsist on the [[Nightwell]], the old facilities fell out of use.

This chamber is clearly receiving power from elsewhere.

There is only a trickle now, but if you can direct more leyline energy here it will help to sustain us.

The closest source is to the north, near Anora Hollow.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
And just who might you be?

==Notes==
Upon approaching the entrance to [[Anora Hollow]], you will see the entrance closed by a portcullis. There are two small round platforms in front of it, and [[Arcanist Valtrois]] is standing on the one to the right.

:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|You there! Outlander! Be a dear and step on that other switch, will you?}}

Do as she says. The portcullis will open.

:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|There we are. Open at last.}}
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Well, I will be killing you now. Any last words?}}

Talk to Valtrois.

: You may speak.

{{Gossip|<Show [[Thalyssra]]'s [[First Arcanist's Token|token]] to Valtrois.>}}

:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Ahhh, I recognize that symbol. So Thalyssra has recruited an outlander to our cause... Are we truly so desperate?}}
:''Valtrois walks through the entrance and into [[Ley Station Anora]], continuing to speak on the way.''
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|<Sigh.> Very well. I am Valtrois.}}
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|Out here, so far from the [[Nightwell]], we must settle for any source of magic we can find.}}
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|It seems Thalyssra and I had the same idea - the old leyline feeds might keep us alive, if barely.}}
:{{Text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|We just have to wake them up.}}

Valtrois stops near an arcane coil. Turn in the quest to her.
