==Objectives==
Meet with [[Ly'leth Lunastre]] outside the [[Twilight Vineyards]].
*Speak to Ly'leth
*Ride the [[Palanquin]] to the [[Vineyard Gate]]
*Show [[Margaux]] your Loyalty

==Description==
I need you to infiltrate the Twilight Vineyards and bring back something to deal with these insects.

To do that, you will need a way to bypass the guards that keep the orchards secure.

Ly'leth will be able to help us there. I will arrange to have her meet you near the entrance.

Go quickly!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|30|}}
*8,440 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
Can I help you?

==Completion==
Let me show you around, then.

==Notes==
: ''Outside the vineyards, Ly'leth and a [[Lunastre Attendant]] are waiting for you with a magically-drawn palanquin.''
: Try not to stare for too long.  For the upper echelons of our society, this place is hardly a distraction.
''{{gossip|[[Thalyssra]] said you would be able to help me infiltrate the Twilight Vineyards.}}''
: {{text|say|Ly'leth Lunastre|I've procured a palanquin for you.  Try to look imperious- it helps with the illusion.}}
: {{text|say|Ly'leth Lunastre|The woman you are looking for is named Margaux.  She has shown interest in our cause.}}
: ''The palanquin takes you safely past the illusion-breaking [[Vineyard Warden]]s and deposits you by the stairs. Up and within is Margaux.  Nearby, her assistant [[Sylverin]] is helping aristocrats.

* May I help you?
* Please feel free to look around.
* Enjoying the vineyard?

: {{text|emote|Margaux glances to each side, silently assessing the situation.}}
: {{text|say|Margaux|A tour?  Of course!  I will show you the grounds myself.}}

: I had heard rumors... they seemed a little too good to be true.

: Bear with me- we will need to tread carefully to avoid arousing suspicion.  They are... not kind to us.
