==Objectives==
Slay 8 [[Disturbed Apparition]]s or [[Disturbed Spectre]]s.
* Disturbed ghosts slain (8)

==Description==
All I see is despair.

Look, <race>. The grounds are overwhelmed with these [[wraith]]s, [[ghost|spirit]]s of those interred here. Something has made them angry and they are lashing out. I can feel their pain.

I will go look for remaining relics, and there is a tomb I must see. It is too late for these unfortunate souls. Please defeat any you find and return them to the rest they deserve.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
Is it done?

==Completion==
It pains me to see them suffering. In time they will return, but for now they will be at peace.

==Progression==
{{Tidying Tel'anor}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
