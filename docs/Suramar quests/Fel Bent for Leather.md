==Objectives==
Collect 50 Felbat Hide Scraps for [[Kyrtos]].
* [[Felbat Hide Scraps]] (50)
* [[Fel Lash (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
Ah, my faithful assistant. I have just the task for you.

As you have seen, [[fel]] power permeates living tissue and can easily be coaxed out.

Also, [[Felbat|these damned bat]]s are driving me to my wits' end. There is an opportunity to kill two bats with one blade, it seems. Your blade.

Take this crystal. It should rip those hellions from the sky and into your waiting arms.

You may as well bring back their hides, if only to shut up [[Stalriss Dawnrunner|that fellow in the corner]] for a few moments.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you obtained the hides?

==Completion==
I can no longer hear their shrieking. Finally, peace and quiet!

==Progression==
{{Kyrtos' magic}}

==Patch changes==
