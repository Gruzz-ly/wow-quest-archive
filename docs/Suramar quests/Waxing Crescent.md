==Objectives==
Rescue [[Vanthir]] and give him an [[Arcan'dor]] fruit.
*[[Thoramir's Control Orb]]
*Free Vanthir
*[[Fruit of the Arcan'dor (Waxing Crescent)]] (provided)

==Description==
His captor is familiar to me. He is one of [[Spellblade Aluriel|Aluriel]]'s lieutenants and a skilled spell-fencer at that. You will need [[Silgryn]]'s help to retrieve the key to Vanthir's prison.

Our friend's life hangs in the balance. Even if we manage to wrestle him from the executioner's grasp, he may well Wither before we can act.

I need you to take an Arcan'dor fruit to him. They are precious, and few, but for Vanthir this is the only chance he has.

Go quickly, and good luck.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Vanthir shudders violently and stares blankly ahead. He does not seem to be aware of your presence.>

==Completion==
<Vanthir's hands dart up to snatch the fruit from your grasp.>

==Notes==
On accept:

:{{Text|say|[[First Arcanist Thalyssra]]|That took more out of me than I thought it would. You will have to free Vanthir without me. I am sorry.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Silgryn]]|Fear not, First Arcanist. I will see to it that our friend here comes to no harm.}}
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|I am sadly familiar with Vanthir's captor.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Thank you, Silgryn. Be careful.}}

Upon engaging [[Thoramir]]:
:{{Text|say|Thoramir|You think to stop this demonstration? Very well. I will make an example of you first!}}
:''Silgryn, [[Arluelle]] and [[Victoire]] run to join the battle. As the women each engage a [[Spell-Fencer Adept]], Silgryn continues unhindered to help you.''
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|Stay your blade, Thoramir!}}
: ''Silgryn leaps into the fray.''
:{{Text|say|Thoramir|How good of you to join us, Silgryn. [[Spellblade Aluriel|Aluriel]] sends her regards!}}
:{{Text|say|Thoramir|You disappointed her, spell-fencer. You could have taken my place, if you had remained.}}
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|I have a conscience. I serve the people of [[Suramar]].}}
:{{Text|say|Thoramir|Yet you raise your blades against us! You are nothing but a traitor!}}
: ''Having finished off their mobs, Arluelle and Victoire run up.''
:{{Text|say|Thoramir|Accept your fate, Silgryn! You are outmatched!}}
: ''The women join the battle.''
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|Perhaps, but ''I am not alone''.}}

Upon killing Thoramir:
:{{Text|say|Thoramir|She... was right... about you...}}
:''Thoramir falls dead at Silgryn's feet.''
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|I know.}}
: ''The three hurry off in the direction they came.''
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|We should not linger. Let us see to Vanthir now.}}

Loot [[Thoramir's Control Orb]] from his corpse, then go to the other end of the path where Silgryn, Arluelle and Victoire have spawned by Vanthir's cell. Victoire is guarding their backs as the other two face the cell. Click on the [[Containment Field]] to free Vanthir.

:{{Text|say|Silgryn|Lay still, my friend. We will get you out.}}
:{{Text|say|Arluelle|He will be fine. The fruit will bring him back.}}

On complete:

:{{Text|emote|Vanthir struggles to his feet.}}
: ''He eats the fruit. His trembling voice calms as his arcwine hunger goes away.''
:{{Text|say|Vanthir|Relief... at last...}}
: ''He steps out of the Containment Field.''
:{{Text|say|Vanthir|Aran'ethil... The nightmare is over!}}
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|Welcome back, old friend.}}
