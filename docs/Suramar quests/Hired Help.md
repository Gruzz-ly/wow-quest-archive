==Objectives==
Locate [[Arluin]] and persuade him to help you.
*Arluin Persuaded

==Description==
I was fond of [[Margaux]].  News of her death weighs heavily on many of us.

<[[Vanthir]] shakes his head sadly.>

If we are to carry on, we need to send a strong message.  We need those like [[Overseer Durant|Durant]] to know that we are watching, and we will hold them accountable.

I know someone who could help us.

His name is Arluin.  To call him a reluctant ally would be generously overstating it.  He is cautious, and will not risk himself without compensation.

You can find him in the alleys north of the [[Evermoon Bazaar]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|20|60|}}
*16,870 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
Best not to lurk if you aren't doing business.

==Completion==
I will help you, but first I need you to do something for me.

==Notes==
{{gossip|<Show Arluin you Sigil.>}}
: {{text|say|Cute.  Do you want to get us both killed?  No?  Didn't think so.}}

I might be interested in what you have to say... with the right motivation.

''{{gossip|Vanthir and I need your help to avenge-}}''

: {{text|say|Vengeance?  You can do better than that.  Much better.  In fact...}}

==Progression==
{{Blood and Wine}}
