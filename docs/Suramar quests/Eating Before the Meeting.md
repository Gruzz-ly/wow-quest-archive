==Objectives==
Feed the Fruit of the Arcan'dor to a [[Suramar Refugee]] in [[Shal'Aran]].
*Suramar Refugee cured
*[[Fruit of the Arcan'dor]] (provided)

==Description==
Having [[Vanthir]] around has done much to lift the spirits of the people here. I dare say some have begun to relish their newfound freedom, even if they miss their beloved city.

I will not rest until I can give it back to them.

You and I have an important meeting to attend. Before we go, let us distribute more of the [[arcan'dor]]'s fruit.

I want people to know that although I must leave for now, I have not abandoned them.

You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are you ready?

Very well, let us go.
