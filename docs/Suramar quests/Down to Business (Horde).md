==Objectives==
Enter the [[Grand Promenade]] and slay 15 defenders.
* Suramar defenders slain (15)

==Description==
Time to get to business, <name>. We cannot afford to tarry.

While we are not setting up for a prolonged engagement, we must still have a war camp of some sorts. I do not expect the [[Nightborne]] to stay patiently in their city while we plant stakes.

They are starting to build their defenses. Go in there and see what we are up against. You will strike them from within while we finalize our preparations.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|71|50}}
*12,340 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Enchanted Sin'dorei Banner]]

==Progress==
The Nightborne will stay out of our way or they will die.

==Completion==
Excellent. We will be able to defend our borders for now.

==Notes==
*Eligible mobs are [[Arcane Sentinel]]s, [[Duskwatch Astralite]], [[Duskwatch Battle-Magus (mob)|Duskwatch Battle-Magus]], [[Duskwatch Conjurer]]s, [[Duskwatch Defender]]s, [[Duskwatch Saberguard]]s, [[Fist of the Duskwatch|Fists of the Duskwatch]], [[Felsworn Overseer]]s, [[Felsoul Wrathguard]]s, and [[Felborne Sorcerer]]s.

==Progression==
{{An Elven Problem}}
