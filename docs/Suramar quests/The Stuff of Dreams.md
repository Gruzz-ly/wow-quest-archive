==Objectives==
Collect Purified Life Essence from the [[Emerald Dreamway]].
* [[Image of Xavius]] slain
* [[Purified Life Essence]]

==Description==
This [[arcan'dor]] is one of an ancient species. They were not bred, but created. In them the [[arcane]] and primitive [[Nature|druidic]] magics merged into something greater than both.

The arcane will soon devour it whole.

We can restore balance, but it will require wild magic. Magic trapped in another realm.

You must enter the Emerald Dreamway and bring back the essence of life itself.

Only then can the arcan'dor find stability and begin to thrive once more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Dream Tear]]

==Progress==
Do you have it?

==Completion==
I do not know how you obtained this, but I know it was not easy. Much stands against us, but you prevailed. Come. Let us restore the arcan'dor.

==Notes==
As soon as you accept the quest, a portal to the [[Emerald Dreamway]] will open behind Farodin. Enter it and kill the [[Image of Xavius]], then return. 

On complete:
: ''Farodin and [[First Arcanist Thalyssra]] approach the unstable arcan'dor, and he begins to channel the essence into the tree.''
:{{Text|say|Valewalker Farodin|Even in this state, the arcan'dor continues to grow.}}
:{{Text|say|Valewalker Farodin|A pure life essence... I only hope it is enough.}}
: ''The essence melds into the tree; the arcane lightning dissipating.''
:{{Text|say|Valewalker Farodin|[Relieved sigh]... Balance is restored. The Arcan'dor will not fail.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|We will carry this burden, Valewalker. Have a little faith.}}

As noted below, this quest previously required participation in the Emerald Nightmare raid.

While you are on this quest, the Emerald Dreamway is phased, and portals in it are not accessible.
