==Objectives==
* Nightborne Troops slain (10)
* [[Captain Fiora]] slain

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Tyrande Whisperwind]]|[[Elisande]]'s forces are waylaying refugees fleeing [[Suramar City|Suramar]] through the [[Crimson Thicket]]. A perfect opportunity to test their skills in battle!}}

==Completion==
: {{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|The once-proud [[shal'dorei]] attack their own people? This situation is even more desperate than I imagined...}}

==Gains==
* +250 reputation with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Notes==
The nightborne and felborne mobs are your targets: [[Nightborne Trapper]]s, [[Felborne Torturer]]s, [[Felborne Trapper]]s, [[Felborne Punisher]]s, and [[Torturer Relyn]].

Once you kill Captain Fiora, it's important to get away from her spawn point immediately, as she respawns in seconds. The ideal situation is to clear out the felborne at the front of the building, then draw her out and away from it.

Following the path up the other side of the pond and around the entrance to [[Kel'balor]], there are a few pairs of felborne there if you can handle more than one at a time.
