'''Survey Says...''' will complete the Chief Telemancer Oculeth portion of [[Nightfallen But Not Forgotten]].

==Objectives==
Use the Telemancy Beacon to survey the [[Ruins of Elune'eth]]. 
* Survey percentage (100)
* [[Telemancy Beacon]] (provided)

==Description==
It is time to establish the first secure connection in our teleportation network.

Take this beacon to the Ruins of Elune'eth above us and survey the area to find a suitable location.

Once your survey is complete, place the beacon and I will anchor a connection to it from here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
<This seems like a good location for the teleporter.>

==Notes==
On accept:
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Oculeth, can you restore the teleporters in this chamber?}}
: {{text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Already on it! Once out friend completes the survey, we will have our first connection.}}

The Ruins of Elune'eth are a round platform '''on the surface''', on the hill directly above [[Shal'Aran]]. Use the provided Telemancy Beacon there. A beam will start circling from your hands, scanning over the platform. It is not necessary to move.

Upon starting the survey:
: {{text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|I should mention... the survey may reveal a few tele-spatial anomalies. Maybe a warptime ripple or two...}}
: {{text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Nothing you cannot handle!}}

Kill everything that spawns, and when [[Warp Rift]]s appear, close them as soon as possible, or they will just keep spawning more elementals.

At 95%, the "boss", a [[Quantum Devourer]] will appear.

Upon reaching 100/100 survey progress:

: {{text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Survey complete. Now place the beacon!}}

Place the beacon at the designated location, then turn in the quest to it. It will open a permanent two-way portal to Shal'Aran and advance progress on [[Now You're Thinking With Portals]].

: {{text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Two-way connection established.  Use it freely - the distance is short, so it requires very little power.}}
: {{text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Now we can begin to restore the ancient network. If you find any of my old beacons out there, be sure to activate them!}}

At this point if you haven't already, you should go back and finish the [[Arcanist Kel'danath]] storyline, starting with [[An Old Ally]].  The result of this questline will complement the next questline that that one leads to.
