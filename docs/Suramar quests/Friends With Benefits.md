==Objectives==
Return to [[Thalyssra]].

==Description==
The Lunastre Attendant, silent as ever, offers you a wax-sealed scroll.

It reads:<br>
"Dearest <name>,

I asked my attendant to catch you, should things go in my favor.

The role of Advisor will keep me away from [[Lunastre Estate|the estate]] for some time and I settled on a gift for Thalyssra.

I have sent a detachment of attendants to [[Shal'Aran]] with some comfort items. Treat them well- they need someone to wait on and I could think of none better!

Give the others my thanks, and my love,<br>
Advisor [[Ly'leth Lunastre]]"

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
She certainly is a worthy companion.

==Notes==
On returning to Shal'Aran, two Lunastre Attendants walk about with drinks.  [[Almon]] stands by tables with food and drink.  Magically lighted pots hold growing plants for decor with more benches about.  The rugs serving as areas for the refugees are now festooned with pillows and large cushions to sleep on.  There are sets of some kind of board game to pass the time.  More supplies are stacked out of the way.

However the biggest change is the that the [[arcan'dor]] is producing an arcane storm!  Thalyssra and Farodin are wisely deciding to keep their distance, while Valtrois has moved downstairs by the aperture.
