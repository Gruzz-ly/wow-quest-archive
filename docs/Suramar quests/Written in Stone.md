==Description==
<You bundle the notes and store them away in your pack.

The spellstone, if not the arcanist himself, must be nearby.>

*16,450 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
<This withered seems entranced by the spellstone. He is completely pacified.>

==Completion==
<A small tag hanging from his sleeve reads "16 - Theryn.">

==Notes==
The spellstone drops from [[Arcanist Kel'danath]] himself, who has turned into a [[withered]]. Upon looting the stone, {{Npc||Theryn|Subject 16}} runs to you, letting you turn in the quest to him.
