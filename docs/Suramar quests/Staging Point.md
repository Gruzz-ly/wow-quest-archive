==Objectives==
Activate the Astravar Beacon.
* Telemancy Beacon activated

==Description==
That is quite a corridor you and our allies have punched through the city. It will be difficult to hold but it will cut a wedge in [[Elisande]]'s forces.

[[Oculeth]] has been busy redirecting a telemancy beacon to this location but wanted to give you the honor of activating it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Has the beacon been activated?

==Completion==
Well done, hero. With this as our staging ground, our forces have a clear shot at the city gates.

[[Thalyssra]] has ordered her rebels to secure our location and cover our rear flank.

Once we have our siege vehicles in place we should be ready to assault the city.

==Notes==
Go through the entrance immediately behind Oculeth and Khadgar, then turn left. There you will find the location where you need to place the beacon.

Upon activating the beacon:
:''Oculeth approaches the new portal.''
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|The portal worked and we are still in one piece. Good! I was worried we might overload the network by adding another beacon.}}
:''Oculeth enters the portal and disappears.''

Do not enter the portal yourself (as you can expect, it leads to [[Shal'Aran]]). Instead, exit the building through the back entrance, opposite to where you entered it. That is where you turn in the quest. Khadgar will be there with all four elven leaders.

==Progression==
{{March on Suramar}}
