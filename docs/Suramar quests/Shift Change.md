==Objectives==
Hide in the basket and wait for the guard to appear. Follow the guard to their destination.
*Wait for the Guard to Appear
*Follow the Guard
*Open Korine's Cage

==Description==
This is as good a chance as we are going to get to rescue [[Verene]]'s daughter.

Here is how this is going to work.

You are going to wait here for the guard to pass by on their way to their guard shift. Look for something to hide in.

<Silgryn marks a spot on your map.>

You will know the guard by their bright red armor.

Follow closely, but not so closely that you are seen. It may be necessary to kill the guard when you reach your destination.

The child's name is [[Korine]]. Good luck.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]
*{{cost|20|60}}
*16,870 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
W-who are you?

==Completion==
I-I thought... they were gonna... *sniff*

==Notes==
Hide in the [[Conveniently Placed Basket]]. When [[Guard Morgaine]] appears, follow her, but stay outside the circle. She will occasionally turn back, so it's best to keep some distance from the edge of the circle, too.

Note that a [[Burning Chaplain]] can spawn right by the basket.  The best scenario is to stay in the basket. If you get caught outside of it, kill everything that attacks or run away.  Either way, you will have to do another attempt.

When the guard reaches her destination:

:{{Text|say|Guard Morgaine|Keep it down, brats. You will join the others soon.}}

Upon attacking Guard Morgaine:

:{{Text|say|Guard Morgaine|Where did you come from? Intruder!}}

Kill her, loot the [[Control Orb]] from her, and use it to dispel the barrier around Korine.

On completion, all the secondary quest lines that you haven't started/completed will be highlighted on the zone map.
