==Objectives==
Convince [[Lady Anastae]] to give you the [[Gemcutter's Tome]].
*Lady Anastae persuaded

==Description==
Amateur merchants complain about supply and demand. Masters create their own.

You have done well retrieving the last two pieces I requested, but they are baubles compared to this.

Your target is the [[Lady Anastae]], and she has something very valuable of mine: A design for a masterwork gem cut. 

Go and get it from her by any means necessary, but take care. She is a master manipulator and will tell you all manner of lies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*12,340 [[XP]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
What do you want?

==Completion==
[[Lespin Silverleaf|Lespin]] shall pay for his crimes!

==Notes==
Speak with [[Lady Anastae]]
{{Dialogue|
Yes, what is it? I am very busy planning my next gala.
