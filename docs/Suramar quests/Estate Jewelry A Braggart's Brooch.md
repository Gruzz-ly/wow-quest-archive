==Objectives==
Retrieve Lespin's Brooch from [[Naltethis|Naltethis Springblade]].
* Speak with Naltethis
* Recover [[Lespin's Brooch]]

==Description==
Amateur [[merchant]]s worry about losing face from bad products. Masters worry about losing face from bad customers.

Naltethis Springblade has grown too bold for his station, and as such has lost much standing in the eyes of the [[Suramar City|city]]'s elite.

I sold this man a brooch, a clasp he wears on his cape. I am careful to only sell to those above my station.

My pieces never tarnish, but my name and reputation are much more fragile. Relieve him of my property before he lowers me further.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|19|40|}}

==Progress==
That oaf will undo years of hard work. It is so much easier to fall than it is to climb...

==Completion==
Ahh, see! I told you it would not tarnish. Now there's nothing linking me to that fool...

What's that? A plot to weaken his position? Regardless, the damage has been done. Better safe than sorry.

==Gains==
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Notes==
[[Venlis Swiftsea]] can be found in a house at {{Coords|41.2|64.6|Suramar}}.
