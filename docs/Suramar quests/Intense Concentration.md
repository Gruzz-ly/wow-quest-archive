==Objectives==
Catch 15 drops of Nightwell Essence using an Energy Vessel.
*Pick Up an [[Energy Vessel]]
*Collect Nightwell Essence (15)
*[[Unfortified Arcwine|Infuse Arcwine]]

==Description==
This is a rare treat, I hope you know.  Not just anyone is allowed to stand on this hallowed ground.

<[[Sylverin]] adjusts his cuffs in a dignified fashion.>

To participate in the demonstration, simply take up an energy vessel and wade into the pool beside us.

Catch the delicate dewdrops of [[Nightwell]] energy in the bowl as they fall- this is the only way one can safely manage its essence.

Once your vessel is full, proceed to our demonstration cask and gently pour the amalgamation into it.

Enjoy!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|20|60}}
*16,870 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Nightglow Energy Vessel]]

==Progress==
Having trouble?

==Completion==
Simple, no?

==Notes==
The swirls indicate where the dewdrops will fall; do not touch the fonts or risk being vaporized.  Afterwards just interact with the cask of [[Unfortified Arcwine]].
