==Objectives==
Overcharge 3 Imperial Conjurers using the Inert Crystal.  You must be standing on a Mana Focuser to use the crystal.
* [[Imperial Conjurer]] Overcharged (3)
* [[Inert Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
Do you see the [[Nightborne]] outside this room?

They hold us here, like mice in a cage.  It is more convenient for them that we are pinned down while they search the [[Starweaver's Sanctum|Sanctum]] for my father's relics.

My companions and I can escape to higher ground with some help.

Take this crystal.  While standing on a [[mana]] focusing rune, use it to overcharge a Conjurer.

Their summons will turn on them and create an opening.

Use it well, and we will meet you atop the [[Moon Guard Stronghold|stronghold]] when the way is clear.

''Accept:''
: {{text|say|Syrana Starweaver|We will move when the way is clear.  Your bravery is worth more than you know, friend.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

== Progress ==
The way is not yet clear.  We are ready to move when you have created an opening for us.

==Completion==
We were able to make it here safely, thanks to you.

== Notes ==
Use the quest to get to [[Conjurer Thalerian]] for [[The Orchestrator of Our Demise]]. The stairs to go further up and find Syrana are nearby him.

==Progression==
{{Moon Guard Stronghold}}
