==Objectives==
* Prisoners freed (4)

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Vanthir]]|Innocents are being jailed all across the city. This cannot stand! Slay the guards, take their control orbs, and set my people free.}}

==Rewards==
* +200 reputation with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
: {{text|say|Vanthir|Surely many of those you freed were to be exiled. You saved many lives today.}}

== Notes ==
Loot a [[Control Orb (wq)]] from [[Duskwatch Scion]]s, but some other types of guards apparently also have them. You can reapply your disguise before using orbs; freeing prisoners won't break it.

There have been bugs in the past, such as all collected orbs being used up on one cage, or not dropping if you have one in your bags. IF you have to, kill a guard, loot an orb, then free a prisoner. If you end up with two on you, try kill one of them and free a prisoner before killing the other.
