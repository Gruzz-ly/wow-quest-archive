Assign new roles to [[Micah Broadhoof]], [[Boss Mida]], and [[Nomi]].

If you need suggestions, I'm happy to help.

Vintner Iltheux seems pleased. You've really got a knack for this, <name>!

==Notes==
On accept, Meerah starts following the player around.
:{{Text|say|Meerah|Let's get to work!}}

Return to Micah, Mida, and Nomi. This time you have three dialogue options for each person; Meerah will have something to say about each one. The correct options are in '''bold type'''.

;Micah Broadhoof
:Greetings, <name>.
:I've never made wine before, but it can't be too difficult, can it?
:*{{Gossip|You should be obtaining ingredients.}}
:::Understood. I will do whatever is needed.
:::{{Gossip|On second thought...}}
:::{{Text|say|Meerah|Uh, are you sure about that? Have you seen the size of his hooves?}}
:*{{Gossip|'''You should be stomping fruit.'''}}
:::I look forward to helping in any way I can.
:::{{Text|say|Meerah|Wise choice. [[Highmountain tauren|Highmountain Tauren]] are really strong!}}
:*{{Gossip|You're doing a great job.}}
:::You are too kind, <name>.
:::{{Text|say|Meerah|While words of encouragement are always welcome...}}

;Boss Mida
:Look at [[Kazit]], workin' so hard.
:He'll get the hang of it eventually.
:*{{Gossip|'''You should be obtaining ingredients.'''}}
:::You got it! I'll send Kazit out to find whatever ingredients ya need.
:::{{Text|say|Meerah|Seems like a good fit! [[Goblin]]s can acquire anything, at any time.}}
:*{{Gossip|You should be creating the recipe.}}
:::Okay, sure. I can have Kazit make the wine, and{{Sic}} long as you don't expect me to drink it.
:::{{Gossip|On second thought...}}
:::{{Text|say|Meerah|Hmm, I don't know if that's the best use of Mida's talents...}}
:*{{Gossip|You're doing a great job.}}
:::I really am, aren't I? Tellin' this one what to do 'aint{{Sic}} as easy as it looks!
:::{{Text|say|Meerah|Nothing wrong with positive reinforcement, but...}}

;Nomi
:Greetings, Master <name>. I was just resting my eyes for a moment. How can I help you?
:*{{Gossip|'''You should be creating the recipe.'''}}
:::That sounds wonderful! I do love working with food and drink.
:::{{Text|say|Meerah|Good call. Nomi is well known for his culinary creations.}}
:*{{Gossip|You should be stomping fruit.}}
:::I'll do what is asked, but does this mean I'll have to get my feet wet?
:::{{Gossip|On second thought...}}
:::{{Text|say|Meerah|More like sleeping on the fruit...}}
:*{{Gossip|You're doing a great job.}}
:::You're too kind. We both know the truth though.
:::{{Text|say|Meerah|You did see him sleeping, right?}}

Once you've assigned all three to their new roles:
:{{Text|say|Meerah|Let's tell the vintner about the changes we've made.}}

Head back to the building where Meerah camped her wagon and enter to talk to Iltheux:
:I hope you're here to help. Things are in such a state! We'll never meet our quota without some serious changes.
:{{Gossip|We've made some adjustments to your production pipeline.}}
:I trust your judgment, <name>. I am sure whatever changes you've enacted will produce the needed results.

Talk to Meerah again to turn in.
