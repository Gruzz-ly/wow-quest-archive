==Objectives==
Seek [[Mythandros Irongrove|Mythandros]] at [[Irongrove Retreat]].

==Description==
We have three blessings from the creatures we share this land with.

Combined with a blessing from [[Elune]], the [[moonwell]] will watch over this land for years to come.

Meet Mythandros at the retreat. I am sure he would like to include you in the ritual.

==Completion==
Welcome back. I see we are ready to begin.

==Notes==
On accept:

:{{Text|say|Solendra Featherdown|I will bring the blessing to Mythandros directly. See you there!}}
: ''She shapeshifts to [[storm crow]] form and flies off.''

Return to Irongrove Retreat to find the night elves gathered in front of the moonwell, ready for the ritual.
