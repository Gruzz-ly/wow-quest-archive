==Objectives==
Slay 50 Nightborne With the Trap Rune.
* [[Nightborne]] Slain (50)

==Description==
They ransacked my library, <name>.

If they want our knowledge, we will give it to them.

This piece of rune work will allow you to cast an ensnaring spell on the ground.  When the Nightborne cross the threshold they will see the true might of the [[Moon Guard]].

Teach them well!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progress==
How fares the education?

==Completion==
A lesson we all must one day learn. Never assume your enemy dead until you see their corpse. <Lothrius grins.>
