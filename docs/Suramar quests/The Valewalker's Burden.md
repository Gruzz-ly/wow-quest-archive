==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Valewalker Farodin.jpg|Valewalker Farodin}}
Activate the [[Fal'adora Beacon]] in [[Temple of Fal'adora]].
*Fal'adora Beacon activated

==Description==
The seed is awakening.  Without power it will quickly wither and die.

We must carry the seed out of here and plant it somewhere safe.

I am not strong enough to bear this burden.  But you... you are brimming with power.  I can sense it.

Please take the seed.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Touch of the Arcan'dor|id=||icon=}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Arcane Seed Case]]

==Completion==
<The seed sits perfectly atop the stand and sinks in with a satisfying click.>

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|[[Valewalker Farodin]]|This passage will lead us out.}}

Follow Farodin to the [[Temple of Fal'adora]]. Upon entering it:
:{{Text|say|Valewalker Farodin|Not far now.}}
:{{Text|say|Valewalker Farodin|I know you have been rebuilding the old teleporters. The beacon here will connect us to your [[shal'dorei]] friends.}}

Activate the beacon.
:{{Text|say|[[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]]|Ah, the Temple of Fal'adora. Those halls once glowed with prayers to [[Elune]].}}
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|I imagine it is less hospitable now. Hold still, I will get you out of there.}}

A permanent two-way portal to [[Shal'Aran]] will open, giving you credit for [[Now You're Thinking With Portals]].

Enter the portal. Farodin will run to the central platform of Shal'Aran, where there is an [[Ancient Seed Holder]] similar to the one on which the seed rested back in [[Moonshade Sanctum]].
:{{Text|say|Valewalker Farodin|Quickly, you must plant the seed!}}
:{{Text|say|Valewalker Farodin|Place it here, where it can drink of the leyline.}}

On complete, a short cutscene plays, showing the case opening and the seed within blossoming into a sapling growing from the central platform.  [[First Arcanist Thalyssra]] and [[Arcanist Valtrois]] run over to witness it while [[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]] teleports over.
:{{Text|say|Valewalker Farodin|It is an [[arcan'dor]] - a gift of the ancient magi.}}
:{{Text|say|Valewalker Farodin|A tree, made to feed upon the leyline. It can bring life... or desolation.}}
: ''Oculeth teleports back to his spot.''
: {{text|say|Valewalker Farodin|To care for the arcan'dor is a great burden - one which we now share.}}
: (NOTE: Thalyssra's quote may bug out and not appear at all.)
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|We are masters of the arcane, [[night elf]].  I think we can handle a tree.}}
: {{text|say|Valewalker Farodin|Hmph.  Arrogant.  In time, you will see.}}
: {{text|say|Valewalker Farodin|Beneath the arcan'dor, you will be renewed.  There is no other path now.}}

==Progression==
{{The Light Below}}

==Patch changes==
*'''Unknown patch''': The receptacle for the Ancient Seed is now named "Ancient Seed Holder" instead of its former placeholder name, "Doodad_7sr_hubmanatree_seedholder001".
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
