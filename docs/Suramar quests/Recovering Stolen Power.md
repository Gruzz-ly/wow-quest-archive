==Objectives==
Acquire a Volatile Spell Focus.
* [[Volatile Spell Focus]]

==Description==
My injuries will not kill me, but I cannot fight.  I have my own idea of how to deal with the remaining [[Nightborne]].

They destroyed our defense matrix as soon as they arrived.  Surely one of them carries the spell focus necessary to reactivate it.

Find it, then go to a [[hippogryph]].  They linger throughout the Stronghold.

These loyal beasts will take you to the skies and take care of the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Progression==
{{Moon Guard Stronghold}}

==Patch changes==
