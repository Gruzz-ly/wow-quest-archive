==Description==
[[Thalyssra]] is right to be concerned!

The network has not responded to my attempts to re-establish connection with the Waning Crescent. I do not know what happened, but given the circumstances I believe it prudent to investigate in person.

<Name>, would you do the honors? I will send you as close to the Waning Crescent as I can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16450 [[XP]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

== Progress ==
[[Elisande]]... how could you?

==Completion==
Someone must have informed the Grand Magistrix of [[Vanthir]]'s involvement in the rebellion. Such violence is...

Elisande... How could you?

==Notes==
On accept:
: ''Oculeth walks up to the teleport pad then points to it as he speaks.''
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|No need to delay. Onto the pad with you.}}
: ''You step onto it to prepare for transport.  Oculeth starts casting.''
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|I will get you as close to the Crescent as I can. We will be in touch.}}
: ''You end up at [[Artisan's Gallery]], in one of the safehouses for [[Safe Keeping]].''
:{{Text|say|Chief Telemancer Oculeth|Hmph. Not as close as I'd like, but it will have to do. Be careful.}}

The Waning Crescent is full of [[Duskwatch Punisher]]s, demons, and dead and captured civilians.

Upon examining the [[Broken Telemancy Beacon]]:

: The Telemancy Beacon lies in several pieces. A faint buzzing sound emanates from the cracked crystal core.

: Oculeth's voice is audible through the noise, but the words are too indistinct to make out.

: Whoever destroyed this beacon intended to cut off all contact with the outside world.

;Upon approaching [[Silgryn]]
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|There you are! Over here!}}
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|Elisande knows about [[Vanthir]]'s involvement with the rebellion. He is gone.}}

On complete, and on accepting the next two quests:

:{{Text|say|Silgryn|I will move ahead and clear out a safe haven for the survivors. Stay strong, my friend.}}
