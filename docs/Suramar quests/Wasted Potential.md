==Completion==
I heard rumors that you intend to leave [[Suramar City|the City]]... that there is another place for the [[Nightborne]] where we are not beholden to [[Elisande]]'s insanity.

I wish to go with you.

I can offer my harp and my hands, as they are not wanted here.

Say the word and I will go with you through the teleporter and share my music with whomever awaits me on the other side.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Notes==
Once [[Shal'Aran]] is more settled depending on how many questlines you've already done or do further, Rosaine can be found on the west side of the south alcove, playing for an increasing number of refugees sitting on the floor.
