==Objectives==
Chase the [[Lost Feathermane Kitten]] across the bridge and return it to its family.
* Chase the Lost Owlkitten Across the Bridge
* Follow the Lost Owlkitten Home

==Description==
The first step to establishing a [[moonwell]] is to gain the blessings of the local wildlife.

It is their good will that enables us to peacefully coexist, and a moonwell thrives on such energies. Combined with [[Elune]]'s light, a moonwell can purify its surroundings for years.

To begin, we must find creatures willing to give their blessing. We can start with these owl-cat creatures.

They ran while you cleaned, but I saw one lingering just before the bridge.

See if you can find where it lives!

==Rewards==

To herd the kitten, approach it from the direction opposite to where you want it to go next. Repeat as necessary.

You may get two copies.
