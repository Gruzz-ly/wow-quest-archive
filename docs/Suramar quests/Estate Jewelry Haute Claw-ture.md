==Objectives==
Find and retrieve Lespin's 'art' from Mornath.
* Speak with [[Mornath]]
* [["The Claw Clacks for Thee"]]

==Description==
An amateur merchant looks back on their previous work as a learning experience. A master knows that some things are better left forgotten.

I was... vain, centuries ago. Desperate to prove myself, I took on a bold commission.

Find him and bring... it... back. You will know what I am talking about when you see it.

He resides near the villa south of this courtyard.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
He was so passionate, so driven. I saw his vision, created it to his exact specifications. Beautiful filigree and enamel put to a fearsome weapon...

==Completion==
By the [[Elisande|Magistrix]], I had forgotten how ugly that thing is. Impeccable workmanship, obviously. Just... ugh. I should melt the whole thing down.
