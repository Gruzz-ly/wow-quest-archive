==Objectives==
Speak with Thaedris at the upper landing of [[Tel'anor]].
*Speak with [[Thaedris Feathersong|Thaedris]].

==Description==
I cannot call [[Suramar City|Suramar]] my home any more, and I refuse to become a [[withered]] abomination. There is no place for me anymore, don't you understand?

We only need one last ingredient to complete the elixir. You will help me, won't you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*12,340 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Please let me fulfill my wishes, <name>.

==Completion==
Your arguments are not without merit, <name>. But I remain steadfast.

==Notes==
;Dialogue
''{{gossip|We may have a way to stave off the hunger - long enough to find a cure. Let us help.}}''

: Do not be afraid, for I am not. I will soon be reunited with my lady love. These heroes that surround you were men and women just like me. They too had their own loves and vices, and they understood the meaning of sacrifice. Let this be mine.

: <Thaedris sighs.>

: Perhaps you are right, <name>. I have been so tired and weary with the shame of our people. I believed that I had no path, no recourse. Truly it would be impossible for me to atone for our actions. I am no hero, despite what you may think. I am simply an old man who has seen too much for one lifetime.
