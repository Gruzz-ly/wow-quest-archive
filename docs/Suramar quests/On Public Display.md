==Objectives==
Help [[Thalyssra]] complete the Scrying Ritual.
*Talk to Thalyssra
*Track [[Vanthir]]'s Location

==Description==
Now that I have identified Vanthir's essence from the multitude of [[Suramar Cty|Suramar]]'s citizens, it may be that I can find his exact location.

I believe you'll recall a similar ritual with our friend [[Theryn]]. Do not worry- there will be less screaming this time. Hopefully.

Come. Let us find our missing tavernkeeper.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I need to maintain complete focus.

==Completion==
That was... difficult... but I am glad we succeeded.

==Notes==

: ''Thalyssra and [[Silgryn]] walk around the center sculpture to stand on the other side of it, faceing northeast.
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|What manner of spell is this?}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|One that will find our friend.}}

;Talk to Thalyssra
:I will need to maintain my focus for this to work... are you prepared to assist me in this endeavor?
''{{Gossip|I am ready, Thalyssra.}}''

Thalyssra starts scrying. Keep clicking on the images that spawn around Evermoon Terrace.

:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Talk to me, Vanthir...}}
:''In the left alcove a ghostly image appears, showing a [[Duskwatch]] guard confronting Vanthir as a [[doomguard]] flies down and lands beside them; it towers over them as Vanthir cowers in fear.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|The moment he was taken from the [[Waning Crescent]] he felt such terrible fear... but not for himself.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Fear for those that he sheltered, those he sacrificed for.}}

: ''Vanthir appears in the center alcove, under the effects of whithering.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|He was taken somewhere dark and isolated. He began to feel hunger settling its roots in his gut.}}
: ''He lays down, helplessly trembling.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Hunger that did not pass, but grew...}}
: ''He transforms into the nightfallen state.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|... Until he could think of nothing else!}}

Dismiss the echo to proceed.

:''In the right alcove, an image appears showing Vanthir frantically moving about in a cage, and a Duskwatch guard watching over him.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|He is near to withering. His thoughts are jumbled, frantic... I just need to...}}
:''The guard steps away from the cage and salutes someone, as Vanthir lays down, trembling.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Focus! There!}}

Dismiss the echos to proceed.

: ''Thalyssra kneels, fatigued.''
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|He is being held at the [[Terrace of Order]]! It must be time for the display...}}
