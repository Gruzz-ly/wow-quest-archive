Both [[The Lost Advisor]] and [[An Ancient Recipe]] are available at the beginning.

==Objectives==
Collect 6 Harpy Talons.
* [[Harpy Talon]] (6)

==Description==
[[Suramar City|Suramar]] is... was... an intellectual's dream.

We studied everything in there, from [[alchemy]] and the arts to the very nature of [[magic]] itself. How could we be so foolish as to accept [[Burning Legion|them]] in?

Look at me, lost in the clouds again when there is much to be done. My work requires some fairly difficult ingredients, <race>. Perhaps you would help me procure them?

I am going to need some [[harpy]] talons. Crushed into a powder, they will be a potent reagent.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=|Magically-Fortified Vial
}}

==Progress==
Do you have what I require, <race>? We don't have much time to spare.

==Completion==
That should be plenty. Talondust loses its potency fairly quickly, so we must make haste.

==Progression==
{{Tidying Tel'anor}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
