==Objectives==
Attack on [[Felsoul Hold]]

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[First Arcanist Thalyssra]]|The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] landed right on our doorstep - and [[Elisande]] simply let them in. ''Disgusting.'' Strike at Felsoul Hold! Show the Legion that some of us are not so easily broken!}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Ru-shanna shal'dorei. The [[Nightborne]] will survive.}}

==Notes==
Kill any demon that counts. One way is to kill an [[Abhorrent Artificer]] to loot their [[Legion Ammunition]], which provides unlimited shots for a Fel Cannon. Shoot down enough [[Sinister Shrieker]]s to fill the progress bar.

This method is also the objective of [[Clear the Skies]].
