==Objectives==
Meet [[Andaris Narassin|Andaris]] at the [[Lunastre Estate]] in [[Suramar City]].   
*(Optional) Take the Lunastre Estate Teleporter
*Andaris confronted
*[[Terrified Lunastre Attendant|Terrified Citizens]] rescued (6)

==Description==
Make no mistake. This message cannot be taken lightly. Any threat made against our people will be dealt with swiftly.

We must travel to the estate at once to discover what has become of [[Ly'leth Lunastre|Ly'leth]]. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Completion==
The withered... defeated so easily.

We must find a way to [[Anti-magic|negate]] the magic of the [[felborne]]. We cannot afford to fight if our own can be turned against us.

==Notes==
Look for any [[Terrified Lunastre Attendant]]s and [[Terrified Lunastre Noble]]s on the estate. You will need to be extra careful while doing this quest, as you won't have access to your [[Masquerade]] disguise. Additionally, you won't be able to see Thalyssra (and thus interact with) at [[Shal'Aran]] until the quest is ready for turn-in.

Use the teleporter to quickly return to Shal'Aran when you are done.

;Quest accept
:{{text|say|[[First Arcanist Thalyssra]]|I will take the teleporter to the estate and bring our most powerful [[Withered]]. Meet me there.}}
:''Thalyssra hurries off.''

;Confront Andaris
:''Thalyssra and the [[adventurer]] arrive at the estate with a couple of Withered. An image of Andaris Narassin and Ly'leth Lunastre are seen beside a [[Felborne Marauder]].''
:{{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|[[Elisande]] made YOU First Arcanist? The pickings must have been slim indeed. Release Ly'leth now!}}
:{{text|say|Andaris Narassin|Ha! This is what you bring? An outlander and a pack of mindless, mana-starved corpses? You have fallen on hard times indeed.}}
: ''Thalyssra advances and the Withered step out in front of her.''
:{{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|I'll show you what these corpses can do. Attack!}}
:{{text|say|Andaris Narassin|As if I would bother with facing you myself. Felborne! Kill them!}}
:''The marauder quickly casts a spell, causing a fel spike to erupt from the ground beneath the Withered while Thalyssra is caught by the outer edge. Driven mad by the fel flames, the Withered run about until they die.''
:{{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|The Withered... defeated so easily by fel magic. Please... save those you can. My wounds... are of no concern!}}
:''Thalyssra takes the teleporter back to Shal'Aran.''
