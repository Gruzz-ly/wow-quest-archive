Simply kill all the fal'dorei as they stream into the sanctum.

Upon killing all three mobs required for the quest, a cutscene plays.

:''You try to take the [[Moonshade Relic]], but the fal'dorei knock you down and wrap you in a cocoon.''
:{{Text|say|Orathiss|Ahh a gift fit for a queen. You have my thanks...}}
:''Orathiss grabs the relic.''
:{{Text|say|Orathiss|Now the power of the [[arcan'dor]] is mine!}}
:''Orathiss leaves with the relic. Suddenly, a [[Valewalker Farodin|night elf with a scythe]] appears, chases off the remaining fal'dorei, and frees you.''

Turn in the quest to your unexpected savior.
