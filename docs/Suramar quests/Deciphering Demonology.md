==Objectives==
Crate artifacts into 5 Restored Artifacts and find 5 Chamber Key Fragments and bring them to [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]].
*[[Restored Artifact]] (5)
*[[Chamber Key Fragment]] (5)

==Description==
I found a piece of what appears to be a key to something. I'm certain I can restore it if we can find the other bits.

After that, we need to figure out what it's a key to. An' I think I know how to do that.

I've been studying some of the artifacts I've found, and they seem to be pointing to a hidden chamber. I jes' need some more artifacts to study.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How goes the search? 

==Completion==
I'm startin' ta think you may be as good an archaeologist as I am. But don't let that go ta yer head, <lad/lass>.

<Brann lets out a chuckle and begins to study the artifacts you brought him.>

Aye, that's it! I know where the chamber is. And once I've reassembled tha key, we're in business.

==Notes==
[[Restored Artifact]]s are created from items obtained by solving regular archaeology projects. The [[Chamber Key Fragment]]s can be found while surveying a Suramar [[Dig site#Broken Isles|dig site]] and occasionally dropped by a [[Wyrmtongue Collector]].
