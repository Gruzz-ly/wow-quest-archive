: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|What is this place?}}
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|This chamber... I have never seen anything like it.}}
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|So dark...}}
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|In'alah!}}
: ''Thalyssra casts a spell that powers up lights all over the outer wall.''
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Much better.}}
: ''She passes by the inactive teleportation platforms.''
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Old teleporters. Not so different from the ones in [[Suramar City|Suramar city]]. Seems they are inactive.}}
: ''She jogs for the staircase and heads down.''
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Let us explore downstairs. Watch your step.}}
:''Downstairs, she turns on the lights and stops near the beam of light emanating upwards from the aperture in the center of the floor.''
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Strange. The floor looks like... a map?}}
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|And we are at the center...}}
: ''She walks up to the aperture and kneels to examine it.''
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|One thing is certain - leyline energy is being fed into this chamber from elsewhere.}}
: ''Standing, she heads for the other staircase.''
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|What could have required such power? A weapon, perhaps?}}
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|And those keepers protecting it... How long their vigil must have been...}}
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|<Sigh.> I have more questions now than before!}}
: ''Upstairs, she looks over at where [[Keeper Selentia]] was.''
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|For now, at least, we know the [[withered]] have learned to avoid this place.}}
: ''She walks over to what will be her usual spot.''
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|And nobody from the [[Nighthold|palace]] would think to search for us here.}}
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|It is a perfect refuge. A temporary home, until I can return to Suramar.}}
: {{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|But first, I will need allies.}}
