==Objectives==
Escape [[Siren's Vigil]].
*Follow [[Silgryn]]
*Ride on [[Deline]]'s Gondola
*Teleport to the Top of the Terrace

==Description==
These people may be able to hold out here, but I know for certain that we cannot.

Every moment we spend here places them in danger of [[Elisande]]'s forces retaliating against us.

We need to move. We need to find a place to regroup and recover.

Follow me. I think I know how we can get out of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16450 [[XP]]
*[[Enchanted Nightborne Coin]]

==Completion==
[[Oculeth]] has anticipated our arrival. Good, one less thing to worry on.

==Notes==
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|I hope she sees this...}}
: ''Silgryn runs outside and shoots a firework into the air.''
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|This way! Everyone into the boat!}}

Silgryn and the refugees run to the dock, as [[Deline]] berths her gondola.

:{{Text|say|Silgryn|Excellent timing as usual, Deline.}}

'''Do not attempt to jump into the boat!''' You will fall through it, into the water. Instead, wait until the boat becomes interactable (with a "board vehicle" cursor), and click on it. Thankfully, you can do it from the water as well.

As the gondola casts off:
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|We need a foothold, somewhere we can keep an eye on things.}}
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|Ahh... The Terrace. It will have to do for now. Take us as close as you can, Deline.}}

Upon stepping off the boat at [[Evermoon Terrace]]:
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|See that these people escape the city, Deline. <Name>, stay with me.}}
: ''Silgryn runs around the tower building until he gets close to its teleporter.  He points to it.''
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|This way!}}

Follow Silgryn and use the teleporter to the upper level.
:{{Text|say|Silgryn|Now all we need is a{{sic}} to make contact with--}}
:{{Text|say|[[Chief Telemancer Oculeth]]|Outlander, can you hear me? Outlander? I am going to teleport a beacon your way!}}

;On completion
:''There is also a beacon pad in the next archway, on which Oculeth teleports the new Telemancy Beacon.''
