==Objectives==
Acquire 20 Bottles of Arcwine.
*[[Bottle of Arcwine]] (20)

==Description==
I would imagine you thought I would simply have wine to deliver.

<Deline chuckles.>

If it were that easy, his people would not be starving.

<Her expression becomes serious.>

These... loyalists, shall we say, enjoy abundance. They dance to [[Elisande|the Magistrix]]'s whims and so they have all that they need.

There is no [[Arcwine]] shortage. The Magistrix created one to keep us in line.

They will not miss a few bottles. They have plenty.

Search the square and bring as much as you can carry back.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|20|60|}}
*16,870 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
Did you find enough?

==Completion==
I will see that this gets back to our friend safely. Good work.

==Notes==
Bottles and casks of arcwine are scattered all over [[Evermoon Bazaar]]. Each cask is worth 10 bottles for quest credit, but you need to deliver it to the gondola on your back; it slows down your movement and makes you unable to mount while you're carrying it, so watch out for guards!

Whenever you inform Deline that you have a cask:

''{{gossip|I found a cask of wine!}}
:{{Text|say|Deline|Ah! This cask contains a large amount of arcwine. Go ahead and put it into the gondola.}}

==Progression==
