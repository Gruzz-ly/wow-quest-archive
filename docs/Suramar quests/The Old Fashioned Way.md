==Description==
While you experienced the raw majesty that is [[Nightwell Infusion]], Margaux was busy preparing another demonstration for you.

Enjoy the remainder of your tour!

<[[Sylverin]] offers an intensely fake smile.>

==Progress==
Having fun?

==Completion==
I will be certain to have a bottle of your [[arcwine]] prepared for you before you leave.

==Notes==
{{Dialogue|
We are preparing to make the unfortified wine.  Are you ready to assist?

{{gossip|Yes, I am ready to help make arcwine.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Margaux|Take your place near the table.  Once we begin, it is important that we keep up the pace.  These delicate ingredients spoil quickly.}}

Margaux will give you a total of six instructions at random to follow.

===Directions===
;Silver Jasmine
:{{text|say|Margaux|Ah!  It needs something floral, to add a little brightness.}}

;Shadefruit
:{{text|say|Margaux|I think a sour note is in order.  Add a shadefruit, please.}}

;Purified Water
:{{text|say|Margaux|Let us add a little moisture.  Just enough to keep the taps flowing.}}

;Stomping
: {{text|say|Margaux|The juices need a little massaging- step into the vat and ''jump'' to squish the mixture around!}}

;Next instruction
*{{text|say|Margaux|You, my friend, are a natural.  The blend needs something more, though.  Let me think...}}
*{{text|say|Margaux|Exactly what it needed.  But there is still something missing...}}
*{{text|say|Margaux|Well done.  Now let me see...}}

===Fail===
:{{text|bossemote|The arcwine has soured... you must start over!}}
*{{text|say|Margaux|Are you certain you are ready to participate? This batch will have to be destroyed.}}
*{{text|say|Margaux|Hm... the ingredients have soured. We will have to start again I am afraid.}} (Note: The voice actor actually says "I'm afraid" instead of "I am afraid.")
*{{text|say|Margaux|I feel as though you are losing focus. Is something else on your mind? Step back for a moment and we will try again.}}

===Success===
:{{text|say|Margaux|Excellent!  You did ''very'' well- are you certain you have never made wine before?  I will have this bottled immediately.}}

==Progression==
{{Blood and Wine}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
