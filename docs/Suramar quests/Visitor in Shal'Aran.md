==Objectives==
Meet the stranger outside [[Shal'Aran]].
*Meet the Stranger
*Introduce [[Arluelle]] to [[Thalyssra]]

==Description==
Someone came to Shal'Aran while you were in [[Suramar City|the City]]. She asked for you specifically.

I did not recognize her face, nor her voice, but she seemed trustworthy and earnest.

She is just outside the cavern. Meet with her and determine her purpose for coming here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16450 [[XP]]
*[[Flying Hourglass]]

==Progress==
What have you learned?

==Completion==
She looked good. The [[Arcan'dor]] truly is a miracle for our people.

She is a welcome ally in the fight to come. [[Silgryn]] will take good care of her.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|She is waiting for you just outside.}}

Outside Shal'Aran, Arluelle is kneeling before [[Arluin|her brother]]'s memorial flower.

:{{Text|emote|Arluelle places a dusky purple flower before the little planter.}}
:{{Text|say|Arluelle|Do you remember me, outlander?}}
:{{Text|say|Arluelle|My brother rests here. My name is Arluelle.}}

Talk to her:

: So much has changed for me since you brought that fruit.

: I miss my brother dearly but I know why he gave himself to this cause.

: There is something I must ask of you. I need to repay the others for their kindness. I need to avenge my brother's death.

: Please take me to the First Arcanist so I can pledge myself to her cause.

''{{Gossip|Right this way, Arluelle.}}''

Lead Arluelle to Shal'Aran. She should start talking to Thalyssra on her own. If she doesn't, lead her out of the chamber and back in.

: ''Arluelle salutes as she speaks.''
:{{Text|say|Arluelle|It is an honor to finally meet you, First Arcanist.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|You must be Arluin's sister. We owe him a great debt. His sacrifice was not in vain.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|What brings you to Shal'Aran in this dark hour?}}
:{{Text|say|Arluelle|The fruit from [[Arcan'dor|this tree]] plucked me from the jaws of madness. I am whole now, and I wish to fight.}}
:{{Text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|So be it. I will send you to [[Silgryn]]. With his training you will serve us well.}}
: ''Arluelle salutes, then runs off to the teleportation area where she despawns.''
