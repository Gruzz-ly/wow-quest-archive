==Objectives==
Inspect 4 [[Duskwatch Scrying Orb]]s in the [[Terrace of Enlightenment]].
* Duskwatch Scrying Orbs inspected (4)

==Description==
Until recently, [[Ly'leth]] was sending magical messages to us regularly from within the [[Nighthold]]. She took care to hide these messages - only the most vigilant scryers could have detected them.

They could not be within the palace... too much interference from the [[Nightwell]]...

Of course! The [[Terrace of Enlightenment]]! The [[Duskwatch]] must have set up a listening post there.

Check the scrying orbs for traces of Ly'leth's messages. We must learn what she was trying to tell us!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Overloaded Scrying Orb]]

==Progress==
The scrying orbs are easy to use - simply touch them to release the stored message.

==Completion==
So they did intercept her messages! I hope Ly'leth is okay...

We must investigate this breach she spoke of immediately!

==Notes==
First scrying orb:
: {{Text|say|Ly'leth Lunastre|[[Thalyssra]], I hope this message finds you well. I have just come from an emergency council regarding the [[Horde]] and [[Alliance]] forces amassing outside [[Suramar]].}}

Second scrying orb:
: {{Text|say|Ly'leth Lunastre|[[Elisande]] has appointed a new First Arcanist: a dreadful woman named [[Andaris Narassin|Andaris]]. Together they are working on a massive enchantment to break the siege.}}

Third scrying orb:
: {{Text|say|Ly'leth Lunastre|An attack on the main gate is ill-advised, but there may be another way. Andaris has dispatched her arcanists to the [[Sanctum of Order]].}}

Fourth scrying orb:
: {{Text|say|Ly'leth Lunastre|It seems there is some kind of breach that runs beneath the Nightwell and into the palace itself! They are trying to seal it, but I am sure you can find a way to-}}
: {{Text|say|Ly'leth Lunastre|Someone's coming... Who are you?! W-wait! Unhand me! How dare you! Do you know who I am?!}}

==Progression==
{{Elisande's Retort}}
