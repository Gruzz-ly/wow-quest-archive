==Objectives==
Use the [[Teleportation Crystal]] in the [[Leyweavers' Hall]], then speak with [[Leyweaver Azayna]].
* Learn about the [[Queen's Grace Loom]]

==Description==
Great power comes only with sacrifice. Even the most masterful tailor can only do so much with silkweave. To improve your patterns any further, bargains must be made.

You are prepared, <name>, to learn about working with [[:Imbued Silkweave]].

Use the teleportation crystal behind me, and speak with Azayna, the leader of our order.

==Rewards==
You following will be cast on you:
*{{Abilities|Introduction to Imbued Silkweave|id=186028|icon=trade_tailoring}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Return once you've spoken with Azayna.

==Completion==
Don't look at us that way, <name>. Selling our services to the [[demon]]s may have been morally dubious, but our skills have grown exponentially since Azayna made the deal.

Continue your training with us, or don't. If you want to leave now, nobody's stopping you. If you want to learn more... we are the only game in town.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Leyweaver Azayna
:The others were speaking of <race> <class> that knew how to sew. I assume that you are that <class>.

:If Tytallo thinks you're ready, then I can show you the Queen's Grace Loom.

:{{Gossip|Tell me about the loom.}}

::The loom itself, frankly, isn't anything special.

::It's a thing of beauty, to be sure. It's quite old, but at its core it's nothing but [[alderwood]] and a few nails. We do our best to maintain it.

::But no, the loom itself is immaterial to our methods.

::{{Gossip|Tytallo mentioned something about sacrifice.}}

:::How attentive of you. Yes, our order has made a bargain with a higher power, in order to gain more skill in our trade.

:::I am prepared to show you our secret. Behold, the power of the [[Leyweaver]]s!

:::{{Gossip|Show me your secret.}}

:{{Text|say|Leyweaver Azayna|We've come to an arrangement with {{Au|Gul'dan}}. We provide him and his forces with supplies, and in return, he's granted us a few of his more capable [[inquisitor]]s.}}
:{{Text|say|Leyweaver Azayna|Of course, I'd prefer that the leyweavers operate without anyone's assistance, but the quality of this [[demon]]ically-imbued cloth far surpasses anything we could do on our own.}}
:{{Text|say|Leyweaver Azayna|We're tailors, <name>, and so are you. No price is too high if it means a better robe. Am I right?}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Leyweaver Tytallo|I have shown you how to make Imbued Silkweave, and I've also given you the pattern for Imbued Silkweave Bracers.}}
:{{Text|say|Leyweaver Tytallo|Inondra and I can help, but we cannot teach you all the patterns you need. You will need to earn or purchase them from others.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Leyweaver Inondra]]|There are many other leyweavers out wandering the world. I can show you where they are.}}
