==Objectives==
Locate [[Jarl Throndyr]] in [[Azuregale Bay]].

==Description==
You seem to follow my commands well, <name>. Perhaps I can use you again.

Jarl Throndyr, the leader of [[Jandvik]], has been missing for some time now. I assume that he has fallen in battle to the invading [[Sashj'tar]] [[naga]], but I must know for certain.

Find out what has become of him.

Do this task for me and I can assure you that my [[vrykul]] will not harm you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
*8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Throndyr mutters through shallow breaths.>

Poison... runs through... my body.
