==Objectives==
Bribe [[Arluin]] with 800 [[Ancient Mana]].
*Arluin's Price Met

==Description==
Unless you have something worth risking my life for, I will not budge.

[[Vanthir]] must have told you that my services do not come cheap.

Let's say... enough mana to sustain me for a month.

<Arluin looks smug, as if you could never agree to this request.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|20|60|}}
*16,870 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
My price will not change.  Do we have a deal?

==Completion==
Glad to know you understand the value of my services, partner.

==Notes==
* <Arluin nods to you.>
* Open for business.
* I am always open to a productive working relationship.
* My eyes and ears are open.  I can speak on what I know... for a price.
