==Objectives==
Remove insulting items from the elven war camps.
* Insults removed (5)

==Description==
My army is disciplined, and they will follow my order not to engage the [[Sin'dorei]] in combat unless I give the command.

However, it is with some level of shame that I must admit both armies have been attempting to harass the other with pranks, littering our respective camps with insults.

Please, <name>, we need someone both armies respects to collect these items before fighting breaks out.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|19|40|}}

==Progress==
We elves are long lived, but not as long lived as our prejudices it would seem.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Hopefully, since our forces saw you performing this task they will come to their senses and stop this harassment.

==Gains==
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Darnassus (faction)|Darnassus]]
* +250 reputation with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Notes==
The five offending items are split between both elven camps.

At the [[night elf]] camp:
* "Your Ancestors" (a troll figurine complete with axe, appears to be made of [[azsharite]])
* "Just wanted you to feel at home, mon." (a tiki mask)

At the [[blood elf]] camp:
* Replacement Sunwell (a tiny model Sunwell)
* "We found your mounts..." (a chicken coop of small [[bush chicken]]s)
* "Didn't want you to get the shakes." (a bottle of blue liquid)
