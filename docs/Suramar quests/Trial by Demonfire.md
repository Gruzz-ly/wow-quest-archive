==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Rozzeleth.jpg|Rozzeleth|He seeks to crush the rebellion.}}
Slay Rozzeleth in [[Meredil]].
* [[Rozzeleth]] slain

==Description==
We are out of time. I have reports that a [[pitlord]] has come to Meredil.

I have dispatched a strike force. We cannot let this demon flank our army here, nor can we let him find [[Shal'Aran]]. It is time to temper these recruits in a real battle.

Join our forces in Meredil, engage the demon, and help us ensure this new army of ours is not lost in its first conflict.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
*[[Infused Pit Lord Tusk]]

==Progress==
No training will ever compare to the teacher that is a real battle.

==Completion==
Well done. Sometimes a single victory is enough to bring an army together. With time, these recruits shall train others, and we can grow our army to many times this size.

==Notes==
Finishing this quest will complete the Crafting War section of [[Insurrection]].
