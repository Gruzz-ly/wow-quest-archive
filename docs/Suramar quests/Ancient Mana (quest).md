==Objectives==
Gather from 3 [[:Ancient Mana]] nodes.
*Ancient Mana node (3)
*[[Mana Divining Stone]] (provided)

==Description==
Without the [[Nightwell]] to feed upon, my comrades and I will have to live off the land itself.

Ancient mana from the underground leylines can reach the surface in many forms, most commonly as crystals or gems.

<Thalyssra picks up a small stone and, whispering words of power, traces a rune upon it with her fingertip.>

This stone will glow when ancient mana is nearby. Please gather as much as possible! It will be a precious resource in the weeks to come.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16450 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Progress==
We need all the ancient mana we can get.  Make sure you know how to find it!

==Completion==
Keep a lookout for those crystal formations all over [[Suramar]]. We will need them.

==Progression==
{{Nightfall}}
