==Objectives==
Seal off the Arcway Outlets in [[Lunastre Lane]], [[The Parade Grounds]], and the [[Midnight Court]]. 
* Lunastre Lane outlet sealed
* Parade Grounds outlet sealed
* Midnight Court outlet sealed

==Description==
If all goes as planned, the manastorm will cause the [[leyline]] to flare up, sending a great surge of energy through the [[arcway]].

In order for the surge to reach [[Shal'Aran]], we must seal off any outlets along the way.  If we miss even one, the mission fails - and hundreds of people will be vaporized by the energy blow off.

[[Thalyssra]] had better be sure about [[Arcan'dor|this tree]].

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|Enchanted Nightborne Coin
}}

==Completion==
If [[Suramar Leyline Map|my map]] of the arcways is accurate, that should be all of the outlets we need to worry about.

==Gains==
* +100 reputation with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]
