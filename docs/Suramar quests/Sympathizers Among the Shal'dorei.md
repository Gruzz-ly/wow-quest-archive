==Objectives==
Speak with [[Silgryn]] in the [[Suramar Outskirts]].
* Silgryn met

==Description==
[[Elisande]]'s decision to welcome the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] into [[Suramar]] earned her plenty of enemies, though only some of us were bold enough to openly defy her.

We have allies in the city - we just don't know how many.

I need you to make contact with a spell-fencer by the name of [[Silgryn]]. He is loyal to our cause, and has been lying in wait since our failed coup.

He patrols the western edge of the city. Address him by name and tell him our cause is not lost!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
We should be safe to speak here for a moment.

==Notes==
Skirt the southwestern edge of [[Suramar City]]. Avoid the guards!

Silgryn is patrolling [[the Grand Promenade]]. Talk to him.

: You have a lot of nerve approaching me, outlander.
{{Gossip|''Are you Silgryn?''}}
: Either my legend has spread beyond the city, or we have a mutual acquaintance...
{{Gossip|''[[Thalyssra]] sent me.''}}

:{{Text|say|Silgryn|Thalyssra lives? Come, let us talk in private.}}

Silgryn leads you to a secluded spot, where you can turn in the quest to him.

==Progression==
{{Masquerade}}
