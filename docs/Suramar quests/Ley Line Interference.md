==Objectives==
* Southeast Siphon destroyed
* Southwest Siphon destroyed
* Northeast Siphon destroyed
* Northwest Siphon destroyed
* Central Siphon destroyed
* [[Leysight Spectacles]] (provided)

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Arcanist Valtrois]]|[[Ley line]]s darken across [[Suramar]] as the [[Elisande|Grand Magistrix]]'s [[Duskwatch|forces]] act from the shadows. Use my spectacles to see beyond sight, and root out the source of this interference!}}

== Gains ==
* +350 reputation with [[Nightfallen (faction)|The Nightfallen]]

==Completion==
: {{text|say|Arcanist Valtrois|The ley energy is flowing again! A job well done.}}

== Notes ==
Follow the quest marker to [[Teloth'aran]], on the west side of the [[Crimson Thicket]]. Buffing yourself with the spectacles will let you see [[Duskwatch Infiltrator]]s clearly, although getting in aggro range will do the trick. Go left or right and follow the tunnel while destroying the Ley Line Siphons.
