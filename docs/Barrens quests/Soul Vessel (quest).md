==Objectives==
Now that we have a way to weaken the [[demon]] we need a vessel to bind them within. The [[Burning Blade]] have overrun ancient [[Night elf|elven]] ruins in southern {{C|Desolace}}, using it as a staging ground to summon demons to [[Azeroth]].

Once you have found a Soul Vessel meet us in Desolace, there we will complete the ritual.
*[[Soul Vessel]]

==Description==
[[Goblin]] [[Engineer]]s have tried to create a synthetic Soul Stone, but their methods were crude to say the least. Regardless of their shortcoming, they are on the right track.

I've heard the Goblins swindled a faction of [[merchant]]s into buying the rights to the recipe. It's unlikely they know the Soul Vessel by itself holds no magical properties. Surely someone will be interested in parting with the pattern, given enough coin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||50}}

==Progress==
With the [[:Bough of Shadows]] and Soul Vessel we will be ready to begin the ritual.

==Completion==
Ah, yes... yes. That's exactly what we need.

==Progression==
