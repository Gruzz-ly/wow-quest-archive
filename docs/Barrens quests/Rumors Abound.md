==Objectives==
Not much is known about the location of these shattered weapon fragments, save that they are both in the possession of once great [[mage]]s held up in towers of importance. One is said to be located here to the north on [[Kalimdor]], while the other is nestled near the heart of the [[Eastern Kingdoms]].

See if the rumors are true... Search for the two missing halves of this weapon and bring them to me.
*[[Orb of Des]]
*[[Bough of Altek]]

==Description==
Whispers within the shadows speak of a weapon containing the soul of a great [[demon]]ic being. Lesser demons like Soran'ruk are one thing, but much more powerful entities, bound as punishment for their failures, offer unimaginable power.

This weapon was lost ages ago, shattered during the [[Third War]].

Recently these rumors have said that mages meddling with dark [[magic]] beyond their comprehension have claimed fragments of the weapon, but they are unable to unlock the powers without reforming it.

==Progress==
Still no signs of the weapon fragments? I guess I've sent you on a fool's errand.

==Completion==
There's still much that needs to be done before I can reform a weapon of this power. We've started down this path and there's no turning back now.
