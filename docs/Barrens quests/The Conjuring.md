==Objectives==
Collect 10 Blood of the Legion and perform the ritual to summon [[Des'Altek]] to trap its soul once again.
*[[Blood of the Legion]] (10)

==Description==
The demon, Des'Altek, seems to have broken free of it's{{sic}} prison, but its still bound to it like a prisoner to their cell. We must summon forth the demon to capture its soul again.

To the north, in [[Ashenvale]], where great [[demon]]s fell, there is a location on the ridge that was once used by the [[Legion]] for sacrifices. The ground is permanently scarred from the atrocities that occurred here, but if we can gather the Blood of the Legion from the demons that still infest this land... that's the key.

==Progress==
Make an offering of blood.

==Completion==
Use the Dark Ritual Stone to begin the Dark Ritual. There's no turning back now...

==Notes==
After turning in the quest, a ritual can be started at the Dark Ritual Stone. This ritual must be completed for the next quest to appear.

==Progression==
