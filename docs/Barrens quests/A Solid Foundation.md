==Objectives==
The [[Green dragon|Emerald Dragons]] protect several portals to the [[Emerald Dream]] throughout [[Azeroth]]. One of these locations surely has what we need.

Once you've found a Bough of Shadows return with haste.
*[[Bough of Shadows]]
*[[Invisibility Potion (Season of Discovery)]] (Provided)

==Description==
Reforming the weapon has proven challenging, and it's still unclear how the ritual failed, but I believe we have devised an alternative solution.

To start we need a sturdy base; a Bough of Shadows.

These trees are malignant growths of the [[Emerald Nightmare]] seeping into our world. It's said they weaken the wills of those around them. This magical property will be the foundation we use to build this weapon.

To aid your search, take this potion. It will hide you from the Emerald Dragons' minions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||50}}

==Progress==
Nobody said this was going to be an easy endeavor, but then again most things worth doing aren't.

==Completion==
Ah yes, you've found it! Your sanity still seems intact as well, so far so good.

==Notes==
Upon reaching level 30, [[Doan Karhan]] will send a letter directing you back to the Barrens to obtain this quest.

==Progression==
{{Rumors Abound}}
