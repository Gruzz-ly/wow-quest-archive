==Completion==
[[Raszel Ander|Raszel]] was a friend... One I thought I had lost long ago, from a different time... We were young apprentices back then... Much has changed.

The result of the ritual might have been a setback, but I believe we can still reform the weapon.

Raszel and I have much to discuss, together we will come up with a plan. I'll send word once we know how to move forward.

In the meantime, take this. It seems like something you might be interested in.

*[[Rune of Metamorphosis]]
