==Objectives==
Slay Hirzek at [[Blackthorn Ridge]], {{C|Barrens}}, and bring his staff to [[Je'neu Sancrea|Jen'neu Sancrea]]{{sic}} at [[Zoram'gar Outpost]], [[Ashenvale]].
*[[Hirzek's Staff]]
*[[Hirzek]] slain

==Description==
That [[quilboar]] you saw in your vision; I believe it was Hirzek.

The [[Earthen Ring]] has known of the Quilboar's crude version of [[shamanism]] for some time. However, there are rumors that a few have recently been making troubling strides. Hizrek is one such Quilboar.

From what you saw, it seems he is enslaving [[elemental]]s, rather than cooperating with them as you and I would. No doubt this is causing distress among the elemental plane.

You must stop him, <name>. For the good of [[Shaman]]s and elementals alike.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||18}}
* 2000 [[XP]]
*[[Rune of Earth Shield]]

==Progress==
Hirzek's actions are an insult to the shamanistic ways, and the very elements themselves. He must be stopped.

==Completion==
<Je'neu takes the staff into his hands.>

You've done a great deed, <name>. I am relieved to know Hirzek's tortures have come to an end. Though, I fear he may be merely a symptom of a greater disease. So many elementals of [[Azeroth]] still call out in anguish.

Many questions remain to be answered; perhaps more than when we started. Nonetheless, I thank you for your service to the Earthen Ring.

==Progression==
{{Elemental Distress}}
