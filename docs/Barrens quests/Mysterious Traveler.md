==Objectives==
Meet with [[Doan Karhan]] and the [[Raszel Ander|Mysterious Traveler]] in the {{C|Barrens}}.

==Description==
What? Where am I? How... how did I get here?

<The man before you stumbles around as if sea sick. His eyes widen and his hands tremble and you stare at each other in a moment of shared confusion.>

Ah... A fellow [[warlock]] I see. Perhaps we discuss what led to this series of events and maybe we can find out what went wrong?

<Unsure of what to do next, you suggest they return to speak with Doan Karhan.>

==Completion==
Interesting indeed... I set you out to slay a demon; never in my wildest imagination would I have thought you'd return with a friend.

==Notes==
In order to obtain this quest, you must first complete the ritual from the [[Dark Ritual Stone]].
