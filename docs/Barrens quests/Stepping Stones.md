==Objectives==
You tear the note from the plank and read the scrawled writing.

==Description==
The note begins, "Mission said they were both making deliveries for [[New Plague]]. Looks like simple [[apothecary]] accidents to me. Find my cozy spot in the mountains between The {{C|Barrens}} and {{C|Desolace}} if you want a safe place to talk."

*[[Mining Pick]]
*[[Farmer's Shovel]]

*{{cost||12}}

*[[Simple Wood]]

==Completion==
