==Objectives==
Bring the staff to [[Doan Karhan]] in The {{C|Barrens}}.

==Description==
The scythe is twisted and emanates a strange [[demon]]ic aura. Despite this, it is brittle to the touch, and you worry it would break on use. It pulls at your energy, as if testing you. A ravenous hunger lurks at the back of your mind just thinking about the scythe. Perhaps someone knowledgeable on demonic artifacts might know more.

==Completion==
This is certainly a curious artifact you've found, <name>. I believe that this staff might be saved...though it will require some effort.

Hmm, it might even be an excellent candidate for wrapping up some unfinished business we have.
