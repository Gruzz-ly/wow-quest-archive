==Objectives==
Take the Arms Shipment to [[Zel'mak]] in [[Orgrimmar]].
*[[Arms Shipment]] (provided)

==Description==
The first run's all packed up, <name>. Take this to Orgrimmar and get it in front of the higher-ups. Someone who can sign today!

==Progress==
A delivery from [[Ratchet]]? I didn't order anything from Ratchet.

==Completion==
An arms supplier in Ratchet? Hmm.. the [[Horde]] has been trying to steer [[Goblin]] business towards us and away from the [[Alliance]]. We should act fast to secure this new opportunity.
