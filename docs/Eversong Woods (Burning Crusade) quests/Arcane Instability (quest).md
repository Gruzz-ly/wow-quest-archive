==Objectives==
[[Ley-Keeper Velania]] wants you to kill 5 Manawraiths and 5 Mana Stalkers.
*[[Manawraith]] slain (5)
*[[Mana Stalker]] slain (5)

==Description==
It's about time that dimwit, [[Ley-Keeper Caidanis|Caidanis]], sent someone this way.

I warned of the dangers of increasing the load on the [[West Sanctum]]! Now one of our energy converters is destroyed and arcane wraiths are pouring out of the sanctum!

I'm going to need you to take care of these creatures before we send anyone in for repairs. Make haste!

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
*550 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Progress==
Did you take care of the arcane wraiths?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Now that we have the wraiths under control we can send someone in to assess the damage. Hopefully this wasn't anything permanent.

==Progression==
