==Objectives==
Deactivate the 3 [[Duskwither Spire Power Source]]s inside [[Duskwither Spire]]. Then return the Deactivating Jewel to [[Apprentice Loralthalis]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]].
*First Power Source Deactivated
*Second Power Source Deactivated
*Third Power Source Deactivated
*[[Deactivating Jewel]] (provided)

==Description==
As you may know, [[Magister Duskwither]] sent me back here to shut down the power sources that feed the Spire. There are three of them, each located in a different place inside.

Unfortunately, I appear to be too late, and Duskwither Spire has been overrun with strange, magical creatures. While I haven't the expertise to accomplish this task, surely a <class>, such as yourself, could do so easily?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*625 [[XP]] (or {{cost||3|90}} at max level)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
I can't be certain from this distance... have you already shut down the power to Duskwither Spire?

==Completion==
I am grateful to you for your assistance, but saddened to hear that some of my fellow apprentices have fallen to their addiction.

With the power to the Spire cut off, I think I'll stay here a while and see if things calm down long enough for me to sneak in and retrieve their remains.

==Notes==
Be sure to not die while inside the spire - you ''will not'' be able to enter it while dead, forcing a resurrect at the Spirit Healer (and, in retail, one minute of [[Resurrection Sickness]]).

==Progression==
