'''Captain Kelisendra's Lost Rutters''' starts when a player activates the item of the same name, which can [[drop]] from all [[murloc]]s at [[Golden Strand]] and [[Tranquil Shore]].

==Objectives==
Return Captain Kelisendra's Lost Rutters to [[Captain Kelisendra]] at the defended camp just to the east of the [[Sunsail Anchorage]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]].
*[[Captain Kelisendra's Lost Rutters]] (provided)

==Description==
Interesting... what you have found here is a water-proofed, leather tube containing a number of sheets of parchment. By the markings upon them, the pages are clearly navigation rutters, and each bears the signature of one Captain Kelisendra.

You've heard of a small, defended camp just east of the nearby Sunsail Anchorage. Maybe the captain is there?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||2|25}}
*700 [[XP]] (or {{cost||4|20}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Progress==
Hello, <class>, you're a sight for sore eyes. I know, it's crazy for me to be here, what with the anchorage overrun by the [[Wretched]]. [[Velendris Whitemorn|Velendris]] and his [[Elven ranger|rangers]] have sworn to protect me on the condition that I get out of here as soon as I've recovered my cargo.

What's that you have there... it looks vaguely familiar?

==Completion==
Oh you sweet, sweet <class>! I had no idea that those disgusting [[Grimscale Murloc|Grimscale murloc]]s had also pirated away with my navigation rudders! Without them, I would have no chance of navigating the seas again once we retake the anchorage and repair the ship.

Thank you very much! Here, take this coin as a sign of my appreciation.
