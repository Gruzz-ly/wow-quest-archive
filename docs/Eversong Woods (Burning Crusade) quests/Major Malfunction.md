==Objectives==
Collect 6 Arcane Core from the [[Arcane Patroller]]s that roam the ruins of [[Silvermoon City]] and bring them to [[Magister Jaronis]] at [[Falconwing Square]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]].
*[[Arcane Core]] (6)

==Description==
The arcane patrollers crafted by our forefathers to protect the city have fallen into a dangerous state of disrepair. They fail to recognize us as their masters and will attack us on sight!

Even though they were created many years ago, the arcane cores that power them are still quite useful and valuable to us. I want you to gather these cores and bring them to me so I can put them to good use again. You will find the patrollers in the ruined section of Silvermoon, to the northwest.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Green Plate Belt|Light Silk Robe|Soft Leather Vest|Padded Chainmail}}

You will receive:
*{{cost||1}}
*450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
Have you succeeded in gathering the arcane cores yet, <name>?

==Completion==
You've done well, <name>.  With our arcane sanctums not operating at full capacity, these power cores will go a long way in supplementing our needs.

==Progression==
