==Objectives==
[[Apprentice Mirveda]] at the [[East Sanctum]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]] wants you to collect 8 Tainted Soil Samples.
*[[Tainted Soil Sample]] (8)

==Description==
This was a fully functional arcane sanctum before [[Arthas Menethil|Arthas]] and his army of [[Scourge]] decided to plow through it on their way to [[Silvermoon City|Silvermoon]].

Now it's as useful to us as any part of the [[Dead Scar]]. The soil is tainted, undead are drawn to it and the energy in the [[ley line]]s is completely disrupted.

What I want to know, <name>, is whether this taint is reversible or not. I want you to collect soil samples from this area so I can study them. Perhaps with time we can set things back to normal. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3|}}
*775 [[XP]] (or {{cost||4|80}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
Are you done collecting the samples I asked for, <name>?

==Completion==
Excellent. I will cast an augmentation enchantment on the samples so I can more clearly analyze the taint on the soil.

==Notes==
;On completion
:''Mirveda places a symbol on the ground and begins channeling.''
