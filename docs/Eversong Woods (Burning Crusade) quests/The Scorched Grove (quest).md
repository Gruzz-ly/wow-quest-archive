==Objectives==
Find [[Larianna Riverwind]] near the [[Scorched Grove]] in the southwest of [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]]. 

==Description==
A foul taint in the soil precedes the expansion of the [[Scourge]] into a new area. The protective [[runestone]]s along the border with the [[Ghostlands]] have warded the land against this taint in the past.

The westernmost runestone was destroyed during a Scourge attack, which forced us to burn the ground around it to prevent the taint from spreading.

My sister, [[Larianna Riverwind]], watches over the Scorched Grove. Go find her; she might have some work for you. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||85}}
*210 [[XP]] (or {{cost||1|20}} at level 70)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Completion==
Ah, my brother sent you. I do have a task I could use assistance with.
