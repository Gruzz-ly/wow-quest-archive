==Objectives==
Collect 8 Grimscale Murloc Heads. Return them to [[Hathvelion Sungaze]] in the [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]] on the bluff overlooking the [[Tranquil Shore]].
*[[Grimscale Murloc Head]] (8)

==Description==
Greetings, <class>. Take a look toward the shore; what do you see? That's right, our beach... our Tranquil Shore, has been infested with the malignancy known as the [[murloc]].

This blight will not stand!

I have a task for you. If you feel that you're up to it, I would have their heads! Let us see if we can put a dent in their numbers so large that, if they have any sense at all, they will return to the murky depths from which they sprang!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*650 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
We rangers of the [[Farstrider Retreat]] are dedicated to setting right the damage that has been wreaked upon our fair lands.  We will go to any length to do so.

I trust that you have returned with the murloc heads I tasked you to gather?

==Completion==
A job well done, <class>.  By the smell of it, I'd say you returned all that I asked for, and possibly more.  I'm sure we can find some use for these, in a stew, or somesuch.

Alas, it does not appear that your efforts have done the trick; the murlocs are not in retreat.  This calls for more direct action!
