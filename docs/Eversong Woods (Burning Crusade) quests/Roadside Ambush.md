'''Roadside Ambush''' leads you to the Soaked Pages quest chain, but is not actually a requirement. If you start with [[Soaked Pages]] this quest will be unavailable afterwards.

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Apprentice Meledor]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]] along the road heading south from [[Silvermoon City]].

==Description==
You, there! You must help me, please!

A fellow apprentice and I were attacked by the [[Wretched]]! In their mad hunger for magic, they took everything they could get their hands on: mana crystals, wands, spellbooks... everything!

Meledor gave chase after them; I had to stay behind and look after what they didn't take. Continue down the road and see if you can lend him a hand.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*55 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Completion==
They're gone now. Scared the breeches out of them with a well-placed fireball! Unfortunately for me, they threw our precious cargo into the river.

==Progression==
{{:Soaked Pages/Chain}}
