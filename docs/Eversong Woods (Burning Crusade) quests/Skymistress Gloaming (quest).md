'''Skymistress Gloaming''' is part of the [[blood elf]]-only quest chain that introduces players to using the [[flight path]]s.

==Objectives==
Bring Sathiel's Goods to [[Skymistress Gloaming]] just outside [[Silvermoon City (Burning Crusade)|Silvermoon City]]'s [[Shepherd's Gate]].
*[[Sathiel's Goods]] (provided)

==Description==
It doesn't look as if you have a cart or a beast of burden with you, so I'd better send you back only with what you can carry. If you've spoken with [[Skymaster Brightdawn]] at [[Fairbreeze Village]], then you should get this to [[Sathiel]] as soon as possible by flying back.

Take these goods for final inspection to Skymistress Gloaming just outside Silvermoon City's Shepherd's Gate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*160 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Progress==
Wow, that box of goods you have there looks heavy! You want to load that up on one of my flying beauties?

==Completion==
Back down to Fairbreeze Village in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]], then?  Sure, I can get you there fast!

==Progression==
{{Goods from Silvermoon City}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Level decreased to 7. Updated for Cataclysm.}}
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
