==Objectives==
Purchase a flight back to [[Fairbreeze Village]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]] and deliver Sathiel's Goods to {{NPC||Sathiel}}.
* [[Sathiel's Goods]] (provided)

==Description==
It all checks out as far as I can tell.

So, the question is, have you already spoken to {{NPC||Skymaster Brightdawn}} in Fairbreeze Village? If so, then this can be as simple as you paying the small fare and quickly flying back.

Let me know when you're ready.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||3|50}}

==Progress==
<class>, back so soon? That doesn't look like everything I requested...

==Completion==
Well, I guess if he said that the rest of it will be coming quickly overland, then I'll take him at his word. He certainly never failed to provide the goods in the past.

Thank you, <name>. Here take this coin... it's done nothing but jingle around in my pocket all day.

==Progression==
{{Goods from Silvermoon City}}
