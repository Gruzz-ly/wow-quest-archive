*[[Sin'dorei Armaments]] (8)

==Description==
The [[Wretched]] grow bolder every day, <name>. They've achieved enough coordination to launch an attack on [[Sunsail Anchorage]].


As if that weren't embarrassing enough, most of our weapons were left behind when they attacked. Bring me back our armaments so that we may show those ruffians who's boss.

==Progress==
Did you gather the lost weapons yet?

==Completion==
Great job, <name>. Let's show the Wretched what we're made of!

==Reward==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|75}}
*625 [[XP]] (or {{cost||3|90}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]
