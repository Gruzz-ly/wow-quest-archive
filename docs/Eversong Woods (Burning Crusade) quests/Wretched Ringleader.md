==Objectives==
Bring Aldaron's Head to [[Velendris Whitemorn]] near [[Sunsail Anchorage]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]].
*[[Aldaron's Head]]

==Description==
The [[Wretched]] are so oblivious, gorging on foul magic, that they haven't realized we've recovered most of our weapons. We can't expect them to remain in their stupor, though. Now is the time for a decisive attack. Let us make an example of their leader, [[Aldaron the Reckless|Aldaron]]. He was spotted on the top floor of the building by the anchorage. Bring me his head; I'll reward you suitably.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Sunsail Bracers|Longshoreman's Bindings|Silk Wristbands|Longshoreman's Bracers}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||2|25}}
*700 [[XP]] (or {{cost||4|20}} at level 70)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Progress==
Well, do you have his head or not? I've no time to waste, <name>.

==Completion==
You defeated him after all! Undoubtedly my men softened him up for you.

I jest, <class>. You've done well. You'll make a name for yourself if you keep your nose clean.
