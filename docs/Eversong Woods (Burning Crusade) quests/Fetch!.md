==Objectives==
Dive to the bottom of [[Stillwhisper Pond]] and retrieve the Azure Phial for [[Instructor Antheol]].
*[[Azure Phial]]

==Description==
So... <name> is it? Don't be flattered I know your name, one of my students has been fawning over you and won't shut up.

... if you'd like to impress <her/him>, why don't you do something for me? There's an azure phial at the bottom of the pond behind me. Dive in, retrieve it, and bring it here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*210 [[XP]] (or {{cost||1|20}} at max level)

==Progress==
How's the water? 

==Completion==
Oh, well done... I told you to jump in a pond, and you did. I can only imagine what you'd do if one of your good friends asked it of you.

If you want a reward for your efforts, it is this: never lift a finger without first knowing what's in it for you. The mage's mind is <his/her> greatest weapon. Remember that and try to use yours a bit more.
