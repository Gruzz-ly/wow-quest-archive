==Objectives==
Deliver the Research Notes to [[Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider]] at [[Fairbreeze Village]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]].
*[[Research Notes]] (provided)

==Description==
As discouraging as my research results are, they still contain valuable data. I must have a [[Magisters|magister]] review my work before it is taken seriously. Please, take these notes to Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider at Fairbreeze Village, west of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||70}}
*390 [[XP]] (or {{cost||2|40}} at max level)
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
You've something for me?

==Completion==
These notes... are shocking. If they're correct it means the damage to the land on the [[Dead Scar]] is irreversible.

I'll notify the [[Rommath|grand magister]] right away. More reason for our race to escape this world and find our true fate in [[Outland]].
