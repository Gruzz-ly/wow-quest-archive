==Objectives==
Report to [[Ranger Sareyn]] outside [[Fairbreeze Village]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]].

==Description==
Don't take the safety of this village for granted. We're under siege by the [[Scourge]] on the east and the [[Wretched]] to the west.

Ranger Sareyn keeps our borders safe from the undead that pour in from the [[Dead Scar]]. Follow the road eastwards out of town and see if you can lend her a hand.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*80 [[XP]] (or {{cost|||60}} at max level)
*+10 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Completion==
You're here to help us? Why didn't you say so earlier? We can always use a hand!
