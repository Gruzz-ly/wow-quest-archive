==Objectives==
Retrieve 6 of Captain Kelisendra's Cargo and return them to [[Captain Kelisendra]] at the defended camp just to the east of the [[Sunsail Anchorage]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]]. 
*[[Captain Kelisendra's Cargo]] (6)

==Description==
Thank goodness for you, <class>! Those slimy [[Grimscale tribe|Grimscale murloc]]s have pirated away my cargo! It's bad enough that the Wretched have stolen what little magical goods I had, but the murlocs took the rest! What has this land come to?

Could you retrieve my cargo? I can't expect that you'd be able to get all of it back, but I'll be grateful for any of it at this point. It was the Grimscale murlocs in the huts, just to the west and south of the anchorage on the [[Golden Strand]], I'm sure of it! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||2|25}}
*700 [[XP]] (or {{cost||4|20}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
I am grateful for the assistance of someone like you, <name>. It almost puts a smile on my face. But then I realize what these monsters have done to my ship and what's happening to [[Quel'Thalas]].

Have you managed to retrieve any of my cargo? 

==Completion==
You did it! You've saved me from ruin and delivered my revenge upon those disgusting creatures!

Now if I can just get these pretty [[Elven ranger|rangers]] here to help me with this cargo, I'll finally get out of here! I'll have to come back when [[Velendris Whitemorn|Velendris]] has retaken the [[shipyard]].

Here, take this coin. It's what little I can afford, and the least that I can do to reward your efforts.
