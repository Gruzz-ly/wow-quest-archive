==Objectives==
Speak to [[Runewarden Deryan]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]], near the border with the [[Ghostlands]].

==Description==
This increase in [[Scourge]] attacks leads me to believe there might be a malfunction at one of the protective [[runestone]]s at the border with the Ghostlands.

We used these ancient stones to protect us against the undead. Most of them were destroyed or lost after the attack on the [[Sunwell]].

Follow the road south, towards the Ghostlands, and look to the west for a small path. You will find Runewarden Deryan by the runestone nearby; he will know whether anything's wrong.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||85}}
*210 [[XP]] (or {{cost||1|20}} at max level)
*+25 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Completion==
You must've been sent by someone at [[Fairbreeze Village]]. I knew it would just be a matter of time until help arrived.

==Progression==
{{:Quest:Ranger Sareyn/Quest chain}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
