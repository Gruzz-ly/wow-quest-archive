==Objectives==
Speak to [[Ley-Keeper Velania]] at the [[West Sanctum]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]].

==Description==
Since you're here, <name>, I've a favor to ask you. Ley-Keeper Velania's apprentice dropped by earlier to ask for assistance. Apparently there's some malfunction happening at the West Sanctum. I've been a bit busy entertaining our... most pleasant... [[dwarven]] guest. See if you can give her a hand. You'll find the West Sanctum southwest of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1}}
*450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Completion==
Look around you. Things aren't exactly in order.

We have a severe malfunction at the West Sanctum. Let us do our best to prevent matters from getting worse.

==Progression==
{{Major Malfunction}}
