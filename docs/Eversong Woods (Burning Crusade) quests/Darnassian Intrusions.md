==Objectives==
Travel to the [[West Sanctum]], southwest of [[Falconwing Square]] and defeat any [[Sentinel spies|intruders]] present there. Report your findings to [[Ley-Keeper Velania]].
*[[Darnassian Scout]] slain (1)

==Description==
Besides the constant threat that the [[Wretched]] represent, I also have to deal with all kind of fictitious reports of [[night elf]] sightings.

Though most reports are unfounded, one recent incident demands further investigation. The West Sanctum, one of our primary energy sources, has suffered a terrible malfunction and rumors of Darnassian sabotage are rampant.

Travel there and deal with anyone that looks suspicious. Report back to Ley-Keeper Velania, who watches over the sanctum.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|25}}
*550 [[XP]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
Have you uncovered anything? Are the night elves behind this?

==Completion==
Night elves? Here? Those rats!

Do you suppose they had anything to do with the malfunction in my sanctum? If you have any information, you'd better take it to [[Aeldon Sunbrand|Captain Sunbrand]] at once!
