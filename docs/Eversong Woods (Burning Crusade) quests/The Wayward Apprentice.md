==Objectives==
Speak to [[Apprentice Mirveda]] at the [[East Sanctum]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]].

==Description==
Thank you for your help, <name>. While I get things back in order here, I'd like to ask you for a favor. One of my former apprentices embarked in a very dangerous line of research. She journeyed to the East Sanctum, in the middle of the [[Dead Scar]].

I worry for her well-being. See if you can find her and convince her to return to her senses.

==Completion==
It's so nice of my old mentor to check on me. It's too bad she lost faith in my research long ago.

Don't waste your time trying to get me to return to her; you can either help me with my research or leave.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||70}}
*390 [[XP]] (or {{cost||2|40}} at max level)
*+75 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Progression==
{{:East Sanctum quest chain}}

==Patch changes==
