You can only start the quest '''Aiding the Outrunners''' if you complete the [[Reclaiming Sunstrider Isle|Reclaiming Sunstrider Isle]] [[quest chain]] up to this point, but it is not a prerequisite for [[Slain by the Wretched]]. It is a [[blood elf]] only quest.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Outrunner Alarion]] near the bridge leading south of [[Sunstrider Isle]].

==Description==
[[Magistrix Erona]] wanted you to head over to [[Silvermoon City]] in order to aid our reclamation efforts there... that is, once you had successfully addressed the situation at [[Falthrien Academy]]. You did not disappoint us, <name>.

On your way to [[Falconwing Square]], south of here, you should speak with Outrunner Alarion. She's not far from the bridge.

The Outrunners take care of shuttling goods between here and the mainland, and since you've proven to be so resourceful, they could use your assistance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*45 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Completion==
Well hello there, <Class>! I heard that a resourceful young blood elf formerly in the service of Magistrix Erona might be making their way down here to help us Outrunners out. We certainly welcome the help, especially from someone who's proven to be so competent.

I hope you're interested in running an errand or two for us.
