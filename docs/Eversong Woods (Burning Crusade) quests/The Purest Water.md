==Objectives==
[[Instructor Antheol]] wants you to fill the Azure Phial at [[Elrendar Falls]]. 
*[[Filled Azure Phial]]
*[[Azure Phial (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that you've learned a little lesson, I'll offer you something more substantial. It concerns your ability to defend yourself in close combat. Of course, you should only resort to melee in the most dire of circumstances, but that is no excuse to be unprepared.

I can assist you in creating a staff befitting a mage of your learning. Simply take the phial you retrieved for me and fill it at the base of Elrendar Falls. Just follow the river southeast from here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*850 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|10}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Only water from the Elrendar Falls has the purity required for use with magic. Do you have it?

==Completion==
Let's see what you've brought me...

<He holds the phial up to the light and examines it closely.>

Yes, this will do. Well done, <name>.
