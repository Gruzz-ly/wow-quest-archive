==Objectives==
Search [[Tor'Watha]] to the southeast of the [[Farstrider Retreat]] for [[Spearcrafter Otembe]] and bring Otembe's Hammer to [[Arathel Sunforge]] at the Farstrider Retreat in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]].
*[[Otembe's Hammer]]

==Description==
The [[Amani Empire|Amani]] and the [[sin'dorei]] have a long history of mutual dislike and open hostility. That doesn't prevent me from appreciating a fellow craftsman's work, <name>.

I've come across pieces of Amani weaponry and I must admit I'm impressed by the quality of their work. It is rumored that Spearcrafter Otembe wields a magical hammer that is so light and well-balanced it allows him to work with great dexterity and efficiency.

If you bring me this tool I'll use it to craft you a weapon.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose from|Farstrider Sword|Smooth Metal Staff|Ranger's Pocketknife}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||3|50}}
*850 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|10}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Progress==
You've brought me Otembe's hammer, <name>?

==Completion==
There's truth to the rumors, <name>. This hammer is light and strong at once; I shall manage to complete several of my unfinished projects. And of course, I'll let you have first pick.

==Progression==
