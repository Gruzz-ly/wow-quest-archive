==Objectives==
Deliver Erona's Package to [[Innkeeper Delaniel]] inside the inn at [[Falconwing Square]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]].
* [[Erona's Package]] (provided)

==Description==
The death of another outrunner is a true tragedy, but it's a risk we all accept when we take the job. [[Magistrix Erona]] at the [[Sunspire]] needs to get this package to the inn at Falconwing Square, and she needs it there as soon as possible.

We're short handed and I don't have anyone else available that can cover for us.

I'm not going to lie to you; the path to Falconwing Square can be extremely dangerous if you leave the safety of [[Dawning Lane]]. Do you feel up to the task, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Refreshing Spring Water]] x5
*[[Shiny Red Apple]] x5

You will also receive:
*110 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
Welcome to my inn, <class>.  Am I to understand that you have something for me?

==Completion==
Thank you, I do appreciate the prompt delivery.

While you're here, please make yourself comfortable.  If you haven't done so already, feel free to get a [[hearthstone]] and bind yourself here.  Using a [[hearthstone]] will allow you to recall to an inn once every hour.  If you ever lose your hearthstone, simply return to any inn - an [[innkeeper]] will gladly get you a new one.
