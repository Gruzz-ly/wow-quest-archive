==Objectives==
Place the Infused Crystal at the [[Runestone Shan'dor|Eastern Runestone]] and protect it from the [[Scourge]] for 1 minute. Return the Infused Crystal to [[Runewarden Deryan]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]] for a reward.
*Runestone Energized
*[[Infused Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
Ancient [[runestone]]s once powered a protective barrier across the Eversong border. Many were destroyed during [[Arthas Menethil|Arthas]]' attack; others were stolen.

Of the three that remain, only this one has retained its powers. The runestone to the east might be salvageable, though.

Take this crystal and instill its energy on the Eastern Runestone. The process should take but a minute. Beware though, nearby Scourge will be drawn to it and will seek to destroy it. Do not let them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3|50}}
*850 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|10}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
Have you succeeded in powering the runestone yet, <name>?

==Completion==
Excellent. The defenses should hold off the Scourge a bit longer. Thank you for lending us a hand, <name>.

==Notes==
Once the infused crystal is placed next to the runestone, [[Enraged Wraith]]s will spawn nearby and will, by default, attack the infused crystal.
