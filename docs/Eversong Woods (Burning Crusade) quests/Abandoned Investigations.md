==Objectives==
Return Magister Duskwither's Journal to [[Magister Duskwither]] at the [[Farstrider Retreat]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]].
*[[Magister Duskwither's Journal]] (provided)

==Description==
You have discovered what appears to be an investigative journal left behind by Magister Duskwither. A brief scan of its contents reveal some shocking attempts at filtering corrupted magical flows, which might explain what has happened here at [[Duskwither Spire]]. The magister is sure to want this brought back to him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3|50}}
*850 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|10}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Progress==
What's this? It looks familiar. Oh no, this journal... my investigations... this is what caused all of this in the first place.

==Completion==
Here it is, <name>, the proof of my crime. This journal contains all of my ill-conceived studies.

Heedless of the warnings, I continued my research, until it was almost too late. Then, when I grasped my error, I did what I could. But by then, some of my pupils had already gone too far. I evacuated the Spire to get them away from the corruption, but in my haste, forgot to shutdown the power sources.

I will burn this tome so that no one else falls prey to its contents. I only wanted to help the [[sin'dorei]].
