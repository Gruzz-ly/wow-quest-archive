Lord Saltheril needs party supplies, and you have been charged to gather them.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lord Saltheril]] at [[Saltheril's Haven]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]]. 

==Description==
I swear that I'm going to fireball someone if I get one more request from Lord Saltheril concerning supplies for his party! Do I look like a party planner?! Between you and me, that fool and his sycophants are living in denial that we're under attack here!

Some of us are actually busy with, oh, I don't know, defending what's left of [[Quel'Thalas (kingdom)|Quel'Thalas]]! <class>, would you please head over to Saltheril's Haven and see if you can shut him up? It's just down the road to the west. 

==Rewards==
*80 [[XP]] (or {{cost|||60}} at level 70)
*10 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Completion==
Ah, good of [[Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider|Magistrix Dawnstrider]] to finally respond to my simple requests. I should take up the matter of her attitude with the [[Lor'themar Theron|regent lord]] in [[Silvermoon]]. She's quite rude!

Nothing for you to worry your little head over. Now that you're here, maybe I'll finally be able to get those party supplies that I've been waiting for?
