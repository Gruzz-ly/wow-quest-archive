==Objectives==
[[Lieutenant Dawnrunner]] at the [[Farstrider Retreat]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]] wants you to kill 5 Amani Berserkers and 5 Amani Axe Throwers.
*[[Amani Berserker]] slain (5)
*{{mob|Amani Axe Thrower|}} slain (5)

==Description==
Ours are not the vast kingdoms of the [[human]]s and [[orc]]s. All we have left of our lands in [[Azeroth]] lies mostly before your eyes, <name>.

Until we can reach [[Outland]], we must defend what little land we have at any cost.

Our uncivilized neighbors to the southeast, the [[Amani Empire|Amani]] [[troll]]s, certainly have a different opinion regarding the ownership of these lands. Their daily raids are something we can't tolerate anymore. Go to their settlements, [[Zeb'Watha]] and [[Tor'Watha]], and teach them a lesson.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||3|50}}
*850 [[XP]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
You'll find Tor'Watha and Zeb'Watha southeast of here. Come back when you've killed the trolls.

==Completion==
Good work, <name>.  With more people like you we'll soon restore our lands to their former glory.
