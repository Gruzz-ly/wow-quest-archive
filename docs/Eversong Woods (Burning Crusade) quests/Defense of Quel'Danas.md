==Objectives==
Meet with [[Lady Liadrin]] in [[Quel'Danas]].
* Talk to [[Skymaster Brightdawn]]

==Description==
With our best defenders defeated and the line broken, [[Arthas]] made quick work of [[Silvermoon]]'s remaining forces and tore through the city.

This is where we part ways. I must return to Silvermoon before [[Halduron]] starts sending rangers to search for me.

The [[dragonhawk]] master in [[Fairbreeze Village]] has orders to fly you to Quel'Danas. Someone much more familiar with the events on the island will meet you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hail, champion.

==Completion==
Are you ready, <name>?

==Notes==
Upon accepting the quest, [[Lor'themar Theron]] walks away and despawns.

Speak with [[Skymaster Brightdawn]] at [[Fairbreeze Village]]:
:{{Gossip|I need a direct flight to Quel'danas{{sic}}.}}

You are mounted on [[Ceremonial Dragonhawk]]. Upon arriving near the end of the [[Dead Scar]] where it meets the sea:

:{{Text|yell|[[Arthas]]|Witness the end: the removal of the final barrier.}}
:''Arthas freezes the sea in a straight path, toward the [[Isle of Quel'Danas]].''
