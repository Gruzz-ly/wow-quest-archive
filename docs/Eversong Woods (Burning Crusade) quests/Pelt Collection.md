==Objectives==
[[Velan Brightoak]] at [[Fairbreeze Village]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]] wants you to bring him 6 Springpaw Pelts.
*[[Springpaw Pelt]] (6)

==Description==
The [[Springpaw Stalker|springpaw]] that inhabit this region are known for their high quality pelts. We've even seen [[night elf]] scum travel to these lands just to poach them.
<br><br>
Our skirmishes with the [[Amani Empire|Amani]] have put a bit of a strain on our supply of gear and our [[Elven ranger|rangers]] don't have much time to hunt for pelts anymore. If you'd be willing to lend a hand by collecting springpaw pelts, I'd be happy to reward you with a hand-crafted piece of armor. You'll find springpaw stalkers all around the woods north of here.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|75}}
*625 [[XP]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Springpaw Hide Leggings
|Fur Lined Breastplate
|Springpaw Hide Cloak
|Springpaw Padded Greaves
}}

==Progress==
You're back. Did you bring the pelts? 

==Completion==
These will do perfectly, <name>. Take this piece of armor as a reward. I'll be able to make more with the pelts you brought me. 

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=[[Springpaw Padded Greaves]] added as a reward.}}
