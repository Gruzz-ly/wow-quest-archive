'''Whitebark's Memory''' is a quest to put [[Old Whitebark]]'s memory to rest by burying [[Old Whitebark's Pendant]] in [[The Scorched Grove]].

==Objectives==
[[Larianna Riverwind]] wants you to place Old Whitebark's Pendant by the runestone at [[the Scorched Grove]].
*[[Old Whitebark's Pendant]] (provided)

==Description==
This pendant brings back memories of a different time. A better time.

Unfortunately, memories are the last thing I need right now.

I want you to bury this by the runestone in the Scorched Grove. It was there that I first met the [[treant]] elder. Put my old friend's memory to rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*850 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
You've returned, <name>.  Haven't you done enough?

==Completion==
I no longer belong to this world and must admit defeat. The land has forever changed and nothing will ever be the same.

Leave the pendant here with me, <name>. Maybe one day, long after the [[Blood Elf|elves]] are gone, a new tree will grow on this very spot - amongst a burnt forest and the husks of dead treants.

==Notes==
Upon using [[Old Whitebark's Pendant]] at the runestone {{co|38|86|Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)}}, [[Whitebark's Spirit]] spawns and attacks. After taking his health down to about 20%, he becomes friendly and allows the player to finish the quest.

;Aggro
:{{Text|say|Whitebark's Spirit|Haven't you done enough harm?  Must you also disturb my slumber?}}

;Defeat
:{{Text|say|WWhitebark's Spirit|What good does this violence serve?  What is done is done.  I have failed my people.}}

If the player does not complete the quest within a few seconds, the spirit will despawn and must be summoned (and fought) again.
