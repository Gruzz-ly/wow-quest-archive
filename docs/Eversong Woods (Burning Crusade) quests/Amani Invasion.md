==Objectives==
Deliver the Amani Invasion Plans to [[Lieutenant Dawnrunner]] at [[Farstrider Retreat]].
*[[Amani Invasion Plans]] (provided)

==Description==
Though you don't understand the language in these battle plans, you clearly make out a map marking the positions of the Farstrider Retreat and [[Fairbreeze Village]].

You'd best let [[Lieutenant Dawnrunner]] at the Farstrider Retreat know about this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||4|}}
*875 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|40}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Progress==
What do you want to show me?

==Completion==
The trolls have been keeping us pinned here while planning an attack on [[Fairbreeze Village]]. We were not expecting this at all.

==Progression==
{{Amani Encroachment}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
