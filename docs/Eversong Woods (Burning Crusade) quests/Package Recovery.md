==Objectives==
Return to [[Outrunner Alarion]] with Erona's Package.
*[[Erona's Package]] (provided)

==Description==
You take the package and confirm that indeed it comes from [[Magistrix Erona]]. Alarion would probably want you to bring it to her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||50}}
*230 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
What did you find, <name>?

==Completion==
By the [[Sunwell]]! That's the third outrunner we've lost this month.

I appreciate your courage in venturing into [[Dawning Lane|Dawning Street]]. The guards need to keep a closer eye on these blasted [[Wretched]].
