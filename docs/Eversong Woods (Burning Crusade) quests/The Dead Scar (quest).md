==Objectives==
Slay 8 Plaguebone Pillagers and report back to [[Ranger Jaela]] on the [[Dead Scar]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]].
* [[Plaguebone Pillager]] slain (8)

==Description==
The black swath of soil that cuts through Eversong Woods is a permanent reminder of the day [[Arthas]] led the [[Scourge]] into our beloved city.

This blemish is more than an eyesore as even today it brings Scourge from the [[Ghostlands]] to [[Silvermoon]].

Go, <name>, and give my men a hand in killing the mindless undead that walk down the Dead Scar.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose from:|Black Leather Vest|Gatewatcher's Plate Gloves|Guard's Leggings|Sentry's Chain Shirt}}

You will receive:
* 550 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
You're back, <name>. Did you fight off the undead along the Dead Scar yet?

==Completion==
We don't anticipate the Scourge letting up on their attacks any time soon, but we still appreciate any help we get guarding the Scar.
