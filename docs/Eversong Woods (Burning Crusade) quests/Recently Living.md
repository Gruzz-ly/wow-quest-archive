==Objectives==
Slay the [[Eversong Green Keeper]]s until they yield a Living Branch for [[Instructor Antheol]]. 
*[[Living Branch]]

==Description==
You may have noticed the walking trees near [[Elrendar Falls]]. As the keepers of nature, they are infused with a primal magic we can reform to our own purposes using the pure water you have already brought to me.

Unfortunately, the green keepers are gnarled and twisted creatures, so you may need to kill a few before you find a useable branch.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Ley Orb|Ley Staff}}

You will also gain:
*850 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|10}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Do you have the living branch? Hand it over quickly!

==Completion==
You've done as I've asked, <name>, and you may take your reward now.

==Progression==
#[[Fetch!]]
#[[The Purest Water]]
#[[Recently Living]]
