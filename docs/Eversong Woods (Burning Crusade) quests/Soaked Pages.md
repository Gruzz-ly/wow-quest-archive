==Objectives==
[[Apprentice Meledor]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]] wants you to search the water beneath the bridge nearby and bring him Antheol's Elemental Grimoire.
*[[Antheol's Elemental Grimoire]]

==Description==
Those blasted [[Wretched]] sure can run fast at the sight of someone who'll stand up to them. But let's not worry about that now. I need to find my instructor's elemental grimoire.

I'm certain I saw one of those cowards throw it into the river but I cannot seem to be able to locate it. I could use another set of eyes. I'll throw in a bit of coin if you spot it.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||2|50}}
*270 [[XP]]
*75 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
No luck?  Well, keep looking.  The book is of utmost importance, <class>.

==Completion==
The book is completely soaked. [[Instructor Antheol]]'s not going to like this at all.

Here, take this money.  I have an idea.
