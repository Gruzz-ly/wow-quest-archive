==Description==
I... I'm too weak to continue. I carry a dire warning from [[Lor'themar Theron|Regent Lord Theron]], in the form of a letter. You'll have to deliver it for me.

Take it to Arcanist Vandril in Tranquillien. You'll find the town further to the south along this road. Go there and... find Vandril...

==Progress==
You have the letter? 

==Completion==
Finally! We've waited for a response from the regent lord for weeks! Let me see here...

<Vandril begins to read the letter.>

What's this? A dark presence? He senses a dark presence in the Ghostlands?! No kidding; I could have told him that!
