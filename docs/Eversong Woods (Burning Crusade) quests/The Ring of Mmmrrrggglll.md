==Objectives==

*[[Ring of Mmmrrrggglll]]

==Description==
The Grimscale murlocs have not been scared off by your efforts. But, I think I know what will send them packing, as well as get me some personal retribution.

They have a murloc chieftain that calls itself Mmmrrrggglll. It wanders the [[Golden Strand]] south of the river inlet. The beast once slew a compatriot of mine, and now wears his ring in open defiance and mockery.

Slay Mmmrrrggglll, and bring back my friend's ring. Then we shall see these monsters cowed!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Worn Ranger's Bow
|Farstrider's Buckler
|Satin Lined Gloves
|Slightly Used Ranger's Blade
|Ranger's Notched Dirk
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||6}}
*975 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
You are the instrument of my success and revenge, <class>. Have you the ring?

==Completion==
At last! Though the Grimscale did not route, as hoped, it was entertaining to watch them panic in confusion when you laid low their so-called chieftain. You have my thanks, and the gratitude of the [[sin'dorei]] of [[Silvermoon City]]!

Please, take one of these in thanks for the service that you have rendered.
