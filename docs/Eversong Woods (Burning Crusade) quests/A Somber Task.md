*{{mob|level=9 - 10|Withered Green Keeper}}  slain (10)

==Description==
These are difficult times for us, <name>. It was a very hard decision to burn the woods bordering the [[Ghostlands]] to prevent the [[Scourge|Scourge's]] expansion.

The [[treant]]s, who have been our friends for years, are now trying to foster the regrowth of the forest along the Scorched Grove.

This is a painful thing to ask of you, <class>, but we've failed to convince our former allies to cease their endeavors. I need you to stop them by the only means that remain to us: force.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3|}}
*775 [[XP]] (or {{cost||4|80}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
I dread to ask, <name>... is the task done?

==Completion==
So, it is done. Curse these times that have driven us to desperate measures... and curse our enemy, the Scourge!

Learn this, <name>. Our lands must be protected, no matter what the cost. We shall prevail! 

==Notes==
*In the process of slaying the withered greenskeepers, you may run into [[Old Whitebark]]. He [[drop]]s [[Old Whitebark's Pendant (starter)]] that starts [[Old Whitebark's Pendant (quest)]], which will lead you back to Larianna Riverwind.
