==Objectives==
Follow the road out of [[Fairbreeze Village]] towards the south and look for [[Courier Dawnstrider]] as you approach the [[Ghostlands]].

==Description==
My nephew was sent into the [[Ghostlands]] a few days ago. He never mentioned anything about his task, except that it was of an extremely secret nature.

He never returned and I fear for the worst, <class>. A missing messenger might not mean much to the callous magisters of [[Silvermoon]], but he's like a son to me. Please, <name>, will you look for him?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*420 [[XP]] (or {{cost||2|40}} at max level)
*+75 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Completion==
Help me, stranger. I must... reach [[Tranquillien]]... I cannot fail.

<The blood elf falls back into unconsciousness as his eyes go blank.>
