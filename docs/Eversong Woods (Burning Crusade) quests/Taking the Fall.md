==Objectives==
Bring Antheol's Elemental Grimoire to [[Instructor Antheol]] at [[Stillwhisper Pond]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]].
* [[Antheol's Elemental Grimoire]] (provided)

==Description==
Antheol is going to fly off his rocker when he finds out his book is ruined. I've got a little proposal for you; don't worry, I'll make it worth your while.

Take this book to him and tell him nothing of this incident. If he asks, just tell him you dropped the book into a puddle. He has no direct authority over you, so there's not much he can do.

Antheol delivers his lectures at Stillwhisper Pond, southeast of [[Silvermoon]]. You'll do this for us, right? I'll reward you handsomely for this favor!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|25}}
*140 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
What calls for this interruption to my lecture, <class>?

==Completion==
You say those two incompetent fools bribed you to lie to me?  You've done very well in coming to me, <name>.
