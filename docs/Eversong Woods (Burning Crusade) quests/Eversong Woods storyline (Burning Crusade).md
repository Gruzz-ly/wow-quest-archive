[[File:WorldMap-EversongWoods.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

'''[[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]]''' is the [[blood elf]] starting zone, designed for levels {{Level|Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)}} added in {{g|tbc}}. Much of the questing experience is dedicated to containing and repairing the damage done in the [[Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas]] during the [[Third War]], as well as dealing with the [[Wretched]], [[Alliance]] spies, and [[Amani tribe|Amani]] trolls.

Unlike many starting zones, which feature fairly directed questing experiences, there are many quest hubs scattered around Eversong Woods. [[Breadcrumb quest]]s help players navigate the zone in an optimal order.

==Falconwing Square and West Sanctum==
Players arrive to Falconwing Square from Sunstrider Isle across the [[Ruins of Silvermoon]].

[[Magister Jaronis]] starts:

{{Major Malfunction}}

[[Aeldon Sunbrand]] starts:

{{Unstable Mana Crystals}}

==Roadside Ambush==
On the way from Falconwing Square to Fairbreeze Village, players meet [[Apprentice Ralen]], standing by a cart along the road. He starts:

{{:Soaked Pages/Chain}}

Standalone quest: [[The Dead Scar (quest)]] is offered by [[Ranger Jaela]] in the northernmost portion of [[The Dead Scar]]. It's not part of the Roadside Ambush quest chain, but she's most likely to be encountered as players travel from the apprentices to [[Instructor Antheol]]. In ''Classic'', priests get [[Cleansing the Scar]] at the same general area.

==Fairbreeze Village==
[[Sathiel]] starts the chain introducing the player to [[flight path]] mechanics:

{{Goods from Silvermoon City}}

[[Ranger Degolien]] continues the Falconwing Square quest chain from the optional breadcrumb [[Fairbreeze Village (quest)]]:

{{Situation at Sunsail Anchorage}}

Standalone quest from [[Velan Brightoak]]:

* [[Pelt Collection]]

[[Marniel Amberlight]] starts:

{{:Ranger Sareyn/Quest chain}}

[[Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider]] starts:

# [[Saltheril's Haven (quest)]]
# [[The Party Never Ends]]

[[Ardeyn Riverwind]] starts:

# [[The Scorched Grove (quest)]]
# [[A Somber Task]]
#* Side chain from [[Old Whitebark's Pendant (starter)]] 
#*#[[Old Whitebark's Pendant (quest)]]
#*# [[Whitebark's Memory]]

===East Sanctum===
The optional breadcrumb to the East Sanctum is given by [[Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider]] at [[Fairbreeze Village]]. [[Apprentice Mirveda]] takes samples of the soil from the [[Dead Scar]] and comes to the morbid conclusion that its corruption is irreversible.

{{:East Sanctum quest chain}}

==Farstrider Retreat and Duskwither Spire==
The optional breadcrumb [[Farstrider Retreat (quest)]] leads to a quest hub in the northeast.

[[Magister Duskwither]] offers a breadcrumb to [[Duskwither Spire]], which ultimately leads right back to Farstrider Retreat:

{{The Magister's Apprentice}}

After returning, [[Lieutenant Dawnrunner]] directs operations against the trolls:

{{Amani Encroachment}}

Mages should stop by [[Instructor Antheol]] along the way to Farstrider Retreat, since he gives them a short quest chain upon reaching level 10. The later parts can be completed alongside the Amani troll quests:
#[[Fetch!]]
#[[The Purest Water]]
#[[Recently Living]]

In Classic, Hunters also get their class quest chain. Meanwhile for Paladins, their quest chain takes place entirely in Silvermoon City.

{{:Quest:Seek the Farstriders/Quest chain}}
{{:The First Trial quest chain}}

==The Ghostlands await!==
Time to get back to Fairbreeze Village, and from there, to the next zone, the [[Ghostlands]].

Pick up the lead-up quest chain from [[Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider]], which becomes available at level 10:

{{:Missing in the Ghostlands/Quest chain}}
