==Objectives==
Go south into the ruins of [[Silvermoon]] and look for the [[Slain Outrunner]] in [[Dawning Lane|Dawning Street]].

==Description==
It's hard work being an outrunner between [[Sunstrider Isle]] and [[Falconwing Square]]. Tight deadlines, long hours and worst of all... the [[Wretched]]!

The road south goes through the [[ruins of Silvermoon]]... the place is crawling with [[Wretched]] ready to kill you for a few mana crystals. Unfortunately, I think that's what happened to the last outrunner we sent with one of [[Erona's Package|Erona's packages]].

I see you're eager to prove yourself. Venture into Dawning Street and see if you can find any traces of our outrunner.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*110 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
If you're heading toward the city, then I have something important to do for you!

==Completion==
The outrunner's belongings have all been stolen with the exception of one package. It seems to match Alarion's description of Erona's package.

==Progression==
{{:Blood elf starting experience}}
