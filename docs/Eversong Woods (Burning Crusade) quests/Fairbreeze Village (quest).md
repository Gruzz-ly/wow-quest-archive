==Objectives==
Speak to [[Ranger Degolien]] at [[Fairbreeze Village]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]].

==Description==
I have another task for you, <name>. Ranger Degolien was sent to Fairbreeze Village to find out more about a [[Wretched]] attack on a nearby [[shipyard]]. He has requested reinforcements which we cannot yet provide. Seek him out and grant him whatever aid you can.

Fairbreeze Village can be reached by following the road out of [[Falconwing Square]] all the way towards the south. Good luck, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||85}}
*320 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Completion==
Thanks for coming, <name>. Things are worse than we had anticipated. The Wretched have taken over [[Sunsail Anchorage]] in its entirety.

==Notes==
If you have accepted [[Situation at Sunsail Anchorage]] before you finish [[The Dwarven Spy]], you will not be offered this quest.

==Progression==
{{Unstable Mana Crystals}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
