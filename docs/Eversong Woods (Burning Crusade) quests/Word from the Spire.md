==Objectives==
Return to [[Magister Duskwither]] at the [[Farstrider Retreat]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]].

==Description==
<Name>, I have one last favor to ask of you. Would you please relay what's transpired here to Magister Duskwither, back at the Farstrider Retreat? Let him know that I am well, but make certain that he is aware that some of the apprentices have become [[Wretched]].

Thank you for your help!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*850 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|10}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}
*[[Fallen Apprentice's Robe]]

==Completion==
No! I was too late. It is all my fault.

My investigation into purifying alternative magical sources got out of hand before I could put a stop to it. If only I had gone myself... or that they had listened to me, and heeded my warnings!

I have blood on my hands, <class>. I thank you, though, for putting to rest the tortured souls of my former apprentices. It is some small consolation that they will not linger in that state where a Blood Elf is better off dead.
