==Objectives==
Bring back 6 Unstable Mana Crystals to [[Aeldon Sunbrand]] at [[Falconwing Square]].
*[[Unstable Mana Crystal]] (6)

==Description==
[[File:Unstable Mana Crystal Crate.jpg|alt=|thumb|Stolen crystals are kept in crates.]]
A group of [[Wretched]] recently raided a supply of unstable mana crystals from one of our [[arcane sanctum]]s. If not handled properly, the crystals could explode with enough force to blow a hole into the city walls.

Now, <name>, I don't quite care if they blow themselves up while tapping unstable arcane sources, but the whole incident would make my men look bad.

Bring me back any remaining stolen crystals you find; they might still be inside their original crates.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1}}
*450 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Progress==
Did you retrieve the stolen goods yet?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>.

==Progression==
{{Unstable Mana Crystals}}
