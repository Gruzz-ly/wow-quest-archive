==Objectives==
Find [[Groundskeeper Wyllithen]] on the [[Duskwither Grounds]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]].

==Description==
The Duskwither groundskeeper has gone missing! Someone must have forgotten to tell him to leave when the magister and everyone else did. I know that he's still somewhere around here on the grounds, but I dare not go looking for him myself with all of these magical creatures roaming about.

Will you find him for me, <class>, and make sure that he's alright?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*85 [[XP]] (or {{cost|||60}} at max level)
*+10 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Completion==
Who are you? You're not one of the magister's apprentices, that's for certain!

Sent here to help me clean up this mess, no doubt!

==Progression==
{{The Magister's Apprentice}}
