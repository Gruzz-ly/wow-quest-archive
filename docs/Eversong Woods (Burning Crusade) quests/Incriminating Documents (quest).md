'''Incriminating Documents''' starts when the player activates the item of the same name which [[drop]]s from [[Darnassian Scout]]s around the [[West Sanctum]].

==Objectives==
Bring the Incriminating Documents to [[Aeldon Sunbrand]] at [[Falconwing Square]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]].
* [[Incriminating Documents]] (provided)

==Description==
The documents contain detailed maps of different strategic buildings in Eversong Woods. A diagram of an [[arcane sanctum]] is also sketched in good detail. There seem to be numerous notes in a language you don't recognize.

As these were carried by a [[Sentinel spies|Darnassian spy]], it might be a good idea to bring them to the Captain of the Guard - Aeldon Sunbrand.

==Rewards==
You will receive {{cost||2|50}}

==Progress==
You've got something for me?  Let me take a look.

==Completion==
Are you sure you found these on a [[night elf]]?  They're clearly written in [[Dwarven (language)|Dwarven]]...

From what I can understand of this letter, whoever wrote this did not cause the malfunction, but rather was sent here as a spy to observe the results of it.  They call our endeavors reckless and dangerous... but who?

Of course!  That envoy from [[Ironforge]]!  We were fools to trust anyone belonging to the [[Alliance]]!
