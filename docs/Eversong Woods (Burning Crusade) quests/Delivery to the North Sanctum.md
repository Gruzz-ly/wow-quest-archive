==Description==
I'm pleased to discover that you're at least somewhat competent, <Name>. I'll give you another task since you seem so eager to prove yourself.

This is a letter to Ley-Keeper Caidanis, the arcanist in charge of the upkeep of the North Sanctum. Go southwest of Falconwing Square and you will find him. He is a very important person, so I hope you don't bother him too much with trivial chatter.

You will receive:
*{{cost|||35}}
*140 [[XP]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Progress==
Yes, <class>?

Thank you, <name>.  I've been expecting this letter.
