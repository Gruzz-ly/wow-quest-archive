==Objectives==
Defeat Kormrok in {{Au|Hellfire Citadel}}.
* [[Kormrok]] slain

==Description==
In the Hellfire Citadel, they're corruptin' a [[magnaron]] with [[fel]] energy in the [[Pits of Mannoroth|Pits o' Mannoroth]].

If ye delve into the fel pools of that place, be on yer guard.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|61|60}}
*{{cost|ac=1000}}

==Progress==
It seems many beings are susceptible to fel energy. It is little wonder they are legion.

==Completion==
We can't handle too many more of those fel-corrupted beasts.
