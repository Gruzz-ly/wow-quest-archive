==Objectives==
Harvest a Timber Sample from Timber and return it to Justin Timberlord.
*[[Timber Sample]]

==Description==
Incredible news, Commander <name>. Your ever-loyal servant has managed to secure us [[commandojack]]s. Now maybe you don't know what a commandojack is, so let me explain: they're like lumberjacks, only highly trained in the art of killing. Mostly they're out of work [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] and [[assassin]]s.

What this means is that we can now cut medium sized timber - but first we need to give these commandojacks a test run.

There's a suitable tree nearby. Good luck!

==Rewards==
*{{Abilities|Journeyman Logging|id=167946|Allows you to harvest medium sized timber across Draenor.|icon=garrison_building_lumbermill}}

You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (50)

==Progress==
Did you harvest that timber sample yet?

==Completion==
We haven't even scratched the surface when it comes to overkill.

It looks like this group will serve you well, sir. Medium sized trees across Draenor are now at your mercy. That means more timber per tree!
