==Objectives==
Defeat Warlord Zaela in [[Upper Blackrock Spire]].
*[[Warlord Zaela]] slain

==Description==
{{Au|Grommash Hellscream|Hellscream}}'s [[Ironmarch]] vanguard managed to reach [[Blackrock Mountain]] and has allied with Warlord Zaela o' the [[Dragonmaw clan]].  Even now the [[Iron Horde]] readies to invade [[Azeroth]] while Zaela prepares a doomsday weapon in the heart o' the mountain to ensure nothing stands in their way.

You must put a stop to Zaela once and for all, commander.  She's been a thorn in our side for too long.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|61|60}}
*30,140 [[XP]]
*[[Garrison Resources]] (175)

==Progress==
Grommash thinks we cannot stop Warlord Zaela and her weapon.  We'll show him just who he's messing with.

==Completion==
With Warlord Zaela out of the picture we can focus our efforts on {{Au|Draenor}} and the heart of the Iron Horde.  They have nowhere to hide now.

==Patch changes==
