Repel the {{Au|Shadowmoon clan}} invasion of [[Lunarfall|your garrison]].

(Speak with Sergeant Crowler again to begin)
*Speak with [[Sergeant Crowler]]
*Repel the Invasion

==Description==
Your arrival couldn't be more timely, commander.

Shadowmoon raiders have been spotted closing in on the garrison.

You repelled their advances at [[Teluuna Observatory]], and created chaos at [[Shaz'gul]].

Now, they surely seek retribution. They will throw everything they have at us.

I have the entire garrison on high alert. Are you ready to face them?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*20,540 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Time to shine a light on these shadows!

==Completion==
I don't think they were ready for that. The Shadowmoon will think twice before attacking us again.
