*Speak with [[Sergeant Crowler]]
*Repel the Invasion

==Description==
The [[demon]]s are at our heels, Commander. Cow's milk is sour. A crone gave me an evil look this morning. The sky just doesn't seem... right.

==Progress==
We must hold the line!

==Completion==
They're defeated! I'm glad we came here, Commander. To {{Au|Draenor}}. Fighting against demons reminds me why we fight for the [[Alliance]].
