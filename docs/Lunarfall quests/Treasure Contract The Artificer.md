==Objectives==
Search near the entrance of the [[Pillars of Fate]] for evidence of [[Artificer Maatun]]'s crystal.
*Find the missing Artificer
*Read the [[Artificer Maatun's Journal|Artificer's Journal]]

==Description==
I have heard of a [[draenei]] [[artificer]] by the name of Maatun that was seeking to restore an old draenei crystal, possibly of naaru origin.  He called the crystal the Dream of Argus.

The draenei went missing after seeking out help from the [[Shadowmoon clan (alternate universe)|Shadowmoon orcs]] back before they allied themselves with the [[Iron Horde]].  One of your scouts recently spotted a draenei matching the description of Maatun near the entrance of the Pillars of Fate. G o there and see what you can dig up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|85}}
*3,770 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The journal recounts the story of Maatun's attempt to restore the Dream of Argus.

==Notes==
Take the flight point to [[Akeeta's Hovel]] at [[Spires of Arak]] and follow the quest arrow.  The body is accompanied by two [[Void Alpha]]s.

==Progression==
