== Notes ==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Baros Alexston|I feel so relieved. Maybe I can actually do some stargazing tonight. That would be a nice change of pace.}}

Find the Garrison Blueprint: Barracks on the ground of the under-construction building to the north of Baros on the floor. ''Use'' the blueprints to actually learn the Barracks plans. Return to Alexston and use the architect table right next to him.

Interact with the architect table and choose the only available large plot, at the north end of the walled-in area. Select it and exit the UI.

:{{text|say|Baros Alexston|The barracks should take the men no time to complete at all. Follow me, commander.}}
:{{text|say|Baros Alexston|Most of our other buildings are going to take quite a while longer to construct.}}
:{{text|say|Baros Alexston|Go ahead and sign off whenever you're ready, sir.}}
Interact with the floating "Finalize Garrison Plot" object in front of Alexston.
:{{text|say|Baros Alexston|The barracks looks fantastic. You should go check in with Maraad. I'm going to hang out here and admire my handy work.}}
After completing the quest, players gain the Call to Arms ability, which allows them to call upon the forces of the garrison to assault an area for 15 seconds.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Vindicator Maraad|With the barracks complete we can finally shelter all of these troops from this eternal night.}}
