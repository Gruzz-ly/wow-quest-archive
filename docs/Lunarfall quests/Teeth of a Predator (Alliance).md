==Objectives==
Ask [[Fanny Firebeard]] about the [[Garn-Tooth Necklace]].
*Talk to Fanny

==Description==
This necklace dropped off of one of the orc hunters we found while out taming beasts. I've never seen the animals react so strongly to anything!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|11|60}}

==Completion==
I've not seen the beasts go so wild in all of my years, as the day we brought this thing back to the stables.

Should ye find the training still not hard enough, take it along with ye. Your mounts-in-training will be even MORE vulnerable.

Be careful! I'd give a prize to anyone that could best every beast with such an artifact, but I don't want to see you wind up dead!
