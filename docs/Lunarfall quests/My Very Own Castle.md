* Upgrade your garrison to Tier 3

==Description==
Commander!  Some good news.  I finally got that new larger draft paper in that I ordered when we first came here.  And do you know what larger draft paper means?

It means I can draw a bigger castle!

And if I can draw it, we can certainly make it!  Making it is the easy part, assuming you have a few thousand stones and logs lying around.

So what do you say, sir?  Shall we get building?

==Progress==
I'm giddy with excitement!


On completion, a cutscene plays:

==Completion==
I... I think I like it.  A little more blue paint, maybe some taller towers, but you can really call it home, you know?

I already ordered some even larger draft paper, sir.  Don't you worry...
