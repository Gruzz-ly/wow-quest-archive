==Objectives==
Defeat Yalnu in the [[Everbloom]].
*[[Yalnu]] slain

==Description==
The [[Kirin Tor]] created an outpost in [[Gorgrond]] with a portal to [[Stormwind]] to facilitate quick reinforcements in the assault on the [[Blackrock Foundry]].  Unfortunately they built it in the heart o' the Everbloom, home to the [[botani]] and the mightiest o' the [[genesaur]] - Yalnu.

The outpost has already been overrun and it is only a matter o' time before the overgrowth spreads to Stormwind... and with it the whole of [[Azeroth]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|61|60}}
*30,140 [[XP]]
*[[Garrison Resources]] (175)

==Progress==
If we do not stop Yalnu and the botani now, all of Azeroth will soon be overrun by the primal forces of nature.

==Completion==
I wish we could have saved the mages' lives, but sadly it was not to be.  We should be thankful that we were able to stop the overgrowth before it reached our world.

==Patch changes==
