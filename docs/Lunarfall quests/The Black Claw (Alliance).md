==Objectives==
Ask [[Fanny Firebeard]] about the [[:Black Claw of Sethe]].
*Talk to Fanny

==Description==
Behind me, as ye can probably see, is a giant black claw. We found it while we were out hunting new beasts to tame. The animals seem to be quite afraid of it, perhaps the beast it belonged to used to hunt them.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|11|60}}

==Completion==
Like I said, the claw has a strange effect on the mounts we've got here. If ye have it with ye when training a mount-in-training, your mount will be MUCH more vulnerable.

Should ye find the training not rough enough, ye might want to challenge yourself.

I'd have a pretty hefty prize for anyone that could manage that!
