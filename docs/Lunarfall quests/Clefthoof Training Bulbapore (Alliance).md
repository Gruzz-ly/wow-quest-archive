==Objectives==
Defeat Bulbapore while riding your Clefthoof-In-Training.
*[[Bulbapore]] Killed
*[[Icehoof-In-Training Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
Way down south in the Spires of Arak, the land's being overtaken by the mushrooms that grow underwater. The result? Strange fungal creatures sprouting up all over the place.

Taking on a strange creature, like the fungal giant Bulbapore, gives us a great chance to expose your clefthoof to predators it's unfamiliar with.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (20)

==Completion==
I'll bet that was quite a fight! Great job, let's let it rest for tonight.
