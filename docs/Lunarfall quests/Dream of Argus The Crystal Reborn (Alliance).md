==Objectives==
Locate the crystal reconstruction device and use it to restore the [[Dream of Argus]]. 
* Find the reconstruction device
* Place the shards on the altar
* Dream of Argus

==Description==
With the shards recovered, it is now possible to restore the Dream of Argus. You must seek out the device that [[Artificer Maatun|Maatun]] mentions in his journal, which is said to be in a cave overlooking [[Anguish Fortress]].

==Progress==
Were you able to restore the [[draenei]] crystal?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|150||22}}
* 3,770 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This is incredible! I would never be able to tell that this crystal was once broken! 

I'm sure [[Harrison Jones|Dr. Jones]] will be pleased to see this, as well as the draenei if the stories behind it are true.
