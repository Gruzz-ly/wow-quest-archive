==Objectives==
Defeat Mannoroth in {{Au|Hellfire Citadel}}.
*[[Mannoroth (tactics)|Mannoroth]] slain

==Description==
We believed we were done with [[Mannoroth]], at least for a time. But {{Au|Gul'dan}} is more powerful than we thought.

Mannoroth is nearly back in {{Au|Draenor|this world}}. His bones have been seen within the citadel, and he must be destroyed before he can reach his full power.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|61|60}}
*[[Apexis Crystal]] (1000)
*30,140 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Sometimes I wonder why they continue to bring back [[demon]]s we have faced before instead of sending new ones against us.

==Completion==
Let's hope Mannoroth stays down longer this time.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.2.0|note=Added.}}
