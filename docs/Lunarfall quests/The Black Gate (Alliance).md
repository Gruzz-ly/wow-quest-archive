==Objectives==
Defeat Archimonde in {{Au|Hellfire Citadel}}.
* [[Archimonde (Hellfire Citadel tactics)|Archimonde]] slain

==Description==
We've heard rumors that one o' the strongest [[eredar]] might enter this world through the [[Black Gate]] soon.

If these rumors are to be believed, it could even be [[Archimonde]] the Defiler. If he arrives unchallenged, {{Au|Draenor}} itself is likely to fall.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|61|60}}
*{{cost|ac=1000}}

==Progress==
When a lord of the eredar appears in a world, it is often a portent of that world's doom.

==Completion==
You have saved Draenor from one of the strongest [[demon]]s in all creation, Commander. They will sing songs of your victory.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.2.0|note=Added.}}
