==Description==
The plants seem different today. Grass blades bend against the wind and catch on my boots. Twice this morning a tree branch struck my helmet as it fell.

==Progress==
We must hold the line!

==Completion==
We beat back nature, Commander. May I be excused? I'd like to get all this sap out of my armor.
