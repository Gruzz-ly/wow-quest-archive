==Objectives==
Use the Iron Trap to capture an [[Elekk]] or [[Talbuk]] in {{Au|Shadowmoon Valley}} and then place a Work Order at your Barn.
*Beast Trapped
*Place A Work Order
*[[Iron Trap]] (provided)

==Description==
When we came through the portal, we weren't able to bring any of our animals with us. For us to produce leather and furs, we'll need to trap some of the native beasts and bring them back here.

We can get a load of leather from the elekk, or furs from the talbuk, right here in Shadowmoon.

Take this iron trap and use it on a wounded adult talbuk or elekk, then bring the trap on back here and we'll start a work order.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (50)

==Progress==
Have you tried your hand at trapping yet?

==Completion==
Great job, commander! We'll have your leather or fur ready in no time.

Now that you know how to use the trap, it will be available for your use at any time. We can only handle so many beasts in the barn at one time, though, so make sure you've got room before you start trapping!
