==Objectives==

Collect Corrupted Lumber from a [[Twisted Ancient]].
*[[Corrupted Lumber]]
Suggested players [3]

==Description==
The ancients of the [[Cursed Woods]] have been corrupted by demonic magic. Since they need to be destroyed, we might as well make use of their resources. Waste not, want not.

Beware: these woodland behemoths are no easy targets. Gather trusted friends before you engage these Twisted Ancients.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*100x [[Garrison Resources]]
*{{cost|39}}
*39700 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you read the bounty I posted concerning the Twisted Ancients in the Cursed Woods?

==Completion==
Unfortunate that the ancient guardians of the woods fell to such corruption.

At least now, its long nightmare is ended. Not to mention its sacrifice is our gain.

==Notes==
At [[Lunarfall]] after reaching level 94, the Bulletin Board where [[Cordana Felsong]] is standing offers this quest.

Enter the [[Cursed Woods]] southwest of the garrison and look for a patrolling ancient. It's got a decent chunk of health and hits quite hard on cloth-users, so be prepared.
