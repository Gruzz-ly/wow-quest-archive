==Objectives==
Place a Work Order at your [[Lunarfall|Garrison]]'s [[Gnomish Gearworks|Workshop]].

==Description==
[[Adventurer|Commander]]! Great news! Now that the workshop is fully armed and operational, we can start cranking out [[siege weapon]]s just as soon as we have the resources.

The [[Overcharged Siege Engine]] is the pinnacle of [[gnomish engineering]], if I do say so myself. It's more powerful than your average [[siege engine]] and you can use it almost anywhere! The only limit is the amount of fuel we're able to pack into the chasis.

As soon as you're ready to begin production, just bring us some resources and place a work order!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|q1=100|Garrison Resources
}}

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Can't wait to get this thing up and running for you, commander!

Check back in tomorrow, and be sure to wear your blast goggles!
