==Objectives==
Defeat Great-Tusk while riding your Clefthoof -In-Training.
*[[Great-Tusk]] Killed
*[[Icehoof-In-Training Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
The first step in training your mount for war will be getting it used to the sights and sounds of combat. If it's not trained properly, it might get spooked and run.

Take this little clefthoof out to the plains of Shadowmoon Valley and take on the biggest beast you can find, together. That should raise its confidence!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (20)

==Completion==
That should do it a world of good. We'll let 'er rest for tonight, and take on some bigger targets tomorrow.

==Progression==
