==Objectives==
Defeat Ironbore while riding your Riverbeast-In-Training.
*[[Ironbore]] Killed
*[[Riverwallow-In-Training Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
Alright, we've taken on foes in the sky and on land, and even in the rain. What happens when the beasts are below your feet, though? We're about to find out!

The [[rockworm]] is a cunning predator, striking at prey from below the sands. Many beasts of Nagrand have grown wary of the rumbling of the earth. Take your [[riverbeast]] on out to the sandy shores and see if you can't take down one of the elder rockworms: Ironbore.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (20)

==Completion==
The sand worm's bit the dust? Well done, I'll get this beast bedded down for the night.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
