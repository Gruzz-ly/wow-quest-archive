Defeat High Sage Viryx in [[Skyreach]].
*[[High Sage Viryx (tactics)|High Sage Viryx]] slain

==Description==
High Sage Viryx has finished a devastatin' crystal superweapon atop the highest point in Skyreach in [[Spires of Arak]]. She intends to eradicate the 'lesser races' in the name of their god [[Rukhmar]].

The arakkoa outcasts were nearly wiped out in mere seconds by the weapon. You must stop Viryx before she turns her sights to your garrison!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Garrison Resources]] (175)
*{{cost|61|60}}
*30,140 [[XP]]

==Progress==
High Sage Viryx threatens all you have accomplished.  She must be stopped at all costs.

==Completion==
Perhaps now the Adherents of Rukhmar will respect we 'lesser races'.

==Patch changes==
