'''Solidarity in Death''' is the quest to receive the ghost [[Ahm]], who has shown up outside the main gate of [[Lunarfall]]/at the graveyard of [[Frostwall]] as a follower after he died following [[Dying Wish (quest)]] in [[Talador]].

==Completion==
I may have fallen, but I will not be forgotten.

I implore you to allow me to stay here and serve in your army.  [[Blademaster Bralok|Bralok]] took my life, but my spirit stands strong before you.

I need to stop the [[Iron Horde]], <name>, and I know you are the only one that can help me do that.

==Rewards==
You will learn: Follower: [[Ahm]]

==Notes==
Ahm is the only quest follower to be guaranteed to have Enchanting as a trait.
