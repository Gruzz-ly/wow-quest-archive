== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Dungar Longdrink]] to secure a flight to [[Talador]].
*Flight to Talador secured

== Description ==
The auburn forests of Talador sit at a critical crossroads of this continent, commander. The [[Iron Horde|Iron Horde's]] fleet is already en route from [[Gorgrond]] to [[Shattrath]] on the west coast.

Talador will fall if we don't reinforce them. I took the liberty of dispatching [[Foreman Eksos]], who has already begun construction on [[Fort Wrynn|an outpost]] for your forces not far from the Iron Horde landing point. He awaits your orders sir.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|30}}
* 1400 XP

== Completion ==
I won't waste any of your time, <sir/madame>. Let us discuss strategy.

== Notes ==
Get to the flightmaster:
:{{gossip|Take me to my base in Talador.}}
At [[Fort Wrynn]] speak with [[Foreman Eksos]]. Completing the quest will learn the garrison and [[Anchorite's Sojourn]] flight paths automatically.

==Progression==
{{Establishing your Outpost}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
