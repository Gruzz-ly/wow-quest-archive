== Objectives ==
[[File:Delegating on Draenor - step 1.jpg|thumb|Step 1: Select a mission]]
[[File:Delegating on Draenor - step 2.jpg|thumb|Step 2: Select a follower]]
[[File:Delegating on Draenor - step 3.jpg|thumb|Step 3: Start the mission]]

Use the Command Table to send [[Qiana Moonshadow]] on a mission.
*Use the Command Table {{co|40.4|53.5|Lunarfall||1}}

== Description ==
There is more work to do on Draenor than we can possibly handle by ourselves. We need to start delegating.

A group of night elves need a champion at [[Starfall Outpost]].

Qiana is a perfect fit [[Killing the Corrupted|for this mission]].

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|40}}
* 13450 XP

== Progress ==
You can use the Command Table to assign missions to your followers.

== Completion ==
This is a good start, but we will need more champions to deal with the trials that lay ahead.

== Notes ==
Interact with the Command Table in front of Thorn. Select the active mission, then drag Qiana to the drop target and begin the mission.

This concludes the "Establishing a Foothold" portion of [[As I Walk Through the Valley of the Shadow of Moon]]. The [[Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe) storyline|Shadowmoon Valley storyline]] continues with [[A Hero's Welcome (quest)]] from [[Yrel]] outside. [[Vindicator Maraad]] starts another chapter of the storyline with [[Migrant Workers]], but do Yrel's chain at [[Embaari Village]] first.

On complete:
