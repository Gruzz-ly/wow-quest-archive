==Objectives==
Speak to [[Bodrick Grey]] at [[Lunarfall|your garrison]] in {{Au|Shadowmoon Valley}}.

==Description==
;Willem
Welcome back, <sir/mam>.

One of Bodrick's men delivered a message about a [[caravan]] being dispatched for {{Au|Nagrand}}. He's awaiting your approval on a new outpost.

I've been hearing whispers around camp about Nagrand. They say it's {{Au|Warsong clan|Warsong}} territory. They might need your help <sir/mam>.

;Iskar
One of your soldiers stopped by asking for you while you were out. Something about a caravan heading out to Nagrand.

Whatever it was, it can't have gone well for them. That's Warsong territory.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,480 [[XP]]
*{{cost|1|46}}

==Completion==
Commander. Good to have you back.

We've got some movement in Nagrand. Let me fill you in on the details.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
