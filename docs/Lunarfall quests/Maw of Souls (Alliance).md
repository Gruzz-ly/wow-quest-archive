==Objectives==
Defeat Gorefiend in {{Au|Hellfire Citadel}}.
*[[Gorefiend]] slain

==Description==
Falling into the heart o' the mausoleum in {{Au|Auchindoun}}, [[Teron'gor]] gorged upon hundreds o' [[draenei]] [[soul]]s, becoming a bloated abomination in the process.

No longer recognizable as an [[orc]], Teron'gor gave up his old name and has taken on the mantle of Gorefiend.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|61|60}}
*[[Apexis Crystal]] (1000)
*30,140 XP

==Progress==
I hope you make Gorefiend pay for his atrocities.

==Completion==
That was some kind of monster, wasn't it?
