== Objectives ==
[[Captain Adams]] has asked you to kill 15 Gjalerbron Warriors, 8 Gjalerbron Rune-casters, and 8 Gjalerbron Sleep-watchers. Afterward, return to him at [[Westguard Keep]].
* [[Gjalerbron Warrior]] slain: (15)
* [[Gjalerbron Rune-Caster]] slain (8)
* [[Gjalerbron Sleep-Watcher]]: slain: (8)

== Description ==
And now we have a different problem. My scouts that have lived to return have informed me that the [[vrykul]] are up to no good at their main fortress to the north.

They call the place [[Gjalerbron]], though you'd pronounce the 'Gj' as if it were an 'Sh'. Odd creatures.

But that's not important; what is, is that you get up there and put an end to the lives of as many of those creatures as you can while trying to figure out what they're up to.

I know that I can count on you, <name>.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Completion ==
Good work, <name>, and good riddance.

But what you say about that place troubles me still, and I think our culling is not quite at an end.
