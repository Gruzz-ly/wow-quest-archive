==Description==
When you've been in lots of fight like Gorth, you learn that to beat enemy good you have to make them really scared to die!

But these vrykuls not afraid. You kill one and another comes... screaming louder and with a bigger weapon than the one before.

Only thing that makes vrykuls afraid is when we kill the biggest and baddest vrykul of all.
