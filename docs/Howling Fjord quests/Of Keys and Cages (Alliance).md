== Objectives ==
[[Father Levariol]] has asked you to collect enough [[Gjalerbron Cage Key]] to free 12 Gjalerbron Prisoners. Return to him at [[Westguard Keep]] when you manage to do so.
* [[Gjalerbron Prisoner]] freed: (12)

== Description ==
The captain may not care, but from the little we know, the [[vrykul]] are conducting heinous rites in some sort of 'awakening' ritual up north in [[Gjalerbron]].

They're using living sacrifices to fuel their unholy rituals!

<class>, you must put a stop to this! It matters not who or what is in those cages, they must be freed. I'd bet that the vrykul hold the keys.

The [[Light]] knows the last thing we need is more of those strange vrykul walking about, or worse yet, them wakening something even more evil!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
With the prisoners at Gjalerbron freed, the vrykul will be unable to continue their unholy rites.

You're our only hope of stopping them.

== Completion ==
Bless you, child. With your help, the Light shines in even the darkest of places.

Please, take this as just compensation for your good deeds. I shall see to the salvation of those you freed; at least, those truely within the Light, and the [[Alliance]], who returned here to the keep.

== Upon completion ==
:{{text|whisper|Mage-Lieutenant Malister|<name>, I would have words with you.}}
:''You are offered [[Sleeping Giants (Alliance)]] into Gjalerbron

== Notes ==
Key drop rate is low! Small chance of getting a big key for the cage in the middle to release ~5 prisoners at once.

==Progression==
{{Stop the Ascension! (Alliance)}}
