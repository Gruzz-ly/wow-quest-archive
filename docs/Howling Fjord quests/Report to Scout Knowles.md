== Objectives ==
[[Captain Adams]] has asked you to report to [[Scout Knowles]] at the [[Ember Spear Tower]].

== Description ==
<Name>, now that those damnable proto-creatures have been dealt with, I've another task for you.

One of my scouts has reported back some suspicious activity by the [[Forsaken]] to the south. It looks like they're up to no good at the [[vrykul]] village known as [[Halgrind]].

I want you to personally take over the investigation down there. Speak with Scout Knowles to find out what he's uncovered and proceed from there.

His last reported position is at the Ember Spear Tower, just to the west of Halgrind.

== Completion ==
Oh good, help, and just in time!
