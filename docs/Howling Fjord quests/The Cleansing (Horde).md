== Objectives ==
[[Sage Mistwalker]] at [[Steel Gate]] has advised you to cleanse yourself of [[Your Inner Turmoil]] through meditation at the [[Frostblade Shrine]].
* Cleansed of Your Inner Turmoil

== Description ==
We braved the [[Rivenwood]] because of my troubled dreams concerning my [[worg]] life-friend, [[Ulfang]]. He has called out for help, and you must go to him.

But, you do not have the means to speak with him, or walk amongst the other worgs. I know a way.

First, you must cleanse your inner turmoil.

There is a shrine that sits at the top of [[Frostblade Peak]], northeast of [[Camp Winterhoof]]. A single path leads up to it from the western base of the mountain.

Meditate there and then return to me. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Completion ==
Already I can sense the change within you.

Are you ready for what comes next?
