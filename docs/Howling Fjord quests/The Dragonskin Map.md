==Objectives==
Bring the Dragonskin Map to High Executor Anselm in Vengeance Landing.
*[[Dragonskin Map]] (provided)

==Description==
Upon closer inspection, the scroll appears to be a heavily-illustrated map of the fjord. The location of various villages are depicted in what seem to be tribal symbols.

The location of Vengeance Landing is marked with a disproportionately large skull.

This map will almost certainly be of military value to High Executor Anselm. 

==Progress==
You've something to show me, <class>?

==Completion==
<The high executor looks at the map intently, occasionally looking up at landmarks around the Fjord.>

Here's the eastern coastline over here. The Dragonflayer and Winterskorn villages are here and here... and this must be us over here, marked for death.
