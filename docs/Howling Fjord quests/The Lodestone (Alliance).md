==Objectives==
[[Researcher Aderan]] at [[Fort Wildervar]] wants you to compare the Rune Sample with the [[Broken Tablet (Howling Fjord object)|Broken Tablet]].
* Compare Runes with the Broken Tablet
Suggested Players [3]
*[[Rune Sample]] (provided)

==Description==
If we can locate what's luring the giants northwest, we might be able to stop them before they reach their destination.

Although I was able to decipher many of the runes on the samples you brought me, the ones I don't know concern me the most. When I visited [[Giants' Run]], I noticed a large broken tablet jutting from the ground where the northeastern part of the area met the snow at the foot of [[Frostblade Peak]]. Take this sample, compare the runes with the tablet, and see what you can learn.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5}}

==Progress==
Have you discovered what lodestone attracts the giants?

==Completion==
<Aderan listens as you describe your findings.>

Of course! This [[Megalith]] must be the key to the [[Iron dwarf|Iron Dwarves']] plans. We must destroy it before their plan comes to fruition.

==Notes==
Soloable. Just find the Broken Tablet{{coords|71.6|17.6|Howling Fjord}}, use the item and watch the event.
