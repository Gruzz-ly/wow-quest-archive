== Objectives ==
[[Guard Captain Zorek]] at [[Valgarde]] in [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to recover the Harpoon Operation Manual.
* [[Harpoon Operation Manual]]

== Description ==
Two weeks ago our chief [[engineer]] got his hands on a [[vrykul]] harpoon gun - the same type of gun those bastards use to take down our ships. By studying that gun he managed to put together a comprehensive operation manual.

Unfortunately he was abducted and taken north of here to [[Wyrmskull Village]]. We eventually did find him, but near death and without the manual. His dying words indicated that the manual was lost in the [[Utgarde Catacombs]], located at the northeast end of Wyrmskull. Get me that manual!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
Did you find the manual?

== Completion ==
<Zorek flips through the manual>

Hrm, interesting...

According to the manual, the vrykul have a special tool that allows them to control the harpoon guns with deadly accuracy. It looks a bit like the wheel of one of our ships. Furthermore, it's portable and seems to plug into the harpoon guns like a key. We need to get our hands on one of those!

== Notes ==
The manual is located next to [[Ares the Oathbound]] in the [[Utgarde Catacombs]].
