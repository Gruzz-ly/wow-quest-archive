== Objectives ==
[[Lurielle]] at the [[Frozen Glade]] wants you to kill 10 Thornvine Creepers. 
* [[Thornvine Creeper]] slain: (10)

== Description ==
The glade to the west has been transformed into a hideous place called the [[Twisted Glade]]. Horrible beasts dwell among the trees, stones, and pool of the glade.

I cannot guess where the creatures came from or what horrible forces animate them, but they must be dealt with!

I fear that if they are allowed to dominate the glade, they will poison it beyond redemption. Clear the glade of these creatures who murdered our sisters. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
Have you seen the horrors of the Twisted Glade for yourself?

== Completion ==
You have done well, <name>. If we'd had allies like you when the land first began to change, perhaps we might have been able to preserve some of what we've lost.
