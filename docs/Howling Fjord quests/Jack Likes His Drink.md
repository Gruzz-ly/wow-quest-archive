== Objectives ==
[[Taruk]] at [[Scalawag Point]] in [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to collect Jack Adams' Debt.
* [[Jack Adams' Debt]]

== Description ==
Our next customer, [[Jack Adams]], won't be the pushover that Harry was. He spends all day drinking with his friends, tough pirates all of them. Let's not use force this time, could get ugly.

See if you can use his drinking habit to your advantage. There's only so much alcohol someone can handle before passing out.

Maybe one of the bar wenches will be of assistance. Once he's out, see if you can slip your hand into his pocket and get what's mine.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|9|40}}

== Progress ==
Did you get what's mine, <name>?

== Completion ==
I'm impressed, <name> And I'm not the type who's easily impressed.

== Notes ==
Talk to [[Olga, the Scalawag Wench]].

A dialog box pops up: "Do you really want to bribe Olga? {{cost|1}}"
