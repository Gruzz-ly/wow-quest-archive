== Objectives ==
[[Hidalgo the Master Falconer|Hidalgo]] at the [[Explorers' League Outpost]] in the [[Howling Fjord]] wants you to use your Trained Rock Falcon to capture 8 Fjord Hawk Eggs.

Return to Hidalgo with the cage when you have completed this task.
* [[Fjord Hawk Egg]]: 8
* [[Trained Rock Falcon]] (provided)

== Description ==
You are most definitely ready for the next step in falconry, <name>.

Take your trained falcon east of here, to the [[vrykul]] [[Vrykul Hawk Roost|hawk roost]] near the [[Stonewall Lift]]. From the roost you will send out your falcon to steal the eggs of the hawks. Their nests will be located in remote areas of the cliff walls surrounding the roost. Locate those nests and use your falcon to scavenge for the eggs!

Beware the [[Fjord Hawk Matriarch|fjord hawk matriarchs]], <name>. Should you come under attack, use your falcon's escape and soar abilities to flee!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Flexible Leather Footwraps
|Fire-Purifying Tunic
|Inescapable Girdle
|Light-Bound Chestguard}}

You will also receive: {{cost|9|40}}

== Progress ==
You are in control now, <name>. Guide your falcon and bring me those eggs.

== Completion ==
Bravo, <name>! Bravo! The bond of kinship between you and your falcon is strong! Perhaps you can run some reconnaissance missions against the vrykul in the not-too-distant future?

== Notes ==
The Vrykul Hawk Roost is located due east of camp. It's a rock monument right by the edge of the cliff. Using the cage casts [[Eyes of the Beast]] on your hawk. Action bar actions are now: Scavange (collect egg), Soar (+300% flight speed), Escape (confuse attacking bird). Take this opportunity to freely explore everywhere in reach within 5 minutes of the roost. The attacking birds hit the hawk hard (crushing almost always), so try to avoid combat. If you aggro a bird, target it, hit 3 (Escape), then 2 (Soar) and speed away.
