== Objectives ==
Deliver the Scourge Device to [[Explorer Jaren]] on the [[Chillmere Coast]].
* [[Scourge Device (Alliance)]]

== Description ==
The [[Scourge]] creature you just destroyed had this device held in its clutches. It has a jewel set into it which looks similar to the one that tops the [[Scourging Crystal|scourging crystals]].

Surely, Explorer Jaren would like to have a look at this.

== Progress ==
What an odd-looking device you have there, <class>. Let me have a closer look at it.

== Completion ==
I know what this is! <name>, it's a controlling device for those scourging crystals!

I bet anything that it can be used to shut down their force fields. Hmmm.

<The explorer looks thoughtful as he ponders the implications of you having the device.>

== Notes ==
Should drop pretty quickly while on "Murlocs Smelled Bad".
