== Objectives ==
Use the large Vrykul Harpoon Gun in [[Nifflevar]] to launch yourself into [[Valgarde]]. Report your victory over the [[Vrykul]] to [[Guard Captain Zorek]].
* Go Harpoon Surfing

== Description ==
Navigating the steep bluffs of [[Howling Fjord]] can be nerve-racking! I've come up with a solution to ease that burden by utilizing vrykul technology and [[dwarf|dwarven]] ingenuity. With just a few adjustments and some fine tuning I've created Icehammer's harpoon controller! Of course it hasn't been tested, but that's what you're here for!

Take the controller to the big gun in Nifflevar and use it to launch yourself into Valgarde. Report your victory to Zorek. Oh yea, you can keep the controller.

==Progress==
<Zorek raises an eyebrow at you.>

== Completion ==
You are insane, <name>! What kind of degenerate would actually launch themselves from a harpoon gun as a method of travel?

But I guess you need to be a little crazy to pull off what you did up there on the bluffs! Fantastic work! We've gotten word that the Dragonflayer leader, [[Ingvar the Plunderer|Ingvar]], is furious! Maybe one day you'll be ready to stomp his face into the dirt - in the name of our beloved [[Alliance]].

*[[Icehammer's Harpoon Controller]] is permanent. Dunno how much use will be had, but hey. At least it's a key.
*''Let's go surfin' now'' is the first line of the chorus to the Beach Boys song Surfin' Safari [http://www.lyricsdomain.com/2/beach_boys/surfin_safari.html].
