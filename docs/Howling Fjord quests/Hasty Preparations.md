== Objectives ==
Ahota Whitefrost at Camp Winterhoof wants you to bring him 10 clumps of Spotted Hippogryph Down.
* [[Spotted Hippogryph Down]] (10)

== Description ==
The down of the spotted hippogryph is prized by my people and used for everything from fletching to ceremonial clothing. We're making preparations to leave the post, so this is the last chance I'll get to gather it this season.

With your help, I'll have enough to make sure everyone has the equipment they need for the long trek into the hills. Conditions worsen very quickly up there and a storm can blow in without warning.

The down can be found all over the ground in the area surrounding the post.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Artfully Tooled Leggings
|Songscale Breastplate
|Cold-Forged Bronze Legplates
|Shimmering Cold-Iron Band}}
You will also receive: {{cost|4|70}}

== Progress ==
Have you gathered any of the down?

== Completion ==
With your contribution, we'll be well prepared for the journey. I haven't much to offer you for your help, but I will give you a choice of some of my spare combat gear.
